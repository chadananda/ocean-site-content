Foreword
This monograph consists of English translations of two research essays by Bahram
Choubine.1 The first is Dr. Muhammad Musaddiq and the Baha’is, originally published in Persian
by Sherkat Ketab in 2009. This learned article has been translated at the request of the
author and the publisher and is presented below in an expanded form with additional
annotations. The second translated essay by Bahram Choubine is entitled, “Suppression of
the Baha’is of Iran in 1955.” Both articles have been translated and annotated by Ahang
Rabbani and are briefly introduced below before their full translation is provided.2

A Few Words about Dr. Musaddiq and the Baha’is
The Baha’i community has had a presence in Yazd and its surrounding towns from the time
of Baha’u’llah. By 1903, the Baha’i community of Iran had experienced nearly a half-century
of relative peace. During this period the community had changed its character from a
militant messianic Babi community, to a peace-loving, ethically bound, progressive-minded
Baha’i community that had grown considerably in numerical strength and geographic spread.
Throughout this interval, however, Baha’is continued to be periodically harassed and
occasionally a few were killed by their opponents, often as an excuse for political ambitions,
but no large-scale persecution took place. This pattern changed drastically in the summer of
1903, when a pogrom was unleashed against the community in Yazd and its surrounding
regions, resulting in the murder of several hundreds of defenseless Baha’is.3 Even though
this incident was not spread across the nation, it may well be regarded as the first notable
collusion of the local and state authorities with the ecclesiastical establishment in an attempt
to bring about total eradication of the Baha’i community.

After that incident, most of the Baha’is of this region moved to other regions—notably
to the newly founded town of Ishqabad in Turkmenistan—while a few returned home to
rebuild their lives and businesses. Gradually, the community gained strength and
reestablished its activities, though always under the watchful eye of the fanatical Shi‘i clergy.

In the nearby small town of Abarqu, however, there were no Baha’is until the summer of
1949, when a retired Baha’i by the name of ‘Abbas-‘Ali Purmihdi settled there. He had been
an employee of the postal service and delivered mail and packages from Yazd to Abarqu; as
such, he knew many of the inhabitants of this town.

A few months later, on January 3, 1950, a 50-year-old Muslim woman by the name of
Sughra and her five children were brutally murdered one night. What followed had profound
implications for the Baha’is of that region, and indeed the entire country, and involved the

community. He has, however, on numerous occasions spoken strongly in support of the human rights of
Baha’is in Iran and written extensively about the beleaguered religious minorities of that country. His
collaborator, Ahang Rabbani, is a member of the Baha’i community and has authored numerous books and
research articles on the history and teachings of the Baha’i faith. Some of his publications can be accessed at

3 In 1903, in an effort to engage Western countries in defense of the Baha’is of Iran, ‘Abdu’l-Baha wrote a

treatise about the tragic events of that summer, a translation of which is available at Rabbani, “‘Abdu’l-Baha’s
Proclamation on the Persecution of Baha’is in 1903.”

administration of Dr. Muhammad Musaddiq (May 19, 1882–March 5, 1967), the nationalistic
prime minister from April 28, 1951 to August 19, 1953 (except for a brief period July 17–20,
1952).

Discussion of the history of this event and an analysis of documents pertaining to it are
the subject of Dr. Choubine’s first essay appearing in this monograph. This essay was
completed in March 2009 and published in Persian the summer of the same year. However,
to aid the reader, it may be beneficial to outline the indisputable facts of this incident:

•   During the night of January 3, 1950, a Muslim woman named Sughra and her five

children were brutally killed in Abarqu in their own home;
•   All evidence suggested that the murderers were three men who perpetrated this

> crime at the instigation of Isfandiyar Salari, an influential landlord of this town.

Media outlets, including the nationwide Dad newspaper, stated the same;
•   Arrival of an inspector from Yazd by the name of Sadiqi changed the course of the

> investigation. He selected Sergeant Khakpur—a close friend and an associate of
> Salari—to investigate and prepare the police file;
> •   Khakpur initially arrested several innocent men and tried to place the blame on them;
•   He then went to Yazd and upon returning claimed that Baha’is had had a hand in

this murder;
> •   Several Baha’is found in nearby villages were arrested;
•   The entire nine-member Spiritual Assembly of the Baha’is of Yazd was arrested as

well;
•   Widespread anti-Baha’ism engulfed the region, resulting in the pillage of many Baha’i

homes and causing dozens of Baha’is to become homeless;
> •   The involvement of influential ‘ulama in directing the events was evident;
•   Recognizing that the events were orchestrated by the Shi‘i clerical establishment to

> undermine his authority, Prime Minister Razmara ordered that the Baha’i complaints
> be disregarded, so that he would not be charged as a Baha’i sympathizer by the
> clerics;
•   At every stage of the investigation, the initial inspectors who had reported the

> charges against the Baha’is as baseless were dismissed and replaced with fanatical
> judgments;
> •   The government changed, and Dr. Musaddiq assumed premiership;
•   When Dr. Musaddiq was in the United States, the American Baha’is appealed to him

> for the administration of justice and protection of religious minorities; despite his
> promise to do so, Dr. Musaddiq was unable to deliver;
•   The highest criminal court in Iran tried the case in 1952 and again in 1954, and

> twelve Baha’i and three Muslim defendants were sentenced to various terms of
> incarceration. An innocent Muslim, on the false charge of being involved with the
> murders and of being a Baha’i, was executed.

This incident thus aptly demonstrates the nature of anti-Baha’ism in Iran when the state and
the clerical establishment colluded against the Baha’i community and serves as a microcosm
for understanding the dynamics of social relations concerning the Baha’is in that land.
Throughout the entire twentieth-century, every opportunity has been seized upon by the
fanatical clergy, at times with the alliance of the authorities, to falsely blame misfortunes and

crimes upon beleaguered Baha’is, who have remained completely defenseless in protecting
themselves by any appeal to the law. In a number of instances, most notably in 1950s, and
more recently during the Islamic Republic, the authorities have used this religious minority
group as a means of distracting public opinion away from real problems confronting the
nation.

Suppression of the Baha’is of Iran in 1955
In introducing ‘Ali Dashti’s seminal work, 23 Sal [23 years], Bahram Choubine has penned
an enlightening essay that places the events of twentieth-century Iran in their fuller
perspective. This essay has been made available on the Internet.4

More recently, the erudite author has considerably expanded this essay and included
more analysis and documentation, offering it as a preface to Dashti’s 23 Sal, distributed by
Alburz Publishing, in Frankfurt, Germany. A section of this expanded essay (pages 34–42),
appearing under the heading, “Sarkub Baha’iyan” [The suppression of the Baha’is], is
provided below in translation.

Preface
Aequum et bonum est lex legum.
[What is good and equal, is the law of laws.]

Events during the past three decades have drawn attention to the continued existence of an
important Baha’i community in Iran—perhaps the largest minority group of that country
and most likely the largest non-Muslim body of people in the Middle East—the plight of
which under the Islamic Republic has provoked widespread comment in the world’s press,
merited attention and action in the United Nations and its various international agencies, and
drawn condemnation in a number of national parliaments.

Since the Islamic Revolution, the activities of the Baha’i community of Iran have been
severely curtailed. Physical, psychological, legal, social, and economic persecution of the
community has been relentless, nationwide, malicious, and closely coordinated by the state
and clerical establishment. Several hundreds of its membership, including much of its
leadership, have been put to death, some by formal execution, others as a result of mob
violence; hundreds, perhaps thousands, of others have been imprisoned—many of these
have been tortured, often with the aim of extracting a denial of faith, and the vast majority
have been deprived of access to legal representation; properties owned by Baha’is, both
communal and personal, have been seized, looted, and destroyed; holy places and cemeteries
of the community have been desecrated and demolished; assets of Baha’i companies have
been confiscated and their operations halted; a large percentage of adherents have been
dismissed from private and public employment, and none have been permitted to work in
governmental agencies or educational sectors; Baha’i pensioners have been barred from
collecting retirement funds; members of the faith-community have been disallowed access to
public health facilities; Baha’i children have been subjected to abuse at schools and Baha’i
youth denied access to institutions of higher education; the Baha’is in particular, and
minority groups in general, have been made the target of a systematic campaign of lies and
slander and libel by the national media, such as the infamous Kayhan newspaper, and the
subject of countless polemics and anti-Baha’i seminars; Baha’i administrative bodies have
been dismantled and much of their membership incarcerated; Baha’i publications of all
forms have been seized and the Baha’i residents targeted for regular raids by the agents of
the Ministry of Intelligence. Perhaps most grievously, tens of thousands of Baha’is—maybe
more—have been forced to leave their native land, mostly without any of their possessions,
and to seek a new life in diaspora.

The intense persecution of the last thirty years did not occur in a vacuum. Behind it lies a
history of decades of continual harassment and discrimination against the beleaguered
Baha’is of Iran. Perhaps to better understand the matrix within which these events—and also
the events of 1950–54, which are the subject of this monograph—occurred, it would help to
briefly survey the history of this community.

Historical Background
The Babi movement, a precursor to the Baha’i faith, began in 1844 when a young merchant
in Shiraz by the name of Siyyid ‘Ali-Muhammad proclaimed that he was “the Bab” [the
Gate], the personification of the much-anticipated hidden Twelfth Imam, a Messiah-like

figure whose appearance had been expected by Shi‘i Muslims for exactly one thousand years.

The Bab further claimed that his appearance was to prepare the way for the advent of
another prophet, whom he styled “Him Whom God shall make manifest,” whose teachings
would establish unity, peace, and order on earth.5

In short time, the Bab’s proposed reforms attracted many followers, but the embryonic
community soon met with intense hostility from the social élites of the nation—in particular
the Shi‘i clerical establishment.6 The Bab’s followers were organized and actively pressed
their program forward, and in several instances they engaged in armed clashes with
government forces.7 Over the next several years, thousands of Babis were imprisoned,
tortured in public, and eventually murdered on the order of religious and political
authorities.8

The Bab was imprisoned and eventually executed on July 9, 1850. Suppression of the
Babi movement often precipitated as a result of collusion between the clergy and the
political authorities. The former opposed the new faith on religious grounds, while the latter
believed that the Babi reforms were a threat to the security of the state. This latter belief was
considered further confirmed by an assassination attempt on Nasiri’d-Din Shah following
the Bab’s execution. The failed attempt on the Shah’s life provoked a renewed assault on the
Babi community. Abrahamian notes that the Babi prisoners were “paraded in chains through
Tehran, given a final opportunity to recant, and then portioned out for execution to various
groups—to the royal family, the Qajar tribe, the clergy, the ministries, the military, the
merchants, and the bazaar guilds.…Some were blinded before being shot; others were
stabbed repeatedly, then decapitated; yet others were beaten mercilessly before being
strangled.”9 In an article dated November 16, 1852, the New York Times reports that
“upwards of 400 Babis were put to death in Tehran, as accomplices in the recent attempt
against the life of the Shah….The unhappy sufferers were all tortured in the most cruel
manner.”10

In the midst of this fiery ordeal, and deep in the Siyah-Chal dungeon of Tehran, a young
nobleman by the name of Mirza Husayn-‘Ali, and known to history as Baha’u’llah [the Glory
of God], who had been wrongly accused of being party to the assassination attempt,
discovered that he was the fulfillment of the promised “Him Whom God shall make
manifest.” After release from prison in 1852, Baha’u’llah spent much of his subsequent life

vicious pogrom against real and suspected Babis inside Iran, with much public torture of those accused,
resulting in several thousand deaths,” and asserts that “the truly gruesome aspect of church-state entanglement
was demonstrated in the joint efforts of officials and clergy to invent ever more ingenious ways of inflicting
pain on those branded heretics.”

Baha was an eyewitness to these Babi killings and has recorded some of his observations; see Mu’ayyad, Eight

in exile and captivity until his death in 1892, however, the religion he founded and headed
until his death continued to spread and grow into a worldwide community.

The claim advanced by the Bab and Baha’u’llah to be messengers of God is the principal
reason why the Baha’i faith is considered to be heretical by Muslims, who believe the
Prophet Muhammad to be the final prophet that will ever be sent by God. This has
crystallized into a widely held belief that Baha’is are “public enemies who must be controlled,
punished or…forcibly reconverted.”11 Moreover, the interpretation of Shi‘i law practiced in
Iran (based on the Qur’anic teachings) asserts that conversion from Islam into another
faith—that is, apostasy—is an offense punishable by death. This prohibition is also used to
justify punishment of individuals who, under duress, agree to convert to Islam, but
subsequently resume the practice of their own faith. Influenced by the Shi‘i clergy and fueled
by nationalism, Iranians generally view the global message of the Baha’i faith as an alien,
even pro-Western, interference in Iran.12

During its entire history, the Baha’i community of Iran has faced repeated cycles of
persecution, varying in intensity. Since its inception, the Baha’is of Iran have not enjoyed any
measure of liberty to practice their religion and have suffered concentrated, widespread
economic and social exclusion. Great numbers of its members have been subjected to
execution, thousands have suffered arbitrary imprisonment, and many smaller Baha’i
communities of that country have experienced periodic pogroms. Another recurring aspect
of anti-Baha’i campaigns has been the confiscation and destruction of Baha’i property,
including holy sites, cemeteries, personal property, and community institutions. In Shiraz, the
house occupied by the Bab, one of the Baha’i community’s most sacred religious icons and a
site of obligatory pilgrimage for future Baha’is, was attacked on several occasions and was
finally totally demolished in 1979 by the country’s Islamic Republic. All these waves of
persecution have been carried out with the support of national judicial, administrative, and
law-enforcement systems.

The Baha’i community has suffered most severely when the clerical influence in national
affairs has been strongest. The 1950s witnessed organized anti-Baha’i campaigns resulting in
mob violence, destruction of religious sites, and the formation of private anti-Baha’i
organizations, approved and assisted by senior civil, military, and religious leadership figures.
The propaganda used to cultivate and justify social persecution created negative stereotypes
that continue to have repercussions to the present day. Clerics who gained an influential
public voice during these campaigns later attained powerful positions in the post-1979
Islamic Republic.

Part 1
Dr. Musaddiq and the Baha’is

Introduction:
Iran and the Cold War

Preamble
The lives of Baha’is in Iran are constantly under threat and filled with interminable dangers.
Theirs is an unceasing struggle to achieve human rights and legitimate recognition. Let us lift
our vision to a new perspective of liberty and justice based on the code of law.

The period spanning from 1941 to August 19, 1953 was filled with days of mystery and
secrets in modern Iranian history. By the late 1930s, Reza Shah had become increasingly
despotic and disliked. Parliament assented to his decrees, the free press was suppressed, and
the swift incarceration of political leaders like Dr. Musaddiq and the murder of others like
Taymurtash and Davar halted the formation of any democratic process. The situation
continued to worsen, and in August 1941, Britain and the Soviet Union occupied Iran by a
massive assault, subsequently forcing Reza Shah to abdicate in favor of his son, Muhammad-
Reza Shah. In 1951, under the leadership of the nationalist movement of Dr. Muhammad
Musaddiq, the Iranian parliament unanimously voted to nationalize the oil industry. This
shut out the immensely profitable Anglo-Iranian Oil Company (AIOC), which was a pillar of
Britain’s economy and political influence in the region. A month after that vote, Musaddiq
came to power as the prime minister, committed to reestablishing democracy and
constitutional monarchy, and to nationalizing the entire Iranian petroleum industry. From
the start he erroneously believed that the Americans, who had no apparent stake in AIOC,
would support his nationalization plan. He was buoyed in this hope by Henry Grady, the
American ambassador to Iran. However, during these events, the Americans supported the
British, and, fearing that the Communists with the help of the Soviets were poised to
overthrow the government, they decided to remove Musaddiq. In late 1952, the British
government invited Kermit Roosevelt of the United States Central Intelligence Agency
(CIA) to London and proposed that they cooperate under the code name “Operation Ajax”
to bring down Musaddiq. Under the direction of the CIA and the British Secret Intelligence
Service, a covert operation took place to depose Musaddiq with the help of military forces
loyal to the Shah. Despite high-level coordination and planning, the coup initially failed,
causing the Shah to flee first to Baghdad, then to Rome. After a brief exile in Italy, the Shah
returned to Iran, this time through a successful second attempt at a coup on August 19,
1953\. The deposed Musaddiq was arrested, given a show trial, and sentenced to solitary
confinement for three years in a military prison, followed by house arrest for life in his estate
at Ahmadabad, where he is now buried. General Fadlu’llah Zahidi was installed to succeed
Prime Minister Musaddiq, and he quickly reversed most of reforms brought about during the
Musaddiq era.

The purpose of this essay, however, is not to investigate all aspects of this period; it only
aims to offer short glimpses and brief insights into the political thoughts of Dr. Muhammad

Musaddiq, Iran’s champion of the nationalist movement. This monograph is not written for
impatient individuals. In this brief essay, I am a fellow-traveler of Confucius, who said, “I
can never teach the person who tries with all his might not to understand anything” and
when he admonished us not to “judge historical events by our present standards.”
Therefore, I invite the reader to patience and forbearance, so in this way we can find our way
to knowledge and a station worthy of our humanity.13

Systematic Anti-Baha’ism in Contemporary Iran
In September 1941, Iran fell under the military occupation of the Allied forces of the Soviet
Union, Britain, and the United States. From the time Hitler came to power in Germany and
World War II commenced, tendencies favoring Hitler’s ideas and extreme nationalism could
be seen in Iran. Although Iran clearly and unambiguously declared her neutrality on two
separate occasions, this declaration did not save Iran, nor did it prevent her from being
occupied by Allied forces. After Hitler’s war machine attacked the Soviet Union in June
1941, Stalin’s Red Army, along with the British and American forces, invaded Iran in
accordance with Article 6 of the 1921 treaty between Iran and the Soviet Union, which gave
the latter the right to enter Iran in the event of threats from Iran.

In September 1941, Reza Shah was forced to abdicate his throne in favor of his son
Muhammad-Reza Pahlavi and was exiled to Mauritius, an island nation off East Africa that
was one of the British colonies.14 In truth, Muhammad-Reza Shah came to power through
the consent of the British and the farsightedness of Muhammad-‘Ali Furughi.15

Iran’s invasion and occupation by foreign governments, along with the collapse of her
military, police, and security apparatus, coupled with extremely poor economic conditions
brought about to a large measure by the occupying forces, in addition to constant hate
incitement and profit-mongering interference by the Allied regimes, created favorable
conditions for the orthodox elements and those aligned with foreigners to come to power.

Moreover, powerful entities, in particular the British and Americans, began to compete
with one another over the region’s natural resources, especially the oil reserves in Iran and
the Middle East. Therefore, they endeavored to extend their political, military, and economic
spheres of influence in Iran.

Naturally, the activities of the British and American governments in Iran and the Middle
East did not escape the notice of Stalin, the autocrat of the Union of Soviet Socialist
Republics (USSR). Therefore, he began to pursue the Soviet Union’s strategic objectives
through Iran’s Tudeh [Communist] Party—a Party he had a significant role in creating—in
the hope that Iran would not turn into a base against the interests of the Soviet Union.

In this confused but relatively free atmosphere, many parties, organizations, and groups
were formed in Iran with the support of the Soviet Union and England, and a little later with
backing from the United States, and people gained certain individual and societal liberties.
Political prisoners were freed. Once again, newspapers, political parties, and religious

375–453. (BC)

wrote several important publications in the field of philosophy. It is said that he was a leading Babi during his
generation.

organizations, which during the reign of Reza Shah had gone underground into a dark social
substratum, reemerged and gained much strength.

The mullas themselves confess that the departure of Reza Shah and the beginning of the
Cold War presented them with their most favorable historical juncture: “With Reza Khan
gone, the religious orthodoxy was more pleased than others and beat the drum of joy.
During this entire period of the suppression of intellectual proclivities, the clerics had kept
silent too. But now with the departure of Reza Khan, they were like doves freed from their
cage and were winging their flight.”16

However, Ahmad Kasravi (1890–1946), the noted linguist, historian, and brave critic of
the Shi‘i sect and of the corrupt clerical apparatus, had a different view: “Those [i.e., the
mullas] who had changed their clothing, came back to the ‘aba and turban. And those who
had gone into hiding in corners, came out into the open, and once again started to battle
with secular law, knowledge and all things good. Once again, young seminarians, bred on
begging and indolence, appeared on the field.”17

With the conclusion of World War II, Stalin used the same Article 6 of the 1921

agreement as a pretext not to remove his Red Army from Iran. With the deceitful support of
the Democratic Party in Azerbaijan and Kurdistan, he further fueled insecurities and created
disturbances in northern Iran. However, England and the United States well remembered
what they had witnessed in the Balkans and commenced to openly and strongly oppose the
designs of the Soviet Union; they even had to threaten atomic attack upon that country. This
was reckoned as the first encounter and reaction by the West against the Soviet Union
during the Cold War.

Eventually, with the departure of the Red Army from Iran and the disgraceful defeat of
the Democratic Party of Azerbaijan and Kurdistan in 1946, relative peace and tranquility was
established in Iran. However, the Cold War had commenced; Iran, with its 2,700-kilometer
border with the Soviet Union, became one of the unexpected opponents of that country and
a major pillar of the Cold War in the Middle East, and indeed in the entire world.

The Soviet Union had emerged from World War II weak, but victorious thanks to the
help of the United States and England. Nevertheless, from the perspective of revolutionaries
in those days, that country was considered to be the center of global socialism and was seen
as if it had a magical luster.

The aim of the Cold War in the West, and also in the Middle East, particularly in Iran,
was to oppose the spread of Communist-Marxist revolutionary ideas. Strengthening Islam by
promoting religious proclivities and superstitions was one of the most fundamental
instruments in waging the Cold War. This was a precious gift for the Shi‘i clerical
establishment, which in the past had had an intimate and cozy relationship with the British
imperialist regime. The only difference was that now, with the arrival of the United States on
Iran’s political scene, Shi‘i clerics had gained even more power and influence. From this
time, the clerical hierarchy became the closest ally and the most unified and cohesive support
for the Cold War and the powers of global imperialism. Through collaboration with foreign
governments, the entire structure of [Shi‘i] religiosity and the clerical establishment was
placed at the service of anti-nationalistic policies and opposition to the principles of
constitutional rule in the country. Once again, the clerics regained their traditional position,
which they had lost with the victory of Iran’s Constitutional Revolt [1905–11] and the

subsequent wise and sensible policies of Reza Shah that had prevented mullas from
interfering in affairs of state.

The Allied forces’ blueprint and design for winning the Cold War in Iran, which
stemmed from consultation and discussion with leading clerics and governmental figures,
was based on three principal pillars:

1. Opposition and conflict with Iran’s Tudeh Party and, in general, combating any

revolutionary thought, change, or innovation that had socialist or communist underpinning;

After the passing of Ayatu’llah Aqa Siyyid Abu’l-Hasan Isfahani and the sudden death of his
successor, Ayatu’llah Haji Aqa Husayn Qumi in Najaf [in Iraq], the marja‘iyat [leadership] of
Shi‘i Islam once again returned to Iran. Ayatu’llah Haji Aqa Husayn Burujirdi became the
marja‘ [source of emulation] and assumed the administration of the newly established
seminary in Qum. For nine years, he studied and was a student of Akhund Mulla Kazim
Khurasani, and he had become thoroughly familiar with all the details of political Islamism.
Akhund Mulla Kazim Khurasani had intimate and profitable ties with Britain’s imperialistic
regime.18 Memoirs and documents published after the Revolution clearly demonstrate that
Ayatu’llah Burujirdi and the clerical establishment were shrewdly pursuing the recovery and
strengthening of their reactionary powers. They illegally interfered in all aspects of the
country’s administration and showed their enmity towards Iran’s constitution and laws.

Beneath the same cloak of religious leadership and clericalism, the terrorist organization
Jam‘iyat Fada’iyan Islam [the Society of the Devotees of Islam] commenced operation under
the guidance of a young seminarian who had not benefited from Islamic knowledge, but who
was a religious fanatic beyond all sanity.19 The founding of the terrorist organization Jam‘iyat
Fada’iyan Islam under the leadership of Siyyid Mujtaba Mirlawhi, known as Navvab Safavi,
19   See appendix 7.

and a number of other large or small religious organizations, precipitated a decade of
bloodshed and persistent insecurity. Ultimately, it resulted in an open and purposeful
disregard for the constitutional law of the country, and various administrations—all based on
worn-out ideas and connected to imperialism—came and went one after another, without
any regard for the calamity that they were causing for the people of Iran.

In Tehran and other towns, widespread attacks began on the offices and centers of the
Tudeh Party, of the Baha’is, and of Ahmad Kasravi. In full daylight and in front of police
officers and security agents, Ahmad Kasravi, that fearless and headstrong critic of the Shi‘i
sect, and his secretary Haddadpur were assassinated March 11, 1946 in the national Palace of
Justice by terrorist members of Fada’iyan Islam in the most brutal manner. This first murder
over religious differences during the Cold War and inside Iran’s principal judicial building
was a clear warning to the Shah and to the government of [the Prime Minister] Qavamu’s-
Saltanih, who considered themselves the defenders of Iran’s constitutional law. However,
this momentous warning went unheeded by all those serving in the government. Siyyid
Husayn Imami, the murderer of Kasravi and his secretary, was freed from prison
accompanied by the cries of Allah’u’Akbar [“God is Great”]—a liberty which emboldened
and encouraged the instigators and masterminds of this bloody terror.

From this point onward, the Shi‘i leadership and the clerical establishment, along with
the political leaders of Iran, became partners in all the bloodshed and ensuing political,
social, and economic instability and chaos. Because of the deep-rooted religious and
superstitious attitude of Iranian society, the financial and moral support of the clerical
establishment, and the shortsighted and reckless policies of various governments after World
War II, the Jam‘iyat Fada’iyan Islam gained unprecedented influence.

There was no limit or bounds on the creation of religious-political groups and societies in
the capital [Tehran] or other towns. For instance, Anjuman Tablighat Islami [the Society for
Islamic Propagation] was formed in 1942 by ‘Atau’llah Shahabpur and through the assistance
of the Ministry of Education gained widespread support. The formation of the Ittihadih
Muslimin [the Union of Muslims] by Haji Mihdi Saraj-Ansari and of the Jam‘ih Ta‘limat
Islami [the Society for Islamic Teachings] by ‘Abbas-‘Ali Islami, both of which had formed
branches throughout Iran, were other notable examples of the all-encompassing efforts of
the mullas to participate in the Cold War and involve themselves in the government’s affairs
and leadership. Ayatu’llah Siyyid Hasan Chahrsuqi revived the Hay’at ‘Illmiyih Isfahan [the
Scientific League of Isfahan], which had been forgotten and disbanded for many years.

In Shiraz, where the Babi movement began, Hizb Bardaran [the Brothers Party],
otherwise known as Hizb Nur [the Light Party], was formed by a resolute enemy of the
Baha’is, of Kasravi’s ideas, and of the Tudeh Party, namely, Ayatu’llah Siyyid Nuri’d-Din
Shirazi, who collaborated with Ayatu’llah Baha’u’d-Din Mahallati in this work. Ayatu’llah
Siyyid Nuri’d-Din Shirazi became so aggressive in pursuit of his objectives that when the
Shah was visiting Shiraz and making a pilgrimage to Shah-Chiraq, he issued a fatwa [religious
ruling] for the destruction of the home of Siyyid-i Bab, which for the Babis, and particularly
for the Baha’is, was a sacred and historic site. He himself placed a chair in front of this
spectacle and observed the attack on the house of the Bab. This incident caused a great
uproar in Shiraz and brought about unrest in the city. Since it was feared that it would result
in a massacre of the Baha’is, martial law was imposed over the city to ensure calm and
order.20 Initiating a new tactic, the mullas eventually formed Nihzat Khuda-Parastan Sucialist

20   Ja‘farian, Jaryanha va Sazmanhayi Mazhabi-Siyasi Iran (1941–1979), p. 23. (BC)

[the Movement of God-Worshipping Socialists], which was a mixture of Islamic and socialist
ideas and concepts.

These are but a few minor examples of a long list of extremist Islamic groups formed to
agitate against the Tudeh Party, the Baha’i community, and every form of progressive and
modern thought in Iran. A large number of daily newspapers, monthlies, or quarterlies, with
either a prefix or suffix of “Islam,” were established in these same years and were published
with the financial and moral support of the government and the clerical apparatus.

It is noteworthy that the foundation of all these moneymaking enterprises with the cover
of religion was to combat the Tudeh Party and “in particular to prevent the spread of the
activities of the Baha’is and other corrupt social groups.” Openly and overtly, they spoke of
the suppression of the Baha’is, and even of their planned massacre in Iran. In their
publications, they repeatedly called people to support these objectives, and the unlettered
people were provoked and instigated by them. Moreover, government officials who
outwardly appeared constitutionalist, directly or indirectly, openly or covertly, backed their
extremist deeds and words.

It is astonishing that whenever the clerics were not able to achieve their immediate goals
or wishes cloaked in Islamic piety—though in truth they were thoroughly misanthropic—
they would criticize Muhammad-Reza Shah or political figures by accusing them of not
following the constitutional law of the land. Whereas, based on documents published by the
Islamic Republic itself, it is clear that it was the clerics themselves who exerted constant
pressure to that effect on the Shah or government apparatus, even urging and encouraging
them to disregard the constitution or overlook it altogether.

The politics of the Cold War, which led to Europe’s and America’s supporting clerics
against every form of ideas that were not reactionary, made religious and tribal minorities, as
well as leftist and nationalist parties, persistent targets of abuse, harassment, and persecution
in all Muslim countries, particularly in Iran. The instigators of these constant mistreatments
were those who made their living from religion or who were politicians set on deceiving the
public. This dark period was a propitious time for Shi‘i clerics to redefine the theory
underlying their medieval ideas and to strengthen their own position with an eye to
profiteering.

The notion of the vilayat faqih [the guardianship of jurists] is an ill-conceived effort by
some mullas to present the teachings of an Arab religion as logical and modern. Moreover,
Islamic government is a dream leftover from the age of ignorance, by men whose thoughts
are rooted in a medieval era. It is a reflection of Cold War policies, fostering unwise and
injudicious conspiracies that were far from any farsighted policies envisioned by the
government, political leaders, and intellectuals of Iran.

One of the imprudent decisions of that time can be mentioned as an example. Due to
enormous pressure from the clerical establishment, Siyyid Husayn Imami, the murderer of
[Ahmad] Kasravi, was released without suffering any consequences for his act and in fact
was loudly greeted by a large welcoming party. Soon after that, on November 4, 1949, he
assassinated the Court Minister [‘Abdu’l-Husayn] Hazhir.21 Grand Ayatu’llahs Kashani,

21 Hazhir (1899–1949) served as minister on ten occasions and eventually served as the prime minister from

June 13, 1948 to November 9, 1949. He was then appointed as the court minister, when he was assassinated as
the consequence of a false accusation that he was a Baha’i.

Bihbahani, and others spread a report among the ignorant masses that “Hazhir was a
Baha’i!”22

A month after the assassination of Hazhir, during the administration of Prime Minister
Muhammad Sa‘id Maraghih’i, the murders in Abarqu and the brutal killing of Dr. Sulayman
Berjis, a well-regarded and deeply caring physician, took place February 3, 1950.23
Muhammad Sa‘id Maraghih’i was the son of Mulla Shaykh Ahmad Qazizadih. He was
appointed the prime minister twice, was the foreign minister eight times, the interior minister
once, and for many years was a member of the parliament, an ambassador, or a minister-at-
large. When Hazhir had been prime minister for only a few months, Muhammad Sa‘id was
appointed in his place. During his ill-fated administration, which also lasted only a few
months, Sa‘id resigned three times; eventually ‘Ali Mansur, who was a weak old man without
the strength to walk and who was renowned for corruption, was appointed prime minister.
He started office March 23, 1950, and on June 26th, that is, after three months—he resigned.

Lieutenant-General Haji ‘Ali Razmara was then appointed as prime minister of Iran.

Regarding the latter’s personality and manners, Dr. Baqir ‘Aqili has offered the most concise
and complete opinion:

> Razmara was a clever, hard working, serious and ambitious man.… To achieve his
> objectives, he would demonstrate great bravery and constancy. He had no regard for
> his agreements or treaties, and would sacrifice everything in order to achieve his
> end. He was able to use every incident to his own benefit.24

Razmara’s progress and advancement, whether in the military or political arena, was always
based on secret agreements and conniving. When he was 44-years-old, during the
premiership of Sadru’l-Ashraf and the military command of Major-General Arfa‘, Razmara
was forced into [early retirement and] staying at home. After Sadru’l-Ashraf, the Qavamu’s-
Saltanih became prime minister in January 1946. Immediately, Razmara was returned to
military service by the leaders of the Tudeh Party and by Muzfar Firuz, who was accounted
an enemy of the Shah. His return was based on a widespread rumor that he had close
connections with the Soviet Union. Eventually, after a series of connivances, tricks, and
schemes, and through betrayal by the Qavam and others, he became prime minister.

22 See Mohajir, “Kard-Ajin Kardan Doctor Berjis.”
24 ‘Aqili, Sharh Hal Rijal Siyasi va Nizami Mu‘asir Iran, vol. 2, pp. 714–20. Haji ‘Ali-Razmara should not be

confused with Brigadier-General Husayn-‘Ali Razmara, who was a learned man and who created devices such
as a Qiblih-locator and compass for the blind, which often are erroneously attributed to Lieutenant-General
Razmara. (BC)

Lieutenant-General Haji ‘Ali Razmara

Two significant incidents marked Razmara’s premiership. First, through trustworthy
officers, he arranged for ten leaders of the Tudeh Party who had been incarcerated in Qasr
Prison to escape. Through this deed, he endeared himself to the leadership of the Soviet
Union. Second, through his opposition to the nationalization of the petroleum industry, he
won the deep gratitude of English imperialism. It should be noted that the Tudeh Party was
among the staunchest supporters of Razmara during his tenure as prime minister.

We should ask, Was the news of the coup d’état against the Shah and Iran’s
constitutional regime of that time the only rumor spread by enemies of the state? With plans
for a coup d’état, Razmara was planning a bloody calamity. It should be a cause of much joy
that he did not succeed. In fact, I am convinced that he was planning a military coup and the
establishment of a military dictatorship in Iran.

Chapter 1
The Crime

Historical Background
On Tuesday, January 3, 1950, a heinous crime took place in the village of Robat, two
kilometers from Abarqu. What happened in that village was that during the night, in the
most brutal manner, Sughra, an ill-fated mother [age 50], and her three daughters, ages 15,
11, and 8, and her two sons, ages 14 and 6, were murdered.25

To this day, sixty years later, the perpetrators of this murderous tragedy have not been
brought to justice. The inheritors of such crimes and inhuman activities, after having
established the “Government of God” in Iran, are seated upon the throne of authority, and
in their revolutionary accounts recall these crimes in different ways and shamelessly confess
their pride and satisfaction in having committed these deeds.26

Motive for the Murders
Muhammad-Hasan Khan Salari, a well-known landlord in Abarqu, suddenly died while still
relatively young. After his death, his widow, Maryam Salari, a beautiful and charming
woman, was left with a vast estate and great wealth. With the death of her father, she
inherited more land and affluence, but she was alone. To earn a living for her family, who
were without a provider, Sughra became Maryam Salari’s maid.27

Even though he was already married and had children, Isfandiyar Khan Salari, a brother
of Muhammad-Hasan Khan, yearned after his brother’s beautiful and rich widow, who also
happened to be his paternal cousin. He decided to marry Maryam. But she refused the
greedy and insistent suitor, and did not heed the repeated marriage proposals and many
efforts of her cousin, Isfandiyar Khan.

The reason that Maryam Salari was disinclined toward her cousin was due to Hujjatu’l-
Islam Siyyid Muhammad Qayyumi. Sughra—Maryam’s maid—was the neighbor of the
Siyyid, who was a rawdih-khan [a teller of the story of the martyrdom of the Imam Husayn] in
Abarqu, and Sughra was the intermediary between him and Maryam. It was rumored in
Abarqu that at times Maryam and the preacher Siyyid, who was a tall, well-proportioned, and
handsome young man, would secretly meet in Sughra’s modest home to engage in merry-
making and smoking opium in the courtyard by the pool. In such a romantic atmosphere,
the Siyyid would discard all self-restraint, and with his warm, charming, and pleasant voice,
which until then had not found an opportunity to express its full range except in rawdih-
khanis, he would whisper tender melodies and would sing passionately in his intoxicated
state.

The curiosity of the Robat villagers was so aroused that quietly and secretly they would
go over the connected roofs. From the rooftops of Sughra’s neighbors, they witnessed the
courtship of the widow of the Khan and Hujjatu’l-Islam Siyyid Muhammad Qayyumi, who
26 One instance is Kayhan newspaper, January 25, 2006. In this issue, Kayhan published an article on the Abarqu
incident filled with libelous lies and slanders.
27 Sughra’s husband and family provider, Rida, had died some time earlier.

was a resident of Abarqu. This love story and the tale of their exploits were on all tongues in
the town of Abarqu. Those who have lived in small towns understand well that deeds,
sayings, and even the thoughts of every resident are well known to neighbors and are the
currency of the town—this is a characteristic of all small communities in Iran and other
places.

There is no doubt that the report of these nightly merry-making and romantic activities
by Sughra’s pool had reached the ears of the disappointed and thwarted Isfandiyar Khan
Salari, and had caused him further anxiety and agitation. On several occasions, he had
threatened to kill Hujjatu’l-Islam Siyyid Muhammad Qayyumi and Sughra. From what can be
learned from the pages of the investigation and judicial files related to the murders in
Abarqu, Qayyumi had several times taken his complaint to the police in Abarqu and Yazd,
stating that if one day he or Sughra came to harm, then the instigator and responsible person
was none other than Isfandiyar Khan Salari.

Eventually, Maryam Salari consented to marriage with Hujjatu’l-Islam Siyyid Muhammad
Qayyumi, who also already had a wife and children. Because Maryam’s family opposed this
marriage, and the couple feared Isfandiyar Khan Salari, a large landowner and influential
citizen of Abarqu, the couple secretly drove in Maryam’s automobile to Eqlid, which is
located twenty-four kilometers from Abadeh.28 It was in Eqlid where they recorded their
marriage at the town registry.

Abarqu in relation to Abadeh, Yazd, and Eqlid

28 Abarqu is 218 kilometers from Yazd and 120 kilometers from Dehbid. It is also 72 kilometers from Abadeh.

Abarqu has approximately 20,000 inhabitants. Eqlid is on the way to Abadeh from Abarqu and is 24 kilometers
from Abadeh. (BC)

The news of the marriage of Maryam Salari and the Hujjatu’l-Islam Siyyid Muhammad
Qayyumi went through Abarqu like a whirlwind and reached the ears of Isfandiyar Khan
Salari. From this moment, plans were hatched to avenge this union by taking the life of the
ill-fated Sughra and her children, and to conspire to ascribe these murders to the Baha’is of
Shiraz, Abadeh, Yazd, and regions around Abarqu, which naturally would lead to the
persecution of Baha’is all across Iran. The demonic impulse of religious prejudice and anti-
Baha’ism that resides at the core of Iranian society became a vital and powerful
underpinning and foundation for implementation of this evil and bloody scheme—a pattern
and mindset that lives to this very day in a most reprehensible form in Iran.

Initial Investigation
On the same day, January 3, 1950, the report of the murder of Sughra and her children
reached the police chief in Abarqu, Sergeant-Major Husayn Sadripur. While examining the
crime scene and the remains of the slain, Sergeant-Major Sadripur observed that the
murderer or murderers had not brought a weapon of any kind, but instead had used a shovel
and hammer on the victims’ faces, particularly on the mouth, to kill Sughra and her children.
In pursuing his investigation and the preliminary questioning, Sadripur learned that
instruments used in the killings actually belonged to Sughra and still remained in the corner
of the house, covered with bloodstains.

Sergeant-Major Sadripur concluded with near certainty the reason that the entire
household had been slain was that during their struggles the victims had probably cried and
called out for help, and knew the identity of the killer(s). In order not to be identified and
arrested, the murderer or murderers resorted to killing the entire household, then with
blood-soaked hands had searched through Sughra’s meager furnishings and wrapped
clothing, and had escaped during the dark of the night.

It can be learned through the pages of the crime file that after the initial investigation,
Sergeant-Major Sadripur immediately arrested three individuals: ‘Ali, who was Sughra’s son-
in-law and the husband of Ruqiyih, Sughra’s sole surviving daughter; Ja‘far [‘Ali’s father]; and
his brother, Ramadan. They had been at Sughra’s home well into the night of the incident,
but, when questioned by Sadripur, had offered contradictory accounts. Also, since the crime
had taken place at night and the instruments of the killings were found inside the house, it
stood to reason that the three of them had committed these murders.

It is noteworthy that after the news of the killings was disseminated and ‘Ali, Ja‘far, and
Ramadan were arrested in Abarqu, Isfandiyar Khan Salari had fallen under greater suspicion
for having instigated Sughra’s murder. Generally, the inhabitants of Abarqu considered him
to be the true perpetrator of this incident.

Dad newspaper in Tehran published by Abu’l-Hasan ‘Amidi-Nuri, who later was one of
the ten tort lawyers representing Ruqiyih, the sole survivor of Sughra, reported the following
under the heading, “Heinous Crime in Abarqu”:

> In Abarqu, a woman and her four [sic] children were murdered in a heart-wrenching
> and brutal manner. The perpetrators of this crime were arrested through the efforts
of Baniadam, the Governor of Yazd.

It became known during the course of the investigation that the murderers were
> her son-in-law and his father, who committed this crime through the incitement and
> instigation of several brothers who are residents of Abarqu [i.e., the Salari brothers],
> who bore enmity towards the aforesaid woman.

From what has been learned, the brother of one of the instigators had passed
> away. He had an attractive wife and was very wealthy. One of his brothers
> [Isfandiyar Khan Salari] had wanted to wed the widow. The murdered woman
> [Sughra] had been instrumental in the marriage of this beautiful woman with a
> resident of Abarqu [namely, Hujjatu’l-Islam Siyyid Muhammad Qayyumi].

At this time, that is, on January 3, immediately after the remains were discovered,
interrogations were conducted by Abarqu’s chief of police, Sergeant-Major Husayn Sadripur,
his official file was prepared, and details were reported in Yazd and Tehran newspapers,
where no allegation of the involvement of Baha’is in the murder of Sughra and her
unfortunate five children was made. However, the scheme to involve and ascribe this bloody
tragedy to Baha’is was already in motion.

Following his customary practice, and uninformed of the events during the preceding
night, a Siyyid, shortly after the murder of Sughra and her children, went by the brook near
his house to perform his ablutions at dawn on January 3, 1950. According to the remaining
pages of the police file from that time, that Siyyid, known as Siyyid Sabbagh, reported the
following to Sergeant-Major Sadripur:

> Very early at dawn, when the light had begun to break, I went by the brook near my
> house to perform my ablutions. Suddenly, I saw Isfandiyar Khan [Salari] coming out
> of his house, looking worried and in a hurry, and appearing to be leaving on a
> journey [out of town]. I stood up and greeted him. Isfandiyar Khan said, “Last
> night, Muhammad Shirvani, who is Sughra’s neighbor, along with his son and
> brother, Muhammad [-Hasan] Niku’i, has slain Sughra and her hapless children, and
> has escaped.”

According to this testimony, Siyyid Sabbagh—a devoted Muslim resident of Abarqu—
shortly after the murders in their town, had seen Isfandiyar Khan Salari “looking worried
and in a hurry,” who had then spoken the names of the supposed perpetrators. Since the
murders had taken place during the night, and according to various testimonies, Ruqiyih’s
husband ‘Ali; his father, Ja‘far; and his brother, Ramadan, had been in the home of Sughra
into the night, and at a time when no one knew of this heinous incident (even the prayer-
offering, early-rising Siyyid Sabbagh was unaware of the occurrence) we note that Isfandiyar
Khan Salari, “looking worried and in a hurry,” appeared to be on his way on a journey and
that he knew the names of the supposed offenders.

• Siyyid Sabbagh was the first person who heard Isfandiyar Khan Salari state, “Muhammad

> Shirvani, who is Sughra’s neighbor, along with his son and brother, Muhammad Niku’i”
> had “committed this crime” and had taken their flight. Therefore, a conspiracy to
> commit the murders and ascribe them to guiltless men, instead of to the actual
> perpetrator[s], was laid in advance.

• Most likely, Isfandiyar Khan Salari was not only the instigator of this incident but also the

> main character involved in the murders, and his partners in crime were ‘Ali, Ja‘far, and
> Ramadan. During the night, after killing Sughra and her children, Isfandiyar Khan had
> returned home to destroy his bloodstained clothing. He had quickly left his residence,
> when “looking worried and in a hurry,” he had unfortunately run across Siyyid Sabbagh
> and thereafter had commenced a journey to Yazd.

• Perhaps the reason that the murderer or murderers searched through Sughra’s meager

> furnishings was in the hope of finding documents or other items entrusted to Sughra
> and belonging to Maryam or Hujjatu’l-Islam Siyyid Muhammad Qayyumi. It appears that
> Maryam thought that her paternal cousins, that is, the Salaris, planned to rob her.

• Also, it can be supposed that searching through Sughra’s furnishings with bloody hands

> was a ruse by the perpetrators to pretend that the real motive for the murders was
> robbery. Since Sughra was employed as a maid by Maryam Salari, clearly she did not own
> valuable things, so this deception likely was authored by Isfandiyar Khan Salari.

Role of Yazd’s Judiciary Surrounding the Murders in Abarqu
Reports of these murders were conveyed to Yazd’s judiciary. Siyyid Muhammad Jalali-Na’ini,
the town’s prosecutor, instructed Javad Sadiqi, the town’s investigator, to gather all the
information pertaining to this case. That very day, Sadiqi left Yazd for Abarqu in the
company of Yazd’s police chief.

However, en route, he changed direction, and instead of proceeding to Abarqu he went
to Mehriz, where he stayed two nights and a day. The purpose of this detour was for him to
consult and confer with Sergeant-Major Khakpur Faraghih’i, the police chief in Mehriz, and
a devotee and confidant of Isfandiyar Khan Salari. They wanted to make plans for Isfandiyar
Khan and others who had committed this crime to escape punishment and legal pursuit, and
instead for the blame to be placed on the shoulders of innocent others. This group arrived in
Abarqu on January 5th; it soon became clear during this interval in Mehriz what an evil
scenario was being conceived.

The two men, namely, Javad Sadiqi, who was Yazd’s investigator, and Yazd’s chief of
police, who was also Sergeant-Major Khakpur’s chief, arrived in Abarqu. The police chief
immediately dismissed Sergeant-Major Sadripur from any further investigation—Sadripur
being the person who had conducted the initial investigation, who had issued the arrest
notices for the primary suspects ‘Ali, Ja‘far, and Ramadan, and who had caused “worry” and
“hurriedness” in Isfandiyar Khan Salari.

In place of Sadripur, Sergeant-Major Khakpur (the police chief of Mehriz and an intimate
of Isfandiyar Khan) was appointed. At once, he released the three imprisoned men without
any investigation or even securing sureties. In their place, he immediately arrested and
imprisoned Muhammad Shirvani, a Muslim neighbor of Sughra, and his 17-year-old son
named ‘Ali-Muhammad, and Muhammad-Husayn Niku’i. Moreover, he destroyed all
evidence and police files associated with the previous suspects and left no trace of their
involvement in official records.

Unlike the initial investigation by Abarqu’s police chief, Sergeant-Major Sadripur (who
considered the motive for this crime to be revenge and enmity by Isfandiyar Khan Salari
towards Hujjatu’l-Islam Siyyid Muhammad Qayyumi), the direction of the inquiry completely
changed at the behest of Javad Sadiqi and his accomplice, Sergeant-Major Khakpur, who
now maintained that the motive was religious differences between the Baha’is and Muslims.

At this point it is critical to note that on the strength of Sergeant Sadripur’s report and
that of Abarqu’s mayor, Baniadam, the governor of Yazd, informed Tehran of the motives
for these murders and had given this information to such local and national newspapers as
Bakhtar Imruz, and Dad—the latter was cited earlier in this monograph. In addition, the
inhabitants of Abarqu knew that the entire population of Abarqu, without exception, was
Muslim, and that not even one single Baha’i lived among them. This was because several

years earlier they had killed three Baha’is in extremely brutal ways, and ever since no Baha’i
dared live in Abarqu. How could they then ascribe this crime to the Baha’is?

After dismissing Sergeant Sadripur and installing in his place an officer who was in the
pocket of the conspirators, Javad Sadiqi and Yazd’s chief of police then returned to Yazd.
They had connived with Isfandiyar Khan Salari and designed a plan to entrap Baha’is in this
incident and attribute the murders to them. They entrusted Sergeant-Major Khakpur with
implementing the steps that remained to complete the police crime file.

From their initial inquiries, Officer Khakpur knew that Muhammad [-Hasan] Niku’i had
a brother named Ahmad who was Baha’i. It was common in Iran that many families could
be found in which some members were Baha’i and the rest Muslim. The Niku’i family was
one such family.

Even though Ahmad Niku’i lived long ways from Abarqu, this was not important to the
conspirators. Officer Khakpur announced that on the night of the incident, Muhammad-
Husayn Niku’i had taken the stolen property from the home of the deceased to the home of
his Baha’i brother, Ahmad Niku’i, in Dehbid, and had returned that very night to Abarqu.
The fact that he did not own an automobile, nor did he possess any other means of making a
journey of 300 kilometers that night in one direction, then turn around and be in Abarqu
again by early morning, never mattered. What was important was that the name of a Baha’i
had at last entered the arena.

However, Isfandiyar Khan, who continued in all minds as the suspected perpetrator of
this crime, but who had no legal responsibility or standing in this investigation, left behind
his home and work, and went to Dehbid, where he searched the meager residence of Ahmad
Niku’i. From there, he traced the footsteps of Ahmad Niku’i and went to Qeshlaq. But
learning that Ahmad Niku’i was in Shiraz, and not having found anything in his house,
Isfandiyar Khan proceeded forthwith to Shiraz to arrest Niku’i.

However, Ahmad Niku’i was in Shiraz on the night of the murders; moreover, for a week
preceding the murders he had been engaged in selling goods in the streets there. The
doorkeeper of the caravansary where he lived and other travelers testified to his
uninterrupted stay in Shiraz.

When Isfandiyar Khan was unable to secure a warrant for the arrest of Ahmad Niku’i
from Captain Thurayya, the chief at police station no. 3 in Shiraz, he hastened to Yazd,
where he was able to secure a warrant from his comrade Javad Sadiqi. He returned to Shiraz,
arrested Ahmad Niku’i, took him to Abarqu, and placed him under the charge of Khakpur.
The latter sent Niku’i to Yazd to be incarcerated.

Motives for Murders from the Schemers’ Perspective
Two major obstacles remained in the path of the schemers. First, no Baha’i resided in
Abarqu; second, they did not know what to present as a motive for the murders—though by
itself this was not a difficult task in the past or the present for those who were scheming
against the Baha’is.

To solve the first problem, Sergeant-Major Khakpur initially attempted to subject
Muhammad Shirvani—a Muslim and one of the prisoners—to the most brutal torture in
hope that he would “confess” to being a Baha’i and to having committed the murders.
However, Shirvani, a Muslim, was determined and steadfast in his convictions.

Failing this, Khakpur attempted a different approach. He placed ‘Ali-Muhammad, the 17-
year-old son of Shirvani, under severe torture. At first, they hung the young and innocent

youth from the ceiling of the prison, but that proved fruitless. Then they flogged him; that
too proved unproductive. They branded him with a hot iron, but the young Muslim endured
that as well. At last, they stripped him of all his clothing and in the depth of winter put him
outside on ice. The 17-year-old youth was unable to endure such intense, sustained torture
and confessed to whatever Sergeant Khakpur wanted him to say, namely, that the three
Baha’is of Isfandabad had come to Abarqu during the night and, together with his father
[Muhammad Shirvani], had slain Sughra and her children.

The motive for the murder that they concocted was: Whenever Hujjatu’l-Islam Siyyid
Muhammad Qayyumi recited rawdih in Abarqu and insulted Baha’is, Sughra, who was among
the attendees, would also curse and slur Baha’is. It is interesting to note that after consulting
and reconciling with Isfandiyar Khan, Siyyid Muhammad Qayyumi’s fanatical Muslim
proclivities were provoked, so that he enrolled among the companions of Isfandiyar Khan
and testified to the truth of what was claimed about Sughra.

Sergeant-Major Khakpur quickly went to Isfandabad, arrested the three Baha’is of that
village on the charge of murder, and sent them to Yazd prison. However, as bad coincidence
would have it, Muslim witnesses came forward and testified that on the night of the murders
these three individuals were in Bavanat, located many kilometers from Abarqu. When the
case investigator discovered that ascribing these murders to these three men was impossible,
he had no choice but to free them.

Meanwhile, Baniadam, the governor of Yazd, who initially had taken the path of fairness
and equity, and who had been the first to truthfully write about the incident, was dismissed
from office through the influence of Isfandiyar Khan and his accomplices in Yazd and
Tehran. Ahmad Mu‘avinzadih, the chief of judiciary in Yazd, who was completely trusted by
the conspirators, then assumed the governorship.29 In this way, all major posts came under
the control of the connivers.

Since the idea of painting the Baha’is of Isfandabad as murderers was unsuccessful, the
conspirators found a weak excuse to accuse and imprison Haji Mirza Hasan Shams, the
chairman of Isfandabad’s Baha’i Spiritual Assembly, [who had refused paying a bribe to
Khakpur]. He was sent to Yazd prison.

Gradually, the thought of implicating the Baha’is of Yazd in this crime gained currency.

Through the excuse that there had been a connection between [Haji Mirza Hasan] Shams
and the Spiritual Assembly of the Baha’is of Yazd, all nine members of Spiritual Assembly of
Yazd were summoned to the judiciary [for interrogation].30

At the end, Javad Sadiqi, Yazd’s inspector, named four individuals as having committed
the murders: Muhammad Shirvani, a Muslim; Muhammad-Husayn Niku’i; Ahmad Niku’i;
and ‘Ali-Muhammad Shirvani. He also named the following eleven as instigators and
planners of these murders: Haji Mirza Hasan Shams; ‘Abbas-‘Ali Purmihdi; and the nine
members of Spiritual Assembly of Yazd.

It is incredible that the indictment issued by Yazd’s prosecutor states that the three
Baha’is of Isfandabad had remained unidentified until that time but participated in the
murders. One has to ask: How is it possible that even though Isfandabad had so few Baha’is,
it was clear and unequivocal to the prosecutor that three of these Baha’is had participated in

29 Nikravan, “Barrasi,” states that Mu‘avinzadih and his accomplice, Lutfi, were entrenched enemies of the
Baha’is and launched a determined attack against them in the media.
30 The nine members of the Spiritual Assembly of the Baha’is of Yazd were: Badi‘u’llah Afnan, Dr. Rasti, Dr.

Malakutian, Salikian, Mishki, Muhammad-‘Ali Afnan, Ra’fati, Majzub, and Dr. Manshadi.

this crime, even though he had been unable to identify them? This question remains
unanswered to this day.

About this time, the orders for the arrest of another Baha’i by the name of Jalal Binish,
who was an ailing merchant, was issued. The charge against him was that he had written a
letter to Haji Mirza Hasan Shams in which he had advised regarding the receipt of a load of
tobacco from Abarqu. The judiciary in Yazd concluded that this was a secret message about
the occurrence of these murders; therefore, he was arrested as having been involved in the
killings. After eleven months of incarceration, having withstood enormous difficulties, Jalal
Binish passed away in prison prior to the trial [on January 2, 1952].

Kerman Prison
On the night of January 7, 1951, the arrested men were conducted to the prison in Kerman.
At this time, ‘Abdu’llah Razi, the ranking member of the Bar Association, was appointed to
defend them. From the beginning, Razi realized that the case against his clients was
fabricated and twisted so as to be consistent with the conspiracy plotted subsequent to the
incident. He also noted that many pages of the file from the early stages of the investigations
were missing.

Razi presented this information to Husayn Furughi, the head of the judiciary in Kerman,
who was also the presiding judge in [Kerman’s] High Criminal Court. The latter agreed and
added, “I too have noticed the same; for this reason, and other considerations, I have
requested that the case be transferred to Tehran’s High Criminal Court.” At any rate, it was
determined to transfer the accused to Tehran [and this took place on February 26, 1951].31

Salari Family
Undoubtedly, the curious reader would raise this question: How is it possible that an
Abarqui feudalist, through the collaboration of various authorities and high-ranking officials
in the magistrate of constitutional Iran, could create such an evil and bloody plot and never
face punishment, nor suffer consequences for his malicious doings? To gain insight into this
issue, one needs to know something about the Salari family.

The Umid-Salari family was among the most powerful and affluent landlords in Abadeh
and Abarqu. In particular, Muhammad-Rida Khan Umid-Salar, the only son of Salar-Nizam
and the son-in-law of Haji Shaykh Ahmad, who was Abadeh’s Imam-Jum‘ih, enjoyed a
special trust and following. He had been elected to the national parliament on several
occasions. He always boasted that Ahmad Shah Qajar and his entourage, which included
Sardar Sipah [the highest ranking military officer in Iran’s army], had paused in Abadeh and
had lunch at the home of his father, Salar-Nizam, and that in 1938, Reza Shah and the heir
to throne had visited his father’s home, and that in the spring of 1941, Reza Shah and his
wife, Fuziyih, and their entourage had stayed in Abadeh and had been their guests.
Eventually, this opportunist managed to secure a Taj Medal from Muhammad-Reza Shah.

Knowing this background gives us insights to the sixty-year-old question and shines a
small light on the darkness of religious and political despotism in Iran. It makes it clear why

31   The number of defendants at the trial in Tehran was eighteen, of whom fourteen were Baha’is.

such a powerful person could command the power to dismiss or install ministerial officials
and authorities in Abarqu, Shiraz, and Yazd, and to interfere in governmental affairs.

His sister, Maryam Salari, was the wife of his paternal cousin, Muhammad-Hasan Khan
Salari, who became a widow at a young age. The criminal and love-struck Isfandiyar Khan
Salari was yet another paternal cousin of this woman who had been raised in the lap of
luxury.

We do not know why the judiciary chief in Kerman, namely, Husayn Furughi had
“reasons and other concerns,” nor why he sent the case of the innocents accused of murders
in Abarqu to the magistrate in Tehran. However, with some historical awareness, we can
perhaps ascertain what “reasons and other concerns” he may have had. Let us proceed to
study the internal and external factors that influenced everything related to this crime.32

32  The present author has a nearly completed monograph in which he discusses roots of this unfortunate and
ill-fated episode. It is hoped that this book will soon be published. (BC)

Chapter 2
The Government’s Reaction

Taking the Accused to Tehran
Muhammad-‘Ali Buzari, the minister of justice in Razmara’s administration, was from
Taleqan. In his youth he had been an akhund [a junior cleric], and he had very close ties with
the clerical establishment and its leadership. More important, he had an excellent relationship
with the Fada’iyan Islam. After Hazhir’s assassination, based on recommendations from
Taleqan, Navvab Safavi, the leader of the terrorist organization Fada’iyan Islam, went into
hiding in villages around Qazvin and Taleqan. While there, he would deliver secret speeches
against the Baha’is in which he would inveigle and urge the villagers to massacre and
persecute the Baha’is of that region.

Navvab Safavi

It is astonishing that during the reign of Lieutenant-General Razmara, Baha’is were
subject to harassment throughout the entire country—many of them lost their jobs,
particularly in the Education Ministry at the instructions of Shamsu’d-Din Jazayiri, the
minister of education. The latter was a descendent of Siyyid Ni‘matu’llah Jazayiri, a
renowned akhund in the royal court of Shah Sultan-Husayn Safavi, and generation after
generation, family members ranked among the clerics. For many years, Shamsu’d-Din
Jazayiri, Iran’s education minister, was also a cleric: for this reason, he was for many years
the leader of the pilgrims going to Mecca.

At this point, it should be noted that from the time of Reza Shah until the concluding
years of the reign of Muhammad-Reza Shah, almost without exception, all ministers, and
political and cultural figures of Iran, particularly high-ranking officials of the country’s
judiciary, came from the ranks of clerics, or were sons of clerics, or were from the feudalistic
class, or numbered among the thousand families of the Qajar tribe. Anti-Baha’ism and
opposition to progressive and modern ideas among these court loyalists had a long and
deep-rooted history.

During the premiership of Razmara, an unprecedented attack on the Baha’i community
of Iran commenced, and anti-Baha’ism was evident throughout the country in a pronounced
way, which completely destroyed any serenity among this minority community. There was
nothing that could be done, although the Baha’is, as was their habit, appealed to the
authorities about this discrimination and persecution in hope of gaining a measure of human
and civil rights.

Accordingly, the National Spiritual Assembly of the Baha’is of Iran wrote several times
to Lieutenant-General Haji ‘Ali Razmara, the prime minister, and requested that he
investigate and stay the waves of persecution against Baha’is that were sweeping the country.
However, Haji ‘Ali Razmara was busy preparing for his planned coup d’état and paid no
attention to these letters by the Baha’is. It is deeply surprising that some of his ministers
considered him a fanatic and a believer in the Baha’i religion. In their proclamations against
Razmara, Fada’iyan Islam always used the slur “Baha’i Dog” after mentioning ‘Ali-Akbar
Muhtadi, the deputy prime-minister and the translator of Montesquieu’s The Spirit of Laws.

The Prisoners Sent to Tehran
Earlier, we saw that the chief of the judiciary in Kerman decided to send the file of the
Baha’i prisoners to Tehran. Now we will examine his evidence and documents.

As noted by Baqir ‘Aqili, Lieutenant-General Razmara had a tendency to “use every
incident to his own benefit.” He now decided to use the accused Baha’is who were
imprisoned in Yazd to his own benefit. For this, Razmara telephoned his minister of justice,
Muhammad-‘Ali Buzari, and urged him, “Try to make sure that the accused are killed on the
way from Yazd to Tehran: this way, we will all be freed from all the tumult, difficulties, and
the ensuing trial.”

The Baha’is became aware that Razmara entertained ill-thoughts towards the Baha’i
prisoners in Yazd. Therefore, in their third long letter to Lieutenant-General Haji ‘Ali
Razmara, after enumerating many horrific acts that had been perpetrated against the Baha’is
throughout the nation, the National Spiritual Assembly of the Baha’is of Iran wrote about
the transfer of the Baha’i prisoners in Yazd to Tehran and their deep worry over this:

> The other matter that is extremely important and should be brought to Your
> Excellency’s attention is that in accordance with legal provisions, the trial of these
> innocent men [accused of murders in Abarqu] should take place in Kerman. For this
> reason, the prisoners have been transferred to that town, and their lawyer has also
> proceeded to that region. Therefore, it is not clear for what reason the judicial
> authorities have suddenly changed their minds and referred the case to Tehran. It is
> clearly evident to the officials in charge that in Tehran there are antagonistic and
> fanatical individuals, who through the provocation and influence of certain elements
> [i.e., the Fada’iyan Islam] who caused clamor and tumult in the trial of the murderers
of Dr. Berjis, would once again array themselves and cause mischief.

All the evidence and indications—dispensing with efforts to find the true killers
> of the woman in Abarqu, the arrest of a number of innocent men who had no
> involvement in this incident whatsoever, the initial transfer of the accused to
> Kerman and then the transfer of their case to Tehran, the publication in a number
> of newspapers in Tehran and other locations of a number of inflammatory articles
> and essays all contrary to the truth and all against the Baha’i community, the
> incendiary talks by a number of preachers and priests in religious settings, the silence
> of the police authorities, and the consent of the high officials of the judiciary to the
> legal proceedings in Yazd and Kerman—all of these events have firmly convinced
> this Assembly that a well-planned and carefully orchestrated scheme, based on
> conscientiously calculated steps against the innocent Baha’is of Iran, is
> unquestionably being carried out, and self-interested individuals wish to implement
> their evil plots through these tactics….

Since this Assembly has always wished and will continue to hope that during the
> administration of that distinguished person [i.e., Haji ‘Ali Razmara], such ill-
> conceived incidents would not take place, we have submitted the above evident facts
> with utmost sincerity and cherish the expectation that your office will issue clear and
> effective instructions for the proper remedy of this discrimination and these
> difficulties.

Once again, Lieutenant-General Haji ‘Ali Ramzara paid no attention to the petition of the
Baha’i community and busily continued to implement his plan [for a coup d’état]. At any
rate, in accordance with the instructions of Razmara and his minister of justice, the accused
were put on a bus and sent to Tehran with considerable fear and trepidation. There were
persistent rumors on people’s tongues that the bus was to be attacked on the way and the
accused Baha’is harmed. Sometimes it was also said that Razmara wished to use this
assassination attempt [of the Baha’is] as a pretext to proclaim military rule and then stage a
coup d’état, all as an excuse that he was preventing an attack on the Baha’is and suppressing
tumult in various cities.

Intercession of Habib Mu’ayyad
The Baha’is attempted a different approach. Dr. Habib Mu’ayyad, who was one of the
closest friends of Razmara, was sent to see the prime minister. While Razmara was serving in
the military in Kermanshah, he had been severely ill. The only competent and skilled
physician there was a Baha’i by the name of Dr. Habib Mu’ayyad, who had been trained
overseas; he had been brought in to attend to Razmara.33 With great effort, Dr. Mu’ayyad
was able to remedy his condition; this precipitated a close friendship between the two, to the
point that Razmara would call Dr. Mu’ayyad “father,” and Dr. Mu’ayyad would call him
“son.”

In August 1941, Dr. Habib Mu’ayyad moved from Kermanshah to Tehran, where he
reestablished his residence and medical practice. One of his patients was Razmara. Dr.
Mu’ayyad was a member of the National Spiritual Assembly, and that body asked him to
meet with Razmara.

For this reason, Habib Mu’ayyad went to see his “son,” Haji ‘Ali Razmara, who was a
lieutenant-general and the prime minister of Iran, and recounted for him the story of the
wretched Baha’is of Yazd from the beginning. The prime minister not only disregarded the
supplication and justice-seeking of the “father,” he was further provoked and refused to
issue instructions for a fair investigation of the situation of the accused. With a face betraying
his deep ambitions, at once he asked Dr. Habib Mu’ayyad, “Father, do you foresee that I
would attain my objectives?” Dr. Mu’ayyad responded, “Son, I am not aware of your inner
thoughts and aspirations. But, I will fatherly counsel you to see that Almighty God beholds
all your deeds under all conditions, and to act with equity. Do not build the foundation of
your government on the blood of innocents.”

With a heart full of sadness and hopelessness, Dr. Mu’ayyad left the office of the premier
and reported the details of the meeting to the National Spiritual Assembly of the Baha’is of
Iran. At this time, on the instructions of their institutions, the Baha’is of Iran commenced
prayer vigils, as they had no other recourse but patience and perseverance. The mullas’

unceasing propaganda that suggests the Baha’is enjoyed the support of Muhammad-Reza
Shah and his government was so frivolous and comical that it cannot be accepted by rational
thinkers.

Change of Government
Irony and the mystery of history intersected at this moment. Razmara was assassinated by
Khalil Tahmassbi, a member of the terrorist organization Fada’iyan Islam, which harbored
great enmity and hatred towards the Baha’is.34 In contrast, the bus bringing the innocents
accused of the murders in Abarqu arrived in Tehran with no notable incident as had been
feared. But this was not the end of the events.

In recent times, much has been written and published about Razmara’s assassination by
Fada’iyan Islam. At any rate, we know that this assassination took place with the knowledge,
and likely the previous consent of some of the leadership of the Jibhe Milli [the National
Front].35 The Kremlin was saddened by General Razmara’s murder and issued a strongly
worded and harsh statement against the United States and England.

In 1952, when the National Front had reached the apex of its power in parliament, a
number of parliamentarians who were members of that party drafted a resolution, which was
passed by the national parliament and according to which Khalil Tahmassbi was freed from
prison. This resolution had only one article:

> Since the treason of Haji ‘Ali Razmara and his support by the foreign powers is
> evident to the people of Iran, even if his murderer is Ustad Khalil Tahmassbi, he is
> recognized as innocent by the people, and is hereby acquitted.

“With the passing of this parliamentary motion and its approval by [Muhammad-Reza] Shah,
Razmara’s family registered its protest by writing a letter to the Shah, stating, ‘How is he
considered mahduru’d-dam36 when his family was granted posthumously the Javidan Medal
[eternal medal], and he was accounted as one of the martyrs of the military?’”37

Since there are individuals who, with good reason, wish to know the identity of those
who participated in passing a parliamentary resolution to free Khalil Tahmassbi, the names
of these twenty-seven members of parliament are recorded here: Shams Qannatabadi, who
was an akhund, disciple of Ayatu’llah Kashani and a member of the Fada’iyan Islam; Nad-‘Ali
Karimi; Haji Siyyid Javadi; Engineer Hasibi; Dr. Shaygan; Siyyid Baqir Jalali; Angaji, Dr.
Baqa’i; ‘Ali Zahri; Husayn Makki; Engineer Zirakzadih; Dr. Malaki; Parsa; Muddaris; Dr.
Falsafi; Nazirzadih; Ha’irizadih; Iqbal; [Siyyid Hashim] Vakil; Purakhgar; Milani; Shapuri;
Farzanih Mu‘tammid; Damavandi; Nasir Dhulfaqari; Dr. Sanjabi; and Nariman.38

The drafting and passing of the resolution to free Khalil Tahmassbi, Razmara’s murderer,
which fundamentally was against all principles of the constitutional law and the criminal and
penal code of the country, took place during the premiership of Dr. Muhammad Musaddiq.

34 This assassination took place March 7, 1951.

Dr. Musaddiq was a politician, not a holy man. What impelled parliament to take up this
resolution is an important discussion that must be explored dispassionately but which must
be relegated to another occasion, as it is unrelated to the current study. That research is
being written in detail by the present author in another monograph.

The Murder of Nuri’d-Din Fatha‘zam by Fada’iyan Islam
I am compelled at this juncture to discuss a crime that took place during the premiership of
Dr. Muhammad Musaddiq—Iran’s national hero and the unconditional defender of
constitutional law. This incident took place after the August 7, 1952 passage of the law
freeing Khalil Tahmassbi, the renowned terrorist of the Fada’iyan Islam, but before he was
freed from incarceration on November 15, 1952. I am of the belief that Dr. Musaddiq and
his interior minister, Dr. Ghulam-Husayn Sadiqi, did not have a hand in this horrific crime.
However, individuals, such as Ayatu’llah Kashani, Jamal Imami, and Dr. Baqa’i, who were
from a faction of the National Front, had close relations with the organization of the
Fada’iyan Islam.

We know that after the assassination of Court Minister Hizhar on November 4, 1949,
and the immediate execution of his assassin, Siyyid Husayn Imami, on November 8, 1949,
Siyyid Mujtaba Navvab Safavi, the leader of the Fada’iyan Islam, at once escaped to the
villages around Qazvin and Taleqan with the help of Ayatu’llah Taleqani and other citizens
of Taleqan, and hid in that region. During this time, he delivered speeches against the
government of Prime Minister Sa‘id; he was also provoking a few Muslim families against the
Baha’is. These activities continued; eventually during Dr. Musaddiq’s government, Nuri’d-
Din Fatha‘zam, a Baha’i landlord in the village of Ramjin, near Qazvin, was brutally killed at
night by the Fada’iyan Islam using shovels, pickaxes, and knives. It is astonishing to note that
the police officer who witnessed the villagers’ attack on Fatha‘zam ran away and left the
victim alone with his assailants.

Nuri’d-Din Fatha‘zam was a humanitarian; at his own expense, he had built a bathhouse
for the villagers. More importantly, he had also built a mosque at his own expense so that his
Muslim farmers would have no difficulty in offering their obligatory prayers or attending
religious ceremonies. All of these good deeds did not prevent the occurrence of this crime;
the ignorant population gave in to the prejudice and deception of the Fada’iyan Islam.

On May 16th, a few months before the coup d’état of August 19, 1953, the trial of those
accused of the murder of Nuri’d-Din Fatha‘zam took place in Tehran. The agent of the
Intelligence Office shared with the country’s police headquarters a confidential report of the
court proceedings, which is instructive:

> With respect, this is submitted. Supplement to reports of special agents Qasim and
> Taqi Samavarsaz, the activities of the Fada’iyan Islam on Saturday, May 16, 1953,
and Sunday, May 17, were as follows:

At 9 A.M. on May 16, about 20 members of the Fada’iyan Islam under the
> leadership of Aqa Siyyid Hashim Husayni arrived at the Court for Misdemeanors
> and the trial of 17 farmers in the village of Ramjin accused of participating in the
> murder of the late Fatha‘zam commenced. Dr. Pad was appointed by the members
> of Fada’iyan Islam to defend the accused, and commenced his arguments. As a
> result, the 17 defendants were completely acquitted of all charges and immediately
> freed.

Members of Fada’iyan Islam sacrificed six sheep in front of the prison of the
> judiciary building when the former defendants were leaving. Special agents explained
> that Siyyid ‘Abdu’l-Husayn Vahidi [the number two man in the Fada’iyan Islam
> organization] had raised a sum of 400,000 rials in the bazaar in the name of the 17
> freed farmers, stating that they had killed a Baha’i. Of this sum, 60,000 rials were
> given to Dr. Pad as his remuneration. Fada’iyan Islam even threatened the family of
> the late Fatha‘zam who had gathered outside [the courthouse].39

This report is long; I have only cited its opening paragraphs and not included the remaining
portion, which states that during the following night, 500 members of Fada’iyan Islam
gathered at Gumruk Square, with Navvab Safavi presiding. That evening until midnight,
food and drinks were served at the home of Haji Yusufian-Muqaddam to celebrate this
mighty victory.

Husayn ‘Ala was appointed to the office of prime minister after Razmara’s assassination.

On March 15, 1951, representatives of the National Front submitted to the full parliament
the draft law for the nationalization of the petroleum industry, and the law was passed
unanimously. To celebrate this, great festivities were held in Tehran and other cities, and
everyone was most joyful.

Protests fomented by Ayatu’llah Siyyid Abu’l-Qasim Kashani, the leader of the terrorist
organization Fada’iyan Islam, increased, and resulted two months later in Prime Minister
‘Ala’s resignation from office and his assumption of the post of court minister.

It was during these days that the book, Rahnama-yi Haqayiq [Guide to the Truth], which is
the manifesto of Fada’iyan Islam, was published in large numbers. How this book was
published and who paid for its expenses will be told at another time, as it is one of the
untold aspects of the history of modern Iran.

Chapter 3
The American Baha’is

Premiership of Dr. Musaddiq
In an emergency meeting of parliament on April 28, 1951, Dr. Muhammad Musaddiq, the
leader of Iran’s National Front, came to the premiership. He was nominated by Jamal Imami
and had the support of the majority of representatives. Immediately, the two chambers of
parliament adopted a resolution that was the basis for the nationalization of the petroleum
industry throughout the country and sent the resolution to the administration for
implementation.

On another occasion, we must pursue the story of various schemes and conspiracies of
those days, since we know that Dr. Musaddiq, the champion of the National Front, did not
have a restful moment. Every single day was busy dealing with various tricks and
connivances by internal and external enemies.

Eventually, on October 7, 1951, he led a delegation of government officials on a mission
to defend the rights of the people of Iran before the Security Council of the United Nations.
The delegation that accompanied Dr. Musaddiq consisted of: Senator Matindaftar; Senator
Bayat; Allahyar Salih; Dr. Shaygan; Dr. Karim Sanjabi; Dr. Muzaffar Baqa’i; Dr. Husayn
Fatimi; Dr. ‘Isa Sipahbudi (interpreter); Javad Bushihri; Husayn Navvab; Muhsin Asadi
(interpreter); ‘Abbas Mus‘udi, the chief-editor of Ittila‘at newspaper; Senator Dr.
Misbahzadih, the editor of Kayhan newspaper and a member of parliament; Shujau’d-Din
Shafa, the chief spokesperson; and Dr. Ghulam-Husayn Musaddiq and Zia-Ashraf
Musaddiq, who were Dr. Musaddiq’s two sons.

On October 11, 1951, Dr. Musaddiq delivered an enthusiastic speech to the Security
Council of the United Nations and defended the decision to nationalize Iran’s oil industry;
he also spoke of many cruelties of the imperialist British government. That historic day will
never be dimmed in the memory of the people of Iran.

The next day, after having sought the permission of Dr. Muhammad Musaddiq,
representatives of the National Spiritual Assembly of the Baha’is of the United States (an
elected governing council of the Baha’is of America) came to meet the prime minister where
he was staying, so they could discuss the deplorable condition of the Baha'is accused in the
Abarqu murders as well as the violation of the rights and denial of justice for the Baha’is of
Iran. With a pleasant demeanor, Dr. Musaddiq received and listened to them, and it is
noteworthy that he offered sincere and prudent counsel to the Baha’i representatives.

The following is a report to the National Spiritual Assembly of the Baha’is of the United
States of this friendly meeting between representatives of the American Baha’i community
and the leader of the National Front and the prime minister of Iran—a close and
unprejudiced study of which in these days can clarify some of the efforts of Iranians both
inside and outside of the country, particularly Iran’s National Front, against the Islamic
Republic’s anti-Baha’ism.

He expressed his cordial appreciation of these sentiments and said he was very
pleased to receive us.

He showed deep interest in my remarks, and replied that in Iran, there is a better
and more cordial balance with the Baha’is than with other minorities.

40The present translator is grateful to the Archives Office of the National Spiritual Assembly of the Baha’is of
the United States for a copy of this report, which is recorded in this monograph exactly as it appears in the
original English, with the exception that “Persia” has been replaced with “Iran” (private communications,
December 2009).

these incidents on some of the religious leaders who are under the influence of
some of the political movements, particularly the Communists.

He stated that his Government has nothing against the Baha’is, and he hopes
that just as throughout the world, religion is free, the same condition will take place
in Iran; that he will personally do all he can to assist the Baha’is in his country and
will never resist an opportunity to see that justice is done. He said he hopes that
these incidents of the past will not be repeated.

I expressed deep appreciation for his cordial sentiments and told him the Baha’is
would pray for his good health. He replied that he too would pray for the success of
those who have good thoughts for the progress of Iran.

I expressed regret at not having received the souvenir from the National
Spiritual Assembly which had not yet arrived, but that I would have it delivered
upon its arrival. Meanwhile, I showed him the article that appeared in Life Magazine,
and gave him copies of the Baha’i Peace Program and Appreciations of the Baha’i
Faith. Dr. Shayegan was very much interested in the Life article, and I presented it to
him.

The spirit of the audience was one of extreme friendliness; it was entirely
unhurried, and I had full opportunity to say all that I considered necessary and
important. Dr. Melaney and I both felt that the Prime Minister was fully sincere in
his expressions. He personally accompanied us to the door upon leaving and shook
my hand very warmly on two occasions.
——————————

Early Friday evening, Dr. Melaney received a telephone call summoning him to
Dr. Mossadegh’s apartment. In the meantime, the souvenir package from the
National Assembly had arrived and I had given it to Dr. Melaney to deliver. Upon
arriving, he presented it to the Prime Minister who seemed very pleased to receive
the beautiful leather folder with the photographs of the exterior and interior of the
Temple [in Wilmette, Illinois]. Dr. Melaney also read to him the letter of the
National Assembly and the enclosed statement documenting numerous incidents of
persecutions of Baha’is of Iran.

Dr. Mossadegh informed Dr. Melaney that he knew of the imprisonment of
Baha’is of Yazd and other incidents; that General Alahi [‘Ala’i] has approached him
and reported to him that the Baha’is have not been treated justly. The Prime
Minister then said that he wants to help the Baha’is in Iran; that it would not help
him to have a letter from the National Spiritual Assembly of the United States in
which the spread and influence of the Faith are recorded, because that would be
disliked. What he needs is a formal representation in which the incidents of
persecution are documented, and a request and appeal made for help for our fellow
Baha’is in Iran who have been persecuted.

He then actually dictated the following statement which he suggested should be
inserted at the close of our formal representation: “We wonder that in a country
which has an ancient civilization and possesses constitutional laws, a group of
people is treated in a manner which conflicts with these fundamental laws. The latter
proclaim that the people are equal before law.”

He stated that this representation should be written on the letterhead of the
National Assembly, signed and sealed, so that he can use it in his efforts to help the
Iranian Baha’is.

He emphasized the extreme importance of keeping this matter a secret, as
otherwise, his hands will be bound. He asked Dr. Melaney various questions, among
them the number of Baha’i students in this country from Iran. He was told that
there are very few—perhaps ten to fifteen in all.

Dr. Melaney and I both feel extremely grateful for this providential opportunity,
> which coincided with the Birthday of the Blessed Bab, and that it may inaugurate a
> period of greater freedom and justice for our brother Baha’is in Iran.41

An Analysis of the Above Report
According to the above report of the National Spiritual Assembly of the Baha’is of the
United States, an official meeting with Iran’s Prime Minister Dr. Musaddiq took place in an
“extremely friendly” atmosphere. The Minister knew well that the wrongs inflicted on the
Baha’is predated his assumption of the office and cherished the hope that these tyrannies
and injuries “of the past will not be repeated.” He gave his assurance that he would help the
Baha’is and said that “he will personally do all he can to assist the Baha’is in his country and
will never resist an opportunity to see that justice is done.” According to the testimony of
the representative of the American Baha’is, Dr. Musaddiq was “fully sincere in his
expressions” and speech, for he was the prime minister of a Muslim nation, but more
importantly, the prime minister of a country under constitutional law.

The Baha’is of America who were “deeply concerned over the incident of persecution of
the Iranian Baha’is” were happy to have had an opportunity to discuss their anxiety and to
appeal for justice with the prime minister of Iran, who enjoyed a considerable international
appeal and popularity at that time. It appears that they alluded to the Baha’i prisoners of
Yazd and expressed concern over the incident of murders in Abarqu. In response, Dr.
Musaddiq stated that he “knew of the imprisonment of Baha’is of Yazd and other incidents”
since one of the Baha’is of Iran, Major-General ‘Ala’i,42 had met with him, and had reported
that Baha’is were not treated with equity.

It is noteworthy that the representative of the American Baha’is confirmed and
emphasized in his report that Dr. Musaddiq sincerely recommended to them that he write
him an official letter and then immediately, unmistakably, and clearly reminded them not to
write him a letter promoting the Baha’i Faith or “in which the spread and influence of the
Faith are recorded,” since, as emphasized by the representative of the American Baha’is,
“that would be disliked.” “What he needs is a formal representation in which the incidents of
persecution are documented, and a request and appeal made for help for our fellow Baha’is
in Iran who have been persecuted.”

41 A handwritten note appears at the bottom of the report, which states:

> I transmitted this information to [the secretary of the National Spiritual Assembly of the
> Baha’is of the United States] Horace Holley, and explained the type of letter requested by the
> Prime Minister. Horace sent me the letter, enclosing a copy of a printed letter written in
> Persian, being a translation of a letter written to the chiefs of Islam by the NSA some years
ago.

The letter from Horace had to be re-written, and in the meantime, the Prime Minister
> had left for Washington. I therefore asked Horace to send the final draft to Mr. [Paul]
> Haney, who was requested to deliver the documents to Dr. Mossadegh in care of the Iranian
Embassy.

Mr. Haney reported that he delivered them to the secretary at the Embassy with the
> statement that the Prime Minister was awaiting these documents, and he was assured that
> they would be placed in the hands of Dr. Mossadegh.

42 Major-General Shu‘a‘u’llah ‘Ala’i (1889–1984) was a member of the National Spiritual Assembly of the

Baha’is of Iran; on February 29, 1952, he was appointed to the rank of the Hand of the Cause of God, a high
administrative office in the Baha’i community.

Dr. Musaddiq, the leader of the Nationalist Movement of Iran, was so sincere and
truthful that he clearly explained the reasons for his recommendation and told the
representative of the Baha’is what to write “on the letterhead of the National Assembly,
signed and sealed” so that it was “a formal representation” and could be used “for help.” He
even went so far to dictate the actual wording to be used at the conclusion of the letter, “We
wonder that in a country which has an ancient civilization and possesses constitutional laws,
a group of people is treated in a manner which conflicts with these fundamental laws. The
latter proclaim that the people are equal before law.”

The meeting ended with great cordiality, and the Baha’i representatives assured him that
“the Baha’is would pray for his good health.” It is also noted, “The spirit of the audience was
one of extreme friendliness; it was entirely unhurried.” And when the representatives left the
prime minister, “he personally accompanied” them “to the door upon leaving and shook”
their “hand very warmly on two occasions.”

Letter of the American National Spiritual Assembly
Three days later, the letter that was sent on the recommendation of Dr. Musaddiq on the
letterhead of the National Spiritual Assembly of the Baha’is of the United States arrived at
the Iranian Embassy in Washington. In this letter, the Baha’is provided a detailed account of
anti-Baha’ism and widespread massacres of Baha’is throughout Iran during the 1940s, and
urged the prime minister to administer justice.

This letter is not merely a request for justice or an account of the cruelties of the mullas.

Rather, it is a report filled with sorrow, condemning the government [of Iran] and its society,
which disregarded the rights of individuals and the civil rights of religious and tribal
minorities.43

Care of the Embassy of Iran in Washington, D.C.

[Your Excellency Dr. Muhammad Musaddiq, the Prime Minister of Iran:]

> On behalf of the American Baha’i community, the National Spiritual Assembly
> welcomes Your Excellency to this country and considers it timely to respectfully
> submit before you, as the head of the government of Iran, a brief account of the
wrongs inflicted upon the Baha’is of Iran in recent times.

43In a communication dated December 3, 2009, the Archives Office of the National Spiritual Assembly of the
Baha’is of the United States informed the present translator that the original of this letter in English was not
available in their files. Therefore, the following rendering from the Persian should be considered as
approximating the original communication.

recorded. In accordance with this report, this Assembly can justly state that
followers of the Baha’i Faith in Iran have been deprived of their civil rights in
governmental agencies, that their possessions and property have been plundered by
unregulated elements, and that their lives are the targets of attacks, even death, while
police officers and security agents have offered no assistance.

The National Spiritual Assembly [of the Baha’is of the United States] has copies
of various letters and documents prepared by administrative agencies of the Baha’is
of Iran, which have been submitted with great urgency to the government of that
country, but which have remained unanswered and have resulted in no remedy. This
Assembly is confident that Your Excellency, aware of the impoverishment of public
opinion [in Iran] and the ill-behavior of officials, will take effective steps towards
ensuring the safety and security of Baha’is under the protection of the law.

What will be briefly outlined in this presentation relates to current events that
commenced in 1944; reference to other events or enumerating the most critical
details in these historical documents has been avoided.

The instigators of persecution against Baha’is are in reality members of an active
group known as Anjuman Tablighat Islami [The Society for Islamic Propaganda],
whose activities have greatly increased since 1941. Members of the aforesaid group
are active in various parts of the country and provoke the public against Baha’is;
moreover, they urge the police to neglect the protection of these wronged citizens in
the face of public abuse. Moreover, this Society has been engaged in publishing lies
against the Baha’is and in fueling the fire of public enmity and prejudice, to the
point that the populace now considers Baha’is to be enemies of religion and the
nation, destroyers of Islam, and opposers of civil law. Wherever the Baha’is are
under attack, the Muslim ‘ulama—in other words, mullas—have an active hand in
events. They assure people in the mosques that if they were to massacre and
completely annihilate the Baha’is, they would receive a worthy prize in paradise.
They instruct people to kill Baha’is and plunder their possessions.

These records indicate that in many instances, local authorities have considered
any attempt to suppress this prejudicial incitement to be most dangerous. For this
reason, despite the fact that Baha’is are most brutally subjected to attack and their
possessions are pillaged, the nation’s administrative apparatus is also rendered
impotent.

In 1944, mosques and other Islamic institutions in Shahrud provoked the
population to persecute the Baha’is. The people set the entrance to the Hadiratu’l-
Quds [Baha’i Center] on fire, and plundered all the furnishings and provisions
inside. A few days later, a tumultuous mob, five-thousand strong, armed with rocks,
clubs, knives and meat-cleavers, attacked Baha’is. Several of them [Baha’is] took
refuge in the police station, but were confronted by an officer’s cry, “Kill these
infidels!” With that, the police officers assaulted the Baha’is with their rifle-butts.
Simultaneously, the crazed mob attacked the homes and shops of the Baha’is, forced
their way inside, and plundered all that there was, leaving these Baha’is naked and
dispossessed—and not one soul came to their aid.

A Baha’i by the name of Muhammad Jazbani was severely beaten and left injured
and unmoving. His unconscious body was taken to a physician’s office in that
vicinity, but the mob forced their way inside, seized the Baha’i, and threw him down
from the second floor window. His dying body was so brutally assaulted in the
streets that he soon expired.

Among the Baha’is whose homes and shops were pillaged and then set on fire
were the following families: Khuda’i, Aqazadih, Muhajirzadih, Tabataba’i, and
‘Attari. After destroying their shops, the mob attacked the homes of these Baha’is
and killed several of them.

The Baha’is appealed to the governmental authorities; however, the investigators
> who were sent to Shahrud reported to the Justice Ministry that the real offenders
> were the Baha’is themselves! Another examiner submitted a prejudicial report filled
> with lies against the Baha’is. None of these non-Baha’i witnesses had the courage to
testify about what they he had observed.

Eventually, 34 individuals were arrested on charges of murder and pillage, and
> their case was sent to the High Criminal Court of Tehran. Of these, 31 were
> sentenced to misdemeanors and other minor offenses. The manner of this trial and
the way it was conducted greatly offended public sentiment.

Despite all existing evidence and witnesses, the murderers were freed, and the
> looters were sentenced to just one month of imprisonment.44 This resulted in the
> encouragement of lawlessness and the erosion of people’s confidence in the
> judiciary. This in turn resulted in a new wave of persecution against Baha’is. “Go,
> kill Baha’is and confiscate their possessions! Did the government punish the people
> of Shahrud? You too can act like them!” Such was the call to arms of the mischief-
makers and rabble-rousers!

The following is the text of a Ministerial Decree, no. 744, dated July 4, 1944:

> Among the Baha’i teachers and leaders are commonly found those
> who work in governmental offices. The activities of these
> individuals and their involvement in the affairs of the nation are
> destructive and a cause of harm and loss. With the utmost care and
> seriousness they must be kept under surveillance; should they fail
> to follow instructions, they must be dealt with in accordance with
> the law.

> This document provided the mischief-makers with the necessary pretext to further
> harass, persecute, and attack Baha’is, and to expel them from various government
offices.45

Other incidents that have been briefly reported are as follows:

• A home in Abadeh, which served as the Hadiratu’l-Quds [Baha’i Center], was set

> on fire, and a number of the Baha’i residents were beaten. Their books and
> papers were burned and their homes plundered. Two local clerics incited people
> to slay the Baha’is and confiscate their possessions. Police did not make any
> effort to prevent these actions.
• In Aran, in the vicinity of Kashan, a mob burned the entrance of a Baha’i shop

and then marched in the streets while shouting insults and abuse against Baha’is.

44 After the Baha’i killings in Shahrud, a cleric by the name of Shaykh ‘Abdu’llah Shahrudi published a book

under the title, Dasa’is va Fitnih-Angizihayi Baha’iha, printed by Daftar Nashriyat Dini Nur. The appearance of
this book came to the attention of one of the witnesses of these brutal killings and awakened his conscience.
He decided to write a rebuttal and disclose the lies, untruths, and deceits in Shahrudi’s book. It so happened
that this person was a supporter of Ahmad Kasravi, the famous author of the [polemical] monograph, Baha’igari
[Baha’ism], and who by his own account, was a Pak-Dinan [lit. pure-religions, a reference to the followers of
Ahmad Kasravi], and stated that “I have no connection to the Baha’is,” and who was even critical of the
Baha’is. Under the title of Haqayiq Guftani, this book was first published by Daftar Parcham, in Tehran, on Azar
1324 [December 1945]. This monograph is an undeniable document of the crimes of mullas against Baha’is and
clearly documents anti-Baha’ism in the Iranian culture. Haqayiq Guftani was published a second time by Payam
Publishing and distributed by Alburz Press in Frankfurt, Germany. I recommend this book to all Iranians. (BC)
[A rendering of this book in English is underway by the present translator.]
45 In the original text, it appears that this sentence is erroneously included with the ministerial proclamation.

• In Bandar-Gaz, people brought down the wall of the Hadiratu’l-Quds.
• In Bushru’i, in Khurasan province, a number of Baha’is were injured, and two

> shops and seven homes were destroyed. The entrance to the Gulistan Javid

> 20,000 tumans—were looted. Among the attackers, the chief of police,
> Ghulam-Rida Jamshidi, employed violence against the wife of the Baha’i
> resident.
• In Bandar-Shah, the shops of Baha’is were looted, and the Baha’is were

> subjected to harm and injuries, and attacked with knives. Police did not pursue
> the matter at all.
• Similar incidents were reported in Bujard, Bam (Kerman), Rafsenjan, Zabul, and

Sirjan.

• In Tehran, people were ceaselessly urged to persecute Baha’is.
• Azadegan newspaper published the following statement:

> Our laws regarding denying employment in governmental offices
> for [members of] this apostate sect [Baha’is] is completely clear.
> Therefore, by our official tradition, that is, by Islamic
> jurisprudence, the killing of Baha’is is permitted—nay, is
> considered a religious obligation.

Likewise, incidents of persecution, harassment, and discrimination against Baha’is,
including bodily harm and injuries, as well as the pillaging of property and
possessions, have been reported in: Tabas and Ferdaws (in the province of
Khurasan), Qasr-Shirin, Qum, Kulaveh-Dareh (near Qazvin), Mahmud-Abad,
Gulpaygan, Mahmudabad of Yazd, and Nahavand. All of these occurred in 1944.

The following year, 1945, witnessed the wider spread of persecution and
harassment in places such as Ardestan, Imamzadeh Hashem, Zabul, Isfand-Abad,
Kengavar, Nayriz, Sirjan, Rubat-Turk, Asiaban, Fasa and Sarvestan. In Jahrum,
Colonel Shirvani provided protection and security to those who had instigated these
cruel and oppressive deeds. Other cities where Baha’is were subjected to various
forms of harassment and maltreatment include Zavareh, Yazd, Eqlid, Isfahan,
Geshin-Jan, and Fasa.

For marrying in accordance with Baha’i rites, Baha’is were imprisoned
throughout the province of Khurasan, and some were fined for this reason as well.
In Isfahan, Baha’i sacred places and burial sites considered sacred and blessed by the
Baha’i community were desecrated. In the same city, a Baha’i student was expelled
because of his religion. In other towns, Baha’is were barred from attending public
bathhouses.

Documents and files of events related to 1946 are particularly disturbing. For
instance, in Birjand, a section of the city that was a neighborhood of Baha’is was
attacked and raided by a mob. The possessions of the Baha’is were plundered, their
papers and documents destroyed, and several residents assaulted. It is estimated that
this incident caused a loss in excess of 1,500,000 rials. The police and security forces
were unable to withstand the onslaught of the attackers. Women and children were
overcome with deep fright, while the men took refuge in the mountains and fields.

In the same year, in cities such as Yazd, Sari, Pul-Sefid, Shahsavar, Beh-Shahr,
Shahi, Nasrabad, Sarvestan, Mianduaba, Ardestan, Rafsenjan, Chenar, and Daryun,

Baha’is were violated and made targets of violence. It is noteworthy that in Brujen,
near Isfahan, the chief of the Education Department, along with officials of the
telegraph office and municipality, provoked Muslims against Baha’is. In Zahedan, a
Baha’i youth aged 20 was so brutally beaten and his head smashed in with a
hammer, that he lost the sight in one eye. In Khash (Zahedan), two Baha’is were
assaulted with rocks and clubs, and their merchandise was pillaged. At Sar-Chah, a
60-year-old Baha’i woman was so mercilessly attacked that she was at death’s door
because of the loss of blood. Thereafter, all Baha’i residents of that region were
expelled.

Moreover, records indicate that in that same year, 1946, in Kashan, Aran, Nayriz,
Khuramabad, Bandar-Gaz, Jahrum, Dughabad, Dahaj, Riz, Zavarih, Chal-Khames,
and Natanz, Baha’is sustained great losses to their persons and prosperity. In
Zavarih, a cleric compelled people not to enter into business transactions with
Baha’is and not to repay debts to them. In Natanz, near Isfahan, a Baha’i child died
when her home was set on fire.

In 1947, the unceasing efforts to exterminate the Baha’is failed in their objective.

For this year, we refer to two horrific incidents, in which Baha’is in an area were
violently attacked and compelled to leave their homes and the Spiritual Assembly
was dissolved. In Bandar-Shah, the chief clerics barred any commercial interaction
with Baha’is. In Gulpaygan, after Baha’is were beaten and injured, the local
authorities incarcerated both groups, that is, both the assailants and the Baha’is.
However, the public uproar reached such heights that they were forced to free the
offenders and banish the Baha’is who had suffered through this ordeal.

In Nameq, one of the towns in the province of Khurasan, police officers
confiscated the Haziratu’l-Quds of the Baha’is and made it their own headquarters.

As far as we are aware, the case involving the murder of a woman and her five
children in Abarqu in 1950 has not yet been concluded. Although the local villagers
knew who the real wrongdoer was and identified him to the authorities, and even
though newspapers in Yazd published the real motive for this crime, nevertheless,
through pressure exerted by influential citizens, the path of the investigation
changed until eventually two Baha’is were accused and arrested. The Baha’is of Yazd
informed the government that fanatical elements in Yazd were readying themselves
to attack and assault Baha’is, and that if the authorities did not intercede, there
would be grim consequences. At last, the case was sent to Tehran for adjudication.
Based on what has been heard, uproar and noisy propaganda could greatly sway
[official] decisions and hide the truth, and turn this case into a broad condemnation
of the Baha’is and their religion.

We are confident that this brief outline will suffice to establish our assertion,
since in various parts of Iran, Baha’is have been ruthlessly made the target of assault
and injury, some have been mercilessly killed, the possessions of many have been
plundered and pillaged, and they have been deprived of their civil rights.

Baha’is are not allowed to print books or journals. When the enemies publish
lies, it brings disrepute upon the Baha’is.

In the official government census, even though the Baha’is forthrightly declared
their religion, nonetheless the census-takers registered them as Muslim.

Fifty-eight Baha’is were discharged or suspended from work in the Education
Ministry or other governmental offices by October 1950, and we have their names
on file.

At a time when the fanatical Muslims accused the Baha’is of atheism, Satan-
worshiping and apostasy, and proclaimed them as the true enemies of Islam, our

Spiritual Assembly wrote to the leaders of Islam throughout Iran on March 21,
> 1928.46 That letter included the truth about the Baha’i teachings and the close
> connection between the Baha’i Faith and Islam, and the high regard by Baha’is for
> the Prophet Muhammad, which may aid Your Excellency in becoming more aware
> of the reality of the Baha’i Cause. For your information, we attach a copy of that
> communication, which has been translated into Persian, and submit it to your
presence.

The National Spiritual Assembly has copies of twelve publications appearing in
Iranian media regarding violent attacks on the Baha’is of that country:

> 1. Dad newspaper, no. 1737, February 6, 1950.
> 2. Naysan newspaper, no. 8.
> 3. Mahan newspaper, no. 20, 1949.
> 4. Iran-Tehran newspaper, no. 9004, February 6, 1950.
> 5. Ittila‘at newspaper, no. 7147, February 6, 1950.
> 6. Ittila‘at newspaper, no. 7151, February 11, 1950.
7. Ittila‘at newspaper, no. 7146, February 5, 1950. [Ittila‘at newspaper, no.

7151, February 11, 1950, has been listed a second time.]
> 8. Bakhtar-Imruz newspaper, no. 156, February 5, 1950.
> 9. Kayhan newspaper, no. 2046, February 5, 1950.
> 10. Haraz newspaper, no. 24, February 11, 1950.
> 11. Millat-Iran newspaper, no. 90, February 9, 1950.

12. Khandaniha Journal, no. 44, February 14, 1950.

What has been described will of necessity reach the public outside Iran’s borders.

praiseworthy conduct.

We ask that with confidence you accept our well-wishing prayers.

46   See appendix 8.

We do not know the exact effect that the reading of this complaint and its demand for
justice had on Dr. Musaddiq. However, we are confident that he was completely against any
extra-legal treatment of Baha’is, which was against the principles of the country’s
constitutional code—and his enemies, particularly the mullas, have stated as much in their
memoirs.

Chapter 4
The Military Tribunal

Falsafi and Musaddiq
The famed preacher Muhammad-Taqi Falsafi writes in his memoirs about his first visit along
with a contingent of other clerics to the home of Dr. Musaddiq:

> We went to the home of Dr. Musaddiq on Kakh Avenue, which is the present
> Palestine Avenue. He was lying in bed under the covers. We sat on chairs near him.
> Musaddiq asked with perplexity, “Do you go each day to mosque to perform your

Opposition to Musaddiq
It is important to repeat a point that fairness and conscience demands of us, and perhaps by
mentioning it we will become better acquainted with an aspect of Iran’s contemporary
history. We know—and there is no need to deny it since the youth of yesteryear, the present
author included, were themselves close witnesses to it—that a few months before the coup
d’état of August 19, 1953, at the instigation of the British and the United States, who were
the leaders of the Cold War in Iran, the entire clerical and political establishment
commenced opposition to the government of Dr. Musaddiq. Each day, through extensive
and vociferous marches in the streets and bazaars, they expressed this opposition. Their
newspapers and proclamations were widely published and disseminated. These opponents
were declaring everywhere that the country was on the verge of falling into the Soviet camp
and that soon the reins of power would be in the hands of the Communists and the Baha’is.

47   Davani, Khatirat va Mubarizat Hujjatu’l-Islam Falsafi, pp. 138–39.

It suffices to cite one among the countless articles that were published against the
Nationalist Movement and in favor of the suppression of Baha’is in the effort to implement
the policies of the Cold War, so that we may become more thoroughly familiar with the
clergy’s involvement in sedition and conspiracies.

Hujjatu’l-Islam Siyyid Shamsu’d-Din Qannatabadi has written in an article:

> Musaddiq’s anti-religious activities and his conspiracies against the Constitution, his
> changes [in the Constitution], his plans to alter the regime, his support of the Baha’is
> and the Tudeh Party, and his implementation of a plan to divide Iran and establish a
> dictatorship,…all caused the highly distinguished community of the clerics, from
> Ayatu’llahs Burujirdi, Kashani and Bihbahani, to the plain seminarians, to array
> themselves in a single row in accordance with their religious and national duties, and
> in conformity with their consciences, against the mischievous, untruthful, anti-
> religious, anti-clerical, and cursed government of Musaddiq.48

The opponents of the Nationalist Movement were hoping to provoke the sentiments of
Ayatu’llah Burujirdi, who harbored profound enmity towards the Baha’is, by saying that Dr.
Musaddiq supported and protected not only the members of the Tudeh Party but also the
Baha’is.

Ayatu’llahs Burujirdi and Kashani, as well as the preacher Muhammad-‘Ali Falsafi, and
indeed the entire ecclesiastical establishment, never understood the meaning of “the people
and the government,” and never accepted the premise of constitutional law in a
constitutional monarchy; for this reason, they threw in their lot with those planning the coup
d’etat, and the calamity of August 19th took place.49

> The anti-imperialist uprising of the people of Iran was not an unplanned event, nor
> was it without a prelude. Similar to all other movements and revolutions, it came
> about as a historical necessity after a series of occurrences resulting from social and
> global developments after World War II, and led to great victories. The failure of
> this uprising was not unplanned nor without a precedent either, and many events
> and causes precipitated this fall.50

Dr. Musaddiq’s response to the query of his defense counsel, Colonel Jalil Buzurgmihr,
stating that certain elements considered the growing power of the Tudeh Party to be
dangerous and therefore brought about the August 19 bloody revolt, can be expanded, and
we can also refute the slanderous and false charges against Dr. Musaddiq that he supported
and promoted the Baha’is and the Tudeh Party. It is through this review of the facts that we
learn about Dr. Musaddiq’s view of “nation,” “constitutional government,” and “liberty and
democracy.” And it is because of his broadmindedness that we discover why the preacher
Falsafi thought it was most astonishing when Musaddiq remarked, “Aqa Falsafi, in my view,
there is no difference between Muslims and Baha’is. They are all one nation and Iranian.” In
truth, Dr. Muhammad Musaddiq believed in parliamentary democracy and supported the
Universal Declaration of Human Rights.

Hujjatu’l-Islam Muhammad-Taqi Falsafi

Let us consider Dr. Musaddiq’s response to Colonel Buzurgmihr:

> Those who think this way do not possess political sense and acumen. What have
> these Tudeh members done? As that man said,51 they yelled slogans or printed
> newspapers. We did not give them permission to do anything else, and I always

> than the fact that people supported me? Do governments have any other support
other than the people? No, not at all.

were not happy with me either.

Therefore, when the people bring a government to power, that government is

> imperialism. It is their way to ensure that no one can breathe a word so they can do
> whatever they wish, such as arranging for oil exports, or creating consortia and such
> things.52

With all its internal conflicts, the Nationalist Movement was not a harmonized political and
historical phenomenon, but the premiership of Dr. Musaddiq was a harmonizing historical
and political necessity. It was because of this reality that the people before the August 19th
coup would shout in the streets, “Death or liberty,” followed by shouts of “Death or
Musaddiq.”

After the August 19th coup d’état, a description of which is beyond the scope of this
monograph, a military tribunal was convened, at which Dr. Musaddiq gave a historic self-
defense. This tribunal resulted in the disgrace of the government of Major-General Zahidi
and eventually of Muhammad-Reza Shah, and to this date is considered one of the most
important political trials in the contemporary history of Iran. Dr. Musaddiq’s testimony and

51 A reference to Brigadier-General Husayn Azmudih, the prosecutor at Dr. Musaddiq’s military tribunal. Later,
he became a dervish, and his critics, such as Almuti, referred to him as “Eichmann ‘Ali Shah.” (BC)
52 Nijati, Tarikh Siyasi Bist-u-Panj Salih Iran, p. 20. (BC)

the defense of his lawyers in this tribunal caused a deep divide among the political elites of
Iran, which neither the supporters nor the opponents of the Shah have been able to bridge.

Colonel Jalil Buzurgmihr was Dr. Musaddiq’s defense attorney—a trustworthy and
faithful man—who until his last breath kept the memory of Dr. Musaddiq true and
exhilarating by publishing his valuable memoirs and documents. For reasons that are not
clear to us, Dr. Musaddiq, however, did not fully trust him, and this fact is clearly revealed by
Colonel Buzurgmihr in his own words in his Musaddiq dar Mahkamih Nizami [Musaddiq in
the Military Tribunal].53 It appears that gradually, with great calmness, effort, and openness,
he was able to win the trust of Dr. Musaddiq. At any rate, based on the court proceedings
that Colonel Buzurgmihr has published himself and which are available to all, it appears that
he had a minor role in the military tribunal. Nonetheless, we should remember him with
much respect and praise him for being true and open during those perilous days.

Colonel Shahquli in the Military Tribunal
Astonishingly, Brigadier-General Riahi, the head of the military’s Joint Chiefs prior to the
August 19th coup, selected for his own defense counsel one of the most renowned Baha’is,
who was highly regarded in all military courts. The skilled and learned defense of Dr.
Musaddiq offered by Colonel Shahquli, the attorney of Brigadier-General Riahi, remains one
the most brilliant, and without any exaggeration, the most significant and precise defense
ever offered in Iran’s military courts. Regarding Shahquli, the following is noted by Colonel
Jalil Buzurgmihr:

> In the fifth session, Lieutenant-Colonel Shahquli, the attorney of Brigadier-General
> Riahi, began the defense of his client. Given his thorough knowledge of the criminal
> code, particularly the military justice code, as well as his extensive experience and
> expertise in military legal defense, Colonel Shahquli commenced by questioning the
> [court’s] jurisdiction over this trial. With a face beaming with smiles and self-
> confidence, with wise and learned expressions spiced with humor, with occasional
> charming smiles and great calmness and total control over his emotions, he
> conducted his deliberations with the utmost skill. The main line of his argument was
> a fundamental justification of Dr. Musaddiq’s views. In fact, he delivered this so well
> that Brigadier-General Azmudih [the prosecutor] in response to Lieutenant-Colonel
> Shahquli accused him of defending Dr. Musaddiq54—and this was true.55

Dr. Musaddiq knew Colonel Shahquli from earlier associations and had complete confidence
in him. With some melancholy and perhaps with a touch of disappointment, Colonel Jalil
Buzurgmihr writes:

> At times during court recesses, he [Dr. Musaddiq] would put his head on the
> shoulder of Lieutenant-Colonel Azmin, who was one of the defense counsels of
> Brigadier-General Riahi. He would close his eyes and pretend to be sleep. At other

prime minister.

fraternity.

When his case was appealed, I was appointed by him to be his lawyer, and for
outward appearances he would uphold the lawyer-client relationship.57

Dr. Muhammad Musaddiq and Colonel Shahquli in the military tribunal

Regarding Colonel Shahquli, Muhammad-‘Ali Muvahhid, the author of the well-documented
and enjoyable monograph, Khab Ashufteh Naft [The nightmare of oil], writes the following:
“Among the attorneys defending Brigadier-General Riahi, Colonel Shahquli was the most
eloquent, with the best command of arguments, and he was remarkably distinguished.”
Elsewhere, he restates the same view, “With an irrefutable and solid logic, and vast
knowledge of the law, Colonel Shahquli was the most eminent among the legal counselors in
the military tribunal of Dr. Musaddiq.”58

With legal deductions and sufficient evidence, Colonel Shahquli established that the
military tribunal against Dr. Musaddiq, the [former] prime minister, was unlawful and against
the provisions of Iran’s Constitution and its criminal and penal code. From the perspective
of law, he did not consider the presiding judge to have jurisdiction over the trial, and his
deduction was correct. That is because during the premiership of Dr. Musaddiq and after the
passage of the Military Court Reform laws, the man serving as the judge had been forced
into early retirement. [Shahquli argued that] such a person could not serve as the presiding
judge in a tribunal.

After the August 19th coup, almost all officers who had been forced to retire on the
instructions of Dr. Musaddiq and the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs, General Riahi, were

56 Colonel Buzurgmihr had been appointed by the court to be Dr. Musaddiq’s legal representative. (BC)

Iran, the Defense Proceedings of Colonel Shahquli,” pp. 173–82, and p. 475. The present author highly
recommends this book to all, since it is well documented and learned, and, unlike other political writings in
Persian, it is unbiased. It should be noted that Colonel ‘Abbas-Quli Shahquli later became a member of the
National Spiritual Assembly of the Baha’is of Iran. (BC)

returned to active duty on the recommendation of General Zahidi. Colonel Nasiri and other
officers forced into early retirement were even promoted to a higher rank by General Zahidi
prior to the August 19th coup and before the Shah’s return to the country. Thus, they
received their reward for their collaboration with the organizers of the coup.

Colonel Buzurgmihr writes, “Shahquli’s defense in the military tribunal certainly attracted
considerable attention. He had participated in the Commissions for drafting Dr. Musaddiq’s
reform legislation concerning the military courts and the military in general, and had exerted
influence on these issues in which he deeply believed.”

After the trial of Dr. Musaddiq was referred to the Military Court of Appeal, Colonel
Shahquli prepared a forty-page statement in which he raised numerous objections to the
ruling of the preliminary tribunal. Buzurgmihr writes, “It appears that the government of the
day considered the forthrightness and intelligence of Shahquli to be inappropriate; he was
instructed to feign illness [and to withdraw from the case], and he did as bidden.”

After the initial session of the court, Colonel Shahquli did not participate in its later
sessions. Buzurgmihr adds that pretending to be ill and the subsequent withdrawal of
Shahquli was ordered [by the government] and politically motivated, but he also notes that
he went to see him and saw “evidence of actual illness in him.”59

At the conclusion of the military tribunal, as a means of payback for defending Dr.

Musaddiq and raising logical objections to the jurisdiction of the military court [in trying the
former prime minister], Colonel Shahquli was immediately retired from active duty on the
instructions of Muhammad-Reza Shah, and Iran’s military lost one of its ablest and most
devoted officers, loyal to the army and to the nation.

The Trial and the Verdict

Everything we know about Dr. Musaddiq has firmly established that he was against any form
of suppression of ideas, anti-Baha’ism, or aggression towards unorthodox thinkers.
Nonetheless, despite the promise that he had given to the representatives of the American
Baha’is, Dr. Muhammad Musaddiq was unable to bring about a fair trial, nor was he able to
effect the liberty of a number of innocent Muslims and Baha’is who had fallen victim to the
connivance of religious clerics and Fada’iyan Islam. He himself was thoroughly consumed
with political upheavals as well as internally and externally conceived conspiracies and plots.
It was most unfortunate that those accused of the murders in Abarqu were entrapped in this
sad spectacle during one of the most chaotic moments in the history of Iran.

Collection of More Evidence
The trial of those accused of murder in Abarqu was convened on May 7, 1952, about two
months before the resignation of Dr. Musaddiq from the premiership on July 16, 1952.60
Before the court was convened and the trial took place, No. 1 Division of the Central
Criminal Court studied the case dossier and, recognizing the inadequacy of the evidence,
decided to take steps to complete the file. It wrote:

•   Where are the three unidentified Baha’is of Isfandabad who have been accused of being the

> real murderers? Bring them so we can sentence them to execution and also convict others of
> being accomplices.
•   There is not a shred of evidence in the file about the activities of ‘Abbas-‘Ali Purmihdi. You

must investigate further and state what his role has been in this murder.
•   What is the source for Sergeant-Major Khakpur’s assertion that the furnishings of the slain

> were taken to the village of Dehbid to Ahmad Niku’i by Muhammad-Husayn, the brother of
> Muhammad Shirvani? How could Muhammad-Husayn have killed Sughra at night, then
> traveled to Dehbid, and returned to Abarqu by the morning?

Nevertheless, many essential elements of this case were disregarded. For instance, the
[supposed] religious motivations for these murders; the inspector’s decision to set the

60 An incident took place in Yazd that caused considerable problems for the Baha’is of that region. The
following is recorded in The Baha’i World, vol. 12, p. 705:

> In March 1951, in Yazd, a young man was discovered dead in a desolate part of the town. A
> few enemies of the Baha’i Faith spread false rumors about, to the effect that the boy had
> been murdered by Baha’is. They placed his body in a coffin and carried it around the town
> lamenting the death of the youth and speaking vehemently of the cruel deed of the Baha’is.
> While this incident was taking place, two men who were members of the Faith, were severely
beaten in a neighborhood shop because of their religious affiliation with the Baha’i group.

At the same time another group of enemies of the Faith went about the town of Taft
> destroying the gardens and damaging the homes of Baha’is. One Baha’i with a Parsi

primary suspects, who were Sughra’s guests that night, free without any bond; the role of
Isfandiyar Khan Salari; the sudden dismissal of Commander Haqqgu from his post in Yazd;
the dismissal without cause of the chief of police in Abarqu, Sergeant-Major Husayn
Sadripur, etc.

At any rate, [inspector] Asadu’llah Zamanian was appointed to complete the legal file.

He went to Yazd, raided the home of the Baha’is and their Hadiratu’l-Quds [Baha’i Center]
in the same city, and confiscated a large quantity of notebooks, papers, Baha’i writings,
books, some commercial documents of Jalal Binish, and even personal records and family
pictures, as well as treasured manuscripts—in short, many documents that had nothing to do
with the Abarqu case. He sent these to Tehran as irrefutable evidence of the case. He then
traveled to Isfandabad and briefly questioned Sergeant-Major Khakpur.

However, what he presented as his final report in response to the questions raised by the
court as a means of completing the file is very interesting:

•   Regarding the three Baha’i farmers in Isfandabad, they had been freed, since even the

> inspector in Yazd, Sadiqi, had no choice but to let them go. However, Zamanian summoned
> them again, confounded them with kindness and trickery, and placed a paper before them, in

> though, he arrested these three individuals—Muhammad Rafahi, Hasan Himmati, and
> Husayn Karambakhsh—and sent them forthwith to Tehran. In this way, he taught a new
> lesson in treachery and deceit to Khakpur and his master, Sadiqi.
•   Regarding ‘Abbas-‘Ali Purmihdi and his connection with Muhammad Shirvani, no matter

> how they tried, they could not find the smallest evidence to establish their connection.
> However, eventually they located two individuals in Abarqu who testified, “Three days after
> Sughra’s murder, we saw ‘Abbas-‘Ali, who seemed agitated, in Abarqu, saying that he wanted
> to go to Yazd.” This became their “strong” evidence for his involvement in the murder.
•   Regarding the impossibility of Muhammad-Husayn traveling all that distance that night, this

> me about this. But, Mr. Inspector, praise be unto God, you are very smart, so how do you
> not disbelieve that Muhammad-Husayn had killed Sughra, and that night traveled 150

kilometers to Dehbid, returning by daylight?”

In such frivolous ways, responses to the court’s preliminary queries were arrayed and
sufficient evidence for commencing the trial were assembled.

The Principles62
As noted earlier, the court convened on May 7, 1952, at No. 1 Division of the Tehran
Criminal Court.

The accused were as follows:

61 According to Nikravan, “Barrasi,” in this document, the three Baha’is had confessed that the night before the
murder they had met with Shirvani and conceived the plans for Sughra’s murder.

Baha’is of Iran, July 16, 1952, reproduced in appendix 9, document 2.

After the procedure for the identification of the defendants was completed, the prosecutor’s
indictment outlining the charges against the accused was read in full at the court. A summary
of this indictment is provided in appendix 9, document 2.

The Role of Clerics in the Trial

The most essential point in the course of this incident is that the provocation of people and
incitement of public uproar by the clerical establishment and its leadership was due to the
clerics’ enmity and hatred for the Baha’is, and their actions were done for the purpose of
instilling fear in the judicial officials and covering up the glaring holes in the legal file.

The previous pages presented a brief account of political and religious developments in
Iran after the conclusion of World War II and the impact of the Cold War on these
developments. There is no doubt that Isfandiyar Khan Salari, in order to exonerate himself
of the crime he had committed, placed blame on the Baha’is. However, this scheme could
not have been implemented without the collaboration and alliance of the mullas. It appears
conclusively that since he was a maternal grandson of Akhund Haji Shaykh Ahmad, the
Imam-Jum‘ih of Abadeh, he had without doubt learned such conspiracies in the seminary
classes of the Haji. For a wealthy and affluent man like him, who enjoyed close ties to the
mullas, it is likely that through Ayatu’llah Siyyid Nuri’d-Din Shirazi, who was a sworn enemy
of the Baha’is and who had established a considerable organization in the province of Fars
against Baha’is, that he had made contacts with the office of Ayatu’llah Burujirdi, since it was
enough only for the latter to hear the phrase “Baha’i” for him to lose all his composure. This
is not merely a hypothesis or a conjecture; it is something that all the mullas who are
presently at the top of the Islamic government confirm and affirm.

In fact, there is no need to cite the memoir of Ayatu’llah Husayn-‘Ali Muntazari,
inasmuch as earlier we cited a portion of the recollections of Muhammad-Taqi Falsafi, and
that should suffice. However, the enmity of this Source of Emulation [Ayatu’llah Burujirdi]
was expressed particularly strongly in the case of the murders of Abarqu, as evidenced by the
facts that his student, companion, and biographer, Hujjatu’l-Islam ‘Ali Davani, has narrated.
The latter, who on “numerous occasions” benefited from the highly adorned seminary [in
Qum] and who was trusted with the most secret thoughts and doings of the Source of
Emulation of the Twelver Shi’is, Grand Ayatu’llah Haji Aqa Husayn Burujirdi, stated that in
a similar instance, the Ayatu’llah

> would immediately write letters to the Shah, the prime minister and Ayatu’llah
Bihbahani and send them to Tehran.

> remain in prison.

Elsewhere, this confidant and companion of the chief of the Shi’is of the world writes
regarding another incident in which several innocent Baha’is were arrested on a charge of
murder:

> Several Baha’is had killed one of their coreligionists, and through trickery had
> presented some devoted [i.e., Muslim] youth to the law. One of these youth was

There is no need to wait until the Day of Resurrection, since we will see in the conclusion of
this book that Ayatu’llah Burujirdi’s hands were covered with the blood of innocents—and
astonishingly, not just the blood of Baha’is, but also the blood of Muslims who considered
him their Source of Emulation. Religious prejudice causes calamity.64

Ahmad Nasiri, the attorney representing the three accused from Isfandabad, has
mentioned several recollections in his account of the frenzied trial, of which we will cite only
one instance.65 This particular recollection is about the involvement of Ayatu’llah Bihbahani,
the fully empowered representative of Ayatu’llah Burujirdi, with respect to the murders at
Abarqu. Because of the clarity of this recollection and its simplicity, there is no need to
provide any commentary or analysis. Nasiri writes:

> Before the trial of the accused in the murders of Abarqu, I came across Haji ‘Ali-
> Akbar Khan Tih in the courthouse. He was a litigator at the time and later became
> the prosecutor for the Bar Association.66 In the course of our conversation, he
> asked, “Are you involved with the Abarqu case?” I replied affirmatively. Haji ‘Ali-
> Akbar Khan Tih said, “I have an experience in this regard, which I should recount
for you.”

He then related, “Some time ago, one of the exalted ‘ulama, that is, Bihbahani,

“Bihbahani replied, ‘No, your involvement is necessary as well. For the sake of

64 According to Nikravan, “Barrasi,” considerable pressure was also brought upon the Shah and the court by
Ayatu’llah Shari‘atmadari in Qum and other high-ranking clerics in Mashhad.
65 The Baha’i defendants were represented by three Baha’i lawyers and several Muslim lawyers. The Baha’i

lawyers were Azizu’llah Navidi (1913–1987), Kazem Kazemzadeh (1898–1989), and Ahmad Nasiri.
66 One of Dr. Musaddiq’s reforms was to make Iran’s Bar Association independent of the Justice Department.

Although most of the legislation passed during the Musaddiq era was later abrogated, the independence of the
Bar Association was maintained.
67 Tort law is a body of law that addresses and provides remedies for civil wrongs stemming from intentional

and negligent acts. A person who suffers legal damages may be able to use tort law to receive compensation
from someone who is legally responsible, or liable, for those injuries. In the Abarqu case, not only were the
defendants prosecuted by the Justice Ministry, they were also sued by ten lawyers provided by the clerical
establishment.

“I replied, ‘As far as I have heard, so far 700,000 tumans has been collected for

> When I said that, Aqa Bihbahani became agitated and with much anger said, ‘Such
talk is not true. If you do not want to accept the case, you are free to decline.’”

Haji ‘Ali-Akbar Khan Tih added, “I did not accept the case, but as long as such
> sums of money can be raised, each year they will accuse a Baha’i for having
> murdered someone and on the pretext of hiring tort attorneys, collect and pocket
> large sums.”68

In accordance with Ayatu’llah Bihbahani’s instruction, every night the mullas at mosques and
worship centers cursed, blighted, attacked, and slandered the Baha’is and convinced people
who did not suspect their deception and conspiracies.

For the sake of history, we should record the names of the ten69 tort attorneys who were
on the payroll of Ayatu’llah Bihbahani, since some of these names are still current on
people’s tongues: Kishavarz Sadr, Shaykh Reza Maliki, Ahmad Dhu’l-Majd Tabataba’i,
Hashim Tabataba’i, Pur-Reza, Adib Razavi Yazdi, Siyyid Mihdi Razavi, Khudadad Sabir
Astara’i, and most unfortunate of all, Abu’l-Hasan ‘Amidi-Nuri, the editor of Dad
newspaper, who at first published the news and the names of the real perpetrators of the
Abarqu murders, but who later after receiving fees for legal services from Ayatu’llah
Bihbahani spoke extensively in the trial against the innocent defendants.

From this time onward, Iran’s judiciary was under the control of the collaborators of
Ayatu’llah Burujirdi and his Tehran chieftain, Ayatu’llah Bihbahani, and the thugs and
ruffians of the terrorist organization Fada’iyan Islam ruled over the Justice Ministry’s
headquarters in Iran.

Anti-Baha’i Propaganda
During the Abarqu trial, a large number of mullas and preachers, as well as fanatical and
angry shopkeepers from the bazaar, sat in the courtroom, not to observe the proceedings,
but only to disrupt the order in the court and to instill fear in the defendants’ attorneys. With
a loud and vociferous uproar, they would demand that the court issue a verdict against the
[Baha’i] accused and condemn them to execution.

In order to deflect anti-religious sentiments from himself, Khalil Sabri, the prosecutor in
the case who was a Sunni, was extreme in his fervor, and delivered a seditious and regrettable
indictment in front of the Shi‘i congregation attending the trial. He claimed, “For fifty years,
Baha’is have been killing people,” and concluded his remarks by stating, “The court must
punish the accused to the fullest extent of the law, as otherwise the people themselves will
take revenge.” In this manner, he incited religious prejudices and brought about a fearful
atmosphere in the court, even though the task of the prosecutor was to present factual
evidence against the accused.

68   Afnan, Bigunahan, pp. 155–56.
69   Only nine names are given in the text.

Each day outside the courthouse, pamphlets filled with lies, calumnies, reprehensible
slanders, and shameful insults were distributed by the terrorist society of Fada’iyan Islam. As
an example, in a decorated 32 x 52 cm. flyer, the following was printed:

> How were the lady Sughra and her innocent five children killed? Why were they
killed? Who are their murderers and instigators?
Each day, from 9 in the morning come to the Criminal Court and observe the trial.

How will the nation’s authorities, the judiciary, and the honored judges
> adjudicate and administer justice regarding this great tragedy? Will they hang the
> murderers and instigators on the gallows, or will they leave the judgment and
> punishment to the people to administer? With heavy hearts we will observe the
> trial until its last day and await its verdict.

In another proclamation by the same Fada’iyan Islam, the following was said:

> This is an Islamic nation. The brave people of Iran will drag the evil remains of
unpatriotic elements in the dust of abasement.

O nationless Baha’is! O sullied hands! O high authorities in the judiciary! O
> judges! The eyes of millions Muslims are open to your deeds; from under a
> mountain of dirt, the blood-soaked bodies of the martyrs of Abarqu, who have been
torn and broken with shovels and pickaxes, are now fixed on your judgment!

We demand:

1. Execution of those involved in the murder of a woman and her five

children;
2. Execution of the evil elements who in the courtroom of this Shi‘i nation

have openly confessed to their apostasy [i.e., to being Baha’is].

In another proclamation that Fada’iyan Islam disseminated in the same building of Iran’s
high court, the following was reflected:

> Should the court and its judges fail to punish the shameless murderers of a meek
> Muslim lady and her dear five children, or hesitate or delay in issuing the verdict of
> execution regarding them, then by the order of the Lord of creation, the brave
children of Islam will send, wherever they may be, the criminal Baha’is to hell.

We swear by the Almighty God that should those who have torn asunder our
> Muslim sister and her beloved children not be hanged from the gallows, not only we
> will tear each and every one of them into pieces, we will also gravely punish the
> responsible and conservative authorities.

Dozens of similar proclamations and pamphlets were distributed, all intended to provoke the
religious sentiments of ill-informed people and to influence the decision of the court.

Presentation of Tort Attorneys
With the exception of two or three of the tort attorneys who confined themselves to
discussion of the law, legal matters, details of the incident and, in fairness, observed decorum
and etiquette, the other tort attorneys over several days of the trial consistently caused a huge
uproar, and in place of logic and deduction in proving the charges against the [Baha’i]

defendants, they launched severe attacks, accompanied by false accusations and the most
abusive language, against the personal beliefs and characters of the accused.

Khudadad Sabir Astarani, who bore great enmity towards Baha’is, would bring such
books to the court as the Bayan by the Siyyid-i Bab, the Aqdas by Baha’u’llah, and Mufawadat
[Some Answered Questions] by ‘Abdu’l-Baha. Misleadingly, he would proclaim that Baha’is
considered every impure object as clean, or if a Baha’i did not change the furnishing of his
house every 19 years, then he would be expelled from the community, or that Baha’is must
place their dead in marble coffins for interment, and was it not clear that “if everyone
became Baha’i, where would so much marble come from?”

In order to deflect charges of being a Baha’i-sympathizer, Abu’l-Hasan ‘Amidi-Nuri, the
editor of Dad newspaper, who at the beginning of the events had published a true account of
the incident and had indentified the actual instigators on the strength of a report by
Baniadam, the truthful Governor of Yazd, brought with him the thoroughly fictitious and
fabricated Memoirs of Kinyaz Dolgorukii, the former Russian Ambassador to Iran,70 and read
the entire text in the court and without any evidence or support called the accused,
“nationless, spies and murderers.”71

Siyyid Mihdi Razavi, another tort lawyer of Ruqiyih, the sole surviving daughter of
Sughra, stated, “By causing uproar and pandemonium in the trials of those who had killed
the mahduru’d-Dam72 Baha’is in Shahrud or Dr. Berjis in Kashan, we threatened and
frightened the judges, and succeeded in gaining acquittals through the court.” With such
words, he deliberately told the judges and observers what they were expected to do.

Adib Razavi-Yazdi said, “Before the Constitutional Revolt, anyone who openly admitted
to being a Baha’i in Yazd was a must-be-killed, and by now, hundreds of Baha’is have been
killed in Yazd on the basis of fatwas issued by the ‘ulama.73 However, after the ratification of
the Constitution, ‘ulama were not permitted to issue a fatwa sanctioning anyone’s death, and
as such, the court must find Baha’is guilty and through this means eradicate these people.”

Another tort attorney spoke at length about the necessity of giving the Baha’is to
different occupational groups for killing—the same thing that Nasiri’d-Din Shah Qajar had
done with the Babis of Tehran.74Yet another attorney hired by Ayatu’llah Bihbahani claimed
that Mirza Taqi-Khan Amir-Kabir was killed by Baha’is, while another attorney said that the

70 The book, Memoirs of Kinyaz Dolgorukii, was a creation of the fiction-writing pen of ‘Ali Javaher-Kalam and

was published with the financial aid of Astan Quds Razavi and the encouragement of the Shi‘i clerical
establishment. (BC)
71 His misfortune was in the fact that after the victory of the Islamic Revolution, all his services were ignored by

the mullas, and he came to an ill end. On Thursday, October 9, 1997, Kayhan newspaper printed in London, no.
677, page 11, the following account in Persian:

> Abu’l-Hasan ‘Amidi-Nuri, the publisher of Dad newspaper, who was a flamboyant attorney
> and a Member of Parliament, was executed by the Islamic Republic. It was then reported to
> his family that his execution was in error, and as such, the instruction to confiscate his estate
> was withdrawn. (BC)
72 Literally, free blood, refers to such groups as Baha’is, the spilling of whose blood is not subject to religious

sanction or payment of blood-money to the surviving family under Shi‘i jurisprudence.
73 On the brutal pogrom against the Baha’is of Yazd and its environs, see Rabbani, Baha’i Martyrdoms in Manshad

in 1903: Three Historical Accounts; and also, Rabbani, “‘Abdu’l-Baha’s Proclamation on the Persecution of Baha’is
in 1903.”
74 A detailed discussion of this incident is given by ‘Abdu’l-Baha, presumably based on his firsthand knowledge.

See, Mu’ayyad, Eight Years Near ‘Abdu’l-Baha: Diary of Dr. Habib Mu’ayyad.

reason that the Baha’is had slain Sughra was because fifty years earlier the Muslims of
Abarqu had killed two Baha’is.75

They manufactured the most bewildering statements in the name of the Comte de
Gobineau, Edward Granville Browne, and George Bernard Shaw, and openly insulted,
belittled and abused the sacred beliefs of the accused, accompanied by the most offensive
language. Along with these, members of the Fada’iyan Islam, who had filled all the chairs in
the courtroom, would raise the cry of Allah’u’Akbar, or occasionally proclaim salutations to
the Prophet, as a means of supporting and confirming the outlandish remarks of the tort
attorneys. The air was so filled with attacks and threats that the defense attorneys, and of
course the accused themselves, were deeply frightened, and had lost all hope of surviving
this ordeal; with great trepidation and worry, they awaited the conclusion of this spectacle.

The insults and accusations against the defendants voiced by the attorneys bought by
Ayatu’llah Bihbahani, even though they were all completely unrelated to the Abarqu
murders, and even though not all of the defendants were Baha’i and some were Muslim,
nonetheless were not met with any objections on the part of the presiding judges. On the
contrary, time and again, the defendants’ attorneys were interrupted by judges who warned
them about and objected to their statements. There is much to be said on this.

Ahmad Nasiri, one of the defense counsels, stated:

> At the end of the third day of trial, Siyyid Mahmud Safavi, who was another attorney
> representing the defendants, and I were leaving the courtroom. Suddenly we were
> confronted in the corridors of the courthouse by one of the fanatical elements
> whose job was to provoke the spectators into disruption, who was wearing an ‘aba
> and kippah, and displaying a long beard. He began to chase and threaten us in the
> most abusive and filthy language. Siyyid Mahmud Safavi held my hand and said,
“Do not respond.” With great haste we left the courthouse.

Next day, Siyyid Mahmud Safavi sent a note by his physician stating that he was
ill, and he never attended the trial after that.

For a long time after that, whenever he saw me in the court building, he would
avoid me and pretend that he did not know me.

It is likely that Ahmad Nasiri did not know that Siyyid Mahmud Safavi was the maternal
uncle of Siyyid Mujtaba Navvab Safavi, the founder of the terrorist society Fada’iyan Islam.
Undoubtedly, Siyyid Mahmud Safavi’s life had been threatened by the head of the Fada’iyan
Islam, and on the pretext of being ill, he had withdrawn from the case. The Fada’iyan Islam
always sought to conceal the fact that the mother and the maternal uncle of Navvab Safavi
were deeply appalled by his crimes and always turned their backs on his evil ways.

Lawyers Representing Baha’i Defendants
It is propitious to name those who in the midst of such turbulent times and worrisome
conditions nevertheless accepted to represent the Baha’is; perchance, their example of

75Presumably, this is a reference to the fact that two Baha’is, Aqa Siyyid Ja‘far and Ustad Muhammad Zaman
Sabbagh, were arrested in Isfandabad, taken to Abarqu, and publicly tortured and killed on April 2, 1901. Later
in the same year, another Baha’i, Aqa Rida, was killed in his own home in Isfandabad. In 1903, Aqa ‘Ali
Muhammad, the brother of Aqa Rida, was shot and killed in Isfandabad. Source: Rasti, Eyewitness Account of
1950 Persecutions in Abarqu, p. 1.

bravery and humanity would serve as a brilliant lamp for our countrymen in these difficult
times.

The bravest and most experienced of the attorneys who represented the Baha’is of Yazd
was ‘Abdu’llah Razi. He was a devoted Muslim who believed that Baha’is did not disrupt the
general order of Iranian society, paid their taxes, and for this reason Baha’is must be
provided with civil rights, which must be protected, and that their dignity and beliefs must
be safeguarded from the darts of the ill-wishing. On many occasions, he agreed to provide
legal counsel to Baha’is, and with utmost sincerity and interest he would carry out his law
practice. In the Abarqu trial, he agreed to represent the defendants, since he believed in their
innocence. He was an experienced and skilled lawyer.

In addition to his oral arguments, Razi submitted his remarks to the court in writing, so
that they could not advance a false claim against him or accuse of him of any shortcoming.
‘Abdu’llah Razi, who had fully comprehended the ill-intention of the court and knew about
the aggressive actions of the Fada’iyan Islam, placed a copy of the Qur’an over his head and
with that commenced his defense. With a resonant voice he swore, “I am a Muslim, and am
duty-bound to defend the innocent.” He sprinkled his conclusive and well-supported
defense with verses from the Qur’an and examples from the history of Islam, as he knew
these would be pleasing to the presiding judge and to the Fada’iyan Islam. Fearlessly, he
referred to the entire case as a show-trial against some innocent men. Many times, the judge
interrupted his energetic and reasoned statements, but ‘Abdu’llah Razi never hesitated in his
able defense of the guiltless defendants. The unceasing cries and threats of the Fada’iyan
Islam never overwhelmed or vanquished him, and in utmost bravery and courage he
continued to stand by his innocent clients. May his memory be honored.

The Verdict
The trial of those accused in the murders of Abarqu concluded in twenty-one days, on May
12, 1952.76 Ashraf Ahmadi, the malevolent and suborned presiding judge in this trial, issued
an inhumane verdict intended to please those in authority and power. Soon, he climbed the
ladder of success: Husayn ‘Ala, the Court Minister of the Shah, took him into his ministry
and installed him as his own deputy. [Document 2 in appendix 9 gives considerable details
about the court proceedings.]

The verdict of such a court in such an atmosphere was a foregone conclusion. All the
defendants were found guilty:
• Four of them were condemned to death: Muhammad Shirvani (a Muslim), Hasan

> Himmati, Husayn Karambakhsh, and Muhammad Rafahi—the last three being
> Baha’is from Isfandabad.
• Three of them were sentenced to ten years’ incarceration with hard labor: Hasan

> Shams (a Baha’i and member of the Spiritual Assembly of the Baha’is of
> Isfandabad), ‘Abbas-‘Ali Purmihdi (a Baha’i) and ‘Ali-Muhammad Shirvani (20-
> year-old Muslim son of Muhammad Shirvani).

76Iran’s National Spiritual Assembly suggests in its report of July 16, 1952, that the trial ended on May 12 (see
appendix 9, document 2). This appears to be in conflict with June 1952 report by Kazemzadeh (see appendix
10, account 1). For this study, this variance was settled in favor of Kazemzadeh whose report was earlier and
who was the leading defense attorney in this trial.

•   All nine members of the Spiritual Assembly of the Baha’is of Yazd were

sentences to three years’ hard labor.77

Apprising the Authorities
The Baha’i administration in Iran quickly contacted the head of the Baha’i community,
Shoghi Effendi Rabbani, who issued instructions on June 26, 1952, for the Iranian Assembly
to apprise the National Spiritual Assembly of the United States and Canada of the situation.
On July 28, the American Assembly telegraphed Dr. Musaddiq, informing him that the case
of the Baha’is falsely accused in this case was before No. 2 Division of the High Court and
requested that an audience be given to the representative of the Iranian Assembly to brief
him on the facts of the case. No evidence is known that such an opportunity was ever given
by the prime minister to the Baha’is of Iran. On September 4th of the same year, the
American Assembly contacted Dr. Pernahad, Iran’s chargé d’affaires in its Washington
embassy, and provided him with the details of the court proceedings and requested that his
office inform the authorities in Iran. Again, no evidence is known that this communication
was passed on to appropriate officials in Tehran. Yet once more, the American Assembly on
September 5, 1952, wrote a detailed letter to Dr. Musaddiq, providing him with the details of
the case, the court’s verdict, and an update on the appeal process. Once again, it appears that
this communication fell on deaf ears in Tehran.78

The Appeal79
In accordance with Iran’s criminal code, an appeal was automatic in such cases, and within a
few weeks the case dossier was sent to the High Court of Appeal. The case went before
Judge Ha’iri-Shahbaghi for review. He privately advised the defense counsels that the court
verdict in the earlier trial was wrong and had to be set aside. However, he was then pressured
by the Justice Ministry, and all he could do was to commute the death sentence of the three
Baha’is of Isfandabad to fifteen years’ imprisonment.

The Supreme Court of Iran then instructed another High Court to review the case, but
this Court procrastinated and did not convene for two years. At last, the political climate
allowed the Court to review the ruling of the lower court and to rescind some of the earlier
sentences. It ordered a new trial for five of the condemned.

The new trial by No. 2 Division of the Criminal Court started on June 13, 1954, and
lasted fourteen days. The defense team consisted of some of the lawyers who had
participated in 1952 trial: Kazem Kazemzadeh, Aziz Navidi, and ‘Abdu’llah Razi. The
prosecuting team had five lawyers on its staff. Once again, the atmosphere was charged with

77 Nikravan, “Barrasi,” states that all those incarcerated with also fined. The two brothers of Muhammad
Shirvani, namely, Ahmad Niku’i and Muhammad-Husayn Niku’i, were pardoned since they repented and
returned to Islam. This by itself demonstrates that the motive all along was religious bigotry towards Baha’is.
78 These documents were kindly furnished for this study through the kindness of the National Archives of the

National Baha’i Center and appear in appendix 9. The Persian version of these documents is published in
Afnan, Bigunahan.

anti-Baha’i sentiments and slogans, but the panel of judges seemed less susceptible to
fanatical influences.

The court ruled that the Baha’is who had been condemned to death at the 1952 trial be
given ten years’ imprisonment; one of the members of the Yazd Assembly be released since
his participation in and presence at the meetings of the Assembly had not been proven; and
the sentence of one of the accused be reduced from ten years to five years’ incarceration.

Conclusion
Muhammad Shirvani was condemned to execution, and this decree was carried out in a
public square in Yazd known as Amir-Chakhmaq. He wrote a letter to Ayatu’llah Burujirdi,
the Source of the Emulation for the Shi‘is of the world, and stated his innocence and belief
in Islam.80 However, the Ayatu’llah was consumed with the thought of destroying the
Baha’is, and it did not matter to him that Shirvani was a Muslim. What was important was
that he was to be executed in the name of Baha’is, and that this was a victory for the
protection of the Muslim congregation. For this reason, he gave no reply to the letter of this
hapless and innocent farmer.

At the time of his execution, Muhammad Shirvani faced the throng of onlookers, and
tearfully and remorsefully said with a resonant voice, “People know that I am innocent and a
Muslim.” But the conspiracy and collusion of Isfandiyar Khan and the mullas had done its
work and had robbed him of life.

Other defendants were sentenced to imprisonment with hard labor. The elderly Haji
Mirza Hasan-Shams, who was condemned to remain in prison for ten years, lasted only a
few years and died on April 5, 1955,81 after having endured immense difficulties and
tribulations in the course of his incarceration. It is said that the cause of his death was an
unsanitary surgery in prison after he had developed appendicitis.

The three innocent Baha’is of Isfandabad were imprisoned for ten years and eventually
freed in 1960. Eight members of the Spiritual Assembly of the Baha’is of Yazd were
imprisoned for three years and then were released in September 1953.

Now that we have reached the end of this brief analysis, there remains no other recourse for
any of us but to honor the memory of Sughra and her innocent and ill-fated children, as well
as the guiltless Muslims and Baha’is who suffered in this evil incident because of fanaticism
towards religious minorities.

81   Nikravan, “Barrasi,” records the date of his death as April 1, 1955.

Sources for Studying Dr. Musaddiq

We have gathered much soon to be published information regarding the relationship of Dr.
Muhammad Musaddiq with the Baha’is in particular and with Iranian political parties and
religious and tribal minorities in general. Meanwhile, the following learned and noteworthy
sources among the wide range of materials and research that has been produced about Dr.
Musaddiq are recommended:

In addition, those interested in this aspect of Iranian history may wish to peruse the
scholarly, controversial monograph by Dr. Jalal Matini, Nigahi bi Karnamih Siyasi Dr.
Muhammad Musaddiq [A glance at the political career of Dr. Muhammad Musaddiq], Los
Angeles (California): Sherkat Ketab.

The plot and elements of the coup d’état against Dr. Muhammad Musaddiq had been
hatched several months before the events of August 16th and 19th. Exactly at the same time
that the royal decree dismissing Dr. Muhammad Musaddiq was signed by Muhammad-Reza
Shah on August 13, the military plot against Dr. Musaddiq had reached its concluding
planning stages. Because of indecision and communication problems among the plotters,
when the coup was launched at midnight on August 16th, they were countered by Dr.
Musaddiq. However, the coup continued and eventually succeeded on August 19, 1953.

For the information of those who write and lament over the lack of reliable documents
regarding the 28 Murdad coup d’état or who refer to that event as an “anti-coup” incident or
as a “national uprising,” the following source can provide many documents that would cause
them to pause and contemplate the broader implications of this moment in history. This
extremely valuable collection contains the most important documents surrounding the 28
Murdad 1332 [1953] coup d’état that have been published to date by those who had a
principal role in designing and implementing the event. Based on this evidence, there is
absolutely no doubt about the interference and the key role of the United States and

England in this incident’s design and implementation of the coup up to its final success. By
reading this book, the truth surrounding the 28 Murdad coup becomes completely clear, and
one notes that without the least hesitation and with complete clarity, the principal actors in
this event have described their role and activities. This very interesting and instructive book
is Homa Katouzian, “The CIA Documents and the 1953 Coup in Iran,” in The CIA
Documents on the 1953 Coup, ed. Gholamreza Vatandoust, (Tehran: Rasa Publications, 2000),
published in English and Persian. See also, The CIA Documents & the Overthrow of Dr. Musaddiq
of Iran, ed. Gholamreza Vatandoust, (Tehran: Rasa Publications, 2000).

Appendix 2
Primary Sources on the Abarqu Incident

There is a limited-edition, 270-page book entitled, Bigunahan [The guiltless], prepared by
Muhammad-Taqi Afnan regarding the murders in Abarqu.82 We received from a
distinguished person a copy of this book, which has served as the primary source and the
foundational document for the present research monograph,

On the online site [The Democratic Voice of Iran] Khandaniha, on Sunday, February 22,
2009, “Shintou” has summarized the aforementioned book, which I have considered and
used as well. “Shintou” describes the motive for his essay as follows:

> [Several] Baha’is were accused of killing a Muslim family in Abarqu, and the judicial
apparatus during the reign of the Shah is alleged to have supported the Baha’is.

This accusation was repeated on February 11, 2009, when the Sih-Sima channel
> broadcast a program under the title “Nufuz Namar’i” [Invisible influence], which is
> part of their mini-series, “Asrar Tariki” [Dark secrets]—with an emphasis on
> “darkness.” By showing a photograph of the victims in this horrific incident, the
program sought to incite the sentiments of Iranian viewers against the Baha’is.

For this reason, the following essay will seek to clarify through exposition and
> analysis of this incident that, first, the Baha’is had no role in this murder, and,
> second, almost all of those involved from the judiciary, whether at a local or national
> level, through deception, falsification of documents, lies and misrepresentation of
> evident and undeniable facts, ruled against the Baha’is.

Based on Bigunahan, Behyar Nikravan wrote an article under the title “Barrasi Majira-yi
Azar Baha’ian Bigunah Payru Yik Qatl Khunin dar Abarqu” [Analysis of the persecution of
innocent Baha’is subsequent to a violent murder in Abarqu], which likewise explains the
reason and occasion for writing this article in such words:

> Following its widespread activities against the Baha’is during the past two years, in
> February 2006, Kayhan, Tehran’s morning newspaper, reopened the discussion of
> murders that took place 55 years ago in Iran, and ascribed them, by blatant lies, to
> Baha’is. In several issues, it has cited a manufactured case, which had the sole
> purpose of concealing the identity of the true instigators of this crime, and
persecuting and banishing the Baha’is.

At the time of this incident, they did not give any opportunity or permission to
> the Baha’is to explain to the people and in newspapers the true nature of events,
> since for some time it had been planned for the identity of the killers to remain
> secret, and for the group of wronged Baha’is, once again, be subjected to harm.
Therefore, a thoroughly untrue and slanderous story was told to the people.

Now that Kayhan has renewed the same old tired lies from a half-century ago,
> we take advantage of this opportunity to explain the true nature of the events to
> fair-minded readers.

82   This book has not been published and is only available as a typed manuscript through private hands.

Since Kayhan, and indeed all the media organs associated with the Islamic Republic, have
repeatedly published blatant lies and continue to do so, then we are forced to rely even more
on the accuracy and originality of Bigunahan by Muhammad-Taqi Afnan. The above-cited
articles are readily available to everyone outside of Iran.

Appendix 3
British Support for Shi‘i Clerics

The reader is invited to refer to the 1,362-page book Siyahat Sharq [Exploration of the East],
which is the memoir of Ayatu’llah Aqa Najafi Quchani, published in Tehran by Amir-Kabir
Press, particularly pages 575 to 608; as well as the book Iran dar Jang Buzurg [Iran in the
World War] by Ahmad-‘Ali Sipihr.

Ayatu’llah Aqa Najafi Quchani devoted many pages of his long memoir to the close
connection between Akhund Mulla Kazim Khurasani and the British. He witnessed many
long meetings between the British political envoys or high-ranking officers and Ayatu’llah
Akhund Mulla Kazim Khurasani, and provided evidence of an exchange of information and
consultation among them. Ayatu’llah Aqa Najafi Quchani also named other first-ranking
clerics who had close ties with the Russians.

It appears that Ayatu’llah Burujirdi came to the marj‘iyat [leadership] of the Shi‘i through
the direct help of the British chargé d’affaires, and the person who paved the way was
Muhammad-Reza Shah, who frequently met with him in Firuzabad Hospital. Many
photographs of these show-meetings were published in newspapers throughout the nation,
and are still available to all. At the time of these meetings, Ayatu’llah Burujirdi had not yet
attained to the leadership of the Shi‘is, and many clerics living in Iraq and Iran were qualified
from every perspective to assume the office of marja‘iyat. However, the British had full
confidence only in Burujirdi.

It is astonishing that each year the British and the Americans publish a number of
documents related to the political history of Iran. However, they have never published even
a single document about the relationship of the clerics in Iran to their intelligence services.

As an example, it might be beneficial to recall the Oudh Bequest.83 There is no doubt
that documents pertaining to this endowment, the list of names, and the amount paid to
each cleric since 1850, when it was first established, is now available in the Archives of the
British government. Although it was well known that this endowment belonged to a
governor in India, in truth it was funded by the British government to reassure the clerics
and created as a front for this purpose. In the name of this endowment, a sum was deposited
in the Bank of England in London, and from the interest earned, each year a large portion
was paid to various clerics and seminarians in the ‘Atabat and to other protégés.

To understand the crux of the matter, it is sufficient to cite the confession of a high-
ranking officer of the British Foreign Ministry: Sir Arthur H. Harding, the British
Ambassador in Iran from 1901 to 1906. In his well-known [1928] book, A Diplomat in the
East, he writes on page 324, “The right to dispense India’s Oudh Endowment in my hand
was like a lever with which I could lift any problem in Iraq and Iran, and solve those
problems.”84

83 See Litvak, “Money, Religion and Politics: The Oudh Bequest in Najaf and Karbala, 1850–1903.” Between
1850 and 1903, the Oudh Bequest channeled over six million rupees from India, through British mediation, to
the Shi‘i ‘ulama in the shrine cities of Najaf and Karbala in Iraq. The British became directly involved in the
distribution of the bequest in 1903, on the eve of the Constitutional Revolution. In view of the ‘ulama’s
growing involvement in Iranian politics and gross corruption among the distributors, the British saw the
bequest as a means to enhance their influence over the ‘ulama in Iran.
84 Translated from Persian.

In his book Dast Pinhan Siyasat Engilis dar Iran [The hidden hand of British politics in
Iran], Khan Malik Sasani has recorded his observations of long lines of mullas behind the
doors of British consulate in Iraq and other places, describing how they would wait to be
paid in cash. This book is recommended to the reader.

For more details on this theme, one should refer to the following sources:

between Iran and England], 8 volumes;

> Middle East. A close study of this controversial book can even more clearly
> explain how the Islamic Republic came to power.

The reason that the mullas accuse the Baha’is of being agents of Russia and Britain in the
past, and more recently of America and Israel, is that they wish to deflect scrutiny from
themselves because for many years they have been, and continue to be, in the pockets of
foreigners themselves. There is no need to mention the relationship of Ayatu’llah Khomeini
with foreigners while he was in exile at Neauphle-le-Château, France, since videos, pictures,
documents, and details of these connections have already been published. In accusing others
of espionage and being agents of foreigners, mullas reflect their own example of duplicity.

Appendix 4
The Killing of Dr. Berjis

On the edge of the Kavir Desert lies Kashan, an ancient city and one of the earliest sites of
human civilization. Evidence has been discovered that people were living in hills around
Kashan some 7,500 years ago. In antiquity, Iranian Jews lived in Kashan, Isfahan, and
Hamadan, and in some regions they constituted the majority of the inhabitants. With the
assault of the Arabs, newly converted to Islam, Kashan, like the rest of Iran, went to wrack
and ruin.

Kashan never was a suitable place for the Iranians because of its desolation, repeated
earthquakes, and proximity to the Kavir [great desert]. However, as a refuge from the wrath
of fanatical religious jurists, it was conducive to the spread of diverse tribes and coexistence
of followers of different religions. Until the end of the sixteenth century, Zoroastrians, Jews,
and Sunnis lived together in this city. According to the unknown author of the Hududu’l-
‘Alam [The limits of the world], “there are more scorpions” in Kashan than “literati and men
of letters.”85 Soon, many religious fanatics, who had been driven out of other Islamic
regions, came to this far-away desolate town and added to the native scorpions. Yaqut
Hamvi writes in Ma‘jamu’l-Baldan, “A number of fanatics in Kashan were waiting for their
Qa’im to appear the next morning. Each dawn, they armed themselves and rode their horses
outside of town; disappointed [over the nonappearance of the Qa’im], they returned home.”

According to the sayings and beliefs of the Babis and Baha’is, the Qa’im appeared in
1844 and was executed in Tabriz, in accordance with the fatwa of the mullas who had
seemingly been expecting him. A number of important and well-respected clerics of Kashan,
Qamsar, Maymeh, Natanz, and Naraq joined the ranks of believers in the Bab and Baha [i.e.,
Baha’u’llah]. From that time until the present, the central government has consistently
consented, through hints and allusions, to the suppression and brutal killing of the Babis and
in the last century, the Baha’is of Kashan, without any prosecution by the government or its
judicial agencies.

When Iran fell to the Allied Forces in 1941, Reza Shah was exiled and the reign of
Muhammad-Reza Shah began, and in the political and social chaos ensuing from the Cold
War in Iran, Kashan once again became the theater of operations for adventurists and
internal and external “scorpions.” I have written earlier that after the forced exit of Reza
Shah, the critique of his policies became a cornerstone of the Cold War in Iran. We should
be mindful that during the time of Reza Shah—without losing sight of his dictatorial ways—
a new middle class was created that had very different tendencies, and many widespread
reforms took place. Despite all the debates about the manner in which these reforms were
instituted—debates that are necessary, critical, and unavoidable—fundamental changes were
implemented in Iran that remain firmly in place. Even after a reactionary and brutal
revolution, thirty years of continuous bloodshed, and the feared apparatus of the vilayat faqih
[guardianship of jurists], these changes gain strength in Iranian thought. With these reforms
brought about by Reza Shah, Iran said farewell to the medieval era, and stepped into the
modern world and the new age.

85   For more details on this book, see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hudud_ul-'alam.

The following are just a few of Reza Shah’s many modernization initiatives:
consolidation of government’s power; peace with rebellious and defiant tribes; limiting the
influence of the clergy; removal of women’s veils; modernization of men’s clothing;
elimination of royal titles; mandatory military service; reduction of the feudalists’ power; the
establishment of public schools and compulsory education; founding of universities;
formation of a judiciary with modern laws; creation of the Ministry of Education, Treasury,
the Foreign Service and several other ministries; construction of a railroad across Iran
funded by taxes collected on sugar, tea, and opium; development of small businesses and
industries in Tehran and other cities. All of these will be indispensible supports for a future
parliamentary democracy to be established in Iran.

Although Reza Shah can be blamed for disregarding the Constitution, banning the
activities of political parties, carrying out certain actions that had grievous consequences in
misguided attempts to bring about social and economic reform, the murders of several
critics, and amassing vast personal wealth, one must nevertheless also confess that the
present generation cannot easily understand the reign of Reza Shah and therefore cannot
judge that era without bias. The chaotic and turbulent conditions that permitted Reza Shah
to accede to power and which led to his dictatorship were the result of centuries of despotic
rule by the monarchs and mullas in Iran. The Constitutional Period had just commenced,
and hardly anyone knew its principles or thought about following its provisions. If someone
else had come to the throne instead of Reza Shah, no doubt he too would have traversed the
same path and would have had no other remedy than to use the power of his office.

At any rate, after Reza Shah’s departure from Iran, the servants and hired hands of
imperialism, who for many years had enjoyed close relationships with the colonial powers,
came to Iran on the instruction of their masters clothed in the garments of clergymen. The
army of ignorance that had previously been arrayed in the cities of Najaf, Karbala,
Kazimayn, and Baghdad, and had been tested, was once again given a new mission.
Ayatu’llah Husayn Burujirdi took up residence in Qum and became the marja‘ of the Shi‘is.
Concurrent with his arrival in Qum, various organizations and societies with “Islamic” in
their name grew like mushrooms, first in Tehran and subsequently in other cities of Iran, and
commenced operation. Using religious funds available to him in addition to the financial and
moral aid of the government, Ayatu’llah Burujirdi provided support to all these Islamic
entities, even though he cleverly presented himself to the public as being unhappy with some
of them.

It is necessary to remember that combating and eliminating the Baha’i community was
one of the goals of these organizations and societies. Therefore, it is not surprising that in
Kashan, a town which from the early days of the Babi and Baha’i faiths has had followers of
those religions, organizations such as the Anjuman Tablighat Islami and the terrorist,
frightful Fada’iyan Islam and Hay’at Du‘at Islami were established with the support of
Ayatu’llah Husayn Burujirdi and governmental agencies. Through the financial backing of
Qum’s seminary, Ayatu’llah Burujirdi would dispatch his seminarians throughout Iran in
order to combat Baha’is, and he would ask them to preach from pulpits against the Baha’is
and to provoke and incite the people in this regard.

Burujirdi sent an akhund to Kashan by the name of Turabi, who was probably born in
Kashan. According to the testimony of residents of Kashan, he was “seditious and foul
mouthed,” and skilled in “causing the fire of agitation and rabble-rousing.” In Kashan and
its surrounding villages, many times he mounted pulpits and “fueled religious prejudice and
provoked enmity” before fleeing the scene. Using powerful loudspeakers which covered
most of the city, he would openly and directly speak slanderously and maliciously of the

Baha’is. He would defame their character, declare their blood free to spill, and use all his
power and might to deceive ignorant and superstitious people.

Simultaneous with the activities of Akhund Turabi, Shaykh Muhammad Khalisizadih, a
son of Ayatu’llah Muhammad-Mihdi Khalisi, came from Kazimayn and settled in Kashan.
From his youth, in addition to seeking religious education, he had also entertained political
ambitions. He came to Iran after Reza Shah’s departure. To mislead the gullible populace,
the British pretended that they had banished him from Tusirkan and had sent him to
Kashan. While in the latter location, he undertook many religious activities and renewed the
seminary. He gathered a large number of youth who were enamored with religious studies
and enabled them to enter into religious-political activities. Some of them were young
seminarians who were already active in the Fada’iyan Islam organization and its opposition
to the Baha’is.

Khalisizadih was an itinerant traveler and journeyed throughout Iran. He had homes in
different towns and would stay in each for a while. It is likely that his real job was to gather
news and information for the British. Otherwise, he did not have a specific occupation, and
it is not clear how one could afford such extensive travel and maintenance of several homes
without a steady income. For this reason, other mullas who could not spend as freely as he,
labeled him “Makhlutizadih” [mix-birthed, a pun on his name]. In particular, he traveled to
towns where Baha’is had congregated and would provoke ignorant and superstitious people
against the Baha’is, and incite and encourage them to persecute and kill Baha’is. He traveled
extensively to Yazd. “Basically, Khalisizadih was most determined to provoke young
seminarians and make them active. He was very charismatic. According to some accounts, in
this city [Yazd], he exerted efforts to reactivate seminaries, expanded religious endowments
and fought against the Baha’is and the Shaykhis.”

According to eyewitness accounts, “Khalisizadih routinely traveled to Kashan, and from
the pulpits would explicitly urge the fanatical and gullible people to raid the homes and
shops of Baha’is, plunder and murder them and burn their residences. He claimed that these
acts by Muslims would reap a great spiritual reward.”

Once at the pulpit he stated, “Bring out Dr. Berjis, who is the leader of the Babis, from
his office and kill him. He is an infidel and atheist. He is an impure Babi.” In this manner the
seeds of the brutal murder of Dr. Sulayman Berjis were sown.

Persecution of the Baha’is began in the villages and regions surrounding Kashan. At
night, they would cut the trees in orchards owned by Baha’is. They would steal their sheep,
burn their crops, confiscate their farms and homes, and force them to depart, dispossessed.

Every few days, people who had lost all their possessions would come to Kashan
seeking recourse and refuge. The Spiritual Assembly of the Baha’is of Kashan, which was
chaired by Dr. Berjis, wrote a letter to the chief of police, Major Fatimi, in which an account
of the wrongs perpetrated against Baha’is were recounted, warning of the dreadful
consequences for the Baha’i community that could stem from these activities and sermons.
In response to the letter, Major Fatimi said to the person bringing the letter, “Be assured that
nothing will happen.”

It is bewildering that hours after this meeting, ‘Ali Naraqi, the chief intelligence officer
of the police department, dispatched his colleague to the Baha’is with the message, “Do not
come unwarranted to the police, since we cannot prevent people from giving vent to their
religious sentiments.” The exact same behavior is now taking place across all of Iran by
those enslaved to the Islamic Republic.

The Baha’is conveyed the collaboration of the chief of police and the chief of
intelligence in Kashan with Akhund Turabi and Khalisizadih in a letter to Major-General

Zahidi, the nation’s chief of police. In this letter, they enumerated a number of instances in
which Major Fatimi and ‘Ali Naraqi collaborated with the mullas, and stated that they had
evidence suggesting the chiefs of police and intelligence of Kashan were promoting and
inciting the mullas to anti-Baha’ism, and assuring them of their protection and alliance.
Major-General Fadlu’llah Zahidi not only disregarded these reports but also in effect left the
police officers throughout the nation free to allow the mullas do as they wished. After the
August 19th coup, General Zahidi sent Mujtab Navvab Safavi, the leader of the terrorist
organization Fada’iyan Islam, to an Islamic conference with a diplomatic passport and at the
government’s expense. This was a partial payment from those behind the coup d’état to the
Fada’iyan Islam for their support of the coup.

Day by day the activities of the mullas in Kashan expanded, and the air was filled with
fear and fright. It was rumored in the city that the life of “Dr. Berjis, the leader of the
Babis,” was in danger. However, the hand of destiny wished to create a hero of this well-
regarded and reputable physician. Patiently, he awaited the divine decree. His friends warned
him that it might be best to quit the city, which, as Muhammad-Taqi Damghani has
described, had become “a nest of ruffians and thugs.” Dr. Berjis was happy and satisfied that
fate did not intend the crown of “martyrdom” to adorn his head.

Whenever he went to visit his patients, he was seen in the streets riding his horse, and
the enemies would throw rocks at him and curse and threaten him. He was severely
castigated and scolded: “Why is a Babi riding a horse?” However, he did not allow himself to
become the prisoner of the ignorant, and with patience and compassion born out of his
untroubled conscience, would continue on his way. Eventually one night, like the boorish
Mafia in The Godfather, they cut off the head of his horse in his stable. Nonetheless, he did
not allow fear to enter his being; indifferent to the evil ways of his enemies, he would walk to
visit his patients or see to the needs of the sick at his office.

Let us come to the end of the story. The fatwa for his assassination was issued. Those
selected to carry out this murder were notified and trained in what to say and what to do
after the killing. One Thursday evening, they gathered in the home of Rasulzadih, and in
accordance with the practice of the Fada’iyan Islam, engaged in reciting the Qur’an. At the
end, they consulted the Holy Book [for omens] about carrying out the murder the next day.
It appears that the decision to spill the blood of a virtuous and humanitarian physician was
reached.

Next day, Friday, February 3, 1950, two of the would-be assassins went to the office of
Dr. Berjis and pleaded with him to accompany them on a visit to an elderly woman in grave
condition. On the way, most likely, Dr. Sulayman Berjis’ chief concern was to reach the
woman in time to attend to her ills. The murderers conducted him to a home where a
customary rawdih [mourning] for Imam Husayn was under way. The news of their arrival
reached the ringleader, who came out from the rawdih session with several other offenders.
They all surrounded the town’s sole physician and told him to go inside the rawdih gathering.
The intent was to force this lover of humanity to recant his belief in the Baha’i faith. Dr.
Berjis became aware of their deceit and plans. He turned to leave. We can just imagine the
visage of this benevolent man, who was the physician of the downtrodden and the poor at
that time.

It was too late; no other recourse remained but to welcome death as decreed by fate.

The attackers descended on him and assaulted him with fists, kicks, rocks, and knives. Their
struggle continued, and they reached a house with an open door. They shoved the bloodied
and injured Dr. Berjis inside the house. After tearing him to pieces with their knives, they
threw his lifeless remains into the courtyard. The murderers were not finished, but like

vicious and hungry wolves they continued their brutality. At last, Muhammad Rasulzadih, the
chief of villains, sat on the body of Dr. Berjis, and with his knife cut his neck’s artery. Then
he cut the veins in his arm.

They left the torn and blood-soaked body of Dr. Berjis in the courtyard and came
outside, raising the cry of “There is no god but God.” They washed their evil and wicked
hands with the snow on the street.

For many years, Rasulzadih was proud that he had torn asunder the sole physician in
their town. It was time for the hyenas to boast. Years later, Ahmad Imami was jealous of
Rasulzadih’s fame and claimed, “There is no reason to credit the murder of Dr. Berjis to
Rasulzadih, since he had only brought a small knife, which after a few stabs became bent and
ineffective. I was carrying a large dagger, and it was I who cut the main artery in Dr. Berjis’
neck.” It is a bewildering time in which devoted Muslims pride themselves on holding
cleavers!

Like a flock, the people followed the murderers to Kashan’s police station. There, drunk
with their crime, they cried out, “We have killed a Baha’i!” They entered the building and
went directly to their accomplice, the chief of police, and confessed, “We have carried out
our religious duty and have sent the chief of the wayward sect of the Baha’is of Kashan to
the nether world. We are of Fada’iyan Islam.” Several months later, on September 17, 1950,
during the premiership of Razmara, the judiciary acquitted and freed the murderers who had
freely confessed to their crime.

I have always esteemed those who do not leave the evil site of battle. I have praised
them—those who outwardly appear very fragile, but when confronted with the challenges of
time, stand like brave heroes. I do not rejoice in the falling of a hero. Dr. Sulayman Berjis did
not become just a hero for the Baha’is; indeed, he became a hero for all non-Baha’i Iranians
and heterodox thinkers who cherish the wish to see a modern nation one day.

Sulayman Berjis was born into a Baha’i family. His father stepped from one minority
group, namely, the Jewish community, into another minority group, which in the eye of the
public was more dangerous than the Jews. It appears that the phrases “minority” or
“majority” did not carry any substantive meaning for him. He was happy that he had not
sacrificed his curiosity and enthusiasm for discovering the truth to the mundane matters of
daily life. One must be enthralled to become a Baha’i and not give in to the fear of being in a
minority, especially in a country that has never shown any mercy to its minorities.

In those days, after the conclusion of the trial and the release of the criminals, at a time
when moral courage and ethics in politics were forgotten and few had the audacity to speak
the truth, the freedom-loving Muslim editor of the newspaper Jahan-Ma wrote the following
in relation to the murder of Dr. Sulayman Berjis:

> [We are] committed to the principles of equity and justice, equality and oneness of
> all people before the law, and to the existence of an unprejudiced and consistent

2. The second possibility is that the justice system has once again, as in so many

The other issue is related to the spread of superstitious practices. We are under
the impression that no honorable Iranian would consent to the spilling and

The main problem confronting the mullas and fanatical Muslims is how to reconcile the
animalistic tendencies of the age of barbarism with the social morality of modern times.

For more details about the calamity of the murder of Dr. Sulayman Berjis and many
other murders during the 160 years of the Babi–Baha’i faiths, one should refer to the
enjoyable and well-documented: Fereydun Vahman, 160 Sal Mubarizih ba Diyanat Baha’i [160
Years of combat against the Baha’i faith]; and Muhammad-Taqi Damghani in his memoir,
Jamih-yi Aludih dar Aftab [Soiled garment under the sun], in addition to a description of the
brutal killing of Dr. Berjis, has left a moving account of his own life.89

Regarding the life and activities of Shaykh Muhammad Khalisizadih, one should refer to
Khatirat Ayatu’llah Khatam Yazdi [Memoirs of Ayatu’llah Khatam Yazdi], pp. 51–52; and

uneducated Shi’ites resort to cutting themselves with daggers or beating themselves senseless. It creates a most

Defense of Dr. Musaddiq at the Tribunal

One of the best sources on the trial of Dr. Musaddiq is Jalil Buzurgmihr, Musaddiq dar
Mahkamih Nizami [Musaddiq in the military tribunal], vol. 2, London: Nashr Tarikh Iran
Press, 1363 [1984]. In this source, it is noted that the defense presented by Colonel ‘Abbas-
Quli Shahquli began in the fifth session and concluded on the eighth session of the trial
when further discussions, questions, and answers about the same arguments took place.
According to the above-cited book by Jalil Buzurgmihr, we note that General Muqbili, the
presiding judge, and Azmudih, the prosecutor, greatly respected Colonel Shahquli and his
deep knowledge of the law.

Muhammad-‘Ali Muvahhid, the author of Khab Ashufteh Naft [The nightmare of oil],
published in Tehran, 1384 [2005], pp. 173–74, testifies to the skilled and the learned defense
made by Colonel Shahquli. A few aspects of the arguments presented by Colonel Shahquli in
the military tribunal are taken from Musaddiq dar Mahkamih Nizami and cited below:

1. The [military] court does not have jurisdiction over the stated charges:

> During the past several days, sufficient discussion has taken place, and the text
> of the indictment is also available. The charges are all political in nature and
> have been addressed by the Constitution and its supplementary provisions,

At that point, Colonel Shahquli alluded to the sphere and limits of the Shah’s purview, and
stated, “Basically, the point that His Majesty the Shah is authorized to pronounce such a
decree is not within the scope of this court, since none of the eminent prosecutors have the
jurisdiction to explore the limit and the rights of His Royal Majesty. This is not our job. This
is not our mission. This is a matter left for the Constitution and its supplementary laws.”

Colonel Shahquli also pointed out, “The royal decree dismissing [Dr. Musaddiq from the
premiership] is dated August 13. However, on that date the Prime Minister had not seen the
decree.”

As mentioned earlier in this monograph, the order for dismissal was issued on August
13th, but it reached Dr. Musaddiq at midnight of August 16th. Just a few hours later, the
Shah, without the knowledge of the Prime Minister Dr. Musaddiq, flew from Ramsar to
Baghdad and then to Rome. In the morning, the people were informed that the Shah,
without the government’s knowledge, had left the country, and all the newspapers printed
the news of the Shah’s escape. For details, refer to Muhammad-‘Ali Muvahhid’s Khab
Ashuftih Naft: Az Kuditay 28 Murdad ta Suqut Zahidi [The nightmare of oil: From the coup
d’état of 28 Murdad [August 19] to the fall of Zahidi], chapter 6, “The Most Significant Trial
in Iran, the Defense Proceedings of Colonel Shahquli,” pp. 173–82; or refer to Colonel Jalil
Buzurgmihr’s Musaddiq dar Mahkamih Nizami, vol. 1, pp. 204–5.

Inasmuch as we are discussing Dr. Muhammad Musaddiq, it might be of interest some to
mention his interview with a foreign reporter as evidence of his awareness and foresight. The
following was recorded on July 15, 1951, by Andre Brissaud, a French reporter:90

> Musaddiq said to me that he had been confronted by the British regarding the

> President of the United States, and the espionage efforts of various organizations
against Iran.

The Role of Ayatu’llah Burujirdi

Muhammad-Taqi Falsafi writes:

> In one of the villages of Yazd, Baha’is had massacred several Muslims. Ayatu’llah
> Burujirdi took action in this regard also to ensure that the murderers would be
> prosecuted and punished. This incident caused the people to decide to slay the
> leaders of the Baha’is, which they carried out through the killing of Dr. Berjis, a Jew
converted to Baha’i, in Kashan.

At any rate, the widespread activities of Baha’is throughout the nation and the

The actual text of this letter from Ayatu’llah Burujirdi to the preacher Falsafi is as follows:

In the Name of God, the Compassionate, the Merciful!

It is submitted to that honored person that some time ago, a letter was received

Husayn Burujirdi

92   Ayatu’llah Burujirdi misspelled naqus [bell] in the original document. (BC)

One wonders how an ecclesiastic who is the highest-ranking marja‘ of the Shi‘is could be so
hardhearted and disregard the plea of an imprisoned farmer [Shirvani], and instead send this
letter to a court preacher. Ayatu’llah Burujirdi could instead have sent a fair-minded Muslim
lawyer to Yazd to closely hear the complaints of this hapless old man, so that the death and
hanging of a wretched Muslim could have been prevented. However, he did not do so and
was content with telling lies and weaving schemes against a small religious minority group.93

Muhammad-Taqi Falsafi in chapter 5 of his memoir, and also other high-ranking clerics
who were contemporaries of Ayatu’llah Burujirdi, have recorded the activities and the
hostility they exhibited at the encouragement and urging of Ayatu’llah Burujirdi against the
Baha’is, which I will enumerate on another occasion. In short, Ayatu’llah Burujirdi and his
marja‘iyat establishment were the center of conspiracies, enmity, and difficulties for the
Baha’is and all other non-orthodox thinkers in Iran.

Fada’iyan Islam

The Fada’iyan Islam (lit. Devotees of Islam) is an extremist group and perhaps the oldest
active pressure faction in Iran. The group was formed in 1945 by Siyyid Mujtaba Mirlawhi, a
young Shi‘i seminarian, after he became deeply concerned with secularization programs
undertaken by Reza Shah.

Mirlawhi (1924–1955, Tehran) was born into a fanatical Shi‘i family. Like many others
among the orthodox, he was distressed by the influence of Ahmad Kasravi, a renowned
historian and linguist who was writing books and articles that criticized the role of Shi‘ism in
Iranian history. These concerns grew into a fatwa by senior Shi‘i clerics, who condemned
Kasravi to death—it is said that Ruhu’llah Khomeini approved this fatwa. In May 1945,
Mirlawhi attempted to assassinate Kasravi, but only wounded him. Mirlawhi was imprisoned
for a short time, and from prison he organized the Fada’iyan Islam to fight Shi‘i causes. A
year later, in May 1946, the Fada’iyan Islam succeeded in assassinating Kasravi. Its agents
were acquitted shortly after their capture.

Over the next several years, Mirlawhi developed a close relationship with Ayatu’llah
Abdu’l-Qasim Kashani. He also started the newspaper Parcham Islam [Flag of Iran] and
adopted the nom de guerre of Navvab Safavi.

In early 1949, the Fada’iyan Islam commenced a large-scale assassination campaign. The
first target was the young Shah of Iran, but an attempt on his life at the University of Tehran
in February 1949 was unsuccessful. Shortly thereafter, Husayn Imani, a member of the
Fada’iyan, was able to assassinate Abdu’l-Husayn Hazhir, a former prime minister, in central
Tehran. On March 7, 1951, Prime Minister ‘Ali Razmara was assassinated in Tehran’s Shah
Mosque by the same extremist group. The assassin, Khalil Tahmassbi, however, won an
acquittal. After Musaddiq’s regime, in 1952–53 the Fada’iyan renewed their terrorist
activities. An unsuccessful attempt on the life of Prime Minister Husayn ‘Ala in November
1955, however, ended this phase. In retaliation, the government executed Mirlawhi and four
of the Fada’iyan’s leaders on January 18, 1956.

The loss of Mirlawhi was a serious blow to the organization, but the Fada’iyan
continued to function underground. They reappeared in the early 1960s when Khomeini

began his public opposition to the Shah. Operating under the name of Jami‘ih Motalifih
Islami [the Islamic Coalition Association], operatives assassinated Prime Minister Hasan-‘Ali
Mansur in January 1965. Even after Khomeini’s exile, the Fada’iyan continued close contact
with him. They distributed tape cassettes of Khomeini’s sermons and writings, and thus
endeared themselves to future revolutionary figures.

In 1978, the Fada’iyan came out in the open as supporters of Khomeini. Ayatu’llah
Sadiq Khalkhali, a close associate of Khomeini and a member of the group since his
seminary days, became head of the Fada’iyan in May 1979. Under his leadership, the
Fada’iyan launched a terrorist campaign against Khomeini’s enemies. As soon as Khomeini
consolidated power in Iran, Khalkhali became chairman of the Revolutionary Courts.
However, his brutality earned him such a reputation that he alienated even his supporters,
and he was deposed in December 1980. By then, Khomeini had gained complete ascendancy
in Iran, and in 1981 the Fada’iyan formally disbanded.

The group reappeared during the Khatami regime in the late 1990s. President
Muhammad Khatami came to power as a moderate with the idea of reform. His initiative to
open dialogue with the West in 1998 caused the defunct Fada’iyan to revitalize. This time the
driving force was anti-Americanism. Besides threatening and carrying out attacks on
Americans, the leaders of the Fada’iyan turned their attention to moderates. Two victims,
husband and wife Darius Furuhar and Parvanih Iskandari, were murdered in Tehran in
November 1998. Other murders followed that had the Fada’iyan trademark. Evidence exists
that Iranian intelligence services had a hand in the resurrection of the Fada’iyan, but the
suspected leader of the group, Sa’id Imami, allegedly committed suicide in prison on June 19,
1999\. A subsequent investigation uncovered little information, but enough found its way to
the media to discredit several of the top intelligence leaders, which led to several key
resignations.

Appeals to the Shah and Clerics

The following are texts of two important documents by the National Spiritual Assembly of
the Baha’is of the United States and Canada to the government and the clerical establishment
in Iran, which documents are of significant importance in understanding the genesis of anti-
Baha’ism in that country.

Deeply worried about the condition of the Baha’is in Iran, the American Assembly on
July 16, 1926, addressed a detailed letter to Reza Shah Pahlavi appealing for government
protection for this religious group. Though this text is available elsewhere,94 it is reproduced
here as Document 1 for ease of reference and for a fuller appreciation of the historical
background of events described in this monograph.

After this letter was sent, the situation of the Baha’is of Iran, however, continued to
worsen; and when a prominent Baha’i was killed in Ardabil, another appeal was sent, this
time to the Muslim ecclesiastics in Iran. The Persian text of this letter has kindly been
provided by the National Archives of the United States Baha’i National Center and appears
below in translation as document 2.

Document 1: An Appeal Addressed to Reza Shah Pahlavi
Reza Shah Pahlavi, His Imperial Majesty,
Imperial Palace, Tihran, Persia.

Your Majesty:
Moved by the cruel persecutions being inflicted upon the Baha’is of Persia, we address this
petition to the supreme authority of that land, confident that when all the facts are
assembled, the conditions realized and the consequences understood, your Majesty will
straightaway initiate whatever measures are necessary to terminate this long and frightful
chapter of unmerited woe.

Recent Cases of Murder and Pillage
The latest example of the extreme suffering endured by Persian Baha’is, brought to our
attention through sources of unquestionable accuracy, was in the outbreak of public violence
which took place in the town of Jahrum on April 7th last. On that day eight Baha’is were
tortured and slain under circumstances of unbelievable brutality. The names of these
innocent victims are: Siyyid Husayn Ruhani, Ostad ‘Abbas, Muhammad Kazim, Muhammad
Hassan, Muhammad Shafi, Mashhadi ‘Abbas, Ostad Muhammad Hassan, and Muhammad
Riza. In addition to those murdered outright, many others were severely wounded, and some
twenty homes overrun and looted or burned to ground. Among the atrocious acts
committed in the same town we must record also the slaughter of Baha’i women in the most
shameful manner and the cutting into pieces of the body of a Baha’i child by the pitiless
criminal’s knife.

94   The Baha’i World, vol. 2, pp. 287–94. The text reproduced here has been slightly edited.

The survivors of such fanatical outbreaks are perhaps more deeply to be pitied even than
those who suffered martyrdom by fire and sword. Against them are closed all doors of
mercy, of justice, even of the most elemental human association in any form. The civil
authorities deny them the rights and privileges of the law of the land and all protection of
local and provincial courts; the chiefs of Islam pronounce association with them a violation
of the principles of the religion of Muhammad; they are prevented from having access to
shops which supply the daily necessities of existence; their homes, their property, and their
persons are abandoned to the will of the insane mob or of the worst criminal element in the
community. Such are the conditions existing today in the town of Maraghih, in the province
of Adhirbayjan, of your realm.

To recount the sufferings of the Persian Baha’is in detail, hundreds of pages would be
required. Sufficient for the moment, to state that twenty of these unfortunate people have
been slain within the past few weeks, while three were murdered during the previous year,
with fanatical outbreaks more particularly in the towns of Qamsar and Faran and the
provinces of Fars, Yazd, and Khurasan. The anti-Baha’i incidents preceding the assassination
of Vice-Consul Major Robert W. Imbrie in the streets of Tihran are becoming well known to
the American people, through the extensive newspaper publicity following that unhappy but
significant case.

If the slightest doubt should arise as to the number or grave character of these anti-
Baha’i outrages in Persia, we are prepared to file the complete record with any suitable
authority your Majesty may care to name. The essence of the matter is this: at this very hour,
under your Majesty’s rule, just as has been the case for more than eighty years under
preceding sovereigns, the life of a Baha’i in Persia is bereft of all those sanctions and
guarantees which are written into the law of every civilized nation, and adhered to as a moral
code even by peoples who have not developed to the state of formal law. The Persian
Baha’is at any moment are subject to such shameful violence as hunters would not inflict
upon beasts of prey.

The astonishing record of the martyrdoms undergone by the Bab and His followers, and
by those who later acknowledged the spiritual leadership of Baha’u’llah, is extant in the
libraries of America and Europe in the works of well-known scholars such as the late
Professor Browne of Cambridge University, the late Baron Rosen of Petrograd, and Comte
de Gobineau of France. The leading humanitarians and independent thinkers of the West are
cognizant of the fact that in Persia during the past eighty years there has occurred the most
heroic expression of the religious spirit which has glorified humanity for hundreds, perhaps
for thousands of years. Animated by invincible faith, more than twenty thousand men,
women and children have during that period of time voluntarily yielded up their lives to
promote the Cause of Baha’u’llah.

Religious Freedom Guaranteed
If from local and provincial authorities, and from the religious leaders as well, the general
justification has been attempted that the Baha’is individually and collective are dangerous to
the public welfare and their extermination a service to the people and state, we must be
permitted to ask by what authority has their case been tried? Under what condition has it
been established beyond the right of appeal, that a Baha’i as such is synonymous with a vital
menace to Persia—nay, apparently, a menace to mankind? For every species of criminal, no
matter how vile, the law assigns methods of trial and degrees of punishment. When did the
supreme court of Persia, despite the fact that religious freedom is guaranteed by the Persian
Constitution, make an exception in the case of the Baha’is?

We know full well that according to the universal standards of morality, the Persian
Baha’is are not merely the peers, they are indisputably the superiors, of their fellow
countrymen. The Persian Baha’is are truthful and industrious. They are progressive and
public spirited. They value highly the benefits of scientific and industrial as well as cultural
and religious education. They recognize the equality of men and women. They are bound by
the explicit text of their religion to be loyal to the head of their national government and to
take part in no movements of sedition. Since the individual Baha’i cannot be condemned
according to the prevailing moral or civil standard, and the Baha’is collectively cannot be
proven ever to have arisen against the government, it must be that those responsible for
their persecution assert that the Baha’i Faith itself, independent of the lives and actions of its
adherents, contains some dreadful taint, some mysterious evil, the stamping out of which is
required by Divine law!

Should this specious vindication be put forward—this condoning of theft, arson, pillage,
torture and murder on the part of the officials and clergy as though sanctioned by the Will of
God—then we assert that either no effort has been made by its enemies to understand the
principles of the Faith, or those who occupy the seats of religious authority in Persia can no
longer discriminate between right and wrong, good and evil, truth and falsehood.

Baha’i Principles and Doctrines
The principles and doctrines of the Baha’i Cause are not subject to changing interpretation
according to individual caprice or the self-interest of any special group. These teachings are
to be found in the writings of Baha’u’llah, together with the interpretations of ‘Abdu’l-
Baha—and exist in no other source. For the sake of brevity, ‘Abdu’l-Baha summarized the
essential objects and teachings of the Faith as follows:

[See appendix A at the conclusion of this letter.]
Brief though it be, the foregoing statement of the principles and doctrines of the Baha’i
Faith is quite sufficient to reveal its comprehensive character, its noble purpose, and its pure
spirit. What conscientious minister or priest of any religion; what statesman of any country;
what responsible man of affairs; what scientist or thinker, could assert that loyalty to such
teachings threatens the true welfare of any person or group? By what logic can these
principles be claimed a form of heresy to any Divine law or treason to any just government?

Nevertheless, the Persians themselves, save only the Persian Baha’is, still ignore the
greatness that came into their midst, repudiate the principles of true progress and civilization
so lovingly offered them, and even decide that the followers of this Faith, irrespective of
their personal morality and civic virtue, are deserving of the most implacable hate, the most
relentless hostility, the most inhuman death!

Outline of Baha’i History
To consider now the circumstances under which Persia gave birth to a Cause destined to
influence the entire world: On May 23, 1844, a youth of the pure lineage of Muhammad
arose in Shiraz and proclaimed a new spiritual mission. This personage, known as the Bab,
based His mission upon truth and fact in exact conformity with the Qur’an of the Prophet
Muhammad. The essence of the Bab’s teaching was that He proclaimed the coming of One
who would be the World Educator foretold in all the Holy Books. He asserted that true
loyalty to the Prophet must now consist in awaiting the coming of that One and in
preparations for loyalty and obedience to Him. This proclamation produced an immediate
far-reaching effect in Persia, attracting many thousands of faithful souls but also creating
frantic opposition among the leaders of Islam. Their hatred, in alliance with the power of the

government in Tihran, brought about the martyrdom of this radiant Spirit at Tabriz, July 9,
1850\.

Far from extinguishing the light of this new Faith, the cruel execution of the Bab resulted
in a great increase in the number and loyalty of His adherents. As the ecclesiastics continued
to inflame the civil authorities and the ignorant populace, scenes of indescribable barbarism
took place in the public streets and squares of cities and towns throughout the land.
Thousands of helpless, inoffensive men, women, and children perished under the sword of
the executioner, or the knives, stones, and clubs of the maddened mob. Some of these
Baha’is were blown from the mouth of cannon; others were scourged through crowded
streets and, as in the case of the glorious martyr Sulayman Khan, lit candles placed in their
bleeding wounds. Thus was paid the price of a new spirit of hope and love brought to earth
in this age!

No attention need any longer be paid to that apparent confusion in the internal affairs of
the Cause of God following the Bab’s martyrdom. His followers needed and sought a leader
able to unite their moral forces, instruct their minds, and point out their spiritual duties
under the difficult conditions obtaining throughout the country. Several claimants arose, but
He who alone fulfilled the conditions and met the opportunities was Mirza Husayn ‘Ali,
eldest son of a family of exalted rank in the realm, known to history as Baha’u’llah.

Baha’u’llah offered Himself as the target for all the blows aimed at the helpless Babis;
assumed all responsibility as their leader in the eyes of the government; was imprisoned
under heavy chains for their sake in Tihran; bastinadoed, stripped of property and rights,
banished to Baghdad with His family; then successively exiled to Constantinople, to
Adrianople, and finally condemned to life imprisonment in the barracks of pestilential ‘Akka,
the Turkish penal colony, situated at the foot of Mount Carmel in Palestine [now Israel].

The rulers of Persia and of Turkey were associated together in this sentence of exile and
imprisonment, acting to put down a movement whose inner power they recognized but
whose meaning they could not understand. But the spiritual mission of Baha’u’llah could not
be eclipsed by any material opposition. Serenely, under the shadow of death, He completed
the Book of His religion, and while suffering the treatment of slaves and criminals, predicted
the overthrow of both those dynasties conspiring against His Cause. And, as your Majesty so
well knows, that which He foretold has come to pass. Students of the Christian and Jewish
Scriptures who have become cognizant of the facts concerning the exile and imprisonment
of Baha’u’llah recognize that these events fulfill their most glorious prophecy, even as the
martyrdom of the Bab fulfilled the prophecy of the Qur’an.

Who, even now, can read unmoved the noble words uttered by Baha’u’llah in the famous
letters sent forth from His prison to Sultan and the Shah?

[See appendix B at the conclusion of this letter.]
> As history has recorded, these letters were written more than fifty years ago.

Today, the Epistles and Books of Baha’u’llah are held in grateful reverence by uncounted
thousands of devoted followers throughout the world. In them they have found a source of
unity and fellowship overcoming every difference of creed, language, custom, and tradition.
The Books of Baha’u’llah create in hearts the reality of human oneness and the spirit of
peace, burning away the veils of indifference, misunderstanding, antagonism. and fear. They
uphold the doctrine of the oneness of God in its universality by revealing the identical
mission and power in the origin of all the religions. They bring new assurance as to the
mercy and love of God for man, and new confirmation of man’s spiritual destiny. The
essence of all the Holy Books of the past returns in this Word, stripped of those particular
allusions and expressions inevitable under the restrictions of former times. Whoever truly

loves any Manifestation of God, whether Muhammad, Moses, Zoroaster or Christ, will
surely turn to Baha’u’llah in joyous devotion, as to the only One capable of bringing his most
cherished ideals to fruition in this unsettled, dangerous yet glorious age.

Foremost among those who have served the Cause of Baha’u’llah and increased the
proofs of its spiritual truth, is His eldest son, ‘Abdu’l-Baha.

It was as a child of eight years that ‘Abdu’l-Baha began to walk in the path of that Light.

From city to city and from prison to prison He accompanied Baha’u’llah, taught only by
Him, inspired by Him to continue the mission when the physical body of Baha’u’llah must at
length be no more. Yet, though confinement and oppressive hardship had been His lot for
more than fifty years, when ‘Abdu’l-Baha journeyed through Europe and America there was
not one to match the ardor of his humanitarian service, nor the penetration of His mind into
the essential problems of human life. His voice most clearly sounded the call of religious
unity and brotherhood—His warning most courageously foretold the coming World War
and pointed out what steps must be taken to avert a complete overthrow of civilization, East
and West.

He came not as the representative of any institution, the exponent of any creed, the
ambassador of any nation, the defender of any race. Rather did this Personage come as one
sent from the very Kingdom of God, and His thoughts, manners, purpose and methods—
above all, His intense love for every fellow-man—reflected to humanity the conditions of a
higher realm. Though limited human beings cannot honor One from the world of Spirit,
nevertheless even according to ordinary standards, such honor was bestowed upon ‘Abdu’l-
Baha as no Persian ever received in the Occident during the memory of man.

By reason of the predominance of Greek thought upon modern education in the West,
Persia for hundreds of years has been viewed through the eyes of Greek historians and
writers, with the result that your Majesty’s nation and people have been victims of instinctive
prejudice. By many, Persia would be associated with the idea of complete decadence and
corruption, while others would recall the menace of military invasion prevented by the
famous victories of Salamis and Marathon. In addition to this burden of prejudice, Persia has
also suffered grievously from the antagonism felt by many Christian leaders for every
Muslim country. Before ‘Abdu’l-Baha journeyed to the West, it would have been difficult
even to imagine any influence powerful enough to lift this burden from Persia and replace
long-established contempt with sympathy and respect.

Persia Honored in the West
But in ‘Abdu’l-Baha, Europe and America learned to honor Persia as the source of true
wisdom and love. Were the Persian people aware of what He accomplished on their behalf,
they would hasten to raise monuments in His name and seek to acquaint themselves with
His truth. Instead of that, the Persians, like wolves, are actually tearing to pieces those
among them who testify that Baha’u’llah and ‘Abdu’l-Baha lived only to serve mankind. One
of the teachings of Baha’u’llah definitely attributes special glory to Persia as the center of
devotion for Baha’is of all lands. Should not all patriotic Persians appreciate this as the
greatest tribute ever paid to their land?

The journey undertaken by ‘Abdu’l-Baha throughout the United States in 1912 assumes
year by year a larger meaning and a profounder importance. During this journey the great
Exemplar of the Baha’i Faith turned the clear, radiant light of His spiritual wisdom upon the
complexity of Western civilization. He made contact with all our problems, conditions, and
opportunities. Appreciating those memorable days, His American followers took steps to
record permanently the addresses delivered by ‘Abdu’l-Baha in churches, synagogues,

universities, and other important institutions. The record of His journey survived in two
volumes, published under the title suggested by Him: The Promulgation of Universal Peace. To
read these words is to find is to find the very essence of the solution of the sinister problems
of war and peace, capital and labor, church and state, science and religion, so gravely
menacing the world at this time.

Since ‘Abdu’l-Baha is the only Persian whose addresses to the West have gained wide
influence and fame; and since it would be impossible to appreciate the full influence and
meaning of the Baha’i Faith apart from these two volumes, we take the liberty, your Majesty,
of presenting copies of them to you in connection with this petition. Lack of space prevents
us from informing you of another work of ‘Abdu’l-Baha wherein He deals specifically with
the condition of Persia and suggests suitable methods and measures by which the Persian
people can regain their ancient, their rightful position of eminence among the peoples of the
world. A translation of this work has been published both in England and America;
doubtless we can furnish a copy in the original Persian tongue, should we receive a request
for the same.

‘Abdu’l-Baha passed from this world in 1921, a Light of international friendship and
understanding that shall never die. Perhaps another decade must elapse before His wisdom
becomes the source of inspiration of the majority of responsible statesmen and thinkers, but
the outcome does not stand in doubt. Already a host of grateful people in the all countries
acknowledge His spiritual guidance, unified in the one world-movement raised above the
reach of economic, political, or religious factions. In Persia alone, the ranks of the Baha’is
today include a considerable section of the population—especially among the most
progressive minds—therefore one can appreciate the spiritual power able to make these
people prefer death to violent resistance and human revenge. Let none believe that it has
been through fear or weakness that the Baha’is of your realm have submitted to the injustice
we have mentioned. They have entrusted their lives to God, and who dare assert that they
have trusted in vain?

The following words written by ‘Abdu’l-Baha in a letter to American Baha’is nearly
twenty years ago refer most significantly to Persia and its conditions:

[See appendix C at the conclusion of this letter.]

Conditions Indicate Anarchy
We have referred to the long period of time over which these dire persecutions have been
spread. We have indicated also that the original antagonism for the Babis and their
successor, the Baha’is, emanated not from the mass of the people but from the chiefs of
religion and state. Without their deliberate provocation and example, the people would never
have become inflamed with the insane spirit of fanaticism and bloodshed. But once this
dreadful example was set, the people throughout the land were quick to learn that one could
rob, insult, strike, torture, and slay a Baha’i with impunity—nay, even with the approval of
those in local positions of power. Therefore, by all too logical steps, conditions in Persia
have come to the point where, if public agitation is wanted for purpose, or ambitious leaders
desire to divert attention from an issue, all that is necessary is for them to raise a hue and cry
against the Baha’is, and behind the smoke of violence the agitators can work unseen. The
condition is one of moral and civic anarchy, and if prolonged must seep higher and higher
into the structure of the central government until at last the supreme executive, to maintain
himself, must become little better than a bandit chief. A patriot like your Majesty, who
understands the basis of national order and stability, has surely viewed this problem of local

government as one of supreme concern for the progress, for the very existence of the
Persian state.

Very humbly, and as true friends of Persia, we suggest that the question of the Baha’is of
your realm has become a vital issue no longer to be postponed or entrusted to prejudiced or
incompetent hands. For the cruel treatment being inflicted upon this innocent people is
becoming the cause of absolute anarchy and disregard of law. Not until your loyal Baha’i
subjects receive full justice and protection will these negative forces be successfully resisted,
which will otherwise lead to the total disintegration of civilized customs, manners, and
forms. When the supreme authority of Persia today reverses the example its predecessors set
over seventy years ago, and protects the Baha’is resolutely instead of condoning their
persecution, then at last can the process of anarchy and disintegration be checked, and the
national government, the sole hope of any people, be placed on foundations able to endure.

It may well be that the case of the Persian Baha’is has become a vital issue in another
direction as well.

Menace to Persia’s Economic Development
Aware of the explicit statements made by ‘Abdu’l-Baha concerning the future of the
relations between East and West, the Baha’is of the United States and Canada have long
watched with the greatest interest the signs of an increasing intimacy between North
America and Persia. We have felt keenly the need for cordial association and mutual spirit of
cooperation between these two lands and peoples, in order to offset by an example of
international justice and true morality the grievous effects of that previous contact of East
and West so frequently founded on national or sectional greed. Is it not evident that Persia
would benefit by direct financial cooperation from this country—enterprises of a non-
political character intended to develop the natural resources of that economically
undeveloped land? But the consummation of any plan of financial cooperation between our
people and Persians is impossible until real stability has been effected in Persia itself, and
those processes of justice and security have been realized which are absolutely necessary as
guarantees that large economic developments can succeed. We have direct knowledge of one
important enterprise recently abandoned by American interests for lack of these guarantees.

But such considerations are entirely secondary to our essential purpose, of requesting
protection and justice for the Persian Baha’is on purely spiritual grounds. No other purpose
could have induced us to take this unusual step of addressing a petition directly to a head of
state. It is because all the circumstances are extraordinary, and the issues supremely
important, that we felt compelled to disregard ordinary custom and place this petition
directly in your Majesty’s hands. The news of your accession to the throne gave us great
hope that Persia had now been blessed with a ruler not only firm but imbued with modern
standards and ideals. We feel certain that your Majesty will appreciate the gravity of the case
and determine to uphold the full responsibility of your exalted position as the founder of a
new dynasty by hastening to suppress conditions of terror long crying to Divine Justice for
amends.

Baha’i Literature Confiscated
We express the hope that your Majesty will also decide that no useful end can any longer be
served by the confiscation of Baha’i magazines, literature, and correspondence sent to Persia
from this country, or by the banning of photographs of ‘Abdu’l-Baha. It is such imperial
regulations which serve indirectly to justify the atrocities committed by your subjects upon
the Baha’is.

We await your Majesty’s assurance that our respectful appeal has achieved its aim. Our
love for these oppressed Baha’i brothers and sisters makes it imperative that we continue our
efforts to rescue them from their sea of calamity, until assured that henceforth they shall be
protected by the full power of the Imperial Government, and just restitution made them for
losses already sustained.

We transmit this petition in behalf of the Baha’i Spiritual Assemblies of the United States
and Canada as follows: Berkeley, Geyserville, Glendale, Los Angeles, Oakland, Pasadena,
San Francisco, and Visalia, California; Montreal, Quebec, Canada; Denver, Colorado; New
Haven, Connecticut; Washington, D.C.; Miami, Florida; Honolulu, Hawaiian Islands; Chicago

Appendix A
Summary of Baha’i Teachings

The Oneness of the World of Humanity
“Baha’u’llah addresses Himself to the world of man saying: ‘Ye are all the leaves of one tree
and the fruits of one orchard.’ That is, the world of existence is no other than one tree, and
the nations or peoples are like unto the different branches or limbs thereof, and human
individuals are similar to the fruits and blossoms thereof…while in all past religious books
and epistles, the world of humanity has been divided into two parts: one called the ‘people of
the Book’ or the ‘pure tree’, and the other the ‘evil tree.’ One-half of the people of the world
were looked upon as belonging to the irreligious and the infidel; one-half of the people were
consigned to the mercy of the Creator, and the other half were considered as objects of the
wrath of their Maker. But Baha’u’llah proclaimed the oneness of the world of humanity—
He submerged all mankind in the sea of divine generosity.
Independent Investigation of Truth
“No man should follow blindly his ancestors and forefathers. Nay, each must see with his
own eyes, hear with his own ears, and investigate truth in order that he may find the truth;

whereas the religion of forefathers and ancestors is based upon blind imitation—man should
investigate the truth.
The Foundation of All Religions Is One
“The foundation underlying all the divine precepts is one reality. It must needs be reality, and
reality is one, not multiple. Therefore the foundation for the divine religions is one. But we
can see that certain forms have come in, certain imitations of forms and ceremonials have
crept in. They are heretical, they are accidental, because they differ; hence they cause
differences amongst religions. But if we set aside these imitations and seek the reality of the
foundation we shall all agree, because religion is one and not multiple.
Religion Must Be the Cause of Unity Among Mankind
“Every religion is the greatest divine effulgence, the cause of life amongst men, the cause of
the honor of humanity, and is productive of life-everlasting amongst humankind. Religion is
not for enmity or hatred. It is not for tyranny or injustice. If religion be the cause of enmity
and rancor, if it should prove the cause of alienating men, assuredly non-religion would be
better. For religion and the teachings which appertain to it are as a course of treatment. What
is the object of any course of treatment? It is cure and healing. But if the outcome of a
course of treatment should be productive of mere diagnosis and discussion of symptoms,
the abolition of it is evidently preferable. In this sense, abandoning religions would be a step
toward unity.
Religion Must Be in Accord with Science and Reason
“Religion must be reasonable; it must agree perfectly with science, so that science shall
sanction religion and religion sanction science. The two must be brought together,
indissolubly, in reality. Down to the present day it has been customary for man to accept a
thing because it was called religion, even though it were not in accord with human reason.
Equality Between Men and Women
“This is peculiar to the teachings of Baha’u’llah, for all former religious systems placed men
above women. Daughters and sons must follow the same form of study and the same
education. Having one course of education promotes unity among mankind.
Abandonment of All Prejudices
“It is established that all the Prophets of God have come to unite the children of men and
not to disperse them, and to put in action the law of love and not enmity. Consequently we
must throw aside all these prejudices—the racial prejudice, the patriotic prejudice, the
religious and political prejudices. We must become the cause of unity of the human race.
Universal Peace
“All men and nations shall make peace. There shall be universal peace amongst religions,
universal peace amongst races, universal peace amongst the denizens of all regions. Today in
the world of humanity the most important matter is the question of universal peace. The
realization of this principle is the crying need of the time.
Universal Education
“All mankind should partake of both knowledge and education, and this partaking of
knowledge and of education is one of the necessities of religion. The education of each child
is obligatory. If there are no parents, the community must look after the child.

Solution of the Economic Problem
“No religious books of the past Prophets speak of the economic question, while this
problem has been thoroughly solved in the teachings of Baha’u’llah.…Certain regulations are
revealed which insure the welfare and well-being of all humanity. Just as the rich man enjoys
his rest and his pleasures surrounded by luxuries, the poor man must likewise have a home,
be provided with sustenance, and not be in want.…Until this is effected, happiness is
impossible. All are equal in the estimation of God; their rights are one and there is no
distinction for any soul; all are protected beneath the justice of God.
A Universal Language
“An international auxiliary language shall be adopted which shall be taught by all the schools
and academies of the world. A committee appointed by national bodies shall select a suitable
language to be used as a means of international communication, and that language shall be
taught in all the schools of the world in order that everyone shall need but two languages, his
national tongue and the international auxiliary language. All will acquire the international
auxiliary language.
An International Tribunal
“A universal tribunal under the power of God, under the protection of all men, shall be
established. Each one must obey the decisions of this tribunal, in order to arrange the
difficulties of every nation.

“About sixty years ago Baha’u’llah commanded the people to establish universal peace
and summoned all the nations to the ‘divine banquet of international arbitration’ so that the
questions of boundaries, of national honor and property and of vital interests between
nations might be decided by an arbitral court of justice.
“Remember, these precepts were given more than half a century ago. At that moment no
one spoke of universal peace, nor of any of the principles; but Baha’u’llah proclaimed them
to all the sovereigns of the world.…They are the spirit of this age, the light of this age; they
are the well-being of this age.”

Appendix B
Excerpts from Letters of Baha’u’llah to the Sultan of Turkey and the Shah of Persia

(Fifty Years Ago)

To the ruler of Persia, Baha’u’llah wrote, in part, as follows:95

“O King! I adjure thee by thy Lord, the All-Merciful, to look upon thy servants with the
glances of the eye of thy favour, and to treat them with justice, that God may treat thee with
mercy. Potent is thy Lord to do as He pleaseth. The world, with all its abasement and glory,
shall pass away, and the kingdom will remain unto God, the Most Exalted, the All-Knowing.

“Say: He hath kindled the lamp of utterance, and feedeth it with the oil of wisdom and
understanding. Too high is thy Lord, the All-Merciful, for aught in the universe to resist His
Faith. He revealeth what He pleaseth through the power of His sovereign might, and

95This section quotes passages from the writings of Baha’u’llah that are now available in a better translations,
and these more accurate translations are instead cited in this segment.

protecteth it with a host of His well-favoured angels. He is supreme over His servants and
exerciseth undisputed dominion over His creation. He, verily, is the All-Knowing, the All-
Wise.

“O King! I was but a man like others, asleep upon My couch, when lo, the breezes of
the All-Glorious were wafted over Me, and taught Me the knowledge of all that hath been.
This thing is not from Me, but from One Who is Almighty and All-Knowing. And He bade
Me lift up My voice between earth and heaven, and for this there befell Me what hath caused
the tears of every man of understanding to flow. The learning current amongst men I studied
not; their schools I entered not. Ask of the city wherein I dwelt, that thou mayest be well
assured that I am not of them who speak falsely.…

“The Pen of the Most High addresseth Me, saying: Fear not. Relate unto His Majesty
the Shah that which befell thee. His heart, verily, is between the fingers of thy Lord, the God
of Mercy, that haply the sun of justice and bounty may shine forth above the horizon of his
heart. Thus hath the decree been irrevocably fixed by Him Who is the All-Wise.

“Look upon this Youth, O King, with the eyes of justice; judge thou, then, with truth
concerning what hath befallen Him. Of a verity, God hath made thee His shadow amongst
men, and the sign of His power unto all that dwell on earth. Judge thou between Us and
them that have wronged Us without proof and without an enlightening Book. They that
surround thee love thee for their own sakes, whereas this Youth loveth thee for thine own
sake, and hath had no desire except to draw thee nigh unto the seat of grace, and to turn
thee toward the right hand of justice. Thy Lord beareth witness unto that which I declare.…

“Amongst the people are those who allege that this Youth hath had no purpose but to
perpetuate His name, whilst others claim that He hath sought for Himself the vanities of the
world—this, notwithstanding that never, throughout all My days, have I found a place of
safety, be it to the extent of a single foothold. At all times have I been immersed in an ocean
of tribulations, whose full measure none can fathom but God. He, truly, is aware of what I
say. How many the days in which My loved ones have been sorely shaken by reason of My
afflictions, and how many the nights during which My kindred, fearing for My life, have
bitterly wept and lamented! And this none can deny save them that are bereft of truthfulness.
Is it conceivable that He Who expecteth to lose His life at any moment should seek after
worldly vanities? How very strange the imaginings of those who speak as prompted by their
own caprices, and who wander distractedly in the wilderness of self and passion! Erelong
shall they be called upon to account for their words, and on that day they shall find none to
befriend or help them.

“And amongst the people are those who claim that He hath disbelieved in God—yet
every member of My body testifieth that there is none other God but Him; that those
Whom He hath raised up in truth and sent forth with His guidance are the Manifestations of
His most excellent names, the Revealers of His most exalted attributes, and the Repositories
of His Revelation in the kingdom of creation; that through them the Proof of God hath
been perfected unto all else but Him, the standard of Divine Unity hath been raised, and the
sign of sanctity hath been made manifest; and that through them every soul hath found a
path unto the Lord of the Throne on high. We testify that there is none other God but Him,
that from everlasting He was alone with none else besides Him, and that He shall be unto
everlasting what He hath ever been. Too high is the All-Merciful for the hearts of those who
have recognized Him to apprehend His true nature, or for the minds of men to hope to
fathom His essence. He verily is exalted above the understanding of anyone besides Himself,
and sanctified beyond the comprehension of all else save Him. From all eternity He hath
been independent of the entire creation.…

“I swear by God, O King! Wert thou to incline thine ear to the melodies of that
Nightingale which warbleth in manifold accents upon the mystic bough as bidden by thy
Lord, the All-Merciful, thou wouldst cast away thy sovereignty and set thy face towards this
Scene of transcendent glory, above whose horizon shineth the Book of the Dawntide, and
wouldst expend all that thou possessest in thine eagerness to obtain the things of God.…Of
what avail are the things which are yours today and which tomorrow others shall possess?
Choose for thyself that which God hath chosen for His elect, and God shall grant thee a
mighty sovereignty in His Kingdom. We beseech God to aid thy Majesty to hearken unto
that Word whose radiance hath enveloped the whole world, and to protect thee from such as
have strayed far from the court of His presence….”96

“We further beseech Him to make of this darksome tribulation a shield for the Temple
of His Cause, and to protect it from the assault of sharpened swords and pointed daggers.
Adversity hath ever given rise to the exaltation of His Cause and the glorification of His
Name. Such hath been God’s method carried into effect in centuries and ages past.…Could
the people but taste that choice Wine of the mercy of their Lord, the Almighty, the All-
Knowing, which lieth in store for them in the world beyond, they would assuredly cease
their censure, and seek only to win the good pleasure of this Youth. For now, however, they
have hidden Me behind a veil of darkness, whose fabric they have woven with the hands of
idle fancy and vain imagination. Erelong shall the snow-white hand of God rend an opening
through the darkness of this night and unlock a mighty portal unto His City. On that Day
shall the people enter therein by troops.…

“We beseech God to purge the hearts of certain divines from rancour and enmity, that
they may look upon matters with an eye unbeclouded by contempt. May He raise them up
unto so lofty a station that neither the attractions of the world, nor the allurements of
authority, may deflect them from gazing upon the Supreme Horizon, and that neither
worldly benefits nor carnal desires shall prevent them from attaining that Day whereon the
mountains shall be reduced to dust. Though they now rejoice in the adversity that hath
befallen Us, soon shall come a day whereon they shall lament and weep. By My Lord! Were I
given the choice between, on the one hand, the wealth and opulence, the ease and comfort,
the honour and glory which they enjoy, and, on the other, the adversities and trials which are
Mine, I would unhesitatingly choose My present condition and would refuse to barter a
single atom of these hardships for all that hath been created in the world of being.

“But for the tribulations that have touched Me in the path of God, life would have held
no sweetness for Me, and Mine existence would have profited Me nothing. For them who
are endued with discernment, and whose eyes are fixed upon the Sublime Vision, it is no
secret that I have been, most of the days of My life, even as a slave, sitting under a sword
hanging on a thread, knowing not whether it would fall soon or late upon him. And yet,
notwithstanding all this We render thanks unto God, the Lord of the worlds, and yield Him
praise at all times and under all conditions. He, verily, standeth witness over all things.”97

From the letter written by Baha’u’llah to the Sultan of Turkey we quote the following:

“O thou who hast imagined thyself to be the most exalted of men and who hast
regarded as the lowliest of all creatures this divine Youth, through Whom the eyes of the

96   Baha’u’llah, The Summons of the Lord of Hosts, pp. 97–103.
97   Baha’u’llah, The Summons of the Lord of Hosts, pp. 133–36.

Concourse on high have been illumined and made radiant! This Youth hath sought nothing
from thee or from such as are like unto thee.…

“Even if this Lifegiver and World Reformer be in thine estimation guilty of sedition and
strife, what crime could have been committed by a group of women, children, and suckling
mothers that they should be thus afflicted with the scourge of thine anger and wrath? No
faith or religion hath ever held children responsible. The Pen of divine Command hath
exempted them, yet the fire of thy tyranny and oppression encompasseth all. If thou bearest
allegiance to any faith or religion, then thou shouldst know that, according to all the heavenly
Books and all the divinely inspired and weighty Scriptures, children are not to be held
accountable. Aside from this, not even those who disbelieve in God have perpetrated such
unseemly acts.…

“Ye have plundered and unjustly despoiled a group of people who have never rebelled in
your domains, nor disobeyed your government, but rather kept to themselves and engaged
day and night in the remembrance of God. Later, when the order was issued to banish this
Youth, all were filled with dismay.…

“A handful of clay is greater in the sight of God than all your dominion and your
sovereignty, and all your might and your fortune. Should it be His wish, He would scatter
you in dust. Soon will He seize you in His wrathful anger, sedition will be stirred up in your
midst, and your dominions will be disrupted.…

“Neither will your glory last, nor will Mine abasement endure. Such abasement, in the
estimation of a true man, is the pride of every glory.”98

Words of ‘Abdu’l-Baha Concerning Persia

“Regarding the subject of Persia. Praise be to God! She became the East of the Sun of Truth
in this age. The Light of Eternity dawned, the everlasting Glory unveiled her countenance
and the Realty of Mercifulness became manifest. This is the prosperity of Persia.
Undoubtedly, she will progress day by day under the shade of the Blessed Tree until her
illumination shall penetrate throughout the wide expanse of the earth.

“Regarding the question of the establishment of then National Assembly ([i.e., the
Parliament] of Persia, September 12, 1906). This National Assembly will not bring any rapid
results. Now some of the agitators are harboring evil intentions and do not let agreement
and union be realized between the government and (foreign) nations.…

“However, we have nothing to do with these proceedings and counter-proceedings. We
are commanded to quicken the souls, to train the characters, to illumine the realm of man, to
guide all the inhabitants of the earth, to create concord and unity among all men and to lead
the world of humanity to the Fountain of the everlasting Glory. The reformation of one
empire is not our aim; nay, rather we invoke from God that all the regions of the world be
reformed and cultivated; the republic of men become the manifestors of the bounty of the
most glorious Lord; the East and the West be brought nearer together; and that Turk and
Tajik, Iran and America, India and Arabia, Japan and Persia, China and Germany—in brief,

98   Baha’u’llah, The Summons of the Lord of Hosts, pp. 161–65.

all the nations and peoples of the world—become as one soul and one spirit, in order that
strife and warfare be entirely removed and the rancor and hostility disappear so that all
become as the waves of one ocean, the drops of one sea, the flowers of one rose-garden, the
trees of one orchard, the grains of one harvest and the plants of one meadow.

“The Constitutional Government, according to the irrefutable text of the Religion of
God, is the cause of the glory and prosperity of the nation and the civilization and freedom
of the people. However, according to what is known, the hands of the selfish leaders from
among the ‘ulama are in this affair. Outwardly they are desiring the establishment of the
National Assembly and at every moment they are crying and clamoring (for its immediate
realization), but inwardly they are sowing the seeds of corruption and agitation and try to put
to naught the noble intention of the government. In the secret of their hearts and souls they
do not favor the upbuilding of the National Assembly, the civilization of Persia, the
awakening of the people, the advancement of the age, the spreading of knowledge and
public instruction. Thieves like to lurk in darkness; fishers desire disturbed water; the bat
shuns the rays of the sun; the black beetle dislikes the fragrance of the rose-garden; the
ferocious wolf is in expectation of the sleet and snow; and the wine seller sees his advantage
in the inebriate, irrational drinker. These leaders of religion also desire to behold the nation
thrown into a weltering chaos of ignorance so that the reins of affairs remain in the hands of
the arrogant ‘ulama. They know that if the nation began to adore wisdom, truthfulness,
progress and fidelity, it would bring about their (the ‘ulama) degradation.…

“Be ye engaged in prayer that with the utmost good pleasure the nation obey the
government, comply with the wise counsels of the attendants of the central dominion, give
no attention to the hearsay of the agitators and rise not to quarrel with and protest against
the government like unto the Russian Duma, so as to throw the whole empire, the nation
and the kingdom into a sea of anarchy and lawlessness. Much prayer is needed so that God
may help and protect.”

And in another letter, also written at that same period, ‘Abdu’l-Baha declared:
“Unquestionably, through the manifestation of the Infinite Power in this glorious age,
wonderful signs will appear in the world and great changes are seen in the present and
promised in the future, for the Word of God is like unto the Spirit, and the contingent world
like unto the embryo in the womb of the mother. Through the power of the Spirit such
various changes and metamorphoses become apparent, transforming them from one form to
another. Especially in Persia, through the power of the Word of God, wonderful signs will
appear.”

Document 2: An Appeal to Muslim Leaders in Iran
New York,
The United States
March 1928

The Honored and Exalted Leaders of Islam in Tehran:

Esteemed Spiritual Brothers,

Even though human practice has not established goodly relations and mutual aid among
different religious societies of the East and the West, nevertheless we address this
communication to the honored leaders of Islam, confident that it will be received in the
same spirit of respect and fraternity in which it has been written, and in the knowledge that
the conditions and needs of the present age render religious disputes disagreeable, nay
impossible.

We adhere to this truth: that the greatest gift of God in this bright age is the recognition
of the oneness of humanity, and that all the exalted religious leaders should consider the
promotion of this fact as their greatest bounty. It is this truth, which, despite successive
centuries of misunderstandings that have prevented spiritual relationships and mutual aid
among the followers of diverse religions, has prompted us to compose this communication.
No rational or fair-minded person can deny the reality that divine teachings are the source of
all human aspirations and the foundation of all human undertakings. Therefore, as history
has demonstrated, if at any time such teachings become the cause of division and difference,
then without a doubt division and difference appear in deeds as well; conversely, whenever
religion promotes unity and friendliness, then conflict and disputation subside.

Understanding this universal divine reality in past ages—that is, at a time when the
world of humanity was divided in every way due to differences in language, culture,
traditions and geographical limits and boundaries—was not possible. However, today, when
new means of travel, education and communication by telegraph and wireless are constantly
bringing different nations closer, this truth shines brilliantly in the East and the West. Does
this firm material connection not create new responsibility for religious leaders to emphasize
such teachings as promote firm spiritual connections? Does the endless misery at the
conclusion of the recent World War not compel those who wish to promote true religion to
instead devote their efforts to the promotion of peace?

Therefore, our principal purpose in writing this letter is an invitation to peace in the
world of religion, so that serenity and tranquility can be established among the nations of the
East and the West. This is because without the spirit of peace among religions, establishing
peace among nations is impossible.

We feel a discussion of this vital point with those wielding authority in Islam is
appropriate for us, since of all the societies in the West, it is only the Baha’is who recognize
the Prophet Muhammad as an appointed Messenger and a Manifestation of God. With
utmost gratitude, we testify to His absolute sovereignty in promoting the spiritual goal of
brotherhood among millions of people in the East, and also accept that even the West has
benefited from the luminous civilization that appeared as a result of the penetrating
influence of Muhammad and the power of His Words. There is no room for doubt that the
progressive age which our historians have named the Renaissance came into being because
of the brilliance of the Islamic world. Nonetheless, even though these realities are completely
established to the Baha’is, the Christians in Europe and America are far from accepting
them, and in many instances have insulted or even attacked the Baha’is of these regions for
accepting the Messengerhood of Muhammad.

However, such prejudiced attacks upon the Baha’is are a source of pride to us; we
believe that as long as followers of every religion refuse to accept the principles of all
religions, they cannot manifest their universal truth in eradicating the ills afflicting the body
of humanity. One of our principal beliefs is that no Prophet is honored by the belittling or
denying of another Prophet, and as such, we readily testify that the Prophet Muhammad has
served in the Divine Vineyard; in this way we consider ourselves to be His humble followers.
Our Faith’s teachings give us the assurance that true following in every Dispensation is only

possible through acceptance of the divine foundation of all Manifestations. The basis of our
recognition of the grandeur and power of Prophet Muhammad is through the brilliant
effulgence of Baha’u’llah’s teachings, Who with mighty courage arose to enunciate the
principles of faith, and Who demonstrated to all well-wishers and men of insight that all
Messengers have been appointed by the same single God. Baha’u’llah tore apart bonds of
prejudice and rent asunder veils of ignorance. Because of His contributions in this arena,
now His followers throughout the world, despite the fact that they have been raised in
religious environments where bigotry and discord govern, have complete unity in the
principles of religion.

Islamic leaders no doubt owe a debt of gratitude to Baha’u’llah, Who eliminated enmity
towards Muhammad in the heart of His Christian followers, and in its place instilled the
merits of understanding and respect. We well recall the unforgettable memory of the time
that ‘Abdu’l-Baha, the eldest son of Baha’u’llah, and His devoted and distinguished servant,
proclaimed and established before large and eminent gatherings in this country the truth of
the Prophethood of Muhammad. For instance, in a gathering at Temple Emmanuel,99 which
is a Jewish synagogue in San Francisco, ‘Abdu’l-Baha spoke the following words on October
12, 1912:

> You should consider that Muhammad was born among the barbarous tribes of Arabia, and
> He lived among them. Outwardly He was illiterate and uninformed of the holy books of
> God. The Arabian nations were in ignorance and barbarism, to the extent that they buried
> their daughters alive. This act was considered to be the expression of valor and of sublimity
> of nature. They lived under the yoke of the Persian and Roman governments, were scattered
> throughout the Arabian desert and were subjected to continuous internecine strife and
bloodshed.

When the light of Muhammad dawned, the darkness of ignorance was dispelled from the
> Arabian Desert. In a short space of time those barbarous tribes reached a degree of
> civilization which extended to Spain and was established in Baghdad and influenced the
> people of Europe. What proof is there concerning His Prophethood greater than this? The
evidence is clear, unless one ignores impartiality and adheres to unwarranted discrimination.

Christians believe in Moses as a Prophet of God. Muslims are believers in Moses, and
> praise Him highly. Has any harm come to Christians and Muslims because they have
> admitted the validity of Moses? No, on the contrary, their acceptance of Moses and
confirmation of the Torah prove that they have been fair-minded.

Why should not the children of Israel now praise Christ and Muhammad? This would
> forever do away with enmity and hatred which have lasted for two thousand years, so that
differences and animosities may pass away forever.

Muslims admit that Moses was the Interlocutor of God. What harm would there be if the
> Jews said that Christ was the Spirit of God and Muhammad was the Messenger of God?

Thus there will be no hatred, no disputation, no warfare and no bloodshed.100

In the same address, ‘Abdu’l-Baha also spoke the following words:

> …the foundation of the religions of God is one. Reality does not accept multiplicity. Every
> religion is divided into two parts. One part is concerned with the world of morality, the
> upliftment and advancement of the world of humanity, the knowledge of God and the
> discovery of the realities of things. This part of religion is spiritual, and is its essential and
> fundamental part. It is the foundation of all the religions of God. Therefore, all religions are
> one and the same.

100   Translation from: Zarqani, Mahmud’s Diary, pp. 322–23.

The second part has to do with social relationships. This part is not essential; it is
> subject to change according to the requirements of the time….The essentials are spiritual in
> character and have to do with morality. They are the one foundation of religions, and are
subject to neither change or multiplicity.

The basis of the law was promulgated by Christ. That same foundation of religion was
> promulgated by Muhammad. Since all the Prophets called on the people to accept this
> reality, the purpose of all the Prophets has been the same. They upheld the honor and
> advancement of humanity, and instituted the divine civilization of man.101

Unfortunately, at the same time that ‘Abdu’l-Baha was teaching spiritual devotion and
wisdom in the United States of America, the followers of Muhammad in Iran, who had
misunderstood the purpose and teachings of Baha’u’llah, opposed the Baha’is by all possible
means, and in the utmost severity subjected them to persecution, injury and death.

Our intent is not to judge the perpetrators of these heinous deeds, since judgment
remains with God. Our purpose in mentioning these difficulties is to express reasons that
have compelled us to submit, on behalf of our coreligionist brothers and sisters in Iran, a
request to the leaders of Islam, since, alas, the cup of sacrifice in the path of Baha’u’llah has
not yet been filled to the brim. This very year, in the town of Ardabil, in the province of
Azerbaijan, an innocent and blameless Baha’i was slain solely because he refused to recant
his sincere belief in the teachings of Baha’u’llah.102 This incident took place at the instigation
of the local ‘ulama, and consequently they had a direct hand in bringing about this great
tragedy.

When we learned of this appalling incident, it occurred to us to ask ourselves: Are the
things that we are told about the teachings of the Qur’an true? Was Muhammad truly a
regenerator of the message of divine love? Or was He, as most believe, a Prophet of the
sword?

Of course, either the above is true or His followers have diverted from the path of His
true teachings, and even though they hold firmly to the influence of Muhammad, they have
used that influence like a shroud to cover their human ignorance and enmity.

Such thoughts are, of course, natural, particularly when we consider that the Baha’is of
Iran for over eighty years have been the target of endless persecution by the followers of
Islam, to the point that thousands of them have been killed by the bullets from guns and
rifles.

However, we set aside these thoughts and brought to mind this truth: that the followers
of all Prophets, sooner or later, enter a phase of darkness, when the light of divine love is
extinguished in their hearts and in the place of affection and self-restraint, which are
attributes of that light, they cling to dark deeds. In truth, other than the power of God, what
other power can raise the reality of man from its animal nature to the world of humanity?
We embrace this power, and through this clinging we perceive our equality with the entire
body of man.

At this time we should inform you that last year we were so saddened and aggrieved over
the news of the brutal killing of eight Baha’is in Jahrum103 that we submitted a confidential

101 Translation from: Zarqani, Mahmud’s Diary, pp. 319–20.
102 A reference to the killing of the Aminu’l-‘Ulama; see Mazandarani, Tarikh Zuhuru’l-Haqq, vol. 9, pp. 79–81.
103 Shoghi Effendi records the following in Baha’i Administration, pp. 103–4, in a communication dated April 22,

1926: “Once again the woeful tale of unabated persecution, involving this time the martyrdom of twelve of our
long-suffering brethren in Jahrum, southern Persia, has reached our ears, and filled us with a gloom which all
the joys and ennobling memories of Ridvan have failed to dispel.”

missive to the presence of His Majesty the Pahlavi King, and we requested that justice be
carried out in regard to the wronged Baha’is of Iran, who have never contravened their
government, and who in accordance with their religious teachings consider obedience to a
just government to be obedience to God. However, our request remained unanswered, and
tyranny and persecution continued.

We now make the same request of the leaders of the Islamic religion—not as a criticism
of the government, but as a means of drawing the attention of those spiritual guides whose
influence and sway over people’s thoughts and actions are more than the influence of civil
laws. Our appeal is that you consider the persecutions and wrongs perpetrated by the
followers and promoters of Islam in the name of religion. Can anyone still imagine that
religion can progress through the murder of innocent men and women? The wise of every
nation understand that whenever human emotions are provoked against those with religious
differences, eventually the divine decree directs that fire of enmity back onto its originator,
and causes that religion to be wrecked. Therefore, it would be a true service to Islam and to
humanity if Islamic leaders admonished the generality of people to compassion and
kindness, and promoted peace and unity.

Do not imagine that our intent is only to prevent and stay the slaying of some devoted
and sincere followers of Baha’u’llah—even though every human life is precious before God.
Our principal purpose is more fundamental, as we are trying to raise the call of affection,
which gives the spirit of compassion and kindness to humankind without consideration of
ethnicity, race and nationality. Our purpose is to establish fraternity among the nations of the
world, and our wish is to help create the path of oneness among diverse religions, so that the
spirit of faith would permeate us, and the contrary and destructive customs and thoughts of
the past would be transmuted into unity and peace.

The esteemed leaders of Islam have religious sway and authority over millions of souls in
the East. Alas, if only this influence could be used for the promotion of religious liberty and
the increase of spirituality. Otherwise, there is no hope that the seeds of conflict can be
eradicated from the earth. The foundation of the progress of the nations of the East and the
West is harmony among religions, and we exert every effort so that soon the day will come
for the representatives of the different religions of Christianity, Judaism, Islam and others, to
come together, so that we may develop complete unity of thought on the true principles of
divine teachings. We are certain that you share the same wish and sentiment. However, until
such a time as every religion prevents its followers from committing oppression and tyranny,
this mighty purpose will remain unachievable.

Five Historical Documents

The following reports by Baha’i institutions in Iran and the United States shed considerable
light on the trial and on efforts to liberate the innocent Baha’is entangled in the events
associated with the murders in Abarqu. The National Archives staff of the National Baha’i
Center of the United States is thanked for providing these documents, which have been
reproduced below in slightly edited form (for grammar).104
Letter dated July 16, 1952, from the National Spiritual Assembly of the Baha’is of Iran:105

No. 2457

To the National Spiritual Assembly of the Baha’is of the United States
Mr. Horace Holley, Secretary
536 Sheridan Road, Wilmette, Illinois

Dear Baha’i Friends,

A report of the imprisonment of the members of the Spiritual Assembly of Yazd and
some other Baha’is, relating to the incident of Abarqu, namely, the murder of a woman and
her children has been sent and received by your Assembly from time to time. Therefore, it is
not necessary to repeat it here again.

After the trial was held and sentence pronounced against those wronged ones, we sent a
report to the Beloved Guardian, which we herewith enclose, and his telegraphed reply was as
follows:

> HAIFA, JUNE 26, 1952
> GRIEVE DEVELOPMENTS    CASE YAZD PRISONERS ADVISE AFTER CAREFUL
> DELIBERATION    EXAMINATION    INTERNAL    SITUATION   CONSIDER
> ADVISABILITY YOUR ACQUAINTING AMERICAN ASSEMBLY DETAILS CASE
> EITHER ASK THEM APPEAL STATE DEPARTMENT OR AUTHORITIES PERSIA OR
UNITED NATIONS. PRAYING ADDED FERVOUR DIVINE GUIDANCE.

SHOGHI

After careful consultation by this Assembly, we have decided on these two proposals,
namely, “ask them appeal State Department or Authorities Persia” and pass it on for the
decision of your Assembly to decide which of the two in your opinion is more effective and

104   Private communication, March 15, 2010.
105   A translation of this letter in Persian appears in Afnan, Bigunahan, pp. 228–30.

best or whether to try both proposals. Due to the fact that our Baha’i brothers in Persia are
being severely persecuted by the fanatics, it is requested that their case be thoroughly
investigated and their dossiers be referred to by unbiased parties. For the present, we
consider referring to the UN be ignored.

The main point to be considered carefully by your Assembly is that the judges of the
Court of Yazd had fabricated false documents in advance against the Friends, as you have
been previously informed, and subsequently with all their might misrepresented the whole
case so that it would appear lawful in order that these wronged ones be sentenced.

Although the Baha’is lawyers proved in detail that the Court’s accusations were weak and
false and their documents were irrelevant to the case, yet unfortunately, their arguments were
unheeded just as in the case of the martyrdom of Dr. Berjis; although the murderers
confessed that they had murdered him, the Court set them free on the strength that there
was not sufficient proof.

This Assembly knows for certain and testifies that these Friends who have been
persecuted and suffered all these trials are innocent and have been sacrificed for the
fanaticism and animosity of these people. The Court and the judges of this country have
always endeavored to oppress and encroach upon the rights of the Baha’is, and such matters
have been brought many times previously to your Assembly’s notice.

> We kindly ask you to acknowledge receipt of this letter by telegraph.
> Sincerely yours in His Cause,
> [Signed by] A[li-Akbar] Furutan

P.S. We have just learned today, that the dossier has been sent to the No. 2 Division of the
High Court. The President is Justice Lutfi, who is very fanatic and does not look favorably
upon the Baha’is. If it is possible to do anything for us, we request you to do so as soon as
possible.
The following report was attached to the above-cited letter of July 16, 1952, by the National
Spiritual Assembly of the Baha’is of Iran:
The trial opened on 7th May, 1952 at No. 1 Division of the Tehran Criminal Court. The
accused were as follows:

Nine members of the Spiritual Assembly of Yazd:

> Badiullah Afnan               Mr. Rafati
> Muhammad Ali Afnan            Mr. Salekian
> Dr. Rasti                     Mr. Majdhub
> Dr. Manshadi                  Mr. Mishki
> Dr. Malakutian
> Mr. Hasan Shams, member of the Spiritual Assembly of Isfandabad
> Mr. Abbas-Ali Pur-Mehdi, Baha’i Pioneer in Abarqu
> Mr. Husayn Karambakhsh, a believer from Isfandabad
> Mr. Muhammad Rafahi, a believer from Isfandabad
> Mr. Muhammad Shirvani, a Muslim
> Mr. Ahmad Niku’i, now a Muslim who was formerly a Baha’i

Mr. Muhammad Husayn Niku’i, a Muslim (the last three are brothers)
Mr. Ali Muhammad Shirvani, 20-year-old son of Muhammad Shirvani

The tribunal was composed of:

> Justice Ashraf Ahmadi, president (belonging to the Shaykhi sect)
> Justice Amir Ibrahimi, member (of the Shaykhi sect)
> Justice Vakili, member
> Justice Fakhr Tabatabai, member
> Justice Arshad Amiri, member

Deputy Prosecutor—Khili Sabri (of the Sunni sect)

The Counsel pleading on behalf of the relatives of the deceased was composed of some of
the bitterest enemies of the Cause who are well known for their religious fanaticism, such as:

> Shaykh Riza Malik
> Adib Razavi
> Mehdi Razavi
> Khudadad Sabir
> Amidi Nuri—editor of the daily paper Dad who had lately shown marked opposition
towards the Faith.

The Counsel for defense was composed of the following lawyers:

> Mr. Navidi, a believer [Baha’i]
> Mr. Nasiri, a believer [Baha’i]
> Mr. Kazemzadeh, a believer [Baha’i]
> Mr. Naraqi, a Muslim
> Mr. Safavi, a Muslim
> Mr. Abdullah Razi, a Muslim

When the procedure for the identification of the defendants had ended, the prosecutor’s
indictment setting out the charges against the accused was read in full at the Court. It ran
briefly as follows:

In order to fulfill their pioneering plan for teaching work and [the] formation of [an]
> Assembly in Abarqu, the Spiritual Assembly of Yazd appointed Abbas-Ali Pur-Mehdi for
> this purpose, paid him some money and sent him to the above center. The inhabitants are
> highly fanatic in their religious beliefs and resent Baha’i propaganda. This is evidenced by
> the fact that prior to the arrival of the above-named, a certain Baha’i teacher by the name
> of “Sabit” was carrying out the same mission in Abarqu. However, having met strong
> opposition and being threatened with death, he was forced to escape from the area with his
wife at midnight.

One of the bitter enemies of the Baha’is in Abarqu, who often used to insult and
> denounce them in public, especially at Muslim lamentation gatherings was a woman by the
> name of Soghra. She lived in a caravanserai some two kilometers from Abarqu and earned
> her living by baking bread and doing laundry work. Her neighbor was a certain Muhammad
> Shirvani, a reserved Baha’i who was genuinely hurt by Soghra’s biting insults.

Abbas-Ali Pur-Mehdi got in touch with Shirvani by means of some business dealings in
> chickens for which the former maintained relations with Hasan Shams [sic], a member of
> the Spiritual Assembly of Isfandabad. Of course all these connections were highly secret.
> Finally, a plot was arranged to dispose of this poor woman so that the opposition towards
> the Baha’i Faith may be broken down through terror and the way be prepared for the
> formation of the Assembly in Abarqu. This plot was made with the full knowledge and
> approval of the Spiritual Assembly of Yazd and the active support of Abbas-Ali Pur-Mehdi
> and of Hasan Shams who instigated three native farmers from Isfandabad namely: Hasan
> Himmati, Husayn Karambakhsh, and Muhammad Rafahi, to join as accomplices in the
> plot. On the night of 13th Day [3rd January], the above accomplices called at the house of
> Muhammad Shirvani and accompanied by the latter’s 18-year-old son ([meaning,] at the
> time of the crime was 18 years old) and his two brothers Muhammad Husayn Niku’i and
> Ahmad Niku’i, they worked their way into the home of Soghra and murdered her and her
> three daughters and two sons with axes and spades, taking away some of her provisions
> and clothes as well.

The above was a summary of the indictment lodged against the defendants. It is indeed
unique in irrelevancy and lack of sensible proofs. For instance, a reason given to prove that
the murder was committed on religious grounds is that practically all the victims had
sustained fatal blows in their face and jaws. And since the prosecutor could not find any
tangible evidence to implicate the members of the Spiritual Assembly of Yazd and the other
accused in this crime, he has satisfied himself by stating repeatedly that the whole affair was
highly secret. For instance, it is stated that apart from the sum of 350 tumans paid to Abbas-
Ali Pur-Mehdi according to the Assembly registers, further sums have been paid to him
secretly. Another assertion is that those named above had established secret relations with
Muhammad Shirvani or that Hasan Shams had given secret instructions to some natives of
Isfandabad.

When the reading of the indictment was over, the Deputy Prosecutor proceeded by
saying that at a time when our neighbors in the adjoining lands are striving towards progress
and self-advancement and our own country is in a dire need of economic and educational
reforms, it is regrettable to see a number of people—whom I feel ashamed to call
“Persians”—engaged in fratricidal strife in our homeland. They have secret organizations
and seek to advance their doctrines by committing acts of crime. The case under review,
involving the murder of a woman and her five innocent children, is one of their sinister acts.
It must have been carefully plotted in advance and was committed by the accused quite
cleverly and cautiously. If these people in the dock, said the Deputy Prosecutor, had killed
their opponents openly in the daylight I would have regarded their crime as an ordinary one,
however these cruel people attacked their victims in the dark of the night when they were
fast asleep in their beds and murdered them in a very atrocious manner. After dwelling on
such provocative and baseless allegations, the Deputy Prosecutor concluded by saying, “I
demand from the Court that the severest sentences be passed on these criminals so that
people will realize that in our country there is the rule of law, otherwise it would be likely
that the public would intervene and take a harsh revenge.” This unusual and provocative
statement by the Public Prosecutor led the counsel for defense, namely: Messrs. Navidi,
Razi, Kazemzadeh, and Nasiri, to tender their resignations to the Tribunal on the grounds
that these instigating remarks created such a strong excitement among the audience as to
endanger the individual safety of the counsel, who still had to plead for the defense.

Later the President of the Court gave an assurance that no demonstrations would be
allowed and re-appointed Messrs. Navidi and Kazemzadeh to resume the defense of the

case. The other two members of the Counsel were also re-selected and introduced by the
defendants.

Now it was the turn of the lawyers who were to plead the case on behalf of the only
[surviving] daughter of the murdered woman. From the outset it was evident that each of the
ten advocates was told in advance what line he should adopt in making allegations when it
was his turn to address the Court. So apart from the two or three who explained certain
points about Law or spoke about the legal aspects of the case, the rest contented themselves
with uttering words of denunciation, by making false and irrelevant statements and by
directing bitter and derisive attacks towards the defendant—as well as the Cause to which
they adhered.

For instance, Mr. Khudada Sabir, one of the bitter enemies of the Faith, had brought
with him copies of Bayan, Aqdas, and Some Answered Questions into the Court, and the gist of
his talk was as follows:

According to the text of the book Some Answered Questions, Baha’is reject evidence based on
> rational, tangible, or traditional proofs. Then how can one attain to the Truth? Baha’is regard
> everything unclean as clean. If a Baha’i fails to change his household effects once in 19 years, he
> will be dismissed from the community. Baha’is are ordered to place their dead in glass or marble
> caskets. When the Baha’i Faith becomes universal, one may wonder where one is going to get so
> much marble from for burial purposes. In the book of Aqdas there are laws for the punishment
> of men and women who commit sensual offences. Also there is a law as to how a robber is to
> be treated, but there is none relating to a woman robber. And so he went on for nearly an hour,
> dwelling on such absurd and inconsistent falsifications. However, the President did not stop
> him, not even a word of caution was said to indicate that his talk had no bearing upon the case,
> while on the other hand the spectators, numbering about 700–1,000, encouraged him with their
> tumultuous acclamations.

Another speaker was Amidi Nuri, editor of the paper Dad, who seemed to be altogether
ignorant about the case but had joined the prosecution team to gain personal prestige and
reputation. For nearly forty minutes he read from the political writings of Dolgorukii, the ex-
Russian minister who had made false allegations about the Faith, then making a bitter attack
against the prisoners, referred to them as outcasts, spies, murderers, etc. He then went on to
say that at the instigation of Baha’is, and contrary to the interest of our nation, has
announced that a group of innocent Baha’is are being tried in Iran, reminiscent of the
Medieval Ages when people were dragged to courts for Inquisition. In his vehement attacks
against the Faith, Mr. Amidi Nuri outmatched ignorant fanatics and priests. Thus the ten
lawyers who acted as Counsel on behalf of the victims’ relatives concluded their statements.
Outwardly, they were supposed to support the prosecution in the case of the murder of a
Muslim woman and her five children, but in fact they were appointed by a certain other
source to defame the Cause.

Now it was the turn of the Counsel for the defense to plead the case. They delivered
lengthy, tactful speeches whereby they proved the innocence of the prisoners by legal,
rational, and logical arguments. However, when any of the defending Counsel began to
refute the false allegations and misrepresentations advanced by the prosecuting Counsel, he
would invariably meet with the immediate intervention of the President stating that the
argument was inconsistent with the case. When it was pointed out to him that the
prosecution had distorted the truth or made false statements and that evidence is furnished
to remove misunderstanding, the President would retort that there is no need for further
explanation since the matter has no bearing upon the case.

Of the defending Counsel, Messrs. Navidi, Nasiri, and Kazemzadeh manifested courage
and tenacity in their work and conducted their defense in a masterly manner undeterred by

the threats and intimidations leveled against them. However, Mr. Safavi, the Muslim counsel,
extremely alarmed at the sight of the be-turbaned mullas and the furious crowd of
spectators, only took part in the first two sessions, and the other Muslim lawyer on the
Counsel for defense, Mr. Naragi, was only present at the last session. He spoke very briefly
about human rights and stated that the Court should approach inquiry only from the legal
aspect and should not allow the proceedings to turn into a religious wrangle giving
opportunity to people to appear before the Court and declare themselves as “Baha’is.”

The number of the spectators in the Court was quite large and steadily increased each
day. During the intervals in the hearing, anonymous printed notices were distributed in
which Baha’is were vehemently attacked and the death sentence was demanded for all the
accused. The defending advocates were also threatened with death unless they give up their
appointment as counsel for the accused. However, order was maintained by an adequate
number of policemen both inside and outside the Court.

After the Counsel for defense had concluded their pleading, the Deputy Prosecutor once
again addressed the Court. He repeated his former statement and brushed aside the
arguments advanced by the defending advocates as baseless and vague. The other
prosecuting attorney followed suit by reiterating the former false allegations, which were
finally refuted by the defending Counsel. On the 11th and 12th May, the defendants made
their last pleas before the Court in a brief statement. Thereupon the inquiry was declared to
have been concluded, and the Tribunal adjourned to consider the verdict.

As it was not known when the judges would return, the spectators, including some fifty
turbaned mullas in a special gallery, gradually left the courtroom after waiting for a couple of
hours. However, they returned between 3 p.m. until about 7 p.m. The crowd numbered
some 600–700. Another report indicates that the top galleries were locked, in the afternoon,
and the lower hall’s capacity does not exceed 400 seats. At this time security measures, which
were not lacking throughout the trial, were redoubled, and a larger number of armed guards
and policemen were posted around the courtroom and along the corridors in the building.
Several police officers are reported to have said that the President of the Court looked rather
terrified and was reluctant to enter the courtroom.

The Tribunal passed verdict on the defendants between 7:30 and 8:00 p.m. in the
presence of the five judges, the accused, and the spectators. The verdict was read by the
Secretary of the Court as follows:

> Muhammad Shirvani—Muslim
> Hasan Himmati—Baha’i
> Husayn Karambakhsh—Baha’i
> Muhammad Rafahi—Baha’i
> The above four were sentenced to death for committing the murder.

> Abbas-Ali Pur-Mehdi—Baha’i Pioneer in Abarqu and
> Hasan Shamsi—member of the Spiritual Assembly of Isfandabad were sentenced to
> ten years of hard labor for acting as accomplices in the case.

> Nine members of the Spiritual Assembly of Yazd were sentenced to three years’ hard
> labor each for having plotted the murder.

> The two other accused, namely, Ahmad Niku’i (formerly a Baha’i) and Muhammad
> Husayn Niku’i were acquitted.

Usually when the verdict is passed at the Court, the convicted are required to sign the
bill as evidence. Now, the sixteen accused prisoners who were convicted to execution or
imprisonment had to affix a few words to the bill stating their intention to appeal to the
High Court. This simple declaration will be legally binding and the dossiers will be submitted
to the High Court of Appeal for their decision. There will be no need for a further petition
to be filed with the Court seeking appeal in respect of its verdict.

When an appeal is made in respect of a court verdict, the documents are forwarded to
the High Court after one or two weeks, when the necessary office formalities are complied.
However, when the verdict involves the death sentence, it is likely that the procedure will be
expedited in all its stages.

According to constitutional codes of law, when the Supreme Court of appeal renders
judgment in a criminal case, the accused or the defending advocates are to be called in;
however, if the parties concerned fail to attend with no good reason, judgment will be passed
in their absence, and the case will not be postponed. Nevertheless, this principle is not
recognized by the Persian High Court, and neither the party affected by the verdict nor its
appointed Counsel is allowed to take part in the Court of Appeal proceedings.

When the concerned dossier is forwarded by the Criminal Court to that for Appeal, it
will be referred to one of the latter’s three divisions for consideration. The time taken by the
High Court to pass judgment in a case ranges from about two to six months, depending on
the importance of the case under consideration as well as on recommendations from people
of high standing and on the extent to which the parties concerned could bring their efforts
and influence to bear on the case. However, there have been cases in the past in which
reconsideration by the High Court only took about one month.

Three courses of action lie open to the High Court in passing judgment in a case of
appeal:

> 1. To issue a warrant upholding the verdict passed by the Criminal Court.
2. To quash the verdict already passed and to appoint another court of similar status to

> reopen inquiry into the Case. This would imply that the whole procedure should be
> repeated.
3. To repeal the verdict passed and to suspend further inquiry by another Court.

Should the High Court uphold the decision of the Criminal Court, one can request that
the case be reopened for a second hearing. This has been allowed by law in such cases where
the convicted person has been proved innocent, or when the sentence is found to be legally
incompatible with the offense. If the petition for reopening of the case is approved, enquiry
into the case will be committed to the charge of another court.

The dossier belonging to the case under reference is at present held by the Registrar of
the Criminal Court. Normally, it will be forwarded to the High Court within a week or two.
However, if applications are submitted for copies of the verdicts or other documents on file,
its dispatch may be postponed for a while. On its being received by the Court of Appeal it
will be referred to one of the three Divisions for consideration and judgment. But since the
defending lawyers will not be present on that occasion, it cannot be ascertained when the
case will come before the High Court for their judgment.

Dr. Hassan Pernahad
Chargé d’Affaires of Iran
Iranian Embassy
Washington, D.C.

My dear Mr. Chargé d’Affaires:

The National Spiritual Assembly, as representative of the Baha’is of the United States,
appeals to the Iranian Government through Your Excellency on behalf of members of the
Baha’i Faith in Iran who have been unjustly arrested, brought to trial and condemned, for a
crime they did not commit and for which there is evidence establishing the identity of the
real criminal.

The appeal made by the Baha’is of the United States, Your Excellency is assured, rests
upon facts and documentary evidence.

During the year 1950, a woman and five children living in Abarqu, near Yazd, were
murdered. Residents of the village knew who the murderer was and pointed him out to the
authorities. Affidavits and other evidence establishing this were and are available, but have
been ignored by the authorities.

Despite the actual facts, upon the basis of false documents the members of the Baha’i
Assembly of Yazd, and other Baha’is, were imprisoned and charged with responsibility for
the crime by the Judges of the Court of Yazd.

The case was transferred to No. 1 Division of the Criminal Court in Tihran and the trial
opened on May 7, 1952.
The names of the accused are:

> Badiullah Afnan Muhammad Ali Afnan
> Dr. Rasti         Dr. Manshadi
> Dr. Malakutian Mr. Rafati
> Mr. Salekian      Mr. Majdhub
> Mr. Mishki
being the nine members of the Baha’i Assembly of Yazd; [plus] the following Baha’is:

> Hasan Shams of Isfandabad
> Abbas-Ali Pur-Mehdi of Abarqu
> Hasan Himmati of Isfandabad
> Husayn Karambakhsh of Isfandabad
> Muhammad Rafahi of Isfandabad
and the following Muslims:

> Muhammad Shirvani            Ahmad Niku’i
> Muhammad Husayn Niku’i Ali Muhammad Shirvani

The report of the trial clearly indicates that the facts pertaining to the crime were
disregarded and the case made an occasion for publicly vilifying the Baha’i religion and
persecuting innocent members of the Faith. The conduct of this trial proceeded in an
atmosphere of religious prejudice and unrelenting hatred of the Baha’i religion and its
adherents. Anti-Baha’i statements were printed and distributed. The prosecution dramatized
the case as an indictment of the Baha’i religion and made no effort to submit proof and
evidence carrying legal weight.

On May 12, a verdict was passed by the Court, sentencing four defendants to death for
committing the crime. Those sentenced were Muhammad Shirvani, Hasan Himmati, Husayn

Karambakhsh, Muhammad Rafahi. Of these, the first named is a Muslim, the other three are
Baha’is.

The verdict also passed sentence upon other defendants. Abbas-Ali Pur-Mehdi and
Hasan Shamsi were sentenced to ten years’ imprisonment with hard labor for being
accomplices to the crime. Nine of the defendants, members of the Baha’i Assembly of Yazd,
were sentenced to three years at hard labor for plotting the murder. Two Muslim defendants,
Ahmad Niku’i and Muhammad Husayn Niku’i, were acquitted.

Appeal was made in due course to the High Court by the fifteen condemned prisoners
for review of the verdict.

The National Spiritual Assembly is informed that the High Court under its procedure has
three courses of action in such appeals: to sustain the verdict pronounced by the Criminal
Court; to quash the verdict and appoint another Court to conduct a new trial; to repeal the
verdict and suspend further inquiry by another Court.

On or shortly before July 16 the appeal was sent to No. 2 Division of the High Court,
whose President is Justice Lutfi.

Your Excellency, there is still an interval of time during which the condemned prisoners
can be vindicated by examination of the true facts of the case as assembled and recorded by
the members of the Iranian National Spiritual Assembly of the Baha’is.

The appeal presented by the Baha’is of the United States is directed to this end: a new
and impartial trial of the case by an unprejudiced tribunal competent to separate fact from
mere denunciation, and logical evidence from false documentation. The American Baha’is
feel it necessary in order to save these innocent, law-abiding Iranian Baha’is from pressure of
prejudice and persecution, to appeal for the exercise of the high civil authority by
appointment of an observer to attend the sessions of the Court.

Our appeal, Your Excellency, is that this safeguard be granted the unjustly condemned.

Not for one moment do the American Baha’is press for suppression of fact nor the exercise
of mercy at the expense of justice. Our claim is that these unjustly condemned Baha’is are
innocent, deserving a hearing before an impartial tribunal and responsible authority.

May we request Your Excellency to transmit our appeal to the Iranian Government for
consideration at the earliest possible moment. The Baha’is of the United States, and the
Baha’is of all lands, honor the ancient land of Iran and desire to exalt its reputation for
spiritual wisdom and justice throughout the world.

> We are,
> Sincerely yours,
> National Spiritual Assembly

Letter dated September 5, 1952, from the National Spiritual Assembly of the Baha’is of the
United States:108
His Excellency Muhammad Mossadegh,
Prime Minister of Iran

Tehran, Iran.

Your Excellency:

The Baha’is of the United States are deeply concerned about the fate of a number of
Iranian Baha’is recently arrested, tried and condemned by the Court for a crime they did not
commit.

This case, your Excellency, is an instance of religious persecution we consider to be of
extreme importance in that the Baha’i victims have not suffered at the hands of lawless
fanatics but have been unjustly condemned by a civil tribunal.

The facts of the matter are summarized as follows:

During the year 1950, a woman and five children living in Abarqu, near Yazd, were

and the following Muslims:

The American Baha’is, Your Excellency, appeal to the highest civil authority of Iran to
assure a new and impartial trial of the case by an unprejudiced tribunal by appointment of a
competent observer to attend the sessions of the Court.

Your Excellency’s favorable consideration of this appeal will inspire gratitude in the
hearts of Baha’is not only in America but throughout the world. The National Spiritual
Assembly respectfully refers to the constitutional laws of Iran, which have been contravened
by the treatment accorded to the unjustly condemned Baha’is.
Respectfully,

National Spiritual Assembly

Eyewitness Accounts

The following accounts printed in World Order109 journal provide important insights in the
courtroom drama in 1952 and 1954, as the Baha’is were unjustly tried for the Abarqu
murders. In introducing the first two accounts, Dr. Firuz Kazemzadeh states:

> Ever since its inception in nineteenth-century Iran, the Baha’i Faith has been subject
> to persecution by an unholy alliance of Shiite clergy and despotic state. Vilification,
> slander, economic pressure, withdrawal of fundamental human rights, denial of
> justice, and even massacre have been instruments used by the extremist elements
> among the mullahs, often supported by government authorities, in their attempts to
> exterminate the Baha’i community in the country of its birth. Even the partial
> modernization that followed the Constitutional Revolution of 1906 and the downfall
> of the Qajar dynasty that greatly decreased the power of the Shiite clergy failed to
> bring relief to Iran’s Baha’is. Through the entire Pahlavi (1925–79) period,
> discrimination and pressure, punctuated by outbreaks of physical violence,
continued unabated.

In the wake of World War II Iran underwent a period of confusion and turmoil.

> The reemergence of political parties and the resurgent power of the Shiite clergy
> produced instability that endangered the Baha’is, who could be attacked with
> impunity since the authorities were largely unwilling, and at times even unable, to
> protect them. The influence of the clergy further increased in 1953 when its leaders,
> the Ayatollahs Borujerdi and Kashani, sided with the Shah in his conflict with Prime
> Minister Mosaddegh. The Shah was now beholden to the mullahs who demanded,
> as payment for their services, freedom to suppress the Baha’is. The supposedly
> independent judiciary was tightly controlled by the government and decided cases at
> the direction of either the Cabinet or the Court. The majority of the legal profession
> were either intimidated or, with some outstanding exceptions, shared the prevailing
> prejudices of Iranian society. Persecution intensified with the establishment of the
Islamic regime and continues to this day.

The following two documents deal with two trials of Baha’is falsely accused of

second trial was held. At the conclusion of each trial, my father, the lead defense
lawyer, wrote the following letters to me.110

Account 1: Kazem Kazemzadeh’s Firsthand Account of Defending Baha’is
from Yazd in 1952
June 1952
My Dear Son:

The trial of the Yazd friends began on May 7 and ended on May 27. You cannot imagine
what we endured in those twenty-one days. What agitation, what anxiety for the fate of those
unfortunate men, what apprehension and fear for our own lives have we, defenders of a
righteous cause, experienced. And the outcome of the trial? Four sentenced to death, three
to ten years’ imprisonment, and nine [members of the Spiritual Assembly] to three years.
This verdict dealt us a moral blow from which we have yet to recover.

One could expect anything from such a court and such judges; but to condemn three
innocent peasants who had done nothing, from whom the examining magistrate obtained a
confession by trickery, charlatanry, and deception—that I did not expect. These
unfortunates are illiterate. They affixed their fingerprints to the protocol of the investigation
not knowing what was written there.

More than a thousand persons were in the hall where the trial was held. In a box reserved
for the press there sat forty to fifty head mullahs. The public was select in the full sense of
the term—that is, they picked from the street anyone who suited their purpose and paid him
three tumans. The guards numbered some 100 to 150 men. On the third or fourth day of the
trial, all who wanted to enter the hall were searched. It was said that weapons were found on
and confiscated from several people.

In addition to the assistant prosecutor, ten lawyers participated as parties to the civil
suit.111 There were only four of us defense attorneys of whom one, having assessed the
situation, got sick (apparently of an upset stomach); another appeared on the final day of
defense arguments and said a few words about the United Nations, human rights and so on,
constantly emphasizing that he was hostile to the religious convictions of the defendants.

After the speech of the assistant prosecutor, a Sunni, we, the defense, lodged a protest
and resigned. This, if you will pardon the expression, assistant prosecutor read a speech
prepared for him ahead of time pouring forth mud, insults, and slander on the accused and
their beliefs. At the end of his spurious speech he demanded severe punishment of the
defendants so as to avoid vengeance of the people. It was after this speech of the assistant
prosecutor that we, the defense, resigned, declaring to the Court that we had been deprived
of the necessary guaranty [of safety] and that, after the assistant prosecutor’s speech one
heard in the hall shouts of “Execution, execution!”

The Court found itself in a difficult situation, and we did not feel too well either.

According to judicial procedure, after our resignation the Court should have appointed two

110 Kazemzadeh, “The 1952 and 1954 Trials of Baha’is from Yazd, Iran,” which provides the text of Accounts
1 and 2 quoted in this appendix. Steve Cooney is thanked for drawing the translator’s attention to this
document and sharing a copy.
111 Under Iranian law, criminal and civil proceedings may be conducted simultaneously. (F. Kazemzadeh)

or three defense attorneys. The defendants could reject such defense attorneys in which case
they must choose their own attorneys and recommend them to the Court. There was
apprehension that, if the defendants chose us for the second time, the Court would refuse
the request on the ground that we had been chosen before and had resigned. There was such
a precedent. But if, as a form of protest, the defendants refused to choose their attorneys,
the Court on its own could appoint attorneys, as was done for four other defendants; and
such attorneys, not knowing the case and not caring for the accused, would have talked a lot
of irrelevant nonsense and would have recounted in detail that they regretted being
compelled, in accordance with the instructions of the Court, to defend individuals to whose
convictions they were adverse, that in our country the official religion is Islam of Shiite
denomination, and so on. One of the defense lawyers appointed by the court literally said
such things.

Considering all this, when the presiding judge told me and Navidi that we were wrong to
resign and that we would be given full guaranty [of safety], we said that we would be ready to
defend the accused as advocates appointed by the Court.112 He, the presiding judge, agreed
and appointed us. The further peripeteia of our resignation and appointment are too
detailed, and I shall not write about them.

Private advocates began their speeches. They were a bunch selected from among three or
four arrant fanatics, three or four lawyers in the worst sense of that term.…

These gentlemen, having turned the rostrum of the court into a tribune of a political or
religious meeting, said that Baha’is had no prohibition against marrying their sisters or
daughters; that they considered everything, including dog excrement and human semen,
ritually clean; that in Baha’u’llah’s laws nothing was said about how to treat a female thief,
while there was a law about a male thief (Kitab-i-Aqdas speaks of the punishment of thieves
in the masculine gender, and these gentlemen, alleged lawyers, concluded that female thieves
were not to be punished); that Baha’is must change the furnishing of their homes every
nineteen years or suffer excommunication.

Another lawyer, editor of the newspaper Dad,113 who broke the record for maliciousness
and hostility, devoted forty minutes of his speech to reading the so-called Memoirs of Prince
Dolgorukii and came to the banal conclusion that this religion was created by a Russian
diplomat.114 Words such as spies, murderers, men without fatherland, traitors, apostates,
were repeated incessantly, but the presiding judge never stopped the overzealous advocates.
When the lawyers, foaming at the mouth, described the method of the murder of the
unfortunate woman and her five children, the public either expressed its indignation at the
“cruelty” of the accused or applauded the orator who demanded the death penalty for all
eighteen men. When applause was heard, the presiding judge would ring and direct the guard
to remove the violators of order from the hall; but this was only a formality perfectly
understood by both the public and the guards. Therefore, during the entire trial not one
person was ejected.

112 Aziz Navidi was Kazem Kazemzadeh’s colleague in the 1952 and 1952 trials. (F. Kazemzadeh)
113 Dad, Persian for justice. (F. Kazemzadeh)
114 The fictitious Memoirs of Prince Dolgorukii, a diplomat who had served as Russian minister plenipotentiary in

Iran were manufactured in clerical circles in the late 1930s in Mashhad. The alleged memoirs have been
demonstrated by various scholars to be a poorly executed counterfeit, purporting to show that the Babi religion
was invented by the Russians to weaken Islam and subjugate Iran. For more than half a century the Memoirs,
an Iranian equivalent of the Protocols of the Elders of Zion, have been used in attacking Baha’is as agents of foreign
powers. (F. Kazemzadeh)

In the intermission suspicious persons distributed leaflets that demanded that the Court
severely punish the accused. One leaflet bore a drawing: a woman is sitting on the rug by a
samovar and around her, five children. These supposedly are Soqra [Sughra] and her five
children resting at the family hearth after a day’s work; and below another picture—cadavers
of the woman and five children covered with blood, the blood represented by red stains—
shabby, grubby pictures in a cheap Persian manner. However, even these shabby leaflets
made strong impression on Persian minds and feeling, if Persians have them. From every
side one heard words of revilement cast at the defendants and even at their attorneys.

Had I the time and the inclination I would have written a whole book about this trial,
and the book would have turned out quite interesting and instructive. But, alas, there is a
more urgent issue before me than writing a book, the issue of daily bread. For twenty-one
days I was deprived of rest and sleep. I frequently sat up until four in the morning and got
up at six. You can imagine your father limited to two hours of sleep. I have lost much weight
and turned pale and weak. Yet at the trial I acted heroically. A smile never left my lips. I
calmed the defendants, kept persuading them that the case could be won, frequently
conversed with them. And an impression was created among all those present at the trial that
I was the most reckless, the strongest, and the bravest of the defense lawyers. I will write you
another time about my speech and the reactions of others.

All of us defense lawyers spoke well and with dignity; but the Court frequently stopped
us even in instances where we attempted to reply to certain insinuations or slanderous
statements by the accusers. Thus, when at the start of my speech I said that the pamphlet
entitled “Memoirs of Prince Dolgorukii” was read here and that to avoid possible
misunderstanding I intended to prove that this documents was a forgery composed by a
Persian and not by a Russian diplomat, the presiding judge said that the document had no
particular significance for the trial. In order not to contradict the presiding judge on whose
caprice and mood depended the fate of my clients, I replied that, following his instructions, I
would not touch this issue and would confine myself to pointing out the fact that the
content of this pamphlet kept changing all the time. Some “facts,” too obviously
mendacious, have not appeared in new editions; chronological errors were corrected, and so
on. For comparison of their texts I deposited with the Court two of the pamphlets printed at
different times, from which it will be clear to the Court that the memories were counterfeit.
With the pamphlets I gave the Court a note pointing out several examples of such
divergences.

My speech, given in two sessions, lasted some three or four hours. Having finished the
speech that had been completely written and typed out. I submitted a copy to the Court.
After the speeches of the defense, the assistant prosecutor spoke again so as to give an
opportunity for private [civil] accusers to pour their bile and malice upon the unfortunates.
After that came our turn, and we gave an appropriate answer to the slanderers. The Court
declared a recess and left for deliberations. This was at ten o’clock in the morning. We
defense attorneys left the court. The defendants were returned to prison since deliberations
could last several hours.

During the Court’s deliberations, all the dark forces were set in motion, and all buttons
were pushed, and all means used. Today, when we visited the prison for consultations with
the condemned, and an officer of the prison guard said that the presiding judge who brought
out such a draconian verdict was afraid to leave the hall of the trial and kept asking the guard
to make sure that there would be no one in his way. From 10 a.m. to 8 p.m. when the verdict
was announced, the public did not leave the hall, expressed its impatience, and constantly
made its presence known by uttering prayers like exclamations.

And thus under pressure of these elements and of the others hidden from the eyes of
ordinary mortals, the Court rendered its shameful unprecedented decision. Of course, the
verdict will be appealed, but the facts remain. The criminal court consisting of five judges,
motivated by both religious fanaticism and other, more realistic, considerations, terrorized by
a fanatical clergy and a group of adventurers, brought out a verdict that was received with an
ovation by a handpicked and paid crowd, and the revulsion and indignation of all honest
people.

Dear son, I have filled ten pages but recounted only a hundredth of what I went through
during this historic trial. I shall write more. I finish for now. I kiss you…and wish you
happiness and achievements. Pray for us. Write more often. We are all in good health.

Yours, Kazem

Account 2: Kazem Kazemzadeh’s Firsthand Account of Defending Baha’is
from Yazd in 1954
My Dear Firuz:
… I could not answer your letter in a timely fashion because I was busy at the trial.

As you know, two years ago a so-called criminal court in Tehran condemned nine
members of the Spiritual Assembly of Yazd accused of subornation to the murder of an
unfortunate woman, who lived in Abarqu, and of her five children to three years’
imprisonment; and three Baha’i peasants indicted for the murder of the members of that
family to execution; and two more Baha’is to ten years’ imprisonment each. The Supreme
Court (again so-called), after two years of procrastination, at last got enough courage to
rescind this, if you will pardon the expression, verdict as it related to the three who had been
condemned to death, to one member of the Spiritual Assembly who had been sentenced to
three years at hard labor, and to another Baha’i, condemned to ten years at hard labor. As far
as the last two men were concerned, the verdict was voided for the simple reason that both
convicted men were over sixty years old, and the law does not provide for hard labor for old
people.

The case of these five was remanded to the Second Section of the Criminal Court for a
new trial. The members of this court, particularly its presiding judge, were relatively decent
and honest men. The trial began on June 13 and lasted fourteen days. At first everything
went well, and all of us got the impression that all the defendants would be exculpated. The
defense team consisted of me, Navidi, and Razi.115 In addition to the assistant prosecutor…
our adversaries were four other…lawyers.

When our turn came, Mr. Razi in a very ardent speech refuted all the slanderous
accusations. Then our opponents resorted to their old tired weapon—there materialized at
the trial mullahs, bearded men with rosary beads, fanatics, followers of Navvab Safavi,
founder of the Fadayan-e Eslam group; there appeared the murderers of the former minister
Hazhir and of Kasravi.116 As I spoke, one heard shouts, curses and threats. Order was

115 Aziz Navidi was also a lawyer in the 1952 trial. Razi was a highly respected Muslim lawyer and writer. (F.
Kazemzadeh)
116 Navvab Safavi, founder of Fadayan-e Eslam, a terrorist group that advocated the establishment of Islamic

state and carried out the assassination of several prominent statesmen, including Prime Minister Ali Razmara.
Safavi was hanged in 1956. Abdol Hoseyn Hashir had served in several cabinets and as prime minister. Ahmad

maintained in the court by some thirty policemen and outside by a regiment of soldiers.

Admission to the trial was only by tickets that were distributed by the prosecutor. Whenever
an applicant was recognized as a Baha’i, he was refused a ticket.

The closer we came to the end of the trial, the more furious became the attacks of the
enemies. There appeared newspaper articles targeting the defendants. Three days before the
end of the trial, leaflets were distributed in the hall calling for the death penalty for all the
accused. After my first speech, when the judges had not yet left the hall, one character in
clerical grab, a big fellow (later we heard that he was Kasravi’s murderer) shouted at full
throat, “We demand the death penalty for all the defendants. Otherwise we will hang them
ourselves and will cut to pieces their defense attorneys and the members of the Court.”

The day before the end of the trial, taking advantage of mourning on the occasion of the
Imam’s death, a crowd of shopkeepers, tramps, and adventurers gathered in a mosque.
Speeches were made, calling to finish with Baha’i murderers, to march to the court, and to
demand the harshest punishment of the accused. And, as is the custom, all sorts of idle
stories and fairy tales circulated about the Baha’is who supposedly bribed everyone and
everything. Fortunately, the authorities took appropriate measures and prohibited the
crowd’s leaving the mosque.

On the eve of the trial’s last day, a member of parliament, to intimidate the Court and the
minister of justice of himself, asked the government a question, made up by our enemies,
about the course of the trial. The last three days of the trial presented an interesting picture.
Through the corridors of the court there marched arrogantly back and forth all sorts of
terrorist fanatics. Behind them, like obedient slaves, crawled young men with black beards.
Every moment one heard the thunder of “Salavat” [God’s blessing], as some mullah appealed
to the faithful to defend the foundations of Islam form the infidels, and the crowd shouted
“Sallallah Muhammad va al-e Muhammad” [God’s benedictions upon Muhammad and
Muhammad’s family]. Others were recounting the tragic death of a Muslim woman and her
five children at the hands of apostates. Sounds like wailing rose from the crowd. At the
doors of the court there stood armed gendarmes. We were stared at as if we were monsters.
At the end of each session we defense lawyers were surrounded by policemen who
accompanied us to the cars because there was information about preparations of an attempt
at our assassination. In addition to the police, we were guarded, secretly, by ten to fifteen
[Baha’i] young men.

Obviously, to render a just verdict in the case of innocent Baha’is in such an atmosphere
heroes would have been needed; but since the judges were not heroes but just common
contemporary Persians, all these demonstrations, threats, and pressures had their requisite
effect, and they brought out the following verdict: the three men who had been condemned
to death at the previous trial were given ten years in prison. The member of the Spiritual
Assembly of Yazd was acquitted because the fact of his participation in and presence at the
meetings of the Assembly had not been proved. The old man who had been sentenced to
ten years was given five years.

At first we were all stunned by this unjust verdict. But gradually, as passions subsided,
and we coolly weighed all the circumstance, we came to the conclusion that even for that we
should say, “Thank you.”

Kasravi, philologist, historian, and polemicist, was murdered in court at his trial in Tehran by a follower of
Safavi. (F. Kazemzadeh)

Two weeks of the trial have completely frayed my nerves, and now, when by every article
of every law I deserve a rest. I must again perform the heavy duties of the secretary of the
National Spiritual Assembly because Mr. Furutan left for the provinces, and his trip will last
about four or five months. I have filled six pages, and they are waiting for me at the
Assembly’s office. Kiss my lovely and dear granddaughter….I kiss you.

Account 3: Given the extremely volatile and intense anti-Baha’i atmosphere of
the trial of the Baha’is defendants, a number of Baha’i young men, including
the late father of the present translator, were asked to serve as bodyguards for
the Baha’i lawyers during these trials. One of these bodyguards, Iraj Ayman, has
recorded his recollections of the 1954 trial and notes, “I was an eyewitness to
the horrifying scene of that maliciously staged trial of innocent Baha’is,
including members of the Spiritual Assembly of the Baha’is of Yazd.”117

would not dare to stop those who were shouting abuse and slander at us and
were disgracing the Founders of the Baha’i Faith, Baha’u’llah, and the Bab.
We could see how the Baha’i lawyers were courageously putting their own
lives at great risk. All the time I was marveling at their courage, and I was
extremely afraid for their safety. I testify that there is no exaggeration in what
Kazem Kazemzadeh has written. As a matter of fact, he has written it in a
very mild language that does not fully picture the great ordeal that he and
others experienced. I vividly remember those situations.

Part 2
Suppression of the Baha’is of Iran in 1955

Introduction118
Persecution and slaying of the Babis and Baha’is were part of the daily activities of the clerics
and monarchs of the Qajar dynasty. For religious and political reasons, this propensity to kill
Babis and Baha’is continued up until the conclusion of the Qajar era.

The [Azali] Babis had an important role in the Constitutional Movement of Iran, and
indeed one could claim that their efforts to advance the Constitutional Revolution were
critical and constructive. However, this fact does not imply that Baha’is were not supportive
of constitutional rule, as it must be understood that their leaders insisted that Baha’is should
not participate in partisan political activities, in order that the newly founded Baha’i
community would remain immune from the attacks of those who sought to establish a
Shari‘ah-based constitution, and who were among the leading clerics of the time.

[The Iranian constitution of 1906, and 1907 supplementary legislation, created the
foundation for institutionalized discrimination against the Baha’is.119 Although these
documents were based on the model of Belgium’s 1831 constitution, its provisions
guaranteeing freedom of worship were conspicuously omitted.120 While subsequent
legislation gave some recognition to Christians, Jews, and Zoroastrians as equal citizens
before state law, it also “gave unprecedented institutional powers to the clerical
establishment” and did not guarantee freedom of religion.121]

Reza Shah’s Reign
[Whereas in the nineteenth century, suppression of the Baha’is had impact on individual
adherents, towards the end of the Qajar era these attacks were accompanied by centrally
directed campaigns that targeted the Baha’i community in general terms and its institutions
in particular.]

During the rule of Reza Shah, several towns witnessed Baha’i killings. However, as a
whole, persecution of Baha’is was not one of the political objectives of Reza Shah’s era, as
his main goal was to limit the influence of religious clerics. It was during his reign that the
notion of millat [national identity] acquired its roots, and to some degree, the religious

118 This translation was previously published in Baha’i Studies Review and appears in this monograph in an

expanded form with the kind permission of that journal’s editor.
119 The constitutional laws contained provisions that were later used to restrict the activities of the Baha’i

community. See, for example, a circular by the Minister of Interior dated 1957, Iqdam Kunid ta az Majami Baha’i
Khuddari Shavad [Stop the Baha’is from congregating] asserting that Baha’is meetings had been taking place in
violation of Article 21 of the Constitution, which prohibited gatherings of all organizations which generated
threats to religion or state and disturbed order.
120 See Browne, The Persian Revolution of 1905–1909, p. 375, for the full text of the provisions.
121 One of the justifications given for closing the Baha’i Tarbiyat schools in Tehran was that “the Iranian

Government has not recognized the Baha’i religion as it has other minority religions.” See The Baha’i World, vol.
6, p. 26.

identity of ummat [body of the believers] was gradually replaced by millat. That is, the country
was moving in a direction such that citizens would consider themselves Iranians without
concern for religious belief, political orientation or tribal affiliation. However, in the years
after Reza Shah’s demise, that policy was gradually abandoned and, once more, the idea of
ummat Islami [the body of Muslims] entered political discourse. Moreover, the Cold War
against the Soviet Union and the Eastern Bloc reinforced this idea among the political
figures of Iran.

The organization of Fada’iyan Islam [Devotees of Islam] was founded after Reza Shah
had been deposed and was an effort to combat leftist tendencies in Iran.

Post-Reza Shah
In the 1940s and 1950s, the persecution of religious minorities—particularly the Baha’is—on
the pretext that they opposed the Shi‘i religion or had leftist tendencies, forced the
government and the Shah, especially after the events of September 1941,122 to follow the
blind alley of ummat Islami and obliged them to openly contravene the principles of the
Constitutional Revolution and the country’s adopted constitution. Almost all political and
prominent personalities of every faction significantly contributed to this wayward political
path and forced Iranian society’s accelerated departure from the established norms of
democratic principles enshrined in the goals of the Constitutional Revolution. A golden
opportunity for strengthening democracy in Iran was lost, and the chance to gain popular
support for the implementation of improvements and reforms, even within a controlled
framework, was lost to the Shah and the government.

With Reza Shah’s departure, intense criticism of his reign began. The clerical
establishment, like termites, began gnawing at the foundations of the nation’s democratic
system. As a result, every aspect of modern life, enlightened thought, social progress, and
liberty became a toy in the hands of the reactionary forces in Iran. After 20 Shahrivar
[September 11, 1941, the day of Reza Shah’s departure], the entire Shi‘i ecclesiastical order,
joined by the ruling class, arose and once again forced women to wear chadors and veils, and
strove to close all mixed-gender schools. Islamic propaganda groups and societies were
organized throughout the country and began disseminating publications on “the truths and
teachings of Islam,” as well as various religious pamphlets, daily newspapers, and weekly or
monthly journals—all of which had the suffix of Islam or Islamic in their titles.

In summary, the clerics’ long-held hatred of the Babis, and then of the Baha’i
movement, surfaced once again, and the field for expressing animosity and abhorrence of
religious minorities, particularly the Baha’is, as well as exponents of enlightened and
progressive thought among Iranians, opened up. At the insistence of the religious leaders
[maraji‘-yi taqlid, literally: “focuses of emulation”] Islamic training and religious propaganda
were interjected in the curricula of all elementary and high schools throughout the nation.123

122 The forced abdication of Reza Shah by the Allies during World War II and the installation of his son
Muhammad Reza Pahlavi as Shah.
123 Prohibitions against the Baha’is ranged from the censorship of Baha’i literature to the closure of Baha’i

schools in the 1930s and 1940s. Two of the largest schools closed were the Tarbiyat boys’ and girls’ schools in
Tehran, with an estimated 1,500 pupils combined; see The Baha’i World, vol. 6, pp. 27 and 96, listing Baha’i
schools closed throughout the country. While similar measures were directed against the Armenian, Jewish, and
Zoroastrian minorities, the practice of non-recognition of Baha’i marriages was specifically targeted at that
community.

All of these developments took place in Tehran and other cities during the 1940s and
centered on opposition to Baha’is, to Ahmad Kasravi and his supporters, and to the Tudeh
Party and its members, and occurred under the supervision of the government and in most
instances with the financial and organizational support of the authorities. In truth, it was the
clerical order that established the notion of Da’iy Jan Napoleon124 among Iranians who suspect
that whatever occurs in Iran is the work of foreign agents. Fabricated documents, such as the
Memoirs of Prince Dolgorukii,125 which was manufactured by the fiction-weaving pen of Ali
Javahir-Kalam126 and published with the financial support of Astan Quds Radavi127 and the
backing of the leading Shi‘i clerics [maraji‘], were disseminated. This was just one example of
many such products that originated from the clerical establishment.128

In reality, the widespread perfidious belief that “any non-Islamic idea is the creation of
foreigners” stemmed from the fusty minds of the mullas. Through this devious approach,
they attached such labels as “anti-Iranian” and “foreign” to everything that was not Islamic
and which could threaten or undermine the power of these religion-mongers in Iran. This
deceitful “Othering,” this spreading of the seeds of conflict and enmity, not only engulfed
religious minorities, progressive nationalistic parties, and independent leftist groups but also,
in the long run, even raised questions about the government itself and about constitutional
rule. It became an excuse for the clerics to proclaim widely the claim that the people’s
Constitutional Revolution, which in reality had taken place in protest against clerical
influence and the absolutist rule of the Qajar, was an exploit of the Russian and British
governments in order to serve their own interests. They occupied themselves with
propagating this baseless idea, insisting that constitutional rule and secular law were
fundamentally at variance with the true religion of Islam and with Iran’s historical tradition.

[Politically weak, and faced with growing nationalism and acute economic difficulties,
Muhammad-Reza Shah ceded control over certain religious affairs to the clergy. This power-
sharing resulted, inter alia, in a campaign of persecution against the Baha’is which, some
scholars believe, was most likely intended by the government to distract the citizenry from
the country’s other problems.129]

124 Da’i Jan Napoleon is a masterpiece of socio-political satire by the renowned satirist Iraj Pizishkzad. In the
course of this entertaining and fascinating novel, which was later made into a popular play, Pizishkzad discloses
the Iranian tendency to think that behind every misfortune is the hand of foreigners, particularly the British.
For a discussion of the Iranian preoccupation with conspiracy, see Momen, “Conspiracy Theories and
Forgeries: The Baha’i Community of Iran and the Construction of an Internal Enemy.”
125 Prince Dimitri Dolgorukov [Dolgorukii] was the Russian Tsar’s ambassador to Iran, 1845–54. The book,

Memoirs of Kinyaz Dolgorukii, a creation of the troubled mind of ‘Ali Javahir-Kalam, endeavors to connect the
Babi and Baha’i movements to Tsarist Russia. At first, this book attracted considerable attention in Iran, but
soon the fact that it was a mere forgery was thoroughly established by historians and religious researchers. In a
well-regarded article, Professor ‘Abbas Iqbal Ashtiyani proved these memoirs to be a forgery created by
troublemakers (Yadigar, year 5, numbers 8 and 9). Professor Mujtaba Minuvi considers these memoirs to be a
forgery and the forger to be an Iranian (Rahnamih-yi Kitab, year 6, numbers 1 and 2). Similarly, refer to

Kinyaz Dolgorukii to Ali Javahir-Kalam. However, subsequent research has proven this not to be the case. A
detailed analysis will be the subject of a forthcoming study by Mina Yazdani.

Early 1955 Opposition to Baha’is
It was stated earlier that after the coup d’état of 28 Murdad 1332 [August 19, 1953],130 the
mullas insisted that their significant contribution to the coup d’état be recognized and that
this was only possible by the suppression of the Tudeh Party and the Baha’is.

[One of the well-known anti-Baha’i propagandists, whose commentaries were widely
circulated by the Iranian media in the mid-1950s, was a populist preacher named Shaykh
Muhammad-Taqi Falsafi, a collaborator of Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini.131 Falsafi enjoyed
the support and encouragement of prominent religious figures.132 This is documented in a
letter of encouragement from Ayatollah Siyyid Husayn Burujirdi, who in 1946 had become
the Shi‘i’s “source of emulation,” the religion’s highest office.133 In 1951, Falsafi approached
Prime Minister Dr. Muhammad Musaddiq on behalf of Ayatollah Burujirdi in order to
discuss the Baha’is and their activities, but he was rebuffed by Musaddiq who rejected the
idea that the Baha’is were any different than Muslim Iranians. However, after the 1953 coup,
Falsafi approached the pro-monarchist government to once again press for action against the
Baha’is.]

The disreputable and notorious preacher Hujjatu’l-Islam Muhammad-Taqi Falsafi has
stated in his memoirs that his sermons against the Baha’is took place with the prior consent
of Ayatu’llah Burujirdi and Muhammad-Reza Shah. In an interview on May 10, 1955, with a
reporter of Itihad-i Milli Journal, Falsafi described his meeting with Ayatu’llah Burujirdi in
these words:

> Before the blessed month of Ramadan, I went to Qum where I met Ayatu’llah
> Burujirdi and found him deeply distressed. He stated, “Now that the situation of the
> oil industry has been resolved and the matter of the Tudeh Party has been disposed
> of, we must make plans concerning the Baha’is and confront this challenge.”

In Khatirat va Mubarizat [Memories and struggles], Muhammad-Taqi Falsafi writes:

> My religious duty compelled me not to be indifferent about this sect, and in spite of
> their connections to the government, to propagate against them in my sermons.…

130 This is a reference to the coup of 28 Murdad 1332 against the government of Dr. Muhammad Musaddiq. It
is commonly called by Iranians the “28 Murdad coup” but will be referred to as the “1953 coup” in the rest of
this translation. Musaddiq, who was the elected prime minister of Iran from 1951 to 1953, was a nationalist and
passionately opposed foreign intervention in Iran. He was also the architect of the nationalization of the Iranian
oil industry, which had been dominated and exploited by the British through the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company
(today known as British Petroleum). Muhammad Reza Shah Pahlavi removed him from power in a CIA-
orchestrated coup, supported and funded by the British and the US governments.
131 Falsafi’s published memoir acknowledges openly that Falsafi “played an important role in combat with

Baha’ism”; see Davani, Khatirat va Mubarizat Hujjatu’l Islam Muhammad-Taqi Falsafi.
132 See Didari Az Ayatollah Burujirdi az ‘Abbas Furutan [Report by ‘Abbas Furutan on his visit with authorities in

Qum], Ashuftih, no. 19, 7–10, 22/2/1334 (May 13, 1955), referring to Falsafi as a representative of Ayatollah
Burujirdi in Tehran and in the Shah’s court, and stating that Shaykh Ahmad Khadimi, Siyyid Mustafa Khansari,
and Taliqani met with Furutan and discussed their support for Falsafi and his actions.
133 See Namih Hadrat Ayatu’llah ul‘uzma Burujirdi [Letter from Grand Ayatollah Burujirdi]; the letter was recited

by Hujjatu’l-Islam Falsafi during sermon at Sultani Mosque; Pust Tehran, no. 581, 18/2/1334 (May 9, 1955).
Falsafi’s memoir (p. 202, n. 1) states that his anti-Baha’i sermons in 1955 “were done with the previous
agreement of Ayatollah Burujirdi and had his complete support.”

Ayatu’llah Burujirdi sent me a message to convey the issue [of the Baha’is] to the
> governmental authorities….Eventually, after May 1953 [Ramadan 1332], he sent me
> a letter instructing me to meet with the Shah and to express the Ayatu’llah’s
> disapproval and displeasure over the matter of [the relative freedom of] the
> Baha’is….Before May 1954 [Ramadan 1333], I asked Ayatu’llah Burujirdi, “Are you
> supportive of the idea that I discuss the situation of Baha’is during my radio
> sermons which are broadcast live from the Shah Mosque?” He thought for a
> moment and then responded, “If you did, it would be good. For now, the
> authorities are paying little attention [to the suppression and annihilation of Baha’is].
> At least that would put them [the Baha’is] in a bad light in the field of public
opinion.”

He added further, “It is necessary to mention this to the Shah beforehand so
> that he would not have an excuse later to intercede, ruin everything and terminate
> the radio broadcasts. Such a thing would be most unfortunate for the Muslims as it
would embolden the Baha’is.”

I called the Shah’s office and requested an appointment. When I met the Shah, I
> stated, “Ayatu’llah Burujirdi has consented that the issue of the Baha’is, which is a
> cause of concern for Muslims, be dealt with and discussed in my radio sermons
> during the month of Ramadan. Would your Majesty consent as well?”

Falsafi relates that the Shah remained silent for a moment and then said, “Go and preach
accordingly.”134 [Falsafi also encouraged other preachers who were giving sermons during
Ramadan to raise the Baha’i issue in their sermons, which they did.]

From 1948 (1327), each Ramadan, Falsafi used to deliver sermons against the Tudeh
Party. Elimination and annihilation of the Babis and Baha’is was the cherished desire of the
mullas and their partners in the government. During those days, it was widely said that
strikes against Baha’is and destruction of their administrative and religious centers were
government objectives. However, this had to wait until May 1955 (Ramadan 1334).

134 Davani, Khatirat va Mubarizat Hujjatu’l-Islam Falsafi, pp. 200ff. In the same book, various documents and

accounts are found that illustrate how the mullas and political figures worked hand-in-hand against the Baha’i
community and strove to suppress and harm them. They even entertained the idea of adopting a parliamentary
measure that would make it illegal to be a Baha’i. These documents clearly prove that the Shah and his
appointed prime minister, Asadu’llah ‘Alam, were active partners in these undertakings. In Haqiqat-Pizhu, A’in-
i Baha’i Yik Nihdat Siyasi Nist, after proving that the Baha’i faith has no political objective, the various
objections raised by the leaders of the Islamic Republic are addressed and answered. For example, the author(s)
have noted the manifold problems that the Baha’is had with the government during Reza Shah’s reign. In 1941,
a number of Baha’is of Yazd were imprisoned on the charge of being Baha’is. In 1943, local Baha’i centers in
various cities were confiscated, and some were destroyed. In 1946, a number of Baha’is were killed in Kashan
and Shahrud, and the perpetrators were never arrested. In 1951, a jihad (religious war) against Baha’is was
proclaimed, and they were accused of collaboration with the communists. After Shaykh Muhammad-Taqi
Falsafi’s sermons in 1955, Baha’is were persecuted throughout Iran, and a number of them were killed. In 1956,
the Baha’is complained to the United Nations about these persecutions and discriminations. From 1956 until
1963, Baha’i gatherings were proclaimed unlawful by the government. Finally, in September 1978, SAVAK
organized anti-Baha’i riots in Shiraz aimed at diverting the Revolution and turning it into an uprising against the
Baha’is. Over 300 Baha’i homes were plundered and then set on fire. In Paris, Ayatu’llah Khomeini spoke of
this incident and pointed out its true character. (BC)

Baha’i Center in Tehran (prior to 1955)

1955 Baha’i Persecution
In accordance with Ayatu’llah Burujirdi’s wishes, soon after the 1953 coup, the attack against
the Baha’is began to be included in the broadcasts of Falsafi’s sermons, delivered during
Ramadan of 1334 [1955]. [Falsafi states, “Speeches against the Baha’is in the Shah Mosque
and their broadcast from the radio caused a strange stir in the country, and people who had
suffered at the hands of this wayward sect were excited. Everywhere one went, there was talk
of the necessity of suppressing the Baha’is, who were connected to Zionism and America.”135
In the third week of Ramadan, the Military Governor of Tehran, Taymur Bakhtiar, ordered
his forces to occupy the National Baha’i Center in Tehran, an important religious site.136]

The brutal attack led to the confiscation of Baha’i properties in every city by the
government. In Tehran, on May 22, 1955, in front of the cameras of both foreign and
domestic reporters, Lieutenant-General [Nader] Batmanqlich, the chief of staff of the
Iranian army, along with [Brigadier-General] Taymur Bakhtiar, the military commander of
Tehran, took pickaxes and demolished the dome of the Baha’i Center.137 [The Muslim
Spiritual Community of Qum subsequently issued a statement applauding the destruction of
this “house of corruption” and stated that this act had attracted “special attention from the
Mahdi and had certainly met with the agreement of His Majesty the Shah.”138] For many
years, that building was impounded by the military and used as its own command center.139

strike with a pickaxe], Ittila‘at, 31/2/1334 (May 22, 1955), stating that Batmanqlich delivered the first blow to
the building, Bakhtiar was present and assisted, and Falsafi was also present. Bakhtiar was supported by the
Muslim clergy; see “Mulaqat Timsar Bakhtiar ba Ayatu’llah Burujirdi” [The meeting of General Bakhtiar with
Ayatu’llah Burujirdi], Ittihad Millat, 29/5/1334, [August 21, 1955] reporting that Burujirdi thanked Bakhtiar for
his work during the month of Ramadan.

of by both religious and secular authorities.
139 In 1957, an order was issued for the return of the National Baha’i Center in Tehran to the Baha’i

community. See The Baha’i World, vol. 8, p. 295.

Generals Batmanqlich and Bakhtiar demolishing Tehran’s Baha’i Center

General Muhammad Ayarmalu, the deputy-chief of the most powerful branch of
government, namely, the Department for Security and Information [SAVAK], writes the
following in his memoirs:

> One morning, Lieutenant-General Batmanqlich, the chief of staff of the army, along
> with Brigadier-General Taymur Bakhtiar, the military commander, climbed the
dome of the Baha’i Center [in Tehran] and using pickaxes began to demolish it.

The next morning, the military attaché of the United States came to my office
> and in a voice shaking with rage protested, “What was this act that the chief of staff
> committed? Why would the military chief take up an axe, and before the gaze of
> multitudes, demolish a building? Furthermore, he destroyed a building that is deeply
> respected and cherished by many of your citizens! My country is assisting Iran to
repair the ruins, and now you turn a beautiful building into a ruin?”

As I, too, could not find any logical reason for this destruction—particularly by
> the hands of such a high-ranking officer—I remained quiet and said nothing in the
> face of this rebuke from the American attaché.

A few hours later, the late Batmanqlich summoned me into his office and
> impatiently asked, “What are the military attachés saying about yesterday’s
occurrences?”

I openly shared the comments of the American military attaché and added,
> “Several more of the military attachés have expressed their perplexity and
> disappointment over this incident.” When I saw signs of distress in his face, I asked,
> “General, what truly motivated you to undertake this act?” He lifted his head and
> responded, “I had no motives. It was the chief’s order.” And by that he meant the
late Muhammad-Reza Shah.

As later I read in various publications, Muhammad-Reza Shah had given this
> order in order to appease several influential akhunds, particularly Siyyid Abu’l-
> Qasem Kashani….It is ironic to note that twenty-five years later [in the Islamic
> Revolution of 1979], the late Muhammad-Reza Shah witnessed the result of giving
> so much license to the akhunds. Also twenty-five years later, when General
> Batmanqlich was arrested and prosecuted at the height of the 1357 [1979]
> Revolution, he recounted this incident in his semi-successful defense.”140

140   Ararmalu, Yadvarih Yik Bachih Qazaq, pp. 213–14. (BC)

[By Ramadan 10, Minister of Interior Amir Asadu’llah ‘Alam was sufficiently alarmed by the
violence that he contacted Falsafi to voice his concerns that Falsafi’s sermons were
disrupting the security of the nation. ‘Alam wrote in his memoir:

> Falsafi managed to fool both the Shah and the military authorities and start a
> campaign against the Baha’is that dragged the country to the edge of disaster. It was
> Ramadan. [Falsafi’s] noon sermons were broadcast throughout the nation via radio
> and caused violence and terror in many locations. People killed a few Baha’is here
> and there. Falsafi justified these acts by saying that they increased the Shah’s
> prestige. I had no choice but to order him, in my own rash way, to refrain from
> giving further speeches until order was reestablished.141

Falsafi was not so easily deterred, and as a result, a week or so later, the Shah sent the head
of the police force, General Alavi Muqaddam, and Brigadier-General Taymur Bakhtiar, to
order Falsafi to stop referring to the Baha’is in his sermons, as it was creating a security
concern. Falsafi bluntly refused to comply with the order:

> It is not possible….If you want to discontinue the radio broadcasts, do it. Arrest me
> if you want to. Otherwise, I must continue my speeches until the end of
> Ramadan.…If I do not say anything…I will dishonor Islam and marja‘ [highest-
> ranking clergy], and I will never do that.142

Falsafi continued his sermons until the end of Ramadan and avoided arrest, but he was never
again admitted into the Shah’s presence and was henceforth banned from preaching the
Friday sermon at Shah Mosque, at the time one of the country’s most influential religious
platforms.

The general attack against the Baha’i community and its institutions, as well as the well-
publicized seizure of the National Baha’i Center, provoked further anti-Baha’i attacks outside
of Tehran. On July 28, 1955, in the village of Hurmuzdak in Yazd, seven Baha’is, ranging in
age from nineteen to eighty years old, were killed by a large mob who hacked them to pieces
with spades and axes. In Shiraz, parts of the house of the Bab, one of the Baha’i faith’s most
sacred sites, were damaged. Raids and attacks on the Baha’is in nearby villages resulted in
800 apparently coerced recantations by members of the Baha’i faithful which were signed
and submitted to the local Islamic authorities.143 In Rasht, Ahvaz, Shiraz, Isfahan, Karaj,
Mahfuruzak, Abadeh, Reza’iyeh, Takur, and Hisar, public and private Baha’i properties were
raided and destroyed, and homes, businesses, and Baha’i centers were looted and burnt. The
Baha’i community responded to these events by appealing to various international bodies,
including the newly formed United Nations.

Even those merely sympathetic to the plight of the Baha’is might find themselves the
target of religious extremists. When the governor of Fars Province, Brigadier-General
Himmat, attempted to take action against the instigators of a local anti-Baha’i uprising, he
was accused of being a Baha’i himself and was dismissed from his post.144]

Clerical Influence over the Government
The activities of Ayatu’llah Burujirdi, and essentially the entire efforts of the Shi‘i clerical
establishment against the Baha’is, were not just aimed at securing the “foundation of the true
religion of Islam.” In fact, this undertaking was also an instrument for the clerics to portray
themselves as actual participants in the 1953 coup d’état and restoration of the Shah to his
throne.

By yielding to the illegal wishes of the religious leaders [maraji‘-yi taqlid] and the clerical
establishment after the 1953 coup d’état, the Shah and his government, in effect, placed a
stamp of approval on the clerics’ participation in the government’s exercise of power.
Through a study of documents, letters, and communications of the clerics after the 1953
coup d’état until the 1979 Revolution, we can see how intertwined and aligned the
relationship between the royal court and the government and clerics had become. This
friendly association developed into such a close relationship that, hoping to realize his
malevolent fancies, Ayatu’llah Burujirdi asked the Shah and Prime Minister Husayn ‘Ala’ to
modify the contents of the nation’s Constitution through parliamentary action. This is the
text of his letter:

> In the Name of God, the Merciful, the Compassionate.
To his Excellency [Husayn ‘Ala’] the Prime Minister, may his glory endure!

Your Excellency’s letter of 5 Tir 1334 [June 27, 1955], conveying the necessary

> through Haji Qa’im-Maqam al-Mulk Rafi‘. The essence of my suggestions, as noted
in your letter, are:
1. The Baha’i sect must be prevented from propagation [of its teachings],

which is against the true religion of Islam.
2. Their assemblies and centers for propagation, wherever found across the

country, must be closed.
3. Any employee who is not of one of the religions mentioned in the

> confirm and succor His Majesty and the government authorities in their work of

> Upon thee be the peace, mercy and bounty of God.
> 7 Dhi’l-Qa’dah 1374/7 Tir 1334 [June 28, 1955]
> Husayn at-Tabataba’i [Burujirdi]145

During that period and subsequently, Muhammad-Taqi Falsafi would cry out in warning in
every mosque and place of worship in Tehran or other cities where he preached:

145   Manzuru’l-Ajdad, ed., Marja‘iyat dar ‘Arsih Ijtima‘ va Siyasat, p. 498. (BC)

Brave merchants, employees, students, and workers of Iran! Arise and combat these

> Shah, the prime minister, and members of the national parliament] and completely
> exterminate them, so that it will be proven that [Imam] ‘Ali is alive, the Prophet [of
> Islam] is alive and the religion of Islam will not fade away. Do not permit this illegal
> government to belittle Islam any longer!

After its successful role in the 1953 coup d’état, the clerical establishment would attribute
every political, societal, or economic reform to Baha’i designs, and through this stratagem
would provoke religious sentiments, as well as inflame the latent anti-Baha’i attitude among
the Iranian people. Whenever the Shah or the government retreated on these announced
reforms, the clerics and Shi‘i religious leaders would refer to “an agreement having been
reached between the government and the clerics,” or to “the defeat of the government,” or
would say, “Through God’s will, the strivings of the courageous nation of Islam and the
indefatigable clerics, we won a mighty victory!”146

In a telegram to the Shah, Ayatu’llah Siyyid Muhammad [Musavi] Bihbahani stated, “I
OFFER MY HEARTFELT GRATITUDE FOR CLOSING THIS CENTER OF RELIGIOUS AND
NATIONAL SEDITION [i.e., the Haziratu’l-Quds, the Baha’i center in Tehran] THROUGH THE
EFFORTS OF THE ISLAMIC ARMY, AND CONSIDER THIS AUSPICIOUS EVENT TO BE AMONG THE

ANNUAL RELIGIOUS EVENTS WORTHY OF CELEBRATION.”                In response to Ayatu’llah
Bihbahani, the Shah noted, “As you have repeatedly heard us state, we consider ourselves
bound to carry out the requirements of Islam and beseech the Almighty to continue
confirming us in this undertaking.”

In a cable to the Shah, Ayatu’llah Burujirdi referred to the Baha’is as “enemies and
trouble-makers” to the royal throne, and stated, “MAY GOD, EXALTED BE HIS STATION,
PROTECT THE SACRED RELIGION OF ISLAM AND IRAN’S MONARCHY FROM THE HARM OF THE
ENEMY AND MISCHIEF-MAKERS, AND MAY HE PRESERVE YOUR MAJESTY OVER ALL
MUSLIMS.”

In a letter to Muhammad-Taqi Falsafi, Ayatu’llah Burujirdi—the marja‘ at-taqlid [object
of emulation] for all Shi‘ih—had expressed gratitude for his “precious services” to “the
sacred religion of Islam, and indeed to all religions, and to the holy Qur’an.” He wrote that
since Baha’is held many high positions in the government, the highest priority was therefore
to remove them all from every agency, department, and bureau of the government, and from
every other position of influence. In an interview with the newspaper Kayhan, he expressed
his wish for the destruction of the Haziratu’l-Quds in Tehran, expulsion of Baha’is from all
governmental and official positions, and the adoption of a parliamentary plan to forcibly
expel all Baha’is from Iran.

Falsafi participating in the destruction of Tehran’s Baha’i Center

From the pulpit, Muhammad-Taqi Falsafi never hesitated to spread every manner of
false and vicious rumor, intended to provoke the simple-minded, fanatical, and superstitious
people against the Baha’is. He used the well-trained techniques of such preachers148 and
made up false stories, saying:

> One of the members of the Tudeh [Communist Party] disclosed to me, “As every
> arena of activity was closed to us and since we heard that the Baha’is intended to
> initiate a coup d’état the following year, we, therefore gravitated towards them so
> that we could make a big impact. In order to prove our interest in the Baha’i
> religion, we even married Baha’i women in accordance with their traditional
> ceremony.”

In response to objections from the international community and its agencies, and possibly
also the protests from Western countries against the maltreatment of Baha’is in Iran, Falsafi
devised a new trick. From the pulpit he would say, “We have not spoken of religion. Our
only concern is the group who wears a religious mask, and it is against them that we speak.”

Falsafi’s Ties to America
Falsafi himself declared from a pulpit that he had close affiliations with the agents of the
American embassy—a place described by Ayatu’llah Ruhu’llah Khomeini as “the nest of
spies.” In a resonant voice he would proclaim, “I told the Americans that Muslims were
fighting the Tudeh Party and, if they were to support the Baha’is, it would be like supporting
the Tudeh Party, which is an enemy of America.”

In this way, Muhammad-Taqi Falsafi painted himself as America’s supporter in their
fight against communism and socialism in Iran, and insinuated that the Cold War waged by
the Americans and their European allies was in reality also aimed at combating the Baha’is,

148   Rawdih-khan—these reciters of the story of the Imams would also preach as part of their performances.

and that their supporters were part of the same policy framework. His implication was that
the suppression of Baha’is was not a religious issue but a struggle to guard Iran’s national
unity as part of the overall plan to fight worldwide communism.149

Muntaziri’s Role in the Persecution of Baha’is
The anti-Baha’i activities of Ayatu’llah Burujirdi were not limited to launching Falsafi, the
preacher, on his theological outbursts against the Baha’is. He dispatched his seminary
students and hired thugs to every corner of the country to provoke the already inflamed
religious fanatics to murder Baha’is and plunder their properties. Based on information from
hundreds of relevant documents, the present author can only briefly draw attention to the
activities of Shaykh Husayn-‘Ali Muntaziri, who was one of the most mischievous clerics
under the tutelage of Ayatu’llah Burujirdi.

At that time, Shaykh Husayn-‘Ali Muntaziri was a young seminarian, but in the winter of
his life he reached the rank of Grand Ayatu’llah and was a deputy to Ayatu’llah Ruhu’llah
Khomeini, the supreme leader of the Islamic Revolution. He has made public a lengthy
account of his life and without any hesitation—indeed with great pride—has recounted
many events. Here we note only a few passages:

> The late Burujirdi was extremely anti-Baha’i. For instance, they had killed a Baha’i
> near Yazd and planned to execute his murderer.…Burujirdi had lost sleep over this
> and wanted to prevent this hanging by any possible means. [Through the illegal
> exertions of Ayatu’llah Burujirdi and the collusion of the government, the murderer
was set free.]

One year, Burujirdi instructed Falsafi to give sermons against the Baha’is on the
> radio during Ramadan. Ayatu’llah Kashani also concurred with this. At the
> beginning of Ramadan, Falsafi began his preaching against Baha’is. That year his
> sermons became very popular and people would gather around the radio to listen to
him.…

[It was about this time that Muntaziri was given a mission to go to Najafabad.] I
> asked Ayatu’llah Burujirdi about business dealings, trade, and commerce with
> Baha’is, and in response he issued a written fatwa [religious judgment] stating: “In
> His Name, the Exalted! It is incumbent upon all Muslims to leave off all association,
relationship, and dealings with this sect [the Baha’is].…”

News of the proclamation spread throughout the city and received a great deal
> of publicity in mosques and other public places….With the announcement of this
> religious ruling, an atmosphere of extreme tension was created against the Baha’is in
Najafabad.

At that time, I gathered representatives from every class and occupation of
> Najafabad, and each was asked to produce a proclamation against Baha’is. For
> instance, the bakers wrote, “We will not sell bread to Baha’is.” The taxi-drivers
> wrote, “We will not permit Baha’is in our cabs.”…In short, a taxi ride between
> Najafabad and Isfahan, which had previously cost one tuman, could not be had for
> fifty tumans by a Baha’i no matter how much he pleaded. Of course, these actions
> were not always based on religious faith. Many participated because they feared
> others or were forced to, due to the general social mood.…

149For more details, see Iran-Namih, a journal of Iranian Studies, published in America, special issue, 19
(Winter/Spring 2001): 1–2, devoted to the religious minorities of Iran. (BC)

Eventually, as a result of this campaign, they [the Baha’is] were all dislodged
> from Najafabad….After they were dispersed, they would hide themselves from
> public view….We extended this hostility to Isfahan as well, where a widespread
> uproar against Baha’is was initiated….After a while, it became known that I was the
> instigator and the author of these affairs.150

It was through the scheming of this “fair-minded” cleric—Ayatu’llah Muntaziri—that the
homes of the Baha’is of Najafabad were plundered and looted, and they were made to
wander homeless after being compelled to leave their native town, while the government
took no action to protect them. Further, it was by the instructions of this “propagandist”
and the “brilliant mind behind vilayat-i faqih [leadership of religious jurists]” that the Baha’i
Center of Najafabad was set on fire and burned to the ground. Muntaziri admits that
Ayatu’llah Burujirdi, “was completely aware of what was going on and was most pleased with
my activities.”

Owing to the machination of clerics more cunning than he, Muntaziri failed to become
the deputy of the Imam and even received a letter from his supreme leader dated 6 Farvardin
1368 [March 26, 1989] that will live forever in the history of the “militant clerics.” In this
letter, Khomeini addressed Muntaziri without the title of Ayatu’llah:

Your Excellency Mr. Muntaziri,

> With a broken heart and great sadness, I write this short letter so that one day the
> people may become apprised of the situation….You have forfeited the necessary
prerequisites and qualifications to become the next leader of the nation.…

(From now on,) tell the seminarians who bring you money to take the funds to
> Qum, to the home of Mr. Pasandidih (my brother) or to bring them to Tehran to
> Jamaran (my residence). Praise unto God that you have no shortage of financial
> means (thanks to the Islamic Revolution and plundering the possessions of Muslims
> and non-Muslims).

At this point in the letter, the Imam refers to his deputy as dim-witted and with the
customary language of an akhund addresses Muntaziri, “Since you are a simpleton,” you
must remain under house arrest, “perchance God would pardon you your sins.” At the
letter’s conclusion, Khomeini writes the reason for this communication:

> You have committed a treasonous act against the nameless soldiers of the Hidden
> Imam151 and the sacred blood of the martyrs for Islam and the Revolution. So that
> you would not burn in the depths of hell, you should confess your mistakes and
> sins, perchance God would aid you.

In response to this insulting letter, the deputy of Imam Khomeini, the illustrious Grand
Ayatu’llah Husayn-‘Ali Muntaziri, wrote most pathetically and meekly, “Please allow me to

continue my studies and teachings as before, like a small and insignificant seminarian, under
the wise shadow of your exalted leadership.”152

The Collusion of the Clerics and the Government
At the conclusion of Ramadan 1334 [May 1955], the most distinguished of the clerics, the
religious leaders, the renowned preachers, and those who promoted Shi‘ism from the pulpits,
along with a representative of Ayatu’llah Burujirdi gathered in the residence of Ayatu’llah
Khunsari. After discussions and consultations, the participants composed a communication
addressed to “the presence of His Majesty the King,” requesting urgent and ultimate disposal
of the Baha’is of Iran. In this letter, the Muslim clerics stated at length their submission and
fidelity to the Crown and pleaded with the Shah to conclude the situation of the Baha’is in
much the same brutal and bloody way that he had eliminated the members of the Tudeh
Party, insisting that delay would only prolong the inevitable.

The struggle to cleanse Iran of the presence of “the wayward and misguided Baha’i sect”
gradually turned into an anti-Western and anti-American struggle, and in the course of
several decades ultimately evolved into a rebellion intent on toppling the Pahlavi dynasty in
Iran.

The presence of the two highest-ranking military chiefs at the destruction of the Baha’i
Haziratu’l-Quds in Tehran was a clear sign of the Shah’s support and his government’s
encouragement of persecution and the suppression of Baha’is—an act devoid of foresight
and intended solely to appease the high-ranking clerics.…

The mullas’ activities against Baha’is were not only to protect “the foundation of the
true religion of Islam” but also an instrument by which the clerical establishment sought to
demonstrate their power and influence to the government and people alike. It was the
clerical establishment (and not, as was commonly believed among the people, due to the
unwise assertions of the Tudeh Party, Sha‘ban Khan Ja‘fari), who were the “tajbakhsh” [king
maker]. The truth was something other than what the ordinary people believed. Whenever
social reforms appeared to conflict with the interest of the clerics, the clerical establishment
would remind the Shah and his government that he wore the crown and sat on the throne
solely due to its active role in the 1953 coup d’état.

In the letters of Ayatu’llah Burujirdi, in the communications or speeches of Ayatu’llah
Khomeini prior to 15 Khurdad [the Islamic Revolution], and in the memoirs of various
clerics that are presently being published by the Islamic regime in Iran, we repeatedly see that
the Shah was warned that he owed the return of his crown to the actions of “militant clerics”
against Dr. Musaddiq’s government. In some letters, we note that they cautioned the Shah
that if he were to undertake any act that would displease the clerics or jurists, they had the
power and ability to remove him from the throne.153

153 Marja‘iyat dar ‘Arsih-yi Ijtima‘ va Siyasat. In this book, we encounter many documents discussing the

relationship between the Shah and his governments with various high-ranking clerics such as Ayatu’llahs Mirza
Muhammad Husayn Na’ini, Haji Sayyid Abu’l-Hasan Isfahani, Haji Aqa Husayn Qumi, Haji Shaykh Abdu’l-
Karim Ha’iri-Yazdi, and Haji Aqa Husayn Burujirdi. Indeed these documents would be most illuminating and
surprising for any researcher. Citing all these documents would, however, unduly prolong this brief essay. (BC)

Recollections of Dr. Ha’iri-Yazdi
Ayatu’llah ‘Abdu’l-Karim Ha’iri-Yazdi was an object of emulation (marja‘ at-taqlid) of the
Shi‘ih and the founder of a religious school in Qum. His son Dr. Mahdi Ha’iri-Yazdi studied
in Qum and later continued his advanced studies in Western philosophy in England, the
United States, and Canada. He remained in the West continuing to teach and research in
philosophy. Dr. Habib Ladjivardi has published, in the form of an interview, the memoirs of
Dr. Mahdi Ha’iri-Yazdi as part of Harvard University’s Iranian Oral History Project. Some
of these memoirs relate to events after the 1953 coup, the role of the clerics, the fall of Dr.
Musaddiq, and the collusion of the Shah with the clerics in running the country. They are
most illuminating in understanding the evolution of modern politics and religion in Iran.

Regarding the issue of vilayat-i faqih [the rule of religious jurists], Dr. Mahdi Ha’iri-Yazdi
states, “The way [the Islamic Republic] has defined this theory has no basis whatsoever. At
least I have been unable to find any evidence in the book [Qu’ran], the traditions [sunnat] or
in logic to support such a system.”

Ha’iri-Yazdi had a close relationship with Ayatu’llah Burujirdi and relates:

> On religious matters, Burujirdi would instruct the regime what to do, and the
> government would follow his wishes. For instance, he did not approve of Dr.
> Musaddiq. However, when the Shah returned from Italy [after the coup], Burujirdi
approved of him.

Dr. Musaddiq showed Burujirdi great respect, to the point that he used his
> position to pass a special legislation such that any publication which printed
> anything that offended the person of the marja‘ at-taqlid [object of emulation] would
> be banned immediately without even a trial. This law was passed solely for Burujirdi.
> It even caused annoyance to Ayatu’llah Kashani. In fact, one of the reasons that
> Kashani disassociated himself from Dr. Musaddiq was this very legislation and the
> feeling that Dr. Musaddiq had sided with Burujirdi.

Dr. Ha’iri-Yazdi recounts an incident involving Ayatu’llah Mir Siyyid Muhammad Bihbahani
which is most interesting and instructive. According to this recollection, Ayatu’llah
Bihbahani had knowledge of the 1953 coup d’état before it took place. Ha’iri-Yazdi states,
“On the morning of 28 Murdad [August 19, 1953], the sun had not yet risen, when the
phone rang.” The call was from the residence of Ayatu’llah Bihbahani with the instruction
that he should immediately come before the Ayatu’llah for “an urgent matter.” Ha’iri-Yazdi
quickly went to Bihbahani’s home and was told by the Ayatu’llah:

> This morning you should leave for Qum. Go before Burujirdi and convey to him on
> my behalf, “Master, the country is on the verge of dismemberment. Soon it will be
> ruined because there is talk of forming a republic. The Shah has left, and any day
> now the country will be thrown into chaos and disorder. It is certain that the
> country will move to the other side of the Iron Curtain. No name will remain of
> religion; no name of him [Burujirdi]; no mention of religious guidance; no memory
> of the principles of the faith. The country will become communist. He should devise
> a plan—perhaps a communication, or a ruling—so that people would be made
> aware of the truth of the matter and would rise to oppose the Tudehis. In short, do
> not allow the country to become communist.”

Ha’iri-Yazdi continues, “I should mention that just as he considered Baha’is to be the
disruptors of security and a threat to the country’s independence, Ayatu’llah Burujirdi also

viewed the Tudeh Party in the same light. And so, he combated the Tudeh Party the same
way that he combated the Baha’is.

A question was asked of Dr. Ha’iri-Yazdi regarding Ayatu’llah Burujirdi’s “intense and
open battles against the Baha’is after 1953.” Dr. Ha’iri-Yazdi responded:

> [Burujirdi] had a grand strategy.… At that time, Khomeini was one of the confidants
> of Burujirdi. In fact, it was widely acknowledged that he was Burujirdi’s foreign
> minister. This was at a time when he had not, as yet, come into conflict with
> Burujirdi. On at least one occasion during that episode, Khomeini went to the court
> and met with the Shah on Burujirdi’s behalf. After this meeting, I met with
> Khomeini. He himself explained, “Yes, I went as the emissary of Burujirdi and met
> with the Shah.” In telling this, Khomeini seemed very joyful and vigorous.
> Khomeini, continuing what he said to me, related, “I said to His Majesty, ‘The late
> Shah, your Majesty’s father, had this wayward group [the Baha’is] completely
> reduced and immobilized. And now the people of Iran expect the same from you.’”
This is exactly what Khomeini related for me.…

Burujirdi had conspired with the Shah to suppress and control these people [the
> Baha’is] as much as possible. For example, their Haziratu’l-Quds, which was their
> propaganda center located on Hafez Street, was closed. At that time, they had
> agreed on this plan—a plan in which the Shah himself was involved. They instructed
> Falsafi to commence his sermons from the pulpit in the Shah Mosque during the
> month of Ramadan and to prepare people for this. And they accomplished their
> plan.154

Dealing with “The Baha’i Problem”155
As anti-Baha’i violence flared up in cities across the country, Iranian politicians conducted
equally incendiary debates about “the Baha’i problem” in the Iranian Parliament or Majlis.
On May 10, 1955, Siyyid Ahmad Safa’i, the Qazvin deputy, with the support of Burujirdi and
Falsafi, introduced a bill in the Iranian Majlis that proposed a four-part solution to the
problem:156

> Article 1. The corrupt community of the Babis and their adherents, the Azalis and
> the Baha’is, are opposed to the security of the country and are declared illegal.

> Article 2. Henceforth, membership in this community [i.e., Baha’i], and any
> pretense or adherence to it in any way, constitutes a misdemeanor, and the
> perpetrator will be sentenced to solitary confinement from 2 to 10 years and will be
> deprived of all civil rights.

> Article 3. The properties [in the form of estate, land, or house] that are places of
> congregation and organizations related to this community, or revenue spent on
> issues related to this community, will be transferred to the Ministry of Culture to be
> used for the purpose of establishing educational organizations and spreading
> religious and godly principles.

154 Ladjevardi, Khatirat Dr Mahdi Ha’iri-Yazdi, pp. 34–59. (BC)
155 This section, to “what really destroyed the Baha’i community was the Islamic Revolution,” is quoted, with
slight alterations, from A Faith Denied: The Persecution of the Baha’is of Iran.
156 Davani, Khatirat va Mubarizat Hujjatu’l-Islam Falsafi, p. 207.

Article 4. People adhering to this community, who are serving in government
> offices and related organizations, will from this day be fired from civil service and
> will in no way be subject to the employment law [i.e., cannot be hired].157

Safa’i’s bill failed to garner sufficient support to pass into law, due in part to the
government’s anxieties over the potential international repercussions and concern about the
legality of such measures.

On May 17th, Minister of the Interior ‘Alam presented the Majlis with a draft decree the
government proposed to circulate to provincial and city governors in accordance with the
government’s decision to put down all anti-religious manifestations and demonstrations.
Some deputies complained that the decree did not explicitly identify the Baha’is as agitators,
making it difficult for the local authorities to know exactly where their duty lay, and they
pressed ‘Alam to implement the policies suggested in Safa’i’s bill. ‘Alam responded that the
government was prepared to act but only within the constraints of the law.

The Parliament Deputy Dr. Shahkar proposed a compromise that he felt would obviate
the government’s concern for legal proprieties. Dr. Shahkar suggested that ‘Alam’s decree be
amended to include the following formulation:

> The formation of sects which, under the guise of religion, spread disorder, and
> which have adopted the name of Baha’ism in order to implement political objectives
> is proscribed, inasmuch as their existence is illegal and the cause of the dissolution
> of order and security; and since they contradict the true religion of Islam.

Although this language was not retained in the final version of the decree, which simply
restated the position of Twelver Shi’ism as the official state religion, this formula for
dismissing the Baha’i community as a political movement rather than as a faith was one to
which the Islamic Republic’s authorities would later return.

The decree ultimately issued by Minister of the Interior ‘Alam empowered local
authorities to “take measures to dissolve those social centers which are causing religious and
secular sedition and are the source of attacks against security and order.” However, in a firm
rebuff to the clergy and their supporters in the Parliament, ‘Alam’s decree also underlined
that taking such measures was the sole responsibility of government officials and instructed

157 For the text of the bill, see Davani, Khatirat va Mubarizat Hujjatu’l-Islam Falsafi, p. 207, citing Kayhan, no. 3575,
20/2/1334 (May 11, 1955). Safa’i, who had introduced the bill at the request of Burujirdi, subsequently
continued to urge the implementation of point no. 4, the purging of Baha’is from government positions. See
also Bakhshnamiyih Vazir Kishvar Raji‘ Bih Firqiyyih Baha’i [Circular from the Minister of Interior about the Baha’i
sect], published in Ittila‘at, no. 8677 on 26/2/1334 (May 17, 1955) warning that centers and societies that are
anti-religion would be dissolved, but that attempts to disrupt order on the pretext of fighting the “straying
sects” would not be tolerated either. Ayatu’llah Burujirdi was dismayed with the governmental authorities when
this proposal met with opposition and delays. See Davani, Khatirat va Mubarizat Hujjatu’l-Islam Falsafi, p. 210,
citing Davani, Zindiganiyih Za’im Buzurg ‘Alam Tasha’yu Ayatu’llah Burujirdi, p. 246: “After the fight against the
Baha’is proved unsuccessful, Ayatu’llah Burujirdi’s relationship with the government, the Shah and his court
became cold, and despair and distrust settled in [the Ayatu’llah’s] mind. The Shah and the government did not
care for Ayatu’llah Burujirdi’s requests and with sarcastic and derogatory remarks, caused much worry and
tribulation for him in the last years of his life.”

local governors “to take measures” against anyone provoking unrest “under the guise…of
struggling against deceiving sects.”158

Throughout the 1950s the clergy consistently spearheaded the repression of the Baha’i
community. Their efforts, however, were ultimately checked by government ministers, who,
although sympathetic to the popular anti-Baha’i sentiment, feared that anti-Baha’i violence
would spin out of control and attract international criticism. Once clerical rule was
established through the Islamic Revolution, the clergy was free to revisit without interference
the objectives it had failed to attain in the 1950s. Most of Safa’i’s proposals were ultimately
implemented by the new Islamic Republic, although they were now couched in the language
suggested by Dr. Shahkar. As Falsafi observed in his memoirs:

> Although the sermons of Ramadan 1334 [1955] dealt a blow against the Baha’is,
> what really destroyed the Baha’i community was the Islamic Revolution.159

The Hujjatiyyih
To appease and placate the mullas, the Shah sacrificed an innocent religious minority, when
in reality, every Iranian, young and old, knew that the Baha’is had no opposition to the
parliamentary government and were not enemies of the state.

After that, once more in order to indulge the mullas, SAVAK created the Hujjatiyyih
Mahdaviyyah Charitable Society for combating Baha’is. [The Hujjatiyyih…was a
fundamentalist Islamic organization.160 The organization’s name refers to Hujjat, a title of the
Hidden Imam Mahdi, awaited by Shi‘i Muslims, as a sign of opposition to the Baha’is who
believed the Bab was the Hidden Imam. Hujjatiyyih is said to be affiliated with and at times
considered synonymous with the Anjuman Tablighat Islami [Islamic Propaganda Society].161
The organization was founded by a clerical student named Shaykh Mahmud Zikrzadih
Tavalla’i, also known as Halabi, who is reported to have been a close friend of Khomeini.162
Sometimes termed the Anjuman Zidd Baha’iyat [anti-Baha’i society], the principal aim of the
Hujjatiyyih was to combat the Baha’i faith, and it devoted much of its energies to training
cadres in the “scientific defense” of Shi‘i Islam in the face of the Baha’i theological

158 The final draft read: “In keeping with Articles 20 and 21 of the Constitution, anti-religious publications and

the formation of societies and associations provoking religious and secular sedition and disorder are prohibited
throughout the country. Therefore, in implementing the principles of the Constitution you shall take measures
to dissolve those social centers which are causing religious and secular sedition and are the source of attack
against security and order. Henceforth, you will take steps in all seriousness to implement this important duty
with which you are entrusted in conformity with the Constitution and stop any kind of demonstrations or acts
on the part of this type of groups, and which acts are prohibited by law. At the same time, since taking steps in
these matters and implementing these laws is the task of government officials, and since the intervention of
individuals or groups having no responsibility will cause disorder and insecurity, therefore, it is to be
remembered that you are fully empowered to take measures against any person who provokes the people to act
against the security of the country, under the guise and in the capacity of struggling against deceiving sects, or
[any person] who himself commits acts which produce the smallest tremor against public order and security,
according to those provisions of the criminal code which anticipate such crimes.”

challenge.163 The organization attracted the support of such key religious leaders as
Ayatu’llah Burujirdi, Hujjatu’l-Islam Falsafi, Ayatu’llah Mara’shi Najafi, Ayatu’llah Milani,
Siyyid Abdu’llah Shirazi, and Ayatu’llah Baha’id-Din Mahallati.164 Other alleged members of
the Hujjatiyyih who obtained powerful positions after the 1979 revolution were Supreme
Leader Siyyid ‘Ali Khamenei, Foreign Minister ‘Ali-Akbar Vilayati, and the Minister of
Education and President Mohammad-‘Ali Raja’i.]165

This Society had many branches throughout Iran under SAVAK’s supervision,166 and
was engaged in religious activities, in intelligence gathering and propaganda methods, thus
causing uproar and unrest among religious minorities, particularly among the Baha’is.
Although the Hujjatiyyih Society was undoubtedly founded with the Shah’s collaboration,
gradually, and unanticipated by its founders, it became a recruiting ground for the “Islamic
Coalition Societies” and the Mujahidin Khalq organization [an organization that came to
oppose the Shah and led to his downfall].167

166 After the Islamic Revolution, a number of SAVAK’s secret documents were discovered. Mujadih newspaper,

in its June 9, 1980 issue, printed a facsimile of a document related to the year 1350 [1971], which is illuminating:
“Regarding Anjuman Tablighat Islami [Society for the Promotion of Islam]. The supervisor of Anjuman Islami
in the central office [Tehran] has requested SAVAK to provide necessary aid in combating Baha’is scientifically
and intellectually. In sharing this request of the Anjuman Islami with your contacts among known elements in
the region, kindly emphasize that their activities should not cause provocation or interference. In simpler terms,
while maintaining public order, Anjuman Tablighat Islami is permitted to use SAVAK’s assistance to combat
the Baha’is.” The chief of SAVAK’s Third Department signed this document. Also, Subh Azadigan newspaper,
in its Bahman 1360 [February 1982] issue, in an article under the title “A Glance at the Anjuman Hujjatiyyih,”
described at length the deep relationship between SAVAK and Anjuman Hujjatiyyih. For a more detailed
discussion of the relationship between SAVAK and Anjuman Hujjatiyyih, see Hizb Qa’idin Zaman [‘The Party of
Founders of Time’] (a name for the Anjuman Hujjatiyyih)], by ‘Amadu’d-Din Baghi. (BC)
167 See Moin, Life of the Ayatollah; 1999, p. 66, asserting that the Shah “not only tolerated the activities of

[Hujjatiyyih founder] Sheikh Mahmud Halabi and his fellow anti-Baha’i clergymen, but allowed the clergy’s
fight against the Baha’is to be aired from the government-controlled media. In an unprecedented move in 1955,
Tehran Radio broadcast a series of anti-Baha’i sermons by Mohammad Taqi Falsafi, Iran’s leading preacher.”
