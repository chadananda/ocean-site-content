     Nietzsche and the Bahá’í Writings:

A First Look

Ian Kluge

1\. Introduction

The purpose of this paper is to identify and evaluate
correlations between the Bahá’í Writings and the philosophy of
Friedrich Nietzsche. Shoghi Effendi, the Guardian of the Bahá’í
Faith, calls on Bahá’ís “to investigate and analyse the principles
of the Faith and to correlate them with the modern aspects of
philosophy and science.” He also says

> The Cause needs more Bahá’í scholars, people who not
> only are devoted to it and believe in it and are anxious
> to tell others about it, but also who have a deep grasp of
> the Teachings and their significance, and who can
> correlate its beliefs with the current thoughts and
> problems of the people of the world.

The Guardian adds,

> If the Bahá’ís want to be really effective in teaching the
> Cause they need to be much better informed and able to
> discuss intelligently, intellectually, the present condition
> of the world and its problems. We need Bahá’í scholars,
112                                             Lights of Irfán vol. 17

> not only people far, far more deeply aware of what our
> teachings really are, but also well-read and well-educated
> people, capable of correlating our teachings to the
> current thoughts of the leaders of society.

It is worth noting that the Guardian associates effective
Bahá’í teaching with the ability to “correlate” current issues in
society with the Bahá’í Teachings. Given the enormous influence
of Nietzsche’s thought and especially vis-à-vis the “new
atheism,” finding correlations and correspondences with the
Writings is an effective way of introducing the Writings to new
audiences. The Universal House of Justice echoes the
Guardian’s guideline.

> Shoghi Effendi has for years urged the Bahá’ís (who
> asked his advice, and in general also) to study history,
> economics, sociology, etc., in order to be au courant
> with all the progressive movements and thoughts being
> put forth today, and so that they could correlate these to
> the Bahá’í teachings.

In our understanding, the guidance of the Guardian and the
Universal House of Justice, to “correlate” means to identify
connections between different things. It can also refer to
finding correspondences and various degrees of similarity.
Finding correspondences or similarities is useful in dialoguing
with other beliefs.

While correlations will be our primary focus, we shall, of
course, identify and discuss major differences between the
Writings and Nietzsche in order to forestall over-identification
of the two. After all, the Writings come from Bahá’u’lláh, Who
is the Manifestation of God for this age, and, therefore, set the
standard for the truth by which to evaluate Nietzsche’s work.
This difference remains no matter how many correlations we
find between the Writings and Nietzsche. Among the most
important stumbling blocks contradictions and problems are
the master-slave morality, the transvaluation of values, and the

Nietzsche and the Bahá’í Writings                             113

often nasty manner of expression and demeaning tone of
Nietzsche’s writings. None of these disagreements can be swept
away and they will always stand as impediments to an over-
identification of the Writings and Nietzsche. However, as we
shall explain below, there are different ways of understanding
or interpreting these conflicts and how they relate to the
correlations.

One of the perennial questions in Nietzsche studies is, ‘How
can we evaluate and interpret what Nietzsche says?’ How can we
know, as Robert C Solomon and Kathleen M Higgins put it,
“what “Nietzsche really said”? Reading him presents a knot of
intertwined challenges that are not encountered to nearly the
same degree with most other philosophers. The major sources of
this problem are, in our view, three-fold. First, as we shall see
throughout this paper, are Nietzsche’s intellectual self-
contradictions, as, for example, the existence or non-existence of
a metaphysical substratum to reality. Furthermore, sometimes
the subtext undermines or flatly contradicts the apparent
meaning of the text. Second, the foregoing problem is
exacerbated by Nietzsche’s highly rhetorical and metaphorical
style which makes interpretation difficult and easily leads to
conflicting views. In addition, Nietzsche’s use of exaggeration
and bombast which makes it difficult to identify his ‘real’
position because of the resulting ambiguity. Third, he writes in
a mixture of styles and genres, i.e. he does not consistently
present his arguments by step-by-step inferences from premises
to conclusions. Styles and genre can include serious extended
discussions; shorter ‘notebook’ entries that are often modified
or contradicted by later entries; clever aphorisms, provocations,
insults, and ad hominem attacks; quasi-biblical works like Thus
Spake Zarathustra and philosophical myths such as the master-
slave morality.

Obviously, reading Nietzsche is a very complicated business.

What is central and essential? What is peripheral and accidental?
Is there a ‘litmus test’ for testing his ideas? One well-known
group of philosophers and scholars denies that such a test exists

114                                           Lights of Irfán vol. 17

and that we can find ‘meaning’ or coherent philosophy in
Nietzsche’s texts. Among these are Jacques Derrida, Sarah
Kofman, Karl Jaspers, Alexander Nehamas and Ruediger
Safranski. These scholars agree that there is no single ‘meaning’
in Nietzsche waiting to be discovered. Nietzsche’s texts are
essentially, an on-going process of discovery in which ideas are
suggested and then explored in different contexts and with
different issues. Often, they are varied and undermined to lead
us to new ideas. Of course, other philosophers and scholars
disagree, asserting that to one extent or another, and varying
from subject to subject, Nietzsche does, in fact, have a positive
philosophy to promulgate. Notable among these are Walter
Kaufmann, with his foundational, Nietzsche: Philosopher,
Psychologist, Antichrist; Robert C Solomon and Kathleen M
Higgins, whose book title sums up their position, What
Nietzsche Really Said; John Richardson who wrote Nietzsche’s
System; and Arthur C. Danto whose Nietzsche as Philosopher is
an early but enduring text. As we can see, the range of
Nietzsche interpretation is considerable.

Our study of the Bahá’í Writings and Nietzsche is based on
Walter Kaufmann’s Nietzsche: Philosopher, Psychologist,
Antichrist (1950). We do so for three main reasons. First, this is
the book that re-introduced Nietzsche to the English-speaking
world by studying him as a philosopher with a coherent
foundational idea applied to a large number of issues. Second,
Kaufmann’s work has withstood almost seventy years of debate
and critique and still remains essential in contemporary
Nietzsche studies. Kaufmann’s approach to Nietzsche as a
serious philosopher with important ideas has left its indelible
mark on Nietzsche studies. Kaufmann’s key idea is that “the will
to power is the core of Nietzsche’s thought but inseparable
from his idea of sublimation.” Nietzsche’s concept of
“sublimation” entails the necessity for self-overcoming to which
Nietzsche returns so frequently. In his book, Kaufmann
explores the various applications of Nietzsche’s central insight.
Sixty years later, the Blackwell Dictionary of Western

Nietzsche and the Bahá’í Writings                             115

Philosophy (2009) shows the endurance and pervasive influence
of Kaufmann’s belief, stating that “the will to power is
characterized by self-overcoming and is life-affirming.” Third,
using the will to power and its concomitant concepts of
sublimation and self-overcoming allows Kaufmann to include
almost all of Nietzsche’s ideas into a reasonably coherent whole.
In our view, his book provides unity or at least more unity than
other interpretations.

Are the Bahá’í Writings and Nietzsche compatible in regards
to their final end, goal or ultimate purpose?’ There is no simple
answer to this question. Shoghi Effendi says that “the supreme
and distinguishing function of His Revelation, which is none
other than the calling into being of a new race of men.”
Certainly Nietzsche’s work can agree with this. A “new race of
men” is Zarathustra’s goal, and his means, i.e. sublimation and
self-overcoming correspond—up to a point—with the Writings.
However, whether or not Nietzsche can endorse the concept of
spiritual development, depends very much on if we accept
Nietzsche’s atheism at face value. Our interpretation does not
for reasons to be seen below.

The major, unbridgeable difference vis-à-vis ultimate goals
appears in the Bahá’í goal of establishing a unified, federal
world commonwealth united by “one common faith.” In other
words, the current world-order needs to be replaced and the
means to this end is the transformation or increased
spiritualization of human character and the resulting
establishment of new institutions. This contrasts with
“Nietzsche’s lack of a political philosophy.” Certainly, he had
political opinions but opinions by themselves do not necessarily
make a coherent political philosophy. Even his support for rule
by a neo-aristocracy does not deal with the issues a genuine
political philosophy must deal with—power and power transfers,
hierarchies of responsibility, law and so on—thereby leaving his
political thought unformed and largely a matter of speculation.
In other words, insofar as Nietzsche has a coherent vision of an
institutional order, it is completely incompatible with the Bahá’í

116                                             Lights of Irfán vol. 17

goal of a new world order for all of humankind. This topic will
be discussed in more detail below.

As so often with Nietzsche, we require a word about Nazism.

The idea that Nietzsche was a precursor or proto-Nazi has few
if any supporters in modern Nietzsche scholarship. Tracy B
Strong in The Cambridge Companion to Nietzsche states,
“perhaps no opinion in Nietzsche scholarship is more widely
accepted than that the Nazis were wrong and/or ignorant in
their appropriation of Nietzsche.” Logically, just because the
Nazis thought they understood Nietzsche and (mis)used him,
does not mean Nietzsche himself was truly a Nazi or proto-
Nazi. A parallel error would be to (mis)use Christ’s statement
“Think not that I am come to send peace on earth: I came not to
send peace, but a sword” to ‘prove’ that He was a warmonger.
The Oxford Companion to Philosophy says Nietzsche has
received “considerable attention in the English-speaking world
as the shadow cast by the travesty of his appropriation by the
Nazis and Fascists has receded.” The Concise Routledge
Encyclopedia of Philosophy amplifies this point, stating that
Nietzsche

> gives a large role to the will to power and he proposes to
> replace the values he attacks with new values and a new
> idea of the human person (the Uebermensch meaning
> ‘overhuman’ or ‘superhuman’). Although Nazi
> theoreticians attempted to associate these ideas with
> their own cause, responsible interpreters agree that
> Nietzsche despised and unambiguously rejected both
> German nationalism and anti-Semitism.

This last point deserves commentary. Extreme German
nationalism, imperialism and anti-semitism are three signature
doctrines of Nazi theory and rejection of them is absolutely
incompatible with being a Nazi or even proto-Nazi. Further
evidence for this comes from Nietzsche’s advocacy of
cosmopolitanism and interracial intermarriage, and, as we shall
see below, his rejection of party politics, socialism and mass

Nietzsche and the Bahá’í Writings                             117

movements of any kind because they destroy individual
independence. The idea that Nietzsche (who died in 1900) was a
pre-Nazi or proto-Nazi begins with his sister Elizabeth who was
also the literary executor of his work. Unlike Nietzsche, she was
a staunch German nationalist and imperialist who funded copies
of Thus Spake Zarathustra for German soldiers heading to the
front in 1914. She was also a fanatic anti-semite married to a
prominent anti-semite, which is why Nietzsche refused to attend
her wedding. She was enthralled with National Socialism and
Hitler and encouraged the belief that Nietzsche would have
been a follower of the ‘new superman.’ It is difficult to
suppress a smile imagining Nietzsche as a follower of anyone.

As Solomon and Higgins note, it makes no sense to blame
any thinker for the abuse of his ideas by others after his death.
Among other things, that is a dangerous and infeasible practice
that would hold all authors responsible for the misapplication
of their ideas. For example, we could blame Darwin for
significant portions of Nazi ideology vis-à-vis the survival of
the fittest and its applications to individuals and societies. The
term ‘superman’ may have come from Nietzsche but the concept
of the ‘fittest’ animal dominating the others has a distinctly
Darwinian ring. In fact, Richard Weikart’s Hitler's Ethic: The
Nazi Pursuit of Evolutionary Progress relates Nazism to
Darwin. In the case of Nietzsche and Darwin, the Nazis misused
other people’s ideas but this tells us more about the Nazis than
it does about these two thinkers. We do not believe that it is
fair to taint the work of an author because others mishandled
his or her ideas.

Nonetheless, the fact remains that even without the Nazis, a
number of Nietzsche’s ideas that can be read as advocating rule
by and for the violent. His theory of master-slave morality and
the transvaluation of values are clearly of this kind. However,
three points should give us pause before reacting against passing
judgment on his work as a whole. First, we must not throw out
the baby with the bathwater: it is hard to see why our antipathy
to some of his ideas should prejudice us against his other ideas.

118                                           Lights of Irfán vol. 17

Second, we should recognize that Nietzsche was not always a
consistent thinker and these parts of his philosophy are
inconsistencies in his thought at least from vis-à-vis the “core,”
i.e. the will to power, sublimation and self-overcoming. Third,
because they are not compatible with the “core” of Nietzsche’s
thought, these inconsistencies cannot logically undermine those
parts that are compatible. They do not work from the same
premise, i.e. the “core.”

Finally, as a Bahá’í, I am convinced that as a result of
Bahá’u’lláh’s mysterious influence, Nietzsche was one of those
individuals who felt—albeit unconsciously or “through a glass
darkly”—the necessity of transforming ourselves to prepare for
the coming end of European civilization and a new world.
Shoghi Effendi refers to “those hidden and transforming
influences which, from the source of Bahá’u’lláh's mystic
strength, continue to flow with ever-increasing vitality into the
heart of this troubled world.” This, of course, is a matter of
personal faith, but even for those who do not share my belief,
the fact that there are significant correlations between the
widely separated Bahá’í Writings from the Middle East and the
European bourgeois Nietzsche is, at the very least, of interest in
the history of ideas.

2\. The Common Foundation Between the Bahá’í
Writings and Nietzsche

First appearances notwithstanding, there are at least three
major general foundational elements which the Bahá’í Writings
and Nietzsche share: (1) the radical critique of modern society as
suffering from irreversible social, intellectual, ethical and
spiritual degeneration; (2) the absolute necessity for the
establishment of a new kind of society and a re-constitution of
humankind, and (3) at the most fundamental level, the
Aristotelian substratum of their thought.

Nietzsche and the Bahá’í Writings                                 119

2\.1. The World in Decline

Both Bahá’u’lláh and Nietzsche viewed the modern world as
being in a degenerating condition, marked by “selfish disorders,
intellectual maladies, spiritual sicknesses, imperfections and
vices.” Not surprisingly, such conditions lead to mass despair,
i.e. an overwhelming conviction of the loss of all values, the
loss of all hope for the future and the loss of all confidence in
ourselves or anything else, including God. Bahá’u’lláh writes,
“The winds of despair are, alas, blowing from every direction,”
and,

> The world is in travail, and its agitation waxeth day by
> day. Its face is turned towards waywardness and
> unbelief. Such shall be its plight, that to disclose it now
> would not be meet and seemly. Its perversity will long
> continue.

Shoghi Effendi, the Guardian of the Bahá’í Faith, provides
the most comprehensive description of the decaying world order
of our time.

> No wonder, therefore, that when, as a result of human
> perversity, the light of religion is quenched in men’s
> hearts, and the divinely appointed Robe, designed to
> adorn the human temple, is deliberately discarded, a
> deplorable decline in the fortunes of humanity
> immediately sets in, bringing in its wake all the evils
> which a wayward soul is capable of revealing. The
> perversion of human nature, the degradation of human
> conduct, the corruption and dissolution of human
> institutions,    reveal     themselves,    under    such
> circumstances, in their worst and most revolting aspects.
> Human character is debased, confidence is shaken, the
> nerves of discipline are relaxed, the voice of human
> conscience is stilled, the sense of decency and shame is
> obscured, conceptions of duty, of solidarity, of
120                                             Lights of Irfán vol. 17

> reciprocity and loyalty are distorted, and the very feeling
> of peacefulness, of joy and of hope is gradually
> extinguished.

The ultimate cause of this universal decay and loss of
direction is the failure of spirituality and religion in the lives
modern men and women. The first sign of this inner collapse is
the rejection of God’s Manifestation for this age, the denial of
the “divine physician” Whose task is to renew and revitalize
humankind and to help it advance towards its next stage of its
psycho-spiritual and social evolution. Another sign of this
“perversity” is the inability of humans to recognize their
desperate and spiritually impoverished condition. As Bahá’u’lláh
says, “The Hour hath come upon them, while they are disporting
themselves. They have been seized by their forelock, and yet
know it not.” The third sign is inability to understand that

> material progress alone does not tend to uplift man. On
> the contrary, the more he becomes immersed in material
> progress, the more does his spirituality become
> obscured.

We cannot find materialist solutions to spiritual problems.

This impossible quest only increases despair—and fuels still more
desperate efforts to fill the ‘hole in the soul’ with more ‘stuff.’
Similarly, Nietzsche realizes that the “Ultimate Man” cannot
find happiness in the quest for more psycho-spiritual comfort
because the only way to true well-being is the quest for self—
overcoming. It is important to note that for both the Bahá’í
Writings and Nietzsche, the origin of the modern crisis is not
technological, scientific or political but rather spiritual. In The
Gay Science, Nietzsche writes that Europe faces

> [t]he peasant rebellion of the spirit—We Europeans
> confront a world of tremendous ruins ... The church is
> this city of destruction: We see ... Christianity shaken to
> its lowest foundations; the faith in ... God has collapsed.

Nietzsche identifies nihilism with destruction of values and
purpose brought on by the end of the Christian church and
Christianity itself. The collapse of religion and spirituality leads
to what Nietzsche calls “European nihilism.” In The Will to
Power, he defines nihilism:

> Nihilism as a psychological state will have to be reached,
> first, when we have sought a “meaning” in all events that
> is not there: so the seeker eventually becomes
> discouraged. Nihilism, then, is the recognition of the
> long waste of strength, the agony of the “in vain,”
> insecurity, the lack of any opportunity to recover and to
> regain composure—being ashamed in front of oneself, as
> if one had deceived oneself all too long.

In words reminiscent of the opening of The Communist
Manifesto, he announces, “Nihilism stands at the door: whence
comes this uncanniest of all guests?” This “guest” is
characterized by

> Skepticism regarding morality ... Buddhistic, yearning
> for Nothing ... the air of mediocrity, wretchedness,
> dishonesty,    etc.    Nationalism,    Anarchism,  etc.
> Punishment. The redeeming class and human being are
> lacking—the justifiers—He adds that moral skepticism is
> decisive because it leads to nihilism.

Noteworthy among these deficiencies is the lack of a
“redeeming class and human being” i.e. an inspirational figure
who can re-invigorate and mobilize mankind’s flagging energies.
None of these deficiencies can be cured by material possessions
comfort or progress. Providing that required spiritual remedy is
the major aim of Nietzsche’s philosophy, as seen in
Zarathustra’s valiant efforts to regenerate and re-energize the
“Ultimate Men,” i.e. the comfort-loving denizens of the valley.
In vain, he offers to cure them of their self-contented and
materialistic sloth by inner, personal or spiritual transformation

122                                            Lights of Irfán vol. 17

won through painful self-overcoming. This is a significant part
of the unavoidable cure for the illnesses of modernity that
Bahá’u’lláh offers by “calling into being of a new race of men.”
Of course, in the Bahá’í context this self-overcoming requires
recognition of God whereas in Nietzsche, this is, as will be
shown below, a matter of interpretation.

For Nietzsche, nihilism has two aspects, a “passive nihilism”
and an “active nihilism.” “Passive” nihilism is a sign of
decreased power, despair, “the weary nihilism that no longer
attacks.” By contrast “active” nihilism is a sign of increased
power and is a “violent force of destruction,” i.e. a nihilism that
clears away all the traditional beliefs and ideas—all the
thoughtless and comforting imitations—that prevent us from
actualizing our full potentials as conscious beings. “Active”
nihilism corresponds to the Bahá’í concept of destroying not the
world but rather of “[T]ear[ing] aside the veils that have
grievously blinded your vision and ... scatter the idols of vain
imitation.” In the words of Bahá’u’lláh, “None have believed in
Him except them who ... have shattered the idols of their vain
imaginings and corrupt desires and entered the city of certitude.
In both the Bahá’í Writings and Nietzsche we must choose to
make a radical break with the past. It is important to notice the
strong language used in the Writings—tearing, scattering
shattering—to show that spiritual evolution requires great
energy and is not always a comfortable process. Nietzsche, of
course, uses similar language in this regard.

2\.2. The Need for Revolutionary Change

Note: In order to frame the following discussion, it is
imperative to point out that the ultimate aim of the Bahá’í
dispensation is the establishment of a new world order, i.e. the
unification of humankind in a world-wide federal state united
by “one common faith” in which the “spiritual susceptibilities”
of humankind are more awake than they are now. Nietzsche,
however, has no clear ultimate goal in mind—although some

have inferred such—as we shall discuss below. Therefore, the
correspondences between the Writings and Nietzsche are
similarities regarding means in contrast to differences regarding
the ultimate ends. It is also important to note that although
Bahá’u’lláh’s goal is revolutionary change in humankind, His
method is evolutionary, i.e. spiritual, psychological, social
development of our “spiritual susceptibilities which are
merciful and heavenly characteristics.”

In our view, Bahá’u’lláh does not see Himself as yet another
reformer whose purpose is to prolong the existence of the old
world order by a patchwork of ‘fixes.’ Rather, His goal is to
establish a new world order: “Soon will the present-day order be
rolled up, and a new one spread out in its stead.” He takes full
responsibility for and makes no secret of the momentous
changes destabilizing the world as a prelude to establishing a
new world order.

> The world’s equilibrium hath been upset through the
> vibrating influence of this most great, this new World
> Order. Mankind’s ordered life hath been revolutionized
> through the agency of this unique, this wondrous
> System—the like of which mortal eyes have never
> witnessed.

In The Tablets of Bahá’u’lláh, He describes the Manifestation as
“fully capable of revolutionizing the world through the power
of a single Word” and calls on humanity to

> [c]ast away that which ye possess, and, on the wings of
> detachment, soar beyond all created things. Thus biddeth
> you the Lord of creation, the movement of Whose Pen
> hath revolutionized the soul of mankind.

Here we see the radical—and spiritual—nature of this
Revelation, demanding nothing less than a radical break with the
past and a total commitment by divesting ourselves of whatever

124                                             Lights of Irfán vol. 17

attaches us to the old world. Bahá’u’lláh even draws attention to
the radical or even traumatic nature of His revelation.

> the whole creation was revolutionized and all that are in
> the heavens and all that are on earth were stirred to the
> depths. Through that Word the realities of all created
> things were shaken, were divided, separated, scattered,
> combined and reunited, disclosing entities of a new
> creation.

It must be remembered that the focal point of Bahá’u’lláh’s
revolution is spiritual. Unlike revolutionaries in the past, He
begins the process of revolution and transformation from
within, so that His new world order begins with “a new race of
men” who do not simply repeat the errors of the past. Of course
the primarily spiritual focus of His revelation does not preclude
the daily tasks of mitigating the suffering of individuals or
striving for justice in our society. However, these activities are
most valuable and reach their fullest potential in the framework
of serving the Bahá’í Cause.

One consequence of these tumultuous times is an inevitable
struggle with opposing forces. Shoghi Effendi writes,

> We have only to refer to the warnings uttered by
> ‘Abdu’l-Bahá in order to realize the extent and character
> of the forces that are destined to contest with God's holy
> Faith peoples, nations, adherents of divers faiths, will
> jointly and successively arise to shatter its unity, to sap
> its force, and to degrade its holy name. They will assail
> not only the spirit which it inculcates, but the
> administration which is the channel, the instrument, the
> embodiment of that spirit.

Shoghi Effendi also writes of

> the burden of the impending contest that must be
> waged, sooner or later ... between the rising institutions

> of Bahá’u’lláh's embryonic divinely appointed Order,
> and the exponents of obsolescent doctrines and the
> defenders, both secular and religious, of a corrupt and
> fast-declining society.

Shoghi Effendi even assigns responsibility for the start of the
inexorable conflict on the way to a new world order:

> Our adversaries in the East have initiated the struggle.
> Our future opponents in the West will, in their turn,
> arise and carry it a stage further. Ours is the duty, in
> anticipation of this inevitable contest, to uphold
> unequivocally and with undivided loyalty the integrity of
> our Faith.

Given human nature, revolution without contest and conflict
is not possible—but the key issue is by what means and towards
what end the contest is waged. In the case of the Bahá’í Faith,
this “agonistic engagement” is waged not by coups, political
opposition, subversion or extra-parliamentary movements but
by means of new ideas, revitalized values, good personal
examples, energized hope, and appeals to the spiritual elements
in human nature. The underlying principle is that by the power
of example these transformational activities will gradually
encourage people to turn their loyalties and activities away
from the old world order and turn towards Bahá’u’lláh’s
Revelation. It is only in this way—a shift of loyalties—that the
Bahá’í Faith can be said to be impact negatively on the old
world order. In other words, the Bahá’í Faith will not actively
work to weaken or bring down the old world order but rather
emphasizes spiritual renewal and personal and social
transformation that will allow people to build a new world.

Nietzsche appears to suggest somewhat similar action.

Through his fictional character Zarathustra as an ideal example
and by means of attacking the West’s foundational concepts in
metaphysics, ethics, logic, religion, science and social
organization, he aims at clearing away the out-dated and/or un

126                                            Lights of Irfán vol. 17

supportable concepts that prop up the old world order and
hinder the arrival of the Superman. Zarathustra says,

> O my brothers, am I then cruel? But I say: That which is
> falling should also be pushed!

> Everything of today—it is falling. It is decaying: who
> would support it? But I—want to push it too!

> ... I am a prologue to better players, O my brothers! ...

Follow my example!

And him you do not teach to fly, teach—to fall faster!

The essential message here—the dramatic flare and hyperbole
aside—converges with the Bahá’í Writings in rejecting reform
and desiring revolution and a future that is not merely a
repetition of the past in a different disguise. Their method is
similar—up to a point. The shift of loyalties suggested in the
Writings is dedicated to building a positive new order, but does
not mandate action against the old order as Zarathustra does by
encouraging us to push it down.

2\.3. The Rejection of Politics

Both the Bahá’í Writings and Nietzsche reject partisan
political activity as a viable way of changing the world. Shoghi
Effendi says,

> Bahá’ís should remember that we stand above politics.
> That that field does not interest us; that we attribute
> importance to things of the spirit, that we await
> salvation to come from the Faith that burns in our
> hearts.

Of course, non-participation in partisan politics does not
mean Bahá’ís should not engaged in positive works to help
individuals or striving for justice but we must be sure that

neither we nor the Faith are being co-opted for partisan
purposes. Moreover, non-participation in partisan politics does
not mean that the Bahá’í Writings do not have certain principles
vis-à-vis governance. They make it clear, among other things,
that free, open and democratic government is better for human
progress than autocratic government; that elected parliaments
are good—if conducted properly; and that undue centralization
is a source of ill. However, partisanship is to be avoided
because it is ‘partial’ by nature whereas the Bahá’í focus is on
the good of the whole. As ‘Abdu’l-Bahá says,

> universality is of God, Bahá’ís in every land are ready,
> nay anxious, to associate themselves by word and deed
> with any association of men which, after careful
> scrutiny, they feel satisfied is free from every tinge of
> partisanship and politics and is wholly devoted to the
> interests of all mankind.

In the words of Shoghi Effendi, “[t]he bonds which hold
together the body-politic are not sufficient to unify a nation—
or the world. They hold mankind back from its destiny as a
global commonwealth.

R. Kevin Hill notes that “Nietzsche rejects all the political
ideologies on offer, from left to right as delusions,
‘convictions’ with no foundation.” Politics as practiced in
Europe during his time no longer serve any useful purpose: “the
time for small politics is gone,” a point also emphasized in his
disparaging reference to “the wretched gabble of politics and
nationalism and nationalism” Indeed, his contempt for politics
is expressed even more strongly: he describes it as a
“prostitution of the spirit.” Nietzsche scholar Ted Sadler states,

> For Nietzsche as for Heraclitus, politics is one of the
> most overestimated things in the world, mainly because
> it caters for the instincts of the common,
> unphilosophical natures who are always in the majority.

Politics stands in opposition to the radically
128                                               Lights of Irfán vol. 17

> individualizing character of philosophy expressed in
> Heraclitus’ statement (Diels-Kranz: Fragment 246) ‘I searched
> out myself.’

Like Bahá’u’lláh, Nietzsche is no mere reformer; he has no
confidence in contemporary partisan politics or in political
revolutions to solve the problems of nihilism and societal decay.
Both insist that we must not confuse and conflate the desire to
make revolutionary changes in society by means of individual
transformation in goals and values, with the work of political
parties, programs and partisan conflicts. In fact, these two will
often work at cross purposes. If people are not inwardly
transformed, they will inevitably repeat the very behaviors the
revolution was supposed to eliminate.

Like Bahá’u’lláh, Nietzsche rejects the partisan politics but
most of his political principles not only contradict the Bahá’í
Writings but also contradict other aspects of Nietzsche’s
philosophy as we shall see below. Unlike the Writings, Nietzsche
despised democracy as “not only a deterioration, that is to say,
the depreciation of a human type, a mediocratizing and
lowering of values.” Instead, he appears to advocate what Mark
Warren calls a “neoaristocratic conservatism ... [that looks]
forward to a time when similar cultural aristocracies might be
established. Bruce Detwiler calls Nietzsche’s political views “the
politics of aristocratic radicalism” which establishes rule by the
most powerful and ruthless. It is not hard to find evidence for
such beliefs in Nietzsche who writes,

> Every heightening of the type “man” hitherto has been
> the work of an aristocratic society—and thus it will
> always be; a society which believes in a long ladder of
> rank order and value differences in men, which needs
> slavery in some sense ... To be sure, we must not yield to
> humanitarian self-deception ... Men whose nature was
> still natural, barbarians in every frightful sense of the
> word, men of prey ... such men threw themselves upon
> weaker, better-behaved, more peaceable races ... The

> distinguished caste in the beginning was always the
> barbarian caste; their superiority lay not primarily in
> their physical but in their psychic power; they were more
> whole human beings (which on every level also means
> “more whole as beasts).

Nietzsche approves of the aristocrats for their leadership
because they “heighten[ed] “the type of ‘man’ “ In other words,
the human race as a whole benefits by their rule. Even if
violence is only instrumental at the start of their ascent and
their real superiority lay in “their psychic power” the fact
remains that they seize and keep power by violence for such is
the nature of life itself. Nietzsche writes,

> Life is essential assimilation, injury, violation of the
> foreign and the weaker, suppression, hardness, the
> forcing of one’s own form upon something else,
> ingestion and—at least in its mildest form—exploitation
> ... life is simply will to power ... “Exploitation” is not a
> part of a vicious or imperfect or primitive society; it
> belongs to the nature of living things.

In other words, Nietzsche justifies the aristocrats as realists who
accept the conditions of natural life and take advantage of
them. This is simply incompatible with the Bahá’í vision of a
new world order.

For Nietzsche, the struggle for domination is based on the
universally present will to power which is ontologically integral
to life. Being ontologically integral to life, it cannot be removed
without eliminating life itself. Consequently, for Nietzsche
“exploitation” “suppression” or domination i.e. “the forcing of
one’s own form upon something else” does not necessarily mean
a society is “primitive” or “vicious” as most ethical systems
would assert. These are natural and necessary activities. In
Nietzsche’s view, the aristocrats ought to rule precisely because
they have attributes listed above and they accept the nature of

130                                             Lights of Irfán vol. 17

reality without any shame and/or guilt, and therefore the
aristocrat

> feels himself the value-determining; he does not need to
> be ratified; he judges that “which is harmful to me is
> harmful as such; he knows that he is the something which
> gives honor to objects; he creates values ... his morality
> is self-glorification.

In our view, Nietzsche’s ideas on the will to power in regards
to politics have at least two inherent problems which not only
conflict with his other teachings but also conflict with the
Bahá’í Writings. First, his neo-aristocratic views contradict his
doctrine of continuous self-overcoming. A ruling class without
interest in self-critique and self-evaluation, i.e. a ruling class
which sincerely experiences itself and whatever it does as “the
good” is unlikely to engage in self-overcoming since the
necessary ‘good’ has already been achieved. The problem is that
for Nietzsche the ethics of self-overcoming “distinguish[ ] the
moral from the nonmoral [person].” Furthermore, as Kaufmann
notes, “self-criticism, i.e. man’s critical reflection on his own
intentions and actions—is the core of morality.” The inescapable
conclusion is that Nietzsche’s aristocrats are inherently immoral
not by Christian standards but the standards set by Zarathustra
who is—supposedly—the prime embodiment of Nietzsche’s
ethics. The same conclusion follows from Bahá’í ethics in which
self-overcoming is also essential to creating “new race of men.”

2\.3.1 Loyalty to the Earth

The second problem concerns the relationship between
morality and nature, a subject on which Nietzsche is deeply
conflicted. On one hand, he justifies the cruelties of his
aristocracy by appealing to nature, thereby falling into the
Humean fallacy of confusing ‘what is’ with ‘what ought to be,’
i.e. of confusing ‘description’ with ‘prescription’ and ‘knowing
what is the case’ with ‘endorsing what is the case.’ Describing

and prescribing (endorsing, obligating) are not logically
equivalent. Just because Alexis always cooks supper at our
house does not mean that Alexis should always cook supper at
our house. Just because mother rabbits sometimes eat their
young in times of danger does not mean that we can justify
human mothers doing the same. In other words, Nietzsche wants
to base his ethics on nature, on what is ‘natural’ as part of his
philosophy of loyalty to the earth. Nietzsche admonishes us to

> remain true to the earth and do not believe those who
> speak to you of superterrestrial hopes! They are
> poisoners whether they know it or not ... To blaspheme
> the earth is now the dreadful offence, and to esteem the
> bowels of the Inscrutable more highly than the meaning
> of the earth.

There are two problems here. First, self-overcoming is not
part of the natural order of things; a crocodile is what it is and
does what it does and shows no sign of trying to be ‘better’ in
some way. This loyalty to earth also conflicts with the
‘transcendental impulse’ we see in his work. Second, it is not
necessarily true that belief in the existence of a
“superterrestrial” world devalues and degrades the earth and our
earthly existence. Why would any believer in God denigrate the
Creator’s work? That would, in effect, be an attack on the
Creator Himself. Nietzsche fails to recognize that there is an
essential difference between being excessively attached to the
Creator’s work and being attached to the Creator. Condemning
the undue attachment to nature, i.e. God’s work, condemns a
faulty response to nature but does not devalue creation itself.
Nietzsche’s claim that belief in a “superterrestrial” world is in
itself a devaluation of the natural world is contradicted by the
Bahá’í Writings: “How resplendent the luminaries of knowledge
that shine in an atom, and how vast the oceans of wisdom that
surge within a drop!” Furthermore, there is Bahá’u’lláh’s
condemnation of asceticism and monasticism: they impede the
full celebration of earthly life and the divine gifts it offers:

132                                             Lights of Irfán vol. 17

> Living in seclusion or practising asceticism is not
> acceptable in the presence of God. It behoveth them
> that are endued with insight and understanding to
> observe that which will cause joy and radiance.

It is worth noting that Bahá’u’lláh emphasises the “joy and
radiance” of earthly life just as Nietzsche does. Moreover, He
clearly condemns such practices as originating in “idle fancy”
and “superstition” and, thereby, unmasking them as distortions
of human existence. Moreover, since the Bahá’í view of human
life is a process view, i.e. a character-building journey from
earth to the endless spiritual evolution of the Abhá Kingdom,
there is no rationale for devaluing the necessary first step of
pilgrimage. Without the first step, the others are impossible;
indeed, in a process view past steps are implicitly included and
even raised to a higher level. Nietzsche’s reasoning on this
matter does not hold.

However, there is another, in effect, opposing line of
thought about nature in Nietzsche. Zarathustra’s demand for
self-overcoming i.e. self-transcending requires us to tame and
transform our natural, animal impulses into something higher.
That is why Nietzsche says,

> The spiritualization of sensuality is called love: it is a
> great triumph over Christianity. A further triumph is
> our spiritualization of enmity. It consists in profoundly
> grasping the value of having enemies: in brief, in acting
> and thinking in the reverse of the way in which one
> formerly acted and thought.

We must transform, or sublimate animal lust into love and
spiritualize our conflicts. As Kaufmann notes, Nietzsche “used
another word side by side with sublimation: Vergeisterung,
spiritualization.” We should not view our enemies in the natural
way and rise above our impulses to find value in our foes. We
must go beyond nature—as is already obvious in Nietzsche’s
advocacy of self-overcoming to be better humans, not better

animals. As ‘Abdu’l-Bahá says, “The Prophets come into the
world to guide and educate humanity so that the animal nature
of man may disappear and the divinity of his powers become
awakened.” It is also noteworthy that Nietzsche’s statement
about enemies converges with ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s admonition:

> Let them see no one as their enemy, or as wishing them
> ill, but think of all humankind as their friends; regarding
> the alien as an intimate, the stranger as a companion,
> staying free of prejudice, drawing no lines.

3\. Master and Slave Morality

The issue of Nietzsche’s “aristocratic radicalism” brings us to
one of the most challenging, controversial and thought-
provoking aspects of Nietzsche’s philosophy—master and slave
morality as presented in On the Genealogy of Morals and
Beyond Good and Evil. This is one of the places where the
Bahá’í Writings and Nietzsche can only be reconciled to a
limited degree.

In outline, Nietzsche’s theory is simple enough. There exist
two kinds of morality, i.e. on one hand, the morality of the
ruling aristocrats, nobility and masters, and, on the other hand,
the morality of the slaves i.e. the subservient classes of people.
Nietzsche’s description of the masters is provocative: they are
hard, proud, intolerant of weakness, self-confident, challenge-
seeking, war-like, active and energetic, strong, bluntly truthful
about themselves and the world, and focused on law and what is
right. In direct contrast, slave morality values the useful i.e. the
comfortable and advantageous over the right; it values
weakness, kindness and compassion, humility, patience, equality
of all things as well denigrating earthly life in favor of a
heavenly life after death.

According to Nietzsche, these two moralities clash—although
one of them, i.e. slave morality, is the victor in the modern
world. Nietzsche links this historical downfall with the rise of

134                                               Lights of Irfán vol. 17

the priestly class in Judaism and Christianity which he identifies
with slave morality. However, it is essential to remember that to
one degree or another, the struggle between the two kinds of
morality continues within us today.

Nietzsche’s views on this subject are summarised in the
following passage from On the Genealogy of Morals:

> All the world's efforts against the “aristocrats,” the
> “mighty,” the “masters,” the “holders of power,” are
> negligible by comparison with what has been
> accomplished against those classes by the Jews—the Jews,
> that priestly nation which eventually realized that the
> one method of effecting satisfaction on its enemies and
> tyrants was by means of a radical transvaluation of
> values, which was at the same time an act of the cleverest
> revenge. Yet the method was only appropriate to a
> nation of priests, to a nation of the most jealously
> nursed priestly revengefulness. It was the Jews who, in
> opposition to the aristocratic equation (good =
> aristocratic = beautiful = happy = loved by the gods),
> dared with a terrifying logic to suggest the contrary
> equation, and indeed to maintain with the teeth of the
> most profound hatred (the hatred of weakness) this
> contrary equation, namely, “the wretched are alone the
> good; the poor, the weak, the lowly, are alone the good;
> the suffering, the needy, the sick, the loathsome, are the
> only ones who are pious, the only ones who are blessed,
> for them alone is salvation—but you, on the other hand,
> you aristocrats, you men of power, you are to all
> eternity the evil, the horrible, the covetous, the insatiate,
> the godless; eternally also shall you be the unblessed, the
> cursed, the damned!”

Before proceeding, we hasten to add that this passage is not
an anti-Semitic outburst—Nietzsche openly despised anti-
semitism especially in his sister and brother-in-law; rather, it is
an observation of a historical turn of events, i.e. the Edict of

Thessalonica in 380 CE by which Christianity and its slave
morality became the only authorized religion in the Roman
Empire. This event marks the success of the slave revolt and the
“transvaluation of values.”

The Bahá’í Writings and Nietzsche’s master and slave
morality are incompatible for at least one reason: the Writings
identify the “slave morality” with the ethical teachings of the
Manifestations of God and the “master morality” with the
proud and corrupt rulers and leaders of the world to whom
Bahá’u’lláh wrote admonitory epistles. In other words, the
Bahá’í Writings favor what Nietzsche calls “slave morality”: the
morality of the weak, the oppressed, the humble, the
compassionate, and the long-suffering as well as the values of
dedication to God, unselfishness and service to others.
Conversely, the Manifestations have sought to overcome the
unself-critical, unreflective self-satisfaction of our animal
natures that marks the cruelty and ruthlessness of beasts—and
Nietzsche’s master class.

Unlike Nietzsche, the Manifestations understood the
superiority of the ‘slave’ morals insofar as they maintained the
ethics of self-overcoming which “distinguishes the moral
[person] from the nonmoral [person].” Kaufmann notes that
“self-criticism, i.e. man’s critical reflection on his own
intentions and actions—is the core of morality.” In contrast, of
master morality shows it to be painfully smug, self-satisfied and
arrogant even about inflicting violence and, therefore, highly
unlikely to lead to the kind of self-critical awareness required
for self-overcoming. Ironically, Nietzsche’s own standard of
self-overcoming means that the aristocracy fails Nietzsche’s test
for being moral. In sharp contrast, the slave morality with its
intense awareness of its own weakness and other deficiencies is
far more likely to be open to the process of self-overcoming
and, thereby, according to Nietzsche’s own standards, becomes
more fit to rule.

136                                          Lights of Irfán vol. 17

Once again, we face a division in Nietzsche’s philosophy. On
one hand we have the “master-and-slave” morality justified by a
ruthless vision of life:

> What is life?—Life—that is: continually shedding
> something that wants to die. Life—that is; being cruel
> and inexorable against everything about us that is
> growing old and weak—and not only about us. Life—that
> is, then: being without reverence for those who are
> dying, who are wretched, who are ancient? Constantly
> being a murderer?—And yet old Moses said: “Thou shalt
> not kill.”

The mocking tone of “old Moses”—far more derisive in German
than in English—makes clear his contempt for the attributes of
slaved morality. On the other hand we have Zarathustra, the
exemplar of what humankind should become, i.e. a bridge to the
Superman, who engages in constant self-overcoming, who
preaches to the “last men” in hopes of awakening the adventure
of self-overcoming, who is hard on himself and does not always
sing his own praises, who uses the power of words to attain his
goals, not violence and who has no real interest in dominating
others by force.

Walter Kaufmann tries to avoid this dilemma by suggesting
that Nietzsche “would like us to conform to neither [master nor
slave morality] and become autonomous, i.e. grow beyond
both. However, it is difficult to see how being “autonomous”
prevents us from having to make choices that either agree more
with the stark differences between master and slave morality
and their respective consequences. Moreover, it is also difficult
to see how one can—or would want to—grow beyond self-
overcoming (to what?) and compassion. As soon as we adopt
these in any way, we are forced to abandon the master morality.
In our view, there is a genuine conflict in Nietzsche’s thought
on this matter and there is no choice but to recognize one or the
other as being consistent with the whole body of Nietzsche’s
philosophy.

Can the Bahá’í Writings be brought into alignment with
Nietzsche’s master-slave-morality? In our view, no direct
agreements or convergences are evident. However, we find
some tenuous parallelism between certain ideas, i.e. we can find
ideas that are different in content but fulfill some of the same
functions. We might also think of mirror images in which one is
the reverse of the other. As we understand the Writings,
Nietzsche’s concept of ‘domination’ must be replaced by the
concept of ‘service,’ i.e. the ‘leaders’ or ‘aristocrats’ serve
humankind. They are ‘masters’ in the art of promoting spiritual
evolution. Thus, both the Writings and Nietzsche have a
concept of rank i.e. ways of distinguishing ourselves by special
attributes and/or actions but these work in antithetical ways.
One obvious difference is that for Nietzsche there is a
relationship of enmity and forceful, even violent domination
between the masters and slaves. In contrast, in the Bahá’í
Writings the ‘leaders’ neither rule nor dominate nor regard
others as foes and inferiors nor are they part of a permanent
class. They lead by force of good example and exemplary
behavior, by obedience to Bahá’u’lláh’s revelation, by constant
striving to develop their “spiritual susceptibilities” and in
service to others. Among Bahá’ís, the ‘masters’ themselves are
‘slaves’ insofar as they ultimately seek to serve God and not
themselves. It is, so to speak, a quest to be part of an
‘aristocracy of slaves’!

The Bahá’í Writings themselves encourage this sense of
spiritual competition to serve. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá says, “Happy the
soul that shall forget his own good, and like the chosen ones of
God, vie with his fellows in service to the good of all.”
Bahá’u’lláh says, “Vie ye with each other in the service of God.”
The Universal House of Justice tells us that Bahá’u’lláh
“encouraged a competitive spirit in its noblest form.” In short,
the Writings and the guidance from the Universal House of
Justice recognize the value of spiritual competition in service.

To the objection that this sounds too combative, we point
out that there is an agonistic aspect in the Writings as already

138                                             Lights of Irfán vol. 17

seen in Shoghi Effendi’s warnings about future “contests” with
opposition to the Faith. Furthermore, lower animal traits can be
transformed and transvalued into higher, more spiritual traits.
For example, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, reminds us that greed—an animal
trait—can become a prized spiritual characteristic.

> greed, which is to ask for something more, is a
> praiseworthy quality provided that it is used suitably. So
> if a man is greedy to acquire science and knowledge, or
> to become compassionate, generous and just, it is most
> praiseworthy.

The same principle underlies the use of military imagery in the
Writings. For example, in one of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s prayers we
read:

> These souls are Thy heavenly army. Assist them and, with
> the cohorts of the Supreme Concourse, make them
> victorious, so that each one of them may become like
> unto a regiment and conquer these countries through the
> love of God and the illumination of divine teachings.

In another prayer he says,

> Confirm me in Thy service, assist me with the cohorts of
> Thy angels, make me victorious in the promotion of Thy
> Word and suffer me to speak out Thy wisdom amongst
> Thy creatures.

In the world-view presented in the Writings—and Thus Spake
Zarathustra—the many of the qualities of the ‘masters’ can be
spiritualized i.e. transformed and transvalued to achieve higher
goals than mere earthly dominion. They continue the never-
ending process of self-overcoming by being cruel and relentless
to themselves in defeating their stubborn weaknesses and self-
deceptions.

Unlike Nietzsche’s masters, his exemplary hero Zarathustra
could agree with much of what the Writings say on the issue of
service as well as with the following by ‘Abdu’l-Bahá:

> O people! Ye are the fruits of one tree and the leaves of
> one branch. At most it is this, that some souls are
> ignorant, they must be educated; some are sick, they
> must be healed; some are still of tender age, they must be
> helped to attain maturity, and the utmost kindness must
> be shown to them. This is the conduct of the people of
> Bahá.

At the beginning of his journey down the mountain,
Zarathustra, tells the old man in the forest, “I love mankind”
and answers the old man’s objections by saying, “I am bringing
mankind a gift.” His mission is to educate, to heal, to mature
and to show his insights with a sincere heart and kindness. In
effect, he comes down to serve in agreement with the words of
Bahá’u’lláh that “The people are ignorant, and they stand in
need of those who will expound the truth.” If there is an
‘aristocracy’ in the Bahá’í Writings, it is an ‘aristocracy’ of
service –certainly not an aristocracy of power, domination and
harshness.

To conclude: the Bahá’í Writings and Nietzsche are reversed
mirror images of each other in regards to ‘masters’ and slaves.’
Both embody the concepts of ‘rank,’ ‘contest’ and ‘leadership
but one does so in the service of self and the other in the service
of humankind and God. Furthermore, Nietzsche’s aristocrats
dominate by force and live in a state of enmity with others.
They are also part of a permanent class structure and are
centered on themselves as highest form of human existence.
Their actions are justified in and of themselves. This stands in
sharp contrast to the Bahá’í understanding of leadership in
terms of service to humankind with the purpose of helping all
develop their highest “spiritual susceptibilities” both as
individuals and as members of society. There is no permanent
ruling class.

4\. The Bahá’í Writings, Nietzsche and Aristotle

The pervasive presence of Aristotelian metaphysics and
ontology in both the Bahá’í Writings and Nietzsche identifies
another important area of agreement and convergence between
the two. Because of this common foundation, the correlations
between the Writings and Nietzsche are not serendipitous
coincidences but—for the most part—the outcome of working
with the same philosophical concepts in analyzing and
explaining reality. At this point it must be said that Bahá’u’lláh
and ‘Abdu’l-Bahá have affirmed the validity of certain
Aristotelian concepts—especially in metaphysics and ontology—
by using them extensively throughout the Bahá’í Writings.
Similarly, in the case of Nietzsche, numerous authors have
detected Aristotle’s influence, among them Kaufmann,
Richardson, Solomon, Hough, Silk and Stern, Emden and
Williams. Since Nietzsche was a trained philologist specializing
in Greek and Latin supports the belief that he was at least
passingly familiar with Aristotle’s major principles.

The Bahá’í Writings and Nietzsche use Aristotle’s ontology
of potentials to analyze, understand and explain reality. Of
course, this ontology implicitly includes all the major elements
of Aristotelian metaphysics. Let us see how. For Aristotle,
potentials are (a) the ability or power of a thing to initiate or
stop change in oneself or others or (b) the ability to change into
or be changed into something else or be acted upon. Moreover,
every single thing or kind of thing is identified and limited by
its particular combination of potentials. That is why we cannot
make a silk purse out of a sow’s ear. It lacks the potentials for
such a transformation. Furthermore, the essence of a thing is
the collection of potentials that distinguish a particular kind
and/or individual from other kinds and/or individuals.

Little reflection is needed to see that the ontology of
potentials also implies the concept of ‘actuality’ or what a thing
is at a specific moment as distinct from what it can/will be in
the future. This, in turn, implies the distinction between

appearance—what a thing is at any particular moment—and its
reality, i.e. its full albeit ‘bundle’ of potentials both actualized
and unactualized. Anything that has its own unique ‘bundle’ of
potentials is a ‘substance’ i.e. something that stands by itself
and is not an attribute of something else. “Silver” the Lone
Ranger’s horse, is a substance because he is not a quality of
some other thing. The ontology of potentials also implies the
existence of ‘force’ or ‘power’—or ‘will’ in Nietzsche’s
language—to actualize a potential, i.e. cause change within
oneself or in others. Finally, the ontology of potentials requires
that all things have a goal, a ‘telos’ i.e. a certain preferred
direction or goal towards which things develop. Maple trees
never grow into lobsters. The potentials a thing has limit what it
can become, i.e. set it towards certain goals. Nietzsche, of
course, claims to have rejected these concepts as part of a now
irrelevant philosophical past, but numerous passages show that
in fact, he consistently made use of them either explicitly or
implicitly.

Aristotle’s ontology of potentials—including teleology—is
most dramatically illustrated in Zarathustra’s command,
“Become what you are!” This command only makes sense on the
assumption that we have an essence made up of certain
potentials unique to us as members of the human race and as
human individuals. It requires the distinction between
appearance, i.e. what we are now, and reality, i.e. our
unactualized potentials. Furthermore, this command requires
free will in order to struggle for a goal within our range of
potentials. In addition, this command only makes sense if we
have an essence that is stable, i.e. is continuous enough to be
given instructions that can be meaningfully followed over a
period of time, i.e. has continuity through change. In short, it
must have identity or ‘being’ or be a ‘substance.’ Thus it
appears that Nietzsche did, albeit implicitly—or perhaps
inadvertently—accept the concepts of potential, essence, goals,
free will, cause-and-effect, the distinction between appearance
and reality and substance since without them, a significant

142                                             Lights of Irfán vol. 17

portion of his philosophy of self-overcoming would lose its
logical and ontological foundations.

Another appeal to essences—and implicit to potentials and
the ontology of potentials—is what Nietzsche says at the end of
The Will to Power. He tacitly assumes the reality of essences—
and by implication potentials—by saying, “This world is the will
to power—and nothing besides! And you yourselves are also this
will to power and nothing besides! This statement plainly asserts
that in their essential natures, the world, all beings in it and all
human beings are the will to power. However, the matter does
not end here. In Beyond Good and Evil, Nietzsche writes,

> The world seen from within, the world defined and
> designated according to its “intelligible character”—it
> would simply be “Will to Power,” and nothing else.

This claim identifies the ‘inner’ essence of the world and its
“intelligible character” as the will to power even though it does
not appear as the will to power. In other words, it establishes
the distinction between appearance and reality. The same
Aristotelian ontology of potentials and essence is present in the
following:

> The victorious concept of “force,” by means of which
> our physicists have created God and the world, still
> needs to be completed: an inner will must be ascribed to
> it, which I designate the “will to power,” i.e. an
> insatiable desire to manifest power, or as the
> employment and exercise of power as a creative drive,

Nietzsche’s objections to the concept of ‘essence’
notwithstanding, this is essentialism, i.e. the view that all things
have an inner nature which, in Nietzsche’s view is “will.”
Consequently, we can always look ‘though’ the outward
appearance of a thing and deduce the reality, the “intelligible
character” of a particular thing while observing the will to

power in one of its particular modes. We may see this will to
power in a stone or a pike or a baby but in each case the essence
operates under the same mandate, to ‘become what it is.’ In
light of the foregoing discussion, it is difficult to avoid the
conclusion that Nietzsche’s overt denial of concepts like
essence, free will, teleology and the ontology of potentials
cannot be taken at face value because he implicitly re-
introduces them in the course of his major teachings.

The Bahá’í Writings harmonize with those aspects of
Nietzsche that make use of the ontology of potentials, essence
and the appearance/reality distinction. The ontology of
potentials is one of the foundational philosophical ideas in the
Bahá’í Writings as seen in the following:

> Man is the microcosm; and the infinite universe, the
> macrocosm. The mysteries of the greater world, or
> macrocosm, are expressed or revealed in the lesser world,
> the microcosm. The tree, so to speak, is the greater
> world, and the seed in its relation to the tree is the lesser
> world. But the whole of the great tree is potentially
> latent and hidden in the little seed. When this seed is
> planted and cultivated, the tree is revealed. Likewise, the
> greater world, the macrocosm, is latent and miniatured
> in the lesser world, or microcosm, of man. This
> constitutes the universality or perfection of virtues
> potential in mankind.

In this passage, mankind’s relationship to the universe is
explained in terms of hidden potentials and actualization or
revealing of the hidden. There is the present actuality or
appearance and the future actuality after latent potentials have
been actualized. Bahá’u’lláh states,

> Consider, moreover, how the fruit, ere it is formed, lieth
> potentially within the tree. Were the tree to be cut into
> pieces, no sign nor any part of the fruit, however small,
> could be detected. When it appeareth, however, it
144                                             Lights of Irfán vol. 17

> manifesteth itself, as thou hast observed, in its
> wondrous beauty and glorious perfection.

Once again we observe the appearance/reality distinction: the
actual appearance is the tree but the tree’s reservoir of
potentials or essence remains hidden until actualized in the
fruit. Of course, the Writings apply these ideas to the role of
the Manifestations in human history:

> The holy Manifestations of God come into the world to
> dispel the darkness of the animal, or physical, nature of
> man, to purify him from his imperfections in order that
> his heavenly and spiritual nature may become quickened,
> his divine qualities awakened, his perfections visible, his
> potential powers revealed and all the virtues of the
> world of humanity latent within him may come to life.

From this it follows that the doctrine of progressive revelation
also fits into the ontology of potentials. As seen above,
humankind contains latent attributes or potentials and as these
are actualized under the guidance of various Manifestations,
humankind makes spiritual and material progress.

Nietzsche also agrees with the Writings insofar as we should
“become what [we] are”—indeed, one might well argue that
enabling us to do so is the whole point of Bahá’u’lláh’s
revelation. Unless we humans become what we really are, instead
of living hypocritically by professing one thing and doing
another, we hinder our growth personally and collectively. This
raises the question, ‘Who, really, are we?’ and to that, the Bahá’í
answer is clear:

> As for the spiritual perfections they are man's birthright
> and belong to him alone of all creation. Man is, in
> reality, a spiritual being, and only when he lives in the
> spirit is he truly happy. This spiritual longing and
> perception belongs to all men alike, and it is my firm

> conviction that the Western people possess great
> spiritual aspiration.

Because of our essentially spiritual nature, human beings
have a spiritual destiny or vocation in this world (and beyond)
and our true happiness is fulfilling this nature no matter how
hard this may be. How could we be happy if we are, so to speak,
living against ourselves by forgetting that our residence in
nature, while a necessary part of our development, is only
temporary? The task of being a Bahá’í is the task of becoming
our spiritual selves.

There is no question that the Bahá’í Writings see all things
endowed with an essence (as described by Aristotle as a reservoir
of potentials) and, therefore, connect with the implicit
recognition of essences in Nietzsche’s work. In The Kitab-i-Iqan
Bahá’u’lláh tells us that “the light of divine knowledge and
heavenly grace hath illumined and inspired the essence of all
created things, in such wise that in each and every thing [is] a
door of knowledge.” Here is a partial list of things which the
Writings identify as having an essence: God; the human soul;
humankind; justice; “all created things”; beauty; species of
living things; truth; religion; “this new age”; and the spirit.
Indeed, references to ‘essence’ are even more wide-spread once
we realize that such phrases as “inmost reality”; “the realities
of”; “reality of”; “inner reality”; and “inner realities”; also refer
to the essence of things.

It should be noted that the concept of ‘essence’ does not
deny the relational or—as we shall see below—the process nature
of things and bestow them with “an intrinsic non-relational
character.” ‘Abdu’l-Bahá states,

> For all beings are connected together like a chain; and
> reciprocal help, assistance and interaction belonging to
> the properties of things are the causes of the existence,
> development and growth of created beings.
146                                             Lights of Irfán vol. 17

All things, including their essences, are relational, i.e. they
exist as part of a complex of relations. However, this does not
preclude essences. The essence of a particular thing is made up
of a certain set of relations—and not a different set of relations.
In other words, the relations that make up a human being are
not the same relations as those that make up a horseshoe crab
with its blue blood. In short, there is no logical contradiction
between relationality and essence.

Aristotle’s ontology of potentials—and by extension the
Bahá’í Writings’ and Nietzsche’s—implicitly embodies other
Aristotelian concepts such as substance. For Aristotle, a
substance is a thing that exists independently of other things,
or, a thing that is not an attribute of something else and a thing
that continues through change, i.e. a continuant. For example, a
horse exists independently—it does not die if the farmer dies—
and it is not a quality that something else has nor is it a
different horse tomorrow than it is today. Some of its non-
essential attributes may have changed but a slight graying of the
mane or a thinner belly does not make it a different horse
because there is an observable—or filmable—continuity from
birth until today. We shall explain the false contradiction
between being and becoming below. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá uses this
definition of substance to prove the immortality of the soul:

> Some think that the body is the substance and exists by
> itself, and that the spirit is accidental and depends upon
> the substance of the body, although, on the contrary, the
> rational soul is the substance, and the body depends
> upon it. If the accident—that is to say, the body—be
> destroyed, the substance, the spirit, remains.

Because the soul is a ‘substance’ in the Aristotelian sense, it
exists independently of the body or, conversely, the body is an
accidental attribute of the soul and needs the soul to actually be
a body and live. Obviously, the soul-substance is a continuant
and because it is not an attribute of the body, can exist without
it.

Nietzsche’s views on ‘substance’ are ambiguous, i.e. overtly
denying the validity of this concept and covertly using it. He
writes,

> Insofar, however, as all metaphysics has had principally
> to do with sugarystance and freedom of will, one may
> designate it the science that treats of the fundamental
> errors of mankind—but does so as though they were
> fundamental truths.

His words notwithstanding, the problem is obvious: without the
Aristotelian concept of substance, Nietzsche’s philosophy
encounters fatal obstacles. For example, Nietzsche describes the
will to power as the essence of all things, manifesting in
everything in the phenomenal world—and, thereby, the will to
power that persists through all kinds and all changes is a
continuant, i.e. a ‘substance’ in the Aristotelian sense. Nor is
the will to power as such an attribute of anything else, nor does
it depend on anything else for its existence. Therefore, one of
Nietzsche’s key concepts is an example of what he explicitly
denies. The same argument can be applied to Zarathustra and
the Superman. Once again, we find that the implicit content of
his work is in full agreement with the Bahá’í Writings while his
explicit statements are not.

5\. Process Philosophy

Aristotle’s ontology of potentials solves the ancient
philosophical problem of the apparent conflict between ‘being’
and ‘becoming’ and, thereby creates one of the connecting
points between the Writings and Nietzsche who seems to deny
that the concept of ‘being’ has any validity: “Heraclitus will
always be right in this, that being is an empty fiction.” ‘Being’
refers to the continuity of a thing, to the retention of identity
according to Aristotle. In contrast ‘becoming’ refers to the
changes a thing undergoes, i.e. a process of actualizing its
potentials and changing from one state or condition to another.

148                                             Lights of Irfán vol. 17

Thus, Aristotle’s ontology of potential tells us that the
traditional absolute dualism between ‘being’ and ‘becoming’ is
false. Nothing is ever in just one condition or the other: a
sprouting sunflower seed actualizes its particular sunflower
potentials and, by doing so, is being or be-ing a sunflower seed.
Or, we could say a plant is being a sunflower by becoming more
of a sunflower as more of its various potentials are manifested.
In regards to Nietzsche, this means there is no basis to the
argument that Aristotle’s alleged philosophy of being is
intrinsically incompatible with Nietzsche’s philosophy of
becoming. In more general terms, process philosophies are not
necessarily irreconcilable with philosophies of being.

Both the Bahá’í Writings and Nietzsche are based on a
process metaphysics, i.e. a philosophy that is based on the
principle that reality is fundamentally constituted by change.
The Writings explicitly state:

> Know that nothing which exists remains in a state of
> repose—that is to say, all things are in motion.
> Everything is either growing or declining; all things are
> either coming from nonexistence into being, or going
> from existence into nonexistence ... This state of motion
> is said to be essential—that is, natural; it cannot be
> separated from beings because it is their essential
> requirement, as it is the essential requirement of fire to
> burn ... ?

> Thus it is established that this movement is necessary to
> existence, which is either growing or declining.

According to the Bahá’í Writings, motion, i.e. change, i.e.

the actualization of potentials is an essential attribute of all
existing things. Indeed, a dialectical process between the present
actual form of something and the potentials that are trying to
actualize and to develop new forms is always underway. In fact,
these dialectical ‘battles’ constitute all things as what they are.
The moment this process stops, a thing stops existing.

According to Kaufmann, in Nietzsche’s “dialectical monism”
“will to power ... is always at war with itself.” In humankind
this might appear as a dialectic between “reason and impulse” or
between the drive for self-overcoming and the fear of suffering.
Here, too, the Bahá’í Writings and Nietzsche are similar insofar
as Nietzsche sees an inner conflict as we have already seen in the
doctrine of self-overcoming. He rejects “being” which he
identifies with stasis. The “opposition and war” refers to this
inward struggle of self-overcoming.

> I retained some doubt in the case of Heraclitus in whose
> proximity I feel altogether warmer and better than
> anywhere else. The affirmation of passing away and
> destroying, which is the decisive feature of Dionysian
> philosophy; saying yes to opposition and war; becoming
> along with a radical repudiation of the very concept of
> being—all this is clearly more closely related to me than
> anything else ...

5\.1. Agreement on Teleology

Nietzsche’s overt denials of teleology notwithstanding,
teleology plays an essential role in his thought. Indeed, because
the teleological strain in Nietzsche’s philosophy is so clearly
evident, Nietzsche scholar R. Kevin Hill says that Nietzsche’s
work shows “in nature a teleological tendency towards the
production of higher human beings: artists, philosophers and
saints.” John Richardson adds,

> I take it to be evident from the expression itself that
> ‘will to power’ is a potency for something, a
> directedness towards an end ... Nietzsche, despite his
> repeated attacks on (what he calls) teleology really has
> such a theory himself: the beings or units in the world
> are crucially end-directed and to understand them
> properly is to grasp how they’re directed or aimed.
150                                             Lights of Irfán vol. 17

> Above all, it’s to grasp how they’re aimed at power, an
> end essential to them.

For his part, Nietzsche states:

> But all expansion, incorporation, growth means striving
> against something that resists; motion is essentially ties
> up with states of displeasure; that which is here the
> driving force must in any event desire something else ...
> For what do the trees in the jungle fight each other? For
> “happiness”—For power!

In his view, whatever we do is motivated—consciously or not—
by the purpose of increasing power. In Thus Spake Zarathustra,
we can see the implicit teleological influence at work when he
says:

> I teach you the Superman. Man is something that should
> be overcome. What have you done to overcome him?

> All creatures hitherto have created something beyond
> themselves: and do you want to be the ebb of this great
> tide, and return to the animals rather than overcome
> man?

“Creating something beyond themselves” is the goal towards
which all beings are naturally oriented. Humans are encouraged
to mobilize, i.e. actualize their capacities or potentials in order
to “overcome” themselves as they presently are to become
something better or to clear the way for something better. That
is what “all creatures hitherto” have done, and is, by
implication, the natural destiny of humankind. Failing in this
regard, means we are no longer acting as ‘natural’ beings and
have become something ‘unnatural’ by missing our natural
teleological destiny.

The Bahá’í Writings and Nietzsche agree on the teleological
nature of all things, which is to say, all thing are goal-oriented.

‘Abdu’l-Bahá states that “All beings, whether large or small,
were created perfect and complete from the first, but their
perfections appear in them by degrees.” This process of
actualizing their potentials is, in fact, their being or be-ing (the
process remains constant) and shows that they are teleological in
nature, i.e. there is a natural progression from potential or
latency to actualization. The difference between humans and a
seed is that we must strive for our goal consciously whereas the
seed does so unconsciously or automatically. Not only are
individual lives teleological but so is the collective life of
humankind:

> All men have been created to carry forward an ever-
> advancing civilization. The Almighty beareth Me
> witness: To act like the beasts of the field is unworthy of
> man. Those virtues that befit his dignity are forbearance,
> mercy, compassion and loving-kindness towards all the
> peoples and kindreds of the earth.

Here Bahá’u’lláh lists some of the moral potentials humanity
should actualize as it fulfills its goal achieving progress.
Humans must not “act like the beasts of the field” because
doing so conflicts with our spiritual nature and is, in effect, a
betrayal of ourselves because our essential spiritual nature
remains unactualized. Humans—indeed, all beings—can only be
happy when they actualize their appropriate potentials—which is
precisely their goal. Indeed, actualizing our higher, specifically
spiritual potentials is, in effect, the Bahá’í ‘definition’ of
happiness. In the words of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, “True happiness
depends on spiritual good and having the heart ever open to
receive the Divine Bounty.” Opening our hearts to God or
awakening our “spiritual susceptibilities” is, of course, our chief
spiritual potential.

6\. Nietzsche’s “Alleged Atheism—The Death of God

Although Nietzsche is probably the world’s most famous
atheist, we shall demonstrate that his atheism is highly
ambiguous. In fact, Roy Jackson aptly characterizes Nietzsche
as “a ‘sort’ of atheist.” What he destroys with one hand he
restores with the other. We should add that Nietzsche’s
ambiguity about religion and the transcendent is no surprise. It
is already evident in his first major work, The Birth of Tragedy
in which he uses two Greek gods, Apollo and especially
Dionysus, as concrete symbols of transcendental powers of
order and exuberance.

Metaphysically speaking, Nietzsche is not an atheist. It is true
that he overtly rejects the personal God of Abraham, Isaac and
Jacob but in The Will to Power, he offers a metaphysical
description of the will to power in language that effectively re-
creates the ‘God of the philosophers,’ i.e. something with all the
ontological attributes of God. The will to power underlies and
is present in everything; it is unlimited power; it has no
beginning or end; it is mysterious and unknowable; and it is
beyond space and time. Moreover, it is absolutely independent
of each of the forms in which it manifests itself, i.e. it depends
on nothing and, therefore, cannot be constrained by anything.
It is super-natural because nothing in nature has any of these
attributes. We need not belabor the point that in the Bahá’í
Writings, God possess all of these ontological attributes.

At the end of The Will to Power, Nietzsche writes,

> And do you know what “the world” is to me? Shall I
> show it to you in my mirror? This world: a monster of
> energy, without beginning, without end; a firm, iron
> magnitude of force that does not grow bigger or smaller,
> that does not expend itself but only transforms itself ...
> as a becoming that knows no satiety, no disgust, no
> weariness: this, my Dionysian world of the eternally self-
> creating, the eternally self-destroying, this mystery world

> of the twofold voluptuous delight, my “beyond good
> and evil,” without goal, unless the joy of the circle is
> itself a goal; without will, unless a ring feels good will
> toward itself—do you want a name for this world? A
> solution for all its riddles? A light for you, too, you
> best-concealed, strongest, most intrepid, most
> midnightly men?—This world is the will to power—and
> nothing besides! And you yourselves are also this will to
> power—and nothing besides!

In Nietzsche’s view, this ground of being is amoral, i.e.

beyond good and evil. However, the Bahá’í Writings reveal a
convergent idea—namely that God “doeth what He willeth, and
ordaineth that which He pleaseth.” In other words, God—or the
will to power—determines what is good or not and thereby
shows Himself to be “beyond good and evil.” This idea is
illustrated by Bahá’u’lláh’s statement “Shouldst Thou regard him
who hath broken the fast as one who hath observed it, such a
man would be reckoned among them who from eternity had
been keeping the fast.” The disagreement between the Writings
and Nietzsche arises as a result of giving mere humans, i.e. the
aristocrats and nobles, the same power of deciding their own
morality on their own intrinsically limited human terms. This is
logically unjustifiable because they lack the qualifications i.e.
God’s absolute independence from all external influence and
constraint and His complete knowledge of human nature that
entitles them to make decisions for all. Without these
qualifications, their moral choices are, in the end, self-serving
and arbitrary and will inevitably have to be maintained by force.
Moreover, Nietzsche’s description of the will to power cannot
hide one obvious implication: its creativity and the gift of
existence to all things as well as the fact that existence is freely
given since we are not there to earn it. This creativity and
ontological generosity can easily be the basis of positive moral
principles insofar as this super-natural munificence provides a
model for human behavior.

154                                            Lights of Irfán vol. 17

Nietzsche’s atheism is very tentative. For example, in The
Gay Science, the Madman says, “God is dead. God remains dead.
And we have killed him”—and then suggests that we must
become gods to be worthy of this great act. Even in such a
forthright declaration, we can detect signs of what we call the
‘transcendental impulse’ in Nietzsche’s work, an inclination
expressed in both ideas and word choice to re-introduce the
divine or transcendental into our consciousness and our
understanding of life. There is nothing about the death of God,
i.e. atheism, which logically demands that we should take God’s
place by becoming gods.

Here is an example of Nietzsche’s ambiguous language from
Thus Spake Zarathustra, written in the ‘chapter and verse’ style
of the Bible and showing the ‘transcendental impulse’ in his
word choice. Speaking of the “Sublime Men,” Zarathustra says,

> To be sure, I love in him the neck of the ox; but now I
> want to see the eye of an angel, too.

> He must unlearn his heroic will, too: he should be an
> exalted man and not only a sublime itself should raise
> him up, the will-less one!

> He has tamed his monsters, he has solved riddles: but he
> should also redeem his monsters and riddles, he should
> transform them into heavenly children ...

> Then your soul will shudder with divine desires; and
> there will be worship in your vanity!

> This indeed is the secret of the soul: only when the hero
> has deserted his soul does there approach it in dreams—
> the superhero.

The religious tenor of his word choice is supported by the
narrative of the entire Thus Spake Zarathustra itself:
Zarathustra, a Moses-like prophetic figure descends from his

mountain retreat—like Moses bringing His gifts of new
commandments and wisdom—so that humans may continue their
evolution to make way for a higher being called the Superman.
In the idea of becoming gods, he invokes Genesis in which the
Serpent promises Eve, “Ye shall be as gods.” In short, the
Serpent promises to help Adam and Eve to transcend their
human condition. Throughout his work, there are constant
references to words such as ‘spirit,’ ‘holy’ and ‘soul’ words
whose ambiguous scared and non-sacred connotations display
Nietzsche’s ambiguity in regards to the transcendent. The
following statement also his use of religious language even when
repudiating Christian morality:

> Every act of contempt for sex, every impurification of
> it by means of the concept of ‘impure’ is the crime par
> excellence against life—is the real sin against the holy
> spirit of life.

However, the convergences between the Bahá’í Writings and
Nietzsche about God go even further than a common belief in a
transcendental entity. In our view, Nietzsche missed and loved
religion so much he struggled to create, if not a new religion of
his own, then at least an adequate substitute world-view. For
example, he sees the collapse of religion as the basis of the
modern crisis. Nietzsche refers to “the end of Christianity” and
the Writings state “as a result of human perversity, the light of
religion is quenched in men's hearts” This belief logically implies
that religion provides something necessary for the well-being of
human beings and without religion (for whatever reason)
humankind suffers and degenerates. Paradoxically, Nietzsche
seeks a Christ-like ‘redeemer.’ He says of the Superman—whose
name alone carries transcendent connotations—”Behold! I teach
you the Superman: he is the sea, in him your great contempt can
go under.” In this description, the Superman is truly super-
human, i.e. the sea into which we can save ourselves from
overwhelming self-contempt. Like Christ, he can take our sins
on Himself; the Superman can take into himself our contempt

156                                             Lights of Irfán vol. 17

for ourselves and thereby offer us new opportunities for
growth. This, too, points to transcendence for no natural
human being can do such a thing. In addition, this suggests that
the Superman is not entirely natural and somehow beyond
nature. Ironically, this implication of the Superman violates
Zarathustra’s own injunction to be loyal to the earth and to
deny the super-natural. Moreover, the need for a ‘redeemer’
converges with the Bahá’í teaching that Manifestations of God
are necessary for humankind to progress. The pervasive
presence of this ‘transcendent impulse’ helps give a religious
dimension to a thinker who is—superficially perhaps—anti-
religious.

Nor should we overlook that the “eternal return” is itself
strongly tinged with religious and transcendental colors. Seen in
a religious light, it seems much like a non-Christian version of
heaven and hell. R. Kevin Hill states

> the doctrine of eternal recurrence is best understood as a
> replacement for the Christian doctrine of an afterlife of
> rewards and punishments. Recurrence is like a reward for
> those who live well and are strong and a punishment for
> those who live badly and are weak.

Seen as a metaphysical doctrine, i.e. a doctrine about the
basic nature of the universe, the eternal return reveals its
transcendental nature by imposing on the universe the super-
natural attribute of lasting forever. No empirical observation
has ever encountered such an object in nature. So much for
remaining loyal to the earth! In effect, the eternal return claims
that the universe is beyond time since the same results occur
again and again. Such timelessness is precisely one of the
attributes of God in the Writings. Furthermore, the absolute
repetition inherent in the eternal return also means there is no
essential change—an attribute which converges with the Bahá’í
belief that God is not subject to change. On a strictly empirical
basis, Nietzsche was bound to reject these attributes—and the
fact that he did not, highlights his ambiguity about religious

beliefs. But this ambiguity deepens. On the basis of scientific
knowledge of his time, Nietzsche would have known that the
random collision of atoms, i.e. collisions that were causally
unconnected to each other, would not necessarily have brought
about the eternal return. If the collisions are truly random, i.e.
not determined by any preceding event or object, then there is
no necessity whatsoever that today’s world will ever return in
its exact present form. In fact, in a world of genuinely random
actions, there is no necessity of any kind at all: things just
happen without being conditioned, i.e. limited by foregoing
events or other objects. The concept of the “eternal return”
only works if we tacitly assume that atoms have been bestowed
with suitable nature and that laws of nature exist—which
inevitably leads to the issue of how these attributes and laws
originated. In other words, Nietzsche slipped into
transcendental thinking, i.e. thinking that implicitly includes
God. There is nothing in our empirical, earthly experience on
which such concepts can be based for which reason we may say
the “eternal return’ itself is an example of the ‘transcendental
impulse’ in Nietzsche.

Of course, it may be argued that Nietzsche does not mean
‘transcendent’ in any non-physical way, especially in light of his
command to “remain true to the earth.” But that is exactly the
point; as we have shown above by examining Nietzsche’s
language and thought, he cannot live up to his own ideal—he is
fundamentally conflicted and the Transcendent as Jaspers calls
it, is present throughout much of his work. This presence is
exactly where the Bahá’í Writings make contact with Nietzsche.

In light of Nietzsche’s ‘transcendental impulse’ it is highly
improbable that he was an ‘atheist’ as usually understood: a
person who denies any transcendent powers. It is far more likely
that “Nietzsche means the god of transcendental monotheism
and Christian morality ... it is the ‘God’ of Judeo-Christianity
who is dead, but the divine is something totally different.”
From a Bahá’í perspective, this idea poses no difficulties as long
as we understand that Nietzsche is not making an ontological

158                                           Lights of Irfán vol. 17

claim about the existence or non-existence of God or a ground
of being but rather is making a sociological claim about the role
of God in the lives of individuals and societies. In other words,
he is saying—among other things—that the concept of God no
longer plays any significant role in the modern world, that
people have more confidence in themselves, in government and
in science and technology than they do in God or in their own
faith in God. He is also pointing out that organized religion, its
institutions, its hierarchies and theologies have become corrupt
and feeble.

The Bahá’í Writings and Nietzsche agree on the ‘death of
God’ if taken as the recognition that genuine religion—as
distinct from its superficial outward appearances—is no longer a
major force among modern individuals and societies in the
modern world. Free thought, i.e. the independent investigation
of truth, is imprisoned by the clergy. As already noted,
Bahá’u’lláh recognizes that “The vitality of men's belief in God
is dying out in every land.” Speaking of Islam and Christianity,
‘Abdu’l-Bahá states that only the “form has remained in the
hands of the clergy.”

For both the Writings and Nietzsche, the renewal of
humankind involves an unavoidable struggle against clergy who
seek to retain their power. Both seek to overcome the clergy,
but even as Nietzsche clearly aims at the destruction of
priesthood, he still feels a certain kinship and pity with them,
admitting, “There are heroes even among them; many of them
have suffered too much: so they want to make others suffer ... I
want to know my blood honoured even in theirs.” In a similar
attitude of reconciliation, the Writings invite the clergy to join
the Bahá’í dispensation.

> Wherefore flee ye? The Incomparable Friend is manifest.
> He speaketh that wherein lieth salvation. Were ye, O
> high priests, to discover the perfume of the rose garden
> of understanding, ye would seek none other but Him,

> and would recognize, in His new vesture, the All-Wise
> and Peerless One.

7\. Self-overcoming

One of the central concepts of ethical practice in the Bahá’í
Writings and Nietzsche is ‘self-overcoming,’ i.e. taking an
active part in actualizing one’s own potentials, removing
undesirable traits and increasing their powers and capacities.
Self-overcoming is Nietzsche’s strategy for defeating nihilism
which, in his view, is corrupting and destroying modern culture.
This converges with the Bahá’í Writings belief that “Man must
now become imbued with new virtues and powers, new
moralities, new capacities” Obviously, when we gain “new
virtues and powers” our powers will be expanded.

Both in the Bahá’í Writings and Nietzsche we see what may
be called “ethics of power, i.e. an ethics of the growth of power
in the sense of ‘capacity.’ The ultimate purpose of Bahá’u’lláh’s
guidance is allow us to expand our power, i.e. to “awaken [our]
spiritual susceptibilities” and make possible both spiritual and
material progress. This requires conscious self-overcoming and
transformation inspired by Bahá’u’lláh’s revelation; in the case
of Nietzsche, this is achieved by conformity with the will to
power. In both cases, humans have to submit to a Power greater
than themselves and greater than anything in the natural world.

What Zarathustra wants from the people in the valley, does
not contradict what Bahá’u’lláh wants from us.

Self-overcoming is crucial for two reasons. First, it is the
only way to become a bridge to the Superman because by
overcoming ourselves, we remove an obstacle—the present
selves we cling to—so that the Superman may advance. Second,
self-overcoming is the only way to free ourselves from our weak
and cowardly aspects and, thereby, to grow in our pursuit of the
will to power and to become one with our essential selves. In
short, self-overcoming is necessary to end our alienation from

160                                               Lights of Irfán vol. 17

our true identity and, thereby, come into possession of our
selves. Like the Bahá’í Writings, Nietzsche endorses the paradox
that to become our best selves, we must surrender our current
identities. In addition, this “true self” becomes “a shining and
wonderful reality” because, in Nietzsche’s terms, it has done
what is good, i.e. that which “heightens the feeling of power in
man, the will to power, power itself.”

The importance of self-overcoming to Nietzsche is evident in
his belief that self-overcoming “distinguishes the moral [person]
from the nonmoral [person].” This is more evidence that
Nietzsche does, in fact, have a moral code including an
objective standard by which to evaluate our actions: the
willingness and effort to surpass ourselves, the willingness to
suffer the inevitable discomfort and pain of simultaneously
actualizing our potentials for the future and leaving behind our
presently achieved actuality. Zarathustra says that he loves those
who “will [their] own downfall,” i.e. he loves those who are
willing to sacrifice themselves for something greater than
themselves. Later, Zarathustra says,

> And life itself told me this secret: ‘Behold,’ it said, ‘I am
> that which must overcome itself again and again ... ‘I
> would rather perish than renounce this one thing; and
> truly where there is perishing and the falling of leaves,
> behold, there life sacrifices itself—for the sake of power.

Nietzsche carries on this theme in On the Genealogy of Morals:

> All great things bring about their own destruction
> through an act of self-overcoming: thus the law of life
> will have it, the law of the necessity of ‘self-overcoming’
> in the nature of life

Here we observe the ‘pruning’ or ‘self-pruning’ mentioned in
the Writings. For his part, Zarathustra informs us that “only if
he [man] turns away from himself will he jump over his own
shadow—and jump into truth, into his own sunlight.” In other

words, the current self must be rejected for our better or higher
selves which can only be done by embracing transformational
change.

Unlikely as it may seem at first, Nietzsche’s statements
converge strongly with the Bahá’í Writings. In the first place,
there is strong convergence if not outright agreement in regards
to self-overcoming as a necessary aspect of living ethically and
making true progress in self-actualization and living as moral
beings. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá says:

> For I have supplicated and beseeched before the
> Threshold of the Almighty that thy wish may be realized,
> so thou mayest overcome the self and perform charitable
> deeds and that human perfections may appear from thee.

In other words, self-overcoming is needed to “to awaken
spiritual susceptibilities in the hearts of mankind” The theme of
‘self-overcoming’ is also presented in the Writings as ‘sacrifice’
and ‘service’ since, in the Bahá’í view, these lead to the kind of
self-overcoming we need to make.

Speaking of the higher and lower self, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá states:

> The other self is the ego, the dark, animalistic heritage
> each one of us has, the lower nature that can develop
> into a monster of selfishness, brutality, lust and so on. It
> is this self we must struggle against, or this side of our
> natures, in order to strengthen and free the spirit within
> us and help it to attain perfection.

> Self-sacrifice means to subordinate this lower nature and
> its desires to the more godly and noble side of ourselves.
> Ultimately, in its highest sense, self-sacrifice means to
> give our will and our all to God to do with as He pleases.
> Then He purifies and glorifies our true self until it
> becomes a shining and wonderful reality.”
162                                            Lights of Irfán vol. 17

This, too, converges with Nietzsche in significant ways. We
must “give our will and our all to God” in the same way as
Nietzsche expects us to obey the imperative will to power that
functions as ‘God’ in his philosophy.

Self-overcoming also requires us to overcome the traditional
beliefs—especially ethical beliefs—that we have passively
accepted. To the extent that we do not, our self-overcoming is
incomplete and, thereby, less effective and gives us less power
or capacity. Nietzsche believes that we must create our own
ethics and norms—a task that he held as impossible for religious
believers. However, the Bahá’í Writings find no difficulty with
Nietzsche’s requirements insofar as they unequivocally reject
“ancestral imitations” and insist on our obligation to the
independent investigation of truth. The independent
investigation of truth in ethics does not mean we have to reject
the moral guidance of the Manifestations—but rather that we
must to the best of our ability consciously understand such
guidance since otherwise our acts become blind imitation
instead of a rational choice. Investigating and understanding a
given moral law, in effect, makes that law ours even if it is a re-
discovery. As Goethe says, “What you have inherited from your
forefathers, it takes work to make it your own.” In this way, the
principle of the independent investigation of truth absolves the
acceptance of revealed truth from being a mere “ancestral
imitation.” In other words, those who are willing to make the
sacrifices of self-overcoming will be blessed with “the
quickening of mental capacity and the increase of spiritual
susceptibilities.

It may be objected that the Writings proclaim that humans
were meant for happiness—which indeed, they are—but
happiness for the Writings and Nietzsche consists in the
expansion of our powers not in mere ease and comfort be it
psycho-spiritual and/or physical. Athletic training illustrates
this point: the training itself is inevitably uncomfortable,
painful and gruelling—yet the athlete who views this pain in
light of his/her goals, is happy because s/he because s/he can

feel the growth of his/her capacity. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá states: “The
mind and spirit of man advance when he is tried by suffering.”
In short, the suffering required by self-overcoming is necessary
for the happiness that is to come both in this world and the
next. As seen in Thus Spake Zarathustra, Nietzsche also
recognizes the need to be willing to suffer on the way to
becoming a bridge for the Superman or even a Superman
himself.

8\. Perspectivism and Truth

One of the most controversial and influential aspects of
Nietzsche’s philosophy is perspectivism according to which we
can only have perspectives on things but have no true
knowledge of anything.

> Against positivism, which halts at phenomena—“There
> are only facts”—I would say: No, facts is precisely what
> there is not, only interpretations. We cannot establish
> any fact “in itself”: perhaps it is folly to want to do such
> a thing.

> “Everything is subjective,” you say; but even this is
> interpretation. The “subject” is not something given, it
> is something added and invented and projected behind
> what there is ... Finally, is it necessary to posit an
> interpreter behind the interpretation? Even this is
> invention, hypothesis ...

> It is our needs that interpret the world; our drives and
> their For and Against. Every drive is a kind of lust to
> rule; each one has its perspective that it would like to
> compel all the other drives to accept as a norm.

In short, Nietzsche denies the existence of ‘facts’ or ‘truths’
and replaces them with “interpretations” or perspectives or,
more colloquially, opinions. This is the view described by Hales

164                                              Lights of Irfán vol. 17

and Welshon as “strong perspectivism [which] is what many
think Nietzsche offers ... [and which] is self-refuting.” This
claim that there are no ‘facts’ is self-refuting because it cannot
itself be taken as factual. We find “strong perspectivism”
exemplified in the following statement by Nietzsche:

> The apparent world, i.e., a world viewed according to
> values; ordered, selected according to values, i.e., in this
> case according to the viewpoint of utility in regard to
> the preservation and enhancement of the power of a
> certain species of animal.

> The perspective therefore decides the character of the
> “appearance”! As if a world would still remain over after
> one deducted the perspective! By doing that one would
> deduct relativity!

> Every center of force adopts a perspective toward the
> entire remainder, i.e., its own particular valuation, mode
> of action, and mode of resistance. The “apparent
> world,” therefore, is reduced to a specific mode of
> action on the world, emanating from a center.

In other words, all we have is appearances determined by the
perspectives we adopt. There is no “noumenal” or underlying
reality or ‘real’ truth existing independently of some
perspectives. Moreover, Nietzsche states that all truth-claims
are relative since all are the subjective products of a particular
perspective. Since all truth-claims or perspectives are relative,
we cannot judge between contradictory truth-claims because
there is no privileged perspective or viewpoint to function as a
standard by which to judge. This leads to the startling
conclusion that either there is no truth at all or even if there is a
truth, it cannot be known by humankind. Nietzsche writes,

> ‘Truth’ is therefore not something there, that might be
> found or discovered—but something that must be
> created and that gives a name to a process, or rather to a

> will to overcome that has in itself no end—introducing
> truth, as a processus in infinitum, an active
> determining—not a becoming conscious of something
> that is in itself firm and determined. It is a word for the
> “will to power.

Struggles about truth are ultimately struggles about authority
and power. The concept of ‘truth’ depends on the will to power
insofar as all human activities are shaped by each person’s will
to power. He states,

> The “will to truth’ would then have to be investigated
> psychologically: it is not a moral force, but a form of
> the will to power. This would have to be proved by
> showing that it employs every immoral means:
> metaphysicians above all.

In short, there is no such thing as even attempting to seek the
truth objectively.

“Strong perspectivism” has at least five major weak points.

The first results from self-reference: logical self-refutation
(encountered in many postmodern thinkers). If all truth-claims
are perspectival, then this view itself is perspectival—and
therefore, the opposite view that truth is absolute may well be
true at least from some perspectives. But that is exactly what
“strong perspectivism” denies. It says that all truth-claims are
perspectival, thereby including itself. In short, if strong
perspectivism is true, then it may also be false. This is a logically
untenable foundation for any attempt at a coherent philosophy
because it undermines every additional argument built on this
principle.

Second, since perspective determines ‘truth’ there can be no
non-perspectival or extra-perspectival standpoint point from
which to judge among different or competing ‘truths-claims.’
Consequently, there can be no such things as errors. In effect,
all perspectives are true even though we may personally prefer

166                                          Lights of Irfán vol. 17

some to others—but preferences do not constitute truth.
Nietzsche’s view effectively says that there can be no errors
since all perspectives must be accepted as equally valid. This is
not only improbable but also impractical: nature is not so
malleable and accommodating to our perspectives as to let us
think that pencils are genuinely broken in a glass of water—or
that the traffic light is green just because we think so. At some
point we often discover one perspective or the other is false,
i.e. that there is a real, ‘noumenal’ truth underneath our
perceptions that may, in some cases, quite rudely correct our
mistaken views. Furthermore, the Bahá’í the Writings plainly
contradict such ego-inflating ‘infallibilist’ views and clearly
acknowledge the existence of “error”, “idle fancies and vain
imagining,” “ignorance,” “heedlessness and superstition,” and
ideas that are “absurd.” Indeed, Bahá’u’lláh even recognizes that
some religions “are the outcome of human perversity.” The
existence of error harmonizes, as we shall see below, with “weak
perspectivism” i.e. the viewpoint that not all perspectives are
necessarily true.

Third, there is a category mistake insofar as Nietzsche’s
conflation of the will to power with the will to truth mistakes
God with man. In the case of God, the two are the same:
whatever God wills is the truth since God’s will determines the
nature of reality and all parts of reality. “He doeth whatsoever
He willeth, and ordaineth that which He pleaseth.” However,
this is not the case for humans. Who has not had the experience
of interpreting a shadow on a forest walk as a ferocious animal?
Obviously, our interpretations do not ‘make’ facts or reality.
Nature will quickly correct us if our perspective lets us mistake
a crocodile for a convenient log.

Fourth, if perspectives or standpoints determine the truth,
then, there can be no absolute truth that is true in the same way
in all perspectives. This is incompatible with the Writings
because if the statement ‘Bahá’u’lláh is the Manifestation of
God for this age’ is not objectively true across all perspectives

(though not necessarily recognized as true), then the universality
and potency of His revelation is negated.

The problem with Nietzsche, of course, is that on this issue
as on so many others, he is conflicted, making it difficult to
know which view is really his. After all, there is significant
evidence from his work that he is convinced that there are no
absolute truths of any kind. Yet, he blatantly violates his own
principle. The entire doctrine of the will to power would be
negated if its existence were dependent on perspective.
Moreover, there would be an easy escape from Nietzsche’s
philosophy by adopting a different perspective in which the will
to power is not true! If truth is strongly or purely perspectival,
all of Nietzsche’s critiques of European culture, of Christianity
(which he loves to hate) and of spirituality are moot. They have
no validity for other perspectives. How can he purport to
‘unmask’ morality in The Genealogy of Morals if there is
nothing to unmask from Christian morality—except a
perspective whose morals are as valid as the morality that
emerges from Nietzsche’s own perspective? If truth is
perspectival, how can Zarathustra condemn the morals of the
common man—which are true in their perspective? We need not
multiply examples of Nietzsche’s obvious logical entanglements
caused by the conflict between his overt statements that appear
to accept “strong perspectivism” and his actual practice.

Clearly, the Bahá’í Writings reject “strong perspectivism.”
Nowhere do they suggest that truth is entirely subjective, i.e.
wholly dependent on our outlook and perspective. If this were
true, there would be no point in teaching the independent
investigation of truth. There could only be an exploration of
our own perspectives/opinions which are often likely to be
mere “vain imaginings.” Would God really cease to exist if no
one’s perspective included Him? Is Bahá’u’lláh’s station as the
Manifestation for this age or God’s existence really dependent
on human perspective and subjective opinion? If that were the
case, why would Bahá’u’lláh declare,

168                                             Lights of Irfán vol. 17

> Their belief or disbelief in My Cause can neither profit
> nor harm Me. We summon them wholly for the sake of
> God. He, verily, can afford to dispense with all
> creatures.

In other words, God and the Cause of God are independent of
any human perspective or interpretation. There truths are not
relative.

Clearly, the Bahá’í Writings suggest that all perspectives are
not equally true or valid, and that at least on some issues, truth
is not relative. In other words, our own perspectives, which may
be based on the false imaginations may lead us to deny the
existence of the Manifestation—but this perspective is false
even if it is sincerely held. Sincerity itself is not a guarantor of
truth or logical validity; sincerely held beliefs can be wrong.
Furthermore, Bahá’u’lláh advises us to “meditate profoundly ...
so that light may be distinguished from darkness, truth from
falsehood, right from wrong, guidance from error, happiness
from misery, and roses from thorns.” These distinctions
demonstrate there is no attempt made to salvage all possible
views by attributing them to differing standpoints or
perspectives and by declaring them all to be relatively true. At
least some perspectives are able to provide truth while others
are not.

There is a fifth problem with “strong perspectivism,” viz. it
also leads to problems vis-à-vis understanding the Bahá’í
Writings. For example, after explaining that the four methods
of acquiring truth are flawed ‘Abdu’l-Bahá writes, “there is no
standard in the hands of people upon which we can rely.” This
sounds like “strong perspectivism.” However, if we accept this
interpretation non-reflectively, i.e. without analysis, a serious
problem rapidly arises: Shall we understand ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s
declaration to mean that we cannot know with certainty even
the most ‘elemental facts’ such as (1) human beings need food or
they will starve to death; (2) the seasons progress in a specific
and orderly manner; (3) lobsters do not grow up to be maple

trees and (4) the sun appears to move from east to west across
the sky? Do the Writings really mean to suggest that there is no
certain human knowledge about anything at all including
Napoleon’s defeat at Moscow, yesterday’s sunrise, and the law
of gravity? If we take the “strong” view at face value, needless
entanglements arise from one of Bahá’u’lláh’s statements:

> In pursuance, however, of the principle that for every
> thing a time hath been fixed, and for every fruit a season
> hath been ordained, the latent energies of such a bounty
> can best be released, and the vernal glory of such a gift
> can only be manifested, in the Days of God.

The message here would be undermined or even negated if
seasonal change were disputed or even disputable. The moment
we deny the certainty of our knowledge of seasonal change, the
whole point Bahá’u’lláh is trying to make becomes moot. It
would cause needless confusion because we would not really
‘know’ that “for every fruit a season hath been ordained.”
Bahá’u’lláh knows—but could we know that our knowledge of
the seasons is what He is actually referring to? The same
problem would arise if Bahá’u’lláh used other examples, such as
the tides or the moon’s course around the earth. It is difficult
not to conclude that the Writings are not intended to cause
such difficulties.

While there is no agreement about “strong perspectivism” in
the Bahá’í Writings and Nietzsche, there is far-reaching
agreement in regards to “weak perspectivism” which Welshon
attributes to Nietzsche. He explains it as follows:

> Suppose weak perspectivism is true for every other
> statement except itself. It then turns out that for the
> thesis of weak perspectivism, absolutism is true. Why?
> Because truth absolutism claims there is at least one
> statement that is true in all perspectives. Perhaps the
> only such statement is the thesis of weak perspectivism.

Here, then is a way to rescue Nietzsche’s truth
170                                            Lights of Irfán vol. 17

> perspectivism without abandoning the spirit behind it ...
> Perhaps there are other statements in addition to the
> thesis of weak perspectivism that are true across all
> perspectives.

The possibility of some absolute truths, i.e. truths from all
perspectives means that, in effect, some truths are not
dependent on perspective, and even opens up the possibility of
“extra-perspectival” truths which is how the Bahá’í Writings
characterize God’s revelations. Furthermore, this also revives
the possibility that there exist some objective standards by
which to judge various perspectives. Finally, error is possible;
not all perspectives necessarily give us the truth.

A significant agreement between “weak perspectivism” and
the Bahá’í Writings emerges when he examine Shoghi Effendi’s
statements about progressive revelation. He writes,

> The mission of the Founder of their Faith, they conceive
> it to be to proclaim that religious truth is not absolute
> but relative, that Divine Revelation is continuous and
> progressive, that the Founders of all past religions,
> though different in the non-essential aspects of their
> teachings, “abide in the same Tabernacle, soar in the
> same heaven, are seated upon the same throne, utter the
> same speech and proclaim the same Faith.”

Further, he asserts that each Manifestation

> restates the eternal verities they enshrine, coordinates
> their functions, distinguishes the essential and the
> authentic from the nonessential and spurious in their
> teachings, separates the God-given truths from the
> priest-prompted superstitions.

To summarize in Hales’ and Welshon’s language about “weak
perspectivism,” the relative truths, i.e. those which were not
valid in all perspectives could be changed as historical

conditions alter. Among these were the “spurious” “priest
prompted superstitions” and the “non-essential” specific
adaptations to geographic and cultural circumstances. They are
completely dependent on perspective i.e. the standpoint of a
particular culture at a particular time under particular
circumstances. However, there are also “eternal verities” and
“God-given truths” that are valid in all perspectives, i.e. they are
absolute. Such “verities” are “restat[ed]” in every dispensation—
across multiple perspectives—and while they may be expanded
or given new form, the essential truths they convey remain true.
In other words, the Bahá’í Writings can accept the doctrine that
all statements come from a particular perspective—but in “weak
perspectivism” that does not mean that some statements cannot
be true across all perspectives.

“Weak perspectivism” also allows a robust commitment to
the unity of truth. As ‘Abdu’l-Bahá affirms, “No one truth can
contradict another truth.” He supports this by stating, that
“truth or reality is not multiple; it is not divisible” and “truth is
one, although its manifestations may be very different.”
Differences in the “manifestations” of truth do not necessarily
imply logical contradictions which ‘Abdu’l-Bahá seeks to avoid.
Shoghi Effendi re-affirms this theme, saying, “Truth may, in
covering different subjects, appear to be contradictory, and yet
it is all one if you carry the thought through to the end.” He
adds, “Truth is one when it is independently investigated, it
does not accept division.” “Weak perspectivism” easily
accommodates the Writings on this issue and so does Nietzsche
if read in this way.

Our conclusion is clear: if Nietzsche’s perspectivism is
understood in Hales’ and Welshon’s sense as “weak
perspectivism” and as implicitly practiced by Nietzsche, there is
agreement with the Bahá’í Writings. “Weak perspectivism,”
provides a more flexible outlook because it recognizes relative,
perspectival truths such as seen in the cultural adaptations of
the divine teachings and, it recognizes absolute cross-
perspectival truths as seen in the “eternal verities” restated by

172                                          Lights of Irfán vol. 17

the Manifestations. It also recognizes that at least some of
Nietzsche’s teachings must be accepted as absolutely true, viz.
self-overcoming, the will to power and the eternal return. If
Nietzsche’s perspectivism is understood as “strong
perspectivism,” as overtly stated by Nietzsche—though
implicitly contradicted in much of what he writes—then there is
no agreement between him and the Writings.

“Weak perspectivism” avoids outlandish consequences that
needlessly complicate and impede the quest for knowledge and
truth. After all, it is indisputable that Beethoven is physically
dead; that tides come in and go out and a broken leg is really
broken. What is to be gained by understanding the Bahá’í
Writings in a way that opens them to such critiques as have seen
above?

“Weak perspectivism” as in the following example from
‘Abdu’l-Bahá is immune from the critiques that undermine
“strong perspectivism.”

> He has bestowed upon [man] the power of intellect so
> that through the attribute of reason, when fortified by
> the Holy Spirit, he may penetrate and discover ideal
> realities and become informed of the mysteries of the
> world of significances.

This statement embodies “weak perspectivism” insofar as under
some circumstances—the inspiration of the Holy Spirit—reliably
true knowledge about the “ideal realities” and the super-natural
“world of significances” can be attained. There is no suggestion
here that we need to doubt elemental facts such as difference
between apples and horse shoe crabs. We should also remember
that the inspiration of the Holy Spirit may impart such
intellectual virtues as true independence in the investigation of
truth; justice in the quest for fair and accurate presentation;
humility to accept the truths we find even though they may not
be what we hoped or expected; and wisdom in applying what we
find in a positive way. There is no reason to limit the Holy

Spirit’s inspiration to such theological virtues as faith, hope and
charity. When we understand this, we can also see how and why
we have true knowledge of the ‘elemental facts’ because nothing
prevents the Holy Spirit from acting in our lives on a
continuous basis at least vis-à-vis the basic intellectual virtues.

Elsewhere, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá notes,

> the bounty of the Holy Spirit gives the true method of
> comprehension which is infallible and indubitable. This
> is through the help of the Holy Spirit which comes to
> man, and this is the condition in which certainty can
> alone be attained.

Under the right circumstances—receiving the bounty of the
Holy Spirit—we can know spiritual truths with certainty. The
argument that ‘truth’ is not the same as ‘certainty’ is weak since
that implies the Holy Spirit can give us certainty about
untruths. That defeats the purpose of trusting in the Holy
Spirit. Speaking about love, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá concludes,

> This is a proof perceptible to the senses, acceptable to
> reason, in accord with traditions and teachings of the
> Holy Books and verified by the promptings of human
> hearts themselves. It is a proof upon which we can
> absolutely rely and declare to be complete

Here, too, we observe the possibility of attaining reliable
knowledge from some perspectives and, thereby, the agreement
with “weak perspectivism” not just vis-à-vis elemental facts but
also spiritual truths such as the existence of God, which,
according to ‘Abdu’l-Bahá can be logically proven: “The
existence of the Divine Being hath been clearly established, on
the basis of logical poofs.” “Weak perspectivism” also allows us
to accommodate such statements as “Numerous and conclusive
proofs exist that go to show that this infinite world cannot end
with this human life.” Elsewhere, he adds,

174                                             Lights of Irfán vol. 17

> It is my hope that from day to day your gatherings will
> grow and flourish, and that those who are seeking after
> truth will hearken therein to reasoned arguments and
> conclusive proofs.

And,

> Day and night must you think, strive and investigate,
> that you may attain to the mysteries of the Kingdom;
> that you may attain certainty in knowledge; that you may
> know this world has a Creator, has a Maker, has a
> Resuscitator, has a Provider, has an Architect—but know
> this through proofs and evidences, not through
> susceptibilities; nay rather through decisive proofs,
> evident arguments and real vision—that is to say,
> visualizing it just as you visualize the sun. May you with
> complete certainty behold the signs of God and attain to
> the knowledge of the holy divine Manifestations.

Each one of these passages—and there are others to choose
from—makes use of the idea of “conclusive” knowledge, or
“certainty” or “proofs” and, thereby, show that the Writings are
in harmony with “weak perspectivism” and the possibility of at
least some statements being true across all perspectives.

9\. Conclusion

In the foregoing exploration, we have shown that, despite
first appearances to the contrary, there are a surprisingly large
number of correlations between the Bahá’í Writings and
Nietzsche’s philosophy. Among them we find such issues as

> 1. teleology;
2. perspectivism in Hale’s and Welshon’s sense of “weak

perspectivism;”
> 3. the process nature of reality;
> 4. Aristotle’s ontology of potentials,

5. the existence of a transcendent           power      or   force

manifesting in all things;
6. the importance of the transcendent aspects of existence;

the religious impulse in man;
7. the unavoidable agonistic aspects of life, not by political

> means but by means of new ideas, revitalized values, good
> personal examples, energized hope, and appeals to the
> spiritual elements in human nature;
> 8. the decline of the present world order;
9. the need for revolutionary change (though not change by

political revolution);
10. the rejection of partisan politics, nationalism and

imperialism;
11. the universal will to power as the self-overcoming and

actualization of potentials;
> 12. the central role of sublimation and self-overcoming;
13. the call for “a new race of men” transcending the current

state of human development;
> 14. life as a agonistic process in various ways;
> 15. loyalty to the earth;
> 16. will as present in all things.

Of course, there are also areas of difference and irresolvable
disagreement:

At this point a question arises: ‘To what degree do the
differences undermine the correlations between the Bahá’í
Writings and Nietzsche?’ The answer depends on how we choose
to read Nietzsche. If we read him in light of Kaufmann’s claim
that the will to power and sublimation (which includes self-
overcoming) are the “core” of Nietzsche’s philosophy, then the
undermining capacity of these differences is limited. As we have
shown, the master-slave morality, the transvaluation of values,
“the violent aristocratic radicalism,” the atheism if taken at face
value and the “strong” interpretation of perspectivism and
living beyond good and evil are not compatible with
Kaufmann’s understanding of the “core” of Nietzsche’s
philosophy. In one way or another, they conflict with the ethic
of sublimation and self-overcoming in order to actualize our
potentials both individually and socially. Thereby, they frustrate
human development which requires us to be more than we are.
If we think we are beyond good and evil; that we are aristocrats
and masters with a right to rule over ‘slaves’; that there is no
truth to know or that can be known; that there is no progress
and everything stays as it is or that the material world is all there
is, then there will be little or no incentive to pursue a life of
self-overcoming and sublimation of our animal natures. In all
likelihood, we will find ourselves among the self-satisfied and
comfortable. In our view, neither the Writings nor Nietzsche
advocate such a life.

From our Kaufmannian perspective, because these points
negate or at least avoid the principle of self-overcoming and
sublimation, they do not really undermine the correlations we
have identified. That is because the differences are based on
premises incompatible with Kaufmann’s view. Consequently, we

must conclude that Nietzsche’s work is divided by
inconsistencies. This fact weakens his philosophy and
encourages us to turn to the Bahá’í Writings instead.
