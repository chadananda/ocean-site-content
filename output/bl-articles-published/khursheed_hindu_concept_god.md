               The Hindu Concept of God:
Unity in Diversity

Anjam Khursheed

Abstract

This paper correlates Hindu concepts of God to those found in the Semitic
religious tradition and the Baha'i Faith. By demonstrating the
fundamental unity behind these beliefs, different schools of thought within
Hinduism are harmonised. Also highlighted, is the spiritual principle of
unity in diversity, common both to the metaphysical world-view of
Hinduism and the Baha'i Faith. It is suggested that this principle might
form the basis by which Hindu and Baha'i beliefs can come together and
further their common goal of uniting the world's spiritual traditions.

1\. Introduction

Progressive revelation is the Baha'i principle that all religions represent
successive stages in the spiritual evolution of mankind, and that each
religion is suited to the time and place in which it is revealed. A common
misconception about this principle is that the Baha'i Faith somehow
replaces the religions of the past. Since the Baha'i Faith claims to be the
latest religion in this process, it is tempting to conclude that the former
religions are no longer relevant to the world's needs, or that they will not
play an important role in the future. But a careful investigation into the
Baha'i writings indicates that this conclusion is not implied by the
principle of progressive revelation. Moreover, a study into world religious
history also indicates that there are limits to understanding the religions of
the world merely by placing them in chronological order.

THE SINGAPORE BAHÁT STUDIES REVIEW

There are passages in the Baha'i writings that warn against assigning a
position of inherent superiority to the Baha'i Faith with respect to other
religions. Shoghi Effendi, the appointed interpreter of the Baha'i
Writings, states that:

> "Let no one, however, mistake my purpose. The
> Revelation, of which Baha'uTlah is the source and
> center, abrogates none of the religions that have
> preceded it, nor does it attempt, in the slightest degree,
> to distort their features or to belittle their value. It
> disclaims any intention of dwarfing any of the Prophets
> of the past, or of whittling down the eternal verity of
> their teachings. It can, in no wise, conflict with the
> spirit that animates their claims, nor does it seek to
> undermine the basis .of any man's allegiance to their
> cause. Its declared, its primary purpose is to enable
> every adherent of these Faiths to obtain a fuller
> understanding of the religion with which he stands
> identified, and to acquire a clearer apprehension of its
> purpose. It is neither eclectic in the presentation of its
> truths, nor arrogant in the affirmation of its claims. Its
> teachings revolve around the fundamental principle that
> religious truth is not absolute but relative, that Divine
> Revelation is progressive, not final. Unequivocally and
> without the least reservation it proclaims all established
> religions to be divine in origin, identical in their aims,
> complementary in their functions, continuous in their
> purpose, indispensable in their value to mankind." l

This passage not only makes it clear that all religions, including the
Baha'i Faith, have "identical aims", are "complementary in their
functions", are "indispensable in their value to mankind", but that the
Baha'i Faith must assist someone of another Faith to "obtain a fuller
understanding of the religion with which he stands identified, and to
acquire a clearer apprehension of its purpose". This means that Baha'is
are not in competition with members of other Faiths, vying for spiritual

converts. Neither do they seek to "undermine the basis of any man's
allegiance" to his or her own spiritual tradition.

The relationship of the Baha'i Faith to other religions and the nature of
progressive revelation is further elaborated in another passage by Shoghi
Effendi. Here the danger of relegating other religions to an inferior status
is explicitly highlighted, and the fundamental unity of the Baha'i Faith to
all religions is described in terms of the "evolution of one religion",

The Baha'i approach is one that emphasises the underlying unity behind
all religions. It cannot compete with other Faiths because it believes all
religions, including itself, to be part of an "evolution of one religion". It
aims at "restating the fundamentals" of each Faith, to "reconcile their
aims", to "reinvigorate their life", to "demonstrate their oneness", to
"restore the pristine purity of their teachings" and to "assist in the
realization of their highest aspirations". The task facing Baha'is is to
bring about the rebirth of the other religions, not to supersede them. This
point cannot be overemphasised. Clearly the goal of establishing the unity
of religions will involve Baha'is and people of other religions working
together. This means that each religion will have a part to play in the
spiritual future of mankind.

In its goal to unite the world's religious Faiths, to "demonstrate their
oneness", the Baha'i Faith is seeking to do something which has not
hitherto been attempted. All religious Faiths have up till now, at least
within the orbit of their own sacred scriptures, confined their message to a
specific group of people or religious tradition. Of course, many of them
hint at a future day, a promised day when peace and unity will be
established amongst all people, but that is not the focus of their message.
The message in the Hebrew scriptures is largely directed to the Israelites,
and its implication for the Gentiles is only hinted at. Christ spoke first and
foremost to the Jewish tradition, it was only later taken to the Gentile
world by the apostle St Paul. In Islam, the message is for the most part,
directed to the People of the Book, that is, to the Christians and Jews.
These three religions make up what is known as the Semitic line of
religions. They have a common tradition bound together by race and
prophecy.

Taking a broad perspective, world religious history would appear to be
composed of different lines of religious development: the Semitic
tradition, the Indian tradition, the Chinese tradition, and many more native

Shoghi Effendi, World Order ofBahd'u'lldh, pp 114-116

The Hindu Concept of God: Unity in Diversity

religious traditions, all of which are largely confined both in their written
scriptures and oral traditions to a specific race or culture. The Baha'i aim
of establishing the fundamental unity of religions involves widening "the
basis" of existing religions by universalising them, so that their "first and
everlasting principles" can be shared by people from all traditions.

It would appear that religions have not only been developing
chronologically, that is sequentially, the latest one referencing and
building on the previous ones, but they have also been developing in
parallel. The religions in the Semitic tradition for instance, do not to make
any reference to the religions which grew up in India and vice versa.

The sequential side of progressive revelation is most clearly illustrated
within each religious tradition. On the other hand, the complementary
nature of religious truth is visible between different religious traditions.
They are by no means mutually exclusive. From the Baha'i point of view,
it is only the secondary aspects of religions that differ, that is in terms of
their social laws and observances, but in their fundamental spiritual
aspects, they are one. Religions within the same tradition also exhibit
complementarity. Interaction between religions of different traditions has
also occurred and their history has not been entirely independent, so the
picture is not a simple one. The main point here is that religions have
developed both sequentially and in parallel.

The Baha'i Faith's relationship to other religions might be illustrated by
two analogies. In the Baha'i writings, the spiritual development of
mankind as a whole is likened to the growth of a human being, who grows
through the various stages of childhood, youth and adulthood3. Rejecting
the conclusion that each religion is somehow superseded or inferior to the
successive one, it is stated that, "does not the child succumb in the youth
and the youth in the man; yet neither child or youth perishes"4. During
childhood, a human being learns fundamental principles which stay with
him for the rest of his life, arguably, childhood is the most important
period. Most of us in childhood and youth go through various
experiences, learn different principles, which are not related together. It is

only usually during the adult phase of our lives that the different
experiences of our past are pieced together, put into a wider perspective.
It is only usually as an adult that the different lessons of the past acquire a
greater meaning. Of course, each phase of our life is equally important,
and at any one stage, we are still the same person. Along each phase of
our growth, we are discovering more about ourselves. But the
consciousness of our self-identity does not fully mature until we are
adults, this is the time that we are best able to integrate our different
experiences together. The Baha'i claim is that mankind as a whole is
approaching the phase of maturity or adulthood, and is at present caught
in the tumultuous phase of the rebellious youth5. All religions have taught
us fundamental lessons which will always remain, but this is the time in
our collective history when all these different past experiences will be
brought together.

Another analogy implied in the Baha'i writings is of different territories
on the earth's surface6. Viewed from the earth's surface, each territory
appears to be separate from the other. Even when standing from the peak
of a high mountain, a specific landscape comes into view. The landscape
we see depends on our position on the earth. Each territory is beautiful,
has its own character, its own climate, its own distinctive terrain. But
from above the earth's surface, say from the moon, all territories form the
surface of a single planet. Viewed from this cosmological perspective,
there is a wider beauty, an underlying unity, a unity in diversity which
cannot be seen while standing on the earth's surface. Likewise, each
religion has lived within its own cultural climate and has its own
distinctive landscape of beliefs. The Baha'i principle of religious unity
involves seeing the underlying spiritual reality behind all religions, taking
a global view of our collective religious history.

The goal of world religious unity, as a commandment which is explicitly
revealed in sacred scripture, is unique to the Baha'i Faith. Other religions
have been largely confined to a specific culture or people. The diversity
and beauty of each religious landscape is enhanced by taking a global
view: within the greater landscape, the distinctive character of each

territory is brought into greater perspective. But the goal specifically
undertaken by the BaháT Faith, is to bring about a greater unity, a
planetary consciousness which encompasses all our individual religious
traditions and integrates them into a wider single spiritual experience.

The purpose of this paper is to show how the Baha'i aim of demonstrating
the fundamental unity of religions applies to Hinduism. To the casual
observer coming from the Semitic line of religions, there are many
possible ways in which Hinduism may be misunderstood. Hinduism is
often criticised for being polytheistic, anthropomorphic, blasphemous,
pantheistic and idolatrous.

It is not difficult to see how modern Hinduism might give rise to such
impressions. Taken at face value, Hindus believe in many gods, the three
main ones being Brahma, Vishnu and Shiva. The gods most widely
worshipped are Shiva, Shakti, Vishnu, Lakshmi, Ganesha, Murthi and
Krishna. Temples are dedicated to Shiva, Shakti, Vishnu and Krishna. In
a single temple visit, prayers and offerings are made to different statues,
each of which represents a different god. The Hindu typically starts with
worshipping the most important deity at the centre, and then makes his or
her way around to the lesser ones which encircle it.

Not only are there numerous gods, but they are believed to be related
together by family ties. Brahma's wife is a Goddess named Saraswati,
while the Goddess married to Vishnu is Lakshmi. The wife of Shiva goes
under the name Parvati. Ganesha and Murthi are worshipped as sons of
Parvati. For an outsider coming from the Semitic line of religions, these
beliefs are not only polytheist but also overtly anthropomorphic.

There is also the issue of apparent idol worship. The god Visnu for
instance, is represented by a blue statue having four arms, holding a
conch, discus, mace and lotus flower. Shiva is often depicted as a many-
armed dancer having dark skin and wearing a snake around his neck. The
son of Parvati, Ganesha, has an elephant's head and a human body. The
representation of the Hindu gods is extremely complex, and each god has
many different images, but the main point here is that such images and
idols are commonly used, and although the gods which they symbolise are
believed to be immortal, Omnipresent, and Omniscient, in practice, they

10               THE SINGAPORE BAHAT STUDIES REVIEW

are worshipped in the form of idols. The Hindu practice is seemingly
diametrically opposed to say Judaism, whose identifying mark is its
monotheistic challenge to abandon the use of idols and graven images, in
its message to the people of the ancient world to worship the one invisible
God.

At the other extreme, Hinduism is often described as being pantheistic.
The unity of God is taken so far, that in the tradition of Advaita Vedanta,
a dominant influence in the modem Hindu Faith, the summit of wisdom is
related to understanding that the whole universe is God. In the words of
Shankara, the medieval sage who reinterpreted ancient Hindu text this
way and upon whom the Advaita Vedanta school is based, "Our
perception of the universe is a continuous perception of Brahman, though
the ignorant man is not aware of this. Indeed, this universe is nothing but
Brahman" 7. This tradition seeks to experience unity with God. Shankara
in his moment of enlightenment stated that "I have realized my identity
with Brahman" 8. This conception of God is expressed as the "non-dual"
or "monist" conception of Hinduism. Viewed from the perspective of the
Semitic line of religions, the Advaita Vedanta school may appear both
pantheist and blasphemous.

The extreme monism of the Advaita Vedanta school is closely related to
the many forms of monastic and ascetic movements of Hinduism. It was
in fact Shankara who set up the first Hindu monastic orders. Many forms
of yoga are designed to train a monk in the ways of the Advaita Vedanta
school and lead to the mystic union of the sage with God, whereby he
realises that he is identical to God.

The Advaita Vedanta has a strong influence on modern movements in
India. A disciple of the well-known 19th century sage Ramakrishna,
called Naren, at first expressed his scepticism concerning the non-dualist
goal of being identical to God, thinking it was blasphemous, but then later
came to believe it in his moment of enlightenment. He described his
insight in the following way, "Wherever I looked I saw Brahman and
Brahman alone. I lived in that consciousness the whole day. I returned

home, and that same experience continued. When I sat down to eat I saw
that the food, plate, the server, and I myself - all were Brahman" 9. Unlike
the saints of the Semitic religions, it is quite natural for the Hindu saint to
identify himself to be God.

The Advaita Vedanta is only one movement within Hinduism. There is
also the school of "qualified dualism", based upon the teachings of the
medieval theologian Ramanuja. Ramanuja's theology grew out of his
opposition to Shankara's monism. He likened the relationship between
man and God to be similar to the connection between the body and the
soul. The soul, though distinct from the body, controls and guides it, lives
in it, and uses it as an instrument. Similarly, Brahman is the soul of the
universe, ruling over it, directing it.10 There are other strands of Hindu
thought which also oppose Shankara's extreme monism, so it must be
remembered that the tendency of the Hindu sage to identify himself with
God is not universally accepted within Hinduism.

This paper aims to demonstrate the fundamental unity of Hinduism with
the Semitic line of religions. Monotheism in the Hindu Faith is present in
the form of a superior background principle, which while not rejecting
polytheistic and anthropomorphic practices, transcends them. Apart from
the sacred scriptures of Hinduism, use of the Baha'i concepts of God,
human nature and progressive revelation are correlated with Hindu
beliefs. A major strength of Hinduism will be highlighted, namely its
inherent principle of unity in diversity with respect to its religious
practices and concept of God. Generally speaking, this aspect of
Hinduism has made it a non-dogmatic Faith and has protected it from
many of the divisive doctrinal disputes that have occurred in other
religions. This principle of unity in diversity with respect to its
metaphysical beliefs and religious worship is in harmony with similar
principles within the Baha'i Faith.

2\. The Vedas

One of the most common statements made about Hinduism is that unlike
other religions, it has no single founder. This statement is both true and
false. It is true that Hinduism cannot be compared to Islam or
Christianity, each of which has a single founder and a single holy book. It
is false, because Hinduism can be compared to Judaism, where the long
line of Hebrew prophets who emerge out of antiquity bear resemblance to
the long line of Hindu sages, who also stretch back into the beginning of
recorded history.

Although the entire corpus of Hindu literature is vast, the number of texts
which all Hindus regard as sacred is much smaller. The scripture known
as the Vedas are the oldest and date from around 1500 BC to 1200 BC.
It is impossible to put an exact date to these texts, let alone know anything
about the sages who wrote them.

The Vedas themselves consist of different parts. There is the part known
as "Samhitas", which consist of mantras or hymns of praise to various
nature gods. There is the part that relates to the details of sacrificial rites,
duties and conduct, known as "Brahmanas". This is complemented by a
part called "Aranyakas" which provide the spiritual meaning to the
sacrifices and rites. But it is the last part of the Vedas, the part dealing
with knowledge, the "Upanishads", that is by far the most widely read
section of the Vedic lore.

The large pantheon of Vedic gods are similar to the nature gods of other
ancient cultures. They are for the most part linked to the natural elements
which sustain human life and are conceived of in familiar human terms. In
one hymn, Indra, the rain god, has a body clad in golden armour, descends
to earth where he lives and eats with his votaries, fights and overcomes
his enemies, and establishes his dominion. At times, a god is understood
to be both the provider of the moral order as well as the physical one.
This is the case with the sky god Varuna, who was believed to be both
omnipresent and a god of righteousness who had the power to forgive
sins.

There are some signs of monotheism in the predominantly polytheistic
Vedic period. There is a well known verse in the Reg-Veda, an early set of
Vedic hymns, which states, 'They call it Indra, Mitra, Varuna, Agni and
it is the heavenly bird that flies. The wise speak of what is One in many
ways; they call it Agni, Yama, Mitarisvan." (Rg-Veda I: 164: 46). This
passage indicates that there was a monotheist belief in the spiritual unity
underlying the diversity of the Vedic gods.

There are also other indications of an early form of monotheism. The
creation hymn of the "Golden Embryo" describes a "lordňpf creation" who
precedes all the gods and is the unitary cause of creation

"In the beginning the Golden Embryo arose. Once he was born, he was
the one lord of creation. He held in place the earth and this sky. Who is
the god whom we should worship with the oblation? He who gives life,
who gives strength, whose command all the gods, his own, obey; his
shadow is immortality - and death. Who is the god whom we should
worship with the oblation? He who by his greatness became the one King
of the world that breathes and blinks, who rules over his two-footed and
four-footed creatures - who is the god whom we should worship with the
oblation? .... O Prajapati, lord of progeny, no one but you embraces all
these creatures. Grant us the desires for which we offer you oblation. Let
us be lords of riches." (Reg-Veda 10: 121)

Prajapati represents the unitary godhead of the Vedic period. He is
conceived of both as a principle of righteousness and the Father of
creation. There is also reference to the "One" of the famous Creation
Hymn, which describes the primordial cause behind all phenomena,
preceding "non-existence and existence".

> "There was neither non-existence nor existence then;
> there was neither the realm of space nor the sky which is

> has arisen - perhaps it formed itself, or perhaps it did not
> - the One who looks down on it, the highest heaven, only
> He knows - or perhaps He does not know.”
> (Reg-Veda 10:129)

The main theme that emerges from these passages is the spiritual unity
underlying the apparent diversity of creation. Although the gods were
believed to be immortal, they were still considered to be a part of creation.
The “gods came afterwards”, whereas the One preceded everything. This
unity in diversity is characteristic of Hinduism throughout its long history.
The unity of the Godhead transcends the diversity of the gods, not by
rejecting it, as it was done in the Semitic line of religions, but by being
present at a higher level.

3\. The Upanishads

The trend towards unity in the early Vedic period reaches its climax in the
Upanishads. Little is known about the sages who wrote the Upanishads,
and their date, as with other ancient Hindu literature is not known exactly.
Scholars think that the Upanishads may have been written between 800-
200 BC.

3\.1 The Unknowable God

In the Upanishads, there are many points of similarity to the Semitic
religious tradition. A clear point of unity between the Semitic religions
and the Upanishads is the transcendent nature of God. All concepts of
God, according to the Upanishads are inherently inaccurate. God is unlike
anything which the mind of man can conceive. Ultimately, the most
accurate description of God is no description at all. Like the via negativa
of the medieval Semitic theologians, the Upanishads describe God as “not
this, not that”, that is, in the negative form

> “ The Intelligence which reveals all - by what shall it be
> revealed? By whom shall the knower be known? The
> Self is described as not this, not that. It is
> incomprehensible, for it cannot be comprehended;
> undecaying, for it never decays; unattached, for it never
> attaches itself; unbound, for it is never bound. By whom,
> O my beloved, shall the Knower be known”
> (Brhadaranyaka Upanishad 4: 5: 15).

In another passage, the sages of the Upanishads clearly imply that the
most common conceptions of God in their time were mistaken, that is, too
literal, and that Brahman is beyond all the words, thoughts and images
that the mind of man can conjure up

> “What cannot be spoken with wtfirds, but that whereby
> words are spoken: Know that alone to be Brahman,
> Spirit; and not what people here adore. What cannot be
> thought with the mind, but that whereby the mind can
> think: Know that alone to be Brahman, the Spirit; and
> not what people here adore. What cannot be seen with
> the eye, but that whereby the eye can see: Know that
> alone to be Brahman, the Spirit; and not what people
> here adore...”
> (Kena Upanishad 1: 1-3)

The parallels to the “God who hidest thyself’ (Isaiah 45: 15) of Judaism,
or the God “beyond all that they describe of Him” (Quran 6:100) in Islam

16              THE SINGAPORE BAHA'f STUDIES REVIEW

is obvious. God in one passage of the Upanishads, is even defined as
silence

"Sir", said a pupil to his master, "teach me the nature of Brahman". The
master did not reply. When a second and a third time he was importuned,
he answered: "I teach you indeed, but you do not follow. His name is
silence" n .

There is a similarity here with Buddha's apparent silence on God. Rather
than his silence being the negation of the concept of God, perhaps it was
God's unknowability that he wanted to express.

The Upanishads transcend the polytheism of the Vedas. The Vedic gods,
whenever they are mentioned in the Upanishads, are either expressions of
Brahman in the created world, or they are vying with one another to know
Brahman (Kena Upanishads Part3 and 4). The unknowability of God, as
stated in the Upanishads, avoids the danger of anthropomorphism, and the
nature of the Vedic gods appear to be comparable to the character of
"angels" in the Semitic religions, rather than being the unitary Godhead
which is above all likeness.

In the Baha'i writings, the inconjprehensible nature of God is mentioned
on many occasions. Baha'u'llah explicitly states that, "Immeasurably
exalted is He above the strivings of the human mind to grasp His Essence,
or of human tongue to describe His mystery" 12. In the Seven Valleys, in
connection with a human being trying to fathom the mystery of God,
Baha'u'llah asks, "How can utter nothingness gallop its steed in the field
of pre-existence, or a fleeting shadow reach to the everlasting sun." 13
'Abdu'1-Bahá, the son of Baha'u'llah, expanding on this latter image,
likens man's relationship to God in the following way, "The furthermost
limits of this bird of clay are these: he can flutter along for some short

\[11\] Quoted by Prabhavanda, The Spiritual Heritage of India, p 45,

\[13\] Baha'u'llah, Seven Valleys, p 23

distance, into the endless vast; but he can never soar upward to the Sun in
the high Heavens" 14.

The Baha'i writings explain that although God is infinite and boundless,
when He appears in the world of "creatures", He takes on a form and
limitation that is finite, restricted by whatever reveals Him. Like the rain,
which although formless, takes on the form and shape of the container
which it fills, God cannot be contained within the world of creation

> "God's grace is like the rain that cometh down from
> heaven: the water is not bounded by the limitations of
> form, yet on whatever place it poureth down, it taketh on
> limitations - dimensions, appearance, shape - according
> to the characteristics of that place. In a square pool, the
> water, previously unconfined, becometh a square; in a
> six-sided pool it becometh a hexagon... The rain itself
> hath no geometry, no limits, no form... In the same way,
> the Holy Essence of the Lord God is boundless,
> immeasurable, but His graces and splendours become
> finite in the creatures" 15

From the Baha'i point of view, whatever the mind of man may conceive
of as God, is by definition, not God.

3\.2 The Immanent God

The "One" underlying creation, hinted at in the Vedic period, in the
Upanishads, now unites man to the cosmos. The spirit that precedes and
sustains the physical cosmos is identified to be the same spirit which
dwells within the soul of man. Some of the most poetic statements about
man's unity to God in the world's sacred scriptures are to be found in the
Upanishads. The inner universe is likened to be as vast as the physical

(Chandogya Upanishad, 8.1).

In another passage, God's presence is stated to lie at the very centre of the
'human heart', "He is immeasurable in his light and beyond all thought,
and yet he shines smaller than the smallest. Far, far away is he, and yet he
is very near, resting in the inmost chamber of the heart". (Mundaka Upan.
3:1:7).

There are other passages in the Upanishads that suggest that of all the
signs of God's presence in the universe, the greatest is reflected in the
heart of man, "There is a light that shines beyond all things on earth,
beyond us all, beyond the heavens, beyond the highest, the very highest
heavens. This is the Light that shines in our heart". (Chandogya 3: 13:7).

There are similar sentiments in other Faiths. The notion of man being
created in God's image, a belief reiterated in the sacred scriptures of all
the Semitic religions, is expressive of man having a special connection to
God. In the New Testament, Christ states that, "The Kingdom of God is
within you" (Luke 17: 20). Also in the same scripture, it is said that,
"Surely you know that you are God's temple and that God's spirit lives in
you" (I Cor. 3:16). In the Quran, there is a verse which reads, "And We
know what his soul whispers within him, and we are nearer to him than
the jugular vein" (1:15), or another which states, "We will surely show
them Our signs in the world and within the world and within themselves"
(41: 53). Similarly, an old Islamic hadith states, "Dost thou reckon
thyself a puny mortal form, when within thee the universe is folded?" 16.

quoted by Baha'u'llah in The Seven Valleys and Four Valleys, p 34

But passages of this kind from the Semitic religions are relatively few in
number, and it is the transcendent conception of God which predominates.
In the Upanishads however, the Immanent conception of God plays a
much more central role. Take for instance the metaphor of the "City of
God" which appears in the bible as well as the Upanishads. In the Old
Testament, the City of God is used as a title to refer to a specific place,
that is, the City of Jerusalem (Ps. 87: 3, 48:1-8, 46: 4). It is mentioned
alongside Goďs Holy mountain, Zion (Ps 48: 1-2), and referred to as "the
sacred house of the Most High (Ps. 46:4)". The 'City of God' of the Old
Testament is described as a "fortress" which protects the Jewish people
from the other nations, and from which God rules over the world (Ps
48:3). It is also referred to as the "Temple of God", where the Jewish
people think of "God's constant love" (Ps 48: 9). In the New Testament,
the City of God is also mentioned as the City of Jerusalem, and also as the
prophesised New Jerusalem (Heb. 12: 22, Rev. 3:12). In the Christian
tradition, the famous St Augustin of Hippo wrote a book entitled "City of
God" in the early part of the 5th century AD, where he took it mainly to
refer to the Christian Faith.

In Hinduism, the "City of God" is never taken to refer to a physical place,
or a specific Faith. It refers to a universal inner spiritual condition, "He
who knows all and sees all, and whose glory the Universe shows, dwells
as the Spirit of the divine city of Brahman in the region of the human
heart." In fact in the Upanishads, the City of God is used as a metaphor
to convey the inherent nearness of God to man, but because men's
knowledge of themselves is superficial, they fail to see that inner city, "As
one not knowing that a golden treasure lies buried beneath his feet, may
walk over it again and again, yet never find it, so all beings live every
moment in the City of Brahman, yet never find him because of the veil of
illusion by which He is concealed. The Sage resides within the lotus of the
heart. Knowing this, consecrated to the Self, the sage enters daily that

n
holy sanctuary."

The sentiment expressed by this passage is neither dualist nor monist. It is
one element of a tripartite system where God forms the link that binds
man to the cosmos. The spirit of Brahman in man, Atman, is likened to

Quoted by Prabhavanda, in The Spiritual Heritage of India, p 72

be a bridge between time and Eternity, and only the experience of spiritual
enlightenment and pure actions can cross it,

> "There is a bridge between time and Eternity; and this
> bridge is Atman, the Spirit of man. Neither day nor night
> cross that bridge, nor old age, nor death nor sorrow. Evil
> or sin cannot cross that bridge, because the world of the
> Spirit is pure. This is why when this bridge has been

> wounded are healed, and the sick man becomes whole
> from his sickness. To one who goes over that bridge, the
> night becomes like day; because in the worlds of the
> Spirit there is a Light which is everlasting."

(Chandogya Upanishad 8.4.1)

This passage has obvious parallels to the words of Isaiah, which were
often repeated by Christ, where the act of having faith in God's message
gives "eyes to the blind", "ears to the deaf, "heals the sick", and gives
"life" to the "dead" (John 12: 40). It is also reminiscent of the words of
Isaiah when he states, "The sun shall be no more thy light by day, neither
for brightness shall the moon give light unto thee: but the Lord shall be
unto thee an everlasting light, and thy God thy glory" (Isaiah 60: 19).

In the Baha'i writings, the Immanent tradition, of God being reflected in
the heart of man is given special importance

> "O My Brother! A pure heart is as a mirror; cleanse it
> with the burnish of love and severance from all save
> God, that the true sun may shine within it and the eternal
> morning dawn. Then wilt thou clearly see the meaning
> of 'Neither doth My earth nor My heaven contain Me,
> but the heart of My faithful servant containeth Me.' And

Here, Baha'u'llah quotes examples of past Immanent traditions, where the
human heart is believed to contain a greater measure of God's signs than
'Earth' or 'Heaven'. In the above citation it is referred to as God's home.
In another passage, Baha'u'llah expands on the same theme in the
following way

> "Whatever is in the heavens and whatever is on the earth
> is a direct evidence of the revelation within it of the
> attributes and names of God, inasmuch as within every

This passage bears close resemblance to many passages in the
Upanishads which declare the Atman, the Self, the Spirit of Brahman, to
be the Light animating the world of creation, and imply that it is reflected
to a supreme degree in the heart of man.

> "The light of the Atman, the Spirit, is invisible,
> concealed in all beings. It is seen by the seers of the
> subtle, when their vision is keen, and is clear"

(Katha Upanishad, 3:12)

(Mundaka Upanishad II, 2: 9-10)

> "Even as the radiance of the Sun shines everywhere in

(Svetasvatara Upanishad, 5:4)

> "Even as a mirror of gold, covered by dust, when

(Svetasvatara Upanishad, 2: 14-16)

> "Brahman is seen in a pure soul as in a mirror clear and
> also in the Creator's heaven as clear as light"

(Katha Upanishad, 6: 5)

> "Who denies God, denies himself. Who affirms God,

> (Taittiriya Upanishad, 2: 6)

The Hindu Atman, or Spirit of Brahman, has parallels to the Holy Spirit
of Christianity. In the Baha'i writings, an explanation of the Christian
Trinity is given in terms of an analogy using the sun, its rays, and a
perfect mirror. God is likened to the sun, and the rays of the sun which
fall upon the earth and give it life, are likened to the Holy Spirit, and
Christ is represented by the perfect mirror20. As the above passages show,
both in the Hindu writings and the Baha'i writings, the presence of God in
man is likened to being an inner sun, a self-luminous eternal light. These
metaphors of light, are obviously in one way or another related to man
being an image of God, reflecting God's eternal light. On this point, there
is evident harmony between the Upanishads and the Semitic religions.

\[20\] 'Abdu'1-Bahá, Some Answered Questions, pp 113-5
24              THE SINGAPORE BAHÁÍ STUDIES REVIEW

How does Goďs light in man relate to the via negativa tradition, which
states that direct knowledge of God is impossible for man? The Baha'i
writings resolve this paradox by identifying knowledge of one's inmost
self to be the acme of the spiritual development possible for man, and
stating that this knowledge is quite different from direct knowledge of
God. From the Baha'i point of view, the qualities of God that we are
familiar with, the "All-Knowing", "the All-Powerful", the "Omniscient",
etc, have actually nothing to do with the world of God. Viewed in this
way, even the duty given to us to praise God, is actually for our own
benefit, for our own self-discovery and self-development.

> "Far, far from Thy glory be what mortal man can
> confirm of Thee, or attribute unto thee, or the praise
> with which he can glorify Thee! Whatever duty Thou

> grace unto them, that they may be enabled to ascend
> unto the station conferred upon their own inmost being,
> the station of the knowledge of their own selves." 21

The Immanent tradition, although containing many statements which
appear to make the inner self of man identical to God, from the Baha'i
perspective, do not actually refer to the world of God, but refer to signs of
God in the world of creation. Although we speak of the attributes of God
within us, they refer to the best in human nature and not anything which is
inherently about God. The Baha'i view is very clear on this point. After
describing the presence of God within man and giving examples of the
Immanent tradition, Baha'u'Uah clearly distinguishes between this
tradition and pantheism or anthropomorphism.

Here, the knowledge of God is related to His "Manifestations", or his
"Mirrors" in the world of creation. These Mirrors of God's light are
equated with the founders of religion, a Christ, a Moses, a Muhammad, a
Krishna, a Buddha etc. It is important to note that coming to a realisation
of one's identity with God is inextricably linked to becoming selfless, of
stripping away the "wrappings of illusion from off thine heart". In terms
of the mirror analogy often given in the Baha'i writings, polishing the
mirror of our hearts results in the greater reflection of the sun's (God's)

light. Abdu'l-Bahá states: "Souls are like unto mirrors, and the bounty of
God is like unto the sun. When the mirrors pass beyond all colouring and
attain purity and polish, and are confronted with the sun, they will reflect
in full perfection its light and glory" 2 3

\[22\] Baha'u'llah, Seven Valleys and Four Valleys, pp 18-25

\[23\] * Abdu'1-Bahá, Bahďí World Faith, p 367

Man's unity with God is attained by him becoming selfless, so that he can
better reflect the light of the eternal Self. But from the Baha'i point of
view, as with the Semitic religious tradition, the act of being selfless does
not bring man directly into contact with God, just as polishing a mirror
does not mean that the mirror somehow reaches the sun: in a polished
mirror we see a clearer image of the sun, but the mirror is still very
different from the sun. In the same way, a selfless life becomes one with
God's signs in the world of creation.

In the Upanishads, the situation is very similar to the Baha'i position. As
already quoted, the most common metaphor to express man's unity with
God is the light simile, where the light of Atman is reflected in the heart of
the sage: "Brahman is seen in a pure soul as in a mirror clear and also in
the Creator's heaven as clear as light" (Katha Upanishad, 6: 5)

Another metaphor mentioned in the Upanishads expressing the unity of
the sage to God is water dissolving into an ocean, "As rivers flowing into
the ocean find their final peace and their name and form disappear, even
so the wise become free from name and form and enter into the radiance
of the Supreme Spirit who is greater than all greatness. In truth who
knows God becomes God." (Mundaka Upanishad III, 2: 8-9). But even
here, there are traces of the light image, "enter into the radiance of the
Supreme Spirit". There are other passages which make it clear that even
if Brahman is envisaged as something in which all things flow, yet He is
"still the same", that He in some sense lies beyond them, "filled with
Brahman are the things we see; filled with Brahman are the things we see
not; from out of Brahman floweth all that is; from Brahman all - yet is he
still the same." 24. This passage refutes the common misconception that
Hinduism is pantheist.

In the Upanishads, the picture of God's presence in the universe is one of
unity in diversity. God's relationship to the universe is likened to the sun's
connection to the earth: the sun's light illumines the earth and is
responsible for the development of all the diverse forms of life on it. On
the other hand, the sun is independent of the earth, and is unaffected by it:

Peace Chant in the Upanishads of the White Yajur Veda, quoted by Prabhavananda
in The Spiritual Heritage of India, p 43

> "As fire, though one, takes new forms in all things that
> burn, the Spirit, though one, takes new forms in all
> things that live. He is within all, and is also outside. As
> the wind, though one, takes new forms in whatever it
> enters, the Spirit, though one, takes new forms in all
> things that live. He is within all, and is also outside. As
> the sun that beholds the world is untouched by earthly
> impurities, so the Spirit that is in all things is untouched
> by external sufferings. There is one Ruler, the Spirit that
> is in all things, who transforms his own form into many.
> Only the wise who see him in their souls attain the joy
> eternal."

(Katha Upanishad, 5: 9-12)

Within this image of unity in diversity, there is the key to resolving the
conflict between the dualist and monist schools of Hinduism, between the
Shankara. school of Advaita Vedanta and Ramanuja's school of qualified
dualism. The monist position holds that only God is the reality, and all
notions of human separateness is an illusion. This position seems to imply
that the human soul has no separate self-identity. In fact the goal of
human life is often expressed as eliminating self-identity, and declaring
that "I am God" 25. But in terms of the analogy just outlined, the monist
position need not be understood in this way.

The monist belief is equivalent to believing that only the sun is the
independent reality, the only self-luminous reality, and all else either
reflects the sun's light or in some way depends on it. Without the sun's
light, all the diverse forms of life on earth would perish. To state that God
is the only reality is perfectly consistent with the belief that life on earth is
separate from the sun, that God is independent of His creation, the dualist
position. All life on earth is sustained by a unitary source, the sun's light,
but the creatures which are to be found on it are not identical to the sun.
The dualist's position may be represented by the sun's independence from
whatever happens on the earth. Whatever man does, it does not affect the
sun, the sun is independent of the earth.

\[25\] Prabhavananda , The Spiritual Heritage of India, p 351
28              THE SINGAPORE BAHÁ1 STUDIES REVIEW

The monist insight is better stated in terms of being selfless, rather than
being identical to God. Differences on the earthly landscape are not due to
the light itself, which is one. In the Baha'i writings, the unity in diversity
theme is also expressed by the sun's relationship to the earth. The sun is
the unitary source which sustains the diversity of life inhabiting the earth,

"Consider the visible sun; although it shineth with one
> radiance upon all things, and at the behest of the King of
> Manifestation bestoweth light on all creation, yet in each
> place it becometh manifest and sheddeth its bounty
> according to the potentialities of that place. For

> place be shut away from the light, as by walls or a roof,
> it will be entirely bereft of the splendor of the light, nor
> will the sun shine thereon.... In sum, the differences in

> wayfarer gazeth only upon the place of appearance - that
> is, when he seeth only the many-colored globes - he

> darksome dust from limited souls hath hid the world.
> And some do gaze upon the effulgence of the light; and
> some have drunk of the wine of oneness and these see
> nothing but the sun itself... " 26

Baha'u'llah, The Seven Valleys, pp 18-21

This passage makes clearer the difference between the monist and dualist
approach. The monist approach focuses on the colourless formless light of
the sun, to "see nothing but the sun itself." In another passage Baha'u'llah
cites the following Islamic Hadith, "Knowledge is a single point, but the
ignorant have multiplied it" 27 . On the other hand, the dualist position
would be to emphasise the dependence of all living things on the light of
the sun, which is self-luminous, intrinsically different from the objects of
its illumination. All earthly objects only reflect and absorb the sun's light,
and to conceive of man being directly united with God is in the Baha'i
writings, likened to a "bird of clay" reaching the sun. Viewed in this way,
both the monist and dualist approaches are equally Valid and they do not
contradict one another.

According to the Upanishads, gaining an insight into the unity in diversity
of Goďs presence in the universe is the hallmark of spiritual
enlightenment, and the soul of the sage who comes to this realisation will
attain inner harmony:

> "Who sees the many and not the One, wanders on from
> death to death. Even by the mind this truth is to be
> learned: there are not many but only ONE. Who sees
> variety and not the unity wanders on from death to
> death. The soul dwells within us, a flame the size of a
> thumb. When it is known as the Lord of the past and the
> future, then ceases all fear: This in truth is That... As
> water raining on a mountain-ridge runs down the rocks
> on all sides, so the man who only sees variety of things
> runs after them on all sides. But as pure water raining on
> pure water becomes one and the same, so becomes, O
> Nachiketas, the soul of the sage who knows"

(Katha Upanishad, 4: 10-15)

Going beyond duality does not mean than man becomes directly united
with God, but that man becomes selfless, and in doing so, reflects to a
greater degree the eternal light of God's spirit in the world of creation:

Baha'u'llah, The Seven Valleys, pp 24-25

Knowledge of the 'Spirit' is in effect, knowledge of the Spirit's light in
our inner world, "I know the Spirit Supreme, radiant like the sun beyond
darkness" (Svetasvatara Upanishad, 3: 8).

Often, the Semitic religious traditions are type-cast as dualist, and the
Eastern traditions, such as Buddhism or the Advaita Vedanta school of
Hinduism are described as monist. In an effort to overcome this seeming
contradiction between religions, Momen proposes that the philosophy of
'Relativism', become a 'basis for Baha'i Metaphysics' 29. He argues,
quite persuasively, that the Baha'i approach to God is not an objective
one, since knowledge of God involves the process of self-discovery, God
will be approached in many different ways, and there will not be one way
which is superior to another. In terms of the above analogy given of the
sun shining on the earthly landscape: each object reflects and absorbs the
light of the sun according to its own inherent material type. Similarly,
each human being approaches God differently, in a way that best releases
his or her own spiritual potential. The Baha'i approach is not dogmatic
about conceptions of God, rather, it allows for a unity in diversity of
approaches, since ultimately, each person's concept of God depends on
his or her own distinctive spiritual path. The process of self-discovery is
irreducibly subjective and personal. This personal conception of God is
also quite characteristic of the Hindu approach.

But the step of describing God in the terms of a philosophy of relativism
is questionable. Philosophies based upon relativism have a lingering self-

\[28\] quoted by Prabhavanda, in The Spiritual Heritage of India, p 44

\[29\] Relativism: A Basis for Baha'i Metaphysics, by Moojan Momen, Studies in the
Babi and Baha'i Religions, vol. 5, pi85-217

defeat about them: if all world views are equally valid and
recommendable, then there is nothing to recommend the world view which
advocates relativism, as opposed say to an exclusivist world view. There
is also nothing in relativism that provides for unity. Conceptually, we are
unique, but there must be something universal about our spiritual
intuitions and experience, otherwise, there would be no basis upon \yhich
we could share them. What is missing is that apart from being subjective,
our experiences are also inter-subjective and trans-personal. For real
communication to be possible, objectivity underlies subjectivity, operating
as a higher principle.

Another way to express this is to speak of unity in diversity. At a
superficial level there is diversity, at a deeper level, there is unity. In
terms of the sun-landscape analogy, diversity of life is an integral
characteristic of the landscape. Likewise, variety is intrinsic to human
concepts about God. Each individual has his or her unique approach to
God, which is irreducibly subjective, irreducibly linked to his or her own
inner being. On the other hand, the light of the sun shines on all living
beings and is responsible for their development. In the same way,
individuals or religions may vary about how they describe God, but they
all believe God is somehow related to their spiritual growth.

All religious people believe in a purpose to life, rather than it being
meaningless. Even at a metaphysical level, there are common features to
religious world-views, as opposed to say a secular one. On a spiritual
level, the unity is more apparent. The spiritual light which is reflected in
the lives of all holy souls, from whatever tradition they come, is
remarkably similar.

4\. The Epics and the Bhagavad Gita

The period of the Epics is usually placed just after the Upanishads. The
two great stories which define this era, the Ramayana and the
Mahabharata, are an integral part of popular Indian culture. Both these
Epics are set in the form of legendary stories, where good eventually
defeats evil. In their heroic adventures involving gods and demons, many
important moral truths of Hinduism are cast in a form which is accessible

to all strata of society. Rama in the Ramayana Epic is comparable to
Moses of the Old Testament. Like Moses, Rama receives the calling of a
divine mission. Through divine assistance, he rescues his wife Sita from
King Ravana of Ceylon (Sri Lanka), defeats Ravana and his army, and
frees the people of Ceylon from Ravana's evil rule. This is similar to the
story of Moses, where with the help of divine interventions, Moses defeats
the evil Egyptian Pharaoh and succeeds in freeing the Jewish people. Both
stories are surrounded by myths and legends, and more importantly, both
stories contain moral truths about how man should follow God's
commandments, and respond to God's message.

Also appearing in the Epics period is the Bhagavad-Gita, or Song of God,
the most popular work in all the religious literature of India. It is often
referred to as the "Holy Bible of India" 30. Although this great document
is embedded in a book of the Mahabharata, it in many ways, stands
independent from it. The Bhagavad-Gita records the words of Krishna,
representing the Voice of God, who not only reiterates the truths of the
Vedas and Upanishads, but introduces new perspectives into the Hindu
worldview. These words are spoken to the warrior Arjuna in the midst of
a battle between Arjuna and his cousins. Arjuna had lost his composure
and was overwhelmed by the futility of the war, and Krishna's reassuring
words describe a much more fundamental battle, the inner battle of the
soul in its struggle to find peace, immortality and wisdom.

4\.1 The Incarnation of God

The period of the Epics is important for many different reasons. It is in
the Epics that the various incarnations of the god Vishnu are described.
Many of these incarnations date from the Vedic period, while others come
from the Epic period, when the god Vishnu rose into prominence. The
first three incarnations, Matsya (fish), Kurma (Tortoise) and Varaha
(boar) have a cosmic character, and stem from the Vedic hyms. The
fourth, Narashimha (man-lion), seems to belong to a later period, when
the worship of Vishnu became established. The fifth, Vamana (the dwarf),
whose strides save the earth seems to come from the Vedic period. The

see Prabhavanda, The Spiritual Heritage of India, p 95

sixth, seventh and eighth, Parasurama, Rama, the hero of the Ramayana,
and Krishna come at a later date.

Each human incarnation of Vishnu is known as an Avatar, and has
striking similarity to the incarnation of the Word of God as described in
Christianity. For this reason, the stories of Vishnu as Preserver,
incarnating himself whenever there is corruption in the world, is more
than of passing interest for people coming from the Semitic tradition.

God in the Old Testament is spoken about indirectly. The Hebrew
prophets presented themselves as inspired men who were charged with the
task of delivering God's message to His people. God communicated with
them in the form of visions and dreams, and they relayed His message to
the Jewish people. Occasionally God's presence is described in terms of a
"burning bush", or God is given the name of "I am".

But Jesus was more direct. He said, "he that have seen me hath seen the
Father" (John 14: 9), or "Believe me that I am in the Father, and the
Father in me" (John 14: 11). Moreover, to the Jews to whom Christ
spoke, he identified himself to be the only path to God, "I am the way, the
truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me. If ye had
known me, ye should have known my Father also: and from henceforth ye
know him, and have seen him " (John 14: 6,7). Encompassing all that
there is, Christ is reported to have said, "I am the Alpha and Omega, the
beginning and the end" (Revelation 21: 6). Christ as the Word of God, is
described as encompassing all the "letters" of creation.

For those who chose to believe in him, Christ promised them victory over
death, a state of being beyond all needs and desires, "Verily, verily, I say
unto you, he that believeth on me hath everlasting life. " (John 6: 47), or,
"I am the bread of life: he that cometh to me shall never hunger; and he
that believeth on me shall never thirst" (John 6: 35). As the Word of God,
Christ is described as immortal, beyond time, and creator of the universe,
"In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the
Word was God. The same was in the beginning with God. All things were
made by him; and without him was not anything made. In him was life;
and the life was the light of men. And the light shineth in darkness; and
the darkness comprehended it not... But as many as received him, to them

gave he power to become the sons of God, even to them that believe on his
name" (John 1: 1-12)

Christ's words as recorded in the New Testament, are remarkably similar
to the words of Lord Krishna in the Bhagavad-Gita. The unknown sages
declare their faith in Atman, the eternal inner principle at work in the
heart of all things, unifying all things with Brahman. It was through this
unity that they pointed to a state of immortality, of the victory of life over
death, of the attainment of eternal peace beyond the transient vagaries of
this world. They describe the Atman indirectly, primarily in terms of a
state of being which it inspires within their souls. Their declaration of
enlightenment is similar to the Old Testament prophets describing then-
visions and dreams, of going from "darkness to light", from "death to life"
(Isaiah 35: 5). There is an ambiguity, probably created through the long
distance of time which separates us from the authors of the Upanishads:
who or what is the Atman and how does it relate to a figure like Christ?

In the Bhagavad Gita, Krishna identifies himself both with Brahman and
Atman, carrying all the life-giving qualities that they impart. He declares,
"For those who take refuge in me and strive to be free from age and death,
they know Brahman, they know Atman, and they know what Karma is"
(Gita 7: 29), or "I am the soul, prince victorious, which dwells in the heart
of all things" (Gita 10: 20). Just like Christ when addressing his disciples,
Krishna presents himself to be the sum of the world of creation, the
beginning and the end, "All these things have their life in this Life, and I
am their beginning and end. In this whole universe there is nothing higher
than I. All worlds have their rest in me, as many pearls upon a string"
(Gita 7: 7-8), or "I am the beginning and the middle and the end of all
things; their seed of eternity, their Treasure Supreme" (Gita 9: 18).

Elsewhere Krishna describes himself as the Inner Light of the souls of
men, "In my mercy I dwell in their hearts and I dispel their darkness of
ignorance by the light of the lamp of wisdom" (Gita 10: 11. Like Christ,
Krishna promises victory over spiritual death, "For this is my word of
promise, that he who loves me shall not perish" (Gita 9: 31). Krishna
claimed to make the sinful sinless, "He who knows I am beginningless,
unborn, the Lord of all the worlds, this mortal is from delusion, and from
all evils he is free" (Gita 10: 3). In a way similar to the spiritual insight

> moarted by Christ, Krishna declared that only those who have spiritual
> . ht c a n See him, "See now the whole universe with all things that move
and move not, and whatever thy soul may yearn to see. See it all as One in
jne But thou never canst see me with these thy mortal eyes: I will give
thee divine sight. Behold my wonder and glory" (Gita 11: 7-8).

Krishna mentions various spiritual qualities, such as love for one's
enemies ( j u s t a s Christ does), or steadfastness in "honor or disgrace", but
it is the "faith and love" of the devotee which he values the most: "The
man whose love is the same for his enemies or his friends, whose soul is
the same in honour or disgrace, who is beyond heat or cold or pleasure or
pain, who is free from the chains of attachments; ... this man is dear to
me. But even dearer to me are those who have faith and love, and who
have as me as their End Supreme: those who hear my words of Truth, and
who come to the waters of Everlasting Life" (Gita 12: 18-20).

Krishna on several occasions makes it clear that he transcends the
worship of different gods, and the love devotees have for the gods is an
unconscious worship of him. According to Krishna, worship of the gods
alone, is not enough to attain immortality "Even those who in faith
worship other gods, because of their love they worship me, although not
in the right way. For I accept their sacrifice, and I am their Lord supreme.
But they know not my pure Being, and because of this they fall." (Gita 9:
23). Elsewhere, Arjuna addresses Krishna saying, "I have faith in all thy
words because these words are words of truth, and neither the gods in
heaven nor the demons in hell can grasp thy infinite vastness. Only the
Spirit knows thy Spirit: only thou knowest thyself. Source of Being in all
beings, God of gods, ruler of all" (Gita 14-15).

Although Krishna identifies himself with Brahman, he also makes a
distinction between himself and the Transcendent. Krishna describes
himself as the inner principle of the universe which men can approach, a
spiritual condition which lives in the souls of pure human beings, which is
distinct from the Transcendent. Krishna confirms the unknowable nature
°1 God, the via negativa of the Semitic traditions. He presents himself as
a med

iator between human beings and God, "Who have all the powers of
their soul in harmony, and the same loving mind for all; who find joy in
the good of all beings - they reach in truth my very self. Yet greater is the

toil of those whose minds are set on the Transcendent, for the path of the
Transcendent is hard for mortals to attain. But they for whom I am the
End Supreme, who surrender all their works to me, and who with pure
love meditate on me and adore me - these I very soon deliver from the
ocean of death and life-in-death, because they have set their heart on me.
Set heart on me alone and give to me thy understanding: thou shalt in
truth live in me hereafter" (Gita 12: 4-5).

Krishna in the Bhagavad Gita gives greater meaning to the Atman and
Brahman of the Upanishads. The Atman becomes the Spirit of God, the
eternal Self which is periodically incarnate in human form. The
Incarnation of God is also presented as the eternal inner Spirit, the inner
Sun that shines in the hearts of the pure, " those whose unwisdom is made
pure by the wisdom of their inner Spirit, their wisdom is unto them a sun
and in its radiance they see the Supreme" (Gita 5: 16). The authors of the
Upanishads wrote of their unity with Atman, but Krishna speaks of being
the Atman itself. The notion of the Incarnation of God as presented in the
Bhagavad Gita, is that it is a perfect reflection of God's presence in the
world of creation, a representation of God in a form which is accessible to
man. Krishna makes clear that the true Self hidden within the hearts of
men, is actually the Spirit of God, which periodically incarnates itself in
human form for the purpose of human salvation. This has obvious
parallels to the Word of God and the Holy Spirit in the Christian tradition.

It should also be noted that the theme of 'unity in diversity' is reiterated in
the Bhagavad Gita. Krishna states, "In any way that men love me in that
same way they find my love: for many are the paths of men, but they all in
the end come to me" (Gita 4: 11). To see the unity underlying creation is
an act of spiritual enlightenment, just as it is described in the Upanishads.
Krishna states, "When a man sees that the infinity of various beings is
abiding in the ONE, and is an evolution from the ONE, then he becomes
one with Brahman" (Gita 13: 30).

There is much in the Baha'i writings which correlates with the words of
Krishna and the concept of the Incarnation of God as it appears in the
Bhagavad Gita. In the Baha'i writings, the Incarnation of God is referred

to as the 'Manifestation of Goď 31 , or as the 'Primal Mirrors' 32 , or on
other occasions as the 'Perfect Man' 33. It has already been mentioned in
the context of the Baha'i approach to reconciling the Immanent and
Transcendent traditions. The concept of the Manifestation of God is an
integral part of understanding God, and in the Baha'i writings, it is stated
that all references to God that human beings ever make, actually refer to
the Manifestations of God, and not to God directly34.

The Manifestation of God from the Baha'i point of view, is likened to a
perfect stainless mirror which reflects the light of God, "God is pure
perfection, and creatures are but imperfections. For God to descend into
the conditions of existence would be the greatest of imperfections; on the
contrary, His manifestation, His appearance, His rising are like the
reflection of the sun in a clear, pure, polished mirror. All the creatures are
evident signs of God, like the earthly beings upon all of which the rays of
the sun shine. But upon the plains, the mountains, the trees and fruits,
only a portion of the light shines, through which they become visible, and
are reared, and attain to the object of their existence, while the Perfect
Man is in the condition of a clear mirror in which the Sun of Reality
becomes visible and manifest with all its qualities and perfections" 35 .
This passage expands on the sun-landscape analogy quoted earlier. The
Manifestation appears as a perfect stainless mirror on the landscape of
creation, and is the Perfect Man. All human beings reflect the image of
God, but the Perfect Man is as a spotless, clear mirror, which reflects the
Image of God perfectly. All other mirrors appear as dim reflections of the
perfect mirror. Just as all mirrors bear greater likeness to the perfect
mirror when cleaned of their dross and dust, so the Manifestation of God
represents the potential hidden in human nature: "the radiance of these

energies may be obscured by worldly desires even as the light of the sun
can be concealed beneath the dust and dross which cover the mirror"36.

True human potential, according to the Baha'f Faith, is unlocked by the
Manifestation of God. The Manifestation of God lies at the core of all
things, he is hidden in the inner reality of human beings, and is identical to
the Hindu concept of Atman. Baha'u'llah's words resemble the words of
Christ or Krishna when he states, "O My servants! could ye apprehend
with what wonders of My munificence and bounty I have willed to entrust
your souls, ye would, of a truth, rid yourselves of attachment to all
created things, and would gain a true knowledge of your own selves - a
knowledge which is the same as the comprehension of Mine own Being.
Ye would find yourselves independent of all else but Me, and would
perceive, with your inner and outer eye, and as manifest as the revelation
of My effulgent Name, the seas of My loving-kindness and bounty
moving within you" 37. Here, the Manifestation of God is identical to the
true Self, and the means by which human beings can realise their true
spiritual potential. In fact, BaháVUáh states that human beings can own
anything they desire, but the human heart is the sole province where he
must reign, "O Son of Dust, all that is in heaven and earth I have ordained
for thee, except the human heart, which I have made the habitation of My
beauty and glory..." 38

From the Baha'f point of view, knowledge of God is impossible. When we
praise God, or refer to God, we are not strictly speaking about God at all.
All references to God actually refer to two inseparable phenomena, our
true selves, and the Manifestations of God. Knowledge of God is
intrinsically related to the impact that the Manifestations have on our
inner being, their transforming effect of releasing human potential, and
their purifying effect on the mirrors of human hearts. The approach to
God in Hinduism is fundamentally the same as the Baha'f one. The
Upanishads present God as the true self, while the Bhagavad Gita largely
describes God in terms of an Incarnation of God (Manifestation). Both

\[37\] BaháVUáh, Gleanings from the Writings ofBaha'u'llah, pp 326-7

\[38\] BaháVUáh, Hidden Words, from the Persian, no. 27

also express the via negativa        approach,   that God is essentially
unknowable.

Taking a BaháT view of the Hindu tradition, the Upanishads and
Bhagavad Gita are complementary in their approach to God and must not
be separated from one another. This is particularly true for the
Upanishads, for the Bhagavad is more complete than the Upanishads, in
that it reiterates many truths already contained in the Upanishads, and
stresses the sacred dimension to self-knowledge. But if the Upanishads are
taken by themselves, it may appear that God is identical to one's true self
and that any human being can reach God by striving for inner unity and
self-knowledge. This would contradict God's unknowable nature. Due to
the long passage of time which separates us and the authors of the
Upanishads, it is difficult for us to know the root of their inspiration.
Their enlightenment may well have been rooted in previous Incarnations
of Vishnu, for which historical records have been lost. The Hindu concept
of God is better understood by taking into account both the Upanishads
and the Bhagavad Gita together, and if this is done, its fundamental
agreement with the Baha'f approach to God and the God of the Semitic
line of religions becomes clearer.

4\.2 Progressive Revelation

There is another aspect of the Hindu Avatar which finds unity with the
Semitic line of religions and the Baha'f Faith. This is in the concept of the
Incarnation of Vishnu being a periodic event through human history,
Krishna states, "When righteousness is weak and faints and
unrighteousness exults in pride, then my Spirit arises on earth. For the
salvation of those who are good, for the destruction of evil in men, for the
fulfilment of the kingdom of righteousness, I come to this world in the
ages that pass. He who knows my birth as God and who knows my
sacrifice, when he leaves his mortal body, goes no more from death to
death, for he in truth comes to me." (Gita 4: 7-9).

This passage has many similarities to the Baha'f principle of progressive
revelation and to the continuous line of revelation in the Semitic
revelation. In the Quran it is written, "To every people was sent an

Apostle; when their Apostle comes before them, that matter will be judged
between them with justice, and they will not be wronged" (Quran 10: 47).
Also in the New Testament it is written, "God, who at sundry times and in
divers manners spake in time past unto the fathers by the prophets, hath in
these last days spoken unto us by his Son, whom he hath appointed heir of
all things, by whom also he made the worlds" (Hebrews 1: 1-2).

In the Baha'i writings it is stated, "In the Kingdoms of earth and heaven
there must needs be manifested a Being, an Essence Who shall act as a
Manifestation and Vehicle for the transmission of the grace of the
Divinity Itself, the Sovereign Lord of all. Through the Teachings of this
Day Star of Truth every man will advance and develop until he attaineth
the station at which he can manifest all the potential forces with which his
inmost true self hath been endowed. It is for this very purpose that in
every age and dispensation the Prophets of God and His chosen Ones
have appeared amongst men, and have evinced such power as is bom of
God and such might as only the Eternal can reveal" 39.

The Baha'i principle of progressive revelation generalises the concept of
the Avatar to be a phenomenon which has occurred within every major
spiritual tradition of the world. In the Semitic line of religions, Avatars
are referred to as prophets, but from the Baha'i perspective, the terms
Avatar or Prophet refer to the same phenomenon.

Within the spiritual heritage of India, it is generally agreed amongst
Hindus that there have been nine Avatars so far. The first eight have
already been mentioned, Rama being the seventh and Krishna being the
eighth. Many Hindus have come to accept Buddha as the ninth Avatar.
The 9th century AD Hindu revival due to Shankara, from which the
Advaita Vedanta school arose, was very much linked to the influence of
Buddhism on Hinduism. Many of the characteristic Vedanta themes, such
as going beyond dualism to monism, although implicitly there in Hindu
scriptures, were given a new lease of life through the teachings of the
Buddha. The tenth Avatar, the Kalki Avatar, is usually cited by Hindus to
be the future Avatar to come. Hindus should therefore be open to
investigating Baha'uTlah's claim to be the fulfilment of all the world's

\[39\] BaháVlláh, Gleanings from the Writings ofBaha'u'llah, p 67

spiritual traditions, which in Hinduism, translates to being the Kalki
Avatar 40 .

Hinduism has also been influenced by the Semitic religions. From the
15th to 17th centuries AD, the impact of Islam in northern India inspired
the rise of Sikhism. More recently, the 19th century Ramakrishna Mission
derived much of its impetus from the interaction of the Hindu tradition
with Christianity.

5\. Unity in Diversity

As with the Semitic religions, Hinduism employs many symbols to convey
its spiritual message. The citations from the Upanishads and Bhagavad
Gita already quoted show that the Hindu concept of God's unknowable
nature is in complete agreement with the descriptions of God in the
Semitic line of religions. No symbol can adequately capture the nature of
God, no form can represent the formless. The best approach to
understanding God is to state what God is not, 'Not this, Not that'
(Brhadaranyaka Upanishad 4: 5: 15) - the via negativa. The symbols that
describe God, are actually descriptions of human spirituality, a reflection
of ourselves, and do not directly relate to God. Because the concept of
God is irreducibly subjective, that is, it involves us discovering our true
selves, unlocking our true potential, there will be as many descriptions of
God as there are people - and they are all equally wrong, and equally
correct. This principle is well recognised within the spiritual tradition of
India41.

There will also inevitably be a cultural dimension to this kind of
metaphysical relativism. In general, God is described in the Semitic line of
religions with many metaphors which derive from the act of speaking,
such as the "breath of the Holy Spirit", or the "Word of God", "Alpha
and Omega of creation" and so on. In the stories of the Old Testament,
God speaks to his people, and it is His Voice, His holy command that is
His identifying mark. These portrayals of God are of course, inevitably

\[40\] Shoghi Effendi, God Passes By, p 95

\[41\] Prabhananda, The Spiritual Heritage of India, pp 34-5
42            THE SINGAPORE BAHÁ1 STUDIES REVIEW

anthropomorphic, giving a human form to the formless. God is described
by many attributes, such as wisdom, knowledge, justice and is given many
titles like the Creator, Fashioner, or Provider. In Islam, these attributes of
God are called Names of God (Quran 20: 8). The Names of God are also
frequently mentioned in the BaháT writings.

Similar representations of God also exist within Hinduism. The god
Ganesha symbolises the holy word OM. In general, different deities
personify different names and attributes of God. One of the designations
of Shiva is that of Destroyer, and together with his consort Kali, they
make up something comparable to the Wrath of God in the Old
Testament. Another personification of Shiva's consort is Shakti, whose
name literally means "energy", and her action in the world is something
akin to how the "Breath" of the Christian "Holy Spirit" animates and
sustains the world. The god Brahman has the function of being Creator,
while his consort Saraswati symbolises Knowledge. Vishnu most
popularly portrays God as the Preserver, while his consort Lakshmi,
symbolises Wealth. The gods and goddesses symbolise the names and
attributes of the Brahman of the Upanishads and Bhagavad Gita. From
this perspective, the description of a god having a consort or a family, is
only a figurative expression, and should not be taken literally.

There may be some Hindus who emphasise the literal meaning of the
symbols, and who conceive of the many gods of Hinduism as having a
reality of their own. But by the same token, many religious people of the
Semitic religious tradition are also literal about their symbols of God.
This does not invalidate the spiritual meaning behind the symbol.

There is also another dimension to the symbols of God in Hinduism. In
general, the Hindu representation of God's attributes is more visual than
in the Semitic line of religions. The dark skin of Shiva, the snake around
his neck, the tiger skin as his cape, symbolise his power of destruction.
His third eye denotes inner vision. Often Shiva is depicted as a dancer,
where one of his four hands beats a drum, sounding out the rhythm of
creation. The dark blue colour of Vishnu symbolises infinite space. He
stands in an upright pose, in a pillar-like stance, depicting his role of
sustainer of the worlds. In his four hands, the conch shell stands for
Vishnu as the origin of the universe, the discus represents the cosmic

mind, the mace symbolises renovation, and the lotus denotes purity in the
midst of evil. The bended trunk of the elephant-headed Lord Ganesha,
symbolises his ability to remove obstacles. He is worshipped at the
beginning of any endeavour. These visual forms have many levels of
different meanings and vary from region to region, and are spiritual
symbols to the enlightened Hindu. They represent the formless Brahman
in forms which the human mind can conceive, and are rather like the
names and attributes of the unitary invisible Godhead of the Semitic
religions.

The personal character of Hindu religious symbols means that in
comparison to the Semitic religions, it is less theological, less canonical
about its beliefs. Hindus are much more autonomous in their religious
practice, much more concerned about verifying spiritual truths through
their own personal experience, than formulating a common creed or
engaging in theology. That this freedom is generally shared by most
Hindus is reflected in the Doctrine of Chosen Deity 42, the widely
practised principle that each Hindu is free to worship whichever god he or
she wishes. In fact, it is not uncommon for Hindus to include Muslim and
Christian prayers in their liturgy.

The call for unity in Hinduism is an ancient one, and has been periodically
reiterated throughout its long History. In the Rig Veda, it is said that the
"wise speak of what is ONE in many ways" (Rig Veda I: 164: 46), The
Katha Upanishads state that, "there are not many but only ONE. Who
sees variety and not unity wanders from death to death" (Katha
Upanishad Part 4: 10). In the Bhagavad Gita, Krishna declares that, "In
any way that men love me in that same way they find my love: for many
are the paths of men, but they all in the end come to me" (Gita 4: 11). The
search for unity is embedded deep into the psyche of Hinduism.

It is not surprising that modern Hindu movements have made unity their
chief goal. Take for instance, the Ramakrishna movement, founded on the
teachings of the 19th century sage Ramakrishna. The core teaching of the
Ramakrishna movement is that all religions are one. In the words of
Ramakrishna, "So many religions, so many paths to reach the same

\[42\] see J.P.Suda, Religions in India, a Study in their Essential Unity, p 50

goal... I have found that it is the same God towards whom all are directing
their steps, though along different paths" 43. On another occasion
Ramakrishna likens the different religions in the world to the different
names that each culture gives to water, although the names sound
different, they refer to the same liquid, "The tank has several ghats. At
one Hindus draw water and Calf it jaly at another Mohammedans draw
water and call it pani\ at a third Christians draw the same liquid and call
it water. The substance is one though the name differs, and everyone is
seeking the same thing. Every religion of the world is one such ghat. Go
with a sincere and earnest heart by any of these ghats and you will reach
the water of eternal bliss. But do not say that your religion is better than
that of another"44.

These words are very similar to the message of religious unity as
expressed in the Baha'i writings. 'Abdu'1-Bahá for instance, describes
religious unity in the following way, "Light is good in whatsoever lamp it
is burning! A rose is beautiful in whatsoever garden it may bloom! A star
has the same radiance if it shines from the East or from the West. Be free
from prejudice, so- you will love the Sun of Truth from whatsoever point
in the horizon it may arise! You will realize that if the Divine light of truth
shone in Jesus Christ it also shone in Moses and in Buddha. The earnest
seeker will arrive at this truth. This js what is meant by the Search after
Truth" 45.

Ramakrishna's teachings were developed and spread by his disciple
Vivekananda. Just before the turn of this century, Vivekananda toured the
West, and is responsible for greatly increasing knowledge about Hinduism
there. In most of his Western talks, Vivekananda promoted the goal of
religious unity and the principle of unity in diversity. In his address at the
World's Parliament of Religions congress, in Chicago on 11th September
1893, Vivekananda stated that, "Unity in variety is the plan of nature, and
the Hindu has recognised it"46. He went on to describe religious u/nty by

paraphrasing the words of Krishna, "It is the same light coming through
different colours. And these little variations are necessary for the purposes
of adaptation. But in the heart of everything the same truth reigns. The
Lord has declared to the Hindu in His incarnation as Krishna, "I am in
every religion as the thread through a string of pearls. Wherever thou
seest extraordinary holiness and extraordinary power raising and
purifying humanity, know that I am there".. ,."47. Krishna in the Bhagavad
Gita states, "In the whole vast universe there is nothing higher than I. All
the worlds have their rest in me, as many pearls upon a string" (Gita 7:7).
Clearly Vivekananda draws the natural conclusion implied in Krishna's
words that the thread which unites together all things in the universe, must
also bind together different religious revelations.

The title of Vivekananda's talk delivered in London on 3rd November
1896 was 'Unity in Diversity'48. This is significant from the Baha'i
perspective, since Shoghi Effendi in 1931 wrote that the "watchword" of
the Baha'i Faith was "unity in diversity"49. It would appear that 'unity in
diversity' is the touchstone principle of both the Baha'i Faith and
Hinduism.

Another interesting feature of the Ramakrishna-Vivekananda school of
Hinduism is that it sees revelation as a never-ending continuous process,
with no beginning, without end. This gives rise to an openness towards all
spiritual traditions, which today, is rarely associated with religion.
Vivekananda states that, "I accept all religions that were in the past, and
worship with them all; I worship God with every one of them, in whatever
form they worship Him. I shall go to the mosque of the Mohammedan; I
shall enter the Christian's church and kneel before the crucifix; I shall
enter the Buddhistic temple, where I shall take refuge in Buddha and in

continuous revelation, going on? It is a marvellous book - these spiritual
revelations of the world. The Bible, the Vedas, the Koran, and all other
scared books are but so-many pages, and an infinite number of pages
remain yet to be unfolded. I would leave it open for all of them. We stand
in the present, but open ourselves to the infinite future. We take in all that
has been in the past, enjoy the light of the present, and open every window
of the heart for all that will come in the future"50. These words echo the
following words of Baha'u'llah, "This is the changeless Faith of God,
eternal in the past, eternal in the future"51, or "consort with all religions
with amity and concord"52. Both the Baha'i Faith and Hinduism
understand revelation to he a universal dynamic phenomenon, which
means that they share a spirit of openness towards accepting other
spiritual traditions.

Hinduism is increasingly being offered as a possible model for religious
unity by both Hindus and non-Hindus53. The relatively peaceful
coexistence over many centuries amongst different religious communities
on the Indian subcontinent is often traced to the Hindu concept of unity in
diversity. This is in contrast to many other places in the world, where
fanaticism and dogmatism are fuelled by religious ideologies based upon
superiority or exclusion. At the end of his book on the Spiritual Heritage
of India, the writer Swami Prabhananda concludes his survey of Indian
spiritual history by suggesting that Hinduism may well play a future role
in bringing together the world's spiritual traditions:

"It is perhaps natural in closing this book to emphasize

Since the unity of the world's religious traditions is precisely one of the
central goals of the Baha'i Faith, the Hindu experience and its present day
concerns is more than of passing interest to Baha'is. The Hindu sacred
scriptures do not however, make many references to religious traditions
outside the Indian subcontinent. By making use of the Baha'i writings, the
Hindu search for unity would be significantly widened. On the other hand,
for Baha'is, in their effort at "restating the fundamentals" of each Faith,
to "reconcile their aims", to "reinvigorate their life", to "demonstrate their
oneness", to "restore the pristine purity of their teachings" and to "assist
in the realization of their highest aspirations" 55, they will find a kindred
spirit within Hinduism.
