M essengers of God in North A merica Revisited: 1
An Exegesis of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s Tablet to Amír Khán2

Eugene, Donald Francis Addison, Ph.D.
Pittsburgh, Christopher Buck, Ph.D., J.D.

A bstract
The following paper is cast in the form of a conversation between two Bahá’í
scholars, Dr. Donald Francis Addison and Dr. Christopher Buck, in an emic/etic

Dedicated to the memory of Dr. Pauline Tuttle (d. 2007), of partly East Coast Mi’kmaq as well as of
African, Irish, and British ancestry and, by marriage, of “the People of the Salmon” — that is, of Stö:ló, Ditidaht,
and Cowichan heritage. She was Adjunct Professor of Ethnomusicology, University of Victoria School of Music,
author of The Hoop of Many Hoops: The Integration of Lakota Ancestral Knowledge and Bahá’í Teachings in the
Performative Practices of Kevin Locke (Ph.D. dissertation, University of Washington, 2002) and other works,
having dedicated her life and career to Native cultures and Bahá’í enlightenment. See also Pauline Tuttle, “Beyond
Feather and Beads: Interlocking Narratives in the Music and Dance of Tokeya Inajin (Kevin Locke).” Selling the
Indian: Commercializing and Appropriating American Indian Cultures. Edited by Diana Royer and Meyer Carter
Jones (Phoenix: University of Arizona Press, 2001). Formerly, Dr. Tuttle was also an instructor at Malaspina
University-College (in Nanaimo, British Columbia), Maxwell International Bahá’í School (at Shawnigan Lake,
British Columbia), and the University of Washington (Seattle). She also, among other things, helped to establish
and coordinate the Tawacin Waste Win Indigenous Studies Special Interest Group of the Association for Bahá’í
Studies.

Dedicated also to the memory of the late Dr. David S. Ruhe (1914–2005), former member of the
Universal House of Justice, the international governing council of the Bahá’í Faith. Elected to the National
Spiritual Assembly of the Bahá’ís of the United States in 1959, Dr. Ruhe served as its secretary from 1963 until
1968, when he was elected to the Universal House of Justice. His service on the democratically-elected Universal
House of Justice extended for five terms of five years each until 1993. Medical doctor, accomplished film-maker,
painter, and author, Dr. Ruhe produced scores of medical films, winning the Golden Reel Award (1957), the first
Golden Raster award (1967), the Venice Film Festival award, and the Royal Photographic Society of Great Britain
award for his productions, eventually leading to his appointment as Director of the Medical Film Institute for the
Association of American Medical Colleges. Prior to his passing in 2005, Dr. Ruhe was planning to produce a film
documentary on Native Americans and the Bahá’í Faith. He personally believed that the Iroquois culture-hero,
Deganawidah, was “an astonishing Prophet of Peace” (idem, “A New Evolution: Religious Bonding for World
Unity,” Journal of Bahá’í Studies 6.4 (1994-1995): 45–57 [45]), and that the time was ripe for the Bahá’í Faith to
formally establish the “category” of Native Messengers of God “at the least” and to recognize “Deganawida as
indigenous Prophet at the most” — and that such would be “a great service” to the Bahá’í Faith’s outreach to
indigenous peoples. (See Appendix Three, infra.)

The question of whether Bahá’í doctrine can accept, in principle, the existence of “Messengers of God
to First Nations” — on a par with those “Manifestations of God” that the Bahá’í Faith already recognizes — was
first addressed by Buck in 1996. In this 2007 joint venture by Buck and Addison, this question is “revisited.” This
time, the centerpiece of the discussion is ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s Tablet to Amír Khán which, in part, declares:
“Undoubtedly in those regions [America] the Call of God must have been raised in ancient times, but it hath been
forgotten now.” By way of disclaimer, the authors admit that this text is susceptible of multiple interpretations,
both for and against the existence of Native Messengers.

As a “spectrum hypothesis,” both maximalist and minimalist readings confirm and uphold the divine
inspiration of indigenous spiritual traditions. Maxi malist reading: Great Manifestations of God appeared among
the Native Americans and raised directly the Call of God, Their teachings being to some extent forgotten, but
Their influence not lost, and restored through Bahá’u’lláh. Mini malist reading: The Call of God, proclaimed in the
East by the Manifestations of God, was raised among Native Americans through their seers, sages, and holy men,
who were inspired by God to impart the light of His teachings unto their people. Both readings sacralise and
legitimize Native tradition, and furnish bridges for the cultural appropriation of the Bahá’í Faith into Native
spiritual idioms. Both readings delegitimize and undermine colonialist approaches to Native spirituality that place
before Native converts an “either/or” choice between their Native traditions and the Bahá’í Faith. In the following
paper, Buck and Addison present a maxi malist reading as an alternative to the mini malist reading that seems to
prevail in current Bahá’í thinking. The reader is free to agree or disagree with this maxi malist reading of the Tablet
to Amír Khán.

Let the reader bear in mind that Buck and Addison are proposing a formal recognition of the
“principle” of “Messengers of God to First Nations” and not necessarily the “principals” by name (that is, any
purported Native Messengers of God such as Deganawidah and White Buffalo Calf Woman) except insofar as to
accord Them recognition and respect, as one important and highly symbolic dimension of the Bahá’í-Native
encounter.

(insider/outsider) collaboration that offers a complement of Native/non-Native
perspectives. Their work takes the form of an experimental alternative to traditional
models of academic discourse — one called “conversive relationality,”3 broadly
defined as follows: “A conversive model of communication and
scholarship…firmly rooted within the sacred, emphasizing relationality,
intersubjectivity,   and      collaboration…[to]    reinform      and      transform
academic…writing and scholarship.”4
The exchange between Dr. Addison5 and Dr. Buck6 addresses the critical need to
fully transform intercultural interactions between Native American/Native
Canadian and mainstream Bahá’í communities, and that this process can renewed
through a formal recognition, on the part of the Bahá’ís, of the value and
authenticity of Native American spirituality. One way that this can be achieved
symbolically is through acknowledging that, in principle, the indigenous peoples of
the Americas have their own claim to wisdom traditions, and that these traditions
derive from “Messengers of God to First Nations.” This principle is anchored,
Buck and Addison argue, in the Tablet to Amír Khán Áhan. And while Bahá’ís
cannot officially add names of individuals who might otherwise qualify as
“Manifestations of God,” they can certainly “recognize” the fact that sacred Indian
tradition has. This new rapprochement, if successfully undertaken, will signalize

and Decentering the Self.” Journal of Bahá’í Studies 1995, 7(2), 1–28.

An elder in the Choctaw community, Dr. Donald Addison has a Ph.D. in Ethnomusicology. He
currently teaches Native American Music and African Music courses for both undergraduate and graduate students
at the University of Oregon on a part-time basis, having proposed and designed these courses for adoption in the
curriculum. He is also instructor of Ethnic Studies and Anthropology at Lane Community College in Eugene,
Oregon, and teaches at Chemeketa Community College in Salem, Oregon, as well. Dr. Addison is currently
earning his second Ph.D. in the Department of Linguistics at the University of Oregon. For the “Wisdom of the
Elders Radio Programs” Series Three (funded in part by the National Endowment for the Humanities, the National
Endowment for the Arts, the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, the Lewis and Clark National Historic Trail, the
Oregon Arts Commission, and Spirit Mountain Community Fund, Grand Ronde, Oregon), Dr. Addison hosts
“Speaking Native” in the eight, one-hour public radio programs on Native languages of the Lewis and Clark Trail.
The “Tribal Rhythms” segments — which introduce Native music through interviews with Native American
musicians who share the history and background of the traditional music and dance of featured tribes — is
likewise scripted by Dr. Addison. As a team member in the “Wisdom of the Elders Curriculum Project,” Dr.
Addison is helping to develop multimedia American Indian curriculum materials for schools in collaboration with
the State of Oregon Department of Education’s Indian Education office and other agencies. (See also Donald

the intercultural parity and equality that is needed before the indigenous peoples of
the Americas can find inspiration and empowerment in what has been
characterized as the sole “specific racial prophecy in all of the Bahá’í scriptures,”7
which is this: “Attach great importance to the indigenous population of America.
For … there can be no doubt that they will become so illumined as to enlighten the
whole world.”8

[now] speak a little Chahta [Choctaw]. Are you well?”). Don, I just
downloaded a 2005 Master’s thesis on Aboriginal-Bahá’í relations in British
Columbia. I was quite surprised by the author’s findings, and was
wondering if you could help me understand? In her thesis, “As ye have faith
so shall your powers and blessings be”: The Abor iginal –Bahá’í Encounter
in British Columbia , Chelsea Dawn Horton — who is now a Ph.D.
candidate at the University of British Columbia — has chronicled the
notable growth of the Bahá’í religion in western Canada.9 In an online
interview, Horton attributes the initial successes of the Bahá’í outreach to
indigenous communities to the Bahá’í tradition of “legitimizing, honouring
and validating native spiritual prophecies and practices.”10 Notwithstanding
the promising overtures and high hopes, however, Horton concludes:
“Relatively few of the over nine hundred Aboriginal people who enrolled in
the Bahá’í Faith [in British Columbia] between 1948 and 1992 ultimately
became active adherents…”.11 And further: “Despite such empowering
impact, however, patterns of non-Aboriginal cultural dominance
encountered within the Bahá’í community simultaneously suggest the
pervasiveness of the colonial legacy and the potency of contemporary social
context; good intentions proved insufficient to fully transform intercultural
interactions.”12 In your experience, has Horton identified a real problem
here? Ak akostinincho. (”I don’t understand.”)

[A D D ISO N] Yes, this is a very real problem — one that has not been
sufficiently recognized in the Bahá’í community. This is a perfect, although
sobering, example of some of the contributions that scholarship can bring in
terms of cross-cultural awareness. But first, let’s review the history of the
“Aboriginal-Bahá’í encounter,” as Horton terms it. What reasons explain the
growth of the Bahá’í Faith among Native Americans? Why do indigenous
Bahá’ís find such ready acceptance of their peoples and traditional cultures
among Bahá’ís of other cultures and ethnic groups? Why has the Bahá’í
Faith steadily grown among Native peoples from its earliest Native converts

dating back only approximately seven to eight decades? And what
characterizes the informal and formal recognition of Native American
traditional prophets — which has such enormous symbolic significance for
many Native peoples — by adherents and institutions of the Bahá’í Faith?

Like Ms. Horton, I have conducted my own research on these matters for a
number of years. Research at the community level for this study stems from
individual interviews I have carried out with both Native and non-Native
peoples — both Bahá’í and non-Bahá’í — over approximately 40 years in
both the U.S. and Canada. Such a study poses interesting questions for
students of the social sciences and the history of religion. Ever increasing
numbers of Native peoples are also watching the mounting instances of
Native community involvement in the Bahá’í Faith. Unlike the spread of
Christianity within Indian country, the Bahá’í Faith has never been
associated with a fortification of colonial occupation, Euro-American
assimilation, or forced conversions of Native Americans.13

[B U C K ] Yes, that’s quite true. In fact, one notable Bahá’í figure has, in
fact, apologized for the devastation that colonialism has visited upon Native
peoples. In a joint letter addressed to the National Spiritual Assemblies of
the Bahá’ís of Canada and the United States, Rúhíyyih Khánum (wife of
Shoghi Effendi, Guardian of the Bahá’í Faith from 1921–1957) expressed
some of her concerns following her trip throughout Canada and the United
States in the spring of 1960:

> Bahá’u’lláh warned us against the evils of civilization when carried
> to extremes, the Master and particularly the Guardian, elaborated on
> this theme until at the end of his life. Shoghi Effendi fairly thundered
against our civilization — particularly the American variety of it…

I remember when we had the first Japanese pilgrim here,
> Shoghi Effendi said to him that the majority of the human race was
> not white and that the majority of Bahá’ís would not be white in the
> future. As up until very recently the Bahá’ís of the world were almost
> exclusively white it is only natural that their virtues and their faults
> should have colored the Faith and its community life. It is illogical to
> suppose that what we have now is either mature or right; it is a phase
> in the development of the Cause; when peoples of different races are
> incorporated in the world-wide community (and in local
> communities) who can doubt that it will possess far greater power
> and perfection and be something quite different from what we have
> now?…

While my purpose is not to criticize religions or missionaries of any denomination, clarification must
be made here. In my many years of college teaching, I am often amazed at how little of the accurate record of the
Christian conversions of Indians is either known, understood, or even acknowledged. For example: “Beginning in
1644, Puritans took over Indian communities…which meant that Indians were forced to dress and follow Puritan
proprieties and profess Christianity, or else be flogged.” Alice B. Kehoe, North American Indians: A
Comprehensive Account (Upper Saddle River, NJ: Pearson Prentice Hall, 1981 [3d edn., 2006]), 234.

Bahá’u’lláh said the black people are like the pupil of the eye

I am convinced that if we start mass conversion of the Indians
and Negroes, mass conversions of the whites will follow…

I could see the American Indians straighten their shoulders

These words of Rúhíyyih Khánum are quite powerful and give pause for
thought! From these statements, we can see that the colonial legacy has not
only wreaked havoc in “Indian Country” but has greatly conditioned the
colonizers as well, with the lingering effects visible in the subtle, perhaps
unconscious attitudes of many, if not most of the Bahá’ís within the
dominant culture of North America. Yet the fact that Rúhíyyih Khánum was
moved to express a formal apology to American Indians for what her race
had done to them is extraordinary. This represents a clearly decolonizing
attitude and goes far in explaining how and why Bahá’ís have, despite their
cultural conditioning and other limitations, succeeded in crossing racial
divides to widen the embrace of the Bahá’í community to include significant
numbers of African Americans and Native Americans alike.

[A D D ISO N] Yes, I’m glad that you cited this extraordinary letter that
Rúhíyyih Khánum was moved to write. Looking back historically, we can
see that the early successes experienced by Bahá’ís in their outreach to
Native Americans did not go unnoticed by non-Bahá’í observers. Some of
the earliest helpful references to Native Americans and the Bahá’í Faith date
back to the 1960s. Anthropologist Alice B. Kehoe encountered the Bahá’í
Faith among aboriginal peoples and documented this in a pamphlet
published in March, 1963, by the Saskatchewan Museum of Natural History
in Regina.15 In Saskatchewan Indian Religious Beliefs, she describes the
influence of traditional Native religions, Christian beliefs, and other

movements such as the Native American Church. Not to be confused with
some type of eclectic movement, the Bahá’í Faith, she notes, is considered
by its members to be a universal faith, not tied to any one particular culture,
religious background, language, or even country of origin. She adds that it
“does not deny the validity of native Indian beliefs, [and the Bahá’í

Hand of the Cause of God ‘Amatu’l-Bahá Rúhíyyih Khánum, joint letter 1961 dated to the National
Spiritual Assembly of the Bahá’ís of the United States and the National Spiritual Assembly of the Bahá’ís of
Canada (emphasis added).

The Native American Church is also known as the Peyote religion, a cultural hybrid, representing a
synthesis of traditional Indian beliefs and ritual with Christian dogma and symbolism.

Faith]…appeals to many Indians who are seeking a religion that is neither

exclusively Indian nor dominated by white values and customs.”

Similarly, in the 39th Annual Report of the Board of Evangelism and Social
Service of the United Church of Canada, 1964, William Wuttunee, Chief of
the National Indian Council in Calgary, Alberta, writes of the success of the
Bahá’ís. He states, in part, that they “are moving along quite quickly. They
only started a few years ago and yet one-third of their people [one-third of
the whole Bahá’í population of Canada] are Indians. I think they are

converting practically whole Indian Reserves which hitherto had been
Catholic or some other denomination. Why is it that they are making such
headway? Because their attitude is different. Their attitude is this: Your
religion [Native spirituality] is correct, the way you worship the great Spirit
[Creator or God] is right. You should worship Him that way. But in addition
we [the Bahá’ís] have something new to offer you. We have a new Prophet
for this era. They are increasing the faith of the Indians, not detracting or
replacing [it]. They accept Indians whole-heartedly…and Indians take an
equal part [in Bahá’í activities and administrative institutions].”19 Not only
Native writers but some non-Native anthropologists (and other non-Bahá’í
sources) have documented the all-embracing manner in which Bahá’ís view
indigenous peoples and cultures. Such accommodation is not, as some
observers may be tempted to infer, tantamount to syncretism. It is better
analyzed as a practical application of a Bahá’í universalism, that all
religious truth — insofar as it is truth — proceeds from one source.

[B U C K ] This is all very interesting. Please understand that I’m not trying to
be dismissive of these fine beginnings. Yet the consolidation of Native
Canadian Bahá’ís was lacking, and currently it seems that much of that
initial work has been undone. As Chelsea Horton observes:

> In the latter half of the twentieth century, however, the Bahá’í
> community of Canada set about realizing a specific racial prophecy
> concerning the Aboriginal inhabitants of North America revealed in
> 1916 by then-leader of the Faith, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá. Sensing, by mid-
> century, that the Canadian Bahá’í community was sufficiently
> established to undertake concerted teaching efforts, the international
> and national Bahá’í administrations launched calls for a variety of
> teaching programs within Aboriginal communities that resulted in
> over fifty-four hundred declarations in Canada, over nine hundred of
> them in British Columbia, between the years 1948 and 1992.20 Many,
> perhaps most, of these Aboriginal enrollments did not translate into

Can you give me an honest appraisal of the problems that the Aboriginal-
Bahá’í encounter now faces? If, as Horton observes, the “significance…of
the Aboriginal-Bahá’í encounter in the province lies beyond statistics,” what
challenges confront the dominant Bahá’í community now?

[A D D ISO N] Horton’s observation regarding “the pervasiveness of the
colonial legacy” is absolutely most significant here. The history of the West
is tainted with the notion that Indian culture (”uncivilized peoples”) must be
taught how to be white. Most white Canadians and Americans have no clue
with respect to how constantly they reinforce their own cultural
assumptions, right or wrong, and pile them upon Indians, never willing or
even interested in hearing our own Native view. I agree that the Bahá’ís in
Canada and the U.S. have made some good headway in the honoring and
validating native spiritual prophecies and principles. However, much more
transformation along the lines of intercultural interactions within the Bahá’í
international community needs to take place. In particular, I am referring
specifically to most (but not all) of our non-Native Bahá’ís who find it
impossible to break through the inner barriers of their own Euro-American
culture.

Yes, “consolidation” follow-up was lacking in those Native communities,
but I think the most paralyzing issue is cultural. When some Native
believers were filling a Peace Pipe for Rúhíyyih Khánum’s visit, for
example, at one conference where she spoke, lots of non-Native believers
acted very disrespectful and treated the Peace Pipe ceremony as satanic.
Rúhíyyih Khánum treated it with the highest degree of love and respect and
many believers were very rude to the Native peoples out of cultural
ignorance. When all or most of the members of the U.S. and Canadian
Bahá’í community are white, without any Indians, and they plan Ruhi study
circles, or for a dinner for a fireside, or a public meeting for United Nations
Day, all of the programming is white by culture. So what you have is that
many white Bahá’ís think that their community life is Bahá’í when, in fact,
it is more Euro-American in culture. For example, it is very traditional for
most all Native peoples at the beginning of any gathering, whether for
praying, singing, eating, etc., to quietly and unobtrusively to go and
personally shake the hand and greet any elders in the room. Most Euro-
Americans aren’t often comfortable doing this because, they assume, “I
don’t know them, so I don’t want to embarrass myself.” This lack of respect
for elders — or call it simply a lack of awareness to show such respect —

Horton, The Aboriginal –Bahá’í Encounter in British Columbia, 2.

can extend to other seemingly commonplace situations, where Euro-
American cultural assumptions unconsciously dictate behavior.

Accepting Bahá’u’lláh as the Healer — what Bahá’ís call the
“Manifestation of God” for this day and age, Who can bring all of humanity
together — is the first step. But unfortunately, most Euro-American
believers just stop there. They begin a very deceptive process, not out of
racism so much, but out of sheer unwillingness to step outside the
boundaries of their own cultural assumptions. The reason why most
believers in the West view their perception of Bahá’í culture as “universal”
in principle — when it really isn’t in practice — is because Westerners take
it for granted.

[B U C K ] Now let me see if I understand you correctly. Your anecdotal
account seems to underscore the central problematic in the Bahá’í-
Aboriginal encounter, as Horton alternatively frames it: “Patterns of
paternalism and non-Aboriginal cultural dominance persisted within the
Bahá’í community regardless of intense commitment to the overarching
principle of unity in diversity. This suggests both the pervasiveness of the
colonial legacy and the potency of contemporary social context. Like
religious change, the transformation of intercultural interactions represents a
process as opposed to event alone. Throughout the specific time period
under consideration, however, good intentions, it seems, proved insufficient
to fully achieve this goal.”22 Is Horton’s observation a fair characterization?
Let me hasten to add that I don’t expect you to go into great detail, as you
can paint the current scene in bold strokes, without compromising the
Bahá’í ethic against backbiting, as Horton herself observes: “The process of
oral history also demands sensitivity to the significance of silence as well as
verbal articulation. Given Bahá’u’lláh’s prohibition against ‘backbiting,’
which Bahá’ís take very seriously, a number of the consultants that I
interviewed proved reticent to discuss potentially controversial issues or
engage in critique of past people and events.”23 So I will respect any
reticence that you might have in being too specific in what you are about to
say.

[A D D ISO N] Thank you for commenting on that ethic. Before I address this
question, let me first say something about my training and experience, in
order to establish the “ethos” (credentials/credibility) needed to inspire
confidence in the reader that what I am about to say is borne of sufficient
background and knowledge in these rather delicate matters. As you know,
my Ph.D. is in ethnomusicology, and I’m currently in the process of
acquiring a second Ph.D. in linguistics. The University here (i.e. the
University of Oregon) rarely ever allows older students (I’m 64) to return to
graduate school to get a second Ph.D. But their diversity policy is very

Horton, The Aboriginal –Bahá’í Encounter in British Columbia, 12.

Horton, The Aboriginal –Bahá’í Encounter in British Columbia, 17.

strongly enforced here. Also the demand for Indians to work in linguistics
(because of so many of our languages dying out as we speak) is so great,
that they “invited” me to work toward a second Ph.D. in linguistics.
However, the second Ph.D. will simply formalize and validate what I’ve
been doing for some time now. I’ve taught Native American languages at
the college level for many years, and in our local Native American student
programs for the public schools as well. I script some of the “Wisdom of the
Elders” programs and curricula projects which are produced for public radio
broadcasts all across the country. So I think you’ll agree that what I am
about to say comes from extensive experience as well as academic training
in terms of framing these problematics and proposing possible solutions.

[B U C K ] It’s clear that you’re a fellow academic. But there’s something you
have that I don’t. Would you elaborate on that?

[A D D ISO N] For a minute there, you were making me feel like an
anthropologist, looking from the outside in! This is what we academics call
the “etic” approach. But I’m a mixed blood Choctaw. As a “real Indian,” as
they say, I offer an “emic” perspective, looking at the inside out. In that
sense, I guess you could say that I combine the training of an academic with
the worldview of an authentic Native American perspective.

At my age, I’m considered an Elder and I speak four of our Native
languages and teach them at the University level. As an Elder, I am
authorized to bear the Eagle Staffs in ceremonial processions and offer the
Native Prayers for most all the powwows in this area. I always use Bahá’í
Prayers in Native languages publicly in these powwows and most all Indians
in our area know that I’m a Bahá’í, and we’ve had some rather exciting
Native seekers arise and declare themselves also Bahá’í. Elders who are
strictly Christian or strictly traditional, likewise, pray publicly when called
upon, in their own tradition. There’s no hard-and-fast rule applying to
everyone. Any elder, asked to share a prayer at any of our Native
community activities, can do so in any language, and from any religious
tradition they choose. I can’t tell you the number of other elders and
younger Indians who come up to me and say how good it is for them to hear
American Indian languages in the prayers — because today, most Indians
simply don’t speak their traditional Native language.

[B U C K ] Don, your credentials are certainly impressive, and your
experience as a member of the Choctaw Nation imbues you with
authenticity. Now, let’s revisit the problem that Chelsea Horton has raised.
Recall her conclusions regarding the Bahá’í-Native encounter in British
Columbia, when she wrote: “Despite such empowering impact, however,
patterns of non-Aboriginal cultural dominance encountered within the
Bahá’í community simultaneously suggest the pervasiveness of the colonial
legacy and the potency of contemporary social context; good intentions

proved insufficient to fully transform intercultural interactions.”24 If this is
true, then what went wrong? And, more importantly, what can be done
about it?

[A D D ISO N] Whatever problems Horton has identified are really part of a
larger set of issues. Patterns of oppression, based upon incorrect Euro-
American perceptions of Indians, still exist. Due to the chronic lack of
accurate information about our Native cultures, fantasies about Indians and
our peoples, as well as our religions — attitudes largely inherited from the
colonial past — are still very much with us. They plague the academy. They
abound in the media. They are alive and well in society at large, and in the
concepts that the general population of the U.S. still maintains about
Indians. Many non-Indians, in fact, haven’t got a clue how hurtful it is when
Euro-Americans make assumptions about our peoples and our beliefs. And
these pompous and grossly inaccurate assumptions continue to abound
because so few folks are courageous enough to speak up when a wrong has
been committed.

[B U C K ] How do these attitudes manifest themselves in Bahá’í-Native
interactions? Can you give an example of a situation in which well-meaning
Bahá’ís might say or do the wrong thing, without realizing it?

[A D D ISO N] Yes, that’s quite easy to do. Here’s a typical scenario that I’ve
witnessed and experienced all too well. Remember I had spoken about our
elders, whom we hold in the highest respect. At Native gatherings, the
elders eat first. They go through the line to get their plates before all the rest
of the peoples. Euro-Americans rarely ever do this. And Bahá’ís are usually
following the Euro-American cultural prescriptions in community activities,
oblivious to Indian mores and culture. So Indians just sit in amazement,
hoping some day, “They will appreciate the elders, as we do.” Indians
believe the elders have earned that right to be fed first, or go through the
serving line first — that they have “paid their dues,” so to speak. I can’t tell
you how painful it is to have to tell you that with few exceptions, when
focusing Bahá’í teaching efforts among indigenous peoples, most white
Bahá’ís are usually unwilling to even consider allowing elders to eat first.

When meeting Indians for the first time, most whites ask far too many
questions. Even worse, when a white person thinks or assumes that they
might have some Indian blood, to “make friends” with this Indian, that’s the
first thing out of their mouth: “You know, I’m part Indian also!” “I have a
great great great great great grandmother who was a Cherokee princess in
our family ancestry.” Well, that’s actually the worst thing to do! Usually that
kind of a statement, without any previous contact with those Indians, is
considered phony and “sucking up.” I don’t go up to anyone and ask them
“how much French blood do you have”? So why does someone want me to

Horton, The Aboriginal –Bahá’í Encounter in British Columbia, iii (Abstract).

know that they have 1/64th Cherokee blood, and from a princess no less.
Why aren’t there ever any “princes” out there? Only “princesses”? For a
very good reason! Women ancestors pose no threat, but male ancestors
represented “the enemy” at one time! And why Cherokee? This is a common
joke among Indians: if there truly were as many Cherokee princesses as
some folks claim, the population of the Cherokee tribe would equal four
times the whole USA!

I believe at the top of this list of cultural misunderstandings among white
Bahá’ís is the notion that Native Americans of the whole Western
Hemisphere (our Native elders tell us) had genuine divinely ordained
Messengers of God. Rarely, if ever, have I seen these Native figures
compared to Prophets of other nations and peoples around the globe on an
equal footing: I agree with scholars Robert Ruby and John Brown when
they underscore this lack of recognition based on a want of
phenomenological parity:

> Unlike the prophets of other religions, Smohalla and Skolaskin
> needed no credentials from church boards or other governing bodies
> to prove that their authority came directly from above. Both believed
> in a “covenant” not unlike that of Judeo-Christianity, to which they
> owed a debt. This covenant required that, since the Creator nourished
> his children, they in turn were obligated to use and gratefully protect
> the bounties so generously bestowed on them. Any threats to the
> relationship between them and the Creator, be they human or natural,
> required supplications and appeasements beyond those required of
> traditional worshipers. It seems ironic that, despite the similarity of
> the native prophets to those of Judeo-Christian tradition, they were
> never accepted nor acknowledged as having merit by adherents of
those faiths.”

My epistemological basis stands in direct contradiction to the lack of
recognition that Ruby and Brown have noted above. As a believer in the
Prophethood of Bahá’u’lláh, the Founder of the Bahá’í Faith, I firmly
believe in the efficacy and whole-hearted validity of these Native
Messengers of God. Bahá’ís believe that all the Manifestations of God, or
Prophets of God — these great Spiritual Seers or Teachers, by whatever
name one chooses to call them — have appeared to all the peoples on earth
at one time or another, and that these Messengers have received guidance
from an unseen, otherworldly, divine source. These include Abraham,
Moses, Muhammad, Buddha, Krishna, Zoroaster, as well as the Founders of
the Bahá’í Faith, the Báb and Bahá’u’lláh — and to this list, I submit that
we should include, among others, White Buffalo Calf Woman and

25 Robert H. Ruby and John A. Brown, Dreamer Prophets of the Columbia Plateau: Smohalla and
Skolaskin. (Norman: University of Oklahoma Press, 1989; Red River Books edition), 2002), 14–15 (emphasis
added).

Deganawidah. I take the view here that these Prophets deserve
acknowledgement of their contributions in their own cultural contexts, and
should be acknowledged as such by the “outside world.” Western
theologians and historians will advance in their understanding of our Native
Prophets once they decide to remove the cultural and religious barriers to
understanding that they themselves have constructed in their own minds.
Furthermore, without trying to force these Native Messengers or spiritual
guides into a mold imposed from any outside perspective, we should not
deny the possibility that not only might Native Prophets internally share
similar as well as contrasting characteristics with one another, but that their
inclusion within a global context is only just and proper.

While Bahá’u’lláh does make statements to the effect that we, as have all
peoples, had them, there are still obstacles to this acknowledgement. At a
secondary level, many whites have certain superior cultural assumptions
that Indians find very difficult to deal with, so some just stop trying. Some
believers can’t even discuss the issue without critically taking to task the
person that acknowledges that Bahá’ís officially accept the validity of
Native Prophets. It’s far too difficult for them to break out of that cultural
mold. I think this problem is cultural, not theological.

[B U C K ] Are there any theological problems as well?

[A D D ISO N] Surprising as this may seem to many, if not most Bahá’ís, I
would have to say, yes. Again, just as in the intercultural problems that I’ve
just described, assumptions lie at the root. One such assumption is that if a
Prophet of God isn’t named in some authoritative text, this must be a false
Prophet. I don’t think that that is a Bahá’í belief. Rather, I attribute this to
the dominant cultural assumptions that a certain view of history is the
correct one, that their perception of the Bahá’í Teachings is the only valid
one, and that if Native peoples have a different take on things, non-Native
believers seem to just brush these aside. “They need a Ruhi study circle!”
“Send him to a deepening class!” Third, most all white peoples accept as
absolutely binding, the assumption that that Bering Straits theory must be
correct because scientists came up with it.26 For instance, Bahá’í scholar,
Dr. Susan Maneck, in her review of your abridged article, “Bahá’í
Universalism and Native Prophets,”27 essentially reads the Bering Straits
theory into a statement by ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, which we will discuss further in
this article:

> In terms of Bahá’í scholarship the most significant contribution of
this article is bringing to the forefront a Tablet written by ‘Abdu’l-

With all due respect to my colleague, this reading of a Bahá’í text reveals
more about the cultural assumptions behind the reading rather than the
“original intent” of the text itself, since ‘Abdu’l-Bahá is simply
acknowledging that the Bering Straits theory enjoyed wide currency,
although, to be fair, Dr. Maneck can rely on ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s statement in the
same Tablet: “There are other signs which indicate communication.”

Another thing is that Bahá’ís say, “We love all the Prophets of God,” and
then when we begin a discussion of specifics about Deganawidah, or White
Buffalo Calf Woman, or others, I can see the believers pulling back. I can
“hear” their “inner voices” saying, “Is this in the Writings?” Then I can see
them pulling back, and disengaging. Physically their rejection can be read
on their faces. And then I feel badly. I feel people buddy-up to us with
friendship, but they really don’t mean that Indians have “real” Prophets or
Manifestations of God.

Some non-Native believers, I truly believe, try sincerely to overcome those
invisible walls between our peoples, but a huge amount of work is yet to be
done, and so far, with a few rare exceptions, it hasn’t even begun.

[B U C K ] Fair enough. But is the Bahá’í Faith taking root in Native
American and Native Canadian cultures and contributing to the social
amelioration and empowerment of those communities? It seems to me that
what Chelsea Horton is saying is that the very question of forging what we
might call “decolonizing” relationships is, in fact, a core issue. While we
must not lose sight of power dynamics both internal and external to the
Faith, Horton has found that the Bahá’í community has nevertheless proved
a significant site of (oftentimes empowering) intercultural interaction
between Indigenous and non-Indigenous people that warrants analysis in
terms of its decolonizing achievements and potential. Horton writes:

Notwithstanding the potential to achieve ideal intercultural relations, the
Bahá’í-Native encounter has experienced some very real challenges. As a
researcher directly observing (and also experiencing) these interactions in
the course of her field work, Ms. Horton stresses the crucial role that non-
Native Bahá’ís can play in bringing about true intercultural parity and
reciprocity:

Yet, in light of the central problematic that Horton has identified (i.e.
“patterns of non-Aboriginal cultural dominance encountered within the
Bahá’í community simultaneously suggest the pervasiveness of the colonial
legacy and the potency of contemporary social context; good intentions
proved insufficient to fully transform intercultural interactions”), what needs
to be done to fully transform Bahá’í-Aboriginal intercultural interactions?
Might such a transformation begin with establishing intercultural religious
parity between the dominant Bahá’í culture and the indigenous Bahá’í
conclaves scattered throughout the First Nations of North America? Could
that process begin, both doctrinally and symbolically, with an affirmation of
the highest expressions of Native spirituality — that is, in a formal
recognition that North America (and, by extension, all of the Americas)
were not bereft of their own Prophets (to use an Abrahamic term)?

ibid.

[A D D ISO N] Yes, this is precisely where the application of an Abrahamic
term — prophets — as applied to Native Messengers of God would carry
manifest symbolic value. Better still would be to apply Bahá’í terminology
— Manifestations of God — to the great Native Wisdom Bearers. At least
this should be possible to do in principle, don’t you think?

[B U C K ] Let’s explore a solution that begins with a symbolic transformation
of the dominant Bahá’í culture’s relationship to the Native American and
other aboriginal Bahá’í communities. There may be a reading and linguistic
argument whereby one could reach this result, such that “Messengers of
God to First Nations” may now be presented as a valid Bahá’í principle,
anchored in a clear, authoritative text. You’ll recall that I had originally
proposed the following conceptual scheme in “Native Messengers” article
back in 1996:

__________________
* Sacred tradition names such Messengers
as Deganawidah, Quetzalcoátl and Viracocha

(Iroquois, Toltec, Inca traditions
in North, Central, and South America).

Let me introduce the teachings of Deganawidah, since he is the first
traditional Native Messenger of God mentioned in the note above. His
station is clearly that of a Messenger of God:

> It is just this, that the Holder of the Heavens, Dehaenhyawa?gih,
> chose her as the medium through whom shall be born the one he has
> sent to work here on earth. “Moreover, when he shall be born you
> two shall name him Deganawidah. And the reason he shall have such

> brings with him Power, ga?shasdenhsa?, and also the Great Law,
> gayanebsa?go:nah, that everything shall become peaceful,
> sken:non?, on earth as well as in the sky-world.”31

In Bahá’í theophanology, there is the Messenger and then there is the
Message. This roughly corresponds to what systematic theologians term the
“Person” and the “Work” of Jesus Christ. In more familiar Christian terms,
Christ is both the “Savior” who brings “salvation.” Bahá’ís have
universalized that concept (not derivatively, but simply analogously), such
that every Messenger of God is effectively a Savior-figure and every

Confederacy (Norman University of Oklahoma Press, 1998: Series: Civilization of the American Indian, Vol.
223), 85.

corresponding Message effects the process of salvation. In every age and era
of history in which a Messenger of God appears, the peoples of that part of
the world have a responsibility to investigate the truth of that Messenger’s
claims. This involves two “twin” duties: (1) recognition of the Messenger of
God; and then (2) application of the Messenger’s Message (that is, faithful
adherence to the laws and ethical teachings revealed by that Messenger of
God). Now as for Deganawidah’s divine Message, the reader can judge for
himself or herself how closely it resonates with the essential teachings of
Bahá’u’llah and also Jesus. This is the essence of Deganawidah’s Message:

> I carry the Mind of the Master of Life … and my Message will bring
an end to the wars between east and west.

The Word that I bring is that all peoples shall love one another
> and live together in peace. This message has three parts:
> Righteousness and Health and Power — Gáiwoh, Skénon,
Gashasdénshaa . And each part has two branches.

Righteousness means justice practiced between men and
> between nations; it means also a desire to see justice prevail.
> Health means soundness of mind and body; it also means peace, for
that is what comes when minds are sane and bodies are cared for.

Power means authority, the authority of law and custom,
> backed by such force as is necessary to make justice prevail; it means
> also religion, for justice enforced is the will of the Holder of the
> Heavens and has his sanction.32

[A D D ISO N] There may be a connection between the passage you’ve just
cited and Deganawidah’s name. First, let me say something about how
deeply this name is revered by most Native American who are familiar with
the Deganawidah tradition. The Iroqouis consider Deganawidah’s name so
sacred as to be ineffable — that is, out of reverence and profound respect,
the name “Deganawidah” should not be pronounced. Instead, Deganawidah
is customarily referred to as “the Peacemaker.”

The sacred name “Deganawidah” means “two river currents flowing
together.”33 This is significant because these “two rivers” could be a
metaphor for both Deganawidah and His spokesman, Hiawatha (as His
major mouthpiece or speaker, since Deganawidah stuttered). Or it is
tantalizing to see this metaphor of “two rivers” in light of the prophecy
you’ve quoted above: that the “two rivers” might refer to the “east and
west” in your sentence, “I carry the Mind of the Master of Life … and my
Message will bring an end to the wars between east and west.”

[B U C K ] Interesting! I hadn’t thought of that.

[A D D ISO N] Now before you develop the notion that Deganawidah is a
great Prophet (which is a common, perhaps universal belief among Native
Americans who are not predisposed by Christian doctrinal conservatism to
believe otherwise), can you say something that might begin to articulate a
Bahá’í perspective on Native Messengers of God generally?

[B U C K ] Well, while there may be some distance between the ideal and the
actual with regard to Native American spirituality by the Bahá’í community
at large, the official Bahá’í position is quite clear, so far as it goes.
Generally, we can say that the Bahá’í attitude towards Native American
religions is — or should be — been characterized by the Universal House of
Justice as follows:

> The Bahá’í attitude to earlier religions, therefore, is not that they are
> false or “heathen”, but that, at root, they are all true and that these
> fundamental truths still persist within them. Bahá’ís encourage
> Indians in South America, for example, to see and reverence the
> profound spiritual truths which are to be found in both their pre-
> Christian religions and in the Catholicism which, in later centuries,
> has to varying degrees supplanted or overlaid their archaic faiths.

Therefore, Native Bahá’ís should neither feel — nor be made to feel — “the
inner conflict which many still feel between their ancient religions and
Christianity.” Moreover, since the source of all spiritual truth ultimately
harks back, in Bahá’í belief, to a Manifestation of God, therefore the source
of all Native wisdom and spirituality perforce must derive from a Native
Messenger (or from more than one Native Messengers of God), as Shoghi
Effendi clearly implies, in a text cited by the Bahá’í World Centre:

preserving the languages, cultures and spiritual traditions of American

Indians and other indigenous peoples. This was her abiding passion.
Moreover, she helped organize seventeen tribally-run colleges, and
influenced changes in federal laws affecting Native Americans. In 1991,
Locke was awarded a MacArthur Foundation Fellowship. She was also the
first Native American woman elected to the National Spiritual Assembly of
the Bahá’ís of the United States (1993–2001). As a crowning tribute to her
life and work, in 2003 Patricia Locke was admitted into the National
Women’s Hall of Fame.36 Reflect how this historic document, the
Declaration of Vision, which Locke was instrumental in facilitating, and
which was initially adopted by a near-unanimous vote by the delegates at
the 1993 Parliament of World’s Religions, yet ultimately nullified by Dr.
David Ramage, Jr., Chairman of the Council Parliament, who overruled the
vote. The 1993 American Indian Declaration of Vision states, in part:

> One hundred years ago, during the 1893 Parliament of World
> Religions, the profoundly religious Original Peoples of the Western
> Hemisphere were not invited. We are still here and still struggling to
> be heard for the sake of our Mother Earth and our children. Our
> spiritual and physical survival continues to be threatened all over the
> hemisphere, we feel compelled to ask you to join us in restoring the
> balances of humanity and Mother Earth in these ways:

A. Acknowledgement of the myriad of messengers of the Creator,

the Great Mystery, to the peoples of the Western Hemisphere.
B. Support in promoting, preserving and maintaining our

Indigenous languages and cultures.37

Obviously the Bahá’í delegates (Patricia Locke and Jacqueline Left Hand
Bull, who is now Chair of the National Spiritual Assembly of the Bahá’ís of
the United States), had voted in support of this resolution. It seems to me
that, if Patricia Locke and Jacqueline Left Hand Bull had advocated that the
peoples of the world should ensure “that the myriad of Messengers of God
to the peoples of the Western Hemisphere be acknowledged,” then surely
the Bahá’í Faith should as well — at least in principle, especially on the
clear authority of the Tablet to Amír Khán.

Now, Don, let me ask you: Would this be a welcome way of presenting the
Bahá’í Faith to Native Americans and Native Canadians, as well as to the
indigenous peoples of South America and Central America? I believe that
Chelsea Horton has already predicted that it would, when she writes: “In
regards to the question of ‘Messengers of God to First Nations’…[i]f by this
you mean the recognition, acknowledgement, and validation of Indigenous
prophets on the part of the Bahá’í community (whether officially or at the

Country, September, 1993.

level of praxis), my research in British Columbia has certainly indicated this
to have had an empowering effect for Indigenous Bahá’ís.”38 Do you agree?

[A D D ISO N] Yes! Wholeheartedly yes! Lots of Indians view such
recognition of “Deganawidah, Quetzalcoátl and Viracocha” and are deeply
thrilled, deep down inside. Like a breath of fresh air! Even some will say to
themselves, “Well, this group of names comes from other tribes and
indigenous Nations, not my own particular tribe or prophet or spiritual
leader (whatever you want to call them). But this list of Native Messengers
does contain at least some founders of indigenous religions, and therein is
“the miracle” — finally a religion that includes our own! At long last,
there’s a religion that came along (the Bahá’í Faith) in which some of its
followers and some of its literature includes Native Prophets! Or at least the
notion that Native Prophets have existed that must have been inspired by the
Divine Creator of us all! Native peoples love this! (Except, of course, those
converted Indians who are stuck in the very literalist, evangelical Christian,
very closed-minded doctrines, foreign to Native experience and culture. And
unfortunately we do have some Indians that have bought that notion, “hook,
line and sinker.”) I love it! Yakoke! (Choctaw for “Thank you.”)

As you know, I’m Choctaw. We had a very very ancient prophet whose
name was lost. He’s part of our earliest creation/migration story (we don’t
call it a “myth” for obvious reasons) and “prophet” is the word used in our
Choctaw stories in English. I can even cite publications where “prophet” is
the term used. Even though this chart doesn’t include our Choctaw prophet,
Choctaw peoples will look at this list and be thrilled! The reason being is
this: that previous religious literature and (especially Christian) missionaries
actually teach the reverse — that our Native prophets were Satan
personified, or were the “anti-Christ” or that they were duping the people. I
heard a Christian minister with a straight face once say, “All Native
prophets were sent by the devil.” And he was serious! It makes most Native
peoples sick when folks say this, but we’re used to it from Christians. But
when Bahá’ís include even some Native Prophets, somewhere, anywhere in
their presentation of the Faith (whatever form that takes) it is like a huge
“Ah-ha!” “Finally!” Then Indians sense that “when these Bahá’ís are saying
that they are free of religious prejudices, they really mean it! They ‘walk
their talk’.” I have seen other Native people accept the Bahá’í Faith deep
down in their hearts (that internal inmost spirit inside each of us) and accept
Bahá’u’lláh (Whom they’d never previously heard of) initially because a
Bahá’í states that Bahá’u’lláh makes statements along the lines that there is
no people on earth to whom God has not sent some prophet or messenger!

[B U C K ] I have found what appears to be an ethnographic record of the
name of your Prophet, which was Chah-Tah: “The name of their principal

Addison, cited with permission.

chief or prophet was Chah-tah, and he was a man of great age and
wisdom.”39

[A D D ISO N] I loved your information on “Chah-Tah” being the “name” of
the ancient Choctaw Prophet. Somewhere, sometime back, somewhere
along the way, it seems to me that I vaguely recall that others have talked
about that notion and this idea has been around for a while. I have a
tendency to really accept it as valid and accurate, even without “empirical”
proof, because it has been very common in ancient times for a Prophet’s
name to become the name of a people’s tribe, band, clan or even family, and
in this case, we have abundant “hints” that our tribe’s authentic name
“Chahta,” came into existence by virtue of “Chahta” being the name of that
early Messenger or Prophet of God. He was honored and his memory given
great prestige that the tribe was named for him. It was Europeans who
changed the spelling, and hence the name, from Chahta to Choctaw. But we
still say “Chahta” as our tribal name. So thanks much for finding this. You
certainly are constantly amazing me with the wonderful materials you come
up with.

[B U C K ] Thanks, Don. Let me you ask a question regarding a sensitive
issue. I have chosen “First Nations” here, although it is a Native Canadian
term. Some have objected to my use of “First Nations” here, arguing that’s
it’s a purely Canadian term. Does “First Nations” enjoy some currency
today among Native Americans today? If so, is it an acceptable phrase in
terms of its accuracy and dignity, or is it used alternatively or even
begrudgingly? Is this term appropriate?

[A D D ISO N] I think “First Nations” is a beautiful term, an honorary term.
Its certainly not an “abbreviated” term that divides peoples one from
another. Personally, I think it’s more inclusive. I find its use among Bahá’ís
as highly respectful and shows that Bahá’ís are attempting to redress the
wrongs of colonial times. Because behind those two beautiful words —
“First Nations” — are families, and grandmothers, prayer makers, and
loving relationships, one tribe with another, and all the love that my mother
put into the red and green grass dance outfit she sewed for me by hand when
I was a kid, etc. What is not a “First Nation,” by contrast, is clearly meant
the Europeans who came to the Western Hemisphere looking for gold,
conquest, converts, lands, etc.

Sometimes the use of “First Nations” is a statement of survival. We’re here
still, in spite of 600 years of efforts to eradicate all of us indigenous peoples.
I would deeply encourage a more fuller reading of “First Nations” — not to
exclude others who have different prophets, or “no” prophets at all — but to

(April 1870).

include all peoples who faced the onslaught of Europeans who had guns,
and Natives who only had spiritual beliefs to sustain them.

I’m interested in what you have to say about this Bahá’í text — one that
you’ve effectively rediscovered and brought back to influential life. Do you
mean the Tablet to Amír Khán, which you briefly discussed in your lengthy
“Native Messengers” article back in 1996?

[B U C K ] Yes. I should give credit, however, to my dear wife, Nahzy Abadi
Buck, who first brought this Tablet to my attention. But there have been
some problems associated with this text.

[A D D ISO N] How so?

[B U C K ] There were discussions about the Tablet to Amír Khán on two
scholarly Bahá’í lists — Tarikh and Tarjuman. Unfortunately, these debates
generated more heat than light, and I was opposed by several individuals on
each list — yet others — that is, those few individuals who have been
willing to explore this issue further, to assist in the necessary research, and
who have contributed their understanding of the text — have made it all
worthwhile. This debate, I should add, has already attracted scholarly
attention. On the positive side, Chelsea Dawn Horton40 notes:

However, this position has had its detractors. I have my own stories to tell,
having directly experienced criticism with the lively (and deadening!)
“debate” of which Chelsea Horton speaks.

[A D D ISO N] Yes, I’ve read some of the recent postings that have
confronted your postings — as well as to the proposition that drew such
opposition. I would say that, while your views did generate some support,
they were often resisted by others. What, if any, was your most successful
argument against this opposition?

[B U C K ] Good question. That would be when I posted this argument on 16
May 2007:

[A D D ISO N] Wow! Now that’s quite a scenario — what you call a
“hypothetical” — that almost anyone in the West can relate to. What about
the text itself? First, what were the “circumstances of revelation,” as
Islamicists would say? Who was the recipient? Who was Amír Khán? And
how did his questions regarding the issue of Manifestations of God in North
America arise in the first place? What do you think precipitated this sudden
and unexpected interest in Native Americans?

[B U C K ] On this issue, I think you’ll agree when I say that the Tablet to
Amír Khán exists in “splendid isolation” (as scholars sometimes refer to a
unique text) and is thus a singular and therefore absolutely critical text. As
for Amír Khán himself, I’d say that it wasn’t so much an interest in
indigenous cultures per se, but rather a curiosity about the possibility of
extra-Semitic and extra-Aryan Messengers of God. Or, more simply, we can
say that Amír Khán was concerned over what scholars like John Hinnells
have termed, “the salvation of others.” As for the identity of Amír Khán
himself, Dr. Iraj Ayman knew him personally. Here is what Dr. Ayman says
about him:

> Amír Khán of Tehran refers to a Bahá’í known as Amír Khán Áhan.
> He owned a shop at the beginning of Naser Khosrow Street in
> Tehran. It had a sign of “Magházeh Áhan.” So he was known in
> Tehran as Amír Khán-i-Magházeh Áhan. He was importing and
> selling various hardware items. Amír Khán was famous for his many

I then replied:

Dr. Ayman responded in two separate messages, which I combine as

Here, “photographically publishing in blue color” refers to mimeographing
or jellygraphing as a form of reproduction, since the publication of Bahá’í
books in Iran was outlawed (and still is).

This Tablet takes on heightened significance as a textual basis for putting
forth the proposition that “Messengers of God to First Nations” is a valid
Bahá’í principle, the formalization and application of which would go far in
bringing about a symbolic transformation of interracial and intercultural
relations — first among mainstream American Bahá’ís and Bahá’ís of
Native American ancestry and identity. Wouldn’t you agree?

[A D D ISO N] I wish the non-Indian believers here in the West were more
tolerant of our Native voices and American Indian Prophets. As a Native
American, I’m deeply saddened that some Bahá’ís of non-Indian
backgrounds find it so difficult to cut through their own European cultural
barriers that cloud their open acknowledgment of Native American Prophets
as Manifestations of God.

Would it be a serious breach of Bahá’í belief or a mistaken
misrepresentation of the Teachings of Bahá’u’lláh if an enrolled Bahá’í in
good standing were to write and publish in print “Bahá’ís acknowledge the
validity of the Prophethood of Deganawidah”? It seems to me that this

would not detract in any way from the authenticity of Bahá’u’lláh or His
Writings, nor does it in any way detract from the validity of all the other
Central Figures and the Administrative Structure of this Divinely ordained
Faith. This statement, I hasten to add, doesn’t in any possible way represent
a challenge to the Covenant — God forbid! My statement is fully in
accordance with “there being ‘no people to whom a Messenger has not been
sent’ and the general doctrinal position that ultimately all religion comes
from God,” as you yourself just stated. Why impose a disconnect between
the latter and the former?

The Sacred Writings of the Báb, the forerunner, and Bahá’u’lláh, the
Prophet-Founder of the Bahá’í Faith, of even Bahá’u’lláh’s appointed
successor, His eldest Son, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, do not specifically mention any
Native American Prophet by name. However, their Writings all clearly
imply their existence. Many distinguished Bahá’í writers, scholars, and
administrative servants of the Faith, have increasingly been referring to
Native Prophets in public talks, in publishes articles, and other media
presentations.

[B U C K ] Quite true. First, note that both Qur’ánic and Bahá’í texts that
basically state that no people, at some point in its history, has been bereft of
divine guidance. Thus, “Unto every nation hath an Apostle been sent” (Q.
10:47; cf. Q. 16:36). In the Commentary on the Surah of the Sun,
Bahá’u’lláh states that Messengers of God have been sent to every people:
“As thou canst see, every nation on earth hath been enlightened by one of
these brightly shining Suns. Whoso denieth Them remaineth deprived.”55

[A D D ISO N] That’s certainly a universalism. For skeptics, however, isn’t
that a little too general, too abstract, too diffuse? I think that, while
practically all Bahá’ís would support this analysis, relatively few of them
would be prepared to extend full recognition and parity with the highest
spirituality that indigenous cultures have to offer. This is a precious legacy
that, if ignored and otherwise devalued, can never combust with mainstream
Bahá’í spirituality to ignite the worldwide influence that ‘Abdu’l-Bahá has
envisioned (and predicted) that the indigenous Bahá’ís of North America
might contribute. I recall that ‘Abdu’l-Bahá had commented on the fact that
America had a great civilization in the past.

[B U C K ] Yes, Don, in fact it was you who recently brought this to my
attention in a recent posting of yours. It was either Friday, July 5, 1912, or
July 9, 1912, when Bahá’í artist, Juliet Thompson, took the leader of the
Bahá’í Faith, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, to visit the American Museum of Natural
History. Of particular interest was an exhibit of art and artifacts from early
America. Whether pre-Columbian or later is not clear at this time. This

Iowa: Omphaloskepsis, 2000) at 10–11

exhibit was probably on the Blackfoot Indians, since anthropologist Clark
Wissler (1870–1947) was curator of the American Museum of Natural
History in New York City for nearly 40 years, and had published several
monographs on the Blackfoot Indians.56 On seeing this exhibit, ‘Abdu’l-
Bahá made a comment in passing—recorded in its original Persian in
Mahmud’s Diary—from which a possible religious significance might be
inferred. The authoritative account relates this event as follows:

> Today, at the invitation of Juliet Thompson, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá went to a
> museum near His house. On the first floor there were statues, figures of
> animals and a collection of relics of early American civilization. On
> observing these objects, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá said, “From these things it
> appears that America had a great civilization in ancient times.”57

The Persian original reads: “Az ín áthár ma’lum ast kih Amríká dar ayyám
qadím dará-yi tamaddún búdih.”58 Translated literally, this means: “From
these relics, it appears America had a civilization in the days of old.”59 On
the surface, this is a statement of the obvious. Whether it has a deeper
meaning — that the rise of a great civilization is necessarily the result of a
great religion — is impossible to say.

[A D D ISO N] I agree. Evidence of a high civilization does not directly imply
a Manifestation of God. That’s the problem as I see it. In the vast corpus of
Bahá’í Writings, it appears that only one single text been found that might
conclusively establish that North America had not only high civilizations
but independent Manifestations of God. It that your conclusion?

[B U C K ] As far as specific pronouncements on that issue are concerned, I
would have to say, yes.

Mohi Sobhani (Oxford: George Ronald, 1998), 158–159. For an alternative account of this excursion, see Juliet
Thompson, The Diary of Juliet Thompson, with a preface by Marzieh Gail (Los Angeles: Kalimát Press, 1983),
329–332. However, Juliet Thompson’s date differs from that of Mahmúd, in that she gives Monday, July 9, 1912
(see p. 329). Not only does this date conflict with that given in Mahmud’s Diary, but the comment by ‘Abdu’l-
Bahá as well:

> “I have heard a tradition,” I said, “that in the very distant past this country and Asia were connected.”
> “Assuredly,” answered the Master, “before a great catastrophe there was such a connection between
Asia and America.”

It should be noted that Mahmúd’s account is considered authoritative as it is “regarded as a reliable
account of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s travels in the West and an authentic record of His utterances, whether in the form of
formal talks, table talks or random oral statements. Mírzá Mahmúd was a careful and faithful chronicler and
engaged in assembling and publishing his work with the permission of the beloved Master.” (The Universal House
of Justice.) Thus this contradiction should be resolved in favor of Mahmúd’s report, and Juliet Thompson’s
contradictory narrative regarded with some suspicion here, where she also states that the exhibit was one of
Mexican antiquities (not of Blackfoot culture).

[A D D ISO N] Seeing that this text, the Tablet to Amír Khán Áhan, exists in
“splendid isolation,” as you say, why don’t we take a closer look at it? It’s
this part of the Tablet that interests us:

> In ancient times the people of America ( ahl-i A mrík) were, through
> their northern regions, close to Asia, that is, separated from Asia by a
strait. For this reason, it hath been said that crossing had occurred.

There are other signs which indicate communication. As to
> places whose people were not informed of the appearance of
> Prophets, such people are excused. In the Qur’án it hath been
> revealed: “We will not chastise them if they had not been sent a
> Messenger” (Q. 17:15, má kunná mu’ádhdhibína hattá nab’atha
rasúlá an).60

Undoubtedly, in those regions, the Call of God must have
> been raised in ancient times, but it hath been forgotten now ( al-battih
> dar án s.afahát níz dar azmanih-yi-qadímih vaqtí nidá-yi-iláhí
> buland gashtih va-lákin hál farámúsh shudih ast).61

Now I like this statement from ‘Abdu’l-Bahá very much: “Undoubtedly in
those regions the Call of God must have been raised in ancient times, but it
hath been forgotten now.” My own people, the Choctaw, had an ancient
Prophet whose name no one remembers (unless, as you pointed out, the
name of our Prophet was “Chah-tah”). So I think ‘Abdu’l-Bahá is quite
accurate here as well. Only a very few Native American Prophets’ names
have endured. We have some, identified all the way from the lowliest village
elder, healer, traditional singer of prayers, all the way up to “great seers,”
“great visionaries,” “spiritual leaders,” to lesser Prophets and Major
Manifestations of God — just as in most other societies on earth (although
the terms change obviously). With the exception of famous people like
Wodziwob, Ganiodaiyo (Handsome Lake), White Buffalo Calf Woman,
Deganawidah, we have others who admittedly are problematic. Yet some of
our sacred traditions remain. Thus they are “remembered” — not forgotten.
They are preserved as living traditions. Does this language of “forgotten”
effectively bar Bahá’í recognition of these living traditions?

[B U C K ] Again, let’s examine the clause, “…but it hath been forgotten
now” (va-lákin hál farámúsh shudih ast ), closely. Here follow
representative texts in which ‘Abdu’l-Bahá comments on how living
religious traditions — all of the named exemplars of which are considered
“historic” insofar as they are “founded” religions — are functionally
“forgotten” even though they are present in the world today.

My thesis is simply this: “Forgotten” is relative, not absolute. “Forgotten”
does not mean that all memory of the Manifestation of God and His/Her
Teachings has been effaced from historical memory, without a trace. Rather,
“forgotten” primarily means that the Teachings have been displaced, having
lost their primacy in actual practice.

[A D D ISO N] The notion of “forgotten” is a huge issue in Indian country as
well. First, most Native peoples will say that we all accept the fact that some
of our cultures have been “forgotten,” no doubt about it, but the white Euro-
American suppression of our peoples, languages, religions, and cultures has
not wiped everything away. So lots of Indians are super-sensitive about
saying, for example, that our music or that our language is “dead.” Rather,
since many of our languages that used to be spoken fluently in the 19th
century are no longer around, we simply say that these languages “are
asleep.”

During the most severe repression of our religions in the U.S. and Canada,
the languages, dances, stories and the songs were forced underground, or
our people said, “put to sleep.” Now they can be revived out in the open,
those songs and languages that remain, when elders can be found still alive
who are willing to remember them and bring them back to the community.
Unfortunately, a few of our living elders in various parts of the country have
been so deeply hurt by Christian missionaries telling them “your religions
and your languages are evil,” so much so, that some of these elders actually
started believing that. They then refuse to share any of their traditional
cultures (today) that they might remember because they don’t want “to go to
hell when they die.” Many parents wouldn’t teach their Native language to
their kids so they wouldn’t suffer what the parents went through with
classmates laughing at Indian children who speak in their native tongue.
During the Boarding School Era, if you pretended to “forget” your Native
religion, it meant you would be beaten by the missionaries much less often!

‘Abdu’l-Bahá, Some Answered Questions, 52–53.

‘Abdu’l-Bahá, Selections from the Writings of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, (Haifa: Bahá’í World Centre, 1982), 252.

That was a means of sheer survival. Some say during those difficult times
that “we weren’t dumb, just numb!” To “appear” to “forget,” one has to “go
numb,” to “pretend” to “fit in,” so the missionaries wouldn’t beat the kids as
much.

“Forgetting” of the past is a much more difficult set of problems. Many of
the ancient Native spiritual traditions and “Teachings” have been lost, no
doubt about it, from both the ravages of time, cultural migrations and
change, and especially from official governmental attempts to cripple our
Native religions through the boarding schools, enacting of anti-Indian
legislation, English-only programs, forced Christian Church conversions,
etc., and when those failed, some of our religions and their ceremonies and
their practitioners were persecuted at gun point. The Ghost Dance
worshippers, massacred in 1890 at Wounded Knee, and other similar events
explains why most of our peoples say “certain ceremonies have been
forgotten.” However, many Teachings still remain — such as reverence for
the Creator, the importance of prayer, the relationship between sacred lands
and sacred traditions, those “ancestors” who are “still associated with the
land,” our need to care for this land, the Native prophecies that are still
remembered and recorded, our valuable elders and the cultural wisdom they
pass on, and above all, the fact that much — but not all — of our sacred
beliefs and Teachings, do survive as they are passed on to our young people.
These include beliefs from ancient Prophets, some of Whose Names have
not even survived into the 21st century, but most all Indians regard their
“memories” as sacred, even if we know little more than that about most of
them. Native Bahá’ís often, but not necessarily always, enjoy recapturing
our Native languages, and learning about our Native belief systems — you
see these do not really conflict with the Bahá’í Message.

While many elders talk as if much of the spiritual knowledge of the past still
remains, a more accurate appraisal is that “it does, and it doesn’t.” So for
Indian religious traditions with which I have spent a life time studying and
in which I have participated for many years, “forgotten” — many will agree
— is a relative term. I and many other Native Bahá’ís feel that Bahá’u’lláh
has “revived” many Native ways and recast some “concepts” that were
“lost” and now have been “returned” — from perhaps a different part of the
globe, but with the same spiritual energy, creative vigor, and transformative
power. I have witnessed first hand how the Bahá’í Faith has already begun
to create the rich and loving climate for a “return to Native cultures” while
concurrently “stepping into the new world community” brought by
Bahá’u’lláh, and seeing these two as complementary, and not competitive in
any way.

The “Call of God” mentioned in this Tablet is a most significant metaphor
to most Indians who really know their own cultural, spiritual, and Native
belief systems. I find this absolutely fascinating.

[B U C K ] I’m glad you drew our attention to this metaphor, the explication
of which may prove decisive — either way. Here is how I would analyze
this figurative expression. Rhetorically as well as logically, the “Call of
God” presupposes a “Caller” — one who is doing the calling. In Islamic
eschatology, this is a Summoner to the Day of Judgement. Prefigured in the
Qur’án (Q. 50:42; cf. Q. 3:193), this future Figure is actually called “the
Caller” or “the Crier” ( al-Munádí ), and is a subject of the Last Day. The
Caller is thus an actor in the divine drama of the end of prophetic history,
which Bahá’í doctrine equates with the beginning of history of prophecy
come true (the “Cycle of Fulfillment”). The Caller is eschatologically
realized in the persons of the Báb and Bahá’u’lláh. In the Tablet of the Son,
for instance, Bahá’u’lláh has identified the Báb as the eschatological
“Caller” of the Qur’an.69 Similarly, in the Lawh-i Aqdas: “Say, did ye not
hearken to the Voice of the Crier, calling aloud in the wilderness of the
Bayán, bearing unto you the glad-tidings of the coming of your Lord, the
All-Merciful?”70 Although the phrase al-nidá al-iláhí does not appear in the
Qur’án, it would be difficult for anyone familiar with the Qur’án to read the
phrase and not think of al-Munádí , according to Dr. Moojan Momen.71

[A D D ISO N] That’s all well and good. But as you well know, Bahá’ís are
not Muslims. The Qur’an, at best, would enjoy a secondary authority at best.
What about evidence from the Bahá’í primary sources themselves?

[B U C K ] While we would have to verify each text in the Persian or Arabic
original, a representative survey of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s various usages of the
“Call of God” are all unified by one single referent: the Manifestation of
God (primarily, but not exclusively, Bahá’u’lláh) and His message. We can
arrive at this determination by examining such exemplars as these:

Message of T he M anifestations(s) of God:

> O ye concourse of the Kingdom of Abhá! Two calls to success and
> prosperity are being raised from the heights of the happiness of
> mankind… The one is the call of civilization, of the progress of the

On the basis of this evidence, the expression “Call of God” (Persian: nidá-yi
iláhí) in Bahá’í texts is a transparent reference to Prophets of God in
general, and, in historical-contemporary references to Bahá’í history, to
Bahá’u’llah in particular (as well as the Báb). The expression, the “Call of
God,” is thus a stock allusion to revelation, as in Bahá’u’lláh’s poetic
description of the Báb’s revelation: “The divine call (nidá-yi iláhí ) of the
Celestial Herald from beyond the Veil of Glory.”84

Of all of the possible meanings of the phrase, the “Call of God,” the
probable meaning is that ‘Abdu’l-Bahá is speaking of a Manifestation of
God and His message. Relying on these exemplars, which both fairly and
primarily represent ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s relevant discourse, I conclude that the
probable meaning — indeed, the almost certain meaning — of the “Call of
God” in the Tablet to Amír Khán of Tehran is a Manifestation of God —
such that ‘Abdu’l-Bahá can be understood as confirming the existence of a
Manifestation or Manifestations of God to North America.

[A D D ISO N] What about the place from which the Call of God originates?

[B U C K ] Let’s examine this statement closely: “Undoubtedly in those
regions the Call of God must have been raised in ancient times, but it hath
been forgotten now.” The words, “Undoubtedly in those regions” (al-battih
dar án s.afahát) indicates ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s preferred explanation, in favoring
the third possibility that Amír Khán must have raised: namely, that one or
more Manifestations of God appeared in North America. As stated, the
“Call of God” appears to be ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s euphemism for a Manifestation
of God and His Message.

Since the whole discussion was about North America in the first place, “in
those regions” has to mean North America. Furthermore, it cannot mean
Asia, since Manifestations of God had already appeared in Asia. For
‘Abdu’l-Bahá, there is no question but that this must be so, which is why he
uses the adverb, “undoubtedly” (al-battih). As to place, the words “in those
regions” (dar án s.afahát) must refer to North America — and not to

circumpolar Asia — for syntactical as well as semantic reasons, as the
previous sentence refers to “places whose people were not informed of the
appearance of Prophets.”

“In ancient times the people of America were, through their northern
regions, close to Asia, that is, separated from Asia by a strait. For this
reason, it hath been said that crossing had occurred. There are other signs
which indicate communication.” Here, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá notes the possibility of
“communication” between the circumpolar regions of present-day Russia
and Alaska, presumably across the land-bridge of the the Bering Straits. It is
important to note that ‘Abdu’l-Bahá does not commit Himself to this theory.
In saying that “it hath been said that crossing had occurred,” ‘Abdu’l-Bahá
simply acknowledges a prevailing theory, advanced by some of the leading
geologists and anthropologists of the day. While the reader gets the sense —
or even the distinct impression — that ‘Abdu’l-Bahá cites this scientific
authority with tacit approval,85 still He entertains the opposite possibility in
His response to what appears to have been Amír Khán’s second concern or
question.

The land-bridge theory has its attractions for religious reasons, in that it
makes it possible for the “Call of God” — the saving Message of a
Manifestation of God — to have reached the ancient inhabitants of North
America as the missionary by-product of the migration of peoples from East
Asia to North America. For this hypothesis to hold, not only would there
have to be persuasive evidence of material culture (and some argue that
there is), there would also have to be compelling evidence of similar
spiritual practices that resist the alternative explanation of having simply
reflected parallel developments. In neither case is there a sufficiently strong
monotheistic tradition (despite the presence of “High Gods”) that one might
expect from a Bahá’í concept of a Manifestation of God.

[A D D ISO N] Despite the fact that this theory has its attractions for
religiously-minded people that measure prophetic authenticity by the
yardstick that you’ve trenchantly termed “Semiticentrism” — which term
perhaps we could refine as Arya-Semiticentrism (as the Bahá’í Writings
acknowledge the non-Semitic, Aryan, Manifestations of God as well) — the
Bering Straits theory has its detractors. Indeed, it has the opposite effect on
Native Americans. Most Native Americans see that Bering Straights theory
of our Native origins as the white man’s conception. You see, that’s not how
we view our origins. Each tribal community may have one or more origin

85 Anecdotal evidence for this exists in the following reported utterance of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá recorded by
Louis Gregory (who was later designated as a Hand of the Cause of God): “But in very ancient times Asia led all
the continents in civilization. At this time there was a connection between Asia and America which was lost and
entirely forgotten. As to the belief of the American Indians in the Great Spirit, this is explained by the fact that
worship is inherent in the nature of man, who must have something above himself upon which he may depend.
Even men who are unconscious of this and deny it, depend upon it notwithstanding.” Louis G. Gregory, ‘A
Heavenly Vista: The Pilgrimage of Louis G. Gregory’ (Ferndale, MI: Alpha Services, 1997 [reprint of original
edition: Washington. D.C.: Pendleton, 1911(?)]), 13.

story, often called “myths” which is (again) a very insensitive and hurtful
term. Why are our Native origin stories “myths”, but the Euro-American or
Euro-Canadian “explanation” considered “scientific irrefutable proof”? (In
the same light, why are our Native arts called “crafts” or “handicrafts” and
“hobbies” and European examples “high art”? and “Fine arts”?)

As a Choctaw, I enjoy our own approaches to science and scientific
pursuits. We have them, you know, but about the only folks in the Western
Hemisphere that knows nothing about our Native sciences are the Euro-
American scientists and scholars. I find academics particularly fond of
claiming that our Indian origins are “their” (the white’s) domain of study,
and that our own views of our own Native origins, are (by definition)
“unscientific,” “unproven,” “legends” and “tales” and unreliable
undocumented “myths.”

Our elders say that three “theories” of our origins include the following: (1)
first and foremost is that our people emerged out of Mother Earth at a
beautiful ancient Choctaw site near Philadelphia, Mississippi, known as
“Nanih Waiya” (“Leaning Mountain”). It is a stark soil mound physically,
but it is a “beautiful place” for us, spiritually! Inwardly! Ancestrally! It is an
earthen mound that is now protected by the state of Mississippi as a state
park. We say it is being “protected” from archaeologists that want to dig up
anything they can find, if it might contain Indian burials.

In our language, we have a beautiful origin statement: “ Hopaki fibna kask,
hattak at atoba ammona kat Nanih Waiyah.” “The place where man (hattak )
[meaning all peoples, men and women] came into being a long time ago was
Nanih Waiyah.” You see, right there is a good example. In English, “man”
is the generic term for “people” — yet it is a decidedly male-dominated
cultural matrix out of which English emerged. Not so with most of our
Native languages.

A second origin belief (not “myth,” mind you) is that our ancient ancestors
came down from ancient American earthen mound civilizations such as
Cahokia and migrated into the Southeast. Many of our tribe truly believe
that we are descended from Cahokia, but scientists can’t prove or disprove
it. And they certainly won’t even countenance our explanation, either.
Cahokia flourished from about 400 to 1450 CE and much of it still exists,
many earthen mounds in an ancient metropolis whose ruins are located not
far from St. Louis, MO and Collinsville, IL. A third possible explanation
from our elders states that — instead of migrating from Siberia through the
Bering Straights, down through Alaska, Canada to Mississippi — our own
ancestors came north from the Maya regions, boating up through the Gulf of
Mexico, up into what is now Mississippi untold thousands of years ago.

[B U C K ] Yes, I see the problem here. These Bering Strait discussions
proceed from one major assumption: That the “aboriginal” peoples of North

America were not “original” in that their physical and cultural origins are
derivative. That assumption must be looked squarely in the eye for what it
really is. And its limitations must be acknowledged as well.

In any event, the indigenous religions of North America have their own
history, development, and character — entirely distinct from any Bering
Straits hypothesis. In other words, if we bracket the question of origins, it’s
quite clear that the subsequent history and development of Native American
traditions is an entirely separate matter altogether.

Now let us consider the possibility that “families of religions” had existed
independently on continents that, until relatively recently, had little or no
contact — and even less possibility of religious influence or syncretism —
as ‘Abdu’l-Bahá has stated in the Tablet of the “Seven Candles of Unity”:
“Continents remained widely divided, nay even among the peoples of one
and the same continent association and interchange of thought were well-
nigh impossible. Consequently intercourse, understanding and unity
amongst all the peoples and kindreds of the earth were unattainable.”86 On
the basis of Bahá’í texts taken together, we have firm acknowledgement of
at least three “families” of religions and Manifestations — and, now,
possibly four:

> 1.        Pre-Semitic: Melchizedek, Adam, Noah).
> 2.        Semitic/A brahamic: Moses, Jesus, Muhammad.
> 3.        A ryan: Krishna, Zoroaster, Buddha.
4.        Native A merican/Native C anadian: White Buffalo Calf

Woman, Deganawidah (tentatively).

While I won’t say that this list is complete or more representative than
previous Bahá’í lists — which consist of Semitic and Aryan Prophets
combined — this one widens the circle and further universalizes Bahá’í
universalism, I dare say.

[A D D ISO N] I have long been puzzled by so many Bahá’ís who say they are
open-minded, but don’t really want to commit themselves to saying Indians
had real Manifestations of Gods or at least “Major” Prophets of God! What
about a known and named Native Messenger of God, like Deganawidah.
Haven’t you presented him as a “test case” for Bahá’í recognition?

[B U C K ] Yes, I certainly have. But first, let me say a few words about the
process of evaluating the qualifications or judging the authenticity of
anyone claiming to be a Messenger of God. Discussing the “prophetic
credentials” of a claimant is a proper religious and scholarly inquiry. Let me
explain. Such an inquiry serves to establish or disqualify the prophetic

warrants of a claimant according to specified criteria from within a Bahá’í,
Christian, Islamic or other perspective. While scholarship cannot stand in
the shoes of belief or faith, scholars can certainly discuss what has been
called the “phenomenology of revelation” and study how such
characteristics are exemplified by any given religious figure. Thus, whether
from a scholarly or a religious perspective, we can examine the “prophetic
credentials” of a culture-hero such as Deganawidah.

According to Iroquois oral tradition, Deganawidah established the “Great
Law of Peace”87 — arguably the first New World democracy, which one
scholar has dated at August 31, 1142.88 This could well be one of the criteria
of Deganawidah’s authenticity from a Bahá’í perspective, since “every Faith

has given rise to a culture which flowered in different forms.” History and
the problems of dating aside, may I ask how you personally respond to these
words of Deganawidah?

Deganawidah, quoted in P. Wallace, The White Roots of Peace 13–14. According to a note archived
in the Hewitt Papers, the Great Law is comprised of three dual concepts:

The League of the Iroquois was founded on six basic principles … But these six principles … were
expressed by (only) three terms, each of which denoted two of these underlying principles. These three terms are:
Ne? Skannon?, ne?, ga: i?hwiyo, and ga?shasdenhsen?. The first as applied to the body politic denotes peace,
tranquility, rest; but as applied to the human or living body of flesh and blood, it denotes health or soundness,
normal functional condition. War, strife, contention is the antithesis of the first meaning; and disease, illness,
obsession or possession by another personality, especially … through … sorcery [is the antithesis] of the second
meaning. Here we have the maximum extension and intention in the connotation of a term.

The second term is ga: i?hwi yo, which is not so easy of translation into English. Its first denotation is
gospel, wholesome doctrine, what is good to be heard, ethical teaching, values, ethics — righteousness. As its
second meaning, it denotes justice, right, as formulated in the customs, manners, religion, and ritualistic
summations of the past experience of the people. The first is the teaching of a good doctrine; the second is the
establishment of the good doctrine in institutional forms.

The third is ga?shasdensa?, whose first denotation is force, as expressed in the war power of the
people; and its second meaning is the power, force or authority of the orenda or magic potency of the institutions
of the people. It was at this point only that religion … exerted its influence on the organic units of the social
structure.

The institutions arising from these six fundamental principles or conceptions were together called
Kaenensha?go: na, or the Great Commonwealth of Law.

[A D D ISO N] To me, these words are magnificent. They ring as true to me
as the words of Bahá’u’lláh Himself. And I know that at least a few other
Bahá’ís feel the same way. What does your experience in these matters
reveal?

[B U C K ] Quite true! Why else would Dr. David S. Ruhe publicly proclaim?

And of course the Iroquois foreshadowed, in their Longhouse of sky

and earth, the planetary Message of the Bahá’í Faith for today.

[B U C K ] If this new approach might be tried out as an experiment — that is,
the recognition, acknowledgement, and validation of Indigenous prophets
on the part of the Bahá’í community (whether officially or at the level of
praxis) — what social benefits might accrue? What do you foresee?

[A D D ISO N] Alex Poorman, a Cree Bahá’í of the Poorman Reserve, said, in
reference to the first National Bahá’í Convention Indians that he had
attended in Canada, “[W]hen the diversity of the human race comes
together, there’s a tremendous power released. And this was the first time
that this had happened in Canada, where we have two different cultures, the

Native people, and the people that had come from Europe. Two cultures and

we came together in the Bahá’í Faith.’” A review of research into the
growth of the Bahá’í Faith around the world, published in 2000, concludes:
“As community after community steadily awakens to the possibility of unity
in diversity, the pain caused by centuries of racial and ethnic violence is
being openly acknowledged and addressed, and the first glimmerings of

healing can be discerned.” This healing process, which is ongoing and ever
widening, is also a major contributing factor that will ensure that Native
American peoples and cultures, with the flute performances and powwow
dancing of culture-bearers such as Kevin Locke, will survive.

[B U C K ] Yes. Kevin Locke makes this very point when he said in an
interview:

> embracing world civilization. So there is no need to deny or negate
> or invalidate each other’s spiritual heritage.”96

Note here that this official Baha’í publication ( One Country is the
“Newsletter of the Bahá’í International Community”) goes on record to state
that the Bahá’í “Faith…teaches that there is only one God and that all of the
world’s religions, including many indigenous ones, are expressions of the
same ancient and eternal faith.” Not many Bahá’ís are actually aware of this
representation — this crucial nuance — of the Bahá’í doctrine of
“Progressive Revelation.”

[A D D ISO N] Please elaborate on this line of reasoning.

[B U C K ] The Bahá’í teachings embody what has been termed a “theory of
civilization.” In fine, the Bahá’í perspective, as I understand it, inextricably
links social evolution with spiritual evolution. In other words, civilization
cannot progress without Progressive Revelation. Social evolution would
have no generative force were it not for the regenerative forces released by
these charismatic spiritual geniuses — Native Messengers of God, Krishna,
Moses, Zoroaster, Christ, Muhammad, the Báb, and Bahá’u’lláh, to name a
few — who punctuate history to create the moral and social foundations for
the advancement of civilization.

Kevin Locke also speaks of the prophecies of White Buffalo Calf Woman as
having been fulfilled by the advent of Bahá’u’lláh. How, then, are Native
prophecies possible without Native Prophets?

[A D D ISO N] Point well-taken!

[B U C K ] For each and every Lakota Bahá’í I’ve read about or met, White
Buffalo Calf Woman is clearly a Messenger of God. Would you agree?

[A D D ISO N] Yes, absolutely.

[B U C K ] The presence of Lakota Bahá’ís is part of the diversity that so
greatly enriches the Bahá’í world community. Yet there exists some real
confusion on the part of many Bahá’ís, who are either at a loss as to how to
integrate the rich religious diversity that Native Americans bring to the
Bahá’í experience of unity in diversity. Some Bahá’ís are locked into an
“Arya-Semiticentric” — to coin your improvement of my neologism,
“Semiticentrism,” Don — worldview, such that no authentic Prophets can
have ever existed (unless “unnamed” and therefore unproblematic) outside
of the Semitic (i.e., Judaism, Christianity, Islam) and Aryan (i.e., Hinduism,
Zoroastrianism, Buddhism) families of religions. How do we clear up this

“Hoop dancing and world citizenship: meet Kevin Locke” One Country 8.2 (July–Sept. 1996).

(Emphasis added.)

confusion, Don? What insights do your have to offer, from a Native
perspective?

[A D D ISO N] Well, for one thing, don’t the Native American religions
represent another distinct “family of religions,” just like the Semitic and
Aryan religions, as you have rightly pointed out? I think you had previously
made that point in your 1996 “Native Messengers” paper. But let me talk
about the “extended family” of Native peoples worldwide.

More broadly, the consciousness of interrelatedness of all indigenous
peoples would quickly clear up this confusion. This interrelatedness of
Native peoples has inspired some films done by our late Bahá’í brother, and
my Choctaw brother, Phil Lucas, who just passed away in Issaquah,
Washington. Watch those films. He, for example, links up the Seri of
Tiburon Island (Mexico), with the Kwakiutl of Canada’s Northwest
Territories, with the Maori of New Zealand, with the Aborigines of
Australia. He called them, “Storytellers of the Pacific Rim,” and this film

documentary was broadcast on “Identity” — which I use in all the cultural
anthropology classes I teach.

I believe what Bahá’u’lláh says about the Prophets of God must include
Native Prophets. This should pose no threat to Bahá’ís who carry more
traditional views. I can tell you that I was physically present when I heard
Jacqueline Left Hand Bull (now Chair of the National Spiritual Assembly of
the Bahá’ís of the United States) refer, almost as a side note, that, to her,
Bahá’u’lláh represents the “Promised Return of the White Buffalo Calf
Woman.” She made no further issue of it at all! In fact, I personally
witnessed Jacqueline say that she believes Bahá’u’lláh is the Return of
White Buffalo Calf Woman at two Bahá’í events: once when she spoke at
an Association for Bahá’í Studies conference, and a second time at a Native
Bahá’í gathering at the Brighton Creek Conference Center grounds near
Yelm, Washington.98 I should highlight the fact that her comments at both
events were very natural, that she didn’t go into any further detail about this
statement, that she didn’t appear to sense that anyone in either audience
would object. It was a very matter-of-fact statement. Since she saw no need
to explain or defend it, she didn’t offer any further discussion or “proof.”
She just made a simple statement of faith and personal conviction — as if
all in the hall would understand — and that was that! I’ve never heard other
Lakotas (whether Bahá’í or not) try to “fill in the blanks” and get others to
acknowledge that White Buffalo Calf Woman was a real prophet! It’s
almost irrelevant.

> 97 See Storytellers of the Pacific : Identity (1996).

98 See also a published statement to this effect: “The Return of the ‘White Buffalo Calf Woman’:
Prophecy of the Lakota,” interview of Counsellor Jacqueline Left Hand Bull by U.S. National Spiritual Assembly
member, Patricia Locke (Lakota) in 1989.

Bahá’ís in every community trace their descent to any number of various
ethnic and cultural backgrounds. In fact, the lack of any one dominant
cultural community or perspective in the Bahá’í Faith clearly illustrates its
all-embracing nature, and Native Americans quickly notice this
characteristic of Bahá’í communities. At the international level, Amoz

Gibson, who descended from Native American, African American, and
Scottish Irish ancestry, was elected, at the Royal Albert Hall in London in
1963, to the first Universal House of Justice, which has established its Seat

on Mount Carmel in Israel. Native peoples were elated and deeply moved
when this happened, because Gibson’s election to that august institution
became a clear and powerful demonstration that Bahá’ís were putting the
Bahá’í teachings into practice.

More importantly, most American Indian Bahá’ís are more invested in the
discussions of how we can help our Euro-American Bahá’í brothers and
sisters better appreciate the gifts that we (Natives and Euro-Americans) can
contribute together to the accomplishment of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s great
prophecy.

[B U C K ] Let’s talk about the importance of cultural diversity as a shared
communally shared value. Article 1 of UNESCO’s Universal Declaration
on Cultural Diversity states: “Cultural diversity is as necessary for
humankind as biodiversity is for nature.” Would you agree when I say?:
“Cultural diversity is as necessary for the Bahá’í community as it is for
humanity at large.”

I really appreciate this statement: “For some, it is the fact that the teachings
of the Faith emphasize the importance of preserving Native cultures.” It
should become a more pronounced — and practiced — Bahá’í principle.
Not everything in our indigenous cultures should be preserved. But, here,
unity should stress cultural preservation (survival), not assimilation
(extinction), even though a “world culture” will likely emerge, coefficient
with the kind of world unity that Bahá’ís have been advocating all along.

[B U C K ] In keeping with what you have said, there has been an official or
semi-official Bahá’í endorsement of precisely this perspective. In fact, the
Canadian Bahá’í pamphlet, The Right to An Identity, is one of the most
remarkable Bahá’í documents I’ve seen. It states, in part:

> Our hope is that Canada will be the first nation on earth to give
> practical force to the most fundamental right of all: the right of every
> citizen to be what God has made him.

> Some of the steps which can contribute to such a breakthrough are:
•  Recruitment of native Canadians as teachers and teaching

assistants.
•  Kindergarten and some primary instruction in the native

language of the children.
•  Development of courses of study covering the entire religious

heritage of mankind.

> •  Involvement of Indian youth in Canada’s overseas aid programs.
•  Inclusion of the right to a cultural identity in any civil rights

entrenched in the Constitution.102

Note here the proposal for a new constitutional right to be added to the
Canadian Constitution! Also note the recommending of the “[d]evelopment
of courses of study covering the entire religious heritage of mankind” —
which presumably adumbrates Native Canadian and Native American
religions. Does it stand to reason that whatever the Bahá’í community
proposes for adoption as a fundamental right — whether under
constitutional law or under international law — the Bahá’í community
ought to accept for itself? What do you think, Don?

for every single student! They loved it! As for striking a symmetry between
between our own practices and those which we propose that governments,
such as Canada, ought to adopt, it seems perfectly obvious to me that we are
obligated to practice what we preach. So, we ought to recognize “the right to
a cultural identity” as a Bahá’í principle and we ought to develop “courses
of study covering the entire religious heritage of mankind” — curricula that
recognize and include Native Canadian and Native American religions.
Imagine — when a Bahá’í community like Canada takes a visible position
of advocacy for Native rights and recognition of Native religions — how
else can we escape a charge of ideological duplicity unless we ourselves
model such noble principles as these! Isn’t that what you and I are partly
endeavoring to accomplish in this collaboration of ours?

[B U C K ] Dr. Addison, friend and colleague, yes, I wholeheartedly agree. I
guess that’s why this conversation has been important. We should probably
bring this discussion to a close. I can tell you that I am certainly not alone
among Bahá’í scholars in reading ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s Tablet to Amír Khán as
providing independently sufficient warrant for “Messengers of God to First
Nations” as a valid Baha’í principle. For instance, let me introduce my
friend and colleague, Dr. Necati Alkan, who is currently a visiting scholar in
Bahá’í studies at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. In 2004, Dr. Alkan
successfully defended his doctoral dissertation, The Bábí and Bahá’í
Religions in the Ottom an E mpire and Turkey, 1844–1928, at the Ruhr-
Universität Bochum. In 1998, he completed his Master’s thesis, Die Bahá’í-
Religion und ihre Beziehung zu den islamischen Reformbewegungen a m
Ausgang des Osmanischen Reiches, 1860–1922.103

Dr. Alkan, what is your reading of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s Tablet to Amír Khán? In
your professional and personal opinion, and based on your knowledge of the
Bahá’í source languages of Persian, Arabic, and Turkish — together with
your investigation of ancillary, authoritative Bahá’í statements that bear on
the question that we now have before us — is this a clear Text?

[A L K A N] As to the text in the Tablet to Amír Khán, for me it sounds clear
that Prophets must have appeared in America in ancient times. Otherwise
why would ‘Abdu’l-Bahá say “the Call of God must have been raised in
ancient times”? Who else, if not a Prophet/Messenger, raised the “Call of
God”? I do not see a problem when ‘Abdu’l-Bahá says that the “must have
been raised” and, on the basis of this clear statement, effectively admits
Native American Messengers of God into the line of “our” Prophets. You
discuss this all in your article clearly.104

Dr. Alkan’s curriculum vita may be accessed at online and a list of his publications is also available.

Dr. Necati Alkan, e-mail, dated 27 May 2007, in reply to Dr. Christopher Buck. Slightly edited and
cited with permission. The statement, “You discuss this all in your article clearly,” refers to the article, Christopher
Buck, “Native Messengers of God in Canada?: A Test Case for Bahá’í Universalism.” idem, “Bahá’í
Universalism and Native Prophets.”

My reading is based both on the Persian reading and English translation.
Only a Prophet/Messenger can “nida-yi ilahi buland gashtih” — raise the
Call of God! And I checked Shoghi Effendi’s translation of the word “ al-
battih”: he translates it as “without doubt”, “no doubt”, “of a certainty”,
“unfailingly”, “surely”, “most certainly”, etc.105 I really do not know what
the problem is with stating that there were Prophets sent to the First Nations.
I would base my arguments on the following reasons:

1.  ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s statement in the Tablet to Amír Khán is

> unambiguous. Who else than Prophets or Messengers can raise
> the Call of God?
2. According to ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, only 28 prophets (anbíyá’) are

> mentioned in the Qur’an by name. There are many others who
> are unnamed.
3. The Qur’an says: “And there never was a people, without a

> Warner having lived among them (in the past).” (Q. 35:24); and
> “… to every people a guide” (Q. 13:7).
4. Shoghi Effendi states that the nine religions that Bahá’ís

> regularly speak of is sufficient yet not exhaustive. Consider this
> statement: “The number nine, which in itself is the number of
> perfection, is considered by the Bahá’ís as sacred, because it is
> symbolic of the perfection of the Bahá’í Revelation which
> constitutes the ninth in the line of existing religions, the latest
> and fullest Revelation which mankind has ever known. The
> eighth is the religion of the Báb and the remaining seven are:
> Hinduism, Buddhism, Zoroastrianism, Judaism, Christianity,
> Islám, and the religion of the Sabaeans. These religions are not
> the only true religions that have appeared in the world but are the
> only ones still existing. There have always been Divine Prophets
> and Messengers, to many of whom the Qur’án refers. But the
> only ones existing are those mentioned above.”106

This statement must not be read dogmatically and exclusively, for

> Shoghi Effendi hastens to add: “The Guardian feels that with
> intellectuals and students of religion the question of exactly
> which are the nine existing religions is controversial, and it
> would be better to avoid it. He does not want the friends to be
> rigid in these matters, but use their judgment and tact, sometimes
> one statement is exactly the right thing for one type of mind and
> the wrong thing for another.”107

These ancillary texts provide strong support for the argument based on the
Tablet to Amír Khán. To be honest, in light of this clear Text that has now
surfaced and come to light, I fail to see why some Bahá’í scholars still
object to the idea of Native American Prophets.110

In conclusion, it is my professional and personal opinion that ‘Abdu’l-
Bahá’s Tablet to Amír Khán provides a sufficiently clear text to warrant
“Messengers of God to First Nations” as a valid Bahá’í principle. I will be
happy if you would extract my comments from my e-mails and add it to the
conversation between you and Dr. Addison.111

[A D D ISO N] Yakoke! Dr. Alkan, for providing this independent attestation!

[B U C K ] Dr. Addison, let me recapitulate what I understand to be our
collaborative and conversive thesis and reasoning here. In the Tablet to
Amír Khán, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá is speaking about two distinct, yet interrelated
subjects: the question of migration and then the question of revelation.
Although we do not have the exact questions posed by Amir Khan, ‘Abdu’l-
Bahá’s reply should be accounted as an answer to the question of crossing
and communication, including the issue of whether there was any religious
influence as a result of this migration. I agree with you, Don, that ‘Abdu’l-
Bahá is simply acknowledging the currency of this theory without endorsing
it. First, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá acknowledges that a migration across the Bering
Straits has been postulated by scholars. I would concede that ‘Abdu’l-Bahá
cites this theory with tacit approval, but only to the extent that migration
may well have occurred. Forgive the pun, but the Bering Straits have little
or no “bearing” on Native American religions.

[A D D ISO N] In fact, the Bering Straits theory is reductive, not productive. I
might add that other Native scholars say much the same thing. Lakota

author and scholar, Vine Deloria, Jr., has written extensively on this in Red
Earth, White Lies: Native Americans and the Myth of Scientific F act .112 So
has Devon Mihesuah, associate professor of American Indian history,
Northern Arizona University, Flagstaff, and member of the Choctaw Nation
of Oklahoma, who states that the stereotype that “Indians arrived in this
hemisphere via the Siberian land bridge” is simply not what Indians, on the
whole, believe. The reality, she says, is that “Indians believe that they were
created in this hemisphere.”113

[B U C K ] Yes, the Bering Straits theory treats Native American spirituality
as a genetic question. In focusing almost exclusively on origins, it
practically excludes the question of development, doesn’t it? In any event,
simple logic rules out genetic arguments that would suggest that Native
American religions are derivative as a consequence of the Bering Straits
migrations. Consider:

Despite truth-claims of Mormon doctrine to the contrary, scholars have
found no trace of Western religious influence — whether that of
Judaism, Zoroastrianism, Christianity, or Islam — on the American
continent before the European conquest and colonization of the
Americas. Nor, for that matter, are there any pre-Columbian relics or
doctrinal vestiges of the so-called Eastern religions, such as Buddhism, to be
found in the Americas.

The verb “forgotten” (farámush shudih ast) in the Tablet to Amír
Khán, therefore, is not related to those religions, for the simple reason that
the utter lack of evidence clearly shows that these religions did not enter the
Americas — whether in antiquity or in the medieval period — prior to the
European conquest and colonization.

[A D D ISO N] This is an argument from silence, with which I agree.

[B U C K ] Yes, the silence is resounding, isn’t it? In addition to this
argumentum ex nihilo, we also have Qur’ánic arguments and terminological
arguments as well.

Now let’s revisit the Qur’ánic text that ‘Abdu’l-Bahá adduced. In citing the
verse of the Qur’án, “We will not chastise them if they had not been sent a
Messenger” (Q. 17:15), ‘Abdu’l-Bahá invokes traditional Islamic reasoning
to register a key point: By implication, this verse implies that North
America has been the scene of the advent of Native Messengers of God

Vine Deloria, Jr., Red Earth, White Lies: Native Americans and the Myth of Scientific F act (Reissue
edn.: Fulcrum Publishing, 1997), at 67–91, and passi m at xi, 6, 31, 33, 47, 55, 93, 94, 95, 161, 196–197, and 211.
Deloria underscores the absolute lack of Indian oral tradition about such a migration at pp. 81–83, and suggests
alternative theories at pp. 33–34 and 59–60, not to mention the general lack of evidence for the Bering Straits
theory at pp. 58–62, 70–73, and 91, with topographical factors in opposition to such a migration at pp. 72–76.

Press, 1998), 46.

since other Qur’anic passages, in relation to this verse, clearly testify that
God has sent a Messenger to every nation (umm ah) (Q. 10:47; cf. 35:24).
Thus a whole-to-part deduction obtains here. This doctrinal evidence from
the Qur’án necessitates the advent of the Native Manifestations of God
specifically for the “people of America” (ahl-i Amrík), as ‘Abdu’l-Bahá
explicitly indicates in the Tablet to Amír Khán.

Bahá’u’lláh points to Qur’anic universalisms as well, as Dr. Alkan has
already noted. We can extend this reasoning geographically and historically,
even though this is a religious argument rather than an archaeological or
historical one. In His Commentary on the Surah of the Sun, after explaining
that by al-shams (“sun”) is meant the Manifestation of God, Bahá’u’lláh
affirms the truth of Q. 10:47 and parallels: “Then, in another station, it
referreth to the Prophets and Pure Ones of God, for They are the Suns of
His names and attributes amidst His creation. Were it not for Them, no one
would have been illumined by the mystical knowledge of God. As thou
canst see, every nation on earth hath been enlightened by one of these
brightly shining Suns. Whoso denieth Them remaineth deprived.”114 In this
statement, Bahá’u’lláh declares that Messengers of God have appeared to
every one of the peoples of earth, although in sundry times and places.
Obviously this includes, inter alia , Native Americans and Native Canadians,
as ‘Abdu’l-Bahá clearly affirms in the Tablet to Amír Khán.

[A D D ISO N] This traditional Islamic argument, as made by both
Bahá’u’lláh and ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, makes eminent sense as well. Note that
‘Abdu’l-Bahá applies this reasoning specifically to North America.

[B U C K ] In addition to arguments from silence and Islamic reasoning, we
can point to a terminological argument as well. We’ve already demonstrated
that the “Call of God” (nidá-yi iláhí ) is a Bábí and Bahá’í euphemism for
Manifestations of God, or, derivatively, in reference to belief in or
promulgation of Their teachings. By the phrase of the “Call of God” is
definitely meant the advent of “Manifestations of God” — or, derivatively,
recognition and promulgation of Their Teachings — as I’ve demonstrated in
the various Bahá’í texts that we’ve previously adduced. The Bahá’í
meanings attached to this term are all unified by reference to divine
Manifestations or the divine Teachings that emanate from Them.

Thus, in this Tablet, the phrase, “the Call of God” is not referring to the Call
of God raised by the promulgators of previous religions, because their
adherents never reached the Americas in pre-Columbian times in the first
place. If such were the case, then we would expect to find a few vestiges, at
least, of such cultural influences, even admixed with superstitions. Yet this
expectation has never been met.

Adapted from translation by J. Cole of Bahá’u’lláh’s Commentary on the Surah of the Sun (Ames,
Iowa: Omphaloskepsis, 2000) at 10–11

[A D D ISO N] Yes, the fact is that we have precious few artifacts that suggest
such religious influence should indicate that Native American religious
possess their own distinctive character.

[B U C K ] Yes, in our argument from silence, we’ve already noted that there
is no trace of such putative religious influence from Siberia on North
America, except perhaps for shamanism. This can just as easily be explained
as a parallel development. In any case, no prior influences are sufficient to
account for the teachings of Deganawidah, which are remarkable in that
they are as original as they are fully consonant with Bahá’í teachings.
Would you agree?

[A D D ISO N] Deganawidah’s religious teachings are quite advanced — a far
cry from the inauthentic, to be sure.

[B U C K ] Quite so. Now let’s review our geographical argument: Reflect on
this emphatic statement by ‘Abdu’l-Bahá: “Undoubtedly in those regions
the Call of God must have been raised in ancient times, but it hath been
forgotten now.”115 The words, “Undoubtedly in those regions” (al-battih dar
án s.afahát) indicates either North America in particular or the Americas in
general (and so, both). This phrase obviously cannot mean Asia, since
Manifestations of God had already appeared in Asia.

[A D D ISO N] ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s reference to North America is explicit
textually and patent contextually.

[B U C K ] I’d say that you are living proof of that point, Don! Now let’s
review another argument from silence: diminished influence. The verb
“forgotten” (farámush shudih ast) scarcely means obliterated. Rather, in
most cases, “forgotten” means diminished influence, not total
disappearance. That having been said, I must concede a sad fact of history:
It is true that some Native religions have became extinct whenever language
and culture were eradicated, which is a tragic outcome of much of the
history of Indian Country. Nevertheless, I believe that what ‘Abdu’l-Bahá
primarily means here is that the teachings and influence of these Native
Manifestations of God has waxed and waned. They longer possess the
currency and influence that They once enjoyed.

[A D D ISO N] Yes, I’ve already spoken of how some of our Choctaw
traditions have largely disappeared, although the cultural values and wisdom
that these have imparted are woven into the fabric of who we are as a
people.

‘Abdu’l-Bahá, Tablet to Amír Khán Áhan of Tehran, This text appears at the top of the page at 2-47

[B U C K ] Now let’s recap our exegesis with a rhetorical argument: ‘Abdu’l-
Bahá uses the adverb, “undoubtedly” ( al-battih) with such rhetorical force
that we cannot doubt His word that the “Call of God” was raised in
America. If our interpretation that the “Call of God” essentially means
“Manifestation of God,” then ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s rhetorical use of
“undoubtedly” raises the the appearance of Native Manifestations of God to
a level of doctrinal certainty!

[A D D ISO N] Yes. We cannot take this statement lightly. It is definitive. I
cannot escape this conclusion in my reading of this Tablet.

[B U C K ] And so, in light of our informally logical, Islamic, terminological,
and rhetorical arguments, here is the interpretive challenge: Is the Tablet to
Amír Khán this a “clear Text” or not? Although whatever ‘Abdu’l-Bahá is
stating is stated forcefully, I concede that no consensus has yet emerged as
to whether ‘Abdu’l-Bahá is referring to Native Manifestations of God or
otherwise. Eleven years ago, in 1996, this Text was admittedly not “clear”
enough for the Universal House of House to make an official
pronouncement (either way) at that time.

[A D D ISO N] Times can change. What about now, in 2007?

[B U C K ] Perhaps in the near future, God-willing, the the Universal House of
House might revisit this question in light of a fuller analysis by the Research
Department of the Tablet to Amír Khán — possibly in reference to the
detailed textual and contextual analysis that you and I have offered here.

[A D D ISO N] So the question is still open? Certainly this issue is still alive.

[B U C K ] Well, we can at least proceed from the fact that the House says, in
its letter cited after the English translation, that while there is nothing in the
Writings that definitively establishes “Messengers of God to First Nations,”
there is nothing in the Writings to deny it.

[A D D ISO N] I’d say that what we are proposing is relatively new and
controversial — yet of far-reaching and profound importance for Native
teaching. This question again stands before us as a Bahá’í community, and
deserves our serious reconsideration, rather than brusque dismissal, which is
what I’ve seen in recent discussions of this question online, where you were
more or less pilloried in cyberspace.

[B U C K ] That comes with the territory of presenting anything that’s novel
and new. Still, in covering new doctrinal territory, and in pushing the
frontiers of Bahá’í universalism, you and I have stood our ground.

[A D D ISO N] Are you as certain of your reading of the Tablet of Amír Khán
in 2007 as you were in 1996 when your “Native Messengers” paper was

first published, or as you were in 1994 when you first publicly presented it
at the Association for Bahá’í Studies conference at Harvard?

[B U C K ] Yes. And Dr. David S. Ruhe, who was there and came to my
defense during the vigorous discussion that followed, inspired in me even
greater confidence.

After serious study of this text for well over a decade, I have scholarly and
spiritual certitude that ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s use of the term, the “Call of God,” is
a clear reference to Manifestations of God, since every single text where this
expression occurs warrants — if not compels — the conclusion that the
“Call of God” (nidá-yi-iláhí ) is clearly a Bábí and Bahá’í euphemism for
Manifestations of God, or, derivatively, for a belief in or promulgation of
Their teachings, as I’ve previously stated.

In fine, the Tablet to Amír Khán is, in my estimation, a sufficiently clear
text that enunciates what amounts to a newly-discovered Bahá’í teaching
that Native Manifestations of God have definitely appeared in the Americas.
On its surface, the Tablet to Amír Khán appears to be a piece of
correspondence of relatively minor importance, yet which, in actuality, is a
unique text. For out of the entire corpus of Bábí and Bahá’í sacred Texts,
this is the only definitive and authoritative Bahá’í statement on the issue of
Native Manifestations of God raised up in the Americas.

[A D D ISO N] And how does this all tie in with ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s “sole racial
prophecy” (as Chelsea Horton has characterized it) of the destiny of
American Indians to enlighten the world?

[B U C K ] As you well know, another singular text is the Tablets of the
Divine Plan, where ‘Abdu’l-Bahá states: “Attach great importance to the
indigenous population of America. For these souls may be likened unto the
ancient inhabitants of the Arabian Peninsula, who, prior to the Mission of
Muhammad, were like unto savages. When the light of Muhammad shone
forth in their midst, however, they became so radiant as to illumine the
world. Likewise, these Indians, should they be educated and guided, there
can be no doubt that they will become so illumined as to enlighten the
whole world.”116 Underscoring the fact that this statement is without parallel
in other Bahá’í texts, the Research Department concludes: “The Master’s
likening of the indigenous Americans to the pre-Islamic Arabs, which is
described in His Tablets of the Divine Plan, is not noticed in His other
works.”117

Bahá’ís of the United States and Canada. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, Tablets of the Divine Plan (Wilmette, Illinois: U.S.
Bahá’í Publishing Trust, 1993) 33.

See Appendix One, infra .

Since ‘Abdu’l-Bahá compared the American Indians to the ancient Arabs,
then the appearance of Native Manifestations of God — such as Chah-
Tah,118 — the Prophet of your people, the Choctaw Nation — White
Buffalo Calf Woman, and Deganawidah — would complete the analogy, as
counterparts to Hud, Sálih, and Muhammad.

[A D D ISO N] You’re not suggesting that Deganawidah is the New World
Muhammad?

[B U C K ] No, except that Deganawidah may be a figure of comparable
influence in the New World.

[A D D ISO N] Granted. But where does this line of reasoning lead?

[B U C K ] Bear in mind that we are basically arguing for recognition of a
Bahá’í principle of First Nations Manifestations, not necessarily a
concomitant recognition of the principals (names of these Manifestations),
even though we can certainly acknowledge and honor their mention, such as
that of Deganawidah, just as the late Dr. David S. Ruhe stated, which I
quote once more: “To the warring tribes 700–800 years ago there came an
astonishing Prophet of Peace — Deganawidah united five, later six,
mutually hostile tribal groups in a federal union based on democracy, the
first in the Western Hemisphere. He cemented this union with a ‘Great Law
of Peace,’ a constitution which propounded one expansive human family…
And of course the Iroquois foreshadowed, in their Longhouse of sky and
earth, the planetary message of the Bahá’í Faith for today.”

[A D D ISO N] I concur, my good friend, wholeheartedly. And Dr. Ruhe’s
words are worth repeating. But his words never rose to the level of
recognized Bahá’í doctrine, unfortunately.

[B U C K ] You make a good point here. Whether the Bahá’í Faith can
formally recognize Native Messengers of God is as open a question as it is a
vexed question. In her dissertation, Pauline Tuttle (to whom this paper is
also dedicated, along with Dr. David S. Ruhe), wrote:

[A D D ISO N] Is Chelsea Horton correct here?

[B U C K ] She’s entitled to her view, of course. But let me speak in my own
behalf. Just for the record, in my “Native Messengers” paper I did cite a
letter from the Universal House of Justice (in reply to my research
questions) that a pronouncement was impossible to make in the absence of a
“clear Text.” So, with all due respect (sincerely so), I think Pauline missed
the point with respect to my “Native Messengers” paper. It represents some
of the “further research” that the House rightly said needed to be
undertaken. And, now, our exegesis of the Tablet to Amír Khán presents
both still further research and a “clear Text.” Whether our elucidation of this
Text will be sufficiently clear remains to be seen.

[A D D ISO N] I get the sense that what we are doing here is potentially
historic?

[B U C K ] Whether or not this a historic moment remains to be seen. This is
what we have done: We have argued that the principle of “Messengers of
God to First Nations” is based on a sufficiently “clear Text.” We can say
this partly on the basis of the close textual analysis proferred by Dr. Necati
Alkan, among others with whom you and I have previously consulted.

So is with measured confidence that we can say that the Tablet to Amír
Khán promulgates a clear teaching that Native Manifestations of God

Pauline Tuttle, The Hoop of Many Hoops, 188, note 177.

appeared in the Americas. In so saying, we prescind from making any
authoritative pronouncement, as we clearly have no authority to do so.

[A D D ISO N] Yes, we need to make this disclaimer abundantly clear. What
we claim argumentatively, we disclaim as having any authority. Adoption or
formal recognition of our findings would have far-reaching implications for
presenting the Bahá’í Faith anew to Native Americans and Native
Canadians — and potentially to all of the indigenous peoples of the Western
hemisphere. In so saying, we are not stating this definitively, as only the
Universal House of Justice — in its role in elucidating the Bahá’í Writings
— could ever authoritatively validate such a pronouncement on behalf of
the Bahá’í community at large.

[B U C K ] Yes, in law, we call cases that have no precedential authority
merely “persuasive” precedent (also persuasive authority).

[A D D ISO N] Not binding, right?

[B U C K ] Right. Yet the implications of our argument are quite clear,
wouldn’t you say?

[A D D ISO N] Yes, indeed. Let me say, on a formal note, that the application
of our thesis has obvious implications for the Bahá’í teaching work — with
Native American and Native Canadian communities of interest in mind —
as our finding permits an open declaration that Bahá’ís can now proclaim
that Native Manifestations of God are not simply a valid inference from
Qur’anic universalisms, but that Bahá’ís, on the authority of the Tablet to
Amír Khán, can and should — without an ontological commitment to
specific names and personages per se — affirm and honor the central role
that these Wisdom Bearers and Lawgivers have had in the finest traditions
of Native spirituality. And, on a personal note, I have to say that I, along
with many other native American Bahá’ís, have waited for Bahá’í validation
of what we always knew to be true.

[B U C K ] Yes, and the implications of all this for the future course of the
Bahá’í-Native encounter are nothing short of profound! But, in so doing,
aren’t you and I — or I myself at least — vulnerable to the criticism that we
are somehow co-opting Native American spirituality — that, indeed,
Bahá’ís who wish to recognize, integrate, or even assimilate elements of
Native sacred tradition are engaging in something that is not only spiritually
inauthentic, eclectic, and syncretistic, but is tantamount to spiritual
imperialism?

[A D D ISO N] By way of a disclaimer, I think it vital to add that Bahá’ís are
not engaged in the ugly business of co-opting Native American spirituality. I
want to make this point very clearly — mainly for the sake of American
Indian readers who know nothing about the Bahá’í Faith. Let me assure our

Native American readers that Bahá’ís are definitely not stealing American
Indian beliefs, rituals, doctrines, ribbon shirts, drumming practices, and
transforming them into some hybrid or amalgam of Bahá’í and Native
religious experience as some other religious movements have done in the
past, like the Ghost Dance, or the Peyote Religion, or the Shaker Church —
all of which are syncretic movements of both Christian and Native
provenance.

Most importantly, as Bahá’ís, we are not a community of Indians and non-
Indians who pretend to speak for Native Americans regarding their own
sacred traditions. I can tell you that an ongoing controversy has raged
among scholars in the academic Study of Religion over this very issue for
some time now, precisely because Euro-American or other non-Indian
scholars have assumed that they have a scholarly prerogative or “right” to
study any American Indian religion that they want and to conclude what
they will as a result of their investigations. Worse still, some non-Native
scholars act as if they themselves are the quintessential experts on
indigenous religions — not Native Americans ourselves! In fine, this
“academic freedom” has, in the transgressive extremity of its overreaching,
led to a certain cultural imperialism borne of overweening academic hubris.
Scholar Lee Irwin has edited a thought-provoking collection of essays on
this scholarly debate, entitled, Native American Spirituality: A Critical
Reader.120

I should hasten to add this critical disclaimer. Under no circumstances are
Bahá’ís ever doing these things or fawing and foisting such grandiose
claims on others. As Bahá’ís, we are not embroiled in or otherwise tainted
by this controversy in any way, and I think it is absolutely vital that we
clarify this for the non-Bahá’í Native American reader — whether a
practicing member of a Native American religion or not. American Indian
scholars sometimes speak of these practitioners as “white shamans” (also
spelled as one word, whiteshamans). Steven Leuthold, assistant professor in
Syracuse University’s School of Art and Design states in his monograph,
Indigenous Aesthetics: Native Art, Media, and Identity, explains that
“whiteshamans” basically manufacture “invented traditions” out of their
own appropriation of Native spirituality, and the result of such
transmogrifying of sacred traditions is a hodge-podge and a monstrosity

I want to add I believe the term “whiteshamanism” is admittedly a racist
term and that Bahá’ís don’t use that term. Bahá’ís will want to understand
why the practices that led to the birth of this term are so offensive to Native
Americans. By the same token, Native Americans need to understand that
Bahá’ís do not in any way condone what these “whiteshamans” are doing.
The problem with these offensive “whiteshamans” is that they typically

Lee Irwin, Native American Spirituality: A Critical Reader (Lincoln, NE & London: University of
Nebraska Press, 2000).

refuse to give up their appropriation of Native practices or their pretense of
being (magically) “authentic” Native spokesmen or so-called “spiritual
guides.” Bahá’ís, under no circumstance, would ever condone the offensive
behavior of these “whiteshamans.” Nor would we condone the misuse of
any other religious ceremony, nor would we want Native peoples to ever
think that Bahá’ís (Indian or not) take on Native Americans beliefs,
ceremonies, ritual art or artifacts, in order to incorporate these into Bahá’í
beliefs and community life. Bahá’ís have done nothing to merit being called
“whiteshamans,” in fact. That would be quite unfair and grossly inaccurate.

Conversely, a word of caution is important here. A Native American Bahá’í,
on the other side of the coin, is not “co-opting” Native beliefs if she or he
sings, for example, an authentic Native American spiritual song at a Bahá’í
event. I, and many other Native Americans, share Native prayers and
spiritual songs at Native and Bahá’í gatherings. This does not compromise
the great respect that we have for the prayers or beliefs of any other
religious tradition on the planet. Bahá’ís maintain respect for all other
religions. Therefore a clear distinction must be made here, so that (non-
Bahá’í) Indians don’t confuse membership and active participation of
genuine American Indians in Bahá’í community activities as cutural
imperialism or misappropriation of Native spirituality.

No tribal tradition forbids the respectful sharing of Native prayers or songs
or drumming, if genuine elders and respected authentic Native spokesmen
do not object to it. As an elder, I’ve often been asked to share Native prayers
at Bahá’í events and I’ve found these prayers always honored and
respectfully received, and never “stolen” by Bahá’ís. I have, however, been
very careful about imprudently sharing Native spiritual beliefs when they
wouldn’t be honorably received. My point here is that Bahá’ís do not
practice what Native Americans find so objectionable in the behavior of so-
called “whiteshamans.”

[B U C K ] Very important points you’ve made, Don. However, not every
non-Native who recognizes and appreciates the importance of Deganawidah
is a “whiteshaman.” Take the U.S. Congress, for instance, which holds that
the Iroquois Confederacy, founded by Deganawidah, helped to shape
American democracy. The Iroquois influence thesis holds that the U.S.
Constitution was largely modeled on the Iroquois Confederacy. This thesis
sparked a vigorous scholarly debate.121 While its historical merits and

demerits continue to be weighed in the balance of historical scrutiny — which
any historical thesis must withstand — the fact remains that Deganawidah is
now part and parcel of the legacy of America.

That it enjoyed some popular support as well is reflected in a Congressional
resolution, passed in 1988. On September 16, 1987, Senator Daniel Inouye
(D-Hawaii) introduced S.Con.Res. 76. On July 11, 1988, similar legislation
was introduced by Representative Morris Udall (D-Arizona) in the House of
Representatives as H.Con.Res. 331. On October 4, 1988 the House passed
H.Con.Res. 331122 — A concurrent resolution to acknowledge the
contribution of the Iroquois Confederacy of Nations to the development of
the United States Constitution and to reaffirm the continuing government-
to-government relationship between Indian tribes and the United States
established in the Constitution — by a vote of 408–8. By voice vote, the
Senate agreed to H.Con.Res. 331 on October 21, 1988.123

In 2007, U.S. Representative Joe Baca and U.S. Senator, Daniel Inouye,
respectively introduced H.R. 3585 and S. 1852: Native American Heritage
Day Act of 2007, “A bill to designate the Friday after Thanksgiving of each
year as ‘Native American Heritage Day’ in honor of the achievements and
contributions of Native Americans to the United States.” This proposed
legislation, in its current draft, acknowledges the contribution of the
Iroquois League of Nations: “Congress finds that … the Founding Fathers
based the provisions of the Constitution on the unique system of democracy
of the Six Nations of the Iroquois Confederacy, which divided powers
among the branches of government and provided for a system of checks and
balances.”124

[A D D ISO N] If the U.S. Congress has recognized the legacy of
Deganawidah, why can’t we as Bahá’ís?

[B U C K ] I quite agree. Let’s see what our readers have to say! I believe that
the Online Journal of Bahá’í Studies invites reader responses.

Dr. Addison, I can say that my contact with your culture has enriched me.
And our collaboration would not have been possible were it not for our
contact having transpired through an inspired vision of intercultural unity,
founded on the bedrock of mutually recognized cultural integrity (that is,
sovereignty, as regards First Nations).

me explain the framework within which I see our work, which is the work

of all those who share the same interests and vision: A mandate for building
bridges with Native peoples was given by Shoghi Effendi, who wrote: “Nor
should any of the pioneers, at this early stage in the upbuilding of Bahá’í
national communities, overlook the fundamental prerequisite for any
successful teaching enterprise, which is to adapt the presentation of the
fundamental principles of their F aith to the cultural and religious
backgrounds, the ideologies, and the temperament of the divers races and
nations whom they are called upon to enlighten and attract.”125 Here, we
have done just that, in adapting “the presentation of the fundamental
principles” of the Bahá’í Faith to the “cultural and religious backgrounds”
of Native Americans and Native Canadians in particular, and to indigenous
peoples in general. We have also done our best to completely avoid “a
purely mercenary approach to religion.”126

But not only have we attempted, in good faith, to do that fine and necessary
work. We have also tried to educate ourselves and our peers — for our own
enlightenment — to see that the wisdom of Native peoples (which must
have derived, al least in part, from Native Messengers of God in the distant
past) is very much on a collective par with the established world religions.
The problem of identifying Native Messengers is not that cut-and-dried by
any means.

Fundamentally, Native religions, unlike Bahá’í Faith and in Abrahamic and
Aryan religions generally, are not “written” traditions. Our religions are oral
traditions and because of this, the passing on of a Native Prophet’s “words”
are typically found in oral tribal histories, in ceremonial “texts,” “songs,”
and, symbolically, in tribal rituals and the like. And these are held extremely
sacred, with tremendous respect and even protocol associated with them.
Yet at least we have established — or endeavored to establish —
recognition of “Messengers of God to First Nations” as an authentic Bahá’í
principle grounded in the Tablet to Amír Khán and in other sacred Bahá’í
texts.

As you say, my good friend and colleague, the Bahá’í teachings adumbrate
the principle of “Messengers of God to First Nations” — without making an
ontological commitment to which principals are within the class of Native
Messengers. Let us hope that the powerful resonances between Native
wisdom and Bahá’í wisdom transcends the issue of “names” and that their
harmonics ring true in the inner ears of the person who sees both traditions
as part and parcel of one universal Message.

We are wisely counseled by Shoghi Effendi with respect to the Bahá’í-
Native encounter — about which Chelsea Dawn Horton has written with

From a letter dated 5 June 1947 written by Shoghi Effendi to the Bahá’ís of the West (emphasis
added), in “Teaching Among Aboriginal and Indigenous People.”

Assembly of the British Isles, ibid.

such great sensitivity and insight — “We should meet them as equals, well-
wishers, people who admire and respect their ancient descent, and who feel
that they will be interested, as we are, in a living religion and not in the dead
forms of present-day churches.”127 As I understand it, this admonition
applies not only to the Bahá’í-Native encounter individually, but
collectively as well. This is where some kind of highly symbolic — and real
— recognition of Native Messengers of God becomes the litmus test of our
own universality and authenticity. Maybe we need to begin to look at other
peoples’ religions as being just as good as our own — and perhaps this will
bring some much needed understanding and appreciation for spiritual
traditions from a wide variety of the world’s diverse religions. I can think of
no better line, in stark contrast to Western exclusivity that is so toxic, that
describes this more clearly than a passage from a prayer of Baha’u’llah: “I
yield Thee such thanks as can … fulfill the needs of the peoples of all

religions.”

And let’s not forget the importance of the Bahá’í-Native encounter, which
should assume more importance than it now has: “He attaches the greatest
importance to teaching the original inhabitants of the Americas the Faith.
‘Abdu’l-Bahá Himself has stated how great are their potentialities, and it is
their right, and the duty of the non-Indian Bahá’ís, to see that they receive
the Message of God for this day.”129 This is described as a “right” that
Native peoples possess — to preserve their respective cultural and spiritual
identities within the global framework of an emergent world civilization that
the Bahá’í world community is now establishing.

Consider this profound parallel: “The Master has likened the Indians in your
countries to the early Arabian Nomads at the time of the appearance of
Muhammad. Within a short period of time they became the outstanding
examples of education, of culture and of civilization for the entire world.
The Master feels that similar wonders will occur today if the Indians are
properly taught and if the power of the Spirit properly enters into their
living.”130 By God! How utterly amazing is this vision! Has the Bahá’í
community forgotten? Has it largely, although not completely, neglected the
sole “specific racial prophecy in all of the Bahá’í scriptures,”131 which is
this: “Attach great importance to the indigenous population of America. For

I’d like to close with excerpts from a column I published in the Eugene
Weekly in 2004:

full classes wherever I am teaching courses on these subjects.

The resurging interest in Native spirituality is not without
controversy, and Native American Bahá’ís are quick to point out their

My dear friend and colleague (“Dr. Buck, I presume?”), you and I — as an
emic/etic team — have engaged in “conversive relationality” whereby both
of us have been transformed. We hope that our readers, too, may experience
some of this reciprocal enlightenment that can result from a truly relational
and potentially transformative dialogue among equals. Furthermore, the
implications for further research are patently obvious: If generalizable, our
hypothesis and argument invite research on the issue of Indigenous
Manifestations of God among Oceanic, Australasian, African, and other
indigenous peoples.

Dear Bahá’í Friend,

Your email letters of 25 April and 22 May 2007, inquiring about the
recipient of a Tablet of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, have been received at the Bahá’í World
Centre and forwarded to the Research Department for study.

The Research Department confirms that ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s original Tablet,
part of which was published in Amr va Khalq, volume 2 (Hofheim: Bahá’í-
Verlag, 1985), pages 45 and 46, was addressed to Amír Khán of Tihrán. A
copy of that Tablet was sent to you as an attachment to a memorandum dated
16 May 1996 written by the Research Department at the instruction of the
Universal House of Justice. An additional copy of that material is enclosed for
your study.

As the name of the recipient of the Tablet is not cited in the above-
mentioned memorandum, you may wish to change the wording of the source
of your published footnote to read, “An attachment of the Research
Department memorandum dated 16 May 1996”.

With loving Bahá’í greetings,

T ablet of the Holy Mariner;
the “Call of God” and Native Messengers
In his electronic mail messages dated 15 November 1995 and 22

November 1995 to the Universal House of Justice, Mr. Christopher Buck
requests certain materials concerning the Tablet of the Holy Mariner and
raises questions about an extract from a Tablet revealed by ‘Abdu’l-Bahá to
which reference is made in memoranda prepared by the Research Department
on 25 August 1994, 24 May 1988 and 22 October 1995. We respond as
follows.

1\.       T ablet of the Holy Mariner

As Mr. Buck requested, we attach a photocopy of the original of the
section of this Tablet that was revealed in the Persian language together with
a short list of references from the Writings of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, from God Passes
By, and from letters written on behalf of Shoghi Effendi concerning the Tablet
of the Holy Mariner. To date, no English translation of the Persian section of
this Tablet is available at the Bahá’í World Centre. However, a brief summary
of the contents of this Tablet may be found in Adib Taherzadeh’s The
Revelation of Bahá’u’lláh, rev. ed. (Oxford: George Ronald, 1988), volume 1,
page 243.

2\.     Tablet Revealed by ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, in A mr va K halq, volume 2,
pages 45-46

We attach for Mr. Buck a copy of the original of the Tablet revealed
by ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, part of which is published in Amr va Khalq, volume 2,
pages 45–46. As noted in our memorandum of 25 August 1994, the beginning
and final passages of this Tablet are published in Amr va Khalq, volume 3,
pages 307–308.

The English translation of the section of the Tablet that appears in
volume 2, pages 45-46 is as follows:

In ancient times the people of America were, through their
> northern regions, close to Asia, that is, separated from Asia by a strait.
> For this reason, it hath been said that crossing had occurred. There are
> other signs which indicate communication.

As to places whose people were not informed of the appearance
> of Prophets, such people are excused. In the Qur’án it hath been
> revealed: “We will not chastise them if they had not been sent a
Messenger.”

Undoubtedly in those regions the Call of God must have been
raised in ancient times, but it hath been forgotten now.
As Mr. Buck observed, the final paragraph of the Tablet is cited in the
Research Department memorandum of 24 May 1988. The first and last
paragraphs are quoted in the letter dated 7 July 1988, written on behalf of the

3\.      The “Call of God” and Native Messengers

Mr. Buck states that he regards the phrase “Call of God”, mentioned
in the extract above, as a technical term which “is very clearly a reference to
the teachings that originate from Manifestations of God”. He also indicates
that this Tablet appears to provide “a textual basis for establishing in principle
but not in name — the existence of Manifestations of God sent to the
aboriginals of North America, and possibly, by extension, to other indigenous
peoples as well”. He, therefore, proposes that

> … the Faith officially proclaim that God, in addition to sending the
> named Manifestations of God that we already have accepted, has sent
> “Messengers of God to Indigenous Peoples” as a principle grounded in
> Amr va Khalq (vol. 2, pp. 45-46). We should at least be able to assert
> that there were “Messengers of God to First Nations”, as we say in
Canada.

Further, Mr. Buck’s understanding of the Tablet leads him to question
whether the Research Department used excerpts from the Tablet to support
two conflicting views. Before considering this question, it is, as Mr. Buck
says, important to address the issue of the meaning of the term “Call of God”.

3\.1     The “Call of God”

The Persian term translated as “Call of God” in the above Tablet is
“nidáy-i-Iláhí ”. This term appears frequently in the Tablets of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá
with differing shades of meaning. By way of illustration, we provide the
following examples from Selections from the Writings of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá
(Haifa: Bahá’í World Centre, 1982), each of which contains the expression
“nidáy-i-Iláhí ”, though the English translations differ:

- Section 15, page 31: “… for this did Bahá’u’lláh raise up the
call of the Lord”.

- Section 195, pages 234–235: Referring to the influence of
> opposition to the Faith on its dissemination, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá asks: “How
> else could His summons have been heard in the continents of America
and of Africa the dark?”

- Section 219, page 274: “Although ye dwell in western lands,
> still, praise be to God, ye did hear His call from out the east and, even
as Moses, did warm your hands at the fire kindled in the Asian Tree.”

- Section 225, page 283: Describing the “Two calls to success
> and prosperity”, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá indicates that the second “is the soul-
> stirring call of God”, which, He explains, “is founded upon the
> instructions and exhortations of the Lord and the admonitions and
> altruistic emotions belonging to the realm of morality which, like unto
> a brilliant light, brighten and illumine the lamp of the realities of
> mankind. Its penetrative power is the Word of God.”
From these several examples, it is suggested that while the “Call of
God” is clearly “founded” upon the teachings of the Manifestation of God,
being in the physical presence of the Manifestation is but one means by which
people become informed of “His summons”.

3\.2      Native Messengers

With regard to whether the excerpt from the Tablet of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá
cited above enunciates a general principle that permits the conclusion that
God sent His Messengers to indigenous peoples, specifically to the Americas,
we wish to note, that, to date, the Research Department has not been able to
locate any authoritative interpretation of the Master’s Tablet in the Bahá’í
Teachings, nor have we found a text which clearly indicates that
Manifestations of God have appeared in the Americas. We offer the following
points for consideration:

T he T ablet

It is not clear from the context of the Tablet that the reference to
raising the “Call of God” presupposes the presence of a Manifestation of God
in the Americas.

The Master’s Tablet appears to be a response to a question about the
fate of people who live in “places” which have not been penetrated by the call
of the Prophets. If this be so, then ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s statement about the raising
of the “Call of God” could simply imply that “the people of America” were
“informed about the appearance of Prophets” as a result of the contact and
“other signs which indicate communication” that occurred “in ancient times”

> OJBS:Online Journal of Bahá’í Studies      251                             1 (2007)

between the peoples of America and Asia. In this regard, the following extract
from a letter dated 25 November 1950, written on behalf of Shoghi Effendi to
an individual believer is of interest:

> It is possible the Indians of the Americas were influenced in the
> remote past by Prophets in Asia. But again, as there is nothing in our
> teachings about it we cannot do more than speculate.

Statement in T he Promulgation of Universal Peace, page 289

In one of His talks published in The Promulgation of Universal Peace,
‘Abdu’l-Bahá is reported to have stated:

> The East has ever been the dawning point of the Sun of Reality. All
> the Prophets of God have appeared there. The religions of God have
> been promulgated, the teachings of God have been spread and the
> Law of God founded in the East. The Orient has always been the
> centre of lights.
The principle enunciated in this statement is confirmed in the
published letters of Shoghi Effendi. For example, in his letter addressed to the
Asian Intercontinental Teaching Conference in October 1953, the Guardian
refers to the “Asiatic continent” as “the cradle of the principal religions of
mankind”. And, in his letter entitled “America and the Most Great Peace”,
Shoghi Effendi reiterated the principle and actually cites this and other similar
passages from Promulgation on the same subject.

Prophetic Figures

While we are unable to locate a text which clearly indicates that
Manifestations of God have appeared in the Americas, the Bahá’í Teachings
and the Qur’án recognize the possibility of individuals’ being centres of
divine guidance for their own people, without occupying the station of Major
Prophethood. In a letter dated 21 December 1986, written on behalf of the
Universal House of Justice to a National Spiritual Assembly, the House of
Justice states:

> … there are also other prophetic figures who are under the shadow of
> the Manifestation, and personages, such as sages, seers, and divine
> men of learning, who because of their wisdom and guidance,
> profoundly influence the lives of people in certain parts of the world.

4\.       T wo Conflicting Views?

Mr. Buck refers to Research Department memoranda dated 24 May
1988 and 22 October 1995, which, he believes, use the statement from the

Tablet of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá about the “Call of God” to support two opposing
points of view. He states that, while, in one memorandum the passage argues
the possibility of two Manifestations of God on earth at the same time, in the
second, it is used to argue against the possibility of Native Manifestations in
the Americas.

In our memorandum of 24 May 1988, the Department was addressing,
among other things, the question of whether, in the past, it was possible that
two Manifestations of God could have lived at the same time. In commenting
on this question, we called attention to the fact that the Bahá’í Teachings
contain no exact information about the dates of Dispensations prior to
Muhammad, that our Writings and the Qur’án indicate that Manifestations
and other prophetic figures have been sent down to mankind from the
beginning of time, and that the records concerning many of these personages
have been lost. Since we were not able to find any clear guidance in the
Bahá’í Teachings concerning the possibility of two Manifestations of God
having lived at the same time, our tentative conclusion — that it was not
possible to rule out such a possibility — was based on the fact that the
Teachings affirm that the traces of many such personages had been lost. The
statement from ‘Abdu’l-Bahá was cited in this connection, rather than to
argue for the presence of Messengers in a particular place, i.e., the Americas.
This usage is consistent with our reading, as outlined above, of ‘Abdu’l-
Bahá’s statement as an affirmation of the fact that “In ancient times the
people of America” had been “informed of the appearance of Prophets”, but
that “it hath been forgotten now”.

With regard to the citation of the Master’s statement about the “Call
of God” in our memorandum of 22 October 1995, we wish to note that
reference to this passage was included because it is one of a small number of
texts and authoritative statements which, when considered in relation to each
other, help to provide insight into the question of whether or not Messengers
of God have arisen in the western hemisphere. Based on these materials, it is
our view that evidence for the advent of Messengers of God in the Americas
does not appear to be very strong. However, we have found no text which
explicitly rules out the possibility.

T ablet to A mír K hán and Related Q uestions

The Research Department received a copy of Mr. Phillip Tussing’s
email letter dated 25 May 2007 and studied the matters that he has raised in
his message. The following is our response to his questions:
1\.       The text of the Tablet is correct. In response to his request, the

> facsimile of the original Persian text is attached. The Research
> Department is not aware of whether a copy of the Tablet also exists in
> the handwriting of Mírzá ‘Alí Akbar Mílání.
2\.       As indicated in the attached facsimile, the Tablet was revealed in

> honor of a certain Amír Khán, about whom we have no information.
> Therefore, we can not verify the biographical information provided by
> Dr. Iraj Ayman and quoted in Mr. Tussing’s email. The Archives
> Office at the Bahá’í World Centre so far has no evidence regarding
> the questions that Amír Khán submitted to the Master.
3\.a.     The Research Department is not aware of any other Tablets, textually

> similar to that of Amír Khán, in which the question of the “Call of
> God” being raised in North America is discussed.
b.       The terms “Call of God” and “America”, of course, appear in a

> number of Tablets of the Master in various other contexts unrelated to
> the text of the Tablet to Amír Khán. As Mr. Tussing has indicated in
> his letter, the term “Call of God” in the Bahá’í texts relates to God’s
> voice and His summons, messages and teachings.
c.       The literal meaning of the Persian term “farámúsh shudih ast” is

> “forgotten”, as it appears in the English translation of the Tablet. The
> Research Department is not in a position to interpret the term beyond
> its literal meaning.
4\.       The Master’s likening of the indigenous Americans to the pre-Islamic

 …a tower of strength for the fugitive. 

> Then Deganawidah said, “So then what is the reason that you are

> Now then Deganawidah affirmed, “Now as for that, from now on

 Be eyes to the blind, and 

> Moreover, at present it [the Great Law] is young as the day is when

> single family consisting of every tribe; and they will be kind to one
> another, all of the people, and this is what will unite them: the Good
> Message, and the Power, and the Peace. — Deganawidah161

 …a guiding light unto the feet of the erring. 

> It shall be the duty of all of the Five Nations Confederate Lords,
> from time to time as occasion demands, to act as mentors and
> spiritual guides of their people and remind them of their Creator’s

> “Hearken, that peace may continue unto future days! “Always listen

 …a crown to the brow of fidelity, 

> Thereupon Tekánawíta said, “Stand-up,” and the man stood up in

 …a pillar of the temple of righteousness, 

> Righteousness means justice practised between men and between
> nations; it means also a desire to see justice prevail. —
> Deganawidah165

 …a breath of life to the body of mankind, 

> Now in turn, the other, my third saying, “now it is arriving, the
> Peace”, this means that everyone will become related, men and also
> women, and also the young people and the children, and when all are

 …an ensign of the hosts of justice, 

As recounted by Arvol Looking Horse (the 19th Generation Keeper of the Sacred White Buffalo
Calf Pipe), The Native Voice (Rapid City, S.D.) 5.13 (Oct 1–Oct 15, 2006): p. D1. “She [White Buffalo Calf
Woman] told the remaining scout to go back, tell what he had seen, but not to make more of what it is or make less
of what it is. These words are also a teaching of staying with truth.” Chief Arvol Looking Horse, “Response to
Eagle Hunter,” Lakota Journal, 2004, June 18–25, A5.

 …a luminary above the horizon of virtue, 

> A broad dark belt of wampum of thirty-eight rows, having a white

> square on the left and the one near the heart, represents the Oneida
> nation and its territory; the white heart in the middle represents the
> Onondaga nation and its territory, and it also means that the heart of
> the Five Nations is single in its loyalty to the Great Peace, that the
> Great Peace is lodged in the heart (meaning the Onondaga Lords),
> and that the Council Fire is to burn there for the Five Nations, and
> further, it means that the authority is given to advance the cause of
> peace whereby hostile nations out of the Confederacy shall cease
> warfare; the white square to the right of the heart represents the
> Cayuga nation and its territory and the fourth and last white square
> represents the Seneca nation and its territory. White shall here
> symbolize that no evil or jealous thoughts shall creep into the
> minds of the Lords while in Council under the Great Peace. White,
> the emblem of peace, love, charity and equity surrounds and
> guards the F ive Nations. — Deganawidah168

 …a dew to the soil of the human heart, 

 …an ark on the ocean of knowledge, 

> Nineteen generations ago the beautiful spirit we now refer to as Pte-
> san win-yan (White Buffalo Calf Woman) brought the Sacred

 …a sun in the heaven of bounty, 

> Thereupon Tekánawíta said, “It will turn out well for us to do this:
> we will say, ‘We promise to have only one dish among us; in it will
> be beaver tail and no knife will be there.’ Thereupon the chiefs
> confirmed that so it should happen.” Thereupon Tekánawíta said,
> “Now we have completed the matter; we will have one dish, which
> means that we will have equal shares of the game roaming about in

> peaceful among all of the people ; and there will be no knife near our
> dish, which means that if a knife were there, someone might
> presently get cut, causing bloodshed, and this is troublesome, should
> it happen thus, and for this reason there should be no knife near our
> dish.” — Deganawidah171

 …a gem on the diadem of wisdom, 

> She warned, “You must have a good heart and a good mind to go to
> the ceremonies. Honor the Sacred Places, the Sacred Ceremonies and
> the Sacred Sites. Each Sacred Site is an altar to the Great Spirit.

Dear Christopher —

> It was a happy thing to find that you are now at Michigan State — a
> university affiliation which I’ve been too busy to develop as an
> alumnus — and have lost classmate contact — thus being an active
> Bahai and physician!

The ms175 is coming by separate posting.

> If you can bring off the “category” idea at the least, and Deganawida
> as indigenous Prophet at the most[,] it will be a great coup and a
> great service. A Bahai Indian woman, with tearful eyes, said that the
> Bahais gave her no respect as an Indian — a sorry thing.

> Your mission = to bring respect for spirituality of the original
> Americans and perhaps much more — pride in Founders of their
> spiritual systems.

> Nuff said, and thanks for chance to see your thorough scholarship
