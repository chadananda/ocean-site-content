The Unired Natio ns declared 1993 the lnteroational Year of
Indigenous People. This reOects a widespread renewed interest, popu-
lar and academic, in native spirin1ality. In Canada, such concern with
"First Nations") bas had an ecumenical impact as well. A strong native
presence in the membership of lhe Canadian Baha' I comn1unity is
rcOected in the fact tl1at native Canadians represent the most signifi-
cant influx of new converts to the Baha'i Faith in Canada, particularly
in the Peigan Reserve in southern Alberta. ln 1993, the Baha'i national
convention held in Regina focused "on lhe unique culture, heritage and
desriny of Canada's Native peoples."4 The "destiny" referred to here is
the Baha'i-inspired vision of Amerindian awakening and its anticipat-
ed impact on lhe historic path to world peace. ln 1993, the National
Spiritual Assembly of the Baha' is of Canada, whose chairperson was
a native Canadian woman, mad.e a formal submission to the Royal
Commission on Aboriginal Peoples.s

In its advocacy on nati ve issues,6 previous representations had
been made by that national assembly in 1960' and in 1968,8 tbe out-
come of a hist.Ory of productive relations with native Canadians.
Canad.ian Baha 'i interaction with native peoples is characterized not
only by respect and advocacy, but also by ecumeniSJn. Integration of

sacred ceremonies (sweet grass and peace pipe ceremonies, blanket
dances, and powwows) into Baha'i conferences, especially in western
Canada, has enriched Canadian Baha'i experience in a pluralistic
(rather than a syncrctistic) way.

Reflected in its representations to the Canadian Parlirunent nnd in
procla1nation pan1phlets, the relation of the Baha' i Faith to native
Canadians has been a duaJ one: one of advocacy and one of teaching.
Baha'is would like to see native Canadians en1brace their religion but,
al the same time, preserve native cultural identities. The purpose of the
present study is to examine the implications of such rapprochement for
Baha'i doctrine.

'rhe "Official" a nd "Popular" Paradox

A classic paradox in the acaden1ic study of religion arises from the
formal comparison of "official" and "folk" (or "popuJar") forms of
religion. Ideally, the two should 1nirror one another. Jn reality, they
often do not. This paper will explore one such pa.radox: indigenization
of secto.rs of Canadiao Saha 'i comn1unity life, supporicd at the policy
level but not fully integrated at the doctrinal level.

Rise in 1he indigenization of Canadian Baha• i conferences reflects
a current trend among missions today in integrating elements of native
spirituality with dominant forms of the Canadian religious culture.
From a Baha'i perspecti ve, the major warrant for a religion's spiritual
authenticity is the attestation of a bona fide '"Manifestation of God" in
any given tradition. Acknowledgment of messengers of God among
native Canadians would appear to be a specifically Baha'i innovation,
despite tbc parallel indigenization of Christian worsh ip. Towards thi s
end, tbe concept of messeogcrs of God to native Caoadians has been
introduced in the form of localized proclamation pamphlets, ofricially
approved by the National Spiritual Assembly of the Baha' is ofCaoada
but never oflicia lly adopted as a public teaching for tl1e uon-native
population. By accepting native traditions as rich ly spiritual and val id,
and ihrough an " indigenization" of Ba.ha 'u'll:\.h at the missionary
level , Saha ' is have in effect created a body of opinion that may lie out-
side ofihe formal teachings of tbe Baha' i Faith. No Manifestation of

God from among native peoples has been explicitly recognized in
Baha'i doctrine. Official Baha' i doctrine, which is al its heart univer-
salist, bas yet to establish a fonnal position with respect to indigenous
prophets. This raises the question of the place of native spiriniality in
Baha'i propbetology.

(Counsellor Jacqueline Left Hand Bull Delahunt, 1995 )9

Baha' i teachers ha ve often appealed to native prophecies to establish
the claims of Baha 'u'llab. This process creates an eschatological
bridge between native worldview and Baha'i universalism, in a link·
age bctwceo oat.ivc wisdom teacher and Baha'i prophet, between
vision and fulfilment. As prophecies tend to be teleological, it is natu-
ral that Baha'i recourse to prophecy is primarily one of missionary
ingenuity. Neither believer nor teacher, as a rule, ever question prophecy.
To do so is religiously imprudent, as the force of the proof text resides
in its authority.

Not unlike popular Mormon identification of Jesus Christ with the
ancient Toltec culture hero Quetzalcoatl, the fi!,•ure of Baha'u'llah is
becoming progressively indigenized in the Americas. Taking the fig-
ure of Quetzalcoatl as a prime example of this Baha'i teaching tech-
niquc,10 Baha'is have appealed to prophecies surrounding the rctun1 of
the To ltec civilizer, and to the "mantic history" of the " Books" of the
Yucatec Mayan "Chilam Balam" priests as 'veil." The mystique of
such a tradition possibly resides in the fact that it is I.iterate•? (the
Mayans bad an extraordinary interest in prophecy) and "historical"
(calendrical, chronological, cyclical).

In 1975, i.t1 the ancient capital of lhe Peruvian Inca empire, the
golden city of Cuzco, Baha' is attending an all-Quechua Baha'i con-
ference (Quechua is the survivi ng language of the ancient Inca empire,
now the second official language of Peru) were photographed beside a
sign, wh.ich read: "Baha'u'llah is tbc return of Viracocha."13 Escha-
tologically, Baha 'u'llah bas becom.e the Inca culture hero Viracocha

C pyr ~tc          l'"'ltcr<I
Bal1;\'11Jnlversalls111 "" "Native Prophets   171

redivivus. 14 The existence of prophecies envisioning the return of
Quetzalcoatl and Viracocha predisposed Baha'i pioneers and converts
to identify Baha 'u'llah with both of these culture hero<.>S, Toltec and
Inca. •S The phenomenon of Quechua converts identifying Viracocha
with Baha'u'Uah might in part be explained by a belief among present-
day Incas that the bead of the Inca deity Ri actually exists and is recon-
stituting itself in the Andean underworld, its head growing a body
toward its feet. When the body of Ri is restored, the Inca will return. 16

The number of localized indigenous messianic connections with
the eschatological persona of Baba'u'llah will continue to grow, but
the process has yet to witness official recognition of native spirituali-
ty as a feature of Baha'i doctrine.

Nat:lve ·reaching a nd llaha 'i folk Ile liefs

A full-color picture of native Baba ' is pcrfonning at a major Baha' i
eveot io M.o ntreal is featured p1·ominently on page eight of a publica-
tion of the Baha'i Internati onal Community.11 On page ten of this mag-
azine, it is stated: "Baba'is the world over conic from all religious
backgrounds: Buddhi st, Christian, Hindu, Jaio, Jewish, Muslim, Sikh,
Zoroastrian. animist, and non-religious." (Emphasis added) The use of
the term "animist" here is politically incorrect.1 8 For the same reason,
I have avoided using other terms, such as "primitive" and "primal," in
this essay. t9

Further on, page 37 of the same publication states: "Peo ple from
all of the major religious backgrounds have found that the prom ises
and expectations of their own beliefs are fulfilled in the Baha'i Faith.
Baha 'ls fivm Native American. African and 01her indigenous back-
gro1111ds, similarly. find in the Baha 'i 1eachi11gs fuljilme111 ofprophetic
visions." (Emphasis added). Here, reference to prophetic visions
would logically require the instrumentality of prophets (major or
1ninor) or, if not, then seers or sages. Prophecies and visions arc
acknowledged far more easily than are prophets and seers, cve11
though the former require the instrumentality of the laner. Tbus, on
page 34, under tbe header " Divine .Messengers," the Bah~'i lnter-
national Conununity states: " Baba 'is believe that throughout bi story

C pyr ~le    JY'ltcr<I
tl1e Creator has revealed Himself to humanity through a series of
Divine messengers. These messengers include: Abraham, Kri shna,
Moses, Zoroaster, Buddha, Jesus, Muhrunmad, The Bab, Baha'u'llab."

Absent from this list are native prophets and seers, because they
are not attested in Baha'i scriptures, except in principle. The problem
of attestation notwithstanding, we get a much different picture when it
comes to native teaching work. There are some significant rea~o1.1s for
ihis.

Throughout Baha'i history, Baha'i missionaries ("pioneers") have
done more than anyone else lo uni versalize the Baha'i Fai1l1, both
demographically and doctrinally. In 1916-17, 'Abdu' l-Baha lent con-
siderable irnpctus to this missionary diversificmion in his Tablets ofthe
Divine Pkm, which were addressed to four countries: the United
States, Canada, Newfoundland, and Greenland.20 In fulfilling 'Abdu ' l-
Baba's vision ofsyste01ati c missionary work to be prosecuted through-
out the Americas, Bahn' i pioneers dedicated their lives 10 promoting
the Baha'i gospel of unity. Evidence of such dedication is not lacking:
what appears to be a local Mohawk tribute io Baha 'i pioneers, James
and Melba Loft, was published in Tekawermake.2t

In tbe Baha'i mission fi eld, ii was necessary to relate Baha'i teach-
ings and iruth-claims to indigenous traditions. Native-oriented Baha'i
teaching pamphlets were published for that purpose. It is importanl to
note d1at these pamphlets typically expressed genuine Baha'i solidarity

with clements of native spirituality, which included recognition of
some of the great spiritual teachers revered in native traditions. Such
pan1phlets-some in typescript, others handwritten-were thus on the
cutt ing edge of Baha' i universalism. In the pamphlet re view process,

Baha 'i policy has supponcd the teaching initiatives ofBaha 'i pioneers,

Despite generic concessions to the existence of native messengers

Baha'i doctrine or praxis generally, the Qur'an is seen as a universal
scripture, thereby acting as a prophc1ological constraint on any such
authority cla ims. This has not ahogether de1erred Baha ' is from
expressing persona.I intcrcsl in the authenticity of culture heroes as
possible messengers of God. There are, for exarnple, chapters on the
Iroquois prophet Deganawida in two Baha 'I-authored books: IVarriors
of the Rainbow and Voices of Eanh and Sky. 22

Tlu~   Problem of "Addlng Names"

Universalism may have its limits.23 Baha' i salvation hist.Ory accounts
for the appearance of the great world religions as each having been
founded by a "Manifestation of God." A Baha'i list of the founders of
tbc major religions rnay be marked by incompleteness. ln response to
a believer wbo raised this issue, Shoghi Effendi explained: "Regarding
your question : the only reason there is not more mention of the Asiatic
Prophets is because their names seem to be lost in the mists of anc ient
history. Buddha and Zoroaster are mentioned in our scriptures-both
non-Jewish or non-Semitic Prophets. \Ve are taught that there have
always been Manifestations of God, but we do not have any record of
their names." 24 This answer satisfies the problem of inclusivity in
cases where all historical traces have vanished. But what of living oral
traditions, if and when such narrative events preserve and prolong the
memory of a culture hero who is likely to have been a real historical
figure in pre-Columbian times? A legend might, after all, have a his-
torical kernel, a basis in history.

While historicity is a necessary warrant of authenticity, it is not a
sufficient warrant for dctcnnining prophetic credentials. Shoghi
Effendi stated why: .. Regarding your questions: we cannot possibly
add narnes of people we (or anyone else) think might be Lesser
Prophets to those found in the Qur' an. the Bible and our own
Scriptt1res. For only these can we consider authentic Books."25

Nole that this pronouncement, in principle, does not exclude other
religious traditions from recognition . Talce the case of Buddhism, for
instance. Nowhere in Baha'u'llah's writings is Buddhism ever men-
tioned. In explaining Baha' u' llah's silence, Shoghi Effendi reasoned:

"The   Peaccn~akcr"          a s a Tes t: <..:ase

ln 1993, in my first contact with Native Canadians at an interfaith
event held in Mississauga, Ontario, the name of Deganawida was spo-
ken of, with reverence, in the same breath and spirit as the name of
Jesus Cbrisi. This spirit of profound reverence made a deep impression
on me, and I resolved to find out more about this native Canadian cul-
ture hero. ln the course of my subsequent reading, I came across this
generous assessment of the legacy of Deganawida and the Iroquois,
spoken by Richard Pilant in his address to the Institute of Iroquoian
Studies in 1960;

> The Six Nations in Canada constitute the 111os1 cOLt1ple1e survival ,..,e
> have today of one of tbe bighcst cultures of one of the races of maakind
> - the tndiao. Uolike tbe Mayas aod the Incas to tbe Sou1h, the Long
> House People developed a dcmocralic system of self-government. They
> alone among tbe tndian nations made a major political contribulion in
> their fonn of Government which can be maintained to have furnished a
> prototype for the United States and the United Nations. Socially ~1c Six
> Nations met tbe sociologist's test of higher cultures by having given a
> preferred status to women.3 1

This assessment, though somewhat out of plac.c in an academic
selling, shows the kind of recognition Deganawida can enjoy even in
learned societies. This may be due in part to the importance of the
lroqouis Great League of Peace (as a cultural and ritual institution)
and the subsequent lroquois ConfcderacyJ2 (as a political and diplo-
matic entity), and its prcsu1ned influence on the framing of the
American system of govemment.JJ (The problem of Iroquois influ-
ence will be discussed later in thi s paper.) The task of discntangli.ng
fact from fancy in the Deganawida cycle, though, is even more prob-
lematic. But systematic attempts have been made. It should be point-
ed out that tl1c Deganawida cycle is sacred to the Iroquois nations, and
that "the Peacen1aker" hitnself is revered to this day as a messenger
from the Creator.

said to have established the Great League of Peace among the warring

"Great League of Peace." Tl11s League, in actual practice, was vested
in a council of fifty peace chiefs, or w1chems (a tem1 used 10 distin-

She was the first to embrnce Deganawida's message a nd , in so doing,
gave clan mothers priority over men.

Deganawida came to one cannibal's lodge. Dcganawida climbed
to the roof and lay chest-down by the smokehole. After the cannibal 's
grisly stew was brewed, as the cannibal was about to eat from a bowl
made of bark, he suddenly beheld in it tbe face of Deganawida. The
cannibal thought be saw himself looking up from the de pths of the pot.
Then Deganawida met the catmibal as be threw away the body. T hey
ate venison together, then buried the corpse. To the cannibal Degana-
wida explained his message. adding that the Ruler bad ordained that
antlers be worn as a sign of authority. The cannibal accepted. There-
upon Deganawida natned the cannibal, Hiawatha.

Deganawida went next to the Mohawks to preach his message. To
the "Fli nt Nation" Deganawida proclaimed: "'The Great Creator from
whom we are all descended sent me to establish the Great Peace among
you. No longer shall you kill one another and nations shall cease war-
ring upon each other. Such things are entirely evil and he, your Maker,
forbids it."43

Though persuaded by his message, the Mohawks demanded proof
ofDcganawida's power to establish such a peace. The prophet obliged,
answering: '·[ am able to demonstrate my power for I an1 the tnessen-
gcr of the Creator and he truly has given me my choice in the manner
of my death."44 Trial by ordeal was in order, one of his own choosing.
He sea.led a tree and, aft.e r it was felled over a precipice, he emerged
unscathed. He then wed the chief's favorite daughter and became a
chief h in1self. The chief accepted Deganawida's message.

Hiawatha tried to convert the cannibal despot Atotarho, his half-

vcpyr     nc       r lier I
Bah<i't Universalism a1Ill Native Prophets       185

brother. Atotarho was a wizard, ch ief of ihe Ono ndagas, with snakes
for hair, twist.e d in body and mind. The wi1,ard fn1strated all of
Hiawatha's attempts io establish pea.ee. Then, according to one ver-
sion, Osinoh the Witch transformed herself into an owl and ki lled each
one of Hiawatha's daughters. Hiawatha was distraught, with no one
who could comfort him in his grief. Mourniog, Hiawaiha forsook the
Onondagas.

As he wandered, Hiawatha came upon a lake or cluster of lakes,
filled with ducks. H.e startled them, and as they took flight. they took
all the lake water with them. Gathering the shells from the lake bottom
and stringing them into beads, Hiawatha invented wa1npum and spoke
of its use for consoling those who mourn.45

l n a cornfield outside a Mohawk village, Hiawatha found a hut
where he made a fue and proceeded to make wampum . To messengers
from the village, Hiawatha taught protocol in the ritualized use of
wampum. The village chief promised Hiawatha a seat of honor at
cow1ci l where they could consult over food, but the promises were
broken. Hiawatha agaio went wandering.

Hiawat ha then chanced upon Deganawida, who went about con-
soling Hiawatha with eight of the thirteen strings of wampum fash-
ioned by Hiawatha. Wampum proved an effective medici ne for those
who mourn, as Hiawatha 's grief was dispelled. Dcganawida sent
scouts in the fonn of crows, bear, or deer to find Atotarho's colwnn of
smoke. Ln the meantiinc, Dcganawida and Hiawatha successively won
the allegiance of the Oneidas, Cayugas, and Senecas. With the two
having the power of unity, Deganawida lcd the Nations to Alotarho, in
order to transfonn hi1n, singing the Peace Hymn along the way.

As the procession reached Onandaga. Dcganawida exorcized
Atoiarho of bjs evil spirits. The two Iroquois prophets got Atotarbo to
agree to be the lirckecper, the principal chief with veto power, and
Onandoga as the capital of the Five Nation's territory. After enlisting
the Onondaga ch ief's support, Deganawida planted the Great Tree of
Peace in what is now Syracuse, New York. Tradition relates that
Deganawida uttered these words as he Cl>tablished the confederacy:

> I am Oekanawidah, and with the Five Nations' Confcde.rntc Lords I
plant the Tree of the Great Peace.

I name tl1e tree the Tree of lhc Great Long Leaves. Under the shade

> danger tlireatening be will at once warn the people of lhe Coofederacy. 46

The Iroquois prophet cast weapons of war beneaU1 the Four White
Roots of the Tree and so founded the Five Nations Con federacy. This
comprised some fifty League chiefs, each invested with a crown of
antlers, the wing of a scagull 10 brush dust away from the council fire
pit., and a pole to rid the area of all creeping creatures. Syinbolizing the
League was the Longhouse with its five fire pits tmder one roof,
wampum belts depicting the Five Nations, Onondaga being a great tree
or heart at its center. A meal of beaver tail, wi th no sharp utensils in the
common dish; five arrows bundled togerl1er t.o make 1hc1n strong; the
counci I fire and pillar of smoke that reached the sky; five stalks of com
ern.erging from one stalk fed by four roots: all of these symbolized the
power of the League.

The League th.en established its foreign policy, with laws regulat-
ing admission into lhe League. Delegations were sent out to th.e
Ojibways, Cherokees, and other tribes to offer them the Great Peace.
The League reserved lbe right to wage just war against any opposing
nation that refused to accept the "Great Peace." The final symbol of
the League was the Condolence ceremony, a re-enactment of lbe rite
as perfonued by Deganawida for Hiawatha, and by both for the exor-
cism of Atotarho. The Condolence ceremo ny, with its thirteen
wampum strings of Requickening, would serve to swerve lbe n1oumer
from vengeful i;_.,-iefresulting in never-ending bloo d feuds. Having ful-
filled his mission, Deganawida departed, promising to come agau1 in a
time of crisis. Dcganawida 's very name was considered sacred, and for
this reason, he is often simply referred to as "the Peacen1aker."47

Typical of myths narrating the exploits of other culture heroes,
Deganawida "travels magically, overcomes a whole series of trials,
and battles monsters. The myth of origin, like the legend, tells that the
hero's task is to structure the world and society. It is in this sense that
myths are the renection of society."48

The historicity of Deganawida, though never in doubt, presents all
the proble1ns of the so-called quest for the historical Jesus. Overlooked
by Vecsey in bis critical treatment of the Deganawida cycle-but in
complete accord with bis findings- is Seldon 's dissertation on
Deganawida. After exa1n ining differing published versions, along with
versions collected by the author himself (documented in English dur-
ing visits to several Iroquois reserves and reservations including
Tyendinaga, S ix Natio ns, and St. Regis), Seldon found that Lhe legend
of Deganawida was transformed over time into myth. Furthermore, ihe
roles of Dcganawida and Hiawatha altered through time as a function
of various social and psychological pressures on the lroquois.49 Of the
extant versions of the Deganawida cycle, Gibson's narrative 1s,
acco1·ding to Vccsey, "perhaps delinitivc."50

Mad Bear 's Proph ecy of Deganaw lda 's Re turn

Since there is at least one tradition of Deganawida's return, it i.s prob-
ably only a matter of time before Baha'i pioneers to Iroquois peoples
proclaim Baha'u'llah to be the return of Dcganawida. Let us theo
examine one tradition foretelling Ilic return of Deganawida.

C pyr ~le       r-'!tcr<I
So ends the Oeganawida cycle, but not its enduring legacy. I now take
up the lroquois influence hypothesis, as this infonns popular appreci-
ation of Deganawida.

The troquois -blfluence tlypothes ls

Until rccenlly, Hollywood has tended to focus on American Indian war
societies. But, according 10 native peoples, an ancient peacemaking
tradition has existed among the Firs! Nations since the dawn ofNonh
Am.erican aboriginal history. A recent study argues that one of the most
compelling bodies of evidence for the ex.istence of a peace movement
among indigenous societies during the American Revolution is pre-
served in the Morgan Papers, a collection of largely unpublished doc-
uments relating 10 the first American l.ndian peace treaty in 1776.55
H islorical arguments have also been advanced which hypothesize
lroquois influence on Beojainin Frankl in, one of the founding fa th ers
of American democracy.56 Jn 1751 , Benjainin Franklin, in a letter to
James Parker, his New York City printing partner, made the compari-
son expI icit:

> ll would be a very strange Thing. if six Nations of igno rant Savages
> should be capable of fonning a Scheme for su ch a Union, and be able to
> ex«ute it in such a Manner, as tha t it b:is subsisted Ages, and appears
> indissoluble; and yet a like Union should be impracticable for ten or a
> Dozen Colonies. to whom it is more n«cssary, and musl be more advan-
> tageous; and wJ10 ca11not be Sltpposed lo "1ant an equal Undcrsta11ding
> of their Interest. 57

lroquoisisl EHsabetb Tooker has taken to task such a view of his-
tory, caUing it a " myth."58 Despite the negative verdict of recent
scholarship, the power and prestige of the Iroquois Confederacy was
sufficient to in1press Benjamin Franklin as a model for comparison .
Lack of evidence to substantiate direct influence on American govern-
ment need not diminish recognition of tbe Iroquois model, which owes
its cx.istcocc, at least traditionaUy, to Dcganawida.

Scholarship can be retied upon to provide correctives. Bui, as in
the case ofTooker's critique, debunking myth is nol always th.e same
as demythologizing myth . Debunking tolally discredits the myth,

vcpyr    nc    r lier I
Bah<l' f Universnllsm and Native Prophets         189

whereas demythologizing salvages from the myth its historical kernel
and, if that is lacki1Jg, whatever trutli might still be gleaned from the
i1Jteot of the myth. Resolving this controversy exceeds ihe scope of
this paper. No amou1Jt of scepticism, however, is likely to dissuade
native views on such niatters. 59

The notion of what ( shall tcnn semitice111rism is crucial here. As
formulated and as currently understood, Baha'i prophetology- in its
essential features-differs little fro1n standard Islamic prophetology. It
is universal in respect of literate, but not oral, cultures. In other words,
religions that lack either an Abrahamic or lndo-Aryan ethnic endow-
ment are unlikely to acb.icve parity with those religions that are
already accepted within the Baha'i tradition.

The lsla1n.lc Legacy:
Sablattis m As a Procru stean Category

Mimi Abu'l-fadl tried to adun1brate fonns of indigenous religions
(especially African) u11der the rubric "Sabian"-although Abu'l-Fadl 's
writings appear to be devoid of reference to New World traditions.
Problems of category become apparent in his definitiolJ of the Sabians
as a reference to "all non-Juda.ic a1Jd non-lndic religions of antiq-
uity."60 This may be true insofar as the learned apologist was con-
cerned, but his own explanation fails to include, at least in specifie
tenns, the religious traditions of the indigenous, pre-Columbian Ne\v
World.

The tenn "Sabian," as I have previously shown, reflects an essen-
tial ly ls Jamie view of the history of religions, which entailed an obvi-
ous lack of consensus, and indeed coo.fusion, i.n 1he use of the 1enn
which Baha'i tenninology stood to inhcri1.61 Furthcnnorc, Mirza
Abu'l-Fadl 's usage of the term was broader than that which Shoghi
Effendi was to adopt a few decades later:

> As to the religion of the Saba:ans, very l.inle is known about the origins
> of this religion, though we Baha ' is are cenain of one thing, that the
> founder of it has been a divinely-sent Messenger of God. The country
> where Saba!anism became widespread and nourished was Cha ldea, and
> Abrahattl is conside'cd as having been a follo\vcr of lhal Faith.62

C pyr      ~le   l"'ltcr<I

T he Baha'i Faith has therefore inherited from Islam an unresolved
problem in the use of the tenn "Sabian." For Baha'u'llah, it referred to
the religion of John the Baptist (>3 Sboghi Effeudi used the tenn in line
with its more common Islamic n1eaning, however.

Baha' is have traditionally spoken of nine existing world religions:
( 1) Sabianism; (2) Hinduism; (3) Zoroastrianism; (4) Buddhis.m ;
(5) Judaisnt; (6) Christianity; (7) Islam; (8) the Sabi religion; and (9)
the Baha'i Faith.64 Shogbi Effendi was quick to recognize the intel-
lectual objections that could be raised to such a fixed and closed
canon. Therefore, he counselled Bahn 'is not to lay too much stress on
this list.65 On the evidence of current publications, this foresighted
doctrinal flexibility was destined to avoid the pitfalls of a nine-religion
exclusivism. 66 The question remains as to bow Baba' i doctrine will
adapt to tbe sociological fact of religious traditions not specified, yet
anticipated in principle and accommodated in practice as the result of
conversions from increasingly diverse populations.

Baha'i universalism is circun1scribed by the linlited possibility of
the attestation of prophets by name. In principle, Baha'i doctrine
acknowledges that messengers of God were sent to all peoples at one
time or other, and that the nan1es of more than a few of them are lost.
Analytically, the Baha' i list of nine explicitly recog1Jized prophets rep-
resents only two families of religions: the lrano-Semitic (Sabianism,
Zoroastrianism, Judaism, Christianity, Islam, Babis1n, and the Baba 'i
religion) and Sino-lndic traditions (Hindu tradition, Buddhism, and, to
a lesser degree in Baba 'i texts, Confucianism). Native spiri tuality
belongs to neither.

Authority rutd Attes tation:
The Cons trab'ltS o f Sc ienc e on Re ligion

Authoritative Baba' i pronouncements do place constraints on what
Baha 'is can integrate into thei.r undisputed, canonical list of divine
messengers. However, doctrine is theoretically open to refinement
provided other Baba 'i principles are considered.

Manifestations of God have lived simultaneously in different areas of
the globe .. . •'{;9 This statement is important in that it theoretically
allows for formal recognition, at least in principle, of religious tradi-
tions ou tside the lrano-Semitic family.

A more enlightened doctrinal modification n1ight be possible on
the basis of a history of civi lizations, in which human societies might
be seen as undergoing asymmetrical developments. In their respective
courses of social evolution, spiritual traditions may be seen as endemic,
distinct, and independent of each other, except perhaps for certain uni-
versal features (phenomenological, not essentialist). Be ing virtually
cut off from the East prior to Colun1bns (subsequent to any prehistoric
migrations), religious history in the Americas evolved independently
of Jesns and Muhammad, such that revelations from God to the
Americas were not n1ediated through Asia. Too narrow a Baha' i con-
ception of progressive revelation would require that, in theory and
assuming a prior date for Zoroaster, a Zoroastrian would be obliged to
believe in the Buddha as ncx1 in the succession of prophets. A corol-
lary of such a view would imply that the New World was bereft of its
own prophets during the dispensations of Christ and Muham1nad.

'Abdu'l-Ba h a on Native Messenge rs of God

ln h.i.s compendiun1 of Baha 'i teachings, Amr va khalq ("Command
and creation"), Fadil Mazandanlni refers to a tablet of ' Abdu'l-Baha
addressed to a certain Amir Kl1an of Tehran. The gist of this piece is
this: in times past, the Call of God (niday-i i/a/11}, referring to ancient
messengers of God, had assuredly been raised among the people of
North America (ahl-i amrlk), though most of the teachings have been
forgotten. As to translation, the Universal House of Justice bas pro-
vided Ille following authorized translation o f the central portion of the
text:

> ln ancient times the people of America were, through their northern
> regions, close to Asia, Iha! is, separated from Asia by a strait. For this
> reason, it hath been said that crossing had occurred. TI1ere are other
> signs v.1hich indicate conunu11icatior1.

As to p l"ces whose people were not informed of tbe appearance of
> Prophets, suc h people are excused. lo the Qur'an it hath been revealed:
> "We will not chastise them if they had not been sent" Messengc.r." (Q.
17: 15)

Undoubtedly in those regions the Call of God must have bee n
> raised in ancient times, but it hath been forgouen now70 (al-boflllt dar
> d1r qfa/r(i/ rtf: dor t1ZJ1lt1ni/1-J•i qac/f111i/171 \'Oqti 11idd-)1i i/ti/1;' b11/a11d
> ga.,·htih \•a -/dki1J 1101fard1111lsl1 ,·J111dil1 a.s11Z).

In this particu lar contex t, the expression "Call of God" (niday-i
i/6/11) is a transparent reference to prophets of God. The expressio n, tbe
"Call of God," is a stock allusion to revelation, as in Baha'u'llah's
poetic description of the Bab's revelation: "The divi.o e call (nidiiy-i
ila/11) of the Celestial Herald from beyond the Veil of Glory."73
Adduced in the text translated above is a quranic verse which 'Abdu'l-
Baba cites indicating that God would not judge a people unto whom
no tnessengcr (raszil; Amr va Khalq 2:46) had come. K.nowledge of
God, according to Baha'i doctrine, is necessarily mediated by chosen
Revealers. This coded validation of Native messengers of God might
suggest a separate and distinct spiritual history in a world far removed
fro1n Abrahamic tradition.

However, at the present time, the language of this tablet is not spe-
cific enough to warrant an explicitly positi ve statement from the
House of Justice, which 'vrites:

> The Bal13'i Teachings do nol explicitly confirm, nor do 1hcy rule out, tl1c
> possibility that Messengers of God have appeared in the Americas. In

What is the status of this particular pronouncement, which ad1nittedly
exists in splendid isolation? Its implications are clear, and in relation
to t he paradign1 bias of semiticentrism, the statement is profound. This
Baha'i validation of native messengers of God suggests a separate and
distinct spiritual history i.n a world far removed from Abrahrunic tradi-

tion Thus. a Baha'i pamphlet incorporating such a positit1n might lool.
something like the figure below:

From silence, wc conclude that the que>tion of the authenticity of
native spirituality was not explicitly addressed dunng Shoghi
Effendi ·s m1niMry as Guardian of' the Baha'i Faith. Though the Bah:i 'i
Mncturc against adding names to the succession of prophet~ altcstcd in
Abrahmn1c scrirturcs would mcvitably frustrate any Baha'i ancmpt 10
enshrine n nauvc culture hero who 1nus1 be accepted by all Bah:i 'is as
a Manifestation of God, such a list might be open-ended with rc;pcct
10 pr111c1plc. Native trad111ons pose their own d1nicul11cs 111 a11cs1a11on.

that such historical unccrta11111es arc no worse than problem> i.ur-

At issue here is not the quest ion of the existence of other messen-
gers of God 1101 attested to and listed in the Saha·; writings, but the
proble.m of designating them by name. In principle, a Baha'i cancer-
tainly affirm that messengers of God bave been sent to aU peoples,
according to Baha'i belief, but that there is simply no authoritative
way to attest the historicity o f legendary culture heroes individually.
111us, Baha'i authorities may consider adding the category of (rather
than names of) messengers of God to First Nations, or messengers of
God to indigenous peoples. The problem now i.s no longer the princi-
ple, but rather the q uestion of names.

Deganawida presents a unique case for Baha' is because there is
evidence for his historicity, as reflected in a scholarly consensus. This
is not to say that the "historical Dcganawida" is possible to recover.
The fact that Degaoawida may have appeared after Muhammad
chronologically poses no difficulty, since native spirituality bas bad no
historica l conneclion wiih the Abrdhamic stream of revelation.
Diffusionist theories may explain the transinission of some vestiges of
ancient native spirituality, but such diffusion does not prcdctenninc
subsequent developments. Though Islam is a universal religion and
was always so potentially. its presence in the New World is late.
Baha'is cannot expect Amerindians to have accepted Islam when IJ1ey
had no knowledge of it. Therefore, the ex istence of Native American
prophets must be recognized in principle. Hence, although the Baha 'i
Faith cannot claim Deganawida as its own, it can recogn ize the place
of Iroquois spirirual genius within the world's sacred history.
