NECATI ALKAN

> Abstract
> In God Passes By, Shoghi Effendi mentions various distinguished political and other figures
> who met ‘Abdu’l-Baha. Among them were several Ottoman officials who were friendly
> towards Baha’u’llah and ‘Abdu’l-Baha. One of them was the outstanding liberal Ottoman
> statesman Midhat Pasha, who, as the governor general (vâli) of Ottoman Syria, invited
> ‘Abdu’l-Baha (‘Abbas Effendi) to Beirut. To date, there have been only very few references to
> this meeting between these two figures. On the occasion of ‘Abdu’l-Baha’s visit to Beirut,
> Baha’u’llah revealed the Law˙-i Ar∂-i B¡, the Tablet of the Land of B¡ (Beirut), in honour
of his son. Hitherto, the circumstances and exact date of this remained unclear.

The object of this paper is to present the background of this episode in Baha’i history in
> the light of a manuscript by the eminent Baha’i Haji Mirza Haydar ‘Ali Isfahani that has
> surfaced recently. His previously unknown account of the visit of Midhat Pasha to ‘Akka,
> during which Midhat Pasha met ‘Abdu’l-Baha prior to the latter’s visit to Beirut, provides
> new information on the circumstances surrounding the revelation of the Tablet of the Land of
> B¡. With the help of other sources we are also able to determine when this episode took place.
> Before this discussion, the life and activities of Midhat Pasha are briefly outlined. An
> annotated translation of Mirza Haydar ‘Ali’s account is appended to this article.

> Midhat Pasha and his governorship in Syria
> Midhat Pasha (1822–1884),2 whose real name was Ahmed ±efik, was a highly capable and
> outstanding official of the 19th century Ottoman Empire. During his childhood he studied and
> memorized the Qur’an and therefore earned the title hâf ız; later he learned Arabic, Persian and
> French.3 From his adolescence on, Ahmed ±efik was engaged in official work in Istanbul,

> the Kuleli uprising in Istanbul, which was organized by reactionary forces aimed at deposing
> the reform-minded Sultan Abdülmecid (r. 1839–1861). Midhat was appointed vâli (governor
> general) of Ni≠ (in present-day Serbia) in the year 1861, and, owing to his successful reforms,
> Sultan Abdülaziz (r. 1861–1876) made him vâli of the Tuna province, which comprised
> modern Bulgaria. This province was created in 1864 as a ‘pilot project’, and Midhat had the
> task of inaugurating a general reform programme (nizâmnâme) for the Ottoman
> administration, based on experiences there. He established local councils in towns and
> villages for the pursuit of public works, science and education; laid the foundation of the still
> extant Bank of Agriculture (Ziraat Bankası) by establishing a cash department; arranged for
> fiscal relaxations and opened public technical schools. Later, in 1868, he was summoned to
> Istanbul and led reforms in the juridical, educational and financial sectors. In the course of his
> governorship in Baghdad (1869–1872) Midhat again carried out successful reforms in various
> fields. At the end of this office, Sultan Abdülaziz appointed him as grand vizier. This,
> however, lasted only three months because Midhat was regarded as being too independent of
> the Sultan. He was also removed from Istanbul in 1873 and appointed vâli in Selanik
> (Thessaloniki in present Greece) as a result of his proposal for representative government. It
> is apparent that Midhat entertained difficult relations with the sultans in his drive for
> democratic reforms but, despite his dissidence, he was regularly reappointed to different
positions because of his ability to improve the affairs of the state in the provinces.

All of the administrative activities of Midhat Pasha covered the years 1839–1878, which
> are known as the Tanzimat-ı Hayriyye (beneficial reordering, reform) period in the history of
> the late Ottoman Empire. The reforms were proclaimed basically through three imperial edicts
> in 1839, 1856 and 1876. The first and second edicts paved the way for the proclamation of the
> Kânûn-i Esâsî (‘Constitutional Law’), the first Ottoman (Turkish) constitution, which was
> announced on 28 December 1876. Midhat Pasha drafted a constitution called Kânûn-i Cedid
> (‘New Law’), together with the poet-statesman Namık Kemal, but Abdülhamid refused it and
> instead had the constitution of France translated and announced this as the Kânûn-i Esâsî.
> Namık Kemal and his friend Ziya Pasha were among the founders of the ‘Young Ottoman’
> reform movement a decade earlier with the aim of democratizing the Ottoman Empire in a
synthesis of Islamic and Western ideas.

The central theme of the Kânûn-i Esâsî was to restrict to some extent the exercise of the
> powers of the Sultan and to introduce the idea of a parliamentary system. Among other
> aspects, this constitution covered basic rights and privileges, and the reform decrees were
> partially directed toward winning the support of European powers and re-emphasized the
> equality of all subjects under the law. These decrees were formulated after European models
> and moved away from the Islamic shariah. However, the main goal of the reforms was to
> preserve the Ottoman state. Sultan Abdülaziz was deposed and died (in 1876) while Midhat

MIDHAT PASHA AND ‘ABDU’L-BAHA IN ‘AKKA

> Pasha was prime minister and, following the three month reign of Sultan Murad V,
> Abdülhamid II became Sultan in 1876. Though he initially accepted the constitution
> (me≠rutiyet) and parliament (Meclis-i Meb’usân), in 1878 he closed the parliament down and
> strengthened his position as absolute ruler for 33 years until he was overthrown by the Young
Turk revolution (1908–1909), and the constitution and parliament were again put into effect.

Midhat Pasha’s fate was determined by article 113 of the constitution, which he himself
> had added, giving the sultan the right to remove or exile ‘dangerous persons’. Abdülhamid
> was greatly disturbed by Midhat’s liberal views that undermined his authority. To understand
> his attitude toward Midhat, we have to keep in mind that the sultan accused him of the murder
> of his uncle Abdülaziz. In his memoirs, however, Abdülhamid states that he did not have any
grudges against Midhat, admired his work as governor but disapproved of his political views.4

Abdülhamid made use of his right to change the prime minister, dismissed Midhat from
> his second term of office as grand vizier (December 1876 – February 1877) and, in accordance
> with article 113, ordered him to leave the Ottoman domains. Following an extended stay in
> Europe – by that time Midhat was celebrated there as ‘the father of the constitution’ – he was
> sent as governor general to Syria in late November 1878. Abdülhamid thus continued his
> scheming against the liberal pasha by removing him from Istanbul and putting him under the
yoke of organising state affairs in the problematic province of Syria.

Whereas Midhat had all kinds of power during his previous governorships, Abdülhamid
> denied this to him in Syria, thinking that his minister wanted decentralisation in that region to
> increase his own power.5 A German source gives some idea of the concerns and ideals of
> Midhat Pasha. It is recorded that he visited the Templer Colony in Haifa on ‘Pentecost
> Monday’ (17 May) 1880. He had come overland to Palestine on a tour of inspection via
> Tiberias, Nazareth and ‘Akka and left Haifa on the same day for Beirut with the Austrian
> Lloyd steamship that was awaiting him. In Haifa, Midhat inquired in detail about the affairs
> and needs of the community; he thanked the Templers for their efforts and for being a good
> example for the local population through their institutions, and wished them continued
> existence and success. Also, the vâli showed utmost admiration for the diligence and
> endeavours of the colonists and said to the officials in his company that it was a shame that
> they (the Turks) could not achieve something similar. The pasha added that ‘Turkey’ had been
> stagnant in its development and thus turned to Europe for instructors in military institutions
> and the navy, industry and trade and would also need specialists in agriculture. He was not
> only very pleased to find a colony that met this need but promised to support its endeavours
> with whatever was in his power. For this he pointed out to the pasha of ‘Akka and the
> kaymakam (head of the district) of Haifa, who were with him, that it was their duty to grant
> all possible facilities and support to the colonists and not to complicate things, as had
> happened in the past. Furthermore it is stated that Midhat Pasha was the first senior ‘Turkish’

> materialize. Sultan Abdülhamid made a great effort to undermine the reform attempts of
> Midhat Pasha. It was in the course of this strenuous period that Midhat Pasha visited ‘Akka
and had an encounter with ‘Abdu’l-Baha, prior to their meeting in Beirut.

After several offers of resignation that were rejected, Midhat was recalled in August 1880,
> ordered to Izmir as governor of the Aydın province and finally charged, in 1881, with the
> murder of Sultan Abdülaziz, in spite of the latter’s confirmed suicide. Due to Western pressure

> life-long imprisonment in remote Taif on the Arabian Peninsula. However, on 8 May 1884
> Abdülhamid ordered Midhat Pasha – who was called ‘father of the liberals’ (Abu’l-Ahrâr) by

> Before we discuss ‘Abdu’l-Baha’s visit to Beirut and the circumstances leading to it, let us

> encounters of Midhat Pasha with Baha’is can be established. The first was when some 70
> Baha’is were exiled from Baghdad to Mosul in 1868, after Baha’u’llah was banished to
> Istanbul. According to a Baha’i source this occurred through the instigation of the Persian
> consul in Baghdad, Mirza Buzurg Khan. Midhat Pasha, who became vâli of Baghdad in 1869,
> was passing through Mosul and, seeing that the Baha’i captives (usar¡) were treated badly, he
> administered justice towards them and set them all free (˙ukm-i ‘adl dar ˙aqq-i usar¡
> nam∞dih hamih-r¡ ¡z¡d s¡kht).8 Another Baha’i account, without specifying the source,
> maintains that the Baha’is were forced to stay in Mosul for twenty years and does not mention
> Midhat Pasha.9 It may be that some Baha’is were freed and others had to stay.10

MIDHAT PASHA AND ‘ABDU’L-BAHA IN ‘AKKA

The second recorded contact of Midhat Pasha with Baha’is is based on a British consular
> report. When Nasiru’d-Din Shah intended to visit the holy cities of Karbala and Najaf in 1870,
> the Persian Foreign Minister, Mirza Sa‘id Khan, considering security, asked the Ottoman
> authorities to remove the ‘Babis’ (Baha’is) in Baghdad. Charles Herbert, the British consul in
> Baghdad at that time, mentions in a letter that he was informed of the arrests of Babis in
> Baghdad and asked the vâli, Midhat Pasha, about the situation. The latter told Elliott that he
> had received orders from Istanbul to take measures ‘with the view of preventing the
> occurrence of any acts on their part that might endanger the safety of His Majesty or give
> cause of umbrage’, and that he ‘had called upon the Babis to retire for a time from this city
> and had even offered assistance to those who might be without the means of travelling’.11
> Midhat Pasha is furthermore reported to have stated that he had asked ‘principal known
> members of that sect’ to leave Baghdad for a certain period and that he himself was reluctant
> to persecute decent subjects of the Empire and did not have problems with their religious
> ideas. Yet the vâli stressed that, in the interest of the safety of the Shah, it was compulsory to
> act thus.12 It seems that through these occurrences and perhaps others, Midhat Pasha came to
> know about ‘Abdu’l-Baha and later met him in ‘Akka, which resulted in their meeting in
> Beirut.

> ‘By the express invitation’ of Midhat Pasha: ‘Abdu’l-Baha’s visit to
> Beirut
> Baha’i sources stress the importance of ‘Abdu’l-Baha’s visit to Beirut, during the course of
> which he met not only Midhat Pasha but also other notables. According to Shoghi Effendi, it
> was through ‘Abdu’l-Baha’s widespread influence that the Baha’i Faith gained respect among
> a wide circle of officials and intellectuals in the Middle East: ‘It was through the
> extraordinarily warm reception accorded Him during His visit to Beirut, through His contact
> with Midhat Pasha, a former Grand Vizir of Turkey [sic], … and through His constant
> association with officials, notables and leading ecclesiastics who, in increasing number had
> besought His presence, during the final years of His Father’s ministry, that He had succeeded
> in raising the prestige of the Cause He had championed to a level it had never previously
> attained.’13 The significance of this ‘historic journey, unparalleled in the religious annals of
> mankind’,14 from the Baha’i viewpoint, is that Midhat Pasha invited ‘Abdu’l-Baha at a time
> when the latter was a prisoner of the Ottomans, and the official edict of Sultan Abdülaziz
> ordering the exile of Baha’u’llah and his followers and their strict confinement in ‘Akka was

> still valid.15 In honour of ‘Abdu’l-Baha’s visit to Beirut, Baha’u’llah revealed the Law˙-i Ar∂-
> i B¡, or the Tablet of the Land of Ba (Beirut).16 Here, as in several other writings, Baha’u’llah
> extols the station of ‘Abdu’l-Baha, whom he calls the ‘Most Mighty Branch of God’. In the
> words of Shoghi Effendi, this tablet was ‘a communication which He dictated to His
> amanuensis’ as ‘a glowing tribute, glorifying Him as the One “round Whom all names
> revolve,” as “the Most Mighty Branch of God,” and as “His ancient and immutable
> Mystery.”’17 Shoghi Effendi provides the date for neither the visit nor this eulogy. Speaking
> about the house of ‘Udi Khammar, to which Baha’u’llah and his family had moved in 1873,
> he states that ‘Abdu’l-Baha’s visit to Beirut, at the invitation of Midhat Pasha, occurred about
> that time.18 However, the source of the material regarding ‘Abdu’l-Baha’s visit to Beirut is not
> provided here, nor is it in subsequent references19 nor does Midhat Pasha mention this in his
memoirs.20

The Baha’i historian Hasan Balyuzi offers different dates for ‘Abdu’l-Baha’s Beirut visit.

> In his work ‘Abdu’l-Baha, he says that ‘Abdu’l-Baha travelled to Beirut ‘by the express
> invitation of one of the most brilliant statesmen of the Ottoman Empire – Midhat Pasha, the
> liberal reformer, who as grand vizier was instrumental in inducing the Sultan to grant a
> constitution to his people’.21 He adds that this ‘must have taken place sometime in 1878, and
> on this occasion Baha’u’llah revealed a Tablet [Law˙-i Ar∂-i B¡] to commemorate and mark
> its significance’.22 However, given the fact that Midhat Pasha arrived in Syria as the vâli at the
> end of November 1878, it is not likely that ‘Abdu’l-Baha visited him right at the beginning of
his governorship and ‘sometime in 1878’ could apply only to December that year.

Balyuzi then says, in the first edition of his book Baha’u’llah: The King of Glory (1980),
> ‘Sometime in 1879, ‘Abdu’l-Baha travelled to Beirut,’23 but in the revised edition of this book
> (1991) the date of the visit has been changed to ‘In June 1880’.24 The question arose as to why
> this change was made without an explanation. At this point our attention turned to possible
> records outside Baha’i sources. Newspapers generally mention arrivals and departures of
> notables anywhere, as did newspapers in the Middle East. It seemed plausible that ‘Abdu’l-
> Baha’s visit to Beirut was announced by a newspaper, since he was well known and respected

MIDHAT PASHA AND ‘ABDU’L-BAHA IN ‘AKKA

> not only in the Ottoman Empire. In fact, the Arabic Beirut-based weekly Thamar¡t al-Fun∞n
> announced ‘Abdu’l-Baha’s arrival on 8 June 1880 with these words: ‘His Excellency, the
> learned, erudite, intelligent and illustrious ‘Abbas Effendi, resident of the city of ‘Akka, has
> arrived in our city. The purpose of his arrival is change of air, may God prolong his well-
> being.’25 In line with this, ‘Abdu’l-Baha must have arrived in Beirut around that date. Yet no
reference with regard to ‘Abdu’l-Baha’s departure could be found.26

The ‘mystery’ of the Beirut visit was solved after elucidation by the publisher of Balyuzi’s
> book and the Baha’i World Centre. According to the publisher, a letter of ‘Abdu’l-Baha was
> found in the Baha’i World Centre Archives in Haifa, dated a week after his return from Beirut,
> in which he states that he was in Beirut between 1 and 17 June 1880. The publisher also states
> that Baha’u’llah’s Tablet of the Land of B¡ was written on 9 June 1880, a week or so after his
> departure. This was all recorded in a list and this is why ‘In June of 1880’ replaced ‘Sometime
> in 1879’ in the revised 1991 edition of the book.27 However, in a memorandum of the Research
> Department of the Universal House of Justice concerning this matter, which was forwarded to
> the present author, it is stated that in ‘the Tablet of ‘Abdu’l-Baha in question’ which ‘is dated
> 10 Rajab 1297 (19 June 1880)’,28 he ‘alludes to His visit to Beirut, but He does not provide
> specific dates’. A provisional translation of the relevant passage is presented as follows:

> … and this servant has, as a thing divinely ordained, been unwell for some time
> past, until I went to Beirut for a change of air. I have recently come back from there
> and at present I am staying at the village of Yark¡ which lies on a hill some 18
kilometres from ‘Akka, and I intend to remain here for a while.

> As mentioned previously, the vâli Midhat Pasha visited Haifa during his inspection of

> ‘Akka.31 But the only published reference in a Baha’i source known to the present author that

> ‘young tree of the friendship with the Pasha was nourished’.32 According to Ayati the visit of

> to Beirut, and we have the first, albeit brief, reference to an encounter between Midhat Pasha
> and ‘Abdu’l-Baha in ‘Akka. This important information seems to have escaped the attention
of later Baha’i historians and can be supported now by another source.

Recently a Persian manuscript that is an autograph by the noted Baha’i Haji Mirza Haydar
> ‘Ali, kept at the Archives of the Baha’i World Centre in Haifa, has surfaced, which mentions
> Midhat Pasha’s meetings with ‘Abdu’l-Baha in, and near, ‘Akka in some detail.33 Haji Mirza
> Haydar ‘Ali was an exceptional Iranian Baha’i, who propagated the Baha’i Faith very actively.
> He spent nine years in prison and exile in Khartoum (Sudan), travelled far and wide in Iran,
> and passed away in 1920 in the Holy Land. Baha’i pilgrims from the West knew him as the
> ‘Angel of Mount Carmel’. He spent some time in the presence of Baha’u’llah and ‘Abdu’l-
> Baha in the Holy Land and wrote memoirs of this.34 His account of Midhat Pasha’s meeting
> with ‘Abdu’l-Baha serves as the historical background of the encounter in the ‘Land of Ba’
> and the revelation of the tablet in question. The date of the manuscript’s composition is not
> clear, but it is after the death of Midhat Pasha in May 1884, since the author speaks about ‘the
late Midhat Pasha’.

Mirza Haydar ‘Ali begins his account by introducing Midhat Pasha as the one who
> established democracy in the Ottoman domains, toppled Sultan Abdülaziz from his throne and
> brought about his death, as prophesied by Baha’u’llah in his Arabic Law˙-i Ra’£s (‘Tablet to
> the Chief’) addressed to Âli Pasha, who then was changing roles between the office of prime
> and foreign minister with Fu’ad Pasha. In that passage Baha’u’llah states that Âli’s attempts
> to attack the religion of God (i.e. the Baha’i Faith) are futile, and he predicts the capture of
> Edirne. According to Baha’i interpretation, the war between the Ottomans and Russia in
> 1877/1878 fulfilled this prediction when the Russians occupied Edirne.35 A clearer reference

MIDHAT PASHA AND ‘ABDU’L-BAHA IN ‘AKKA

The author then refers to the discord between Sultan Abdülhamid and Midhat Pasha, the
> former having the minister appointed vâli of Syria in order to counter his influence in Istanbul.
> Once in Syria, Midhat set out to reform that region for the well-being of its people. Mirza
> Haydar ‘Ali says that it was highly recommended to the governor that he stay during his
> inspection in the ‘Ri∂v¡n Garden’ which, at that time, had been rented by ‘Abdu’l-Baha. That
> garden was originally known as ‘Na‘mayn’ and used to be a small island in a river and has a
> special place in Baha’u’llah’s writings. Shoghi Effendi makes mention of this location as
> follows: ‘The garden of Na‘mayn, a small island, situated in the middle of a river to the east

Midhat Pasha could stay there and ‘Abdu’l-Baha – Haydar ‘Ali calls him Sark¡r Aq¡38 –

granted permission.

One of the essential statements of this account is that Midhat Pasha had information about
> ‘Abdu’l-Baha through the praise of him by many intellectuals. Among these were probably
> the above-mentioned Namık Kemal and Ziya Pasha. The Ottoman intellectual Süleyman
> Nazif writes: ‘When I met ‘Abbas Efendi … two years ago [1917] in the town of Haifa he told
> me with complete sorrow that he had an extensive correspondence with Kemal Bey but that
> out of worry about investigation and persecution in the time of Sultan Abdülhamid II, he had
> burnt those letters.’39 Kemal lived in banishment in Cyprus from 1873 to 1876 and was
> perhaps in touch with ‘Abdu’l-Baha through the Baha’i exile Mishkin Qalam. Nazif,
> moreover, remarks that ‘Abdu’l-Baha was acquainted with Ziya Pasha and was in contact with
> him.40 The advocacy of Midhat Pasha, Namık Kemal and Ziya Pasha, in the 1860s and 1870s,
> for democracy (i.e. constitutional monarchy) in the Ottoman Empire coincided and converged
> with the reform proposals of Baha’u’llah and ‘Abdu’l-Baha on these issues.41

Another interesting and novel aspect mentioned by Haydar ‘Ali is that Midhat had heard
> about ‘Abdu’l-Baha’s utterances in Turkish, which were a proof of his immense knowledge.
> ‘Abdu’l-Baha’s pre-eminence in the Turkish language is attested by Haydar ‘Ali in the
> paragraph42 preceding the account of Midhat Pasha’s visit to ‘Akka. He says that ‘Abdu’l-
> Baha’s clear and adequate replies to inquiries about spiritual matters (mas¡’il-i il¡hiyyih) in
> most eloquent Turkish (bi-zab¡n-i Turk£-yi faß£˙-i bal£gh) caused the eloquent and learned
> men (fußa˙¡‚ wa bulagh¡ wa fu∂al¡) of Turkistan to confess their weakness (‘ajz) and made
> them humble and lowly (kh¡∂i‘ wa kh¡shi‘).43 ‘Abdu’l-Baha’s profound knowledge of
> Turkish was also affirmed later by Ottoman intellectuals who met him; such as: ‘The Shaykh
> spoke the Turkish language very well.’44 Another observer remarks: ‘‘Abbas Effendi’s firm
> grasp and proficiency in each of the Arabic, Turkish and Persian languages is indeed
astonishing. In all three languages he is capable in prose and poetry like a native speaker.’45

The account of Mirza Haydar ‘Ali further points out that Midhat had pressed for a
> meeting with ‘Abdu’l-Baha which the latter accepted, and that the pasha paid a return visit to
> ‘Abdu’l-Baha in ‘Akka. During his days with ‘Abdu’l-Baha, Midhat is portrayed as having
> been delighted and meek in the presence of ‘Abdu’l-Baha. Before returning to Beirut, the vâli
> invited ‘Abdu’l-Baha to Beirut, but he declined. Midhat afterwards wrote to ‘Abdu’l-Baha
> from Beirut and communicated, in a couplet, his desire to meet him. Haydar ‘Ali notes that
> Baha’u’llah thereupon ordered his son to honour Beirut with his visit. Following ‘Abdu’l-
> Baha’s departure, Baha’u’llah revealed the Tablet of the Land of B¡, which Haydar ‘Ali
quotes.

Mirza Haydar ‘Ali’s account ends by stating that Midhat Pasha was responsible for the
> release of Baha’u’llah from imprisonment in ‘Akka. On this issue Shoghi Effendi remarks that
> it was ‘Abdu’l-Baha who ‘had been chiefly instrumental in providing the necessary means for
> Baha’u’llah’s release from His nine-year confinement within the city walls of ‘Akka, and in
> enabling Him to enjoy, in the evening of His life, a measure of that peace and security from
> which He had so long been debarred’.46 In the Law˙-i Ar∂-i B¡ of June 1880, Baha’u’llah
> mentions that ‘the doors of the prison were opened’. The meeting between Midhat Pasha and
> ‘Abdu’l-Baha took place slightly more than nine years after Baha’u’llah’s arrival in ‘Akka; it
> is not clear when Midhat communicated his suggestion regarding the release of Baha’u’llah,
> if indeed he ever made such a suggestion.

In conclusion, Mirza Haydar ‘Ali’s account presents the ‘Akka meeting between these
> two illustrious figures of the late 19th century Middle East as the prelude to the Beirut visit
> and the revelation of Baha’u’llah’s Law˙-i Ar∂-i B¡. We may surmise that Midhat also met
> Baha’u’llah during this visit to ‘Akka. More sources, Baha’i and non-Baha’i, are needed to
> ascertain this and the details of what passed between ‘Abdu’l-Baha and Midhat Pasha during
> their meetings.

> Annotated translation of Mirza Haydar ‘Ali’s account:47
> The late Midhat Pasha, prime minister and the founder of democracy (mu’assis-i jumh∞r) in
> the Ottoman Empire, was the cause of the removal and annihilation (‘azl wa ma˙w) of his
> Excellency, the late Sultan Abdülaziz Khan that was foretold in the Law˙-i Ra’ £s. The Lord –
> glorified is He – says: ‘Hast thou imagined thyself capable of extinguishing the fire which
> God hath kindled in the heart of creation? Nay, by Him Who is the Eternal Truth, couldst thou
> but know it. Rather, on account of what thy hands have wrought, it blazed higher and burned
> more fiercely. Erelong will it encompass the earth and all that dwell therein. Thus hath it been
> decreed by God, and the powers48 of earth and heaven are unable to thwart His purpose. The
> day is approaching when the Land of Mystery [Edirne] and what is beside it49 shall be
changed, and shall pass out of50 the hands of the King …’51

When the sultanate passed over to Sultan Abdülhamid [II] he wished to rule in a despotic
> manner (istibd¡d-r¡ m£khw¡st), and Midhat Pasha did not wish that. So he [the Sultan] plotted
> (asb¡b-ch£n£ nam∞d) [against him]. And the Council took counsel together [and agreed] that
> Midhat Pasha’s stay in the capital [Istanbul] was not appropriate. They appointed that well-
> wisher of the state, of the people and the subjects as governor of the province of Damascus,
> Beirut and the Holy Land. To put [the affairs of the province] in order (bar¡-yi naΩm), he
> would travel to the cities and towns under his government. For his arrival in ‘Akka, there was
no better and more pleasant place than the Ri∂v¡n Garden. They asked Sark¡r Aq¡ [‘Abdu’l-

–

> Baha] – may the lives of all be a sacrifice unto Him – whether he [Midhat Pasha] could be
> honoured with staying in the Ri∂van Garden, and He gave permission. He [Midhat Pasha]
> arrived and because His Holiness [‘Abdu’l-Baha] was a prisoner according to outer
> circumstances, He did not pay a visit. That great vizier (waz£r-i kab£r) was very pleased by
> the condition, beauty and purity of the garden and by its flowers. He recognized out of
perspicacity that it belonged to Sark¡r Aq¡. He asked and they answered in the affirmative.
