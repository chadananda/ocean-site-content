Education for Interdependence: The University and the
Global Citizen
Michael Karlberg, Western Washington University, WA, USA

Abstract: Increasing global interdependence is placing new demands on university educators. Some
educators are beginning to respond by taking seriously the concept of global citizenship education.
This paper advocates the value of an outcomes-based approach to global citizenship education and
suggests a framework of core learning outcomes that can guide and inform the development of global
citizenship curricula. This framework – which includes a set of identity outcomes, ethical outcomes,
and social practice outcomes – is offered as an invitation to dialogue regarding ways that universities
can contribute more effectively to the education of responsible global citizens in an increasingly inter-
dependent world.

creating more opportunities for students to study abroad, and increasing foreign language
requirements where they were previously lacking. In addition, the language of “global cit-
izenship education” is beginning to permeate the academy. It is appearing in the mission
statements and promotional materials of some universities; it is appearing in curricular dis-
cussions and debates within some faculty bodies; and it is being discussed within a growing
body of academic literature.2

These are all valid steps in the right direction. What is still generally lacking, however,
is an integrated, coherent, and cross-curricular approach to educating for global citizenship.
In other words, the developments alluded to above have not yet translated into a coherent
set of core learning outcomes that can guide and inform curriculum development in a sub-
stantive and meaningful way across entire institutions. This paper therefore seeks to advance
global citizenship education by laying out a clear case for it at the university level, by ex-
amining some initial developments in the field, by discussing the value of an outcomes-based
approach, and by inviting a dialogue on a proposed framework of core learning outcomes.

Educating Global Citizens
The case for global citizenship education rests on the premise that we, as a species, can no
longer afford to ignore our global impact and our global interdependence. Put simply, our
technological and reproductive success as a species has transformed the conditions of our
existence. Social norms and cultural patterns that may have been well suited to earlier histor-
ical periods, when human communities were relatively small and isolated, and when they
placed minimal demands upon the earth’s ecological systems, are now proving maladaptive.
Under conditions of heightened social and ecological interdependence, we now need to learn
how to live together on this planet in a peaceful, just, and sustainable manner, as responsible
citizens of a global community.3

These responsibilities rest especially heavily upon the shoulders of privileged populations
who have a disproportionate social and ecological impact in the world. In this context, uni-
versity educators cannot ignore the exigencies of the age we live in. Educating responsible
global citizens should be central to a liberal arts education in the twenty-first century – just
as educating responsible national citizens was widely considered central in the twentieth
century.

Skeptics have argued that the analogy between global citizenship education and national
citizenship education is misplaced, because the nation-state is a legal and institutional reality
while equivalent institutions do not exist at the global level.4 Global citizenship, according
to this line of reasoning, is nothing more than a discursive construct with no legal and insti-

tutional meaning, and hence no real value. What this skeptical view fails to recognize,
however, is that discursive change is often a prerequisite for legal and institutional change.5
In other words, the ways we think and talk about the world influence the ways we legally
and institutionally construct the world. In order to construct effective international institutions
and frameworks of law that are capable of addressing the complex global challenges that
will increasingly face us, we need to cultivate forms of human consciousness that will enable
and support the emergence of such institutions and laws. This is where educators can make
a vital contribution.6

A small number of universities and university educators in the English speaking world
have begun moving in this direction. For instance, in the late 1990s, Nigel Dower directed
a project on global citizenship at the University of Aberdeen in the UK which led, among
other things, to the production of two valuable textbooks: Global Citizenship: A Critical
Reader and An Introduction to Global Citizenship.7 In Canada, the University of British
Columbia launched a global citizenship project in 2003, resulting, among other things, in
the adoption of global citizenship education as a core component of its mission statement;
in the launching of a Global Citizenship Teaching and Learning Initiative to support faculty
members across the curriculum in their efforts to foster global citizenship competencies
among their students; and in the introduction of a range of programs, including a Global
Citizenship Seminar Series and an online Introduction to Global Citizenship course.8 Modest
initiatives can also be seen in the United States. These include the Ethics and Global Citizen-
ship Program at Tufts University, Lehigh University’s Global Citizenship Program, and
Iowa State University’s annual Global Citizenship Symposium. In addition, the Association
of American Colleges and Universities recently completed a three-year project on Liberal
Education and Global Citizenship that worked with faculty from ten colleges and universities
across the country to promote the concept. Likewise, The Global State of Washington initi-
ative is seeking to establish global citizenship curricula within post-secondary institutions
across the state of Washington.

Outcomes Assessment
The initiatives alluded to above represent a series of modest first steps. However, in order
to advance this agenda in a more substantive and systematic manner, educators who are
committed to this agenda will need to acknowledge and embrace the growing trend toward
curricular outcomes assessment in higher education. This trend has generated some skepticism
and even hostility among university faculty because, at its worst, it has served as an instrument
of external control by which powerful interest-groups impose learning outcomes that press
systems of public education into their private service. At its best, however, outcomes assess-

ment provides a valuable tool for curriculum development and reform, provided it is directed
toward constructive ends, in a proactive manner, by socially responsible faculty.9 In this re-
gard, forward-looking faculty can articulate clear and compelling global citizenship learning
outcomes, as well as effective models for assessing these, that will elevate the profile of
global citizenship education among other faculty, administrators, legislators, and the tax-
paying public.

To date, however, global citizenship learning outcomes have received little attention
among university educators. One exception is an article by Andrzejewski and Alessio entitled
“Education for Global Citizenship and Social Responsibility”.10 Andrzejewski and Alessio
define global citizenship as knowledge and skills for social and environmental justice, and
they advocate a set of learning outcomes rooted in the ideals of civic engagement, political
activism, and participatory democracy. Their learning outcomes, however, are borrowed
from an earlier set of curricular recommendations on “Citizenship and Democracy” and their
attention to the global context of citizenship is eclipsed by their emphasis on political citizen-
ship in a national context. Their learning outcomes remain silent, for instance, on the subject
of identity, which is arguably the most central, and sensitive, global issue at the dawn of the
twenty-first century, and the one issue that most clearly distinguishes global citizenship
education from more nationally-focused approaches.

Another exception to the general silence on learning outcomes can be found at the Univer-
sity of British Columbia, where the final report from their global citizenship project outlined
a list of values, competencies, and actions that could serve as a basis for learning outcomes
across the curriculum. Although a good first step, the list is little more than an inventory of
laudable humanitarian ideals, including values such as “respect,” “compassion,” and “open-
mindedness”; competencies such as “self-awareness,” “cultural sensitivity,” and “knowledge
of human rights”; and actions such as “develop linguistic skills,” “contribute to poverty re-
duction,” and “fight racial discrimination”.11 What is lacking from the UBC report is a co-
herent organizing framework that distinguishes the specific imperatives of global citizenship
from more general humanitarian and civic ideals, and translates these into the language and
practice of actual learning outcomes.

What is needed at this time is a systematic effort to clarify and articulate a framework of
learning outcomes that specifically pertain to the exigencies of global interdependence. Such
a framework will need to address the issue of identity that lies at the heart of the current
global problematique and that distinguishes the concept of global citizenship from other
levels of citizenship. In this context, the following framework is offered as an invitation to
dialogue. The framework is organized according to three broad categories: identity outcomes,
ethical outcomes, and social practice outcomes. These broad categories by no means exhaust

the possibilities, but they provide an initial schema for discussing what might uniquely define
global citizenship education.

Identity Outcomes
In an increasingly interdependent global community, inherited identity constructs based on
race, nationality, ideology, religious sectarianism, and other socially constructed categories
can become obstacles to a just and sustainable future if they are understood in conflictual
and mutually antagonistic ways.12 Identity constructs lie at the core of human perception,
motivation, and action. They also shape the ways we interpret our individual and collective
interests. As long as people understand the world primarily in terms of “us” and “them” –
whatever the basis of those distinctions – human beings will be unable to realize their common
interests by coordinating their collective actions.

Meanwhile, the pressures for global coordination are mounting. We face trans-national
ecological crises and health pandemics; we face the rise of international terrorism, a growing
international arms market, and the proliferation of nuclear weapons; we face unprecedented
human suffering, exploitation, displacements, and refugee migrations across the globe; we
face a growing international drug trade and the rise of global crime syndicates; and we face
a market system that has escaped the envelope of responsible democratic governance, resulting
in an abysmal gap between the world’s richest and poorest peoples that is becoming an acute
source of social and political instability.13

Adapting to the conditions of global interdependence, and responding to the challenges
that arise from these conditions, requires a critical re-appraisal of inherited identity constructs.
In this regard, the cornerstone of a responsive global citizenship curriculum should be a re-
cognition of our essential unity as a species – a consciousness of the oneness of humanity.14
This recognition does not imply the obliteration of diversity. On the contrary, it implies the
need to value human diversity as a collective source of richness, beauty, resilience and
strength. Nor does it imply projecting or imposing any historically dominant identity upon
others. On the contrary, it implies reconciling those aspects of our humanity that we all share
in common, with those expressions of cultural and biological diversity that make us unique.
In this context, the following are suggested as an initial set of core identity-based outcomes
within global citizenship curricula:

dependence and the emergence of a common human identity

Ethical Outcomes
Ethics denotes a theory or system of right action. The major question that most ethical systems
attempt to deal with is how to reconcile individual actions and interests with the greatest
common good. The exigencies of global interdependence have now expanded the boundaries
of this question to include all of humanity.15 This has clear implications for any global cit-
izenship curriculum.

Codes of ethics that developed under earlier historical conditions, when human communities
were limited in scope and the common good was thus a relatively circumscribed concept,
need now to be expanded and refined in recognition of the unity and interdependence of
humankind. Like the genetic codes through which species either adapt to their environment
or perish, ethical codes must be similarly adaptive. Unlike genetic codes, however, our eth-
ical codes can be consciously and intentionally cultivated through processes of socialization
and education – including higher education.

The subject of ethical codes, as higher educational learning outcomes, may invite some
controversy. Many faculty are more comfortable comparing different ethical theories, and
contrasting different traditions of ethical reasoning, than they are fostering commitments to
specific ethical principles or codes. When pressed, however, faculty will admit that they are

already engaged in the cultivation of ethical principles such as academic honesty within their
classrooms. Moreover, ethical codes govern various university relationships among and
between faculty, students, and surrounding communities. Universities therefore do commit
to, and cultivate, ethical codes – even if they are sometimes contested and revised or refined
over time.

In order to navigate the challenge of articulating ethical learning outcomes that can be
consensually supported, universities might focus primarily on two sets of ethical principles
that are highly relevant to global citizenship. The first of these are the closely related principles
of justice and equity. Justice and equity, as the terms are used here, refer to expressions of
fairness, and the refusal of double standards, in human relations. At the individual level,
humans are endowed with the capacity to learn fair-mindedness, which enables each of us
to distinguish justice and equity in our interactions and relationships with others. Likewise,
at the group level, communities, organizations, and decision-making bodies can learn to
apply the principles of justice and equity as criteria for collective decision making. Indeed,
this is the only way that unity of thought and coordinated action can be achieved and sustained
among diverse people within an increasingly global context.

The other ethical principle that might be focused on is the principle of collective trusteeship
that underlies most human rights discourses as well as many discourses of environmental
stewardship. Since the human species is one, and our individual fates are increasingly inter-
dependent, it is reasonable to conceive that every human being is born into the world as a
trust of the collective social body. This understanding constitutes the implicit or explicit
ethical foundation of many approaches to human rights. Human rights, after all, are constructs
that are intended to ensure that all individual members of the social body have the maximum
opportunity to realize their potential. The principle of collective trusteeship also constitutes
the ethical foundation of many approaches to environmental stewardship. Responsible envir-
onmental stewardship, after all, is another precondition for ensuring that all human beings
– local, distant, and yet-unborn – have the maximum opportunity to realize their potential.
In this context, the following are suggested as an initial set of core ethical outcomes within
global citizenship curricula:

Students will be able to...

1\.   articulate a rationale for justice and equity in the context of global relationships
2\.   apply the principles of justice and equity by
a. identifying double-standards in interpersonal, inter-group, and international rela-

tionships
b. assessing the costs and consequences of double-standards in interpersonal, inter-

group, and international relationships
> c. imbuing social action with a sense of justice, equity, and fair-mindedness
d. replacing relationships based on conflict, dominance, and exploitation with rela-

tionships based on cooperation, reciprocity, and mutual empowerment
3\.   articulate a rationale for the principle of collective trusteeship on a global scale
4\.   apply the principle of collective trusteeship by
a. recognizing that the well-being of individuals and distinct social groups depends

upon the well-being of the global social body

THE GLOBAL STUDIES JOURNAL

b.   promoting the collective responsibility to ensure social and environmental condi-

tions that permit the realization of the full potential of every individual and group
c.   articulating a set of basic human rights and responsibilities that permit the realiza-

tion of the full potential of every individual and group
d.   analyzing a global social issue or problem through the lens of basic human rights

and responsibilities
e.   reflecting upon the social costs and ecological consequences of consumer choices

and economic policies
f.   modifying consumer choices and habits by taking into account social costs and

ecological consequences
> g.   explaining the public policy dimension of a global environmental issue or problem
h.   making social and environmental decisions that take into account the interests and

needs of geographically distant and yet-unborn peoples

Social Practice Outcomes
Shared social practices constitute a large part of what it means to be human. According to
May, practices are normatively governed regularities of behavior that are generally goal-
directed.16 Examples range from the practice of dating to the practice of litigation to the
practice of democratic deliberation. Such practices develop in specific cultural and historical
contexts and they change over time. We can thus recognize diverse and evolving communities
of practice, including distinct communities of scientific practice, or of educational practice,
or of religious practice.

Some sets of practices are specifically associated with the exercise of power and authority
within social groups. Such practices include, for instance, those associated with the acquisition
and control of knowledge, or with the definition of what constitutes legitimate forms of
knowledge and authority. Closely related to these are various practices associated with
governance and decision making. Many inherited practices of these kinds are now being
questioned by historically marginalized groups who recognize the structural inequalities that
are often embedded in practices associated with the control of knowledge and the exercise
of power and authority. In an increasingly interdependent global society, where the welfare
of every social group depends on the well-being of the entire social body, such practices
need to be critically re-examined and, when necessary, modified according to the principles
of justice, equity, and collective trusteeship discussed above. If social practices that lead to
domination, oppression, and exploitation are not superceded by practices that promote mu-
tual empowerment and collective advancement, it will be impossible to marshal the unified
thought and coordinated action needed to respond to the myriad global challenges that face
us.17 Again, educators can play a vital role in this regard.

In this context, special attention also needs to be paid to practices associated with collective
inquiry and collective decision making, which are central to the exercise of power and au-
thority in contemporary societies. Such practices are learned within family systems, small
groups and organizations, schools and universities, and other local settings – in ways that

University Press, 2001).

often have a gendered bias and that perpetuate the privileges of dominant social groups.
Once established, such practices tend to be carried forward into the arena of national gov-
ernance and international relationships. The following are therefore suggested as an initial
set of core social practice outcomes within global citizenship curricula:

Students will be able to...

1\.  use methods of collective inquiry and collective decision making that are inclusive,

collaborative, unifying, and mutually empowering
2\. recognize the complex and multifaceted nature of many social and ecological issues
3\. approach complex issues with epistemological humility and open-mindedness
4\. solicit and value diverse perspectives on complex multifaceted issues
5\. involve people who will be affected by decisions in the formulation of those decisions
6\. foster an atmosphere that gives voice to, and promotes dignity and respect among, all

people involved in decision making processes
7\. apply ethical principles as primary criteria within the solution of complex social and

environmental problems
8\. treat geographically distant and yet-unborn people according to the same ethical

standards you would, yourself, want to be treated
9\. support processes that lead to solidarity of purpose, thought, and action among diverse

people in the implementation of responsible and responsive decisions
10\. maintain a posture of learning and assessment in the implementation of collective de-

cisions
11\. adopt a systematic approach to refining decisions, following implementation, based on

the experience and feedback of those most affected

Conclusion
University educators who recognize the imperative of educating for global interdependence
now need to take the next steps and begin articulating clear, coherent, and meaningful
learning outcomes that can guide and inform curriculum development while raising the status
of global citizenship education among faculty, administrators, legislators, tax payers, and
donors. The framework articulated above represents an invitation to dialogue among those
who are committed to this goal. This framework is not meant to be the last word on the
subject, nor is it meant to imply a one-size-fits-all approach. Global citizenship learning
outcomes will undoubtedly vary according to the institutional culture and commitments of
different universities, and they will surely evolve over time. However, if some initial, general
consensus on a few socially responsible outcomes can be reached, this will significantly re-
inforce efforts to advance global citizenship education while preventing the cooptation of
the term by groups inside and outside the academy who are motivated by narrowly conceived
self-interests.

As the dialogue on core learning outcomes unfolds, it will also be important to recognize
both the strengths and the limitations of measurement-based approaches to student learning
outcomes. Outcomes assessment is not a panacea for higher education. Nor is it an effective
way to advance every educational objective. There is often an inverse relationship between
how meaningful a learning outcome is and how measurable it is, and the most meaningful

learning outcomes can perhaps never be measured. Nevertheless, the pro-active articulation
of learning outcomes and the curricular discourse it generates is proving to be a highly pro-
ductive exercise that can have a substantial positive impact on educational content and pro-
cesses.18 Even when specific learning outcomes cannot easily be measured or assessed, the
process of thinking and talking them through, writing them down, and committing to them
can have a transformative effect on both curricula and pedagogy.

In this context, today’s university educators can play their part in laying the foundations
for a more just and sustainable global community. Since the concept of global citizenship
does not have the legal and institutional status that the concept of national citizenship currently
enjoys, now is the time to begin constructing the internal architecture of meaning that may
eventually support those external legal and institutional forms. Only when these internal and
external structures are built will the majority of the earth’s people stop being the mere subjects
of political and economic forces beyond their control, and instead become empowered citizens
who assume the rights and responsibilities associated with membership in a global community.
