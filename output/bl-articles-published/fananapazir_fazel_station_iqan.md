It is the intention of this paper to present a review of the rank and  station of the Kitáb-i-Íqán according to the primary Bahá'í literature - the writings of Bahá'u'lláh, 'Abdu'l-Bahá and Shoghi Effendi - and to provide a study outline of its contents.(1)

**Bahá'u'lláh on the Íqán**  
In a number of texts Bahá'u'lláh emphasises the importance of the Íqán. For instance, Bahá'u'lláh states in a Tablet to Mírzá Abú'l-Fadl concerning questions of Manakji Limji Hataria, probably revealed between 1877 and 1882, that the Kitáb-i-Íqán is "the Lord of Books \[_Sayyid-i-Kutub_\]"(2) (_Má'idiy-i-Ásmání 157_, provisional translation). Furthermore in the Kitáb-i-Íqán itself, Bahá'u'lláh states that, "all the Scriptures, and the mysteries thereof are condensed into this brief account," (_Íqán_ 237) and that it can unfold "all the allusions and the implications of the utterances of the Manifestations of Holiness" (_Íqán_ 28). The following are a selection of such quotations:

> . . . the things We have already mentioned suffice the world and all that is therein. In fact, all the Scriptures, and the mysteries thereof are condensed into this brief account. So much so that were a person to ponder it a while in his heart, he would discover from all that hath been said the mysteries of the Words of God, and would apprehend the meaning of whatever hath been manifested by that ideal King. (_Íqán_ 237, emphasis added)
> 
> Were you to ponder, but for a while, these utterances in your heart, you would surely find the portals of understanding unlocked before your face, and would behold all knowledge and mysteries thereof unveiled before your eyes. (ibid. 52, emphasis added, cf. 19)
> 
> This servant will now share with thee a dewdrop out of the fathomless ocean of the truths treasured in these holy words, that haply discerning hearts may comprehend all the allusions and the implications of the utterances of the Manifestations of Holiness, so that the overpowering majesty of the Word of God may not prevent them from attaining unto the ocean of His names and attributes, nor deprive them of recognising the Lamp of God which is the seat of the revelation of His glorified Essence.  (ibid. 28, emphasis added)
> 
> Briefly, there hath been revealed in the Kitáb-i-Íqán (Book of Certitude) concerning the Presence and Revelation of God that which will suffice the fair-minded. (_Epistle to the Son of the Wolf_ 119, cf. 97, 168)
> 
> As to thy question that in the Religion of Zoroaster it is stated: "This (Zoroastrianism) is superior and better than the religions of the past." By this is meant superiority relative to the past. These sanctified Beings in one station are all one. Their first is the last and Their last is the first. All have come from God; all have summoned mankind to God, and all have returned to Him. These matters are revealed in the Kitáb-i-Íqán, which is in truth the Lord of Books \[_Sayyid-i-Kutub_\], the Book that has flowed from the Pen of the Most High. Blessed is the one who hath seen it and been a witness to its testimony and hath pondered its contents for the love of God, the Lord of mankind. (_Má'idiy-i-Ásmání_ 157, provisional translation, emphasis added)
> 
> As to thy question on 'resurrection', in the Kitáb-i-Íqán is revealed that which is all-sufficing. (_Majmú'ih_ 166, provisional translation)
> 
> Peruse thou the Kitáb-i-Íqán (Book of Certitude) . . . that thou mayest be made aware of the things that have happened in the past, and be persuaded that We have not sought to spread disorder in the land after it had been well-ordered. (_Epistle_ 97, and _Tablets_ 210, emphasis added)
>

**'Abdu'l-Bahá on the Íqán**  
'Abdu'l-Bahá refers to the Íqán on a number of occasions in explaining the concept of 'return'. For instance, in an explanation of the meaning of the "Second Coming of Christ and the Day of Judgement", he says: "Bahá'u'lláh has explained these verses in the Kitáb-i-Íqán. There is no need of repetition, refer to it, and you will understand these sayings" (_Some Answered Questions_ 110). Other references include:

> The "return" which is mentioned in the bygone Scriptures is . . . fully explained by the Supreme Pen in the Kitáb-i-Íqán. Refer to it, so that you may be informed of the truth of the divine mysteries. (ibid. 289)
> 
> In the book of the Íqán we can read the Word of God concerning the true Reincarnation, which is the Return of the Spiritual Qualities in the Servants of God. (qtd. in Grundy, _Ten Days_ 45)(3)
> 
> 

Howard Colby Ives describes how 'Abdu'l-Bahá answers a question of his on the relationship of Christianity to the Bahá'í Faith by referring to the Íqán:

> . . . men have entirely forgotten the pure teachings of this "Essence of Severance" \[Christ\]. He \['Abdu'l-Bahá\] remarked that His Holiness Bahá'u'lláh speaks of this in the _Book of Certitude_ and that I should study it carefully. In that book is explained how these stars of the Heaven of Christ's Revelation have fallen to the earth of worldly desires. On their tongues the mention of God has often become an empty name; in their midst His Holy Word a dead letter. This condition is that to which Christ refers, He said, when He speaks of "oppression or affliction of the Last Days." (Ives, _Portals_ 125)

Also, in a talk at the home of the Kinneys in New York in 1912, 'Abdu'l-Bahá, in describing the contents of Bahá'u'lláh's writings, says of the Íqán:

> In the Kitáb-i-Íqán He has given expositions of the meanings of the Gospel and other heavenly Books. ('Abdu'l-Bahá, _Promulgation_ 155)

**Shoghi Effendi on the Íqán**  
Shoghi Effendi has written that the Íqán is "the most fundamental book on the Bahá'í Revelation"(4) and the "most important book written on the spiritual significance of the Cause" (_The Light of Divine Guidance_, 37). It is a "book of unsurpassed pre-eminence among the writings of the Author of the Bahá'í Revelation" (_Íqán,_ foreword), and "from a Bahá'í point of view \[it is\] far more important and significant than any other Writings of Bahá'u'lláh, with the exception of the Aqdas."(5) On many occasions Shoghi Effendi directed Bahá'ís to "read and read over again" the Íqán in their attempts to deepen in the Cause,(6) and he writes to George Townshend that "the book is so important that the most minute detail is worthy of consideration".(7)

The significance of the Íqán, he states, lies in the fact that it "is the most important book wherein Bahá'u'lláh explains the basic beliefs of the Faith",(8) and "contains the basic tenets of Faith"(9) and "the very essence of the Teachings, and because of its clarity and relative simplicity can greatly appeal to every thoughtful reader".(10) In it "the entire religious philosophy of the Cause is clearly sketched and every thoughtful student of religion cannot but be interested in it",(11) and it "explains the attitude of the Cause to the Prophets of God and their mission in the history of society,"(12) describes "the mystic unity of God and His Manifestations" (_World Order_ 137, cf. _Íqán_ 4) and "deepens the knowledge of the reader by acquainting him with some of the basic theological problems of the Faith. It is therefore indispensable for every student of the Movement".(13) It is "Bahá'u'lláh's masterful exposition of the one unifying truth underlying all the Revelations of the past" (_World Order_ 61-2), and can lead the reader to "obtain a clear insight into the old scriptures and appreciate the true mission of the Báb and Bahá'u'lláh".(14) In relation to the Báb's revelation, the Guardian states that "Nowhere but in the Kitáb-i-Íqán . . . can we obtain a clearer apprehension of the potency of those forces inherent in that Preliminary Manifestation . . ." (_World Order_ 61-2). Shoghi Effendi emphasises the significance of the Íqán in the history of religions in the following way:

> Well may it be claimed that of all the books revealed by the Author of the Bahá'í Revelation, this Book alone, by sweeping away the age-long barriers that have so insurmountably separated the great religions of the world, has laid down a broad and unassailable foundation for the complete and permanent reconciliation of their followers. (_God Passes By_ 139, emphasis added)

Moreover Shoghi Effendi hoped that studying the Íqán would "infinitely enhance the teaching work in the West"(15) and that the "faith \[of the Bahá'ís\] would be re-inforced by a true intellectual understanding"(16) and "their comprehension of the essentials of the Faith" would be deepened.(17)

In an untranslated letter of Shoghi Effendi to the Persian Bahá'ís, he stated that despite the virtual extinction of Bábí support after the many horrendous persecutions, Bahá'u'lláh enunciated that the Cause of God will be victorious in the subsequent Dispensation which he inaugurated:

> After the establishment of the throne of the Lord of mankind in the City 'Abode of Peace', in His most excellent \[_mustatáb_\] Kitáb-i-Íqán, He describes the future of the unbelievers(18) . . . (Shoghi Effendi, _Má'idiy-i-Ásmání_ 163-4, provisional translation)

_God Passes By_ explains the relationship of the Íqán to the other volumes of Bahá'u'lláh's revelation. It may be possible, in one perspective, to rank the following three works - the Kitáb-i-Aqdas, the Kitáb-i-Íqán and _The_ _Hidden Words_:

> Foremost among the priceless treasures cast forth from the billowing ocean of Bahá'u'lláh's Revelation ranks the Kitáb-i-Íqán (Book of Certitude). . . This Book, setting forth in outline the Grand Redemptive Scheme of God, occupies a position unequalled by any work in the entire range of Bahá'í literature, except the Kitáb-i-Aqdas, Bahá'u'lláh's Most Holy Book. (Shoghi Effendi, _God Passes By_, 138-139)
> 
> Next to this unique repository of inestimable treasures \[Kitáb-i-Íqán\] must rank that marvellous collection of gem-like utterances, the Hidden Words. . . (ibid. 139-140)
> 
> 

Furthermore, Shoghi Effendi indicates that there are three volumes of Bahá'u'lláh's writings that can be considered the most important in their category: the Kitáb-i-Íqán as the pre-eminent "doctrinal" work, _The_ _Hidden Words_ as the foremost of his "ethical" writings, and the _Seven Valleys_ as his "greatest mystical composition":

> To these two outstanding contributions to the world's religious literature \[Kitáb-i-Íqán and _The_ _Hidden Words_\], occupying respectively, positions of unsurpassed pre-eminence among the doctrinal and ethical writings of the Author of the Bahá'í Dispensation, was added, during that same period, a treatise that may well be regarded as His greatest mystical composition, designated as the "Seven Valleys,". . . (ibid. 139-140)

At a time when the Kitáb-i-Aqdas is reaching the Bahá'í world through its first authoritative translation with "its world-shaking significance" (Universal House of Justice, Ridván 1992 message), it is noteworthy that the Universal House of Justice refers to "the incomparable Revelation of Bahá'u'lláh" and directs our attention to "all that has flowed from His prodigious, truth-bearing pen" (letter to the Bahá'ís of the world, 5 March 1993).

**Discussion**  
Although the primary Bahá'í literature reiterates the importance of the Kitáb-i-Íqán, it is possible to see that these writings have also placed complementary emphases on the subject matter of the work. Bahá'u'lláh, in the Íqán itself, primarily discusses its potential to elucidate and interpret Scripture. 'Abdu'l-Bahá focuses on its Christian relevance, relating it to the North American culture in which he was living and teaching at the time. Shoghi Effendi, however, emphasises its importance in clarifying basic Bahá'í tenets and the essence of Bahá'í belief. The beloved Guardian also makes the bold claim that it provides the means to reconcile the theological barriers between religions.

It is interesting that Bahá'í writers in the West have focused on the Íqán as explaining the Bahá'í approach to other religions. Three examples are worthy of mention. Hippolyte Dreyfus' introduction to his 1908 translation of the Íqán into French, presents it as a work which "examines the writings of Moses, of Muhammad and Jesus, analyses certain passages of Scripture, . . . and demonstrates the Unity that connects all the divine Manifestations" (_Introduction_ xi). George Townshend, who is perhaps the first Western Bahá'í to apply the Íqán in a scholarly manner to his work, says, in a letter to Shoghi Effendi, that _The Heart of the Gospel_ "applies the principles of the Ighan \[_sic_\] to the Bible; and the introduction \[to _The Heart of the Gospel_\] makes this statement" (qtd. in Hofman, _Townshend_ 281). His analysis, in the introduction to the 1939 edition, emphasises that the Íqán is a work explaining the concept of the progressiveness of Divine revelation, and expands and elaborates this principle of the Bible "in a more modern manner and with more of philosophic detail" (qtd. in ibid. 272). Helen Reed Bishop's introduction to the 1950 English edition makes the observation that the Íqán argues against the Christian rejection of Islam, and consequently the work illustrates to "Westerners . . . how vital was Islám's part in the unity of religion" (_Introduction_, xx).

Few writers, however, have stressed the spiritual experience and rewards of reading the Íqán.  The only description of this that the authors have been able to find was Arthur Agnew's back in 1907:

> At times when reading the Book of _Ighan_ . . . the spirit of light, joy and gladness has come over me, which I have not been able to ascribe to any word or sentence or to any one idea or thought. It seemed like a radiance arising from the Book, from the Certainty of Truth. (Agnew, _Wonderland_ 81)

2\. The reasons for failure to recognise and accept the Manifestations of God (14-89).  
3\. In this age the story of past Dispensations is being repeated (13-83).

The more they observe the indomitable strength, the sublime renunciation, the unwavering constancy of God's holy companions, who, by the aid of God, are growing nobler and more glorious every day, the deeper the dismay which ravageth their souls. In these days, praise be to God, the power of His Word hath obtained such ascendancy over men, that they dare breathe no word... Ere long, thine eyes will behold the standards of divine power unfurled throughout all regions, and the signs of His triumphant might and sovereignty manifest in every land." (Bahá'u'lláh, _Kitáb-i-Íqán_ 77-78)
