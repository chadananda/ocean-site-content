    Metaphor and the Language of Revelation

Ross Woodman

Abstract
Metaphor is the literal language of the soul. To enter the realm of metaphor as
the language of the soul is to come into direct contact with the Word as the
originating power of creation, in the Bible identified with God. In this
exploration of metaphorical language as the language of revelation, the richer
unveiling of its meaning to be found in the writings of the Báb and Bahá’u’lláh
will serve to clarify further the nature of metaphor as that clarification which
contains within it an immediate consciousness of the station of Bahá’u’lláh.
This newly released consciousness signifies humanity’s coming of age in and as
a fully awakened human realization that the earth is now the throne of God, as
proclaimed by Bahá’u’lláh in his impassioned address to Carmel as his New
Jerusalem Bride. Metaphorically understood, Bahá’u’lláh’s proclamation is
“the trumpet” that in the biblical tradition signals the Resurrection.
“Trumpet,” “Pen,” “Bride,” “Resurrection”—in metaphors such as these the
soul finds its proper home in the redeeming consciousness of a new era
described by Bahá’u’lláh as the “Divine Springtime.”

Résumé
La métaphore est le langage littéral de l’âme. Pénétrer le domaine de la
métaphore en tant que langage de l’âme, c’est entrer en contact direct avec la
Parole, soit le pouvoir qui est à l’origine de la création, et que la Bible identifie
comme étant Dieu. Dans cette exploration du langage métaphorique comme
langue de la révélation, la riche découverte des significations que recèlent les
Écrits du Bab et de Baha’u’llah sert à clarifier davantage la nature de la
métaphore, comme étant cette clarification qui renferme en elle-même une
conscience immédiate de la station de Baha’u’llah. Cette conscience
nouvellement accordée montre que l’humanité est parvenue à sa maturité et à
une réalisation maintenant pleine et entière que la terre est le trône de Dieu, tel
que proclamé par Baha’u’llah dans la tablette passionnée qu’Il adressa au
Carmel, l’Épousée de la Nouvelle Jérusalem. Au plan métaphorique, la
proclamation de Baha’u’llah est la «trompette» qui, dans la tradition biblique,
annonce la Résurrection. «Trompette», «Plume», «Épousée», «Résurrection»:
dans des métaphores comme celles-ci, l’âme retrouve sa demeure véritable
dans la conscience rédemptrice de cette ère nouvelle décrite par Baha’u’llah
comme le «printemps divin».

Resumen
La metáfora es el idioma textual del alma. Entrar al reino de la metáfora como
idioma del alma es ponerse en contacto directo con la Palabra como poder
dimanante de la creación, identificado en la Biblia con Dios. En esta
exploración del idioma metafórico en caracter de idioma de revelación,
descubrir los significados más suntuosos que han de encontrarse en los
escritos del Báb y Bahá’u’lláh servirán para aclarar aún más la calidad de
aquella metáfora que contiene dentro de sí una conciencia inmediata del
rango espiritual de Bahá’u’lláh. Este conocimiento nuevamente liberado
significa que la humanidad ha logrado su mayoría de edad habiendo
despertada plenamente a la comprensión de que la tierra es ahora el trono de
Dios, según lo proclama Bahá’u’lláh en su discurso apasionado a la Montaña
Carmelina en caracter de su Novia de la Nueva Jerusalén. Comprendido
metafóricamente, la proclamación de Bahá’u’lláh es “la trompeta” que en
tradición bíblica señala la Resurrección. “Trompeta,” “Pluma,” “Novia,”
“Resurrección”: en metáforas tales como éstas el alma halla su hogar
apropiado en la conciencia redentora de una nueva era señalada por
Bahá’u’lláh como la “Primavera Divina.”

I n The Great Code: The Bible and Literature , Northrop Frye, greatly

influenced by his reading of the apocalyptic poet William Blake, explores in
considerable depth the poetic language of the Bible as what he calls “a single,
gigantic, complex metaphor” (63). For Blake, as for Frye, this gigantic
“metaphor” is the total form of the Bible, which Blake calls Jerusalem, at once
the city and bride of God that is progressively taking shape throughout the
Bible, until in its final book it is seen in vision “coming down from God out of
heaven, prepared as a bride adorned for her husband” (Rev. 21:2). The visionary
form that the New Jerusalem metaphorically assumes is what Blake calls the
“human form divine” (“The Divine Image” 13), which is to say, the human
form of the divine creation. “All Human Forms identified,” Blake thus
concludes Jerusalem, his hundred-plate epic,

even Tree, Metal, Earth & Stone: all
> Human Forms identified, living, going forth & returning wearied
> Into the Planetary lives of Years, Months, Days & Hours: reposing
> And then Awaking into his Bosom in the Life of Immortality.
And I heard the Name of their Emanations: they are named Jerusalem.

(Plate 99:1–5)

In his shorter epic Milton, Blake describes the descent of the New Jerusalem
more personally as Milton’s twelve-year-old feminine Muse, Ololon. In Blake’s
reading of Milton’s epic Paradise Lost, Ololon unites at last with Milton and

descends as Christ’s return into Blake’s garden at Felpham, a small village in
the south of England where Blake is reading Milton’s epic to his wife. Christ’s
return becomes in Blake’s vision the opening of the eighth Eye of God, the
entire Adamic cycle, now finished, constituting what he calls “the Seven / Eyes
of God & the Seven Lamps of the Almighty” (The Four Zoas 1:553–54). “Then
as a Moony Ark,” writes Blake of the visionary opening of God’s eighth Eye in
“the Fires of [Blake’s] Intellect,”

Ololon descended to Felpham’s Vale
> ....................... with dreadful thunderings
> Into the Fires of Intellect that rejoic’d in Felpham’s Vale
> Around the Starry Eight; with one accord the Starry Eight became
> One Man, Jesus the Saviour, wonderful! round his limbs
> The Clouds of Ololon folded as a Garment dipped in blood,
> Written within & without in woven letters, & the Writing
Is the Divine Revelation in the Litteral expression,

(Milton 42 [49]: 7–14)

The “Garment dipped in blood / Written within & without in woven letters”
is Blake’s own illuminated text of Milton, which is his apocalyptic reading of
Milton’s epic, a reading that constitutes a new revelation of its previously
hidden or “Litteral” (i.e., unveiled) meaning. Like the biblical prophets with
their messianic message, Milton, Blake suggests, could only partially discern
what still remained sealed within the Adamic cycle that is haunted by its
controlling vision of a lost Paradise. “Now is the dominion of Edom, & the
return of Adam into Paradise; see Isaiah xxxiv & XXXV Chap” (Plate 3), Blake
boldly declares as he announces the subject of his early prophetic work The
Marriage of Heaven and Hell, in which all that Milton did not yet know is
unveiled by Blake, progressive revelation constituting for Blake the visionary
relationship between them.

Blake’s “All Human Forms identified” is, for Blake as for Frye, the state of
total metaphoricity understood as the primal state of language itself. In this
primal state of origination or originating power, language as metaphor is for
both Blake and Milton intimately connected to the Logos or Word, God’s
creative power. When, therefore, Milton in Paradise Lost calls upon the
“Heav’nly Muse” (1:6) to dictate his verse even as the “Heav’nly Muse” had
dictated to Moses, he is conscious that what is being dictated is the Word of
God, as the Word is renewed or regenerated by the inspired poet. Night after
night in sleep, the blind Milton declares, he was “up led” as an “Earthlie Guest”
into “the Heav’n of Heav’ns” (7:12–13) by his “Heav’nly Muse,” in her
feminine form, whom he names Urania. Though he knows as argument what he
wants to say, he is totally dependent upon obtaining what he calls an
“answerable style” from his “Celestial Patroness”

4             THE JOURNAL OF BAHÁ’Í STUDIES                                           8.1.1997

who deignes
> Her nightly visitation unimplor’d,
> And dictates to me slumbring, or inspires
Easie my unpremeditated Verse.

(9:20–24)

Milton describes divine dictation as an ascent into the “Heav’n of Heav’ns.”
Blake, as Milton’s successor, more boldly describes Milton’s Muse (whom
Blake calls Ololon) now emerging from “the Portals of [Blake’s] Brain, where
by [her] ministry / The Eternal Great Humanity Divine planted his Paradise”
(Milton 2:7–8). Having emerged from his brain, Ololon is then called upon by
Blake to “[c]ome into [his] hand” by “descending down the Nerves of [his] right
arm” (2:4–5).1 Milton’s “Heav’n of Heav’ns,” the Seat of God’s throne, now
becomes in Blake’s vision Blake’s own body, even as in the Revelation of
Bahá’u’lláh the realm of Bahá’u’lláh’s Muse or Maid of Heaven becomes the
earth itself. “Great is thy blessedness, O earth,” declares the Ancient of Days to
Bahá’u’lláh as the “Most Exalted Pen,” “for thou has been made the foot-stool
of thy God, and been chosen as the seat of His mighty throne” (Gleanings from
the Writings of Bahá’u’lláh 30).

Blake’s subject is the Return of Christ as the New Jerusalem’s descent to
earth. His bodily experience of its descent as what he calls “a Pulsation of the
Artery” (Milton 29[31]:3) prefigures Bahá’u’lláh’s revelatory encounter with
the Maid of Heaven (the New Jerusalem Bride) in the prison in Tehran, an
encounter that constituted his awakening to his station as the Manifestation of
God for this day. “During the days I lay in the prison of T.ihrán,” he writes,

> though the galling weight of the chains and the stench-filled air allowed Me but little
> sleep, still in those infrequent moments of slumber I felt as if something flowed from
> the crown of My head over My breast, even as a mighty torrent that precipitateth
> itself upon the earth from the summit of a lofty mountain. Every limb of My body
> would, as a result, be set afire. At such moments My tongue recited what no man
> could bear to hear. (Epistle to the Son of the Wolf 22)

In a passage that bears a certain resemblance to Bahá’u’lláh’s account of his
limbs set aflame as he becomes in a moment the very incarnation of the
Promised One, Blake describes his bodily vision of Christ’s return. “My bones

1. When Blake writes that the Daughters of Beulah, the counterpart of the Maids of Heaven in the
Revelation of Bahá’u’lláh, proceed out of his brain where God planted Paradise down his right arm
into his writing hand, Blake’s conception of his head as the earthly seat of God anticipates
Bahá’u’lláh’s description of his hair, in the Tablet of the Hair, as his “Phoenix” that “hath . . . set
itself upon the blazing fire of My Face and receiveth sustenance from the garden of My
Countenance.” Again, Bahá’u’lláh addresses his hair as his “Messenger” who “is calling aloud at all
times upon the branch of Fire within the hallowed and luminous Garden of Paradise” (qtd. in
Lambden, “The Sinaitic Mysteries: Notes on Moses/Sinai Motifs in Bábí and Bahá’í Scripture”).

trembled,” Blake writes, describing the descent of Christ, Christ’s limbs folded
in the “Clouds of Ololon.” “I fell outstretchd upon the path / A moment”
(42[49]:25–26). In that “moment,” equal for Blake to the entire Adamic cycle
(six thousand years from its creation to its judgment), his work as a poet was
done.2 “Every Time less than a pulsation of the artery,” he writes,

> Is equal in its period & value to Six Thousand Years,
> For in this Period the Poet’s Work is Done: and all the Great
> Events of Time start forth & are conciev’d in such a Period,
Within a Moment, a Pulsation of the Artery.

(28 [30]: 62–63; 29 [31]: 1–3)

In The Great Code, Frye explores the originating nature of metaphor as the
power of words that resides ultimately in the Word, which announces itself to
Moses as the “I AM THAT I AM” (Exod. 3:14). In the Revelation of
Bahá’u’lláh this power of the Word is “He Who hath been manifested” as “the
Hidden Mystery, the Treasured Symbol, through Whom the letters B and E (Be)
have been joined and knit together” (Bahá’í Prayers 13). Following the
suggestion of biblical scholars, Frye argues that the “I AM THAT I AM” in the
Authorised King James Version might be more accurately rendered, “I will be
what I will be.” “That is,” he explains,

> we might come closer to what is meant in the Bible by the word “God” if we
> understood it as a verb, and not a verb of simple asserted existence but a verb
> implying a process accomplishing itself. (Great Code 17)

God as “a verb” rather than a noun removes the word God from a state of
unknown being and places it in the realm of an ongoing action, “a process

2. When Blake describes the work of six thousand years from the Creation to the Judgment or the
entire Adamic cycle as taking place in his body in “the Pulsation of the artery,” he again anticipates
Bahá’u’lláh who in the Kitáb-i-Aqdas declares that “it behoveth whoso hath quaffed the Mystic
Wine of everlasting life from the Hands of the loving-kindness of the Lord his God, the Merciful, to
pulsate even as the throbbing artery in the body of mankind, that through him may be quickened the
world and every crumbling [mouldering] bone” (Kitáb-i-Aqdas #173, 82).

Blake’s visionary presentation of his body as the divine Creation itself, undergoing a renewal or
rebirth as Milton journeys through it in search of Christ’s return that both he and Blake as twin
prophets await, further anticipates Bahá’u’lláh’s Tablet to Queen Victoria in which he calls upon
“the elected representatives of the peoples in every land” to “regard the world as the human body
which, though at its creation whole and perfect, hath been afflicted, through various causes, with
grave disorders and maladies” (Gleanings 254–55).

Blake is restoring the body of the world, as the macrocosm of his own body, to its original
wholeness and perfection. This radical act of restoration Blake boldly identifies (as Christ’s return
in his glorified body) as the body of Blake’s own illuminated text. Blake as poet/painter is enacting
the descent of the Kingdom of God to earth as their descent takes place in his own body. It is, I
suggest, the clearest, most exact anticipation of Bahá’u’lláh’s awakening in the Síyáh-Chál in all
English prophetic literature.

6            THE JOURNAL OF BAHÁ’Í STUDIES                                         8.1.1997

accomplishing itself,” a process that Bahá’u’lláh describes as Progressive
Revelation, which is, of course, precisely the process that Blake describes in his
poetic vision, most particularly in his own prophetic relationship to Milton.

As “a process accomplishing itself” (Progressive Revelation), we must try,
Frye asserts, “to think our way back to conception of language in which words
were words of power, conveying primarily the sense of forces and energies
rather than analogues of physical bodies” (17). We must, that is, “think our
way back” (rather than, as in this essay, forward into revelations beyond the
revelation of Christ) to a metaphorical view of language rather than a literal
one in which language is answerable to things. For Frye, this “think[ing] our
way back” now remains most immediately available to us in what he calls “the
secular scripture,” the imaginal body of literature in which the Word is
liberated from the interpretative closure that characterizes the institutional life
of religion and is free to renew itself perpetually as poetic, as distinct from
religious, truth succinctly described by Coleridge as a “willing suspension of
disbelief for the moment” (2:6). Though ordained in the United Church of
Canada, Frye was more himself in a literary world than in a religious one,
finding in literature an imaginal body to which he could more intimately relate
than to the rather more doctrinal body of Christ that had in the dogma of the
Incarnation imposed a closure upon the Progressive Revelation that, in Frye’s
Christian view, had culminated in Christ. In Blake, one may argue, Frye found
the ideal prototype of his own struggle with Christianity, though, it may
equally be argued, in his brilliant, far-reaching reading of Blake’s poetry in
Fearful Symmetry, he may finally have rendered Blake less of a religious
revolutionary than he actually was.

Unknown or unrecognized by Frye, the Word, kept alive in and as “secular
scripture” (described by Shelley as “a feeble shadow of the original conception
of the poet”3 (Defence of Poetry 504), has now been renewed and extended at
its divine source in the Revelation of Bahá’u’lláh. What as mimesis, as “secular
scripture,” in Romantic poetry stops short of divine revelation, while at the
same time it opens itself to revelation in its anticipation of Christ’s return,
remains in Frye what may be called as supplement, a secular anticipation of the
return, which in the end denies metaphor the full spiritual power of the Word
that belongs to scripture. The return, that is, is a metaphor that is finally denied
the object it contains and in Bahá’u’lláh is, Bahá’u’lláh’s exploration of return
in the Kitáb-i-Íqán being as metaphor the unveiling of Bahá’u’lláh’s own
station. “O brother,” Bahá’u’lláh writes, referring directly to his own person,

3. Shelley describes the poet’s “mind in creation” as “a fading coal which some invisible influence
awakens to a transitory brightness. . . .” Of this “invisible influence,” he argues, “the conscious
portions of our natures are unprophetic either of its approach or its departure” (Defence 503–4).

> behold how the inner mysteries of “rebirth,” of “return,” and of “resurrection” have
> each, through these all-sufficing, these unanswerable, and conclusive utterances, been
> unveiled and unravelled before thine eyes. God grant that through His gracious and
> invisible assistance, thou mayest divest thy body and soul of the old garment, and
> array thyself with the new and imperishable attire. (Kitáb-i-Íqán 158)

What is evident in Blake’s Milton, when compared to the Revelation of
Bahá’u’lláh that it so clearly prefigures, is less a weaving of a “new and
imperishable” garment to replace Milton’s old one (of which Milton could not
as a Puritan divest himself) than an extraordinary reweaving of Milton’s
garment that, in patching it, opened it to its apocalyptic meaning, a meaning that
Blake in his day (1804) could not inhabit “except remotely” (Milton 40 [46]: 3).

“What do I here before the Judgment? without my Emanation [Bride]? / With
the daughters of memory, & not with the daughters of inspiration?” Milton asks
in Blake’s epic recreation of Paradise Lost. A prisoner of his own poem, Milton
hears in Blake’s reading of it to his wife a way out of its “intricate mazes”
(Milton 2:17). Leaping out of these mazes, he lands at Blake’s left foot and
enters it at the tarsus (“on my left foot falling on the tarsus, entered there,”
Blake writes in Milton [17(19):49]).

Like S ha ykh Ah. mad writing in Persia at the same time that Blake was
writing in England, Blake was preparing the way for the Second Coming, a
Coming requiring for recognition the vastly enlarged spiritual senses of the
resurrected body by which alone we are able, in the words of the “Tablet of
Ah. mad,” “to see God with [our] own eyes” and “hear His Melody with [our]
own ears” (Bahá’í Prayers 212). In Shaykh Ah. mad, the resurrected body is
what he calls the “subtle body.” Shoghi Effendi explains this body at some
length in his translation of The Dawn-Breakers by quoting an article in the
Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society. “He [Shaykh Ah. mad] declared,” the article
reads,

> that the body of man was composed of different portions, derived from each of the
> four elements and the nine heavens, and that the body wherewith he was raised in the
> resurrection contained only the latter components, the former returning at death to
> their original sources. This subtle body, which alone escaped destruction, he called
> Jism-i-Húriqlíyá, the latter being supposed to be a Greek word. He asserted that it
> existed potentially in our present bodies, ‘like glass in stone.’4 Similarly he asserted

4. The “glass in stone” is the soul as mirror in the stone of the physical or opaque body. Shaykh
Ah. mad taught the essentially Sufi doctrine that if the “glass [mirror] in stone” is turned to God, the
glass [mirror] will become luminous so that the physical body itself will become transparent rather
than opaque, a “subtle body” or “resurrected body” which is the body of Muh. ammad that ascended
to Heaven in his famous night journey. Shaykh Ah. mad further explained that the “glass” when
turned toward the sun (the Manifestation of God) becomes flaming crystal, and the crystal, in turn,
further transformed by the heat of the sun as it is progressively intensified, becomes a diamond. The
soul as a “diamond body” is the soul that dwells immortally in the Abhá Kingdom.

> that, in the case of the Night-ascent of the Prophet to Heaven, it was this, and not his

> doctrines of Mullá S. adrá, the greatest Persian philosopher of modern times. (Qtd. in
> Nabíl, The Dawn-Breakers 4)

The question that Milton asks as he is about to enter the body of Blake to
join with him in its resurrection process (Frye’s “process accomplishing
itself”) is the question that Frye might well have asked himself as he as reader
entered the body of Blake’s work, particularly what Blake called its “Furnaces
the Stomach for digestion” (M i l t o n 24[26]:59), which he named
“Bowlahoola” (Milton 24[26]:67). What was he (Frye) doing with “the
daughters of memory, & not with the daughters of inspiration?” Why could he
not see that Blake’s subject was not the Christ of the Gospels but the Christ of
the Second Coming, the Christ of the Book of Revelation that the Gospels
only in part revealed, his return remaining in them largely concealed? Why,
that is, did Frye not grant to metaphor the full authority he ascribed to it as the
original and originating state of language?

All of this Shaykhi doctrine is to be found in the Writings of the Báb. “The One true God,” he
writes,

> may be compared unto the sun and the believer unto a mirror. No sooner is the mirror placed before the sun than
> it reflects its light. The unbeliever may be likened unto a stone. . . . Indeed, if God willeth, He is potent to turn
> the stone into a mirror. . . . Had he wished to become a crystal, God would have made him to assume crystal
> form. (Selections from the Writings of the Báb 103)

Thus when, for example, Bahá’u’lláh speaks of “the pure, the gem-like reality of man” (Gleanings
77), the “gem-like” may be understood as the “diamond body.” And, again, when Bahá’u’lláh
describes the radiance of this “gem-like reality of man” as being so intense that no human being on
earth could survive its intensity if suddenly exposed to it, he is describing the reality of his
Revelation as the unveiling of the full “reality of man.” “Were it [the physical sun], all of a sudden,
to manifest the energies latent within it,” Bahá’u’lláh writes, “it would, no doubt, cause injury to all
created things.” Bahá’u’lláh then continues, moving from the physical sun to the spiritual sun:

> In like manner, if the Sun of Truth were suddenly to reveal, at the earliest stages of its manifestation, the full
> measure of the potencies which the providence of the Almighty hath bestowed upon it, the earth of human
> understanding would waste away and be consumed; for men’s hearts would neither sustain the intensity of its
> revelation, nor be able to mirror forth the radiance of its light. Dismayed and overpowered, they would cease to
> exist. (Gleanings 88)

Indeed, so intense was the potency of Revelation that not even the Pen of Bahá’u’lláh could on
certain occasions endure it. Addressing the “people of Bahá,” Bahá’u’lláh declares: “Were We to
reveal the hidden secrets of that Day, all they that dwell on earth and in the heavens would swoon
away and die. . . .” As if these “hidden secrets” were at this moment on the sacred tip of his
“shrilling” Pen (a reference to the reed-like sound of the pen nib on the paper), Bahá’u’lláh writes:

> Such is the inebriating effect of the words of God upon Him Who is the Revealer of His undoubted proofs, that
His Pen can move no longer. (Gleanings 35)

In the ongoing process of the “secular scripture,” itself the mythical
displacement of the Word as divine revelation, Frye aesthetically gratifies as
poetic faith what is absent in the Christian closure that constitutes the doctrine
of Incarnation. In his exploration of the typology that metaphorically binds the
Old Testament to the New, (the Old becoming the rearview mirror image of the
New), the Bible remains essentially sealed. The fact that the Old and New
Testaments in their metaphorical identity became the type of the Qur’án (“I am
all the Prophets,” declared Muh.ammad, “I am the first Adam, Noah, Moses,
and Jesus” [qtd. in Kitáb-i-Íqán 153]), and that together as one they became the
type of the Revelations of the Báb and Bahá’u’lláh, is a larger global “process
accomplishing itself” that remains arrested in Frye’s reading of the Bible,
though not in his reading of the “secular scripture” that constitutes world
literature. Nevertheless, within its clearly delineated Christian limits, Frye’s
reading of the Bible, particularly with reference to his analysis of language,
metaphor, and typology, provides a brilliant model for an understanding of the
metaphorical nature of the Word, especially when his reading of the Bible is
carried forward (the word meta-phor means a carrying across) to include the
revelations of Muh. ammad, the Báb, and Bahá’u’lláh in a divine “process” that
in accomplishing itself must never allow accomplishment, however impressive,
to arrest the process forever. Metaphor, as the unveiling of new meanings
within a given or literal meaning, can no more be arrested or exhausted than
can God as the unknowable source of life. “Veil after veil may be undrawn,”
Shelley writes, describing the infinite world of metaphor, “and the inmost
naked beauty of meaning never exposed.” After “one person and one age has
exhausted all its divine effluence which their peculiar relations enable them to
share,” he explains, “another and yet another succeeds, and new relations are
ever developed, the source of an unforeseen and unconceived delight”
(Defence of Poetry 500). Metaphor as the progressive revelation of a ceaseless
unveiling has never been better described.

The Trial of the Báb: The Literal and the Metaphorical
Frye illustrates the metaphorical reality of the Bible by arguing that when Jesus
says “I am the door” (John 10:9)—another translation is “the gate”—there are
“no doors outside the verse to be pointed to” (Great Code 61). If, indeed, literal
doors outside the verse needed to be pointed to in order to understand the
station of Jesus, then Jesus as a literal door would point to a madman rather than
to a Manifestation. The failure, that is, to grasp the metaphorical rather than
literal nature of the Word calls into question the sanity of Jesus, even as later in
the interrogation of the Báb by the ‘ulamá in Tabríz the Báb’s purely
metaphorical account of himself in and through the verses he uttered registered
as madness to those who heard him. Indeed, the entire interrogation of the Báb
by the ‘ulamá focused upon the Báb’s insistence upon his metaphorical identity

10         THE JOURNAL OF BAHÁ’Í STUDIES                             8.1.1997

as the Word and the determination of the ‘ulamá to make him as metaphor
answerable to a literal reading of scripture and tradition. In steadfastly refusing
to be rendered answerable, the Báb was finally judged to be insane. Had he not
been so judged, he would have been sentenced to death.

Just as Jesus in the New Testament declared his station by metaphorically
identifying himself with Old Testament verses, the Báb, according to the
official report of the proceedings by E. G. Browne, affirmed the Báb’s station
before the Tribunal at Tabríz by reciting the famous h. adíth, “I am the city of
knowledge and ‘Alí is its gate.” “It is incumbent on you to obey me, by virtue
of [the verse] ‘Enter the gate with reverence!’” (Qur’án 4:153), he commanded
the Tribunal. Clearly distinguishing his utterance as the Manifestation of God
from a merely human utterance, the Báb then explained: “But I did not utter
these words. He uttered them who uttered them.” When asked “Who then is the
speaker?” the Báb replied: “He who shone forth on Mount Sinai.” The Báb
then recited the famous verse: “[If to say] ‘I am the Truth’ be seemly in a Tree,
why should it not be seemly on the part of some favored man? There is no
selfness in between.” The Báb, that is, addressing the Tribunal in verses drawn
from the Qur’án and the h.adíth was totally identified with the Word so that the
self had completely disappeared. “These are God’s words,” he declared. “I am
but the Tree [the Burning Bush] on Sinai. At that time [the divine word] was
created in it, now it has been created in me” (qtd. in Amanat, Resurrection and
Renewal 389).

Shocked and angered by the Báb’s declaration of himself as the return of the
Hidden Imám, the promised Mahdí, the Tribunal cited the absence of any literal
or physical evidence to support his claim. The Twelfth Imám, they pointed out,
“was born [of a holy ancestry] in Sámirra in the year 256 [869],” whereas the
Báb was born in Shíráz of humble origin, the son of a Shírází clothier. The
Twelfth Imám would appear from Mecca with a sword as well as the support of
“the leaders of men and the Jinn and their forty thousand followers,” which are
“all promised in the h. adíth.” The Imám would bring along “David’s coat-of-
mail, rod of Moses, Solomon’s ring and the white hand [of Moses].” To which
the Báb replied: “I am not permitted to bring such things” (qtd. in Amanat,
Resurrection 389–90). God, that is, would not permit a Messenger to render
God answerable to the literal demands of those who rejected the Word. The
Word is answerable to God rather than to humans, having within it the principle
of its own integrity. The ‘ulamá having failed to understand the metaphorical
nature of the Word, the Báb refused to confirm them in their failure by
subjecting the Word of God to their perverse demands. On the contrary, his
divinely assigned task was to restore the authority of the Word to its source in
God by divesting the ‘ulamá of it.

Following the Tribunal, the matter of the Báb’s sanity was raised, and a
conditional death sentence was issued pending a confirmation of the Báb’s

sanity. Dr. William Cormick, the crown prince’s physician, and two Persian
physicians were instructed to examine the Báb and determine “whether he was
of sane mind or merely a madman.” In his recollections of his visit to the Báb in
the Tabríz citadel, Dr. Cormick wrote:

> He only once deigned to answer me on my saying that I was not a Musulman and was

> of all Europeans coming over to his religion. Our report to the Shah at that time was
> of a nature to spare his life. (Qtd. in Amanat, Resurrection 391)

The “of a nature to save his life” carried within it the implicit assumption that
the Báb was insane.

In terms of the teachings of Shaykh Ah. mad, the forerunner of the Báb out of
whose school all the Letters of the Living5 emerged, the Báb himself, having as
a child attended a S ha ykhí school and been instructed by a S ha ykhí tutor,
addressed the ‘ulamá from the Hurqalya,6 the intermediary world of the Hidden
Imám that resides between the elemental world of the five senses and the
transcendent realm of God or pure intelligence. In this intermediate world in
which the Hidden Imám resides and from which he would appear, the physical
body of the elemental world (the realm of the four elements) that disintegrates
at death is replaced by a spiritual or resurrected body inhabiting a spiritual earth
that is made up of what may be called eternal images. It is this realm of eternal
images that constitutes the metaphorical world from which proceed the verses
of the prophet. The Báb before the Tribunal at Tabríz addressed the ‘ulamá out
of this metaphorical realm which is the celestial Earth of the soul, the Earth of
Hurqalya. “Hurqalya is the Earth of the soul, because it is the soul’s vision,”
writes Henri Corbin. “To see things in Hurqalya” is to see them

> as they are as events of the soul, and not as constituted into autonomous material
> realities, with a meaning detached from and independent of the soul, as our positive

5. A designation by the Báb for the first eighteen people to recognize his station.

6. The term Hurqalya is likely to remain troublesome for many readers unfamiliar with the realm it
designates. Bahá’u’lláh describes his Revelation as the calling into being of a “new creation.” This
“new creation” is the Earth itself newly unveiled to the soul that has opened itself to Bahá’u’lláh’s
Revelation. It is, therefore, what Henri Corbin calls “the Earth of the soul” or “the soul’s vision” of
Earth. For the Bahá’í, this “soul’s vision” is not merely a subjective experience; it is an objective
reality unveiled by divine Revelation. It is reality itself, the Earth as the creation of God and the seat
of God’s throne. The Earth is “the Earth of the soul.” In the Revelation of Bahá’u’lláh that
constitutes the soul’s “coming of age,” the Earth is no longer what Blake called “a portion of Soul
discern’d by the five Senses” (Marriage of Heaven and Hell, Plate 4). It has vastly expanded
beyond the material limits of the five senses to include and embrace the “Energy” formerly hidden
in matter and now in its fullness released. This “Energy” is at once the reality of matter and its
“throne.” It is a literal or objective reality directly communicated in and as metaphor.

> science constitutes and objectifies them. (Spiritual Body and Celestial Earth: From
> Mazdean Iran to Shi’ite Iran 88)

The substance of metaphor, which is to say “the Earth of the soul,” is the
substance of the Word, an eternal body of permanent images (city, tree, gate,
door, garden, bridegroom, bride) that is ceaselessly renewed through
Progressive Revelation until, at last, it becomes, in the Revelations of the Báb
and Bahá’u’lláh, inhabited by a human consciousness that has long been
evolving toward it.

It may also be argued that it is precisely here in this view of Progressive
Revelation as the soul’s historical evolution toward the Hurqalya that the
Revelation of Bahá’u’lláh separates itself from Henri Corbin’s reading of
Shaykh Ah. mad. “[E]verything that we call ‘history’, and value as ‘historical’,”
writes Henri Corbin interpreting Shaykh Ah. mad,

> is not “seen in Hurqalya,” is not an event in the Earth of Hurqalya, and therefore is
> devoid of religious interest and spiritual meaning. The orientation of the terrestrial
> Earth toward the Earth of Hurqalya, toward the celestial pole, confers a p o l a r
> dimension on terrestrial existence, gives it a direction not evolutionary but vertical,
> ascensional. (90, italics added)

Missing in Henri Corbin’s interpretation of Shaykh Ah. mad is any sense of
an historical evolution of consciousness toward the consciousness of the
oneness of humankind, which is the distinguishing feature of Bahá’u’lláh’s
Revelation. While humanity has always been one, the consciousness of such
oneness belongs to this day. The struggle to adapt to its revolutionary
implications in the necessary construction of a new world order over which
Shoghi Effendi presided following the blueprint of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá and the laws
laid down by Bahá’u’lláh in the Aqdas is, for Corbin interpreting S ha ykh
Ah. mad, “not ‘seen in Hurqalya’” and “therefore is devoid of religious interest
and spiritual meaning.” Indeed, the appearance of the Báb in the human form
of Mírzá ‘Alí Muh. ammad Shírází as an historical event taking place at two
hours and eleven minutes after sunset on May 23, 1844, or, as designated in the
Persian Bayán (Váh. id 2, Báb 7), “when two hours and eleven minutes [had
passed] from the evening preceding the fifth of Jamádíyu’l-Úlá, 1260 [A.H.],
which is the year 1270 of the mission [of Muh.ammad]” (quoted in Nabíl,
Dawn-Breakers 61n), is itself devoid of spiritual meaning. For Corbin, as for
most members of the Shaykhí school who rejected the claims of the Báb, the
return of the Hidden Imám lay in the soul’s ascent to the Hurqalya, even as for
many Christians the Return of Christ resides in the believer’s recognition of
him as the Savior, each act of conversion enacting his return. What those who
rejected the claims of the Báb saw in those claims was a literalization of the
sacred texts that corrupted their pure metaphoricity. They saw in the Báb the

rejection of the metaphorical reality the Báb uncompromisingly defended by
openly sacrificing his physical body to it.

The scandal of every Manifestation of God is the scandal of the
Manifestation’s physical body. This scandal, which the early Christian Church
attempted to resolve by the dogma of the Trinity, is resolved in the Revelation
of Bahá’u’lláh by an “ascensional” view of evolution in which the mineral,
vegetable, and animal kingdoms, far from being “devoid of religious interest,”
are themselves the outward forms of the human creation in the earlier stages of
its evolution, an evolution that has now achieved its providential goal in the
human consciousness of its purpose, a consciousness which, Bahá’u’lláh
declares, is “the same as the comprehension of Mine own Being” (Gleanings
327). The realm of Hurqalya, that is, has in this day become the Earth itself as
the Kingdom of God. The meaning of “return” as Bahá’u’lláh explains it in the
K i t á b - i - Í q á n is the union rather than separation, the marriage rather than
divorce, of Heaven and Earth. Not surprisingly, therefore, Bahá’u’lláh declares,
in the words of the Maid of Heaven, that

> when the hour at which Thy resistless Faith was to be made manifest did strike, Thou
> didst breathe a breath of Thy spirit into Thy Pen, and lo, the entire creation shook to
> its very foundations, unveiling to mankind such mysteries as lay hidden within the
> treasuries of Him Who is the Possessor of all created things. (Gleanings 15)

What has been unveiled within “the entire creation” had remained “hidden”
until “the hour” of Bahá’u’lláh’s Revelation struck. What then was called into
being was “a new creation, as a token of Our grace unto men” (Gleanings
29–30). What lay hidden in the Hurqalya of the Hidden Imám from all save a
chosen few was now the human kingdom itself as humanity’s coming of age.
To adjust to this coming of age and the global demands placed upon it becomes
in this day the work of the soul that for mystical Islam was the soul’s process of
ascent from the physical to the spiritual body. The metaphor of spatial ascent
has merged with the metaphor of linear time. The matter that is Earth has
become the energy that is spirit.

The Báb, Bahá’u’lláh, the Word, and the Soul
The martyrdom of the Báb, like the martyrdom of Christ, was the result of
binding the Word to a fixed “literal interpretation” (Kitáb-i-Íqán 26) that
attempted to usurp its authority. By arresting metaphor, cutting it off from what
Frye calls its “upward metamorphosis” (Great Code 76), the ceaseless unveiling
of hidden meanings that constitutes the inner life of Progressive Revelation is
imprisoned in a sepulcher of ignorance and prejudice. Directly addressing those
who rejected the Báb because they could not recognize in him the unveiling of
what was in previous scriptures veiled and concealed, Bahá’u’lláh in the Kitáb-
i-Íqán declares that what remained concealed because of their own blindness

14            THE JOURNAL OF BAHÁ’Í STUDIES                                  8.1.1997

emerged as malevolence. The concealing of all that had been revealed became
as malevolence the substitution of Satan for the Báb in their own hearts. “We
conclude Our argument,” Bahá’u’lláh writes, “with His words—exalted is He—
‘And whoso shall withdraw from the remembrance of the Merciful, We will
chain a Satan unto him, and he shall be his fast companion’” (Qur’án 43:36, qtd.
in Bahá’u’lláh, Kitáb-i-Íqán 257). “None apprehendeth the meaning of these
[symbolic] utterances,” Bahá’u’lláh explains,

> except them whose hearts are assured, whose souls have found favour with God, and
> whose minds are detached from all else but Him. In such utterances, the literal
> meaning, as generally understood by the people, is not what hath been intended. Thus
> it is recorded: “Every knowledge hath seventy meanings, of which one only is known
> amongst the people. And when the Qá’im shall arise, He shall reveal unto men all that
> which remaineth.” He also saith: “We speak one word, and by it we intend one and
> seventy meanings; each one of these meanings we can explain.” (Kitáb-i-Íqán 255)

The meaning hidden in the Súrih of Joseph in the Qur’án as the Báb unveiled
it in his commentary on it (revealed in the presence of Mullá H. usayn as the
Báb’s declaration of his station as the Gate to Bahá’u’lláh) lay in the desire of
all the prophets to be united with Bahá’u’lláh even as Joseph was finally united
with his father, Jacob. In the Revelation of the Báb, that is, the desire of all
previous prophets was fulfilled. For this reason, the Báb instructed Mullá
H. usayn to take to Tehran the first chapter of his commentary, which, he told
Mullá H. usayn, “enshrines a Mystery of such transcendent holiness as neither
H. ijáz nor Shíráz can hope to rival” (Nabíl, Dawn-Breakers 96). Eventually the
Báb’s commentary came into the hands of Bahá’u’lláh. At Mullá H. usayn’s
request, Mullá Muh. ammad, an enthusiastic student of S ha ykh Ah. mad and
Siyyid Kázim, took the scroll to Mírzá Músá, the brother of Bahá’u’lláh. Mírzá
Músá, in turn, presented it to Bahá’u’lláh who invited Mullá Muh.ammad into
his presence. Later Mullá Muh.ammad recounted to Nabíl what then took place:

> He [Bahá’u’lláh] glanced at its contents and began to read aloud to us certain of its
> passages. I sat enraptured as I listened to the sound of His voice and the sweetness of
> its melody. He had read a page of the scroll when, turning to His brother, He said:
> Músá, what have you to say? Verily I say, whoso believes in the Qur’án and
> recognizes its Divine origin, and yet hesitates, though it be for a moment, to admit
> that these soul-stirring words are endowed with the same regenerating power, has
> most assuredly erred in his judgment and has strayed far from the path of justice.

(Nabíl, Dawn-Breakers 106–7)

Bahá’u’lláh’s instantaneous recognition of the station of the Báb is the
recognition that is proper to the soul whose home is not the elemental body of
the senses but rather the eternal world of the spiritual body where the Báb and
Bahá’u’lláh forever remain in ceaseless “regenerating” communication with

each other, and upon which the creation depends so that if that communication
were ever withdrawn, even for an instant, the creation would cease to be.
Bahá’u’lláh points to such an instant as the passing away of “the entire
creation” so that “[n]othing remaineth, except My Face, the Ever-Abiding, the
Resplendent, the All-Glorious” (Gleanings 29). This “instant,” he explains,
takes place in the measureless interval (for Blake “less than a pulsation of the
artery”) between the abrogation of one dispensation and the inauguration of
another. “Consider the hour at which the supreme Manifestation of God
revealeth Himself unto men,” Bahá’u’lláh writes,

> Ere that hour cometh, the Ancient Being, Who is still unknown of men and hath not
> as yet given utterance to the Word of God, is Himself the All-Knower in a world
> devoid of any man that hath known Him. He is indeed the Creator without a creation.
> For at the very moment preceding His Revelation, each and every created thing shall
> be made to yield up its soul to God. (Gleanings 151, italics added)

Dismissing Mullá Muh. ammad from his presence, Bahá’u’lláh charged him to
take to Mullá H.usayn a gift of Russian sugar and a package of tea and to convey
to him the expression of Bahá’u’lláh’s appreciation and love. When Mullá
H. usayn received the gift and the message from Bahá’u’lláh, he was
overwhelmed to such a degree that Mullá Muh. ammad was at once amazed and
bewildered. “He started to his feet, received with bowed head the gift from my
hand, and fervently kissed it. He then took me in his arms, kissed my eyes . . . ,”
Mullá Muh. ammad told Nabíl. “I was amazed at the behaviour of Mullá
H. usayn,” Mullá Muh.ammad continued,

> What could be, I thought to myself, the nature of the bond that unites these two souls?
> What could have kindled so fervid a fellowship in their hearts? Why should Mullá
> H.usayn, in whose sight the pomp and circumstance of royalty were the merest trifle,
> have evinced such gladness at the sight of so inconsiderable a gift from the hands of
> Bahá’u’lláh? I was puzzled by this thought and could not unravel its mystery. (Qtd.

in Nabíl, Dawn-Breakers 107)

Despite the fact that he was a student of Shaykh Ah. mad and Siyyid Kázim,
Mullá Muh. ammad could not unravel the “mystery” of the Hurqalya, the
celestial Earth in which Mullá H. usayn was forever bonded to the Báb and
Bahá’u’lláh, an Earth in which “so inconsiderable a gift” as Russian sugar and a
package of tea assumed the metaphorical dimension of ecstatic spiritual
communion. Not surprisingly, many of those who rejected the Báb believed that
his ecstatic disciples were drugged.

Plato in Ion compares what he calls the “divine insanity” of the inspired poet
to the Corybantes, the followers of Dionysus, “who lose all control over their
reason in the enthusiasm of the sacred dance; and, during the supernatural

16            THE JOURNAL OF BAHÁ’Í STUDIES                                  8.1.1997

possession, are excited to the rhythm and harmony which they communicate to
men.” “Like the Bacchantes,” he goes on,

> who, when possessed by the God draw honey and milk from the rivers, in which,

> 7: 197–98)

Because, for Plato, the poets like Homer declare themselves to be divinely
possessed, they or their followers may mistake “simple water” for “honey and
milk.” He therefore exiled the poets from his ideal Republic lest they seduce the
populace into embracing a delusion as truth. Comparing the poet’s Muse to the
magnet that has the power of attracting other iron rings to create “a long chain
of rings,” Plato sees an entire people drawn to a poet’s verses to create what he
calls “a chain and a succession” capable, like the Maenads in Euripides’
Bacchae, of reducing the civic order to chaos. Precisely this fear, it may be
argued, instigated and propelled the attempt of the Persian authorities to wipe
out the Bábí community.

Plato’s fear of “divine insanity” is a fear that many non-Muslims have over
the centuries projected onto Muh. ammad and the verses of the Qur’án, which
they find unintelligible. “Many people, especially non-Muslims, who read the
Qur’án for the first time,” writes Siyyid Hossein Nasr (who might well be
commenting upon the reaction of the ‘ulamá to the “ungrammatical” nature of
the Báb’s verses),

> are struck by what appears as a kind of incoherence from the human point of view. It

Plato rejected the poets, not because he himself rejected divine possession,
but because he believed it could neither be directly communicated nor long

sustained. By treating divine possession as entirely devoid of “every particle of
reason and understanding,” he knew that he had himself failed to understand it.
He could therefore declare in his seventh Epistle: “I certainly have composed no
work in regard to it [divine madness], nor shall I ever do so in the future, for
there is no way of putting it into words like other studies.” “Acquaintance with
it,” he goes on to explain, “must come rather after a long period of attendance or
instruction in the subject itself and of close acquaintance when suddenly like a
blaze kindled by a leaping spark, it is generated in the soul and at once becomes
self-sustaining” (341 C–D).

In the Shaykhí school, the generation in the soul that “at once becomes self-
sustaining” is mythically explained in terms of the Hurqalya, the intermediate
world between the senses and the realm of pure intelligence. The reason it is
“self-sustaining,” Shaykh Ah.mad argued, is because the Hurqalya is the eternal
home of the soul to which it inherently belongs. Though Plato in his Dialogues,
including the Republic, was himself the author of a similar mythical formulation
of the soul’s reality, he opposed the tendency of the populace to take such a
formulation literally and, what was worse, the tendency of the Sophists to make
a religion of literalism, thereby imprisoning the population in the tyranny of a
superstition to which it was far too willing to submit.

Bahá’u’lláh, like Plato, composed no work analyzing the generative power of
the Word by explaining the unknown divinity that informs it. “Nay, forbid it, O
my God,” declares Bahá’u’lláh,

> that I should have uttered such words as must of necessity imply the existence of any
> direct relationship between the Pen of Thy Revelation and the essence of all created
> things. Far, far are They Who are related to Thee above the conception of such
> relationship! All comparisons and likenesses fail to do justice to the Tree of Thy
> Revelation, and every way is barred to the comprehension of the Manifestation of
Thy Self and the Day Spring of Thy Beauty.

Far, far from Thy glory be what mortal man can affirm of Thee, or attribute unto
> Thee, or the praise with which he can glorify Thee! Whatever duty Thou hast
> prescribed unto Thy servants of extolling to the utmost Thy majesty and glory is but a
> token of Thy grace unto them, that they may be enabled to ascend unto the station
> conferred upon their own inmost being, the station of the knowledge of their own
> selves. (Gleanings 4–5)

Recognizing and respecting the limitations of human beings whose
knowledge is bound ultimately to “the knowledge of their own selves” rather
than a knowledge of what lies beyond them, Bahá’u’lláh nevertheless declares
that the knowledge of themselves is a “token of [God’s] grace unto them” that
depends for its reception upon “extolling to the utmost [God’s] majesty and
glory.” Human beings must extol “to the utmost” what lies beyond them in
order to penetrate to “their own inmost being.” In that paradox of what is

18            THE JOURNAL OF BAHÁ’Í STUDIES                                 8.1.1997

beyond them as the door to what lies within them, resides what Bahá’u’lláh
calls the “mystery” of the soul.

“Verily I say,” Bahá’u’lláh writes,

> the human soul is, in its essence, one of the signs of God, a mystery among His
> mysteries. It is one of the mighty signs of the Almighty, the harbinger that
> proclaimeth the reality of all the worlds of God. Within it lieth concealed that which
> the world is now utterly incapable of apprehending. (Gleanings 160)

What “lieth concealed” is, Bahá’u’lláh continues, “a station such as no pen can
depict, or tongue describe.” After its “ascension” from the elemental world of
the senses that constitutes its “return . . . to the glory of the Beloved,” it will,
Bahá’u’lláh declares,

> be possessed of such power that all the worlds which the Almighty hath created can
> benefit through him. Such a soul provideth, at the bidding of the Ideal King and
> Divine Educator, the pure leaven that leaveneth the world of being, and furnisheth the
> power through which the arts and wonders of the world are made manifest.

(Gleanings 160)

The “divine madness” that Plato describes, the “Celestial Patroness” who
dictated to the “slumbring” Milton, and the feminine Muse (“Daughters of
Beulah! Muses who inspire the Poet’s Song” [Milton 2:1]) who descended
down the nerves of Blake’s right arm into his writing hand are in their inmost
reality “the power” of ascended souls “through which the arts and wonders of
the world are made manifest.” The myths that enact their regenerating power
are contained within the metaphoricity of language which is, ultimately, the
Revelation of the Word understood as “the bidding of the Ideal King and Divine
Educator” that metaphor serves in order to make the arts manifest. To the
amazed and bewildered Mullá Muh. ammad, the “wonders of the world” were
contained as a mystery in a loaf of Russian sugar and a package of tea.

The Kitáb-i-Íqán and the Marriage Chamber
Metaphorically binding the Revelations of the Báb and Bahá’u’lláh to the divine
“process toward accomplishment” is the focus upon the holy city, New
Jerusalem, Bahá’u’lláh’s “City of Certitude” that is “renewed and re-adorned”
once in about a thousand years (Kitáb-i-Íqán 197, 199). In addressing Mount
Carmel, the Mountain of God where Isaiah preached and Bahá’u’lláh pitched
his tent, Bahá’u’lláh metaphorically addresses the mountain as his bride. In the
“Tablet of Carmel,” he sees the mountain as the Maid of Heaven “coming down
from God out of heaven, prepared as a bride adorned for her husband” (Rev.
21:2). As metaphor, the Revelation of Bahá’u’lláh celebrates the divine
marriage or hieros gamos that now in his Revelation achieves its destined
consummation in the establishment of the Kingdom of God on earth.

Uniting the spiritual and physical worlds anticipated by all the Semitic
prophets, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá writes: “The spiritual world is like unto the phenomenal
world. They are the exact counterpart of each other. Whatever objects appear in
this world of existence are the outer pictures of the world of heaven”
(Promulgation of Universal Peace 10). This world as a metaphor of heaven, if
denied its full metaphorical status as the outer picture of heaven, becomes a world
in which God is dead, entombed in what Frye called a “dead language” (18), a
death humanly enacted in the martyrdom of the Báb and the crucifixion of Christ.
“We perceive none . . . amongst the people of the earth who, sincerely yearning
for the Truth, seeketh the guidance of the divine Manifestations concerning the
abstruse matters of his Faith,” declares Bahá’u’lláh at the dark conclusion of the
Kitáb-i-Íqán. “All are dwellers in the land of oblivion . . .” (256).

As he observed the total disintegration of the Bábí community, Bahá’u’lláh,
prior to his own Revelation, was determined to rescue from “the land of
oblivion” the immediate relatives of the Báb. For this reason, in 1862, when he
was informed that the Báb’s maternal uncles were visiting Baghdad on their
way back from their pilgrimage to the holy shrines of the Imáms in Iraq, he sent
a messenger to them inviting them to his home. Only one of the uncles accepted
his invitation; H. ájí Mírzá Siyyid Muh. ammad arrived armed with questions that
raised most of the Shi‘ite issues about which the ‘ulamá had interrogated the
Báb in Tabríz. Bahá’u’lláh, using the written advice of the Báb, was determined
that the sorry spectacle would not be repeated.

“It is not permissible,” the Báb wrote in the Persian Bayán,

> to ask questions from Him Whom God will make manifest, except that which well
> beseemeth Him. For His station is that of the Essence of divine Revelation. . . .
> Whatever evidence of bounty is witnessed in the world, is but an image of His
> bounty; and every thing owes its existence to His Being. . . . The Bayán is, from
> beginning to end, the repository of all of His attributes, and the treasury of both His
> fire and His light. Should anyone desire to ask questions, he is allowed to do so only
> in writing, that he may derive ample understanding from His written reply and that it
> may serve as a sign from his Beloved. However, let no one ask aught that may prove
> unworthy of His lofty station. For instance, were a person to inquire the price of straw
> from a merchant of rubies, how ignorant would he be and how unacceptable.
> Similarly unacceptable would be questions of the highest-ranking people of the world
> in His presence, except such words as He Himself would utter about Himself in the
> Day of His manifestation. (Selections 101, italics added)

Accordingly, following the instruction of the Persian Bayán, B a h á ’ u ’ l l á h
instructed the maternal uncle to prepare his questions in a written form and
deliver them to him the following day. Bahá’u’lláh would then prepare his
written reply, using “such words as He Himself would utter about Himself in
the Day of His manifestation.”

20            THE JOURNAL OF BAHÁ’Í STUDIES                                  8.1.1997

Not wishing to accuse the maternal uncle, as his guest, of treating his nephew
the Báb as the ‘ulamá had treated him, Bahá’u’lláh, in his written response that
gradually unveiled his own station, made it abundantly clear that it was not for
the servant to test God, but for God to test the servant. “If at the time of the
appearance of Him Whom God will make manifest all the dwellers of the earth
were to bear witness unto a thing whereunto He beareth witness differently,”
declares the Báb in the Persian Bayán,

> His testimony would be like unto the sun, while theirs would be even as a false image
> produced in a mirror which is not facing the sun. For had it been otherwise their
> testimony would have proved a faithful reflection of His testimony. (Selections 100)

The divine authority with which Bahá’u’lláh addressed the maternal uncle of
the Báb was carefully and lovingly modulated. He addressed the uncle as his
brother and shared with him the anguish he was experiencing in Baghdad after
his return from his two-year voluntary exile. At the same time, however,
quoting verses from the Qur’án that applied directly to the initial reception of
Muh. ammad, Bahá’u’lláh made it clear that they applied equally to those who
had rejected the Báb and, indeed, to those Bábís who were now rejecting
Bahá’u’lláh as the One whom the Báb announced. “‘If God should chastise men
for their perverse doings, He would not leave upon the earth a moving thing!
But to an appointed time doth He respite them’” [Qur’án 16:61] (Qtd. in Kitáb-
i-Íqán 170). The maternal uncle could not help but be aware of the fact that the
eighteen-year period of his “respite” was over and that now, in the spiritual
presence of Bahá’u’lláh, being directly addressed in writing by him, the
“appointed time” had arrived. “‘Whoso sayeth ‘why’ or ‘wherefore’ hath
spoken blasphemy!’” Bahá’u’lláh continued.

> Were these people to shake off the slumber of negligence and realize that which their
> hands have wrought, they would surely perish, and would of their own accord cast
> themselves into fire—their end and real abode. Have they not heard that which He
> hath revealed: ‘He shall not be asked of His doings’ (Qur’án 21:23)? In the light of
> these utterances, how can man be so bold as to question Him, and busy himself with
> idle sayings? (Kitáb-i-Íqán 171)

“A Revelation, of which the Prophets of God, His saints and chosen ones,
have either not been informed, or which, in pursuance of God’s inscrutable
Decree, they have not disclosed,” Bahá’u’lláh writes again, defending the
Revelation of the Báb,

> —such a Revelation these mean and depraved people have sought to measure with
> their own deficient minds, their own deficient learning and understanding. Should it
fail to conform to their standards, they straightway reject it. “Thinkest thou that the

> greater part of them hear or understand? They are even like unto the brutes! yea, they
> stray even further from the path!” [Qur’án 25:44] (Kitáb-i-Íqán 244)

Since, however, the maternal uncle had never actively opposed the Báb and had
shown in Bahá’u’lláh’s presence a genuine desire to resolve his bewilderment,
Bahá’u’lláh recognized in him one who had, by a grace bestowed, now
spiritually as well as physically attained his presence. “Inasmuch as it hath been
clearly shown that only those who are initiated into the divine mysteries can
comprehend the melodies uttered by the Bird of Heaven,” Bahá’u’lláh declares,

> it is therefore incumbent upon every one to seek enlightenment from the illumined in
> heart and from the Treasuries of divine mysteries regarding the intricacies of God’s
> Faith and the abstruse allusions in the utterances of the Day-springs of Holiness. Thus
> will these mysteries be unravelled, not by the aid of acquired learning, but solely
> through the assistance of God and the outpourings of His grace. “Ask ye, therefore, of
> them that have the custody of the Scriptures, if ye know it not.” [Qur’án 16:43]
> (Kitáb-i-Íqán 191–92)

The maternal uncle of the Báb, in the reading of Bahá’u’lláh’s written reply
to his questions, had entered the presence of “the Bird of Paradise” and there,
under Bahá’u’lláh’s interpretative guidance, had “comprehended the melodies.”
Having asked of the One who had “the custody of the Scriptures,” the maternal
uncle was rewarded with an unravelling of their “mysteries.”

Bahá’u’lláh describes the unraveling of the divine mysteries hidden within
the scriptures in terms of the marriage metaphor. “Within every garden,”
Bahá’u’lláh explains,

> they [the initiated] will behold the mystic bride of inner meaning enshrined within the
> chambers of utterance in the utmost grace and fullest adornment. Most of the verses
> of the Qur’án indicate, and bear witness to, this spiritual theme. (Kitáb-i-Íqán 140)

Here, enacting the soul’s direct encounter with divine verses and the vivid
actuality of the soul’s response, Bahá’u’lláh sees the verses not in the likeness
of a garden, not as a simile, but as the spiritual reality of the verses, the verses
as they exist in the Paradise of the Manifestation’s Presence directly
communicated through “the chambers of [His] utterance,” the “Nightingale of
Paradise” singing “upon the twigs of the Tree of Eternity, with holy and sweet
melodies” (Bahá’í Prayers 209).

“The overpowering effect of the manner in which He wrote,” declared Mullá
H.usayn, describing the Báb’s composition (revelation) of his commentary on
the Súrih of Joseph, “was heightened by the gentle intonation of His voice
which accompanied His writing. . . . I sat enraptured by the magic of His
voice. . .” (Nabíl, Dawn-Breakers 61, italics added). Indeed, Mullá H. usayn

22            THE JOURNAL OF BAHÁ’Í STUDIES                                   8.1.1997

was so enraptured that when he begged leave to depart, the Báb bade him be
seated. “If you leave in such a state, whoever sees you will assuredly say: ‘This
poor youth has lost his mind’” (61) the Báb told him. “I sat enraptured as I
listened to the sound of His voice and the sweetness of its melody” (Nabíl,
Dawn-Breakers 106–7), Mullá Muh. ammad declared as he listened to
Bahá’u’lláh reading aloud “the soul-stirring words” of the Báb’s commentary,
which, Bahá’u’lláh declared, were endowed with the “regenerating power” of
the verses of the Qur’án.

In the Islamic conception of spirit, the “regenerating power” of the Word is
designated, as in other Semitic languages, by two sharply contrasting views of
breath: nafs and rúh. . Nafs is the breath of the throat that, coming from the
entrails, is “carnal” and “bound up with the blood.” Rúh. is the breath of the
nostrils that, coming from the brain, confers “the discernment of spiritual
qualities” (Massignon, “The Idea of the Spirit in Islam” 309). R úh. i s
associated with pneuma, the divine breath that God breathed into the nostrils of
Adam (“And the Lord God formed man of the dust of the ground, and breathed
into his nostrils the breath of life; and man became a living soul”[Gen. 2:7]).
Nafs is associated with “the dust of the ground,” the elemental body that comes
from the dust and returns to the dust. In Islam, rúh. is identified with the
‘internal upheavals’ felt by Muh. ammad at the beginning of his prophetic
mission when, according to Aisha, Muh. ammad first had “a vision of isolated,
luminous letters,” which were accompanied by isolated sounds (Massignon,
“The Idea” 319).

Bahá’u’lláh refers to these isolated letters cited at the head of certain chapters
of the Qur’án in the Kitáb-i-Íqán. “In the beginning of His Book,” declares
Bahá’u’lláh of Muh. ammad’s revelation of the Qur’án,

> He saith: “‘Alif. Lám. Mím. No doubt is there about this Book: It is a guidance unto
> the God-fearing” (Qur’án 2:1). In the disconnected letters of the Qur’án the mysteries
> of the divine Essence are enshrined, and within their shells the pearls of His Unity are
> treasured. . . . Outwardly they signify Muh.ammad Himself, Whom God addresseth
> saying, “O Muh.ammad, there is no doubt nor uncertainty about this Book which hath
> been sent down from the heaven of divine Unity. In it is guidance unto them that fear
> God.” (202–3)

The sound identified with each of the “disconnected letters” of the Qur’án,
sounds that taught Muh.ammad how to read and to write “this Book which hath
been sent down from the heaven of divine Unity,” enshrined “the mysteries of
the divine Essence.” The sounds were, indeed, the breath (r úh. ) that God
breathed into the nostrils of Adam, which is to say the generating power of God,
which in its regenerating form as chant becomes a repetition of God’s eternal
act of creation. What, then, Mullá H. usayn heard in the gentle voice of the Báb
that accompanied the motions of his pen and what Mullá Muh.ammad heard in

the voice of Bahá’u’lláh as he read aloud from the Báb’s commentary is what
Carmel in Bahá’u’lláh’s “Tablet of Carmel” heard as Bahá’u’lláh directed his
steps towards her: “. . . the shrilling voice of Thy Pen, a voice Thou didst ordain
as Thy trumpet-call amidst Thy people.” “And when the hour at which Thy
resistless Faith was to be made manifest did strike,” declares Carmel,

> Thou didst breathe a breath of Thy Spirit into Thy Pen, and lo, the entire creation
> shook to its very foundations, unveiling to mankind such mysteries as lay hidden
> within the treasuries of Him Who is the Possessor of all created things. (Gleanings
> 14–15)

When, further, Bahá’u’lláh points out that within the “shells” of these
disconnected letters are contained “the pearls of His Unity,” he is extending his
metaphor to identify “the pearls of His Unity” with the virgin “Brides of inner
meaning” who, in the breathing aloud (rúh. ) of the divine verses “hasten forth,
unveiled, out of their mystic mansions, and manifest themselves in the ancient
realm of being” (Kitáb-i-Íqán 175–76). These “Brides of inner meaning,” like
the h.úrís who in the Qur’án greet the blessed in Paradise, unite with the soul
that has opened itself to receive the Word so that the relationship between the
initiated soul and the Word is the union of the lover of the Word with the Word
itself, now experienced as the Beloved.

Precisely this nuptial union was celebrated by both T.áhirih and Quddús in
their martyrdom. For three days and nights, alone in her room, redolent with the
choicest perfume, herself apparelled in a gown of snow-white silk, T. áhirih
prepared to meet her Beloved by composing odes to him which she chanted
aloud to herself. Paraded in chains through the streets, assailed with knives and
axes by the populace, Quddús, before being delivered to the flames, cried aloud:
“‘Would that my mother were with me, and could see with her own eyes the
splendour of my nuptials!’” (Nabíl, Dawn-Breakers 413). Their souls, they
believed, had entered the divine marriage chamber into which, as the
Bridegroom, Christ had promised to take the faithful upon his return.

“Then shall the Kingdom of heaven be likened unto ten virgins, which took
their lamps, and went forth to meet the bridegroom,” Matthew’s gospel reads,

> And five of them were wise, and five were foolish. They that were foolish took their
> lamps, and took no oil with them: But the wise took oil in their vessels with their
> lamps. While the bridegroom tarried, they all slumbered and slept. And at midnight
> there was a cry made, Behold the bridegroom cometh; go ye out to meet him. Then all
> those virgins arose, and trimmed their lamps. And the foolish said unto the wise, Give
> us of your oil; for our lamps are gone out. But the wise answered, saying, Not so; lest
> there be not enough for us and you: but go ye rather to them that sell, and buy for
> yourselves. And while they went to buy, the bridegroom came; and they that were
> ready went in with him to the marriage: and the door was shut. Afterward came also
24           THE JOURNAL OF BAHÁ’Í STUDIES                                 8.1.1997

> the other virgins, saying, Lord, Lord, open to us. But he answered and said, Verily I
> say unto you, I know you not. (Matt. 25:1–12)

In these verses the entire Kitáb-i-Íqán is prefiguratively enacted, the maternal
uncle of the Báb inhabiting the metaphorical world of the Word, which is the
realm of the soul, to become one of the wise virgins. The foolish virgins, who
went to the sellers of oil (the ‘ulamá), come “afterward” and are unknown to the
bridegroom. “We conclude Our argument with His words—exalted is He,”
writes Bahá’u’lláh at the end of the Kitáb-i-Íqán, “—‘And whoso shall withdraw
from the remembrance of the Merciful, We will chain a Satan unto him, and he
shall be his fast companion’(Qur’án 43:36). ‘And whoso turneth away from My
remembrance, truly his shall be a life of misery’” (Qur’án 20:124).

The Descent of the New Jerusalem
In this article, I have attempted, among other things, to demonstrate, with
reference to the metaphor of the New Jerusalem descending as bride, the
operation of a single, dynamic, and unifying metaphor moving through “a
process accomplishing itself,” which Bahá’u’lláh describes as Progressive
Revelation. My purpose has been to invite the reader to inhabit a metaphorical
world, not as a fiction, but as the soul’s reality, the mystery of which can never
be fully unveiled, its inmost essence being known only to God. “Give me a
place to stand, and I will move the world,” Archimedes is reported to have said
with reference to the principle of the lever. To “move the world,” I suggest, it
is now no longer possible to stand where Northrop Frye stood in the
composition of The Great Code: The Bible and Literature. The world he
addressed as a Christian has moved on to a position of radical interdependence
in which all its parts mirror or reflect each other, confronting us with a
metaphorical unity that we do not yet know how to embrace creatively. In
revealing the Second Coming as what still lay hidden in the Bible, Bahá’u’lláh,
who is that Coming, suggests that in the rejection of him (as in the rejection of
the Báb), the Second Coming as the hidden metaphorical content of the Bible
has become the gigantic, malevolent shadow or anti-Christ cast upon this
century, a shadow that may be compared to Yeats’s “rough beast, its hour
come round at last,” that in Yeats’s poem, “The Second Coming,” “[s]louches
towards Bethlehem to be born” (Poems 184). The Second Coming, that is,
appears outwardly in the rejection of it, as “fire and vengeance,” though
inwardly in its reality it is “light and mercy.” The “calamity” that now to all
outward appearances faces the world contains a hidden “providence” (“My
calamity is My providence”) (Bahá’u’lláh, Hidden Words 15).

Judgment and Resurrection, the subjects of the Book of Revelation and the
Kitáb-i-Íqán, thus emerge in the context of the Revelations of the Báb and
Bahá’u’lláh as the same event experienced in two distinct perspectives. That

event, understood as a metaphorical event of the soul, is the descent of the
New Jerusalem adorned as a bride, an event, which in the passing away of
former things (“for the former things are passed away” [Rev. 21:4]),
constitutes either a “new creation” or the “nothing” that “remaineth.” What is
immediately at stake in the acceptance or rejection of Bahá’u’lláh, as
Bahá’u’lláh makes abundantly clear in the Kitáb-i-Íqán, is the fate of the soul.
In the dismissal of soul as an epiphenomenon of matter that in itself is nothing
at all, that fate, as a human judgment upon it, has by many already been made,
though the consequences of its making have not as yet, outside the Revelation
of Bahá’u’lláh, been fully measured.

By arguing for a shift in focus as a new point on which to stand, I am
suggesting that the Revelations of the Báb and Bahá’u’lláh now provide a lever
that has moved the world into a new divinely ordained position of unity. To
position ourselves upon this Archimedian point is the divine purpose of their
Revelations. As Bahá’u’lláh insists in the Kitáb-i-Íqán, the Archimedian point
was unveiled by the Báb as the “Primal Point” around which all the Prophets of
the past have circled, their coming together in and as the Báb unveiling in their
constellated union the Glory of Bahá’u’lláh as the object of their ceaseless
yearning. Only, Bahá’u’lláh insists, through the descent of the “Brides of inner
meaning,” who are the indwelling spirit of metaphoricity inhabiting as the wise
virgins the world’s scriptures, into the sanctified hearts that are prepared to
receive them, is the truth of his Revelation unveiled in its multidimensionality, a
multidimensionality that Dante, in the concluding canto of his P a r a d i s o ,
metaphorically presents as a multifoliate white rose.

Employing the same metaphor, Bahá’u’lláh addresses humanity as “mortal
birds” who, throughout Persian literature, have sung their song of praise to the
rose and must now fully inhabit its reality. “Hear Me, ye mortal birds!”
proclaims Bahá’u’lláh,

> In the Rose Garden of changeless splendor a Flower hath begun to bloom, compared
> to which every other flower is but a thorn, and before the brightness of Whose glory
> the very essence of beauty must pale and wither. Arise, therefore, and, with the whole
> enthusiasm of your hearts, with all the eagerness of your souls, the full fervor of your
> will, and the concentrated efforts of your entire being, strive to attain the paradise of
> His presence, and endeavor to inhale the fragrance of the incorruptible Flower, to
> breathe the sweet savors of holiness, and to obtain a portion of this perfume of
> celestial glory. Whoso followeth this counsel will break his chains asunder, will taste
> the abandonment of enraptured love, will attain unto his heart’s desire, and will
> surrender his soul into the hands of his Beloved. Bursting through his cage, he will,
> even as the bird of the spirit, wing his flight to his holy and everlasting nest.

(Gleanings 320–21)

The union of the nightingale and the rose, a recurrent metaphor in Persian poetry,
here becomes the metaphor of the soul’s union with the Manifestation. In this

26         THE JOURNAL OF BAHÁ’Í STUDIES                              8.1.1997

union, the soul enters the everlasting nest of the ceaselessly unfolding Word, a
nest that is the wedding chamber into which the long-expected bridegroom takes
the waiting virgins whose lamps are filled with oil. To enter this metaphorical
realm, the eternal home of the soul, is the purpose of all the world’s scriptures.
The recognition of this ascension from the physical to the spiritual, the literal to
the metaphorical, as an evolutionary process within the creation and within a
human history that has now completed the earthly phase of its progressive
revelation is a recognition that resides as “the hidden and treasured Gem”
(Gleanings 30) in the inmost sanctuary of Bahá’u’lláh’s Revelation.

The Earth as “the seat of [God’s] mighty throne” (Gleanings 30) has rendered
material evolution a part of Progressive Revelation, matter itself now standing
unveiled as a manifestation of the same divine energy that propels the soul to its
eternal union with the Word. In the Revelation of Bahá’u’lláh, scripture now
embraces the entire multifoliate creation “regenerated and made new”
(Gleanings 27) by a new outpouring of the Word. To reject this outpouring is to
convert its energy to destructive ends that are in their ultimate nihilism
unthinkable only because they would include an end to human thought itself, an
end that, in the words of Bahá’u’lláh, would leave “the Creator without a
creation” (Gleanings 151). That the Creator will not be so left resides in the
“providence” that “calamity” is, God’s love for the creation being greater than
any human effort to destroy it. Precisely for this reason, the disciples of
Bahá’u’lláh in their long obligatory prayer repeat: “Look not upon my hopes
and my doings, nay rather look upon Thy will that hath encompassed the
heavens and the earth” (Bahá’í Prayers 8–9). In the pure metaphoricity of the
Word, that encompassing will is progressively unveiled as Bahá’u’lláh, the
glory of God.
