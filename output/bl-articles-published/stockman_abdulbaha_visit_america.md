> **Abstract:** \`Abdu'l-Bahá Abbás visited North America from April 11 to December 5, 1912. His eight-month sojourn took Him to some 38 localities in 15 states and the province of Quebec, Canada. Because His North American trip followed on an earlier European visit, when \`Abdu'l-Bahá arrived in New York He had a developed daily routine.  
>   
> It appears that He gave approximately 351 talks during His trip (of which 139 were published in _The Promulgation of Universal Peace_), an average of 1.5 per day. Extrapolation from known attendance figures and some statistical assumptions allow one to arrive at a rough figure of 86,000 people who attended them. Particularly noteworthy are the talks He gave in thirty-one liberal and moderate white Protestant churches, fourteen Theosophical and other metaphysical gatherings, five universities, three synagogues, one African American church, the Lake Mohonk Peace Conference, Hull House, and the fourth annual NAACP conference.  
>   
> \`Abdu'l-Bahá’s talks can be divided roughly into two types: those to the public and those primarily to Bahá'í audiences. A “generic” public talk gradually developed throughout His journey that emphasized up to ten principles of the Bahá'í Faith. Talks to Bahá'ís, on the other hand—especially the last talk to them in each locality—usually emphasized two things: the Covenant and obedience to \`Abdu'l-Bahá as the Center of the Covenant on the one hand, and teaching the Faith on the other. The former emphasis presaged some provisions of the Will and Testament, while the latter anticipated aspects of the Tablets of the Divine Plan.

> No one has yet assembled all the newspaper articles that resulted from His visit. Well over 100 articles are currently available. Coverage was almost uniformly positive, much to the surprise of the Bahá'ís, who feared 'Abdu'l-Bahá “would simply be placed on a level with many traveling ‘Swamis.’”  
>   
> It is difficult to assess the impact 'Abdu'l-Bahá’s visit had on North America and its Bahá'ís. A comparative approach is particularly illuminating. The first “Oriental” teacher to come to the United States was Protap Chunder Majumdar (1840-1905), a leader of the Brahmo Samaj, who visited over sixty Unitarian churches in the Northeastern United States in 1883. Anagarika Dharmapala (1864-1933) spoke at the Parliament and then went on a three-month tour of the United States, to which he returned in 1896-97 and at least once subsequently. He helped establish Buddhism in the United States. Better known is Swami Vivekananda (1863-1902) of the Rama Krishna Mission, who spoke repeatedly at the Parliament and then crisscrossed the United States for two and a half years, lecturing on Hinduism and criticizing Christian missionaries. Vivekananda’s aggressive speaking style, his eloquent English, and his considerable western education made him a formidable and controversial speaker, which may explain why his travels in the United States are remembered by scholars of religion better than anyone else’s. Unlike Majumdar, Vivekananda created a community of American Hindus, the Vedanta Society, though the group had only a hundred or so members when Vivekananda left America and it still had one hundred members in 1912. \[Carl T. Jackson, _Vedanta for the West: The Ramakrishna Movement in the United States_ (Bloomington: Indiana University Press, 1994), 108.\]

> Majumdar, Dharmapala, Vivekanada, and other eastern teachers such as D. T. Suzuki (the principal founder of Zen Buddhism in the United States) had a significant impact on American culture because they were the harbingers of ancient and vast religious-cultural traditions; they were the tip of an iceberg, the rest of which was increasingly accessible because of colonialism, growing commercial ties with Asia, military involvement in the region, tourism, and extensive wealth that could be lavished on the endowing of university chairs and the subvention of extensive translation efforts. In contrast, in 1912 (and even today) the Bahá'í Faith is a small religious community, a minority in every land where it is found, with a relatively undeveloped secondary literature and cultural expressions. If 'Abdu'l-Bahá were thought of as the tip of an iceberg, the iceberg is yet to congeal completely, and its vast submarine stretches will be easier to contour a few centuries from now.

> \`Abdu'l-Bahá did have one advantage that the other Asian teachers lacked: a significant number of American followers located in dozens of cities across the United States. One notable result was the ability to organize numerous local public and private meetings and attract the rank and file of the local population. But Bahá'í communities of 1912 were poorly organized and uncertain whether they were a separate religious community or a leaven destined to spread Bahá'í teachings within the existing churches. As a result, \`Abdu'l-Bahá’s visit did not immediately produce a large number of new, active members. Ironically, His sojourn also sharpened ideological divisions within the American Bahá'í community.  
>   
> 'Abdu'l-Bahá was very pleased by the way Americans received Him. He frequently ordered His Persian secretaries to send bundles of newspaper clippings to Haifa or Iran so that others could share in His happiness. The Persian pages of _The Star of the West_ spread positive reports of His trip throughout the Persian-speaking Bahá'í world. The confidence and increased self esteem that such reports gave to the local Bahá'ís cannot be underestimated.  
>   
> According to Shoghi Effendi, 'Abdu'l-Bahá’s trip to the western world was the “culmination” of His ministry and its “greatest exploit.” \[Shoghi Effendi, _God Passes By,_ 295.\] Certainly, the impact of 'Abdu'l-Bahá’s journey is still being felt; the seeds He planted are still germinating, and an ample harvest awaits its gathering by every generation. Historians face much work ahead of them to discover the myriad facets of His American tour.

      `Abdu’l-Bahá’s Visit to North America, 1912:

A Preliminary Analysis

Robert H. Stockman

`Abdu’l-Bahá Abbás visited North America from April 11 to

> December 5, 1912. His eight-month sojourn took Him to some
> 44 localities in 15 states and the provinces of Quebec and Ontario,
> Canada. Because His North American trip followed on an earlier
> European visit (Aug. 22-Dec. 2, 1911), when `Abdu’l-Bahá arrived
> in New York He had a developed routine. He established Himself
> in a hotel or, ideally, a rented house, so that He had the space to
> provide hospitality and the freedom to welcome people of all races.
> He held what today we would call a press conference shortly after
> arrival, then began a daily schedule that involved correspondence
> in the morning, private meetings with individuals and small groups,
> sometimes a public talk in the salon before lunch because the press of
> visitors became too great for individual meetings, an afternoon walk
> in a park (sometimes accompanied by a crowd) or an appointment,
> then an evening meeting, often in the house of a Bahá’í. The latter on
> occasion might start with dinner and continue into the late evening or
> early morning.

When `Abdu’l-Bahá arrived on April 11, He already had three
invitations to major events: the Persian-American Educational
Society annual conference in Washington, D.C., April 18-20; the
Bahai Temple Unity annual convention a week later in Chicago; and
the Lake Mohonk Peace Conference in the Catskill Mountains of
central New York, May 14-16. Therefore, after nine days in New
York City, during which He spoke at the Church of the Ascension,

Lights of ‘Irfán Book Thirteen

Columbia University, New York University, and at the Bowery Mis-
sion, `Abdu’l-Bahá went to Washington for a week (without visiting
the Philadelphia and Baltimore Bahá’í communities), then Chicago
for a week. At that point he had visited the three largest Bahá’í
communities in the United States, located in the country’s three
most influential cities. He headed back to Washington, visiting
the Cleveland and Pittsburgh Bahá’ís on the way, fulfilled further
commitments in the American capital, then returned to New York
City briefly and headed to Lake Mohonk. His first month was a
whirlwind of activity.

For the next two months—from May 17 to July 23—`Abdu’l-Bahá
used New York City as His headquarters. He rented a house, gave
talks there during the afternoon and usually in the houses of Bahá’ís
in the evening, and spoke to various churches and societies. From
New York He made excursions to greater Boston (May 22-25),
Philadelphia (June 8-10), and Montclair, New Jersey (June 21-29).
Particularly notable were His talks at Clark University, the annual
Unitarian Association conference, the annual meeting of the Free
Religious Association, and Russell Conwell’s moderately evangelical
Baptist Temple in Philadelphia.

Escaping the heat and humidity of New York City , `Abdu’l-Bahá
made a two-day visit to Boston, then spent twenty-three days in
Dublin, a major summer resort area for the wealthy in southern
New Hampshire (July 25-Aug. 16). `Abdu’l-Bahá initially planned
to depart America in September.1 The earnest pleading of the
California Bahá'ís, however, caused Him to change plans and head
west. Leaving Dublin, in the next two months He visited Green
Acre Bahá'í School (Aug. 16-23), greater Boston again (Aug. 23-30),
Montreal (Aug. 31-Sept. 9), Buffalo (Sept. 10-12), Chicago (Sept.
13-17, including a day visit to Kenosha, Wisconsin), Minneapolis-
Saint Paul (Sept. 17-21), Lincoln and Omaha, Nebraska (Sept.

`Abdu’l-Bahá’s Visit to North America

22-23), Denver (Sept. 23-26), Glenwood Springs (Sept. 27-28), Salt
Lake City (Sept. 29-Oct. 1), and the San Francisco area (Oct. 2-18).

> In all those places, except Nebraska, Glenwood Springs, and Salt
> Lake City, there were local Bahá'í communities to plan meetings and
> secure speaking invitations at churches and synagogues. The stop in
> Nebraska was prompted because William Jennings Bryan, the for-
> mer Presidential candidate and future Secretary of State, had visited
`Abdu'l-Bahá in Akka and `Abdu'l-Bahá wished to return the gesture;

> Mr. Bryan was traveling, but Mrs. Bryan entertained Him. The
> 22-hour Glenwood Springs visit was necessitated by exhaustion. The
> three-day stop in Salt Lake City is surprising; He did meet a Bahá'í
> travelling from Montana in the city, but had no Bahá'í community to
> visit. He expressed interest in the agriculture fair and perhaps was
> drawn by the spiritual character of the city, but He may also have
> decided not to arrive in California until after the funeral of Thornton
> Chase, so as not to be a distraction from the services for the first
> American Bahá'í.

`Abdu'l-Bahá originally had no intention to travel outside the Bay

> area. The Bahá'ís in Portland and Seattle had hoped He would
> visit their cities and had even publicized speaking invitations, but
> had to satisfy themselves with a train trip to Oakland to visit Him.
> He made an exception to visit the grave of Thornton Chase, in Los
> Angeles (Oct. 18-21).

After four days more in the Bay area, `Abdu'l-Bahá started back east,
visiting Sacramento (Oct. 25-26), Denver (Oct. 29), Chicago (Oct.
31-Nov. 4), Cincinnati (Nov. 5), Washington (Nov. 6-11), Baltimore
(Nov. 11), and Philadelphia (for a few minutes on Nov. 11; thirty
Bahá'ís got on the train for one stop to visit with Him). His last three
and a half weeks in the United States were spent in New York City

Lights of ‘Irfán Book Thirteen

(Nov. 12-Dec. 5). He took few public speaking engagements, but
spoke daily in several Bahá'í homes and in His rented house.

A preliminary review of talks mentioned in Mahmúd’s Diary, Star of
the West, and other sources suggest that He gave approximately 375
talks during His trip (of which 139 were published in The Promulga-
tion of Universal Peace), an average of 1.5 per day. There were some
days when He gave as many as four. Extrapolation from known
attendance figures and some statistical assumptions allow one to
arrive at a rough figure of 93,000 people who attended His talks.2
His audience included high and low alike. In Washington, D.C.,
where the Bahá'ís had excellent contacts with government officials,
and at the Lake Mohonk Peace Conference, which was a fairly small
and exclusive gathering of influential men, He spoke with many of
the influential figures in American society. Particularly notewor-
thy are the talks He gave in thirty-one liberal and moderate white
Protestant churches, fourteen Theosophical and other metaphysical
gatherings, five universities, three synagogues, one African American
church, Hull House, at the Lake Mohonk Peace Conference, and at
the fourth annual NAACP conference.

`Abdu'l-Bahá’s talks can be divided roughly into two types: those to

> the public and those primarily to Bahá'í audiences. The former usu-
> ally started with a reference to a common experience—a comment by
> the previous speaker, a scriptural text that had been just read, an event
> from the daily newspaper, or the weather. From there, a link was often
> made to a related event in the life of Christ, then to a comparison to
> the life of Bahá'u'lláh and finally to the theme `Abdu'l-Bahá sought to
> develop, which He illustrated by stories or anecdotes. Sometimes He
> grounded theological points on rational proofs based on Neoplatonic
> principles, referring to the animal, vegetable, and mineral kingdoms,
> or to essences of things.

`Abdu’l-Bahá’s Visit to North America

A message to the West gradually developed throughout His journey
that emphasized up to eleven principles of the Bahá'í Faith: investiga-
tion of reality, the oneness of humanity, the oneness of religion and
science, the abandonment of prejudices, the adjustment of economic
standards, equality of men and women, universal education, religion
must be a cause of love and unity, establishment of an equal standard
of human rights, a universal language, and the power of the Holy
Spirit. `Abdu'l-Bahá first used this approach to presenting the Faith
to public audiences at meetings in Paris in November 1911.

Some of the eleven are emphasized in Bahá'u'lláh’s writings, like
universal education; others mentioned, like a universal language; yet
others only implied in the texts available in the West at that time , like
equality of the sexes. `Abdu'l-Bahá also chose not to mention some
principles stressed by Bahá'u'lláh, such as the importance of promot-
ing agriculture.3 The list of principles represented a crystallization of
teachings that could already be found in `Abdu'l-Bahá’s writings and
policies (such as encouraging the Iranian Bahá'ís to open schools for
girls and to bring about the advancement of women). The talks, which
were soon published in Persian, provided the Bahá'ís, east and west,
with a new summary of some basic Bahá'í teachings, one particularly
relevant to a modern, westernized audience.

`Abdu'l-Bahá did not talk about principles right away in the United

> States. He first mentioned three principles in a talk at the Parsons
> residence in Washington, D.C., on April 25, expanded to seven
> principles to the Chicago press on April 30 and at the Hotel Schenley
> in Pittsburg on May 7, then spoke of eight principles in His chief
> address at Lake Mohonk on May 15. The order of the points was
> not fixed and the number varied from talk to talk (He gave ten
> principles at the Baptist Temple, Philadelphia, on June 9 and eleven
> at St. James Methodist Church in Montreal on September 5). Many

Lights of ‘Irfán Book Thirteen

of these principles in turn become the sole theme of talks to other
groups, such as Esperantists or women’s clubs. His frequent support
for women’s suffrage often was featured in the headlines of newspaper
articles about Him. In current Bahá'í terms, `Abdu'l-Bahá’s talks
were active engagement in public discourse.

Other groups received specialized talks on other themes: Theosophists
often heard about the oneness of God and progressive revelation; the
poor often heard about the divine rewards awaiting the involuntarily
impoverished poor who had the right attitude toward their lot. His
synagogue talks were controversial. He offered proofs of the divine
origin of the missions of Abraham and Moses, which were then used
to prove that Jesus and Muhammad received authority from the
same source. `Abdu'l-Bahá then called on the Jews to recognize the
prophethood of Jesus and Muhammad. But it would seem that He
was not calling on them to renounce Judaism; rather, He was tak-
ing a position similar to that held by liberal Protestants, Jews, and
Hindus, that religionists should acknowledge and respect each other’s
founders as a basis of dialogue and peace: “Whenever these people
mention each other’s leaders with due reverence then all sufferings
and contentions shall cease, and instead of hatred there will be love
and instead of enmity and disunity there will be harmony and affection.
This is my purpose.”4

A frequent and very important theme in many of His talks was
the need to establish world peace. He proposed no easy solutions
for this achievement, emphasizing the need for true and abiding
love between all humans, striving to free oneself from prejudices
(particularly national and racial), and a deep understanding of the
implications of the oneness of humanity. His emphasis on profound
personal spiritual transformation seems to have been missed by some
of His audience, who sought superficial political and diplomatic solu-
tions and sometimes understood His talks to consist of platitudes.
He often began His discourse on the need for peace by stressing the

`Abdu’l-Bahá’s Visit to North America

horrible bloodshed and destruction being wrought by the Italians in
their unprovoked and unjustified campaign to wrest modern Libya
from the Ottomans. When that war helped to spawn the first Balkan
War—where Serbia, Bulgaria, and Greece, emboldened by Ottoman
weakness in Libya, sought to enlarge their domains at the expense of
the Turks—He condemned the bloodshed there, warned it would
continue, and praised efforts to end the war. At least six times in His
North American travels—in New York City, Milford, PA, Montreal,
Buffalo, Omaha, and Sacramento—He warned that Europe was a
powder keg and a much greater and more destructive war there was
coming. The Balkan War set the conditions for World War One.

Talks to Bahá'ís, on the other hand—especially the last talk to them
in each locality—usually emphasized two things: first, the Covenant
and obedience to `Abdu'l-Bahá as the Center of the Covenant, and
second, teaching the Faith.5 `Abdu'l-Bahá warned against association
with Covenant-breakers, gave examples of communities that were
avoiding them effectively, and noted that communities with endur-
ing connections to them tended to be stagnant. He warned specific
Bahá'ís about their connections with Covenant-breakers and even
temporarily expelled Howard MacNutt from the community for his
failure to understand and obey. He met with the governing bodies of
the Chicago and New York Bahá'ís and had the former reorganized
and reelected. He often mentioned the Universal House of Justice that
would be formed in the future, thus alluding to aspects of His Will
and Testament—already drafted but still not public—and presaging
the development of the Bahá'í Administrative Order. 6

Such talks, clearly, were designed to build a distinct, separate Bahá'í
community, not to encourage those interested in Bahá'u'lláh’s
teachings to remain in their churches and leaven them from
within. `Abdu'l-Bahá laid the cornerstone of the Bahá'í House of
Worship when He visited the Chicago area, an act of great historic
significance that was also designed to build a distinct and separate

Lights of ‘Irfán Book Thirteen

religious community. But `Abdu'l-Bahá did not emphasize distinc-
tive aspects of Bahá'í practice. There are no references to talks where
He discussed fasting or Bahá'í obligatory prayer, even though some
Bahá'ís were already following these practices. He was in North
America for eight of the nine Bahá'í holy days, but generally did not
commemorate them. He did not tell the Bahá'ís that they should
stop consuming alcohol, though a few had already done so. Rather,
He deferred implementation of these aspects of Bahá'í practice to a
future time.

Where teaching the Faith was concerned, He stressed that a Bahá'í
must love humanity, seek to serve others, and develop such a burning
passion for people and service that others would be attracted to the
Cause. The Bahá'í communities themselves had to strengthen their
love and unity to the point where they became magnets for others.
Bahá'ís also should go out to other places to proclaim the teachings.
He had already encouraged regional and international Bahá'í teaching
trips for at least eight years and at least six North American Bahá'ís
had already traveled across Asia to speak about the Faith.7 The
foundation for the Tablets of the Divine Plan had already been laid
before His North American visit, and His talks to the Bahá'ís about
teaching did much to prepare them for the ambitious goals He was
to give them four short years later.

Nearly 200 newspaper articles about His visit are currently available
in the archives in Wilmette. Coverage was almost uniformly positive,
in spite of the critical comments of Christian missionaries and a few
verbal challenges by Covenant-breakers. The positive treatment sur-
prised the Bahá'ís, who feared `Abdu'l-Bahá “would simply be placed
on a level with many traveling ‘Swamis.’” As Thornton Chase, the
first American Bahá'í, noted, “there is evidently a certain strength,
sincerity, righteousness, wisdom, knowledge, and nobility manifest-
ing from him, as an aura of spiritual power, that even our flippant
and calloused news men are restrained by it.”8 This comment also

`Abdu’l-Bahá’s Visit to North America

highlights another characteristic of `Abdu'l-Bahá an aspect feebly
captured by the overused term charisma—which was commented
on in a variety of ways by those who met Him.

Another notable feature of `Abdu'l-Bahá’s visit was His emphasis on
race unity. There are no reports indicating that the Hindu or Buddhist
teachers who had come to America had made efforts to meet African
Americans or attend their events. When in Washington `Abdu'l-Bahá
spoke at Howard University and to the Bethel Literary Society at
Metropolitan A. M. E Church. He charged Agnes Parson, a wealthy
white socialite, with the mission of promulgating race unity. In
Chicago He attended a session of the 4th annual convention of the
NAACP. He arranged to speak at a special gathering of the African
American servants of the wealthy whites vacationing in Dublin, N.H.
In San Francisco He visited an ill African American Bahá’í in his
house. In New York He arranged for a special banquet for African
American Bahá’ís turned away from the official farewell banquet at
the Great Northern Hotel. That evening, white Bahá’ís served their
black co-religionists.

Equality of the races was a frequent theme He underlined when
speaking about the oneness of humankind. His insistence that Louis
Gregory, an African American Bahá’í attorney, be seated at His
right hand at a formal luncheon hosted by the Persian legation and
attended by prominent Washingtonians made a major statement
about inclusion and violated almost every spoken and unspoken rule
about racial separation in that segregated city. His encouragement of
Louis Gregory and Louise Mathews—a British Bahá’í who accom-
panied Him to America—to consider marriage, led to their union on
September 27, 1912, the first interracial marriage in the American
Bahá’í community.9

`Abdu'l-Bahá carried out an exhausting and demanding schedule,

day after day, for many months in spite of the fact that He was 68

years old and suffering from the ill effects of forty years of imprison-
ment and privation. His health in August of 1910 was so bad that
He rested in Egypt an entire year, even though His initial plan was
to follow a one-month sojourn in Port Said with an immediate trip
to Europe (GPB).10 His four-month sojourn in Europe, beginning
in August, 1911, required a second Egyptian rest of three months.
After arriving in the U.S., at times He spoke several times in a single
day in spite of fever. The heat and humidity of summer impaired His
health, which was a reason He went to Dublin, New Hampshire,
for three weeks, and one reason He initially planned to leave North
America for Europe in September. While traveling by train He often
eschewed comfort and slept upright on a passenger seat, though on
the transcontinental trip from San Francisco to Chicago He did
agree to Pullman accommodation every other night.

One approach to assessing the impact of `Abdu'l-Bahá’s visit to
North America and its Bahá'ís is to compare His visit to that of
other “Oriental” religious leaders. He was not the first Asian reli-
gious teacher to come to the United States; that honor is held by
Protap Chunder Mozoomdar (1840-1905), a leader of the Brahmo
Samaj, an important early Hindu nationalist movement. Mozoomdar
visited over sixty Unitarian churches and a few Congregationalist
churches in New England, New York, Washington, D.C., greater
Chicago, and San Francisco, between August 28 and November
24, 1883. Because Mozoomdar emphasized Hindu monotheism
and expressed great love and respect for Christ, he was often called
a Unitarian, though he personally rejected the label. On his second
American trip in 1893, Mozoomdar spoke at the World’s Parliament
of Religions in Chicago, then went to Indianapolis, Buffalo, Boston,
New York City, and Washington, reportedly delivering over two
hundred talks in three months. He returned to the United States
for five weeks in May and June 1900 to visit Unitarian churches and
organizations in Massachusetts and to travel to New York City and
Washington, D.C.11

Contemporaneously, Anagarika Dharmapala (1864-1933) spoke at
the Parliament and went on a three-month tour of the United States,
to which he returned in 1896-97 and at least once subsequently.
Dharmapala’s talks stimulated considerable interest in Buddhism
and one American became a Buddhist, though no specific Buddhist
group resulted.

Better known is Swami Vivekananda (1863-1902) of the Rama
Krishna Mission, who spoke repeatedly at the Parliament and then
crisscrossed the United States for two and a half years, lecturing
on Hinduism, critiquing “Christian civilization,” and criticizing
missionaries for attempting to Christianize India. Vivekananda’s
aggressive speaking style, his eloquent English accented with a slight
brogue, and his impressive education in western philosophy made
him a formidable and controversial speaker, which may explain why
his travels in the United States are remembered by scholars of religion
better than anyone else’s. Vivekananda spoke to opera house audi-
ences, women’s clubs, and Unitarian churches; he was rarely invited
to speak in a mainline Protestant place of worship. Those doors,
however, were open to `Abdu'l-Bahá fifteen years later.

Unlike the other teachers, Vivekananda created a community of
American converts, the Vedanta Society, though the group had only a
hundred or so members when Vivekananda left America, had less than
two hundred members in 1912, and in the early twenty-first century
has grown to 2,500 adherents.12 His group has never approached the
American Bahá'í community in size. The early followers were nearly
all wealthy, educated, European Americans.

All three South Asian religious leaders included fund raising for their
various projects among their pleas. Vivekananda had to pay for his
own traveling expenses; he sold tickets to many of his lectures. In
contrast `Abdu'l-Bahá received a steady stream of financial support
from the Persian Bahá'í community and accepted no such support at

all from Americans before or during His western tour. When Ameri-
can Bahá'ís tried to donate money to Him, he refused it and urged
them to give it to charity.

Mozoomdar, Dharmapala, Vivekanada, and other eastern teachers
such as D. T. Suzuki (the principal founder of Zen Buddhism in the
United States, whose wife, interestingly enough, was an American
Bahá'í)13 had a measurable impact on American culture because they
were the harbingers of ancient and vast religious-cultural traditions;
they were the tip of an iceberg, the rest of which was increasingly
accessible because of colonialism, growing commercial ties with Asia,
military involvement in the region, tourism, and extensive wealth
that could be lavished on the endowing of university chairs and the
subvention of extensive translation efforts. In contrast, in 1912—
and even today—the Bahá'í Faith is a small religious community, a
minority in every land where it is found, with a relatively undeveloped
secondary literature and cultural expressions. As a result, no cultural,
commercial, and political forces were available to continue the
momentum started by `Abdu'l-Bahá’s visit.

> The other Asian teachers attended a pivotal event in American reli-
> gious history: the World’s Parliament of Religions, held in Chicago
> in September, 1893. They helped to make the Parliament a pivotal
> event because their presence on the stage as equals to the Christians
> implied an equality between Christianity and other religions, an idea
> either flatly rejected or beyond the imagination of most American
> Christians of the time. By puncturing stereotypes of “heathen”
> religions—sometimes in dramatic and controversial ways—they
> inaugurated a revolution in thinking that moved Christianity from
“the truth” to “a religion” like the others.

They also helped move a myriad of liberal Protestants toward an
appreciation of and sympathy toward other religions, thereby build-
ing on the insights and enthusiasms of the earlier generations of

Transcendentalists. Thus, for example, the twenty year old Ernest
Hocking—decades later a prominent Harvard philosopher and an
important lay Protestant thinker—attended a talk by Vivekananda at
the World’s Parliament of Religions and came away with the realiza-
tion that secular thinkers like Herbert Spencer did not have the last
word about the biological and psychological origins of religion; rather,
that transcendent religious experience was real, whether experienced
by a Hindu like Vivekananda or a Methodist like himself.14 Hocking
went on to pen a preface to the Bhagavad-Gita and to chair a major
liberal Protestant commission that reexamined the nature and pur-
pose of international Protestant missionary work in the 1930s.

The nearest equivalent to Ernest Hocking, in the Bahá'í context,
was Thomas Kelly Cheyne (1841-1915), a prominent Oxford scholar
of the Old Testament and an advocate of higher biblical criticism,
who met `Abdu'l-Bahá when He visited Britain in 1913, became a
Bahá'í in 1914, and wrote a book, The Reconciliation of Races and
Religions, which was published that year. There is also the example of
Albert Léon Guérard (1880-1959), a professor of French at Stanford
University, who attended `Abdu’l-Bahá’s talk there in October 1912.
Guérard, a French Protestant who became an Episcopalian, was
intrigued and maintained a lifelong interest in Bahá’í ideas about
race unity, world peace, a world government, and an international
language. But the extent to which they influenced his humanist
thinking—he published 28 books—or his active support of interna-
tionalist causes such as the United Nations remains to be explored.15
He himself never indicated to Bahá'ís that Bahá'í ideas had shaped
his thinking significantly.

When `Abdu'l-Bahá visited America in 1912, thought systems such
as the Social Gospel, Progressivism, and liberal Protestantism offered
tentative solutions to the dilemmas raised by Darwinism, higher
biblical criticism, and comparative religion; solutions that were not
to collapse until the end of World War One. Consequently, while

`Abdu'l-Bahá’s talks and information about the Bahá'í principles no

> doubt encouraged and strengthened some thinkers, such as Guérard
> and Cheyne, in their commitment to world peace or racial recon-
> ciliation, His impact outside the Bahá'í community was necessarily
> limited. This is especially true because, two years after His travels
> in America, World War One erupted and forced most intellectuals
> to reconsider their fundamental assumptions. Furthermore, the
> Bahá'í principles of social reform can only be partially implemented
> in a secular context; much of their efficacy depends on a strong and
> numerically significant Bahá'í community, organized within the
> Bahá'í administrative system.

`Abdu'l-Bahá’s visit greatly strengthened and deepened the American

> Bahá'í community, which existed partially because the earlier Asian
> teachers had pushed open the door to conversion to non-Christian
> religions. When He arrived eighteen years after the founding of the
> American Bahá'í community, there were between 1,500 and 3,000
> American Bahá'ís—depending on whether one counts only the more
> active followers or includes the more loosely attracted sympathiz-
> ers—located in dozens of cities. This number may seem small, but
> the 1916 United States religious census counted 86,000 Unitarians,
> 59,000 Universalists, 29,000 Spiritualists, 5,400 Theosophists, 2,900
> Bahá'ís, and 190 Vedantists.16 In terms of attracting Americans of
> European background, the Bahá'í Faith had done much better than
> Hinduism, Buddhism, or Islam. Unlike those attracted to other
> Asian religions, the Bahá'ís tended to be more economically diverse:
> there were significant numbers of middle and working class Bahá'ís
> and even several score African American members. As a result, when
`Abdu'l-Bahá arrived, there already were local Bahá'í communities

> in place with the ability to organize numerous public and private
> meetings—sometimes months in advance—publicize them through
> the newspapers, and attract inquirers from among the rank and file
> of the local population.

> The Bahá'ís in 1912 were not well organized and sometimes uncer-
> tain whether they were a separate religious community or a leaven
> destined to spread Bahá'í teachings within the existing churches.
> This may be one reason why `Abdu'l-Bahá’s visit did not produce
> a great increase in dedicated followers. But it did bring in dozens
> of committed Bahá'ís (notably Robert Abbott, Victoria Bedekian,
> Howard Colby Ives, Ruth Moffett, Harry Randall, and Albert
> Vail) who heard of the Faith during His visit. It transformed some
> persons, such as Howard MacNutt and Agnes Parsons, who had
> to change some of their fundamental attitudes as a result of His
> visit. It strengthened the faith and devotion of some younger Bahá'ís,
> such as Grace Robarts Ober, George Latimer, and Fred Mortensen.
> It solidified the Bahá'í identity of many children of Bahá'ís, who
> often considered 1912 to be the year they accepted Bahá'u'lláh. As
`Abdu'l-Bahá said, “I have planted the Seeds in America. You must

> nurture them and care for them. If you do this, they will yield an abun-
> dant harvest.”17 The direct impact of His visit on the strength of the
> American Bahá’í community was notable for decades.

Ironically, `Abdu’l-Bahá’s visit also sharpened the division within the
American Bahá’í community between those who emphasized close
adherence to the revelation of Bahá’u’lláh and the interpretations
of `Abdu’l-Bahá, and those who saw the Bahá’í Faith as a renewal
of existing metaphysical and mystical teachings. The latter tended
to relativize the Faith’s distinctive teachings and metaphorically
interpret or ignore the teachings they found distasteful or backward.
They seized on comments `Abdu’l-Bahá made in public talks and
to non-Bahá’ís that implied the Bahá’ís should not organize or
form a distinct community. Because they were often epistemological
individualists, they tended to oppose efforts to organize the Bahá’í
community by those who sought to follow `Abdu’l-Bahá’s guidance
closely. The tension resulted in several incidents of Covenant-breaking
before the decade was over and was not ultimately resolved until

Shoghi Effendi began to implement the terms of `Abdu’l-Bahá’s Will
and Testament and build Bahá’í institutions in the 1920s.18

`Abdu'l-Bahá was very pleased by the way Americans received Him:
“In America . . . people are more spiritual, they seek the knowledge

> of God, they hail the truth no matter from what quarter it comes.”19
> Diary entries by His secretary, Mahmúd-i-Zarqání, record His
> sometimes gleeful comments about how audiences responded to His
> talks; His tablets often overflowed with pleasure; and He frequently
> had His Persian secretaries send bundles of newspaper clippings
> to Haifa or Iran so that others could share in His happiness. The
> Persian pages of The Star of the West spread positive reports of His
> trip throughout the Persian-speaking Bahá’í world. The confidence
> and increased self esteem that such reports gave to the Bahá’ís of Iran
> was of great significance.

The Hindu and Buddhist teachers to North America brought about
something similar in their home countries, although the home-
land responses to them can be divided into two types: internal to
their movement and external in their culture. Their travels often
solidified their own importance in their groups and strengthened
the group’s importance in their national cultures. Indian and Sri
Lankan newspapers followed their talks at the World’s Parliament
and their subsequent lecture tours. As a result, Vivekananda went
from a relatively unknown and untested leader of the Sri Ramak-
rishna Mission to the celebrated leader of one of India’s most
important Hindu modernizing groups, conjoining devotion to the
Vedas, ecstatic bhakti worship, and the creation of modern schools
and hospitals. Mozoomdar and Vivekananda became recognized as
fathers of Indian nationalism. Dharmapala became seen as the great
leader in Sri Lankan Buddhism, as one of the most internationally
important Buddhists of his day, and as a key figure in the revival of
Sri Lankan culture and nationalism.

`Abdu’l-Bahá’s visit to North America remained largely unknown to
