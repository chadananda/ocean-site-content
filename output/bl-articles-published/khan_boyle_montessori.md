Research Note

Louise Dixon Boyle and Maria
Montessori
JANET A. KHAN

Louise Dixon Boyle (1875–1953), a member of the Bahá’í community of
Washington, D.C., for fifty-six years, was an intelligent and active woman
whose record of service to the promotion of the Bahá’í teachings and the
betterment of society is rich and varied.1 Conscious of the forces of
social change, the impact of progressive scientific ideas, and the issues
confronting the Western world in the early years of the twentieth centu-
ry, Louise Boyle sought to find ways to bring to the attention of leaders
of thought the teachings of the Bahá’í religion that related to their fields
of interest, and to encourage her co-religionists to familiarize themselves
with current thought and to consider the means by which it might be used
to introduce Bahá’í perspectives on the issues of the day.

While the biography of Louise Boyle has yet to be written, some of her
contributions have already been described in brief, principally in the area
of the advancement of race unity2 and her membership on the executive
board of the Bahá’í Temple Unity (1920–1922), the elected institution
that evolved into the National Spiritual Assembly, the national governing
body of the Bahá’ís in the United States.3 The present research note aims
to highlight another dimension of Boyle’s activity. Piecing together frag-
mentary information, it focuses on Boyle’s involvement in the field of
education, examining, in particular, her interest in the work of the Italian
physician and educator Dr. Maria Montessori (1870–1952).

THE CONTEXT

From its inception at the turn of the twentieth century, the Washington,
D.C., Bahá’í community benefited from the diversity of its membership,
the presence of a number of talented and well-educated individuals and
people of means, whose efforts were reinforced by prominent Bahá’í
teachers from Iran, such as Mírzá Abu’l-Fad.l, who resided in the city from
1902 to 1904.4 The community grew rapidly as a result of personal con-
tacts, public meetings, and the organizational skills of its members.
Increasing personal links between Bahá’ís from the East and the West led
to the formation in 1910 of the Washington-based Persian–American
Educational Society, a Bahá’í-inspired association open to all and designed
to serve all Iranians. Initially, the provision of assistance to the Tarbíyat
School was the priority task of this new society.5

In the course of His travels in North America ‘Abdu’l-Bahá visited
Washington, D.C., in 1912. Receptions were held in His honor “at which
outstanding figures in the social life of the capital were presented to
Him” (Shoghi Effendi 289). ‘Abdu’l-Bahá addressed a number of large
gatherings, including one at Howard University. In these meetings He
expounded, “with brilliant simplicity, with persuasiveness and force”
the “basic and distinguishing principles of His Father’s Faith,” teach-
ings which He characterized as “the ‘spirit of the age’” (Shoghi Effendi
281–82).

Louise Boyle was clearly inspired by ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s visit to the United
States and by the breadth and social relevance of the subjects He dis-
cussed, and by the way He introduced the Bahá’í Faith to the diverse
audiences He addressed. She also had the opportunity to meet with
‘Abdu’l-Bahá on several occasions. No record has been found concerning
the content of the meetings that took place in Washington, D.C., and in
Dublin, New Hampshire.6 However, in a letter dated April 1914
addressed to Mrs. Agnes Parsons, a prominent member of the Washing-
ton Bahá’í community, with whom she collaborated on a number of
Bahá’í activities, Boyle confides in Mrs. Parson that, during a third

meeting, in Philadelphia, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá had given her many instructions
about teaching.7

ENCOURAGEMENT TO ACTION

From the time Louise Boyle accepted the Bahá’í Faith, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá
encouraged her in her efforts to serve the religion she had embraced.
Writing to her in an undated Tablet revealed after her pilgrimage, which
took place in the spring of 1900 (Stockman, Bahá’í Faith 2:158–59),
‘Abdu’l-Bahá states: “Wert thou informed of that which God hath
ordained unto His maid-servants in this blessed, holy and primal life, in
this Wonderful Age, thine heart would fly with joy and gladness.”8
‘Abdu’l-Bahá calls upon her to appreciate the great privilege she had in
visiting the Resting-place of the Founder of the Bahá’í Faith. He exhorts
her to return to her native country, bearing the glad-tidings of the
Kingdom of God, and to rejoice in “the numberless favors of God.”9

From letters written by Louise Boyle to various members of the
Washington, D.C., Bahá’í community, it is evident that Boyle was deeply
interested in social issues and in the progressive ideas that were current
in society. She had a particular interest in finding ways of relating mod-
ern scientific concepts to the teachings of the Faith, and in fostering inno-
vation in the ways the Bahá’í religion and its conception of the
Manifestation of God were presented to leaders of thought.

Typically, she communicated her ideas to a number of receptive individ-
uals in the community. From time to time, she also wrote articles that
were published in Bahá’í and non-Bahá’í journals. These articles illustrate
Boyle’s deep personal interest in current scientific thought and social
issues and their importance to the contemporary age. They indicate the
scope of her reading and the range of sources she consulted. Her articles
demonstrate Boyle’s desire to explore the correlation of such social and
scientific issues with aspects of the Bahá’í teachings and her conviction
that such a correlation would provide the means for presenting the Bahá’í
Faith in a logical and systematic manner to leaders of thought.

Initially unsure of her approach, on occasion, Boyle submitted her ideas
in writing to ‘Abdu’l-Bahá. In one instance, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá read her notes,
made a number of additions to the text, then returned the notes to Boyle,
at the same time addressing to her a Tablet dated 1 April 1913, which con-
veyed His response. The Tablet reads:

The article which thou hast written is very eloquent. It is an indi-
> cation that through the Bestowal of His Holiness Bahá’u’lláh the
> power of composition is being developed in thee; thy pen is moving
and thy tongue is speaking. . . .

I have commanded to print and publish this article in the Star of the
West so that all the believers in the East and the West may read it.10

The article entitled “Meeting the Capacity of the Seeker” subsequently
appeared in the issue of Star of the West dated 17 May 1913. In the pre-
amble Boyle states: “In giving the world this knowledge of the Day of
God, no duty impresses itself so persistently upon the Bahá’í as the neces-
sity to meet the capacity of the seeker, and to realize among human beings
a marked dissimilarity in approaching the teachings” (70). The main body
of Boyle’s article deals with the challenge and importance of understand-
ing the vital role of the Manifestation in providing timely guidance to the
world of humanity, a function she describes as “The perfect meeting of the
demand with the supply, the need with its fulfillment, . . . one of the funda-
mental laws of God” (70). She contrasts the extent and nature of human-
ity’s understanding of the guidance of God with “those holy ones [who]
possess in its fullness in this day that “universal divine mind” whose power
is “conscious, not acquired” (70–71). Finally, Boyle draws attention to the
wise and judicious manner in which ‘Abdu’l-Bahá presented the teachings
of the Faith during His public addresses, and she encourages her fellow
believers to follow His example in order “to protect the Cause” (71).

Boyle’s interest in progressive issues is further reflected in her active
membership in the Twentieth Century Club, a woman’s organization con-
cerned with social welfare and the promotion of science, literature, and
art, and in which the members were encouraged to present speeches.

Boyle sought the guidance of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá about the desirability of her
participating in this organization, and, in a Tablet translated in July 1913,
she received His clear endorsement to proceed:

O thou daughter of the Kingdom! I have told thee before and now
> I repeat again: In meetings and assemblages turn thy face toward the
> Kingdom of Abhá, then loosen thy tongue and speak with utmost
> confidence and zeal. Rest thou assured in the confirmations of the
> Kingdom of Abhá; especially in the matter of the Twentieth Century
> Club the President of which has asked thee to become an active mem-
> ber. Before entering the meetings read thou a commune, beg for assis-
> tance, then deliver the address.11

Furthermore, writing in 1913 to Mrs. Charlotte Dixon, Boyle’s mother,
‘Abdu’l-Bahá expressed pleasure at her daughter’s activities. In the Tablet
‘Abdu’l-Bahá asked Mrs. Dixon to convey His greetings to Boyle and He
comments on her potential to render service to the Cause: “Convey my
respectful greetings to thy revered daughter—Mrs. Louise Boyle. She is
endowed with great capacity—encourage her to deliver speeches in the
meetings with infinite attraction and be occupied in teaching the Cause. If
she practiceth this she will make extraordinary progress.”12

MODERN EDUCATION AND THE MONTESSORI PHENOMENON

The social, economic, and political changes occurring in the world at the
end of the nineteenth century created the need for schools to broaden
their aims and curricula. In addition to the promotion of literacy, mental
discipline, and good moral character, schools were expected to help pre-
pare children for citizenship, for employment, and for individual develop-
ment and success. The development of education in the twentieth centu-
ry saw the crystallization of three foci of study—the child, science, and
society. These central themes, which underpinned the progressive educa-
tional movement, were derived both from European educators and theo-
rists, including Rousseau, Pestalozzi, Froebel, and Montessori, and from

66            The Journal of Bahá’í Studies 16. 1/4. 2006

Americans such as John Dewey, Henry James, and others. In addition to
proposing a child-centered approach to education, such theorists placed
new emphasis on providing a scientific basis for education, resulting in
more systematic methodology, and the establishment of a number of
experimental schools. The social impact of schooling was widely studied,
driven by the belief that schools could be a vehicle for influencing society
or the individual.13

Dr. Maria Montessori, an Italian educator and physician of the early
twentieth century, was an active proponent of educational reform. She
won international recognition for designing an educational system to aid
children in the development of intelligence and independence.14 Her first
book, published in Italian in 1910, was translated into English as The
Montessori Method and appeared in 1912. The book served to make her
ideas accessible to the English-speaking world, led to the spread of her
methods, and, before long, gave rise to the establishment of Montessori
schools.

Montessori’s teaching strategies and her discoveries about the process
of learning impacted the field of education in the United States. The
school she set up in a Roman slum in 1907 achieved remarkable results
and within a couple of years had attracted the attention of both profes-
sional educators and the general public.15 The release of her book in
North America was eagerly awaited due in part to the widespread inter-
est generated by what a contemporary observed described as “the enthu-
siastic and ingenious articles in McClure’s Magazine for May and
December 1911, and January 1912” (Holmes xvii). An eminent Harvard
professor, Henry W. Holmes, contributed a long and detailed “critical
introduction” to the English translation of Montessori’s book, in the
beginning pages of which he highlights some of the unique features of
the approach:

It is wholly within the bounds of safe judgment to call Dr.

> Montessori’s work remarkable, novel, and important. It is remarkable,
> if for no other reason, because it represents the constructive effort of
a woman. We have no other example of an educational system—

Louise Dixon Boyle and Maria Montessori                      67

> original at least in its systematic wholeness and in its practical appli-
> cation—worked out and inaugurated by the feminine mind and hand.
> It is remarkable, also, because it springs from a combination of wom-
> anly sympathy and intuition, broad social outlook, scientific training,
> intensive and long-continued study of educational problems, and, to
> crown all, varied and unusual experience as a teacher and educational
> leader. . . . These resources, furthermore, she has devoted to her work
> with an enthusiasm, an absolute abandon, like that of Pestalozzi and
> Froebel, and she presents her convictions with an apostolic ardour
> which commands attention. A system which embodies such a capital of
> human effort could not be unimportant. Then, too, certain aspects of
> the system are in themselves striking and significant: it adapts to the
> education of normal children methods and apparatus originally used
> for deficients; it is based on a radical conception of liberty for the
> pupil; it entails a highly formal training of separate sensory, motor,
> and mental capacities, and it leads to rapid, easy, and substantial mas-
> tery of the elements of reading, writing, and arithmetic. All this will
> be apparent to the most casual reader of this book. (xvii–xviii)

Dr. Maria Montessori made her first visit to the United States in 1913

and a second in 1915. She spoke to a variety of audiences about her ideas
and teaching methods, including a memorable speech before an estimated
five thousand people in Carnegie Hall in 1915 (Hacker 26). Later that year
Montessori attracted worldwide attention and publicity when she demon-
strated her approach in a special “schoolhouse” made of glass at the
Panama-Pacific International Exhibition in San Francisco. The committee
that brought her to San Francisco included Margaret Wilson, the daugh-
ter of United States President Woodrow Wilson. During her second visit
Montessori also conducted a teacher-training course and addressed the
annual conventions of both the National Educational Association and the
International Kindergarten Union. This may well have represented the
high point of the interest in the Montessori Method in North America.
Subsequently, her work came in for increasing criticism from educators,
and, for a time, interest in her approach waned. Nevertheless, her legacy

68            The Journal of Bahá’í Studies 16. 1/4. 2006

appears to have been assured through the resurgence of interest in her
ideas in the 1960s (American Montessori Society; Montessori Foundation).

LOUISE BOYLE AND THE MONTESSORI MOVEMENT

Louise Boyle was actively involved in the pioneering initiatives to pro-
mote the Montessori approach to education in the Washington, D.C.,
area. Boyle was in close contact with the small group of individuals who
gave leadership to this venture, including Alexander Graham Bell and
Mabel Hubbard Bell, Miss Margaret Wilson, and the Montessori-trained
teachers who worked with the Bells and in a demonstration Free School.
She was a member of the Montessori Educational Association, estab-
lished in 1913 under the auspices of the Bells, and assumed a degree of
administrative responsibility for the organization of its activities. And, it
was to Louise Boyle that Dr. Montessori turned in 1914 for assistance in
making some of the arrangements for her second visit to Washington.
Boyle’s keen interest in educational innovation is also reflected in the
articles she wrote about education and the contribution of the
Montessori approach. The contents of several of Boyle’s articles will be
briefly outlined in a later section of this paper.

THE LETTERS OF LOUISE BOYLE CONCERNING THE MONTESSORI
MOVEMENT

In her letters addressed to Mrs. Agnes Parsons, a trusted friend and fel-
low member of the Washington Bahá’í community, Boyle provides inter-
esting insights into the nature of her association with the Montessori
Movement. The content of several of these letters, from the Agnes
Parsons Papers, is outlined below.

5 March 1914. Writing to Mrs. Parsons on this date, Boyle explains her
desire to find a way to present the Bahá’í teachings to thinking people, such
as Mrs. Bell and colleagues involved in the Montessori Movement. She
states: “The practical application is that I cannot give the teachings to my

Louise Dixon Boyle and Maria Montessori                     69

co-workers out in the world,—of the New Pedagogy, for example,—until
I can give it in a language intelligible to them” (5). Boyle illustrates her
concern by recounting a recent conversation she had with Laura Dreyfus-
Barney, a Bahá’í visiting from Europe, about her goal of being able to con-
vey the Bahá’í conception of the Manifestation of God in “rational or sci-
entific” terms. She describes for Dreyfus-Barney the work of an early
nineteenth-century Belgian statistician named Quetelet, who defined the
notion of the “medial” type of human being, one who exemplifies univer-
sal qualities, both intellectual and moral.16 Boyle apparently saw the pos-
sibility that this idea of the “medial” type might serve as a useful analogy
for the Manifestation of God. By conceptualizing the Manifestation as, for
example, the “Medial Moral Genius of a New Age,” Boyle believes it
might be possible to foster understanding of the dynamic relationship
between the Divine and humankind and the role of the Prophet as a stim-
ulus to human progress.

1 April 1914. In this long and detailed letter addressed to Mrs. Parsons,
Boyle elaborates on some of the themes set out in her earlier correspon-
dence. She indicates that she is “completely absorbed in the necessity to
give the Message to broad and liberal-minded people who are waiting for
us to teach them” (1), and, in relation to her work with the Montessori
Movement, she again takes up the subject of “the scientific treatment of
the Manifestations” (5). She writes:

> I have been guided step by step in the Montessori work and through
> my intense appreciation of the spirit of it, which the Master17 long
> since approved and understood, have really studied and written a lit-
> tle on the subject.18 A review of mine of her best work Pedagogical
> Anthropology will appear sometime in the Yale Review. Other maga-
> zines are waiting for copy I cannot seem to find time to send; there is
> great demand. It is truly Bahá’í work, but I am feeling my way. (5)

Boyle encourages Mrs. Parsons to read Montessori’s Pedagogical
Anthropology, or at least her review of it. She notes that while Montessori

70            The Journal of Bahá’í Studies 16. 1/4. 2006

refers to the “Medial Man,” “the merest suggestion of the Medial Moral
Man” is to be found in her book. In an attempt to gain a clear understand-
ing of “the brief allusions,” Boyle carefully studied Quetelet’s book, A
Treatise on Man and the Development of His Faculties, and reports: “It was
helpful to me as confirming, even in the phraseology, my own conceptions
about the Manifestations” (5–6). Nevertheless, Boyle provides the follow-
ing assurance to Mrs. Parsons: “Do not get the idea that we can, as Bahá’ís,
turn to any definite scientific books and use them literally, or readily for
any purpose in Bahá’í teaching“ (6). She informs Mrs. Parsons that in
teaching the Faith she would like to use “the lesser focal types as exam-
ples,” referred to by Quetelet, and to explain “the law by analogy,” though
not in a dogmatic way (6). She writes:

> To me this LAW of GOD—the way it happens that a supreme focal
> human type becomes the divine instrument once in ages—is as much
> our Bahá’í Message as the fact that such a spiritual phenomenon has
> occurred and is in our midst. And this aspect of the message, this
> rational reference merely—(I should not dwell upon it nor create a
> dogma of it, or expect every soul to be interested to be so taught)—
> seems to me our weapon for the scientific, logical mind. (7)

Bringing the focus back to her contact with the Montessori Movement,
Boyle tells Mrs. Parsons that she is not currently using this new method
of presenting the Bahá’í Message to any of her friends, since she is con-
cerned that some members of the Bahá’í community might misconstrue it
as “unwarranted interpretation” (10). She justifies her decision on the
grounds that that when her “dear friends,” Miss George, the director of
the Children’s House (the Montessori School), and translator of
Montessori’s book, The Montessori Method, and Miss Fletcher, her first
assistant, attended a Bahá’í meeting, “they were not impressed” (7) by the
presentation of the teachings. For the present, then, she is concentrating
on the professional aspects of her contact with her colleagues. She writes:
“I am engaged in this other work with them and they do not yet know the
Bahá’í caliber fully enough to thrust the Message upon them” (7).

Nevertheless, she envisages that “the time will come when you [Mrs.
Parsons] will be instrumental in giving these people the message, and that
I must be ready to help you in at least a small degree” (7–8).

13 June 1914. In this letter Boyle sets out for Mrs. Parsons her thoughts
about the Montessori work and the potential significance of this activity
for promoting the interests of the Bahá’í Faith. To this end, she encloses
a copy of her article entitled “Scientific Pedagogy and Maria Montessori”
(discussed below), in the hope that Mrs. Parsons might “gain an idea, at
least, of what this all means to the Bahá’í Revelation.” And she expresses
the wish that Mrs. Parsons might “find the leisure sometime in which to
come into direct touch with the spirit of this woman-educator and scien-
tist,” in order to “better understand how wonderful an instrument she is
in this age” (1).

Boyle describes “the practical condition here in Washington among the
progressive educators.” She recounts how Mrs. Bell recruited Miss
George for a trial period after seeing her experimental school in Tarry-
town, and she explains what transpired next:

> After that experimental season at the Bell’s we were all called together
> to decide whether or not we should have a permanent and larger
> school, and it happened (as I have since recalled) that it was a Bahá’í
> who first offered to guarantee a sum of money, to which others added,
> to stand by Mrs. Bell on this project. . . . Well, Miss George and her
> assistant, Miss Fletcher, were placed in charge of the pay-school and
> it has been very successful this past year. Miss George has been train-
> ing there about eight other young women who have assisted her in
> the work. (1)

Boyle then describes the nature of her personal involvement with the
Montessori activities. She writes:

From the first I have been mainly interested in the movement as it
applied to social service and I have served on the Friendship House
72            The Journal of Bahá’í Studies 16. 1/4. 2006

> Committee, the small group of women who have directly managed the
> free school at this settlement. Last summer Miss George went to Rome
> to confer with Dr. Montessori and it was arranged that the National
> Association should be formed. . . . The pay schools all over America
> came under the auspices and inspiration of the Association. . . ; but its
> free schools are its “demonstration work” and its means of allaying [sic]
the new principles to social service.

Most of the members of the association are interested in some pay-
> school in one or other city and in the discussion of the method for
> their own children; there are very few Montessorians who see the
> bigness of this work at all. And I am having to go outside the active
> workers in the association and am now trying to bring into it such
> minds as will enhance its strength and really make it a vital, intelli-
> gently active organization. (1–2)

Though appreciative of the efforts of her co-workers in the field of
education, for example, Dr. Alexander Graham Bell’s willingness to
stand as the head of the association to enhance its credibility, and the sac-
rificial services of the teachers, Boyle nevertheless expresses frustration
at what she regards as their lack of vision, which she attributes to the fact
that “they have not had the Bahá’í training” and to their apparent inabil-
ity to see the “deep relation” between the Montessori Movement and “the
new age” (2).

Boyle returns to the subject of the Medial Man, describing conversa-
tions she had in Philadelphia with academics and educators, who appar-
ently were either not familiar with the concept, or considered it a mere
detail. She, then, explains more fully her views to Mrs. Parsons:

You see, what has actually happened in this—Eighty years ago,
> when Quetelet conceived of this scientific explanation of genius and
> the medial type, Bahá’u’lláh was a young man; the new age was on
> and its vibrations permeating everywhere. This Frenchman [sic],
> ahead of his time, caught them and gave his message; but there had
to come in other more practical knowledge of the laws of evolution,

> which are invaluable to our present unifying of religion and sci-
> ence,—and after those laws are fully established in the world, Quetelet
> is revived, and today you and I stand in possession of a scientific expo-
> sition of the Medial Human Type. We have a phraseology to use in
> giving the message to logical thinkers, as you see. And, it was a woman
who gave this message to the English-speaking nations. . . .

Of course we must get the Message to Montessori; but it is all so
> vast a theme and she does not speak English! I am not engaged in per-
> sonalities in the matter anyway; but in the significance to our work of
> this rational explanation of the Manifestations. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá has told
> us to unify all our work with scientific discovery, and you may imag-
> ine my emotions when I came upon this in a matter into which I had
> been led like a child by the hand, fearing all the while I might be giv-
> ing too much time to something not strictly Bahá’í. (3–4)

Boyle sees the theoretical formulations of people such as Quetelet,
Emerson, Schopenhauer, and others as providing bridges of understand-
ing, “as bringing down to our human level the lofty utterances of the
Focal Types themselves!” (4–5). She underlines their intuitive understand-
ing of the Bahá’í Message and speculates about what might happen if this
understanding were to become conscious. She writes:

. . . this new school of scientists, represented by Lodge in England
> and Bergson in France, who are taking practical methods over into
> the realm of the ideal, are the New Psychologists; to them spirit is
> reality. Of course the materialists will fight them; but the joy is that
> they are expressing the age and are bound to persist. Montessori and
> these men already have the Bahá’í Message and are giving it force-
> fully on the plane of reality, and what I am impatient to do is to ask
> them to contemplate the actual phenomenon they are describing to
> see what more they might say! (5)

Boyle brings her discussion of these themes to an end by confiding in
Mrs. Parsons that she has been “struggling with these things for years”

74            The Journal of Bahá’í Studies 16. 1/4. 2006

(6). She is conscious of the need to proceed with caution. In this regard,
she mentions her paper entitled, “Scientific Pedagogy and Maria
Montessori,” stating: “I could only sketch the ‘Oneness of the world of
humanity’ and intimate the medial man . . .; but can you not see ahead to
a possible time when we may print facts if we approach them in such a
spirit, of analysis and logical argument?” (5). Finally, she expresses opti-
mism in the value of engaging in “such fundamental social service as will
worthily proclaim the Bahá’í spirit” (6).

17 June 1914. In a postscript dated 17 June 1914 attached to Boyle’s let-
ter of 13 June 1914 addressed to Mrs. Parsons, Boyle apologizes for the
delay in mailing the earlier letter. It seems that Boyle had loaned the only
additional copy of her paper to one of her Montessori colleagues, Mrs.
Hitz, a prominent Washington matron, who had shared it with one of her
friends, “Miss Margaret Wilson, who took it home to her father and asked
to keep it” (1). In describing her article and the response to it, Boyle
writes:

> My first formal review of the book appears in the July Yale Review
> and although I refer to this later article as a “review” it is so much
> fuller and more comprehensive. . . . Miss Margaret was thrilled by the
> concept of the Medial Man and Quetelet’s theory of genius, and Mrs.
> Hitz, who has quite a mind, feels that the Wilsons will eventually be
> a power in the broad aspect of the Montessori work, and perhaps in
> giving the Revelation in its best way. Miss Margaret is on our execu-
> tive board and has been impressed intuitively heretofore. . . . (1)

Promising to make a copy of the article for Mrs. Parsons, Boyle express-
es the hope that Parsons would see how she had attempted to dovetail her
paper with the Bahá’í teachings, and that she would appreciate “how by
training people in the Law of the lesser focal types we prepare them for
the Universal Revelator” (1).

Boyle concludes by mentioning she was invited to present a speech on
the Montessori message in Philadelphia at a large formal dinner at the

Walton Hotel, during the first annual meeting of the Organic Education
Society. She shares the following general observation about Montessori
lecturers:

> The Montessori lecturers, all I have heard, merely give the princi-
> ples and the method; they do not get into the background of this
> whole matter, which is its relation to social service. You see it is the
> Bahá’í training which enables one to grasp this and give it thus
> early. All will see it in time. I could not but feel that my work was
> real Bahá’í work. . . . (2)

Circa 8 October 1914. Addressing Mrs. Parsons as “My dear spiritual
Mother,” Boyle describes a request for assistance she received from Dr.
Maria Montessori and the efforts she exerted on behalf of the supporters
of Montessori in Washington, to make the necessary arrangements for
Montessori’s visit to the recently established American University in that
city.19 It would appear that Dr. Montessori was keen to demonstrate her
Method in an academic setting, and the new university, which had a pub-
lic service orientation and greater flexibility, might be receptive to her
approach. Boyle saw the potential value of Montessori’s visit for advanc-
ing the cause of progressive education and she hoped that indirectly it
might also contribute to the promotion of the Bahá’í Faith. Prior to tak-
ing on the task, Boyle sought the guidance of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá. Her letter to
Mrs. Parsons captures her excitement, the challenges involved in endeav-
oring to make the necessary arrangements, and suggests a high level of
support for Montessori’s visit.20 Boyle writes:

> Dr. Montessori cabled asking me to make her arrangements with the
> new American University opening in Washington this fall. Of course,
> everything personal had to be dropped! I wrote the Beloved ‘Abdu’l-
> Bahá asking Him to do this work, to sustain and bless it; that
> Montessori, in coming to America, might prove an instrument of

Louise Boyle’s request for guidance from ‘Abdu’l-Bahá about
Montessori’s projected visit to Washington was honored with a response.
A copy of a Tablet dated 31 October 1914 addressed to Boyle has been
located.22 A provisional translation of the Tablet reads as follows:

Thy letter hath been received. Thou hast written that Dr.

> Montessori is coming to the U.S. to promote the system which she
> hath devised for the education of children. Every concept needeth to
> be supported by a force. Today the penetrating power in the world of
> existence is confirmation from the Abhá Kingdom. Any system that
> is confirmed by that [power] is definitely effective in the realm of
existence and will be realized.

Also, the human world will not turn into a celestial paradise by the
> promotion of one thing. The education of children is but one matter.
> Any useful matter which is the cause of advancement of the world of
> humanity is like one element. A single element cannot confer life. But
> once the elements come together, creation taketh place. Thus,
> Bahá’u’lláh’s Cause and His heavenly Teachings bring together all the
> perfections which include the education of children; unity of
> humankind; harmony between religion, science, and reason; equality
> among all human beings; the breathings of the Holy Spirit; oneness
of women and men; elimination of religious prejudices; heavenly

> manners; fragrances of the Merciful; universal peace. Thus the Cause
of Bahá’u’lláh combineth all the perfections.

Those who desire the advancement of the world of humanity in
> every respect must turn to the Abhá Kingdom that the divine power
> may assist and the pervasive power of the Word of God may turn the
> nether world into the mirror of the celestial realm. Therefore, thou
> shouldst exert thine utmost to revive Dr. Montessori with the divine
> spirit and so implant the Teachings of Bahá’u’lláh in her heart that it
> may become a clear mirror reflecting the rays of the sun of truth,
> enabling her to carry out this system of educating the children. If this
> happeneth, be assured that the Holy Spirit will assist and reinforce her
> from the realm beyond and, as it is her highest wish, her system will be
> materialized in the world of existence. Convey to her my greetings and
> tell her: “O doctor! Let thy aim be exalted and thy goal lofty that thou
> mayest be the cause of spiritual and material progress in the human
> world. This is My advice. Shouldst thou arise to carry it out, thou wilt
immediately feel a new spirit and a new power within thyself.”

Upon thee and upon her be the Abhá glory.

It is interesting to note, that, as of August 1919, Boyle apparently had
not received the Tablet ‘Abdu’l-Bahá revealed for her in 1914, though it is
evident that she had become aware of its existence. Writing to Mr. Joseph
Hannen, a leading member of the Washington Bahá’í community, on 14
August 1919, Boyle states: “Ahmad [Sohrab] tells me that a Tablet was
revealed for me in about October 1914 on the subject of education, in
reply to a letter of mine in regard to my work.23 It was found impossible
to send this Tablet because of the war and Ahmad embodied it in the
Diary of those days.”24 She requests Mr. Hannen’s assistance in locating
a copy of the Tablet, which she believes to be pertinent to her current
activities in the field of education. There does, however, remain a degree
of uncertainty as to whether Louise Boyle ever received the Tablet.

Thursday. In a letter dated simply “Thursday,” Boyle inquires which
group of children at a Montessori school Mrs. Parson would like to visit,

78            The Journal of Bahá’í Studies 16. 1/4. 2006

a class in Miss George’s school or one at the Friendship Settlement. Boyle
informs Mrs. Parsons that the school financed by Mrs. Bell closely resem-
bles the Montessori model of a “Children’s House.” However, it is her
view that the striking results obtained with the children “from the very
humblest parentage” at the Friendship Settlement are more impressive,
and are, therefore, of greater interest.

13 February 1917. The next reference to Dr. Montessori appears in a let-
ter addressed to Mrs. Parsons in February 1917. Boyle begins by express-
ing her delight that Mrs. Parsons is arranging meetings at which the
Bahá’í teachings are being presented in an appropriate way to people of
capacity. She then comments as follows about Montessori and her knowl-
edge about the Bahá’í Faith:

Dr. M is receiving the teachings just as fast as I feel, according to
> my humble guidance, it is best she should from me, and she seems
> most sympathetic and receptive. Knowing how trying and full her life
> is, and just how she stands in many relationships I do not give her
> much. She says she is going to have the stone set and wear it, and that
> she “loves” the calendar; but as you know, we must be most careful not
> to speak of these things. . . . (2)

Boyle is evidently concerned about presenting the teachings of the
Faith in the right way to Montessori. She reflects on the state of the
world, the politically troubled times, the days of crises and war, and how
the turmoil and suffering caused by such events, operating at a subcon-
scious level, often acts as a stimulus to great artists and thinkers. She takes
as an example Montessori, stating she “must have been and is such a
reflector, while knowing nothing of the teachings” (3). Boyle believes his-
tory will ultimately disclose the source of Montessori’s innovative ideas;
she is convinced such ideas do not just come from nowhere. She makes the
following observation about Dr. Montessori’s sensitivity to the spiritual
forces of the age: “. . . now that she has read some of our literature, she is
lecturing on “Peace” and repeating some of her most sublime ideas. Many

would say she got them all from the London Talks [of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá]; but
she really uttered them nearly twenty years ago in the University of
Rome. Her lectures are published, but few have read them“ (3–4).

As World War I dragged on, Maria Montessori decided to return to
Europe. The absence of additional archival correspondence between
Louise Boyle and others would suggest that Boyle’s involvement with the
Montessori Movement was overtaken by other interests and priorities.

LOUISE BOYLE’S ARTICLES

In the preceding sections mention has been made of a number of articles
written by Louise D. Boyle concerning the ideas of Dr. Maria Montessori.
To date, three such papers have been located. The contents of these articles
are reviewed in brief below. The articles are significant not only because
they illustrate Boyle’s tentative, yet creative, efforts to correlate
Montessori’s ideas with some of the teachings of the Bahá’í Faith, but
they also demonstrate her attempts to vindicate the unique contribution of
the Montessori approach to education. By embedding her presentation of
Montessori’s work into the European scientific and intellectual tradition,
Boyle attempted to counteract one of the prevalent criticisms leveled at
Montessori, namely that she offered simply a “Method.”

“Scientific Pedagogy and Maria Montessori” (T     T h e Y a l e R e v i e w, June
1914). In this article, Boyle calls attention to the recent emergence in
America and Europe of “Scientific Pedagogy”—the establishment of new
departments of study in American universities, including clinical psychol-
ogy, industrial arts, and vocational guidance, and the introduction of sci-
entific methods, such as “the use of psychometry and anthropometry”
within these departments (1). She writes, “. . . pedagogy is to be elevated
to the rank of a definite science and is to become, like other sciences, a
field of practical research” (2).

She traces the contributions of the “progressive thinkers” who have
contributed to the “new science of Man,” describing the application of
anthropology to fields such as pedagogy (for example, by Giuseppe Sergi

80            The Journal of Bahá’í Studies 16. 1/4. 2006

and Maria Montessori), medicine, and criminology (by De Giovanni,
Morel, and Lombroso). Boyle attributes to Montessori a movement away
from the focus of attention on the pathological to the study of “the con-
cept of the perfect norm, or medial human type,” a concept derived from
the “Theory of the Medial Man first propounded by Quetelet in 1835 and
revived by Prof. Giancinto [sic] Viola under the guidance of present-day
biometry” (4–5). According to Boyle, based on “the analogy of the medi-
al morphological man,” Quetelet derived his concepts of “a Medial
Intellectual and a Medial Moral Man,” and she mentions that in his clas-
sical work Social Physics or the Development of the Faculties of Man (trans-
lated into English in 1842), he propounds an interesting theory regarding
genius. She writes:

The medial intellectual man should be to his nation and century
> “what the centre of gravity is to the body”: he should centralize and
> keep in equilibrium the movement of thought of his epoch, giving it
> expression in works of art or science. While there has never existed
> a man of such intellectual power as to sum up all the thought of his
> time, . . . the man of genius is he who does express a large part of the
> ideas of his epoch, and it is precisely this power of synthesis which
> constitutes the inborn quality of genius. . . . (6–7)

Continuing the analogy: the medial moral or religious genius
> “interprets the universal and eternal spirit of life in humanity”; aid-
> ing its upward progress by appealing to the best in each. When he
> speaks to mankind of the guiding ethical principles of life which each
> feels profoundly in the depths of his own heart, new spiritual vigor is
> instilled, and he is believed when he teaches of a happier future
> toward which humanity is advancing. (8)

Boyle provides two detailed examples of the manner in which
Montessori’s work is promoting “the practical realization of the medial
man,” namely, “the intermingling of the races and social reforms estab-
lishing ‘the brotherhood of man,’” both of which Boyle believes represent

the spirit of the age. In concluding the paper Boyle places the theoretical
concepts she has been discussing within a broader spiritual context and
she underlines the uniqueness of Maria Montessori’s work:

The synthetic concept of the individual is the basis of all the great
> religions of the world, and it is this which gives the new pedagogy
> its peculiar vitality,—the blending of the practical with the ethical,
> the positive with the ideal. Montessori is the distinct product of a
> new age which has unified religion and science. She stands for the
> accuracy of intuition operating through trained intelligence. All
> great educators have been mystics, but so long as the realm of the
> ideal remained unexplored by practical research every spiritual con-
> cept savored quickly of the sentimental or became confused with
> dogma. (11)

The Montessori Message to the Annual Convention of the National
Education Association, St. Paul, Minnesota, 1914. Prepared for the
National Convention of the National Education Association, Boyle’s paper
bears the subtitle “True Education, the Basis of a New Civilization.” The
opening paragraph reads as follows:

To understand Maria Montessori as the originator of a method is
> to miss entirely the order of her genius. It is only through recourse
> to an enlightening literature, much of which has not yet been trans-
> lated into English, and through careful study of the modern pro-
> gressive educational movement as it assumes the dignity of a New
> Science of Man—Modern Anthropology—that one can trace clear-
> ly the relation of Montessori to our rapidly developing age. She is
> the product and sufficient exponent of this movement which, in its
> broadest interpretation, embraces the development of an ideal civi-
> lization. She has clearly defined and demonstrated those modern
> educational principles and ideals which, before her definition and
> demonstration, were felt but dimly and were but partially and inad-
> equately expressed. (1)
82            The Journal of Bahá’í Studies 16. 1/4. 2006

In order to provide an appropriate context for understanding “the spirit
of this woman-educator in its true setting,” and to demonstrate that her
approach is soundly based in principles as well as in methodology, Boyle
describes the European roots, both social and intellectual, from which
Montessori’s work emerged. Boyle views Montessori’s volume entitled
Pedagogical Anthropology as the fruition of this scientific process, and she
characterizes her as “the true prophet of the New Pedagogy” (4–5).

In the remainder of the paper, Boyle quotes from the speeches of
Montessori, including her comments about the need for education to be
scientifically based and to uphold moral standards, and her message to
teachers on the freedom of the child.25 She also tentatively correlates
some of Montessori’s ideas with concepts found in the Bahá’í Faith. Thus:

Montessori believes that the intensive scientific activity of the past
> has prepared the world to solve the problem of a universal morality;
> and that if it is not yet within our power to achieve a social reform
> based upon the complete eradication of degeneration and disease—
> since society can only be purified by degree—it is nevertheless clear-
> ly within our power to prepare the way by incorporating the princi-
ples of the new social ethics in our schools.

Today the man of honour and of power is not he who works for
> himself but for humanity. “Let not a man glory in this that he loves
> his country; let him rather glory in this that he loves his kind” is the
ethical code of the Twentieth Century. . . .

To prepare the conscience for such a “triumph of the free and
> peaceful development of life,” after the long series of struggles in its
> mere defenses, Montessori conceives as constituting “the very
> essence of the New Pedagogy”; and she believes the evolution of
> modern thought and of our social environment is rapidly promoting
> its advent. (8–9)

“Education in the New Age” (S     S t a r o f t h e W e s t). This paper is more
readily accessible to the general reader and serves as an example of
Boyle’s writing style. It illustrates her capacity for logical analysis, the

manner in which she cites scientific evidence, including the contribution
of Montessori to education, and the way in which she relates her theme
to contemporary social issues and endeavors to enlarge the context of the
discussion by correlating, either directly or indirectly, her analysis with
the spiritual and social teachings of the Bahá’í Faith.26

CONCLUSION

Boyle’s active support of modern, scientifically based educational endeav-
ors, particularly the work of Dr. Maria Montessori, appears to have
derived not only from the potential Boyle saw in the systematic application
of Montessori’s ideas to the development of the individual child, but also
from her belief that the Montessori approach was in accord with the spir-
it of the age and could, therefore, serve as an important vehicle to improve
the lot of humankind. In addition, Boyle identified in the writings of
Montessori a number of ideas which she felt might well be useful in pre-
senting Bahá’í theological concepts to members of the thinking public.

In later years, Louise Boyle’s interest in education was focused on the
promotion of the Tarbíyat Schools in Iran. She served on a special com-
mittee constituted for this purpose and had major responsibility for rais-
ing funds for scholarships to further the development of these schools.27

> 17. The term “Master” is a reference to ‘Abdu’l-Bahá.

18. While it is not known precisely to what Boyle is referring, other evidence
suggests that ‘Abdu’l-Bahá had been informed of the ideas and approach of Dr.
Maria Montessori as early as 1912. For example, in the entry for Monday, 1 April
1912, in Mah.múd’s Diary, it is recorded that a certain Mr. and Mrs. Austin told
‘Abdu’l-Bahá about Mrs. Montessori, the founder of the famous school in Rome. It
states: “She has managed the school in such a way that now most of the schools in

Europe and America are following her standards” (Zarqání 25). Furthermore, a let-
ter dated 15 July 1937 from Mrs. May Maxwell to Marion Holley (Hofman), cited
in Nakhjavani, contains the following statement, made in relation to the early train-
ing of her daughter. In it, Mrs. Maxwell explains that she engaged a Montessori
teacher and set up a small school in her home. She then comments on its impact on
her daughter and she provides a comment attributed to ‘Abdu’l-Bahá about
Montessori. She writes: “It [the Montessori school] really did wonders for her and
the other eight children, and ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, with whom I discussed Montessori’s
work in 1912, said that she was the greatest modern psychologist” (7).

19. The American University in Washington, D.C., was chartered by an Act of
the United States Congress in 1893. The university trustees finally broke ground
in 1896. Money was hard to come by so it took a long time to hire teachers and
start holding classes. The first students were admitted in 1914 and President
Woodrow Wilson officially dedicated the university on 27 May 1914 (American
University).

20. For the purposes of this limited research note, no comprehensive search
has been undertaken to determine whether or not the efforts of Boyle and her
colleagues in Washington, D.C., succeeded in providing a platform for Montessori
at the American University.
