To determine  therelationofreligiousbehaviorto certainareas of personality,
such as neuroticism, spontaneity,and worldmindedness,  dimensionsof per-
sonal and religiousbehaviorwereisolatedby factoranalysisand interrelated
by canonicalanalysis.Characteristics of religiousbehaviorand personality-
religioninteractiondifferamongJews,Catholics,Protestants,Baha'is, and
non-affiliates.The Baha'i interactionredefinesreligion.The findingsare
discussedin termsofthedefinition ofreligion,psychosocialvariablesto which
religionis related,differencesamong religiousgroups,and unity through
religion.Studiesof religionmustdistinguish betweenindependent   dimensions
of religiousbehaviorand theirdifferential  correlationwith personalityin

There is littleagreementamongpsychologists   and sociologistsabout the
relationof religiousbehaviorsto othersocial and personalbehaviors.For
example,Freudmaintainedthatreligioncan act as the"universalobsessional
neurosisof humanity,"fixatingindividualsin an infantilestage until the
illusivedoctrineis discarded.-On theotherhand,Jungnotedthatparticipa-
tion in a "livingreligion"and religiousconversionmay constellateuncon-
scious, integrativeprocesses,having a therapeuticeffecton neuroses,and
promotingindividualgrowth.2Other investigators     have observedthat the

> to societyand personalityseems to be based on severalunresolvedissues:
> the definitionof religion,the psychologicaland social variables to which
religionis related,and the differences amongreligiousgroups.

First,what is meantby the word religion?A greatvarietyof behaviors
and beliefshave been called religiousat manytimesby manypeople. Many

studiesworkwithonlyone or tworeligiousbehaviorsor beliefsand theeffect
of theseis ofteninterpreted   as the effectof "religion."When such studies

widelyin boththetheoretical
differ                             and operationaldefinitions of the specific
religiouspracticesor ideas examined,it is difficultto synthesizetheirfindings
into generalstatements   withempiricalbasis about the influenceof religion.
Anotherapproachis to attemptto formulate     a single,comprehensive definition
of religion,applicablein all cultures,religiousgroups,and periodsof history.
Such efforts assumeeitherthatreligiousbehaviorsnot includedin the defini-
tion are to be redefined  as not religiousor that all of the diversereligious
behaviorsand beliefshave some commonessence,purpose,or effect.The
former  possibilitycan be arbitraryand the latteris questionablein lightof
theoppositeeffects  of religionnotedabove. Neitherisolatedstudiesof a few
specificreligiousbehaviorsnor the quest fora singulardefinition    of religion
has enabledus to make clear and generallyacceptablestatements      about the
place ofreligionin man'ssocialand personallife.

While it does not seem possible to reduce everyreligiousbehaviorand
beliefto one centralconceptor definition,  studiesdemonstrating  multidimen-
sionalstructures ofreligiousbehavior4 suggestthepossibility of describing the
fulldiversity of religiousbehaviorsby a fewsimpledimensions.     In orderto
isolateby factoranalysisdimensions  of thereligiousbehaviorof theindividual
whichare more comprehensive      than those foundin previousstudies,the
presentstudyuses a widervarietyof specificreligiousbehaviorsand beliefs
as reportedby subjectsin a widervarietyof religiousgroups.

Given this improvedspecification  of the basic dimensionswhichaccount
forthevarietiesof religiousbehavior,the nextstep is to identifysocial and
psychological variablesto whichthesedimensions    are mostrelated.Behaviors
and attitudesin whichintegration  is theoreticallyimportant seem to be good
candidates,in view of the above observationsof the integrating    and disin-
tegrating influencesof religiousbehavior.Frommanypossibilities,   the follow-

ing areas of personalityand attitudewere chosen: neuroticism   as a lack of
integrationofpersonality;5 spontaneity as an indexof thespecificintegration
of theconsciousand unconscious  minds;6 and worldmindedness   as an attitude
conduciveto social integration ultimatelyon a worldlevel.7

Althoughmanyinvestigators    recognizeimportantdifferences   amongrelig-
ious groups,manydiscussionsof religionare over-simplified    and confusing
by assumingthatthe characteristics  of religiousbehaviorand its relationto
otherbehaviorsand attitudesare the same in all groups.In this studyreli-
giousbehaviorand its interaction withthe above psychosocialvariableswill
be analyzedseparatelyin each of fivereligiousgroups.

Thus, the definitionof religion,the variablesto whichreligionis mostre-
lated,and the differencesamongreligiousgroupsare some of the theoretical
issuesrelevantto the centralquestionsof thisexploratory   studywhichare:
(a) whatare the basic dimensionsof religiousbehavior?(b) how are these
dimensions relatedto certainareas of personalityand attitudes?and (c) how
doesthisrelationdifferin different

religiousgroups?

DIMENSIONS OF RELIGION AND PERSONALITY
TEST INSTRUMENT. Behaviors and ideas relatedto religionand thepsycho-
social issues mentionedabove were assessed by 113 behavioral,attitudinal,
and personalinformation   variables.For the behavioralvariables,subjects
wereasked to rate how oftentheydo what the statementsays by circling
a numberon an eight-point  scale,anchoredwith"AlmostAlwaysDo" at one,
and with "Almost Never Do" at eight. For the attitudinalvariables,
subjectsmarkeda numberon a similarscale anchoredwith"StronglyAgree"
and "Strongly Disagree."

SUBJECTS. In the Chicago, Illinois and Tulsa, Oklahoma areas, social,
educational,and religiousgroupswererequestedto participatein thestudyby
providingan occasionfortheirmembersto completethe questionnaire.    At a
meetingof thosegroupswhichcooperated,thequestionnaire    was administered
and each subjectparticipatedanonymously.  On the basis of theirindication
of the religionto whichtheybelong,the subjectswere classifiedinto five
groups: Jews (n=98), Catholics (n- 130), Protestants(n- 245), Baha'is
(n=112), and non-affiliates (n=96).

These sampleswereused to computethe dimensionsof religiousbehavior
and personality by the factoranalysisdescribedlater. Since thereweredif-

socio-economic status (p>.95). Accordingto Bartlett'stest forthe equality
of morethantwovariances,thereis about chancevariationamongthe vari-
ances of thefivematchedsamplesforage (p>.40), sex (p>.80), education

dimensionsof religionand personalityin the factoranalyses,all the data
reportedbelowincludingthe groupfactormeans,variances,and correlations
and canonicalmeansare based on thesefivematchedsamples.Until future
workmay demonstrate     otherwise,it will be assumedthat differencesamong
thefivereligiousgroupson thesestatisticsare due to theparticularreligious
behaviorand its psychosocialfunctioning    in each group.

In each matchedsample,the mean age is 23 years old (s.d.=5 years);
50% are malesand 50% are females;26%oattendedtheirlast yearof school

skilledworkers,24% clerksand kindredworkers,26%o semi-professionals,
and 30%o professionals.  If under 25 years old, the subject's occupational
statuswas ratedaccordingto his father'soccupation.The averagesubjectin

The Baha'i WorldFaith is a new religionwhichstill containsits pristine

PROCEDURE.The following     operationswere performed   separatelyon both
the 35 religionvariables and the 78 personalityvariables. A covariance
matrixforeach religiousgroupwas calculated.These werepooled and com-
munalitieswereinsertedin the diagonalby the squared multiplecovariance
method.9The pooled covariancematricesforreligionand personalitywere
each factoranalyzed.The fourlargestprincipalaxis factorswere extracted
fromeach,accountingfor96 and 59 percentof theestimatedcommunality       of
the religionand personalitysets respectively. The fourreligionfactorsare
a verycompleteexpressionof the covarianceof the religionvariables.The
fifthfactorin thepersonality  set was not extractedbecause its meaningwas
not clear enoughforit to be usefulas a variablein the canonicalanalyses

RESULTS. Due to the comprehensive     scope of the itemsrepresenting so-
called religiousbehaviors,the fourreligionfactorspresenta fairlycomplete
pictureof the basic dimensionsof experiencecommonlyassociatedwiththe
wordreligion.These factorswerediscoveredin thesensethattheinvestigator

The relationof smokingand drinkingto behaviorsinterpreted    as Self-ac-

to be different modesof individualresponseto social situationsand either

activity(Irrelevant).Perhapsa Worldminded       outlookis incompatiblewith
fullparticipation in Jewishreligiousactivities.

CATHOLICS. 1. Catholics who score low in religiousparticipation(Ir-
relevant)and in beliefin the afterlife,  the soul, and God (Secular) tendto
be at once Neurotic,Self-accommodating,      and Ethnocentric.  On the other
hand, a high ratingon the Salient and SpiritualfactorspredictsAdaptive,
Group-accommodating,     and Worldminded   behaviors.

2. However,if this high ratingon the Salient and Spiritualfactorsis
coupledwithan Orthodoxviewof religion,it is relatedto a patternof Ethno-
centric,Group-accommodating,    Neurotic,and Spontaneousbehaviors.In other
words,forCatholics,an Orthodoxapproachto religiontendsto reversetwo
of the correlatesof fullreligiousparticipation(Salient and Spiritual) from
Adaptive and Worldmindedbehaviorto Neuroticismand Ethnocentrism.
Conversely,  thoughless frequentin the Catholicgroup,a Personalapproach
to religiontendsto reversethe same two correlatesof lack of fullreligious
participation(Irrelevantand Secular) fromNeuroticismand Ethnocentrism
to Adaptiveand Worldminded      behaviors.

In sum, the Salient/Irrelevant  and Spiritual/Secular  factorscovarywith
Group-accommodation/Self-accommodation       and Spontaneity/Inhibition. The
Orthodox/Personal    dimensionis most related to the Ethnocentric/World-
mindedand Neurotic/Adaptive      dimensions.The Salient/Irrelevant   factoris
also relatedto the Neurotic/Adaptive    factor.Hence, an Orthodoxapproach
to religionis relatedto Neuroticism, whilereligiousparticipation(Salient) is
associatedwithAdaptivebehavior.These relationsare an exampleof how
two kinds of religiousbehavior(Orthodoxand Salient), both prevalentin
thesamereligiousgroup,can have oppositeeffects      on thepersonalwell-being
of its members, as expressedby theNeurotic/Adaptive     factor.

PROTESTANTS.For Protestants,     Salience of religion,beliefin the afterlife,
thesoul,and God (Spiritual),Approvalof religion,and a Personalapproach
to religionpredictGroup-accommodating     behavior.A Protestantwho is more
Self-accommodating    tends toward the Irrelevant,Secular, Skeptical,and
Orthodoxpoles of religiousactivity.

BAHA'IS. For Baha'is, engagingin behaviorsSalient to religionwith a
Personaland Approvingoutlookon religionis highlycorrelatedwitha pat-
ternof Worldminded,     Spontaneous,and Adaptivebehaviors.Accordingto
the groupscores   in Table  5, these Baha'i personalityand religionpatterns
are not typicalin the othergroupsstudied.Furthermore,      thesetwo patterns
are highlyinterrelated  onlyin the Baha'i group(see Table 4). Hence, these
personalityand religionpatternsand theirintercorrelation       are unique to
the Baha'i group. This personality-religion   interactionmay be considered

The Neurotic/Adaptive    and the Eth-noce-ntric/Worldmi-nded

factorsare
correlatedwiththe Orthodox/Personal   factorforthe Catholicsand Baha'is.
Unlike the Catholics,Baha'is are moretypicallycharacterized by the com-
binationof Woridminded,    Adaptivebehaviorand a Personal approach to
religion.To considera variableimportantin the Orthodox/Personal  factor,
71 per centof the Baha'i samplehas "changedto or convertedto a religion,"~
while only 16 per cent of the othersubjectshave. The high score of the
Baha'is on Worldminded   and Adaptivebehaviorin thisinteractionmightbe
partlyexplainedby referring   to this difference

in theirpersonalreligious
experience,whichinvolvesthe adoptionof a new religionthroughsacrificing
old tiesand establishing
newcommitments.   This interaction

seemsto support
Jung'sassociationof religiousconversion withan adaptivetransformation of
personality.
NON-AFFILIATES.   Non-affiliates
who tendto disbelievein the afterlife,

the
soul,and God (Secular), but whohave a Personaland Approvingoutlookon
religion,tend to be Worldminded  and Adaptive.Those who are morechar-

acterizedby Ethnocentrism   and Neuroticism tendto believein theseSpiritual
notions,althoughtheyare Skepticalof religionwhichis perceivedas doctrine
and ritual (Orthodox).For both non-affiliates  and Catholics,beliefin the
afterlife,thesoul,and God (Spiritual)is relatedto Ethnocentrism.
ALL SUBJECTS. The last two personality-religion  interactionsin Table 4

in
are based on all the subjects the matchedsamples    from  the fivereligious
groups.This meansthattheseinteractions    expressdifferencesamongas well
as withinthe groups.

1. In the firstinteraction,the groupscoresin Table 5 indicatethat the
majordistinction  is betweenthe Baha'i groupand the Catholics,Protestants,
Jews,and non-affiliates. For the lattergroups,whenreligionis Irrelevant,is
perceivedas Orthodox,and is questioned(Skeptical), it is correlatedwitha
patternof Ethnocentrism,  Neuroticism, and Self-accommodation. Conversely,

DISCUSSION
DEFINITION        OF RELIGION.   Four issues in the role of religion in the life
of modernman were isolated: should one participatein religiousactivity

? shouldone accept theintangiblenotionsinvariablyas-
(Salient/Irrelevant)
sociated with religiousactivity,such as the afterlife,the soul, and God
(Spiritual/Secular)?should therebe religionat all (Skeptical/Approving)?
and shouldreligiousparticipationbe based on sociallyorthodoxfactorsor
on personalfactors(Orthodox/Personal)   ?

Some of thesedimensionsare similarto prevalentkinds of definitions   of
religionor emphasesin studiesof religion.The Salientfactorcorresponds  to
studies of religiousbehaviorand practices,such as feelingcommittedto
religionand attendingreligiousservices.Beliefssuchas thosein the Spiritual
factorwhichinvolvenotionsabout intangibleor supernaturalthingshave
been thesubjectof manystudiesand thecoreof manydefinitions    of religion.
For example,Wach sees religionas an "experienceof the Holy." 17 O'Dea
emphasizestheconcernforthe"beyond"in his discussionof religion.18  Durk-

> 17   Wach, op. cit.
18   O'Dea, op. cit.

> heim takes both practicesand beliefs into account in his definitionof
religion.'l

Our findings   suggestthat theOrthodox/Personal      dimensionis involvedin

pose, and lack of religiousprejudice.ReligionforJungis a Personal,inner
experience.The discrepency      betweenthe Freudianand Jungianapproaches

to religionis herebyexplainedby noting that each concentratedon op-
posite poles of a dimensionof personality-religion        interaction:Neurotic,
OrthodoxbehaviorversusAdaptive,Personalbehavior.In thisexample,two
well-known    studiesof religionseemedto be contradictory      because the full
scope of religiousactivitywas onlypartiallytreatedin each one.

With fourmoreor less independentdimensionsof religiousbehavior,it
is not sufficient to describepopulationdifferences    amongthe groupsas well
as withinthegroupswithonlyone concept,dimension,         or definition

of religion.

As fordifferences   amongthe groups,the groupscoreson the religionfactors
suggest,forexample,that theOrthodoxcomponentof religiousactivitymay
be moremeaningful      in the Jewishgroup,whileanotherfactor,the beliefin
the afterlife,the soul, and God (Spiritual), is of more interestin the
Protestantgroup.In the descriptionof differences         withinthe groups,the
groupvarianceson thereligionfactorsindicatethatthe Skeptical/Approving
issueis a morediscriminating     factorin the Catholicgroup,whilethe Protes-
tantsdisplaymorediversityon the Orthodox/Personal            dimension,perhaps
due to thevarietyof denominations      represented.  The Baha'i grouphas very
low varianceson the Salient/Irrelevant      and the Spiritual/Secularfactors.
Althoughtheseare the twolargestfactors,theydo not distinguish         the most
meaningful   religiousdifferences amongBaha'is. Stillotherconceptsor dimen-
sions of religionwhichare not apparentin the fourreligionfactorsin this
paper,are requiredto describethestructure    ofreligiousbehaviorforBaha'is.20

A singleconceptor definition     of religionis also insufficient to describe
religionin termsof its psychological   and social functions.  For example,in a

Baha'i groupand withEthnocentrism      in the Jewishgroup.Such differences
mayappearbecauseeach groupperceivesand enactsdifferently         thebehaviors

the
defining religionfactorin question.Consideringthe Salient factor(see
Table 1), we mightask of each group: What feelingsand ideas motivate
them?Whose scripturedo theystudy?What is the natureof the groupto
whichtheyare committed?     How reasonableare thereligiouslaws theyobey?
An examinationof such specificbehaviorsin each groupis a next step in
understanding  group differences  in personality-religion interaction.For in-
stance,certainprinciples,  writings,groupcharacteristics, and laws,whichare
prevalentonly in the Baha'i Faith,21mightbe largelyresponsiblefor the
simultaneously  Worldminded,   Spontaneous,and Adaptivebehaviorpattern
foundonly in the Baha'i group.

In sum, with the pluralityof religionfactorsand theirdifferential        fre-
quency,variability,and correlationwith personalityvariables in different
religiousgroups,any one conceptor definition   of religionalone is of littleuse
in studyingthe fullrangeof religiousactivity.Our data suggestthat it is
useful to distinguish, define,and analyze at least four kinds of religious
behavior.

RELIGIONANDPSYCHOSOCIAL       VARIABLES.  The relationof religionto cer-
tain areas of personality and attitudeis clarifiedwhenobservedin termsof
the above dimensionsof religiousbehavior.Single correlations     betweentwo
factorsconsideredbelow are significant    at least at the .05 level. When a
specificgroupis not mentioned,   the correlation is based on all the subjects,
thusincludingvarianceamongas well as withinthe religiousgroups.

Religiousparticipation(Salient) correlateswith Adaptivebehavior,yet
an Orthodoxapproachto religionis correlatedwithNeuroticism.        This seems
to be a conflictin the relationbetweenthe Neurotic/Adaptive         factorand
religion,particularlyin groupssuch as the Catholicsin whichboth Salience
of religionand Orthodoxyare typical.However,by takinginto accounta
thirdcorrelation  betweenSkepticismof religionand Neuroticism,      the cogni-
tivebalancein the triadof an individual,his religiousparticipation,    and his
21 John Ferraby, All Things

Made New: A ComprehensiveOutline of the Baha'i
Faith, Wilmette: Baha'i PublishingTrust, 1966.

Orthodoxconceptionof religioncan be simplydescribed.We mightsay that
the individualis positivelyrelatedto his religiousparticipationsince it is
associatedwithhis personalAdaptation.He would be negativelyrelatedto
his Orthodoxybecause of its associatedNeuroticism.In orderforthis triad
to be balancedaccordingto thetheoryof cognitivebalance,22theremustbe a
negativeor inconsistent    relationshipbetweenthe Orthodoxviews and the
religiousparticipation  of theindividual.The inconsistency   betweenthesetwo
aspectsof his religiousactivitycan be expressedin increasedSkepticismof
religion, whichitselfis correlatedwithNeuroticism.    Thus forexample,mem-
bers of the Catholicgrouptend to be moreNeuroticas theirOrthodoxyis
more intense,and consequentlymore Skepticalof the consistencyof this
Orthodoxoutlookand theirparticipation     in religiousactivity.In a groupwith
highreligiousparticipation   withoutan Orthodoxconceptionof religion,such
as theBaha'is, thereis correspondingly   littleSkepticismof religion.

Except in the Jewishgroup,Spontaneityis related to participationin
religiousactivity(Salient). In the Catholicgroup,Spontaneityis relatedto
beliefin theafterlife,  the soul,and God (Spiritual).

It is interestingto notethatWorldminded     attitudesand Adaptivebehavior
are correlatedwiththe same set of religiousbehaviors:a Personalapproach
to religion,Salience of religion,and Approvalof religion.These data sug-
gest that the attitudespeople hold about the worldand religioncan be im-
portantfactorsin theirpersonalwell-being,       as expressedby the Neurotic/
Adaptivefactor.

Self-accommodating    behavioris correlatedwiththe Irrelevanceof religion,
Secularbeliefs,Skepticismof religion,and a Personalapproachto religion.
On the otherhand, the Salient,Spiritual,Approving,and Orthodoxfactors
are each correlatedwithGroup-accommodating        behavior.

DIFFERENCES     AMONG RELIGIOUS      GROUPS.    Differencesamong the five
religiousgroupsstudiedwereobservedin the frequency       and variabilityof the
fourkinds of religiousbehaviorand in personality-religion        interaction.A
distinction amongthegroupswhichseemsto pervadeall thisdata is between
the older establishedreligionand the new religion.Comparingthe religion
factormeansof the Jews,Catholics,and Protestantsas opposedto Baha'is,
in the new religionthe individualparticipationis greater,the beliefin the
afterlife, the soul, and God is stronger, the Approvalof religionis greater,
and the approach to religionis more Personal. This patternof religious
behaviorcorrelateswithWorldmindedness,      Adaptation,and Group-accommo-
dationin thefirstpersonality-religion interaction based on all subjectsinTable
4\. This interactionportraysthis distinctionbetweenthe older established

religionand thenewreligion.A further        whichwas mentioned

difference                  above
is that the conceptsor dimensionswhichfullydescribereligiousactivityin
the Baha'i groupare differentfromthose reportedin this paper. Because
based on a sampleof one group,this characterization

of a new religionas
opposed to an older establishedreligionmay not generalizeto othernew
religious groups.

Anotherdistinction  whichreappearsthroughout    the data is betweenthe
membersof establishedreligiousgroupsand the collectionof individualsnot
formallyaffiliated  with any religion.Comparedwith the Catholics,Protes-
tants,and Jewson the religionfactormeans,the non-affiliates      participate
muchless in religiousactivity,disbelievein the afterlife,the soul, and God,
have a morePersonalapproachto religion,   and are moreSkepticalof religion.
This religionpatterncorrelateswithSelf-accommodation     and Worldminded-
ness in the second personality-religion interactionbased on all subjectsin
Table 4, whichdescribesthe main distinctionbetweenthose who are and
are not formally  affiliated

withan old establishedreligion.
RELIGION AND UNITY. Many studies discuss the relationof religionto
unityor integration  on thepsychological and social levels,yet therehas not
been systematictreatment    of the kindsof evidencewhichmightbe used to
indicatethepresenceor absenceof unity.In the contextof the data in this
study,the conceptof unitythroughreligioncan be operationally      definedin
thefollowing  ways.

First,interpreting factorsas forcesunderlying  or affecting behavior,the
presenceof fourreligionfactorsinstead of just one implies that religion
today is generallynot a unitaryforce.The great varietyof patternsof
religiousbehaviordescribedby the pluralityof religiousdimensionsoften
comeinto conflict,  bothwithinand amongreligiousgroups.In the Catholic
group,the Orthodoxoutlookseems to conflictwith religiousparticipation,
becauseeach has oppositerelationsto the Adaptivityof behavior.Instances
of conflictamongreligiousgroupsare too familiarto requirecitation.

Second,unitythroughreligioncan be inferredwhen particularreligious
dimensions  are relatedto psychosocialbehaviorswhichare thoughtto express
integration. AssumingthatAdaptivebehavioris integrated    behaviorand that
Worldminded   attitudeslead to increasedunityon theworldlevel,thenthose
religiousbehaviorsrelatedto thesepsychosocialvariablesmay themselves     be
said to be unifying.

Third,theunityof a socialgroupcan be describedin termsof sharedpop-
ulationcharacteristics whichare thoughtto be importantby the members
of thegroup,suchas theirrace or values.Unitywithina religiousgroupcan
be inferredfromlow varianceson religiousand psychosocialissues. For
example,whilethe Catholicstendto disagreeon whetherone shouldpartici-

> pate in religiousactivityand questionthevalidityof religion,thereis greater
agreementand hence unity in belief in the afterlife,the soul, and God

(see Table 3). In comparisonwith the othersamples,the Baha'i matched

> ality,and religiousbackground,    while theyare most homogeneousin their
> positionson the Salient/Irrelevant,   the Spiritual/Secular,  and the World-
> minded/Ethnocentric   factors.How mightthese facts be explained?While

growthand goal achievement.    For Baha'is, thefunction  of groupmaintenance

by unityin personaland religiousorientations,
> is fulfilled                                               so thedemographic
> diversityand the associatedWorldminded      attitude are not  threatsto group
> unity.Instead theymay be harnessedforgoal achievement.         Since the other

> groupmaintenancerequireshomogeneity       on some othervariables.The main
> candidatesseem to be the demographiccharacteristics       of race, nationality,
> and religiousbackground.An Ethnocentric      attitudeprobablyhelps to main-
> tain this necessary demographichomogeneity.Hence, the Ethnocentric
> tendencyin thesegroupsmay be understoodas a conditionforgroupmain-
> tenance.Also, the development    of a Worldminded    outlookin these groups
mightinvolveweakeninggroupunityor finding         a new basis forit.

Finally,thequestionnaire  item"feelingcommitted    to yourreligion"defines
unitythroughreligionin termsof groupcohesion,the sum of the forcesat-
tracting membersto theirgroup.Comparingthemeansof thereligiousgroups
on thisitem,the Baha'is showmuchmorecommitment            to theirreligion(i.e.,
cohesion) than Catholics,Protestants,and Jews (p<.001 accordingto the
Scheffe methodformultiplecomparisons).

Turningour attentionfora momentto the prospectsforfutureresearch,
thepresentstudycould be expandedin threedirections.First,subjectswho
are olderand lowerin socio-economic     status could be includedin samples,
and the effects of age, sex, education,and occupationon personality-religion
interaction couldbe clarified.Second,otherreligiousgroupsmightbe studied
to discovernewaspectsof personality-religion    interaction.Third,a widerand
more comprehensive    selectionof personalityand social variablescould be
examinedto identifyotherareas of human behaviorin which religionis
important.
