        BAHÁ’Í-INSPIRED PERSPECTIVES ON HUMAN RIGHTS

Rights to Human and Social Development

Rights to Human and Social Development:

> a Survey of the Activities of the
> Bahá’í International Community

BY GRAHAM HASSALL

Throughout the second half of the Twentieth century the contribution of the
Bahá’í International Community (BIC)1 to dialogue concerning human and social
development was principled, systematic, and sustained. It was principled in
that it drew on the Bahá’í Writings for its core conceptions. It was systematic in
that it subjected these conceptions to logical analysis, in addition to reporting
on the practice of Bahá’í communities worldwide. Finally, it was sustained,
inasmuch as the BIC contributed to, and encouraged, the major initiatives in the
development dialogue, commencing with the drafting of the Universal Decla-
ration of Human Rights in 1948,2 to the Millennium Forum in 2000, the largest
gathering of NGOs to ever assemble for consultation and dialogue on the mis-
sion of the United Nations, and which the BIC had the honour of co-chairing. In
these five decades the BIC has presented several hundred oral and written
statements to meetings of the UN, and to other significant NGO meetings, in
addition to supporting the processes of dialogue through coordination and fa-
cilitation roles.3

In this essay I suggest that the contributions of the BIC to the articulation of
rights to human and social development and have centered on six main themes:
(1) the need for a global complex systems approach to contemporary problem
solving; (2) the fundamental principle of the oneness of humanity;(3) the essen-
tial role of religious belief; (4) the primacy of education and training over the
restraints offered by laws; (5) the need for a values-based approach that begins
at the level of individual responsibility, and (6) Observations on the effective-
ness of the United Nations Organization.

Rights to Human and Social Development

Before examining these themes in detail, it is useful to summarize the emer-
gence of human rights in the twentieth century.

The articulation of the rights of individuals, and the legal means for their
protection, emerged partly as a response to the large-scale brutality of the
twentieth century. Other factors included a decline in traditional guarantees of
protection afforded to individuals, evident in increased incidences of human
rights abuses by both state and non state actors. Furthermore, the dramatic changes
in world conditions in the twentieth century, principally the shift to globalism
and the accommodations this requires on the part of individual cultures and
nations, have required the reconceptualisation of traditional practices so as to
ensure agreement on common global or universal standards while allowing for
individual difference and diversity. The rapid changes of the last two centu-
ries, moreover, have necessitated a reconceptualization of the origin of rights,
and the purposes for which rights are articulated. Since the late eighteenth
century rights have been viewed as claims by individual citizens against the
state, but this notion is increasingly giving way to the idea that rights express
normative conditions of mutuality that underlie relations between states and
the citizens who constitute ‘civil society’.

The basic elements of the global human rights framework are readily iden-
tified. In 1946 an 18-member United Nations Commission on Human Rights
commenced drafting a “declaration” of rights it considered to pertain to each
individual, irrespective of their race, nationality, gender, or creed. This be-
came the Universal Declaration of Human Rights,4 adopted by the United Na-
tions General Assembly on 10 December 1948. The UDHR proposes that Human
Rights are universal and indivisible. This means that the different aspects of
human rights - civil, cultural, economic, political and social - must be consid-
ered together, rather than as separable entities.

Although merely a ‘declaration’ of desirable standards pertaining to human
rights, the UDHR has had considerable impact on the ways in which states and
citizens understand notions of individual rights and obligations. It has inspired
more than 60 human rights instruments that now constitute an international stan-
dard of human rights. This second process, of transforming desirable ‘norms’
into international law, commenced with the concluding in 1966 of two “cov-
enants” concerning human rights: the International Covenant on Civil and Politi-
cal Rights (ICCPR)5 and the International Covenant on Economic, Social and
Cultural Rights (ICESCR).6

The rights contained in the UDHR and the two covenants (which to-
gether have become known as the “International Bill of Rights”) were further
elaborated in such legal documents as the International Convention on the Elimi-

Rights to Human and Social Development

nation of All Forms of Racial Discrimination, which declares dissemination of
ideas based on racial superiority or hatred as being punishable by law; the
Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women,
covering measures to be taken for eliminating discrimination against women in
political and public life, education, employment, health, marriage and family;
and the Convention on the Rights of the Child, which lays down guarantees in
terms of the child’s human rights. The more significant human rights treaties and
declarations now include:
- Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide

(1948)
> - Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees (1961)
- Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination

(1965)
- Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against

Women (1979)
- Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treat-

ment or Punishment (1984)
> - Convention on the Rights of the Child (1989)
- Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and

Members of Their Families (1990).7
Although the nation-states are not yet welded into a united global body
politic, they nonetheless feel impelled toward a common set of standards, and
know intuitively that human rights development constitutes a noble aim. These
treaties are now important instruments of international law. In voluntarily ac-
ceding to them, countries agree to bind themselves to the standards they con-
tain, and undertake to report at set intervals to the United Nations’ Committee
on Human Rights. Within the UN system, six committees have been estab-
lished to monitor compliance of States parties to specific treaties:

> - The Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination
> - The Human Rights Committee
> - The Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights
> - The Committee against Torture
> - The Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women

Rights to Human and Social Development

> - The Committee on the Rights of the Child
> Together with the elaboration of these international laws and the interna-
tional institutions to administer them, progress in their implementation has
been considered at a series of world meetings: on the Environment (Stockholm,
1972 and Rio De Janiero, 1992), Human Rights (Vienna, 1993), Population and
Development (Cairo, 1994), Women (Mexico 1975, Copenhagen 1980, and
Beijing, 1995), and Social Development (Copenhagen, 1995). This latter confer-
ence focused on progress with the implementation of policies concerning ‘hu-
man development, and ‘social development’, which have been at the focus of
the United Nations Development Program. 8

The UNDP’s Human Development Report for 1999 provides a seven-item agenda
to secure human development in the era of globalisation:
1. Strengthen policies and actions for human development, and adapt them

to the new realities of the global economy;
2. Reduce the threats of financial volatility – of the boom and bust economy

– and all their human costs;
> 3. Take stronger global action to tackle global threats to human security;
4. Enhance public action to develop technologies for human development

and the eradication of poverty;
> 5. Reverse the marginalisation of poor, small countries;
6. Remedy the imbalances in the structures of global governance with new

efforts to create a more inclusive system;
7. Build a more coherent and more democratic architecture for global gov-

ernance in the 21s t century.9

The Need for a Global Complex Systems Approach to Contemporary Prob-
lem Solving

One of the clearest expositions of the idea of complexity within statements
of the BIC is found in a 1992 statement to a Committee of the South Pacific
Commission:

> “The earth is but one country,” Bahá’u’lláh asserted, “and mankind its citizens.” As the
> magnitude, complexity and urgency of environmental problems have gradually forced
> themselves on public attention, the logic of this prescription has become daily more

> apparent. The available international legislative machinery and processes are proving in-
> adequate, primarily because they are based on laws governing nation-states. Moreover,
> the process for creating environmental legislation, which addresses only one problem at a
> time, is fragmented and unsystematic. No one body is responsible for drafting interna-
> tional environmental legislation. Nor have the nations of the world agreed on a set of
> principles upon which such legislation can be based. Furthermore, the countries signing the
> various legislative instruments are rarely identical. Thus, it is almost impossible to harmo-
> nize or combine agreements. Many countries with limited numbers of diplomats and
> experts cannot cope with the time-consuming and expensive procedures currently in
> place, particularly as the number of negotiations is increasing to respond to pressing global
> environmental problems. The present ad hoc process can only become more unmanage-
> able. Numerous proposals have been offered to provide global mechanisms to create and
> support a sustainable pattern of development. Some experts advise strengthening the
> existing UN system by upgrading the mandates of agencies such as the UN Environment
> Programme (UNEP), reconfiguring the Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC), or using
> the Trusteeship Council to administer certain global resources. Others suggest creating
> new bodies such as an environmental security council, a World Court of environmental
> justice, or an international environmental negotiating body to prepare, adopt and revise
> international legislation on issues requiring global action.
> However well motivated and helpful such proposals are, it is apparent to the Bahá’í Inter-
> national Community that the establishment of a sustainable pattern of development is a
> complex task with widespread ramifications. It will clearly require a new level of commit-
> ment to solving major problems not exclusively associated with the environment. These
> problems include militarization, the inordinate disparity of wealth between and within
> nations, racism, lack of access to education, unrestrained nationalism, and the lack of
> equality between women and men. Rather than a piecemeal approach conceived in
> response to the needs of the nation-states, it seems clearly preferable to adopt an um-
> brella agreement under which specific international codes could be promulgated. Long-
> term solutions will require a new and comprehensive vision of a global society, supported
> by a new system of values. Acceptance of the oneness of humanity is the first fundamental
> prerequisite for this reorganization and administration of the world as one country, the
> home of humankind.10

This passage is quoted at length to illustrate the ‘complex relations’ that the
BIC sees between specific problems of development, such as those related to
the environment, and the system as a whole. This theme has been reiterated in
numerous BIC statements. The idea of complexity in problem-solving is re-
lated to the indivisibility of economic, civil, social, cultural and political rights:

> Without economic rights, the exercise of civil or social rights is severely attenuated. With-
> out cultural rights, an individual or community will have the greatest difficulty in exercising
> political or economic rights to a degree that meets the essential requirements of their
> respective situations. 11

Bahá’í proposals before UN agencies have urged a “searching re-examina-
tion” of prevailing beliefs about the nature and purpose of the development
process and the roles of its various protagonists. They relate development to
such processes as gender equality, the extension of consultative processes, a
new work ethnic, and access to the generation and application of knowledge.12
The question of poverty alleviation, and alleviation of gross disparities be-
tween rich and poor is linked directly to consciousness of the oneness of hu-
manity:

> A new economic order can be founded only on an unshakable conviction of the oneness of
> mankind. Discussions aimed at solving problems related to extreme poverty based on the
> premise that we are one human family rapidly expand beyond the current vocabulary of
> economics. They demand a wider context, one which anticipates the emergence of a
> global system of relationships resting on the principles of equity and justice.13

Concerning attempts to bridge the disparities between rich and poor, for
instance, the BIC referred in a 1994 statement to the UN Sub-Commission on
the Prevention of Discrimination and Protection of Minorities to the Bahá’í
view of income distribution,

> “…which allows for differences but would eliminate both extreme wealth and extreme
> poverty. The accumulation of excessive fortunes by a small number of individuals while
> the masses are in need is, according to Bahá’í teachings, an intolerable injustice. Modera-
> tion should, therefore, be established by means of laws and regulations that would limit
> personal wealth and provide everyone with access to the means for living a dignified life.” 14

Each of these statements points to a preference for examining the world-
system as a whole, rather than seeing the solution to development and rights
issues as a series of linear responses to individual challenges.

The Prosperity of Humankind

The need to see development as a set of complex relations was further
explored in a document entitled The Prosperity of Humankind prepared by the
Bahá’í International Community for distribution at the 1995 United Nations Sum-
mit on Social Development.15 It consists of seven sections, each suggesting new
approaches to defining a strategy for global development. These sections con-
sider conceptions of “development,” peace, the concept of “the oneness of hu-
mankind,” justice, human rights, education, science and technology, science and

religion, history, human nature, economics, environment, power, authority, struc-
tures of government and law. The Prosperity of Humankind suggests that pros-
perity has both physical and spiritual dimensions. Development is widely
defined materially, but this has proven inadequate. The incentives of existing
systems - eg economic systems, aid systems, have not moved the masses (ie,
despite so much attention to “economic development,” the masses continue to
live in poverty).

Reconceptualizing ‘Governance’

Prosperity suggests that to think in terms of dichotomies such as “government
v. the people,” “science v. religion,” individual rights v. group rights” - is to
miss their essential interrelatedness (government & people, science & religion,
individual & group rights, etc). This new, inclusive paradigm considers “wholes”
or “connectivities,” rather than “oppositions” (there can still be tensions within
interrelations, but that is another subject). So-called commitment to both “de-
mocracy” and “economic development” presents a paradox: if so much power is
now in the hands of “the people,” why is it that they have not been able to
change their material conditions? Partly, this shows flaws in the “roles” played
by the “protagonists”: governments have viewed the masses as recipients of aid
and of development programs; future models of democracy will transfer pow-
ers of decision-making to the grass-roots.

The promotion of human rights thus requires “fundamental redefinition
of human relationships” - and movement in this direction has “barely begun.”
Elements in the redefinition include:
- consultation (requiring standards far beyond current practices of nego-

> tiation and compromise, and “culture of protest” - associated with debate,
> propaganda, the adversarial method, and paradigms of partisanship).
- far greater access to knowledge, and to the opportunity to “apply it to the

shaping of human affairs.”
Democracy has become associated with partisanship, with cynicism, apathy
and corruption. It has to be raised above these results of the “political theatre”
produced by nominations, candidature, electioneering and solicitation. Both
governments and groups of individuals have been galvanised by visions of the
possibility of world order. The efforts of both groups are to be supported.
Reassessment of structures and processes of government will include:

> - redefinition of the terms “power” and “authority”
> - Formulation of laws that are “universal in both character and authority.”

- reformulation of consultative practices, which includes recognition of

> the interrelationship between justice, consultation, and the attainment of
> social and economic development.
- transformation of a sometimes “punitive” conception of justice to one

> that links justice to a) the inextricable link between the progress of the
> individual and the progress of society; b) the ability to consult dispas-
> sionately on options when making policy decisions
- ensuring that “technological break-throughs” and “limited resources” are

not reserved for a privileged minority
- continued development of human rights law, protecting civil and politi-

> cal rights, as well as social and economic rights (without placing them in
> a dichotomous relationship).
Power has in the past been identified as an attribute of an individual or
group, and seen as an instrument of domination, acquisition, etc. But this tradi-
tional sense of power is useless to the “needs of humanity’s future.” The correct
approach to the use of power, particularly by leaders, is set out in section VI.

Prosperity suggests that traditional religions have continued paternalistic at-
titudes toward “the masses,” and have not encouraged their maturation - ie, their
involvement in making the decisions that have the most impact on their lives.
The reasons for which modern thinkers have rejected religion are to some
extent understandable, but it is necessary to recognise the fruits of religion,
not only its past abuses. Religion has cultivated the moral qualities that the
progress of civilisation has relied on - moral character, sense of duty, etc.

The Problem of Knowledge Production, Ownership, and Dissemination

Prosperity urges that attention be paid to the philosophy of knowledge. Sci-
ence and religion can be conceived of as knowledge systems. These are inter-
related through history, and have been used to organise experience, interpret
surroundings, explore human powers, and discipline both intellectual and moral
life. Society has to think in terms of process, rather than structure alone. Cor-
rect processes will create appropriate structures. Access to knowledge of sci-
ence and technology must be more evenly spread across the globe. The document
suggests that a strong link exists between knowledge production and morality.
When people can distinguish between “fact” and “conjecture,” they will be able
to contribute to human progress. An expansion of knowledge extends human
abilities, raises the level of human capacity, and when done in the right way
will contribute to achieving prosperity

The Fundamental Principle of the Oneness of Humanity

The BIC urged the first meeting of the committee making preparations for
the World Summit for Social Development to bring ‘fresh thinking’ and a ‘uni-
fied spirit’ to planning for the meeting, and suggested in particular adoption of
the principle of the ‘oneness of humanity’ as the “essential standard for order-
ing humankind’s collective life on the planet”:

> To move beyond parochialism and particularism will necessitate bold initiatives and un-
> precedented courage on the part of the Preparatory Committee (PREPCOM). The re-
> sponsibility to foster the well-being of all members of a society - the basic tenet of
> modern social welfare—must now be expanded to include all the peoples of the earth.
> Only by embracing the principle of the oneness of humanity can the PREPCOM ensure
> that deliberations throughout the preparatory process will center on the well-being of the
> entire human family, there by extending the concept of social welfare beyond national
> boundaries to the whole world. We, therefore, urge the PREPCOM to make the principle
> of the oneness of humanity the “central unifying theme of the Summit,” to explore its
> ramifications for the peoples and nations of the earth, and to translate it into workable
> programs and practical commitments.16

“Consciousness” of the oneness of humanity refers to the realisation of this
condition by the collectivity of “human consciousness” which is itself “an infi-
nite diversity of individual minds and motivations.” Consciousness of the one-
ness of humanity must be taught in educational systems, and must be propagated
through the mass media. Fruits of the attainment of a Consciousness of the one-
ness of humanity will include:
- protection of peoples from the “age-old demons” of ethnic and religious

strife.

> - shift to processes of collaboration and conciliation
> - desire to base decisions on just principles
> - development of laws that are “universal in both character and authority.”
- the more even spread of access to knowledge of science and technology

across the globe.
The extent of international migration and the impact of international eco-
nomic events on local and national economies reinforce the reality that the
world has become one system.

The Emancipation of Women and the Achievement
of Full Equality Between the Sexes.

A related principle concerns the equality of the sexes. In June 1994 the BIC
co-authored a statement to the same committee expressing concern that the
Draft Declaration and Draft Programme of Action did not give sufficient recog-
nition to the family “as a basic social institution and an undisputable social net-
work,” nor did it reflect its “vital contributions to individuals and its impact on
society.”17

BIC statements on social development have emerged from reflection of
practice within the Bahá’í Community. For example, a UNIFEM-funded Bahá’í
International Community project “Traditional Media as Change Agent” which
started in 1991 had its origins in a statement by the Bahá’í International Commu-
nity to the UN Commission on the Status of Women in 1988 which suggested
that “a primary target for communication related to development projects for
women may well be men.” The project, which commenced in a rural region of
eastern Cameroon in 1991, began with community consultation on the responsi-
bilities carried by the males and females within the family and the community.
Increased awareness amongst the males of the disproportionate duties con-
ducted by the women led to new agreements concerning responsibility for
child-care.18

The Essential Role of Religious Belief

The BIC has contributed to the articulation of the meaning of ‘spiritual de-
velopment’ as referred to in UN documents. For instance, a document pre-
sented to a Consultation on “Development Social Welfare Policies and
Programmes” in Vienna in September 1987,19 drew attention to (Article 13 (b))
(“The establishment of a harmonious balance between scientific, technological
and material progress and the intellectual, spiritual, cultural and moral advance-
ment of humanity.”), pointing out that spiritual factors include “social harmony,
integration, and unity within the individual and in society.”20 Such cooperative
trends exist in current social relations, and could be expanded if given “wide
and systematic support, lead to a rapid channeling of the earth’s abundant re-
sources and the application of its technical know-how for the redress of cur-
rent material problems.”21

The BIC has also contributed an understanding of the proper role of reli-
gion as source of inspiration and has suggested that Religion “has played and
continues to play an important role in facilitating a spirit of cooperation as well

as of service and harmony.”22 Historically, religion has exerted a “profound
influence on all societies” had has been a primary force for social progress:

> Those universal spiritual principles which lie at the heart of religion—tolerance, compas-
> sion, love, justice, humility, sacrifice, trustworthiness, dedication to the well-being of oth-
> ers, and unity – are the foundations of progressive civilization.23

In Comments on the Draft Declaration and Draft Programme of Action for
Social Development presented at the second session of the Preparatory Com-
mittee for the World Summit for Social Development in August 1994 the BIC
was critical of the fundamentally materialistic view of “the purpose and funda-
mental nature of the individual and society.” Development measured in terms
of “at every level of our world society to promote economic and social justice”
are all essential elements of the development paradigm for the 21st century,
but they are not sufficient.

Development will only result from a balanced regard to both spiritual and
material dimensions. For instance, rather than simply being the implementation
of social policy, development requires such spiritual values as “a sense of
excellence, a willingness to sacrifice, integrity, trustworthiness, capacity for
co-operation and a desire for unity.”24

The idea that meeting material needs; providing universal education; and
fashioning democratic institutions and legal codes, are the main factors in se-
curing social development suggests a purely materialistic conception of devel-
opment. It presumes that human happiness, security and well-being, social
cohesion, and economic justice will result as by-products of material success –
a premise which in the Bahá’í view is false, since such conditions are in reality
produced through a “complex and dynamic interplay between the satisfaction
of material and social needs and the spiritual fulfillment of the individual.”
Satisfaction of both spiritual and material needs requires an appeal to universal
values that allow the individual to transcend “narrow self-interest,” and that
recognise the interdependence “of the peoples and nations of the planet.”25

The Bahá’í International Community urged that the Declaration and Programme
of Action penned at the Copenhagen Summit on Social Development “address
in a substantive manner the constructive role that religion should play in social
development.”26

The Primacy of Education and Training over the Restraints Offered by Laws

Bahá’ís have long been involved in the promotion of human rights, both
within the framework of the evolving UN system, and beyond it. 27 Bahá’í com-
munities were active participants in the International Human Rights Year, 1968,28
and have contributed greatly to human rights discussions in international meet-
ings many times since. This involvement has recently been noted by Traer, who
observed that the Bahá’í statement of 1968 was similar to that of the Commis-
sion of Churches on International Affairs, in that both emphasised the principle
that “…governments could not grant human rights, but could only recognize the
human rights which man, by virtue of his being and destiny, already possessed.”29
It is certainly the case that the Bahá’í contribution includes constant reminders
of the historic connection between the ancient quest for knowledge, rooted in
all the major religious and cultural traditions, and the modern expression of
the same “fundamental right” as expressed in such formulations as freedom of
thought, conscience and belief.30

BIC activity within the UN focused on defence of the rights of Bahá’ís
persecuted for their beliefs in Iran and other countries have sensitized the
Bahá’í Community to issues of religious prejudice, and to the search for rem-
edies to such persecution. At the same time, this experience has contributed to
the BIC’s awareness of the existing human rights mechanisms, and allows it to
make proposals concerning practical reforms to the system. Despite its flagrant
disregard for its obligations as a signatory to the ICCPR, Iran “…has neither
denounced, derogated from, nor attached any reservations to the ICPR since the
succession of the Khomeini government.”31 In “Religious Human Rights Under
the United Nations,” Lerner describes the reporting process, and provides an
instance in which the fate of the Bahá’í Community is mentioned:

> The yearly reports of the [Human Rights] Committee, issued as General Assembly Offi-
> cial Records (GAPR), Supplement No. 40, contain rich information on religious rights.
> When examining the periodic state reports, members of the Committee asked relevant
> questions and required additional information from the representatives of the states on
> legislation and facts concerning such rights. Just to mention a few recent instances, when
> the second periodic report of Morocco was discussed, questions were asked regarding
> procedures relating to the recognition of religious sects, the status of the Bahá’í Faith,
> marriages between members of different religious groups, and the meaning of terms such
> as ‘religion of the state’, ‘revealed religions’ or ‘heretical sects’.32

In the Bahá’í view, freedom of belief in matters of religion is best pursued
by promoting education. 33 Since prejudice “…has no basis in logic or reason,”

and “…cannot be legislated out of existence,” 34 the BIC has suggested that suc-
cess in implementing the Declaration on the Elimination of All Forms of Intol-
erance and of Discrimination based on Religion or Belief lay in the document’s
wide dissemination, and in taking determined and active steps to “promote
understanding, tolerance and respect in matters relating to religion or belief.
While laws may “…prevent the gross and overt victimization of individuals or
groups” they cannot “…remove the seeds of prejudice from men’s hearts.”35

In 1993 the United Nations convened a Conference in Vienna to review
global progress in advancing human rights.36 In addition to presenting a state-
ment, the BIC presented a joint statement on behalf of fourteen other religious
NGOs concerning the promotion of religious tolerance, a statement that
emphasised the role of education, rather than law, in promoting tolerance:

> If tolerance is rooted in love, intolerance is often rooted in the cultural and historical
> antagonisms associated with religious traditions. Because antagonisms are often born of
> ignorance and limited understanding, education can reveal the common spiritual values
> underlying various beliefs and practices and can thereby foster religious tolerance. The
> role of the individual in promoting tolerance is of paramount importance. Legal mecha-
> nisms alone will not end religious intolerance as long as people believe that differences in
> religious beliefs and practices are legitimate grounds for discrimination. Therefore, educa-
> tion programs must be aimed not only at providing accurate information and correcting
> misconceptions but at identifying those principles and values that will open both minds
> and hearts. It is proposed, therefore, that education seek to foster not just tolerance of
> religious diversity but genuine appreciation for various beliefs. Curriculum must include
> not only study of the Declaration on the Elimination of All Forms of Intolerance and of
> Discrimination based on Religion or Belief but the comparative study of various scriptures
> and spiritual traditions. Such an exploration, if undertaken with an open mind, will doubt-
> less reveal remarkable similarities among religious teachings on ethical matters. The dis-
> covery of a common thread of shared values will help to instill in individuals an appreciation
> for the Declaration and demonstrate its necessity.37

The BIC has also presented statements concerning the promotion of reli-
gious tolerance at other UN sessions, particularly those of the Commission on
Human Rights.38 In August 1993 it suggested to the Sub-Commission on the Pre-
vention of Discrimination and Protection of Minorities a call for “…efforts to
promote greater understanding amongst all people, particularly through inter-
faith dialogues and through systematic efforts by the Centre for Human Rights
to disseminate the principles of the 1981 Declaration through the media” and
urged their inclusion in the curriculum of schools and universities.39

When the United Nations declared the UN Decade for Human Rights Edu-
cation (1995-2004) the BIC submitted a written statement to the UN Commis-
sion on Human Rights indicating its full support for the Commission’s Plan of
Action. The BIC commented:

> The Plan of Action prepared by the High Commissioner for Human Rights reflects this
> integrated conception of education by defining human rights education as “training, dis-
> semination and information efforts aimed at the building of a universal culture of human
> rights through the imparting of knowledge and skills and the moulding of attitudes which are
> directed to:
> a) The strengthening of respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms;

b) The full development of the human personality and the sense of its dignity;

> c) The promotion of understanding, tolerance, gender equality and friendship among all
> nations, indigenous peoples and racial, national, ethnic, religious and linguistic groups;

d) The enabling of all persons to participate effectively in a free society; and

> e) The furtherance of the activities of the United Nations for the maintenance of peace.
> The Bahá’í International Community fully embraces these goals and objectives. Human
> rights education, if it is to succeed, must seek to transform individual attitudes and behaviour
> and thereby establish, within every local and national community, a new “culture” of
> respect for human rights. Only such a change in the fundamental social outlook of every
> individual - whether a government official or an ordinary citizen - can bring about the
> universal observance of human rights principles in the daily lives of people. In the final
> analysis, the human rights of an individual are respected and protected - or violated - by
> other individuals, even if they are acting in an official capacity. Accordingly, it is essential to
> touch the hearts, and elevate the behaviour, of all human beings, if, in the words of the Plan
> of Action, human rights are to be transformed “from the expression of abstract norms” to
> the “reality” of the “social, economic, cultural and political conditions” experienced by
> people in their daily lives.” 40

In 1993 the BIC suggested the three most significant obstacles to the imple-
mentation of human rights as being “the exercise of unfettered national sover-
eignty,” inadequate enforcement mechanisms for human rights treaty obligations,
and a general lack of awareness of human rights, “…particularly among those
entrusted with administering justice at the local level.”41

Accordingly, the BIC has frequently supported the idea of strengthen-
ing various branches of the UN. In regard to the enforcement of compliance
with human rights obligations, it recommended to the Vienna Conference on

Human Rights in 1993 that such Committees as the Human Rights Committee
and the Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination be strength-
ened, and that international criminal jurisdiction for crimes against humanity
and for flagrant violations of internationally recognized human rights be in-
vested in a permanent body.42 At other times the BIC has suggested wording for
declarations being drafted by the Commission on Human Rights.43

The Need for a Values-based Approach that Begins
at the Level of Individual Responsibility

This approach to development emphasises the need for moral and ethical
values, without which problems of corruption, crime and erosion of family-life
will render real development impossible. It also emphasises the need for
change at grass roots, as much as in institutions at higher levels.44 Hence the BIC
suggested to the 49th (1993) session of the United Nations Commission on
Human Rights on the issue of realizing the economic, social and cultural rights
contained in the UDHR and the International Covenant on Economic, Social and
Cultural Rights: “The fostering of grassroots initiative is essential to the elimi-
nation of poverty; this concept has both moral and educational implications which
demand profound study: 45

> In the New World Order envisaged by Bahá’u’lláh, rights are inseparable from responsibili-
> ties. A fundamental purpose of life is to contribute to the advancement of civilization.
> Idleness and begging are unacceptable in a well-functioning society, while work performed
> in the spirit of service is elevated to the station of worship. Thus the right to work, the right
> to contribute to society, takes on a spiritual dimension, and the responsibility to be pro-
> ductive applies to everyone. This attitude toward work profoundly influences the Bahá’í
> approach to social and economic development. Communities are encouraged to identify
> their own needs and initiate their own projects, many of which focus on alleviating pov-
> erty.46

Several BIC statements illustrate this principle with examples from the
experience of the Bahá’í Community.47 Popular participation is essential to the
success of social programmes. “It promotes the dignity of individuals and en-
ables communities to benefit from the outflow of human creativity and spirit.”48
Yet another aspect of promoting ‘grass roots’ responsibility and participation
concerns promotion of a ‘work ethic’:

> Both the responsibility and the right to work are sacred. Idleness and begging have no place
> in a well-functioning society, while work performed in the spirit of service is elevated to
> the station of worship. The Special Rapporteur states that “the poorest, in general, in their
> capacity as citizens, are neither associated to the decision making process nor are they
> allowed to exercise responsibilities within the community.” This situation is unacceptable,
> given that a fundamental purpose of life is to contribute to the advancement of civilization.
> Thus the right to work takes on a spiritual dimension, and the responsibility to be produc-
> tive applies to everyone.49

The role of the individual is further treated in The Prosperity of Humankind.

This document, referred to above, suggests that the maturation of society (the
group) has not occurred at the expense of individuality. It requires, rather, for
its fullest development, the development of the potential of each individual.

Observations on the Effectiveness of the United Nations Organization

A final theme of Bahá’í contributions to dialogue on rights and develop has
focused on the development institutions and processes themselves. The BIC
first commented on the structure of the United Nations Organization in 1955.50
The BIC has promoted the Bahá’í view that ultimately a world federation will
emerge, either through restructuring or transformation of the United Nations
system. 51 Optimal global institutions will emerge through diligent regard to
the effectiveness of existing structures, and their revision in light of experi-
ence and need.

The Operation of the NGO System

In addition to commenting on the UN structure, the BIC has contributed
ideas concerning the operation of the NGO system. When invited to comment
on the operation of ECOSOC Resolution 1296, which regulates the arrange-
ments for consultations between NGOs and the UN at meetings called by
ECOSOC and its subsidiary bodies, the BIC made a number of specific recom-
mendations. It noted that the resolution’s failure to consider arrangements for
NGO participation in meetings called by the General Assembly or other non-
ECOSOC entities of the United Nations System results in “a wide range of
confusing and contradictory approaches to NGO participation in non-ECOSOC
meetings” and pointed to the need for “a common framework which would
maximize the number and diversity of NGOs able to participate.”52 It suggested
that the guidelines be extended to cover NGO activities with the Commission
on Sustainable Development. The BIC recommended making a distinction be-
tween accreditation for participation in year-round consultations, and participa-

tion in ‘one or twice in a life-time conferences’, such as the “World Confer-
ences.” It encouraged distinguishing between NGOs that operate at global, na-
tional and local levels, and that operate at local levels, and suggested that this
could be accomplished by allowing local NGOs to participate in meetings of
UN Regional Commissions, regional preparatory meetings for global confer-
ences, and in the activities of Special Rapporteurs and Representatives. The
BIC also encouraged the expansion of consultative status for NGOs beyond
ECOSOC to the entire UN system, pointing out that issues of human rights are
increasingly reaching the Security Council before they reach the Commission
on Human Rights. In short, the BIC encouraged a general expansion of NGO
participation in UN deliberations.

Conclusions

This paper has summarised the contributions made by the BIC to dialogue
within the United Nations system concerning the advancement of human rights.
Over a 50-year period the BIC has monitored the progress of the rights dia-
logue closely and carefully. It has made contributions to this dialogue in a prin-
cipled and systematic manner. In other words, it has shown its commitment to
the dialogue process by being an active participant in regular sessions of the
Human Rights Commission as well as in the various special Conferences and
events that were held in the second half of the twentieth century to promote the
causes of human and social development. In addressing the issues of rights to
human and social development the BIC has drawn on the principles enunciated
in the Bahá’í Writings, and on the experience of Bahá’í communities that are
endeavouring to put these principles into practice. Ironically, part of the Bahá’í
experience has been of deprivation of the very rights that Bahá’ís champion,
particularly freedom of thought, the right to education, and to freedom of reli-
gious belief. However, at a broader level, the work of the BIC provides an
exemplary model of NGO involvement in and support for the processes of
dialogue that are advancing the practices of rights-based governance and social
responsibility for people everywhere.
