Protecting the Human Family:
Humanitarian Intervention,
International Law, and Bahá’í
Principles
BRIAN D. LEPARD

Abstract
This article explores the moral and legal problems raised by the recent experi-
ments of the world community with using some kind of military force to come
to the rescue of human rights victims—or “humanitarian intervention.” It then
examines a variety of ethical principles in the Bahá’í Writings that bear on these
problems. Finally, it investigates how these principles might assist us to discover
and implement practical measures to reform existing international law to better
protect all members of the human family.

Résumé
L’auteur explore les problèmes éthiques et juridiques découlant des récentes ten-
tatives de la communauté mondiale pour venir en aide aux victimes de violations
des droits de l’homme en ayant recours à la force militaire, dans le cadre d’inter-
ventions dites « humanitaires ». Il se penche sur divers principes éthiques énon-
cés dans les écrits bahá’ís portant sur ces questions. Enfin, il examine comment
ces principes peuvent nous aider à trouver des solutions pragmatiques pour
réformer la législation internationale actuelle afin de mieux protéger les droits de
tous les membres de la grande famille humaine.

Resumen
Este artículo sondea los problemas morales y legales surgidos a raíz de los experi-
mentos recientes de la comunidad mundial en el uso de algunas formas de fuerza
militar para llegar al rescate de víctimas de violaciones de los derechos humanos,

es decir, “intervención humanitaria.” Pasa a investigar una variedad de principios
éticos en los Escritos Bahá’ís que recaen sobre estos problemas. Por último,
explora la forma en que estos principios podrían llevarnos a descubrir e imple-
mentar medidas prácticas para reformar el derecho internacional, ayudándonos
así a mejor proteger todos los miembros de la familia humana.

As so eloquently conveyed by the theme of the 2002 Association for
Bahá’í Studies Annual Conference, long-term solutions to the many vex-
ing problems facing the world, including the problem of preventing and
ending human rights abuses, must ultimately be inspired by spiritual prin-
ciples. In its visionary statement, The Promise of World Peace, issued in
1985, the Universal House of Justice provided the following guidance:

There are spiritual principles, or what some call human values, by
> which solutions can be found for every social problem. . . . The essen-
> tial merit of spiritual principle is that it not only presents a perspec-
> tive which harmonizes with that which is immanent in human nature,
> it also induces an attitude, a dynamic, a will, an aspiration, which
> facilitate the discovery and implementation of practical measures.
> Leaders of governments and all in authority would be well ser ved in
> their efforts to solve problems if they would first seek to identify the
> principles involved and then be guided by them. (8–9)

In this paper, I will explore the moral and legal problems raised by the
recent experiments of the world community with using some kind of
military force to come to the rescue of human rights victims—what I will
refer to as “humanitarian intervention.” Next I will briefly review a vari-
ety of ethical principles in the Bahá’í Writings that bear on these prob-
lems. Finally I will offer my own perspective on how these principles
might help us discover and implement practical measures to reform exist-
ing international law so that it can help us better protect all members of
the human family.

THE MORAL PROBLEM OF PROTECTING THE HUMAN FAMILY

The last century, and even the last decade, has witnessed some of the
worst atrocities against innocent populations that the world has ever
known. In its 2000 Rid.ván Message, the Universal House of Justice
observed, in sur veying the state of the world during the Four-Year Plan
(1996–2000), that “wars fomented by religious, political, racial or tribal
conflict raged in some 40 places; sudden, total breakdown of civil order
paralyzed a number of countries; terrorism as a political weapon became
epidemic [and] a surge of international criminal networks raised alarm”
(par. 21). Genocide, war crimes, and torture have become rampant in many
parts of the globe. Also evident are often less visible, but no less insidious
and destructive, human rights violations, such as the perpetuation of
racism, which the Universal House of Justice has called “one of the most
baneful and persistent evils”; the “inordinate disparity between rich and
poor”; and the continued subjugation of women in many cultures (Promise
7–8). Furthermore, violations of the right to religious freedom are on the
rise. In this connection, the statement of the Universal House of Justice
to the world’s religious leaders issued in April 2002 refers to “the horrors
being visited upon hapless populations today by outbursts of fanaticism
that shame the name of religion” (3).

PROGRESS MADE IN THE TWENTIETH CENTURY

Despite the ubiquity of human rights violations and atrocities today, the
twentieth century saw groundbreaking efforts on the part of the interna-
tional community to institutionalize safeguards of basic human rights in
international law. More importantly, towards the end of the century, it
witnessed attempts, however sporadic, by the international community to
enforce these standards through military action in cases of shocking vio-
lations that attracted the attention of the great powers.

36            The Journal of Bahá’í Studies 13. 1/4. 2003

The Rise of International Human Rights Law

With respect to standards, the United Nations Charter, adopted in 1945,
affirmed for the first time in a multilateral treaty that all human beings
have equal rights and called upon UN members to promote and safeguard
those rights. The Universal Declaration of Human Rights, adopted by the
UN General Assembly in 1948, attempted to specify the moral rights
which all human beings, as members of one “human family,” are entitled
to enjoy. Eventually many of the rights mentioned in the Declaration
were codified in human rights treaties, which impose binding legal oblig-
ations on those states ratifying them. These treaties and conventions
multiplied in the last five decades of the twentieth century. Indeed, there
has been a veritable “explosion” in human rights lawmaking at the inter-
national level—a truly stupendous achievement in a remarkably short
period of time.

The Universal House of Justice itself has commented favorably on this
“human rights revolution.” In The Promise of World Peace it referred to
these human rights treaties and declarations and called for their wide-
spread expansion and, more importantly, “courageous” enforcement (6–7).
Furthermore, the impressive document Century of Light, written under
the supervision of the Universal House of Justice, affirms that “together
with world peace, the need for the international community to take effec-
tive steps to realize the ideals in the Universal Declaration of Human
Rights and its related covenants is an urgent challenge facing humanity
at the present moment in its history” (121).

Collective Security Action in Defense of Human Rights

Another important development during the twentieth century was the use
of UN-authorized collective military action to defend human rights vic-
tims. This development accelerated in the last decade of the century and
will come to be seen in hindsight, I believe, as one of the most important
signs of the achievement of the unity of nations as part of the process of the
Lesser Peace. It represented an attempt, however tentative, to courageously

Protecting the Human Family                       37

enforce international human rights law and make it more than a mere
paper promise. It is helpful to recount just a few examples of humanitar-
ian intervention in the last decade.1

In 1992, famine ravaged Somalia, exacerbated by civil war and the sys-
tematic looting of humanitarian relief by bandits and rival factions. With
UN authorization, the United States provided troops to protect humani-
tarian relief. The U.S.-led coalition operation was followed by a UN-com-
manded peace operation that was the first UN peacekeeping mission
authorized to use force for purposes other than the self-defense of the par-
ticipating military personnel.

Also in the early 1990s, the state of Yugoslavia disintegrated as its
republics sought independence. Ethnic groups led by cynical, prejudiced
leaders jockeyed for domination and sought to repress and even extin-
guish members of long-hated rival groups. The UN deployed a peace-
keeping force to the region but did not give it a strong mandate and mil-
itary capability suitable for the state of war and the horrific campaign of
so-called ethnic cleansing into which it was inserted. UN troops failed to
prevent many massacres, including most famously the slaughter of thou-
sands of Bosnian Muslim men and boys at Srebrenica in the summer of
1995\. In hindsight, UN officials, including Secretary-General Kofi Annan
himself, have acknowledged that the lesson of this experience is that
intervention to protect victims of such a systematic campaign of perse-
cution and extermination must be swift and forceful.

In Rwanda, in April 1994 a calculated campaign of genocide was
unleashed by Hutu leaders against the Tutsi population in that country.
The world watched in horror, but at first the UN Security Council
refused to authorize intervention. Indeed, the Security Council decided to
decrease, rather than increase, the size of the small peacekeeping force
that already happened to be stationed in the country. That inaction exact-
ed a terrible toll: in a few short months, over 800,000 Tutsis were slaugh-
tered, often in the most sadistic ways imaginable. In the last few years the
UN and many other international institutions, feeling a sense of shame
at their complacency, have soberly reflected on their behavior and con-
cluded that they should have taken more decisive and courageous action

38            The Journal of Bahá’í Studies 13. 1/4. 2003

to prevent the genocide in Rwanda, and have vowed to do better in the
future.

Perhaps in part because of this apparent vow, when the government of
Yugoslavia appeared to be launching a new campaign of ethnic cleansing
against the Albanian population of the Serb province of Kosovo in early
1999, members of NATO decided that forceful military action against that
government was required to prevent massacres on the scale so recently
witnessed in Bosnia. Because disagreement was viewed as forthcoming
from the governments of countries that wielded vetoes on the Security
Council, they did not seek Security Council authorization for such an
operation. Instead, for several months, NATO forces pounded Serbian
cities with bombs. A massive refugee crisis ensued, but eventually the gov-
ernment of Yugoslavia agreed to a UN-approved peace plan which includ-
ed the placement of Kosovo under temporary UN administration and the
deployment of a NATO-led military force in Kosovo, KFOR. Many gov-
ernments, while happy that the immediate human rights crisis was
resolved by the NATO action, felt that it was nevertheless illegal under
the Charter and may have used force excessively against civilians.

Most recently, the Security Council approved the deployment of a secu-
rity force in Afghanistan after the U.S.-led military campaign aimed at oust-
ing the terrorist al-Qaida organization from that country and installing a
new government. Many other examples of humanitarian intervention may
also be cited, including interventions in Haiti, East Timor, and Sierra
Leone.

Alongside these military experiments, the UN fostered the creation of
new international courts and tribunals to try individuals accused of geno-
cide, war crimes, or crimes against humanity. During the Yugoslav con-
flict, the Security Council created the International Criminal Tribunal for
Yugoslavia to try such crimes committed in the territory of the former
Yugoslavia. And it created a sister tribunal, the International Criminal
Tribunal for Rwanda, to try similar crimes committed as part of the
Rwanda conflict. Perhaps most importantly, in 1998 the UN facilitated the
adoption of the Statute of the International Criminal Court, the world’s
first standing international criminal court empowered to try individuals

Protecting the Human Family                        39

for gross violations of the basic norms of human dignity. The court came
into existence in July 2002.

Despite their shortcomings and failures, the experiments with humani-
tarian intervention I have mentioned reflected a new willingness on the
part of the international community to come to the rescue of those per-
sons who have experienced the most flagrant human rights abuses. In its
2000 Rid.ván message, the Universal House of Justice pointed out, per-
haps with these types of collective humanitarian interventions in mind,
that during the period 1996–2000 “attempts at implementing and elabo-
rating the methods of collective security were earnestly made, bringing to
mind one of Bahá’u’lláh’s prescriptions for maintaining peace” (par. 21).
The Universal House of Justice has likewise praised the establishment of
the International Criminal Court, noting that this action “accords with
Bahá’í expectations” (par. 21).

INTERNATIONAL LAW AND HUMANITARIAN INTERVENTION—

ADVANCES AND CHALLENGES

These moral and political developments relating to humanitarian inter-
vention have occurred within an ambiguous international legal framework
that, in turn, reflects a great deal of moral confusion about the propriety
of such intervention and the institutions that should regulate it. I will
highlight here five important legal issues.

HUMAN RIGHTS VERSUS STATE SOVEREIGNTY

First, humanitarian intervention, which necessarily involves intervention
within a sovereign state for the ostensible purpose of preventing or stop-
ping human rights violations, forces us to confront a conflict in interna-
tional law in general, and the UN Charter in particular, between human
rights and state sovereignty. Article 2, Paragraph 7 provides that nothing
in the Charter shall authorize the UN “to intervene in matters which
are essentially within the domestic jurisdiction of any State,” but goes
on to declare that “this principle shall not prejudice the application of

40            The Journal of Bahá’í Studies 13. 1/4. 2003

enforcement measures under Chapter VII.” I will refer to Chapter VII
below. However, in Articles 55 and 56, the UN Charter simultaneously
imposes duties on UN member states to take “joint and separate action in
co-operation with the Organization” for the achievement of the purpose,
among others, of promoting “universal respect for, and observance of,
human rights and fundamental freedoms for all.” As mentioned earlier,
fundamental human rights were later elaborated in the 1948 Universal
Declaration of Human Rights and have been codified in many human
rights treaties, including the International Covenant on Civil and Political
Rights, adopted in 1966. It is not clear how to reconcile this conflict
between the legal norms of sovereignty and human rights.

THE USE OF FORCE VERSUS THE PEACEFUL SETTLEMENT OF DISPUTES

Second, the practice of humanitarian intervention in the last decade brings
to the fore the legal question of whether the use of force is appropriate or
justified or whether peaceful negotiations are legally the preferred, or
indeed only permissible, way to stop civil wars and human rights atrocities.
The UN Charter in general calls for the peaceful resolution of disputes
between states (see, for example, Article 1, Pararagraph 1), and it prohibits
the use of force by one state against another, except in self-defense or as
part of Security Council-authorized collective security action, which is
provided for by Chapter VII of the Charter (see Article 2, Pargraph 4;
Articles 39–51). But collective security action under the UN Charter was
originally envisioned exclusively, or at least primarily, as a means of pro-
tecting the security of states, not people. Accordingly, international
lawyers have been sharply divided on the issue of whether the Charter
authorizes the Security Council to mandate the use of force to protect
human rights victims. Furthermore, many policy makers believe that the
use of force in the long run simply produces more conflict and more pain
for the very people such intervention is claimed to help. On the other hand,
in the cases of Bosnia and Rwanda, for example, many critics maintain that
a much more forcible response by UN peacekeepers was required in order
to forestall the orgy of bloodshed that occurred in those troubled lands.

OBLIGATIONS TO INTERVENE

Third, the new experiments with humanitarian intervention have high-
lighted the problem of whether the UN and its member states are oblig-
ated to inter vene to prevent genocide, mass killings, or other widespread
and severe violations of human rights. While the UN Charter imposes on
the Security Council an apparent duty to decide on measures necessary “to
maintain or restore international peace and security” (Article 39), it is
completely silent on the question of whether there is any kind of obliga-
tion, legal or moral, of states or the UN to intervene in the case of gross
human rights violations. And while the Charter in Article 43 obligated
member states to agree to provide contingents for collective security
action at the request of the Security Council (Article 43), this provision of
the Charter has been a dead letter. Therefore at present there is no gen-
erally recognized legal obligation to support UN-authorized humanitari-
an intervention operations.

THE SECURITY COUNCIL’S DECISION-MAKING PROCESS

Fourth, humanitarian intervention authorized by the Security Council has
raised weighty questions about its voting procedure and the method it
uses to take decisions. Any decision of the Council requires not only nine
affirmative votes out of fifteen, but no negative votes by any of the five
permanent members—China, France, Russia, the U.K., and the U. S. (see
Article 27). Thus, any single permanent member can “veto” and prevent
action by the Security Council. Vetoes or threatened vetoes have often pre-
vented Security Council action with respect to gross human rights viola-
tions, for example, in the case of Kosovo. This raises the question: Is the
veto ethically or legally justified?

Furthermore, the Security Council, as a political body, also makes deci-
sions concerning humanitarian intervention after extensive bargaining
and compromises, many of which are aimed at placating the permanent
members. But the result of such a process has been decisions that many
observers criticize as inconsistent and as biased towards the interests of

42            The Journal of Bahá’í Studies 13. 1/4. 2003

the permanent members—for example, a willingness to intervene in
Eastern Europe, but not in Africa.

THE LEGALITY OF UNAUTHORIZED INTERVENTION

Fifth, and last, the NATO intervention in Yugoslavia without the autho-
rization of the UN Security Council directly forces us to confront the
question of whether intervention without the blessing of the Security
Council can ever be legal. In this connection, Article 2, paragraph 4 of the
UN Charter prohibits the threat or use of force by any UN member state
against the political independence or territorial integrity of any other
state. Under Chapter VII of the Charter, only the Security Council can
authorize enforcement action in the case of a threat to the peace, breach
of the peace, or act of aggression, although Article 51 allows each state
to exercise a right of self-defense until the Security Council has taken
appropriate measures. Articles 52 through 54 of the Charter relate to
regional security arrangements and organizations. Article 53 provides
that “no enforcement action shall be taken under regional arrangements
or by regional agencies without the authorization of the Security Council”
(Article 53). Taken together, do these provisions prohibit humanitarian
intervention by a state or regional organization if it has not been autho-
rized by the Security Council?

How can these legal problems be resolved? Ultimately these legal ques-
tions relate to moral issues, and to fundamental spiritual values. They can
only be resolved through reference to a sophisticated framework of moral
and spiritual principles. The Bahá’í Writings can help to provide such a
framework of principles, and we can speculate on how these legal prob-
lems may be resolved in the future as these principles are gradually rec-
ognized and internalized by world leaders.

IDENTIFYING RELEVANT BAHÁ’Í PRINCIPLES

I now turn to a consideration of a number of important Bahá’í ethical and
spiritual principles that appear to be directly relevant to the legal questions

concerning humanitarian intervention that I have just identified. Many of
these principles are also reflected in the sacred scriptures of other Faiths,
as I have demonstrated in Rethinking Humanitarian Intervention.

THE UNITY OF THE HUMAN FAMILY AND RESPECT FOR DIVERSITY

The first, and most important, relevant Bahá’í principle is that of “unity
in diversity.” The pivotal teaching of Bahá’u’lláh is the fundamental unity
of humankind. Bahá’u’lláh proclaimed: “The well-being of mankind, its
peace and security, are unattainable unless and until its unity is firmly
established” (Gleanings 286).

At the same time, the Bahá’í Writings indicate the legitimacy of identi-
fication with one’s family, nation, and religious community. But they stress
that human beings morally ought to recognize, above all, their member-
ship in one human family. The Bahá’í Writings thus emphasize that the
central Bahá’í principle of the oneness of humankind “can conflict with no
legitimate allegiances, nor can it undermine essential loyalties. Its purpose
is neither to stifle the flame of a sane and intelligent patriotism in men’s
hearts, nor to abolish the system of national autonomy so essential if the
evils of excessive centralization are to be avoided. . . . Its watchword is
unity in diversity” (Shoghi Effendi, World Order 41–42).

RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS

The Bahá’í Writings also emphasize respect for the fundamental human
rights of all members of the human family, including women, as a foun-
dational ethical principle. For example, in numerous passages the Bahá’í
Writings stress the omnipresence of human rights violations by govern-
ments. In the words attributed to ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, “kings and rulers have
been able to control millions of human beings and have exercised that
dominion with the utmost despotism and tyranny” (Promulgation 276–77).
This reality must be transformed, according to the Bahá’í Writings,
through the adoption and implementation of international human rights
standards. In this connection, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá stated, quite presciently given

44            The Journal of Bahá’í Studies 13. 1/4. 2003

the later human rights revolution of the twentieth century: “Bahá’u’lláh
taught that an equal standard of human rights must be recognized and
adopted” (Promulgation 182).

TAKING ACTION TO RESPECT HUMAN RIGHTS

The Bahá’í Writings further emphasize the importance of taking action
to protect the human rights of others. For example, Bahá’u’lláh enjoined
individuals not to tolerate violations of human rights, including violations
of the rights of women: “As [the friends of God] do not allow themselves
to be the object of cruelty and transgression, in like manner they should
not allow such tyranny to visit the handmaidens of God” (Compilation of
Compilations 2:379). And he instructed all human beings to be “as a lamp
unto them that walk in darkness, a joy to the sorrowful, a sea for the
thirsty, a haven for the distressed, an upholder and defender of the victim
of oppression” (Gleanings 285).

The Bahá’í Writings also suggest the imperative of prosecuting and
punishing individuals who commit egregious assaults upon the human
rights of others, so as to protect the human community. In this connection,
‘Abdu’l-Bahá indicated that human rights violators must be dealt with just-
ly, not compassionately: “Kindness cannot be shown the tyrant, the deceiv-
er, or the thief, because, far from awakening them to the error of their ways,
it maketh them to continue in their perversity as before” (Selections 158).

A TRUST THEORY OF GOVERNMENT AND LIMITED STATE SOVEREIGNTY

The Bahá’í Writings furthermore advocate a trust theory of government
under which governments are to exercise their powers as trustees for the
benefit of the people, and a concomitant limitation of absolute state sov-
ereignty. Bahá’u’lláh called upon rulers to recognize their duty to aid the
oppressed and safeguard human rights: “For is it not your clear duty to
restrain the tyranny of the oppressor, and to deal equitably with your sub-
jects, that your high sense of justice may be fully demonstrated to all man-
kind? God hath committed into your hands the reins of the government

of the people, that ye may rule with justice over them, safeguard the
rights of the down-trodden, and punish the wrong-doers” (Gleanings 247).
‘Abdu’l-Bahá explicitly emphasized the importance of governments
ensuring “the free exercise of the individual’s rights, and the security of
his person and property” (Secret 115).

For these and other reasons, according to the Bahá’í Writings, the
world’s leaders must abandon an extreme doctrine of state sovereignty. In
the words of Shoghi Effendi: “The anarchy inherent in state sovereignty
is moving towards a climax. A world, growing to maturity, must abandon
this fetish, recognize the oneness and wholeness of human relationships,
and establish once for all the machinery that can best incarnate this fun-
damental principle of its life” (World Order 202).2

CONSULTATION

The Bahá’í Writings repeatedly stress the importance of open-minded
consultation among individuals and all social institutions as a means of
finding the truth and discovering solutions to practical and moral prob-
lems. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá described consultation as follows:

> [C]onsultation must have for its object the investigation of truth. He
> who expresses an opinion should not voice it as correct and right but
> set it forth as a contribution to the consensus of opinion, for the light
> of reality becomes apparent when two opinions coincide. . . . Before
> expressing his own views he should carefully consider the views
> already advanced by others. If he finds that a previously expressed
> opinion is more true and worthy, he should accept it immediately and
> not willfully hold to an opinion of his own. By this excellent method
> he endeavors to arrive at unity and truth. (Promulgation 72)

THE IMPORTANCE OF PEACE

Another essential ethical principle in the Bahá’í Writings is that of the
peaceful resolution of disputes. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá declared: “O ye beloved of

46            The Journal of Bahá’í Studies 13. 1/4. 2003

the Lord! In this sacred Dispensation, conflict and contention are in no
wise permitted. Every aggressor deprives himself of God’s grace” (Will
and Testament 13).

RESPECT FOR TREATIES AND INTERNATIONAL LAW

The Bahá’í Writings furthermore evidence a basic ethical principle of
respect for treaties and international law. For example, they call for the
conclusion of a binding collective security treaty, with severe sanctions
against violating states, thereby suggesting the sanctity of international
treaty obligations. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá affirmed that the sovereigns of the world
“must conclude a binding treaty and establish a covenant, the provisions
of which shall be sound, inviolable and definite. . . . In this all-embracing
Pact the limits and frontiers of each and every nation should be clearly
fixed, the principles underlying the relations of governments towards one
another definitely laid down, and all international agreements and oblig-
ations ascertained” (Secret 64–65).

The Bahá’í Writings also support the development of international law
by recommending the establishment of a world federation among inde-
pendent states in which “the autonomy of its state members and the per-
sonal freedom and initiative of the individuals that compose them are def-
initely and completely safeguarded” (Shoghi Effendi, World Order 203).
This statement indicates that one of the purposes of the federation will
be to protect human rights. This world federation will include an interna-
tional court, a democratically elected world parliament, and a world police
force (World Order 202–4). In the words of Shoghi Effendi, “A world exec-
utive, backed by an international Force, will carry out the decisions arrived
at, and apply the laws enacted by, this world legislature, and will safeguard
the organic unity of the whole commonwealth” (World Order 203).

COLLECTIVE SECURITY ACTION AND JUST WAR

At the same time that Bahá’u’lláh advocated peaceful relations among
states, he called for the implementation of a system of collective security

to deter aggression by states against one another. He exhorted world
leaders to consult on establishing

> the world’s Great Peace amongst men. . . . Should any king take up
> arms against another, all should unitedly arise and prevent him. If
> this be done, the nations of the world will no longer require any
> armaments, except for the purpose of preserving the security of their
> realms and of maintaining internal order within their territories.
> This will ensure the peace and composure of every people, govern-
> ment and nation. (Gleanings 249)

There is also some evidence in the Bahá’í Writings of support for certain
just wars undertaken by a single state, pending the establishment of a func-
tioning collective security system, as a last resort to stop an aggressor or
end civil strife that is claiming the lives of innocents. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá stated:

> [T]here are times when war becomes the powerful basis of peace, and
> ruin the very means of reconstruction. If, for example, a high-mind-
> ed sovereign marshals his troops to block the onset of the insurgent
> and the aggressor, or again, if he takes the field and distinguishes
> himself in a struggle to unify a divided state and people, if, in brief,
> he is waging war for a righteous purpose, then this seeming wrath is
> mercy itself, and this apparent tyranny the very substance of justice
> and this warfare the cornerstone of peace. Today, the task befitting
> great rulers is to establish universal peace, for in this lies the freedom
> of all peoples.” (Secret 70–71)3

HUMANITARIAN LIMITATIONS ON THE CONDUCT OF WAR

The Bahá’í Writings repeatedly condemn inhumanity and cruelty in war.4
Nevertheless, they indicate that sufficient force must be used against the
government (but apparently not the people) violating the comprehensive
and sacrosanct collective security treaty envisaged in the Writings. In the
words of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá:

48            The Journal of Bahá’í Studies 13. 1/4. 2003

> The fundamental principle underlying this solemn Pact should be so
> fixed that if any government later violate any one of its provisions, all
> the governments on earth should arise to reduce it to utter submis-
> sion, nay the human race as a whole should resolve, with every power
> at its disposal, to destroy that government. Should this greatest of all
> remedies be applied to the sick body of the world, it will assuredly
> recover from its ills and will remain eternally safe and secure. (Secret 65)

HUMANITARIAN INTERVENTION TO RESCUE HUMAN RIGHTS VICTIMS

Finally, and most directly relevant to the subject of humanitarian inter-
vention, there is evidence in the Bahá’í Writings of support for the pro-
portionate use of military force to rescue victims of extreme human
rights violations.

In this connection, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá stated: “The communities must protect
the rights of man. So if someone assaults, injures, oppresses and wounds
me, I will offer no resistance, and I will forgive him. But if a person wish-
es to assault [someone else], certainly I will prevent him” (Some Answered
Questions 271). Bahá’u’lláh, too, instructed all human beings to be “an
upholder and defender of the victim of oppression” (Gleanings 285). One
passage from the writings of Bahá’u’lláh might be interpreted as endors-
ing collective military intervention for purposes of preventing gross
human rights abuses. Bahá’u’lláh exhorted all the rulers of the earth to
unite to implement a system of collective security. In describing this sys-
tem, he affirmed: “We fain would hope that the kings and rulers of the
earth, the mirrors of the gracious and almighty name of God, may attain
unto this station, and shield mankind from the onslaught of tyranny. . . .”
(Gleanings 249).

IMPLICATIONS OF BAHÁ’Í PRINCIPLES FOR HUMANITARIAN

INTERVENTION

What are the implications of these ethical principles in the Bahá’í Writings
for humanitarian intervention and for the legal problems I identified

earlier? First, it seems clear that the Bahá’í Writings are adamant in estab-
lishing the responsibility of the entire international community to care for
and protect, through military force if necessary, all members of the human
family. They are not strictly pacifist. But the Bahá’í principle of consulta-
tion also implies that military responses to human rights violations must
be the product of careful and considered consultation among all the gov-
ernments of the world, or at least as many of them as possible, and must
not merely reflect the selfish political interests of the most powerful states.

Furthermore, we know from ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s call for a comprehensive
multilateral treaty addressing many global problems, including, we can
imagine, gross violations of human rights, that such a treaty explicitly
permitting humanitarian intervention under certain circumstances must
ultimately be negotiated. This enterprise might take the form of a revi-
sion of the UN Charter or it might involve the negotiation of an entirely
new treaty. In any case, this is a goal that we must constantly encourage
present-day governments to pursue.

With respect to some of the conflicts among principles and doctrines
evident in contemporary international law, Bahá’í ethical principles can
point the way towards solution of some of these dilemmas.

First, on the problem of reconciling the principles of state sovereignty
in the UN Charter with human rights obligations under international law,
Bahá’í principles indicate that respect for the fundamental autonomy of
states is essential, but such respect can in no wise affect the moral obliga-
tions of those states to rule justly and respect fundamental human rights.
When governments fail to fulfill their “clear duty,” in the words of
Bahá’u’lláh, to “restrain the tyranny of the oppressor” and to deal equi-
tably with their subjects, sovereignty cannot be used as a shield to excuse
them from fulfilling this duty. The legal provisions of the UN Charter
ought to be interpreted in light of these moral principles, which also are
apparent in the teachings of other religions.5

Second, on the resolution of competing principles in the UN Charter
that call, on the one hand, for the peaceful resolution of disputes, and on
the other, for effective collective security action in response to a threat to
the peace, the Bahá’í Writings clearly urge multilateral peaceful methods

50            The Journal of Bahá’í Studies 13. 1/4. 2003

of conflict resolution. They indicate that the presumption should always
be in favor of such methods, particularly those that involve genuine and
open-minded consultation with all relevant parties. But the Writings also
envisage the need for an ultimate option of a multilateral military
deployment by an international police force. We can surmise, therefore,
that in certain circumstances Bahá’í principles would endorse, as already
suggested, the multilateral measured use of force against a state as a last
resort if necessary to prevent or stop widespread and severe violations of
essential human rights. They would also endorse the establishment of a
permanent “rapid reaction force,” such as has been proposed by many
scholars and governments, including the Government of Canada, with the
capability of responding quickly to urgent human rights crises.6 But any
uses of military force to put an end to human rights violations must comply
with existing legal limits aimed at protecting civilians, both because of the
principle of respect for treaties and international law, and because such lim-
its are, according to the Bahá’í Writings, a moral imperative.

At the same time that military intervention has a place as an emergency
measure, it must be part of a multifaceted approach to human rights prob-
lems that includes judicial processes and moral education. It is clear from
the Bahá’í teachings that perpetrators of human rights atrocities must be
apprehended, prosecuted, and prevented from carrying out such unspeak-
able deeds again. It is for this reason that the Universal House of Justice
has indicated that the establishment of the new International Criminal
Court accords with Bahá’í principles and expectations. It is also evident
from the Bahá’í teachings that long-term solutions to human rights crises
must include the education of all individuals, but especially children and
youth, in the foundational principle of the unity of the human family as
well as the human rights concepts that principle entails.

Third, on the question of whether there is a legal obligation to intervene
or to contribute to humanitarian intervention operations, the Bahá’í pas-
sages I referred to earlier suggest there is at least a strong moral obligation
to come to the defense of “victims of oppression,” to use the words of
Bahá’u’lláh, by appropriate means, which may or may not warrant the use
of military assets in particular cases. It is imperative that this type of moral

obligation, which is articulated in the scriptures of other religions as well,
be universally recognized and used to guide interpretation of the legal
duties prescribed by the UN Charter and modern-day international law.

Indeed, it suggests, together with the language of the Charter, that
there may well be a legal obligation on the part of the UN to intervene in
cases involving the most flagrant human rights abuses, such as genocide.
And it suggests that Article 43 of the Charter, providing for the assembly
of national contingents under the command of the Security Council,
ought to be revived and used to constitute a rapid reaction force capable
of conducting humanitarian intervention.

Fourth, on problems relating to the Security Council’s decision-making
process, Bahá’í principles strongly indicate that the veto cannot enjoy
moral legitimacy because it grants a permanent privileged position to
some states over others and can impede effective collective action against
gross human rights abuses simply because of the self-interests of one of
the permanent members. Indeed, as long ago as 1955 the Bahá’í Inter-
national Community called for elimination of the veto (see Proposals).
Members of the Council must also be trained in the ethical principle of
consultation. They must come to see themselves as trustees for the entire
world community who must consult openly and earnestly with one anoth-
er to devise the most appropriate responses to severe human rights viola-
tions, regardless of their self-interests in the matter at hand. Too often
they have viewed their Council seat as simply another opportunity to pur-
sue “politics as usual.” Such practices undermine the legitimacy of the
Council.

Fifth, and finally, on whether uses of force for humanitarian purposes
should require the prior authorization of the UN Security Council, the
ethical principles of consultation and of human unity strongly imply the
moral desir ability of consultation among the states of the world, espe-
cially about such a morally complex issue as humanitarian intervention.
These principles suggest that, morally and legally, attempts should be
made to work through mechanisms like the UN Security Council that
states intended to be primarily responsible for international peace and
security. They imply that the apparent plain meaning of the Charter’s

52             The Journal of Bahá’í Studies 13. 1/4. 2003

legal prohibitions on nondefensive military action not authorized by the
Security Council ought to be upheld and respected. But because of the
potential for the Council to be stymied by the veto, pending the conclusion
of the comprehensive treaty foreseen in the Bahá’í Writings, it is possible
that in extreme circumstances, after exhaustive diplomatic attempts have
been made to work through the Council, individual states may be morally
entitled to respond with the minimal amount of force required to thwart
extreme human rights violations, such as genocide, even if such a
response is best viewed as illegal. Such an exception is at least implied by
the statement of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá referring to the permissibility of action in
certain cases by a “high-minded sovereign.”

CONCLUSION

I have attempted in this brief paper to give my own personal view of how
Bahá’í principles can point to changes in our understanding of existing
international law as it relates to humanitarian intervention, as well as to
long-term reforms in the international legal system’s ability to assist
human rights victims. In the long run, the countries of the world need to
reform contemporary international law so that it addresses the problem of
humanitarian inter vention and its legality explicitly in ways that accord
with Bahá’í principles. As these principles, many of which are also pro-
mulgated by the scriptures of other religions, gain wider acceptance, we
can hope that the leaders of the world will rise to the challenge and adopt
the far-reaching reforms implied by them. But we must not only hope for
this result; we must earnestly endeavor to bring it about —again, in the
words of the theme of the 2002 Annual Conference, to put spirit into
action. Our suffering brothers and sisters around the globe deserve no
less.

NOTES

A version of this paper was presented at the Annual Conference of the Association
for Bahá’í Studies, in Mississauga, Ontario, Canada, on 31 August 2002.

3. In light of all of the passages from the Bahá’í Writings quoted elsewhere in
this paper referring to the duties of rulers to protect human rights and to the pre-
vention of over-centralization, the reference to uniting a “divided state and peo-
ple” should probably be read as referring to putting an end to bloody civil wars,
not to attempts by rulers to maintain their power through oppression.
