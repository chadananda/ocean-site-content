  The Kitáb-i-Aqdas as a Lens with which to
Examine some of the Dilemmas of Modernity by

Betsy Omidvaran

Abstract
The purpose of this paper is to experiment with setting up a
dialogue between, on the one hand, the Most Holy Book of
the Bahá’í Dispensation, the ultimate source of the laws and
principles on which future society will be based and, on the
other, some of the issues and principles that arise in an
intellectual analysis of the modern world as it had evolved up
to the latter part of the nineteenth century, when the Book
first appeared. The first part starts from some of these latter
principles, that is, the role of religion, the importance of
reason and education, the development of nationalism, the
notion of freedom and the rise of democracy. The second part
looks afresh at the Most Holy Book and some relevant
principles that are not among those mentioned above, such
as Houses of Worship, universal language, financial
principles, justice, the Covenant and unity.

Introduction
This is a work-in-progress for which I have a two-item agenda.
The first is to set up a dialogue between the Kitáb-i-Aqdas, the
Most Holy Book of the Bahá’í Revelation, and the general
discussion of modernity around the time it was written, in order
to find insights about them both. The second is to defend the
centrality of religion to human progress. Even though the
general discussion on modernity has continued to the present
day, I will limit my discussion to the period from 1873 up to
the end of the Heroic Age of the Bahá’í Faith in 1921. I am
taking no position on post-modernity, which, if it exists, began
after this period, and am assuming that some elements that
postmodernist theorists identify were at least beginning to
manifest themselves earlier in the modern age.

Although there are many definitions for modernity, I am
defining it in my own way. Modernity as a term refers by its
nature to the period contemporaneous with the person using it.
It can be used at any time to refer to some current period as
opposed to some past period. The year 1873, when the Kitáb-
i-Aqdas was revealed, was modern compared to 1773, which
in turn was modern compared to 1673. Modernity at its
simplest and clearest can be defined as the specific way in
which one period is different from another. This implies an
overall view of history as constant progress rather than a
repeating cycle, which is in general the Bahá’í view.

Often the later eighteenth century is identified as the time
modernity began in earnest, although it can easily be traced
back to the fifteenth or sixteenth or seventeenth centuries. Two
major factors are the developments in philosophy emerging
from the Renaissance and the Enlightenment in Europe,
combined with the development of science, technology and
mechanisation. The French Revolution is often seen to be a
defining moment. As I am using this debate largely as a foil for
setting up my dialogue with the Kitáb-i-Aqdas and especially
as I am concentrating on literature coming from a Middle
Eastern context, where modernity is often seen to begin in
earnest with Napoleon’s invasion of Egypt in 1798, I will
accept these premises for my purpose here.

I propose to look at a few issues plucked from the rather
vigorous available treatments of the notion of modernity and
the process of modernisation. There is a huge literature on
modernity and within this literature can be found almost any
point of view, identifying a wide variety of starting points,
causes and major features. I will use these issues, which have
been chosen by arbitrary means, as a springboard to a dialogue
with the insights and standards established by the Kitáb-i-
Aqdas. I will also present a starting contribution based on the
perspective of the Aqdas and will also include some passages
from Tablets of Bahá’u’lláh Revealed After the Kitáb-i-Aqdas,
which supplements and elaborates on the laws and principles

of the former Book. The result will be the beginning of a
coherent position which takes insights from them both and a
set of questions raised by the virtual process of consultation
between them.

Themes pertaining to Modernity
It is generally agreed that the Most Holy Book was revealed by
Bahá’u’lláh in the year 1873, although other possible dates
have been discussed. The Book is very short, but it contains in
embryo all the broadest and most important principles of the
Bahá’í Revelation. The Bahá’í Faith by its definition is
modern, having come into being in the nineteenth century, and
the Most Holy Book itself is the standard, the balance by
which humanity’s immediate future course from 1873 was to
be determined:

> Weigh not the Book of God with such standards and
> sciences as are current amongst you, for the Book itself is
> the unerring Balance established amongst men. In this
> most perfect Balance whatsoever the peoples and
> kindreds of the earth possess must be weighed, while the
> measure of its weight should be tested according to its
> own standard, did ye but know it. (K99)1

The Kitáb-i-Aqdas is not a response or direct
contribution to the societal dialogue on modernity in the same
way as was The Secret of Divine Civilisation, written by
‘Abdu’l-Bahá two years later to the people of Iran. It is written
to an infinite variety of audiences simultaneously – not only
the people of that period in history, including the Bábís, the
Bahá’ís, the Muslims and all of humanity, but the same variety
of people in our time as well as the people of the latter part of
the Dispensation of Bahá’u’lláh. What I want to look at here is
how it was and is addressing the generality of humanity, in
1873 and the four to five decades after 1873. This means all of
humanity, encompassing everyone, not just those who believe

in Bahá’u’lláh’s station and Revelation: “The sincere among
His servants will regard the precepts set forth by God as the
Water of Life to the followers of every faith, and the Lamp of
wisdom and loving providence to all the denizens of earth and
heaven.” (K29) The same point is made in the Tablets of
Bahá’u’lláh with regard to the Kitáb-i-Aqdas itself: “So vast is
its range that it hath encompassed all men ere their recognition
of it.”2

This is a very broad subject and, by its nature, I will only
be able to be make a beginning. While having looked at some
other attempts to address these issues in a Bahá’í context, I will
focus on the insights to be gained from the Most Holy Book
itself. In one way, modernity encompasses everything in the
world – and probably has at some point in someone’s writings.

I started by identifying some key elements of modernity,
derived from my own perceptions and from some of the
literature, particularly that which addresses the Islamic
response to “modernity.” This has to a degree come to them
from the West in a certain form and packaged together with
colonialism and oppression. Other literature on modernity
would perforce raise other issues. These elements include the
following:

•   the role and influence of religion in society;
•   the role of individualism and the notion of freedom;
•   the rise of democracy and the decline of hereditary elites;
•   the emergence of nationalism;
•   the reliance on human reason and science, mass education

and literacy.

With these factors in mind, I looked through the Kitáb-i-
Aqdas, noting down passages which are relevant to the
elements I had pre-selected, and the results are discussed
below.

The first and most important issue is the role and
influence of religion in society. One of the main factors

identified in literature about modern history is the loosening of
the ties of religion within society. Before the Reformation,
large areas of Europe were Roman Catholic, and it was
considered that all the subjects of a king should be of one
religion. The advent of the Protestant denominations at first
strengthened the role and importance of religion, but by
introducing personal options and a concept of individual
choice, societal constraints were loosened. The French
Revolution, at the end of the eighteenth century, abolished
religion altogether, but in the end established its own. A large
number of factors tended to undermine belief in and
dependence on religion. These included the separation of
Church and State, the advance of science and opposition to it
by the Church, the supreme value placed on reason, the
advance in material well-being, the exposure to other cultures
which led people to question their own traditions and the rise
of alternative ideologies, including social sciences such as
psychology and sociology, that assumed many of religion’s
roles and aimed at understanding mechanisms within
individuals and society that constrain behaviour and uphold
moral values.

The Kitáb-i-Aqdas, like the Bahá’í Faith in general,
upholds religion as the central and necessary pillar of society,
and this is its major theme. The notion of religion and its
importance pervades the book, but I have chosen a few
passages which shed particular light on this notion, starting
with the first two paragraphs. The opening paragraph contains
the twin inseparable duties, directed at individuals, of
“recognition of Him Who is the Dayspring of His Revelation
and the Fountain of His laws” and the observance of “every
ordinance of Him Who is the Desire of the world.” (K1) This
reaffirms the place of religion in the lives of individuals.
Modern thought often accepts religion in the realm of the
individual, but questions its role in society.

The second paragraph of the Aqdas starts with the social
implications of religious belief: “They whom God hath endued

with insight will readily recognize that the precepts laid down
by God constitute the highest means for the maintenance of
order in the world and the security of its peoples.” (K2) This
states briefly and clearly the main principle which is developed
more fully in the Tablets. It specifies not only that religion is
important to society but that it is the most important way to
security. In the ninth Ishráq, Bahá’u’lláh repeats this
superlative, using the term “religion,” in relation to the
establishment of unity, the source of other social virtues which
are then specified:

> The purpose of religion as revealed from the heaven of
> God's holy Will is to establish unity and concord amongst
> the peoples of the world; make it not the cause of
> dissension and strife. The religion of God and His divine
> law are the most potent instruments and the surest of all
> means for the dawning of the light of unity amongst men.
> The progress of the world, the development of nations,
> the tranquillity of peoples, and the peace of all who
> dwell on earth are among the principles and ordinances
> of God.3

In the first Ishráq, He explains further, and enumerates the
inevitable consequences of ignoring religion: “In truth, religion
is a radiant light and an impregnable stronghold for the
protection and welfare of the peoples of the world, for the fear
of God impelleth man to hold fast to that which is good, and
shun all evil. Should the lamp of religion be obscured, chaos
and confusion will ensue, and the lights of fairness and justice,
of tranquillity and peace cease to shine. Unto this will bear
witness every man of true understanding.”4 And on the second
leaf of the Most Exalted Paradise:

> Religion is verily the chief instrument for the
> establishment of order in the world and of tranquillity
amongst its peoples. The weakening of the pillars of

religion hath strengthened the foolish and emboldened
them and made them more arrogant.5

These passages identify a number of different roles of religion
in society, that is: the stronghold for the protection of peoples
and the stronghold for their welfare; motivating good and
discouraging evil; establishing unity and concord; and
establishing order. Without religion, there is inevitably chaos
and confusion and loss of fairness, justice, tranquillity and
peace.

The second element I chose was the role of individualism
and the notion of freedom. The desire for and pursuit of
freedom has been a dominant theme of modern history. This
has been expressed in political mottoes and statements,
philosophical theories and in the economic system. An
increasingly complex society gave rise to greater potential for
individual choice, and increasing education and literacy made
people aware of increasing options and better able to take
them.

The Kitáb-i-Aqdas contains quite a strong statement on
the pitfalls of liberty. At first glance, it seems to totally
condemn liberty of any kind and could even be seen to be
advocating an authoritarian society: “We find some men
desiring liberty, and priding themselves therein. Such men are
in the depths of ignorance. Liberty must, in the end, lead to
sedition, whose flames none can quench. Thus warneth you He
Who is the Reckoner, the All-Knowing.” (K122–23) The
exhortation continues, maintaining this strong clarity
throughout. Bahá’u’lláh is speaking to a world which is
savouring the experience of freedom from previous restraint,
and which has identified freedom as a fundamental right and
goal, often even as the main prescription for prosperity and
progress. He states that this over-enthusiasm for freedom is a
fatal flaw which will corrode the social fabric:

That which beseemeth man is submission unto such
> restraints as will protect him from his own ignorance, and
> guard him against the harm of the mischief-maker. Liberty
> causeth man to overstep the bounds of propriety, and to
> infringe on the dignity of his station. It debaseth him to
> the level of extreme depravity and wickedness ... True
> liberty consisteth in man's submission unto My
> commandments, little as ye know it. Were men to observe
> that which We have sent down unto them from the
> Heaven of Revelation, they would, of a certainty, attain
> unto perfect liberty.” (K123–25)

Thus humans must submit to such restraints as will protect and
guard them and must realise their own ignorance in relation to
God’s wisdom. In certain circumstances it is appropriate, and
in others it is not. And what legitimate limitation there is on
liberty is from God, not from the various oppressors of the past,
from which people are celebrating their freedom. A large part
of all of these texts of the Aqdas is devoted to outlining what
these salubrious restraints are. The Arabic word used in the
Kitáb-i-Aqdas is hurriya.

There are several passages in the Tablets which deal with
this subject. In the Lawh-i-Dunyá, Bahá’u’lláh states:
“Mankind in its entirety must firmly adhere to whatsoever hath
been revealed and vouchsafed unto it. Then and only then will
it attain unto true liberty.”6 This echoes the meaning it has in
the Kitáb-i-Aqdas and, because the Tablet is in Persian, the
words for “true liberty” are ázádí haqíqí. Earlier in the same
Tablet the same word is used: “Thou must show forth that
which will ensure the peace and the well-being of the
miserable and the downtrodden. Gird up the loins of thine
endeavour, that perchance thou mayest release the captive from
his chains, and enable him to attain true liberty [ázádí
alone].”7 This seems to be a different meaning, made even more
clear by subsequent passages about justice and oppression.

This may be one of the circumstances in which liberty is
approved.

In another passage in the Tablets, the Lawh-i-Maqsúd,
Bahá’u’lláh says: “It is incumbent upon them who are in
authority to exercise moderation in all things. Whatsoever
passeth beyond the limits of moderation will cease to exert a
beneficial influence. Consider for instance such things as
liberty [hurriyat], civilization and the like. However much men
of understanding may favourably regard them, they will, if
carried to excess, exercise a pernicious influence upon men.”8
This seems to be saying that liberty, like civilisation, which is
regarded as something positive, exerts a beneficial influence
unless it is not exercised in moderation. It is when carried to
excess that it is pernicious.

A related matter is democracy, an expression of freedom,
and the accompanying decline of hereditary and other kinds of
elites, who were often the oppressors of the past. Before the
modern period, society and government were in the hands of
the royalty and nobility, but in the eighteenth and nineteenth
centuries this was changing. The individual had an increasing
voice in his own life and in the running of society, and the
onward march of democracy is a defining feature of modern
history. Democracy is a more complex concept than just
elections and government by the people, but this is its most
basic meaning.

There are several references in the Kitáb-i-Aqdas of
relevance to this subject. The first is the outline of the most
fundamental unit of the Bahá’í system of governance, the local
House of Justice: “The Lord hath ordained that in every city a
House of Justice be established wherein shall gather
counsellors to the number of Bahá ... It is incumbent upon
them to take counsel together and to have regard for the
interests of the servants of God, for His sake, even as they
regard their own interests, and to choose that which is meet
and seemly.” (K30) This verse does not specify that these are
elected institutions, by universal adult suffrage, but we now

know that they are. It does specify their taking counsel
together, which is also an implication of democracy. Thus, the
heart of the Bahá’í administration, the pattern of the future, is
essentially democratic.

In two passages Bahá’u’lláh refers to democratic
institutions. Speaking of Tihran, He states: “Erelong will the
state of affairs within thee be changed, and the reins of power
fall into the hands of the people ... Rest assured in the gracious
favour of thy Lord.” (K93) Here He is describing and
predicting change to democracy, without commenting on
whether it is desirable. In fact, earlier He mentions a different
turn of events, saying that God will, if it is His Will, “bless
Tihran’s throne with one who will rule with justice.” (K91) In
speaking of the importance of a universal language, He
addresses the “members of the parliaments throughout the
world” (K189), implicitly legitimising them by giving them
instructions. It would be interesting to do a survey of what
parliaments (majalis) there were in 1873.

In another passage, however, Bahá’u’lláh states: “None
must contend with those who wield authority over the people;
leave unto them that which is theirs, and direct your attention
to men’s hearts.” (K95) This may at first seem to mitigate the
approval of the democratic approach, but it does not specify
the form of the government it is referring to and how it was
constituted.

The Aqdas is full of exhortations to the kings of the
world, warning them against oppression and exhorting them to
recognise His station. In an address to the kings of the world,
He says: “Arise and serve Him Who is the Desire of all nations
Who hath created you through a word from Him, and ordained
you to be, for all time, the emblems of His sovereignty.” (K82)
The balance is made clear in Bishárát regarding republican
government and the majesty of kingship: “Although a
republican form of government profiteth all the peoples of the
world, yet the majesty of kingship is one of the signs of God.
We do not wish that the countries of the world should remain

deprived thereof. If the sagacious combine the two forms into
one, great will be their reward in the presence of God.”9

Nationalism is an aspect of modernity that developed in
parallel with other aspects. While much has been written on
the subject, a precise definition is elusive, as the phenomenon
varies markedly between different “nations.” There is nothing
in the Kitáb-i-Aqdas that I have identified that specifically
addresses the question of nations and nationalism, as there are
with my other elements. Many theorists identify a change in
nationalism in the 1880s or at least a new variety of it
alongside the older variety. The latter kind is often called
“integral nationalism” and is based on the survival of the fittest;
its paradigm was Germany in the 1930s and 1940s. The former
kind is called by a variety of names. Historian Eric Hobsbawm
says that among these theorists there was a “constant
assumption of nations as ‘second best to world unity.’”10
Building of nations was part of a natural process of expansion
– family to tribe to region to nation to globe. This is interesting
from a Bahá’í perspective, as this change was happening at the
very time Bahá’u’lláh was prescribing the next step to world
unity, a time when this step was natural and clear.

There is a passage in the Aqdas that mentions countries,
recognising their existence but not specifying a role of special
value for them. “Promote ye the development of the cities of
God and His countries [biladihi], and glorify Him therein in
the joyous accents of His well-favoured ones.” (K160)11 The
general Bahá’í concept of transcending the limitation of
nations is expressed in the sixth Ishráq: “Let not man glory in
this that he loveth his country, let him rather glory in this that
he loveth his kind.”12

One of the more commonly identified elements central to
the development of modernity is the reliance on human reason
and the advancement of science, education and literacy. This is
a subject addressed in the Aqdas: “We have permitted you to
read such sciences as are profitable unto you, not such as end
in idle disputation; better is this for you, if ye be of them that

comprehend.” (K77) Because this development has often been
opposed by established religions, there is a sense in modern
thought that reason and science are opposed to religion.

And further: “The third Tajallí: is concerning arts, crafts
and sciences. Knowledge is as wings to man’s life, and a ladder
for his ascent. Its acquisition is incumbent upon everyone. The
knowledge of such sciences, however, should be acquired as
can profit the peoples of the earth, and not those which begin
with words and end with words. Great indeed is the claim of
scientists and craftsmen on the peoples of the world.”13

An interesting passage from this standpoint is the
following injunction: “On the appearance of fearful natural
events call ye to mind the might and majesty of your Lord, He
Who heareth and seeth all, and say ‘Dominion is God’s, the
Lord of the seen and the unseen, the Lord of creation.’” (K11)
One of the characteristics of modernity is that science has
largely explained the natural events which struck fear into the
peoples of past ages, and one of the reasons for the decline of
religious belief is that science has largely replaced religion in
offering satisfactory explanations for such events. This
provision none the less acknowledges that religion still has a
part to play in helping humanity to deal with “fearful natural
events”.

Regarding literacy, this is related to a particular
technological development, the printing press, which could be
regarded as the quintessential symbol of modernity, without
which our modernity would be considerably different. In the
last half of the nineteenth century, education, literacy, and the
publication of newspapers and books were increasing
throughout Europe, North America and the Middle East. We
find the following in the Aqdas, indicating the importance of
literacy and education: “Unto every father hath been enjoined
the instruction of his son and daughter in the art of reading and
writing and in all that hath been laid down in the Holy Tablet.
He that putteth away that which is commanded unto him, the
Trustees [of the House of Justice] are then to take from him

that which is required for their instruction if he be wealthy and,
if not, the matter devolveth upon the House of Justice.” (K48)

There are also relevant passages in the Tablets, for
example, the fourth principle of the Lawh-i-Dunyá: “Everyone,
whether man or woman, should hand over to a trusted person a
portion of what he or she earneth through trade, agriculture or
other occupation, for the training and education of children
...”14

In the sixth Taráz, Bahá’u’lláh says:

> Knowledge is one of the wondrous gifts of God. It is
> incumbent upon everyone to acquire it. Such arts and
> material means as are now manifest have been achieved
> by virtue of His knowledge and wisdom which have been
> revealed in Epistles and Tablets through His Most
> Exalted Pen – a Pen out of whose treasury pearls of
> wisdom and utterance and the arts and crafts of the world
> are brought to light. In this Day the secrets of the earth
> are laid bare before the eyes of men. The pages of swiftly-
> appearing newspapers are indeed the mirror of the world.
> They reflect the deeds and the pursuits of divers peoples
> and kindreds. They both reflect them and make them
> known. They are a mirror endowed with hearing, sight
> and speech. This is an amazing and potent
> phenomenon.15

Six Further Themes
I will now mention some passages that seem to me to be
relevant to a discussion of modernity, but are not prominent in
the ongoing societal dialogue and thus did not arise in the
foregoing. These may be the most interesting of all. The
remainder of the paper will consider the dialogue from the
other side, looking at the Aqdas with fresh eyes, to consider its
vision of modernity, looking at modernity without reference to
the theorists. These are:

•   Houses of Worship;
•   a universal language;
•   financial arrangements and the economic situation;
•   justice;
•   the Covenant;
•   unity.

One point is the creation of Houses of Worship. “O people of
the world! Build ye houses of worship throughout the lands in
the name of Him Who is the Lord of all religions. Make them
as perfect as is possible in the world of being, and adorn them
with that which befitteth them, not with images and effigies.
Then, with radiance and joy, celebrate therein the praise of
your Lord, the Most Compassionate. Verily, by His
remembrance the eye is cheered and the heart is filled with
light.” (K31) The primary purpose of these Houses of Worship
is the worship of God, which will be the centre of any future
prosperous and peaceful society. Also, we now know that these
Houses of Worship will be the centre of a whole network of
social, economic and cultural institutions. These will assume a
central place in the establishment and support of a peaceful,
prosperous, fulfilling and modern society.

Another key prescription is the universal language, which
is given extraordinary precedence: “O members of parliaments
throughout the world! Select ye a single language for the use of
all on earth, and adopt ye likewise a common script. God,
verily, maketh plain for you that which shall profit you and
enable you to be independent of others. He, of a truth, is the
Most Bountiful, the All-Knowing, the All-Informed. This will
be the cause of unity, could ye but comprehend it, and the
greatest instrument for promoting harmony and civilization,
would that ye might understand!” (K189)

This injunction is developed further in subsequent
Tablets. In the third Glad-Tidings, Bahá’u’lláh states: “It
behoveth the sovereigns of the world – may God assist them –

or the ministers of the earth to take counsel together and to
adopt one of the existing languages or a new one to be taught
to children in schools throughout the world, and likewise one
script. Thus the whole earth will come to be regarded as one
country.”16

In the sixth Ishráq, Bahá’u’lláh explains that the purpose
is unity and mentions that He has enjoined the same task of
choosing one language and script on the House of Justice. “The
sixth Ishráq is union and concord amongst the children of men.
From the beginning of time the light of unity hath shed its
divine radiance upon the world, and the greatest means for the
promotion of that unity is for the peoples of the world to
understand one another’s writing and speech.”17

There are a number of provisions in the Aqdas regarding
financial arrangements and the economic situation. There are
several sources of funds for the future institutions, and they
began to be applied to Bahá'ís early in Bahá'í history, but not
to the generality of humanity:

> Should anyone acquire one hundred mithqáls of gold,
> nineteen mithqáls thereof are God’s and to be rendered
> unto Him, the Fashioner of earth and heaven ... Say: By
> this means He hath desired to purify what ye possess and
> to enable you to draw nigh unto such stations as none can
> comprehend save those whom God hath willed. (K97)

> It hath been enjoined upon you to purify your means of
> sustenance and other such things through payment of
> Zakát. (K146)

Although everyone is enjoined to make a will, in which they
can leave their possessions in any way they choose, there is
substantial detail on what will happen in cases of intestacy (see
K20–28). Shoghi Effendi has explained that a crucial principle
is that wealth should be spread widely and that its social utility
should be paramount.18 This is interesting from the standpoint

of the first part of this paper because the accumulation of
capital is identified as a crucial factor in modernity, enabling
industrialisation and investment in large projects. (K20ff)

Another important aspect of the economic situation is the
role of work, which is specified very clearly: “O people of
Bahá! It is incumbent upon each one of you to engage in some
occupation – such as a craft, a trade or the like. We have
exalted your engagement in such work to the rank of worship
of the one true God. Reflect, O people, on the grace and
blessings of your Lord, and yield Him thanks at eventide and
dawn. Waste not your hours in idleness and sloth, but occupy
yourselves with what will profit you and others.” (K33)

Another recurring theme is justice. There is a clear
prohibition of slavery, which was (and is) still common. “It is
forbidden you to trade in slaves, be they men or women. It is
not for him who is himself a servant to buy another of God’s
servants, and this hath been prohibited in His Holy Tablet.”
(K72)

In the eighth Ishráq, which is accounted as part of the
Aqdas, Bahá’u’lláh states: “O people of God! That which
traineth the world is Justice, for it is upheld by two pillars,
reward and punishment. These two pillars are the sources of
life to the world. Inasmuch as for each day there is a new
problem and for every problem an expedient solution, such
affairs should be referred to the House of Justice that the
members thereof may act according to the needs and
requirements of the time.”19

In an apostrophe to the “Rulers of America and the
Presidents of the Republics therein”, He gives them specific
instructions concerning justice: “Adorn ye the temple of
dominion with the ornament of justice and of the fear of God,
and its head with the crown of the remembrance of your Lord,
the Creator of the heavens ... O concourse of rulers! Give ear
unto that which hath been raised from the Dayspring of
Grandeur: ‘Verily, there is none other God but Me, the Lord of
Utterance, the All-Knowing.’ Bind ye the broken with the

hands of justice, and crush the oppressor who flourisheth with
the rod of the commandments of your Lord, the Ordainer, the
All-Wise.” (K88)

Because the assumption of the Aqdas is that the Bahá’í
social structure is the kernel of future global civilisation and
applies to everyone even now, a clear Covenant is crucial for
maintaining the integrity of its world-unifying system. “When
the ocean of My presence hath ebbed and the Book of My
Revelation is ended, turn your faces toward Him [‘Abdu’l-
Bahá] Whom God hath purposed, Who hath branched from
this Ancient Root.” (K121) “O people of the world! When the
Mystic Dove will have winged its flight from its Sanctuary of
Praise and sought its far-off goal, its hidden habitation, refer ye
whatsoever ye understand not in the Book to Him [‘Abdu’l-
Bahá] Who hath branched from this mighty Stock.” (K174)

The concept of unity is mentioned in a number of
contexts, including, as mentioned above, the purpose of the
universal language and the very purpose of religion. This is
specified in connection with other religions: “Consort with all
religions with amity and concord, that they may inhale from
you the sweet fragrance of God. Beware lest amidst men the
flame of foolish ignorance overpower you. All things proceed
from God and unto Him they return. He is the source of all
things and in Him all things are ended.” (K144)

In the second Taráz, this is broadened to refer to all
peoples: “They that are endued with sincerity and faithfulness
should associate with all the peoples and kindreds of the earth
with joy and radiance, inasmuch as consorting with people
hath promoted and will continue to promote unity and
concord, which in turn are conducive to the maintenance of
order in the world and to the regeneration of nations.”20

Conclusion
This paper is but one way of looking at this short but
multifaceted Book. There are infinite ways of looking at the
Kitáb-i-Aqdas and gaining different kinds of insights from it.

Each attempt should be done with the aim of expanding our
vision of it, not limiting it in any way. I have tried to make sure
that my understanding flowed from the text itself as much as
possible and not from my previous conceptions and
inclinations. I also had my own agenda of wanting to
understand something more of modernity at the end of the
nineteenth century. The paper has hopefully fulfilled its
purpose of laying a solid foundation on the basis of which
future explorations of the relationship between the Bahá’í
Faith and modernity can be made.
