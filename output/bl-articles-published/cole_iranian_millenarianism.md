IRANIAN             MILLENARIANISM                          AND       DEMOCRATIC
THOUGHT                 IN THE              19TH      CENTURY

Between 1905 and 1911, Iranians were engaged in a protracted struggle over
whether a constitutionalist regime would replace royal absolutism.' Little in Iran's
political culture before 1905 had hinted at this conflict before it broke out, and for
the past thirty years historians have been seeking this genealogy for it. Most have
searched among the papers of officials and diplomats, often examining unpub-
lished or posthumously published manuscripts with little or no contemporary cir-
culation, at least before the revolution,2 but we might get closer to its context if
we look at what was going on outside the governmental elite. Here I will explore
the growth of belief in representative government within an Iranian millenarian
movement, the Bahai faith, in the last third of the 19th century, as an example of
how the new ideas circulated that led to the conflict.3 Historians have noted a link
between millenarianism and democratic or populist thought elsewhere, after all;
for instance they have long recognized the importance of chiliastic ideas in the
English Revolution of the 17th century.4 The republicanism of American dissi-
dents and revolutionaries was also sometimes tinged with a civil millennialism.
The Bahais of Iran, too, combined democratic rhetoric with millenarian imagery
in the generation before the Constitutional Revolution.

The Bahai faith developed out of the Babi movement begun by cAli Muhammad
Shirazi, the "Bab" (1819-50) in 1844.5 Although the state and the Shicite clergy
repressed Babism, a prominent Babi, Mirza Husayn 'Ali Nuri (1817-92), known
as Bahaullah, transformed it in the 1860s and 1870s into a new religion, the Bahai
faith, which attracted thousands of new adherents. By 1900, Bahais probably
numbered between 50,000 and 100,000, in a population of 9 million.6 They had a
wide regional and class representation. A tiny remnant of Babis refused to accept
Bahaullah, and most of them followed his half-brother Azal and became known as
Azalis.

The growth of stronger states in the 19th-century Middle East, bolstered by
increased tax revenues from the spread of cash-cropping, by the influx of foreign
capital, and by better communications and transportationtechnology, contributed
to the rise of movements demanding representative government. As the state
proved able to affect the population in a much more direct way than had earlier
been the case, the groups thus affected mobilized against absolutism. The Young
Ottomans and other constitutionalists indirectly ruled Ottoman lands in the 1860s

and 1870s, and the 'Urabi movement in Egypt in 1881-82 both demanded popular
representation. Despite the tracts written by reformists calling for innovations
such as cabinet government, and despite the revolt in 1890-92 against a tobacco
concession granted by the shah to a British company, traditional historiography
does not report a popular movement for representative government in Iran until
1905\. Still, if we examine activists outside government it becomes clear that Iran
was not isolated from the Ottoman and Egyptian events of 1876-82, and I will
present evidence here of a convergence of Young Ottomanist ideas with those of
the Bahai movement. Some research on the link between millenarianism and
nationalism in Iran has been devoted to the small Azali sect of Babism, which
produced some prominent radical intellectuals in the late 19th and early 20th
century. Yet Azali intellectuals who embraced modern ideas beginning in the
1890s had often left their faith and become secularists; Browne estimated that by
1909, for every hundred Bahais there were only three or four Azalis (for a total of
2,000 to 4,000 Azalis, if our estimates for Bahais are correct).7The Bahais, so far
neglected by historians of Iranian constitutionalism, were numerically much more
significant, and, as I will show, more united at a much earlier time in support of
representative government.

Sometimes Western scholars have misconstrued Bahai attitudes in the period
from 1868 to 1892. For instance, the HungarianOrientalist Ignaz Goldziher, in an
otherwise penetrating discussion, concluded from the criticism made by Bahaullah
of aspects of hurriyya (liberty) that Bahais were not in the liberal camp8; but we
need a better understanding of what he meant by hurriyya. At all events, in the
absolutist 19th-century Middle East, as in many parts of Europe, advocacy of
representative government and of freedom of conscience was a punishable offense
under the law. One has to understand Bahaullah's thought in that context.

The policy of nonintervention in politics later adopted by Bahai leaders
beginning about 1907 has also impeded our understanding of the earlier period.
Like the 17th-century English religious dissidents, the Bahais' relationship with
the revolution itself, once it came, was complex. After supporting the
constitutionalists in 1905-7, 'Abd al-Baha' CAbbas(1844-1921), then the head of
the religion, declared his community's neutrality for the remainder of the conflict,
for several reasons. Bahais were excluded as heretics from membership in
parliament, giving them little stake in it and convincing them that it was turning
into a tool of Shicite theocracy. CAbdal-Baha', a pacifist, foresaw civil war and
foreign intervention should the revolution continue, and could abide neither
prospect. Some Bahais continued to fight for the revolution, and, in any case, the
neutrality of the community differed from the actively proroyalist stance of most
Shicite clergymen and their followers. Even 'Abd al-Baha' himself remained
convinced that his father, Bahaullah, had prophesied the revolution and
constitution.9 All this is a bit moot here, since I am concerned in this essay
primarily with the development of Bahai ideas on democracy in the period up to
Bahaullah's death in 1892.

I want to explore, then, the circumstances under which the Bahai prophet
Bahaullah developed a commitment to representative government in the decades
before the revolution and to discover whether Bahaullah's social teachings and his

Iranian Millenarianism and Democratic Thought 3

religious ones are related in some way. Can we link his precocious advocacy of
democracy and his millenarian ideas? He saw himself, after all, as a universal
messiah-the promised one of the Jews, the symbolic return of Christ for
Christians and Muslims, and the Shah-Bahram of the Zoroastrians. His advent
would surely turn the world upside down. Was the coming of a more egalitarian
society one manner in which the prevailing order would be upset? Democracy,
after all, would represent a massive change for so hierarchical a society as Qajar
Iran.'0What were the Bahais' relations with other dissident groups in the Ottoman
Empire and Iran that sought democracy or other reforms? Were they really the
quietists the secondary literature would lead us to expect in the period 1868-92,
or did they form part of the "dissident milieu" in the Middle East? How did the
Bahais react to this constitutionalist message? That Bahaullah's writings circulated
in manuscript and in some printed editions throughout Iran during his lifetime,
and were read and memorized by tens of thousands of Bahais, is beyond doubt.
The few reactions I have found suggest that Bahais read Bahaullah in several
ways, both in a liberal fashion and in a more radical one, though all agreed on the
desirability of representative government. In what way did Bahaullah's message
manage to hold together this diverse Bahai community back in Iran, with its
impatient artisans, its visionary intellectuals, its staid import-export merchants?

THE   RISE   OF   THE   BAHAI   RELIGION

The roots of the Bahai faith lay in the esoteric and millenarian Shaykhi movement
in Shicite Islam, and in the subsequent adventist Babi movement,'1 but it had other
cultural roots as well. Bahaullah's exile to Iraq (1853-63), to Rumelia (1863-68),
and finally to Palestine (1868-92) in the Ottoman Empire brought him into direct
contact with the debate on modernist reform in Ottoman lands. He responded to
the concerns of the Turkish and Arabic press and had contact with reformist think-
ers and officials. He communicated the concerns he developed in this Ottoman
context to the esotericist and underground Babi community back in Iran, where
such public debate was proscribed. The interaction between Iranian millenarian-
ism, Ottoman and Qajar reformism, and European modernity formed the context
of the new religion's social teachings.

The Iranianstate and the Shicite clergy joined forces to put down the millenarian
Babi movement founded by Sayyid 'Ali MuhammadShirazi in the 1840s. After the
Bab's execution, and a Babi attempt on the life of the shah, the state subjected the
community to a country-wide pogrom. The Nuri brothers, from a noble family,
emerged as the focus of loyalty among the disheartened Babis of the 1850s. Mirza
Buzurg Nuri had been a high functionary under Fath-'Ali Shah (r. 1798-1834),
with close links to the first minister, Abu al-Qasim Qa'im-maqam. Muhammad
Shah (r. 1834-48) dismissed several of Fath-CAli'sclose courtiers, had Qa'im-
maqam killed, and deprived Mirza Buzurg, the governor of Luristan, of his office.
Mirza Husayn 'Ali Nuri, one of Mirza Buzurg's sons, later became a Babi in 1844,
followed by his younger brothers, Mirza Musa and Mirza Yahya (then aged 14;
later he took the title "Subh-i Azal"), and some of his sisters.'2 The elder Nuri
brother, Mirza Husayn cAli, known as Bahaullah, was found innocent of any crimes

by the state but was exiled from Iran to Baghdad early in 1853. His younger
brother, Azal, whom most Babis looked to as the religion's new leader, joined
Bahaullah there.

The complex relationship between the two brothers is controversial and not
relevant here; suffice it to say that they gradually fell out with one another. From
Baghdad, Bahaullah sent letters and other writings back to Iran that, by their
mystical sensitivity and stress on spiritual ethics, attractedmany Babis to a special
loyalty to him, though he publicly supported Azal's position. Iranian officials,
alarmed at Bahaullah's growing influence, put pressure on the Ottomans to exile
him to a place less accessible to Iran than Baghdad was. The Ottoman authorities
acquiesced; in the spring of 1863 they ordered Bahaullah to come to Istanbul. In
April 1863, just before his journey to the Ottoman capital, Bahaullah declared
himself to a handful of close disciples as "he whom God shall make manifest"
(man yuzhiruhu Allah), a further messianic figure whose advent the Bab had
foretold.

No sooner had Bahaullah and his followers arrived in Istanbul than Sultan
Abdiilaziz (r. 1861-76), bowing to further Iranian pressure, exiled him to Edirne
in Rumelia. Bahaullah at first refused to obey the command, suggesting that the
Babis in his household refuse to give him up, which would result either in their
martyrdom or in overturning the sultan's decree. Azal and others refused to go
along with this plan and, since it required unanimity to succeed, it fell through.
This incident shows Bahaullah's willingness to oppose the state when he felt it
was acting unjustly.'3

Bahaullah and a few other Babis, including Azal, lived in Edirne until the
summer of 1868. From 1864 Bahaullah began sending letters back to Iran
informing a few trusted friends of his advent as the Babi promised one, and his
charisma was sufficient to bring the vast majority of Babis over to his side in the
space of a few years. In 1867 Bahaullah and Azal broke off relations. Bahaullah's
emissaries gained adherents in important Babi communities like those of Shiraz
and Isfahan among influential merchant or Sayyid elites such as the Afnans and
the Nahris. The adoption of the new faith by provincial urban notables who had a
power base independent of the state and the clergy proved extremely importantfor
its survival and spread, as did the response of the demographically more
significant artisans and workers.14 The swiftness with which Bahaullah attractedto
himself tens of thousands of adherents was remarkable, though he surely built on
networks of influence he had established from Baghdad in the 1850s and 1860s.
Although his initial appeal to the Babis was entirely charismatic, he went on to
consolidate his position as the head of a new religion by defining its relationship
to the state and setting down a set of ethical principles as well as a new "social
gospel."

THE   EPISTLES   TO   THE   RULERS

After putting himself forward to the Babis as a Manifestation of God, Bahaullah
began writing letters to the world's major rulers. He declared himself the fulfill-
ment, not only of millenarian hopes in Islam and Babism, but also in Christianity,

Iranian Millenarianism and Democratic Thought 5

Zoroastrianism, and other traditions. This millenarian teaching was combined with
a specific program of national and international reform aimed, first of all, at pre-
venting wars and reducing war budgets and taxes. From about 1868, Bahaullah be-
gan advocating parliamentarygovernment, a radical idea in the absolutist Middle
East.

In an unguarded moment in January of 1866, Ottoman Foreign Minister Ali
Pasha had confessed to the Austrian ambassador that Bahaullah, then in exile in
Edirne, was "a man of great distinction, exemplary conduct, great moderation, and
a most dignified figure" and spoke of Babism as "a doctrine which is worthy of
high esteem."15He said that he still found the religion politically unacceptable
because it refused to recognize a separation of religious and temporal authority.
Ali Pasha (1815-71) and his colleague Fuat Pasha (1815-69) had been at the
forefront in promoting and implementing the 1856 reform laws (Tanzimat) of the
Ottoman Empire, which made Jews and Christians equal to Muslims under law
and established the secular conception of "Ottomanism"as the basis for a political
loyalty for all subjects of the sultan.16 These reforms dethroned Islam as the
foundation of the Ottoman state, and from the reformers' point of view a
messianic movement such as Babism, whatever its virtues, threatened such
achievements by seeking to put all authority, religious and secular, back in the
hands of a charismatic spiritual leader.

Although Ali Pasha may have been right about Babism, he missed the mark
regarding Bahaullah's own ideas, which were more compatible with the Tanzimat
than he thought. In 1866 Bahaullah produced a wide-ranging statement, entitled
Surat al-Muluik(Chapter of the Kings), addressing in a general way the planet's
political and religious leaders. Starting in 1868, he wrote letters to the rulers of
the world-including Napoleon III, Queen Victoria, the Tsar of Russia, the Pope,
Sultan Abdulaziz, and Nasir al-Din Shah of Iran-in which he announced himself
as the promised one of all religions and set forth the necessary global and national
reforms he foresaw.'7 Ironically, a major theme of the epistles to the Muslim
rulers was the acceptance in the new Bahai religion of a separation of religion and
state, the legitimacy of the secular state, and the abstention of Bahais from violent
sedition.

In the Chapter of the Kings Bahaullah declared that he had not come to destroy
Ottoman lands, but to elevate the cause of the sultan by giving him good
counsel-advice that his ministers and courtiers had spurned.'8 In his long letter
from Edirne to Nasir al-Din Shah (r. 1848-96) in 1868, Bahaullah proclaimed that
the sedition of certain ignorant Babis had never been approved by him and that the
community, in becoming Bahais, had ceased to be responsible for unrest in Iran.19
Bahaullah here made public his complete break with Babi radicalism and violent
agitation. Still, he did not offer to give way on any matters of principle and
continued to advocate reforms at variance with state policy. He desired, by
recognizing the legitimacy of the secular state, to achieve the position of spiritual
counselor for it. Historian Mangol Bayat has pointed out that Bahaullah's policy in
this regard "embraced what no Muslim sect, no Muslim school of thought ever
succeeded in or dared to try: the doctrinal acceptance of the de facto secularization
of politics which had occurred in the Muslim world centuries earlier."20

Bahaullah's attitudes, in accepting the equality of all religious communities
under the state, were thus not so far removed from those of the Tanzimat
reformers of Istanbul after all. Bahaullah's first invocation of the need for
consultation in government, as opposed to unadorned absolutism, comes in his
Edirne period, when he advised the sultan to gather together his ablest ministers
and consult with them (shawara) on affairs. He also castigated Abdiilaziz for
allowing his subjects to live in squalor while high functionaries lived opulently.21
His advocacy of ministerial consultation may have been innocuous advice, but
"consultation" often appears in this period as a reformist codeword, accepted by
the state because of its classical connotations of mere counsel. Even the Young
Ottomans, who wanted a full-blown parliamentarysystem, a very radical and quite
illegal idea, referred to it as me?veret, "consultation," a Turkish word from the
same Arabic root.

By exiling Bahaullah and the other Iranians from Edirne in the summer of 1868,
Sultan Abdulaziz pushed the Bahai leader into openly condemning the tyranny of
absolutism and advocating parliamentary democracy. Azali complaints against
Bahaullah provoked a general inquiry into the activities of the Iranians in Edirne,
and the Ottoman commission concluded that, while Bahaullah had a right to
complain about Azal and his supporters, he was making a messianic claim and
spreading his message in a way that might provoke turmoil in the empire. Iranian
pressure probably also played a major role in the decision to banish the Bahais
and Azalis to yet more isolated places. Ottoman officials exiled Bahaullah and his
entourage from Edirne to Acre on the coast of Ottoman Syria, where he spent the
rest of his life. At the same time, they sent Azal to Cyprus.22 Ironically,
Bahaullah's exile proved fortunate, because it placed him in the Holy Land near
Jerusalem and lent the weight of sacred geography to his messianic claims.

Bahaullah was furious over the Ottoman government's decision to exile him to
the pestiferous fortress of Acre. He branded Sultan Abduiilaziz a tyrant and
predicted that social unrest and division would soon overtake the empire. In a
letter concerning Ottoman Foreign Minister Fuat Pasha, one of those who exiled
him, who died in Nice of heart trouble early in 1869, Bahaullah wrote, "Soon will
We dismiss the one [Ali Pasha] who was like unto him, and will lay hold on their
Chief [the sultan] who ruleth the land."23He continued his proclamation to the
rulers of the world upon his arrival in Palestine in the summer of 1868, but,
perhaps because of his bad experience with the reformers-from-above of the
Tanzimat type, his social message took an increasingly radical-reformistturn. The
new program placed the Bahais somewhat in the same camp as progressive
Ottoman dissidents for whom the Tanzimat reforms had not gone far enough.

Later in the same year Bahaullah went much further than advocating ministerial
consultation and began praising parliamentary government. Iranian travelers had
described the British parliament to their readers back home for over a century, so
well-read Iranians knew something about representative government.24The Bahai
turn in this direction converged with several other dissident movements of the
time. A group of intellectuals, mainly translators and journalists, began a secret
society called the Patriotic Alliance in Istanbul in 1865, which criticized Ali Pasha
and Fuat Pasha for subservience to the European Powers and for ruling

Iranian Millenarianism and Democratic Thought 7

autocratically. A high official from the viceregal family of Egypt, Mustafa Fazil
Pasha, then out of power, published an open letter to the sultan in 1866,
denouncing corruption and pleading for political liberalization. In the same year
his brother, Ismail Pasha, created a Chamber of Deputies in the Ottoman vassal
state of Egypt, though this advisory body was hardly a parliament. In 1867,
Mustafa Fazil met with the young intellectuals to form the Young Ottoman
Society, which decided to publish its newspaper, the Muhbir, from London to
avoid censorship. From August 31, 1867, the editor, Ali Suavi, openly advocated
the establishment of a national representative body, the exclusion of foreign
influence from the Ottoman Empire, and reform along Islamic and Ottoman
lines.25 About a year later, in June of 1868, another expatriate liberal newspaper
was begun by Namik Kemal, also a Young Ottoman. These newspapers, smuggled
back into the Ottoman Empire, apparently enjoyed a wide circulation. Reform-
minded Iranianexpatriates in Istanbul, such as Mirza Malkum Khan (1833-1908),
were in contact with the Young Ottomans and wrote for the London-based
newspapers. Malkum had once sought refuge with Bahaullah in Baghdad from the
wrath of the shah, and probably knew Bahais in Istanbul.26The Young Ottoman
movement exercised a general influence on Iranian thinkers resident in Istanbul,
including Iranian Ambassador Mirza Husayn Khan Mushir al-Dawla himself.27

Bahaullah's stance differed from that of the Young Ottomans, not only in his
lack of faith in clerical jurisprudence as the solution to all ills, but also in his
millenarianism. Bahaullah repeatedly linked chiliastic concerns with democratic
themes, showing the way in which he saw his advent as a world messiah to have
turned the world upside down. He melded four themes together in his epistles to
the rulers. First, he announced himself as the fulfillment of the millenarian hopes
of all the world religions. Second, he expressed his advocacy of political
democracy both directly and through apocalyptic imagery. Third, he insisted that
it was the duty of the state to care for the poor and to provide them with essential
services. He linked this principle to his fourth, the need for a form of world
governance. He believed that there would be much smaller military budgets and
reduced taxes on the poor if the world's major states would form a global political
union based upon the principle of collective security.

Bahaullah's letter to Queen Victoria, written in the fall of 1868 soon after his
banishment to Acre, combines all four of these themes in one letter. He began by
proclaiming himself, in essence, the spiritual return of Christ: "All that hath been
mentioned in the Gospel hath been fulfilled. The land of Syria hath been honoured
by the footsteps of its Lord."28What are the social consequences, in his view, of
this advent? We may surmise them from his concentration on social reforms of an
egalitarian nature. He singled out Queen Victoria for praise on two counts. He first
commended her for abolishing slavery, saying it was also forbidden in his
religion. (It was still practiced in most of the Middle East.) Second, he
congratulated her on having "entrusted the reins of counsel into the hands of the
people (awdacti zimdm al-mushdwara bi-ayadi al-jumhuir)."29He added, "Thou,
indeed, hast done well, for thereby the foundations of the edifice of thine affairs
will be strengthened, and the hearts of all that are beneath thy shadow, whether
high or low, will be tranquillized."

Although Bahaullah spoke only of the "counsel" offered to the queen by the
people, he clearly was using the word in the new sense of representative
government. But what had Queen Victoria done to warrant this praise? She had
hardly initiated the British parliamentarysystem. The reference must have been to
the Reform Act of 1867, which extended the franchise to many urban union
workers. In the new, postadvent world, he was saying, the voice of the ordinary
folk would be heard in the halls of state. Although jumhur could be used in
several ways in Arabic in the 1860s, the word had connotations of what we would
now call democracy. A writer of the time could use it as an abstract noun to
denote "democracy" or "republicanism," but could also employ it to refer to a
concrete republic or democratic country. Such words remained fluid in the 19th
century. Bahaullah seems to have used the word jumhur here in its older sense of
"the populace," making it clear that he was not speaking of oligarchy.30That he
intended by the word mushawara or "consultation" a representative form of
government is made even clearer by his subsequent discussion of the duties of
members of parliament (al-majma', or al-majlis).

In the epistle to Queen Victoria, Bahaullah called upon members of parliament
in Britain and elsewhere to rise up and reform world society and cure its ills. The
best remedy, he said, is global unity through the adoption of a single world
religion. During the tense period leading up to the Franco-Prussian War, he called
upon the world's rulers to establish peace and to cease their ruinous military build-
up, which they were paying for through onerous taxes on the poor. He stigmatized
such actions as "a heinous wrong," and urged lower, bearable taxes, saying that if
these rulers established peace, they would not need such huge war budgets. He
called for a system of collective security, such that if any nation transgresses
against another, all the others would attack and defeat the aggressor. Bahaullah
evinced a strong concern for the welfare of the poor and working classes, whom
he thought grossly over-taxed and exploited. He proposed a reduction in levies
and the implementation of social welfare measures through the savings that would
accrue from disarmament. Despite his political liberalism, he was no advocate of
laissez-faire, and he obviously felt that the poor had a right to food, shelter, and
education just as they had a right to representative government.

Bahaullah's views on other Western forms of government sometimes differed
starkly from his attitude toward Britain's. He disapproved of Napoleon III, partially
because this ruler had neglected to respond through the French consuls to his letter
announcing himself as the world messiah and asking the French to put pressure on
the Ottomans to stop their persecution of the Bahais. In 1869, in a second missive
to the emperor, Bahaullah taunted him for boasting of his compassion toward the
oppressed when he joined the Crimean War against the Russians. Napoleon's
indifference to the plight of the Bahais, he said, showed the falsity of that boast.
Bahaullah added, "For what thou hast done, thy kingdom shall be thrown into
confusion, and thine empire shall pass from thy hands, as a punishment for what
thou hast wrought."31Of course, Napoleon III went down to defeat before the
Prussians at Sedan only a year later, an event that much added to Bahaullah's
prophetic charisma among Iranians who had read the 1869 letter to the emperor.
Later, in 1873, Bahaullah apostrophized Kaiser Wilhelm I in his al-Kitaibal-Aqdas

Iranian Millenarianism and Democratic Thought 9

(Most Holy Book), warning him that the same fate could befall him that had been
inflicted on Napoleon. He added, "O banks of the Rhine! We have seen you
covered with gore, inasmuch as the swords of retribution were drawn against you;

> and you shall have another turn. And We hear the lamentations of Berlin, though
> she be today in conspicuous glory."32The Kaiser offended Bahaullah, not through
hostility or indifference toward the Bahai faith, as "Napoleon the Little" had done,
but on account of his militaristic pride.

In the same work Bahaullah addressed "Tehran" (i.e., Iran) predicting that
"affairs within you will undergo a revolution, and you will be ruled by a
democracy of the people" (sawfa tanqalibu fiki al-umiiurwa-yahkumu Calayki
jumhiir min al-nas).33 In his letter five years earlier to Queen Victoria, Bahaullah
had commended the parliamentary form of government, but here he went even
further and talked of popular sovereignty. The word he used for "the people," al-
niis, indicates the ordinary people and suggests that he had a genuine democracy
in mind, not a parliamentaryoligarchy.

Bahaullah appears, then, to have saved his dire predictions and apocalyptic
imagery for undemocratic states (Napoleon and Bismarck handily outmaneuvered
their so-called legislatures) that showed the least interest in protecting freedom of
conscience for the Bahais in the Middle East. Although he apostrophized the
presidents of the republics in America in his Most Holy Book, as with Britain,
Bahaullah made no predictions about the American republics; he simply hoped
they would prove just toward the oppressed.34His letter to Tsar Alexander II is not
as approving as one might expect, given that the Russians gave some aid to
Bahaullah when he was imprisoned in 1852 (his brother-in-law was employed in
the Russian legation in Tehran). Although he expressed his gratitude, Bahaullah
warned the tsar, "Beware lest ye barter away this sublime station."35

In general, Bahaullah reserved praise for constitutional monarchies and
republics, and foresaw toppled thrones and rivers of blood in the Bonapartist or
absolutist states of imperial France, Prussia, the Ottoman Empire, and Iran. These
changes, in his view, were intimately connected with his own messianic advent.
He wrote in 1873, "The world order has been upset through the influence of this
most great Order (al-nazm al-aczam). A change has been introduced into its
organization [al-tartib] through this unprecedented [system]-the like of which
mortal eyes have never witnessed."36 I take this passage to suggest that the
messianic advent not only turns the world upside down spiritually, but politically
as well. The Arabic word al-tartib could also bear the meaning of "constitution"
in the 19th century, so that in the original this passage may have had connotations
for readers of constitutional change.37

Soon after his arrival in Acre Bahaullah wrote a letter to Shaykh Salman, a
follower in Iran, in which he said, "One of the signs of the maturity of the world
is that no one will accept to bear the weight of kingship. Kingship will remain
with none willing to bear alone its weight. That day will be the day whereon
wisdom [Caql] will be manifested among mankind. Only in order to proclaim the
Cause of God and spread abroad his faith will anyone be willing to bear this
grievous weight."38 This passage shows that Bahaullah unequivocally thought
royal absolutism would completely die out, and he here gave only two conditions

for the survival of monarchy in any form. The first was that the monarch share the
burden of governing with others ratherthan attempting it all alone (wahdahu); the
other was that the monarch become a Bahai and employ his or her office to spread
the new religion. Like the epistle to Queen Victoria, this passage assumes that the
only good monarchy is a constitutional one.

Although he framed his views in an apocalyptic style, Bahaullah's writings of
the late 1860s and early 1870s brought the nascent Bahai movement into the
mainstream of modernist liberalism in the Middle East. On each essential social
question-restrictions on monarchy, representative government, and the abolition
of slavery-his position was similar to that of liberals such as the Young
Ottomans and Midhat Pasha, though he lacked the Young Ottomans' faith in
traditional Islam as a bulwark against tyranny. In Ottoman terms, in the late 1860s
and early 1870s, Bahaullah stood on the far left with Namik Kemal. In Iranian
terms his forthright championing of parliamentary government was matched at
that time perhaps only by the Azerbaijani translator, Fath-'Ali Akhundzada, who
resided in tsarist Tiflis. Bahaullah called for the kind of limits on the shah's
absolute power that went far beyond the program of reformers such as Mirza
Husayn Khan, who merely advocated cabinet government. In the late 1860s and
early 1870s, these Bahai stances posed a radical challenge for the royal-absolutist
regimes.

THE   BAHAIS,   THE   YOUNG   OTTOMANS,   AND   IRANIAN   REFORM

Clearer connections can be drawn in the 1870s between the Bahais and Middle
Eastern reform movements, whether the Young Ottomans or the administrative in-
novators in Iran. These relationships took the form of actual meetings, as well as
Bahai writings that respond to this decade of change. The Bahai leaders now made
more explicit the sort of society they wished to see in the Middle East, moving
from apocalyptic vision to rational exposition. I am not so much interested here in
demonstrating an influence of one movement on another as in pointing to the in-
tertextuality of reformist thought in this period, of the ways in which some ideas
were "in the air."

In the early 1870s, the Young Ottoman expatriates came home from exile, after
the death in 1871 of First Minister Ali Pasha, their chief nemesis. In 1873,
however, the sultan banished several Young Ottomans to provincial prisons, partly
because of their close links with the impatient heir apparent Murad Pasha. The
state exiled Namik Kemal to Cyprus, Ebiizziya Tevfik to Rhodes, and Nuri Bey
and Hakki Efendi to Acre. During their exile, they certainly came into contact,
and interacted intellectually, with the Bahais. Ebiizziya mentioned the earlier
banishment of the Bahais, whom he referred to as Babis, from Istanbul to Acre via
Rhodes (his own place of exile). He took their side, seeing their imprisonment in
the fortress as a result of foreign (Iranian) interference in internal Ottoman affairs,
of which he took a dim view. He defended the Bahais from the Ottoman charge of
proselytizing within the empire, and although he accepted "Babism" as a
"religious belief," he thought the core of the movement a political doctrine
clothed in religious garb. It was, he said, "interested in revolutionary activity

solely in Iran." He ended by noting that the first news to reach him from Acre
about his fellow Young Ottomans, Nuri Bey and Ismail Hakki Efendi, came
through the "demonstrated humanity of an individual . . . called Bahaeddin
Efendi" who was himself a "Babi."39He was certainly referring to Bahaullah,
whose name outsiders often confused with the more common "Baha' al-Din."

Namik Kemal, sent to Cyprus, had more contact with Azalis than with Bahais,
though he developed a friendship with the Bahai Mishkin Qalam, whom the
Ottomans had perversely sent to the island with the Azalis. One of his closest
companions in exile was Shaykh Ahmet Efendi, hero of the Kuleli uprising, who
had adopted Babism or the Bahai faith in his Cyprus exile. By 1876, the year of
his release, Namik Kemal was forced to deny rumors circulating in Istanbul that
he had become a "Babi."40Namik Kemal corresponded extensively with CAbdal-
Baha', Bahaullah's son, though the Bahai leader later burned the letters for fear of
Ottoman searches.41The relationship between the Bahais and the Young Ottomans
Nuri Bey and Hakki Efendi in Acre was clearly very warm, and Hakki Efendi
paints a vivid picture of the Bahais as cosmopolitan intellectuals who had their
children tutored in European languages and took a keen interest in the
international press.42 Since the Young Ottomans and the Bahais had the same
enemies high in the Ottoman state and since they shared many ideals, they viewed
one another sympathetically. When the reformer Midhat Pasha (a sometime patron
of the Young Ottomans) became governor of Syria in 1878-80, he called
Bahaullah's eldest son CAbdal-Baha' to Beirut for a meeting.43Bahai contacts with
Ottoman dissidents continued even after the government's turn to reaction in the
1880s. Abdullah Cevdet, one of the five founding members of the Young Turk
movement, at some point became a Bahai and was tried for heresy in this
connection in the early 1920s.44

The Bahais were active, not only in the Ottoman Empire, but also in Iran, where
there was political ferment in the early 1870s. The diplomat Mirza Husayn Khan
Mushir al-Dawla returned to Tehran from Istanbul to become first minister in
1871, and, influenced by Ottoman reforms, he attempted to work out a system of
cabinet government with Nasir al-Din Shah. He made the mistake, however, of
seeking to develop Iran's economy and resources by granting a huge concession to
Baron Julius de Reuter, a British subject. This unwise move aroused the
opposition of merchants, intellectuals, some ulama, and of the Russians, and the
whole scheme had to be canceled. The fiasco, along with Nasir al-Din's
unwillingness to share any power with his cabinet, led to Mirza Husayn Khan's
demotion to foreign minister in 1873.45 This event convinced the Azerbayjani
secularist, Akhundzada (d. 1878), a translator for the tsarist viceroy of the
Caucasus, that Iranians could not implement French-style constitutionalism until
the masses were educated.46

Although as Iranian ambassador to Istanbul Mirza Husayn Khan showed great
enmity to the Bahais up to 1868, he later changed his mind about them and once
let a Bahai courier caught at Aleppo go free. In the early 1870s, Bahaullah
quizzed one visitor from Iran about the behavior of Mirza Husayn Khan and
described the reformer as "wiser than the rest" (a'qal az sd'irin) of Iranian
politicians.47 CAbd al-Baha', Bahaullah's eldest son, responded much more

hopefully to the Iranian reformism of the 1870s than did Akhundzada, writing a
Persian book in Palestine in 1875 known in English as The Secret of Divine
Civilization, which he published in Bombay in 1882.48CAbdal-Baha' argued for a
limitation on the absolute power of government officials, the establishment of
representative, elected governmental institutions, the relieving of the poverty of
the masses, the improvement of the country's infrastructure, the setting up of a
modern school system, and the systematization of Iran's secular and religious laws
and legal systems. He also advocated global disarmamentand the establishment of
a union of the nations, and the renewal of religion to combat modern atheism. The
program CAbdal-Baha' laid out not only concurs at many points with the ideas of
the Young Ottomans-some of whom were also in exile in Acre while he was
writing this book-but also has something in common with those of Iranian
reformers such as Akhundzada, the diplomat Yusuf Khan, and the official Mirza
Muhammad Husayn Khan Dabir al-Mulk, and needs to be studied in that
context.49It is strange that so far the scholarly literature has entirely ignored the
Risala-'i madaniyyat, since CAbdal-Baha"'s book was printed and distributed
throughout Iran from Bombay, and it had an earlier, wider public than most better-
studied reformist writings. CAbdal-Baha"'s emphasis on relieving poverty, on
peace, and on some form of international union distinguished his Bahai program,
as did his deep mistrust of European militarism. We know little about how the
Bahai message of representative government and the rule of law was received in
Iran. Yet such social teachings must have been among the attractions of the new
religion, and help to explain its growth.

Throughout the late 1860s and early 1870s, the Young Ottoman thinkers had
spread ideas of modern representative government. The constitutionalist forces
grew in strength in Ottoman lands, and in 1876 they overthrew Sultan Abdiilaziz
and, after the brief reign of the deranged Murad V, they installed the young
Abdiilhamid as sultan. Reformers such as Midhat Pasha imposed a constitution
and a parliament on the inexperienced young monarch. The first Ottoman
parliament was elected and met in 1877.50 In a chain reaction, this movement
helped provoke a similar struggle for parliamentary government in the Ottoman
vassal state of Egypt, where the Khedive Ismail had shunted aside his Chamber of
Delegates. CAbdal-Baha' followed the Egyptian constitutionalist press, such as the
newspaper Misr and penned a letter to one of its contributors, the expatriate
Iranian Sayyid Jamal al-Din Asadabadi "al-Afghani." He wrote, "I read your
splendid article printed in the newspaper Misr, which refuted some English
newspapers. I found your replies in accord with prevailing reality, and your
eloquence aided by brilliant proof. Then I came across a treatise by Midhat Pasa,
the contents of which support your correct and magnificent article. So, I wanted to
send it along to you."5 The letter reveals 'Abd al-Baha' as a widely read
intellectual with a brief against Western imperialism, who attempted to establish
connections among reformists like Sayyid Jamal al-Din and Midhat Pasha and
implicitly between them and the Bahais. Sayyid Jamal al-Din appears in the late
1870s to have had a positive view of Babism, and under his influence the
Lebanese journalist Adib Ishaq classed the Babi movement with the French

Revolution, European socialism, and the Ottoman constitutional revolution of
1876 as an exemplar of the struggle for liberty.52

The success of the republicans in France in 1871 raised new questions for
Middle Eastern reformers. In his Bishardt (Glad Tidings), Bahaullah preferred
constitutional monarchy. He wrote, "Although a republican form of government
(jumhiuriyyat)profiteth all the peoples of the world, yet the majesty of kingship is
one of the signs of God. We do not wish that the countries of the world should
remain deprived thereof. If the sagacious combine the two forms into one, great
will be their reward in the presence of God."53Note that Bahaullah did not reject
republicanism outright, but praised it. He did, however, insist that it lacked the
unifying symbol provided by a constitutional monarch. The form of his statement
resembles the categories of Islamic law, in which things are ranked as forbidden,
disapproved, neutral, approved, and required. Approved actions are said to be
rewarded if performed, but not punished if neglected. He seems to imply, then,
that constitutional monarchy is approved rather than required and republicanism
not forbidden. Since no organized movement for republicanism existed in the
19th-century Middle East, Bahaullah's view accords with that of the most liberal
Ottoman thinkers. The Istanbul-based Lebanese journalist Ahmad Faris al-
Shidyaq, who supported the Ottoman constitutional movement in 1876-78, also
favored a constitutional monarchy, which he said was not much different from a
republic.54

Nineteenth-century sources make it clear that the reformist and constitutionalist
ideas of Bahaullah's tablets to the kings circulated widely among Bahais during
the 1870s and after. A Christian minister in Isfahan referred in 1874 to a collected
volume he had read of Bahaullah's letters to the monarchs as "the latest Bible of
the Baabis" and added that "the sect of Baabis which is now increasing in Persia
is that called Baha'i."55Some of Bahaullah's letters to the rulers were bound
together and circulated in manuscript copies in this period. In 1890, they were
published in Bombay, and a copy of this book was purchased for Cambridge
Orientalist E. G. Browne in Hamadan in 1896.56 In 1875, a brilliant young
seminary teacher named Mirza Abu al-Fadl Gulpaygani (1844-1914) was
investigating various religions in Tehran. At a Bahai meeting he saw a copy of the
Lawh-i Fu'ad that said God would "take hold of" Sultan Abdulaziz for his
treatment of Bahaullah. The Constitutionalist coup of 1876 followed by the
sultan's suicide, by appearing to fulfill the prophecy, helped convince Mirza Abu
al-Fadl to become a Bahai.57We do not know whether these events so moved him
only because they seemed prophetic confirmation of a millenarian turmoil abroad
in the world, or whether he had some political sympathies with constitutionalism
of the Young Ottoman sort as well. The story of his conversion, in fact, suggests
the inseparability of the two motifs within Bahai culture at this point.

The Babis, as they became Bahais, traded militancy for pacifism, anti-
intellectualism for a commitment to modern science and technology, and
conspiracies for community discussions of reform and representative government.
Close and cordial relations developed between the Bahai leaders in Acre and
reformists such as the Young Ottomans, and Bahai authors responded seriously to
moves toward reform in Iran itself, helping communicate modern ideas to that

more isolated country. Bahaullah's new message was spread by traveling apostles,
many of them highly learned men, by notable families of Sayyid merchants,
physicians, and landowners, by women with their own networks, by artisans such
as goldsmiths and tailors, and by scribes who conscientiously copied out and
circulated hundreds of manuscripts of his tablets and letters. His major works
were printed in Bombay and circulated in Iran. His supporters, though impeded by
governmental and clerical persecution, nevertheless attracted thousands of
converts. The challenge now facing the movement lay in building a community
with lasting institutions.

FROM    COMMUNITY        CONSULTATION   TO   TOBACCO   REVOLT

Bahaullah devoted the last nineteen years of his life to imbuing the Bahai commu-
nity back in Iran with an ethos and set of rituals and religious laws that differed
substantially both from those of Islam and from the Babi regulations of the Bayan.
Consultative forms of community self-government formed a cornerstone of Ba-
haullah's vision, as he sought to avoid the Usuli Shicite system of dominance by
clerics, and these local ideals tied in nicely with his prodemocracy views on na-
tional government. Was the turn to community-building partly a consequence of
the political reaction in Istanbul and Tehran from the late 1870s into the next cen-
tury? After all, reform programs at the national level-such as that set out by 'Abd
al-Baha' in 1875-went out of fashion among the Middle Eastern monarchs and
their high officials, and there seemed little point in working to influence things at
that level.

The promise of reform offered in the Ottoman Empire and Iran had proved false,
or at least premature.In 1878, Sultan Abdiilhamid,in the wake of a defeat by Russia,
prorogued parliament and reverted to royal absolutism until the 1908 Young Turk
Revolution. By the mid-1870s, Iran'sNasir al-Din Shah had also turned against the
idea of any administrativereform that would limit his power, and had in any case
never contemplatedcalling a parliament.Royal absolutism and culturalconservatism
dominated high politics in the 1880s and 1890s, though officials planned or
implemented some infrastructuralimprovements (more in the Ottoman Empire than
in Iran). Both the Ottoman and the Iranianrulers even grew suspicious of modern,
Western-style education. Sultan Abdtilhamid'scensors forbadethe mention of names
such as Namik Kemal, Rousseau, and Voltaire, and banned words like "liberty,"
"strike," "constitution," "revolution," and "socialism." Nasir al-Din's censors had
similar instructions.58

In this increasingly conservative environment, Bahaullah's writings praising
representative government looked more seditious than ever. Not only Bahaullah's
more important writings, but CAbdal-Baha's treatise on civilization as well
contained ideas, such as limits on the power of state officials and parliamentary
government, that were explicitly proscribed by the shah and the sultan. These,
moreover, had a potentially wide audience because of the increasing use of the
printing press. E. G. Browne noted after his visit to Iran in 1887-88 that Bombay-
printed editions of the Secret of Divine Civilization and of Bahaullah's mystical

Book of Certitude were widely circulated.59Like many other printed materials, the
Bahai tracts most often evaded the vigilant but overworked censors.

Starting in 1878, manuscripts of Bahaullah's new (1873) book of laws, the Most
Holy Book began to circulate among Iranian Bahai communities. In 1890, this
central text was printed in Bombay by the Afnan merchants based there. The new
religion emphasized community participation and collective leadership that
harmonized well with the political doctrines of representative government. The
Most Holy Book stipulates that in every city the Bahais should set up a local
governing body called a "house of justice" (bayt al-'adl) composed of at least
nine members. Bahaullah told these local assembles that "it is incumbent to take
counsel together (shdwiru) and to have regard for the interests of the servants of
God" and to implement Bahai laws.60The word used for taking counsel together is
a verbal form of the mushawara we found used earlier to refer to parliamentary
government. Clearly Bahaullah saw these houses of justice as consultative
steering committees for local Bahai communities. Most Shicite communities, in
contrast, would have been led by an individual Muslim mujtahid to whose rulings
laymen owed blind obedience (taqlld).

In his later supplements to his Most Holy Book, Bahaullah said that a universal
house of justice would be established in the future for the entire Bahai world and
gave it specific duties. It was to legislate on religious policy issues not covered by
the Most Holy Book, promote peace and lobby against burdensome military
budgets, choose a world language, safeguard and exalt the place of religion in
human affairs, and fix interest rates (Bahaullah allowed the taking of fair interest
on a loan from anyone, contrary to many interpretationsof Islamic law).61On the
other hand, he clearly envisioned the Bahai houses of justice as coexisting
alongside secular parliaments and rulers, since he praised the retention of
monarchy and praised the British parliamentarysystem.

Bahaullah offered criticisms, as Goldziher noted, of hurriyya, the word usually
used to translate the French liberte'. It is clear, however, that in the 19th-century
Middle East hurriyya bore the connotations, not only of liberty as understood in
republican countries, but also of libertinism. Thus, Bahaullah criticized liberty/
license for leading to sedition or public turmoil (fitna) and to immorality. On the
other hand, he did not reject the positive aspects of liberty, writing, "We approve
of liberty in certain circumstances and refuse to sanction it in others."62He
concluded that perfect liberty lay in following the commandments revealed
through him. Clearly, Bahaullah approved of political liberty as manifested in
democratic institutions, but not of antireligious libertinism (the other connotation
of hurriyya in 19th-century Arabic). Other Middle Eastern liberals commonly
linked liberty with the fulfillment of duties. The Syrian Christian journalist Adib
Ishaq, wrote Ayalon, "defined liberty as 'the right to fulfil the known duty' (haqq
al-qiyam   bi-al-wdjib   al-ma'lum)."63 Ishaq,   a freemason,    courageously    and
indefatigably advocated representative government in Egypt in the late 1870s and
early 1880s, showing that even someone who was obviously a liberal in Middle
Eastern terms could still hold a conception of liberty as the fulfillment of duty.
Goldziher erred in attempting to use the French Revolution as a universal template
for measuring the Left and the Right, in which religionists were generally on the

Right. After all, the Young Ottomans, revolutionaries demanding a constitution
and parliament, were also committed believers. So, too, were the American
Baptists who supported the American Revolution.

For Bahaullah, the term hurriyya could be deconstructed into two warring
significations: political freedom, which was good; and moral license, which was
bad. The word thus carried the additional connotations of antinomianism,
abandonment or persecution of religion, and, perhaps, political nihilism. Middle
Eastern authors often gave precisely these attributes to 1789. A typical Ottoman
view of the French Revolution said:
Whenthe revolutionbecamemoreintense,nonetook offenceat the closing of churches,the
killing and expulsionof monks,and the abolitionof religion and doctrine:they set their
heartson equalityand freedom,throughwhich they hoped to attainperfectbliss in this
world,in accordancewith the lying teachingsdisseminatedamongthe commonpeople by
this perniciouscrew.64
Since Middle Eastern writers frequently portrayed both liberty and the French
Revolution in this manner, Bahaullah naturally had apprehensions about the full
implementation of such hurriyya. His reservations about liberty/license did not, as
Goldziher apparently suspected, derive from a belief in absolutism or in the mo-
nopoly of a church over opinion. Unlike their contemporary, Pope Leo XIII, the
Bahai leaders insisted on representative government and urged that the state treat
all religions with equal toleration.65

Once the Most Holy Book began circulating among Bahais back in Iran, they
started to implement some of its provisions. Elderly Bahai notables set up a secret
house of justice or assembly of consultation in Tehran in 1878, and from there
spread the institution in the 1880s to towns in the provinces of Khurasan,
Mazandaran, Fars, and Kashan.66 Membership in these institutions at first
resembled induction into a cell of a secret society, but the invitation no doubt
arose from a community consensus on the most qualified elders. At that time only
men served on the assemblies, though women developed their own committees,
classes, and networks. Bahaullah himself wrote that "today the handmaidens of
God are regarded as men (rijdl)," but the Iranian community appears to have
implemented this principle in private spheres (such as educating girls) rather than
in public ones.67The houses of justice functioned in a consultative and collective
manner and differed from the sort of leadership offered in Qajar society by
individual hereditary nobles or clerical jurisconsults who demanded absolute
obedience from ordinary folk. I have not determined when the assemblies began
being formally elected in Iran, but United States electoral practices may have been
influential once the religion spread to North America in the 1890s. When
Bahaullah's son and successor, 'Abd al-Baha, instructed the American Bahais to
hold elections in the opening years of the 20th century, he wrote, "the rules for
election are those which are customary in that country."68

The democratic message evident in the Lawh-i dunyd (Tablets to the Monarchs)
and the Most Holy Book continues to appear in the major writings of Bahaullah in
the last twenty years of his life. He made it clear again in the 1880s, for instance,
that he disapproved of absolute monarchy. In Kalimdt-i firdawsiyyah (Words of

Paradise), written in 1889, Bahaullah condemned the tyranny of Muhammad Shah
(r. 1834-48). He said, "His Majesty MuhammadShah, despite the excellence of his
rank, committed two heinous deeds. One was the order to banish the ... Primal
Point [the Bab]; and the other, the murderof the Prince of the city of statesmanship
and literary accomplishment [Qa'im-maqam]."69Qa'im-maqam served Fath-CAli
Shah as first minister in 1821-34, but in 1835 was put to death by the newly
installed Muhammad Shah, and Bahaullah's own father was dismissed from his
governorship at the same time. This passage combines the two major indigenous
sources of Bahaullah's constitutionalism. The first derived from the threat of
arbitrarydismissal, mulcting, or even execution faced by government officials in an
absolutist system. Bahaullah, of course, came from precisely the class that suffered
most from this arbitrariness.The second source was the monarch'srole in upholding
the state religion, Shicite orthodoxy, which had led to state collusion in the
persecution of the Bab and his followers. Only constitutional and parliamentary
restraints on the ruler, Bahaullah was convinced, could ensure security of life and
property,and freedom of conscience.

At the very end of Bahaullah's life, a glimmer of political change in Iran
appeared in the Tobacco Revolt of 1891-92. Arguably the first popular rebellion
with a nation-wide impact since that of the Babis in mid-century, this revolt
protested the granting of a concession in the marketing of Iranian tobacco to a
British speculator.70The shah and his officials stood to profit from kickbacks in
the deal, and hoped foreign expertise would increase revenues from this
commodity. But the move endangered the profits of Iranian brokers, merchants,
and growers and provoked a series of demonstrations that eventually made the
shah rescind the concession. The angry merchants and farmers also drew to their
support many intellectuals and Shi'ite clergymen.

The tobacco concession typifies the sort of changes occurring during the 19th
century that may have made acquiring some control over government policy
increasingly appealing to Iran's growing middle classes and to the peasants and
artisans. The volume of Iran's external trade increased twelve times between 1800
and 1900. The country was further incorporated into the world market as a
supplier of raw materials and although disease devastated the silk industry from
the 1860s, farmers supplemented their incomes with tobacco, opium, cotton, and
rice. The population doubled over the century and became more sedentary and
slightly more urban. Although Anglo-Russian rivalry prevented the building of a
railroad, the expanding telegraph network aided national integration.71 The
constant temptation the capital-hungry state faced of attempting to farm out for
development the country's resources to foreigners increasingly brought it into
conflict with a growing middle class and with guildsmen and peasant farmers.

In July 1891, Bahaullah addressed some of the cultural and political themes in
the air in his Tablet to the World. In a passage that demonstrates a strong Iranian
patriotism, despite his internationalist sentiments, he lamented the loss of Iran's
ancient position as a world center of knowledge and polite culture, and its descent
into a self-destructive fractiousness. He bemoaned the "thick clouds of tyranny"
that had "darkenedthe face of the earth, and enveloped its peoples."72He referred
to the passage in his Most Holy Book, written nearly twenty years earlier, that

prophesied "a democracy of the people" would rule from Tehran, but regretted
that as yet usurpers and tyrants were in power. He singled out for opprobriumthe
Qajar prince Mahmud Mirza Jalal al-Dawla, the governor of Yazd, who had that
spring been involved in the killing of seven prominent Bahais. Echoing his letter
to Queen Victoria written nearly a generation earlier, he advocated that an Iranian
parliament, like "the system of government which the British people have adopted
in London," should be established and that Iranian representatives should meet
with the shah to fix a gathering place.73He warned that without such government
by consultation, Iran would descend into chaos-a warning that took on particular
urgency during the violent nationwide protests of the Tobacco Revolt.

Despite his hopes for Iran'sregeneration and his disgust with Qajartyranny, Ba-
haullah directed his followers to avoid conflict and contention. He did not mean
nonparticipation in violence during the Tobacco Revolt to end in acquiescence to
tyranny or reaction, however. Bahaullah, convinced of the inevitability of consti-
tutional and parliamentary government in Iran, wanted Bahais to work for it
peacefully, not with the old Babi scimitar. As for the point of dispute in the To-
bacco Revolt, he wrote, "Special regard must be paid to agriculture....      Agricul-
ture is highly developed in foreign lands, however in Persia it hath so far been
grievously neglected. It is hoped that His Majesty the Shah-may God assist him
by His grace-will turn his attention to this vital and important matter."74As of
July 1891, a year and a half after Nasir al-Din Shah granted the tobacco conces-
sion, Bahaullah maintained that the ruler had neglected to develop Iranian agricul-
ture. The passage perhaps ironically implies that granting concessions to
foreigners constitutes no agriculturalpolicy at all, but rather a neglect of this vital
sector.

To place Bahaullah's thought in Iran'spolitical spectrum of the time, it is instruc-
tive to compare the Tablet to the Worldto a petition from the "Liberal Movement"
or reformist intellectuals in Iran protesting the tobacco concession early in 1892.75
The petition decries Qajar officials as despotic and inhuman,just as Bahaullah did.
It calls for the establishment of organic laws and the dismissal of the current min-
isters, and demands the rule of Islamic law. It says the "reformers"do not wish to
introduce European-style legal codes, satisfied that a true application of indigenous
Islamic law would suffice. It calls upon the European powers to intervene diplo-
matically with the shah to temper his absolutism, and pledges that the newly formed
"National League" would "in endeavoring to realise our sacred ideal . . . employ
neither force nor rebellion."

Like Bahaullah, the reformers renounce violence as a means to their political
ends. Still, one is struck that in some ways Bahaullah's program is more radical.
The Bahai prophet predicted and advocated representative government on the
British model as a solution to Iran's problems in general and to the Tobacco Re-
volt in particular, whereas the National League petitioners eschew European laws
and institutions, wishing only to implement a rule of law according to the Islamic
code. The mechanisms by which this code could curb absolutism in fact are left
completely vague. Second, despite Bahaullah's own internationalism, he, unlike
the National League, did not here seek the intervention of European powers in

Iran's internal affairs. Instead, he advocated that the shah convene an indigenous
parliament to negotiate an end to the conflict.

In view of these differences, if the supporters of such reformist petitions were
progressive, then clearly Bahaullah was even more so. After decades of advocat-
ing mere administrative reforms, the embittered ex-diplomat Mirza Malkum Khan,
recently dismissed for corruption, finally came out clearly for elected, parliamen-
tary government in his London-based journal, Qdnun, in December 1892.76Histo-
rians of modern Iranian intellectual history have seen this call as something of a
breakthrough. Yet Bahaullah had, of course, been making this argument openly
since 1868, and in the context of the Tobacco Revolt he strongly reaffirmed it in
the Tablet to the World a year and a half before that historic issue of Qanun. Ab-
horred by conservative nobles and to the left of most reformist intellectuals, the
Bahais cast themselves as a sort of "loyal opposition," a force that would work
with the Qajar system to achieve democracy without violence and without corrup-
tion or undue foreign interference. Their millenarian belief in divine intervention
in human affairs helped give them the patience for a moderate course.

The peaceful and evolutionary strategy toward the achievement of representa-
tive government advocated by Bahaullah lent itself, of course, to a spectrum of in-
terpretations among the tens of thousands of Bahais living in Iran, far from their
religion's headquartersin Palestine. Some Bahais, disaffected with Qajar absolut-
ism, came close to the radical camp in their attitudes. Others, fearing the danger-
ous consequences should the charge of political dissidence be added to that of
heresy, remained politically neutral.

The career of Abu'l-Hasan Mirza Shaykh al-Ra'is (c. 1848-1918), a Qajar
prince and dissident, affords an example of the more activist interpretationof Ba-
hai ideals.77A grandson of Fath-Ali Shah whose father held a position in the pro-
vincial government of Burujird, Shaykh al-Ra'is was exposed to Babism by his
mother, a convert to the new religion. After his father's death, the family settled in
Mashhad around 1863. Shaykh al-Ra'is studied in seminary in Mashhad, then in
Samarra. Back in Mashhad, he became a seminary teacher and secretly adopted
the Bahai faith. Shaykh al-Ra'is got into difficulties with the local authorities, then
spent a decade in travel, and stayed in Istanbul some time. After a brief return to
Khurasan, where he suffered because of political jealousies, he took refuge in
Istanbul, where he was granted asylum. There, in 1892, he joined the Pan-Islamist
circle encouraged by Sultan Abduilhamid,which began with twelve expatriate Ira-
nians (himself included).78Its ranks included Shi'ites and also free-thinkers such
as Sayyid Jamal al-Din, and the ex-Azali Babi agitators, Mirza Aqa Khan Kirmani
and Shaykh Ahmad Ruhi. This circle wrote to the Shi'ite ulama in Iraq and Iran,
attempting to encourage Islamic unity against Europe through support for Sultan
Abduiilhamid.

In this period, Shaykh al-Ra'is wrote a treatise on pan-Islam called Ittihad-i Is-
lam.79 (I might point out parenthetically that Bahai support for the unity of the
Muslim world against imperialism made perfect sense; Bahai openness to certain
Western political innovations derived from a desire to strengthen Asian societies,
not from a willingness to be ruled by Westerners.) Shaykh al-Ra'is opened a cor-
respondence with Malkum Khan in which he employed the terminology of the

latter's League of Humanity, a secret society modeled on freemasonry.80The Otto-
mans declined to give him continued asylum, and, after visiting CAbdal-Baha' in
Acre, he went to India. Shaykh al-Ra'is later played a prominent role in the Con-
stitutional Revolution of 1905-11, and was imprisoned by Muhammad 'Ali Shah
(r. 1906-9).

The more conservative side of the spectrum was taken by the Bahai merchants
based in Bombay, many of them members of the Afnan clan from Shiraz. A peti-
tion to the shah from the Bombay Bahai community in early 1892 appeals for the
release of unjustly arrested Bahais and "contains expressions of sincere loyalty to
the Shah, repudiates all suggestions that they have any connection with the dis-
turbers of the public peace, and points to Sayyid Jamal al-Din and his followers as
the fomenters of trouble and disaffection towards the Shah and his sovereignty."81
A superficial reading of this letter, however, may give a more conservative im-
pression than is warrantedby Bahai actions. First, clearly the state arrested some
Bahais on charges of being involved in the revolt, and some of these charges may
have been true. Second, these very Bombay Bahais were at that moment engaged
in printing Bahai treatises calling for representative government and denouncing
Qajar tyranny. The shah knew very well that the Bahais stood for democracy and
represented an "opposition," even if a cautious one, to absolutist monarchy. The
Bombay community simply aimed at making the state understandthat, unlike the
Azali Babis and the political radicals, most Bahais constituted a nonviolent, loyal
opposition.

The pacifist, gradualist Bahais, then, had little in common with radicals, a group
that included political revolutionaries such as Sayyid Jamal al-Din and Aqa Khan
Kirmani, who called for the violent overthrow of the shah, as well as outraged
merchants and their followers who staged street demonstrations in 1891, and some
of the more nativist members of the Shi'ite clergy, who employed the mosque to
begin demonstrations and bazaar strikes. Unlike the radicals, Bahaullah believed,
in liberal fashion, in the power of discourse to change human ideas and institu-
tions. He took a dim view of several radical intellectuals who emerged as impor-
tant during the Tobacco Revolt. When Aqa Khan Kirmani came to Acre in the late
1880s to investigate the claims of Bahais, Bahaullah had dismissed him as a
schemer.82In the summer of 1891, Bahaullah wrote against Sayyid Jamal al-Din
Asadabadi "al-Afghani"-he had still not heard that the latter had fallen from the
shah's favor and been expelled from Iran.

It is reportedthat a certainperson[SayyidJamalal-Din] went to the seat of the imperial
thronein Persiaand succeededin winningthe good gracesof some of the nobilityby his
behaviour.How pitiful indeed,how deplorable. . . certaindignitarieshave allowed them-
selves to be treatedas playthingsin the handsof the foolish. The aforesaidpersonhath
writtensuch thingsconcerningthis peoplein the Egyptianpressandin the BeirutEncyclo-
pedia that the well-informedand the learnedwere astonished.He proceededthen to Paris
wherehe publisheda newspaperentitled Urwatu'l-Wuthqaand sent copies thereofto all
partsof the world.He also sent a copy to the Prisonof 'Akka,andby so doing he meantto
show affectionand to make amendsfor his past actions.In short,this WrongedOne hath
observed silence in regard to him.83

Bahaullah criticized Sayyid Jamal al-Din for his scapegoating of the Bahais and
his manipulative approach to politics. Sayyid Jamal al-Din, after all, never put the
achievement of democracy in the forefront of his program, stressing anti-imperial-
ism and reform-from-above instead.

Of the three main political currents-the conservative typified by the Qajar rul-
ing elite, the liberal reformism of the middle strata, and the radicalism of revolu-
tionaries-the Bahai stance most resembled that of the liberal reformers. Yet
Bahaullah's open and constant insistence on British-style parliamentary democ-
racy distinguished his community from both the Iranian liberals and the revolu-
tionaries during his lifetime. His refusal to condone violence and his commitment
to a constitutional monarchy that would tame the Qajars without overthrowing
them further distinguished him from the radicals. From the 1870s through the
early 1890s Bahai thought on representative government put this religion in the
progressive camp, especially given the conservative reaction during this era in
both Istanbul and in Tehran. That the Bahai religion held no place for a formal
clergy required the creation of new, collective forms of leadership, such as the as-
semblies of consultation or houses of justice on which prominent believers served.
The emphasis on collective decision-making in Bahaullah's writings accorded well
with his democratic political program. The concentration on community consulta-
tion of the 1880s may have resulted from the turning away from political reform
in Tehran, which dashed hopes that any audience existed there for the Bahai blue-
prints for democratic policies. Bahaullah's writings on politics, though clear about
the need for representative government, allowed both an activist and a quietist
reading among Bahais back in Iran. Shaykh al-Ra'is represented the activist wing,
whereas the Afnan merchants adopted a less confrontational style.

Many Iranians appeared ready, from the 1840s onward, to listen to a messianic
leader who might turn the world upside down. Neither the sometimes militant
Babis nor their more liberal successors, the Bahais, had any use for Qajar absolut-
ism or for its base in the exploitation of ordinary folk. The Bahais elaborated their
ideals of governance in a detailed fashion, singling out British constitutional mon-
archy and the democracies of the Americas for praise. For them, the advent of the
world messiah signified the end of absolutism, of the tyranny of shah and mullah,
and the coming of a new world where the lay public would exercise influence over
political and religious affairs. The introduction of a rule of law, of an elected leg-
islature, of constitutional limits on monarchy, of low taxes on the poor and in-
creased state investment in their welfare would have truly turned the society
upside down. The monarchies that refused to bend before the new wind, they
thought, would find themselves consigned to the dustheap of history-as with Na-
poleon III-or the rivers of their realms would run red with blood-as Bahaullah
prophesied to the Kaiser-or the despot would face public turmoil and deposi-
tion-as with Sultan Abdiilaziz. Bahaullah envisaged the use of typically liberal
means for implementing his vision of representative government, of discourse and
discussion (baydn). Bahais would convince Iranians to become democratic,
through consultative practices in the local houses of justice and through spreading
belief in the Bahai scriptures and ideology. Bahaullah's plan for democracy and
social welfare, during an era of semifeudal Qajar absolutism, had the advantage of

being radical enough to appeal to disgruntled artisans and intellectuals, while re-
maining liberal enough to attract merchants of large property.

Goldziher's confusion about whether the Bahai faith stood in the liberal or the
absolutist camp can now be resolved. In predicting and advocating government by
the people, Bahaullah sounds more like Joseph Priestley than like Hobbes. In
urging religious toleration, the Bahai leaders resemble John Stuart Mill more than
Pope Leo XIII. In championing the poor against the feudal classes, in seeking to
promote modern science and industry, and in advocating a global government,
Bahaullah sounds remarkablylike Saint-Simon. Combining messianism, an option
for the poor, and a firm belief in representative government, the Bahais upheld
what was in a Middle Eastern context a progressive program of social reform,
though their mix of cultural motifs has made it difficult for Western scholars
clearly to fix them on the European political spectrum.

Surprisingly, Bahais in the period 1868-92 had the same sort of links with
dissident movements as did the Azali Babis. In their contacts with the Young
Ottomans, in their advocacy of parliamentarydemocracy, and in the relations of
their intellectuals such as Shaykh al-Ra'is with Iranian dissidents in Istanbul, the
Bahais appear to differ from the Azalis mainly in two ways. First, they had less
antipathy toward the Qajars, though they still wanted them reduced to con-
stitutional monarchs. Second, because they were pacifists, for the most part they
sought irenic ways to effect social change, whereas the Azalis were willing to
encourage violent demonstrations in 1891-92 and to advocate the assassination of
Nasir al-Din Shah. Historians have tended, without warrant, to read the policy of
nonintervention in politics adopted by 'Abd al-Baha' in 1907 (and intensified by
his successor and grandson, Shoghi Efendi Rabbani from 1921 to 1957) back into
the period 1868-92. Shaykh al-Ra'is may not have been such an anomaly, as an
activist Bahai constitutionalist. Although the Bahai movement differed from the
Young Ottoman society and from the 'Urabist revolutionaries in Egypt in being a
new religion, its political ideas were formed at the same time and in response to
many of the same circumstances as were the other early constitutionalist forces.
Even in regard to religion, there were some convergences. Young Ottoman
activists like Namik Kemal experimented with mysticism, and the CUrabi
revolution had millenarian overtones. Nor was the later Bahai turn to political
neutrality unique. Most Young Ottomans, disillusioned after 1878, took little part
in the 1908 Young Turk revolution. The CUrabirevolution ended with a British
takeover of Egypt, and 'Urabists like MuhammadCAbduhlater concluded that the
Egyptians were not ready for democracy. The constitutionalists-mostly
intellectuals, merchants, artisans, and peasants-had little chance of immediate
success in a Middle East dominated by quasi-feudal landlords and aristocrats
supported by the European powers, though they articulated a long-term aspiration
of Middle Eastern peoples.

Historians have seen thinkers such as Akhundzada, Malkum Khan, Yusuf Khan,
Talibuf, Sayyid Jamal al-Din, and Aqa Khan Kirmani as intellectual forebears of
the Constitutional Revolution of 1905-11. Some of these figures laid little stress
on democracy, and others had a limited audience for their ideas in Iran during
their lifetimes. Given the evidence here presented, Mirza Husayn CAli Nuri

Bahaullah must be added to this canon. As the founder of a new religion with tens
of thousands of adherents, drawn from illiterate artisans and peasants as well as
from merchants, intellectuals, and notables, Bahaullah attracted a large audience
in Iran. By studying both his writings and how they were understood by his
audience, engaging in both a "writerly" and a "readerly"analysis, we can hope to
gain insights into the social history of ideas in Iran, rather than simply into the
ideas of reformist officials and diplomats.
