Robert Hayden’s “[American Journal]”:
A Multidimensional Analysis

Christopher Buck, Ph.D., J.D.1
Pittsburgh, Independent Scholar

Immortalized by ―Those Winter Sundays‖ and such other treasures as ―A
Ballad of Remembrance‖, ―Runagate Runagate‖, ―The Night-Blooming
Cereus‖, ―On Lookout Mountain‖, ―Frederick Douglass‖ and ―El-Hajj
Malik El-Shabazz‖—all of which have taken their rightful places ―among
the masterpieces of modern American poetry‖—Robert Hayden (1913–
1980) has emerged as one of the great American poets of modern times. His
epic centerpiece, ―Middle Passage‖ (based largely on the 1839 rebellion on
the Spanish slave ship, Amistad) ranks as ―one of the great American long
poems‖2. However, ―[American Journal]‖ (1976), as the title poem of his
final collection, American Journal (1978)3, scarcely achieved such acclaim
and, in fact, has attracted comparatively little scholarship. This is not
surprising, since Hayden is still identified and typecast as primarily as an
African American poet, and is most well-known for his earlier signature
poems, mentioned above. Quite naturally, Hayden‘s primary audience is
more attracted to those poems that address racial issues more directly and
fully.

―[American Journal],‖ however, treats the human race from a universal
perspective rather than from a racial (and thus bracketed) vantage, although
humanity is seen through a nationalistic portal, namely that of ―the
americans‖. Thus ―[American Journal]‖ operates on two perspectival planes:
narrowly, as observations (i.e. informal cultural analysis) of America itself,
and, broadly, as a social commentary on the world. As one of Hayden‘s most
interesting, yet under-examined poems, ―[American Journal]‖ suggests that
America—and the rest of our world—is on a path of social evolution
requiring greater social maturity, in which such ―strangering‖ distinctions as
racial prejudice retard social progress. In describing American identity in
several dimensions, including racial identity, ―[American Journal]‖ presents
America as a work-in-progress in terms of its social evolution. Implicit in
―[American Journal]‖, therefore, is this thesis: Social maturity is coefficient

with human solidarity. This thesis unifies the various kinds of identity that
this compressed and kaleidoscopic poem treats. As a literary tube of mirrors,
―[American Journal]‖ implicitly describes social identities that render the
American experience decidedly multidimensional.

A fresh study of ―[American Journal]‖ will also contribute to a fuller
appreciation of Hayden‘s role as a social poet. Without recapitulating
Hayden‘s life and career, it makes sense to focus on what Hayden was doing
in 1976, the year he composed ―[American Journal]‖. Robert Hayden was
―America‘s Bicentennial poet laureate‖4—vernacular ―America‖ meaning
the United States. During America‘s Bicentennial of the Declaration of
Independence in 1976, Hayden served as Consultant in Poetry to the Library
of Congress, in the first of his two-term tenure (1976–77 and 1977–78).
That same position later became known as ―Poet Laureate of the United
States‖ in 1985.5 As America‘s Bicentennial poet laureate and the first
African American poet laureate, Hayden rose to the occasion by offering a
poem about America. That poem is ―[American Journal]‖ (1976). Given this
historical and literary context, ―[American Journal]‖ may thus be regarded
as America‘s ―Bicentennial poem‖6—not exclusively, of course, but by
virtue of these special circumstances.

While Michael Harper—Robert Hayden‘s close friend, fellow poet, and
publisher—does not explain his singling out of ―[American Journal]‖ as
America‘s ―Bicentennial poem,‖ there is some justification for this. This
logic is as follows: It‘s a simple fact that one else occupied Hayden‘s
position as Consultant in Poetry to the Library of Congress in 1976. If, in an
official capacity, Hayden was America‘s poet-laureate during the
Bicentennial, it stands to reason that Hayden was America‘s Bicentennial
poet-laureate as no other poet represented the United States in quite that
capacity, whether officially or popularly. It follows, therefore, that Hayden‘s
major poem on America—―[American Journal]‖—can and has been
distinguished as America‘s ―Bicentennial poem‖. Michael Harper was right.

Positionally, ―[American Journal]‖ is both the title poem and final piece in
Hayden‘s last, single volume, American Journal. Nominated for the
National Book Award that same year, American Journal was first published
in 1978. Effendi Press proprietor Michael S. Harper issued a limited edition
in a print-run of 1,000 copies, with only 47 unpaginated.7 Effendi Press was
really not a publishing house at all, but was created with one aim in mind: to
promote Hayden‘s work, as Derik Smith notes: ―Harper established ‗Effendi

Parini (New York: Oxford University Press, 2004), Vol. 2, 177–181. (See 179, 181.)

Technically, one could say that Hayden was the ―the first African American Consultant in Poetry to
the Library of Congress‖ and Rita Dove was ―the first African American Poet Laureate of the United States,‖ since
that title was not current during Hayden‘s tenure.

Press‘ for the sole purpose of disseminating Hayden‘s final poems to a small
audience. It was used for no other publication‖.8 American Journal was
posthumously republished in an augmented edition in 1982, with 70
(paginated) pages.9 ―This book,‖ Harper explains, ―would be something he
[Hayden] would use as an indicator of his new poetic resolve to speak freely
about America‘s conundrum, race and identity‖.10 Thus ―[American
Journal]‖ was effectively a collaborative endeavor, borne of a strategic
alliance between Robert Hayden as poet and fellow-poet, Michael S. Harper,
as publisher.

―[American Journal]‖ is also the capstone poem in Hayden‘s Collected
Poems, published in 1985 by Liveright, which reissued the volume in a
1987 revised edition, with an introduction by Arnold Rampersad.11 Among
the literary treasuries in which it has been variously anthologized,
―[American Journal]‖ was chosen as the ultimate offering in Ethelbert‘s
Miller‘s exquisitely designed anthology, In Search of Color Everywhere: A
Collection of African-American Poetry.12 Thus ―[American Journal]‖ takes a
certain pride of place in Hayden‘s work in that it ―gains more and more
authority and significance as the last piece‖ in Collected Poems and serves
as ―a perfect consummation and coda to his [Hayden‘s] career as a poet‖.13
As Hayden‘s signature piece, the ink is drenched with dry and wry social
commentary.

As one of his most salient yet least illuminated of his poems, ―[American
Journal]‖ reveals much about Hayden‘s treatment of American identity, and
of his tropical use of ―America‖ as well. The artifice of ―[American
Journal]‖ is quite interesting: ―[American Journal]‖ purports to be the field
notes of a Martian observer who, by his shape-shifting powers, disguises
himself in an array of human personas, and who then reports his findings to
his superiors, ―the Counselors‖. As if by architectonic design, ―[American
Journal]‖ appears immediately after ―Astronauts‖, the penultimate piece in
American Journal. Positionally as well as substantively, ―Astronauts‖
prepares the reader to suspend disbelief when the next and final poem,
―[American Journal]‖, introduces the unlikely figure of an alien observer

from outer space, whose field-notes are reported in ―[American Journal]‖.
The alien‘s journal about America (hence the title, ―[American Journal]‖) is
recorded in truncated form—largely by the poetic device known as
brachylogy (condensed expression; laconic speech), as in ―oceans deserts
mountains grain fields canyons / forests         variousness of landscapes
weathers / sun light moon light as at home much here is / beautiful dream
like vistas reminding me of / home‖.14

America‘s ―Bicentennial poem‖ is a largely a myth about the myth of
America. In reverent irreverence, ―[American Journal]‖ is a mythic anti-
myth in that it questions, if not deconstructs, cherished American values
such as the American Dream. Indeed, Howard Faulkner theorizes that
Hayden‘s poems—each in its own way—may be collapsed into two words
(or concepts) that serve as the genesis for the entire poem: ―Each of
Hayden‘s poems can be reduced to a single pair of words from which the
surface structure of the poem is generated‖.15 If applicable to Hayden‘s later
work as a whole, then ―[American Journal]‖—as a specimen of Hayden‘s
most mature work—may be distilled to these two words: ―paradox‖ and
―metaphysics‖. That is to say, America is ―paradox on paradox‖16 and ―as
much a problem in metaphysics as / it is a nation‖.17

This surface structure is a key to the deep structure of the poem. Hayden
explores the metaphysical paradox of America by means of a corporate,
psycho-social profile. Thus ―[American Journal]‖ is really a character study
of the national character. Indeed, Ronald Walcott states the obvious in
noting that the focus of ―[American Journal]‖ is the ―nation‘s character‖.18

Hayden develops a profile of the American character through exploring
various facets of American identity. The alien, we will soon discover,
observes a range of individual and group identity formations. Given Robert
Hayden‘s ―almost ritual preoccupation with identity‖,19 this study employs
identity as a heuristic for extracting deeper meaning from ―[American
Journal]‖. In sketching out the American physical and social landscape and
its peoples, the Martian observer creates a social portrait of America in
several dimensions, which add depth to this poem of 115 lines. The alien
speaks with an American voice, as poet Yusef Komunyakaa has observed:

Composed ―with impressionistic staccato‖,21 Hayden‘s modernist
impressionism (minimism), not precision, is the poem‘s virtue as to its craft.
The poem‘s technique of compression, combined with frequent enjambment
(where sentences ―straddle‖ two or more lines, for effect), is seen in the
demonstration scene: ―crowds gathering in the streets today for some /
reason obscure to me noise and violent motion / repulsive physical contact
sentinels pigs / i heard them called with flailing clubs rage / and
bleeding and frenzy and screaming           machines / wailing     unbearable
decibels i fled lest / vibrations of the brutal scene do further harm / to my
metabolism already over taxed‖.22 Here, conflicting partisan political
identities (such as the conflict between ―hawks‖ and ―doves‖ in the Vietnam
era) are implicated. Ideologically based, this conflict is brought to a head
through a staged public outcry against current government policy, whatever
the issue might have been. (The reader can fill in the blanks of possibility.)
Partisan political identity is just one of several forms that social identity
takes in America, and ―[American Journal]‖ explores a range of expressions
of American identity. Although Hayden‘s fictive phenomenology of America
is not predictive, but rather descriptive, the poem succeeds in treating the
issue of social identity on several levels.

While the poem lacks explanatory power, it is powerfully evocative. The
alien narrator speaks as an outsider, and appears to give merely surface
observations. An exquisite irony obtains here: Far from defining the core of
the American social experience, the alien‘s first impressions are not only
lasting impressions but are penetrating impressions in that they are socially
incisive in an albeit naïve way. The implicit message of ―[American
Journal]‖ is that America—and, by extension, contemporary societies at
large—will have to allow for wider social alignments to effectively

reconcile focused and fractious identities and resolve the social conflicts
that these have generated. With empathic abstraction, our alien
anthropologist notes—with some amusement admixed with fascination—the
primitive yet promising state of American social evolution, where racial
identity must negotiate with an integrative awareness of human identity in a
global (and even galactic) perspective. By contrast, Martians have advanced
beyond the figments of pigment and fixation on differences generally: ―we
are an ancient race and have outgrown / illusions cherished here‖.23 In other
words, the theme of ―[American Journal]‖ is one of social maturity based on
human solidarity.

Compared to a more highly evolved (Martian) society, America in 1976—
the bicentenary of its Declaration of Independence—had yet to resolve the
social disparities that a more highly advanced society had already learned to
cope with in the course of ―Martian‖ social evolution. Thus ―[American
Journal]‖ is a time capsule—a period piece—with an implicit social
commentary that appears to reflect aspects of Robert Hayden‘s worldview
as a Bahá‘í, which is basically a vision of interracial harmony and world
unity. Thus it does not matter whether the Martian is a full or partial
projection Hayden himself, or simply a character—one of a number of
poetic portraitures—that Hayden has created, since the Martian‘s views
appear to be implicitly Bahá‘í in nature. The most explicit clue to this is the
expression, ―Unknowable Essence‖ (treated below), which is a Bahá‘í term
of art for ―God‖.

The Martian—whether Hayden or not, and/or Bahá‘í or not—in musing on
America, describes Americans as ―charming savages                enlightened
primitives brash / new comers lately sprung up in our galaxy‖.24 Such a
depreciative abbreviation of Americans assumes the perspective of an
advanced civilization. This is corroborated later in the poem, where the
alien, after describing a Fourth of July (and possibly a Bicentennial)
celebration, observes that ―we too recall / that struggle as enterprise of
suffering and / faith uniquely theirs‖.25 Here, the alien alludes to the
American Revolution as part and parcel of a social evolution. Hayden‘s use
of the plural pronoun ―we‖ in the poem suggests that he is trying to develop
a communal, perhaps national or global perspective. Indeed, this collective
perspective is given galactic—and thus figuratively universal—dimensions.

―Hayden knew his country and its condition, and saw it whole‖, Arnold
Rampersad observes.26 At the risk of stating the obvious, Robert Hayden‘s
―[American Journal]‖ is about American social identity and the tensions that
conflicting social identities generate. Identity has long been an integral

feature of modern literary criticism. In his final chapter of Literary
Theory—―Identity, Identification, and the Subject‖—Jonathan Culler notes:
―Literary works offer a range of implicit models of how identity is
formed‖.27 Indeed, literature has often ―made identity a theme‖.28 Beyond
the personal identity of a given character or group, literature may speak to
the reifications and ramifications of social identities: ―The explosion of
recent theorizing about race, gender, and sexuality in the field of literary
studies owes much to the fact that literature provides rich materials for
complicating political and sociological accounts of the role of such factors
in the construction of identity‖.29 ―[American Journal]‖ may thus be read as
the social poet‘s musing on the paradoxes of American identity, where
America is ―paradox on paradox‖.30 The poem cannot be read as a
theoretical treatment of American identity. Yet it may be possible to read
―[American Journal]‖—productively rather than reductively—as a subtle
exploration of American social identity that implicitly generalizes. ―Poems
and novels address us in ways that demand identification, and identification
works to create identity‖, Culler explains.31

These identities often extend from individual to group identities. In so
doing, there is always the risk of stereotyping or indulging in over
generalized ―essentialism‖. ―Identification also plays a role in the
production of group identities‖, Culler continues.32 Often these groups may
be ―historically oppressed or marginalized‖.33 Perhaps the closest
conceptual and methodological analogue to such an analysis of ―[American
Journal]‖ is the Multidimensional Identity Model—a framework of analysis
designed to examine and measure how individuals negotiate multiple social
identities of age, ethnicity, gender, race, religion, sexual orientation, and
socioeconomic class and to assess the relative saliency of their various
social identities.34 This set of social identities bears striking resemblance to
Culler‘s exemplars, which include ―nationality, race, gender, sexual
preference, language, class, or religion‖.35 Naturally, these seven categories
are neither foundational nor fixed. Yet they possess a certain referential
utility. In its own creative way, ―[American Journal]‖ recognizes that
individual Americans variously identify, either passively or actively, with
one or more aspects of social identity.

A close reading of ―[American Journal]‖ assumes that these American social
identities act as superegos that overarch and refract on individual identities,

to which individual identities may be subaltern. In the opening lines of the
poem, the poet describes ―the americans this baffling / multi people‖.36 Yet,
at the end of the poem, the poet is at a loss to adequately account for ―their
variousness their ingenuity / their elan vital and that some thing essence /
quiddity i cannot penetrate or name‖.37 Nevertheless, internal evidence
suggests that Hayden treats American identity in nine dimensions: (1)
Landscape Identity; (2) Alien (Individual) Identity; (3) Racial Identity; (4)
Political Identity; (5) Class Identity; (6) Material Identity; (7) Religious
Identity; (8) American (National) Identity; (9) Human Identity. Let us now
define these identities:

(1) Landscape Identity—Origin: Landscape identity is an association with
place. It is a constructed idea, shaped by experience and modulated in the
imagination, affixed to a real or ideal landscape. ―This quality of
inseparability from landscape distinguishes identity from image,‖ writes
Arreola.38 This is the geographic matrix of the self, the environment of the
individual, which shapes him and is reciprocally reshaped by the individual.
Land can be sacred. It is almost always identified as one‘s home if it is the
place of one‘s origin.

(2) Alien Identity—Individualism: This is the persona that inhabits the
environment, the terranean substrate. The individual is a alien relative to
others in the sense that an individual is a distinct and ever-individuating
entity.

(3) Racial Identity—Pride and Prejudice: Just as the self plays a major
role in the construction of the individual from within, racial identity is the
imposition and assimilation of an identity from without. Racialism is a
social construct, freighted with a range of behavioral and essentialist
associations.

(4) Political Identity—Partisanship: This is political partisanship, pure
and simple—an ideology with which the individual may associate.

(5) Class Identity—The American Dream: More precisely, ―social class‖
or ―socio-economic status, class identity is identification by things—that is,
a classification by the accumulation of wealth or the lack thereof, being the
condition of poverty—and the corresponding valuation (or devaluation) of
social standing and personal worth attached to those estimates.

(6) Material Identity—Technocratic Materialism: This is identification
with things. The distinction between class and material identities as a
function of identification by things as opposed to identification with things

Hayden, ―[American Journal]‖, lines 1–2.

Ibid., lines 113–115.

Daniel D. Arreola, ―Urban Ethnic Landscape Identity‖, The Geographical Review 1995, 85(4), 518–
34\. (See 518.)

is admittedly an oversimplification. But here, this identification with things
corresponds to Hayden‘s portrayal of American technocratic materialism.
This includes hedonistic pursuits as means and ends in themselves.

(7) Religious Identity—Mysticism: Identification with an organized
religion or spiritual orientation, typically religious identity is associated with
some sense of transcendence of the purely material.

(8) American Identity—Nationalism: This could be any kind of
nationalism. In ―[American Journal]‖, the alien happens to witness
exuberant displays of American exceptionalism.

(9) Integrative (Human) Identity—Globalism: This is the self that
subsumes the eight other dimensions as an integrative whole. This is the
most evolved sense of self, the alien would probably say.

Hayden‘s multidimensional portraiture of America is a heterophany of
disparate elements—the fragmented yet irreducible variables of American
identity to which both individual and national identity may be attuned. The
central problematic is one of social maturity, rather than the fact that
Americans lack consensus on defining their identity—―do they indeed know
what or who / they are do not seem to‖.39 The poet situates American
identity along a spectrum of social maturity measured by fictionalized
galactic standards. The poet—a visiting alien who is an erstwhile
participant-observer—characteristically comments on the Americans as
―charming savages enlightened primitives brash / new comers lately
sprung up in our galaxy‖.40 The poet‘s language, although somewhat
condescending, is respectful and, indeed, sympathetic: ―confess i am
curiously drawn unmentionable to / the americans‖.41

Critics may contest these dimensions. Some may argue that more
dimensions inhere in this poem. Others may say less. Others may say that
not one of these dimensions is distinct to literature. However, we have just
shown that literary critic, Jonathan Culler, attests to ―nationality, race,
gender, sexual preference, language, class, or religion‖.42 These are seven
dimensions of identity. The nine dimensions that the present writer has
identified emerge from the poem itself. So, while this multidimensional
framework of analysis, on a first surmise, may appear to place the poem
under a kind of sociological scrutiny, Robert Hayden would have
appreciated such an approach to the explication of a poem if the method
served a heuristic purpose. These nine dimensions provide a scaffolding for
conducting a first-order phenomenology of America as seen through the

eyes of the poet. There is clear textual support for these nine dimensions in
―[American Journal]‖, as the following table illustrates:

The citation of these lines in their respective dimensions of individual and
social identity furnish some of the raw data from ―[American Journal]‖
itself. To be sure, these nine dimensions of identity do not receive equal
treatment in the poem. Nor is their representation or presentation systematic.
Nevertheless, they are present in the poem and are part of its integral fabric.

comprise ―[American Journal]‖, these nine dimensions operate as a
multifaceted prism of American mentality and potentiality.

On viewing Hayden‘s ―[American Journal]‖ through this dimensional prism,
America emerges as a work-in-progress—episodically revised by crisis after
crisis—an experiment through which the meaning of humanity may be
universalized. This ―work‖ will progress until it reaches a stage in which the
interplay of competing identities is seen as a stable matrix—an ideal array
of integrative identities (reflecting Hayden‘s general orientation as a
Bahá‘í). This optic will apply to the inarticulate yet implicitly unitive moral
of ―[American Journal]‖—a message in a bottle, as it were. America, in the
poet‘s musing, is caught up in a socially adolescent identity crisis. America
has yet to mature until it resolves its fundamental identity crisis. This, in the
broader context, is a defining social problematic of the world at large.

Our special thesis is that ―America‖ itself—as portrayed in ―[American
Journal]‖ and as analytically illuminated by the nine dimensions previously
described—operates topically and tropically as an emblematic problematic
in humanity. The problem is not with any identity in particular. It is when
particular identities alienate.

In composing ―[American Journal]‖, Hayden—who is acutely aware of this
―strangering‖ or schisming dynamic—contrives a reconnaissance mission
involving a fictive visit by a man from Mars. An inverse of NASA‘s Mars
Reconnaissance Orbiter launched in 2005, Hayden launches his own probe
of planet Earth, to explore American alienation through the eyes of an alien
from outer space, who defines the core and refines the crux of American
identity.

A substantive reckoning with existing writing on Robert Hayden indicates
that the present state of scholarship on the relationship between African
American poetry, modernism, and Hayden involves questions of the lineage,
politics, philosophy of his poetry. As to lineage, a problem exists in that
―critics have yet to establish a rigorous artistic genealogy for Hayden‖.57
One thing we know: Hayden was no confessionalist. As for literary aspects
of the poem and its relation to the work of Hayden‘s contemporaries,
―[American Journal]‖ shared no affinity with Gwendolyn Brooks‘s
movement toward African poetic forms and what has been generally called a
―new Black consciousness,‖ as advocated by such literary figures as
Margaret Walker and Amiri Baraka (LeRoi Jones), among others. While
―[American Journal]‖ was not antithetical to these new directions, the poem
itself remained somewhat aloof and thus alien to these other literary forms,
which it did not seek to emulate.

Derik Smith, Love’s Lonely Offices, 6.

Then there is the issue of the politics of his poetry, which can be
encapsulated by the juxtaposition of two major events in Hayden‘s literary
career, both of which took place in April 1966: On 7 April 1966, Hayden‘s A
Ballad of Remembrance was awarded, by unanimous vote, the Grand Prix
de la Poesie (Grand Prize for Poetry) at the First World Festival of Negro
Arts in Dakar, Senegal. With over ten thousand people from thirty-seven
nations in attendance, this literary prize was comparable to an Olympic gold
medal. Hayden himself was honored as poet laureate of Senegal. 58 Then, on
22 April 1966, a group of protest poets, led by Melvin Tolson, condemned
Hayden for refusing to identify himself as a black poet.

This confrontation took place at Fisk University‘s First Black Writers‘
Conference, organized by John Oliver Killens, Fisk‘s writer-in-residence (a
position originally promised to Hayden). The clash between Hayden‘s black
Americanism and militant black nationalism came to a head in a panel
discussion that included Tolson, Arna Bontemps, and Margaret Walker.
Hayden, who was the fourth member of the panel, insisted that he should be
identified as ―a poet who happens to be Negro‖.59 Reacting viscerally to
Hayden‘s perhaps ill-chosen use of the verb ―happens‖, Tolson retorted:
―I‘m a black poet, an African-American poet, a Negro poet. I‘m no
accident—and I don‘t give a tinker‘s damn what you think‖.60 Subsequently
Hayden was blacklisted on the Fisk campus as an ―Uncle Tom‖ and an
―Oreo‖.61 Thus, from 1966 to 1976, ideological antagonism between
Hayden and the Black Arts Movement threatened to push Hayden to the
periphery of African American poetry as a consequence of his intransigent
resistance to the poetics of black nationalism.

However, a close look at Hayden‘s publication record from 1966 to 1976 in
comparison to previous years reveals the increasing circulation of his poetry
during the Black Arts era. In fact, Hayden‘s poems ―Frederick Douglass‖,
―Middle Passage‖, and ―Runagate Runagate‖, in particular, appeared in
many of the same African American anthologies as Amiri Baraka, Haki R.
Madhubuti, and others who might have been viewed as his adversaries.
True, Hayden was unpopular among some outspoken critics. Yet, at the
same time, his poetry was favored by a large number of editors and thus
central to the discourse.

For Hayden, to be a ―Black Artist‖ was to ghettoize and overspecialize
―Black Art‖, with its poetry, generating ―more heat than light‖62. While
rejecting race consciousness as the defining criterion and its necessarily

polarizing agenda, however, Hayden could still be the ―blackest of blacks‖
had he wished. Certainly he composed some of the finest black history
poems in the English language. ―Robert Hayden,‖ according to Arnold
Rampersad, ―made the period poem (the period being slavery) virtually his
own invention among black poets‖63. Widely recognized as the premier
craftsman of African-American poetry, Hayden‘s virtuoso as a wordsmith is
uncharacteristically subdued in ―[American Journal]‖. Elsewhere,
Rampersad situates Hayden within a racial perspective and, beyond, in the
broader American context: ―It is possible to see Hayden both as a racial poet
and as one transcending race.‖64.

As for Hayden‘s poetic techniques, these arise not by virtue of high
modernism or traditionalism alone, admixed with the poet‘s irreducibly
innate innovations, much of Hayden‘s compositional technique at the level
of the words themselves effloresce from his fascination and mastery of
language itself, as Rampersad notes: ―Probably no other black poet of his
age surpassed Hayden in the unconditional nature of his love of the English
language‖.65 Gone are the evocative neologisms—or portmanteaus—for
which Hayden is famous—words such as ―soulscape‖, ―snowlight‖,
―lifeswawk‖, ―mimosa‘s fancywork‖, and ―Absolute Otherwhere‖. In
―[American Journal]‖, the reader will not encounter such expressions as
―moonstruck trees‖, ―auroral dark‖, ―famine fields‖, ―jazzbo strutting of a
mouse‖, ―totemic flowers‖, ―paleocrystic ice‖, ―elegiac lace‖, ―glaucous
poison jewels‖ and ―blazonry of farewell scarlet‖66. The single exception in
―[American Journal]‖ is the word ―strangering‖—―their varied
pigmentations      white black / red brown yellow         the imprecise and
strangering / distinctions by which they live by which they / justify their
cruelties to one another‖67. That this is a Hayden-esque neologism is seen in
the fact that ―strangering‖ is not lexicalized in such authorities as The
Concise Oxford English Dictionary—although ―stranger‖ does appears as a
verb (―To make a stranger of; to alienate‖) in The Oxford English
Dictionary. Hayden was also a master of rhythm, tonality, repetition, irony,
oxymoron, paradox, and symbolism. ―[American Journal]‖—crafted as it is
in the form of a journal—is more journalistic (on the order of syncopated
―field notes‖) and far less orchestrated with Hayden‘s poetic devices
commonly met with elsewhere.

In some ways, ―[American Journal]‖ is unique in relationship to Hayden‘s
other works, but at the same time, it does have notable similarities. For one,
the poem utilizes persona, a mode of writing that Hayden took up time and
time again, especially in his most published works. Consider, for example,
that the central narrator of ―Middle Passage‖ records his thoughts in a

journal, an approach that Hayden took up decades later in ―[American
Journal]‖. ―[American Journal]‖ is a report about Americans addressed to a
mysterious group of higher authorities known only as ―The Counselors‖. In
this highly imaginative piece, the poet‘s observations take on the character
of an anthropologist‘s field-notes. With almost scientific precision, Hayden
struggles to describe ―the americans‖. ―[American Journal]‖ is a perfect
exemplar of Hayden‘s experimental vigor, where, by perpetrating this fiction
of the alien‘s reconnaissance in poetic prepense, Hayden gains, in
consummate irony, a fresh authenticity.

In understanding the poetry of Robert Hayden, it is important to note that
Hayden uses some of the key techniques of black modernism in service of
black Americanism. First, there was an intimate relationship between
African American and European American Modernism. Exemplified by its
early monuments, James Joyce‘s Ulysses and T.S. Eliot‘s The Waste Land,
Anglo-American modernism, generally, is a period concept—a ―spirit of the
age‖. Descriptive of art and literature produced roughly between 1885 and
1930, modernism was a radical departure from 19th-century canons of art
and beauty. Hayden‘s work breathes in the atmosphere of late modernism,
which spawned, in its wake, African American modernism. The modernist
supercategory is ―form-equals-function‖—where symbolism, allegory, and
narrative serve as major artistic resources.68 Black modernism is a species of
American modernism, which, in turn, was part of a transatlantic modernist
movement, whose mission was to redefine aesthetics for the twentieth
century.

Modernism ―is predominantly ‗epistemological‘ in nature: it seeks, despite
the confusing webs of psychic, perceptual, and social facts, to disclose a
coherent, knowable world‖.69 For black modernism, this world-disclosing
quest for meaning meant making sense of the black predicament. Making
sense of it was a far cry from accepting it. Exposing the status quo was
tantamount to rejecting it. Not surprisingly, therefore, one axis of black
modernism was its protest agenda. Hayden amplified that agenda yet
subdued the protestant element so that the reader would reach kindred
conclusions on his own in moments of social self-discovery.

Technically, ―[American Journal]‖ represents the finest elements of black
modernism: alienation, primitivism, and experimental form. In a focalized
study positioning Hayden in relation to literary modernism, Robert
Crisman‘s inventories the poet‘s modernist techniques:

> In pursuing this mission, Hayden found that the techniques of high
> modernism, such as irony, allusion, polyglot expression, cinematic
technique, metonymy, and narrative disjunction, were more useful

> Langston Hughes, and Sterling Brown, although he extended the
> resources of those poetics. The dissociative qualities of modernism
> helped Hayden register the uniquely disjunctive yet cohesive aspects
> of Afro-American experience in the Western hemisphere.70

Besides the technique of narrative disjunction that one finds in the
―staccato‖ impressionism of ―[American Journal]‖, we see the use of high
modernist montage in the collage of images presented in fairly rapid
succession by the poet. Characterized by an innovative use of experimental
form and primitivism, modernism exhibits a salient theme of alienation.
Black modernism extends this leitmotif of alienation into a commentary on
the black experience. In ―[American Journal]‖, Hayden takes the theme of
alienation to the extreme: with poetic license, the poet invents a plot device
where an extraterrestrial alien reports on alienation in America. Here the
poet is a visitor from the Red Planet.

The inspiration for ―[American Journal]‖ sprang not from the patriotic
stirrings of a star-spangled banner, but from the musings of a starship
sojourner. ―[American Journal]‖ is a vision of America with a narrative plot
twist: the narrator is an alien from outer space—arguably a Martian—who,
disguising himself as an American, reports his observations to his superiors,
―the Counselors‖, as previously mentioned. Hayden is certainly not the only
African American poet to use science fiction as a plot device. The poetry of
Ahmos Zu-Bolton, for instance, comes to mind. While it might be
interesting to compare ―[American Journal]‖ to other alien observers of
American and African-American culture—alongside the observations of
America recorded by Federico Garcia Lorca in Poet In New York, this would
take us far afield. With anthropological acuity, Hayden‘s alien (alias?) is a
keen observer—verging on the participant observer—recording his first
impressions of the Americans.

As the proverbial ―little green man from Mars‖, the alien explores facets of
American consciousness condensed into rough field notes. Yet Hayden is a
post-modernist without being a postmodernist, since Hayden‘s poetry is
inflected—some have said ―infected‖ or ―inflicted‖—by his Bahá‘í
worldview and values. In his own words, his professed Bahá‘í belief ―in the
fundamental oneness of all races, the essential oneness of mankind, … [and]
the vision of world unity‖71 enables the poet, through the alien‘s
anthropology, ―to affirm the humane, the universal, the potentially divine in
the human creature‖72. In Smith‘s view, Hayden‘s ―practical deployment‖ of
America is ―as a lens through which the ‗universal‘ may be deciphered‖.73 A

psychological odyssey rather than a polished travel narrative, the alien‘s first
impressions of America are Hayden‘s lasting impressions of America—a
psychograph of America, iconic of Earth, in the time-capsule of a social
poem.

In describing the Americans, the poet creates a montage of America itself,
which largely, though not wholly, stands as a metaphor for humanity.
―[American Journal]‖ is Hayden‘s anthropomorphic experiment, his
portrayal of the human predicament through the vantage of the American
dilemma, with only hints of resolution. As stated earlier, how the poem
makes its statement is as distinctive as the statement itself. Edward Pavlic
sees Hayden‘s vision as complex but not chaotic, as problematic yet not
irresolvable. What the poet is engaged in is an irreducibly ―democratic‖
enterprise.

In probing the depths of the ―democratic unconscious‖, Pavlic theorizes that
―Hayden‘s complex poetic vision of the strife and possibility embedded in
America‘s fragmented intra- and inter-racial / cultural landscape‖ is derived,
sustained, and refined in the psychological ―space‖ of the ―democratic
unconscious‖.74 As I understand Pavlic, this is a space, not a place, in which
a democratic encounter is possible where a democratic act is normally not.
Thus ―Hayden explores the ever-shifting, non-rational nature of the
unconscious to create montages of democratic exchange‖.75 In a highly
imaginative process, the poet‘s dramatis personae personify different
aspects of the American experience: the Green Man mediates between the
Black and White without any being the wiser, yet implicitly beckoned to
draw wisdom from it.

In elaborating this notion of the ―democratic unconscious‖ in the oceanic
depth of the shared American experience, ―Hayden‘s Afro-modernism
responds to [Walt] Whitman‘s call by searching out levels of experience and
modes of perception in which figures cannot operate‖.76 The poet ―charts
regions of dangerous possibility and seeks a vision which obeys the laws of
a democratic unconscious‖.77 Arguably, ―[American Journal]‖ best
represents this democratic unconscious, in its dizzying, polyvalent
complexity. In the nine dimensions identified above, a dissonant octave of
social identities is superadded to the splendid self. As a transgressive act, the
alien transects traditional racial and social boundaries. With one narrative
voice, the alien is the vox populi. In ―[American Journal]‖, the voice of
America is a multitude of troubled waters.

Let us now travel back, through space and time, and explore the physical
and social landscape of Hayden‘s vision of America. For economy and
simplicity, excerpts from ―[American Journal]‖ will be identified by their
respective lines in the poem.

Landscape Identity—Origin

Landscape identity, as previously stated, is an association with place. It is a
constructed idea, shaped by experience and modulated in the imagination,
affixed to a real or ideal landscape. ―This quality of inseparability from
landscape distinguishes identity from image,‖ writes Arreola.78 ―[American
Journal]‖ uses landscape identity to trigger an association, in the mind of the
Martian observer, between the red monoliths of Mars and corresponding
grandeur of Earth. This enables the Martian to more easily identify
empathically with the land of America. In a nostalgic reverie of his home
planet, the alien contemplates how the ―beautiful dream like vistas‖ that he
sees end up ―reminding me of / home‖.79 This landscape identity is
reinforced when the narrator notes a specific point of comparison in
bringing the Martian and American landscapes together in his imagination:
―item have seen the rock place known / as garden of the gods and sacred to
the first / indigenes red monoliths of home‖.80 Here, this description of
landscape provides internal evidence of the composition of ―[American
Journal]‖ itself.

There is both extrinsic and intrinsic evidence that Hayden initially
composed this poem in Colorado in 1976. In a letter to Harper, Hayden
writes that he would leave for Colorado Springs on 11 February 1976. 81 In a
previous letter to Hayden, Harper forecasts: ―You‘re going to Colorado
College; that is a beautiful place … the peaks and the landscape will
energize and confirm what you know about this country‖.82 Whatever
Hayden did ―know about this country‖ was eventually memorialized in
―[American Journal]‖—―envisioned as a commentary on ‗our condition‘ for
the bicentenary, which he [Robert Hayden] had delivered at the University
of Michigan as the Phi Beta Kappa poem‖.83 This was likely Hayden‘s first
public reading of ―[American Journal]‖, as Harper elsewhere refers to ―the
Bicentennial poem you read on commencement weekend‖.84 We can be
fairly sure of the place where ―[American Journal]‖ was composed. To what
extent did the poem recompose the Garden of the Gods?

Literary critics and aficionados of Hayden‘s poetry are quite familiar with
the landscape of Detroit‘s ―Paradise Valley,‖ as portrayed in a number of his

Arreola, ―Urban Ethnic Landscape Identity‖, 518.

poetic portraitures or character studies. But here, after a panoramic sweep of
America‘s landscape diversity—‖oceans deserts mountains grain fields
canyons / forests variousness of landscapes weathers / sun light moon
light as at home much here is / beautiful dream like vistas reminding me
of / home‖85—the alien mentions only one place by name: ―item have seen
the rock place known / as garden of the gods and sacred to the first /
indigenes red monoliths of home‖.86 Here, the ―Garden of the Gods‖ is an
unmistakable reference to an American landmark and World Heritage site—
a natural wonder of towering sandstone rock formations set against the
backdrop of snow-capped Pikes Peak, located near Colorado Springs,
Colorado. Vivifying his memories of home (―dream like vistas reminding
me of / home‖), the alien speaks nostalgically of ―red monoliths‖ from
whence he came—the Red Planet, Mars. There is anecdotal evidence for
Mars as the alien‘s origin.

In 1975, Robert Hayden gave Friday night poetry readings at Colorado
College in Colorado Springs. The Garden of the Gods was nearby. Hayden
had visited there with poet Yusef Komunyakaa.87 When Michael S. Harper
gave Komunyakaa a copy of the limited edition of American Journal in
1981, the latter ―was surprised by the title poem,‖ for it evoked images of
the Garden of the Gods: ―I remember how it rekindled sensations and
images of that Colorado afternoon,‖ Komunyakaa recalls. ―I read the poem
repeatedly, each time feeling Hayden‘s presence intensifying,‖ going on to
say:

> The man [Robert Hayden] had a penetrating, indecorous eloquence—
> so does his poetry. I felt linked to this poem personally. ―[American
> Journal]‖ taught me how language and imagination can transform a
> physical landscape into a spiritual one. We had talked about how the
> Garden of the Gods parallels a moonscape, something otherworldly.
> It was from there that Hayden began to orbit his imaginative
> tableau… It seems as if the narrator is on a spiritual quest, that this
> voyage into the brutal frontier of the American experience is a
> confrontation with his own alienation. He is transported through the
> power of reflection (the mind as spacecraft) in order to arrive at the
> scary truth of his species.88

So the Garden of the Gods doubles as America‘s landscape and Martian
lunarscape. It has long inspired poets. In 1893, the stunning view from its
14,110-foot summit prompted Katharine Lee Bates to compose the poem
that became the lyrics for America‘s unofficial national anthem, ―America
the Beautiful‖. Against this panoramic ―purple mountain majesty,‖ the giant
pinnacles of ―Garden of the Gods‖ are ochre in color. Sculpted by the forces

of erosion, these reddish sandstone edifices are almost otherworldly in
appearance, suggestive of a Martian craterscape, bearing striking
resemblance to the alien visitor‘s home planet. Mars has fascinated
Americans and people the world over. In ―[American Journal],‖ we see a
reciprocal enchantment. Indeed, 1976 was the year that U.S. Viking 1
landed on Mars at Chryse Planitia on July 20, marking the first Martian
landing. So why not a Martian landing on Earth?

Drawn as the Martian is to the American landscape, the space voyager is
attracted to the Americans themselves, who, for him, hold their own
fascination. It is really in their psychic profile that Hayden is most
interested. And so it is that ―Robert Hayden‘s poetry exemplifies the psychic
landscape of the stranger‖.89 As a stranger in a strange land, the alien will
explore the polyvalent orbitals of the American psyche, oscillating between
individual and collective spheres of thought. The physical American
landscape is a point of departure for the Martian‘s observations of the
American psychic landscape.

Alien Identity—Individualism

We must not forget to factor into the equation of identity interplay the
alien‘s own self-identity. Already the alien has found much that reminds him
of home. Reminiscent of his home planet Mars, the Garden of the Gods is
an erstwhile wilderness of alien identities. We will treat these more neutrally
as simply individual identities.

―Alien‖—in Hayden‘s adroit use of it—has a double meaning. At the outset,
the reader is not immediately aware that the narrator is himself an alien—an
extraterrestrial from outer space (probably a Martian, as suggested above).
Yet the term is introduced early in the poem: ―how best describe these aliens
in my / reports to The Counselors‖.90 Of course, whatever meaning attaches
to the word ―alien‖ is entirely perspectival. Here, ―these aliens‖ are the
Americans, who are relative aliens in relation to the real alien, except that
the real alien is a fiction and the alienated Americans are a social fact. While
this plot device is contrived, it is a vehicle for social commentary. An irony
obtains here in that our intergalactic traveler is the real alien. On first blush,
this would appear to be a minor flaw in the poem. But Hayden is masterfully
aware of his use of identity here. Adroitly, he assumes the persona of the
alien, to who all others, apart from his own kind, are regarded as aliens,
much as many Americans those of non-traditional national origins as aliens,
even if the aliens are natural of naturalized citizens. Of course, the alien is
ever-vigilant so as not to give himself away. In this respect, he has to
assimilate for his own protection.

Michael Antonucci, ―The Map and the Territory: An Interview with Michael S. Harper‖, African
American Review 2000, 34(3), 501–508. (See 501.)

Quite obviously, then the Americans are the object of the real alien‘s
mission and the subject of his report. But we do not know who ―The
Counselors‖ are, except that they are his putative audience, not the poet‘s
intended audience. The Counselors are a prop, a backdrop, an absent
presence. Like the alien, The Counselors are creatures of the poet‘s
invention. They are also apropos of us, the readers, as we have been
privileged to intercept this communication. Since poems don‘t normally
operate as science fiction, this narrative device is novel, even for Hayden.
So, yes, the plot is bizarre, but it ―works‖. What, then, is Hayden‘s own
rationale for writing a poem about America in this strange way? Harper
explains:

> In a ―Voice of America‖ program taped at the Library of Congress in
> 1976 during Negro History Month and rebroadcast all over Africa
> and Eastern Europe, he [Robert Hayden] said he wanted to bring
> people (poets) together. ―[American Journal]‖, his bicentennial
> poem, was the Phi Beta Kappa poem at the University of Michigan;
> he was unsure of the version he had and many others he‘d written.
> ―Poets work for what they get,‖ he often quipped—―Imagine this a
> found manuscript, or an interior monologue inside the mind of a
> Being from somewhere else; the Being‘s forgotten his travel kit of
> words and he aint sorry.‖91

Hayden worked and reworked his poems. So nurtured, they matured. Each
poem practically took on a life of its own, as a psychic envelope of some
artistic impulse of Hayden‘s as the master craftsman that he was, he aimed
for perfection. Yet at some point, a Hayden piece would become fixed,
timeless. In the case of ―[American Journal]‖, the variant versions are now
lost in psychic space. The version of ―[American Journal]‖ that is typeset in
lead is now carved in stone. Note that one thing remains the same: the
Hayden analogizes himself as ―a Being from somewhere else‖.

In ―[American Journal],‖ that mission is to reconnoitre America: ―here
among them the americans this baffling / multi people extremes and
variegations their / noise restlessness their almost frightening / energy
how best describe these aliens in my / reports to The Counselors / disguise
myself in order to study them unobserved‖.92 To observe, the observer must
be unobserved. At least to all outward appearances, the alien will succeed in
his disguise only to the extent that he melts into the great American ―melting
pot‖. This is no mean feat. How, then, does the alien accomplish this?

To analogize to an American Indian myth, the alien is something of a shape-
shifter—a therianthropic skin-walker who can metamorphose into any form
of American citizen that he wishes to mimic. From Proteus in Greek myth to

Harper, ―The Metaphysics of American Journal‖, 37.

the cryptozoological thunderbirds of American Indian lore, the shape-shifter
has most recently taken popular shape in science fiction television series,
the X Files. While no commentator has described the alien in quite these
terms, the alien‘s self-description indicates that he can, at will, appear in
whatever form he desires: ―though i have easily passed for an american in /
bankers grey afro and dashiki long hair and jeans / hard hat yarmulka mini
skirt‖.93 Parenthetically, Derik Smith comments that Hayden personally
―never wore an afro, much less a dashiki‖.94 It should be added that the
Martian can shape-shift somatically, but not psychically.

So the alien has ―easily passed for an american‖. He even boasts of his ―skill
in mimicry‖: ―describe in some / detail for the amusement of The
Counselors and / though my skill in mimicry is impeccable as / indeed
The Counselors are aware‖.95 Yet the alien‘s mimicry is not complete. His is
not a perfect disguise. His accent finally gives him away: ―notice you got a
funny accent pal like where / you from he asked far from here i mumbled
/ he stared hard i left / must be more careful‖.96 This was a close call—a
narrow escape from discovery. He won‘t let it happen again the next time:
―item learn to use okay / their pass word okay‖.97 Later in the poem, as if
for emphasis, the alien registers the same fear of being discovered again:
―exert greater caution twice have aroused / suspicion returned to the ship
until rumors / of humanoids from outer space so their scoff / ing media
voices termed us had been laughed / away my crew and i laughed too of
course‖.98

Despite its levity in providing a moment of comic relief, this scene brings
into bold relief the circumscribed view held by Americans of their own
reality. But it‘s no laughing matter, really, even though the alien and his
fellow Martians are amused (―my crew and i laughed too of course‖). For
the alien ―can only exist in the American context if he prostitutes his
individuality through ‗mimicry‘ and assimilation,‖ Komunyakaa observes.99
―The speaker is raceless, without gender or genus, but knows this fearful
sense of otherness that had driven most Americans into the psychological
melting pot‖.100 Our procrustean Green Man dons skins of varying hues,
telegraphing a skein of lies about his racial, even human, identity. Yet it
takes a non-human to raise the issue of common humanity in a world where
race identity can trump human identity and its egalitarian imperatives.

Racial Identity—Prejudice

Naturally the very subject matter of ―[American Journal]‖ implicates racial
identity in the American social context. Racial identity—a highly contested
term—is defined by Helms as ―psychological or internalized consequence of
being socialized in a racially oppressive environment and the characteristics
of self that develop in response to or in synchrony with either benefiting
from or suffering under such oppression‖.101 Racial identity may be more
critically defined as follows:

> The concept of racial identity, in particular, has been misunderstood
> and contested. Some meanings are derived from its biological
> dimension and others from its social dimension. As a biological
> category, race is derived from an individual‘s ―physical features,
> gene pools and character qualities‖. … However, looking beyond
> these characteristics, there are more similarities than differences
> between racial groups and more differences than similarities within
> these groups. Today, literary and theoretical manifestations of racial
> identity are discussed not in biological terms (which may imply a
> racist perspective) but as a social construction, which ―refers to a
> sense of group or collective identity based on one‘s perception that
> he or she shares a common heritage with a particular racial group‖.102

Obviously this definition sees race as a social construct, internalized within
the subjective experience of being a member of a racial group. Fellow poet
and friend Michael S. Harper notes that ―[American Journal]‖ reflects
Hayden‘s ―new poetic resolve to speak freely about America‘s conundrum,
race and identity‖.103 This freedom to speak about America‘s racial crisis
necessarily entailed Hayden‘s freedom to speak about its solution.

The alien goes not have a great deal to say about racism in America, as that
is only one of its social problematics. He places racism in perspective. True,
racism, as such, may be unfamiliar to the alien. Yet the alien‘s powers of
transmogrification would inevitably attract racist reactions—or so one
would think. After all, this proverbial ―little green man from Mars‖ in can
change the color of his skin at will. Without wishing to be trite or cute,
Hayden‘s narrator might be succinctly described as a ―morphing Martian‖.
With ability to assume sundry physiognomic characteristics, the alien is a
racial chameleon. Among his ersatz identities, he could be black at will—
―though i have easily passed for an american in / bankers grey afro and

dashiki long hair and jeans‖,104 notwithstanding that ―afro and dashiki‖ were
never Hayden‘s manner of dress, personally or professionally. Did the
alien‘s ability to appear African American authenticate his insights on
racism?

Unlike the poet personally, the persona here is not explicitly the victim of
racism. Yet he clearly sees racism as victimizing: ―adapting their varied
pigmentations      white black / red brown yellow           the imprecise and
strangering / distinctions by which they live by which they / justify their
cruelties to one another‖.105 Racism is a polarizing pigment of the
imagination, which is why it is so ―imprecise‖. Yet its real effect is
alienation, which the alien notes in his exquisite description of it as
―strangering‖. A rare word, as noted above, ―strangering‖ does not quite
qualify as a Hayden-esque neologism. But it is an effective transformation
of the noun ―stranger‖ into a transitive verb (here, a present participle acting
as a verbal modifier). The objects of the verb ―to stranger‖ are not mere
grammatical objects. They are flesh-and-blood victims, both psychically and
socially.

The alien‘s observations on race, while thematically essential to ―[American
Journal],‖ are not predominant. Race issues are treated in a rather matter-of-
fact way. This is not to say that the alien is dismissive of race. He neither
trivializes race nor minimizes its importance. It‘s just that race cannot be
atomized by abstracting it away from the concomitant social problems that
he sees in American society. The alien does not weigh their relative gravity.
Again, as Rampersad has noted, ―Hayden knew his country and its
condition, and saw it whole,‖ Arnold Rampersad observes.106 Racial identity
is extrinsic when a person is the victim of racial prejudice. Racial identity is
intrinsic when a person relishes in racial pride. Thus, racial pride and
prejudice are two sides of the same coin—the social construct in which
superficial biological differences acquire pervasive social significance, both
intrinsically and extrinsically.

There are, moreover, degrees or stages of a person‘s subjective identification
with race. Helms‘s People of Color Racial Identity Model incorporates and
scales five psychosocial statuses pertaining to the subjective experience of
race: (1) conformity, (2) dissonance, (3) immersion/emersion, (4)
internalization, and (5) integrative awareness.107 It is this ―integrative
awareness‖ that the poet implicitly—and Robert Hayden explicitly, in the
course of interviews—stresses as a key indicator of societal maturity.

At this juncture, it is perhaps appropriate to say a few words regarding
Robert Hayden‘s worldview as a Bahá‘í on the issue of race. Robert Hayden
was dedicated to the ideal of racial harmony as a religious principle. Born of
his values as an outspoken adherent of the Bahá‘í Faith, naturally this
posture distanced him somewhat from the separatist ideology of key Black
Arts figures. In this respect, Hayden‘s philosophy of art was far closer to
that of the Harlem Renaissance, resonating especially with the outlook of its
acknowledged ―Dean‖ and the genius behind the movement, Alain Locke.
Like Hayden, Locke was part of the Bahá‘í community, the latter having
embraced the Bahá‘í Faith in 1918.108 Hayden later contributed the
introduction to the Atheneum edition of Locke‘s The New Negro in 1968
(Locke).109 Pairing Hayden with Locke enabled Derik Smith to draw ―a
heretetofore-unacknowledged thread in African-American literary history
which links these two figures by way of their common belief in the Bahá‘í
Faith‖ and to ―locate Hayden in a long tradition of ‗black Americanism‘‖.110

Hayden‘s contact with the Bahá‘í Faith was by way of marriage. In June
1940, Hayden married Erma Inez Morris, a music tutor and concert pianist,
who worked as a public school teacher in Detroit, supporting Hayden‘s
lifestyle as a struggling artist. Consistent with her unflagging support of his
dream of becoming a great poet, eventually they decided that Robert should
go back to graduate school at the University of Michigan. Soon after
moving to Ann Arbor in 1941, Erma embraced the Bahá‘í Faith, a new
world religion promoting racial harmony, religious reconciliation and ideal
international relations, with more than 2,100 ethnic groups and tribes
represented among its 5.5 million adherents currently.

In America, Bahá‘ís took seriously a statement issued in 1938 by Shoghi
Effendi (who led the Bahá‘í world from 1921–1957) that racism was
America‘s ―most challenging issue‖: ―As to racial prejudice, the corrosion
of which, for well-nigh a century, has bitten into the fiber, and attacked the
whole social structure of American society, it should be regarded as
constituting the most vital and challenging issue confronting the Bahá‘í
community at the present stage of its evolution‖.111 For American Bahá‘ís,
racism remained an ―issue of paramount importance,‖ calling for the
exercise of ―care and vigilance‖, ―moral courage and fortitude‖, and
consummate ―tact and sympathy‖ in the interactions between white and
black.112

In 1991, eleven years after Hayden‘s death, the National Spiritual Assembly
of the Bahá‘ís of the United States (the annually elected Bahá‘í

administrative council that oversees the American Bahá‘í community)
issued its policy statement, The Vision of Race Unity: America’s Most
Challenging Issue,113 thus keeping alive the Bahá‘í commitment to the racial
harmony efforts that began in Washington, D.C. in May 1921 with the first
―Race Amity Conference‖ organized with the assistance of Dr. Alain Locke
of Howard University.114

Inspired and fired by the Bahá‘í ideal of racial harmony both in America and
abroad, Hayden—while still a graduate student studying under his literary
mentor, W. H. Auden—joined the Bahá‘ís in 1943.115 The basic beliefs of
the Bahá‘í Faith are essentialized by Hayden as follows:

> I believe in the essential oneness of all people and I believe in the
> basic unity of all religions. I don‘t believe that races are important; I
> think that people are important. I‘m very suspicious of any form of
> ethnicity or nationalism; I think that these things are very crippling
> and are very divisive. These are all Bahá‘í points of view, and my
> work grows out of this vision.116

The fact that the Hayden Papers (HP) are preserved in the National Bahá‘í
Archives is just one indication of the primacy of Robert Hayden‘s Bahá‘í
identity.117 Hayden‘s commitment to interracial harmony notwithstanding, in
―[American Journal]‖, one detects the voice of distinctly, if de-familiarized,
black-critical observations, where the narrator‘s ambiguous observations
resonate powerfully with the classic features of double-consciousness in the
sense that W. E. B. Du Bois so powerfully articulated it.

In ―[American Journal]‖, racial identity is not salient. It is one of various
aspects of American identity. Race is but one lens through which the alien
views America. But race is not panoptic. Even as a critical theory, race is not
all-seeing. Trouble brews on other fronts as well.

Political Identity—Partisanship

The year presumably is 1976, and the alien reports a violent public
disturbance that he has just witnessed: ―crowds gathering in the streets today
for some / reason obscure to me noise and violent motion / repulsive
physical contact sentinels pigs / i heard them called with flailing clubs
rage / and bleeding and frenzy and screaming            machines / wailing

unbearable decibels‖.118 The ―and…and…and‖ construction of line 57
suggests a breathless and hypertensive report, what the law of evidence
might call an ―excited utterance‖ made under the stress of excitement before
there was time to ―cool‖. Unlike the poem‘s earlier reference to the ―Garden
of the Gods‖,119 the time, place, and manner of the public disturbance here
are indeterminate. All we know is that there‘s something happening in the
streets. It is dissent in the form of a public demonstration.

The precise details of this public disturbance are lacking. We can match this
scene with any number of possible scenarios drawn from that tumultuous
era. What the alien reports appears to have begun as a demonstration. This is
implied by ―crowds gathering in the streets today‖—a day in the life of
America in 1976, but lacking here in the ―spirit of ‗76‖. Things got out of
hand. The demonstration escalated into a violent melee or even a riot. The
alien can neither tell us the purpose of the demonstration or what incident
sparked the unrest. It all came about for a ―reason obscure to me‖.120 We can
try to guess, even to pinpoint what event Hayden may have had in mind.
The Vietnam War had just ended, and one can neither assume nor exclude
the occurrence of a race riot here. These facts, for instance, fit with a
demonstration that took place in South Boston on 15 February 1976—a
march that ended in a clash with police. The time period is clearly the
1970s, as ―pigs‖ came into vogue as pejorative slang for ―police‖: ―sentinels
pigs / i heard them called‖.121

In any event, the alien is exposed to profound social alienation. This
external violence is an outward manifestation of the harsh psychic energies
that disturbed the alien‘s sensitive equilibrium and probably shocked his
conscience as well: ―i fled lest / vibrations of the brutal scene do further
harm / to my metabolism already over taxed‖.122 Such scenes, which assault
the observer‘s sensibilities as well as the dissenters themselves, show that
Americans are not always able to resolve their internal conflicts in a
democratic way. Dissenters are painfully alive to America‘s contradictions,
and are dismissive of these ―hypocrisies‖: ―a divided / people seeking
reassurance from a past few under / stand and many scorn why should we
sanction / old hypocrisies thus dissenters The Counse / lors would silence
them‖123.

In contrast with open dissent is a begrudging acceptance of the way things
are. When cynicism sets in, some Americans accept their lot in life rather
than protest against it. Social mobility is often not an option for those
trapped in a disadvantaged class. The alien finds out about the American

Dream in a tavern, in conversation with one who has long lost the sense of
moral outrage that drives public protest and dissent.

Class Identity—The American

Class identity surfaces in the only scene in which the alien records a direct
contact with an ―earth man‖. The topic is the venerable, yet elusive,
―American Dream‖: ―something they call the american dream sure / we
still believe in it i guess an earth man / in the tavern said‖.124 The alien is a
good listener, and, presumably on a barstool over a glass of beer, takes in
the American‘s reflections on successes and shortcomings of the American
Dream. First, the promise of prosperity is given a down-to-earth definition:
―means every body in the good old u s a / should have the chance to get
ahead or at least / should have three squares a day‖.125 Clearly the Dream
failed the informant as he seems not to have got ahead—the consolation
being that ―as for myself / i do okay not crying hunger with a loaf of /
bread tucked under my arm you understand‖.126 By his own admission, the
American Dream has failed to provide hardly more than a daily loaf of
bread for someone who simply ekes out his existence on the economic edge.
And hence this valid criticism of the American economy: ―irregardless of
the some / times night mare facts we always try to double / talk our way
around and its okay the dreams / okay and means whats good could be a
damn sight / better‖.127

The American Dream is, at once, ―okay‖ yet not okay, even though the
tavern informant says that he himself does ―okay‖. ―Okay‖ is a far cry from
the ideal. The American Dream, so utterly unattainable for so many, has
been reduced, for those Americans living below the poverty line, to mere
survival rather than economic prosperity. This distinction is lost on the alien.
It‘s too fine a point. Not surprisingly, the alien is confused: ―i / fear one does
not clearly follow i replied‖.128 Komunyakaa comments that ―the narrator,
after further reflection of our society, records the American Dream as a great
lie—a cultural materialism based on illusions and paradoxes‖.129 The alien
pierces the veil of the corporate American illusion: ―As an outsider himself,
he is able to ridicule this illusion, orchestrated by our mythmakers, because
he, a humanoid, like others who are physically or culturally ‗different,‘ are
not welcomed into American society, let alone given access to the means of
attaining the Dream‖.130

At this moment in the tavern scene, the alien‘s alien identity is almost given
away: ―notice you got a funny accent pal like where / you from he asked

far from here i mumbled / he stared hard i left / must be more careful item
learn to use okay / their pass word okay‖.131 Although it certainly could
have been his accent, the alien‘s awkward syntax betrays him as foreign (―i /
fear one does not clearly follow‖). There is nothing incorrect about it. It‘s
just that such stilted syntax does not sound like everyday speech.
Komunyakaa notes that the alien, generally, records his observations in a
―fractured syntax‖ that ―highlights the narrator‘s alienation, as if spoken by
a foreigner striving to grasp the structure and nuances of a new
language‖.132

Paradox and oxymoron are two of Hayden‘s ubiquitous poetic devices. The
American Dream is one such oxymoron. ―The narrator … employs the
oxymorons in a satirical, almost cynical way,‖ Komunyakaa points out, ―to
articulate the supreme contradiction of our culture, the American Dream‖.133
Like the alien‘s fractured syntax, the American Dream is a fractured
ideology: ―have seen / the squalid ghettoes in their violent cities / paradox
on paradox how have the americans / managed to survive‖.134 The alien
learns of the American Dream, but it is beyond his immediate
comprehension. The surface reading is that the alien doesn‘t understand the
American Dream. There are too many contradictions to reconcile. Yet the
alien understands all too well: Americans for whom the Dream is both
elusive and illusory ―may as well be on Mars,‖ as the American saying goes.
For all its successes and failings, the American Dream has accompanied the
rise of American consumerism and materialism.

Material Identity—Technocratic Materialism

The distinction between class identity and materialism is that the former is
extrinsic and the latter intrinsic. While the alien does not indicate whether
class divides Martian society, he does indicate that a reliance on
mechanization to make life more leisurely (―like us they have created a
veritable populace / of machines‖), but does not state that this is the case to
the same degree. Among the Americans, ―many it appears worship the
Unknowable / Essence the same for them as for us but are / more faithful
to their machine made gods / technologists their shamans‖.135 Although
Martians also worship the Unknowable Essence, as do Americans, the
Americans are described as more attached to their robotic marvels and the
celebrated (one might say, quasi-deified) scientists who invented them.
America is awash in a sea of materialism that has left its imprint on the
sandy desert-scape of the moon: ―like us they have created a veritable
populace / of machines that serve and soothe and pamper / and entertain
we have seen their flags and / foot prints on the moon also the intricate /

Komunyakaa, ―Journey into ‗[American Journal]‘‖, 333.

Ibid., lines 22–25.

rubbish left behind a wastefully ingenious / people‖.136 Thus the problem is
not exclusively American. Ever the keen observer, the alien notes that the
mechanization of society is as spiritually alienating as it is technologically
liberating. From the alien‘s perspective, materialism is a fact of
technological advancement. Yet economic values need to be constrained by
human values in order to right the imbalance. Materialism is predicated on
hedonic values and economic interests, while spiritual identity is
traditionally anchored in human values and in belief in a higher power, in a
Supreme Being, which is the ground of all reality.

Religious Identity—Mysticism

One literary critic rightly notes that ―[American Journal]‖ is further
evidence of Hayden‘s ―preoccupation with the relationship between natural
and spiritual facts‖.137 Critics have long noted that Hayden illuminates the
invisible, spiritual reality of human existence. This was not always so.
Hayden‘s early works, particularly those published in the 1940s, are
primarily ―echoes—less successful ones—of prominent Harlem
Renaissance writings.‖138 William Hansell further observes that Hayden, in
his mature work, ―has attempted to portray all human activity as essentially
a spiritual journey, often grotesquely distorted, towards sanctity‖ and, in so
doing, represents ―the essential oneness of the divinity, of humanity, and of
the universe in a variety of ways.‖139 To do so is not easy. A purely thematic
interest will not succeed; only a mastery of the poetic craft can vivify the
invisible. ―Artistically, what distinguished Hayden most was his fusing of
history and symbol, of the natural and the spiritual,‖ the present writer has
previously noted, ―to achieve an ‗intensification of reality‘ that triggers
flashes of social insight, with unity as a touchstone of truth‖.140 True to the
rest of Hayden‘s mature work, ―[American Journal]‖ does explore the
spiritual dimension of the American psyche. The Americans are not godless,
of course. But slavish attachment to ―their machine made gods‖ renders
them functionally godless.

While the audience surely knows that Americans, as a nation, profess belief
in a Supreme Being, readers may not know that this is what is meant by the
term, ―Unknowable Essence‖: ―many it appears worship the Unknowable /
Essence the same for them as for us‖.141 Punctuation emblazons this phrase
in conceptual neon lights: ―Unknowable Essence‖ is the only capitalized
phrase in the entire poem, with the exception of recurring references to the
alien‘s superiors, identified only as ―The Counselors‖.

Buck, ―Robert Hayden‖, 181.

This publicly unfamiliar reference to the ―Unknowable Essence‖ is quite
familiar to adherents (with Hayden among them) of the Bahá‘í Faith, which
conceptualizes God as the source and ultimate common denominator of both
physical and social universes: ―To every discerning and illuminated heart it
is evident that God, the unknowable Essence, the Divine Being, is
immensely exalted beyond every human attribute, such as corporeal
existence, ascent and descent, egress and regress. Far be it from His glory
that human tongue should adequately recount His praise, or that human
heart comprehend His fathomless mystery. He is, and hath ever been, veiled
in the ancient eternity of His Essence, and will remain in His Reality
everlastingly hidden from the sight of men‖.142 This citation is just one
exemplar of the normative use of the ―Unknowable Essence‖ in Bahá‘í
discourse as a reference to God. Therefore Hayden‘s use of this distinct term
of theological art gives the poet‘s Bahá‘í identity away, and could even
suggest that the alien himself participates in a planetization of that global
perspective.

Poets and literary critics know very well that Robert Hayden was a public
Bahá‘í—as already discussed in the section on ―Racial Identity‖ above.
However, that the phrase, ―Unknowable Essence‖ is a distinctively Bahá‘í
metaphysical term is certainly not common knowledge. While Hayden was
occasionally explicit in his Bahá‘í identity—and would often, in his public
poetry readings, preface certain poems with reference to Bahá‘í themes—
Hayden is religiously recondite here.

In ―[American Journal]‖, the alien employs the ―Unknowable Essence‖ as
an intergalactic concept (―many it appears worship the Unknowable /
Essence the same for them as for us‖). ―And as Hayden reminds us,‖ Harper
observes, ―the ‗unknowable essence‘ is what we, as Americans and
extraterrestrials, have in common‖. As Hayden‘s long-time friend and fellow
poet, Harper represents Hayden‘s perspective as his own in concluding:
―This means to me that we have neglected the largest part of our inheritance,
the efficacy of religion as a faith in the future that might bind us all‖.143
Neglect of the spiritual does not, however, detract from ―God and country‖
as a hallmark of American nationalism.

American Identity—Nationalism

celebration: ―parades fireworks displays video spectacles / much

achieved identity‖.144 One can almost see the fireworks overhead. The most
revered symbols of America evoke treasured moments in American history.
Here, Smith notes that Hayden ―simultaneously equips: the alien with the
capacity for a nuanced appreciation of America‘s defining narratives: The
paradox of the nation‘s history, its failure to practice its lofty egalitarian
ideals, and the brutality of its internal conflicts, all register distinctly in his
observations‖.145 This is civil religion in its most ceremonial form in
grandiloquent public display.

Part of this patriotic pageant is the parading of a beauty queen: ―blonde miss
teen age / america waving from a red white and blue flower / float as the
goddess of liberty a divided / people seeking reassurance from a past few
under / stand and many scorn‖146. Since the Miss Teenage America Pageant
was held on 27 November 1976, the blond beauty here must be Miss
Teenage America for 1975. Here, from a float festooned with patriotic
colors, the nubile beauty beams a patriotic message. She is draped in
American aesthetic values, costumed as the Statue of Liberty, symbolizing
America in a Fourth of July parade, where American ideals are on display,
but not on trial. Yet ―the sentiment that accretes as the narrative unfolds is a
negative one that figures nostalgic Americana as empty rhetoric‖.147 This
empty rhetoric, however, is filled with unfulfilled meaning.

So Miss America incarnates Lady Liberty. This facade, however, is not a
charade, for it has taken on the trappings of the American civil religion and
is invested with national mythology and its associated values. They are
celebrated, not denigrated. The alien can personally relate to this by
analogizing the American heritage to his own heritage: ―we too recall / that
struggle as enterprise of suffering and / faith uniquely theirs‖.148 Here,
American identity has taken on religious overtones, for it is a ―faith
uniquely theirs‖. The fact that Lady Liberty is represented by a blonde-
haired, blue-eyed Miss Teenage America perhaps represents an arrested
stage in the nation‘s social evolution—an adolescent phase of turmoil in its
continuing identity crisis—on the path of its maturity as it realizes its proper
world role within the international community. Times will change and so
will standards of beauty—and the reach and ken of that central American
value: Liberty.

A key phrase earlier in the poem is ―vaunted liberty‖: ―item their vaunted /
liberty no body pushes me around i have heard / them say land of the free
they sing what do / they fear mistrust betray more than the freedom / they
boast of in their ignorant pride‖.149 That freedom is not all that it purports to
be. Freedom is betrayed throughout American history—from the institution

of slavery (originally supported in the U.S. Constitution until the Thirteenth
Amendment was ratified in 1865), to the decimation of the American Indian,
and to the lesser (yet no less pervasive) inequalities that effectively curtail
social mobility. ―Like a mortified anthropologist,‖ Komunyakaa comments,
―the narrator renames our dream as vaunted liberty and typically compares
America with the more evolved society from which he traveled: ‗we are an
ancient race and have outgrown / illusions cherished here‘‖.150 One way to
sum up the alien‘s portrayal of the myth of America is to see it as ―a split
image of the American heritage‖151—a double consciousness of the ideal
versus the real.

Ultimately, America defies description: ―america as much a problem in
metaphysics as / it is a nation earthly entity an iota in our / galaxy an
organism that changes even as i / examine it fact and fantasy never twice
the / same so many variables‖.152 Commenting on these lines, Fred Fetrow
remarks: ―Yet the literary critic who would trace the evolution of Hayden‘s
poetic voice, who would analyze and explicate his over four decades of
work, must begin by identifying with the speaker in ‗American Journal,‘ as
that otherworldly analyst expresses the frustration of trying to generalize
about an ever-changing phenomenon‖.153 Here, the critic implies that the
alien as Hayden himself, although others have cautioned against it. In any
case, America has had its share of observers, who have yet to reach anything
approaching a consensus on the essence of what it is to be American. But,
then, this would be essentialism at its crassest.

The most famous lines in ―[American Journal]‖ are surely these: ―america
as much a problem in metaphysics as / it is a nation‖.154 Here
―metaphysics‖—a term that Aristotle coined and traditionally regarded as
the ―the Queen of Sciences‖—represents the alien‘s attempts to understand
the fundamental nature of American social reality. This is an impossible
task, for America has ―so many variables‖. It wriggles under its pin, quickly
moves out of focus, and defies precise description: ―some thing / eludes me
some constant amid the variables / defies analysis and imitation will i be
judged / incompetent‖.155 Here, the alien‘s ―incompetence‖ is really a
testament to his competence. He avoids the pitfall of hasty generalization.
The only equation the alien posits is the function of identity as capital and
catalyst for social change. And this may be the key: perhaps America‘s
identity is bound up in its self-transformation—its inventive reinventions of
itself in chrysalid transparency—as it arcs on a teleological path of social
evolution. This progress is coefficient with America‘s relationship to the rest

of the world, leading to the final dimension of American identity: human
identity.

Integrative (Human) Identity—Globalism

The key element here is anthropomorphic geocentrism placed in the context
of social maturity. At the outset of the poem, the alien describes the
Americans as though they represented the inhabitants of the entire earth.
Hence he uses a global frame of reference to situate human beings within
the grand scheme of things: ―charming savages enlightened primitives
brash / new comers lately sprung up in our galaxy how / describe them do
they indeed know what or who / they are do not seem to yet no other
beings / in the universe make more extravagant claims / for their
importance and identity‖.156 The geocentric, overweening hubris of
humanity as a whole is in view here. ―Indeed, the ‗humanoid‘ among us
narrates as might a Western anthropologist, descending into the wilds of his
galaxy to do fieldwork,‖ writes Komunyakaa. ―He uses outdated jargon—
charming savages and enlightened primitives—to describe us‖.157 From the
alien‘s vantage, the Americans are ―primitives‖ in terms of their social
evolution, but nonetheless progressive (―enlightened‖). That ―no other
beings / in the universe make more extravagant claims / for their importance
and identity‖ could be interpreted as American exceptionalism, but the
overarching sense is that the ―Americans‖ are really ―homo sapiens‖
collectively.

Conclusions

Michael S. Harper was right in characterizing ―[American Journal]‖ as
America‘s ―bicentennial poem‖.158 The poem earns this distinction not
merely by dint of its special circumstances, by what it does: ―Artistically,
what distinguished Hayden most was his fusing of history and symbol, of
the natural and the spiritual, to achieve an ‗intensification of reality‘ that
triggers flashes of social insight, with unity as a touchstone of truth‖.159 In
―[American Journal]‖ Hayden fuses the fresh perspective of alien observer
in place of the jaded clichés into which so much of American collective self-
reflection had fallen. Hayden employs a novel plot device to trigger fresh
social insights. As a character, our Martian is somewhat ridiculous. Yet the
alien is ridiculous in the sublime. The Martian is a perfect mask for the poet
as social commentator. In the form of anthropological notes recorded with
ethnographic exactitude, ―[American Journal]‖ is a the fictive document of
the recorded observations of an alien who initially knows nothing of

America, yet has so much to say about it. The poem radiates the alien‘s (and
the artist‘s) fascination with America, involving both repulsion and
attraction. Indeed, the metaphor of the alien offers more than detached
neutrality. It richly imagines a first impression of Americans in order to
convey a lasting impression of them. Yet one must not be misled by the fact
that the alien speaker of Hayden‘s poem speaks as an outsider, thus giving
merely surface observations, far from defining the core. Rather, an exquisite
irony obtains here, in the alien‘s first impressions are not only lasting
impressions but are penetrating impression in that they are socially incisive
in an albeit naïve way.

Although not his finest poem, ―[American Journal]‖ is a singular
achievement in that it articulates a major social poet‘s vision of America. In
its own highly imaginative way, ―[American Journal]‖ represents ―a
traveler‘s perspective of our American experience‖. This, after all, is
Hayden‘s leitmotif, ―his most striking theme‖.160 ―[American Journal]‖ has
thus earned its place as ―America‘s Bicentennial Poem‖, and thus has
potential to enrich our American heritage accordingly, once greater
significance is attached to this poem and a wider audience is attracted.
Using the most outlandish plot device, it succeeds as a commentary on the
meaning of America, while falling short of defining it. This is by design.
The consummate craftsman, Hayden knew what he was doing. Unasked, he
invites each reader to complete that meaning.

As for the science fiction that animates ―[American Journal]‖ itself, there is
the question of the identity of the alien narrator. The poet is the alien (from
the standpoint of artifice), but is the alien the poet? Frankly, scholars are
divided on this question. The alien is, after all, simply a persona. Poet-
generated characters are often based on socially-constructed identities. It
could thus be argued that Hayden‘s alien narrator is not so much the
construction of an identity as that of a character—a character offers an alien
perspective on America. Notwithstanding, because ―[American Journal]‖
was written during Hayden‘s tenure as ―America‘s Bicentennial Poet-
Laureate,‖ the present writer is more inclined to see Hayden‘s fictive
character as more or less aligned with Hayden‘s own character with respect
to the alien‘s characterization of the American national character. Yet it was
the poetic conceit of green skin that allowed him to transcend racial
distinctions in order to make some sense of them (concluding that
racialism‘s didn‘t make sense). Alien or not, Hayden was a man of many
hues, a people‘s poet, and the alien is a people‘s social commentator.

While there is aesthetic distance between the artist and his art, Hayden‘s
Americanism is incompletely expressed. For a complete—that is, positive—
formulation of Hayden‘s vision of America, we must look beyond

Vilma Raskin Potter, ―A Remembrance for Robert Hayden, 1913–1980‖, MELUS 1981, 8(1), 51–
55\. (See 51.)

―[American Journal]‖ itself, and consult the interviews that Hayden gave to
journalists. To the extent that it can illuminate the poem, we can reference
the poet‘s personal vision of America. Until his death in 1980, Robert
Hayden served as poetry editor for World Order magazine (a quarterly
publication of the National Spiritual Assembly of the Bahá‘ís of the United
States), which publishes on topics of broad social concern from a Bahá‘í
perspective. In 1976, World Order decided to publish an interview with him.
Hayden was asked: ―The country is getting ready to celebrate the
Bicentennial of its founding. What does America mean to you? Are you
proud to be an American?‖ Hayden replied:

> Well it means a great deal to me … I wouldn‘t say that I am proud
> exactly, for I regard racial and national pride as a rather dubious
> value, as something which tends to be divisive—to exclude. America
> is home to me, the country in which I can work most effectively.
> Although, as the poet Claude McKay said, ―She feeds me bread of
> bitterness,‖ I have a deep love for my country; I feel very much a
> part of it despite some sense of alienation.161

This ―alienation‖ that Hayden experiences on a personal level registers as an
―alien nation‖ at a collective level. Thus, through a novel plot device, the
poet succeeds in gaining poetic authority in place of a scientific one. As
Robert Hayden‘s quintessential statement on America, it takes a fictive
―alien‖ (the protagonist of ―[American Journal]‖) to show how truly self-
alienating America has become. While America defies precise definition
(―an organism that changes even as i / examine it‖), it is in great need of
redefinition. It is ultimately up to each of us to individually define—and
collectively to redefine—America as a place where the alien (i.e., the
alienated among us) is socially naturalized to the point where the alien is a
world citizen at home.

In fine, the theme of ―[American Journal]‖ is one of social maturity based
on human solidarity. From a ―cosmic‖ perspective (given the poem‘s artifice
of an alien visitor from Mars), America remains indefinable, yet refinable.
America‘s—and the world‘s—central problematic is social fragmentation in
its various iterations, with its implicit solution residing in Hayden‘s Bahá‘í-
inspired ethic of ―the fundamental oneness of all races, the essential oneness
of mankind, … [and] the vision of world unity‖.162 ―[American Journal]‖
never reaches that conclusion, although the reader who knows Hayden can
easily complete it. This thesis accords with Hayden‘s own disclosure that, in
his art, ―American life is a point of departure for me into an awareness of
the universal‖.163

By implication, ―[American Journal]‖ illumines the potential for interracial
and multiethnic harmony that exists—at home and abroad—with all of its
creative possibilities. Social maturity is coefficient with human solidarity.
As this study has demonstrated, ―[American Journal]‖ explores issues of
social maturity where integrative awareness of an overarching human
identity, including yet transcending racial identity, is a key indicator of
progress on the path of social evolution. The little green man from the Red
Planet suggests that ―white black / red brown yellow‖164 are ―strangering /
distinctions‖165 that will inevitably require an integrative identity to
positively value all such differences as part and parcel of a wider identity—a
supercategory that allows an ever-advancing civilization to progress to the
next stage in its social evolution, as the incandescent spirit illumines the
roseate skin from within. ―[American Journal]‖ energizes fresh reflection on
matters of social identity within the context of social evolution.
