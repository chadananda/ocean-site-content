> **Abstract:**  
>   
> Many works on mysticism from a psychological point of view adopt a view that is psycho-physiological. A true psychology takes the psyche/soul as an independent and autonomous reality. 'Abdu'l-Bahá informs the Bahá'í teacher that they must become "embodied intellect and personified spirit," offering us an approach to mysticism that is embodied and psychological. Often, when one explores religious texts, the known ideas and their genealogies are the "lens" one interprets with. This article uses the psychological ideas of Carl Jung, especially the "God-concept," as well as the introversion, and extraversion typologies, to present ideas about mystic experience based upon these essential types. The article calls for a serious re-thinking and revisioning of mysticism's claims of "union with God" in light of the Bahá'í Teachings as well as Jungian psychology. Usually a psychological approach is eschewed since most views are a "psychology without the psyche" that is, a psychology founded upon psycho-physiology instead of a psychology with the soul as Jung proposed.  
>   
> If one looks at the Bahá'í Writings and how they respond to the claims of the _wahdat al-wujúd_ and _wahdat ash-shuhúd_ found in Islamic mystical thought, and explores them in light of Jungian typology, the claims and counterclaims become irrelevant. We can come to a humble realization that no matter what the claim of any mystic is, no matter how profound their concepts are, "such mind and heart can never transcend that which is the creature of their own conceptions and the product of their own thoughts." In so doing, we come to express profound nature of the soul, the psyche, in creating the God-image. This leads us to consider an embodied mysticism and a "mystery- minded" mysticism which is in accord with the station of' servitude that the human reality embodies. This article is a written meditation on passages of the Bahá'í Writings. and the point is argued that when we come to again learn the profound mystery of the soul, the limitation of a contingent reality become freeing instead of viewed as limitation. We come to learn for the first time how it is that "He hath known God who hath known himself," and that this is embodied in the psyche as a reflection of the Primal Word. No matter how far one progresses in mystic illumination, we can never transcend the station of servanthood.

by Theo Cope

he idea of mysticism, what the word means, how we envision it, what experience the word

T      describes, is understood in a myriad of manners. Persons who investigate or grasp to understand

the field or experience called “mysticism” realize the complexity and history involved. Like all
ideas, mysticism seems to have a strongly emotional component that is inherent in its dynamic. Many
books have been written on the topic of mystical experience from philosophical, neurological, sociolog-
ical, historical, psychological, and of course religious perspectives. In the directives offered by
Bahá’u’lláh, when one considers any undertaking, one needs ask the question: Is the study I am to under-
take one that will be beneficial to humanity, or will it begin and end in mere words that cannot be
proven? To reflect upon the study of mysticism implies much; to attempt to re-vision it in light of cur-
rent scientific methodologies demands much. Of what value is another conference, or another view on
mysticism?

Perhaps we can restate this question and by so doing re-orient our ideas. A “practical mysticism” that
does not lead to ascetic living is one that contributes to “an ever advancing civ il iz ation.” We note that
in the early days of Islam, mystics established many social institutions and were very active in social
reform, yet later degenerated into ascetic styles. So, let us ask instead: “Do we have the psychological
tools necessary to begin a re-vision of the phenomena referred to as mysticism, and connect it with daily
life?” The answer to this must be an unconditional “Yes!” A beginning re-vision is where we will focus
our attention. Re-vision entails a re-focusing and a re-ideating, a re-framing and a re-thinking. Viewed
psychologically, it is inherently valuable to reconsider this domain of human experience, for humanity
must embark more consciously upon its mandated journey towards maturity. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá informs us that
those who wish to teach the Bahá’í Faith “...must be embodied spirit, (and) personified intellect” as well
as “incarnate light and personified spirit.”1 Mysticism has heretofore been considered the domain of a
few, or the result of ascetic practices, or def in ed by encounter with God, or Nature. The permutations
upon this theme are varied. We are now given to know that all of us are to be and live as embodied spir-
it and incarnate light; this is an embodied approach to mysticism, contrary to the dom in ant manner of
expression of experience that has often been forged in the crucible of ascetic and monastic practices.

This work is an introductory piece, to present some very basic ideas offered by the late Swiss psy-
chologist, Carl Jung (1875–1961), that may enable us to approach an understanding of mystical ideas from
a psychological view, while not limiting our understanding to psychology. It is intended to serve as a cat-
alyst, a petition in a sense, for others to join a serious dialogue of the value of Jung’s ideas for approach-
ing a spiritual psychology.

Ideas about mysticism, it is purported, have been constrained by their historical ancestors. Every
thought or idea has attached to it a history, a genealogy. When one investigates the influences of these
genealogies in the thought and writings of another, it is easy to interpret these writings according to the
known genealogies of the investigator. If one knows Sufi thought in depth, Christian mystical thought,
or Buddhist, Chán (Zen), Hindu, or Jewish, etc., it is likely that one will read passages in the Bahá’í
Writings and see in them views that in some cases clarifies some misunderstand in gs (such as union with
God, faná’), and in others verify the positions articulated before. What would happen if we radically re-
vision these ideas in light of psychological approaches? Would we thereby somehow denigrate what mys-
ticism is about? Would we be reducing mystical experience to psychological experiences? Would it be an
affront to the cherished ideas we hold about mystic experience? We must here assert unequivocally that
the response is “No!” All we do if we explore these mystical claims in the light of psychology is to return

in the realm of psychology.

This work takes an approach from Jungian psychology, the Bahá’í and Sufi teachings, in the hopes of

The human reality is far too complex to entertain any notions of reductionism.

The concept of “mystic experience” needs some immediate clarification, and an operational definition

in the stages of his journey beholdeth in the realms of being, proceed from his own vision.”2

The limit we shall place upon “mystic experience” in this current work goes beyond these attitudes and
> consideration of Weltanschauungen. The departure point we shall embrace finds its grounding in the
Bahá’í Writings:

> For whatsoever can be conceived by man is a reality that hath limitations and is not unl im i ted;
> it is circumscribed, not all-embracing. It can be comprehended by man, and is controlled by
> him. Sim il arly it is certain that all human conceptions are contingent, not absolute; that they
> have a mental existence, not a material one. Moreover, differentiation of stages in the contin-
> gent world is an obstacle to understand in g. How then can the contingent conceive the Reality
> of the absolute? As previously mentioned, differentiation of stages in the contingent plane is an
> obstacle to understand in g.3

> meditations of the profoundest thinker, the devotions of the holiest of sa in ts, the highest

\[36\] The Firm Cord of Se rv i t u d e

These two passages will serve as the focal points of our meditation. Indeed, this will be a meditation,
for we pursue it in the temple humility, seeking to re-think what mysticism refers to.

Let us define mysticism, then, as an experience of ecstasy, where ecstasy follows its linguistic roots:
“to stand outside of.” Mystic experience has traditionally been def in ed as union with God, with Nature,
or with the higher Self in the individual. For our purposes we shall refer to it as a manner of union, the
embodiment of spiritual qualities and attributes. Thus mysticism becomes “an embodied approach to life
that experiences the profound mystery of creation, and the symbolic manifestations of the psyche, the
soul, and perceives and lives with the belief that all existence is a reflection of the Unknowable Essence
we call God.” This definition compels one to “stand outside” the normal views of daily mundane and bio-
logically oriented life. In this definition, it is the perception and its concomitant effects upon lifestyle
that becomes the focus.

This paper proposes that until the advent of psychological approaches to human experience, what has
heretofore been interpreted to be mystic union with the Deity, or Brahman, is, in fact, a profound real-
ization of the ind iv idual divine Self, and a progressive embodiment of the characteristics of this Self.
This proposal is based upon many passages from the Bahá’í Writings. Besides those cited above, we find:

> In this connection, He Who is the eternal King—may the souls of all that dwell within the mys-
> tic Tabernacle be a sacrifice unto Him—hath spoken: ‘He hath known God who hath known him-
> self.’

> ...From that which hath been said it becometh evident that all things, in their inmost reality, tes-
> tify to the revelation of the names and attributes of God within them. Each according to its
> capacity, indicateth, and is expressive of, the knowledge of God.5
In one of His Tablets, Bahá’u’lláh informs us that, “...the pr im ary intent of knowing the self in this
station is the knowledge of the Self of God in every era and age. For the pre-existent essence and the
ocean of reality is exalted above the knowledge of all else but Him. Therefore, the insight attained by
all the mystics actually hath reference to their insight into the Manifestations of His Cause.”6
Interwoven into the core of our being, our psyche, is what Jung called the “God archetype.”

The heritage of this “He hath known God who hath known himself” is well known in Christian and
Islamic circles, and we find it mentioned first in the works of “Clement of Alexandria [who] says in the
Paedagogus (III, 1): ‘Therefore, as it seems, it is the greatest of all disciplines to know oneself; for when
a man knows himself, he knows God.”7 Clement lived from 150–215 A.D. Many have misunderstood Jung
to be reductionistic or a metaphysical thinker by proposing this concept, overlooking that he was always
speaking as a psychologist, not a metaphysician. He asserted, in a manner that appears to be harmonious
with comments by ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, “I am therefore of the opinion that, in general, psychic energy or libido
creates the God-image by making use of archetypal patterns, and that man in consequence worships the
psychic force active within him as something div in e. We thus arrive at the objectionable conclusion that,
from the psychological point of view, the God-image is a real but subjective phenomenon.”8 Many find
it objectionable that Jung could assert such a thing, and he even acknowledged this since it flies in the
face of our long-cherished assumption that we could experience God in the depths of our being. It is
important to note that Jung was speaking psychologically, not metaphysically. Jung knew the contro-
versy that would erupt when he or anyone asserted that our image or experience of “God” is created by
psychic energy. In part this is because our notions of the psyche are far too limited, and even “soul” is
a personal construct. Let’s compare this psychological view with a passage from the Master:

> Accordingly all these attributes, names, praises and eulogies apply to the Places of
> Manifestation; and all that we imagine and suppose beside them is mere imagination, for we
> have no means of comprehending that which is invisible and inaccessible. This is why it is said:
> ‘All that you have distinguished through the illusion of your imagi nation in your subtle mental
> images is but a creation like unto yourself, and returns to you.’

It is clear that if we wish to imagine the Reality of Divinity, this imagination is the surround-

Lights of ‘Irfán

> ed, and we are the surrounding one; and it is sure that the one who surrounds is greater than the
> surrounded. From this it is certain and evident that if we imagine a Divine Reality outside of
> the Holy Manifestations, it is pure imagination, for there is no way to approach the Reality of
> Divinity which is not cut off to us, and all that we imagine is mere supposition.

> Therefore, reflect that different peoples of the world are revolving around imaginations and are
> worshipers of the idols of thoughts and conjectures. They are not aware of this; they consider
> their imaginations to be the Reality which is withdrawn from all comprehension and purified
> from all descriptions. They regard themselves as the people of Unity, and the others as wor-
> shipers of idols; but idols at least have a mineral existence, while the idols of thoughts and the
> imaginations of man are but fancies; they have not even mineral existence. ‘Take heed ye who
> are endued with discernment.’9
We here learn as well that the soul creates “subtle mental images” and that whatever we may imagine,
or imagine that we experience, beyond the Manifestations, is “pure imagination.” To one versed in Shi’ite
Islamic (NeoPlatonic) philosophy of the Ishraqi strain, and has a sense of the development of “imagina-
tion/khayal,” imagination as creative is exalted as the faculty of mystic knowledge par excellence. In
Bahá’í thought, however, we note a cautious attitude towards these imaginal creations. We note this as
well in Bahá’u’lláh’s “Commentary on ‘He who knows himself knows his Lord’”: “Therefore, the insight
attained by all the mystics actually hath reference to their insight into the Manifestations of His
Cause.”10 These names and attributes, those “that we recount of the Divine Essence, ...have derived from
the existence and observation of beings, and it is not that we have comprehended the essence and per-
fection of God.”11 In this passage we are given to see that even these names and attributes are our cate-
gories, derived from our observation of created beings, attributed to the cosmic order; psychologically
we could say that they are projected into the cosmos, or perceived by the human psyche.

The power of the soul, the psyche, to create has often been overlooked in works on mysticism in the
West. In Islamic mysticism, it has been often a central concern, especially in the Ishraqi tradition where
imagination became “imagin al ,” under the exegetic work of Henry Corbin. Yet, to assert in any mysti-
cal heritage that the soul creates a “God archetype” is anathema; as much an affront as it is to orthodox
religious views that the soul can experience union with God. In Western mystical traditions, it is cate-
gorically asserted that the soul experiences some sort of union with God. This is in part determined and
conditioned by the NeoPlatonic or monistic heritage and assertion that “like can be known and experi-
enced by like” of Plotinus. Thus, since the human reality is like that of God, we can have such an expe-
rience. But perhaps it is imagination...but what a power imagination is! Let us not belittle it.

There exist many works on imagination, and in the NeoPlatonic tradition imagination is lauded as a
faculty of immense potentiality. In Islam beginning with Avicenna, developed by successive Islamic
philosophers, cultivated by Suhrawardi and the Ishraqi tradition, and bearing fruit in many minds and
hearts, notably Ibn ‘Arabi, Mulla Íadra, and eventually Shaykh A˙mad al-A˙sa’í, imagination transcends
the psychological heritage proposed by Aristotle in DeAnima, and progresses into ontology in the notion
of ‘alam al-mithal, the “world of similitudes/exemplars” also referred to as ‘alam al-khayal, the “world of
imagination,” or hurqalya. This is well known in Isharaqi mystical thought, de l in eated by Fazlur
Rahman, Henry Corbin, and many other commentators.

What is not well known is how this concept becomes “Westernized” and returned to its imaginal-psy-
chological heritage in the heart of James Hillman and his brand of archetypal psychology. In many of
Hillman’s works, he addresses the notion of the imaginal ego, seeking to espouse an approach to psy-
chology that enlivens it with archetypal personifications. Thus we find him expressing the current
understanding of psychology towards the psyche, adopting its habitual dualism about “reality”:

First, the word means the totality of existing material objects or the sum of conditions of the exter-
nal world. Reality is public, objective, social, and usually physical. Second there is a psychic reality, not
extended in space, the realm of private experience that is interior, wishful, imaginational. Having divid-
ed psychic reality from hard or external reality, psychology elaborates various theories to connect the two
orders together, since the division is worrisome indeed. It means that psychic reality is conceived to be

\[38\] The Firm Cord of Se rv i t u d e

neither public, objective, nor physical, while external reality, the sum of existing material objects and
conditions, is conceived to be utterly devoid of soul. As the soul is without world, so the world is with-
out soul.12

To pursue mysticism in an isolated environment, in an ascetic milieu, serves to separate this ecstatic
l iv ing with a socially lived existence. Interior experience; this is what mysticism has been thought to be
about. But it is more than this, it is about life as lived in the exterior world and a means of realizing
that exterior and interior are illusory concepts to the psyche. The psyche experiences, using outer and
inner faculties and processes. An embodied mysticism, a return of soul to the world, and our hearts to
the world of soul, is Hillman’s passionate quest. He would not call it mysticism, however, for it is psy-
chology to him. Psychology, as a “science of the soul”, where soul is translated from the Greek psyche, is
Hillman’s journey, and was that of Jung. While Jung approached psychology from a trans-national,
trans-cultural and trans-h is torical stance, Hillman does also, but finds his roots most deeply nourished
by Corbin’s hermeneutics of Sufi thought, as well as Greek mythology. Our world is ill because we have
lost our roots. As Shoghi Effendi remarked: we cannot separate the human heart from the environment
around it.13 When we begin to contemplate how it is that mysticism is a practical endeavor, to be embod-
ied and soci al iz ed through action balanced with contemplation, then we strip it of its ascetic heritage
and return soul to the world by infusing the world with new ideas about soul. In so doing, we are enabled
to overcome the concept of inner and outer experience and realize most profoundly that it is the soul
that experiences. If our thoughts are turned towards the body and material reality, or if they are turned
towards the heights of spiritual contemplation, the attention differs, but it is the soul that experiences
in both. Inner and outer become adjectival terms describing the focus of conscious attention.

None of this is new, none of it unique. The problem with a psychological approach to mysticism has
been due to its being pr im ar ily a “science without soul,” a psychophysiology that examines the minuti-
ae of physiological, neurological, cognitive, behavioristic expressions of the psyche. And most often the
psyche is conceived to be a mere epiphenomenon of brain functioning. This is all very understandable
given psychology’s young heritage and being compelled into an empirical stance by the currents of the
time. But the currents have changed, and it is no coincidence that psychology began burgeoning with the
Advent of the Revelation of the Báb and Bahá’u’lláh.

It is our ideas about mysticism that are being called into question, that need re-visioning. Implied in
this is the power of the idea, and anyone who knows Greek philosophical heritage knows the significance
of the Ideas in Plato, the Eidos. Ideas exist before our visioning, are what we see with, how we see, and
what we see. If we change our ideas about something, we change not only how we see, but also what we
can see. There is, however, no firm proof of the existence of these Platonic Ideas, and even Aristotle is
known to have questioned their ontological existence. Let an example suffice: oppression. This is an idea
we observe with. We see human interactions and people striving to discern truth. In some interactions
we see events, and these events we define as oppressive. Events are events, the idea of oppression gives
us a different interpretation of the event. As Bahá’u’lláh says, “What ‘oppression’ is more grievous than
that a soul seeking the truth, and wishing to attain unto the knowledge of God, should know not where
to go for it and from whom to seek it?”14 Being unable to find truth is not often considered as oppres-
sive, but we are given to know that it is a grievous oppression. Oppression is first an idea, it enables us
to see life’s events differently; when we see an idea anew, we see with new ideas and see new realities that
our old ideas could not embrace.

Mysticism is such an idea. In the Bahá’í corpus, the notion of wah∂at al-wujúd is complex, and varies
with the context. Thus an idea supporting a monistic view, in the “realm of the attributes” is presented,
while it is clear that any idea of existential mon is m, and union with the Essence of God, as has been
asserted by many mystics, is not supported. The complexity of the subject and the length of this article
does not permit a fuller discussion. In the Seven Valleys we learn that in the “Valley of True Poverty and
Absolute Nothingness” “...the wayfarer leaveth behind him the stages of the ‘oneness of Being and
Manifestation’ and reacheth a oneness that is sanctified above these two stations.”15 Moojan Momen
wrote about such a dichotomy in an article “Relativism: A Basis for Bahá’í Metaphysics,” but his view
was not psychological16 What we are delineating here is. As such, in keeping with the demands of the

Lights of ‘Irfán

psyche (and remember that psyche is used as soul, but in its psychological sense), we are seeking experi-
ences and ways of understanding experiences. Psyche exists for experiences, and these sometimes are not
in the heights of ecstasy, but the valleys; there are seven, and four more. Spirit pulls psyche up towards
the disembodied heights of its domain, seeking its reflection in the fiery Sun; psyche yearns to wallow
in the waters, seeking its reflection in what is below; and we are both. Psyche is intimately connected
with the body and earth. The Manifestation brings teachings and ideas that assist the spirit in trans-
forming the psyche from its propensity to stay in the “depths” to a comfort in the “heights.” Let us not
construe this literally.

If we strip mysticism of its exclusive metaphysical overtones, and its abstruse ontological and episte-
mological assertions, we are left with a different sort of mystery. And indeed, “mystery minded” mysti-
cism is accessible to us all, illum in ating our hearts and minds with a cosmos that is full of the Light of
Glory and the Glory of God. In this mystery we discern that all existence is a reflection of this Light,
that each aspect of creation is a “sign”; every Name of God portends mysteries that generate, sustain and
an im ate creation.17 The soul is such a sign.18 The logos of the soul, psychology, lost its way on the path
of exploring psyche because it took psyche to be the mind, since the “science of mental processes” was
more amenable to its developmental milieu than a science of the soul. We can look to Gal il eo as one
source of the beginnings of this loss, and his mathematization of nature that reverberated throughout
the West and captivated the minds of many; though these were mostly men. Women likely would have
never excluded the body and world. Descartes, Locke, Mill, Hume. These names have a history and
impacted history in a way that perpetuated the empirical exploration of the world, that fostered the divi-
sion between psyche and physics and compelled psychology to become psychophysics.19 Soul became
reduced, min im iz ed, exiled; a mere epiphenomenon of the machine universe. Our ideas became more
concretely divided between inner and outer reality; we have yet to fully learn that “the world of existence
is a single world, although its stations are various and distinct.”20 Soul also became min im iz ed thorough
time and the burgeoning development of ind iv idual ego awareness: my soul, and your soul; possessive,
personal, a pauper in the cosmos. No longer a microcosm within the macrocosm even.

This has changed, and quantum ideas have instigated a revolution on many fronts. We know now of
multiverses and many Big Bangs, not just one anymore. We know that on the quantum level matter is
spirit, that the physical universe is in continual flux, coming into and going out of existence; the illu-
sion is that it is a stable concrete existence. But soul, ever patient with human folly, bides its time. It
exists as it always has, it is our ideas that have gone astray. Yet, this is part of soul’s unfold in g, let us
not forget this. A song once sang “You don’t know what you have till it’s gone,” and our loss of soul is
sadly noticed in our lives; its loss has prompted us to approach it in new ways. It is not soul that was
lost, but our awareness and embodied acceptance of it.

Psychology, from the heart and find in gs of Carl Jung, proffers to us a manner of approaching psyche
again, but in a more mature manner; and in a manner that imbues it with mystery. The mystery that Jung
de l in eated is succinctly captured in two dom in ant psychological attitude types, the extravert and the
introvert. Briefly, the extravert is characterized by being: object oriented; nom in al is tic; prone to sensa-
tion and affectivity; empathic; concrete; focused on the individual element—particulars; pluralistic;
empirically guided; “romantic.” The introvert is characterized by being idea oriented; realistic; logical;
ideal is tic; focused on ideas and similarities—universals; mon is tic; dogmatic; “classic.”21 No one exists as
a “pure” type, but there is frequently one type that dom in ates. If we use these two types to investigate
many of the claims of mystics of all ages we will immediately notice why it is that there has existed the
persistence of such debates and harangues as have characterized most such assertions of mystic union
with God.

On the one hand, we know of the wah∂at al-wujúd and of wah∂at ash-shudúd. Moojan Momen express-
es it thusly: “This is the controversy between two positions concerning the nature of the relationship
between God and His creation. These two positions existed from the earliest days of Islam and eventu-
ally became known as Wah∂at al-Wujúd (existential unity, oneness of being) and Wah∂at ash-Shuhúd
(unity in appearance only). The former was the position taken by the followers of Ibn al-‘Arabí (d. 638
A.H./1240) and was more common among those inclined towards Sufism and mystical philosophy. The

\[40\] The Firm Cord of Se rv i t u d e

latter was the position commonly taken by jur is ts and was given its name by Shaykh A˙mad Sirhindí (971
A.H./1563–1034 A.H.—1034/1624–5) in the 17th century.”22 The former sees and interprets mystic expe-
rience and theosophical speculative thought in an introverted manner, and the latter in an extraverted
one. Likewise, we note that there exists a debate as to the ontological reality of the “realm” of ‘alam-al-
mithal, with the followers of Ibn ‘Arabí seeing it as an ontologically existent realm, while Sirhindí and
his followers viewed it as a realm of “seeing” not being.23 With these two typologies, the felt need for
argumentation about who is “correct” is undermined. It is even as Bahá’u’lláh expresses in many Tablets,
notably the “Tablet of the Uncompounded Reality,” as well as “Commentary on a Verse of Rumi (for
Salman),” that both are right, and both are wrong. This is the position taken by ‘Abdu’l-Bahá as well in
His “Commentary on the Islamic Tradition: I was a Hidden Treasure” where He expresses:

> Thus some of the mystic knowers who have ascended to the Heaven of mean in gs have recognised
> forms, realities and potentialities as pre-existent and unoriginated. And some of those informed
> of the path of knowledge and wisdom consider quiddities and realities to be originated and cre-
> ated. And this servant has given the expositions and evidences of both parties in the clearest
> possible manner in this treatise. But to this servant all these expositions and questions, stations
> and states are complete in their own station without defect or flaw. For although the object
> being viewed is the same, nevertheless the viewpoints and stations of these mystic knowers is

This theme of viewpoints being dependent upon the wayfarer is stated in the Seven Valleys as well,
and is what we find in our opening passages of meditation. Thus it can be seen how Jung enables us to
d is cern this clearly as an essential component of one’s psychological makeup. A recognition of these
typologies permits us to henceforth dispense with any such argumentations and harangues, and instead
begin to approach the profound mystery of the God-image created in the soul, by the soul, and in accor-
dance with individual psychological orientations. This is a very simplified presentation of this complex
issue from a psychological approach, given briefly here to indicate one manner of seeing this lengthy his-
torical debate. As an introductory work, we cannot delve deeper.

Indeed, the mystery of the soul’s creations is what mysticism is about. Since we have been guided by
Bahá’í teachings to accept humbly and deeply the limitations imposed upon us as created realities, limi-
tations that free us in manners that we are only beginning to understand, perhaps it is time that we take
seriously the fact that the soul creates and that one can “never transcend that which is the creature of
their own conceptions and the product of their own thoughts....” This is a profound mystery, worthy of
our pursuit and embodiment. The Guardian characterized the potentialities thusly: “Who can visu al iz e
the realms which the human spirit, vital iz ed by the outpouring light of Baha’u’ ll ah, shining in the plen-
itude of its glory, will discover?”25 These realms lay enfolded within us, attested by Bahá’u’lláh’s affir-
mation, “Some have described him as the ‘lesser world,’ when, in reality, he should be regarded as the
‘greater world.’ The potentialities inherent in the station of man, the full measure of his destiny on earth,
the innate excellence of his reality, must all be manifested in this promised Day of God.”26 And

> Likewise, reflect upon the perfection of man’s creation, and that all these planes and states are
> folded up and hidden away within him. Dost thou reckon thyself only a puny form When with-
> in thee the universe is folded?27
We know that full knowledge of the Self, individually speaking, is impossible, and it is no great jump
to realize the impossibility of knowing the Self of God, the Manifestation, or the “names and attribut-
es.” If we persist, as witnessed in all previous religious dispensations, with argumentations about the
“correct” understanding of the relationship with God to creation, we not only fail to understand the clear
admonitions of the Faith, but also fail to grasp the power of the soul. On the former, we come to learn
in Bahá’í thought that all we can even refer to refers to the Manifestations of God, and not to the

Lights of ‘Irfán

Unknowable Essence. This is expressed clearly in the Tablets mentioned above, as well as in Some
Answered Questions, a passage cited previously also. Yet, even this, we are given to comprehend, is
reflected in our being.

> But we ask God to acquaint the people with their own selves, so that they might avoid tres-
> passing beyond their bounds and their station, and might speak of God by means of this most
> great mention and might aid God with all their limbs and members. Thus might they become
> standards streaming between the heavens and the earth. Dwell, O people, in the shadow of God,
> then persevere in your seats of honor by means of the mysterious peace of God and his serene
> dignity. Hold firm to the cord of servitude.28
The station of the Manifestation is beyond our capability to fathom, thus we need to focus on the
human psyche and heart, therein seeing these reflections. We need to comprehend and embody the impli-
cations of clearly demarcated stations in existence. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá mentions three such stations, referring
to them as conditions, as being limited to “servitude, prophethood and Deity”29 The clear admonitions
enjoining us to refrain from such debates is expressed in many places, and we note in the “Commentary
on a Verse of Rumi” Bahá’u’lláh stating:

> But, Salman, the pen of the All-Merciful says, ‘Today, those who affirm and those who deny
> these utterances are on the same level.’ For the sun of reality is itself resplendent and is shin in g
> from the hor iz on of the heavens. All those who busy themselves with such say in gs are, of course,
> deprived of mystical insight into the beauty of the Compassionate. The prime time for investi-
> gating illusions is the time when no divine guidance is present. Today is the springtime of
> unveiling and attainment. Roam, O people, in the garden of revealment and disclosure, and for-
> sake illusions. Thus are you commanded by the pen of God, the Guardian, the Eternal. All
> branches of knowledge were set forth only for the sake of establishing that which is valid. Now,
> praise be to God that the sun of the object of knowledge has dawned above the hor iz on of the
> sky of eternity, and the moon of validity is shining in the heavens of command. Sanctify your
> heart from all allusions and gaze with your outward eyes toward the daystar of mean in gs in the
> holy and spiritual firmament. Note well His effulgence of names and attributes in what is other
> than He, so that you might attain to all knowledge, and to its origin, mine, and wellspring.30
This is also what we find in His “Tablet of the Uncompounded Reality,” and the Master’s
“Commentary.” “Hold firm to the cord of servitude,” impels us and emboldens us to explore the mystery
of the soul.

By taking a psychological perspective, that adumbrated by Carl Jung and his “psychology with the psy-
che,” we are enabled to begin an approach to the profound mystery of the soul and our relationship to
our Self, and the mysterious workings of creative libid in al energies.31 In so doing, we shall begin an
exploration as promoted by the Bahá’í Writings, and according to the station of being human, that of
servitude. This exploration will be to the manifestations and creations of the psyche, the soul, and the
mystery of such a reality. In this way, we may come to grasp one intent behind this injunction: “To trans-
gress the limits of one’s own rank and station is, in no wise, permissible. The integrity of every rank and
station must needs be preserved. By this is meant that every created thing should be viewed in the light
of the station it hath been ordained to occupy.”32 Every created thing, and this includes the creations of
the psyche; “To whatever heights the mind of the most exalted of men may soar, however great the depths
which the detached and understanding heart can penetrate, such mind and heart can never transcend that
which is the creature of their own conceptions and the product of their own thoughts.” What a profound
mystery! What a suitable endeavor for mysticism!

In closing, let us ponder some passages from Bahá’u’lláh, looking anew at them, seeing in them pro-
found psychological assertions of the most serious import. By asserting they are psychological state-
ments implies only that they are at least psychological, and psychology puts them within the grasp of
every person’s experience:

As a token of His mercy, however, and as a proof of His lov in g-kindness, He hath manifested

\[42\] The Firm Cord of Se rv i t u d e

> unto men the Day Stars of His divine guidance, the Symbols of His divine unity, and hath
> ordained the knowledge of these sanctified Beings to be identical with the knowledge of His own
> Self. Whoso recognizeth them hath recognized God. Whoso hearkeneth to their call, hath hear-
> kened to the Voice of God, and whoso testifieth to the truth of their Revelation, hath testified
> to the truth of God Himself.33

> Whatever duty Thou hast prescribed unto Thy servants of extolling to the utmost Thy majesty
> and glory is but a token of Thy grace unto them, that they may be enabled to ascend unto the
> station conferred upon their own inmost being, the station of the knowledge of their own
> selves.34

> O My servants! Could ye apprehend with what wonders of My munificence and bounty I have
> willed to entrust your souls, ye would, of a truth, rid yourselves of attachment to all created
> things, and would gain a true knowledge of your own selves—a knowledge which is the same as
> the comprehension of Mine own Being. Ye would find yourselves independent of all else but Me,
> and would perceive, with your inner and outer eye, and as manifest as the revelation of My efful-
> gent Name, the seas of My lov in g-kindness and bounty moving within you.35

> To whatever extent they who seek to rise to the highest stations of mystic knowledge may ascend
> or to whatever high station in the degrees of certitude they that hold fast to the Divine unity
> may climb, they are only reading the letters of the book of their souls (cf. Qur’án 17:14), only
> attaining the sign that is refulgent, deposited, incorporated, and concealed within the realities
> of their own inner being and only revolving around the centres of the circles of their own essen-
> tial natures. And as for the stages that are above their worlds and beyond their attainment, they
> are not able to seek information about them nor to understand them.36
Surely, if we ponder Clement of Alexandria’s statement that “when a man knows himself he knows
God,” we realize the profound importance of self-knowledge, no matter how limited. We are a limited
creation, and yet this limitation is vast and expansive. Indeed, the “firm cord of servitude” is what we
observe in the embodied life of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, the Bahá’í Exemplar.
