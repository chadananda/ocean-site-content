## Bahá'í Approaches to Christianity and Islam: Further Thoughts on Developing an Inter-Religious Dialogue

### by [Seena Fazel](https://bahai-library.com/author/Seena+Fazel)

published in [_Bahá'í Studies Review_](https://bahai-library.com/series/BSR), 14, pages 39-51  
London: Association for Baha'i Studies UK, 2007-12


> **Abstract:** This paper aims to present a novel Bahá'í contribution to inter-religious dialogue, one that is based on developing intellectual bridges between the religions. It is argued that the concept of continuity of revelation is a framework by which religions can dialogue about their differences and similarities. Some preliminary aspects of this concept are outlined from scripture and current scholarship in Christianity and Islam. There are three aspects to continuity of revelation: commonalities between the religions, non-exclusivity and non-finality in relation to their claims. The paper concludes that a central theme of inter-religious dialogue should be the nature and lives of the prophet-founders. In the context of Christian – Muslim dialogue, the challenge that the prophetic career of Muhammad represents for Christians is discussed in relation to ‘Abdu'l-Bahá's talks in the West. Finally, the importance for Bahá'ís of contributing to the western discourse on Islam is explored.

2. Like the prophets of Israel, Muhammad was a man with a staunch will.

> He was wholly imbued with his divine vocation, totally taken up by
> God’s calling, exclusively absorbed in his mission.
3. Like the prophets of Israel, Muhammad spoke amidst a religious and

> social crisis. With passionate piety and a revolutionary message, he
> stood up against the wealthy ruling class and the traditions of the age.
4. Like the prophets of Israel, Muhammad wished to be nothing but God’s

mouthpiece and to proclaim God’s word, not his own.
