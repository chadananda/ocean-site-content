Reflections on the Spiritual Dynamics of the Bahá’í Faith

Alessandro Bausani

Abstract
True spiritual force has the power to change matter. The spiritual force released by Bahá’u’lláh has the power to
change the entire world. Humans, unaided, cannot understand the fundamental problems of mankind; a prophet
like Bahá’u’lláh gives us the power both to understand human problems and to correct them. Values do not
derive from the individual but from the central Force of the universe: God. Only the religious mind can place
moral issues like sin and death in the context of the realities of the universe. The acquisition of virtues such as a
love of order, moderation, obedience, and humility are among the requisites for preparing the human heart for
the new society Bahá’u’lláh’s teachings will bring. However, religion should be practical and other-oriented,
not mystical and introspective. The spiritual force released by the good actions of believers has a more pervasive
influence than the same action of a nonbeliever. The gathering together of Bahá’ís in prayer will augment these
spiritual forces and dispel ignorant ideas of religion.

Résumé
Une véritable force spirituelle a le pouvoir de transformer la matiére. La force spirituelle libérée par
Bahá’u’lláh détient ce pouvoir de transformer Ie monde entier. Sans assistance divine, les êtres humains ne
peuvent appréhender les problèmes fondamentaux de l’humanité; un prophete tel que Bahá’u’lláh nous donne à
la fois la capacité de comprendre les problèmes humains et la possibilité de les corriger. Ce n’est pas de
l’individu que découlent les valeurs mais de la force qui est au centre de l’univers: Dieu. Seul un esprit
religieux est en mesure de replacer des questions morales comme Ie péché et la mort dans Ie contexte des
réalités qui composent l’univers. L’acquisition de vertus telles que l’amour de l’ordre, la modération,
l’obéissance et l’humilité font partie des qualités indispensables pour préparer Ie coeur humain à cette nouvelle
société que les enseignements de Bahá’u’lláh sont en train de créer. La religion devrait toutefois posséder un
aspect pratique et altruiste au lieu d’être mystique et introspective. La force spirituelle libérée par les bonnes
actions des croyants possède une influence à la fois plus pénétrante et plus englobante qu’une action identique
entreprise par un non-croyant. Le rassemblement des bahá’ís dans la prière accroîtra ces forces spirituelles et
dissipera les préjugés en matière de religion.

Résumen
La fuerza espiritual verdadera tiene el poder de cambiar la materia. La fuerza espiritual desatada por Bahá’u’lláh
tiene el poder de cambiar al mundo entero. Los humanos, sin ayuda, no pueden entender los problemas
fundamentales de la humanidad; un profeta como Bahá’u’lláh nos da tanto el poder de entender los problemas
humanos y de corregirlos. Los valores no provienen del individuo sino de la fuerza central del universo: Dios.
Sólo la mente religiosa puede poner cuestiones morales de pecado y muerte en el contexto de la realidad del
universo. La acquisición de virtudes como el amor al orden, moderación, obedencia, y humildad son algunos de
los requisitos para preparar al corazón humano para la nueva sociedad que las enseñanzas de Bahá’u’lláh nos
brindará. Sin embargo, la religión debe de ser práctica y orientada hacia otros, no mística e introspectiva. La
fuerza espiritual desatada por las buenas acciones de los creyentes tiene una influencia más pervasiva que las
mismas acciones por los no-creyentes. Al reunirse juntos los Bahá’ís en oración aumentarán estas fuerzas
espirituales, y dispersarán las ideas ignorantes sobre la religión.

For Bahá’ís, the term “spiritual” has a clear and positive value. Positive value means that spirit has power, that
spirit does not fly away from matter, but instead has the power to change matter. Bahá’u’lláh likened man to a
powerful bird that cannot fly with a single wing; man’s wings are both of spirit and matter. Through spirit, a
flower can spring out of earth; the flower is unthinkable without the spiritual force organizing the material
elements in the earth to create that flower. Through that same spirit, and yet in another plane, Moses created the
flower of the “people of God” from the barren soil of the heart of the Israelites. Muhammad made of the
sunburnt sands of the Arabian desert a spiritual paradise and a source of life to generations.

Through that same spiritual force, Bahá’u’lláh, an unknown man from an almost unknown comer of the
world, a prisoner without any material assistance of arms and bayonets (or atomic bombs), accomplished this
miracle of uniting people from the farthest regions of the earth, giving Bahá’ís all over the world a practical,
organized, and well-ordered force to change the world.

This is what I mean by spiritual dynamics. A true spiritual force, possessing real strength to change the
world can be found only in a faith, in a religion. I think it necessary, especially before persons who could
mistake the Bahá’í Faith for a purely humanistic organism, to emphasize the basic religious character of the
Bahá’í Faith. I see the Bahá’í Faith as the religion rather than a religion, acknowledging as it does all the
prophets and fundamental truths of all established religions. Yet, with its veneration for the Eternal Christ
shining in Bahá’u’lláh, with its simple and democratic yet well-organized, extremely dis ciplined Administrative
Order (believed by Bahá’ís to be based on nothing less than the Word of God and thus different from all
manmade churches and organizations), it forms a unique body of persons believing with all their hearts in God,
considering all that is not of God as ephemeral, and believing that God’s aim is now the unification of the
human race and striving hard for this supreme goal.

Those of you who are not believers of any religion will certainly ask me: do you really think that a
prophet and a religion and God are needed to unify the world? It would be very easy to answer by mentioning
some of the numberless facts proving the futility of human efforts, even when aided by powerful modern means,
to construct at least a partial unity in our world and comparing these with the wonderful achievements of Moses,
Jesus, and Muhammad. But I will rather try to explain, in a more theoretical way, why I believe that religion is
the only power possessing a “spiritual force,” the special force mentioned earlier.

Religion means absolute unity in diversity. When I say absolute, I mean a unity embracing all, not a
partial unity. Modern science has demonstrated that the entire universe is a complex of nothingness held
together by energies and forces of a character extremely difficult to explain in simple words. “Nothing nesses”
like death, evil, and sin have no place in a world-synthesis of a nonreligious character, at least they are not
understandable by nonreligious minds.

The sacred force of the unifying power of religion lies in the fact that the religious mind doesn’t
neglect problems like those of death, evil, and sin. On the contrary, it gives them their proper place in the
immense order of the cosmos and illuminates them with a suitable light. This power of absorbing and
assimilating into a great system things like “death,” “evil,” and “sin” can’t be given naturally; it is not a power
of nature, itself a part of the whole. The unifying power must lie in a region beyond nature and non-nature, even
beyond “spirit” in the obvious psychic sense of the word (itself always a part).

Imagine a beautiful painting and then a colored dot in this painting trying to understand—on its
bidimensional plane—the entire painting. The colored dot cannot in any way, even travelling throughout the
entire picture of which it is a part with its unique place and color, understand the unity of the picture; even less
so can it unify and arrange colors and lines of the painting if some disorder takes place. Only by placing itself
outside the painting, only by looking at the painting with the eyes of the painter, comprehending the picture and
its surroundings, only in this way could it understand the real meaning of the painting and at the same time
obtain the force necessary to correct, order, and better unify it. Man alone cannot understand humanity, and
therefore Bahá’ís think that a Superman can teach us this: a Superman not in Nietzsche’s pagan sense (more
infrahuman than superhuman) but rather, what we call a prophet. A prophet is both a teacher (to understand
what the painting is and why it has been made) and a giver of power (to correct it, because we think, as the
Qur’án says, that God is never tired of creating and renewing things). The only difference between Bahá’ís and
other religious people is that according to Bahá’í teach ings, God’s richness is so great that a single prophet is
not sufficient to reveal this richness, and so Bahá’ís believe in an uninterrupted series of revealers of divine
bounty, increasingly adapted to the intellectual and moral progress of mankind, so as to avoid crystallization and
ritualistic manmade traditionalisms.

This dynamic power of changing the world is bestowed by God upon humanity—whose dignity and
supreme position in the universe is strongly emphasized by the Baha’i Faith—only after a preliminary cleansing
of the heart. The cleansing instruments are order, moderation, obedience, and humility.

Order

By order I mean, of course, not a geometrical, purely mental and abstract disposition of things, but
rather something quite different. Modem people, and specially young revolutionary generations including
myself some years ago, are terrified hearing words like order and moderation. But the order of the Bahá’ís does
not mean a return to the Middle Ages. Rather, it means creating, from the universal point of view of the Painter,
a new and more beautiful arrangement in the picture.

Moderation

To Bahá’ís, moderation means discerning the truth in all things as seen with the eye of God. More than
eighty years ago, Bahá’u’lláh told the world: “Soon will the present-day order be rolled up, and a new one
spread out in its stead” ( Gleanings 7). To develop a spirit—so to say—of artistic order in ourselves is one of the
chief preparatory tasks of religious persons. It is what in medieval theology was called “asceticism,” and what
the Bahá’ís can now exercise in a new and interesting way, repudiating nothing of the beautiful things of this
world of God, in their well-organized and collectively-working communities held together by ordinances laid
down by the Prophet Bahá’u’lláh, perfected by his son, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, and evolving in time under the direction

of the Universal House of Justice. A characteristic feature of this Order, completely lacking in the modem
world, is obedience, obedience not to man but to God.

Obedience

The modem world has often strangely preferred obedience even to the most unworthy individuals than
to God. I know many persons in my country [Italy], who when discussing the existence of God, accused me of
being a slaveminded man because of my belief in a supreme Lord and Master, and then themselves completely
relinquished their rational powers before a dictator. If obedience to a partial power, to a part often in conflict
with the whole, means abasement and self-mortification, obedience to a universal or, better said, superuniversal
Power, means being ourselves a part of this creative whole: something then opens in us, a portal from which
creative forces flow into our being.

Humility

Humility, the other forgotten virtue, is connected with all this. It means that “devotional” attitude of
mind, so rare now, at least in our Western world, and that which gives humanity the possibility of recognizing
everywhere the voice of God. A well-known Persian mystic poem says, “We must have a king-recognizing eye
so as to recognize the king in every dress, even in the dress of a beggar.” This attitude to believe, when rooted in
a pure heart, is really infallible. This attitude to kneel before something majestic and divine, for example was
lacking in the Pharisees at the time of Jesus, a king who appeared in the dress of a beggar. So it was for
Bahá’u’lláh, a persecuted pris oner dispossessed of even a trace of human and earthly power. I admit that this
virtue is very difficult for modem people, but I don’t admit that it is not a virtue. I am sure that if Jesus, whom
Christians theoretically so venerate, would come now in the world exactly in his same garb, saying the same
things, He would certainly finish in a prison or an insane asylum. Why? Because of humanity’s lack of humility.
One of the most important spiritual experiences of being a Baha’i is this possibility of exercizing now—in our
world with its atomic bombs, airplanes, electricity—the same virtue that gave to the ancient Christians the
possibility of recognizing the Christ in Jesus. Bahá’ís believe that the Christ for our era is Bahá’u’lláh.

These virtues are the preparation, the cleansing instruments for the heart. The creative forces generated
after cleansing are a gift of God, and it is, of course, very difficult to explain them in words. It is what every
religion calls faith. But after what I said before, don’t think that the Bahá’í Faith is a medieval faith denying
everything terrestrial and only looking at the heavens. On the contrary, the Bahá’í Faith is not mystic in the
otherworldly sense of the word. In a letter by Bahá’u’lláh to a friend of his who was a mystic, there is a very
interesting passage advising the friend to follow another way, with these words:

> Open thy spiritual wings and soar through all the spiritual kingdoms with the swiftness of a lightning. Fling
> wide open the vision of thy eyes and regard the grace of the invisible world. If thou throwest mud into the
> water it sinks, but if thou depositest a rose into it, it remains like a crown floating upon it: i.e., záhir and
> baqá (exteriority and permanence) are better than bátin and faná (interiority and annihilation). In other
> words weight is the cause of sinking, therefore thou must free thyself from the weight of possessions, and,
> like a rose, in this very bodily frame float through eternity upon the surface of earthly dominions.

This passage has a meaning much deeper than what appears at first sight. Though emphasizing detachment
from earthly possessions and the importance of the invisible world, it contains a very fine criticism of that
system or those systems of religious mysticism (so frequent in oriental countries and often a cause of decay for
those peoples), which assume that sinking into oneself, shutting one’s eyes to every exterior reality, is the
supreme goal of man. In the words of Bahá’u’lláh, we have an interesting religious revindication of exoter ism
and activity against the exaggerated importance given by almost all religions to meditation and annihilation. The
rose can’t do any good if thrown and sunk into the water. Like the metaphorical rose, we must float upon earthly
things through eternity, that is, dominating earthly things and putting them into the great invisible frame of a
divinely appointed Order. Doing something with them, not sinking into them.

Another very interesting point in Bahá’u’lláh’s criticism of certain mystic lore is that too often
pseudoreligious persons, imagining they are deeply sinking into unheard of spiritual abysses, do nothing more
than mix up their own subconscious and unconscious zones. Even great mystics, said Bahá’u’lláh in another
letter, took their poetical imaginings about God for reality. Only God, and this is a central point in the Bahá’í
teachings, only God speaking through his Manifestations can inspire humanity with creative thoughts, which
result in creative action.

Bahá’u’lláh says: “He [the non-believer] is the people of error, though he shows forth all good actions”
(Kitáb-i-Aqdas). And ‘Abdu’l-Bahá explains: “This blessed verse means that the foundation of success and
salvation is the knowledge of God, and that the results of the knowledge of God are the good actions which are
the fruits of faith” ( Some Answered Questions 238).
This may sound rather horrifying to modern ears. Modern philosophies of religion are more and more reducing

religion, in the best case, to purely moral phenomena. Religion and morals are identified by philosophers. This
sentence of Bahá’u’lláh speaks against this too unilateral conception. According to the Bahá’í Faith, a good
action is, of course, always a good action, but a good action performed by a believer has a special creative force.

We ought always to bear in mind that we are not ourselves the creators of values. Values flow through
us from the central creative force of the universe. If we direct ourselves towards that center, if we choose the
exact channel through which that force is flowing, it is clear that every action (value) we personally create
becomes infinitely multiplied by the creative power. In other words, if a nonbeliever does a good action, this
produces a force (and I do not deny that this is a positive one too) whose radius of action is limited by the real,
but partial, energy of that particular man or particular manmade doctrine. But if a believer does a good action,
new flowers blossom on all the planets; new wonderful portals open in the whole of the universe. Sometimes the
special power of a good deed performed by a believer can’t be seen by mortal eyes; it is like every normal good
deed in this world. But sometimes even unbelieving eyes must acknowledge this unheard of force. Take, for
instance, the immense power acquired through the Word of God by those ignorant Muslim bedouins who
established the most powerful civilization of their times after the collapse of both the Persian and Byzantine
Empires, or those Christian martyrs who created our occidental civilization, or those thousands of Bahá’ís who
died for their faith in Persia, laying the first foundations of the World Order.

Modern society can no longer be satisfied with a doctrine concentrating every source of value in the
individual. Individualism, represented in the religious field especially by the great Protestant Reformation and in
politics by Liberalism, has had its time. The best proof of this is the increasing power of attraction on the masses
exercized by great collectivistic parties and religious organizations. The different values, religious and private,
of good deeds is strictly connected with the social problem: the force of religions, especially at their native and
original and fresh stages, consists in the fact that they boldly assert that only God can do good, in the real
cosmic sense of the word, whereas the private and personal actions of men, even heroic, have their private and
personal value. The doctrine that made “Jesus is my personal Savior” the center of religious emotion is not
enough for a modern soul. The spiritual and mystic center, from which all the social teachings of the Bahá’í
Faith develop, is this sentence of Bahá’u’lláh, “The mere act of your gathering together is enough to scatter the
forces of these vain and worthless people” ( Tablets 85).

Gathering together in spirit of prayer, that is, shaking hands in fraternal love, my white hands with the
black ones of a Negro, my Italian hands with the hands of an Englishman, has a transforming power far above
that of sacraments and rituals. Working together is an act of worship in the Bahá’í Faith. But, this is the central
point, in the spirit of prayer, a spirit that led Bahá’u’lláh to pray:

> O my God! O my God! Unite the hearts of Thy servants, and reveal to them Thy great purpose [the unity of
> mankind]. May they follow Thy commandments and abide in Thy law. Help them, O God, in their
> endeavor, and grant them strength to serve Thee.... (Prayers 204)
