I.

The Baha-’i- Faith is a religion founded in modern times which has been relatively
little researched by scholars working in the field of comparative religion. There-
fore, even at the risk of carrying coals to Newcastle, some basic information first.
The Faith, founded in the 19th century in Iran, is an independent prophetic relig-
ion in the tradition of Near Eastern revealed religions, bearing the archetypal fea-
tures we know from religious history: a herald figure who prepared the way, the
Ba-b, and the prophetic central figure whose advent he announced, the founder of
the Baha-’i- Faith: Baha-’u’lla-h.2 The God whom he proclaims is “the God of Abra-
ham, Isaac and Jacob”.3 Having its roots in the messianic promises of Islam,4 this
religion came into being in the year 1260 A. H.5 with the appearance of the “Ba-
b”.6 With his proclamation of the onset of the “great Day of the Lord”,7 of the
promised “Hour”,8 and his rapidly growing community, he provoked the embit-
tered opposition of the Shi-‘ite clergy who had him incarcerated and eventually
executed publicly in 1850. With the abrogation9 of the Islamic religious law, the
shari-‘a, and with the proclamation of a new divine law he laid the foundation for
a conflict which continues to this day and which manifests itself in violent perse-
cution in the Islamic Republic of Iran. The claim to a post-Qur’a-nic revelation
from God is incompatible with the orthodox Islamic dogma of the finality10 of the
Qur’a-nic revelation; it is a skandalon, a heresy and apostasy.11

In Baha-’u’lla-h the Baha-’i-s see the eschatological turning-point of history:
With him the Adamic cycle, the age of prophecy, has come to an end,12 the “Day
of Resurrection”13 has dawned, and a new age of the world has begun, in which
mankind will attain its fulfilment. During his forty-year prophetic ministry Baha-
’u’lla-h was a prisoner and exile of the Sha-h and the Turkish Sultan. Baghda-d,
Constantinople, Adrianople and finally ‘Akka- in the Holy Land were the stations
of his exile. The wealth of authentic texts14 revealed in the Arabic and Persian
languages on all aspects of human existence, are, to the Baha-’i-s, God’s message
to humanity, the Word of God. The Faith founded by Baha-’u’lla-h, which was first
introduced to a Western audience at the World Parliament of Religions in Chicago
in 1893 and has since spread over almost all the countries on the globe, is — de-
spite the relatively small number of its adherents15 — the geographically most
widespread religion, after Christianity.16 For a long time presented as an Islamic
sect, it is increasingly depicted in academic literature as a universal religion and is
numbered among the world religions.17

II.

A central theme in the teachings of Baha-’u’lla-h (and, indeed, in those of the Ba-b)
is the concept of unity. This unity exists on three levels: the unity of God,18 unity
of the religions, and the unity of mankind.

1. The message of the Ba-b was already universal in scope. Addressing the
whole of mankind, he called on the “peoples of the West” to heed his message
and “to become as true brethren in the one and indivisible religion of God”.19

Baha-’u’lla-h, in his mission to “vivify the world and to bring into unity all who are
on the face of the earth”,20 has indicated to the human race, as it rapidly proceeds
to develop into a world society, the goal for which it is to strive: the spiritual and
political unification of mankind. His message of “world-wide regeneration”21
aims, in its horizontal dimension, at the establishment of a universal order among
the nations, at the abolition of war and the establishment of eternal peace.22 The
prerequisite for this political goal of a messianic realm, a federative world com-
monwealth based on “unity in diversity”23, is a new, cosmopolitan consciousness,
borne on the “vision of peoples living peacefully together”24 and filled with un-
bounded, all-embracing love for the whole of mankind, which was created as one
family: “Ye are all the leaves of one tree and the drops of one ocean”25 ... “The
earth is but one country, and mankind its citizens”.26

This vision of a unified mankind is not some vague, fanciful idea, but rather a
prophetic promise,27 an ardent hope and a practical political manifesto. Love for
humanity is a central value in the hierarchy of values. All action should be di-
rected towards the well-being of mankind,28 its welfare having absolute priority
over all particular interests. For this reason it is stated: “Let your vision be world-
embracing, rather than confined to your own self”29... “It is not for him to pride
himself who loveth his own country, but rather for him who loveth the whole
world.... That one indeed is a man who, today, dedicateth himself to the service of

22   According to Baha-’u’lla-h, the path to “perpetual peace” (Immanuel Kant, Perpetual Peace [1795], Los Angeles/Cal.:

> US Library Association 1932) will be a two-stage process characterized by the concepts “Lesser Peace” and “Most
> Great Peace”. The “Lesser Peace” (cf., for example, Gleanings from the Writings of Baha-’u’lla-h, Wilmette/Ill., rev.
> edn. 1978, 119:3) is the eschatological short-term goal; it is the unification of the nations, based on international trea-
> ties, into a federative world commonwealth invested with executive power. The crises by which mankind is increas-
> ingly afflicted will lead to a turbulent and painful process of transformation and finally to a breakthrough to a more
> complex, higher form of organisation and will thereby, at first without mankind’s conscious knowledge, realise princi-
> ples proclaimed by Baha-’u’lla-h. The “Most Great Peace” is the eschatological long-term goal. It is the vision of the
> Kingdom of God on Earth, the spiritual transformation of the world through the Message of Baha-’u’lla-h, which will
> alone breathe life into the politically united organism. On these concepts see Baha-’u’lla-hs Gleanings 119:3; Baha-’u’lla-

the entire human race.”30 Late Antiquity’s idea of world citizenship, whereby “the
whole world is our fatherland”,31 has thus reached a new dimension: having been
elevated to a religious creed it has become the focal point of a practical agenda
for the salvation of all mankind.

2. A further universalistic feature is the Baha-’i- concept of revelation, the doc-
trine concerning divine revelation in history. To “all peoples”,32 from “time im-
memorial”,33 God has sent his Prophets and Messengers34 and has made a Cove-
nant with them to guide them to the “straight Path of Truth”,35 the path to salva-
tion. Every one of these Messengers of salvation was “the Way of God that
connecteth this world with the realms above, and the Standard of his Truth”,36
“the representative and mouthpiece of God”,37 the representative of his authority
and sovereignty. Exalted above normal human beings, they belong to an
ontological level of their own in the realm of creation. In them man encounters
God: “Whoso recognizeth Them hath recognized God”,38 while the Ultimate
Reality, the Essence of God, will forever remain veiled from man.39 Baha-’u’lla-h
calls the founding figures who are known to us from religious history
“Manifestations of God”40 and states categorically that there is no distinction
whatsoever among them.41 Belief in all the Manifestations as embodiments of a
common level of divine inspiration is necessary to salvation:42 Whoever denies
one of them, denies them all.43 Thus, these religions receive their light from the

41   “There is no distinction whatsoever among the Bearers of My Message” (Baha-’u’lla-h, Gleanings 34:3; 24).
42   The idea that the individual’s encounter with the Manifestation obliges him to make a decision of major significance

> for his spiritual life is to be found in the Gospels (Mark 16:16; Mat. 10:32; John 3:17-18; Luke 12:8), in the Qur’a-n
> (57:8; 48:29), in the Zoroastrian tradition (Yasna 31:2-3) and in the Writings of the Ba-b (Selections from the Writings
> of the Ba-b 1:4:4 [p. 12]). In the Writings of Baha-’u’lla-h we frequently come across this statement: The Kita-b-i-Aqdas,

Thus, these religions receive their light from the same source: “These principles
and laws, these firmly-established and mighty systems have proceeded from one
source, and are rays of one Light. That they differ one from another is to be at-
tributed to the varying requirements of the ages in which they were promul-
gated.”44

Differences exist not in the essence of the Manifestations,45 but in their his-
torical mission. Revelation is not an abstract event, it always takes place in a his-
torical context. The cultures of mankind have produced widely divergent views,
ways of thinking and structures of consciousness. Their social orders, too, have
always differed, as have the “ailments” attacking the body of society, so that dif-
ferent “medicaments” had to be prescribed in each case.46 Thus, divine revelation
as God’s instrument for the education of mankind is related to, and inevitably re-
flects, both the cultural-historical conditions and the level of comprehension of
the people of a particular time.47 Every Messenger of salvation was thus also the
“bearer of a specific Message”.48 Hence, the revealed truth which confronts man
with a claim to absolute validity is relative.49 All religious truths which we en-
counter in the traditions of the historic religions are but “facets of one truth”,50
facets of an ultimate Truth of which man, if only because of the limitations of

language, can never partake in its completeness.51 The fact that the Manifestations
appear to vary in “the intensity of their light”52 is inherent, as Baha-’u’lla-h says,
“not in the light itself”, but “should rather be attributed to the varying receptivity
of an ever-changing world”.53 Seen in this light, there is a mystic unity among
these heralds of the Ultimate Reality, in which is manifested the transcendent
unity of the religions. Ultimately there is, as the Ba-b formulates it, only the “one
and indivisible religion of God",54 "una religio in rituum varietate",55 as Cusanus
called it. The Qur’a-n calls it Islam.56

That differences exist between the religions is self-evident, but this does not
constitute a compelling argument against the thesis of the unity of the religions.
Differences can be discerned in the horizontal dimension; they belong, as Anne-
marie Schimmel formulates it, “to the outer sphere of the religion”,57 to the
“”husk”, in which forms, rites and above all the Law are set down,58 i. e. those
aspects of a religion that are historically conditioned, whereas the differences in
the metaphysical concepts used are due to the varying cultural environment of the
revelation, to the diverse developments of human existence within the multifari-
ous cultures of the world,59 as well as to the historical fragmentation of the reli-

> among the religions of the world are due to the varying types of minds” (Selections from the Writings of ‘Abdu’l-Baha-
> , Haifa 1978, 31:5 [p. 63). In another place Hick appositely refers to the fundamental insight of Immanuel Kant that

gious traditions.60 The differences lie not in the light itself, but in the object on
which it falls, similar to the way in which the sun appears in the mirror as a disk,
but in the crystal as fire.61 In their essential teachings the religions constitute “the
changeless Faith of God, eternal in the past, eternal in the future”.62

Thus, the plurality of the religions is in accordance with the divine plan of sal-
vation. Heilsgeschichte (lit: the history of salvation) is the entire history of relig-
ion, encompassing all the revealed religions. Revelation is a progressive, cycli-
cally recurring event, open to the future. Baha-’u’lla-h has declared invalid all
claims to the finality, uniqueness and unsurpassability of any one religion.63

Hence, a theological paradigm shift has evidently taken place. In contrast to
the traditional paradigm in which the history of salvation was seen as an evolu-
tionary process leading up to a final act of redemption whereby a unique figure
has redeemed mankind once and for all,64 unsurpassably and finally, the new
paradigm is one of a divine ‘economy of salvation’, an ongoing process of divine
“education of the human race”65 through successive outpourings of divine revela-

scendent unity of the religions that is firmly established in the divine plan of sal-
vation.

III.

This poses the question of the extent to which Baha-’u’lla-h’s unity paradigm can
be introduced into the dialogue among the religions and how it can be made fruit-
ful for collaboration between the religions, especially for the “Global Ethic Pro-
ject” in its efforts to work out from the holy writings of mankind common stan-
dards for right and wrong, good and evil, binding norms, values, ideals, aims and
maxims on which all people of good will can agree. Indeed, the viability of our
increasingly interdependent world society depends on such a consensus on fun-
damental values being reached.

1. According to the criteria elaborated by theologians67 and the guidelines68

set out by the Ecumenical Council of the Churches in 1977, interfaith dialogue is
a critical dialogue which should be characterized by frankness and honesty and
carried on in a spirit of reconciliation and humility. It should not serve the pur-
poses of theological apologetics or be used for the image-enhancement of the par-
ticipant’s own religions, nor should it obscure the differences that exist69 or lead
to the kind of indifference or liberalism which accepts everything and which
leaves the question of truth out of consideration. Such dialogue does not aim at
the conversion of one participant by the other, but rather at mutual understanding,
mutual appreciation and “transformation”.70 Trust, understanding and the readi-
ness to cooperate for the benefit of the whole of mankind can develop only from
dialogue that is characterized by openness and understanding, from an encounter,
which "honestly perceives that which unites and that which differentiates”.71

Each faith has its distinctive characteristic and its inalienable positions, its
proprium. It would be dishonest to avoid mention of positions which arise from
unequivocal Scriptural statements, just because they are not compatible with rival
manners of belief. Hence, one must realise that, for the Baha-’i-s, the revelation of
Baha-’u’lla-h is the path of salvation, the “Path of Truth”.72 In contrast to post-
modern subjectivism, the Baha-’i- Faith, like all religions,73 makes a claim to truth
which is universal, and that is inseparable from the clear statement that recogni-
tion of the Faith is necessary for salvation.74 In the process of interfaith dialogue
this claim to truth is no more amenable to compromise than is the idea, immanent
in the unity paradigm, of a progressively unfolding revelation, an evolutionary
Heilsgeschichte. This idea implies the consummation of former revelations and
the fulfilment of their promises.75 The new “Book of God" — according to Baha-
’u’lla-h “the unerring balance in which all is weighed”76 — is the scale against
which the other religions are to be assessed. The new revelation is, so to speak,
the divine “reformation”,77 the “time of harvest”,78 the “day of ingathering”79 as
Baha-’u’lla-h, alluding to the Gospel of St. Matthew80, proclaimed in his Tablet to
Pope Pius IX.

The doctrine of “progressive revelation”81 admonishes the Baha-’i-s to conduct a
personal “inner dialogue”82 with the earlier dispensations of religious faith, since
these are also a part of their religious identity. It is obvious, however, that this in-
terpretation, which treats the former revelations in an inclusivist manner and thus
relativises them, is incompatible with the way in which the other religions see
themselves and is unacceptable to them. Therefore it cannot be made the basis for
dialogue. This is one of those insoluble conflicts between divergent claims to

truth that affect all interfaith relations.83 One must live with these differences and
tolerate the contradictory convictions. The dialogue begins at those levels at
which there is compatibility and from where statements on questions of life — in
this case that of ethics — can be made. Belief in the mystic unity of the religions
is a level from which a dialogue among the religions can, indeed, be conducted.

2. Such a belief necessarily results in the rejection of exclusivism whereby
one religion is regarded as the sole bringer of salvation, while the other religions
are condescendingly dismissed as “unbelief”84, or even as “religions of false-
hood”,85 and its adherents labelled “unbelievers" or “heathens”. The historical re-
ligions have been neither “abolished” nor “invalidated” by Baha-’u’lla-h’s epiph-
any, nor is his revelation the “only true”, the “solely valid and right” doctrine.86
The religions of mankind are not merely part-truths, reflections of the human
striving for transcendence, not just a "ray of the truth”,87 they are divinely
founded, manifestations of the Word of God, Paths to Salvation.88 Their Holy
Books are testimonies to the Truth and integral parts of Holy Scripture in a
broader sense, since they all originate from the same source. With the exception
of the historically conditioned elements, the verities proclaimed in these Holy
Books have eternal validity.89

88   Of Christ it is said: “Blessed is the man who, with a face beaming with light, hath turned towards Him” (Baha-’u’lla-h, Glean-

> mette/Ill. 1970, p. 53), the Qur’a-n as “the Straight Path”, “the Way of God unto all who are in the heavens and all who

3. Furthermore, theological universalism has far-reaching practical conse-
quences for law and ethics. Legal norms, attitudes and religious practices promot-
ing separatism and belittling other religions or discriminating against their adher-
ents are rejected in the revelation of Baha-’u’lla-h. In His Writings are to be found

a) the explicit abrogation90 of the Shi-‘ite concept of “uncleanness”,91 accord-
ing to which all non-Muslim peoples are considered 92 “unclean”93 and are to be
avoided,94

b) the prohibition of cursing95 and blaspheming those of other faiths, as it is
practised in some religions,96

c) the abrogation of the prohibition of marriage to an adherent of another re-
ligion.97

The removal of discriminative barriers is the prerequisite for one of the com-
mandments given by Baha-’u’lla-h to his followers — and one which is unique in
the Holy Writings of mankind: To consort with the believers of all religions “with
amity and concord”, “in a spirit of friendliness and fellowship”.98 This implies not

just the abrogation of the Qur’a-nic law not to take infidels or believers in other
faiths as friends.99 It also amounts to a command to conduct dialogue with other
religions in the same spirit, in order to overcome the old attitudes of division, dis-
putation and delusion toward those of other faiths.100 The reconciliation of the re-
ligions101 is a major goal of Heilsgeschichte, because it is the foundation of the
“world-wide reconciliation”102 called for by Baha-’u’lla-h, and which is the prereq-
uisite for lasting world peace.103

In addition, mention should be made of the high esteem in which the virtues of
tolerance104 and forbearance105 are held, the unequivocal condemnation of reli-
gious fanaticism,106 the emphatic warnings against proselytism,107 bigotry,108 use-
less theological “disputation”,109 “fruitless excursions into metaphysical hair-
splittings”110 and “useless disputes.”111 Religion, whose purpose is love, harmony
and peace among people,112 must not lead to estrangement, discord, strife, enmity
and hatred.113

What is required, therefore, is more than just tolerance; the adherents of other
religions are to be met with love and affection, “with joy and radiance”, in “ten-
der mercy and free from animosity and hatred”.114 Thus, as Baha-’u’lla-h has him-
self declared, “the doors of love and unity have been unlocked and flung open to

the face of men”, and all that spiritually divides them, that causes “dissensions
and divisions” amongst them, has been “nullified and abolished”.115

The interfaith dialogue demanded by Baha-’u’lla-h is not an end in itself. Its
purpose is, rather, to serve the highest goal of religion, namely “to safeguard the
interests and promote the unity of the human race, and to foster the spirit of love
and fellowship amongst men”.116 Therefore, Baha-’u’lla-h calls on the religious
leaders and rulers to arise for the rehabilitation of the world, to consult together
and “administer to a diseased and sorely-afflicted world the remedy it re-
quireth”.117 The Baha-’i-s are thus admonished to cooperate and engage in joint
service with the other religions for the benefit of mankind. The attempt to convey
a universal ethical code — basic moral values which can be found in the tradi-
tions of all religions — to a world in a state of “a fundamental crisis”,118 “in ag-
ony”,119 and foundering on the verge of chaos is a project in which the Baha-’i-s
wholeheartedly collaborate because of their commitment to the oneness of man-
kind and their belief in the divine origin of all religions. Let us consider how the
relationship between religion and morals is seen in the Baha-’i- Faith.

IV.

1. As I have pointed out in detail elsewhere,120 moral values are of an axio-
matic nature. No logical proof of their truth can be supplied. It is neither within
the competence of science to create absolute moral standards, nor can it be de-
fined in scientific terms, how man should act in order to live a fulfilled life; and
only to a limited degree is reason able to recognise what is right and what is
wrong.121 It is man’s presumptuousness, his hubris if he succumbs to the tempta-
tion of imagining that he could distinguish between good and evil in absolute
sovereignty, wanting to be as God122. In his book Global Responsibility123 Hans
Küng has convincingly demonstrated124 that supreme values, absolutely binding
norms, cannot have a purely rational foundation, nor can they be established emo-
tionally in the human conscience solely by the power of reason; moral imperatives
can derive only from the Absolute, from the Ultimate Reality.

Religion alone is able to create a system of transcendental values and ideals, to
build up a hierarchy of values, to translate moral values into standards of behav-
iour, to pass them on by education to the younger generation and to keep them
alive in the consciousness of society. Torn loose from their metaphysical moor-
ings, these values lose their characteristic of faith and common sense to the point
where they are no longer “believed”, but instead critically questioned and ne-
gated. In the long run, moral standards can only be upheld if they have this char-
acter of faith: One must believe in them. Indeed, religion alone is able to invest
man’s central values with an inner authority and to urge him to comply with the
standards which are derived from it.125

Without this Ultimate Reality, which we call God, morality lacks its last hold.

Max Pribilla SJ aptly formulated this insight in the twenties: “Without God, mo-
rality is cut adrift: The last moorings are gone... Why should man tremble before
barriers which he himself or those like him have erected? Even culture, humanity
and common weal pale to an unsubstantial illusion if, without a ray of eternal
hope, happiness and life are to be sacrificed therefore.”126

Without morality, as was already known in Antiquity,127 the law is not viable.

Without a world ethic, without “a minimal fundamental consensus concerning
binding values, irrevocable standards, and fundamental moral attitudes”,128 it is
impossible to imagine a “new global order”,129 as envisaged130 and so urgently en-
joined upon mankind by Baha-’u’lla-h in the nineteenth century.

2. These fundamental values are to be found with various emphases and ex-
pressed in different language in all the religious traditions. It is in this aspect that
the unity of the religions, which is central to Baha-’i- belief, is most clearly evi-
dent. In addition to the “Golden Rule” and the four basic commandments: “not to
kill, not to steal, not to lie, not to fornicate”131 cited in the Declaration Towards a
Global Ethic, the religions share a multitude of common features and show some
striking parallels. Although the main emphasis of each religion is different as re-
gards specific moral instructions, they all teach that people should do good and
avoid evil; they all teach that violation of the prescribed ethical standards — “sin”

125   “These virtues do not appear from the reality of man except through the power of God and the divine teachings, for

they need supernatural power for their manifestation” (‘Abdu’l-Baha-, Some Answered Questions 15:8 [p. 80]).

— has consequences for one’s salvation; and all religions include the idea that the
individual bears a metaphysical responsibility for his actions.

Baha-’i-s believe that these universal values have their ultimate source in God,
that these values which constitute the core of the law of religious law,132 are eter-
nally valid133 and have been repeatedly renewed in the successive revelations. The
Baha-’i-, who finds in the Writings of Baha-’u’lla-h a new law of God134 and an im-
mense wealth of ethical ordinances,135 recognises in the ethic of the religions re-
flections of that light “which illumines all men”,136 the “spiritual, immutable
law”,137 which is the fundamental reality of all religions and is “changeless and
eternal”,138 and leads man to salvation.139 He sees in it a lex aeterna (founded not
in the contingent world, but in the sovereign Will of God)140, the “Archimedian

139   Baha-’u’lla-h does not make a claim to originality for his ethical instructions, since he repeatedly refers to the “sacred

point”, “the Sure Handle”141 for the individual and for society, a fixed frame of
reference that is not open to criticism, that sets the goal and shows the way, the
“Straight Path”142 with its irremovable barriers to arbitrariness in human behav-
iour, thus keeping society in equilibrium and laying the foundation of civilisation
and culture. These universal fundamental norms are as timeless as is the goal of
all religion: the establishment of justice, love and brotherliness among people,
and the establishment of unity, peace, progress, security and well-being in the po-
litical sphere.143

3. This existing global ethic, the common spiritual heritage of mankind,144

cannot be allowed to remain an abstract ideal; it must be implanted and nurtured
in the hearts of every human being.145 The project of a global ethic, therefore, has
an eminently pedagogical dimension: Because the quality of humanness is spiri-
tual in essence, because, as Schopenhauer so rightly pointed out, religion alone
can refer to the continuance of human existence after death and the transcendent
moral significance of our actions,146 only a religious education is able to tran-
scend the prevailing attitude of nihilism and the relativisation of all values, and,
hence, to arrest the moral decline of society. Only a religious education can an-
chor the common ethic in the conscience of men and motivate them to apply it in
their daily lives.

Since the character and the conscience of an individual are formed in the first
years of life,147 the moral education of the child has priority over the merely cog-
nitive,148 according to ‘Abdu’l-Baha-. The global ethic must therefore be taught in
all schools,149 which — Baha-’u’lla-h states — must “first train children in the
principles of religion, so that the Promise and the Threat recorded in the Books of
God may prevent them from the things forbidden and adorn them with the mantle

for other people, with love for their neighbour, with solidarity and civic sense,
and can bestow on them the inner strength which will enable them to respect the
rights of others, to forgo the temptations of private enrichment at the expense of
the public weal, to curb their vital urges and anarchic impulses, to withstand the
lure of selfishness and the temptations of vice and to resist hedonism, that way of
life devoted to consumption, luxury and satisfaction of the basic drives151. Such
an education alone can instill into children’s minds the sense of human dignity, so
that “once they come of age, they will cast their beams like brilliant candles on
the world”152 and become “true reminders of the virtues of God amidst men”153 in
