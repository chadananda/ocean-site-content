           Memorials of the Faithful :

The Virtues of Inner and Outer

Transformation

Marlene Koswan

1\. Introduction

The appearance of God’s Manifestation initiates a twofold
process of disintegration of the old world order and integration
of the new world order.1 ‘Abdu’l‑Bahá’s book Memorials of the
Faithful provides insights into the integration process
associated with the lives of a group, who recognized the new
Manifestation of God, and later accepted His eldest son,
‘Abdu’l‑Bahá as the appointed Center of the Covenant and sole
Interpreter of His Writings. This study was initiated after
reading two observations Marzieh Gail included in her Proem to
Memorials of the Faithful. “...it is a kind of testament of values
endorsed and willed to us by the Bahá’í [sic] Exemplar.... These
are short and simple accounts, but they constitute a manual of
how to live, and how to die” [MF xi]. What values did
‘Abdu’l‑Bahá identify for these 79 individuals who were closely
associated with Bahá’u’lláh during his period of exile from
Baghdad to the prison of Akká? Why did ‘Abdu’l‑Bahá feel it
was important to leave a record? Some insight comes from
Bahá’u’lláh:

180                                             Lights of Irfán vol. 17

> And yet, is not the object of every Revelation to effect a
> transformation in the whole character of mankind, a
> transformation that shall manifest itself both outwardly
> and inwardly, that shall affect both its inner life and
> external conditions? For if the character of mankind be
> not changed, the futility of God's universal
> Manifestations would be apparent. [KI 240]

In order to identify the inward and outward transformation
of the Faithful2, a simple process for analysis was used. Each
time a virtue was mentioned for an individual it was recorded.
If a virtue was mentioned multiple times for one of the
Faithful, it was recorded as a single occurrence. No attempt has
been made to interpret any actions as being an example of a
virtue. The summary was then reviewed to identify how the
internal and external virtues were demonstrated in the
character, manners and conduct of the Faithful, and when
details were provided by ‘Abdu’l‑Bahá, how the Faithful
achieved the virtue. The Faithful’s conduct was investigated in
greater detail using the stages of transformation described in
Bahá’u’lláh’s book, The Seven Valleys, and will be used as a
guide for achieving the goal of recognizing the Manifestation
of God.

Before presenting the results of this study it would be useful
to summarize the evolution of our understanding of spiritual
values in the context of religious history. A brief review of the
Judaic, Christian and Islamic teachings related to the
development of moral principles will be presented. This is not
meant to be a comprehensive study, but provides background to
Bahá’u’lláh’s quotation above, that one of the reasons the
divine Messengers have been sent is to effect internal and
external changes in the life of the faithful that are in accordance
with the requirements of the time in which they live.

2\. Jewish, Christian, and Islamic moral principles

Judaism

In Judaism, Moses presented the guidance of God to His
followers in the form of the Ten Commandments [Exodus 20:2-
17]. The first four Commandments focused on mankind’s
behavior in his relationship to his Creator.

> 1. You shall have no other gods before Me.
2. You shall not make for yourself a carved image... you shall

not bow down to them nor serve them...

> 3. You shall not take the name of the Lord your God in vain...

4. Remember the Sabbath day, to keep it holy...

The remaining six Commandments guide the believers’ behavior
with the rest of mankind and their external conduct.

> 5. Honor your father and your mother...
> 6. You shall not murder.
> 7. You shall not commit adultery.
> 8. You shall not steal.
> 9. You shall not bear false witness against your neighbor.
10. You shall not covet your neighbor's house... neighbor’s

> wife, his male... female servant, nor his ox, donkey, nor
> anything that is your neighbor’s....

The limited number of rules makes sense given pen and paper
were not available during the time of Moses; most people could
not read; and a list of ten rules was easily memorized.

Christianity

Christians continued to use the Ten Commandments as
guidance for their daily conduct, plus they adopted the spiritual

182                                          Lights of Irfán vol. 17

values of Christ. Several examples of these values are
summarized in the Beatitudes. The Beatitudes appear in two
locations, in Mathew during the Sermon on the Mont eight were
identified3, and in Luke, four were mentioned. The Beatitudes
unique to Matthew include the meek, the merciful, the pure of
heart, and the peacemakers. These teachings are spiritually
focused, and include guidance for both internal (e.g. “Blessed
are the pure in heart”) and external transformation (e.g.
“Blessed are the peacemakers”).

The Catholic Church later adopted seven additional virtues—
four Cardinal virtues and three Theological Virtues. The
number seven is significant because it represents God and divine
perfection. The Cardinal virtues were identified by Greek
philosophers Aristotle and Plato, who regarded temperance,
wisdom, justice, and courage as the four most desirable
character traits. The number four refers to the material world
(e.g. four seasons, four directions). These virtues were called
Cardinal, which means hinge, because all the other virtues hang
on them. After the New Testament was written, faith, hope and
charity were referred to as the Theological virtues. The number
three references the Holy Trinity, and it is believed that these
virtues may only be acquired and improved through the Grace
of God. The source of these virtues comes from Paul, First
Corinthians 13:13: “...and now abide faith, hope, love, these
three: but the greatest of these is love...” The use of the word
charity should not be confused with the donation of money or
goods to the needy; this virtue is referring to man’s Love of
God and love of humanity on behalf of God.

Islam

In the Quran, Mu˙ammad provides new guidance for the
believer which focuses on their inner and outer behavior. Some
of the areas addressed included behavior related to knowledge,
spiritual development, speech, and manners and new virtues

Virtues of Inner and Outer Transformation                         183

such as moderation,          honour,    courtesy,   generosity,   and
truthfulness.

Mu˙ammad stresses the importance of truth and knowledge:
“and shun the word that is false” [al-Hajj 22:30], “O ye who
believe! If a wicked person comes to you with any news,
ascertain the truth, lest ye harm people unwittingly, and
afterwards become full of repentance for what ye have
done” [Al-Hujurat 49:6], and “And pursue not that of which thou
hast no knowledge...” [al-Isra' 17:36].

Mu˙ammad’s guidance for spiritual development includes:
“There is a mosque whose foundation was laid from the first day
on piety; it is more worthy of the standing forth (for prayer)
therein. In it are men who love to be purified; and Allah loveth
those who make themselves pure...” [at-Taubah 9:108]. “Most
Gracious are those who walk on the earth in humility” [al-Furqan
25:63], “eat and drink: But waste not by excess, for Allah loveth
not the wasters” [al-Ar'af 7:31], and “ be moderate in thy
pace” [Luqman 31:19].

The believers received the following guidance related to
speech and its use: “Invite (all) to the Way of thy Lord with
wisdom and beautiful preaching; and argue with them in ways
that are best and most gracious” [an-Nahl 16:125], “no burden do
We place on any soul, but that which it can bear;- whenever ye
speak, speak justly” [al-An'am 6:152], and “When a (courteous)
greeting is offered to you, meet it with a greeting still more
courteous or (at least) of equal courtesy...” [An Nisa 4:86].

Fellow human beings are to be treated with magnanimity,
“Those who spend (freely), whether in prosperity, or in
adversity; who restrain anger, and pardon (all) men;- for Allah
loves those who do good” [al-E Imram 3:134], and “do good to
parents, kinsfolk, orphans, those in need, neighbours who are
near, neighbours who are strangers, the companion by your side,
the wayfarer (ye meet), and what your right hands possess: For
Allah loveth not the arrogant, the vainglorious...” [An Nisa 4:36].

3\. Overview of Virtues in Memorials of the Faithful

Memorials of the Faithful is a gift from ‘Abdu’l‑Bahá to
future generations. In these brief accounts we are provided with
“a testament of the values endorsed and willed to us by the
Bahá’í Exemplar”. We will now see how the Faithful lived these
virtues through the eyes of ‘Abdu’l‑Bahá. The Faithful includes
a group of 79 believers, including some family members, who
were exiled and or imprisoned with Bahá’u’lláh, or provided
Him some type of service. A list of the 82 virtues ‘Abdu’l‑Bahá
mentioned in Memorials of the Faithful has been summarized in

Table 1: Memorials of the Faithful mentions 82 virtues
Virtues of Inner and Outer Transformation                     185

‘Abdu’l‑Bahá found virtue in everyone, from the servant and
water carrier to the calligrapher and scholar. When the data was
analyzed to determine if certain occupations were identified
with the same virtues, no pattern was found. This was a
difficult analysis to perform because of the small sample size
and the occupation was not identified for everyone in the
Memorials (16% were not identified). The individuals with the
highest number of different virtues mentioned included a group
of people from diverse backgrounds, Óájí ‘Alí-‘Askar-i-Tabrízí,
a merchant, Mishkín-Qalam, calligrapher, Áqá Ibráhím-i-
Ißfahání, trader, Óájí Mu˙ammad-Ridáy-i-Shírází, servant,
Ismu’lláhu’l-Aßdaq, scholar, Mu˙ammad-Ibráhím-i-Tabrízí,
trader, ‘Azím-i-Tafríshí, water carrier, Ustád Báqir and Ustád
Ahmad, carpenter, Óájí Mírzá Mu˙ammad-Taqí, the Afnán,
merchant, Ustád Qulám-‘Alíy-i-Najjár, carpenter, and Áqá
‘Alíy-i-Qazvíní, occupation unknown.

The virtues mentioned most frequently were faith (28

individuals), loyalty (28), Love of God (27), love (23),
trustworthiness (21), patience (19), contentment (18), joy (17),
happiness (16), and detachment (15). Table 1 distinguishes two
types of love including: the Faithful’s love of the Manifestation
and love of their fellow human beings. ‘Abdu’l‑Bahá’s
description of how the Faithful demonstrated the three virtues
faith, loyalty and trustworthiness will be presented now.

Faith

‘Abdu’l‑Bahá describes different aspects of the virtue of
faith. In the first group of phrases, “unsullied in faith” [MF 63]
and “His faith is unalloyed” [MF 74], his focus is on purity of
faith. The purifying of their faith and leaving their religious
traditions behind was a way of expanding their love for their
new Faith. As an example, during the early days of Christianity
there were two types of Christians—Jewish and Gentile. These
two groups did not associate with each other because the Jewish
Christians continued their traditions (eating kosher food,

186                                             Lights of Irfán vol. 17

circumcision4, etc.) and felt the Gentiles were unclean.5 Over
time, the Gentile Christians, who did not bring their traditions
into Christianity, grew in numbers to become the religion we
know today. ‘Abdu’l‑Bahá has highlighted the importance of
leaving these traditions behind once one has recognized the
newest Manifestation of God.

The second group of adjectives ‘Abdu’l‑Bahá uses to describe
faith includes “strong” [MF 127], “firm” [MF 164], “firmly
rooted” [MF 164], “and sound in faith” [MF 141]. This description
of faith is not a surprise given the extreme levels of sacrifice the
Faithful had made in order to be in such close proximity to
Bahá’u’lláh. These descriptions of the Faithful are easy to
understand because they use the senses to convey the virtue.
Another form used by ‘Abdu’l‑Bahá to convey faith is the
metaphor of light. In two examples, the reality of faith, which
has no outward form, is described in a way that the reader must
use his inner ears, eyes and heart to understand how it was
demonstrated by the Faithful, “and his brows shone with faith”
[MF 98] and “he had lit the light of faith in the chapel of his
heart” [MF 131].

‘Abdu’l‑Bahá also brings to our attention that faith is not
static, and mentions for one of the Faithful, “his faith and
certitude growing stronger with every passing day” [MF 154].
How did they increase their faith? Guidance is provided by the
activities of various individuals who spent their days and nights
in “the remembrance of God and in teaching His Cause” [MF
180], “reciting Holy Writ, or expounding the Texts, or
unraveling the most complex of spiritual themes” [MF 181],
“communing with God and chanting prayers” [MF 42], “chanting
prayers, communing with God and calling upon Him” [MF 146],
and “remembering and praising God; he chanted prayers, and
carefully attended to his religious duties...” [MF 66].

Loyalty

When ‘Abdu’l‑Bahá mentions the virtue loyalty, he refers to
loyalty to the Covenant. This was particularly important
following the ascension of Bahá’u’lláh when “the fires of tests
leaped up and a whirlwind of violation battered the edifice
down” [MF 159]. During this time, “the absence of Bahá’u’lláh
was not to be endured” [MF 107], “separation consumed us, the
once bright days turned black as night, and all those roses of
other hours were dust and rubble now” [MF 23], and “they were
consumed with sorrow, like candles flickering away; they longed
for death, and stayed firm in the Covenant and labored hard and
well to spread that Daystar’s Faith...” [MF 41]. It is no surprise
that this virtue was second on the list given the critical period
of the Faith’s history, when the Bábís were tested by the
appearance of Him whom God will make manifest, and later
when the early Bahá’ís were tested following the ascension of
Bahá’u’lláh with accepting the Will and Testament of
Bahá’u’lláh and recognizing ‘Abdu’l‑Bahá as the one Center of
the Covenant.

Trustworthiness

Closely related to loyalty, is trustworthiness. ‘Abdu’l‑Bahá
addresses this virtue by identifying who trusted the Faithful and
in what capacity they were trusted. The Faithful were
“ trusted companions of ‘Abdu’l‑Bahá” [MF 41], and “Trusted by
everyone...” [MF 55]. Their trustworthiness was demonstrated in
several capacities, “a trustworthy friend” [MF 57], “confidant”
[MF 102], “ attendant and companion” [MF 119], “ helper to every
traveler” [MF 154] and “a trusted refuge...” [MF 107]. Further
explanation will not be provided here because the history of
how both Bahá’u’lláh and ‘Abdu’l‑Bahá suffered betrayal by
their half brothers, Mírzá Yahya and Mu˙ammad-‘Alí, is well
documented elsewhere.

4\. Character, Manners and Conduct

The study of the virtues mentioned in Memorials of the
Faithful will be defined within the framework for trans-
formation outlined by ‘Abdu’l‑Bahá, “The most vital duty, in
this day, is to purify your characters, to correct your manners,
and improve your conduct” [SWAB 13].

The Merriam Webster dictionary defines character, manners
and conduct as follows:

Character: the way someone thinks, feels, and behaves

> Manners: the way that a person normally behaves
> especially while with other people
> Conduct: the way that a person behaves in a particular
> place or situation

Bahá’í Character

In order to narrow down the list of 82 virtues for the
discussion of character, a search of the Bahá’í writings, which
have been translated into English, was conducted. It turned up
six virtues used to describe character. These six virtues appeared
in ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s writings and include happiness6, humility7,
serenity8, mercy9, nobility10 and spirituality11. All of these
virtues were also used to describe individuals in Memorials of
the Faithful, with the exception of mercy. A brief summary of
how the Faithful demonstrated these character virtues follows.

The Faithful were happy under all conditions. One would
expect the Faithful would be happy having recognized and
attained the presence of their Beloved, and ‘Abdu’l‑Bahá
describes one such person, “his heart happy in the presence of
the Beloved of mankind” [MF 68]. This happiness was maintained
even when the external situation worsened. “For some time he
prospered and was happy” [MF 76], “they were perfectly content
with their frugal life, supremely happy” [MF 40], “Now I am

homeless, and happy” [MF 130], and “the greater the tyranny of
the oppressors, the happier he was...” [MF 163].

The Faithful expressed humility before God. While they may
have been humble people before friends, family and coworkers,
this was not the focus of ‘Abdu’l‑Bahá’s comments. “I turned
toward God and, humbly beseeching Him” [MF 44], “and
humbly practicing her devotions” [MF 193], “Humbly entreating
Thy heavenly Realm” [MF 176], “ turning their faces toward Thy
Kingdom, humbly supplicating Thy lofty Realms” [MF 176] and
“spent his time humbly calling upon God, entreating Him,
offering praise...” [MF 79].

The Faithful also experienced serenity in this material plane
and the next world. The majority of the statements in
Memorials of the Faithful were related to the passing of their
souls to the Abhá Kingdom. “...By nature was spiritual
and serene” [MF 55], “he lived to be eighty years old, at which
time, serenely patient, he soared away to the Threshold of God”
[MF 139], “he hastened away, tranquil, serene, rejoicing in the
tidings of the Kingdom, out of this swiftly fading life to the
world that does not die” [MF 155], and “serene and happy,
rejoicing in the tidings of the Kingdom, he soared away to that
mysterious land” [MF 153]. How were they able to achieve this
serenity? They were happy based on their rejoicing in receiving
the Glad tidings on the Kingdom, and humbled by recognizing
the Manifestation of God.

During one of his talks, while visiting the United States,
‘Abdu’l‑Bahá commented that people should express their
thankfulness for the favors of God through action, and not just
verbal thanks. He noted:

> To express his gratitude for the favors of God man must
> show forth praiseworthy actions. In response to these
> bestowals he must render good deeds, be self-sacrificing,
> loving the servants of God, forfeiting even life for them,
> showing kindness to all the creatures. He must be
190                                           Lights of Irfán vol. 17

> severed from the world, attracted to the Kingdom of
> Abhá, the face radiant, the tongue eloquent, the ear
> attentive, striving day and night to attain the good
> pleasure of God. Whatsoever he wishes to do must be in
> harmony with the good pleasure of God. He must
> observe and see what is the will of God and act
> accordingly. There can be no doubt that such
> commendable deeds are thankfulness for the favors of
> God. [PUP 236-237]

The virtues of happiness, humility and serenity focus on how
the Faithful were feeling on a sustained basis. The remaining
two character virtues focus on how the Faithful expressed their
gratitude through praiseworthy actions.

Nobility is defined as the quality of being noble in character,
and having high moral principles or ideals. Three examples of
nobility are summarized here as examples of external
transformation of behavior, through showing kindness,
goodness, generosity and virtuousness. “He spent most of his
time in showing kindness to friend and stranger alike; he was
a magnanimous being, with open hand and heart” [MF 165], “This
man, noble and high-minded ... Learning that his father was a
captive there, he came with all speed to the fortress so that he
too might have a share of those dire afflictions” [MF 140],
“suffering, in his surrender to God’s will he was selflessness
itself. He had no personal aims whatever, no feeling of
attachment to this fleeting world. His one desire was to please
his Lord...” [MF 117].

The last virtue included in this group is spirituality.

‘Abdu’l‑Bahá’s comments draw attention to the unity of the
spiritual and the physical where the life of the spirit must be
reflected in the physical world. This state was achieved by
“Persevering in his devotions, known for holy practices and
nightly communings and vigils, his heart was illumined, and he
was spiritual of mind and soul...” [MF 84]. Spirituality was thus
demonstrated: “In him the inner and outer perfections,

the spiritual and physical, were joined together” [MF 147],
“spiritual of heart, a man detached from all worldly things” [MF
78], “his life spiritual” [MF 8], and “high, spiritual aims...” [MF

\[119\] 

Bahá’í Manners

Bahá’u’lláh identifies good deeds which transform virtues
into spiritual manners in the Kitáb-i-Aqdas. Among the virtues,
He identifies in this Holy Book, the Faithful are to be truthful,
trustworthy, faithful, righteous, fear God, just and fair, tactful
and wise, courteous, hospitable, persevering, detached,
hospitable and to be: absolutely submissive to the Will of God.
In the synopsis and codification of the Kitáb-i-Aqdas, there is
also a list of guidelines for how the Faithful should behave in
relationship to one another. This list includes, “Not to: stir up
mischief, be hypocritical, be proud, be fanatical, prefer one’s
self to one’s neighbor, contend with one’s neighbor, indulge
one’s passions, lament in adversity, contend with those in
authority, lose one’s temper, anger one’s neighbor.”

There are not a lot of examples of how the Faithful
demonstrated manners in Memorials of the Faithful. The reason
for the lack of examples is unknown. It may not have been the
focus of ‘Abdu’l‑Bahá recording these accounts or it may reflect
the living conditions of the Faithful. They were constantly being
persecuted or imprisoned, and the opportunities for
interactions were limited. This period represents that point in
history where the two fold process of the fall of the old world
order and the rise of the new world order was just beginning.
Through the conduct of the Faithful, they achieved the
objective of recognizing the Manifestation of God, and with
His passing accepting His appointed Center of the Covenant.
‘Abdu’l‑Bahá acknowledged one example of manners related to
the virtue of courtesy in the story of Siyyid Mu˙ammad-Taqí
Manshádí.

192                                            Lights of Irfán vol. 17

> He was a treasury of justice and righteousness, entirely
> free from any attachment to worldly things. He had
> accustomed himself to a very spare way of life, caring
> nothing for food or sleep, comfort or peace. He lived all
> alone in a single room, passed the nights on a couch of
> palm branches, and slept in a corner. But to the,
> travelers, he was a spring in the desert; for them, he
> provided the softest of pillows, and the best table he
> could afford... [MF 55].

Bahá’í Conduct

‘Abdu’l‑Bahá provided further context for studying the
conduct of the Faithful during one of the talks he gave during
his visit to the United States.

> Strive with all your power to be free from
> imperfections. Heedless souls are always seeking faults
> in others. What can the hypocrite know of others’ faults
> when he is blind to his own? This is the meaning of the
> words in the Seven Valleys. It is a guide for human
> conduct. As long as a man does not find his own faults,
> he can never become perfect. Nothing is more fruitful
> for man than the knowledge of his own shortcomings.
> The Blessed Perfection says, “I wonder at the man who
> does not find his own imperfections.” [PUP 244]

The Seven Valleys was written in Baghdad after Bahá’u’lláh
returned from the mountains near Sulaymániyyih. It was written
in response to a question from a judge who was a student of
Sufi philosophy. The goal of the Sufi was to attain the presence
of God through meditation, prayer, contemplation and ecstasy.
In The Seven Valleys Bahá’u’lláh describes the seven stages of
the wayfarer’s path with the two goals of recognizing God’s
Manifestation for the age and breaking attachment with the
material world, purifying and preparing the mind and heart. The
Seven Valleys acts as a guide for conduct, and we will now look

at ‘Abdu’l‑Bahá’s description of the Faithful as they
demonstrate the process of walking through the Valleys.
Comments will be limited here to a few examples per Valley,
with a brief summary of the virtues needed, or actions needed,
to pass through the Valley, followed by one or two examples
from Memorials of the Faithful which demonstrate the virtue or
action.

Valley of Search

In order to pass through the Valley of Search, Bahá’u’lláh
recommends the seeker focus on their inner transformation and
spiritual search. Success in passing this Valley is achieved when
the Faithful demonstrate, “The steed of this Valley is
patience...” [SV 5], “Nor should he be downhearted...” [SV 5], “It
is incumbent that they cleanse the heart...” [SV 5], “...turn away
from blind imitation...” [SV 5], and “...sacrifice all things...” [SV

\[7\] 
‘Abdu’l‑Bahá cites an example of the Faithful demonstrating
patience, and freeing themselves of attachment from this world,
when he recounts the story of Ismu’lláhu’l-Aßdaq in the battle
of Fort Tabarsi. ”To begin with, they were far from home,
surrounded and cut off by the foe; again, they were starving;
and then there were the army’s sudden onslaughts and the
bombshells raining down and bursting in the heart of the Fort.
Under such circumstances to maintain an unwavering faith and
patience is extremely difficult, and to endure such dire
afflictions a rare phenomenon.” [DB 395 n. 1]

The story of ‘Abdu’lláh Baghdádí is provided as an example
of someone’s inner transformation, and how he demonstrated
his purity by cleansing his heart.

> Even among the nonbelievers, people were astonished at
> the change. What could have come over this youth, they
> wanted to know; how did it happen that he was suddenly
> detached from the world, eager and devoted? “He was

> tainted, corrupted,” they said; “today he is abstemious
> and chaste. He was sunk in his appetites, but is now the
> soul of purity, living a righteous life. He has left the
> world behind him...” [MF 130]

The words of Táhirih remind us of the importance in turning
away from blind imitation.

> Let deeds, not words, testify to thy faith, if thou art a
> man of true learning. Cease idly repeating the traditions
> of the past, for the day of service, of steadfast action, is
> come. Now is the time to show forth the true signs of
> God, to rend asunder the veils of idle fancy, to promote
> the Word of God, and to sacrifice ourselves in His path.

Let deeds, not words, be our adorning! [MF 200]

Valley of Love

In order to pass through the Valley of Love Bahá’u’lláh
revealed the Faithful must “forsake thine outward eyes; thou
shalt never open the eye of thine inward being...” [SV 9], “A
lover feareth nothing and no harm can come nigh unto him...”
[SV 9], and “...veils of the satanic self be burned away at the fire
of love...” [SV 9].

When describing the Love of God, ‘Abdu’l‑Bahá gives
physical form to the unseen, by using the metaphor of burning
candles, fire and stars. Fire has at least two functions in the
Bahá’í writings; it can be used to burn away the veils and
illusions which are blocking the seeker, or with increased
intensity it acts as a power of attraction and welds together
diverse elements. The inner transformation of the Faithful is
very clear in the following descriptions of their veils of satanic
self being burned away, “Then his love of God burned away
every obstructing veil and idle thought...” [MF 22], “...but
the love he had for God was past all concealing. It burst from
his heart, flamed out and consumed its coverings...” [MF 2],
“...and they burst into flame with yearning love for God...” [MF

176],and “...the love of God sparked a revolution in the country
of his inner self...” [MF 83].

The love the Faithful experienced for the Manifestation of
God, transformed them to the point where they were willing to
accept pain and endure great hardship for extended periods of
time. One example of an individual, who demonstrated this
love, feared nothing and no harm came to him, was Mullá ‘Alí -
Akbar. ‘Abdu’l‑Bahá recounts,

> Things came to such a pass that in the end whenever
> there was an uproar Mullá ‘Alí would put on his turban,
> wrap himself in his ‘abá and sit waiting, for his enemies
> to rouse and the farráshes to break in and the guards to
> carry him off to prison. But observe the power of God!
> In spite of all this, he was kept safe. “The sign of a
> knower and lover is this, that you will find him dry in
> the sea.” That is how he was. His life hung by a thread
> from one moment to the next; the malevolent lay in wait
> for him; he was known everywhere as a Bahá’í—and still
> he was protected from all harm. He stayed dry in the
> depths of the sea, cool and safe in the heart of the fire,
> until the day he died... [MF 11]

Valley of Knowledge

In the Valley of Knowledge Bahá’u’lláh explains that the
wayfarer is now aiming for higher spiritual goals. These are
demonstrated when the Faithful “...turn to the guiding light of
the fear of God...” [SV 11], “He beholdeth justice in injustice,
and in justice, grace...” [SV 12], “...if he meeteth injustice, he
shall have patience...” [SV 13], “...if he cometh upon wrath he
shall manifest love...” [SV 13], and are “...freed from turning
towards ourselves...” [SV 16].

‘Abdu’l‑Bahá acknowledges how the Faithful “...longed
for knowledge of God...” [MF 106], and after recognizing
Bahá’u’lláh as the new Manifestation “...drank the red wine

196                                             Lights of Irfán vol. 17

of knowledge from the hands of the Cupbearer of grace...” [MF
49]. He also noted that their education was not limited to
religious studies and included the sciences of the material world.
For example, one gentleman was “...well versed in many
branches of knowledge. For a long time he was in the schools,
specializing in the fundamentals of religion and religious
jurisprudence, and making researches into philosophy and
metaphysics, logic and history, the contemplative and the
narrated sciences...” [MF 156]. The importance of educating
women is also confirmed with his comments about Táhirih,
“...she studied various branches of knowledge and the arts,
achieving remarkable ability in literary pursuits. Such was the
degree of her scholarship and attainments that her father would
often express his regret, saying, “Would that she had been a
boy...” [MF 191].

The transformation of the Faithful is once again reflected in
their conduct. Living under difficult situations ‘Abdu’l‑Bahá
records how Mishkín-Qalam turned to the guiding light of the
fear of God.

> After the ascension of Bahá’u’lláh, Mishkín-Qalam
> remained loyal, solidly established in the Covenant. He
> stood before the violators like a brandished sword. He
> would never go half way with them; he feared no one
> but God; not for a moment did he falter, nor ever fail in
> service... [MF 100]

The story of the wayfarer in the Valley of Knowledge, who
beholds “justice in injustice, and in justice, grace”, shares
similarities with the story of Nabíl-i-Akbar.

> Here, his enemies struck at him again. He was pursued
> by the watchmen; guards looked everywhere for him,
> asking after him in every street and alley, hunting him
> down to catch and torture him. Hiding, he would pass by
> them like the sigh of the oppressed, and rise to the hills;
> or again, like the tears of the wronged, he would slip

> down into the valleys. He could no longer wear the
> turban denoting his rank; he disguised himself, putting
> on a layman’s hat, so that they would fail to recognize
> him and would let him be. In secret, with all his powers
> he kept on spreading the Faith and setting forth its
> proofs, and was a guiding lamp to many souls... [MF 3]

Mullá ‘Alí-Akbar, was an example of one who if he came
upon wrath, he manifested love.

> For the sake of God he cast all caution aside, as he
> hastened along the ways of love. He became as one
> frenzied, as a vagrant and one known to be mad. Because
> of his new Faith, he was mocked at in Tihrán by high and
> low. When he walked through the streets and bázárs, the
> people pointed their fingers at him, calling him a
> Bahá’í... [MF 10]

Valley of Unity

In order to pass through the Valley of Unity Bahá’u’lláh
revealed the Faithful must “With the ear of God he heareth,
with eye of God he beholdeth the mysteries of divine
civilization...” [SV 17], “...seeth in himself neither name nor
fame nor rank...” [SV 18], and “...looketh on all things with eye
of oneness...” [SV 18].

‘Abdu’l‑Bahá identifies several of the Faithful who “He seeth
in himself neither name nor fame nor rank.” One of these was
Mírzá Mihdíy-i-Káshání. “This noble personage had been
honored among men, but for God’s love he lost both name and
fame. He bore manifold misfortunes with never a complaint.
He was content with God’s decrees, and walked the ways of
resignation...” [MF 97]. This level of detachment from personal
fame and rank could have been used to describe each of the
Faithful, for they had sacrificed their social status and jobs, and
the possibility of improving their fame and rank, in order to be
close to the Manifestation of God. Being so close to Bahá’u’lláh

198                                          Lights of Irfán vol. 17

they were able to listen as the Revelation was revealed and with
their eyes witnessed His behavior under these difficult
situations. ‘Abdu’lláh Baghdádí was one whose “...burning heart
broke when he saw how victimized was Bahá’u’lláh,
how patiently He suffered. ‘Abdu’lláh yearned to die for Him.
And thus it came about that he offered up his life for his tender
Companion, and hastened away, out of this dark world to the
country of light...” [MF 130].

Valley of Contentment

In order to pass through the Valley of Contentment
Bahá’u’lláh revealed the Faithful “...feeleth winds of divine
contentment...” [SV 29], “...burneth away the veils of want...”
[SV 29], “From sorrow he turneth to bliss, from anguish to
joy...” [SV 29], and “...throw thy life down in His path...” [SV
31]. We can only imagine the joy, happiness and contentment
the Faithful must have experienced having recognized the
Manifestation of God, and living in such close proximity to
Bahá’u’lláh.

One person who felt the winds of divine contentment was
Mu˙ammad-‘Alí Sabbáq of Yazd who ‘Abdu’l‑Bahá notes,

> The friends, one and all, were pleased with him, and he
> was cherished at the Holy Threshold; in this state he
> soared to abiding glory, leaving his kin to mourn. He
> was a kind man, an excellent one: content with God’s
> will for him, thankful, a man of dignity, long-
> suffering... [MF 58]

Mírzá Mustafá Naráqí is an example of one who did throw
his life down in His path. ‘Abdu’l‑Bahá recounts,

> The farráshes hunted them down, and caught Mírzá
> Mustafá. But then the oppressors said, “Mírzá Mustafá
> had two long locks of hair. This cannot be the right
> man.” At once, Mírzá Mustafá took off his hat and

> down fell the locks of hair. “Behold!” he told them. “I
> am the one.” They arrested him then. They tortured him
> and Shaykh Ahmad until finally, in Tabríz, those two
> great men drained the cup of death and, martyred,
> hastened away to the Supreme Horizon. At the place
> where they were to be killed, Mírzá Mustafá cried out:
> “Kill me first, kill me before Shaykh Ahmad, that I may
> not see them shed his blood!...” [MF 149]

Valley of Wonderment

The state of the Faithful in the Valley of Wonderment, is like
no other, and appears totally mystical for “...the traveler is
flung into confusion...” [SV 32], “...wearied out with his own
life...” [SV 32], and Bahá’u’lláh alludes to “...how many worlds
concealed...” in dreams [SV 32], and “...planes and states are
folded up and hidden away within him...” [SV 34].

The world of dreams is provided as proof of a spiritual
existence, where people see without eyes, hear without ears, and
speak with out mouths. The story of Táhirih provides one
example,

> One night when it was getting along toward dawn she
> laid her head on her pillow, lost all awareness of this
> earthly life, and dreamed a dream; in her vision a youth,
> a Siyyid... appeared to her in the heavens; he was
> standing in the air, reciting verses and praying with his
> hands upraised. At once, she memorized one of those
> verses... After the Báb had declared His mission, and His
> first book, “The Best of Stories,”6 was circulated, Táhirih
> was reading a section of the text one day, and she came
> upon that same verse...she fell to her knees and bowed
> her forehead to the ground, convinced that the Báb’s
> message was truth... [MF 193]

Two interesting examples of planes and states folded and
hidden away are summarized here as examples of the sudden

200                                            Lights of Irfán vol. 17

appearance of knowledge and what appears to be a miracle.
Pahlaván Ridá, brother of Áqá Mu˙ammad-Báqir and Áqá
Mu˙ammad-Ismá‘íl,

> ...was a man to outward seeming untutored, devoid of
> learning. He was a tradesman, and like the others who
> came in at the start, he cast everything away out of love
> for God, attaining in one leap the highest reaches of
> knowledge. He is of those from the earlier time. So
> eloquent did he suddenly become that the people of
> Káshán were astounded... [MF 167]

Mírzá Ja‘far -i-Yazdí,

> Then the sick man breathed his last. Mírzá Áqá Ján ran
> to Bahá’u’lláh, with word of the death. Not only had the
> patient ceased to breathe, but his body was already going
> limp. His family were gathered about him, mourning
> him, shedding bitter tears. The Blessed Beauty said, “Go;
> chant the prayer of Yá Sháfí—O Thou, the Healer—and
> Mírzá Ja‘far will come alive. Very rapidly, he will be as
> well as ever.” I reached his bedside. His body was cold
> and all the signs of death were present. Slowly, he began
> to stir; soon he could move his limbs, and before an hour
> had passed he lifted his head, sat up, and proceeded to
> laugh and tell jokes... [MF 158]

Valley of True Poverty and Absolute Nothingness

In order to pass through the Valley of True Poverty and
Absolute Nothingness Bahá’u’lláh revealed the Faithful must be,
“...poor in the things of the created world, rich in the things of
God’s world...” [SV 36], “...burn away all veils and wrappings...
outer wealth or personal opinions...” [SV 36], and “...must stray
not the breadth of a hair from the law...” [SV 39].

‘Abdu’l‑Bahá provides guidance on what the Faithful
detached themselves from in order to be rich in the things of

God’s world. “His detachment from the things of this world and
his attachment to the life of the spirit are indescribable” [MF
43], “...a man who lived free and detached from friend and
stranger alike” [MF 36], “they freed themselves from friend and
stranger alike, escaped from the superstitions that had blinded
them before...” [MF 63], “He was detached from every selfish
thought, averse to every mention...” [MF 70], and
“...kept free from every unseemly thought, and shunned
whatever went contrary to the Covenant of God...” [MF 56].
One of the Faithful who gave up everything was Ustád Ismá‘íl.

> Composed, happy, Ustád gave up his work, closed his
> eyes to his possessions, and left for Iraq, where he lived
> in poverty. He had recently taken a bride, and loved her
> beyond measure. Her mother arrived, and by subterfuge,
> obtained his permission to conduct the daughter back to
> Tihrán, supposedly for a visit. As soon as she reached
> Kirmánsháh, she went to the mujtahid, and told him that
> because her son-in-law had abandoned his religion, her
> daughter could not remain his lawful wife. The mujtahid
> arranged a divorce, and wedded the girl to another man.
> When word of this reached Baghdad, Ismá‘íl, steadfast as
> ever, only laughed. “God be praised!” he said. “Nothing
> is left me on this pathway. I have lost everything,
> including my bride. I have been able to give Him all I
> possessed... [MF 29]

Bahá’ís have a two-fold responsibility: the first is to
recognize the Manifestation of God, and the second is to follow
His commandments. We will end this section on conduct, with
the story of one who did not stray the breadth of a hair from
the law, Hájí ‘Alí-‘Askar-i-Tabrízí.

> Then he took a little merchandise with him from
> Adrianople, and left for the city of Jum‘ih-Bázár, to
> earn his livelihood. What he had with him was trifling,
> but still, it was carried off by thieves. When the Persian

> telling me to lie and bear false witness. Do with me as

> [MF 162]

5\. Conclusions

This study was initiated with the objective of answering three
questions: What virtues did ‘Abdu’l‑Bahá highlight for this
group of faithful individuals? How did they demonstrate inner
and outer transformation in their character, manners and
conduct? How did they achieve this transformation?

What were the virtues? ‘Abdu’l‑Bahá recorded 82 virtues in
Memorials of the Faithful which we need to “purify our
characters, correct our manners and improve our conduct”.
Faith, loyalty, love of God, love, trustworthiness, patience,
contentment, joy, happiness, and detachment were the most
frequently mentioned virtues.

How was it demonstrated? The Faithful succeeded in knowing
themselves and recognizing that which leads to loftiness.
Studying The Seven Valleys along with Memorials of the
Faithful provides a basis for understanding the conduct of the
Faithful and a framework for identifying the behavior which led
them to recognize the new Manifestation of God and later
accept ‘Abdu’l‑Bahá as the Center of the Covenant.

How was it achieved? ‘Abdu’l‑Bahá explains virtues are not
static, and the Faithful worked on increasing their faith daily by
praying, remembering God, calling upon God, communing with
God, and teaching His Cause. Tests and obedience to the laws
also developed the Faithful’s virtues.

‘Abdu’l‑Bahá provides us with the context for the virtues in
Memorials of the Faithful, and his focus changed depending
upon the situation or relationship of the individual he was
discussing. Character, manners and conduct will change
depending upon the needs of the day: for example, loyalty to
the Covenant during the time the Faithful lived referred to
following Bahá’u’lláh and ‘Abdu’l‑Bahá, but today this
obedience has grown to include obeying and supporting the
Universal House of Justice.
