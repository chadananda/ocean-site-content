Proofreading and posting these documents is being handled by [_bahai.works/World_Order_](https://bahai.works/World_Order), and most are now online (original series only).

For those who want the whole thing on their own computer, here is a link to a dropbox directory listed by year and month rather than volume and issue

Volume 1 of the original series was the same as volume 25 of the _Star of the West series._  
It looks like World Order except the cover said "The Baha’i Magazine: dedicated to the New World Order":
