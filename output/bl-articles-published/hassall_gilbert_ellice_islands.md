The Origins of the Bahá’í Faith in
the Pacific Islands: The Case of the
Gilbert and Ellice Islands
GRAHAM HASSALL

Abstract
“Modern religious history” in the Pacific Islands generally refers to the conver-
sion of Pacific Islanders to Christianity by Catholic and Protestant missionaries.
In the case of the British colony of the Gilbert and Ellice Islands (GEIC—today
the independent states of Kiribati and Tuvalu), the introduction of the Bahá’í
Teachings in the 1950s perplexed secular and religious authorities alike. This
paper uses colonial records and other sources to examine the ways in which the
arrival of a new and little-understood religion disturbed the delicate church-state
relationship operating at that time. The possibility exists that these interactions
were experienced in similar ways in other colonial environments that had compa-
rable sociopolitical conditions.

Résumé
« L’histoire religieuse contemporaine » dans les îles du Pacifique s’entend
généralement de la conversion au christianisme, par les missionnaires catholiques
et protestants, des habitants des îles du Pacifique. Dans le cas précis de la colonie
britannique des îles Gilbert et Ellice (les États indépendants actuels de Kiribati et
Tuvalu), l’introduction des enseignements bahá’ís au cours des années 1950 a lais-
sé perplexes aussi bien les autorités laïques que religieuses. À l’aide des archives
coloniales et d’autres sources, l’auteur examine comment l’arrivée d’une religion
nouvelle et plus ou moins comprise a perturbé la délicate relation qui existait
alors entre l’Église et l’État. Il est possible que d’autres milieux coloniaux ayant
des conditions socioéconomiques comparables aient vécu le même genre d’inter-
actions.

Resumen
La “historia religiosa moderna” en las islas pacíficas generalmente se refiere a la
conversión de isleños pacíficos a la cristiandad por misioneros católicos y protes-
tantes. En el caso de la colonia británica de las islas de Gilbert y Ellice, (CIGE—
hoy los estados independientes de Kiribati y de Tuvalu), la introducción de
enseñanzas de la Fe Bahá’í en los años 50 dejó perplejas tanto a las autoridades
seglares como a las religiosas. Este papel utiliza expedientes coloniales y otras
fuentes para examinar las formas en que la llegada de una nueva y poca entendi-
da religión estorbó la relación delicada iglesia-estado que funcionaba en aquel
momento. La posibilidad existe que estas interacciones fueron experimentadas de
maneras similares en otros ambientes coloniales que tenían condiciones
sociopolíticas parecidas.

All Pacific Islands societies have rich religious traditions that include a
mythical past and strong attachment in more recent times to Christian
beliefs. From the seventeenth to the nineteenth centuries, Catholic and
Protestant missionaries sailed into the region, and even in the twentieth
century made extensive use of sailing vessels to ensure the spread of the
Gospel throughout the islands scattered across the vast Pacific Ocean. In
a great majority of instances these missionary efforts resulted in the cre-
ation of Christian communities well before the establishment of colonial
governments by the Western powers—notably Britain, Germany, France,
the United States of America, and Spain, which annexed the islands dur-
ing the era of global colonization—mostly in the late 1800s.

By the mid-twentieth century the authority of Christian churches in the
realm of religion and of the colonial powers in secular rule was pervasive
and apparently secure. The various Pacific Island groups gave an appear-
ance of stability and calm, and a sense that the people had consented to the
replacement of much traditional belief and culture by the beliefs and prac-
tices of modern Christianity. This view was also conveyed by much schol-
arship of the time, which relied greatly on the patronage of the missions
and the colonial authorities for access to the field and to official records.
Indeed, anthropologists were often much involved in the colonial project,
contributing their knowledge of indigenous cultures and languages to the

processes of pacification and “modernization.” Missionaries, too, collabo-
rated with colonial authorities toward these ends.

Juxtaposed with this “official narrative” of Church-State collaboration
in the cause of social and political progress is another, which records
considerable resistance to the imposed colonial rule, considerable conflict
between traditional authorities and the new religious leaders, and much
sectarian conflict among the adherents of the new religions.

The emergence of Bahá’í communities in the Pacific Islands provides
an additional layer of complexity. For one thing, the first Bahá’í pioneers
to the Pacific were not part of (and did not see themselves as part of) the
“westernization” and “colonization” of Pacific peoples. They were not
schooled in the Christian missionary tradition, and were for the most
part unaware of the extreme rivalries between the missions themselves,
just as they were unaware of the rivalries between church and state which
pervaded the interactions between these two sources of authority within
the colonies. Bahá’í pioneers were, in contrast, advocates of a global

36            The Journal of Bahá’í Studies 16. 1/4. 2006

worldview premised on the subordination of nationalism and of race
inequality. The distinction between these two approaches to religious
conversion is profound, and the premise of this paper is that in the
Gilbert Islands, in the 1950s, their collision produced widespread confu-
sion concerning the true motivation of the pioneers and the first
islanders who chose to become Bahá’ís.

This paper thus examines the establishment of a Bahá’í community
among the Polynesian and Micronesian peoples of adjoining archipela-
goes in the North Pacific Ocean known as the Gilbert and Ellice Islands.
From 1892 to 1976 the British-controlled Gilbert and Ellice Islands
Colony (GEIC) combined the inhabitants of sixteen islands of the
Gilberts group, who are ethnically Micronesian, with those of the eight
inhabited islands of the Ellice group, who are Polynesian. Together, the
landmass of the widely scattered islands amounts to just 788 square
kilometers. In 1978 the Ellice Islanders gained independence as Tuvalu,
and the following year the Gilbertese established the independent
nation of Kiribati: they now constitute two of the smallest independent
nations in the world and, as low-lying atolls in the midst of the Pacific
Ocean, are increasingly vulnerable to the rising sea levels due to climate
change.

Roy and Elena Fernie brought the Bahá’í Teachings to the colony in
1954 in response to a specific objective of the World Crusade
(1953–1963) (Hassall, “Bahá’í History”). Their intention to settle in the
islands permanently, and to impart the Bahá’í teachings at a pace conso-
nant with the gradual establishment of mutual understandings with
their neighbors and with those in authority, was thwarted—ironically—
by the sudden and widespread interest in the new religious ideas they
promoted among the Gilbertese. This response culminated, after a
tumultuous first year of residence, in Roy Fernie’s deportation from the
colony by the British authorities, at the urging of the established mis-
sions. Although these events occurred little more than fifty years ago,
oral histories concerning them have contained a number of errors that I
will seek to correct in this article. Efforts by theologians and historians
of religion have provided some insights into the episode, which I will

attempt to enhance through the use of previously unexamined historical
records.

SCHOLARSHIP AND THE GROWTH OF TWO BAHÁ’Í COMMUNITIES

To date, scholarly references to Pacific Islands Bahá’í communities are
few in number and brief.1 The most complete accounts are those of
Hassall (“Pacific Bahá’í Communities” and “The Bahá’í Faith”) and
Williams. Of these accounts, the one by Ieuti contains the most focus on
the Bahá’ís of Kiribati and Tuvalu.

Official reporting on religious change in the two countries has been
similarly unresponsive. Until 1973, for instance, the official biennial
reports of the Gilbert and Ellice Islands Colony produced by the British
administration stated: “In 1954 two representatives of the Bahá’í Faith
arrived in the Gilberts and there is now a small Bahá’í community”
(Foreign and Commonwealth Office)—a summary that ignores the rapid
consolidation of the Gilbertese Bahá’í community, and its indigenization
and integration with sister Bahá’í communities in other Pacific Islands.

In 1959 the GEIC Bahá’í Community had assisted in the establishment
of the Regional Spiritual Assembly of Bahá’ís of the South Pacific, and in
1967 had established the National Spiritual Assembly of the Bahá’í of the

38            The Journal of Bahá’í Studies 16. 1/4. 2006

Gilbert and Ellice Islands. By 1963 its membership had reached 521 (1
percent of the population) and spread across fourteen of the Colony’s
thirty-three islands (McArthur and Craig, table 12).

In recent decades the Bahá’í communities of Kiribati and Tuvalu have
continued to record growth in both membership and institutional devel-
opment. In 1979, 8.77 percent of the population was recorded as Bahá’í,
and by 1986 there were ninety Local Assemblies and a total of 140 towns
and villages that included Bahá’í communities. In Tuvalu, Bahá’í statistics
indicated that 5.8 percent of the population was Bahá’í by 1987, and in
1991 the Universal House of Justice noted that the Bahá’í community had
attained the status of one of the “common religions” in Tuvalu. The 2000
census listed 2052 Bahá’ís, amounting to 2.4 percent of the national pop-
ulation of 84,494 (cited in Tenten, 466).

This rapid growth of Bahá’í communities, in addition to the growth of
other new religious groups in Kiribati, has resulted on occasion in calls by
parliamentarians and others for bans on “new religions.” It has also led, on
a more positive note, to a genuine interest among Gilbertese scholars to
understand the motivation for religious change. In 1992, for example, a
graduate of the Pacific Theological College in Fiji published a thesis seek-
ing to understand these events and calling on representatives of the
newer religious traditions to contribute their own histories in the interest
of promoting interreligious understanding. Ieuti introduced his study by
explaining:

Several new religious movements have come to Kiribati since
> World War II. Most significant for Kiribati history in terms of their
> growth and impact on society are the Seventh-Day Adventist Church,
> the Bahá’í World Faith and the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day
> Saints. Other religious bodies in Kiribati are the Kiribati Protestant
> Church and the Roman Catholic Church, both established in the
> 1800s and some more new religious movements, such as the Church
> of God and Assemblies of God. None of the older groups has expe-
rienced significant growth since World War Two. The Kiribati

> Protestant Church has experienced a considerable erosion of mem-
> bership into the three major new religious movements. (72)

Ieuti’s description of the origins and emergence of the Bahá’í com-
munity in the Gilbert and Ellice Islands was a serious effort to use oral
histories, as well as some source material, to seek clarification about its
origins. In the following section I use this rendition to present under-
standings of the Fernie years as they exist within the Gilbertese Bahá’í
community, before presenting new documentary evidence that provides
some factual corrections as well as some substantial contributions toward
a fuller understanding of the conflict.

Ieuti offers the following account:

In 1954 Roy and Elena Fernie from the national Spiritual Assembly
> in Panama arrived as Bahá’í pioneers in Kiribati. They went to
> Abaiang and established their center there. During their stay the
> Fernies conducted meetings; these brought opposition from the
> Roman Catholic priest who told his congregation not to attend such
> meetings. In trying to suppress the Fernies and the Bahá’í Faith, the
> priest began to criticize them in the Roman Catholic newsletter, Te
> Itoi ni Ngaina, stating that they came to destroy the Christian reli-
> gion. Timeon Tamaroa, a Bahá’í, told me that the priest actually con-
> tributed to the spreading of the Faith in the whole group as the
newsletter was read by so many people.

In spite of the Fernies’ problems, they managed to convert a
> Roman Catholic, Kanere Koru, who became their interpreter. The
> people, because of their curiosity, wanted to know more about this
> new religion, so they began to flock around the Fernies and to hear
> their teachings. The Roman Catholic priest did not give up his oppo-
> sition. He informed his superior in Tarawa, the bishop, to ask the
> government to send the Fernies away and send Kanere back to his
> native island, Tabiteuea. In those days, to be a registered religious
> organization, a group needed 100 members, so the government
40            The Journal of Bahá’í Studies 16. 1/4. 2006

> approved of sending the Fernies away. However, in a single night
> nearly 300 people registered. The government issued a certificate of
> registration on 24 September 1955 authorizing the Bahá’í Faith as a
> legal religion known as the Spiritual Assembly. Nevertheless, the
> government managed to send Roy Fernie away in 1955, although his
> wife Elena stayed to continue the work. She was responsible for the
spread of the Faith on Abaiang.

Kanere was sent back to Tabiteuea, his home island. There he con-
> verted a Protestant minister who was under discipline by his church.
Together they spread the Bahá’í Faith on Tabiteuea.

Elena established a school which attracted people as they wanted to
> be educated. The Morkiao [Morikao] school on Abaiang established
> by the ABCFM2 was full, so parents who saw education as a means of
> getting good status for their children sent their children to the Bahá’í
> School. Further progress in education was seen in the establishment
> of another four Bahá’í primary schools on Tabiteuea Island. The
> Bahá’ís could not continue these schools as they did not get approval
> from the Universal House of Justice, and in the late 1950s they were
> closed down. . . .” (101)

ADDITIONAL EVIDENCE AND ANALYSIS

This account is an attempt in good faith to reconstruct the origins of
the GEIC Bahá’í community. It presents some correct information, but
also some errors of fact, as well as some interpretations of events that are
open to alternative possibilities. The Universal House of Justice, for
instance, was first elected in 1963, so it could not have “closed down”
Bahá’í schools in the Gilbert Islands in the 1950s: these schools closed for
lack of finances and competent teachers. But perhaps most importantly,
the article glosses over the tumult and intrigue that accompanied the
Fernies’ first months in the colony. It doesn’t explore the role of person-
ality and the interests and attitudes of other central actors in the islands
in the 1950s: colonial administrators, both Catholic and Protestant mis-
sions, island-level leaders, and individual Gilbertese. Most significantly, it

overlooks the possibility that Gilbert Islanders had made individual and
community choices to change their religious affiliation, just as it neglects
discussion of their right to do so, and the consequences they faced as a
result of exercising their rights. Ieuti suggests, for instance, the Fernies
“managed to convert” Kanere, in a way that dismisses the initiative taken
by Kanere to investigate the introduced religion, and subsequently
embrace it (as described below). Kanere was born the fourth of nine
children at Tanaeang, North Tabiteuea, on 3 March 1920 (Groves). In
1933–38 he studied at the Catholic seminary at Buota, Abaiang, but decid-
ed against the priesthood and became a wireless operator and later a
teacher. At the time of his declaration his bishop had been trying to per-
suade him to rejoin the Church and enter mission employment. Kanere
had seen Esslemont’s book Bahá’u’lláh and the New Era on the Fernies’
bookshelf, and had insisted on reading it. Kanere subsequently remained
an ardent promoter of the Bahá’í Teachings until his passing some three
decades later.

ROY AND ELENA FERNIE AND THE ESTABLISHMENT OF THE GEIC BAHÁ’Í
COMMUNITY

Elena Maria Fernie (née Marsella, d. 2002), originally from Providence,
Rhode Island, had trained as a concert pianist before entering the United
States foreign service. She pioneered to the Caribbean in 1945 and in
1950 was elected secretary of the first National Spiritual Assembly of
the Bahá’ís of Central America and the Antilles. Roy Fernie (d. 1964),
whose wealthy family owned the C. Fernie Steamship Company, was born
in the Panama Canal Zone and spent his school years in England. In the
mid-1940s he returned to the Canal Zone from a period spent in St.
Louis, Missouri, and soon after heard of the Bahá’í Faith from his future
wife, Elena. He became a Bahá’í in March 1953, and the couple married
in May. With the announcement of the goals of the World Crusade that
year, the Fernies decided to pioneer in the Pacific. The Central American
Assembly was responsible for the entry of pioneers to three island
groups: the French overseas territory Tuamotu Archipelago, the

42           The Journal of Bahá’í Studies 16. 1/4. 2006

American trusteeship of the Marshall Islands, and the British colony of
the Gilbert and Ellice Islands. As pioneers were already making plans to
enter the first two of these remote island groups, the Fernies focused on
getting to the Gilbert Islands, a task made difficult in the first instance
by their absolute ignorance as to the islands’ whereabouts, and the inabil-
ity of even the British consul in Panama to assist them with any infor-
mation concerning means of travel to them. Having eventually found the
colony’s location to the north of the Fiji Islands, the Fernies departed by
boat for Suva, the capital of the British colony of Fiji. After two months
of residing with a family of Indo-Fijian Bahá’ís, during which no trans-
portation was available to complete their journey, an opportunity arose
when a ship was required to urgently convey a supply of kerosene to the
GEIC.

Permission to enter the colony was granted through the generous assis-
tance of a Gilbertese trader named Schutz. The reason for this individ-
ual’s cooperation has not been established. There were no hotels in the
GEIC, and few western-style houses, and when the authorities sought at
first to deny the Fernies entry on grounds of lack of suitable accommo-
dation, Schutz assured them that the travelers could reside in his home
until able to construct a home of their own. With this guarantee they
gained permission to enter, and arrived on the group’s main island,
Tarawa, on 4 March 1954. Approximately five days later the Fernies trav-
eled on Schutz’s trading vessel to Abaiang, where they commenced resi-
dence in his home, as arranged. The choice of Abaiang Island may have
resulted from no other fact than that it was the only island on which they
could obtain accommodation. The extraordinary events of that first day
were recounted by Elena Fernie:

[A]fter a five hour trip we landed in the lagoon at Abaiang and I
> don’t know how it was done, the Gilbertese there were ready to greet
> us and they came out waving and it seems their custom was to take
> imitangs [Imatang] (white people) off the ship and carry them on their
back.
[T]here we were with our feet on the shore and some more

Gilbertese appeared on the shore line. One was an oldish man—his
name was Abram—which is Gilbertese for Abraham. He had a little
boy with him who was related to him in some way and the little boy
came on up to me with an egg. I was considerably surprised at receiv-
ing an egg but anyway I smiled at him and I took the egg. I no soon-
er had the egg in my hand when Roy snatched it out of my hand—he
was an amateur magician and he could do all kinds of tricks so he
snatched this egg out of my hand pretended to crush it on the little
boy’s head and then it supposedly dropped out of this little boy’s
nose. Well this absolutely sent these Gilbertese into shrieks of laugh-
ter. They couldn’t stop laughing. They laughed for about half an
hour and Abaiang was all doubled over with laughter and all the
other Gilbertese were just beside themselves they were practically
falling on the ground and rolling over and over with laughter.

[W]hen it got dark we suddenly began to hear crackling and out-
side Gilbertese houses they are all swept clean or else around the
houses is nice crunchy gravel . . . and we thought “what on earth is
going on?” . . . finally when we looked out we saw faces and faces
began to appear about 3 feet up and four feet up—everywhere they
could see through the grill, tall ones standing in front, we looked
around the three sides and we were absolutely surrounded, there
seemed like hundreds of Gilbertese and they were silently without a
word, walking all on the gravel peering in at us. . . .

Well we looked at each other and we looked all around at all the sea
of faces, brown faces, and we thought “good heavens, what are they
doing, and what will we do?” . . . Finally we decided we would greet
them. So we said “konemoui” [Ko na Mauri] (a Gilbertese greeting
meaning “may you be blessed”) . . . and they just stood there and
looked at us. . . . Finally Roy said “music is an international language,”
so we had a short wave radio and we turned the radio on the and
music started playing and Roy went “ah, ah” a big pause and delight-
ed sighs all around three sides of the room and we saw that that
pleased them very much. So the music played, and the music played,
nothing else was said all dead silence outside still. I don’t know how

(“Roy and Elena Fernie”)

The subsequent dynamics between the Fernies, the Gilbertese, the
British authorities, and the Christian missionaries appear to have been set
by the events of this one remarkable day. Shoghi Effendi had advised all
pioneers to establish themselves firmly in their new environments before
attempting to promote the Bahá’í Teachings in an active way. It made
sense to become familiar with their new surroundings, and for their neigh-
bors to learn something about them personally, before they introduced
what were potentially radically new ideas. The Fernies followed this
advice as best they could (Hassall, Messages). They did not seek to discuss
religion with anyone, but concentrated their efforts on establishing their
home. However, the warmth of their reception, and their ability to imme-
diately connect with the affections of the island’s population, gave them
an instant profile which they could have scarcely anticipated. Within
weeks of their arrival the Fernies attracted to their Sunday magic and
music shows audiences of such magnitude as raised the ire of the resident
Catholic priest.

In April 1954, one month after arriving on Abaiang, Roy Fernie offered
to assist the Island Council establish a school. He informed the District

Officer that the Island Council had agreed to the idea that each village
would build a dormitory at Buota, south of Tuarabu, where the concrete
floors and cistern still remained from a school formerly operated there by
the Catholic Church. The secretary to government wanted to discuss the
idea with the senior education officer at Bikenebeu (Bikenibeu). Prior to
the Fernies’ arrival, the British administration had been consulting the
Catholic and Protestant missions about provision of schooling. Following
generations of conflict between Catholic and Protestant communities, the
government now sought their cooperation in establishing a network of
schools that covered the population more evenly and that reduced the ten-
dency for competition and conflict between rival school systems. The
London Missionary Society (LMS) had decided to cease offering village-
level schooling. In April 1953 the colony’s highest officials had expressed
the hope that the Sacred Heart Mission could be persuaded to “accept
responsibility for the establishment of island type schools in predomi-
nantly Roman Catholic islands, rather than compete with government in
the establishment of island schools elsewhere” and had assured the
London Missionary Society that the Government would “start to take
over their amalgamated village mission schools as soon as the island type
schools (had) been properly established.”3

Preliminary arrangements had been made in 1954 for the establishment
of Island schools. The people were to pay half the teachers’ salaries
through their cooperative societies. When island councils agreed to these
conditions, the government went ahead with the building of the school.
Abaiang had been the second island to apply under this scheme but was
not given a high priority for government action, as it already had Marist
and LMS “higher” schools. In this context, Roy Fernie’s enthusiasm for
establishing a school was perceived by some as a threat to what the deli-
cate negotiations had achieved.

On 15–16 April 1954 Roy Fernie spoke with J. B. McCaig, acting for the
District Officer at Bairiki, about his proposed school. It would teach
English, and he would contribute sixty pounds per month for a minimum
of five years, an offer McCaig did not take seriously, describing the
American as a “crank.” The District Officer did not want to turn down

46            The Journal of Bahá’í Studies 16. 1/4. 2006

Abaiang Island Council’s request for a school but felt Fernie’s proposal
was “too unwieldy” for one man to accomplish. The Officer also reacted
adversely to his reported comment that he would bring in plenty of
American “wild west and comic strips” to arouse in the boys an interest in
reading English: “I can’t quite balance this enthusiasm,” McCaig reported
in his official correspondence, “with the apparently sound standing of the
missions. If the people are so keen on higher education are they dis-
satisfied with that provided by the existing training schools etc? Has this
scheme been brought to the notice of the Missions? If so, what is their
reaction; and if not, I do not think we can help. Our own position with
regard to the Missions is difficult enough and such a step as Mr. Fernie
suggests seems to me to be the start of a bigger rift, especially with the
SMH.”4

The District Officer, F. N. M. Pusinelli, sought the advice of the
Magistrate on Abaiang about the situation and the following day received
a telegram indicating that Abaiang Council had already approved the
establishment of the school and that the Fernies would be in charge. It
would be a nondenominational school for males and females who had
reached sixteen. The magistrate requested the District Officer’s assistance
in gaining approval quickly.5

On the same date, 31 May 1954, the senior education officer at
Bikenibeu wrote to the Secretary to Government to report the contents of
a letter just received from Rev. E. Jones, head of the LMS Headquarters
for the northern islands:

The Abaiang “old men” are much agog these days because of the
> hypnotic allurement of Fernie’s proposals for a technical Utopia on
> the island. Before local free labour is conscripted in the name of local
> government, I think that the whole thing needs close investigation.
> Everybody interested in education would support a programme of
> technical training, but, as the Greek Sophists often stated: “The real-
> ity of an object is not always what it appears to be!!” One would not
> like to see an aftermath of folly and disillusionment. However, I am
sure that His Honour is fully aware of such dangers!6

In June the Abaiang magistrate further reported to District Officer
Pusinelli that the Fernies had attended a meeting of the Island Council on
the morning of 12 April, attended by just eleven of its twenty-six mem-
bers, but also attended by all the members of the land’s court. Fernie had
written to the Council:

I hear that you are thinking about a school on your island, and the
> reason for our visit is to study the customs and character of the people.
> While we are here we would like to spend our time here among you
> in helping you in this scheme for your people’s advancement. We shall
> not leave you until your school is well established and we shall stay a
> long time among you. The school to be built will be Abaiang’s school
> for everyone irrespective of whether they are Catholic, Protestants or
> Seventh Day Adventists. Every one can be admitted to the school
> from age 16 until they are adults. Abaiang will control the school and
> make the rules and punishments for breaking the rules.7

By October 1954 the school had been established on land leased by the
Fernies. English textbooks had been purchased from the Panama Canal
Zone government, and a “sizeable library” had been established. “Several
serious-minded boys and their wives have also settled on our land,” the
Fernies wrote to Bertha Dobbins, who had recently settled in the New
Hebrides, “and are studying English every day in preparation for future
studies in other subjects”8

In the same period that the school was being established, a number of
Gilbertese became Bahá’ís, and Bahá’í Assemblies were established. With
growth in adherents, “practice” assemblies were formed, at Tuarabu,
Tebero, and Kuria, a development that perplexed the missions as well as
the colonial government. The Fernies were evidently focused on the extent
of their success rather than the social turbulence it was evoking. Elena
wrote to the Australian-based Asian Teaching Committee: “So you see we
are now head over heels in teaching work. Roy spends every night at the
new Bahá’í centre, or visiting other centres. The ‘practice assemblies’ come
to the house and I instruct them. Almost all of our waking moments are

engaged in teaching the Faith. . . . the Faith is tearing through the islands
like a flame and we watch the marvel. . . .” (Bahá’í Bulletin 5).

Near the end of 1955 “over 230 Gilbertese” had “declared their inten-
tion to be Bahá’ís” (Fernie 4). In August Roy Fernie sought to register
Tuarabu as the first Bahá’í Assembly in accordance with the GEIC
Religious Bodies Registration Ordinance, but his efforts in this, as in the
establishment of the school, provoked skepticism from British colonial offi-
cials. District Officer I. G. Turbott explained to Fernie the legal procedures
entailed in registering a religious body, and after the pioneer had returned
the following day with the completed application, reported:

Whilst Fernie says it is the people’s wish, etc, Fernie typed the let-
> ter and it was then accepted by the nine Bahai assembly. Fernie claims
> he knew the requirements of the law and was therefore helping them.
> He regards himself as a ‘steering committee’. Both A. A. O. Tabuna-
> wati and myself formed the opinion that the people really did not
> know what their Bahá’í religion was about but I suggest in the cir-
> cumstances it might be wise to concede to the request for registra-
> tion. Fernie gave me the impression that he was doubtful if it would
> be accepted by the government as he is of the opinion that govern-
> ment are against Bahais and prompt registration might alleviate his
> fears in this respect.9

Tuaruabu’s memorandum dated 30 July was accepted, and in terms of the
law, that Assembly became the head of the Bahá’í community throughout
the colony.

OPPOSITION AND EXPULSION OF ROY FERNIE

Why were the Catholic mission and some British officials so opposed to
Fernie’s initiatives? Given the shortage of educational facilities in the
colony one would have thought that offers of material assistance such as
that made by Roy Fernie would have been welcomed. The answer, it
seems, concerns long-standing efforts to change and control Gilbertese

culture and society, which Fernie’s unanticipated intervention had rapidly
begun to disrupt. As a novice to Gilbertese society and history, Fernie was
most likely unaware of the extent to which the Church was discouraging
cultural practices that it judged to embody “sorcery and magic.” As
recently as March 1949 a District Officer had reported to the Secretary to
Government efforts by Bishop Terrienne to suppress Catholic involve-
ment in Maneaba, or community meeting house, activities:

His Lordship was asked, recently, the reasons for his more latterly
> change of attitude towards these traditional Gilbertese dances [batere,
> ruoia, kamei] and he replied that, although batere in itself may not be
> a pagan practice there is a tendency for natives to undergo certain
> magic rites in order that they might perform well at the dance and so
> attract the attention of a member of the opposite sex. . . . His
> Lordship has announced that maneaba are places of evil and that con-
> verts to Roman Catholicism should not frequent them.10

As if Fernie’s innocent magic tricks were not enough of an irritant
to the Church’s anti-magic campaign, his efforts to establish an
English-language school, and the fund-raising activities he organized
in Turaubu to accomplish it, were perceived as threats to the capacity
of Catholics at Turaubu to raise funds to match those of their rival vil-
lage Koinawa.

Pressure appears to have been put on Abaiang Catholics to have the
Fernies removed from the Island. Landowners who had leased them land
on which they built a house requested that they move, and Abaiang Island
Council, the members of which had been working with the Fernies to
establish a much-desired school, unexpectedly voted to expel the Fernies
and Kanere from the island. A Catholic priest wrote a derogatory article
in The Star of the Gilberts. Two officers were sent to investigate rumors
that Fernie wanted people to become like Americans (and therefore to
reduce their need for the British).

When orders were given that Roy Fernie be deported, some two-
hundred additional Abaiang residents declared their position in the days

50            The Journal of Bahá’í Studies 16. 1/4. 2006

prior to his departure on 25 November 1955, by announcing their wish to
become Bahá’ís. “For Roy it was truly a tragedy,” Elena wrote later. “He
loved the Gilbertese people with all his heart; had he not been deported he
would have remained all his life in those Islands” (“Elena Marsella Fernie”
310). Elena Fernie stayed despite her husband’s deportation until approx-
imately June 1957.11 Fellow pioneer in the Gilbert Islands Mabel Sneider
wrote to the Australian-based “Asian Teaching Committee”:

> Roy has been deported because of attacks by the Catholic Church,
> and is now in Hawaii. Elena has remained, it is certainly obvious that
> they believed she would go with her husband and the Bahá’í Faith

The authorities may have expected her to leave with Roy, but she
remained in the Gilbert Islands for at least another year.

Shoghi Effendi, Guardian of the Bahá’í Faith, wrote to the National
Spiritual Assembly of the Bahá’ís of the British Isles:

In spite of the fact that Mr. [Fernie] has been expelled from

For Kanere, subsequent events were tragic. On Tarawa, waiting for his
wife to give birth and for a ship to take them to Tabiteuea, Kanere
received a deportation order from the administration prohibiting him
from remaining on either Tarawa or Abaiang. Kanere’s wife was denied
adequate medical treatment and died soon after childbirth. Kanere
returned to his home island of Tabiteuea in the Southern Gilberts and
proceeded to spread the Bahá’í principles there, so that by 1960 there
were forty-seven Bahá’ís on the island.12 He remained an active advocate
of the Bahá’í Teachings until his death some three decades later.

Did the experience with Roy Fernie affect the attitude of the British
administration toward the Bahá’í community? Although Roy Fernie was
not allowed to return, British officials distinguished his case from that of
the Bahá’í community as a whole. In Solomon Islands, a British protec-
torate further to the south where a Bahá’í community had recently been
established through the efforts of Gertrude and Alvin Blum, a confer-
ence of District Commissioners was told: “The Colony was having some
difficulty with a few individuals, one of whom was a Bahá’í. His
Excellency briefly explained that Bahá’í was not a militant or political

52            The Journal of Bahá’í Studies 16. 1/4. 2006

religion and that as a religion there was no objection to it. . . . ”13 In a
subsequent dispatch a senior government official mentioned in writing to
the District Commissioner on the island of Malaita, where a Bahá’í com-
munity was soon to emerge: “The Gilbert and Ellice Islands Colony’s
news is to the effect that a man called Fernie, a follower of the Bahá’í
faith, has protested strongly about the Deportation Order made out
against him on the grounds of his generally undesirable conduct. His
representatives in London have raised the cry of ‘persecution’ and have
classified the Colony with Persia, where followers of the Bahá’í faith have
had a thin time lately.14

Within the GEIC, the British administration changed its attitude
toward the Bahá’í community once it became more familiar with the reli-
gion’s tenets and method of administration. By 1956, when the
Community comprised four Local Spiritual Assemblies, and five groups
(Shoghi Effendi, Messages 97), the Assemblies sought legal recognition
under GEIC so that they could acquire and own property.

Legal recognition required the registration of at least one Local
Spiritual Assembly, and Tuarabu Assembly registered under the relevant
law on 24 September 1955. The annual change of “board of trustees”
which resulted from the requirement that Assemblies elect their mem-
bers annually resulted in much paperwork for the British administration
and to the reluctance of the Administration to entertain the idea of fur-
ther registrations. Thus, when other Assemblies sought similar registra-
tion the Resident Commissioner felt the situation was “getting out of
hand”: “Surely it is not necessary to register each separate assembly pro-
vided the parent assembly is registered? If so, we should also register
each separate LMS congregation and the work involved would be fantas-
tic.”15

The District Commissioner came to realize that the Bahá’ís desired to
be a “registered body with pan-Colonial interest.”16 and when explaining
to the Resident Commissioner that the parent assembly was in Suva, the
capital of the Fiji Islands, offered the observation: “It would seem that
the Bahá’í system of giving self-administration to each of its Local

Assemblies is similar, in some respects, to government’s aim of increas-
ing the responsibilities of local bodies.”17 The Resident Commissioner
consequently agreed to register a body named “Bahai World Faith GEIC”
(registration took place on 22 December 1959). The Catholic Church,
after all, had all twelve parishes registered separately, and it was “not
anticipated that the number of Bahá’í assemblies seeking registration
will be numerous.”

CONCLUSION

Why did Gilbertese leave their churches and become Bahá’ís? The most
documented reasons relate to (a) aversion to financial and other obligations
from the churches, and (b) a quest for education. Ieuti also refers to the
attraction of the lifestyle offered by the Bahá’í Faith as well as other “new
religious movements.” Ieuti reported the case of a widow “who failed to
pay her levy and who was told not to come to church services and not to
allow her children to be in the church Youth Fellowship nor to enter and
play in the church maneaba. For this reason, according to Ieuti, the widow
turned to the Bahá’í Faith to find security and real fellowship” (125–26).
Concerning dissatisfaction with the life of the churches, the American
anthropologist Lundsgaarde has reported:

As for the reasons in the major shift in religious affiliations among
> the Buatoa [Buota] villagers, I was consistently told that the converts
> preferred the Bahá’í faith for two reasons: first, because Bahá’í mis-
> sionaries did not require monetary contributions from the villages
> but, in fact, generously contributed both food and medicine to the
> people; and second, the Bahá’í faith did not require people to observe
> the Sabbath. On the basis of these rather fundamental changes it
> would be reasonable to suggest that the maneaba organization at
> Buatoa is headed for extinction. Subsequent interviews with govern-
> ment officials who have always attempted to ameliorate relations
> between disputing religious factions led me to suspect that the picture
54           The Journal of Bahá’í Studies 16. 1/4. 2006

> was, however, far more complicated than this.         (“Post-Contact
> Changes” 75)

While the possibility exists that some conversions were tied to explo-
ration of opportunities for socioeconomic advancement, particularly
through access to education, this cannot have been a sustained motivation
on its own, since the Bahá’í pioneers and the Bahá’í community did not
provide such resources, particularly on the scale achieved by the mission
organizations.

In addition to possible socioeconomic advancement, there were motiva-
tions for conversion rooted in the distinct teachings of the Bahá’í Faith
and pattern of Bahá’í community life. Central among these was the prin-
cipal Bahá’í teaching of the “oneness of humankind.” For Kanere and oth-
ers it was the Fernie’s demonstration of impartiality in matters of race
that commenced the attraction. The Fernies were buffeted by the tensions
that already existed in the GEIC at the time of their arrival. They were
ignorant of the tension that had existed between church and state for
nearly a decade on the question of state-run schools. Roy Fernie fell foul
of local authorities, first through his enthusiasm as an amateur magician
and subsequently through their skepticism at his offer to build a school.
More broadly, however, a deeper reason for misunderstandings with colo-
nial officials was the vastly different approach to “mission” employed by
the Bahá’ís. At a time when most continued to act as though Europeans
and Pacific Islanders were unequal races, the Bahá’í pioneers appear to
have treated the races equally. Whereas leadership in the Christian mis-
sions and churches remained unquestionably in the hands of Europeans,
Bahá’ís elected Gilbertese members to local administrative bodies within
two years of their arrival. Furthermore, they were electing Gilbertese as
delegates to their regional administrative convention within five years.
This rapid indigenization of religious authority was novel to the colony
and was at first misunderstood by government officials. The Gilbertese,
however, saw the matter differently and recognized that here was a reli-
gion that not only preached but also practiced an ethic of common and

equal humanity. This finding requires comparison with the experience of
the first Bahá’í teachers in colonies elsewhere, both in the Pacific and per-
haps also in Africa.
