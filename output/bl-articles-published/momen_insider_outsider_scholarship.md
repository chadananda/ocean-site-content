    Insider and Outsider Sch olarship in

Bahá’í Studies

Moojan Momen

It is difficult to know whether, in discussing this subject, one
should remain within the framework of the immediate matter at
hand: that of scholarship on the Bahá’í community; or whether
one should take the discussion deeper to the foundations of the
problems which of course have been discussed over the
centuries in debates over the relative value of the mind as
against the heart, the analytic approach as against the holistic
one, Enlightenment rationalism as against Romanticism. I feel
that we cannot focus in on the specifics of the discussion
without at least acknowledging the wider context in which the
debate occurs. Therefore I am going to briefly outline the wider
issues involved before focussing on the specifics of scholarship
on the Bahá’í Faith.

The academic study of religion, the history of religions, the
field that in German is known as religionswissenschaft, is firmly
and for very good reasons wedded to a methodology that is
rationalist, materialistic and historically-based - in the sense that
all phenomena are seen to be rooted in, and therefore wholly
derived from, preceding phenomena. This is the basis of the
world view - the weltanschauung - of the academic world.
Academic outsider scholars live within this construction of
reality, this universe of discourse, and like all other human
beings, they take this socially constructed reality to be reality
itself. They take the methodology of scholarship that they have
constructed within this universe of discourse and which is fully
validated within that universe to be the only valid methodology
of scholarship. They privilege statements made within their
universe of discourse over those made from within a different
universe.

So what objections do believing or insider scholars have to
this methodology of the academy? The brief answer is none.
Most scholars think that this methodology when applied with

rigour, flair and fair-mindedness produces knowledge of the
greatest quality and depth. I cannot stress this too strongly
because in debates that have gone on in the past, it has been
claimed that insider scholars are somehow inimical to the
academic methodology and this simply is not true.

The problem that insider scholars have is not with the
academic methodology per se, but with the claim that this is the
only pathway to true and certain knowledge -- the arrogation to
this pathway of a claim of superiority and indeed of exclusivity.
Insider scholars accept the methodology of rationalism and
historically-based argumentation as a way of deriving
knowledge, but they set alongside that other pathways to (and
sources of) knowledge: intuitive knowledge (which `Abdu'l-Bahá
describes as being the result of meditation, the mind conversing
with the soul), a rootedness in the spiritual heritage of humanity
and a belief that this world has a spiritual aspect alongside its
physical aspect, the introduction of values and ethics into
methodology, and lastly a belief in Divine Revelation.
Ultimately these other methodologies yield criteria for truth
that are unacceptable to the strict application of the academic
methodology. They cannot be contained within either the
academic universe of discourse or in the academic methodology.

Insider scholars, especially those who are academically
trained, stand in a difficult place. They are on the interface
between two different and in many ways incompatible universes
of discourse. They have the responsibility of mediating the ideas
of the academy to the world of the believer and also of
correctly representing the world of the believer to the academy.
Given the radical and foundational differences between the two
universes, they are in the position of ultimately never fully
satisfying either world -- the position of being criticised from
both directions.

I want now to bring my presentation from generalities to a
focus on the area of Bahá’í scholarship. Here I think it would be
useful to distinguish between two areas: a core area which deals
with the history and writings of the central figures and
institution of the Bahá’í Faith where I think there will always be
a clash between insider and outsider scholars, and a more
peripheral area concerned with the rest of Bahá’í history and the
application of Bahá’í teachings, where I think there is every
prospect of a relatively conflict-free co-existence.

With regard to the core area, this is as I stated, an area where
it seems to me that there will always be a conflict between

Lights of ‘Irfán Book Nine                                  283

insider and outsider scholars because the conflict is not over
facts that can be resolved by an appeal to the sources -- nor can
the opinions and position of one side be overturned by the
discovery of a new source of information. The differences are
foundational and relate to the fact that statements are being
made from within different universes of discourse. They are
thus in essence not resolvable. There is a great deal we could
talk about, but I want to focus on two key concepts that cause
perhaps the greatest amount of conflict and where this matter
of the existence of two separate universes of discourse stands in
greatest contrast. The first of these is Divine Revelation, a
concept that we have already mentioned above and which is one
that I think outsider scholars understand even if they do not
accept it. The second is the Bahá’í concept of the Covenant and
here I think that many outsider scholars do not even understand
the concept, especially its ramifications, let alone accept it.

Divine Revelation is the idea that a single individual has
access to a source of knowledge that is outside this phenomenal
and contingent world. This idea of the authority of the words
and ideas of a particular individual, Bahá'u’lláh, and the
assertion that he is outside the contingencies of history and of
the relativism of knowledge to which all human beings are
subject is alien to the academic mind. Academic outsider
scholars will insist on treating Bahá'u’lláh as a product of his
times, whose ideas and teachings were derived from his
education, his milieu and life experiences and his interactions
with others. Insider scholars will understand such presentations
of Bahá'u’lláh but will think them both inadequate and
distorted. They will insist that, although the time, context and
culture within the setting of which Bahá'u’lláh's words were
written can provide useful information about how these words
should be understood, these words can also be legitimately
understood in ways that are outside this setting.

The second area that I want to speak about is that of the
Bahá’í concept of the Covenant. This is an especially revealing
example because it sets up axioms that verge on being
unintelligible to the academic; for example, the idea that when
Shoghi Effendi is engaged in interpreting one of the passages of
the writings of Bahá'u’lláh, he is not deriving interpretations
that are based on his own understanding and experience (the
historical contingency of being Shoghi Effendi), but rather they
are the result of some supra-natural guidance being imparted by
Bahá'u’lláh. Shoghi Effendi's words, in these circumstances,
impart the import that Bahá'u’lláh himself wishes to give these

284                                 Insider and Outsider Scholarship

word. Similarly, the concept of the Covenant implies that, when
the Universal House of Justice is engaged in its work of
legislation or in leading the Bahá’í community, then its decisions
are not the result of a balance among the various human
personalities that sit upon the House of Justice but are again
supra-mundanely guided by Bahá'u’lláh. Such concepts lead
inevitably to accusations by outsiders that insider scholars
privilege the statements of the central authorities in the Bahá’í
Faith over the statements of others. They lead to accusations of
anachronism, where the authority of Shoghi Effendi is used to
define what Bahá'u’lláh meant. And of course, they lead to
frustration among outsider academics that Bahá’ís refuse to
limit their analyses of Bahá'u’lláh's words to the prevailing
academic methodologies.

Thus I would maintain that scholarship in this core area from
an outsider perspective is fated to always be in conflict with the
Bahá’í community and insider scholars are fated to stand in an
uncomfortable intermediary role between two universes in
discord. Disagreements between insider and outsider academics
over points in this core area are fated to remain unresolved and
unresolvable, with neither side fully comprehending the other.

In the area of the periphery, however, there is much less
likelihood of conflict occurring. Historical or sociological
studies of Bahá’í communities or the broad area that could be
described as applied Bahá’í studies do not inherently have the
same problems as the core area. At the periphery, one is dealing
with ordinary Bahá’ís, their lives and their attempts to put into
practice the teachings of Bahá'u’lláh. In this area, scholars,
whether insiders or outsiders, are free to postulate that
individuals act in accordance with contingent influences upon
them -- their culture, education and life experiences; the
statements of particular individuals are not privileged over
those of others and, while popular Bahá’í literature may often
have recourse to the supra-natural, Bahá’í scholars will usually
not.

Is it an implication of what I have written that it is not
possible for a Bahá’í scholar to do good academic scholarship in
the core area? I think not. While the theory may be that good
academic scholarship is based on a cold, neutral, detached,
agnostic, objective methodology, in practice the best
scholarship emerges from those who are enthusiastic, passionate
and involved. In the area of Bahá’í studies, we need look no
further than the early years of E G Browne, the founder of the

Lights of ‘Irfán Book Nine                                   285

field. His enthusiasm, passion and involvement cannot be
doubted. The same characteristics led him later to a similar
passionate involvement in the Persian Constitutional
Revolution on the side of the Constitutionalists. Indeed, I
would argue that it is Browne's very passion and involvement
with his subject that makes his scholarship so compelling. Thus I
see no reason to suggest that just because a person is involved
in their subject they are therefore necessarily incapable of good
scholarship. Insider academic scholarship is however a difficult
endeavour -- being placed in between two universes that are in
conflict and having to reflect and explain each to the other.

Lastly, do I think that it is impossible for an outsider to do
good scholarship on the Bahá’í Faith? No, I think an outsider has
every chance of seeing things from a new perspective, and
therefore seeing aspects of the Bahá’í Faith that insider scholars
may miss because of their insider perspective. Therefore I
welcome and look forward to increasing amounts of outsider
scholarship. The only proviso that I would make in this regard
however is that the outsider scholar must be sincerely seeking
knowledge and truth -- not using a veneer of academic
methodology to camouflage a prejudice against the Bahá’í Faith
nor an agenda against the institutions of the Bahá’í Faith. For
just as I think an enthusiasm and a genuine sense of warmth and
empathy for one's subject is an important ingredient of good
scholarship -- so I think a prejudice or concealed hatred of one's
subject matter results in distortion and poor scholarship.
