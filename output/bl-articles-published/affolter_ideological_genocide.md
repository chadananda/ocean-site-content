The 20th century will not only be remembered for its extraor‐
dinary scientific achievements, but also for the horrendous
mass killings, genocide and politicide it has witnessed.
Thirty‐six episodes have been registered between 1955 and
1998 alone, where regimes have targeted ethnic, religious, or
political groups for destruction, in whole or part (Harff,
Gurr and Unger, 1999, p. 1). In order to explain how geno‐
cide evolves and how it could be prevented, genocide
researchers frequently turn to cases such as the Holocaust of
Nazi Germany, the Turkish Genocide of the Armenians,
Paul Pot’s auto‐genocide in Cambodia, the mass killings in
Argentina (Staub, 1989), or, most recently, the genocides that
have taken place in Rwanda, East Timor, and former Yugo‐
slavia.

The Iranian Bahá’í Community is an example of a
minority group that throughout its 150 year history has suf‐
fered ongoing persecutions and attempts of what Smith
(1998) terms as “ideological genocide” 1 ; it also is one of the

1The Genocide Convention adopted by the United Nations defines the
crime of genocide as “acts committed with the intent to destroy in whole
or in part, a national, ethnical, racial or religious group” by killing
members of the group, causing them serious bodily or mental harm,
creating conditions calculated to bring about their physical destruction,

The Specter of Ideological Genocide           77

few documented cases of a minority that has managed to
resist peacefully, and to somewhat protect itself by rallying
world public opinion in support of its struggle for survival.
As such, the case of the Bahá’ís of Iran serves as a case study
on how ideological genocide evolves, and how those
affected can persevere and survive despite all odds.

The Bahá’í Faith is an independent religion founded
by Mirzá Husayn Alí (1817‐1892), known as Bahá’u’lláh. It
has its own sacred literature, religious and social tenets as
well as practices, and is governed by democratically elected
administrative bodies (Safra, Yannias and Goulka, 1998). The
1988 Britannica Book of the Year lists the Bahá’í Faith
(together with Islam and Christianity) as one of the most

preventing births, or forcibly transferring children to another group
(cited in Staub, 1989, p. 6).

Staub himself describes the meaning of genocide as an attempt to
exterminate a racial, ethnic, religious, cultural, or political group, either directly
through murder or indirectly by creating conditions that lead to the group’s
destruction.

Ideological genocide is defined as a political tool used to protect and
defend a particular contemporary ideology thought to be instrumental in the
development of a brave new world free of offensive human material (Smith,
1998, p. 8). Smith states:

> In the twentieth century, the range of victims has greatly
> increased; moreover, almost all of them have been selected for
> genocide because of who they are, because in the eyes of the
> stronger group (whether majority of minority) they do not
> deserve to live. The victims, otherwise so different, have only
> three attributes in common: for historical, situational or
> ideological reasons they have been defined as beyond the
> circle of moral obligation and thus as inhuman; they are
> vulnerable to genocidal attacks, whether sporadic or sustained,
> selective or indiscriminate…. (ibid, p. 11)

widespread global religious systems on earth (Barrett, 1988,
p. 303). Counting over 5 million members worldwide, a
fairly large percentage resides in its birth country Iran (over
300,000). Since the inception of the Bahá’í Faith in the middle
of last century, the Bahá’í community of Iran has experi‐
enced ongoing persecutions. Since 1980, human rights
bodies of the United Nations have passed several resolutions
on Iran’s human rights violations that made specific mention
of the persecution of the Bahá’ís.

To list the Iranian Bahá’ís as a group existing on the
brink of ideological genocide is warranted since the aggres‐
sion it has experienced is based on the intent to destroy, in
whole or in part, the Bahá’í Community as a separate reli‐
gious entity (Frelick, 1987). It is ‘ideological’ in nature since
the Iranian authorities’ motives to strike violently against the
Iranian Bahá’ís is based on the desire to consolidate the
Islamic Revolution as the chief instrument for the purifica‐
tion of society and the reestablishment of Islamic law, order
and justice.

This paper describes the history of persecutions of the
Iranian Bahá’ís as well as the characteristics of the contem‐
porary attempts of the government of the Islamic Republic
of Iran to suffocate the Iranian Bahá’í community. Next, the
motivational causes and socio‐political circumstances that
may have led to the killings and attempted ideological geno‐
cide will be analyzed. Finally, the paper presents the efforts
undertaken by Bahá’ís around the world to protest against
the persecutions of Bahá’ís in Iran, and the reasons why

The Specter of Ideological Genocide   79

global advocacy was effective enough to stall the Iranian
regime’s intents to crush the Iranian Bahá’í community.

A review of the persecutions of the Bahá’ís in Iran

The marginalization of the Iranian Bahá’ís under the
current Iranian Government is the result of historical efforts
of the Shí’i clergy to devalue and persecute a religious
minority. These developments are rooted in 19th Century
Persia, when a young merchant, known to history as The
Báb (Arabic: The Gate) (1819‐1850) announced publicly his
claim of being the fulfillment of Shí’i Muslim prophecies for
the coming of the 12th Imam, who would restore true guid‐
ance to the Shí’i community (Nabil Zarandi, 1932; Amanat,
1989). The Báb attracted a large following from many strata
of society, including influential mullas and scholars of Shí’i
Islam.

Initially, the mullas hoped to stop the Bábí movement
from spreading by denouncing its followers as apostates and
enemies of God. These denouncements resulted in mob
attacks, public executions and torture of early Bábís. When
the Bábís (in accordance with Koranic principles) organized
to defend themselves, the government sent troops into a
series of engagements that resulted in heavy losses on both
sides. The Báb himself was imprisoned from 1846 until 1850
and eventually publicly executed. In August 1852, two
deranged Bábís attempted to kill the Shah in revenge for the
execution of the Báb. This resulted in an extensive pogrom
during which more than 20,000 Bábís – among them 400 Shí’i

80   Affolter

mullas who had embraced the Bábí teachings – lost their
lives (Phelps, 1912; Browne, 1918; Nabil Zarandi, 1932). A
European envoy present in Teheran at that time has
recounted as follows:

> But follow me, my friend, you who lay claim to
> a heart and European ethics, follow me to the
> unhappy ones who, with gouged‐out eyes,
> must eat, on the scene of dead, without sauce,
> their own amputated ears; or whose teeth are
> torn out with inhuman violence, by the hand of
> the executioner; or whose bare skulls are sim‐
> ply crushed by blows from a hammer, or
> where the bazaar is illuminated with unhappy
> victims, because on right and left the people
> dig deep holes into their breasts and shoulders
> and insert burning wicks in wounds. I saw
> some dragged in chains through the bazaar,
> preceded by a military band, in whom these
> wicks had burned so deep that now the fat
> flickered convulsively in the wound like a
> newly extinguished lamp. Not seldom it hap‐
> pens that the unwearying ingenuity of the
> Orientals leads to fresh tortures. They will skin
> the soles of the Bábís feet, soak the wounds in
> boiling oil, shoe the foot like the hoof of a
> horse, and compel the victim to run…. I saw
> corpses torn by nearly 15 bullets. The more
fortunate suffered strangulation, stoning or

> suffocation: they were bound before the
> muzzle of a mortar, cut down with swords or
> killed with dagger thrusts, or blows from
> hammers and sticks. (Goumoens, in Browne,
> 1918, pp. 267‐271)

By 1863, Mirzá Husayn Alí – who had adapted the
name Bahá’u’lláh – emerged as the new leader of the Bábí
movement, recognized by the majority of its members. One
of the few heads who had survived the pogrom of 1852, he
was consequently banished to Iraq, later to Adrianople in
Turkey and finally to the prison city of Acre in what was
then part of the Ottoman empire and belongs today to
Northern Israel. Bahá’u’lláh was successful in reuniting and
encouraging the scattered Bábí community and eventually
established his own faith community, the Bahá’í Faith.

Bahá’u’lláh’s writings deal with a variety of themes
that challenge long‐cherished doctrines of Shí’i‐Islam. In
addition to making the ‘heretic’ claim of being a ‘Manifesta‐
tion of God,’ he suggested that school curricula should
include ‘Western Sciences,’ that the nation states (Muslim
and non‐Muslim) should establish a world federal govern‐
ment, and that men and women were equal. Bahá’u’lláh also
wrote that in this time and age, priests were no longer neces‐
sary for religious guidance. Humanity, he argued, had
reached an age of maturity where it was incumbent upon
every individual to search for God and truth independently.

These principles did not only call into question the
need for priesthood, but also the entire Shí’i ecclesiastical

82   Affolter

structure and the vast system of endowments, benefices and
fees that sustained it (Martin, 1984). No surprise then that in
the following decades until the overthrow of the Qájár
dynasty in 1925 it was the mullas who instigated attacks
against the Bahá’ís in cities or villages where the clerical
establishment was particularly influential. Some of these
outbreaks were recorded by missionaries who happened to
be at the site of massacres, such as the one in the City of
Yazd in 1903, where more than 100 Bahá’ís were killed
(Nash, 1982). The establishment of the constitution of 1906
provided the legal justification for treating Bahá’ís as
outcasts and to deny them any form of recognition, with the
result that they were legally ”non‐persons” in Persian public
life (Martin, 1984, pp. 13‐14).

Social and political tensions continued to fuel attacks
against Bahá’ís prior to the Iranian Revolution, the most
notable taking place in 1955 in Teheran when mullas and
army officials joined hands in destroying the Bahá’í National
Headquarters, and the government ordered the suppression
of all Bahá’í activities. As a result, Bahá’í holy places were
occupied and ransacked, homes and farms looted and
burned, Bahá’í cemeteries desecrated; adults were beaten,
young women abducted and forced to marry Muslims, chil‐
dren expelled from schools and many dismissed from their
employment (Momen, 1981, p. viii). The situation advanced
to a point where the complete suppression of the Bahá’í
community could have become a matter of fact, had not the
United Nations under Dag Hammarskjöld and the U.S. State

Department intervened on behalf of the Iranian Bahá’ís
(Martin, 1984).

In the remaining years prior to the Iranian revolution,
the Shah’s secret service agency SAVAK and government
agents sought to deflect the fury of reactionary Muslims
against the Shah by provoking anti‐Bahá’í hysteria. SAVAK
instructed its regional directors to cooperate with the Society
for Islamic Teaching in systematically suppressing the
Bahá’ís, while warning that such activities must not provoke
public disturbance (Mujtahid, cited in Martin, 1984, p. 33).

Already prior to his return to Iran, Ayatollah
Khomeini had expressed his view of Bahá’ís as traitors,
Zionists, economic plunderers and enemies of Islam
(Abrahamian, 1993, p. 48). In an interview to Professor James
Cockroft of Rutgers University in January 1979 he made it
clear that Bahá’ís were not going to be tolerated as a reli‐
gious minority:

> Question: Will there be either religious or
> political freedom for the Bahá’ís under an
> Islamic government?
> Answer: They are a political faction; they are
> harmful. They will not be accepted.
> Question: How about their freedom of religion
> – religious practice?

Answer: No. (Cockroft, 1979, p. 20)

Bahá’í persecutions since the inception of the Islamic

Republic of Iran

Four major strategies have characterized the persecu‐
tion of the Bahá’ís in Iran: attacks on the leadership, eco‐
nomic persecution, social isolation, and cultural cleansing.

Attacks on leadership

Since 1978, over 200 Bahá’ís were executed, disap‐
peared and are presumed dead, or were killed in mob
violence. Initially, members of the National Spiritual
Assembly of Iran as well as different local spiritual assem‐
blies either disappeared or were publicly executed, or shot
during Bahá’í gatherings. Of the Bahá’ís executed in Iran
since 1978, more than 50% have been members of Bahá’í
administrative bodies (Bahá’í International Community,
1999). In addition, popular Bahá’ís were assassinated. In
remote villages, mob lynchings, stoning, and deaths
involving torture have been reported. One of the most
dramatic executions occurred in June 1983, when ten Bahá’í
women – including two teen‐aged girls – were hanged for
having taught Bahá’í classes, for being members of Bahá’í
youth committees, for being unmarried, for allegedly being
supporters of Zionism, or for refusing to recant their faith
(Roohizadegan, 1993). Prominent Bahá’ís were also tortured
in order to obtain videotaped confessions that the Bahá’í
Faith is a network of espionage, or to pay allegiance to Shí’i
Islam and disassociate themselves in writing from the

‘Zionist Bahá’í Association’. These statements were to be
printed in public newspapers (Abrahamian, 1999).

Economic persecution

Bahá’í private property such as stores or agricultural
production sites were destroyed or expropriated. Bahá’í
children were prohibited from receiving education at the
university level. Several Bahá’ís who had occupied civil jobs
such as doctors or nurses in public hospitals had to leave. In
some cases, pension rights were suspended. Several students
and some government employees were told to repay their
grants or their salaries. Those who were unable to do so
were imprisoned.

The financial strangulation of the Iranian Bahá’ís has
resulted in losing access to quality medical services, and
frequently also the cheaper and lower‐quality care of the
state hospitals and clinics. With the suspension of their
government jobs, and private companies yielding to the
pressure of not employing Bahá’ís, Bahá’ís today are effec‐
tively without health coverage. Bahá’í doctors’ licenses have
been revoked and even though some of them continue
private practice, they are unable to prescribe clinical treat‐
ment since they are not shareholders of the hospitals. Bahá’ís
are denied treatment because they are Bahá’ís (Stockman,
1999).

Social isolation

Since the early 1990s, there have been increased efforts
to suffocate the Iranian Bahá’ís through more ‘silent’ means.
Most noteworthy is a confidential circular (see Appendix A for
a reprint) issued by the Supreme Revolutionary Cultural
Council and signed by President Khamenei in early 1991,
which – although appearing to grant a measure of protection
to Bahá’ís through certain provisions – actually organized the
methods of oppression used to debilitate the Bahá’ís. 2 The
memorandum contains specific recommendations on how to
block the development and the progress of the Bahá’í
Community not only inside but also outside of Iran, while
avoiding the most excessive types of persecutions.

The proposed strategies have taken their mental and
emotional tolls in the Iranian Bahá’í Community. The denial of
the right to access higher education, or the dismissal of a
student in the last stages of one’s studies, effectively contrib‐
utes to psychological anguish of members of an oppressed
group. Young women are particularly affected by such poli‐
cies. Whereas in Iran men traditionally enjoy at least relative
freedom of movement and social interaction, Bahá’í women’s
possibilities of leisure and relief are anyways severely
restricted. By prohibiting access to higher education, a last
chance for developing one’s potential and for pursuing per‐

2The existence of this so‐called Golpaygani Memorandum was brought
to the attention of the public in a report by the then UN Human Rights
Commissioner Mr. Galindo Pohl (E/CM4/1993/41, 28 January 1993).

sonal goals was effectively blocked (Geula, Smith‐Geula and
Woodall, 1999). 3

Another strategy capable of ‘dispiriting’ members of
an oppressed community has been to deny Bahá’ís the abil‐
ity to bury their dead in decent and hygienic burial grounds.
After the government had also seized Bahá’í cemeteries,
Bahá’ís were left without space for burying their dead (in
Iran, burial grounds are segregated by religion). For a period
of time, Bahá’ís were forced to bury their dead in small
gardens in their backyards. In one case, a dead child had to
be buried beneath the floor tiles of a Bahá’í family’s apart‐
ment. In recent years, local governments have designated
burial grounds for the Bahá’ís, but these grounds are usually
outside of the city, often in arid areas where water is
unavailable (Geula, Smith‐Geula and Woodall, 1999).

3Between September 29 and October 3, 1998, a decentralized home‐
based distance university model called Bahá’í Institute of Higher
Education (BIHE) – which Iranian Bahá’ís had developed over the years,
and which offered academic programs to Bahá’í youth that had been
excluded from access to public universities – was raided and closed by
the Iranian authorities throughout Iran (Bollag, 1998; Bronner, 1998).
More than 36 faculty members were arrested. Most of those arrested
were released soon afterwards, but four were given prison sentences
ranging from three to ten years. The arrests were carried out by officers
of the Iranian Government’s intelligence agency, the Ministry of
Information, and also involved the seizure of textbooks, scientific papers,
and documentary records. Those arrested were asked to sign a
document declaring that BIHE had ceased to exist as of September 29,
and that they would no longer cooperate with it. All of the detainees
refused to sign such a declaration.

Cultural cleansing

The Iranian Government also appears to be deter‐
mined to rid Iran of the Bahá’í Community by obliterating
its memory – through the desecration or destruction of
Bahá’í Holy Sites (often historical landmarks of Iran’s
cultural‐architectural heritage). In 1979, the house of Báb,
one of the most sacred sites in the Bahá’í World, was demol‐
ished. The house of Bahá’u’lláh, where the Founder of the
Bahá’í Faith spent his childhood, was demolished soon after
the revolution and the site offered for sale to the public. In
1993, more than 15,000 graves were bulldozed in a well‐kept
Bahá’í cemetery of Tehran on the pretext of constructing a
municipal center. In April 2004, the gravesite of an early
Apostle of the Faith, the resting place of Mulla Muhammad‐
Ali Barfurushi, known as Quddus, was destroyed in Babol.
In June 2004, the house of Mirzá Abbas Nuri (Bahá’u’lláh’s
father, an eminent provincial governor and one of Iran’s
outstanding calligraphers) was destroyed ostensibly for the
purpose of creating an Islamic cemetery (Bahá’í World News
Service, 2004).

Iran’s response to the allegations of Bahá’í persecution

In response to inquiries from the international com‐
munity, Iran has responded with a variety of statements that
argue that Bahá’ís are not being persecuted on religious
grounds, but for involvement in criminal activities. In other
words, Iran claims that only Bahá’ís with criminal records

have been prosecuted in accordance with national jurisdic‐
tional laws. In statements circulated at the United Nations
Headquarters in New York, the Permanent Mission of the
Islamic Republic of Iran to the United Nations (1982), as well
as Iranian embassies in Canada and elsewhere (Nashr‐i‐
Farhang‐i‐Inqilab‐i‐Islami, 1983), repeatedly claimed that
Bahá’ís were enemies of the state, of the Islamic Revolution,
spies employed by imperialist governments of the West,
supporters of the Shah of Iran, or collaborators of SAVAK.

Analysis of psychological and social circumstances

fueling Bahá’í persecutions in Iran

Staub (1989, pp. 21‐22) suggests that it takes a variety
of factors to create a climate conducive to the emergence of
group violence and genocide. Active motivation to harm a
subgroup of society arises and intensifies in the course of a
continuous decline of inhibitions against harming and
killing people, achieved partly by excluding people from
one’s own ‘moral universe’ (Staub, 1989, p. 33). When
coupled with difficult life conditions and a political culture
of authoritarianism, the planning and organization of acts of
mass violence becomes a real possibility.

Harff, Gurr and Unger (1999) have concluded that
genocide and politicide occur frequently after a previous
state failure, usually an ethnic or revolutionary war, some‐
times an abrupt regime transition. They suggest that

> Episodes are most likely (1) after high‐magni‐
> tude political upheavals in (2) autocratic
> regimes whose leaders either are (3) ethnically
> non‐representative of the larger population or
> (4) adherents of exclusionary ideologies. (5) A
> contributing societal factor is low religious
> diversity. (6) A strongly inhibiting interna‐
> tional factor is a high degree of economic inter‐
> connectedness. (p. 1)

As the following analysis illustrates, most of the
above mentioned components – except the argument of
economic interconnectedness – can be applied to analyze
and explain the Islamic Government of Iran’s politics of
aggression against the Bahá’ís in 20th century Iran.

Socio‐cultural unease and political tensions

Already during the 19th century, Persia had become
increasingly subject to Western economic penetration and
domination (Amanat, 1989). In the 20th century, the Pahlavi
Shahs’ ambitious modernization and secularization pro‐
grams were perceived as humiliating and offensive because
they replaced Iranian cultural heritage with inputs from the
West:

> People were torn from ancestral ways, the gap
> between rich and the poor grew, corruption
was rampant and well known, and the secret

> police, with its arbitrary arrests and use of
> torture, turned Iranians of all levels against the
> regime. The presence and influence of
> foreigners provided major further aggravation.

(Keddie, 1988, p. 305)

Feeling the need for more efficacy, control and power,
different strata of Iranian society sought to counteract the
generally perceived process of social disorganization. While
the Pahlavis pushed for the resurrection of a pre‐Arab
Persian Empire, rural peasants who had migrated to the
cities became attracted to subproletarian ideologies and
urban‐based rebellions against the dynasty. Secularized
liberals and radicals wanted to bring Western values and
philosophy into Iran while ‘ulamás and bazaaris viewed the
replacement of the Shah and his foreign supporters with a
new Islamic social order as key to Iranian liberation.

Modernization, alienation and the need for an ideology of hope

Shí’i mullas had always believed they were the lawful
successors of the legacy of Prophet Muhammad who is
viewed by Muslims as the last of God’s messengers to have
addressed humanity prior to the Day of Judgment at the end
of time. The clerical establishment was likened to the
“mantle of the prophet” (Mottaheddeh, 1985) with privileges
as well as the charge to guide society on the straight path.
For the illiterate follower, a mulla provided the connection
with the divine. Yet, the growing influence of the West and

the difficult life conditions of the 20th century called into
question the positive legitimacy and power of the religious
culture. Shí’i clergy responded to these threats by height‐
ened zealotry to their religious mission.

> Because people define themselves to a signifi‐
> cant degree by their membership in a group,
> for most people a positive view of their group
> is essential to individual self‐esteem – espe‐
> cially in difficult times. The need to protect and
> improve societal self‐concept or to find a new
group to identify with will be powerful….

People are energized by a sense of per‐
> sonal value and significance, connection to
> other people, the feeling of mutual support,
> and a view of the world that generates hope.
> However, when these motivations are very
> intense and fulfilled in certain ways, they
> become likely the origin of destruction. (Staub,
> 1989, p. 16)

It is of particular interest to see how the social
tensions described earlier shaped the social context of
Ayatollah Khomeini’s upbringing (Algar, 1988). Khomeini’s
father, himself a religious leader, was murdered as a result
of his struggle against oppressive landlords when Khomeini
was only 5 months old. As a child, Khomeini witnessed the
tyrannical and arbitrary rule of both governors and land‐
lords. In 1918 he lost both his mother and aunt, finding

himself totally orphaned at the age of 16. A little bit later,
Khomeini began to associate himself with religious institu‐
tions and the ʹulamá leadership and educational culture. He
eventually became a teacher and started to write. As to
political activism, Khomeini believed in spiritual preparation
for external revolutions:

> Once a man has become a true human being by
> means of spiritual discipline, he will be the
> most active of men. He will till the land, but he
> will till it for God’s sake. He will also wage
> war, for all the wars waged against unbelievers
> and oppressors were waged by men absorbed
> in the contemplation of the divine unity and
> engaged in the constant invocation of God and
> the recitation of prayer. (Khomeini, cited in
> Algar, 1988, p. 271)

Khomeini’s ideas responded directly to the needs and
the emotional landscape of some segments of Iranian
society. He attracted not only mullas and religious judges,
but also all those who had reasons to perceive themselves as
‘oppressed’ and in need of a new ideology of healing.

Low religious diversity

In a country with already low religious diversity
(Metz, 1989), a post‐Islamic religion such as the Bahá’í faith
(while in itself a tool for making sense of a society in change)

was perceived not only as a contradiction of Islamic logic; it
also was perceived as a threat to the legitimacy of
Khomeinism. It went counter to the interests and emotional
needs of the Iranian mullas and their followers. Hence,
Bahá’ís were declared heretics, deviants and destructive
ideologists who ought to be exterminated. Doing so did not
only help to get rid of a perceived threat; in addition, it also
strengthened and consolidated ‘ties of closeness’ within the
Shí’i faith community.

Criticisms of the Shah’s modernization programs
provided the Mullas with the political and socio‐cultural
justification to overthrow the Pahlavi regime. Mullas were
particularly wary of the Shah’s desire to lead Iran back to
pre‐Arab glory by means of a Western modernization
program (Arndt, 1989). Although the Shah courted the
clergy to maintain the political stability of the country, the
clerical establishment and those educated by the mullas felt
alienated and excluded.

Exclusive ideologies

Politically, the Pahlavi administration had always
been an ideologically exclusionary organization. The
purpose of SAVAK or the Resurgence Party was consolida‐
tion of power. As to the government that replaced the
Pahlavi Dynasty, Milani (1997) argues that the Islamic revo‐
lution has incorporated, on the one hand, a larger segment of
the population into the political process than had been the
case under Mohammed Reza Shah. Yet, freedom is defined

as the permission to do whatever does not violate Islamic
law. Therefore, while embracing fractional rivalry, it rejects
the political participation of opponents (Milani, 1997, p. 78).

While seeking to create a system free of traditional
dynasties and capable of enhancing the spiritual and socio‐
economic liberation of the oppressed, the current Iranian
government nonetheless continues to propagate a political
culture of authoritarianism. This time, however, it is based
on an assertion of divine legitimacy for an Iranian Shí’i
population socialized into subjugation to authority, commu‐
nal identity, and acceptance of the clergy’s claim of the
divine right to lead. In this context, scapegoating anything
that is perceived as a threat to the clergy’s legitimacy
becomes a political imperative.

Economic interconnectedness

Although the Shah’s modernization programs
resulted in increased economic exchange between Iran and
the West, only a small business elite benefited from such
relationships. Most left Iran soon after the revolution had
begun, whereas members of the less‐educated working and
impoverished classes (the main supporters of the revolu‐
tionary agenda) remained in the country. Economic inter‐
connectedness, then, had obviously not advanced to a point
where an internationalization of Iranian economics could
have prevented attempts to carry out actions of ideological
genocide. At the same time, however, it is interesting to note
that it is predominantly economic interests that continue to

drive efforts of the Iranian government to polish up its
human rights image.

Education for preventing mass violence against minority groups

The systematic persecution of the Bahá’ís may have
been prevented if Iran’s population had been better
informed about the Bahá’í teachings and the community of
Iranians confessing to them. And, vice versa, persecutions
might have been more severe if there hadn’t been Iranians
who despite all propaganda protected Bahá’ís – because they
knew better.

This hypothesis that a lack of accessible information
about the social and cultural tenets of minority groups may
facilitate perpetrators’ harmdoing against less‐known
‘outgroups’ – while not addressed in Staub’s (1989) or Harff,
Gurr and Unger’s (1999) frameworks – does appear to be of
relevance when analyzing the circumstances that facilitated
acts of violence against the Iranian Bahá’ís. In order to
prevent politicide, it is necessary to strengthen the heteroge‐
neity of national societies by incorporating faith concepts
and values of minority cultures into academic curricula and
discussions. Such a policy eventually must lead to a point
where the existence of minorities and their right of a
different voice can no longer be denied or minimized. As
efforts to induce prejudice require a sophisticated rationale,
a well‐informed audience is less likely persuaded that a
minority should be excluded from the ‘moral universe’ of
society.

In Iran, mass violence against Bahá’ís did not only
result from intrinsic emotional bewilderment of illiterate
Iranians, but also due to the fact that Iranians learned about
the Bahá’í Faith predominantly through the lens of its tradi‐
tional ‘ulamá leadership:

> For the past century a curtain of silence has
> surrounded the subject. The Bahá’í community
> has at all times been denied the use of the
> usual means of communication with the gen‐
> eral public: radio, television, newspapers,
> films, free distribution of literature, or public
> lectures. The academic community in Iran has
> entirely ignored the existence of the faith
> founded there; the subject is not treated in uni‐
> versity courses or textbooks. Indeed, census
> figures which provided statistics on all of the
> other religious and ethnic minorities in Iran
> were omitted for the Bahá’í community, the
> largest religious minority of all. Coupled with
> this, the public mind has been subjected, for
> decades, to abusive propaganda from Shí’i
> Muslim clergy, in which the role of the Bahá’í
> community in Iran, its size, its beliefs, and its
> objectives have been misrepresented. (Martin,
> 1984, p. 23)

Efforts undertaken for preventing ideological genocide

Despite 25 years of silent persecution, the Iranian
Bahá’í community remains the largest religious minority in
Iran. The question that arises is why the Iranian authorities
were so unsuccessful in suffocating and eradicating the
Iranian Bahá’ís. There are a number of factors that may have
helped Iranian Bahá’ís to persevere. Their study may be
useful for developing a theory on how to cope with and
survive attempts of ideological genocide.

Individual perseverance and community mobilization

First, it was the refusal of the Iranian Bahá’ís to recant
their faith – despite promises of the Iranian authorities to
reinstall pensions, return properties and halt psychological
mistreatment of family members – that stalled an escalation
of repressive maneuvers on the part of the government.
Until 1992, less than 100 Bahá’ís had recanted their faith.
Despite severe social and economic repression, Bahá’ís
managed to mobilize their internal resources. Bahá’í entre‐
preneurs, despite removal of licenses and other repercus‐
sions, continued to run businesses, where Bahá’ís bought
and were being employed. Doctors who had lost their
licenses continued to practice privately and Bahá’ís sought
treatment from Bahá’í medical experts. After having been
barred from accessing universities, Bahá’ís established their
own alternative system of higher education, where Bahá’í
youth could pursue academic studies under the mentorship

of marginalized Bahá’í professionals (Stockman, 1999). These
efforts, as well as Bahá’í spiritual attitudes towards persecu‐
tion and suffering helped Bahá’ís to get by physically,
mentally, and emotionally as well as spiritually (Stockman,
1999; Ghadirian, 1994).

Positive bystandership

Without the positive bystandership of Iranian
Muslims who protected as well as helped and supported
Bahá’ís, the Iranian Bahá’í community would have suffered
more deeply. Tavakoli‐Targhi (1999) cites examples of even
‘ulamás risking their lives by shielding Bahá’í homes against
the enraged mob, thereby demonstrating a new interpreta‐
tion of Shí’i ethos. These ties of friendship were often rooted
in the fact that Iranian Bahá’ís are also family members,
neighbors, business partners, employers and employees, and
overall well integrated in Iranian society. It is difficult for
family members, business partners and neighbors to cut ties
of friendship that have been woven during years and found
to be rewarding in the past.

International advocacy

The most important outside influence that helped to
deter mass persecutions were the interventions and demon‐
strations of sympathy of the international community. Since
the inception of the Iranian revolution in 1979, the Inter‐
national Bahá’í Community has engaged in a broad set of

efforts to bring the case of the Iranian Bahá’ís to the attention
of the United Nations, as well as national and local govern‐
ment representatives, human rights groups, the media and
the general public. Bigelow (1992) believes that the
outpouring of sympathy of the international community
regarding the persecution of the Bahá’ís in Iran has been one
of the key factors that restrained the Iranian government
from engaging in a pogrom on a much larger scale.

On the international level, the United Nations General
Assembly and the Commission on Human Rights called for
the emancipation of the Iranian Bahá’í Community. That the
perspective of the General Assembly matters to the Iranian
government is demonstrated by the fact that the UN repre‐
sentative of the Iranian government has made several
attempts between 1982 and 1984 to convince the UN diplo‐
matic community that the Bahá’í Faith is a politicized
organization with a record of criminal activism against the
Iranian government. In 1985, Iran became the fourth country
ever in the history of the United Nations to be placed on the
agenda of the General Assembly because of the severity and
the extent of its human rights violations record (Cooper,
1985).

In addition to the United Nations, the Council of
Europe and the European Parliament issued numerous
resolutions. Also, individual heads of state publicly
condemned the Iranian government’s discrimination of the
Bahá’ís in Iran. In the United States, congressional hearings
about the human rights situation of Iranian Bahá’ís, as well
as House and Senate Debates, took place in 1982, 1984, 1988,

1990, 1992, 1994, 1996 and 2000. The current pending
resolution on the House side is H. Con. Res. 319, and on the
Senate side S. Con. Res. 78.

In response, the Iranian government – through its
respective embassies – sought to demonstrate to the public
that Bahá’ís are being reprimanded not for practicing their
religion, but due to criminal offenses. Iran obviously did not
wish to be indicted on charges of human rights violations. 4

The hypothesis that interlocking global realities of
economic and political relationships can prevent
perpetrators from carrying out acts of violence against other
groups (Staub, 1989; Harff, Gurr and Unger, 1999) becomes
particularly credible when analyzing the events that took
place during a cabinet meeting in Iran in 1955. At this
meeting, the government spokesman and the clergy pressed
for a declaration that would have made the Bahá’í faith
illegal. The meeting took place shortly after the Iranian
government had been called by the United Nations and the
United States Department of State to call a halt on attacks on
Iranian Bahá’ís and Bahá’í property. As Akhavi (in Martin,

\[4\] In 2002, the United Nations Commission on Human Rights opted – for the first
time in 18 years – not to pass a resolution expressing concern about human
rights in Iran, and to instead engage Iran into a ‘dialogue’ on human rights. Yet,
in the estimation of Bahá’í representatives, the situation of the Iranian Bahá’ís
subsequently deteriorated, “… with an increase in short term arrests and
detentions, the confiscation of more properties, and continued harassment of
Bahá’í teachers and students” (Dugal, in Bahá’í World News Service, 2003, p.
1).

On 21 November 2003, the Third Committee of the United Nations
General Assembly approved a new resolution that expresses serious concern
over continuing violations of human rights in Iran, and continuing
discrimination against Bahá’ís and other religious minorities.

1984) illustrates, the intervention of the United Nations
forced government officials to refrain from passing an
already agreed‐upon law proposed by the clergy to make the
Bahá’í Faith illegal:

> The clergy pressed for a formal piece of legis‐
> lation which would declare the Bahá’í Faith
> illegal, would make service to the faith a
> criminal offense, and would establish appro‐
> priate penalties: prison terms for anyone guilty
> of Bahá’í membership, the sequestration of all
> Bahá’í properties and the disbursement of the
> proceeds for the use of Islamic propaganda
> agencies, the discharge of all Bahá’ís from
> public service, and the prohibition of any form
> of Bahá’í religious activity. The clergy’s
> spokesmen in the Majlis found themselves
> facing an embarrassed cabinet which, while
> assuring them that every means would be
> taken “within the law” to protect Islam, stub‐
> bornly refused to introduce the legislation
> which would have accomplished the ‘ulamásʹ
> objectives. Nor would the government even
> pronounce its official attitude towards the
> Bahá’í Faith. The regime was reduced to
> engaging in a debate in the Majlis on the
> subject of the Bahá’í community, in which the
government apologists appear to have been

> forbidden to mention the word Bahá’í. (Martin,
> 1984, p. 22‐23)

The media as a tool to denounce human rights violations

In the United States, the American Bahá’í Community
eventually decided to hire a public relations firm in order to
launch a campaign for raising awareness about the situation
of the Bahá’ís in Iran, and for winning the attention of indi‐
viduals and offices with a reputation in human rights
activities. Once Bahá’ís were invited to testify at hearings on
religious persecution, the same public relations company
assisted the Bahá’ís in the planning of presentation strategies
to be used during the hearings, and in the analysis of the
resolutions that were drafted in order to determine further
actions (Bigelow, 1992).

With the encouragement of the Bahá’í International
Community Offices at the United Nations in New York and
Geneva, Bahá’í communities in many different parts of the
world began to forward information about the Bahá’í
persecution in Iran to local newspapers. In the United States
alone, 1700 local Bahá’í Assemblies began write to repre‐
sentatives at Congress, thereby forming a grassroots
constituency of American Bahá’ís (Bigelow, 1992, pp. 193‐
194). Bahá’í college clubs were advised to inform university
chancellors and academic department heads about the
closing and raiding of the Bahá’í Institute of Higher
Learning (BIHE) in August 1998 (Bronner, 1998). University
authorities wrote letters of protest, thereby reminding the

Iranian authorities that the world was aware of the Bahá’í
situation in Iran (Stockman, 1999). In Canada, North
American Bahá’í artists as well as Iranian Bahá’í refugees
recreated the story of Mona Mahmúdnizhád, the teenage girl
who was hanged in Shiraz in 1983, by producing a music
video (Charters, Frame, Lenz and Akhavan, 1984). The video
was later distributed in Canadian pubs, youth clubs and
discotheques and proved to be remarkably effective in
bringing the human rights situation in Iran to the attention
of the public.

Conclusion

Bahá’ís in Iran share a fate similar to that of European
Jews who had been demonized by Christians as enemies of
God; Argentinean communists who had been devalued by
the military; or urban Cambodian intellectuals who had been
accused of impeding the liberation of the Cambodian prole‐
tariat. Although the only non‐Muslim religious community
in the world that actually bears witness to the authenticity of
the Religion of Islam, Bahá’ís are viewed as enemies of
Islam, and as ideological heretics who challenge the
fulfillment of a cherished Shí’i religious vision.

The Iranian Bahá’ís also illustrate how a community,
its social support networks, as well as the international
human rights machinery can work together to prevent
perpetrators from engaging in ideological genocide.

Today, Bahá’ís born in 1978 have become adults
without an experience of what it means to live a life free of

accusations of being enemies of the Iranian government and
of Islam. Iranian Bahá’ís continue to live in the fear that
recent executions, killings, and other forms of persecution
may intensify again at any time. Unless the Iranian leader‐
ship seeks to view the Bahá’í community as a genuinely
Iranian intellectual and religious movement (Tavakoli‐
Targhi, 1999, p. 1) that has actually evolved in the context of
Iranian culture and is now established on a global scale, not
much will change for the Iranian Bahá’ís. Ideological geno‐
cide continues to loom on the horizon, and it will take
continued international efforts to persuade Iranian
authorities to prevent further violence against the Bahá’ís of
Iran.

Greetings!

After greetings with reference to the letter #1/783 dated
10/10/69 [31 December 1990], concerning the instructions of

the Esteemed Leader which had been conveyed to the
Respected President regarding the Baha’i question, we
inform you that, since the respected President and the Head
of the Supreme Revolutionary Cultural Council had referred
this question to this Council for consideration and study, it
was placed on the Council’s agenda of session #128 on
16/11/69 [5 February 1991] and session #119 of 2/11/69 [22
January 1991]. In addition to the above, and further to the
[results of the] discussion held in this regard in session #112
of 2/5/66 [24 July 1987] presided over the Esteemed Leader
(head and member of the Supreme Council), the recent
views and directives given by the Esteemed Leader
regarding the Baha’i question were conveyed to the Supreme
Council. In consideration with the contents of the
Constitution of the Islamic Republic of Iran, as well as the
religious and civil laws and general policies of the country,
these matters were carefully studied and decisions
pronounced.

In arriving at the decisions and proposing reasonable
ways to counter the above question, due consideration was
given to the wishes of the Esteemed Leadership of the
Islamic Republic of Iran [Khamenei], namely, that “in this
regard a specific policy should be devised in such a way that
everyone will understand what should or should not be
done”. Consequently, the following proposals and
recommendations resulted from these discussions.

The respected President of the Islamic Republic of Iran, as
well as the Head of the Supreme Revolutionary Cultural
Council, while approving these recommendations,

instructed us to convey them to the Esteemed Leader
[Khamenei] so that appropriate action may be taken
according to his guidance.
SUMMARY OF THE RESULTS OF THE DISCUSSIONS
AND RECOMMENDATION

> admission process or during the course of their studies,
> once it becomes known that they are Bahá’ís.
4\. Their political (espionage) activities must be dealt with

> according appropriate Government laws and policies,
> and their religious and propaganda activities should be
> answered by giving them religious and cultural
> responses, as well as propaganda.
5\. Propaganda institutions (such as the Islamic Propaganda

> Organization) must establish an independent section to
> counter the propaganda and religious activities of the
Bahá’ís.

6\. A plan must be devised to confront and destroy their

cultural roots outside the country.

C. Legal and social status
1\. Permit them a modest livelihood as is available to the

general population.
2\. To the extend that it does not encourage them to be

> Bahá’ís, it is permissible to provide them the means for
> ordinary living in accordance with the general rights
> given to every ordinary citizen such as ration booklets,
> passports, burial certificates, work permits, etc.
3\. Deny them employment if they identify themselves as

Bahá’ís.
4\. Deny them any position of influence, such as it is in the

educational sector, etc.

Wishing you divine confirmations,
