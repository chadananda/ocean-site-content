Preamb le

My sincere thanks go to the organisers of the Irfán Colloquium
for making it possible to cross the globe and join you on this
auspicious 10th anniversary of this initiative. A chill ran up my spine
when I first received the invitation. I hadn’t even come across the
word ‘colloquium’ before. I had to look it up. Its meaning was
revealing. The term colloquium means as much an informal
gathering for the exchange of views as it does an academic seminar
on a broad field of study. Such latitude definitely made me feel at
home.

But first a personal introduction. Who am I? A non-academic
venturing outside his field? Doubly insulting to all of you
distinguished listeners. A safe specialist talking to a non-specialist
audience on matters he knows nothing about? Hardly. A demolition
expert of simplistic either-ors with more respect for academic
complexity than the authority of the heart? Too brash and
immodest. The public intellectual seeking influence or the timid
seeker attempting at quality? Neither if the world continues to
remain disenchanted. The value of gatherings such as this lies not so
much in how well we clear suspicion from the intellectual mind but
how well we portray sincerity to the rational soul. How we find truth
is as important as how we tell it. The politics of Bahá’í scholarship
lies precisely in balancing accuracy with sincerity and this tends to
reduce conflict as undue emphasis on precision alone will always take
power away from one group or the other. In our zest to get to the
facts we must avoid being seduced by the siren song of our own
agenda and to be led into making the facts fit our pet theories rather
than fostering a framework which fits reality. Thomas Hobbes
(1588-1679) said if the fact that two and two makes four were to
become a matter of political relevance, there would be a faction to
deny it. It is precisely to avoid fractioning scholarship that wisdom,
spiritual perception and sincere language should be more than a mere
appendix to knowledge. These should be our permanent referees.
For a while knowledge and wisdom remained bitter opponents until

the staff of Hermes turned them into celebrated complements as
symbolized by the caduceus.

With less mythical flare, we propose the same here today. We
wish to see how we as a special emerging world community could
meet and overcome the two major modern obstacles to truth —
suspicion and skepticism. The fear of deception is real and doubt
universal. Should there be no objective truth or reality can any
human experiment last? If the greatness of man is a function of the
greatness of what he loves maybe it is to the heart first that we must
turn before examining the rules? Is there any philosophy that
simultaneously addresses the human being as a rational agent but
also as a package of passions and impulses? All these questions and
more were too compelling to be left unanswered.

The question ‘Who am I?’ has, however, been left unanswered
and remarks so far have responded more to the question ‘What must
we be?’ however coarsely addressed. In any case, to be respectful to
those here present I offer this line stolen from a distinguished Bahá’í
scholar of the recent past. “We are not so wise nor so good as we
should like to be; nor even so wise and good as we hope soon to
become. God Himself alone is a perfect teacher.”1

Intr oducti on

The paper today, short and unsystematic — the limits of what can
be said in a sixty-minute lecture show through — is not a
reintroduction to Bahá’í community. The title ‘Towards a Philosophy
of the Community of Mind’ should not be regarded as offensive in
implying to mean that we have strayed so far from the ideal that it is
necessary to provide the means to return to it. Nor is the
presentation intended to be homiletical: sermons are too moralistic
to be of value. But rather it is to be viewed as an exercise in tensions
— to comprehend the incomprehensible, to objectify what we cannot
know objectively. If the word community has been defined as ‘a
most elusive and vague term ... and without specific meaning’ and
‘essentially a mental construct’ (Dictionary of Sociology, Penguin
2000, page 64) then imagine the difficulty of applying sublime
concepts to a collection of people in a permanent state of becoming.
‘Community’ is becoming and ‘mind’ thinking. But thinking and
being are too remote from each other for us to see them as anything
else but two human states in eternal, fraternal conflict.2 Nevertheless
it is the coexistence of action and learning that modifies community
and its traditions and any systematic study centered on this exchange
can only be valuable. One final reminder. The word ‘philosophy’ in
the title is but a synonym, albeit a pompous one, for meditation and
does not represent any groundbreaking structural theory of social

Lights of ‘Irfán Book Six 71

change nor doctrine. 3 Nor is the title as a whole an attempt at self-
aggrandizement.

There are too many creating too many catchy terms and trade-
marks for these to be treated as anything but poor badges of
scholarship and slogans in themselves have always been too spurious
to be grounds for investigative reasoning quite apart from the fact
that labels have lost their simplistic charm.4 Given that no adequate
definition of community exists other than uninspiring minimalist
references to a collection of people with a sense of belonging or
with similar interests or restrictive definitions heavily dependent on
which group views what for what purposes (the urban planner will
define community in terms of boundaries, the politician in terms of
constituents, the anthropologist in terms of culture and so on), we
shall use the following text of the Universal House of Justice: “A
community is ... more than the sum of its membership; it is a
comprehensive unit of civilization composed of individuals, families
and institutions that are originators and encouragers of systems,
agencies and organizations working together with a common
purpose for the welfare of people both within and beyond its own
borders; it is a composition of diverse, interacting participants that
are achieving unity in an unremitting quest for spiritual and social
progress.” (Ridvan Message 1996). The concept of community here is
dynamic (a purposive functional unit) and theory related — building
unity and effective development in areas of permanent concern of
mankind (welfare in the wider context of progress and prosperity).

The text goes on to show how recurring patterns of Bahá’í
community life manifest “the collective expression of the virtues of
the individual members.... .in the unity and fellowship of the
community and the dynamism of its activity and growth.... It implies
a collective will and sense of purpose.” (idem) The concept of will
and purpose are vital to our understanding of the notion
‘community of mind’. The noted German sociologist Ferdinand
Toennies (1855-1936) identifies two forms of human will: (1) the
essential will defined as ‘the underlying, organic, or instinctive
driving force’ in which community membership is self-fulfilling, and
(2) arbitrary will which is deliberative, purposive, and future (goal)
oriented, often associated with the wider society and State. Both
types of wills, according to Toennies, can be found in two basic
types of social groups — the community (Gemeinschaft) and society
(Gesellschaft).

Com munity of Mind

The community of mind, a concept which Toennies also
originates, is the ideal community, a format kinship represented by

friendship (Community Society, 42).5 According to Tönnies, a
community based on similar interests (Gemeinschaft) has as its basis
a real community and the only real form of life.6 He famously
noted, “In community people remain essentially united in spite of all
separating factors, whereas in society they are essentially separated in
spite of all uniting factors.” Gemeinschaft, a “community of mind
and feeling” results from likeness and from shared life-experience.
In simple terms, it implies human relationships that are intimate and
enduring, understanding each member to be a unique human being,
a sacred soul, with dignity. Social bonds in such situations are
characterised by sentiment, commitment and depth. Emphasis in
Gemeinschaft was on kinship, locality and mind (sentiment). He
argued that all three of these had been seriously disrupted in the
transition to Gesellschaft. This social group is suggestive of the
impersonal, instrumental and largely contractual relationships that
are taken to characterise life in modern society. It is based on
rationality rather than sentiment. These concepts serve as a useful
device for giving expression to a dominant thought that a
community-based social order is being destroyed by processes of
industrialisation and urbanization and that, as a result, values were
being undermined, the basis of solidarity within the society was
being changed and an older closeness was being lost.

Bahá’í communites may be viewed today as similarly undergoing
profound change as per the Toennies’ dichotomy, shifting from a
community sustained by spirit to a society sustained by instrument. A
new ‘culture of growth’ is emerging which some view as alienating
(but not as discouraging) as the process of urbanization is to family
and neighborhood. Just as Toennies feared that the evolution from
community to city would create an impersonal society destructive to
common understanding and time-honoured customs so too many see
the new culture of growth (to be defined shortly) as the evolution of
one type of Bahá’í community to another, one less nourishing and
impersonal, causing fears not dissimilar to the German sociologist,
but infinitely less darksome: “The entire culture’ he says, ‘ has been
transformed into a civilization of state and Gesellschaft, and this
transformation means the doom of culture itself if none of its
scattered seeds remain alive and again bring forth the essence and
idea of Gemeinschaft, thus secretly fostering a new culture amidst
the decaying one.” To this we can match a recent sentiment of
despair from a British Bahá’í:

> I have seen personally diverse manifestations of such
> discouragement. I see them in desperate exhortations to
> teach the Faith in which the sense of urgency is
> accompanied by an element of despondency and
resentment. I see them in strong, faithful Bahá’ís who

Lights of ‘Irfán Book Six 73

> choose to become inactive in the community on account of
> their perception of dysfunctionality.7
Metánoia — th e N ew Insight

The problem of transition in Bahá’í community is heightened by
the fact that whereas Toennies contrasts between a social order
which rests on harmony (consensus of wills) and is developed and
ennobled by religion, and another which rests on convention and
agreement, safeguarded by political legislation, in the Bahá’í
community there is a fusion of the two forms of social groups.
Order and bonding are consecrated by a divine charter protected by
divinely established social structure and laws. It is inevitable then
that perplexity mounts when believers seek to acquaint themselves
with ‘the profound change in Bahá’í culture’ when the change itself
has been capitalized on through the formal agency of established
order, in this case the Four Year Plan of the House of Justice
launched in 1996 which may be viewed as a landmark enterprise in
initiating a new community consciousness on a single focus —
advancing the process of entry by troops. Where should allegiance
lie? In the divided loyalty which emerges we are pressed to choose
between the inner promptings of a free but dedicated spirit or the
outer exigencies of a benevolent but formal order? A good example
of the metaphysical debate over self and the polis outside of it is the
culture shock of the new methods of Bahá’í activity against the old
habits of the heart. “There are no shortcuts,” writes the Universal
House of Justice.

> Systematization ensures consistency of lines of action based
> on well-conceived plans. In a general sense, it implies an
> orderliness of approach in all that pertains to Bahá’í service
> ... While allowing for individual initiative and spontaneity,
> it suggests the need to be clear-headed, methodical,
> efficient,    constant,    balanced      and     harmonious.
> Systematization is a necessary mode of functioning...
> (Ridvan Message, 1998)
> Are not efficiency and systematization obvious tendencies of
religion’s secularization? Is there not a real danger of our religion
falling into the age-old dilemma of intellectualization and
disenchantment? Does there not exist a real possibility that our new
culture of growth is ceding religion’s mystery to the clarity and
control of bureaucracy? The testing ground for adopting the
necessary values and attitudes to establish true Bahá’í communities
lies in this: that while individuals receive their share from a common
center of belief and root their strength of faith from this common
center, the center itself displays both the conditions of Gesellschaft-
like civilization in which peace and order are maintained through

rules as much as conditions of Gemeinschaft family solidarity where
its members share a morally significant history, collectively striving
to realize ideals and aspirations governed by sentiments of trust,
cooperation and altruism. Can the religious ethic of brotherliness
sustain itself in the face of the increasing changes to its form?

The development of a ‘systematic’ image of community is not
anathema to religion (nor new).8 As Weber points out in ‘ Science as
Vocation’ (1919), such organization of the modern self does not
necessarily take power away from religion; it allows people to take a
corrective stance in response to the senselessness in the world. He
suggests that religions of redemption tend toward systematic,
comprehensive rationalizations of problems and their solutions, in
contrast to magical religions which are remedial in a non-systematic
way. The new culture of growth is developing a distinctive form of
collective enterprise without necessarily forfeiting our Faith’s
distinctive and vital function. But sustainable growth by building on
the necessary capacity at the levels of the individual, the institution,
and the community is a three-legged stool in need of balance. This
can be achieved commanding a new insight best described by the
Greek word metánoia, literally repentance (Woodhouse English-
Greek Dictionary, 696) but more generally used to mean to change
one’s mind as in respect for the new. Change is only meaningful if
we alter the mental model that shapes the way we think about
individuals, institutions, and community that shall benefit from
change.

Metanoia wrongly understood is a guilt ridden awareness of all
that is going wrong in our lives and society. Metanoia properly
understood is a push forward toward something better for us and
for our world. It is not change for change’s sake but positive change
with deep understanding of the implications. We see it in the first
syllable, “meta” in Greek meaning “with,” and “noia” meaning
understanding. Therefore if progress, process, and development are
inevitable in Bahá’í community and are to be accompanied by this
new insight, what value/attitude typology is there to adopt to
promote and foster a community that best expresses the essential
will while maintaining intact the unifying principles of the arbitrary
will?

Culture of Gr o wth

Before examining this issue it is important we look more closely
to the concept ‘culture of growth’ first mentioned in the January 9th,
2001, Message of the UHJ to the Continental Board of Counsellors.
The phrase “culture of growth” at face value seems redundant. The
right culture is a significant determinant of a community’s ability to

Lights of ‘Irfán Book Six 75

grow and prosper. Culture shapes our thoughts, feelings and action.
Imagine, for a moment, the negative impact on young businessmen
in Ghana forestalled in involving themselves in affairs of
international business simply because of the traditional respect to
elders who do not wish for the younger generation to be involved in
events beyond their national boundaries?9 Or the obstacles to
upward mobility and self-improvement which the resignation of the
poor in certain societies represents? Or the low priority given to the
education of girls because of gender inequality? The point here,
reinforced with countless other studies, is that culture matters in any
collective behaviour, be it social or economic, albeit representing a
very complex story.10 The most pervasive and harmful tendencies in
culture are to revert to the familiar and to revere the past, at the
price of neglecting the present. One cabinet member of an African
country, for example, when questioned on the issue of underfunding
the AIDS programme in his country and how he could look at some
of the accomplishments of Uganda in this area he replied that they,
and “not Uganda had possessed the third highest standard of living
in Africa” twenty-five years ago. Clearly blind pride and a lack of
openness that stands in the way of learning and innovation may not
be prevalent in Bahá’í communities but we are not immune from
such error. Another obstacle is the error induced by conservatism. To
continue with ritual and repetition rather than decipher the real
meaning of tradition is unjustified. It is tantamount to forsaking the
tribulations of the Prophet in providing precisely that new gestalt to
break down ritualistic conservatism.

Growth depends on changing the way we think about growth.

The same for progress, prosperity or any other idea behind man’s
quest for community. Introspection is important. A modern
community stresses a continuous process of self-analysis. The
Universal House of Justice shows its foresight when it writes that
“the periodic reevaluation of the effectiveness of the teaching work
is an essential factor in promoting the growth of every community.”
(Lample p. 132). As one distinguished scholar from Stanford put it
“A modern nation is self-correcting”. (Inkeles One World Emerging,
24). So how people actually think or feel are important concepts.11
Specialists acknowledge now after five decades of frustrated
development, for example, that mental models may offer the best
way to understand and attack the problem of poverty. Our mental
states influence the way we behave and precede culture as the key
variable. Peter Senge, in his groundbreaking book The Fifth
Discipline (1990) defines mental models as “deeply ingrained
assumptions, generalizations, or even pictures or images that
influence how we understand the world and how we take action”. (p
8). Nobel laureate Douglas North writes that human beings use ‘both
... mental models ... and institutions “ to “shape the performance of

economies.” Columnist and economist Paul Krugman admits that
“Economists are notoriously uninterested in how people actually
think or feel.” But again it is counterproductive to discuss a
particular value/attitude typology without being clear of what we
mean by growth. Have a conducive mentality for what? Progress in
which area? Expansion where? Consolidation and improvement to
what end? Progress is commonly defined as a movement towards
economic development, social justice, and political freedom. As
Bahá’ís we do not disagree with this interpretation but find it
imperfect. Its shortcoming is its imbalance.12

Progress is not so much a ‘movement towards’ a desired material
objective but a ‘turning to’ a dominant spiritual force — the
efficient cause which gives finality to all human effort as well as
true balance. Material progress is activity, spiritual progress is
reflexivity.13 Take the latter away and the work of the Cause
becomes the work of an international aid agency and not that of a
‘healing Agency, this leavening Power, this cementing Force,
intensely alive and all-pervasive ...‘ The words of Shakespeare are
revealing: “Take but degree away, untune that string, and hark, what
discord follows. Each thing meets in mere oppugnancy.” (Trolius and
Cressida Act I, scene II): The fairest testimony of mankind to itself
today — its state of disequilibrium and disharmony where vision is
befogged and systems have lost their virtue despite all efforts to
redeem it.

The central issue, therefore, in our discussion on culture,
community and growth should not be so much me—you, us and
them, but between the me here and now and the me there and then.
How I grow daily turning to the heaven of holiness is as vital as how
the community grows periodically moving towards prosperity. How I
recognize my limitations in understanding truth will turn more
effective my work in translating ‘that which hath been written into
reality and action.’ (TB 166) The two processes are interdependent
and are the defining attributes of simultaneously building an ideal
society and perfecting the behaviour of individuals — the key to
resolving Tonnies’ dilemma of society and community. Not
dissimilar to Shoghi Effendi’s message captured in his ‘double
crusade’: “first, to regenerate the inward life” of our own
communities, “and next to assail the longstanding evils that have
entrenched themselves in the life” of nations. (ADJ 34)

Id ols

The mental model needed to carry out this double crusade (to be
defined shortly) cannot be beset with certain natural tendencies or
defects (idols) which prevent us from achieving a full and accurate

Lights of ‘Irfán Book Six 77

understanding of the ethics of community. (The world “idol” here is
used not in the sense of false god but from the Greek eidolon
meaning image or phantom). Many centuries ago a bright
Englishman introduced a famous doctrine which serves us well to
this day.

Francis Bacon (1561-1626), perhaps in his charge to establish the
basis for the emerging scientific philosophy of empiricism,
highlights in his book Novum Organon (1620), four different
classes of idols (Book I Aphorisms 39-68) that we must recognize to
counteract falsehood and avoid dogma and ignorance. One of the
four, Bacon’s ‘Idols of the Tribe’ refer to the natural weaknesses and
tendencies common to human nature. Only the Idols of the Tribe are
not the result of nurture. All the others are acquired through
intercourse with other men and the particular environments in which
thinking takes place. We chose Idola tribus because they are innate,
they cannot be completely eliminated, but only recognized and
compensated for. Some of Bacon’s examples are: reverting to the
familiar, wishful thinking (according to Bacon, we have a natural
inclination to accept, believe, and even prove what we would prefer
to be true), and our tendency to rush to conclusions. Spelling out the
ways in which the Idols of the Tribe come to bear on the human
understanding, persistently creating bias and twisting its workings in
specific directions in specific directions, Bacon observed: ‘The
human understanding resembles not a dry light, but admits a tincture
of the will and passions, which generate their own system
accordingly — for man always believes more readily that which he
prefers.’

Preference here is given to Bacon rather than other modern
theories of unlearning,14 principally because of its datedness and
how, independent of the period, man always incubates misleading
assumptions as self-created barriers to truth owed to fear, prejudice,
and principally, in the case of religion, fixed antagonism. We carry
‘an enchanted glass, full of superstitions and imposture’, which robs
the full potential of the inquiring mind and weakens the beneficial
leverage of mental models designed to see the world anew. The
mental model we are referring to are the concepts of trust and
resignation set in the context of a trustless world and a technology
dependent society with the emphasis being made not so much on the
central importance of these values to personal spiritual development
and social stability but that trust and resignation are indispensable
states of mind in the compelling saga of the quest for true
community. We shall see how both of these attitudes are
consequential to the behavioural implications of steadfastness in the
face of a disobedient self and the lure of irresponsible freedom bent
on interpreting rules in peculiar ways.

Trust and Resignation

In the Book of My Covenant (Kitáb-i-‘Ahdí) two key words
appear early on in the text — ‘trust’ and ‘resignation’:

> Although the Realm of Glory hath none of the vanities of
> the world, yet within the treasury of trust and resignation
> We have bequeathed to Our heirs an excellent and priceless
> heritage. Earthly treasures We have not bequeathed, nor
> have We added such cares as they entail. (TB )
> Trust and resignation, the needed value/attitude typology
referred to earlier, are sister obligations, a sacred dyad, the duality
principle on which depends our outcome as true agents in connexion
with God, where social virtue (trust) and personal quality
(resignation) seal a dynamic coherence between the spiritual and
practical aspects of Bahá’í communities.

In our daily lives we accept and trust the judgement of highly
trained professionals to cure us, to educate us, to protect us. Trust is
a binding, stabilizing, critical factor of social order and progress.
How much so to trust in the judgement of the Divine Physician. The
Manifestations of God are

> the very life of the world, and the skilled physician of each
> ailing soul ... relate thou the Teachings of the Abhá Beauty
> to the urgent needs of this present day, and thou wilt see
> that they provide an instant remedy for the ailing body of
> the world. Indeed, they are the elixir that bringeth eternal
> health. (SWAB 59)
To apply the teachings to the needs of the age we must forsake
our ‘idle fancies and vain imaginings’ and trust the judgement,
vision and understanding of the Prophet. ‘... whatsoever are the
effective means for safeguarding and promoting the happiness and
welfare of the children of men have already been revealed by the
Pen of Glory.’ (TB ) This is not just a pious and spontaneous religious
outburst but a comprehensive statement to believe in and a most
effective ethical value to be shared, especially by those who hold
positions of responsibility in the Cause of God to maintain order and
organization in a divine trust committed to our charge by God’s
Messenger for today.15 No society is possible without order and
Bahá’u’lláh’s concept of order is centralized in the Covenant which
has its genesis in Revelation, authority necessarily superior to human
reason. As such “carries with it Assurance beyond Doubt, Evidence
beyond Exception.”16 The consequence of this axiom is the assent of
reason to authority — the immediate faith (well captured by the
Hebrew word emunah or “trusting in the Covenant”) — and virtues

like loyalty, honesty and dependability or trust must necessarily begin
to flourish.

The Bahá’í model of society not only encourages and protects
such ethics but depends on them for its prosperity. The evolution of
technology, the fermenting of new social relationships and the
consolidation of global networks depend on the prevalence of trust.
But more importantly trust in the Covenant avoids the
disaggregating forces of progress in the secular world as well as
guard against heliocentric tendency of religion to coercive power.
These may be avoided if both community and the institutional
framework remain faithful to the Covenant and conduct their
business on its axis even though they may not know, or cannot fully
understand, the connections or benefits.

There is a broader implication of dependency, however, which is
expressed in the peculiar spiritual vision of Bahá’u’lláh of human
reality:

> They should put their trust in God, and, holding fast unto
> Him, follow in His way ... inasmuch as man can never hope
> to attain unto the knowledge of the All-Glorious, can
> never quaff from the stream of divine knowledge and
> wisdom, can never enter the abode of immortality, nor
> partake of the cup of divine nearness and favour, unless
> and until he ceases to regard the words and deeds of mortal
> men as a standard for the true understanding and
> recognition of God and His Prophets. (KI 3-4)
The Kitáb-i-‘Ahdí has branded in the word Covenant an attitude
to trust very different from current legal-rational codes of conduct
and moral-ethical guides to collective behaviour, no matter how
precise, creative, or even technologically fully proven these have
been made out to be. In the Bahá’í way of life humility is the
cornerstone of trust relationships. Given our overwhelming
limitations as human beings and the need to respect the rules as
active members of a diverse community we have a spiritual
obligation to distance ourselves from any corrupt inclination of
fame and popularity which false notions of rank and position breed.
In the Book of His Covenant, we find the standard against which to
measure our worth not as haughty creatures but as humble servants
conscious of the gift that our virtues are not intrinsically our own
but rather manifestations of the attributes of God.

> ‘Say: all things are of God.’ This exalted utterance is like
> unto water for quenching the fire of hate and enmity
> which smouldereth within the hearts and breasts of men.
> By this single utterance contending peoples and kindreds
will attain the light of true unity.

The greater the humility of the holders of trust the greater the
probability that trust shall succeed as a social virtue; the richer the
quality of servitude the more abundant the results of service; the
more absent ambition, the more present the “esteem and real
affection” of subject to ruler. The effective discharge of duty and
leadership in the Cause is not dependent on proficiency or power but
humility and service and this breeds resignation.17 Patience and
resignation are the hard-earned marks of a true believer because they
represent the highest form of belief as evidenced by sacrifice. But
for trust, however, resignation cannot exist. Acquiescence implies
self-deliverance to a trusting power. Any other combination is
compulsion not resignation and where there is compulsion there is
no joy (“Compulsion and felicity cannot be together”) with all its
implications for social rupture and alienation. Trust must be
established first for resignation to follow; I must trust the law
before I am able to resign and be patient to its outcome. And the
patience I bear must be true and forebearing, anything else is
resignation’s forgery, a cheap, chalked image of a master design. In
Bahá’u’lláh’s mystical work, the Seven Valleys, we read of the fruit
of patience:

> ... without patience the wayfarer on this journey will reach
> nowhere and attain no goal. Nor should he ever be
> downhearted; if he strive for a hundred thousand years and
> yet fail to behold the beauty of the Friend, he should not
> falter.... In their search, they have stoutly girded up the
> loins of service, and seek at every moment to journey from
> the plane of heedlessness into the realm of being. No bond
> shall hold them back, and no counsel shall deter them.

(SVFV 5)
By dominating the ego and its ‘evil passions and desires’ (referred
to in the Book of His Covenant as nafs and havas) — precisely the
two imposters in Bacon’s tribe of Idols — we are free to surrender.
Trust in authority higher than our own and resignation to
circumstances beyond our control has as its basis the strength of
certitude and conscious faith and not the powerlessness of passive
fatalism or self-denial. This is the poverty of resignation and creates
obdurate mental models that impede progress and victimize its
participants. ‘It is good to suffer in this life because in the next life
you will find eternal reward’. Or ‘We must not challenge the will of
God’. Such impoverished mind-sets need to be reoriented to
promote prosperity. Nor does resignation mean to be imprudent. The
words of a fisherman from Galilee resound to this day “Be ye
therefore wise as serpents and harmless as doves.” Mathew 10:16

Bahá’u’lláh has swept away the belief in the virtue of living a
hard life as invented by Stoics or argued by Cynics.18 In the Bahá’í

Covenant resignation is not an end in itself but a means for patient
obedience to be learnt. Submission to the Will of God in the last
analysis helps us accept outcomes contrary to our expectations — a
state of mind which our natural pride disallows with insolence. As
the lesson of Abraham offering his son Isaac for sacrifice in the Old
Testament teaches us no sacrifice is too hard when God demands it.
Resignation is trust in the mystery of the standard, “He doeth what
He willeth, ordaineth what He pleaseth.” ( Qur'án 2:254)

This is valid in our daily lives as much as it is in our
administrative duties as Bahá’ís or in our research as scholars. Well-
intentioned effort and praiseworthy achievement vanish in the
Cause when those responsible for such acts become proud and
arrogant, ‘the most deadly of sins” and dismiss contrariness with airy
condescension. Blatant disrespect, even its lesser manifestation
grudging compliance, are tantamount to forgetting our part of the
bargain as loyal covenanters (no partnership withstands the cult of
the petty personality for any length of time) aside from displaying a
poor understanding of the ultimate aim in the life of every soul — to
attain spiritual excellence.

> Whoever has is eyes fixed on the goal of attaining the

It is to this aspect of contentment and resignation that part of
Bahá’u’lláh’s     Tablet   Madínatu’r-Ridá   (City of      Radiant
Acquiescence), revealed in Baghdád, advances. To be pleased with
the believers and to be humble before them is explained in the
Tablet as an important attribute of “contentment and radiant
acquiescence.”

> To show pride towards them is to show pride to God; for

Bereft of God’s love, service in the Covenant is barren. Without
radiance and resignation efforts in promoting the interests of the
Cause lose efficacy. Applying the mental model of trust and
resignation all human calculation is suspended. It is the dialectic of
faith at its most refined (we are conscious of our choice but on the
strength of the seemingly absurd) of which we can only form a
conception and not a comprehension. The incommensurable,
however, is recognizable given its heroic quality, memorably defined
by Kierkegaard: “The knights of infinite resignation are readily

recognizable, their gait is gliding, bold.” (Fear and Trembling 1843,
67).

Final W ords

To correct the antithetical tendencies of society and community
and to understand the new culture of growth that is sweeping before
us (the world-wide reception to a sequence of courses offered by
training institutes and the movement of geographic clusters from
one stage of growth to the next has hardly been an easy learning
experience not to mention trying) and avoid being the ‘magical
religion’ in the Weberian sense we must question our accumulated
beliefs, methods, knowledge, systems, habits, stories and traditional
patterns of community behaviour. We become comfortable with our
limited models, despite their obvious incompleteness. We are
hesitant with the new because of our misconceived loyalties. The
new culture is a credence good — it has to be taken on faith. Its
quality cannot be determined by inspection, in advance of purchase.
That is why monitoring input is so important. If the quality of the
output cannot be determined readily, the next best way of
ascertaining quality may be to monitor input quality. Not to screen
the three active participants of social change but to approach
individuals, institutions, and the community with compassion and
understanding and raising each of them to a new level of spirituality.

With regard to the ideal society, all philosophers whether classical
or revolutionary attest to the ascendancy of the spiritual bond over
all others in maintaining the fabric of society. The community of
mind is the closest to such an image. It is a community whose
language is a spiritual language; it is not spoken, it is felt. It is a
community that recognizes the fundamental needs of human
existence and self-expression but no longer blames the order or
society for its defects. It regards as shameful for its members to
have to rely on others to obtain their inner sense of justice. This
makes of us slaves and others our master. The root of the Latin word
‘societas’ is to share, to unite, man’s carbon copy of an ancient
divine exhortation: “... let us walk by the same rule, let us mind the
same thing.” (Philippians 3:16) and the Master’s oft-repeated
desideratum: “... that we may unite even as the waves of one sea and
become merged together as the rays of Thine effulgent Light; that
our thoughts, our views, our feelings may become as one reality,
manifesting the spirit of union throughout the world.” (BP 138) By
combining social perception (Tonnies) with philosophical perspective
(Bacon) and by acknowledging the Bahá’í categorical imperative of
trust in the Divine Covenant and its institutions, we have not today
constructed the community of mind so much as tried to portray the
need to be masters of the art of composition when attempting to

bring communities as close as possible to the divine original. In
bringing all lives, all ends, all values and all means into total
articulation with one another we must, first and foremost, be artists
and not technicians, poets and not statesmen, rational souls and not
public intellectuals. Skepticism be replaced by estheticism, workers
by seekers. In short, a community composed of men and women
with ‘fire in their minds’. “The passion ending, doth the purpose
lose.” (Shakespeare, Hamlet)

\[8\] The idea of a systematic approach to Bahá’í activity first appears in
‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s Tablet to the Bahá’ís of the Central States, revealed on
March 29, 1916 where he counsels that the teaching effort should be
conducted ‘systematically and enthusiastically’.

\[9\] Such pressure of course can have the opposite effect as in the case of
Chinese merchants who had no choice but to excel at making money
because Confucianism formally placed the merchants near the bottom
of the social scale. Plato had similar disregard for the commercial class
relegating them to the lower abdomen together with craftsmen and
husbandmen in his analogy of comparing the activities of the State with
bodily functions (Republic).

\[10\] The fact that the same values do produce different consequences in
different circumstances is just one of the paradoxical relationship
between culture and economic behaviour.

\[11\] Sociologists as early as the 1900s questioned the cultural origins of
economic development beginning with Max Weber’s famous work Die

protestantische Ethik und der Geist des Kapitalismus (The Protestant
Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism) 1922; then followed by
anthropologists such as Margaret Mead and Ruth Benedict (her teacher)
in the 1940s, to be completed in the 1980s with the most prominent
contribution to the value of culture in understanding societies written
by Lawrence Harrison, entitled “Underdevelopment Is a State of Mind
— the Latin American Case” (1985) where he concludes that culture has
been a primary obstacle to development.

\[12\] Social observers refer to development along exclusively material
lines and focus on three drivers: technology (scientific advance), goods
(economic output), and freedom (political, cultural and social
emancipation). The materialist stance is highlighted by a World Bank
publication, The Quality of Growth (2000), which equates quality of life
with higher per capita income, equitable education and job
opportunities, greater gender equality, better health and nutrition,
cleaner and more sustainable natural environment, more impartial
judicial and legal system, broader civil and political freedom and a
richer cultural life.

\[13\] Reflexivity does not simply imply reflection, but a “self-
confrontation created by the dynamics of modernisation” (Giddens,
Beck “Reflexive Modernization ”, 1995). The disposition for reflexivity
is created by the constant flow of information characterizing modern
communities and which forces these simultaneously to revise
themselves. The spiritual dimension is the collective self-confrontation
with eternal spiritual principles.

\[14\] Systems thinking (and its sensibility for subtle interconnectedness),
feedback concepts of cybernetics and servo-mechanism engineering
theory are all famously discussed and applied in Peter M. Senge’s The
Fifth Discipline: the Art & Practice of the Learning Organization, 1990,
Doubleday.

\[15\] Reference here to elected Bahá’í representatives and scholars may
not be uncalled given that so much responsibility is borne by these
legitimately qualified defenders of social order and progress, especially
scholars, whose high attainment “make it possible for them to
contribute in important ways to the advancement of civilization [and]
are deserving of society’s recognition and gratitude.” Letter written on
behalf of the Universal House of Justice to an individual believer,
March 14, 1996.

\[16\] John Locke, quoted in Wendy M. Heller’s exposition “Covenant and
the Foundations of Civil Society”, published in BW 1995-96. If faith
constitutes the supreme degree of assent possible by human reason,
this poses a serious challenge especially to Bahá’í scholars who must
“try to avoid the snare of allowing a divorce between their faith and
their reason.” See the Memorandum on Scholarship in the Universal
House of Justice letter dated January 3rd, 1979.

\[17\] Much debate today is being centred on the concept of the servant-
leader as the management paradigm of the future where the philosophy
of service is present in the practice of leadership. Embedded in

teamwork and community, the servant-leader asks the questions,
“Whom do we serve?” and “For what purpose?” testing the idea that
those served grow as persons, “become healthier, wiser, freer, more
autonomous, more likely themselves to become servants.” See The
Power of Servant Leadership, edited by Larry C. Spears. See also a
seminal article by Jim Collins entitled “Level 5 Leadership, the Triumph
of Humility and Fierce Resolve”, Harvard Business Review, January
2001 issue.

\[18\] The common ground of Stoicism and Cynicism is the manner in which
both respond to the inevitable cycle of senescence and decay. Their
gesture that living in accordance with Nature reduces man’s wants is
not a celebration of life but its depreciation, and therefore contrary
to Bahá’í belief.
