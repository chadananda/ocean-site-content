> **Abstract:**  
>   
> The concept of the "mystic cup" and its heavenly draught is a fine thread woven throughout Bahá’í sacred writings, repeatedly disclosing the fundamentally mystic character of the Bahá’í Faith. However, in the U.S. Bahá’í community there is often a lack of awareness and little intuitive sense for what constitutes the mystical. Even though the situation has improved in recent years', many deepened Bahá’ís have little idea what the word means. Given the lack of depth of understanding within the Bahá’í community as well as the misappropriation of the word in popular culture we have a majority of the Bahá’ís with a weak grasp of what constitutes mysticism. "The Mystic Cup" shows that the Bahá’í Faith is first and foremost mystical and clarifies the Bahá’í concept of the mystical. 'Abdu'l-Bahá's projection of a "mystic oneness" that will gradually bond all the hearts of the world is a basis for much of the paper. The notion of "heart" appeals to a wider audience. The paper establishes the "heart" as the center of the "mystic feeling" and discuses how this heart-centered mystic oneness not only incites individual spiritual transformation but is at the core of all social and administrative remedies necessary to finally effect the "mystic change" that the Guardian predicts will take place in society as a whole. Arguments are well supported and the author believes we as Bahá’ís must give this area much more attention.

The Mystic Cup: The Essential Mystical Nature of the Bahá’í Faith

by LeRoy Jones

> Verily, verily, the dawn of a new Day has broken. The prom is ed One is enthroned in the
> hearts of men. In His hand He holds the mystic cup, the chalice of immortality. Blessed
> are they who drink therefrom!1               —The Báb to Mullá Óusayn and Mullá ‘Alí

fter years of waiting and searching for the Promised One, Mullá Óusayn found his heart’s desire—a

A      young merchant who called Himself the Báb. In their first meeting the Báb invited Mullá Óusayn

to His residence and revealed His mission with proofs and testimonies, which Mullá Óusayn
painstakingly scrutinized. But there was more. Mullá Óusayn described his encounter with the Báb:

> I sat spellbound by His utterance, oblivious of time and of those who awaited me...the call of
> the Mu’adhdh-in, summoning the faithful to their morning prayer, awakened me from the state
> of ecstasy into which I seemed to have fallen. All the delight, all the ineffable glories, which the
> Almighty has recounted in His Book as the priceless possessions of the people of Paradise—these
> I seemed to be experiencing that night.2
Hence, Mullá Óusayn depicted his state of captivated mystical ecstasy. Within days of this initial meet-
ing Mullá Óusayn and fellow seeker Mullá ‘Alí returned to the house of the Báb, wherein the Báb dis-
closed His mission to Mullá ‘Alí who became His second follower. However, this second meeting was dif-
ferent. According to Nabíl, “...all argument had been set aside and nothing but the spirit of intense ado-
ration and ardent fellowship prevailed.”3 The words from the opening quote were revealed at this time in
an atmosphere that was “vital iz ed by that celestial potency which emanated from His inspired utterance.
Everything in that room seemed to be vibrating with this testimony.”4 Enthralled, these two chosen apos-
tles responded to this divine summons to partake of the “mystic cup.”

Likewise fifteen more souls after Mullá Óusayn and Mullá ‘Alí attained the presence of the Báb and
were declared “Letters of the Liv in g.” One more remained to complete the number of these first faithful
followers. The soon-to-be eighteenth Letter of the Liv in g, Quddus, approached Mullá Óusayn and plead-
ed to attain the presence of the Báb. Mullá Óusayn restrained him, te ll ing Quddus the time was not right.
Hastening to the Báb, Mullá Óusayn described Quddus’ persistence. The Báb replied, “Marvel not at his
strange behaviour. We have in the world of the spirit been communing with that youth. We know him
already.”5 Nabíl asked, “…had not the mystic bond of the spirit linked their souls together?”6 Shortly
thereafter Nabíl observed the Báb in prayer before the rising sun, “He seemed to be addressing, in mys-
tic language, that shining lum in ary, and to be entrusting it with His message of yearning and love to
His concealed Beloved.” 7 Thus we see the intensely mystical nature of the opening days of the Bábí Faith.

Over much of the last twenty-five years as a Bahá’í, I have read passages such as the above account of
the first Bábís and wondered, “What has happened? Why do we now seem so far removed from these
deeply spiritual roots?” Admittedly, these first followers were exposed to a tremendous release of spiri-
tual power. However, after discovering more and more of the Bahá’í writings that involve the mystical,
I became convinced that this is a greatly overlooked area of the Bahá’í Faith. This issue becomes partic-
ularly poignant when we consider that the Bahá’í Faith has, in this writer’s estimation, one of the most
powerfully moving and exquisitely beautiful bodies of mystical works ever produced. Bahá’u’lláh, in the
Kitáb-i-ˆqán repeatedly pulses into beautiful and poetic revelations of mystic reality. In the Hidden

Lights of ‘Irfán

Words spiritual nugget after spiritual nugget mightily reveals the previously hidden “mystic and won-
drous Bride.”8 The ardent seeker quickly feels the magnificence and charm of The Seven Valleys. Even
the Kitáb-i-Aqdas alludes to the mystic nature of divine law as it unseals the “choice Wine with the fin-
gers of might and power.” 9

The purpose of this paper is twofold. First, it seeks to clarify from Bahá’í scripture what constitutes
the fundamentals of the mystical experience and, second, to show that an overt, systematic focus on
mysticism within this Bahá’í context is essential if the Bahá’í Faith is to make significant progress with
personal transformation as well as moving toward the goal of a spiritually unified world. This is not an
attempt to compare commonly held views of mysticism to the Bahá’í Faith, nor is it in any manner an
endeavor to define what might be considered a comprehensive theology of Bahá’í mysticism. Rather this
paper focuses on the mystical experience itself. This experience is best described as spiritual commu-
nion with the Manifestation of God and this communion is at the heart of the transformation process.
I will attempt to use the Bahá’í writings to paint in broad brushstrokes a general picture of the mysti-
cal experience and the implications this raises regarding the future of the Bahá’í Faith. This discussion
offers a fundamental understanding of the mystical experience in the hope that increasing numbers of
Bahá’ís will engage in a more detailed and serious pursuit of what is involved in mystical endeavor. Even
though this paper will raise many more questions regarding the mystical experience and its relation to
Bahá’í theology and community life than it answers, one of its major purposes is to raise those very
questions.

A brief clarification of a few of the ways that we encounter the word mystic in the Bahá’í writings
may be prudent. We often see the word mystic used, but the words mystical and mysticism are rarely
used. We must always keep in mind that the very nature of this subject defies definition—that which is
mystic is mysterious, difficult to understand, ineffable. The Guardian uses the term “mystic feeling” and
describes it as the experience “that unites man with God” and that this “spiritual communion” is the
“core of religion” and is “best achieved through prayer.”10 I use this as the main point of reference for all
other uses of the word. Most of us can relate to the sense of unity and connectedness, wonder and awe
that occurs during prayer. Even though this feeling varies in intensity it is common and nearly univer-
sal. Since this experience is the core of religion it makes sense to use this passage as a sort of touc hs tone
for other uses and understand in gs of the word.

When Shoghi Effendi writes of a mystic Source, he notes a Source that is mysterious.11 We cannot
understand the nature of this Source, but it may be that since the word is capital iz ed it signifies
Bahá’u’lláh in one of His forms and we might assume that this is the spiritual Source with which we
commune through prayer. Bahá’u’lláh writes of a “mystic transformation.”12 This transformation leads to
an ecstasy and a yearning for God, which once again suggests deep spiritual communion with the
Manifestation. However, this level of communion can lead to a mystic awareness or “true knowledge”13
that brings us to a variation in meaning but is likely linked to the spiritual communion of which the
Guardian wrote. These shades of meaning will hopefully become clearer through the course of this paper.
Of course, it would be best to examine the original Persian and Arabic words, but that is perhaps beyond
the scope of this paper and is certainly beyond the author’s current knowledge. It is worth noting, how-
ever, that when writing in English the Guardian used the word in various ways, which are helpful to us
in elucidating its mean in gs.

One should also keep in mind that communion with the Manifestation is one of the ways we come to
know God. Bahá’u’lláh says, “The supreme cause for creating the world and all that is therein is for man
to know God.”14 A letter written on behalf of the Guardian relates this to the mystical, “There is, there-
fore, only one way to God and that is through the real iz ation of his Manifestation or Prophet in that
age…. The mystic path that the traveler should follow is therefore to the Prophet. By coming in contact
with Him will he obtain peace.”15 In another letter he relates this to communion, “He [Manifestation]...is
all we can ever know of...God. Therefore, we address ourselves in prayer and thought to Him, or through
Him to that Infinite Essence behind and beyond Him.”16

Since this paper is written by a Westerner to a Western audience, any statements made regard in g
Bahá’ís only applies to the West, and the United States in particular. Even though the multiplicity of per-

\[70\] The Mystic Cup

spectives within the Bahá’í Faith precludes simple general iz ation, there is a tendency among Bahá’ís in
the U.S. to have little understanding of the subject. This propensity is coupled with the misappropriation
of the word in general society, which tends to look upon the mystical as some mysterious or paranormal
phenomenon with no necessary connection to religion. Also, some Bahá’ís dismiss mysticism as risky,
psychic tinkering with the spiritual realm or as a dangerous pursuit of an elite and exclusive knowledge.
In addition, among Bahá’ís there is some tendency to associate the word mysticism to the many schools
of eastern mysticism. Even though there are some similarities, there is a significant difference between
what the Bahá’í scriptures portray and what these many mystical disciplines depict as mystical endeav-
or. These differences would make fascinating and important studies, however, such work is beyond the
reach of this paper. All of these issues are justifiable concerns and they raise important questions.
However, it may be that we are allowing excessive caution in these areas to paralyze important efforts
within the arena of legitimate mystical endeavor.

Consequently, among western Bahá’ís we see a general lack of awareness and little intuitive sense for
what constitutes the mystical. Even though the situation has improved in recent years, even many deep-
ened Bahá’ís have little idea what the word means. A comprehension of the terminology is not necessary
for a mystical connection with Bahá’u’lláh. However, the problem is more complex. Seena Fazel, in his
article, Interreligious Dialogue and the Bahá’í Faith, argues that the Bahá’ís could learn much from the
mystical intensity of other religions. Mr. Fazel quotes a non-Bahá’í anthropologist who, after observing
a service at the Bahá’í House of Worship in Wilmette noted:

> What was read from each text destroyed the particularity of the tradition from which it was
> drawn, leav in g, seemingly, but banal platitudes.17
There are many deeply spiritual devotions in the Bahá’í Faith, however, we should not ignore this per-
ception particularly when noting another observation of Mr. Fazel’s regarding Bahá’í scholar Jacques
Chouleur, who is concerned that Bahá’ís in the West are reticent in regard to the mystical and commu-
nity aspects, while preferring a focus on the social teachings.18 Mr. Chouleur notes those Bahá’ís who are
working pr im ar ily for the social teachings:

> The transfiguration of the earthly world by the implementation of the Bahá’í principles may be
> for them a doubtless exhilarating objective, but quite incomplete, insufficient if it is deprived
> of mysticism and contemplation.19
Complementing this emphasis on social concerns, the Universal House of Justice noted the infiltra-
tion of secular tendencies in our community in its May 19, 1994 letter to the U.S. National Spiritual
Assembly.20 Although the Universal House of Justice discussed the secular nature of Bahá’í administra-
tion in its relationship to the general Bahá’í community, it is likely these tendencies filter into all areas
of Bahá’í life. Promoting social change as well as many other Bahá’í goals can easily become mostly sec-
ular enterprises. The Universal House of Justice quoted the Guardian in the May 19th letter as follows:

> The friends must never mistake the Bahá’í administration for an end in itself. It is merely the
> instrument of the spirit of the Faith. This Cause...is designed to benefit the entire human race,
> and the only way it can do this is to reform the community life of mankind, as well as seeking
> to regenerate the ind iv idu al .21 [emphasis mine]
Aligning our personal lives as well as our social and administrative efforts with this “spirit of the
Faith” should be the paramount goal of all Bahá’ís. In our excessively mate r i al is tic society it is difficult
to maintain a constant focus on the spiritual, which makes it easy to get caught up in the trends and
tendencies of the broad culture. To overcome these effects a deep mystical relationship with Bahá’u’lláh
is essential. This paper will show that the mystical is inextricably linked to this “spirit of the Faith” and
that the Bahá’í Faith is first and foremost mystical. The success of our efforts in teaching, administra-
tion, community build in g, and social issues are contingent on developing the mystic feeling. The spiri-
tual energy needed for personal and global transformation is dependent on both an individual and col-
lective mystical connection to Bahá’u’lláh.

Lights of ‘Irfán

The analogy of the mystic cup, the chalice of immortality of which the Báb spoke, is a fine thread
woven through the writings of Bahá’u’lláh.22 In the Hidden Words, Bahá’u’lláh incites, “ Take...the chal-
ice of immortal life...that thou mayest hearken unto the mystic voice,”23 and “sweet is the holy ecstasy if
thou drinkest of the mystic chalice.”24 In the Tablet of Carmel, even Carmel is instructed, “Seize thou
the Chalice of Immortality...and give thanks unto Him, inasmuch as He...transmuted thy grief into bliss-
ful joy.”25 Pronouncements regarding the cup of certitude, the mystic wine, the celestial draught, and the
draught of love are sprinkled throughout the sacred texts. These and many other similar phrases under-
lie the importance of this symbolic and mystical action—partaking of the wine of certitude that “trans-
mutheth the souls of men.”

Bahá’u’lláh in the Kitáb-i-ˆqán, in describing the early followers of a previous Manifestation, is like-
ly speaking of the same mystic cup as was the Báb, which endowed its partakers “with the grace of a new
life”:

> These same people, though wrapt in...veils of limitation...as soon as they drank the immortal
> draught, from the cup of certitude, at the ha nd of the Manifestation of the All-Glorious, were so
> transformed that they would renounce for His sake their kindred, their substance, their lives, their
> beliefs, yea, all else save God! So overpowering was their yearning for God, so uplifting their
> transports of ecstatic delight, that the world and all that is therein faded before their eyes into
> nothingness.26
Drinking of the mystic cup, the cup of certitude, wrought a dramatic transformation in the lives of
these early believers. Bahá’u’lláh calls it a “mystic transformation” as He continues:

> It is evident that nothing short of this mystic transformation could cause such spirit and behav-
> iour, so utterly unlike their previous habits and manners, to be made manifest in the world of
> being. For their agitation was turned into peace, their doubt into certitude, their timidity into
> courage. Such is the potency of the Divine Elixir, which, swift as the twinkling of an eye, trans-
> muteth the souls of men!27
The Divine Elixir, this mystical draught, effected a radical transformation—an overpowering yearning
for God and a dramatic change in their “habits and manners.” Can we in today’s world also partake of
the heavenly elixir? Or was it only ava il able to followers at the time of the Manifestation—people who
associated with Him while He was on earth—a period when great feats and strong endeavor was essen-
tial?

Perhaps the potency of the mystic draught was stronger at the time of the Báb’s and Bahá’u’lláh’s phys-
ical presence. However, Shoghi Effendi makes clear that this mystic power is always ava il able:

> That the cause associated with the name of Bahá’u’lláh feeds itself upon those hidden spr in gs of
> celestial strength which no force of human personality, whatever its glamour, can replace; that
> its reliance is solely upon that mystic Source with which no worldly advantage, be it wealth, fame
> or learning can compare; that it propagates itself by ways mysterious and utterly at variance with
> the standards accepted by the generality of mankind, will, if not already apparent, become
> increasingly manifest as it forges ahead towards fresh conquests in its struggle for the spiritual
> regeneration of mankind. [emphasis mine]28
Not only are these hidden spr in gs of mystic power always ava il able, but, their effects will “become
increasingly manifest.” Apparently this mystical force, or at least its effects, will intensify with time and
not dim in ish with Bahá’u’lláh’s physical departure. Most importantly, the Guardian informs us that the
Cause relies “solely upon that mystic Source.”

Even the Universal House of Justice has encouraged Bahá’ís to develop the “mystic feeling” as recent-
ly as the Ridván 150 letter to the Bahá’ís of the World:

> No less essential to nourishing this vitality [of faith] is the cultivation of a sense of spirituality,
> that mystic feeling which unites the individual with God and is achieved through meditation and
> prayer.29

\[72\] The Mystic Cup

The Universal House of Justice calls the mystic feeling “a sense of spirituality”—something we experi-
ence. They use the word cultivate as though it is something we must care for, nurture and develop.

In the following letter to an ind iv idual believer, the Guardian placed these same ideas in the context
of a materialistic society.

> …[t]he spirit of the age, taken on the whole, is irreligious. Man’s outlook upon life is too crude
> and materialistic to enable him to elevate himself into the higher realms of spirit. It is this con-
> dition, so sadly morbid, into which society has fallen, that religion seeks to improve and trans-
> form. For the core of religious faith is that mystic feeling which unites man with God.30
In the above quote the Guardian stated that the cause relies “solely on that Mystic source”31 and here
he says the mystic feeling is the “core of religious faith.” Apparently there is nothing more fundamental
and important than developing the mystical. This importance is underscored by Shoghi Effendi’s asser-
tion that the way we can overcome the materialistic condition of society is through religion. Religion
seeks to “transform” this condition. Since the core of religion is the “mystic feeling” we must assume that
the mystic feeling is at the heart of the transforming process and that transformation is in some way an
elevation to a higher spiritual level, “the higher realms of spirit” that our present crudeness prohibits us
from experiencing. Shoghi Effendi proceeds by giving some evidence as to what the mystic feeling is.

> This state of spiritual communion can be brought about and maintained by means of medita-
> tion and prayer. And this is the reason why Bahá’u’lláh has so much stressed the importance of
> worship. It is not sufficient for a believer to merely accept and observe the teachings. He should,
> in addition, cultivate the sense of spirituality, which he can acquire chiefly by means of prayer.32
The Guardian depicts the mystic feeling as “spiritual communion” and as “a sense of spirituality” and
perhaps as “worship.” After describing the mystic feeling as the core of religion Shoghi Effendi now
explains that, “It is not sufficient for a believer to merely accept and observe the teachings.” Belief and
action are not enough. Bahá’u’lláh reinforces this concept in the Kitáb-i-ˆqán by noting, “One hour’s
reflection is preferable to seventy years of pious worship.”33 One must be in touch with the mystical core
through “spiritual communion” and by cultivating a “sense of spirituality.”

Adib Taherzadeh, during a talk at the Bahá’í House of Worship in Wilmette, Illinois, said, “Teaching
is not the problem. The problem is that we must develop a love for Bahá’u’lláh.”34 What is a love for
Bahá’u’lláh? The following portion of a letter advising a Local Spiritual Assembly, written on behalf of
Shoghi Effendi, helps to clarify this:

> [He]...should study more deeply the teachings, and meditate on what he studies. We liken God to
> the Sun, which gives us all our life. So the Spirit of God reaches us through the Souls of the
> Manifestations. We must learn to commune with Their Souls, and this is what the Martyrs
> seemed to have done, and what brought them such ecstasy of joy that life became nothing. This
> is the true mysticism, and the secret, inner meaning of life which humanity has at present, drift-
> ed so far from.35 [emphasis mine]
‘Abdu’l-Bahá ties this communion with the souls of the manifestations to love”:

> …drink deep of the mystic cup of heavenly love and know the rapture of being drawn ever clos-
> er unto the Realm of the All-Glorious.36 [emphasis mine]
Through this true mysticism, communing with the soul of the Manifestation, we drink deeply of heav-
enly love, which draws us closer and closer to our Beloved. Mr. Taherzadeh also said that once we estab-
lish this love for Bahá’u’lláh, teaching will be no problem—we would be unable to keep our mouths shut.37
Likewise, effective adm in is t ration, strong communities and all other Bahá’í goals will be more attain-
able. Returning to the previous letter of Shoghi Effendi we see this idea reinforced:

> The Bahá’í Faith, like all other Divine religions, is thus fundamentally mystic in character. Its
> chief goal is the development of the individual and society, through the acquisition of spiritual
> virtues and powers. It is the soul of man that has first to be fed. And this spiritual nour is hm e n t

Lights of ‘Irfán

> prayer can best provide. Laws and institutions, as viewed by Bahá’u’lláh, can become really
> effective only when our inner spiritual life has been perfected and transformed. Otherwise reli-
> gion will degenerate into a mere organ iz ation, and become a dead thing.38
To avoid lifeless religion we must develop its mystic character. Transformation attained through the
nour is hment of spiritual communion generates spiritual virtues and powers. Our inner life, our mystic
life, must be perfected and transformed. Above, Bahá’u’lláh noted a “mystic transformation.” The
Universal House of Justice further discusses this concept of transformation:

> It is not enough to proclaim the Bahá’í message, essential as that is. It is not enough to expand
> the rolls of Bahá’í membership, vital as that is. Souls must be transformed, communities there-
> by consolidated, new models of life thus attained. Transformation is the essential purpose of the
> Cause of Bahá’u’lláh, but it lies in the will and effort of the ind iv idual to achieve it in obedi-
> ence to the Covenant.39 [emphasis mine]
What an intriguing relationship which exists between the “mystic feeling” and transformation! As the
mystic feeling is the core of religious faith we see that transformation is “the essential purpose of the
Cause.” One is described as the core, the other as the “essential purpose.” Previously we saw the Guardian
note that religion seeks to transform our mate r i al is tic cond i ti on through its mystic core.40
Transformation through the “true mysticism”—communing with the souls of the manifestations by
dwelling in the love of God—is our real goal. How important for us to further our understanding of the
relationship between these two fundamentals—mysticism and transformation!
‘Abdu’l-Bahá sheds further light on the relationship between Bahá’í mysticism and regeneration:

> I beg of God to strengthen these spiritual bonds as day followeth day, and make this mystic one-
> ness to shine ever more brightly, until at last all shall be as troops marshaled together beneath
> the banner of the Covenant within the sheltering shade of the Word of God; that they may strive
> with all their might until universal fellowship, close and warm, and unalloyed love, and spiri-
> tual relationships, will connect all the hearts of the world. Then will all humankind, because of
> this fresh and dazzling bounty, be gathered in a single homeland. Then will conf lict and dis-
> sension vanish from the face of the earth, then will mankind be cradled in love for the beauty
> of the All-Glorious.41 [emphasis mine]
Notice that the Master explains that “spiritual bonds” will strengthen to make a mystic oneness shine.

Also, fellowship, love, and spiritual relationships will connect all the hearts of the world. Only after all
the hearts are connected with spiritual bonds that lead to a mystic oneness will humankind attain to true
peace and harmony. Clearly, the spiritual heart is tied to the mystical. A deeper understanding of what
is meant by “heart” will enhance our understanding of the mystical process.

Bahá’u’lláh is unm is takable on the importance of the heart. He says, “My first counsel is this: Possess
a pure, kindly and radiant heart...”42 Likewise, in the Kitáb-i-ˆqán when Bahá’u’lláh addresses the true
seeker, who “must, before all else, cleanse and purify his heart.”43

Before all priorities we must focus on the heart. After requesting that we cleanse our heart Bahá’u’lláh
refers to the heart as, “the seat of the revelation of the inner mysteries of God.” He then urges us to
purge the breast [heart], “which is the sanctuary of the abiding love of the beloved” and then to “sanc-
tify” one’s soul.”44

The spiritual heart is the seat of the revelation of inner mysteries—the place we gain true spiritual
vision. It is the sanctuary of love and if not identical to the soul is inextricably linked to it—the locus
of the soul—the point where true spiritual insight and the love of God can abide. The heart is the chan-
nel45 between the spiritual and material world. The tarnished heart, therefore, cannot reflect the glory of
God.

After admonishing us to cleanse our hearts, Bahá’u’lláh describes the results of a pure heart. When we
have truly kindled a spirit of search through intense striving and devotion and reached a state of “fer-

\[74\] The Mystic Cup

vid love, of rapture, and ecstasy” within the heart, we will attain a new level of awareness. Then will
“the darkness of error be dispelled, the mists of doubts and misgiv in gs be dissipated, and the lights of
knowledge and certitude envelop his being. At that hour will the mystic Herald, bearing the joyful tid-
ings of the Spirit, shine forth from the City of God resplendent as the morn, and, through the trum-
petblast of knowledge, will awaken the heart, the soul, and the spirit from the slumber of negligence.
Then will the manifold favours and outpouring grace of the holy and everlasting Spirit confer such new
life upon the seeker that he will find himself endowed with a new eye, a new ear, a new heart, and a new
mind.”46

The cleansing process leads to an awakening. Bahá’u’lláh as the mystic Herald gives us “a new eye, a
new ear, a new heart and a new mind.” What are these new faculties? Returning to the Kitáb-i-ˆqán:

> It is incumbent upon thee, by the permission of God, to cleanse the eye of thine heart from the
> things of the world, that thou mayest realize the infinitude of divine knowledge, and mayest
> behold Truth so clearly that thou wilt need no proof to demonstrate His reality, nor any evidence
> to bear witness unto His testimony.47
In the opening words of the Kitáb-i-ˆqán it says we must sanctify and cleanse our eyes.48 In this pas-
sage Bahá’u’lláh speaks of cleansing the eye of “thine heart”—cleanse the spiritual eye and then with that
“new eye” we will behold Truth clearly. So clearly that one will need no proof or evidence—our spiritu-
al sight will be so acute that it will pass beyond the realm of words and logic—we will simply see.
In fact, at another place in the Kitáb-i-ˆqán Bahá’u’lláh notes:

> When the stream of utterance reached this stage, We beheld, and lo! the sweet savours of God
> were being wafted from the dayspring of Revelation, and the morning breeze was blowing out
> of the Sheba of the Eternal. Its tid in gs rejoiced anew the heart, and imparted immeasurable glad-
> ness to the soul. It made all things new, and brought unnumbered and inestimable gifts from the
> unknowable Friend. The robe of human praise can never hope to match Its noble stature, and Its
> shining figure the mantle of utterance can never fit. Without word It unfoldeth the inner mys-
> teries, and without speech It revealeth the secrets of the divine say in gs.49
More than likely the stream of utterance is the never ending Word of God that is continually renewed.

This “stream of utterance” is able to unfold the mysteries without words and reveal the divine say in gs
without speech. “Human praise” cannot describe this stream of Revelation, nor can utterance fit its
stature. Without Words what inner mysteries or divine say in gs can be revealed? What does this mean?
What kind of utterance describes without utterance? What words are revealed without words? At first
glance it appears as some kind of circular gibberish. What is Bahá’u’lláh say in g?

To help answer these questions let us examine another tablet wherein Bahá’u’lláh, instead of referring
to a stream of utterance, refers to a stream of words:

> When the stream of words reached this stage, the sweet savours of true knowledge were shed
> abroad and the day-star of divine unity shone forth above the hor iz on of His holy utterance.
> Blessed is he whom His Call hath attracted to the summit of glory, who hath drawn nigh to the
> ultimate Purpose, and who hath reco g n iz ed through the shrill voice of My Pen of Glory that
> which the Lord of this world and of the next hath willed. Whoso faileth to quaff the choice wine
> which We have unsealed through the potency of Our Name, the All-Comp e ll in g, shall be unable
> to discern the splendours of the light of divine unity or to grasp the essential purpose underly-
> ing the Scriptures of God, the Lord of heaven and earth.50
When this “stream of words” reaches a certain point, “true knowledge” is dispensed. What is this “true
knowledge?” Rather than directly referring to a message beyond words we see “the shrill voice” of the
Pen of Glory, which the attracted ones can hear. Next Bahá’u’lláh mentions those who “quaff the choice
w in e.” They will discern the “purpose underlying the Scriptures of God.” Notice, these are not the peo-
ple who understand the words of the Scriptures, but those who discern the design “underlying” them; a
purpose not within the Scriptures but fundamental to them—supporting and holding them. Once again

Lights of ‘Irfán

we see the idea of a message or purpose that transcends words and utterance. In fact it appears that this
purpose is pr im ary and that the actual written Book is somehow subsumed by this “essential purpose.”
Could this be the “true knowledge?”51

‘Abdu’l-Bahá sheds more light:

> It is my hope that you may put forth your most earnest endeavor to accomplish this end, that
> you may investigate and study the Holy Scriptures word by word so that you may attain knowl-
> edge of the mysteries hidden therein. Be not satisfied with words, but seek to understand the
> spiritual mean in gs hidden in the heart of the words.52
We are reminded of this notion when Bahá’u’lláh says, “Immerse yourselves in the ocean of My words,
that ye may unravel its secrets, and discover all the pearls of wisdom that lie hid in its depths.”53 These
hidden pearls of wisdom are likely the same as the mysteries noted in the Kitáb-i-ˆqán, “Thus will these
mysteries be unrave ll ed, not by the aid of acquired lear n in g, but solely through the assistance of God
and the outpour in gs of His grace.”54 ‘Abdu’l-Bahá reinforces the concept that the learning of words and
ideas is incomplete. “The Jews read the Old Testament night and day, memorizing its words and texts yet
without comprehending a single meaning or inner significance, for had they understood the real mean-
ings of the Old Testament, they would have become believers in Christ, inasmuch as the Old Testament
was revealed to prepare His com in g.”55 If we cannot gain true knowledge through learning what can we
do? Bahá’u’lláh notes, “The understanding of His words and the comprehension of the utterances of the
Birds of Heaven are in no wise dependent upon human learning. They depend solely upon purity of
heart, chastity of soul, and freedom of spirit.”56

As noted above, another important feature of the “mystic cup” is that its contents are frequently
referred to as a choice wine. Bahá’u’lláh makes repeated references to a symbolic wine that leads one who
partakes to true knowledge and understand in g.57 Furthermore, the concept that true knowledge involves
an experience that goes beyond words is reinforced as Bahá’u’lláh makes reference to this wine’s inebri-
ating effect.

> Were We to reveal the hidden secrets of that Day, all they that dwell on earth and in the heavens
> would swoon away and die, except such as will be preserved by God, the Almighty, the All-
> Know in g, the All-Wise. Such is the inebriating effect of the words of God upon Him Who is the
> Revealer of His undoubted proofs, that His Pen can move no longer.58
Bahá’u’lláh, while describing hidden secrets that would cause humankind to swoon and die, seems to
say that those same hidden secrets would have such an inebriating effect on Him that it would stop the
divine Pen. This would certainly tie in with the experiential nature of the mystical and would set forth
the possibility that God’s word can instill a sort of altered consciousness in somewhat the same manner
as alcohol or other mind altering drugs. In crude terms, what would be an overdose for a normal human
was only inebriating for Bahá’u’lláh. Does this “inebriating effect” come in weaker doses? Examine the
following excerpts from a prayer revealed by Bahá’u’lláh for the Bahá’í Fast:

> For Thine ardent lovers Thou hast, according to Thy decree, reserved at each daybreak, the cup
> of Thy remembrance, O Thou who art the ruler of rulers! These are they who have been so ine-
> briated with the wine of Thy manifold wisdom that they forsake their couches in their longing
> to celebrate Thy praise and extol Thy virtues….

> These are the ones, O my God, whom Thou hast graciously enabled to have fellowship with Thee
> and to commune with Him who is the Revealer of Thyself.59
Notice that these inebriated lovers arise to “commune” with Bahá’u’lláh. The spiritual addict flees his
couch to experience the regenerating power of the love of God. As Bahá’u’lláh states in another passage,
“by the fire of Thy love which drove sleep from the eyes of Thy chosen ones and Thy loved one.”60

Further reinforcing the experiential nature, often in the words of Bahá’u’lláh we see references to
achieving states of rapture and ecstasy. This Hidden Word reveals, “sweet is the holy ecstasy if thou

\[76\] The Mystic Cup

drinkest of the mystic chalice from the hands of the celestial Youth. Shouldst thou attain this station,
thou wouldst be freed from destruction and death, from toil and sin.”61 In the Kitáb-i-ˆqán Bahá’u’lláh
says of the true seeker, “Only when the lamp of search, of earnest striv in g, of longing desire, of pas-
sionate devotion, of fe rv id love, of rapture, and ecstasy, is kindled within the seeker’s heart, and the
breeze of His lov in g-kindness is wafted upon his soul...and the lights of knowledge and certitude envel-
op his being.” We attain knowledge and certitude after reaching a state of ecstasy and rapture. Then the
mystic Herald sounds the trumpet blast of knowledge which endows one with a new eye, a new ear, a
new heart and a new mind.” 62 Is this a knowledge of words and argument? Or, does this mystic Herald
impart a certitude reserved for mystic knowers that transcends words?

Consider this picture: There are powerful hidden secrets within the word of God which have the poten-
tial to not only completely overcome humans, but which can also effect a kind of inebriation in the
Manifestation. These hidden secrets are connected to the “wine of thy manifold wisdom,” which is like-
ly sim il ar to the wine of true understand in g, and these “wines” cause this state of inebriation. When
these hidden secrets are more modest in strength or kind their wine has a sim il ar impact on people. These
humans are “ardent lovers” who have somehow uncovered the “hidden secrets” which lead to this inebri-
ation. And as the Guardian noted in the letter regarding the true mysticism, these lovers have been
enabled to “commune with Him,” bringing them to a state of rapture and ecstasy. This mystical state of
communion is experiential, lies beyond words and utterance, and is at the heart of a spiritual transfor-
mation, which imparts a measure of true understanding and certitude to the ardent lovers.

Even more comp e ll in g, the Guardian makes clear that mystic transformation is also essential to the
evolution of society as a whole.

> That mystic, all-pervasive, yet indef in able change, which we associate with the stage of maturi-
> ty inevitable in the life of the individual and the development of the fruit must, if we would cor-
> rectly apprehend the utterances of Bahá’u’lláh, have its counterpart in the evolution of the orga-
> n iz ation of human society. A sim il ar stage must sooner or later be attained in the collective life
> of mankind, producing an even more striking phenomenon in world relations, and endowing the
> whole human race with such potentialities of well-being as shall provide, throughout the suc-
> ceeding ages, the chief incentive required for the eventual fulfillment of its high destiny.63
Consider the implications of this paragraph. Not only is there an indef in able or mystic change that
occurs in the individual, in effect, the Guardian is also saying that the Golden Age will occur only after
society as a whole undergoes some kind of mystical metamorphosis.64 Apparently this mystical connec-
tion is not simply for the individual but can somehow permeate an entire society in a spontaneous
organic manner. Shoghi Effendi refers to this collective “mystic change” as the stage of maturity, which
will provide the “chief incentive” for the eventual real iz ation of humanity’s high destiny. Exactly what
that means is can likely be grasped only after we better understand the mystic change of the individual.
Regardless, if we consider this global renewal and liken it to the profound and pervasive “mystic trans-
formation” which Bahá’u’lláh described in the ind iv idual,65 one can only speculate on the wonders before
humanity. Not to mention, even now, the Bahá’ís as a group expecting global transformation can ill
afford to ignore a process that appears to be intimately connected to that change.

Shoghi Effendi goes on to say that this mystic change will eventually produce a striking phenomenon
in society.66 In a previous quote, after stating that the cause relies “:solely on that mystic Source with
which no worldly advantage can compare,”67 he said, “that it propagates itself by ways mysterious and
utterly at variance with the standards accepted by mankind.” 68 The Guardian emphasizes that Bahá’u’lláh
has called into being “a new race of men.”69 The Blessed Beauty in another passage proclaimed, “The
world’s equilibrium hath been upset through the vibrating influence of this most great, this New World
Order. Mankind’s ordered life hath been revolutionized by the agency of this unique, this wondrous sys-
tem—the like of which mortal eyes hath never witnessed.”70

Is there an integral connection between the uniqueness of Bahá’u’lláh’s system and the mystical? After
saying that we are solely reliant on the mystic Source, Shoghi Effendi says that the cause propagates itself
in a manner that is not only mysterious but completely at variance with the norm.71 Complete reliance
on a mystic Source would be very different from accepted processes of social development. The

Guardian’s phrase “a new race of men”72 leads one to consider the “mystic transformation” 73 that estab-
lished totally new habits in the devout followers. Elsewhere, Bahá’u’lláh declares “a system the like of
which mortal eyes hath never witnessed,”74 then immediately broadcasts one of the more mystical con-
cepts in His Revelation, “Immerse yourselves in the ocean of my words, that ye may uncover all the
pearls of wisdom that lie hid in its depths.”75

Undoubtedly there is a reliance on the mystical in the Bahá’í Faith, but how often do we consider the
possibility that this reliance is of such magnitude that it dwarfs all other forces? Perhaps the uniqueness
of Bahá’u’lláh’s system is that it will use this mystic Source far more than in any other dispensation.
Perhaps in everything we do, whether it is teaching, adm in is t ration, or working for social justice—the
pr im ary driving force, perhaps the only effective driving force, is our mystical connection to
Bahá’u’lláh. Assuming this unique system depends completely on the mystical, is it too bold to ask, that
without a connection to this mystic Source, do we have anything that other non-Bahá’í segments of soci-
ety cannot provide? Recognizing that these prophecies of “new models of life,”76 “a new race of men,”77
and a system “the like of which mortal eyes hath never witnessed,”78 are more likely connected to a mys-
tic transformation than they are to the social principles of the Bahá’í Faith suggests that this mystic
Source and the transformation it inspires is the undeniable foundation upholding the Cause of
Bahá’u’lláh.

The theme of the mystic cup and its heavenly draught is interspersed through the Bahá’í sacred writ-
ings. Not only do we see the Báb, Bahá’u’lláh, and ‘Abdu’l-Báha enjoining seekers to partake of a mys-
tic cup or cup of certitude, but, there are numerous references to an immortal draught. Such a glorious
picture unfolds as we ponder the promise the Báb offered to His followers, “Blessed are they who drink
therefrom!”

After the fi rst believers in our Faith were entranced by an invitation to drink of the mystic cup, Nabíl
observed the Báb engaged in mystic communion with his Beloved and spoke of His use of a mystic la n-
guage with Quddus who was far away. Ba há’u’lláh points to the early believers of another age who after
imbibing from the “cup of certitude” u nderwent a “mystic transformation” in which “their agitation was
turned into peace, their doubt into certitude, their timidity into courage.” Shoghi Effendi asserts that “the
core of religious faith is the mystic feeling which unites man with God,” and that we are totally reliant on
that “mystic Source.” The Universal House of Justice encourages us to cultivate the mystic feeling. ‘Abdu’l-
Báhá directs us to dri nk of the mystic cup of heavenly love so we can partake of the love engendered by
the true mysticism. Even more interesting the Guardian writes of that “mystic, all-pervasive, yet i ndefin-
able change,” which is associated with the maturity of the individual and which wi ll have its counterpart
in the transformation and coming of age of the entire human race. And this coming of age is underscored
by ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s projection of world unity engendered by an ever brighter “mystic oneness.”

The queries this discussion raises are manifold. Precisely where does mysticism fit in as we develop
“new models of life?” What connection does this mystic feeling have to Bahá’í adm in is t ration, commu-
nity building and teac h in g? How can we expand our understanding of such things as mystic transforma-
tion, mystic language, mystic Source and all forms of spiritual communion? What can we do to cultivate
this “mystic feeling” as the Universal House of Justice has encouraged? How does Bahá’u’lláh teach mys-
ticism and what is involved in mystical endeavor as a Bahá’í? Complete answers to these and other ques-
tions are likely impossible at this early stage of Bahá’í development. However, if humankind is ever to
get the solutions, we must now begin a serious investigation at all levels—as institutions and as indi-
viduals. The fruits inspired by a search through the mystical ocean of Bahá’u’lláh’s Revelation could pro-
vide crucial assistance with elusive goals like spiritual transformation, building strong communities, the
perfecting of Bahá’í institutions, and for the ultimate goal of sweeping global change.
Furthermore, Bahá’u’lláh says,

> The purpose of the one true God, exalted be His glory, hath been to bring forth the Mystic Gems
> out of the mine of man—they Who are the Dawning-Places of His Cause and the repositories of
> the pearls of His knowledge.79

\[78\] The Mystic Cup

These Mystic Gems, the manifestations of God, are our mystic teachers. We have many opportunities
for material knowledge but the mystic knowledge comes only from Bahá’u’lláh. The Guardian noted that
the mystic feeling is central to developing spiritual virtues and powers.80 With these powers we will
change the material world—not the other way around.

In a religion whose watchword is unity this is the ultimate unity. Shoghi Effendi described it as that
“mystic feeling which unites man with God.”81 From this mystical unity all other unity flows. This unity
teaches all unity.82 For it there is no substitute. Let us revisit ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s prediction regarding this mys-
tic oneness:

> I beg of God to strengthen these spiritual bonds as day followeth day, and make this mystic one-
> ness to shine ever more brightly, until at last...spiritual relationships, will connect all the hearts
> of the world. Then will all humankind, because of this fresh and dazzling bounty, be gathered
> in a single homeland. Then will conflict and dissension vanish from the face of the earth, then
> will mankind be cradled in love for the beauty of the All-Glorious.83 [emphasis mine]

> Peace be upon him that inclineth his ear unto the melody of the Mystic Bird calling from the
Sadrat’l-Muntaha! Glorified be our Lord the Most High.

51) Word in this sense is sim il ar to the use of logos in John Chapter 1 of the Bible. Here the Word or logos first resides in

> the heaven and then becomes flesh as Christ. We see hints of this in Bahá’í Scripture when Bahá’u’lláh speaks of the
> Manifest and Luminous Point. This Point is sent forth from the “horizon of His Will.... This Point is the focal center

> most heart of the firmament of testimony and produced two Luminaries.” (Bahá’u’lláh, Tablets of Bahá’u’lláh, pp.
> 101–102) Also, upon examining the first verse describing the “stream of utterance” it is not clear if Bahá’u’lláh is refer-
> ring to the “stream” as causing this marvelous renewal or if it is the “sweet savours” coming from the Revelation. In the
> second passage it appears more likely that the stream of words reaches a certain stage and then the sweet savours of true
