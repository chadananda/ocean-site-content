i.~coherently expressed in the present account) that may be followed by those                  •non-Baha'i scholara' (i.e. the vast majority of all scholars who have ever 1i·1ed
who still retain their faith as well as by those who have doubts concerning it                 and who are alive today and who will ever live) by a standard to which they them-.

subject, were its anti-intellectualism and its quality of self-contained smugness,             'Baha'i scholar', it may be worth co:r.mentinc; on the picture drawn with s~ch
ever., if ! r.ay say so, of a=o&ance. The blatant contrast dravm bet.ween 'the                 broad strokes of' •the scholar of the 20th century•,
