## A Celestial Burning: A Selective Study of the Writings of Shoghi Effendi

### by [Jack McLean](https://bahai-library.com/author/Jack+McLean)

Baha’i Publishing Trust of India, 2012


> ### 1) About
> 
> This recently published work is a comprehensive study of selected writings of Shoghi Effendi Rabbani (1897-1957), the Guardian of the Baha’i Faith. The fruit of over a decade of meditation and careful research, the author has approached Shoghi Effendi’s writings from two main perspectives: The Guardian as the divine expounder, a wellspring of incisive and perspicuous religious thought, and Shoghi Effendi the eloquent writer, a vocation that was inseparable from his sacred office. This unique volume treats such themes as Shoghi Effendi’s view of history as divine drama, his effective use of rhetoric, his penetrating insights into morality and spirituality, and his understanding of the emerging world order as a modern-day apocalypse, and also the inimitable style and integral patterns that emerge in his epistolary prose. The breadth of research and the rich detail is a pleasure to peruse, and will surely absorb many readers, and help to inform not only scholars, but also those teachers, administrators, and general readers who seek a deeper appreciation of these aspects of the writings of the Guardian, and who may wish to develop them in their talks or publications.

1. INTRODUCTION AND PARAMETERS

A Celestial Burning

An Interdisciplinary Approach: Philosophical

Theology and Literary Criticism

This book is a selective analysis of the English language writings of Shoghi
Effendi (1897-1957), the former head and Guardian of the Bahá’í Faith.
His wife, companion and personal secretary, Hand of the Cause of God,
Madame Rúhíyyíh Rabbaní (née Mary Sutherland Maxwell, 1910-2000),
identifies Shoghi Effendi’s writings as one of four great accomplishments1
of his thirty-five year ministry (1922-1957).2 Within this literary heritage,
Madame Rabbaní identifies “... above all, a masterly orientation of thought
towards the concepts enshrined in the teachings of the Faith and orderly
classification of those teachings...”.3 In her judgment, the world order letter
of 1931 entitled The Goal of a New World Order demonstrated “...a new
mastery and assurance in its tone, [that] rises above the level of a letter to
co-workers in a common field and begins to reflect the extraordinary power
of exposition of thought that must characterize a great leader and a great
writer.”4 A Celestial Burning explores the content of this “masterly
orientation of thought” and the style of Shoghi Effendi the writer from the
dual perspective of philosophical theology and literary criticism.
Philosophical theology and literature derive from logos and mythos
respectively but, as word, share a common medium. This study also includes
some structural considerations of form which are intrinsic to any literary
work as an organic whole.

While the Guardian’s writings are the main focus, the following analysis
occasionally strays into considerations of the Báb’s, Bahá’u’lláh’s or
‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s writings, where they are pertinent. Although the Guardian’s
writings have been correlated to literary and theological scholarship, the
method of correlation being recommended by Shoghi Effendi himself
(see 5.B), no reductive treatment is found here as in some theoretical, secular
analysis of “Shoghi Effendi’s writings as literature.” To analyze the
Guardian’s writings strictly as literature, without recognizing the belief
and value system which frames and grounds them, would devitalise, if not
deform, their very foundation and the contents of this sacred literature itself.

An Interdisciplinary Approach: Philosophical Theology and Literary Criticism

Except for his great chronicle God Passes By (1944), which outlines
the events of the first century of the Bábí-Bahá’í Era (1844-1944), Shoghi
Effendi’s writings are largely epistolary, but he has expanded this genre to
include features that normally belong to more formal types of expository
writing such as the treatise5 or extended essay. The Guardian penned his
core works6 while executing the many onerous responsibilities of sacred
office, which included devising plans for the world-wide expansion of the
Bahá’í community and overseeing its complex, internal administrative
affairs. Consequently, while the Guardian’s writings may be analysed for
their intellectual, spiritual and artistic merit, it should be borne in mind that
they were not written primarily as works of art, but rather to provide
guidance, deepen the understanding, and to motivate the Bahá’í community
to accomplish the tasks he had set before it. In this sense, all the Guardian’s
writings are functional. Notwithstanding these practical functions, their
intellectual, spiritual and artistic merits deserve careful consideration.

Interdisciplinary Studies
While interdisciplinary studies seem to be experiencing a current lull,7
despite the initial enthusiasm which once greeted them, modern scholars
are increasingly producing works that answer the description of “blurred
genres,”8 to use the handy phrase of cultural anthropologist Clifford Geertz.
The French writer and literary critic Roland Barthes has reminded us in
“From Work to Text” that interdisciplinary studies break down the solidity
of old disciplines that were once hermetically sealed from one another and
create new perspectives, what he calls “...a new object and a new language.”:

Interdisciplinary activity, valued today as an important aspect of
research, cannot be accomplished by simple confrontations between various
specialized branches of knowledge. Interdisciplinary work is not a peaceful
operation: it begins effectively when the solidarity of the old disciplines
breaks down—a process made more violent, perhaps, by the jolts of
fashion—to the benefit of a new object and a new language, neither of
which is in the domain of those branches of knowledge that one calmly
sought to confront.9

While this study has not been undertaken for academic fashion’s sake,
it does follow a trend that moves beyond the strictures of one discipline
only, to embrace larger horizons of analysis. The multi-disciplinary approach
found increasingly in innovative scholarship today is creating new,

A Celestial Burning
interconnected perspectives among diverse fields of knowledge. As far back
as 1935, T. S. Eliot advocated the necessary cultivation of a certain dynamic
tension that ought to exist between literature and religion. In his essay
“Religion and Literature,” Eliot maintained that literature and literary
criticism should be supplemented with theology and ethics for their
completion. Although theology and literature are likely to remain separate
disciplines, much is to be gained from an interpenetration of the two fields,
an interpenetration that has already begun in earnest, as a steadily growing
literature attests.

Selection of the Material: Five Core Works
Five core works have been selected for study: (1) The Dispensation of
Bahá’u’lláh (1934)10 (2) The world order letters (1929-1936) published
as The World Order of Bahá’u’lláh (1938). (3) The Advent of Divine Justice
(1939) (4) The Promised Day is Come (1941) (5) God Passes By (1944).
The Guardian’s Epilogue to Nabil’s Narrative of the Dawn-Breakers has
also been considered in Chapter 10. In addition to these volumes,
references have been made throughout to various letters written either by
Shoghi Effendi or on his behalf to individuals or to local or national
communities.

These writings are the Guardian’s principal published works in English,
written in his own hand. Unlike the more than 26,000 answers to queries
from individuals, and local and national communities that were answered
through corresponding secretaries, not to mention his thousands of cables,11
these works remain self-standing, integral compositions.12 They will interest
all those who seek to understand the past or present history of the
Bábí-Bahá’í Faith, its belief and value system, its Weltanschauung, the
root causes of the grave conditions afflicting contemporary society, and
the remedies that Shoghi Effendi prescribes. While each of these five core
works consists of interrelated sub-themes, each one has an overall theme,
concept or “ideology.”13

Regarding the criteria used for the selection of topics in each of the
five volumes, this writer had to face l’embarras du choix, a dilemma that
was solved intuitively by following a more careful or “close reading”14 of
the text. In some cases, the themes or motifs discussed are central to the
work in question. In other cases, I have dilated on questions that some
readers might view as being minor or peripheral, but which struck me as
being significant. Since this book is not a thesis, but rather a more

An Interdisciplinary Approach: Philosophical Theology and Literary Criticism
wide-ranging, comprehensive study, no one particular angle, other than the
methodology selected, or narrow argument drives its contents. Many authors
have been selected and correlated to the Guardian’s writings, rather than
any particular school. Any critic of my methodology should keep in mind
the target audience for whom this book is intended: the thoughtful members
of the Bahá’í community and any member of the reading public who is
interested in furthering an intellectual and spiritual understanding of Shoghi
Effendi’s orientation of thought and literary art. Since selectivity by nature
must always be limited and subjective, I have no doubt neglected to do
justice to some major question or questions that deserve closer attention
than I have been able to give within the confines of this book. Such lacunae
will hopefully prompt other scholars to investigate those questions that I
have been unable to cover adequately in a one-volume study.

Correlation Between Bahá’í and Non-Bahá’í Thought
Correlation between Bahá’í and non-Bahá’í thought is a method specifically
recommended by Shoghi Effendi (See Chapter 5.B) and does not,
consequently, require justification. However, while engaging the non-Bahá’í
pole of the material, this study has served as a reference point to consider
wider theological, philosophical and literary issues. I recognize that some
of this material enlarges on the Guardian’s writings to an extent that the
purist would judge to be irrelevant. Be that as it may, the material presented
from non-Bahá’í authors has been chosen carefully to provide a larger
context, and to supplement and elucidate the ipsissima verba of Shoghi
Effendi. It should be borne in mind that this process is a two-way street. It
is not only true that historical, literary and theological scholarship, when
judiciously applied, casts further light on his thought, but it is also the case
that his writings, in addition to their specifically Bahá’í concerns—their
first order of business—offer his own perspective on a host of spiritual and
intellectual themes that have preoccupied modern writers. Scholarship, like
other forms of literature, must retain its outreaching, allusive quality.

English as the Language of Interpretation
Excluding hostile or prejudicial approaches, any analyst of Shoghi Effendi’s
writings becomes a de facto advocate. Such an advocate explains the writings
of the Guardian so that their thought-motifs may be better understood. One
of the reasons that led to the writing of A Celestial Burning was the
noticeable lack, aside from a few instructive articles,15 of any global

A Celestial Burning
treatment of the Guardian’s writings. How do we account for such scarcity
while studies of the Writings of the Báb and Bahá’u’lláh in light of their
Islamic antecedents are multiplying nicely? The still formative state of
Bahá’í scholarship may be the simplest explanation. But one has to infer a
general myopia resulting from our historical proximity to Shoghi Effendi,
a myopia that has blurred the full realisation of his several accomplishments,
literary or other.

One also suspects that familiarity has bred neglect. For some scholars,
the Guardian’s English-language writings may not hold the same
fascination as Persian and Arabic, the two languages of revelation of the
Bahá’í Faith, languages that possess outstanding literary qualities with
their fluid lyricism, moving power and eloquent authority. But although
he was an accomplished master of both Persian and Arabic, his two native
tongues, Ruhíyyíh Rabbaní writes that the Guardian put years of “careful
study” “...into mastering a language he loved and revelled in. For him
there was no second to English.”16 While for obvious historical reasons,
the Islamic background to the Guardian’s writings is clearly present,
particularly in his history of the first century of the Bábí-Bahá’í Faith,
God Passes By and in certain sections of The Promised Day is Come, in
which he accounts for the “falling fortunes of Shi’ih Islam,” because he
was writing in English, the Guardian’s expositions contain copious
references to western history and society, and religio-literary allusions to
the Judeo-Christian tradition. This is only fitting in light of his intended
community of believers/readers. A Celestial Burning has, consequently,
the biases of a western Bahá’í coming from a Judeo-Christian background
who read Christian theology and comparative religion at university and
who is also a poet.

Other implications arise for the field of Bahá’í studies. Since his core
works were written in English, English becomes the primary source
language for Shoghi Effendi studies. Consequently, the question of not
being proficient in Persian or Arabic, a point that is sometimes argued in
order to qualify an individual for doing serious Bahá’í studies—a very
doubtful notion as a generalisation—does not arise. For while mastery of
Persian and Arabic is de rigueur for scriptural study, and for studies of
the Guardian’s writings found in those languages, it is no less true that
English remains the language of interpretation in the Bahá’í Faith, since
the bulk of the Guardian’s writings are found in English, rather than
Persian or Arabic.

An Interdisciplinary Approach: Philosophical Theology and Literary Criticism

While the Guardian’s writings are vast, and include several fields,
Shoghi Effendi studies, as I see it, require some knowledge of English
literature and literary critical theory in its various aspects: a familiarity
with literary devices, principles of rhetoric and stylistics, the use of metaphor
and symbol, the place of narrative and drama. Certain notions of myth are
also helpful. Familiarity with the Judeo-Christian tradition would also be
required in order to afford an understanding of the many biblical allusions
that are interspersed throughout the Guardian’s writings, some of which
have been explored in this book. One can envisage, however, future more
ambitious studies that would compare and contrast the Guardian’s writings
in English with those in Persian or Arabic, studies that would yield, inter
alia, any common elements in Shoghi Effendi’s religious symbolism and/
or would sound out common or distinctive rhetorical patterns. Such a
prospect augurs well for the collaborative nature of interdisciplinary
multi-lingual studies.

The Biographical Aspect
While this book is not a biography, it does contain certain biographical
references to the life of Shoghi Effendi in order to place his writings within
a historical context. The New Critical approach to literature, now somewhat
dated, has it that textual study should exclude references to the author’s
personality, biographical considerations or any social or historical factors
that may have influenced the writing of the text. Such an approach is
unnecessarily restrictive and doctrinaire. However, A Celestial Burning is
above all a textual study and the biographical data that are included are
intended to supplement the text. Biographies supplemental to Rúhíyyih
Rabbaní’s seminal work The Priceless Pearl (1969) would be, of course,
extremely valuable. Riaz Khadem’s Shoghi Effendi in Oxford (1999), a
periodization study, provides some useful information regarding the
formative period in Shoghi Effendi’s life that immediately preceded his
appointment to the Guardianship, a period that helped to prepare him for
the onerous responsibilities which were suddenly thrust upon him at the
unexpected passing of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá on November 21, 1921.

Shoghi Effendi’s Writings and Contemporary Society
Advanced studies of Shoghi Effendi’s writings are needed to move
scholarship beyond the vital and still valuable concerns with the translation
and commentary of Bábí-Bahá’í scripture into the contemporary world of

A Celestial Burning
the twenty-first century and its current needs and preoccupations. The
Guardian’s writings are especially relevant to the Bahá’í Faith’s view of
the modern age since they address modernity’s grave crisis. The modern
Bahá’í Faith cannot be fully understood, nor conditions in the contemporary
world accurately assessed, and solutions offered, without recourse to Shoghi
Effendi. They are the sine qua non for a better understanding of the dilemmas
of modernity.

Authority of Letters Written on Behalf of Shoghi Effendi
While this volume studies mainly the holographic literature of the Guardian,
some letters written on his behalf are also included. It would be useful,
consequently, to clarify the authority of such letters. This question was
addressed in a Memorandum by the Research Department to the Universal
House of Justice of 13 October 1994.17 It was written in response to an
individual who had queried the reason for a statement by Mr. Phillip
Hainsworth in the introduction to The Unfolding Destiny of the British
Bahá’í Community: The Messages from the Guardian of the Bahá’í Faith
to the Bahá’í Community of the British Isles (1981). The editors of this
volume had decided to exclude both the names and letters written by
secretaries who “...had caused him much suffering.” and included only those
letters “...which carried the Guardian’s handwriting as a footnote or
contained words which indicated they were writing as instructed by him...”18
However, the Guardian made it clear in another communication that all
letters were read and approved by him before being sent from Haifa. In a
post scriptum to one such inquiry, Shoghi Effendi wrote: “I wish to add
and say that whatever letters are sent in my behalf from Haifa are all read
and approved by me before mailing. There is no exception whatever to this
rule.”19 This clarification was written in response to the question: “Can
you make a statement which would establish the authenticity of your letters
written by Ruhi or Soheil with P. C. [sic] attached. There are still some
people who continue to feel that these letters are not authorized by you and
only express the personal opinions of the above writers.”

The other extract written by the Guardian’s secretary, and quoted in
the Memorandum of the Research Department, establishes the authoritative
nature of letters written on behalf of Shoghi Effendi but makes a distinction
in terms of degrees of authority: “Although the secretaries of the Guardian
convey his thoughts and instructions and these messages are authoritative,
their words are in no sense the same as his, their style certainly not the

An Interdisciplinary Approach: Philosophical Theology and Literary Criticism
same, and their authority less, for they use their own terms and not his
exact words in conveying his messages.”20 The defining principle here would
seem to be that only the letters written under the signature of Shoghi Effendi
could carry the full authority of the Guardianship. But this does not mean,
as his response indicated, that the letters written on his behalf are not
authoritative, nor their accuracy questionable. The Memorandum of the
Research Department also states that in letters written on his behalf there is
no delegation of interpretive authority by Shoghi Effendi; i.e. any secretary
could not have been writing qua Guardian.

A biographical note from Rúhiyyíh Rabbaní gives a first person account
of this process when she first began serving as Shoghi Effendi’s
corresponding secretary in 1941. Her note reveals that the Guardian was
closely involved in the supervision of letters written on his behalf. Based
on Madame Rabbaní’s frequently repeated account, Violette Nakhjavání,
her friend and travelling companion, wrote:

In those early days of training, Shoghi Effendi would tell her exactly
what to write but when she showed him the finished letter he would take
one look at its length, tear it up, and say, “Be brief! Be brief!” She used to
say with a chuckle that she quickly learned her lesson. In the early years, he
would write down the points he wanted her to incorporate in pencil at the
bottom of the letter he had received, but later on, when he saw how well
she wrote, he would just tell her what to answer verbally. However, she
always stressed the fact that he read every single letter she wrote for him
before appending his own postscript.21

Present and Future Shoghi Effendi Studies
The approach that has been taken in this book is only one of several
approaches that will eventually be employed to gain a better understanding
of Shoghi Effendi’s extensive body of writing. Since the Guardian’s works
are multi-genred, wide-ranging and allusive, it only stands to reason that
present and future studies will delve more deeply into the historical, literary,
theological, spiritual, social and administrative issues that he raises, in
addition to the biographies that will be written. We all look eagerly forward
to the publication of such works.

2. SOME CORE WRITINGS

A. THE DISPENSATION OF BAHÁ’U’LLÁH: A

THEOLOGY OF THE WORD1

ABOUT THE TEXT

A Proactive Theological Document
In 1934 Shoghi Effendi wrote what he considered to be his preeminent
work, The Dispensation of Bahá’u’lláh. The Guardian describes “...the scope
and purpose...” of this document as “...an exposition of the fundamental
verities of the Faith.”2 This exposition clarifies the “station”3 of the “Three
Central Figures”4 and delineates the distinguishing features of the
Administrative or New World Order of Bahá’u’lláh. With the exception of
God Passes By, and like his other major works, the Dispensation is an
extended letter that became what Rúhíyyih Rabbaní has aptly described as
a “weighty treatise.”5 Madame Rabbaní’s comment indicates that this text
created a quantum leap in the intellectual and spiritual understanding of
the Bahá’í community. Her judgement echoes the impressions of any Bahá’í
who has carefully studied the Dispensation and underscores the importance
that Shoghi Effendi himself attached to this treatise:

> The weighty treatise known as The Dispensation of Bahá’u’lláh,
> written in 1934, burst upon the Bahá’ís like a blinding white light.
> I remember when I first read it I had the most extraordinary feeling
> as if the whole universe had suddenly expanded around me and I
> was looking out into a dazzling star-filled immensity; all the
> frontiers of our understanding flew outwards; the glory of this Cause
> and the true station of its Central Figures were revealed to us and
> we were never the same again. One would have thought that the
> stunning impact of this one communication from the Guardian
> would kill puniness of soul forever! However Shoghi Effendi felt
> in his inmost heart about his other writings, I know from his remarks
> that he considered he had said all he had to say, in many ways, in
the Dispensation.6

While the use of the once problematic word “theology” in the Bahá’í
community has largely gained acceptance, it was for some time viewed
with suspicion, mainly because of its priestly associations with monolithic
dogmatism and its long, divisive, often bloody doctrinal history that finds
echoes in the Latin phrase odium theologicum.7 Even though the word
theology is nowhere used in the Dispensation, it is clearly the only
appropriate qualifier to describe the overall “tenor”8 of this treatise,
particularly parts one to three (of four). Aside from other arguments that
could be made, the thorough-going theological content of the Dispensation
assures the legitimacy of theology on the Bahá’í academic curriculum.

William S. Hatcher in his paper “An Analysis of The Dispensation of
Bahá’u’lláh”9 makes one of the more helpful observations with the topic
sentence: “Rarely, if ever, have subtle and vexatious theological questions
been settled at an early stage in the history of a revealed religion.”10 One of
the outstanding features of the Dispensation has been its proactive role of
greatly strengthening both the doctrinal unity and understanding of the
Bahá’í Faith from the only appointed Interpreter/Expounder who has arisen,
or will arise, during its Formative Age. If we use Christianity as a point of
comparison, christology, which refers to the theology of the metaphysical
and ontological nature of Jesus Christ, was the very question that bedevilled
Christian theologians in the primitive church and fractured for all time
Christian unity. The creeds that ultimately defined the Christ-nature....

> ...underwent a long historical development that was not uncontested.
> They were finally elaborated in their present form after four
> centuries of acrimonious theological quarrelling that necessitated
> four [seven for the orthodox church] world councils of the church
> —those of Nicaea, Ephesus, Constantinople and Chalcedon—that
> brought in their wake bloody warfare11 among Christian factions.
> These christological controversies resulted in the fragmentation of
> the churches of Asia Minor from those of Greek Orthodox
> Constantinople, a fragmentation that has continued to this day.12

While this is not the place to enter into the details of the christological
controversies, we can retain from this lesson in church history a few
observations about the nature of theology that have been largely resolved
in The Dispensation of Bahá’u’lláh. Because of its close links to philosophy,
theology can be a very abstruse or speculative exercise with widely divergent
conclusions being drawn, however logically rigorous the argument.

A. The Ddispensation of Bahá’u’lláh: A Theology of the Word
‘Abdu’l-Bahá has rightly referred to “...the complex matters of religious
doctrine.”13 Difficult questions, to name only two from among a vast
selection, such as the ontological nature of the Godhead and the Divine
Manifestation, which are treated in the Dispensation, are not empirical
matters subject to easy scrutiny. The Guardian’s incisive understanding of
Bahá’í scripture, coupled with his authoritative interpretations, have placed
his theological definitions on an unassailable foundation. These words of
Bahá’u’lláh, as valid today as when they were written in 1861,14 aptly
describe both the state of theology and the practice of religion: “For opinions
have sorely differed, and the ways unto the attainment of God have
multiplied.”15 The Dispensation of Bahá’u’lláh has vastly reduced any
potential differences that might have arisen among Bahá’ís attempting to
understand such abstruse questions. Believers owe, consequently, a debt of
gratitude to Shoghi Effendi for having clearly established the doctrinal
foundations of such potentially vexing questions.

Inspiration and Inerrancy in the Guardianship
The requirements of a sound and true knowledge of Bahá’í history and
scripture, and the vital necessity of an irreproachable character befitting
the guardianship, have been met in the person of Shoghi Effendi. The
Guardian’s nomination by ‘Abdu’l-Bahá in His Will and Testament is fully
a divine appointment. While the Guardian’s writings are not divine
revelation, they carry the same authority. The Universal House of Justice
writes that the interpretations of Shoghi Effendi are “...equally binding as
the Text itself.”16 ‘Abdu’l-Bahá declared: “He is the Interpreter (mubáyyin)
of the Word of God....”17 He affirms further that the Guardian and the
Universal House of Justice “... are both under the care and protection of the
Abhá Beauty, under the shelter and unerring guidance of the Exalted One
(may my life be offered up for them both).”18 Both Shoghi Effendi’s
appointment and his interpretations have the highest authority and inspire,
consequently, great confidence.

The terms “inspiration” and “inerrancy” need some clarification
vis-à-vis the Guardian’s writings. Holy scripture, as has also been said of
all great artistic or literary works, is inspired by God. (Lat. inspiro, in+spiro,
breathe in). While Shoghi Effendi’s writings are not scripture, the same
divine afflatus that inspires scripture also pervades his writings and
interpretations. Inerrancy, at least in Christendom, is a more modern and
polemical concept, dating from the nineteenth century. While biblical

fundamentalists have used this concept in a reductive “...separative and
polemical way...,”19 the basic idea that sacred scripture is both truthful and
protected from error is fully supported in the Bahá’í Faith. The same
affirmation applies to the writings of Shoghi Effendi. However, the
Guardian’s conferred infallibility was limited to those spheres which he
has himself defined. The most comprehensive statement on the Guardian’s
infallibility is the following from the Universal House of justice. It takes
up Shoghi Effendi’s own reply to this question:

“Shoghi Effendi was asked several times during his ministry to define
the sphere of his operation and his infallibility. The replies he gave and
which were written on his behalf are most illuminating. He explains that he
is not an infallible authority on subjects such as economics and science,
nor does he go into technical matters since his infallibility is confined to
‘matters which are related strictly to the Cause’. He further points out that
‘he is not, like the Prophet, omniscient at will’, that his ‘infallibility covers
interpretation of the Revealed Word and its application’, and that he is also
‘infallible in the protection of the Faith’. Furthermore, in one of the letters,
the following guideline is set forth:

“‘...It is not for individual believers to limit the sphere of the Guardian’s
authority, or to judge when they have to obey the Guardian and when they
are free to reject his judgment. Such an attitude would evidently lead to
confusion and to schism. The Guardian being the appointed interpreter of
the Teachings, it is his responsibility to state what matters which, affecting
the interests of the Faith, demand on the part of the believers, complete and
unqualified obedience to his instructions.’”20

The commonsensical understanding of the sentence “It is not for
individual believers to limit the sphere of the Guardian’s authority...” is
not, of course, a contradiction that extends the authority of the guardianship
to all matters. It refers to those areas of authority, and exclusions, that Shoghi
Effendi has himself already defined. However, we must exclude from the
definition of infallibility any pretension that would exempt the Guardian
from making factual errors. On those matters of fact that appear in the
historical subjects he treated, or in the letters he wrote, Shoghi Effendi was
dependent upon the accuracy of the documents and sources and information
available to him. In sum, the Guardian has clarified ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s
statement of “unerring guidance” to mean that in matters of doctrine, and
in the application of the Bahá’í teachings, which obviously included any

A. The Ddispensation of Bahá’u’lláh: A Theology of the Word
moral definitions or rulings, in the execution of the Divine Plan and the
protection of the Faith, he was infallible. This does not mean, as he himself
has pointed out (see “Hermeneutical Pointers” below), that his conferred
infallibility confers a station co-equal to that of those whose words he had
been appointed to interpret.

Elegant Form: “Less is More”
On first reading—and this point has also been made by William Hatcher21—
one can be fooled by a certain deceptive simplicity of the Dispensation.
Readers of academic theology are accustomed to dense text, learned
references, and sometimes obfuscation rather than clarification, obfuscation
that can lead to misunderstanding, generated by internal contradiction,
ambiguity or simple error. In contemporary Christian theology, the trend
has been toward increasingly novel, provocative and sometimes far-fetched
theses that have moved farther and farther away from scriptural roots.
Theology, like literary criticism, has become an end in itself, a discourse of
its own making. But the mind that constructs its argument throughout the
Dispensation is moving and lucid, the logic incisive and compelling, the
style admirable, its scriptural grounding solid. The neat, quotable saying,
attributed variously to the poet Robert Browning, the American architect
Philip Johnson and the famous German modernist, minimalist architect
Mies van der Rohe, comes to mind as an apt descriptor of the Dispensation—
“Less is more.”22 Dr. Hatcher writes:

> Thus, at least at first glance, the structure of The Dispensation of
> Bahá’u’lláh appears to be extremely simple and straightforward.
> However, this initial impression is quickly dispelled by the power
> and density of Shoghi Effendi’s writing, by the number and
> complexity of the themes treated in the course of the exposition,
> by the abundant citations from both Bahá’í and non-Bahá’í sources,
> and finally the frequent and sometimes subtle literary and historical
allusions.23

With this document, and this is true for each of the Guardian’s letters,
every sentence, every phrase, indeed each individual word, has been
carefully selected to convey the author’s thought. Just as in physics a plenum
is space filled with matter, Shoghi Effendi’s literary space, while it allows
room for further reflection, contains a plenum of significance. The
Guardian’s exposition maximizes the meaning with a minimum of words.

As mentioned above, the structure of the Dispensation consists of a
four part division of some sixty odd pages. The bulk of the text,
approximately three quarters, is devoted to an exposition of the rank,
nature and function of what the Guardian calls the “Three Central
Figures”of the Bahá’í Faith. This key phrase, the “Three Central
Figures,” has come to form one of the basics of Bahá’í vocabulary, as
does his use of the word “station,” the closest English equivalent to the
Persian-Arabic maqám. In a larger sense, one of the great contributions
of the Guardian’s writings is to have created a specialised language of
discourse which reflects The Bahá’í World-view without which no world
religion can function effectively. In addition, Shoghi Effendi’s writings,
with their wealth of contemporary insights, have carried the Bahá’í Faith
forward into the stream of the twentieth and twenty first centuries, and
with their forward-looking vision, they anticipate future world
developments as humanity inches painfully toward “...the consummation
of all ages, which must signalize the coming of age of the entire human
race...”24

The Guardian reverses the chronological order of the Three Central
Figures by presenting the orthodox understanding of Bahá’u’lláh’s
station first. This is no doubt an indication that the Guardian wishes
to emphasize the supreme station of the Promised One of all ages:
“Dominating the entire range of this fascinating spectacle towers the
incomparable figure of Bahá’u’lláh, transcendental in His majesty,
serene, awe inspiring, unapproachably glorious.” 25 Aside from the
careful theological elucidations that follow, the descriptive power of
this one sentence alone succinctly captures the heavenly majesty of
the Persian Prince. Moreover, Shoghi Effendi’s short descriptions of
the Three Central Figures weds descriptive power to discursive
theology. Consider this word picture of Bahá’u’lláh’s herald, the Báb:

> “Allied, though subordinate in rank, and invested with the
> authority of presiding with Him over the destinies of this
> supreme Dispensation, there shines upon this mental picture
> the youthful glory of the Báb, infinite in His tenderness,
> irresistible in His charm, unsurpassed in His heroism,
> matchless in the dramatic circumstances of His short yet
> eventful life.” 26
The same is true of this partial description of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá:

A. The Ddispensation of Bahá’u’lláh: A Theology of the Word
> “He is, and should for all time be regarded, first and foremost, as
> the Center and Pivot of Bahá’u’lláh’s peerless and all enfolding
> Covenant, His most exalted handiwork, the stainless Mirror of His
> light, the perfect Exemplar of His teachings, the unerring Interpreter
> of His Word, the embodiment of every Bahá’í ideal, the incarnation
> of every Bahá’í virtue, the Most Mighty Branch sprung from the
> Ancient Root, the Limb of the Law of God, the Being “round Whom
> all names revolve,” the Mainspring of the Oneness of Humanity,
> the Ensign of the Most Great Peace, the Moon of the Central Orb
> of this most holy Dispensation—styles and titles that are implicit
> and find their truest, their highest and fairest expression in the
> magic name ‘Abdu’l-Bahá.”27

HISTORY, TEXT AND THEOLOGY
Creating Historical Consciousness
As in all of the Guardian’s compositions, the introduction, a six paragraph
section, should not be passed over lightly. It reveals Shoghi Effendi’s à
propos sense of the dramatic unfolding of the current events of Bahá’í
history as “its march” gathers momentum:

> “To the beloved of God and the handmaids of the Merciful
> throughout the West.

> Fellow laborers in the Divine Vineyard:
> On the 23rd of May of this auspicious year The Bahá’í World will
celebrate the 90th anniversary of the founding of the Faith of Bahá’u’lláh.
We, who at this hour find ourselves standing on the threshold of the last
decade of the first century of the Bahá’í era, might well pause to reflect
upon the mysterious dispensations of so august, so momentous a Revelation.
How vast, how entrancing the panorama which the revolution of four score
years and ten unrolls before our eyes! Its towering grandeur well nigh
overwhelms us. To merely contemplate this unique spectacle, to visualize,
however dimly, the circumstances attending the birth and gradual
unfoldment of this supreme Theophany, to recall even in their barest outline
the woeful struggles that proclaimed its rise and accelerated its march,
will suffice to convince every unbiased observer of those eternal truths
that motivate its life and which must continue to impel it forward until it
achieves its destined ascendancy.”28

A sense of exaltation sustains the historical retrospective. Shoghi
Effendi, and the reader with him, are awed by the succession of moving
events that have taken place over these ninety years: “How vast, how
entrancing the panorama which the revolution of four score years and ten
unrolls before our eyes! Its towering grandeur well nigh overwhelms us.”
But we are not merely moved. We are also moved to conviction. The events
which have already unfolded “...will suffice to convince every unbiased
observer...”of the Faith’s spiritual vitality and ultimate future success. In
“...the woeful struggles that proclaimed its rise...,” we find a recurring theme:
crisis leads to victory; adversity is the oil that fans the flame of God’s
Cause.

It is characteristic of Shoghi Effendi’s sense of the auspicious passing
of Bahá’í history to pause for a timely retrospective. This retrospective,
usually made on an anniversary or holy day, provides the occasion for an
evaluation or a summing up of the events that have carried the Bahá’í Faith
into the present. In 1934, as the passing years approached the centenary of
the Declaration of the Báb ten years later (1944), the Guardian engaged his
readers in a review of the previous ninety years. This period is viewed as
one of remarkable achievements. The successes won are based upon two
major factors that become cornerstones in his view of history: (1) any present
accomplishments are built upon the solid achievements of the past. (2) any
successful movement in history must be grounded in divine truth. His faith
in the ultimate ascendancy of the Bahá’í Cause is based upon a firm
conviction that the movement has taken root in the fertile soil of what the
Greek fathers of the apostolic church called the logos spermatikos29 which
described the fecundating power of the Holy Word. Seed imagery is not, of
course, exclusive to the Christian tradition. In the Persian Bayán, the Báb
writes: “Today the Bayán is in the stage of seed; at the beginning of the
manifestation of ‘Him Whom God shall make manifest’ its ultimate
perfection will become apparent....”30 Shoghi Effendi makes use of this
seed imagery to indicate evolution or gradation, in a process of gradual
unfoldment with respect to the Three Ages of the Bábí-Bahá’í Faith: “The
period in which the seed of the Faith had been slowly germinating [Heroic
Age] is thus intertwined both with the one which must witness its
efflorescence [Formative Age] and the subsequent age in which that seed
will have finally yielded its golden fruit.” [Golden Age].31

As mentioned above, while engaging in this backward glance, the
Guardian assures his readers that the events that have transpired within the

A. The Ddispensation of Bahá’u’lláh: A Theology of the Word
90 year period are a sufficient guarantee of any future successes that the
Faith will achieve:

> “...to visualize, however dimly, the circumstances attending the birth
> and gradual unfoldment of this supreme Theophany... will suffice
> to convince every unbiased observer of those eternal truths that
> motivate its life and which must continue to impel it forward until
> it achieves its destined ascendancy.”32

Periodization
Shoghi Effendi reminds his readers that particularly with the passing of
Bahíyyih Khánum (1932), the sister of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, and his own beloved
great-aunt, “the most Exalted Leaf ”33.... “...the well beloved and treasured
Remnant of Bahá’u’lláh...,”34 Shoghi Effendi in his tribute of July 17, 1932
to the Bahá’ís of North America announcing the passing of Bahíyyih
Khánum. Bahá’í Administration, p. 187, that the First Great Age had drawn
to a close:

> “...there draws to a close the first and most moving chapter of
> Bahá’í history, marking the conclusion of the Primitive, the
> Apostolic Age of the Faith of Bahá’u’lláh. It was ‘Abdu’l-Bahá
> Who, through the provisions of His weighty Will and Testament,
> has forged the vital link which must for ever connect the age that
> has just expired with the one we now live in—the Transitional and
> Formative period of the Faith—a stage that must in the fullness of
> time reach its blossom and yield its fruit in the exploits and triumphs
> that are to herald the Golden Age of the Revelation of
Bahá’u’lláh.”35

With this statement, periodization, a basic technique of historiography,
is assigned to Bahá’í history, supplying a necessary gage by which Bahá’ís
may situate themselves within the temporal flux of their dispensation.
Periodization serves two useful purposes: (1) It allows for the significant
assessment of past events in order to better understand their import. (2) It
sensitizes to the importance of the present moment and to the necessity of
seizing present opportunities since they in turn will become the “stuff of
history”. If we correlate the Dispensation to God Passes By (1944), we
find that the Guardian devotes a not inconsiderable portion of the Foreword
of the latter work to the establishment of periodization (pp. xiii-xvi). There
he varies somewhat the nomenclature assigned to the divisions of time.

The second age is called “...the Formative, the Transitional,” or “Iron Age.”36
(The added designation is Iron Age). In addition to these divisions, Shoghi
Effendi assigns to the first century of the Bahá’í Era (1844-1944) four
proper “periods” which I have compressed from God Passes By: (1) (1844
1853). This period centers in the person of the Martyr-Herald, the Báb,
from the time of His declaration which witnessed the massacre of upwards
of 20,000 Bábís by the combined forces of the Persian church-state. (2)
(1853 1892). This period centers in “the august figure of Bahá’u’lláh” from
the time of the dawning of Bahá’u’lláh’s messianic consciousness in the
“stygian gloom” of the Síyáh-Chál of Tihran in the ninth and final year of
the Báb’s dispensation. This period witnessed the proclamation and
expansion of the new faith which aroused the implacable opposition of two
oriental potentates as well as the Sunni and Shiite ecclesiastical hierarchies.
It ends with the ascension of Bahá’u’lláh. (3) (1892 1921). This period
“revolves around the vibrant personality of ‘Abdu’l Bahá” and witnessed
the establishment of the Covenant and the first implantation of the Faith of
Bahá’u’lláh in North America and the four corners of the world. It ended
with the ascension of ‘Abdu’l Bahá. (4) (1921-1944). This period witnessed
“...the birth of the Formative Age of the Bahá’í Era” and the establishment
of the Administrative Order which is “... at once the harbinger, the nucleus
and pattern of His World Order.” The pattern of opposition and hostility,
although less intense, continued during this period but led to the further
emancipation and recognition of the Bahá’í Faith throughout the five
continents of the globe.

In addition to assigning periods and ages, the Guardian has also
subdivided these ages into epochs. The Universal House of Justice
determined, in its message of 16 January 2001 to the Bahá’ís of the world,
that they were entering the fifth epoch of the Formative Age.37 While it is
beyond the scope of this study to give a detailed account of the determination
of these epochs,38 one must bear in mind the following point in order to
avoid confusion. A two-track chronology of epochs is unfolding
concurrently. While each of the Three Great Ages of the Bahá’í Faith is
subdivided into epochs, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s Divine Plan, as contained in the
Tablets of the Divine Plan to the North American Bahá’ís (1916-1917),
inaugurated another series of epochs.39 The dates of the first epoch of this
Divine Plan are 1937-1963, corresponding to the inception of the First Seven
Year Plan (1937-1944) and concluding with the Ten Year World Crusade/
Plan (1953-1963). In the year 2007, the Bahá’ís are in the second epoch of

‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s Divine Plan, begun in 1964 with the Nine Year Plan of the
Universal House of Justice.

Historical Process: Evolution, Order and Holism
Coupled with assigning periods and epochs, and while drawing attention
to the signal accomplishments of each one, Shoghi Effendi’s schema reflects
a particular understanding of Bahá’í history: an orderly, holistic and
evolutionary growth that drives toward self-fulfilment. Regarding the first
Bahá’í century (1844-1944) Shoghi Effendi remarks:

> “To isolate any one of them from the others, to dissociate the later
> manifestations of one universal, all embracing Revelation from
> the pristine purpose that animated it in its earliest days, would be
> tantamount to a mutilation of the structure on which it rests, and to
> a lamentable perversion of its truth and of its history.... These four
> periods are to be regarded not only as the component, the
> inseparable parts of one stupendous whole, but as progressive
> stages in a single evolutionary process, vast, steady and irresistible.
> For as we survey the entire range which the operation of a century
> old Faith has unfolded before us, we cannot escape the conclusion
> that from whatever angle we view this colossal scene, the events
> associated with these periods present to us unmistakable evidences
> of a slowly maturing process, of an orderly development, of internal
> consolidation, of external expansion, of a gradual emancipation
> from the fetters of religious orthodoxy, and of a corresponding
diminution of civil disabilities and restrictions.”40

A vital link has connected these periods. As was reported above, the
Will and Testament of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá “...has forged the vital link which must
for ever connect the age that has just expired [Primitive/Apostolic/Heroic
Age] with the one we now live in—the Transitional and Formative period
of the Faith....”41 The forces latent within the Twin Manifestations of the
Báb and Bahá’u’lláh, released into the world in 1844, continue to be diffused
as the Formative Age of the Bahá’í Dispensation gradually unfolds:

> “Dearly beloved friends! The onrushing forces so miraculously
> released through the agency of two independent and swiftly
> successive Manifestations are now under our very eyes and through
> the care of the chosen stewards of a far flung Faith being gradually
mustered and disciplined. They are slowly crystallizing into

> institutions that will come to be regarded as the hall mark and
> glory of the age we are called upon to establish and by our deeds
> immortalize. For upon our present day efforts, and above all upon
> the extent to which we strive to remodel our lives after the pattern
> of sublime heroism associated with those gone before us, must
> depend the efficacy of the instruments we now fashion- instruments
> that must erect the structure of that blissful Commonwealth which
> must signalize the Golden Age of our Faith.”42

In Shoghi Effendi’s view of history, then, there can be no real separation
of past, present and future. As the above passage also makes clear, it is the
Bahá’ís themselves who must shape the events and build the institutions of
the present and future generations. To be successful, this historical process
must depend on the universal participation of ordinary believers without
which capital and resources, policies and plans, and the influence of brilliant
personalities and competent teachers will not be fully effective. The
providential history of the New Tomorrow will be written and told with
sacrificial deeds and credible moral fibre to the extent that the Bahá’ís will
be inspired and will emulate the extraordinary role models that have gone
before them. For the “people of Bahá” (Ahl-i-Bahá) are themselves the
stuff of history.

To return to the holistic, that is, interconnected wholeness of the periods
in Bahá’í history, and to the influence of the past on the present, this one
great continuum of all history has been addressed in my essay “The
Metaphysics of History and Fine Art” in Under the Divine Lote Tree: Essays
and Reflections (1999):

> All history radiates onward as one flowing stream of spiritual
> energy, as fluctuations of a wave...One speaks, for example, of
> “the dead weight of the past” as if past events were buried and
> inert. But the paradox of history is one that makes the past both
> dead and alive. History is dead in the sense that the self-same event
> can never be relived exactly as it was. But it remains alive and
> moving in the major events that shape the present age and in the
> everyday gestures of individuals as well as in the life of nations.
> History is alive in the present tense of current events and in
> individual lives, for the happenings of the past, for well or ill,
> perpetuate themselves into the present and have to a great extent
determined what we are doing now.43

The Introduction: Judeo-Christian Allusions
Three expressions in particular indicate that Shoghi Effendi was fully
conscious of the Judeo-Christian background of his readers: “Fellow
laborers in the Divine Vineyard,” “...the revolution of four score years and
ten...” and “...supreme Theophany...” Of these, the first and the third are
significant and invite brief comment. The second elevates the tone of the
passage and lends a certain scriptural ambiance to the exposition.
(a) “Fellow laborers in the Divine Vineyard:”
This phrase or its variation, “fellow-workers in the Divine Vineyard,” is
found in the salutation of a number of communications to western believers.
What are some of its scriptural allusions? The vine or vineyard is one of
the most ancient metaphors that runs through both the Hebrew Bible and
the Gospel. This salutation has scores of scriptural antecedents and a literary
history that is grounded both in scripture and the agricultural practices of
the ancient Middle East. We encounter it first in the Book of Genesis with
the prophet Noah: “And Noah began to be a husbandman and he planted a
vineyard:” (9:20). The vineyard is used by Jesus as the setting for his three
parables of the kingdom: Matthew 20:1-16 (God is just and does as He
wills), Matthew 21: 33-44 (the wicked husbandmen are punished by the
lord of the vineyard for slaying his son/heir and he gives it as an inheritance
to others), Mark 12:1-11 which is equivalent to the parable in Matthew.
Luke 20:9-18 is another equivalent to Matthew 21 and Mark 12.

It is noteworthy that ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s interpretation of Matthew 21:33-44

identifies the slaying of the son, the heir of the Lord of the Vineyard, as
foretelling the nefarious activities of the covenant-breakers against Himself
which defines the entire context of “The Master’s Last Tablet to America.”
‘Abdu’l-Bahá wrote: “And in the 21st chapter and 38th verse of the Gospel
of Matthew, He says: “But when the husbandmen saw the son, they said
among themselves, this is the heir, come let us kill him and let us seize on
his inheritance. And they caught him and cast him out of the vineyard and
slew him.”44 ‘Abdu’l-Bahá is clearly referring to Himself as the rightful
heir to Bahá’u’lláh (the Lord of the Vineyard) and to His covenant which
occasioned the implacable opposition of the covenant-breakers at the very
moment He was composing the tablet.

While the parables of Jesus have multiple meanings, the moral of the
parable of the Lord of the Vineyard is faithfulness to the Covenant; the
workers in the vineyard (the believers in each dispensation) must be faithful

to the Lord of the Vineyard (the Divine Manifestation) by accepting his
heirs or successors (successive Manifestations or appointees) when they
appear. Otherwise they lose their spiritual birthright and find themselves in
great loss. However, Shoghi Effendi actually did locate “the vineyard of
God” in space-time, thus giving it a more literal, concrete interpretation.
He identified “the vineyard of God” with Mt. Carmel where the shrines of
the Báb and ‘Abdu’l-Bahá and the world administrative center of the Bahá’í
Faith are located.45 Thus the layers of spiritual meaning in the parable have
a corresponding counterpart in the physical presence of the true “Garden
of God” located in space-time.

Shoghi Effendi regarded himself as one of many “Fellow-laborers” in
the Divine Vincyard. The italicized phrase indicates, moreover, that the
Guardian viewed service to the Bahá’í Faith as a work ethic. In many of his
letters he refers to “the work of the Cause.”46 Now labour is purposeful and
dedicated work involving strenuous effort, the dispensing of the energies
of body and spirit. Labour in its biblical sense referred to either physical or
mental toil47 and this attitude is quite concordant with Shoghi Effendi’s
sense of working in the divine vineyard of the new dispensation. Just as the
vine was a symbol of the nation of Israel and of Christ as “the true vine,”48
the vineyard here is a metonym for the Bahá’í Faith itself and its “field” of
service. Viticulture was the most labour-intensive of all agricultural activities
in the ancient Near East and involved several onerous operations (tillage,
fencing, construction of the watchtower, surveillance, harvesting, pressing,
etc.). The vineyard is consequently a particularly fitting metaphor to describe
the execution of the many activities involved in the “external expansion”
and “internal consolidation”49 of the Bahá’í Faith which was always the
Guardian’s preeminent concern.
(b) “...supreme Theophany...”
With the word theophany (zuhúr) the reader is placed directly into, not
only a Judeo-Christian-Islamic theological context, but also one that is
central to the Bahá’í Faith itself; that of manifestation theology, succinctly
dubbed “theophanology” by Juan Cole in his instructive monograph “The
Concept of Manifestation in the Bahá’í Writings”(1982),50 a study that
examines this central concept in light of Islamic religious traditions and
Greek and Hellenistic philosophy. Curiously, Cole’s study makes no
reference to Shoghi Effendi’s mention of a “...supreme Theophany...,” but
it is clear that the Guardian is drawing on a central theological concept that

has a historical and phenomenological commonality with its sister
Abrahamic religions.51 A theophany (Gk. theo + phainomai,to appear) is a
manifestation of God (small m) and both divine manifestation and theophany
are closely related.52 Theophany signifies the presence of God and divine
guidance. In biblical terms, a theophany may take on either human or non-
human form and assumes either temporary or permanent aspects. Samuel
A. Meier defines it simply as “A deity’s physical manifestation that is seen
by human beings.”53 Voices, dreams, angelic visitations, even earthquakes
and thunderstorms are all theophanic events through which the voice of
God speaks. In the Mosaic dispensation, the most outstanding examples of
theophanies occurred when Yahweh, the Angel of the Lord, spoke from
within the Burning Bush (Ex. 3:2-3), in the Pillar of a Cloud by day (Ex.
13:21) and the Pillar of Fire by night (Ex. 13:21). These were the
unmistakable signs of guidance to the Israelites in the wilderness.
Theophanic visitation came also in the manifestation of Yahweh, the Angel
of the Lord, speaking to Moses in “thunders and lightnings, and a thick
cloud upon the mount” (Ex. 19:16) and in smoke and fire atop Mt. Sinai.
(Ex. 19:18).

Fleeing the wrath of the Phoenician queen Jezebel, who had vowed to
take his life, and looking for consolation in signs from God on Mt. Horeb
(Sinai), the prophet Elijah finds that the... “but the Lord was not in the fire:
and after the fire a still small voice.”54 In Pauline theology, theophany signifies
the incarnation of Christ, the belief that “For in him the whole fulness of
deity dwells bodily” (Co. 2:9, cf. 2 Cor. 5:19, Col. 1:15), a heterodox teaching
for Bahá’ís. There is an indication in the Mosaic dispensation of a greater
theophany to come. While it is stated in Numbers 12:8 that Moses spoke
with God “mouth to mouth” and in Deuteronomy 34:10 that Moses was the
prophet “whom the Lord knew face to face,” nonetheless the Pentateuch
contains seemingly contradictory statements. Exodus 33:20 reads: “Thou
canst not see my face: for there shall no man see me, and live.” and v. 23
states that “thou shalt see my back parts: but my face shall not be seen.” In v.
18, Moses beseeches God “...show me thy glory.”

In its most concrete, personal and consequential sense, a theophany
refers to God’s Presence indwelling (not incarnating) a prophetic figure
or Divine Manifestation (mazhár-i-iláhí) who appears on earth “...in the
noble form of the human temple...”55 as Bahá’u’lláh says. A Manifestation
of God indicates the Presence of God among men, that God “will dwell
in the midst of thee [Israel]” (Zech. 2:10). The gradual passage from earlier,

more spectacular, nature-based theophanies to the indwelling Presence
of God found in the Prophet is, in any case, the biblical pattern. The
Divine Manifestation/Prophet indwelling the human temple is the
apotheosis of theophany.

The Station of Bahá’u’lláh: Caution Against Triumphalism
The qualifying adjective in “supreme Theophany” is, of course, a superlative.
Its selection by Shoghi Effendi is based upon a well-considered theological
value-judgment that has been made following his understanding of scripture.
But the Guardian warns the Bahá’ís not to fall into the trap of an overly
triumphalistic theology. The fuller disclosure of divine power at this time
in history, the much brighter intensity of the divine light, should not be
taken as indication of any moral or spiritual superiority of the Bahá’í Faith
over the great world religions of the past. While Shoghi Effendi unabashedly
expatiates on “...the incomparable greatness of the Revelation...”56 “...as
the culmination of a cycle, the final stage in a series of successive, of
preliminary and progressive revelations...”57 that have found their fulfilment
in “...that Day of Days in which He Who is the Promise of All Ages should
be made manifest...,”58 he nonetheless cautions against any unbalanced,
separative approach. For such an approach would be, not only morally
untenable, but theologically incorrect and the Guardian feels moved to issue
his own “...word of warning....”59 Shoghi Effendi’s admonition concerns
both the station of Bahá’u’lláh vis-à-vis the Divinity and the relationship
of the Bahá’í Faith to the religions of the past. Concerning the station of
Bahá’u’lláh, the Guardian writes:

> “That Bahá’u’lláh should, notwithstanding the overwhelming
> intensity of His Revelation, be regarded as essentially one of these
> Manifestations of God, never to be identified with that invisible
> Reality, the Essence of Divinity itself, is one of the major beliefs
> of our Faith—a belief which should never be obscured and the
> integrity of which no one of its followers should allow to be
> compromised.”60

Regarding the relationship between the Bahá’í Faith and the
religions of the past, the Guardian has written the following magesterial
statement that constitutes a veritable seedbed of a theology of the great
world religions, a theology that has yet to be written. And here I must
content myself simply with citation:

> “Nor does the Bahá’í Revelation, claiming as it does to be the
> culmination of a prophetic cycle and the fulfillment of the promise
> of all ages, attempt, under any circumstances, to invalidate those
> first and everlasting principles that animate and underlie the

Lest We Forget: The Station of the Báb
Due to considerations of space, I have had to content myself with the few
comments above on Shoghi Effendi’s treatment of the station of Bahá’u’lláh.
Here I offer a few observations on the Guardian’s great contribution to
securing the place of the Báb in Bahá’í history. While taking the
Dispensation into consideration, I am going beyond it to consider some
basic and well-known facts but whose historical significance needs to be
sharpened. Early on in the Formative Age of the Bahá’í Faith (1921/1932-),62
the Guardian was solely responsible for clarifying the station of the Báb in
light of His own claims and those statements contained in the writings of
Bahá’u’lláh and ‘Abdu’l-Bahá. He greatly heightened our consciousness

of the Báb, His mission and His station in the following ways: (1) by
completing the superstructure over the shrine of the Báb and thus enshrining
the sacred memory of His presence on earth. (2) by translating Nabil’s
Narrative, the dramatic history of the tumultuous days of the Bábí
dispensation (1844-1853). (3) by clarifying the station of the Báb in the
Dispensation and by translating certain passages of His writings.

Completing the Holy Shrine63
The unique shrine flanking Mt. Carmel that, in Richard St. Barbe Baker’s
lovely phrase, “rose over Haifa like a sun”64 on the ninth day of Ridván
during Holy Year 1953, had been completed only after more than a half
century of arduous sacrifice and painstaking care and attention. After the
Báb’s mangled remains had been rescued from the edge of a moat outside
the city gate of Tabríz in 1850, and had been housed in a number of
clandestine locations for 59 years, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá laid them to rest, in a
moment of high dignity and heart-rending pathos,65 during an interment
ceremony on Mt. Carmel on the first day of Naw-Rúz, 1909. It is a significant
measure of this event that Shoghi Effendi devoted the entire chapter XVIII
of God Passes By, “Entombment of the Báb’s Remains on Mt. Carmel,” to
this episode about which he wrote: “This act indeed deserves to rank as
one of the outstanding events in the first Bahá’í century.”66 The Guardian
also remarks that ‘Abdu’l-Bahá had fixed this act for Himself “as one of
the three principal objectives”67 of His ministry. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá needed only
to have said to the young Shoghi Effendi, “The sublime Shrine has remained
unbuilt....”68 His wish was His grandson’s command.

The first undertaking in 1928 was to excavate the solid rock face of
Mt. Carmel from behind the shrine in order to add three more “...extra,
massive, vaulted and high-ceilinged-rooms...”69 to ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s original
six to make a square and lay the foundation for the arcade over which the
superstructure would respose. That the work was a slow process is indicated
by the fact that it was not until 1942 that the Guardian commissioned his
father-in-law, the well-known Canadian architect William Sutherland
Maxwell, resident of Haifa, to begin the design of the superstructure. Hand
of the Cause of God, Leroy Ioas (1896-1965), who served Shoghi Effendi
at various tasks as assistant-secretary from March 1952-1957,70 was given
“...full charge of the construction work on the Shrine....”71 Hand of the
Cause of God, Dr. Ugo Giachery, had the specific task of supervising in
Italy “...the cutting, carving and shipping of all the marble needed to erect

the superstructure of the Shrine.”72 All three men had doors of the Shrine
named after them, a practice first observed by ‘Abdu’l-Bahá. Dr. Giachery
recalled that this project had the highest priority for the Guardian: “erection
of the Shrine of the Báb was of paramount importance in his mind; it was a
subject he favoured most and he expressed his ideas with deep conviction
and much expectation.”73 It transcended in sacredness, he said “...any
collective undertaking launched in the course of the history of the hundred
year old Faith.”74

The importance of this project was so monumental, and not to be arrested
under any circumstances, that the superstructure was completed only after
a two year period of fiscal austerity imposed by Shoghi Effendi, first on the
North American Bahá’ís, a period that was subsequently extended for
another two years to the entire Bahá’í world. In a cablegram to the fourth
and final Intercontinental Conference at New Delhi in October of the Holy
Year 1953, the Guardian announced the completion of the shrine. His proud
message is a concise gem of pure, triumphal poetry: “QUEEN OF CARMEL
ENTHRONED GOD’S MOUNTAIN, CROWNED GLOWING GOLD,
ROBED SHIMMERING WHITE, GIRDLED EMERALD GREEN,
ENCHANTING EVERY EYE FROM AIR, SEA, PLAIN, HILL.” (Capitals
in original).75 This cablegram conveys the point that the station of the Báb
impresses, as much as anything, by the sheer visual impact of the majesty
of the shrine which Shoghi Effendi always referred to, according to
Dr. Giachery, as “the throne of the Lord.”76

The Edit and Translation of The Dawn-Breakers
In January or February of March 1931, Shoghi Effendi completed his
translation and editing of Part One of The Dawn-Breakers, the eight hundred
page narrative77 written by the immortal flame and ardent Apostle of
Bahá’u’lláh, Nabíl-i-A’zam (Mullá Muhammad-i-Zarandí), the
shepherd-poet-chronicler. Shoghi Effendi explained in the Dispensation
that “...the chief motive...” that impelled him to undertake this demanding
project was to more befittingly recognize the station of the Báb:

> “Indeed the chief motive actuating me to undertake the task of
> editing and translating Nabíl’s immortal Narrative has been to
> enable every follower of the Faith in the West to better understand
> and more readily grasp the tremendous implications of His exalted
station and to more ardently admire and love Him.”78

This work exhausted the Guardian. He wrote to Martha Root in the
letter dated 3 March 1931 that “...I must stop and lie down.”79 Shoghi Effendi
writes in that same letter that the translation itself required eight months of
“continuous and hard labour,” while Rúhíyyih Rabbaní writes that the full
scope of it exacted “almost two years of research, compilation and
translation.”80 Shoghi Effendi wrote, again in the same letter to Martha
Root, that The record is an authentic one and deals chiefly with the Báb.”
In the Introduction, which was written with the help of an unnamed “English
correspondent,”81 the Guardian frames the narrative:

> “The main features of the narrative (the saintly heroic figure of the
> Báb, a leader so mild and so serene, yet eager, resolute, and
> dominant; the devotion of his followers facing oppression with
> unbroken courage and often with ecstasy; the rage of a jealous
> priesthood inflaming for its own purpose the passions of a
> bloodthirsty populace)—these speak a language which all may
understand.”82

“.....which all may understand.” This last phrase indicates the universal
appeal of the work. One also notices the resolution of the spiritual opposites
that are combined in the above description of the Báb. Mildness and serenity
are not usually intermingled with resolution and domination, but on this
rare spectrum of human and divine attributes, they are harmoniously
combined in one person. Another point is worth noting. Modern approaches
to the academic curriculum are normally separative with each discipline
being its own speciality. But in The Dawn-Breakers sacred history, drama,
heroism, tragedy, devotion and spirituality are combined in one volume.
The following cablegram emphasizes how this exemplary work, now much
neglected, can take a broad role in inspiring interdisciplinary studies. Simply
put, Nabil’s Narrative serves the functions of study, teaching, spirituality
and creativity. Of particular note is the inspirational nature of this work
recommended by Shoghi Effendi “...in all literary and artistic pursuits...,”
a point which impresses upon the reader that literature and art, and all
creative movements of the soul, can be inspired by the stirring example of
the heroic and sacrificial deeds of the early Bábí-Bahá’ís. This realization
also closes the gap between the secular and sacred functions of the arts.
“Secular” works of art can be inspired by spiritual events without being in
themselves overtly religious. Shoghi Effendi’s 1932 cablegram to the North
American Bahá’ís on this subject read:

> “Feel impelled appeal entire body American believers to henceforth
> regard Nabil’s soul stirring Narrative as essential adjunct to
> reconstructed Teaching program, as unchallengeable textbook in
> their Summer Schools, as source of inspiration in all literary and
> artistic pursuits, as an invaluable companion in times of leisure,
> as indispensable preliminary to future pilgrimage to Bahá’u’lláh’s
> native land, and as unfailing instrument to allay distress and resist
attacks of critical, disillusioned humanity.”83

That the Guardian had properly safeguarded the station of the Báb is
dramatically illustrated by the testimony of the French diplomat and
orientalist A. L. M. (Alphonse Louis-Marie) Nicolas who translated the
Báb’s Bayán into French “...and who might correctly be described as a
Bábí.”84 Rúhíyyih Rabbaní commented that: “For many years he was under
the impression that the Bahá’ís had ignored the greatness and belittled the
station of the Báb.”85 Shoghi Effendi’s befitting recognition of the Báb’s
true station produced a dramatic sense of relief in the French orientalist, as
evidenced in Nicholas’ letter to Edith Sanderson, an American who was a
member of the original circle of leading Bahá’ís in France, and who carried
a letter to him from Shoghi Effendi. His response to Ms. Sanderson is
poignant indeed because it reveals that this patient and devoted scholar
suffered alone for many years with his misunderstanding, in a state of mind
that had been accompanied by an acute sense of anguish. Nicholas’ torment
was suddenly relieved by the messenger of joy who came to confirm that
his ardent and unflagging faith in “the Point of the Bayán” was shared by
all Bahá’ís:86

Now I can die quietly....Glory to Shoghi Effendi who has calmed my
torment and my anxiety, glory to him who recognizes the worth of Siyyid
‘Alí Muhammad called the Báb. I am so content that I kiss your hands
which traced my address on the envelope which brought me the message of
Shoghi. Thank you Mademoiselle, thank you from the bottom of my heart.87

The Proof from History
At the outset of his exposition, Shoghi Effendi makes a fundamental
statement about the station of the Báb. It is twofold: (1) that of an inspired
Forerunner of Bahá’u’lláh (2) that of an independent Manifestation of God.
This “twofold station....constitutes the most distinctive feature of the Bahá’í
Dispensation.”88 (We are often in the presence of superlatives when reading

the Bahá’í writings, for ‘Abdu’l-Bahá says that the appointment of a Centre
of the Covenant is “the most great characteristic of the revelation of
Bahá’u’lláh.”89) The first point brings the inevitable comparison with John
the Baptist; the second point effectively destroys such comparisons, for
Shoghi Effendi writes:

> “That He is not to be regarded merely as an inspired Precursor of
> the Bahá’í Revelation, that in His person, as He Himself bears
> witness in the Persian Bayán, the object of all the Prophets gone
> before Him has been fulfilled, is a truth which I feel it my duty to
demonstrate and emphasize.”90

Another proof of the Báb’s station is presented in a form that the
Guardian calls “evidence,” an evidence that some might view as being more
oblique than traditional logical proofs with their appeal to reason or
authoritative proofs based on scripture. This is the proof from history. It is,
of course, understood that any such proof from history is not a proof in its
exact, mathematical, incontrovertible sense. (This is perhaps why the
Guardian used the word “evidence” rather than proof). This notion of proof
falls under the rubric of what ‘Abdu’l-Bahá called “spiritual proofs.”91
Shoghi Effendi writes:

> “The marvelous happenings that have heralded the advent of the
> Founder of the Bábí Dispensation, the dramatic circumstances of
> His own eventful life, the miraculous tragedy of His martyrdom,
> the magic of His influence exerted on the most eminent and powerful
> among His countrymen, to all of which every chapter of Nabíl’s
> stirring narrative testifies, should in themselves be regarded as
> sufficient evidence of the validity of His claim to so exalted a station
among the Prophets.”92

The Guardian’s argument is that the Báb’s deeds are sufficient proof of
the validity of His station. One can envisage the statement breaking down
into two parts: (1) those events touching mainly on the life of the Báb,
Himself (2) the effect of events connected with His life on others. The
second point brings us into the arena of historical and personal
transformation. Here one must emphasize that personal transformation is
an intrinsic part of historical transformation. Shoghi Effendi’s and Nabil’s
view of history is not just a matter of sequential events that are recorded in
a sterile, detached manner. They were written, to put Winston Churchill’s

celebrated words to a different use, with the “...blood, toil, tears and sweat.”93
of a generation of accused heretics that had recognized the Sáhibu’z-Zamán,
the Lord of the Age.

Less arbitrary than rational argument, more subjective than the appeal
to a disciplined philosophical argument, more aligned with story and drama,
Shoghi Effendi’s “evidence” looks to the undeniable transformative effect
of the personality of the Báb on those whose lives were touched by his
magnetic influence. This view of history is written by the cosmic Manus,
the Hand of God that reaches down and sets the stage for a modern day
taziyah, a Persian miracle play, that directs the players in their parts. It is,
consequently, not the technical history of the academic. However, this type
of history cannot be so easily minimized or dismissed as simple hagiography,
an idealized version of the life of saints written by saints. For this history
of the life of the Báb and the vast company of all His “...heroes and
martyrs...” is presented as being grounded in that rarest of circumstances
in which the ideal and the incredible are made demonstrably real and
believable by the living presence of the Promised One.

This theologically engaged history is written from the point of view of
those who are making it and by those who are its heirs. Living witnesses
themselves participate in the epoch-making events of which they tell. From
this standpoint, it is, in the German historian Leopold von Ranke’s well-
known phrase “was ist eigentlich gewsen,” what actually happened. For
Shoghi Effendi there was, undeniably, many an incident of both magic and
miracle in this mêlée of massacre, martyrdom and holy war. To the modern
secular mind, this history may seem uncomfortably crowded with
extraordinary events. To the believer, however, these events unfold within
a divinely ordained framework of compressed time, in which the Báb’s
resounding proclamation has irretrievably shattered the old order, as each
gathering episode drives the plot ineluctably forward to the Ultimate Event
that took place in a barrack’s square in Tabríz at noon on July 9, 1850.

The clinician’s approach to this singular history, while valid in the
academy, will not do for the Guardian’s reading of these events. The sanitized
approach will not do precisely because erudite histories, written in a
detached, detailed and analytical voice cannot—nor are they intended to—
do full justice to the spiritual revolution set in motion by the declaration of
the Báb in 1844 in Shiráz. Shoghi Effendi’s reference to “the magic of His
influence exerted on the most eminent and powerful among His
countrymen...” indicates that the Báb’s charisma penetrated the highest

circles of government. This statement speaks, not only of historical events,
but also of spiritual transformation; it explains the presence of literary and
dramatic elements, along with matters of record, in Shoghi Effendi’s and
Nabíl’s historical narratives.

It may seem surprising to say that there is nothing intrinsic to the bruta
facta of the history of the Báb that would serve the cause of religious values
per se. What one makes of this story depends entirely on the point of view
of the reader of Shoghi Effendi and Nabíl, and whether or not one is merely
curious onlooker or detached observer, or again, seeker or avowed believer.
As literary critic Hayden White has pointed out, any historical event can be
configured “...from a particular point of view or from within the context of
a structured set of events....”94 For the detached historian, Bábism, were he
or she not to take into account its growth into a bona fide world religion as
the Bahá’í Faith, might otherwise be viewed as nothing but a momentary
religious heresy that disturbed the late Qájár dynasty between 1844-1853,
then went down to the dust. But Shoghi Effendi’s position is clear. He is a
partisan. His view of the historical record cannot but eulogize the historical
evidence of the Divine Presence that manifested itself as true heroism and
sacrifice.

The history of the Báb elicits another pressing question. It is this: to
whom shall we give the last word? Who shall determine the ultimate meaning
of these events? In Shoghi Effendi’s reading, the last word belongs, not to
the detached observer, but to the participants engaged in this titanic struggle,
how they defined themselves and understood the meaning of the events in
which they themselves participated. To remain neutral in the face of such a
bloody and unequal contest of oppressors against oppressed would be
untenable. To come to the point of this argument— in Shoghi Effendi’s
view of history, we have to side either with the Báb and His chosen company
of heroes, saints and martyrs, or sympathize with the Sháh, the Shiite clergy
and their company of villains, tyrants, cowards and executioners. The
abdication of value-judgement is not required in this reading of history. On
the contrary, the record of such extraordinary events requires partisanship.
Both God Passes By and Nabil’s histories loudly proclaim that if the reader
is not moved by these events, he shall be moved by no others.

The foregoing considerations, I should hasten to add, are not intended
as a wholesale condemnation of academic histories. That would be a
complete misunderstanding of my argument. What I am suggesting, rather,
is that the “blurred genres” and polyphonic voices of theology, history and

drama found in God Passes By and Nabíl’s Narrative should be examined
on their own terms, rather than being discounted as unreliable because of
their partisan, impassioned point of view. For this is a history seen from the
inside out, not from the outside in.

Ultimately, “the proof of history” in Shoghi Effendi’s sense of it, requires
that we see with the eyes of the believer. Only then does his cosmological
statement95 that the proof of the Báb’s claim to prophethood can be found
in the deeds He performed, and in their influence on His countrymen, begin
to make sense. This may well require a “leap of faith,” a suspension of
disbelief, made in an attempt to go beyond our own inherited cultural
prejudices, secular values and norms in order to attempt to see with the
eyes of those who freely gave up their lives for the Báb.

Those who participated in the history of the Báb, and the Báb Himself,
were witnesses who gave testimony. Avery Cardinal Dulles, holder of the
Lawrence J. McGinley Chair of Religion and Society at Fordham University
(2006), writes that the newer form of apologetics which he advocates relies
on the credibility of “the witness.” This personal testimony—and God
Passes By and Nabíl’s Narrative are replete with it—requires a different
sort of epistemology than that of the scientist or the secular academic. For
the scientist and the academic historian, the data are “...to be investigated
as a passive object to be mastered and brought within the investigator’s
intellectual horizons. The interpretations offered by others are not accepted
on authority but are tested by critical probing.”96 However, the proof that
comes from witnesses and their testimony is something quite different.
Cardinal Dulles explains:

> The event is an interpersonal encounter, in which the witness plays
> an active role, making an impact upon us. Without in any way
> compelling us to believe, the witness calls for a free assent that
> involves personal respect and trust. To reject the message is to
> withhold confidence in the witness. To accept it is a trusting
> submission to the witness’s authority. To the extent that we believe,
> we renounce our autonomy and willingly depend on the judgment
> of others.97

While according to ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, Bahá’í theology rejects miracles as
a universal and binding proof of the divine mission of the Prophet,98 with
the histories of Shoghi Effendi and Nabíl, we have nonetheless clearly
entered the arena of the miraculous. This sense of the miraculous, with the

notable exception of the martyrdom of the Báb (see Chapter 10), is not a
“miracle” in the conventional sense of the word, viz., the suspension of the
fixed natural order by the direct intervention of Providence in a specific
situation. The “magic” of the Báb’s influence on the elite of Persia of which
the Guardian writes points to an extremely rare phenomenon of divine
inspiration, inexplicable in any other terms than that of the direct influence
of the Holy Spirit. The superhuman deeds of the Bábís, inspired by the
charismatic life and sacrificial death of that “cruel charmer”99 from Shiraz,
as Táhirih once poetically described the Báb, take on mythic proportions.
While the Muslim oppressors and executioners no doubt believed that they
had inflicted a well-deserved punishment on the Báb by putting Him to
death, and had successfully stamped out the spreading flame of the new
faith, in reality, their barbaric cruelty only served to put into evidence the
transformative power of the Báb on these precious souls. Bahá’u’lláh gave
the decisive word on this proof from history:

> Could such a thing be made manifest except through the power of
> a divine Revelation, and the potency of God’s invincible Will? By
> the righteousness of God! Were any one to entertain so great a
> Revelation in his heart, the thought of such a declaration would
> alone confound him! Were the hearts of all men to be crowded into
> his heart, he would still hesitate to venture upon so awful an
> enterprise.100 ...If these companions, with all their marvellous
> testimonies and wondrous works, be false, who then is worthy to
> claim for himself the truth? I swear by God! Their very deeds are a
> sufficient testimony, and an irrefutable proof unto all the peoples
> of the earth, were men to ponder in their hearts the mysteries of
divine Revelation.101

This last sentence tells us that we have to revise our notion of proof. It
tells us that a proof may be “irrefutable” once we are willing to enter into a
process of ponderation, of search and discovery, of sounding out what at
first hand may seem to be an irrational or overly dramatic chapter taken
from the religious history of nineteenth century Persia. It would appear
self-evident, as William James argued in more elaborate form, that “the
will to believe” is determinative in our selection of the moral and cognitive
truths that we choose to espouse. Without this will, any proof, demonstrable
though it may be, will not be accepted. Bahá’u’lláh affirms that this proof
from history cannot be fully understood unless a willing attempt is made to

apprehend the mystery of the unrestrained power that created this history,
and to enter into its Spirit, a power that was able to call forth superhuman
deeds that both transcended and defied the slaughter of the innocents.

THE STATION OF ‘ABDU’L-BAHÁ
The Language and Logic of Fundamental Theology102
The term “fundamental theology” is derived from the Guardian’s statement
that the Dispensation treats some of “the fundamental verities of the Faith.”103
These fundamental verities form the basis for Bahá’í apologetics. Certain
Bahá’í scholars, in forcing a distinction between apologetics and scholarship,
have become wary of apologetics since it is viewed by them as a facile,
overly ambitious, triumphal enterprise which lacks the critical, historical and
“objective” skills and methods used in the academy. However, this is an
oversimplification of the apologetic enterprise itself which has proven itself
capable of successfully combining critical, historical and scientific methods
with the rational explanation of Bahá’í teachings. The valuable work of Dr.
Udo Schaefer exemplifies such an approach. It is, rather, more probable that
Bahá’í apologetics has scarcely begun. The negative view of apologetics by
certain Bahá’í scholars, where it exits, has likely been formed from pressures
exerted by the academies, both secular and sacred.

About the middle of the twentieth century, except for evangelicals,
apologetics had all but been abandoned within Christianity itself. The Roman
Catholic church rebaptised the discipline as “fundamental theology.” Unlike
the practice of an earlier age, fundamental theology addressed itself mainly
to believers, instead of appealing to non-believers, but the older term still
appears in current Roman Catholic publications and appears to be making
a resurgence as evidenced by a number of publications that appeared in the
1990’s and after the turn of the twentieth century.104 Protestant theological
faculties do not use this term but continue to refer instead to apologetics or
dogmatics/dogmatic theology, although these terms have declined somewhat
in use. Roman Catholic fundamental theology bases its analysis on very
wide, comprehensive foundations (philosophical, anthropological,
historical, biblical, cultural) and its traditional divisions are faith, revelation
and Church.105 See for example German theologian Hans Fries’ very
comprehensive Fundamental Theology (Fundamentaltheologie 1985) trans.
by Robert J. Daly, S. J. with an Epilogue by Thomas M. Kelly (Washington,
D. C.: The Catholic University of America Press), 1996.

In a Bahá’í context, by theology I mean rational explanation of the
knowledge of God, and more properly, the knowledge that is text-rooted in
the Bahá’í sacred writings.

In Christian terms, fundamental theology has a “dogmatic” element.

This refers to those authoritative teachings that must be taught and handed
down in order to qualify one for belief. However, Bahá’í parlance names
those binding teachings coming from the Báb, Bahá’u’lláh, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá,
Shoghi Effendi and the Universal House of Justice as “authoritative.” The
word dogmatic has, of course, a foreboding, negative connotation; some
may be discomfited to see it associated in any way with The Dispensation
of Bahá’u’lláh.

However, the Latin word dogma, deriving from the Greek, originally
meant “opinion,” and the word “orthodox” translated literally from the
Greek simply means “correct opinion.”As with other theological terms,
the word dogmatic came to assume particular meanings in its own historical
development which are not pertinent to this study. Prior to the Reformation,
theologians of the Middle Ages referred instead to articuli fidei, articles of
faith (of the confession).106 If one is looking for parallels, such articles of
faith would be somewhat closer in tenor to statements of Bahá’í belief,
teachings or principles. Fundamental theology in reference to the
Dispensation indicates authoritative teachings that are intended to be handed
down intact. Such an orientation is predetermined by the inspired nature
and veracity of Shoghi Effendi’s interpretations and judgments, rather than
being a blind appeal to authority for authority’s sake, or a coercing of
doctrinal unity regardless. These “fundamental verities” are also grounded
in historical experience, that is, they are not purely theoretical constructs
but derive from, and are intimately connected to, the sacred lives and events
that occurred in the historical development of the Bahá’í Faith.

A broad historical parallel occurs—and I emphasize the word broad—
between the theology of the Dispensation and the evolution of church
dogma. Both theologies were formulated at a particular time in the historical
development of the respective faiths in response to misunderstandings that
had arisen in the community. In the case of both religions, defectors had
perturbed the unity of the Faith and Shoghi Effendi was no doubt concerned
with the possible widening influence of such defections. It is quite clear
from the internal evidence of the Dispensation itself that Shoghi Effendi
felt that serious misunderstandings were abroad in the community regarding

the station of the Three Central Figures, and the nature and functions of the
Administrative Order. Thus, the Dispensation came to be written as a
proactive, preventative initiative as well as being an ad hoc response to
misunderstanding. The broad historical parallel being drawn here does not
suggest any parity between the teachings of the Dispensation and the dogmas
of the church. The point is that in both cases, the laying down of authoritative
teachings arose because of the exigencies of historical circumstances that
required a definitive response to dispel misunderstandings and to preserve
the unity of the Faith.

Demonstrative Reason, Orthodoxy and Moral Integrity
While Shoghi Effendi was no trained theologian or moral philosopher, but
rather the guide and head of an expanding world religion, the Dispensation
reveals that his interpretations of the station of the Three Central Figures,
and the nature and function of the Administrative Order, reflect an incisive
but nonetheless practical theological reasoning. Although his judgments
are apodictic, they are accompanied nonetheless by a certain demonstrative
reason. Demonstrative reason does not imply, of course, its narrow, technical
sense of sequential, deductive logic to prove a proposition. It means, rather,
that his theological judgments are based on reason, as well as divine
authority, and are susceptible of further demonstration or proof.
Demonstrative reason includes: (1) statements of value (2) statements of
fact (3) statements of policy.

A “dialectical” element may be seen to inhere in the Guardian’s
reasoning by virtue of his dispensing with hypotheses and proceeding
from divinely revealed first principles, the “fundamental verities,” that
are rooted in scripture. This proceeding from established first principles
or axioms was characteristic of Plato’s understanding of dialectical reason
which he viewed as the basis of all knowledge and whose application led
to the knowledge of the forms.107 The Canadian theologian Bernard
Lonergan (1904-1984) has pointed out that another function of dialectic
is the resolution of ideological conflict.108 Shoghi Effendi clearly had in
mind to resolve some of the conflicting or misapprehended beliefs that
existed during his lifetime about the Three Central Figures and the
Administrative Order.

The Guardian uses demonstrative reasoning to judge the truth or falsity
of a doctrine or doctrines, either to establish a truth statement or series of
truth statements or to deny a doctrine, belief or assumption. He proceeds

through a dynamic that moves either in cumulative fashion, progressing
from truth to truth [positive             positive] or by demolition in an
“erase-replace” manner, one that abolishes falsehood and moves to truth
[negative(false)         positive(true)]. However, several of his theological
judgements, both positive and negative, are simply mentioned in passing,
i.e. his rejection of pantheism, anthropomorphism and incarnation theology
and his affirmation of the accomplishments of the great world religions.109
These affirmations or negations will serve as a seedbed for present and
future theological reflection.

His declarations, statements or conclusions are accompanied by
categorical theological judgements, and the assumption of their contrary
is sometimes accompanied by strong words of reproach, markedly atypical
in contemporary theology, but befitting one who, as Defender of the Faith,
was responsible, not only for the propagation, but also the protection of
the integrity of the Bahá’í teachings. Such strong phrases as “...open
blasphemy...shameless betrayal...heretical belief...direct violation...
unpardonable ursurpation...emphatically repudiate...tantamount to a
betrayal of its cause...violating one of its basic and sacred
principles...manifest betrayal...reprehensible...erroneous conception...”
are expressed in anticipation of any violation of the interpretations he
presents.

Shoghi Effendi, however, does not exempt himself and the Guardianship
from his own remarks. He writes, for example, in those passages of Part
Four that define the limitations of the Guardianship, in light of the greater
station of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, that any present or future Guardian “... cannot, if
he wishes to remain faithful to his trust, arrogate to himself, under any
pretense whatsoever, the rights, the privileges and prerogatives which
Bahá’u’lláh has chosen to confer upon His Son.”110 The Guardian goes on
to say: “For my own part to hesitate in recognizing so vital a truth or to
vacillate in proclaiming so firm a conviction must constitute a shameless
betrayal of the confidence reposed in me by ‘Abdu’l-Bahá and an
unpardonable usurpation of the authority with which He Himself has been
invested.”111

Shoghi Effendi’s righteous indignation is not intended to be simply an
arbitrary control mechanism. Another dynamic is at work. Adherence to
Bahá’í belief demands, not only intellectual honesty, but moral integrity.
His strong remonstrances and/or condemnations indicate that there can be
no real separation between the intellectual and moral/spiritual spheres of a

believer’s life, a point that has been made explicit by the Universal House
of Justice: “We cannot separate spirit from method and character.”112 His
offence at the false doctrine erases the line between the intellectual and
moral error. His taking umbrage at what some might view as a pious
overreaction to simply the “wrong idea” springs from what he viewed, not
only as a desecration of sacred truth, but also as a moral failure.

While such views and sentiments may seem forbidding to the proponents
of academic freedom and the postmodern, relative outlook, they are
nonetheless integral to Shoghi Effendi’s understanding of Bahá’í orthodoxy.
The foregoing should be nuanced with this observation. While exercising
the duties of sacred office, the Guardian was “uncompromising in essentials
but flexible in non-essentials.”113 In his personal dealings with pilgrims,
and with those who served as his assistants and co-workers in Haifa, he
manifested to a remarkable degree the virtues of “a catholicity of spirit,”
“lack of fanaticism,” “humility,” “compassion and kindness,” “generosity”
and “courtesy,” attributes all falling under that magnanimity of soul that is
called “nobility.”114 But for purposes of defining and maintaining “unity of
doctrine,”115 he remained strictly categorical.

Logical Consequences
The Guardian exposes and corrects a major misconception that was
circulating among some American Bahá’ís regarding the station of ‘Abdu’l-
Bahá in the rank order of the Three Central Figures of the Bahá’í Faith.
The main thrust of his argument, stated negatively, is “That ‘Abdu’l-Bahá
is not a Manifestation of God....” 116 To believe the contrary is a
“...unwarranted inference...”117 The reasons for this misconception are
clearly explained.118 Two scriptural statements substantiate the rejection of
the error that once mistook ‘Abdu’l-Bahá for a Prophet: (1) In His Most
Holy Book Bahá’u’lláh warns that no prophet shall appear “...ere the
expiration of a full thousand years...” This statement itself excludes
‘Abdu’l-Bahá from prophethood.119 (2) ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s own categorical
self-understanding as nothing other than the Servant of Bahá also excludes
such an interpretation.120

However, other conclusions drawn from these two statements are
incidentally instructive. Once we are disabused of the false notion of
‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s prophethood, it occurs that a self-generative, that is,
degenerative process, can inhere in deductive logic. A false premise
generates, not only a series of false beliefs, but, more importantly, it can

produce real adversity. Beliefs are not mere abstractions; they have
real-life consequences. Shoghi Effendi explained that those who
overestimated ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s station produced real hardship for His
faithful friends:

> “Indeed, as I have already stated, those who overestimate
> ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s station are just as reprehensible and have done
> just as much harm as those who underestimate it. And this for no
> other reason except that by insisting upon an altogether
> unwarranted inference from Bahá’u’lláh’s writings they are
> inadvertently justifying and continuously furnishing the enemy with
proofs for his false accusations and misleading statements.”121

What Shoghi Effendi refers to, inter alia, is the false charge of
‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s half-brother, “the arch Covenant breaker” 122 Mirzá
Muhammad ‘Alí and his followers, that ‘Abdu’l-Bahá had laid claim to the
station of Divinity. In his so-called ‘epistle of repentance,’ Bahá’u’lláh’s
youngest son, Mirzá Badí’u’lláh (d. 1950), who had thrown his support behind
the older brother Mirzá Muhammad ‘Alí, described the misdeeds committed
by the latter. They included the serious crime of interpolating Bahá’u’lláh’s
sacred writings in order to belittle the station of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá and to exalt
his own.123 Somewhat like the doubting Thomas who was Christ’s apostle
(John 20:26-29), the youngest son was a wavering Badí’u’lláh. According to
tradition, however, the critically-minded and sceptical Thomas, unlike
Badí’u’lláh, remained faithful and died a martyr’s death.124 The parallel to
Badí’u’lláh, regrettably only one of the faithless sons, while not exact, is
perhaps closer to Judas. His brief moment of repentance was soon followed
by a relapse into rebellion and faithlessness. The letter of repentance makes
clear that among these “false accusations,”—and this despite ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s
repeated and explicit written denials—125 was Muhammad ‘Alí’s allegation
that “...the Master claims to be the embodiment of Divinity....”126 In a tablet
that outlines some of the misdeeds committed by the younger brother, and
which stigmatizes him as “the Centre of Sedition,” ‘Abdu’l-Bahá refers to
this very accusation: “Another day he would raise an uproar, saying that the
oneness of God had been denied, since another Manifestation had been
proclaimed, prior to the expiration of a thousand years.”127

Shoghi Effendi makes three other deductions128 that necessarily follow
from the statement that ‘Abdu’l-Bahá is not a Manifestation of God: (1)
He corrects the misapprehension that ‘Abdu’l-Bahá enjoys a “mystic

unity”129 with Bahá’u’lláh. To hold such a belief “...would constitute a
direct violation of the oft repeated principle of the oneness of God’s
Manifestations—a principle which the Author [Bahá’u’lláh] of these same
extracts is seeking by implication to emphasize.”130 However, the principle
of mystic unity would legitimately apply to the relationship between God
and His Prophet. Shoghi Effendi has in mind to prevent the same type of
regressive error that crept into early Christianity. (2): “It would also
amount to a reversion to those irrational and superstitious beliefs which
have insensibly crept, in the first century of the Christian era, into the
teachings of Jesus Christ, and by crystallizing into accepted dogmas have
impaired the effectiveness and obscured the purpose of the Christian
Faith.”131What the Guardian may have in mind here is a reference to the
dogma of the trinity, which was itself subject to a historical process—
this may explain the reference to “dogmas”—with its divinization of Jesus
the Son who has been elevated to the station of God the Father. (3) To
maintain a belief in the mystic unity of Bahá’u’lláh and ‘Abdu’l-Bahá
would result in an unconscionable, strange reversal. It would lower the
station of the Báb:

> “Furthermore, the inescapable inference from the belief in the
> identity of the Author of our Faith with Him Who is the Center of
> His Covenant would be to place ‘Abdu’l-Bahá in a position superior
> to that of the Báb, the reverse of which is the fundamental, though
> not as yet universally recognized, principle of this Revelation.”132

It is noteworthy that the belief that ‘Abdu’l-Bahá was not a prophet
was “...not as yet universally recognized...”, a misconception that was
understandable perhaps in light of “...the vibrant, the magnetic personality
of ‘Abdu’l Bahá...” with its “...glory and power with which They who are
the Manifestations of God are alone endowed.”133 ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, however,
chose rather to define His own station in terms of pure servitude to
Bahá’u’lláh. In a famous declaration, He wrote:

My name is ‘Abdu’l Bahá. My qualification is ‘Abdu’l Bahá. My reality
is ‘Abdu’l Bahá. My praise is ‘Abdu’l Bahá. Thraldom to the Blessed
Perfection is my glorious and refulgent diadem, and servitude to all the
human race my perpetual religion... No name, no title, no mention, no
commendation have I, nor will ever have, except ‘Abdu’l Bahá. This is my
longing. This is my greatest yearning. This is my eternal life. This is my
everlasting glory.134

While this was ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s definitive self-understanding, the pens
of Bahá’u’lláh and Shoghi Effendi added another dimension to His station:
the Mystery of God (sir’u’lláh). In the person and in “...the magic name
‘Abdu’l-Bahá...”135 this divine name is forever preserved. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá is
“...a secret for which no answer can be found.”136 He was, and shall remain,
a living paradox since the existence of a perfect human being is a
contradiction in terms. “This Branch of Holiness”137 will continue to
confound all attempts to fathom His mysterious being:

> “He is, above and beyond these appellations, the “Mystery of God”
> - an expression by which Bahá’u’lláh Himself has chosen to
> designate Him, and which, while it does not by any means justify
> us to assign to Him the station of Prophethood, indicates how in
> the person of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá the incompatible characteristics of a
> human nature and superhuman knowledge and perfection have been
> blended and are completely harmonized.”138

Hermeneutical Pointers
Certain features of demonstrative reason are not the only rational tools that
emerge in Shoghi Effendi’s clarification of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s station. Some
principles of hermeneutics, the art of interpretation, especially of
authoritative writings, may also be found. The erroneous belief in a “mystic
unity” between Bahá’u’lláh and ‘Abdu’l-Bahá was made by an unjustified
inference taken out of context. Shoghi Effendi explains that the unity of
God with the Divine Manifestations, as implied in the phrase “He is Myself,”
which appears in the Kitáb-i-Íqán,139 was misappropriated and incorrectly
applied to the relationship between the Father (Bahá’u’lláh) and the Son
(‘Abdu’l-Bahá).140 Now taking a statement out of one context and applying
it inappropriately in another can be evidence of the following: (1) an
esotericism that is prone to fabricate speculative beliefs or ethereal concepts.
(2) a fundamentalist mentality that fails to make necessary distinctions where
they are required. (3) forcing an argument. (4) an indiscriminate levelling
process that seems justified in light of such a pervasive teaching as “unity.”
Mr. Thornton Chase, the first Bahá’í in America, has left a written statement
that substantiates point (1). He informs us that in the opening years of the
twentieth century, some Bahá’ís were in the habit of selecting what
functioned for them as scriptural code-words that they put to various
personal, esoteric interpretations. It is, however, understandable that Bahá’ís
of Christian background would be liable to misconceive this mystic unity

since Father-Son phraseology had been basic to Christian belief for centuries
and had seeped into the cultural fabric. To make his point clear, the Guardian
had recourse to negative theology. He stipulated how ‘Abdu’l-Bahá was
not to be regarded by the “Christian Bahá’ís” of his time. His statement
makes it clear that ‘Abdu’l-Bahá was in fact so regarded: “that He is not to
be acclaimed as the return of Jesus Christ, the Son Who will come “in the
glory of the Father.”141

Robert H. Stockman’s archival research substantiates Shoghi Effendi’s
assertion. He writes that Thornton Chase, the man designated by
‘Abdu’l-Bahá as “the first Bahá’í in America,”142 complained frequently in
his letters that the Bahá’ís misunderstood ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s station. In a letter
that does not conceal his disappointment, written to Major Wellesley
Tudor-Pole (1 December 1911), who served later with the British army of
occupation in Haifa, and who was a fervent admirer of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá,
Mr. Chase wrote:

> Many of those who have named themselves Bahá’ís are of an
> enthusiastic and emotional nature which seeks a living object upon
> which to lavish the wealth of their hopes. They seek out single phrases
> and words, occurring in various Tablets from ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, give to
> them their own interpretations, and then set them up as a sort of
> authority contrary to the evident strong and oft repeated declarations
> of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá himself regarding his mission and station. As though
> that which he emphasizes were not sufficiently great, they strive to
> consider and proclaim him to be the Christ, the Word Incarnate, the
> Savior, etc., and they bitterly antagonize those who look upon
Bahá’u’llah as the fulfiller and completer of these Offices.143

It is to his credit that Thornton Chase understood and upheld the
distinction between the stations of Bahá’u’lláh and ‘Abdu’l-Bahá at a time
when many American Bahá’ís were simply too overawed by the majesty of
‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s charisma to understand Him according to His own behest.
Dr. Stockman correctly points out that the question of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s station
was “totally confusing to the American Christian mind. No categories existed
for thinking about him.”144 The subtleties involved in discerning how “...the
incompatible characteristics of a human nature and superhuman knowledge
and perfection have been blended and are completely harmonized.”145 were
evidently too complex for the many who met ‘Abdu’l-Bahá to see him in
any other light than that of prophethood.

Unlike Mr. Chase, other Bahá’ís, like the naturopath Dr. Edward
Getsinger, failed to be convinced, even by ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s emphatic denials.
Although Getsinger spent over six months in Akká in 1899, 1900 and 1901,
still he clung to his own opinion, as one of his letters indicates. For Getsinger,
‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s claim of pure servitude was but a blanket of humility that
could not conceal His true reality, at least as Getsinger divined it. In May,
1903 he wrote the Bahá’ís of North Hudson, New Jersey, sharing his personal
doctrinal insights: “We should never cease to impress all that the Master is
whom we believe He is—The Christ of this generation to the Gentiles, and
not what He in His humility chooses to claim for Himself—a servant.”146
Dr. Getsinger’s argument was so convincing that the North Hudson Board
of Council “heartily endorsed” the doctor’s analysis in their minutes!147

Ali Kuli Khan, who had spent fourteen months between 1900-1901

working as ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s translator, saw the theological conundrum. If
Bahá’ís say that Bahá’u’lláh is Christ, what claim can they make for
‘Abdu’l-Bahá? Upon his arrival in America in 1901, he wrote:

> If you want to say that all our Christian world have been waiting
> the Appearance of Father & Christ, & that if you tell them Beha
> was Christ then you will have difficulty in proving to them
> ‘Abdu’l-Bahá—this is a question which you will have to write for
> the Master, and then He will direct you how to teach this point.148

I found echoes of this completely sincere but mistaken belief about
‘Abdu’l-Bahá during my interview with the noted writer/teacher Stanwood
Cobb at his home at the Green Acre Bahá’í School near Eliot, Maine in the
summer of 1977. Mr. Cobb who was then in his nineties, shared his personal
impressions of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá whom he met on four different occasions in
1908, 1910,1912 and 1913.149 Responding to my question as to how
Mr. Cobb viewed ‘Abdu’l-Bahá with the passing years, the tension in the
air was clearly felt as Mr. Cobb struggled with his answer. With sudden
emotion, Mr. Cobb said: “Well, if I told you what I really thought you would
find it reprehensible.” When asked for a clarification, he replied: “If
‘Abdu’l-Bahá had not specifically denied being a prophet, as far as I was
concerned, He was. He moved with the ease of a king, was as free as a bird
and did just as He pleased.”150

Another factor may account for the adoption of the mystic unity theory.

This is ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s function of Interpreter of the sacred writings of
Bahá’u’lláh. It is plausible to assume that the one who is able to interpret

infallibly the writings of Bahá’u’lláh must also know Bahá’u’lláh’s mind
and therefore be “unified” with it. But Shoghi Effendi’s distinction about
his own function as interpreter of the sacred writings dispels this confusion.
He puts believers on guard against assuming an equality of station between
himself and his grandfather and great-grandfather simply because he has
been authorized to interpret their words:

> “The fact that the Guardian has been specifically endowed with
> such power as he may need to reveal the purport and disclose the
> implications of the utterances of Bahá’u’lláh and of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá
> does not necessarily confer upon him a station co-equal with those
> Whose words he is called upon to interpret. He can exercise that
> right and discharge this obligation and yet remain infinitely inferior
> to both of them in rank and different in nature.”151

By analogy, the same principle may be extended to ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s
interpretation of the writings of Bahá’u’lláh. Being able to infallibly
interpret may mean, in some sense, “knowing the mind of,” but this
knowing the mind of does not imply a unity of essence with and/or a co-
equal divine station.
Exclusionary Definitions
It is true that in theology, as in philosophy, we cannot know what something
is until we also know what it is not. While the Guardian’s interpretations
may be analyzed further, this analysis must, of course, observe the spirit
and the letter of his own interpretations. With his authoritative interpretations
and explications, Shoghi Effendi was, so to speak, sculpting. Gradually, he
chiselled away at the vague and erroneous beliefs once held by Bahá’ís,
but once he was through cutting, shaping and polishing, a perfect
representation emerged that wedded beauty to truth.

The vague ideas and outright errors that Shoghi Effendi exposed in
The Dispensation of Bahá’u’lláh has its parallel with most orthodox
theologies of past dispensations. All theology has its negative as well
as its positive pole, grey areas notwithstanding; that which must be
rejected, and that which can be endorsed as being true. The negative
pole results in a narrowing down of the belief system; this is an integral
function of any authoritative definition. To a large degree this has been
true of historical Christianity from the earliest days in its orthodox
struggles against Gnosticism and what it viewed later as the heresies.

The respected twentieth century theologian Paul Tillich, although he
deplored what he viewed as the excessive narrowing down that had
taken place in the formation of Christian dogma, recognized at the same
time that conceptual restriction was necessary to the elaboration of all
consequential theological doctrines:

> The whole history of Christian dogma is a continuing narrowing
> down, but at the same time a defining. And the definition is
> important, because without it many elements would have undercut
> the whole church, would have denied its existence. The dogma,
> therefore, the dogmatic development, is not something merely
> lamentable or evil. It was the necessary form by which the church
> kept its very identity...152

If Tillich’s idea is transposed and adjusted to the Dispensation, grosso
modo a similar process is taking place. By excluding, the Guardian is
also defining. However, with his elucidations, Shoghi Effendi is not just
applying a scalpel to Bahá’í doctrine. Although he takes away, in an “erase-
replace” manner, he also adds. As was seen above, for example, the
Guardian rejected the “mystic unity” theory between “Abdu’l-Bahá and
Bahá’u’lláh, but it is noteworthy that he advocated instead the more
positive and accurate relation of “mystic intercourse”153 between Father
and Son.

As for the abstruse nature of the unity of the prophets, the valid form of
mystic unity, this remains for all else besides them an inscrutable mystery,
and an effort of the human imagination, since it is entirely beyond the
realm of human experience. Yet within the limitations imposed upon human
speech, Bahá’u’lláh alludes to this truth in the Súriy-i-Haykal. The Guardian
quotes Bahá’u’lláh in His relationship with the Báb: “Had the Primal Point
been someone else beside Me as ye claim, and had attained My presence,
verily He would have never allowed Himself to be separated from Me, but
rather We would have had mutual delights with each other in My Days.”154
In other words, the Twin Manifestations were already one despite their
separation from one another.

Positive and Negative Theology
Let us consider further the question of positive and negative theology,
already alluded to. One of the usual meanings of negative theology, a
classical element of sacred study, is that which links it to theologica

apophatika, apophatic theology (via negativa), i.e. maintaining “...the
strictest silence about the essence of divinity which it views as being
completely unknowable, and confines itself to defining God in the
negative:”155 In theologica kataphatika (cataphatic/affirmative theology),
whatever is affirmed of God is simply meant to underscore the fact that
God is not lacking these qualities.156 Positive attributions in no way
describe God.157 ‘Abdu’l-Bahá encapsulates the essence of negative
theology when he says: “We affirm these names and attributes, not to
prove the perfections of God, but to deny that He is capable of
imperfections.”158 Here, however, I am using the term “negative theology”
in a particular way: to draw attention to Shoghi Effendi’s exclusions, the
negative pole of saying no, to define instead the true nature of the thing,
its positive pole of saying yes.

Perhaps the best example of this technique of polar theology is the
summary of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s station. Shoghi Effendi employs a trenchant
but practical logic in defining the station of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá. Upon
reflection, one becomes aware that his statement carefully balances
affirmations and negations. This pattern will become clearer if [+] and
[-] signs are inserted into the text. His statement consists of four balanced
paratactical clauses (see Chapter 6) which have been enumerated from
[1]-[7]. The result is a juxtaposition of positive and negative elements
that produce a truth statement in which, of the seven signs, four are
negative and three positive:

> “[1][-]That ‘Abdu’l-Bahá is not a Manifestation of God, [2] [+]
> that He gets His light, His inspiration and sustenance direct
> from the Fountain head of the Bahá’í Revelation; [3][+] that
> He reflects even as a clear and perfect Mirror the rays of
> Bahá’u’lláh’s glory, [4] [-] and does not inherently possess that
> indefinable yet all pervading reality the exclusive possession of
> which is the hallmark of Prophethood; [5] [-]that His words are
> not equal in rank, [6] [+] though they possess an equal validity
> with the utterances of Bahá’u’lláh; [7][-] that He is not to be
> acclaimed as the return of Jesus Christ, the Son Who will come
> “in the glory of the Father”.159

Other examples may be found of this structural, positive-negative
juxtaposition throughout the Dispensation. Here are further examples that,
for brevity’s sake, will be given without quotation:

(1) That Bahá’u’lláh is the supreme Manifestation of God but He is not

God.160
(2) That the Bahá’í Faith is the culmination of the world religions but does

not invalidate them.
(3) That the Bahá’í Faith, despite the magnitude of its power, is not the

final revelation from God.
(4) That the Báb is a self-sufficient Manifestation of God, not merely an

inspired precursor of Bahá’u’lláh.
(5) That the Guardian is the permanent head of the Universal House of

> Justice but cannot legislate, except as an individual member of that
> body.
(6) That the exalted position of the Guardian does not make him a co-sharer

in the station of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá.

End Limits: Neither Too Much Nor Too Little
With his positive-negative structural pattern, which is used in conjunction
with a [statement + qualification] or [statement + caution] pattern, Shoghi
Effendi considers both ends of the theological spectrum, viz., he affirms
positive truths while eliminating errors. Briefly, the example used in
(1) above “That Bahá’u’lláh is the supreme Manifestation of God but He is
not God.” serves as example. This is one end of the spectrum (neither too
much). At the other end (nor too little), the Guardian’s statement on the
station of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá will serve again. Here Shoghi Effendi cautions
against an extreme reduction of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s claim to pure servitude.
Again, the intellectual error would result in moral error—lowering the
dignity of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s sation:

> “From such clear and formally laid down statements, incompatible
> as they are with any assertion of a claim to Prophethood, we should
> not by any means infer that ‘Abdu’l-Bahá is merely one of the
> servants of the Blessed Beauty, or at best one whose function is to
> be confined to that of an authorized interpreter of His Father’s
> teachings. Far be it from me to entertain such a notion or to wish
> to instill such sentiments.”161

By carefully defining end limits, Shoghi Effendi prevents at the same
time triumphalistic, separative and/or demeaning views of the Three Central
Figures, while giving a sense of moderation and balance to Bahá’í belief.

SELECTED POINTS ON THE ADMINISTRATIVE ORDER
Generative Imagery in Shoghi Effendi’s Elucidations of the Will and
Testament of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá
The fourth and final division of the Dispensation is an analysis of the
Administrative or World Order of Bahá’u’lláh. In explaining the mysterious
origins of the Administrative Order, Shoghi Effendi employs some of the
most distinctive and powerful imagery found in his treatise. The passage to
which I refer reveals the mystic origins of the Will and Testament which
the Guardian calls “...the Charter of the New World Order which is at once
the glory and the promise of this most great Dispensation.”162 He explains
the origin of the Will in terms of a birthing process, a process of creative
generation. The passage in question is noteworthy, not just because it is
another incisive interpretation. With it, the Guardian exposes a revealing
hermeneutics of insight which substantiates ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s declaration that
the hidden things of God will be made plain with the advent of the Promised
Day:

> “By the help of this effulgent Light all the spiritual interpretation
> of the Holy Writings has been made plain, the hidden things of
> God’s Universe have become manifest, and we have been enabled
> to comprehend the Divine purposes for man.”163

What is unveiled to our understanding is an intimate but previously
hidden glimpse of the process by which the Will was begotten as a result of
a “mystic intercourse” between the divine minds of Bahá’u’lláh and ‘Abdu’l-
Bahá, the former, “the Originator,” who releases the active, creative impulse
that initially generated the Will and Testament, and the latter, “the
Interpreter,”who is its worthy and ready recipient and who brought it into
being:

> “The creative energies released by the Law of Bahá’u’lláh,
> permeating and evolving within the mind of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, have,
> by their very impact and close interaction, given birth to an
> Instrument which may be viewed as the Charter of the New World
> Order which is at once the glory and the promise of this most great
> Dispensation. The Will may thus be acclaimed as the inevitable
> offspring resulting from that mystic intercourse between Him Who
> communicated the generating influence of His divine Purpose and
the One Who was its vehicle and chosen recipient. Being the Child

> of the Covenant — the Heir of both the Originator and the
> Interpreter of the Law of God — the Will and Testament of
> ‘Abdu’l-Bahá can no more be divorced from Him Who supplied
> the original and motivating impulse than from the One Who
> ultimately conceived it. Bahá’u’lláh’s inscrutable purpose, we must
> ever bear in mind, has been so thoroughly infused into the conduct
> of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, and their motives have been so closely wedded
> together, that the mere attempt to dissociate the teachings of the
> former from any system which the ideal Exemplar of those same
> teachings has established would amount to a repudiation of one of
> the most sacred and basic truths of the Faith.”164

The Sacred Marriage Metaphor
The above passage describes the genesis of the Will and Testament as a
mystical process. While in one sense, this process is unique since it pertains
to the Bahá’í Faith alone, in a larger sense, Shoghi Effendi’s language may
be seen to allude to a religious discourse stemming from the Judeo-Christian
tradition. The question as to whether this allusiveness has occurred
consciously or not to Shoghi Effendi is left aside for obvious reasons. We
should remember, however, that inspiration notwithstanding, the Guardian
was addressing himself to a western audience. It should come as no surprise,
consequently, that his writing should contain some intertextual religious
allusions with which western readers would be familiar. No hard argument
is being made here that the language chosen by Shoghi Effendi depends
directly upon this religious background. The effectiveness of this passage
is, however, greater when the religio-literary background of his readers is
taken into consideration. I have argued in Chapter 6 that the Guardian’s
prose is multi-layered. These additional layers from the Judeo-Christian
tradition may be perceived with this text to the extent that the reader is
aware of them.

The three phenomena that would resonate for western readers would
be: (1) the concept of divine law (2) a nativity or birthing scene (2) a
sacred marriage. The reference to the “Law” recalls the law given by
Moses on Sinai. The nativity or birthing scene has, of course, associations
with the birth of the Christ Child. The concept of the sacred marriage
(heiros gamos) has older associations that date back to classical Greece.
The best known example that was ritualistically celebrated and reenacted
in various locations in ancient Greece was that of Zeus and Hera, a ritual

that had fertility motives.165 Christianity, however, had its own sacred
marriage in the persons of Mary and Joseph, whom the Gospel depicts as
obedient and favored servants of the Lord. Sacred or spiritual marriage
also has roots in the tradition of western Christian mystics such as St.
Theresa of Avila (1515-1582) in her work The Interior Castle166 and St.
Catherine of Genoa, who founded that city’s first hospital in 1477, in
Brother Lawrence, Ruysbroeck, Luis de León, Elizabeth de la Trinité
and John Tauler. The genesis of the Will, “the Charter of the New World
Order,” through the “mystic intercourse” of the minds of Bahá’u’lláh
and ‘Abdu’l-Bahá is based upon a metaphor of procreation. However,
Shoghi Effendi’s reference to “mystic intercourse,” while it suggests
human analogies, obviously transcends gender associations since “the
Child of the Covenant” has been generated by two male sacred figures. A
more specific reference to sacred marriage is found elsewhere in the
Guardian’s writings. He writes that the revelation of the Kitáb-i-Aqdas is
the fulfilment of St. John the Divine’s allusion in the Apocalypse to the
“Bride”167 (Rev.21:9), “the Lamb’s wife” (v.9), which one of the seven
angels shows to St. John, and which the subsequent verse reveals to be
nothing other than the celestial city, “that great city, the holy Jerusalem,
descending out of heaven from God.” (v.10).

When the Guardian uses the mystical language of a sacred marriage
between the minds of Bahá’u’lláh and ‘Abdu’l-Bahá to explain the origins
of the Will and Testament, he is harking back to an ancient biblical and
post-biblical mystical symbolism that make his elucidations more
susceptible to sympathetic understanding by his western readers. To isolate
examples for purposes of identification, sacred marriage, conception and
nativity imagery are reflected particularly in the expressions “...the inevitable
offspring...the Child of the Covenant...from the One Who ultimately
conceived it....” Shoghi Effendi develops further the metaphor of the divine
child of the Will and Testament when he affirms that “The Administrative
Order...may be considered as the framework of the Will itself, the inviolable
stronghold wherein this new born child is being nurtured and developed.”168
Sacred marriage language is reflected in such phrases as “....so closely
wedded together” and... “can no more be divorced...” Generative imagery
is found further in the expressions “...The creative energies released” and
“...the original and motivating impulse...”169 “The creative energies released
by the Law of Bahá’u’lláh, permeating and evolving within the mind of
‘Abdu’l-Bahá, have, by their very impact and close interaction, given birth

to an Instrument which may be viewed as the Charter of the New World
Order which is at once the glory and the promise of this most great
Dispensation.”170 Such language serves as a familiar context which situates
the Bahá’í-specific discourse and facilitates identification with it.

Personal and Impersonal Modes of Speech
The Guardian’s generative imagery has another noteworthy feature; the
synthesis of personal and impersonal modes of speech. Conception-nativity
and sacred marriage language is highly personal language, whether it refers
to mother-child, husband-wife, lover-beloved or soul-Creator relationships.
In this context, however, while the loving, mystical dimensions of unity
and creativity are retained between Father and Son, the generative process
of “mystic intercourse” between two male sacred figures produces a
document, the Will and Testament (impersonal). Yet in Shoghi Effendi’s
parlance, this document is “...the Child of the Covenant...” (personal). Thus,
a great charter of world order becomes the offspring of the Covenant. The
organic allusion is retained, nonetheless, because the divine institutions
that the Will has generated are living things that bring life to humanity. The
Guardian also writes that ‘Abdu’l-Bahá “...incarnates an institution for
which we can find no parallel whatsoever in any of the world’s recognized
religious systems....”171 This also is a synthesis of the personal and
impersonal modes of discourse. While Shoghi Effendi’s reference to
‘Abdu’l-Bahá as an institution would be normally atypical in common
speech, it reflects a sociological understanding that describes a towering
figure who over successive generations exhibits a “factor of persistence.”172
If impersonal and personal modes are juxtaposed, such things as “Law,”
“Instrument,” “Charter,” “New World Order,” “Dispensation” are
harmonised in the same context with such images as “Child,” “Heir,”
“Exemplar” and “so closely wedded together.”

Backhanded Warnings Against Autocracy, Special Privilege,
Bureaucracy and Corruption
Arguably, Shoghi Effendi sometimes issued backhanded warnings to the
Bahá’í community in his various condemnations of the ways of the old
world order. The following critique of episcopal authority may contain an
implicit warning for all Bahá’í institutions: “... the total absence of episcopal
authority with its attendant privileges, corruptions and bureaucratic
tendencies, are further evidences of the non autocratic character of the

Bahá’í Administrative Order and of its inclination to democratic methods
in the administration of its affairs.”173 This statement may serve, not only
as a point of distinction between Bahá’í and ecclesiastical governance, but
also as a standard of behaviour for Bahá’í institutions and the officers who
serve them. His words may serve as admonition that autocracy, bureaucracy,
special privilege and corruption should never be allowed to infect and
impede the good functioning of the Administrative Order.

The above comparison may be extended beyond the Christian Church
to include the larger record of the history of religion which has been soiled
with abuse. Taking an anti-dogmatic, anti-technocratic stance, and in a bid
to unite the healing properties of psychoanalysis with the best religious
ideals of East and West, Erich Fromm wrote the following in Psychoanalysis
and Religion (1950), a book which is still very timely. Fromm’s judgment
buttresses that of Shoghi Effendi:

> It is the tragedy of all great religions that they violate and pervert
> the very principles of freedom as soon as they become mass
> organizations governed by a religious bureaucracy. The religious
> organization and the men who represent it take over to some extent
> the place of family, tribe, and state. They keep man in bondages
> instead of leaving him free. It is no longer God who is worshipped
but the group that claims to speak in his name.174

In addition to his critique of the abuses of “episcopal authority,” Shoghi
Effendi’s remarks serve both as axiom and antidote for the all-too-easy
tendency of the religious institution to settle in, to become an end in itself,
and to lose sight of its divine purpose: “Now that they (the American believers)
have erected the administrative machinery of the Cause they must put it to its
real use—serving only as an instrument to facilitate the flow of the spirit of
the Faith out into the world.”175 This exhortation requires the necessary
maintenance of a synergistic relationship between spirit and form, between
the unhampered forces of freely flowing inspiration and spontaneity, and the
requirement to channel spiritual strivings in a productive and efficient fashion.
The Guardian writes of the need to allow for “...the influxes and goings forth
of the spirit...” on the one hand, and of the necessity to avoid “...disordered
and disorganized activity....” on the other. His solution is the “...the wisdom
secured through consultation and also the lights of real unity.”176

Contrary to the inclinations of the practitioners of New Age spirituality,
the Bahá’í religion is indeed organised. However, the ideal it proposes is a

living, organic, growth model rather than a robotic, monolithic and inflexible
one. Once this fundamental point is understood, and the distinctive principles
grounding this organization are clearly apprehended, it becomes clear that
the Administrative Order is designed to promote the optimum growth of
the Bahá’í Faith, and to serve the needs of the community with maximum
efficiency. In this regard, Shoghi Effendi’s secretary wrote on his behalf:

> The N.S.A. should do all in its power to foster unity among the
> believers, and to educate them in the administration as this is the
> channel through which their community life must flow, and which,
> when properly understood and practised, will enable the work of
> the Cause to go ahead by leaps and bounds.177

Canadian anthropologist Jameson Bond in his paper “The Vision of
Shoghi Effendi and the Unfoldment of the Tablets of the Divine Plan”178
contrasts the idea of the dynamic organic growth model with the static
inorganic one and points to the principle of “spiritual causality” as being
the root-cause that produces “...social, economic, and political effects.”
Mr. Bond writes:

> One of the theses that recurs in the Guardian’s writings is the law
> of spiritual causality. Those of us who live in sensate, industrialized

Bearing in mind the fact that it is at present an experimental, organic
growth model that develops, inter alia, through the method of trial and
error, the Administrative Order remains rooted in this principle of spiritual
causality.
