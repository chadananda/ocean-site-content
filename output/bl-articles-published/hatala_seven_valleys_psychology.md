Bahá’u’lláh’s Seven Valleys and
Developmental Psychology: Toward
a Conception of Spiritual
Development
ANDREW R. HATALA

Abstract
Previous research outlines the processes of human development with significant
detail, including biological, cognitive, and spiritual domains. In contemporary
developmental discourse, however, Bahá’í perspectives on spiritual development
are virtually nonexistent. In the Seven Valleys, Bahá’u’lláh, the founder of the
Bahá’í faith, offers many insights regarding the dynamics of spiritual develop-
ment. Through a focused study of Bahá’u’lláh’s Seven Valleys, this paper (1) cre-
ates a dialogue between classical and contemporary theories of developmental
psychology and Bahá’í philosophical perspectives, (2) explores the evolution of
the “self,” and (3) examines the emergence of spiritual striving in human phy-
logeny and ontogeny. Overall, it is argued that developmental studies may ben-
efit from a deeper understanding of spiritual development as a core domain of
human life.

Résumé
La recherche antérieure souligne en détail les processus du développement humain,
y compris dans les domaines biologique, cognitif et spirituel. Cependant, dans le
discours contemporain sur le développement, les points de vue bahá’ís sur le
développement spirituel sont pratiquement inexistants. Dans Les Sept vallées,
Bahá’u’lláh, le fondateur de la foi bahá’íe, offre de nouvelles perspectives concer-
nant la dynamique du développement spirituel. Par une étude des Sept vallées de
Bahá’u’lláh, l’auteur de cet article (1) crée un dialogue entre les théories classiques
et contemporaines en psychologie du développement et les perspectives philoso-
phiques bahá’íes; (2) explore l’évolution du « soi », et (3) examine l’émergence

d’une aspiration spirituelle en phylogénie et en ontogénie humaines. L’auteur fait
essentiellement valoir que les études en psychologie du développement pourraient
bénéficier d’une compréhension plus approfondie du développement spirituel en
tant qu’aspect fondamental de la vie humaine.

Resumen
Investigaciones previas bosquejan los procesos de desarrollo humano con detalles
significativos, incluyendo dominios biológicos, cognitivos y espirituales. En el dis-
curso contemporáneo de desarrollo, sin embargo, las perspectivas Bahá’ís acerca
del desarrollo espiritual básicamente no están en evidencia. En los Siete Valles,
Bahá’u’lláh, el fundador de la Fe Bahá’í, ofrece varios puntos de vista acerca de las
dinámicas del desarrollo espiritual. A través de un estudio enfocado de los Siete
Valles de Bahá’u’lláh, este ensayo (1) crea un diálogo entre teorías clásicas y con-
temporáneas de la psicología de desarrollo y perspectivas Bahá’ís filosóficas, (2)
explora la evolución del “yo,” y (3) examina la aparición de esfuerzos espirituales
en la filogenia y ontogenia humana. En general, se argumenta que los estudios
acerca del desarrollo se pueden beneficiar de una comprensión más profunda del
desarrollo espiritual como un dominio central de la vida humana.

The processes of development have fascinated humans for millennia, as
evident in various literary works, cultural myths, artistic expressions, or
fairy tales that portray heroes and heroines undergoing transformations
across the life course.1 Today, developmental psychologists continue to
outline, observe, and theorize about the various elements related to human
development, predominantly in relation to biological, psychological,
social, and spiritual domains. Over the last few decades in particular, psy-
chological discourse increasingly has recognized the importance of spiri-
tual development in the lives of many diverse peoples, not only because of
its observed association to psychological, social, and biological domains,
but also because of its own purview comprising a unique existential
dimension of human experience involving a purpose or deeper meaning in
life.2 Although research in this area has grown over the years, a deeper
exploration of several key questions is warranted: (1) how should spiritu-
al development most appropriately be conceptualized? (2) What is univer-
sal and what is culturally situated with respect to spiritual development?

Bahá’u’lláh’s Seven Valleys and Developmental Psychology           31

(3) What are the factors that trigger, cause, foster, or support spiritual
development? (4) What is the purpose or goal of spiritual development?
And (5) how is spiritual development related to biological processes in
both ontogeny and phylogeny?

The purpose of this paper is to address these questions by drawing
insights from the Writings of the Bahá’í Faith in order to create a dialogue
between Bahá’í conceptions of spiritual development and contemporary
theories in developmental psychology. As the Bahá’í Faith is the most
recent of the world religions, its perspectives regarding spiritual develop-
ment have been examined in developmental discourse only to a limited
extent. Drawing insights from the Bahá’í Faith is therefore important, not
only to augment the already rich developmental literature in this area, but
also because of the vast writings on spiritual development and the spiritu-
al dimension of human existence found within the Bahá’í Faith.

In several detailed Writings, Bahá’u’lláh, the founder of the Bahá’í
Faith, outlines the process of spiritual development as a human univer-
sal, yet at the same time describes its unique dramatization in ways rel-
ative to each individual’s historical, cultural, and experiential situations.
Spiritual development understood in this way joins the mounting scien-
tific and philosophical discourses—such as works by Bernstein, Bohm,
Lample, Medina, Smith and Karlberg, and Rogoff—arguing, in recent
years, for a “dialectical” approach to problem solving and the investiga-
tion of reality. From this vantage point, human development is simulta-
neously universal and relative, cultural and biological, linear and circu-
lar, mechanistic and organic. It is all and none of these. The theoretical
lens therefore adopted for the following analysis is referred to as an
integrative-holistic or a unity-in-diversity perspective, which is inherently
multidisciplinary and multiparadigmatic, assuming equality within all
levels of analysis (that is, genetics, neurological structures, psychologi-
cal traits, families, peer groups, and broader contextual influences like
culture and ethnicity), thereby attempting to dismantle conceptual bor-
ders between nature and nurture, biology and psychology, qualia and
quanta, or science and spirituality.

Bahá’u’lláh’s mystical work entitled “The Seven Valleys” is the pri-
mary source for this paper, as it explores in detail the processes of spir-
itual development. The description drawn from the Seven Valleys is also
complemented by other texts from the Bahá’í Writings where applicable,
namely the work of Bahá’u’lláh’s son ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, as well as the work
of philosopher and Bahá’í scholar William Hatcher. This paper is com-
posed of four complementary yet distinct sections. First, I briefly
describe and summarize Bahá’u’lláh’s depiction of the journey of the
soul through the Seven Valleys. Second, a dialogue between the spiritu-
al development processes as outlined in the Seven Valleys and contem-
porary psychological theories of human development occurs. Following
this, I discuss the conceptualization of the “self ” as presented in the
Seven Valleys and its relation to contemporary theories of the self—in
particular, Kegan’s theory of the evolving self. The final section discuss-
es “spiritual phylogeny” in relation to ontogeny and other contemporary
theories of evolution and human sociocultural development.

THE SEVEN VALLEYS

The Seven Valleys stands out among Bahá’u’lláh’s works as the most
prominent of His mystical Writings. Bahá’u’lláh’s composition emerged
between 1874 and 1875 in response to the questions of a Sufi judge per-
taining to the journey of the soul. The seven stages of the spiritual jour-
ney were already familiar to Sufis at that time, having been described by
‘At.t.ár in his Conference of the Birds some seven centuries earlier.3 Thus
Bahá’u’lláh relates His general acceptance of ‘At.t.ár’s seven stages by
responding to the Sufi’s question in an already familiar style. The gener-
al theme involves an individual’s or “wayfarer’s”4 journey of the soul
through advancing stages of overcoming selfish tendencies or an identity
founded in the limitations of the phenomenal world and thus discovering
a true identity in the realms of nearness to the Creator and solidarity with
all reality. The Seven Valleys illustrate a compounding sequence of trans-
formational experiences that facilitate and propel individual efforts to
develop spiritual capacities.

Bahá’u’lláh’s Seven Valleys and Developmental Psychology             33

The first of Bahá’u’lláh’s stages is the Valley of Search, wherein the way-
farer desperately seeks his Beloved or Creator in all places and all regions:
“In every face, he seeketh the beauty of the Friend; in every country he
looketh for the Beloved” (The Seven Valleys 7). A central quality within this
valley is patience. The wayfarer is said to reach nowhere and to attain no
goal without remaining firm in the search for the loved one amid all dis-
tractions. Apart from patience, determination, sacrifice, effort, and focus
on the goal are also crucial: “Nor shall the seeker reach his goal unless he
sacrifice all things. That is, whatever he hath seen, and heard, and under-
stood, all must he set at naught, that he may enter the realm of the spirit,
which is the City of God. Labor is needed, if we are to seek Him; ardor is
needed, if we are to drink of the honey of reunion with Him” (7). Here
Bahá’u’lláh describes the path which the wayfarer must take to attain his
object. Once a trace of the traceless Friend has been found, the wayfarer
enters the Valley of Love.

In the Valley of Love the wayfarer, after witnessing a glimpse of his
Beloved, becomes like a moth which has found a flame. Longing to reach
it, the moth circles around and around, coming closer until it is finally
burnt in a brilliant blaze of sacrifice.5 Here the heart of the wayfarer is
touched by his Beloved and he has fallen in love. Neither reason nor proof
settles his excitement: “when the fire of love is ablaze, it burneth to ashes
the harvest of reason” (8). This stage marks the beginning of the wayfar-
er taking leave of self in order to find refuge with the Beloved, a process
of self-sacrifice that is coupled with pain. Indeed, the “steed of this valley”
is said to be pain and until pain is experienced—like the moth drawn into
the flame—the journey will never end. Once this pain of dying to the self
is realized, the wayfarer gains understanding and progresses to the next
stage of his journey.

The third stage is the Valley of Knowledge,6 where the inner eye is opened,
allowing the wayfarer to understand the mystery of resurrection. That is,
the wayfarer finds meaning in death and sees the end in all things. The
soul in this valley witnesses a greater perspective of truth and reaches the
stage of certitude. The wayfarer is not troubled when faced with pain and
calamities. Rather, he will approach them with understanding and recog-

34            The Journal of Bahá’í Studies 21. 1/4. 2011

nition for he can see the end in the beginning and discovers a hidden bless-
ing and mercy within suffering and tribulation. “In this station he is con-
tent with the decree of God, and seeth war as peace, and findeth in death
the secrets of everlasting life” (12). Once this new insight is gained, the
wayfarer can leave the plane of limitation and ascend into the next stage
of his journey.

In the Valley of Unity the wayfarer “drinketh from the cup of the
Absolute,” “pierceth the veils of plurality,” and “ascendeth into the heaven
of singleness” (17). The wayfarer, like an eagle looking down on the earth
with an all-encompassing vision, is freed from the cage of self, released
from limitation, and enters into the plane of universality. His vision has
widened to such a degree that he no longer sees the phenomenal world
subjectively, limited by his own vision, but rather he sees an objective real-
ity through the eyes of the Absolute. With this vision the wayfarer discov-
ers that each created thing in the world manifests some attributes of the
Creator—the degree of which depends on its capacity and differs with
respect to its kingdom. From here the wayfarer sees knowledge as a sin-
gle point and realizes that it is only the ignorant that have sought to mul-
tiply it. This new vision instills a sense of peace and calmness that initi-
ates entrance into the fifth valley.

With respect to the Valley of Contentment and the later valleys, “the
tongue faileth in describing these three valleys, and speech falleth short.
The pen steppeth not into this region, the ink leaveth only a blot” (30).
The Valley of Contentment is marked by true happiness that results from
detachment of the world and independence from all things. Joy that was
once found in the delights and pleasures of the world is understood to be
transitory, thus the wayfarer in this realm holds fast to the hem of the
Absolute. Only the wayfarer that has entered this valley has experienced
true joy, even though to outward eyes his life is saturated with affliction
and suffering. After being content as a result of his detachment from the
world, the wayfarer experiences a sense of wonder.

In the Valley of Wonderment the wayfarer is said to be struck dumb with
the beauty and wonder of the Beloved: “at every moment he beholdeth a
wondrous world, a new creation, and goeth from astonishment to aston-

Bahá’u’lláh’s Seven Valleys and Developmental Psychology            35

ishment, and is lost in awe at the works of the Lord of Oneness” (32). Like
a person who begins to fathom the vastness of the universe, the wayfarer
in this valley begins to grasp the immensity and infinite range of creation.
He discovers the inner mysteries of the Creator and is led from each mys-
tery to a thousand more. No description can encapsulate the wonders of
this stage, but after experiencing the wonder of the Beloved the wayfarer
moves toward the final valley on his spiritual journey.

In the Valley of True Poverty and Absolute Nothingness, which is the fur-
thest state of the mystic knower, the wayfarer dies to the self to find life
in God. “Yea, all he hath, from heart to skin, will be set aflame, so that
nothing will remain save the Friend” (36). This station marks the culmi-
nation of the journey away from the phenomenal world toward the world
of the Absolute. The wayfarer is now sanctified from all that exists in the
world of creation while at the same time experiences a sense of oneness
with all things: “Ecstasy alone can encompass this theme, not utterance
nor argument” (39). The wayfarer has now reached the ultimate goal of
his search and exists within the realms of nearness to the Creator and sol-
idarity with all reality.

SPIRITUAL DEVELOPMENT

According to William Hatcher, the prime condition for the process of spir-
itual development to occur is the awareness that the process is useful, nec-
essary, and realistically possible. In other words, for an individual to enter
the Seven Valleys and to begin the process of their search they must
become alert to or recognize the objective existence of the spiritual or
Absolute dimensions of reality. Bahá’u’lláh, however, asserts that human
knowledge of Absolute Reality is an impossibility, and instead suggests
that knowledge of the Manifestations of God—such as Krishna, Jesus,
Buddha, Moses, Bahá’u’lláh, and others—is equivalent to the knowledge of
the Absolute. Manifestations of God, therefore, constitute an aspect of
observable reality that can potentially lead humans to the knowledge and
awareness of the spiritual dimension of existence.7 Spiritual development is
therefore described in Bahá’u’lláh’s Seven Valleys as a conscious, self-

36             The Journal of Bahá’í Studies 21. 1/4. 2011

directed, autonomous process involving the search for spiritual aspects of
reality. Certain terms used to describe the spiritual journey, such as becom-
ing more “self-aware” or “enlightened,” essentially reflect its “conscious”
nature.

THE ORIGINS OF SPIRITUAL DEVELOPMENT

Due to this conscious aspect, spiritual development as outlined in the
Seven Valleys arguably follows certain biological milestones, such as for-
mal operational abilities that allow for a sense of agency, identity, or self
to manifest. Indeed, Bahá’u’lláh’s son ‘Abdu’l-Bahá suggests, “The suck-
ling babe passeth through various physical stages, growing and develop-
ing at every stage, until its body reacheth the age of maturity. Having
arrived at this stage it aquireth the capacity to manifest spiritual and intel-
lectual perfections. The lights of comprehension, intelligence and knowl-
edge become perceptible in it and the powers of the soul unfold” (Selections
285). From this perspective, the origins of spiritual development are nec-
essarily dependent on certain biological processes that emerge or solidify
in and around the developmental period of adolescence, making the con-
scious aspect of spiritual development possible.

Within contemporary developmental literature, neuropsychologists
and researchers Newberg and Newberg observe that the period of adoles-
cence typically involves the solidification of certain metabolic brain struc-
tures, making possible the basic tenets of personhood including identity,
worldview, ideology, and most importantly a sense of agency. In addition,
Tilman Habermas and Susan Bluck, researchers at the Max Planck
Institute for Human Development, suggest that during adolescence
humans develop certain cognitive tools (formal operational abilities) that
facilitate the appearance of what they term the narrated self, thereby allow-
ing individuals to create causal coherence in the individual life story by ref-
erence to a single or a few central self-characteristics. In other words, bio-
logical processes during adolescence allow for or foster a distinct identity
that can be held as a referent through history and changing contexts.
Other psychological researchers have also examined the extent to which

Bahá’u’lláh’s Seven Valleys and Developmental Psychology            37

adolescence is a “sensitive period” for the development of spirituality. Good
and Willoughby, for example, suggest that the normative developmental
characteristics for adolescence make teenagers particularly responsive to
spiritual overtures. Based on their review, Good and Willoughby argue that
the period of adolescence involves, more than other age categories, a
propensity towards spiritual explorations, conversion experiences, and
spiritual commitments that endure throughout the life span. Similarly, a
recent qualitative study by Kelley, Athan, and Miller, involving a religious-
ly and ethnically diverse sample of adolescents (N = 130), also highlights
the importance of openness and spiritual striving for adolescents during
this important time of self-discovery.

Overall, the origins of spiritual development as a self-directed conscious
process in both contemporary developmental literature as well as
Bahá’u’lláh’s Seven Valleys are similar. In both cases, particular aspects of
the human spiritual nature required for development, such as agency,
autonomy, or self-identity, may develop only after certain biological
processes have occurred during the period of adolescence. The origins of
both biological and spiritual development, therefore, may be traced to dis-
tinct periods during one’s overall life cycle.8

THE ENGINE OF GROWTH

The transition between developmental stages of Bahá’u’lláh’s Seven
Valleys can be described as the interaction between binary tensions. Like
a magnetic motor that oscillates based on the negative and positive poles
of the magnets within, so too spiritual development is driven, from a num-
ber of different perspectives, by the oscillating tensions of opposing forces.
From one perspective, this binary tension can be expressed as a cognitive
process, between the known and unknown, in something akin to Jean
Piaget’s equilibration.9 Equilibration, from Piaget’s cognitive theories, is
the notion that from birth until about two years old, children investigate
their reality through a dialogue between assimilation—where we use our
current schemes to interpret the external world—and accommodation—
where we create new schemes or adjust old ones after noticing that our

38            The Journal of Bahá’í Studies 21. 1/4. 2011

current way of thinking does not capture the environment completely.
Similarly, in Bahá’u’lláh’s Valley of Search the wayfarer must “cleanse the
heart—which is the wellspring of divine treasures—from every marking,
and that they turn away from imitation, which is following the traces of
their forefathers” (The Seven Valleys 5). Here, spiritual development is a
consequence of the tension between the known and the unknown aspects
of reality. To progress spiritually, wayfarers must successfully navigate
between assimilation and accommodation in order to construct a more
complete vision of the world.

Although Piaget’s cognitive equilibration reflects characteristics of
spiritual development, his original model emerged through observing
children as they began to interact with the material world.10 The equili-
bration process in spiritual development differs significantly insofar as it
involves the individual’s beginning interactions with the spiritual dimen-
sions of reality. In this way, the Valley of Search could be described as the
stage in which an individual comprehends and scientifically investigates
the spiritual dimensions of reality or the Manifestations of God—a
process that William Hatcher argues ultimately forms the foundation of
and prime condition for spirituality.

Another interesting and perhaps more obvious binary tension exists
between the material and spiritual aspects of human reality.11 In his paper
The Concept of Spirituality, Hatcher argues that the material and spiritual
duality is a “creative tension purposely given by God, a tension whose
function it is constantly to remind the individual of the necessity of mak-
ing an effort in the path of spiritual growth” (6). When driven by the
desire to satisfy physical or material needs, humans can become aggressive
towards others and thus insensitive towards their needs—a process
depicted all too often by Freud.12 Overcoming these biological tendencies
requires an individual to engage in a daily struggle with himself in order
to maintain the “proper” spiritual perspective on life. Prayer, meditation or
regular scripture reading, and communication with the spiritual aspects of
reality, thus become central aspects of spiritual development insofar as
they help individuals center on spiritual existence. In other words, the
conscious centering of oneself on the spiritual dimensions of existence

(that is, prayer) assists individuals to overcome biological tendencies and
material needs.13 Indeed, this aspect is most clearly represented in the
transition between the Valley of Knowledge and the Valley of Unity,
wherein the individual initiates prayer in order to transcend the plane of
limitation and arrive within the plane of unity. Overall, then, spiritual
development can occur as a result of the tension between material and
spiritual human domains; that is, when biological or material tendencies
and desires arise, they create an opportunity to respond to the situation by
centering one’s thoughts on higher realms of spiritual existence.

Looking at the Seven Valleys as a whole, binary tensions are also wit-
nessed between self/other, independence/interdependence, disintegra-
tion/integration, visible/invisible, plurality/unity, potentiality/actuality,
doubt/certitude, being/nonbeing, death/life, annihilation/substance, and
finite/infinite. Within each stage of Bahá’u’lláh’s Seven Valleys, a tension
between a distinct pair of binary opposites excites transitions toward the
subsequent stages. For example, in the Valley of Search the wayfarer must
travel away from self to move towards the Beloved. In the Valley of Love
the wayfarer experiences pain as a requisite to the joys of love. In the
Valley of Knowledge one must learn to see beyond the immediate suffer-
ing of existence to attain true knowledge of being. In the Valley of Unity
the wayfarer must learn to see the unity of all things within the plurality
of creation. In the Valley of Contentment the wayfarer becomes poor in
the world to attain true wealth. In the Valley of Wonderment the wayfar-
er’s own categories are destroyed in order to expose divine reality. In the
final valley, nothingness in the world becomes the precondition for subsis-
tence in God. Within each stage, a binary tension is experienced which
creates the potential for growth.

In terms of developmental psychology, this binary logic is familiar.

Abraham Maslow, for instance, argued that spiritual development occurs
dialectically between growth-inhibiting forces and growth-fostering
forces. Maslow suggests that growth must entail both reward and suffer-
ing and that from a developmental perspective both poles are mutually
co-constitutive. Similarly, Erik Erikson’s psychosocial theory of develop-
ment commonly employs a binary tension that is to be resolved at each

40            The Journal of Bahá’í Studies 21. 1/4. 2011

successive stage of development.14 A core aspect present within Erikson’s
theory of the life cycle is the idea of a test as the motivator for develop-
ment and growth. Accordingly, psychosocial development occurs at eight
critical periods in a person’s life where the individual comes face to face
with a test—what Erikson terms a crisis.15 According to Erikson, we can
respond to the test appropriately so that a corresponding virtue emerges;
if not, a corresponding failing will ensue. In this way, the test occurs as
the result of binary tensions within each of his developing stages. From
yet another perspective, the transition between James Fowler’s faith
stages is also propelled by a similar binary tension or what he terms dis-
illusionment. From Fowler’s ethnographic research involving some three
hundred interviews, he outlined six stages of faith development that indi-
viduals traverse during the course of their lives.16 Fowler observes, for
example, that the transition between stage four (individuative-reflective
faith) and stage five (conjunctive faith) is the direct result of conflict
between the compromises in stage four involving clear logic of distinc-
tions and the recognition that life is more complex. This disillusionment
with one’s current understanding in stage four propels an individual
toward a more dialectical and multi-leveled approach to truth as appar-
ent in stage five.

To sum, it is evident that a logic of binary tensions or “tests” used to
describe the process of growth is employed in Bahá’u’lláh’s Seven Valleys
as well as several theories in developmental psychology. Although these
similarities are striking, it is important to note that distinctions exist.
Bahá’u’lláh, Erikson, Piaget, Maslow, and Fowler together share the per-
spective that a test results from the discrepancy between binary tensions,
which further instills an opportunity for growth and development. These
perspectives differ, however, in the sense that Bahá’u’lláh invokes a spiri-
tual plane of reality that substantiates the reward of the test (that is, the
individual will progress towards God or Absolute Reality), whereas
Erikson, Piaget, Maslow, and Fowler primarily suggest that the reward of
a test or binary tension consists of a greater perspective of life, psycholog-
ical satisfaction, or existential well-being. Furthermore, within Bahá’-
u’lláh’s Seven Valleys, growth occurs not only by individual efforts alone

but also with the help and grace of God, the Creator. This notion that spir-
itual forces beyond the physical plane can drive development is virtually
absent from the previously outlined developmental theories. A deeper
understanding of how this non-material or Absolute aspect of reality
interacts with material reality to incite spiritual development may be an
important area for future research.

THE STRUCTURE OF DEVELOPMENT

As Fowler notes, developmental theorists typically depict “everyperson’s”
stories. Their categories of description are necessarily formal, general, and
without specific content. The developmental narrative presented in Bahá’-
u’lláh’s Seven Valleys holds true to Fowler’s claim—the direction of spir-
itual growth is universally towards the (unattainable) ideal of Absolute
perfection. The structure of spiritual development, however, as presented
in Bahá’u’lláh’s Seven Valleys, is simultaneously mechanistic and organic,
continuous and discontinuous, changing and unchanging. On the one
hand, there is what developmental psychologist Richard M. Lerner would
call a strong “organismic bias” or discontinuity between the respective
valleys insofar as the stages form an invariant sequence and no one can
skip a stage.17 Moreover, distinct stages reflect not only quantitative
(knowing more) variations, but also qualitative (a different way of know-
ing) variations, and the latter stages have at their disposal all the knowl-
edge and abilities gained from earlier stages.18

This organismic stance is strongly reminiscent of cognitive develop-
mental paradigms (such as those of Piaget, Erikson, and Kohlberg). On
the other hand, however, spiritual development reflects what Lerner
would call a mechanistic bias, that is, a linear, continuous, or gradual pro-
gression over time. From here a stable core of the spiritual self or soul
gradually develops to reflect greater degrees of perfection already pres-
ent within. This perspective is also supported by ‘Abdu’l-Bahá when He
suggests that the “growth and development of all beings is gradual; this
is the universal divine organization and the natural system (Selections
198–99). On this note, Rhett Diessner argues that if we apply dialectical

42             The Journal of Bahá’í Studies 21. 1/4. 2011

reasoning, the process of development becomes simultaneously mecha-
nistic and organismic: “To be able to distinguish change or development,
it is necessary to demonstrate, at minimum, differences in an organism
overtime. As soon as this is accomplished, then at least two stages exists.
To understand the relationship between the prior and latter states, devel-
opment must in some way be continuous and circular, or the being would
have no continuity of identity” (5). From this perspective, spiritual devel-
opment becomes a hybrid of mechanistic and organismic perspectives.
Perhaps what is required is an exponential conceptualization of spiritual
development in order to dismantle apparent discrepancies between mech-
anistic and organismic perspectives.19

Hatcher puts forward the idea that development is not linear but expo-
nential, wherein the rate of change necessarily changes, while an inter-
nal core endures. In an exponential process of growth, the rate of change
at the beginning is small but gradually increases until a sort of satura-
tion point is reached. The metaphorical depiction of distance in the
Seven Valleys clearly illustrates this process. In the first two valleys, the
wayfarer requires a steed or horse to traverse the extensive distance
between him and his goal, the Beloved. After these first two valleys,
however, the process becomes easier on foot. Finally, after leaving the
plane of limitation (the Valley of Love), the remaining four valleys rep-
resent differing degrees of intimacy with the Beloved as the spatial
metaphor begins to break down.20 This metaphorical distance imagery
essentially depicts an exponential process where the rate of change
varies (discontinuous– organismic) but the wayfarer remains (continuity–
mechanistic).

The idea of exponential development also sheds light on the view that
the process of the Seven Valleys is simultaneously changing and unchang-
ing. In the first three valleys, the wayfarer witnesses change and transfor-
mation within the phenomenal world. Once in the Valley of Unity, howev-
er, it is clear “that all the variations which the wayfarer in the stages of his
journey beholdeth in the realms of being, proceed from his own vision”
(Bahá’u’lláh, The Seven Valleys 18). That is, once a certain saturation point
on the journey is reached—signified as the emergence into the plane of

universality—the wayfarer sees all things as emanating from the change-
less essence of the Absolute. From the exponential or distance metaphors,
this occurs at the point when the horizontal movement entirely subsides,
giving way to vertical movement only.

Along these lines, religious scholars van der Leeuw and Steinbock
together suggest that human experience is essentially composed of both
vertical and horizontal components.21 The horizontal dimension involves
the extension of life to its uttermost limits, wherein individuals seek a
deeper, richer, or superior aspect of life. This horizontal aspect, for van der
Leeuw, essentially reflects the evolution of society and the constant tem-
poral changes of the phenomenal world. Staying within the horizontal or
temporal dimensions of reality alone, however, can obstruct the later
stages of spiritual development and instill a kind of existential anxiety. As
Steinbock suggests, people everywhere are searching for some kind of
happiness or peace in the world. Paradoxically, however, the more deeply
we involve ourselves with “temporal” distractions—that is, the whole
realm of transitory, secular, or finite things and activities on the horizon-
tal plane—the more happiness seems to elude us.

Bahá’u’lláh’s Seven Valleys addresses this paradox by suggesting that
true human happiness, and thus spiritual development, results by break-
ing through the horizontal and finite dimensions of experience into anoth-
er “vertical” realm. As Steinbock shows, when we search for “new heights
of existence,” attempt to “climb beyond” the self ’s immediate standpoint,
or become open to the “vertical givenness of experience” (220), suffering,
anxiety, and death associated with the changing horizontal or temporal
aspects of reality become the way to “salvation,” the way to our feeling a
sense of fulfillment at home in the world (221). The vertical aspects of
reality, therefore, reflect the higher stages of spiritual development where-
in reality is perceived as unchanging. The Valley of Unity in this case, sit-
uated at the mid point of the journey, possibly signifies the transition
between the world of the changing (horizontal dimension) and the world
of constancy (vertical dimension). Thus, spiritual development as an expo-
nential process involves both changing and unchanging dimensions in the
overall structure of development.

From another perspective, changing and unchanging dimensions or
continuity and discontinuity can be seen in a co-constitutive relationship
within the dynamics of spiritual development. According to medical
anthropologist Gay Becker, a disruption in the normal social order of
one’s life, such as illness or extreme catastrophe, can be understood as a
period of discontinuity that actually propels development and substanti-
ates the universal human need for continuity. In this case, the overall
metaphor of the valley itself becomes relevant, in that the “ups” and
“downs” of the valley could potentially represent the highs and lows
brought on by continuity and discontinuity, respectively. In addition to
being an exponential process, therefore, spiritual development also
includes dips and peaks within the overall journey. Moreover, these dis-
continuities or disruptions in the overall continuity of development could
reflect a state of liminality as described by anthropologist Victor Turner,
whereby an individual slips “through the network of classifications that
normally locate states and positions in cultural space” (95).

According to Turner, the liminal state reflects a kind of suffering due to
transitions between the stages of one’s life that are initiated during times
of illness or social transition which inevitably alter our assumptive per-
spectives of reality. During these liminal stages of confusion, where indi-
viduals find themselves outside the normal social order, they become “nei-
ther here nor there,” or “betwixt and between” spaces and identities (95).
Far from these stages being destructive, however, their importance,
according to Turner, lies in the innate creative forces of human imagina-
tion which are fostered or emerge in order to help transcend the bound-
aries or the structure of the normal cultural order. The overall trajectory
of spiritual development, then, inevitably involves these liminal states of
disruption wherein a test is experienced. After successfully experiencing
and navigating through the tests or liminal phases, the individuals may
advance to prior stages and development ensues.

THE GOALS OF SPIRITUAL DEVELOPMENT

The goals of Bahá’u’lláh’s Seven Valleys involve, but are not reduced to,
(1) the increase in spiritual capacity, which facilitates the (2) resolution of

dichotomous thinking that further increases (3) the knowledge of self and
(4) the union with Absolute Reality or more specifically the Manifestation
of God.22 The final stage in the Seven Valleys is the knowledge of God or
the knowledge of the Manifestation of God, which involves passing
through the realms of limitation and leaving behind the world of dichoto-
mous thinking. This knowledge does not come about as a certain cogni-
tive process, but rather it is understood as a way of being, conditional on
the ability to give up the self to exist within God or Absolute Reality.

There are similarities here between relinquishing dichotomous thinking
in the Seven Valleys and the end goals of other developmental theories.
Lawrence Kohlberg, for example, expanded Piaget’s cognitive stages to
the moral domain.23 In the sixth and final stage of Kohlberg’s theory of
moral development, the individual is driven morally from a position of
universal principles or ethics grounded in abstract conceptions of justice.
This often involves the ability to comprehend the world of paradox,
observe unity in diversity, and see the end in all things. Similarly, Maslow
suggested that self-actualized people—self-actualization being the final
goal of his developmental stages—have the ability to resolve dichotomies,
to unite opposites, and to come to the realization that dichotomous think-
ing is often immature. Furthermore, Fowler’s sixth and final stage
involves the ability to overcome paradoxical tensions by seeing the imper-
atives of absolute love and justice: “Stage 6 is exceedingly rare. The per-
sons best described by it have generated faith compositions in which their
felt sense of an ultimate environment is inclusive of all being. Their com-
munity is universal in extent. Particularities are cherished because they
are vessels of the universal, and thereby valuable apart from any utilitari-
an considerations. Life is both loved and held loosely. Such persons are
ready for fellowship with persons at any of the other stages and from any
other faith traditions” (201).

The importance of dissolving this binary logic is also depicted by
deconstructionist Buddhist scholar Park as a crucial aspect of the under-
standing of the “right view” or the “middle path,” wherein the individual
takes a mental standpoint or perspective from which inherent dichotomies
of thinking are dissolved. As before, however, important differences
between the goals in Bahá’u’lláh’s Seven Valleys and other theories of

46            The Journal of Bahá’í Studies 21. 1/4. 2011

development are the ideas of union with God or Absolute Reality.
Developmental theories presented here, and also certain deconstruction-
ist perspectives as asserted by Park, avoid ascribing developmental moti-
vation to a metaphysics of the Absolute and assert no transcendental or
ultimate reality that stands behind or somehow informs binary existence.
In contrast, the goal of spiritual development in the Seven Valleys is to
navigate these binary tensions to a state of unity where ultimate reality
can be grasped. Indeed, as Nader Saiedi notes in his reflections on
Bahá’u’lláh’s Seven Valleys, the stages of the spiritual journey are the
stages of struggle to transcend these fundamental oppositions. In this way,
the Seven Valleys importantly highlights the idea that Absolute Reality
can be known and understood through the Manifestations of God thus
bridging the gap between the known and unknown aspects of reality.
Perhaps future research on human spiritual developmental could examine
how this metaphysics of the Manifestations of God potentially demystifies
ideas of Absolute Reality so as to open the spiritual realm of existence and
spiritual development to scientific investigation.24

THE SELF IN BAHÁ’U’LLÁH’S SEVEN VALLEYS

The Seven Valleys could be understood to describe the development of the
self through seven stages. Thus, briefly reviewing some reflections on the
self will aid our overall understanding of development through the Seven
Valleys. English philosopher John Locke proposed that the self pertained
to a stable inner human core, which he called the perceiving self—a central
point of consciousness that interprets human experiences and orches-
trates both the internal life and the external being in the world. Several
hundred years later, the American philosopher and psychologist William
James rejected Locke’s stable unchanging self, suggesting that the self is
stable and coherent while at the same time changing over time and across
contexts. James proposed two functional subsystems of the self, which he
called the “I” and the “Me.” The former pertained to the volitional self or
the knower and is continuous across time. The later is described as the
socially engaged self that constantly changes and adapts to new situations

and contexts. More recently psychologists and anthropologists including
De Munck and Goffman have suggested there is no inner human core or
“I” and instead only the performative behavior or “Me” exists. For
Goffman the self is simply the behavior that is provided by what he terms
cultural stages—the scripts and masks that are provided to people by the
larger social narratives and discourses. At this point it may be argued that
the concept of the “self,” whether as an internal stable core or as an exter-
nal dynamic representation, is a universal human phenomenon. Indeed,
psychological anthropologist Jerome Bruner suggests that “perhaps the
single most universal thing about human experience is the phenomenon
of ‘Self ’” (35).

THE MATERIAL “I” AND THE SPIRITUAL “WE”

Within the Seven Valleys, Bahá’u’lláh describes two aspects of the self. On
the one hand, the self is the identity of the individual created by God or
the spiritual nature; this is inherently a positive sense and is depicted in
such writings as “true loss is for him whose days have been spent in utter
ignorance of his self ” (Bahá’u’lláh, Tablets of Bahá’u’lláh 156). On the other
hand, Bahá’u’lláh also suggests that the self is associated with the ego or
the lower nature. It is the self we must struggle against if we wish to
progress spiritually and is depicted in such writings as, “let your vision be
world embracing rather than confined to your own self ” (Tablets of
Bahá’u’lláh 86).

Placing this understanding within James’s “I/Me” distinction, it is
apparent that Bahá’u’lláh asserts two subcomponents of the “I” that exist
along a rich and dynamic continuum and correspond to the spiritual and
material aspects of humanity respectively. From this perspective, the
lower self or James’s “I” can ultimately be transcended, thus orienting the
self towards a separate spiritual category that can be separated from
James’s “I/Me” distinction as the “We.” Consequently, the self-aspect that
is in dialogue with the social world, or James’s “Me,” can thus be the man-
ifestation of either the “I” (lower nature) or the “We” (higher spiritual
nature).

48            The Journal of Bahá’í Studies 21. 1/4. 2011

If we look to Markus and Kitayama’s theory of cognitive self-constru-
als to develop the “I/We” distinction further, I would like to suggest, from
a unity-in-diversity theoretical perspective, that the independent and
interdependent organizations of the self, as presented by Markus and
Kitayama, coincide with the “I” (material) and “We” (spiritual) self-distinc-
tions, respectively. In other words, the “I” can be described by independ-
ent characteristics, whereas the “We” can be described by interdependent
characteristics. Markus and Kitayama suggested that independent self-con-
strual occurs when individual “behavior is organized and made meaning-
ful primarily by reference to one’s own internal repertoire of thoughts,
feelings, and action, rather than by reference to the thoughts, feelings, and
actions of others” (225).

On the other hand, interdependent self-construals involve “seeing oneself
as part of an encompassing social relationship and recognizing that one’s
behavior is determined, contingent on, and, to a large extent organized by
what the actor perceives to be the thoughts, feelings, and actions of others
in the relationship” (227). The argument here is that instead of thinking
of the independent self (“I”) and the interdependent self (“We”) as exter-
nal to the individual—as was suggested by Markus and Kitayama—we
should instead think of them as internally universal aspects of human
nature depicted as both the higher (spiritual) and lower (material) aspects
of the self that exist as a continuum, more so than any dichotomy. For
example, the description of the material self “I” as seen within the Bahá’í
Writings reflects a self-centeredness with regards to one’s thoughts, trou-
bles, and distress, with little or no concern for others around one.

The description of the spiritual self or “We,” on the other hand, as seen
within the end stages of the Seven Valleys, exemplifies the characteristics
of a decentered self (interdependent), highly conscious of others in a
decent, considerate, self-sacrificing, and responsible manner. By associating
the higher (decentered/”We”) nature of humanity with the interdependent
self-construal is not to assert that entire so-called interdependent popula-
tions, such as the Japanese, are completely “selfless” (although one could
make the case for this with regard to the ideologies of an empty self promi-
nent in many forms of Buddhism and Taoism). The point here is to argue

that each of these potentials (interdependent/“We” and independent/“I”)
ultimately lies within each individual along a rich and dynamic continuum
and at the same time corresponds to our spiritual and material nature,
respectively. Figure 1 visually depicts these I/We/Me distinctions.

FINDING THE SELF THROUGH SELFLESSNESS

In the journey through Bahá’u’lláh’s Seven Valleys, the human spiritual
identity or highest potentiality is actualized by moving beyond selfish per-
sonalities and limited desires. The struggle, dialogue, or interplay
between these two dynamic human aspects—as we have already seen
within the analogy of a magnetic motor—characterizes much of the spir-
itual development process. In this way, the Seven Valleys describes the
mystery of sacrifice; that is, just as the seed must perish to give way for

Fig. 1. The Selfish “I” and the Selfless “We” in the Seven Valleys
Although it appears I suggest a dichotomy between the “I” (independent) and “We”
> (interdependent) aspects of the self, I would actually suggest a continuum between the
two, wherein multiple reflections of these characteristics can occur in varying degrees

depending on the context and individual choice.
50             The Journal of Bahá’í Studies 21. 1/4. 2011

the growth of the tree, so too the movement away from the lower self (“I”)
allows the spiritual nature (“We”) to flourish.25 In this way, Bahá’u’lláh’s
Seven Valleys describes the process of finding one’s identity or finding
one’s true self through selflessness.26

Developmental psychologist Robert Kegan extensively explores the
process of how the human self develops through the life course, a study of
which reveals interesting points of contrast and similarity with
Bahá’u’lláh’s Seven Valleys. Kegan’s theory of the evolving self attempts
to unite contructivism and developmentalism to create a theory of the self
within meaning-constitutive evolution, whereby the self creates meaning
as it evolves and each developmental stage indicates new qualitative ways
of constructing meaning. In Kegan’s stage 0 (incorporative), the self is pri-
marily subject to the sense and motor output and feedback, and makes no
distinction between self and other. This is ultimately equal to Piaget’s sen-
sory motor stage and also reflects Freud’s “ego feeling” or “oceanic” feel-
ing. In Kegan’s stage 1 (impulsive), meaning making begins. The individ-
ual is able to take that which it is subject to and turn it into an object. The
perceptual structure becomes the unreflected subjectivity of the self; it is
the lens of the self but the self cannot conceive of it.

In the second stage (imperial), disequilibrating interaction with the envi-
ronment occurs and the person becomes disembedded from perceptions.
The individual can now operate on perceptions objectively, as in Piaget’s
stage of concrete operations. In the third stage (interpersonal), the person
can now operate on the needs and interests of the self, yet the demands of
the social environment remain subject to the person. This stage is charac-
terized by a codependency where the self possesses abstract thought but is
still subject to the internalization of others’ thoughts. In stage 4 (institu-
tional), the self takes on an independent identity subject to its own author-
ship and ideology. It is no longer bound by codependency but is now inde-
pendent. The fifth and final of Kegan’s stages is the interindividual stage,
wherein the self is able to reflect on its own mental process as an object and
look outside the immediate frame of ideologies. In this way the self experi-
ences “interpenetration” of self and other and is subject to interindividual-
ity characterized by dialectic reasoning.27

In each stage of Kegan’s theory the self literally constructs a conceptual
framework through which it derives meaning from the world. For stage
transition to occur, one’s current conceptual framework must fall apart, a
process described as “disequilibration” or tension between the way one
views the world and the way the world is. Kegan notes that this self-evolv-
ing process can be frightening and requires the faith that there is a new level
ahead in order to view the world in a more appropriate manner. In each
evolving stage, the self undergoes a dialogue with the surrounding environ-
ment or “other” in three movements: (1) beginning as a concept of self undif-
ferentiated from the other, (2) moving to conceptualize a separate individual
self, then (3) returning in stage 5 to a new conception of the self in relation
to the other. In this way, the entire evolutionary process could be character-
ized as an arc where the self begins as an interdependent entity (“We”),
moves to develop an independent self (“I”), and then finally ends in a state
of interindividuality (“We”), where “self ” and “other” unite once again.28

The entire structure of Bahá’u’lláh’s Seven Valleys can be viewed in a
similar light. As the Seven Valleys arguably begins during the period of
adolescence or in Kegan’s institutional stage (when the identity is formed),
the Seven Valleys represents only half of the total arc presented by Kegan,
or simply as an exponential function as described by Hatcher. For exam-
ple, in the Valley of Search the wayfarer is essentially an independent self
“I” but is longing for and conscious of the existence of a true identity. Thus
the entire Seven Valleys could be viewed as parallel to Kegan’s transitions
from stage 4 to stage 5. This also follows with the conception of the “We”
as a spiritual self and the “I” as the material self. That is, development in
the Seven Valleys describes the simultaneous process of moving away
from independent self (“I”) toward a “selfless” or interdependent self
(“We”). The final stage can therefore be summarized in Saiedi’s words as
“the apex of the new identity of unity. Veils of selfish and limited ego are
burned and new identity is forged based on committed loving, and ration-
al devotion to spiritual virtues” (94).

Here the rhetoric of selflessness as the goal of Bahá’u’lláh’s Seven
Valleys becomes apparent. Selflessness from this perspective can be under-
stood simply as “We.” In other words, the self is en route to or defined by

52            The Journal of Bahá’í Studies 21. 1/4. 2011

its close association to the “other” rather than its own representations.
From this point of view, selflessness can also be understood as a form of
altruism or a concept that places the needs and concerns of others before
one’s own self. The manifestation of the “We,” Kegan’s stage 5, or the pre-
viously defined end stages of development (those of Kohlberg, Maslow,
and Fowler), become a state of self-transcendence or selflessness where
the “other” becomes central to the self-definition. However, Diessner also
notes that selflessness can mean the overcoming of the relative stage of
self that the person is currently in. To move from one stage or one valley
to the next, one must leave behind a lower self for a higher self—this leav-
ing behind is selflessness and is understood as the meaning of sacrifice.
For example, to move from the Valley of Search to the Valley of Love, one
must leave behind all previous conceptions of reality. This can cause a
great deal of fear and frustration which becomes the test that helps to pro-
pel an individual into the next stage. The old self-system is sacrificed and
an old epistemology is left behind in order to gain a higher perspective
and see the world in a new light.

An important distinction, however, separates Kegan’s view from the
Seven Valleys—namely, the idea in the Seven Valleys that selflessness
comes from dying to oneself and living in the Absolute. Previous develop-
mental theories typically assert an end goal for an individual that resolves
dichotomous thinking, transcends the self, and finds solidarity with all
reality. However, this is usually limited to the material or horizontal plane
of existence. In the Seven Valleys, on the other hand, Bahá’u’lláh suggests
that true unity and identity for the individual lies in leaving the plane of
limitation and entering the vertical realms of existence. This suggests
that a new look at the metaphysics of the Absolute may be warranted with
respect to spiritual development.

Moreover, Kegan’s stages along with Bahá’u’lláh’s Seven Valleys illus-
trate the transition between the independent “I” toward the interdepen-
dent “We.” However, the “We” self-aspect for Kegan, or interindividuality,
encapsulates the social realm alone. In contrast, the “We” aspect of the self
in the Seven Valleys not only includes the social realm of interpersonal
relations but it also involves the sacred aspects of transcendent reality.

That is, the “We” is not limited to the social or horizontal dimensions
alone but extends beyond to the vertical and spiritual dimensions.29 Here
we can see potential similarities between the metaphysics of the “We” in
the Seven Valleys and ideas of the spiritual self in many indigenous tradi-
tions the world over. As both Irving Hallowell and Lawrence Kirmayer
note, indigenous or aboriginal conceptions of the self are not typically lim-
ited to the material plane or social world alone but extend also to the spir-
itual world.30 In this way, it becomes apparent that a deeper understand-
ing of spiritual development is not only important for contemporary
developmental theorists, but also for the potential of creating a dialogue
between indigenous and western perspectives and epistemologies. From
the theoretical lens of unity-in-diversity, it is hoped that such integration
is conceivable and explored in future research.

SPIRITUAL PHYLOGENY

Contemporary developmental scientists, such as Michael Cole and
Barbara Rogoff, often note that ontogeny recapitulates phylogeny. In the
following it is suggested that the same holds true for spiritual develop-
ment. When reflecting on spiritual development as illustrated by
Bahá’u’lláh, it is apparent that spiritual and biological developments are
initiated at separate trajectories throughout life. At conception, biological
development begins as the fetus rapidly grows, multiplying cells and
developing the structures necessary for future function in the physical
world. Once born, the young child continues to grow and develop moving
through successive physical, cognitive, and emotional stages. As previous-
ly discussed, the period of adolescence, however, is unique insofar as it rep-
resents a “sensitive period” for spiritual development. Indeed, Habermas
and Bluck suggest that the growing integration of the person concept in
adolescence allows people to create causal coherence in the individual life
story by reference to a single or a few central self-characteristics.

The occurrence of the narrated self or a structured identity as in
Kegan’s fourth, institutional stage, therefore, becomes a requisite for the
process of conscious, self-directed spiritual development, as seen in

54            The Journal of Bahá’í Studies 21. 1/4. 2011

Bahá’u’lláh’s Seven Valleys. Taking this idea further, it is argued that fol-
lowing these biological changes from conception to adolescence a plateau
emerges (that is, adulthood) wherein biological or material development
subsides and non-material or spiritual development begins to flourish.
This idea is supported by ‘Abdu’l-Bahá when He says, “[T]hough in infan-
cy the signs of the mind and spirit appear in man, they do not reach the
degree of perfection; they are imperfect. Only when man attains maturity
do the mind and the spirit appear and become evident in utmost perfec-
tion” (Some Answered Questions 198).31

Turning our attention to phylogeny, we observe interesting parallels
with ontogeny. Courosh Mehanian and Stephen Friberg observe, for
instance, that Bahá’u’lláh and ‘Abdu’l-Bahá not only uphold, but also
develop and strengthen the notion that the human species came into being
by developmental or evolutionary processes that are consistent with the
mechanisms of biological evolution. Indeed, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá likens the entire
evolutionary development of humans to varying degrees and stages:
“Man, in the beginning of his existence and in the womb of the earth, like
the embryo in the womb of the mother, gradually grew and developed,
and passed from one form to another, from one shape to another, until he
appeared with this beauty and perfection, this force and this power. It is
certain that in the beginning he had not this loveliness and grace and ele-
gance, and that he only by degrees attained this shape, this form, this
beauty and this grace” (Some Answered Questions 183).

In this way, the phylogenetic biological evolution of humanity over mil-
lions and millions of years is likened to the ontogenetic biological trans-
formations that occur from conception to adolescence. Along these lines,
anthropologist Clifford Geertz points out that since the emergence of
Homo sapiens in phylogenetic development, the link between biological and
cultural change was severely weakened—physiological evolution drasti-
cally declined while the growth of culture continued with increasing
rapidity. This apparent discontinuity, which occurred some forty to sixty
thousand years ago, has led many developmental and evolutionary scien-
tists—such as Berlim, Mattevi, Belmonte-de-Abreu, and Crow—to sug-
gest that genetic mutations prompted symbolic representation that ulti-

mately guided the appearance of modern humans. Indeed, Michael Cole
suggests that “In some ways, the most well documented developmental
change, from Homo sapiens to Homo sapiens sapiens is the most mysterious.
Except for continued brain growth and some development in tools, there
appears to be no clear reason for the sudden flowering of symbolic culture
and the rapid expansion of human culture that is now clearly docu-
mentable, including sometimes elaborate burial with clear symbolic con-
tent, cave art, and ornamentation, not only of tools but for purposes that
appear to have no direct utilitarian significance” (642).

The point here is that the human evolutionary process (phylogeny),
and the life span developmental process (ontogeny), both begin with
rapid biological transformations and then give way to the more abstract
nonmaterial aspects of development. From this we can see how ‘Abdu’l-
Bahá’s insight reflects both ontogeny and phylogeny: “[T]hough in infan-
cy the signs of the mind and spirit appear in man, they do not reach the
degree of perfection; they are imperfect. Only when man attains maturi-
ty do the mind and the spirit appear and become evident in utmost per-
fection” (Some Answered Questions 198). The beginnings of cultural or
symbolic systems in phylogeny, as described by Cole, signify the begin-
nings of an “age of maturity” in the overall phylogenetic development of
our species, which, in turn, mimics an “age of maturity” or adolescence in
ontogeny. In other words, the emergence of cultural systems or symbol-
ic representation in phylogenetic development, and the emergence of the
narrated self and the ability to begin the process of conscious, self-direct-
ed spiritual development in ontogeny, both reflect the developmental
stage of adolescence and signify the beginnings of maturity. These begin-
nings in both phylogenetic and ontogenetic development mark the man-
ifestation of human spiritual aspects or capacities, which further facilitate
the development of concrete operational thought or symbolic representa-
tion. From a Bahá’í perspective, therefore, the development of both the
mind and culture are the result of a third variable referred to as the
human spirit.

In summary, the conditions for spiritual development are primed after
biological elements are organized in a particular way. This is the case for

56            The Journal of Bahá’í Studies 21. 1/4. 2011

ontogeny, at the age of maturity, and also for phylogeny, with the flourish-
ing of cultural systems. According to ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, both processes are the
result of the attraction of the human spirit (nonmaterial) to the body
(material):

> Moreover, these members, these elements, this composition, which
> are found in the organism of man, are an attraction and magnet for
> the spirit; it is certain that the spirit will appear in it. So a mirror
> which is clear will certainly attract the rays of the sun. It will become
> luminous, and wonderful images will appear in it—that is to say, when
> these existing elements are gathered together according to the natu-
> ral order, and with perfect strength, they become a magnet for the
> spirit, and the spirit will become manifest in them with all its perfec-
> tions. (Some Answered Questions 201)

The evolution of the biological system thus allows for or creates the
conditions that foster the reflection of the spirit in the human mind, which,
in turn, perpetuates the development of cultural systems. The capacity for
scientific investigation, the arts, inventions, trades, and more generally,
cultural systems, are all beyond nature or the animal kingdom because
they result from humanity’s spiritual capacities. As Mehanian and Friberg
note, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá posits that human beings are on a different plane than
the animals because of their spiritual and intellectual powers—powers
that are evidenced by the sciences, the arts, and human inventions. In
other Writings ‘Abdu’l-Bahá collectively calls the human powers, which
distinguish humans from the animal, the spirit of man: “The animal is the
captive of the senses and bound by them; all that is beyond the senses, the
things that they do not control, the animal can never understand,
although in the outer senses it is greater than man. Hence it is proved and
verified that in man there is a power of discovery by which he is distin-
guished from the animals, and this is the spirit of man” (Some Answered
Questions 188).

It is important to note that Clifford Geertz suggests cultural evolution
and the evolution of the human mind necessarily developed in tandem, not

sequentially. In this way, Geertz argues against previous critical point
theories that postulate the capacity for acquiring culture as a sudden all-
or-none occurrence (as could be interpreted from the above case present-
ed from Cole). From the critical point perspective, mental evolution and
cultural evolution are separate processes, the former having been com-
pleted before the latter could begin. Geertz argues that this conception
is incorrect. Instead, Geertz posits that not only was human cultural
accumulation underway well before biological development subsided,
but that such accumulation also actually played an active role in shaping
the final stages of human biological development. Therefore, Geertz
suggests that humans are a product of culture more than they are the
discoverer or creator of culture. Thus, it is probably the case that these
two factors—culture and mind—have developed together in a complex
interaction which supports Geertz’s notion that “man’s nervous system
does not merely enable him to acquire culture, it positively demands that
he do so if it is going to function at all” (68). In sum, Geertz suggests
that the human mind and the capacity to develop culture gradually
develop in tandem over a long period of time and are not the result of a
sudden occurrence.

This position put forward by Geertz essentially denies the possibility of
a critical point in phylogenetic development that gave rise to human cul-
ture or the mind. However, Bahá’u’lláh’s assertion that culture and mind
both developed after the human spiritual capacity was able to manifest is
not necessarily in conflict with Geertz’s assertion that culture and mind
had to develop in tandem. Human culture and the mind could have devel-
oped in tandem, as suggested by Geertz, both being made possible as a
result of the human spirit without there being any contradiction between
the two perspectives. For example, if we imagine a light continually shin-
ing on the earth from the Absolute realm of existence, this can, in some
respects, be taken as a metaphor for the human spirit. In other words, the
human spirit is always present and shinning in full from the beginning of
time as is the Absolute realm of existence. Now, in the phenomenal world
this light can only become manifest when it has an object to be reflected
in. As man develops biologically he slowly polishes the mirror of his mind

58            The Journal of Bahá’í Studies 21. 1/4. 2011

piece by piece; that is, he allows more and more of the spirit to be reflect-
ed in the mirror of his developing mind.

As this process takes place over millions and millions of years, an
increasing amount of light is reflected in the mind and at the same time
more and more cultural forms are created—a process that happens in tan-
dem for potentially thousands of years. Little bits of culture and little bits
of mind both come into existence as more light is being reflected in the
mind and more culture exists for the mind to reflect. Then, however, there
would be a time when the mirror of the mind is polished to such an extent
that the entirety of the light or spirit of man can be reflected. This is per-
haps the period when biological evolution subsides and cultural evolution
takes over. It marks a distinct moment for human beings and could possi-
bly be evidenced by the sudden flowering of culture thought to have
occurred forty to sixty thousand years ago.

From my perspective, Geertz is correct to assert that mind and culture
develop in tandem and are co-constitutive—this is a powerful assertion
that moves away from previous ideas of culture needing the fully devel-
oped mind. However, at some point there would necessarily be a sudden
flowering as the result of the full light of the human spirit being reflected
at the period of maturity. Taken together, then, we could suggest this “age
of maturity” in phylogenetic development mimics ontogenetic adoles-
cence, both of which signify a decline in biological evolution and a subse-
quent flowering of nonmaterial symbolic aspects. In like manner, ‘Abdu’l-
Bahá suggests that

> [t]he human spirit may be likened to the bounty of the sun shining on
> a mirror. The body of man, which is composed from the elements, is
> combined and mingled in the most perfect form; it is the most solid
> construction, the noblest combination, the most perfect existence. . . .
> . This perfected body can be compared to a mirror, and the human
> spirit to the sun. Nevertheless, if the mirror breaks, the bounty of the
> sun continues; and if the mirror is destroyed or ceases to exist, no
> harm will happen to the bounty of the sun, which is everlasting.
(Some Answered Questions 143–44)

Overall, the main argument here contends that just as certain biological
advances are necessary for humans to begin the process of spiritual devel-
opment (that is, the Seven Valleys), so too certain biological advances have
occurred during human evolution that have attracted the spiritual aspects
of man, resulting in a certain flowering of mind and culture while at the same
time leading to a decline in biological evolution. Thus, it is proposed that
culture and mind are essentially equivalent and both are products of and
proofs for the spiritual nature of humanity. Figure 2 displays a visual pres-
entation of ontogenetic and phylogenetic spiritual development.

TOWARD A CONCEPTION OF SPIRITUAL DEVELOPMENT

The overall goal of this paper was, from a unity-in-diversity theoretical
perspective, to develop a conception of spiritual development as presented
within Bahá’u’lláh’s Seven Valleys. The paper examined this theme from
three interrelated aspects: (1) a dialogue with spiritual development and
developmental psychology, (2) the evolution of the self, and (3) the rela-
tion between spiritual development and phylogeny.

With regard to the relation between spiritual development and develop-
mental psychology, similarities were presented while at the same time not-
ing differences. Most significantly was the idea that spiritual development
and biological development, although following similar processes (that is,
equilibration), begin at separate times throughout one’s life: biological
development at conception, and spiritual development at maturity or ado-
lescence. It was also suggested that the dual nature of humanity (spiritu-
al and material), as asserted by Bahá’u’lláh and other religious founders, is
the reason for this dual developmental process.

With regard to the evolution of the self, Bahá’u’lláh’s Seven Valleys
depicts an exponential process of transition where the “I” or lower self
gradually extends along a continuum toward the “We” or higher self.
Kegan’s model of the evolving self was similar except for the fact that the
“We” or interdependent self in the Seven Valleys could be substantiated in
both a material and spiritual metaphysics, whereas Kegan’s view primari-
ly asserts an interconnectedness with other individuals in a material sense.

60               The Journal of Bahá’í Studies 21. 1/4. 2011

Figure 2. Human Ontogenetic and Phylogenetic Development

Ontogenetic and phylogenetic developments reflect one another. In both cases, the spiri-
tual dimension becomes discernible after the “age of maturity.” The “age of maturity” sig-
nifies the point at which biological evolution began to subside (homo habilus) and cultural

> evolution began to increase. The expanded spiritual development section represents the
> dips and peaks in the overall developmental process as seen in the image of the valleys.

In other words, the self/other distinction for Kegan remained a material
concept, whereas in the Seven Valleys, it extended beyond the material to
include spiritual dimensions as well. It is interesting to note that this per-
spective of the self also reflects certain Aboriginal or indigenous concep-
tualizations wherein the person concept is substantiated in relation to a
cosmic order or spiritual reality.

When looking at spiritual phylogeny, it was proposed that the drastic
decline of biological evolution and the development of cultural systems
were the result of the biological components of the body being able to
more fully reflect the human spirit. Moreover, this process also reflects
ontogeny in the sense that spiritual development occurs at the age of
maturity after certain biological developments occur. Extending this fur-
ther, we could suggest that the human species as a whole has itself just
entered a state of maturity and are only now, as a collective, beginning to

develop spiritually as a conscious self-directed process: “Similarly, there
are periods and stages in the life of the aggregate world of humanity,
which at one time was passing through its degree of childhood, at anoth-
er its time of youth but now has entered its long presaged period of matu-
rity, the evidences of which are everywhere visible and apparent” (‘Abdu’l-
Bahá, Selections 438).

Taken together, when reflecting on the three themes presented in this
paper and the overall characteristics of spiritual development as present-
ed within Bahá’u’lláh’s Seven Valleys, the process of spiritual development
could be said to involve increasing one’s knowledge and understanding of
the spiritual dimensions of reality, which requires the conscious process of
struggle and sacrifice, that is, giving up that which is lower for that which
is higher, in order to reorient the self around the sacred other, the
Manifestations of God, or the unity of Absolute Reality that transcends
the dualistic nature of the phenomenal world.

CONCLUSION: FUTURE RESEARCH AND LIMITATIONS

This paper was limited in the sense that it discussed individual develop-
ment essentially outside of the cultural and social context of which we are
all a part. A subsequent paper could specifically address spiritual develop-
ment as a social process and how individual social relations promote or
inhibit individual spiritual development. In addition, a central argument
revolved around the idea that spiritual development occurs after the result
of certain biological markers. Future studies could investigate the degree
to which children can be observed to undergo a spiritual process similar
to the Seven Valleys. How is the spiritual development of children similar
or different from the presentation of development in the Seven Valleys?
Moreover, this could also be extended to children in other cultures; that
is, how do children in particular or individuals in general, from other cul-
tures that do not place the same emphasis on cognitive or conscious
aspects, conceptualize the development of spiritual capacities? These
questions and others like them could help identify important ages in
which spiritual developments occur.

62             The Journal of Bahá’í Studies 21. 1/4. 2011

Looking at other cultures in detail, future studies could compare and
contrast the depiction of spiritual development as presented within the
Seven Valleys and differing conceptualizations from other spiritual tradi-
tions. Is the spiritual development process a universal? If so, we should
expect similar characteristics across all cultures with some of the major
themes presented here. If there are variations, however, it might be inter-
esting to identify if those variations are due to the varying cultural land-
scape or an eternal human core. As noted in this paper, there were simi-
larities between the development of the self toward a union with a spiri-
tual reality within Bahá’u’lláh’s Seven Valleys and particular indigenous
perspectives of defining the person in relation to certain spiritual charac-
teristics. Future research could investigate the extent to which spiritual
development in religious traditions such as the Bahá’í Faith reflects devel-
opmental perspectives of indigenous groups, with the intent to create
common ground for dialogue in academic fields. Lastly, it may be useful for
future studies to examine how the notion that the end of development
exists within a metaphysical plane of the Absolute differs or compares
with other developmental theories. Perhaps a deeper understanding of the
spiritual dimensions of reality will help developmental research under-
stand the motivations and developmental stages undergone by many indi-
viduals who define themselves as a composite of spiritual and material
beings. In the end, it is the decisions we make in everyday social interac-
tions and our capacity to reflect on their consequences that determines, to
a large extent, our proximity to or knowledge of the Absolute.

2. For important research into these areas, see Bers; Boyatzis; Culliford;
Fowler; Frankl; Hatala, “Resilience and Healing”; Hoare; Newberg and Newberg;
Pargament; Tate and Parker; and Wilber, “Waves, Streams.”

3. Although Bahá’u’lláh accepted the general structure of the seven stages pre-
sented by ‘At.t.ár, important distinctions between Bahá’u’lláh’s Seven Valleys and
the Sufi mystical work exist and they are not to be understood as synonymous.
See Saiedi for details.

4. The original pronoun for the “wayfarer” used by Shoghi Effendi—Bahá’-
u’lláh’s great grandson—in the translation of Bahá’u’lláh’s Seven Valleys was
male. Therefore, during my discussion of the wayfarer I use a similar pronoun. In
no way is this to be understood as a biased perspective. The pronouns “he” and
“man” are used in the translations to depict all of humanity.

> 5. See Taherzadeh.

6. As Adib Taherzadeh notes, the word “knowledge” can be misleading here.

The original word, ma‘rifat, used by Bahá’u’lláh is difficult to translate by a sin-
gle word in English which can faithfully impart its true significance—a combina-
tion of true understanding, recognition, and knowledge.

7. Elsewhere, the Bahá’í Writings suggest that man can become aware of the
Absolute Reality in four ways: (1) deep inner reflection on one’s own self, (2) deep
reflection on the created universe, (3) deep reflection on the manifestation of God,
and (4) understanding of one’s dreams. See ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s Some Answered
Questions for details.

8. It is important to note that a growing amount of psychological research is
acknowledging the importance of the spiritual development of children. See
Culliford, for example. In no way is the suggestion that the period of adoles-
cence is a “sensitive” time for spiritual exploration and development meant to
contradict this emerging research. Rather, it is proposed here that adolescence
signifies an important time in this process that may have begun in earlier
stages. In adolescents, spiritual development takes on a conscious, self-directed
characteristic that is arguably not present to the same degree in earlier stages
of development.

9. See Piaget, Equilibration of Cognitive Structures and Studies in Reflecting
Abstraction for more details.

> 10. See Lourenço and Machado or Smith for more details.

11. It is important to note that no (good–evil) value judgments are placed on
the opposition between the body and the spirit of man. Bahá’í perspectives assert
that man can misuse his spiritual faculties just as his biological faculties.

12. Refer to Freud’s Civilization and its Discontents. Sigmund Freud and his
aggressive and animalistic perspective of humanity arguably pertains only to fifty
percent of what humans actually are. The other human aspects overlooked by
Freud involve the capacities to transcend the biological drives and aggressive ten-
dencies (i.e., spirituality).

64             The Journal of Bahá’í Studies 21. 1/4. 2011

13. Indeed, from a Bahá’í perspective, prayer is often described as a ladder upon
which the human soul ascends unto the spiritual worlds.

14. Erik Erikson’s eight stages of development include (1) basic trust versus
mistrust (birth–1 year); (2) autonomy versus shame and doubt (1–3 years); (3) ini-
tiative versus guilt (3–6 years); (4) industry versus inferiority (6–11 years); (5)
identity versus identity confusion (adolescence); (6) intimacy versus isolation
(emerging adulthood); (7) generativity versus stagnation (adulthood); and (8)
integrity versus despair (old age).

16. James Fowler outlined six stages of faith development: Stage 0—“Primal or
“Undifferentiated” faith (birth to two years); Stage 1—“Intuitive–Projective” faith
(ages three to seven); Stage 2—“Mythic–Literal” faith (mostly in school children);
Stage 3—“Synthetic–Conventional” faith (arising in adolescence); Stage 4—
“Individuative–Reflective” faith (usually mid-twenties to late thirties); Stage 5—
“Conjunctive” faith (midlife crisis) acknowledges paradox (late adulthood); Stage
6—“Universalizing” faith, or what some might call “enlightenment.” For an up-
dated and expanded version of Fowler’s stages of faith, refer to Culliford.

18. This idea reflects Beck and Cowan’s ideas of spiral dynamics, wherein human
nature is thought to be fluid and not fixed. This view ultimately suggests that
when forced by life conditions, humans are able to adapt to their environment by
constructing new, more complex perspectives of reality allowing them to handle
the new problem. Each new model or conceptual level includes and transcends all
previous models.

19. Refer to Lerner regarding arguments for the incongruity between mecha-
nistic and organic models of development.

> 20. See Saiedi for details regarding “spatial metaphor” in the Seven Valleys.

21. A parallel would be drawn here between the discussions of material and
spiritual reality or horizontal and vertical reality. In other words, vertical and
horizontal are synonymous with spiritual and material, respectively.

22. This is noted as a crucial distinction between Bahá’u’lláh’s Seven Valleys
and previous Sufi mystical understandings of the Seven Valleys in particular or
spiritual development in general. Bahá’u’lláh asserts that knowledge of Absolute
Reality is unattainable without assistance from or knowledge of the Manifestation

of God. This is ultimately why Jesus said, “I am the way, the truth, and the life:
no man cometh unto the Father, but by me. If ye had known me, ye should have
known my Father also: and from henceforth ye know him, and have seen him”
(John 14:6–7). Previous mystical understandings assert that knowledge of God is
possible and that the goal of spiritual development is precisely that. Thus a cru-
cial aspect of Bahá’u’lláh’s Seven Valleys argues against this idea and posits that
the goal is unification with or knowledge of the Manifestations of God, thereby
outlining the fundamental importance of the Manifestations of God in the process
of spiritual development.

23. In Lawrence Kohlberg’s first stage (obedience and punishment driven),
individuals focus on the direct consequences of their actions on themselves. In the
second stage (self-interest driven), individuals begin to espouse a “what’s in it for
me” position, in which right behavior is defined by whatever is in the individual’s
best interest. Stage 2 reasoning shows a limited interest in the needs of others,
but only to a point where it might further the individual’s own interests. In the
third stage of moral reasoning (interpersonal accord and conformity driven), the
self enters society by filling social roles. Individuals are receptive to approval or
disapproval from others as it reflects society’s accordance with the perceived role.
During the fourth stage (authority and social order obedience driven), it is impor-
tant to obey laws, dictums, and social conventions because of their importance in
maintaining a functioning society. Moral reasoning in stage 4 is thus beyond the
need for individual approval exhibited in stage 3; society must learn to transcend
individual needs. Within stage 5 (social contract driven), the world is viewed as
holding different opinions, rights, and values. Such perspectives should be mutu-
ally respected as unique to each person or community. Finally, in stage 6 (univer-
sal ethical principles driven), moral reasoning is based on abstract reasoning
using universal ethical principles. Laws are valid only insofar as they are ground-
ed in justice, and a commitment to justice carries with it an obligation to disobey
unjust laws.

24. For more information regarding the Bahá’í perspective on the necessary
complementarity between science and religion, see Hatcher, Science and the Bahá’i
Faith.

25. Although it appears that I suggest a dichotomy between the “I” (indepen-
dent) and “We” (interdependent) aspects of the self, I would actually suggest a

66              The Journal of Bahá’í Studies 21. 1/4. 2011

continuum between the two, wherein multiple reflections of these characteristics
can occur in varying degrees depending on the context and individual choice. In
this way, spiritual development in the Seven Valleys signifies the movement from
one end of the continuum to the other.

26. In the end, the choices we make during our day-to-day social interactions
ultimately determine our position along this rich and dynamic continuum
between our material or independent self (“I”) and our spiritual or interdependent
self (“We”). As Larry Culliford, psychiatrist and co-founder of the Royal College
of Psychiatrists’ Spirituality and Psychiatry Special Interest Group, notes, the
more we engage in prayer, scripture reading, practices of devotion, or service to
others (essentially any activity that feeds the spiritual self), the closer we become
to experiencing a harmony between these seemingly opposite aspects of the self.
In other words, like the wayfarer leaving the Valley of Search, we catch a glimpse
of the traceless Friend, the Beloved, or Absolute Reality.

27. From Wilber’s transpersonal perspective, Kegan’s stage 5 signifies a col-
lapse of a whole transpersonal second cycle of development rather than a discreet
and well-defined stage. Moreover, Wilber also suggests that many claims about
nonrational stages or unity-type states, as in Kegan’s stage 5, make a mistake he
calls the “pre/trans fallacy.” According to Wilber, the nonrational stages of con-
sciousness (what Wilber calls “prerational” and “transrational” stages) can be eas-
ily confused with one another (“Spirituality and Developmental Lines”). From
this view, one can reduce transrational spiritual realization to prerational regres-
sion, or one can elevate prerational states to the transrational domain, both of
which moves commit a fallacy.

28. This idea relates to Martin Buber’s I–Thou relationship. For Buber, the
I–Thou relationship characterizes an absorption in and engagement with the “other”
without any sense of self-seeking or manipulation. The idea proposes that we are
only truly ourselves in this mode of being: “In the most powerful moments of dialog-
ic, where in truth ‘deep calls unto deep,’ it becomes unmistakingly clear that it is not
the wand of the individual or of the social, but of a third which draws the circle round
the happening. On the far side of the subjective, on this side of the objective, on the
narrow ridge where I and Thou meet, there is the realm of ‘between’” (Buber 246).

29. Here we begin to see an interesting perspective of the cross as a religious
and spiritual symbol.

30. Indeed, a vision of the “We” as an interpersonal relationship with a spiritu-
al reality is essential for many Canadian Aboriginal spiritual traditions in partic-
ular. See Hatala, “Spirituality”; and Hatala and Desjardins for details.

31. In several Bahá’í Writings, when referring to the individual, the term
“maturity” signifies adolescents or the age of around fifteen.
