## Bahá'u'lláh's Bishárát (Glad-Tidings): A Proclamation to Scholars and Statesmen

> **Abstract:** This article is a historical and textual study of the one of the major writings of Bahá'u'lláh: the Lawh-i Bishárát (Tablet of Glad-Tidings), revealed circa 1891, and advances new theories as to its provenance and purpose. The Tablet of Glad-Tidings is a selective compendium of Bahaullah's laws and principles, sequentially presented in a series of 15 Glad-Tidings. As the Arabic term _Bisharat_ suggests, these Glad-Tidings were a public announcement of some of the essential teachings of the new Bahá'í religion. The Glad-Tidings is the most extensive of several tablets by Bahá'u'lláh that present key teachings in a numbered structure. The Glad-Tidings may, in part, be regarded as serially articulated world reforms intermixed with religious reforms emanating from Bahá'u'lláh in his professed role as World Reformer. The Glad-Tidings also functioned analogously (albeit anachronistically) to a press release, serving not only as a public proclamation but to rectify the inaccuracies and gross misrepresentations that had previously circulated in print. Intended for widespread translation and publication, the Glad-Tidings was sent to scholars notably Russian orientalist, Baron Viktor Rosen (1849-1908) and Cambridge orientalist, Edward Granville Browne (1862-1926) and possibly pre-revolutionary Russian statesmen as well. As a Proclamatory Aqdas, the Tablet of Glad-Tidings was part of a much broader proclamation by Bahaullah, who proclaimed his mission to the political and religious leaders of the world. This study will argue that Bahá'u'lláh may have revealed the Tablet of Glad-Tidings for E. G. Browne or rather through him, since Bahá'u'lláh evidently intended that Browne should translate and publish the Bisharat in order to make the nature of the Bahá'í teachings more widely known. This would then correct the distortions that had previously been published regarding Bahá'u'lláh's purpose and the nature of the religion that he founded, thereby promoting a public awareness that a new world religion was on the horizon of modernity.

The Tablet of Glad-Tidings, as previously stated, privileges selected Baha’i

> 15 ‘Glad-Tidings’ privileges them. This selection process – this privileging of

> ered to be a ‘proclamatory’ epitome of the Aqdas, in which certain provisions
were privileged for the purpose of proclamation.

From another perspective, these ‘Glad-Tidings’ collectively functioned
> as a new ‘gospel’ or kerygma (to use two Christian terms); that is to say, it
> was, and still is, a Baha’i ‘gospel’. This tablet, functionally speaking, may
> be regarded as the ‘Gospel of Baha’u’llah’, proclaiming the ‘good news’
> of social salvation for the transformation of human society globally. It is a
> Baha’i counterpart to the ‘Sermon on the Mount’ in the Gospel of Matthew
(or ‘Sermon on the Plain’ as in Luke’s evangel).

As a ‘Proclamatory Aqdas’, the Tablet of Glad-Tidings was part of a
> much broader proclamation by Baha’u’llah, who proclaimed his mission
> – as anyone with passing familiarity with Baha’i history well knows – to
> the political and religious leaders of the world. Given the special history of
> this singular text, this study will argue that Baha’u’llah may have revealed

Responding to a query by one of the co-authors, the Research Department

tion of this expression is perforce a reference to Professor Browne himself.

> he revealed tablets in the ‘voice’ of Mirza Āqā Jān, who was Baha’u’llah most
> well-known amanuensis. But a decisive determination requires further investi-
gation. Close stylistic analysis is needed to justify this tentative thesis.

While the cover letter is clearly addressed to Browne, what about the
> Bisharat itself? To whom was it revealed? Notwithstanding Adib Taherzadeh’s
> assertion that the recipient of the Bisharat is not known,33 what is known is
> that E. G. Browne was convinced that Baha’u’llah had personally revealed
> the Tablet of Glad-Tidings for Browne himself. Baron Rosen writes:

The idea that the Bisharat was for the ‘Russian authorities in Ashkabad’ fully

BSR_16_art_Ioannesyan_03-28.indd 13                                                                                                   3/27/10 1:12:02 PM

36. Rosen, ‘Eshcho’ 316.          comports with the new information provided by the Research Department
37. Rosen, ‘Eshcho’ 316.          at the Baha’i World Centre (supra), that Baha’u’llah ‘had instructed that a
copy of Lawh. -i-Bishārāt be given to the state authorities’.

Browne’s belief notwithstanding, Rosen questions the idea that the Glad-
> Tidings were originally composed for Browne and offers an alternative the-
> ory, grounded in the contemporary-historical context. He goes on to say that
> its transmission could have been prompted by the news of the murder of the
> Babi [H.ājı̄ Muh. ammad Rid. ā Is. fāhānı̄] by Shi’i Muslims in Ashkabad in 1889.
> Rosen concludes: ‘To give the believers answers to these kinds of questions
> [how to treat peoples of other faiths, cultures and how to behave towards
> the authorities, etc.] articulated by Baha’u’llah himself is probably the goal
> of Baha’u’llah’s epistle “Glad-Tidings”’.36 Rosen’s counter-arguments to
> Browne’s thesis – that the Tablet of Glad-Tidings was both revealed for him
> as well as sent to him – are found in the following passage:

> E. G. Browne was personally too well-known to all the Babi leaders, including
> Behā’u’llāh (sic) himself, for his sympathy towards the Babis, as well as for
> his substantial knowledge of the Babi teaching, to need further ‘illumining’ by
> such a summary presentation of this teaching. It is different in the case of oth-
> er-religious authorities who are not yet familiar with Babism. The Babi agents
> (sic) in Ashkabad had undoubtedly reported to ‘Akkā on their communications
> with the Russians, on their conversations with them and, among other things,
> on the questions which must have been often addressed to them. Especially
> the notorious murder case in which a Babi was killed by Shı̄‘ih [Moslems] in
> 1889 might have provided good reasons for such questions. Giving the believ-
> ers’ answers to those questions as laid down by Behā’u’llāh (sic) himself is
> probably the aim and purpose of the ‘Glad-Tidings’ epistle. It seems to me that
> it is only with this purpose in mind that one can explain the complete absence
> of dogmatic abstractions [from the text]. Upon careful consideration of the 14
> ‘Glad-Tidings’, one will discover that all of them are nothing but answers to
> very natural questions, to wit: What is your attitude towards people of other
> religions? Are you going to show loyalty to the local authorities? Will you avoid
> learning the local language? Does your faith oblige you to visit different holy
> places etc.? Even the strange ninth ‘Glad-Tidings’ will become somewhat
> clearer were it to be considered as an answer regarding the attitude of the fol-
> lowers of the new religion to Christian priesthood.37

created a need for ready answers and thus occasioned the revelation of the        38. Rosen, ‘Eshcho’ 315.
Bisharat, according to Rosen.                                                     39. Rosen, ‘Eshcho’ 315.

Was Browne right, or Rosen? Perhaps both were. Through Browne, some
> of the answers to these pressing questions could be made available to the
> English-speaking world. The fact that a copy of the Bisharat was independ-
> ently sent to Baron Rosen indicates the same purpose, but in a different
> venue. Just like Browne, evidently it was hoped that Rosen would publish
> and translate the Bisharat. Thus the tablet would become available in two
> major languages, English and Russian. On this particular motivation for the
revelation of the Bisharat, the cover letter by Mirza Badi‘u’llah is silent.

Mirza Badi‘u’llah’s cover letter essentially validates what is said in the
> anonymous ‘inscription’ or prefatory note. But the cover letter is more
> specific: ‘After the report on them in the Most Holy Realm, He decreed:
> “Write down and send the ordinances and commands which have so far
> been collected, to wit the commands which are the cause of the grace
> of God, glorified be He.” They have now been collected, reported on [in
> His] presence and sent.’38 Here, it appears that Baha’u’llah had ordered
> the collection of some of the more important laws and principles that
> were salient features of the Baha’i religion. These were then compiled and
> edited into what became the Bisharat. If this theory withstands scrutiny
> and further textual analysis, then this thesis represents a breakthrough in
> reconstructing the circumstances of the revelation of this major tablet of
Baha’u’llah.

Both the anonymous prefatory note and ‘cover letter’ state that the
> Bisharat is basically a compendium of Baha’u’llah’s salient principles and
> laws. But the aforementioned ‘cover letter’ goes further: ‘They have now
> been collected, reported on [in His] presence and sent.’39 This suggests that
> Baha’u’llah ordered the entire process, which consisted of three stages, to
> wit: (1) ‘They have now been collected’; (2) ‘reported on [in His] presence’;
> and (3) ‘sent’. Note that Mirza Badi‘u’llah’s ‘cover letter’, dated 22 January
> 1891, was written one week before Haji Muhammad’s ‘cover letter’, dated 29
> January 1891. Based on a close reading and analysis of the ‘introductions’ to
> the Bisharat (i.e. the anonymous ‘inscription’ and Mirza Badi‘u’llah’s cover
> letter), the present writers theorize the following reconstruction of the cir-
> cumstances of revelation of the Bisharat:

1. ‘They have now been collected’: Here, Baha’u’llah ordered someone (pre-

> sumably Badi‘u’llah) to compile ‘[s]ome of the Divine ordinances con-
> tained in sundry epistles’. In rough form, these became the 15 principles
> of the Bisharat.
2. ‘reported on [in His] presence’: Someone (Mirza Badi‘u’llah?) then pre-

> sented ‘the report on them [compilation of selected Divine ordinances]
> in the Most Holy Realm’, that is, to Baha’u’llah. Baha’u’llah approved,
> and perhaps (or presumably) edited the 15 principles into what is now
> the present text of the Bisharat.
3. ‘and sent’: Then, on Baha’u’llah’s instructions, Haji Muhammad, on 29

> January 1891, sent the Bisharat, along with his and Mirza Badi‘u’llah’s
> cover letter (written one week earlier, on 22 January 1891), as well as with
> the prefatory note of unknown origin on the first page of the Bisharat, to
> Browne at Cambridge University.

In 1891, the Baha’is of Ashkabad sent Baron Rosen a copy of the Bisharat,

> Century Orientalist Collection. Rosen’s manuscript copy of the Bisharat,
> unlike Browne’s own manuscript version of the same, is therefore not avail-
able, and perhaps is no longer extant.

Oddly, in Rosen’s manuscript copy of the Bisharat, the passage on
> constitutional monarchy in the fifteenth Glad-Tidings (which appears in
> Browne’s manuscript) was conspicuously absent,47 while the rest of the
> fifteenth Glad-Tidings was joined to the fourteenth. Thus, structurally and
> numerically, Rosen’s manuscript was comprised of 14 – not 15 – ‘Glad-
> Tidings’. Whether or not the omission was deliberate, or due to a scribal
> error, has not yet been determined. This major textual variant was described
by Browne as an ‘expedient suppression’.48

Baron Rosen quickly found out about the fifteenth Glad-Tidings from his
> colleague at Cambridge, E. G. Browne. This discovery prompted a separate
> study, such that Baron Rosen actually published two journal articles on the
> Bisharat. These are among the very first academic studies published on a sin-
> gle Baha’i text.49 The first study was the publication of the text itself, accompa-
> nied by a Russian translation of the tablet in the form in which he had received
> it.50 Soon after, Rosen found out about the missing section, and compared
variants against another manuscript, presumably the Cambridge MS.

In a letter dated 9 October 1892 to Baron Rosen, Browne reports:
‘I ... send you the collations of the Bishārāt. I have inserted them in the

First of all I would like to express to you our sincere appreciation for

> enough to translate the text into Russian. After seeking Tumanski’s advice,
they decided to send the copy to Rosen for translation into Russian.

In the letter dated only a few months after Rosen received his manu-

> also bear in mind that Ignatyev, as it appears from his letters to Rosen, was
> least favourable towards the Baha’i Faith among Rosen’s correspondents),
or Rosen himself, who acted wholly on his own initiative.

Notwithstanding, it is obvious from the letter, cited above, that both
> Kuropatkin and Ignatyev did know about the subsequent publication and

ment’s attitude towards the Baha’i Faith.

Rosen characterizes the Tablet of Glad-Tidings as a compendium of

> In a metaphysical realm of discourse, beyond praise or blame of the

> Baha’u’llah had been advocating all along. In the Tablet of Wisdom
> (Lawh. -i H.ikmat), Baha’u’llah states: ‘When the eyes of the people of the

> distraught in the wilderness of material causes, oblivious of the One
> Who is the Causer of Causes, and the Sustainer thereof, while such men
> as were the source and the wellspring of Wisdom never denied the mov-
> ing Impulse behind these causes, nor the Creator or the Origin thereof.
> Thy Lord knoweth, yet most of the people know not.’93 Here, Baha’u’llah
> quite openly indicates that the material advancements in the West are
> largely outcomes of the power and progressive influence of his powerful
> socio-moral principles. Obviously this is a truth-claim, beyond verifica-
> tion or falsification.

> Implications for future study of the Bisharat
> It is remarkable that neither Edward Browne nor Baron Rosen – who,
> respectively, introduced the Bisharat to their fellow English-speaking and
> Russian-speaking academics and to other intelligentsia – commented on
> the singularity of Baha’u’llah’s grand vision. To Rosen’s credit, the Bisharat
