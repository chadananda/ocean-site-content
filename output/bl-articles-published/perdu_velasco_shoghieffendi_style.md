LITERARY ANALYSIS

1\. SOME TECHNICAL AND LITERARY FEATURES OF SHOGHI EFFENDI’S ENGLISH

TRANSLATIONS

Although short references to the subject are frequent, we have often searched
—unsuccessfully so far— for comprehensive analysis of Shoghi Effendi’s literary style
and technical features of his translations and his own writings. In the Introduction to
the English translation of the Kitáb-i-Aqdas mention is made of the elevated style
chosen by Bahá’u’lláh («of exalted and emotive character») to faithfully express
contents of great precision of meaning; reference is also made to the style used by
Shoghi Effendi in the parts he translated into English, reminiscent of that used in the
XVIIth Century for the Bible, combining exactness of meaning with evoking a certain
meditative reverence. By indicating that the result achieves the difficult balance of
reproducing the elevated tone of the original without losing accessibility to the
contemporary reader, we find that his translations «are illumined by his uniquely
inspired understanding of the purport and implications of the originals.» This balan-
ce between contrasts, in which it is so easy to fail by excess or simply not to reach
the standard, is mentioned again to combine recuperation of the implicit in the Arabic
(which can at times sound criptic or at least confusing in English) without adding to
or limiting its meanings 1 , and as a challenge for translators working on the rest of
the what Shoghi Effendi left untranslated. The concept of balance reappears to des-
cribe the challenge of striking the balance between beauty and clarity of expression
on the one hand, and literalness on the other.

Our intention in this presentation is not to give full satisfaction to filling in the
vacuum of comprehensive analysis of Shoghi Effendi’s style in translation and his
own writings, but at least to encourage others much better prepared than we are to
dive deeply into the field. Our contribution is the following:

For Buber, the I-Thou relationship among human beings is a reflection or
approximation of the supreme I-Thou relationship between man and God.The fact                                   Whereas in Gibbon, no less than 37 nouns appear, the 10 most common being
