Messianic Concealment and Theophanic Disclosure

Abstract
In this paper, I start by discussing a controversy that has erupted recently
over the issue of the exact point in time that Baha'u'llah became aware of his
mission. The controversy revolves around the translation of a phrase in the
writings of Baha'u'llah which appear to state that he does not have any
"amr". One side to the controversy claims that the translation of this phrase
indicates that Baha'u'llah had no thought of advancing any claim as late as
1857, while the opposing party contends that this is a mistranslation of the
phrase and that Baha'u'llah was fully aware of his mission from at least the
time of his imprisonment in the Siyah-Chal. I intend to show in this paper
that the whole controversy is an illusory one caused by the specific nature of
the meaning of the word "amr" and that the phrase that is the subject of
dispute proves neither side's case, however it is translated. Evolving out of
my discussion of this issue, is a theological schematic of the stages of the
evolution of the mission of those persons that Baha'is call Manifestations of
God. I then putatively impose this schematic upon the dispensation of the
Bab creating a new interpretation of his ministry.

In recent years, a disagreement has emerged among scholars about the exact
meaning of a particular phrase in Baha'u'llah's work, the Sahifih-yi-
Shattiyyih (Book of the River or Book of the Tigris), and the evidence that it
might contain about Baha'u'llah's thinking at the stage in his ministry to
which this work can be dated.

On the one hand, Cole contends that, from his translation of a certain phrase
the Book of the River, it is clear that, at the time that he composed this work
(which Cole dates to about 1857), Baha'u'llah "is making no claim to have a
divine Cause" 1. Cole states that he believes that it was not until about 1859
that Baha'u'llah began to put forward a claim and that the Book of the River
is evidence that, in 1857, Baha'u'llah had no thought of such a claim. This
view is opposed by Saiedi who states that Cole's translation of a particular
phrase is incorrect. Saiedi argues that Baha'u'llah was fully conscious of his
mission and station during the Baghdad period and rejects any suggestion
that Baha'u'llah's consciousness evolved in this regard2 .

The key area in dispute revolves around the translation of a phrase which
occurs in the Sahifih-yi-Shattiyyih. The sentence in which this phrase occurs
may be transliterated thus: "Walakin, chih guyam, kih hich iqbal bih amri
nadaram." The first part of this sentence, "Walakin, chih guyam," is in
idiomatic Persian formulation expressive of despair or frustration. Saeidi
has rendered it "Yet, alas", while Cole has translated it more literally "But
what shall I say?" The difference of opinion focusses however upon the
meaning of the second half of this sentence. The literally word-for-word
rendering of this phrase would be "no approach to any amr do I have". Cole
has considered that the word amr has "the connotation of `divine Cause'" 3
and thus this phrase is an indication that Baha'u'llah, at this stage, had no
idea of advancing a claim to a divine mission. Saeidi responds by asserting
that this phrase is "a common polite Persian idiom which indicates
reluctance or disinclination to approach an issue or engage in a task" 4
Saeidi therefore disputes Cole's conclusion that this phrase indicates that
Baha'u'llah conceived of no divine mission at this stage.

Part of Saeidi's argument is that the context within which this phrase
appears makes his interpretation the more likely one. In the preceding
paragraphs, Baha'u'llah is likening divine revelation to a river and divine
omnipotence to the power of a river when it floods. The sentence in question
appears at the end of this discourse, just after Baha'u'llah has stated that if it
were not for the malice in people's hearts, he would continue his theme and
disclose all of the spiritual meanings inherent in this analogy of the river.
Saeidi argues that it is clear from the context that Baha'u'llah is using this
sentence to terminate this discourse, thus making Saeidi's translation more
likely. To demonstrate this argument, I will here give the translations of both
Cole and Saeidi of the passage in which the disputed phrase occurs:

"If it were not for fear of the hidden chains in the breasts of the people, I
would have continued to mirror forth all divine parables and subtleties of
the celestial laws with reference to the very flowing of this physical river.
But what shall I say? I make no claim to a Cause. The intensity of the
sorrow and grief that have befallen me during these days has left me sorely
tried between the Gog of silence and the Magog of speech. I beseech God to
send down an Alexander who will erect a protecting wall. Hidden allusions
have been concealed in these phrases and sacred letters have been treasured
up in these words. Happy are those who have grasped these pearls, have
appreciated their value, and have attained their presence." 5

Were it not for fear of the malice hidden in the hearts, I would have
assuredly unveiled all the inmost divine analogies and all the subtleties of
the heavenly principles with regard to the course of this outward river. Yet,
alas, I am disinclined to approach any matter. On account of the intensity of

My anguish and sorrow, in these days I am sore tried between the Gog of
silence and the Magog of utterance. I beseech God to send down an
Alexander who will raise an insurmountable barrier. 6

Cole has recently countered Saeidi's contextual argument by finding another
passage in the writings of Baha'u'llah from the same period in which a
similar phrase appears: "ma`lum va mubarhan ast kih in bandih az khud
dhikri va amri nadarad" 7. In this passage, Baha'u'llah states that, should
Baha'u'llah's name be mentioned, this would not become a cause of
contention, because he has not put forward with respect to himself any
mention or amr 8 Cole claims that these two occurrences are cognates of
each other and hence refute Saeidi's contextual argument (since the context
of the second occurrence is completely different).

Cole has also supported his argument by pointing out that at the beginning
of the Sahifih-yi-Shattiyyih, Baha'u'llah rejects any claim that he has
performed any miracles although he asserts that the claims that the Bab and
the Mirrors (mirat, a station given by the Bab to some of his leading
disciples) of the Babi dispensation performed miracles should not be
doubted. Cole maintains that this is evidence that Baha'u'llah was, at this
time, subordinating himself to the Mirrors of the Babi dispensation, and is
thus further evidence that he was not claiming any station for himself.

Cole's conclusions from all of this is that there is no historical evidence for
Baha'u'llah putting forward a claim to a divine mission before 1859 when
there are accounts by such people as Fitnih and Nabil-i Akbar that
Baha'u'llah intimated such a claim to them9. Cole rejects the evidence that
Baha'u'llah's account of his experience in the Siyah-Chal constitutes an
experience of divine revelation (wahy), rather he states that "it appears that
it consisted more of ilham or inspiration than of wahy or revelation, and that
Baha'u'llah began thinking of islah or reform of Babism rather than of
making any claim of his own"10. Cole thus maintains that the notion of
claiming a divine mission did not occur to Baha'u'llah until sometime after
about 1857 and before 1859.

Saeidi has presented a number of other pieces of evidence to support his
position that Baha'u'llah was aware of his station and mission since at least
the Siyah-Chal experience and possibly earlier. In affirmation of the fact that
Baha'u'llah considered the Siyah-Chal experience of 1852-3 to be revelation
(rather than inspiration as Cole claims), Saeidi quotes several references to
this episode in the writings of Baha'u'llah. Of particular interest is the

reference from the writings of Baha'u'llah which parallels the Tablet to the
Shah but instead of referring to "the breezes of the All-Glorious" wafting
over him, he uses the phrase "the breezes of Revelation (wahy)"11, thus
indicating that Baha'u'llah thought that what occurred in the Siyah-Chal was
revelation (wahy) rather than merely inspiration (ilham).

Saeidi also cites several instances where Baha'u'llah has stated that his
revelation arose in the year Nine, i.e. 1852-3 or the year "after Hin" (after
68, i.e. 1269/1852-312).

Furthermore, Saeidi questions Cole's dating of this work to about 1857. Cole
has based this on the fact that one of the Hidden Words is quoted in the
Sahifih-yi-Shattiyyih, but it is quoted slightly differently than in the form in
which it appears in the final form of the Hidden Words. Cole argues from
this that the Sahifih-yi-Shattiyyih can be dated to a time after the Hidden
Words were first revealed but before the final version was distributed, which
he considers to be about 1857. Saeidi states however that there are
numerous instances of Baha'u'llah quoting his own works slightly differently
from the way that they were originally revealed and many years after the
work was originally revealed. Indeed in the case of the Hidden Words, one
of these is quoted in a slightly different form in the tablet to Nasiru'd-Din
Shah. If Cole's reasoning were correct then this tablet would also date from
about 1857, whereas it belongs in fact to the late Edirne period.

The correspondence on this issue has been extensive and has gone on over
several years, but as far as I am aware, Cole has not responded to any of
these latter points that Saeidi has raised.

The Meaning of the Word "Amr"

My purpose is reviving this issue is to raise a further point that has not been
considered by any of the numerous persons who has discussed this question
on several e-mail lists. It is clear that the original point over which Cole and
Saeidi disagreed was the meaning of "hich iqbal bih amri nadaram." Indeed
it could be said that the disagreement focussed on the word "amr" - whether
this word was being used by Baha'u'llah in the specific and technical sense
of "Divine Command or Cause" or whether it was being used in the more
general sense of "matter" or "affair". The word amr is also central to the
second example that Cole has found - in which Baha'u'llah states: "ma`lum
va mubarhan ast kih in bandih az khud dhikri va amri nadarad"

In a paper presented at the Irfan Colloquium in 199913, I have given an
extensive analysis of the word "amr" in both the Qur'an and in the Kitab-i-

Iqan. I will not here repeat the detailed analysis given there, but it can be
stated in summary that in the Qur'an the word amr has a complex range of
meanings which is not easily translated by a single English word. When
used in connection with God, it certainly means the Divine commission or
decree which descends upon a Messenger of God in the form of Revelation,
as Cole has stated. But it also is used to denote the judgement of God upon
the people - those who accept the Messenger of God are saved and rewarded
and those who refuse and disobey him are punished. Instances of this latter
meaning of amr can be found throughout the Surah of Hud, for example (11:
40, 43, 58, 66, 76, 82, 94). Thus the semantic range of the word amr
involves not only the descent upon the Messenger of God of Divine
revelation but also the imposition upon people of an obligation to accept the
revelation, such that if they refuse, there is a consequent punishment.

In Baha'u'llah's Kitab-i-Iqan, one finds the same range of meanings for the
word amr. Regarding Noah, for example, it is stated:

When He was invested with the robe of Prophethood, and was moved by the
Spirit of God to arise and proclaim His Cause [amr], whoever believed in
Him and acknowledged His Faith, was endowed with the grace of a new
life. (Iqan 154)

This meaning of amr becomes of significance for Baha'i polemic in the
interpretation of Qur'an 32:5 which states:

He [God] establishes al-amr from heaven to earth and it will return to Him
in a Day, the length of which is one thousand years in your reckoning

If we now take these points back to the disagreement between Cole and
Saeidi, the critical distinction that becomes evident in connection with the
meaning of the word amr is the distinction between that of merely being the
bearer of a revelation and that of imposing upon people the obligation of
abandoning the previous revelation and accepting the new revelation.
Revelation (wahy) and amr are thus two separate conditions which do not
necessarily co-exist. It is possible to have wahy without amr (although not, I
think, amr without wahy). In other words, it would appear that for a period
of time while was he was in Baghdad, Baha'u'llah was the conscious bearer
of a revelation but that he chose not to openly declare this fact and thus
impose upon the people the necessity of choosing whether to accept his new
revelation or not. During the entirety of the Baghdad period, therefore, the
amr of the Bab held sway - the obligation of people was to accept and
follow the religion of the Bab.

I assume that both Cole and Saeidi would agree that in 1857 and indeed
during the whole of the Baghdad period, Baha'u'llah was not advancing a
claim to revelation in such a way as to challenge and oblige those with
whom he was in contact (mainly the Babis) to follow him. If there is
agreement on that, then given the full meaning of the word amr, he was not
putting forward an amr. In other words, regardless of whether we accept
Cole's claim that Baha'u'llah did not in 1857 envisage advancing a claim to
divine revelation and that his thinking only developed later in this direction
or we accept Saeidi's contention that Baha'u'llah was fully aware of his
station as a revelator of God's Will and was indeed hinting at this in his
writings, the phrase "hich iqbal bih amri nadaram." has no bearing on this
issue. Even if Cole is correct in translating it as "I make no claim to a
Cause," this would still be in accordance with Saeidi's view that Baha'u'llah
was fully aware of his station and was hinting at it in his writings. Given the
full meaning of the word amr, even if Baha'u'llah were fully aware of his
station, he was not at this time proclaiming it and calling people to follow
him. Thus the amr - the obligation to follow Baha'u'llah and God's
judgement upon them depending on the decision they made - had not yet
been laid upon people.

Baha'u'llah's Messianic Concealment and Theophanic Disclosure

Christopher Buck14, Juan Cole15 and others have written of Baha'u'llah's
Baghdad period as being that of "messianic secrecy" or of "a messianic
secret". This term reflects Baha'u'llah's own description of this period, the
"set time of concealment" 16. MacEoin appears to believe that during this
period, Baha'u'llah had no messianic secret and that the idea of putting
forward a claim occurred to Baha'u'llah only in about the beginning of 1863.
MacEoin believes the accounts of Baha'u'llah's experience in the Siyah Chal
(and possibly also the Ridvan Garden) to be a retrospective rewriting of
history in order to conform to certain Shi`i and Shaykhi expectations about
the year 1269 and 128017. Initially Cole disputed MacEoin's position and
asserted that even in Baha'u'llah's earliest works, such as the Rashh-i `Ama
and the Qasidah al-Warqa'iyyah, which date from Baha'u'llah's Tehran and
Sulaymaniyyah period respectively, Baha'u'llah was signalling that his true
station was that of being the bearer of a revelation and a number of
individuals realised this station during the Baghdad period18. More recently,
Cole has gone back from this position and now states that he considers that
Baha'u'llah reached a consciousness of a Divine mission in between about
1857 and 185919

It seems to the present writer that, given the fact that the references to
denying an amr are not relevant to this issue, as indicated above, we are left
with the supporting evidence that Saeidi has presented (as described above -
Baha'u'llah's use of the word "revelation (wahy)" in relation to his Siyah
Chal experience and the instances where Baha'u'llah has stated that his
revelation arose in the year Nine), which Cole has not countered. Cole's
reference to Baha'u'llah denying the performance of miracles at the
beginning of the Sahifih-yi-Shattiyyih would not seem to be relevant since
Baha'u'llah dismissed the importance of miracles throughout the whole of
his ministry. And in any case, if the amr of the Bab still held sway during the
whole of the Baghdad period, then it would not surprise us to find
Baha'u'llah expressing this fact in various ways.

An additional point that needs to be made here is that, according to Shi`i
traditions, the Imams, who receive inspiration (ilham), only hear this
inspiration, whereas a Messenger of God (rasul) who receives revelation
(wahy), sees the Angel who delivers the revelation20. The fact that
Baha'u'llah reports seeing the Maid of Heaven is in itself a strong indication
that he considered that he was in receipt of a revelation (wahy) rather than
merely inspiration (ilham).

There seems to be no good grounds for accepting MacEoin's assertion that
this was all rewriting of history by Baha'u'llah and so, unless Cole can
produce some grounds for refuting this evidence, it would appear reasonable
to accept Baha'u'llah's statements regarding the significance of the Siyah
Chal and Ridvan episodes at their face value, which more or less
corresponds to the traditional Baha'i interpretation as given by Shoghi
Effendi in God Passes By. This would then divide the life of Baha'u'llah
theologically into three stages:

1\. The period before the onset of revelation, which Baha'u'llah describes by
the words "I was but a man like others, asleep . . ."21 and which `Abdu'l-
Baha expounds as meaning that although the Manifestation of God in the
Manifestation from birth, his mission is not activated until a particular
time22

2\. The period during which revelation (wahy) is present but no claim had
been advanced that represented the imposition of amr upon the people, the
messianic concealment.

3\. The period during which both amr and revelation are present, the
theophanic disclosure, following which the laws of the new religion are
given.

22 Abdu’l-Baha, Some Answered Questions, Wilmette:Baha’i Publishing Trust, 1990, 155-6.

Incidentally, we have evidence from as early as 1867 that the ordinary
Baha'is understood this concept that Baha'u'llah had revealed himself
gradually. In a letter written in 1867 by the Baha'i community of Baghdad to
the United States Congress, we have the following statement regarding
Baha'u'llah: "That wise man revealed himself till he appeared like the high
sun in midday."23

Although the broad outline of these three stages in Baha'u'llah's life are now
clear, the exact dating of these stages is not as clear-cut as one may think.
Although the onset of revelation is generally regarded as having started with
the appearance of the Maid of Heaven to Baha'u'llah in the Siyah-Chal,
sometime between September 1852 and January 1853, this does not fully
take into account the episode of Baha'u'llah's meeting with Shaykh Hasan
Zunuzi in Karbala in 1851. Nabil Zarandi, who appears to have known
Shaykh Hasan personally, records that Baha'u'llah confided to Shaykh
Hasan "the secret that He was destined to reveal at a later time in
Baghdad"24 Now it may be that since the claim put forward by Baha'u'llah to
Shaykh Hasan was that of being the return of the Imam Husayn this did not
necessarily imply a claim to revelation. It does, however, mean that
Baha'u'llah was communicating some inkling of a higher station earlier than
1852\. Similarly, the date for the end of this period of messianic secrecy is
not exactly defined.

It is clear from the statements of Baha'u'llah that he made some form of
claim to a small number of his companions in the Garden of Ridvan in April
1863\. But at what point in time can it be said that the amr - the obligation to
follow Baha'u'llah - had been laid upon the people? Was it in April 1863,
when only a small number were informed and there appears to have been no
attempt to spread this news, or in 1864 when a few tablets written by
Baha'u'llah begin to make his claim to authority clear, or in 1866-7, when he
began to send individuals to Iran to propagate his claim to the Babis and at
the same time he openly challenged Mirza Yahya, who was widely
acknowledged as the head of the Babi community, or should we, for
theological reasons, delay this until the period of Baha'u'llah's proclamation
to the kings and rulers of the world in 1868-72 (the kings and rulers acting
in a sense as proxies for their people)?

During the years when Baha'u'llah lived in Baghdad, he "appeared in the
guise of, and continued to labour as, one of the foremost disciples of the
Bab"25 The main thrust of his activities were towards reforming and
purifying the Babi community. A significant number of individuals are,
however, reported as having come to realise that he occupied a much higher

station. These are said to have come to this conclusion either from reading
his writings26 or from meeting him (for example Nabil Akbar, Shams-i
Jahan Khanum Fitnih, and Mirza Fath-`Ali Khan Fath-i-A`zam.27

Following the open declaration of his mission in 1863-8, Baha'u'llah began
to reveal the new laws of his dispensation, most particularly in the Kitab al-
Aqdas, followed by the new social teachings of his religion, in a series of
important tablets revealed after the Aqdas. Baha'u'llah himself links the
theophanic disclosure and the imposition of the amr upon the people with
the revelation of a new law in the following passage from the Tablet to
`Abdu'r-Razzaq, referring to the rejection of Baha'u'llah by the Azalis:

And when the Cause (amr) of God was revealed and the laws, by which the
entirety of the Bayan was confirmed and upon which it is dependent, were
promulgated, they then pushed these aside, as you have seen and heard.28

In summary then, we may discern three periods to the life of Baha'u'llah and
two periods to the ministry of Baha'u'llah. There was initially a period when,
although there are some hagiographical accounts of wonders in his
childhood and youth, there is nothing to indicate that he put forward any
claim or was in receipt of any special divine guidance. From 1844 onwards,
he acted as one of the followers of the Bab. Then came the first phase of his
ministry, a period of messianic concealment, during which Baha'u'llah was
in receipt of revelation (wahy) but had not yet openly advanced a claim,
which would have laid the obligation of acceptance, the amr, upon the
people. This period lasted from roughly 1852 to 1863, but may, for the
Babis of Iran have extended to 1867. During this period also, Baha'u'llah
acted as one of the followers of the Bab. The second phase of his ministry,
and the third period of his life, was the period of theophanic disclosure,
which was initiated with the Declaration in the Garden of Ridvan in 1863
but only gradually attained its full force as Baha'u'llah successively
disclosed his claim to the Babi community in 1866-7 and to the rest of the
world in 1868-72. This was the period when both amr and wahy were
present.

The Ministry of the Bab

Having outlined a schema for the life and ministry of Baha'u'llah, I would
now like to see in what way this can be overlaid onto the life and ministry of
the Bab. In Babi-Baha'i history the start of the ministry of the Bab is usually
stated to start from his declaration to Mulla Husayn Bushru'i on the evening

of 22 May 1844. The exact equivalent in the life of the Bab to Baha'u'llah's
experience of the Maid of Heaven in the Siyah-Chal is however dated by the
Bab to have occurred about 2 months before. In the Kitab al-Haramayn, the
Bab writes:

In truth, the first day that the Spirit descended in the heart of this slave was
the fifteenth of the month of Rabi`u'l‑Avval [1260, i.e. 4 April 1844]29.

This may correspond to the vision that the Bab describes of the severed head
of the Imam Husayn. This vision is described by the Bab in one of his
writings which is quoted in Nabil's Narrative: In one of His writings
revealed in the year '60 A.H., the Bab declares the following:

"The spirit of prayer which animates My soul is the direct consequence of a
dream which I had in the year before the declaration of My Mission. In My
vision I saw the head of the Imam Husayn, the Siyyidu'sh‑Shuhada', which
was hanging upon a tree. Drops of blood dripped profusely from His
lacerated throat. With feelings of unsurpassed delight, I approached that
tree and, stretching forth My hands, gathered a few drops of that sacred
blood, and drank them devoutly. When I awoke, I felt that the Spirit of God
had permeated and taken possession of My soul. My heart was thrilled with
the joy of His Divine presence, and the mysteries of His Revelation were
unfolded before My eyes in all their glory."30

This vision may also correspond to the episode related by Khadijih Bigum,
the wife of the Bab, in which she saw the Bab one night intoning a prayer:
"His face was luminous; rays of light radiated from it. He looked so majestic
and resplendent that fear seized me." Later the Bab said to her: "It was the
will of God that you should have seen Me in the way you did last night, so
that no shadow of doubt should ever cross your mind, and you should come
to know with absolute certainty that I am the Manifestation of God Whose
advent has been expected for a thousand years. This light radiates from My
heart and from My being"31

The claim that is explicitly made, however, in the first chapter of the
Qayyum al-Asma, which the Bab wrote in the presence of Mulla Husayn on
23 May 1844 was that of being the Gate to the Hidden Imam. In all of the
books written in the early years of his ministry, the Bab never makes any
explicit claim to any higher station. He also does not abrogate the law of
Islam - indeed he urges his followers to be meticulous in carrying out the
Islamic law32. Thus just as Baha'u'llah, in his early years, appears to be a
reformer and purifier of the religion of the Bab, so the Bab, in these early

32 Tablet to Tahirih, cited in Asadu'llah Fadil Mazandarani, Tarikh-i Zuhur al-Haqq ("History of the
Manifestation of Truth"). Volume 3.. Tehran, n.p, 1944. Reprinted, H-Bahai: Lansing, Mi., 1998, p. 334

years appears as a reformer and purifier of Islam. Within the Shaykhi
community to whom the Bab and the Letters of the Living predominantly
addressed themselves in the early years, the Bab appeared to be a leader in
succession to Sayyid Kazim. Even the title of "the Bab" was not exceptional
as Shaykh Ahmad and Sayyid Kazim had occasionally been known by this
title.

The Bab did not proclaim his full identity as the Mahdi and the revealer of a
new revelation until the summer of 1848. At this time, two events occurred
almost simultaneously. First, those attending the conference of Badasht
heard Tahirih and Baha'u'llah proclaim that the Islamic dispensation had
ended. Second, the Bab declared himself to be the Mahdi at his trial before
the Crown Prince Nasiru'd-Din Mirza at Tabriz. It was perhaps not the
declaration of being the Mahdi itself which was the decisive issue for the
matter under consideration in this paper, since Muslims commonly expected
that the Mahdi would follow Islam and would not bring a new revelation. It
was rather that during the trial, the Bab claimed that he was revealing divine
verses, and this was discussed at length by the `ulama present. Immediately
after this, the Bab wrote the Persian Bayan in which he abrogated the laws
of Islam and promulgated his own laws.

Prior to these episodes in the summer of 1848, many, possibly most, of the
Babis thought that the Bab was merely claiming to be an Islamic leader, a
leader of the Shaykhi sect, the gate to the Hidden Imam. This was what he
appeared to be claiming in his writings and this is the evident meaning of
the title of "Bab" that he had taken. There is evidence for this assertion in
the fact that when the Bab's full claims became known at the conference of
Badasht, there were some who left the Babi movement as a result. Some of
those attending the conference apostatised and left and we are told that in
Maraghih, where most of the Shaykhis had become Babis, they apostatised
when they learned that the Bab had abrogated the laws of Islam33

There were also many, however, who realised, before the summer of 1848,
that the Bab's claim was far higher than that of merely being a gate to the
Hidden Imam. As early as the first year of the Bab's ministry, Sunni and
Shi`i `ulama gathered at the trial of Mulla `Ali Bastami in Baghdad
perceived that while the text of the Qayyum al-Asma may claim that its
author is the gate to the Hidden Imam, the language, through use of such
terms as wahy and nuzul, in fact denoted a claim to divine revelation. If
Sunni and Shi`i `ulama could discern that there lay a claim to revelation, a
claim to a station equivalent to that of the prophet Muhammad, behind the
text of the Bab, we can be sure that the leading disciples of the Bab also did.
They were, after all, educated in exactly the esoteric tradition of Shaykhism
that was most informed about such subtleties. Some of these leading Babis
were more explicit in revealing their discovery of his high station (for

33 Mazandarani, Zuhur al-Haqq, 58.

example Tahirih), while others kept the knowledge hidden. I have discussed
this theme in more detail in a paper regarding the trial of Mulla `Ali
Bastami34

We may therefore see that, just as with Baha'u'llah, when the main body of
the Babis during the Baghdad period saw Baha'u'llah as an inspiring leader
but still basically within the circle of Babism, so during the early years of
the ministry of the Bab, the majority of the Babis probably conceived of the
Bab as a Shaykhi leader, as a gateway to the Hidden Imam who is the true
Lord of the Age. However, just as there were some leading Babis who
recognized, either from meeting him or reading his writings in the Baghdad
period, that Baha'u'llah's true claim and station were far higher, so also there
were undoubtedly a group of the followers of the Bab in the early years who
recognised, either from his writings or from meeting him that his claim was
much greater. We could say that just as during the Baghdad period, the amr
still lay with the Bab and the people were not yet called upon to believe in
Baha'u'llah as the purveyor of a new religion from God, abrogating the
religion of the Bab, so from May 1844 to July 1848, the amr still lay with
Muhammad and the generality of the people were not yet called upon to
believe in the Bab as the bearer of a new religion from God. The period of
May 1844 to July 1848, thus become a period of messianic concealment,
which ended with the theophanic disclosure occasioned by Tahirih's
proclamation at the conference of Badasht and the Bab's declaration at his
trial that he was the Mahdi and the author of a new revelation.

Continuing the parallels, we might point out that just as there are statements
in the writings of Baha'u'llah during the Baghdad period denying that he was
possessed of any amr and appearing to subordinate himself to the authority
of the Bab and the Babi hierarchy (as in the Sahifih-yi-Shattiyyih), so there
are similar statements of the Bab in these early years. There is for example
the episode in the Masjid-iVakil in Shiraz, when his enemies had forced the
Bab to issue a recantation of his claims. There are several versions of this
episode. Nabil gives the following:

The Bab, as He faced the congregation, declared: "The condemnation of
God be upon him who regards me either as a representative of the Imam or
the gate thereof. The condemnation of God be also upon whosoever
imputes to me the charge of having denied the unity of God, of having
repudiated the prophethood of Muhammad, the Seal of the Prophets, of
having rejected the truth of any of the messengers of old, or of having
refused to recognise the guardianship of `Ali, the Commander of the
Faithful, or of any of the imams who have succeeded him."35

Iran, 1982, 20, 113-43.

35 Zarandi, Nabil's Narrative, 154

The following is an alternative account of the Bab's words which occurs in a
letter written by Sayyid Husayn Katib, the Bab's amanuensis:

O people! Whoever believes in my prophethood (nubavvat), may the curse
of God be upon him. Whoever considers that I am an appointed gate (bab-i
mansus) sent by the grace of the [Hidden] Imam (upon him be peace), may
the curse of God be upon him. I am but a servant, believing in God and in
his verses.36

And yet another account exists from Haji Mirza Muhammad Sadiq, who
was not a believer in the Bab:

O people! Know ye that I have not said anything that my ancestor the
Messenger of God did not say. That which Muhammad has made
permissible [in the Holy Law] is permissible until the Day of Resurrection
(yawm al-qiyama) and that which Muhammad has made illicit is illicit until
the Day of Resurrection. As the Immaculate [Imam] (upon him be peace)
has said: When the Qa'im arises, that is the Resurrection.37

In the Sahifih-yi `Adliyyah and other writings from this period, the Bab also
denies any new revelation and commands the people to follow the laws of
the Qur'an and the teachings of Muhammad.

The parallels between the Bab and Baha'u'llah can even be extended to the
ways in which they made their full claim known - the manner of the
theophanic disclosure. Baha'u'llah proclaimed his full station in three ways.
First privately to a small group of his followers in the Garden of Ridvan,
openly to the Babis in the early years of the Edirne period, and then to the
peoples of the world through their kings and rulers in the late Edirne, early
Akka period. The full station of the Bab was declared to the Babis at the
conference of Badasht and it was proclaimed to the Crown Prince and
leading religious figures of Tabriz at his trial. The Bab at this time also
wrote to the Shah of Iran and the Prime Minister Haji Mirza Aqasi. There is
even a parallel to the private Ridvan Garden declaration of Baha'u'llah in the
declaration by the Bab that he was the Qa'im to one of his foremost disciples
`Azim shortly before his public declaration at his trial38. The fact that even a
leading disciple such as `Azim, who mixed freely with the Babis in Tehran
and Adharbayjan, was perturbed by this claim at this late date is further
evidence that the realisation of the full station of the Bab was not very
widespread among the Babis prior to the summer of 1848.

In his book, the Seven Proofs, the Bab explains that the need for a period of
messianic concealment and the gradual unfoldment of his claims arose out
of the lack of capacity among the people to accept his full claim at the start

> 36 Quoted in A.Q. Afnan, Zindigani-yi Hadrat-i Bab 167
> 37 Quoted in A.Q. Afnan, Zindigani-yi Hadrat-i Bab 168

38 Zarandi, Nabil's Narrative, 313

of his mission and out of a desire to assist people to gradually come to a full
realisation of the magnitude of the his claim:

Consider the manifold favours vouchsafed by the Promised One, and the
effusions of His bounty which have pervaded the concourse of the followers
of Islam to enable them to attain unto salvation. Indeed observe how He
Who representeth the origin of creation, He Who is the Exponent of the
verse, `I, in very truth, am God', identified Himself as the Gate [Bab] for the
advent of the promised Qa'im, a descendant of Muhammad, and in His first
Book enjoined the observance of the laws of the Qur'an, so that the people
might not be seized with perturbation by reason of a new Book and a new
Revelation and might regard His Faith as similar to their own, perchance
they would not turn away from the Truth and ignore the thing for which they
had been called into being.39

Baha'u'llah has recapitulated and expanded on this in a tablet written to Aqa
Mirza Aqa Nuru'd-Din:

Thou art well aware that the Commentary on the Ahsan al-Qisas (the
Qayyum al-Asma of the Bab) was revealed according to what was current
among the people (bi ma `ind an-nas) and this was purely out of bounty and
grace that haply the people of negligence and error may ascend to the
heaven of knowledge (jabarut-i `ilm). Thus most of what is mentioned in
that book is what has been accepted as truth among the Muslims (ahl al-
furqan). If what was the Will of God had been sent down from the start, no-
one would have been able to bear it and no-one would have remained. All of
this is out of His grace and bounty towards His creatures. Observe that at the
start of his ministry, that holy one revealed himself in the station of
gatehood (babiyyat). This was out of consideration that the birds of the
hearts of humanity were not capable of flying above that station . . . The
people have been and will continue to be immersed in the ocean of idle
fancies and veiled from what God doth will, except those whom God has
delivered through His Grace and whom He has caused to recognise what He
hath revealed through His command . . . Thus out of grace to them, the Sun
of Truth occupied himself with uttering trivia and the Ancient Ocean spoke
forth only droplets. Thus it is that the Primal Point hath appeared in the
name of gatehood (babiyyat), and the people did not accept even this limited
station, let alone any mention of guardianship (lordship, vilayat) and such
matters. And this despite the fact that all of these stations and those beyond
them have been revealed and come into existence by a single word out of
the ocean of his bounty and by his command they also return to annihilation
and oblivion.40

40 Quoted in A.Q. Afnan, Zindigani-yi Hadrat-i Bab 203-4

Finally, in a tablet which appears to date from the Edirne period, the Surat
al-Fath, Baha'u'llah restates this theme and draws the parallels between the
Bab's gradually unfolding claims and his own initial concealment of his
claims. First, he describes the gradual unfoldment of the claims of the Bab:

So recollect, O people! The moment when there came unto you the Revealer
of the Bayan with wondrous, holy verses. At that time he said: "I am the
Gate of Knowledge (bab al-`ilm) and whoever asserts more than that in
relation to me has assuredly invented lies about me and has sinned greatly."
Then later he said "I am the Qa'im, the True One, whose manifestation you
were promised in mighty, noble scrolls." Then he said, magnified be his
utterance, "I, verily, am the Primal Point. And this is, in reality, Muhammad,
the messenger of God, the same [person] as thou hast heard and witnessed
in the tablets of God, the King, the Ruler." And when the beings of a number
of souls had progressed [sufficiently], thereupon, the veils were torn asunder
and, from the Dawning-Place of holiness, there rose up [the call]: "I verily
am God, no God is there except Me, thy Lord and the Lord of all the
worlds." And also: "I, verily, from the beginning which hath no beginning,
was a divinity, the One, the Single, the Unique. I did not take unto myself
any partner or likeness or deputy. I verily sent the prophets and the
Messengers from all eternity and will continue to send them to all eternity" .
..

Then in this tablet, Baha'u'llah comments on the gradual unfoldment of his
own claims, mentions explicitly that there was a time during which he
elevated the name of his brother and was submissive before the authoritative
figures in the Babi movement, and clearly indicates that the amr did not lie
with him in those days:

By God, O people! I did not desire any Cause (amr) for myself and followed
all the Manifestations of old. I supported the Cause (amr) of God in every
way during the days when faces were concealed out of fear of the
oppressors. I humbled myself before every soul in the Bayan and lowered
the wing of submission before every worthy believer. I safeguarded my
brother [Mirza Yahya] . . . and elevated his name among the servants of God
. . . There was none of the people of the Bayan for whom I did not reveal a
tablet in which I mentioned him with high praise. Every fair-minded and
trustworthy person will bear witness to this.41

Conclusion

The thesis of this paper is that the phenomenon of a period of messianic
concealment followed by a theophanic disclosure is common to at least the

41 Based on a translation by Stephen Lambden in "Some Notes on Baha'u'llah's Gradually Evolving
Claims of the Adrianople/Edirne Period," Bulletin of Baha'i Studies, vol. 5.3-6.1, June 1991, 75-83, see pp. 79-80;

Bab and Baha'u'llah (and a case can be made for a similar phenomenon in
the life of Jesus and Muhammad). The period of messianic concealment
appears to be a period when although the Manifestation is in receipt of
divine revelations, these are phrased in such a way as to conceal their
identity as revelation. Since no claim to being the bearer of a new revelation
and the inaugurator of a new religious dispensation is made by the
Manifestation during this time, there is no obligation on the people to follow
the Manifestation, although a small number do discern the reality of the
Manifestation. During this period, the amr still belongs to the previous
Manifestation. At some point however, the new Manifestation discloses his
true nature and puts forward the claim to be the inaugurator of a new
religion. This disclosure is made both to the followers of the previous
religion and to the secular authorities. This theophanic disclosure now puts
an obligation on all to follow the new Manifestation. A new amr has begun.
Following this the new Manifestation begins to reveal the new laws and
teachings associated with his dispensation. Baha'u'llah has given something
of the reason for this particular strategy in the case of the Bab and it is
probable that much the same applies to the case of Baha'u'llah himself.
Baha'u'llah states that the reason for the messianic concealment was that the
people of the previous religion were not able to bear the full disclosure of
the new Manifestation. Therefore the station of that Manifestation was
revealed to them gradually.

PostScript: A Note on the Year Five of the Ministry of the Bab

I have recently been translating for the forthcoming Irfan Colloquium the
Bab's commentary on the Verse of Light I was interested to see in this the
same prophecy regarding the fifth year of his ministry that also occurs in the
Seven Proofs. This prophecy emerges from the Bab's interpretation of the
Tradition of Kumayl. In response to the question "What is reality?", the
Imam `Ali responded by a series of enigmatic statements.

In both the Seven Proofs and the Commentary on the Verse of Light, the
Báb gives an interpretation of this Tradition, emphasising in particular the
fifth phrase in this Tradition, which he relates to the fifth year of his
ministry. In the Seven Proofs, the Bab merely prophesies that in that year
"you will see a light shining from the morn of eternity if you do not flee and
are not disturbed." But in the Commentary on the Verse of Light, he gives
some indication of what will happen in that year. He begins by quoting the
Tradition and then going on to expand on the fifth phrase:

Verily in the first year, there hath appeared the uncovering of the clouds of
glory without a sign42; then the obliteration of vain imaginings and the
dawning of the known; then the rending of the veils for the overthrow of the

42 Min ghayr alBishara; "Piercing the veils of glory, unaided" – Baha’u’llah, Kitab-i-Iqan,
Wilmette:Baha’i Publishing Trust, 1950, p. 164

secret; then the attraction of the primal unity for the attributes of the Divine
Oneness; then a light dawning forth from the morn of pre-eternity upon the
temples of unity (cf Shoghi Effendi translates a slightly different phrase as
"Behold, a light hath shone forth out of the Morn of eternity, and lo! its
waves have penetrated the inmost reality of all men." Iqan 102). And when
it has entered upon the five [?fifth year], its effect is that the fire becomes a
light. At that moment, the form is completed and, verily, the form of the five
is the form of a human being. Its creation is not completed for five years just
as we sent to thee thy form.

The meaning of the passage is not entirely clear, but what is clear is that the
Bab was signalling that some process that was begun at the start of his
ministry would come to fruition in the fifth year and it would come to
fruition in a human form.

Now since the fifth phrase of the Tradition of Kumayl reads: "a light
dawning forth from the morn of pre-eternity (subh-i azal)," the Azalis have
long asserted that this is a prophecy of the arising of Azal in the fifth year of
the ministry of the Bab. However, there are problems with this assertion.

First, it is not at all clear that Azal was ever known as Subh-i Azal until a
much later period. Mirza Yahya was addressed as Azal in tablets of the Bab,
on account of the fact that his name Yahya and Azal are numerically
equivalent (=38). However, I have not seen anywhere that the Bab addresses
him as Subh-i Azal, and this statement is supported by Ishraq-Khavari43. It
is probable that either he himself or, more likely, some of his followers such
as the authors of the Hasht Bihist, Shaykh Ahmad Ruhi and Mirza Aqa
Khan Kirmani, began to give him this appellation precisely in order to make
him retrospectively fit the prophecy of the Bab related to the Tradition of
Kumayl. The Nuqtatu'l-Káf perhaps marks an intermediate stage in the
development of this line of Azali thought in that, although the link between
Azal and the Tradition of Kumayl is made44 nevertheless, Mirza Yahya is
never called Subh-i Azal in this text. He is always referred to as Jinab-i Azal
or Hadrat-i Azal.

Second, we have another exegesis by the Bab of the Kumayl Tradition in the
Kitab al-Asma 45. Here, referring to the fifth phrase in the Tradition, he
states: "Verily, the Primal Point is the Sun of Eternity (azal)." This would
indicate that he considered himself to be the referent in this phrase of the
Tradition of Kumayl.

Following on from my paper on "Messianic Concealment and Theophanic
Disclosure", I would venture to suggest that what the Bab was predicting in
the Seven Proofs and the Commentary on the Verse of Light was in fact the
fruition of his ministry in its fifth year through his open proclamation of the
station of qa'imiyyat and mazhariyyat (the end of the period of messianic
concealment). Thus, in the words of the Commentary, the Divine Light that
was pre‑existent in Muhammad and `Ali (which is a Shi`i Tradition to
which the Bab also refers in this Commentary) will, in the year 5, become
incarnated in a human being ‑ the light becomes flesh!
