   Preparing Bahá’í Communities in the East and West

to Embrace Gender Equality

Baharieh Rouhani Ma`ani

Introduction

The oneness of humankind is the pivotal principle of Bahá’u’lláh’s
revelation. Its realization is impossible without restoring to women
the human rights denied them since time immemorial. Gender equal-
ity, a principle revealed by Bahá’u’lláh, is an essential prerequisite
of the unity of humankind and one of the most difficult to achieve
worldwide. Inequality goes back many centuries. Its practice is rooted
in time-honored traditions and condoned in almost all past religions.
Eradicating a practice so long upheld and accepted by both men and
women as the way God had intended it to be requires patience, pains-
taking effort and supreme wisdom. The principle of gender equality
was revealed by Bahá’u’lláh; the ground for its meaningful achievement
was laid by `Abdu’l-Bahá during His ministry. This paper deals with
the intricacies involved and the remarkable way He dealt with the
matter. It examines some of His writings revealed in honor of the
Bahá’í women in Iran and North America, and the methods He
used to utilize their energy and capabilities for the furtherance of
the Cause of God. The paper also looks at the practical ways He
educated Bahá’í men to accept women as their equal. Finally, it
discusses the glowing result He achieved in a relatively short time.

The Establishment of Bahá’í Communities:
Historical Background
1\. The Establishment of Bahá’í Communities in the East
The arenas of Bábí activities, which began with the declaration of the
Báb in Shiraz, Iran in May 1844, were Iran and Iraq. The Báb was
born in Shiraz in 1819 and executed in Tabriz in 1850. During His
ministry, many embraced His Cause and Bábí communities were
established in numerous centers in the two countries where His
Faith spread.

Bahá’u’lláh, for Whose Advent The Báb had come to prepare the
people, was also a native of Iran. He was born in Tihran in 1817 and
embraced the Bábí Faith shortly after The Báb declared His Mission.
Bahá’u’lláh’s active involvement in promoting the Bábí Faith and
His leadership of the community, after the martyrdom of The Báb,
made Him a target for severe persecution leading to His banishment
from Iran. He left for Baghdad in January 1853. Ten years later, as
He was leaving Baghdad for Constantinople (Istanbul) in spring
1863, Bahá’u’lláh declared that He was the One promised by all
past religions, Whose advent the Báb had heralded, and for Whom
He had sacrificed His life. Those who embraced Bahá’u’lláh’s Cause
became known as Bahá’ís. Bahá’u’lláh was further exiled to Adri-
anople (Edirne) and `Akká, where He passed away in 1892. During
His ministry (1863–1892), His Cause spread to more than a dozen
countries where Bahá’í communities were established.

2\. The Establishment of Bahá’í Communities in the West
Shortly after Bahá’u’lláh’s Ascension, Ebrahim Kheirallah, the first
Bahá’í of Syrian origin who had embraced the Cause of Bahá’u’lláh
in Cairo, Egypt around 1890, set foot on American soil.1 His settle-
ment in Chicago in February 1894 marked the beginning of the
establishment of a Bahá'í community in that city. Gradually the

Preparing Bahá’í Communities to Embrace Gender Equality

teachings of the nascent Faith spread and Bahá'í communities were
established in different parts of North America, whence it spread to
Europe and other parts of the western hemisphere.

The Principle of Gender Equality and Its Impact on
the Evolution of Bahá’í Institutions in the West

> As the number of new adherents in the United States swelled and their
> thirst for receiving more elaborate and clear guidance regarding the

> standing of the tenets of the Bahá’í Faith. To provide for this need,
`Abdu’l-Bahá sent emissaries consisting of Bahá’í men of recognized

> ability from the Middle East to visit North America. Among them
> was Mírzá Asadu’lláh-i-Isfahání.2 During his visit to the United
> States at the turn of the twentieth century, elected consultative
> bodies comprising of adult male Bahá'ís were elected. Whether this
> was a coincidence or happened by design, Mírzá Asadu’lláh has been
> credited with helping to organize the Bahá'í communities admin-
> istratively. Although renowned and knowledgeable, he was not free
> from the influences of time-honored traditions and gender-based
> biases of the Middle Eastern countries. When preparations were
> being made for consultative bodies to be elected, he supported the
view that women were not allowed to serve on them. It is interesting

to note that at that time American women had not yet gained the
> right to vote and gender equality still remained a distant dream.

> development, however, set in motion a long process of education by
`Abdu'l-Bahá, the aim of which was to prepare Bahá'í communities

> in the west to embrace the principle of gender equality. Although

> body which excluded women from its membership, He steered the

Lights of ‘Irfán Book Twelve

affairs in a manner that led to the Bahá'í women gaining the right to
be elected and the men to accept them as their equal in every respect.

As an authorized translation of the text of the Most Holy Book was
> unavailable, the western believers initially depended for their knowl-
> edge of the laws of the Kitáb-i-Aqdas on the understanding of male
> Bahá'ís from the Middle East.3 One of the laws of the Most Holy
> Book says: “The Lord hath ordained that in every city a House of
> Justice be established wherein shall gather counselors to the number
> of Bahá…”4 This verse refers to the establishment of Local Houses of
> Justice and makes no reference to the gender of the members. In the
> same Book, Bahá'u'lláh speaks of the “Seat of Justice”, admonishes
“its men to observe pure justice…”, and also addresses the “Men of

Justice!”5 In the early stages of the development of the Faith and until
`Abdu'l-Bahá made the intent of the law clear, although Bahá'ís in

> the east and the west were aware of the principle of gender equality,
> they generally believed that all Houses of Justice excluded women
> from their membership. Considering the heightened level of gen-
> der bias, which had traditionally kept women outside the arena of
> decision-making institutions, this was not surprising. The erroneous
> understanding of the Bahá'í law was, however, challenged by some
> western women believers during the ministry of `Abdu'l-Bahá. With
> supreme wisdom He gradually disclosed the intent of the law which
> made it possible for women to serve on all the institutions of the
> Faith save that of the Universal House of Justice.

The first “House of Justice”, later named the “House of Spirituality”,
was elected in Chicago in early 1900. The election took place during
the prolonged visit of Mírzá Asadu’lláh. This institution as well as
the Council Board formed in New York later that year excluded
women from their membership.6

According to Nathan Rutstein, author of Corinne True, “They had
seen a copy of the Kitáb-i-Aqdas, which mentions the development of

Preparing Bahá’í Communities to Embrace Gender Equality

Houses of Justice. So, even though the Master didn’t request the believers
to organize administratively, some prominent Chicago Bahá’ís felt they
should. After all, He hadn’t said they couldn’t… people like Thornton
Chase believed that organizing the Faith would protect it from confusion
and schism.”7 For reasons of prudence, `Abdu'l-Bahá advised that it be
not called the House of Justice, therefore it was called the ‘House of
Spirituality.’ As already stated, women were initially excluded from
its membership. Some women, prominent among them Corinne
True, felt uneasy about the exclusion of women. Rutstein writes:

> Corinne True followed the development of the House of
> Spirituality keenly. It bothered her that women weren’t
> allowed to serve on the body. She didn’t protest, but instead
> made a commitment to try to change the membership to
> include women…she was sure that Bahá'u'lláh had inaugu-
> rated a new era, in which women would realize equal status
> with men. But many of the early Bahá'ís … didn’t subscribe
> to Corinne True’s beliefs.8

> Corinne True referred the matter to `Abdu'l-Bahá', the Successor of
> Bahá'u'lláh and the authorized Interpreter of His Writings.9 Her
> missive is unavailable, but it is not difficult to surmise from the
> response she received what the contents of her letter were. A part of
`Abdu'l-Bahá’s response reads:

> … in the sight of Bahá, women are accounted the same as men,
> and God hath created all humankind in His own image, and
> after His own likeness. That is, men and women alike are the
> revealers of His names and attributes, and from the spiritual
> viewpoint there is no difference between them. Whoso-
> ever draweth nearer to God, that one is the most favoured,
> whether man or woman. How many handmaids, ardent and
> devoted, hath, within the sheltering shade of Bahá, proved
> superior to the men, and surpassed the famous of the earth.

In the same Tablet, He says

> The House of Justice, however, according to the explicit text
> of the Law of God, is confined to men; this for a wisdom
> of the Lord God’s, which will ere long be made manifest as
> clearly as the sun at high noon.10

The contents of this Tablet praising the ardent and devoted women
believers who, He says, had proved superior to the men and surpassed
the famous of the earth came to them as a real surprise. How do we
know this? A Tablet revealed by `Abdu'l-Bahá in honor of Thornton
Chase makes this clear. The Tablet reads:

> It may be that letters addressed to the women believers do
> indeed contain certain passages written by way of encour-
> agement, but the purpose of such passages is to show that,
> in this new age, some of the women have outshone some of
> the men – not that all women have excelled all men! The
> members of the Spiritual Assembly should do all they can
> to provide encouragement to the women believers. In this
> dispensation one should not think in terms of “men” and
“women”[,] all are under the shadow of the Word of God and,

> as they strive the more diligently, so shall their reward be the
> greater – be they men or women or the frailest of people.11

> The second part of the Tablet to Corinne True refers to the “explicit
> text of the Law of God”12 according to which, `Abdu'l-Bahá says,
“[t]he House of Justice … is confined to men.” He also speaks of “a

> wisdom of the Lord God’s, which will ere long be made manifest as
> clearly as the sun at high noon.” It is most significant that `Abdu’l-
> Bahá speaks not of a reason, but a “wisdom” for the exclusion of
> women from membership on the House of Justice. Had He spoken
> of “a reason”, men would have been confirmed in their belief that
> something inherent in women makes them unfit to serve on the

Preparing Bahá’í Communities to Embrace Gender Equality

House of Justice. `Abdu'l-Bahá speaks of a “wisdom”, but provides
no clue to help humanity to unravel it. He actually defers its mani-
festation to a future date. He also speaks of the “explicit text of the
Law” without identifying it. Moreover, He does not make the intent
of the Law clear.

Wisdom, Its Role and Significance in Scripture

Wisdom is a word repeatedly used in Bahá’í Writings. To understand
its different meanings to the best degree possible, we need to examine
the concept as it has been used in the Writings, which is outside the
scope of this discussion. Suffice it to say here that one kind of wisdom
is inscrutable to all but God. Another is the kind that only appointed
interpreters comprehend. A third is the kind that is within the realm
of possibility for human beings to understand, but requires time.
The wisdom of which `Abdu’l-Bahá speaks in His Tablet to Corinne
True does not fall under the first two categories, for He says erelong it
will be made manifest very clearly, like the sun at high noon. Corinne
True was eager to know the reason for women’s exclusion from mem-
bership on the House of Justice. `Abdu’l-Bahá did not provide a reason.
Instead, He spoke of a wisdom. Why? One may observe:

Reason requires a premise. A premise is “a statement of fact or a suppo-
sition made or implied as a basis of argument.” Reason is “a statement
offered in explanation or justification.” It requires “due exercise of the
faculty of logical thought.”13

By contrast, wisdom does not require a premise. It is defined as “(pos-
session of) experience and knowledge together with the power of
applying them critically or practically.”14

As stated earlier, had `Abdu’l-Bahá used the word “reason”, it would
have caused everyone to look for something inherently wrong with

Lights of ‘Irfán Book Twelve

women to justify their exclusion from membership on the elective
arm of the Administrative Order. Were there a reason, `Abdu'l-Bahá
would have pronounced it when the world was ready and eager to
hear and accept it. In His Writings and discourses `Abdu'l-Bahá says
that lack of education had kept women backward and in the back-
ground. Women had not chosen to be uneducated; this injustice, like
many others, had been imposed upon them by a patriarchal society.
Moreover, the removal of the cause should remove the effect, which
is not the case here.

> The term “wisdom” shifted the believers’ attention from centering
> focus and dwelling on women’s inferiority, which they thought had
> made women unsuitable to serve on decision-making institutions,
> to something they were incapable of comprehending. The focus on
“reason” had traditionally led to the degradation of women’s status in

> religion. The focus on “wisdom” was the first step in implementing the
> principle of gender equality. Bahá'u'lláh had already dealt with men’s
> perceived superiority when He revealed: “[T]he Pen of the Most
> High hath lifted distinctions from between His servants and hand-
> maidens … hath broken the back of vain imaginings with the sword
> of utterance and hath obliterated the perils of idle fancies through
> the pervasive power of His might.”15

Fully aware of the social requirements of the time and the incapacity
of a society utterly unprepared for grasping the significance of the
principle of gender equality, `Abdu'l-Bahá dealt with a persistent
question in a way that did not disrupt the progress of the Faith at that
early stage of its development. He focused on educating the commu-
nity by encouraging women to forge ahead in the teaching field. He
guided them to found Spiritual Assemblies. Addressing the women
believers, He said:

> …O ye…handmaids who are enamored of the heavenly fra-
> grances, arrange ye holy gatherings, and found ye Spiritual

Preparing Bahá’í Communities to Embrace Gender Equality

> Assemblies, for these are the basis for spreading the sweet
> savors of God, exalting His Word, promulgating His religion
> and promoting His Teachings, and what bounty is there
> greater than this…16

At the same time, He made it known to all that male superiority was
caused by physical force and the exigency of the primitive age of the
human race, that distinction based on gender was not in God’s plan
for creation, that the injustices women had suffered as a result of
their unequal status with men had to be rectified. He emphasized
that women, too, were made in the image of God, affirmed that in
the sight of God men and women are the same, and prepared the
men to accept women as their equal. Had He explained at the outset
what the intent of the Law was, had He overruled the men whose
misunderstanding of the intent of the Law had caused the confu-
sion, those men and their supporters would have been startled, nay
dismayed, and chaos would have ensued. Divine wisdom dictated that
the intent of the Law be gradually disclosed, and that the believers be
given ample time to be educated to accept the outcome. This conjec-
ture is confirmed by the contents of a Tablet revealed in honor of one
or more female believers in Tihran, which will be discussed later in
this paper.

The events that took place following the revelation of the Tablet to
Corinne True unravel how `Abdu'l-Bahá prepared the community
for women’s membership on National and Local Houses of Justice
in a way that when the time came, the transition was smooth and
the outcome was accepted by all. The key to the smooth transition
was the women’s obedience to `Abdu'l-Bahá’s directives. They did as
He had advised and focused their energies more than ever before on
teaching the nascent Faith and spreading the Cause of God in the
United States and abroad. They founded an “Assembly of Teach-
ing” and outdid the men in the arena of promoting the Cause of
Bahá'u'lláh. For a while the House of Spirituality and the Assembly

of Teaching operated as parallel institutions. This anomaly, which
was causing confusion, was dealt with successfully with the coopera-
tion of the women. However, the question of the exclusion of women
from membership on the House of Spirituality did not go away. In
response to further questions, `Abdu'l-Bahá confirmed the eligibility
of women for membership on local and national Bahá'í institutions.
This was contrary to the understanding of those who had initially
thought otherwise. By this time, the process of educating the believers
to understand the implications of gender equality had taken root; the
believers understood and accepted the intent of the Law, as explained
by `Abdu'l-Bahá':

> According to the ordinances of the Faith of God, women are
> the equals of men in all rights save only that of membership
> on the Universal House of Justice, for as hath been stated in
> the text of the Book, both the head and the members of the
> House of Justice are men.

He further stated:

> in all other bodies, such as the Temple Construction Com-
> mittee, the Teaching Committee, the Spiritual Assembly,
> and in charitable and scientific associations, women share
> equally in all rights with men.17

> In this Tablet `Abdu'l-Bahá not only reveals the intent of the Law
> by confirming women’s eligibility for membership on all institutions
“save only that of membership on the Universal House of Justice”, but

He also identifies “the text of the Book,” according to which, He says,
“both the head and the members of the House of Justice are men.”

In the Kitáb-i-Aqdas, Bahá'u'lláh alludes to the institution of
Guardianship.18 In His Will and Testament `Abdu'l-Bahá delin-
eates the manner of the election of the Universal House of Justice

and designates the Guardian of the Cause of God as “its sacred head
and the distinguished member for life of that body.”19 The text of the
Book mentioned in this context may, therefore, be a reference to His
Will and Testament.

In the initial Tablet to Corinne True, the ineligibility of women for
membership on the “House of Justice”, which was understood to
include all Houses of Justice, was linked to a wisdom of Lord God’s.
For that wisdom to be made manifest in a way that everyone would
see it clearly, time was needed to prepare the ground for women’s
membership on all the institutions of the Faith, save that of the
Universal House of Justice. To prove to the men that women had the
ability to enter all fields of service and excel in what they did, and also
to prove to the women that they were up to the task, `Abdu'l-Bahá
encouraged some capable women to undertake responsibilities that
until then had been reserved for men. For example, it was through
His encouragement that Corinne True became involved with looking
for land and with the finances of the Mother Temple of the West.
Her active involvement and success was instrumental in her mem-
bership on the Temple Unity Board, a prelude to the election of the
National Spiritual Assembly of the Bahá'ís of the United States and
Canada. Her dedicated services to the Faith, which were demon-
strated most ably, were widely recognized and revealed to skeptics
among the believers that, as `Abdu'l-Bahá had stated, when women
and men are given equal opportunities, they prove equal to the task.
At the first National Bahá'í Convention of North America, two
women were elected to the National Spiritual Assembly, Corinne
True being one of them. Everyone accepted the outcome without
hesitation. Women’s eligibility for election on decision-making bodies
had by then become an established fact.

The question of the ineligibility of women for membership on the
Universal House of Justice, however, persisted. It was raised again
during the ministry of Shoghi Effendi and has been raised since the

establishment of the Universal House of Justice. The responses have
been invariably based on `Abdu’l-Bahá’s Tablets on the subject, espe-
cially the one quoted above. In a letter written on behalf of Shoghi
Effendi, dated 28 July 1930, it is stated:

> …[T]here is a Tablet from `Abdu'l-Bahá in which He defi-
> nitely states that the membership of the Universal House
> is confined to men, and that the wisdom of it will be fully
> revealed and appreciated in the future. In the local as well
> as the national Houses of Justice, however, women have the
> full right of membership. It is, therefore, only to the Interna-
> tional House that they cannot be elected.”

In the same letter, the Bahá'ís are advised to “accept this statement
of the Master in a spirit of deep faith, confident that there is a divine
guidance and wisdom behind it which will be gradually unfolded to
the eyes of the world.20

The Response of the Bahá’ís of Iran to the
Principle of Gender Equality
The genesis of organized Bahá’í activity in Iran is not as clearly described
and documented as that in the West. Once a general history of the
Faith in the land of its birth becomes available, it will explain how it
all started. For the time being what is known is this: the first group
of believers who, in their rudimentary understanding of Bahá’u’lláh’s
commandment in the Kitáb-i-Aqdas “that in every city a House of
Justice be established”21 came together and formed an Assembly for
the purpose of looking after the affairs of the community, were all
men and initially self-appointed. The membership continued to be
all-male long after it became an elected institution.

The women’s exclusion from membership on elected Bahá'í insti-
tutions was not initially an issue in Iran. Based on traditional
practices, everyone accepted the notion that women were excluded
from decision-making institutions, as though it was the intent of the
Law revealed in the Kitáb-i-Aqdas. As a result of social conditioning,
also because of the prejudices that had kept women in a degraded state,
women’s exclusion from membership on elected Bahá'í institutions in
Iran continued for several decades. In his Ten Year global Plan (1953-
1963) Shoghi Effendi made the eligibility for election of the Iranian
Bahá'í women a goal of that Plan for Iran to achieve. At the end of
the first year of that Plan, i.e. during Ridván 1954, women, who until
then had the right to elect, for the first time enjoyed the right to be
elected as well. Even then the mental block, which considered Iranian
women unworthy of serving on elected Bahá'í institutions, made it
most difficult for women to be elected. The first woman elected to
the National Spiritual Assembly of Iran was Adelaide Sharpe, an
American Bahá'í woman serving in Iran. Many Local Assemblies
had only one, or no female member, for quite a while after 1954.
Therefore, the process of educating the masses about gender equality
had to continue much longer. For those who wonder why no Iranian
Bahá'í woman was ever appointed a Hand of the Cause of God, or
why none has served as a Counselor in the land of Bahá'u'lláh’s birth,
this should provide at least a partial answer.

While `Abdu'l-Bahá was preparing the friends in the West for the
implementation of the principle of gender equality, He was also lay-
ing the ground for its realization in the East. In numerous Tablets,
He encouraged the women to emulate the example of the Bahá'í
women in America and Europe, and even outdo them in the arena of
service. In one of His Tablets we read:

> O ye leaves who have attained certitude! In the countries of
> Europe and America the maidservants of the Merciful have
> won the prize of excellence and advancement from the arena

> of men, and in the fields of teaching and spreading the divine
> fragrances they have shown a brilliant hand. Soon they will
> soar like the birds of the Concourse on high in the far corners
> of the world and will guide the people and reveal to them
> the divine mysteries. Ye, who are the blessed leaves from the
> East, should burn more brightly, and engage in spreading the
> sweet savors of the Lord and in reciting the verses of God.
> Arise, therefore, and exert yourselves to fulfill the exhorta-
> tions and counsels of the Blessed Beauty, that all hopes may
> be realized and that the plain of streams and orchards may
> become the garden of oneness.22

When the initial stirrings of collective consciousness moved the women
believers in Tihran to action, their initiative showed promise when
some men of goodwill offered their wholehearted support. At that
crucial juncture, `Abdu'l-Bahá encouraged some western women to go
to Iran and extend to the women and their supporters a helping hand.

Although the Revelation of Bahá'u'lláh had sparked in the hearts
of the women believers the fire of hope and although they knew that
one day they would achieve equality of status with men, that glorious
future seemed to them very distant. With Tahirih (Qurratu’l-`Ayn)
the process of gender equality had begun, but the road to its real-
ization seemed thorny and filled with hazards. The Iranian women
needed concrete examples and living role models to turn their
dreams into reality; they needed all the support they could get. They
had seen the glimmerings of organized Bahá'í community life and
activities in Tihran where men had spontaneously formed institu-
tions that looked after the affairs of the community. They had also
witnessed the establishment of a Bahá'í Boys School in 1900 that was
successfully educating the boys. They wished to establish a school
for the girls. Some even initiated private enterprises with the help of
some men of goodwill, but the progress was painfully slow because
resources were scarce and community support negligible.

The first to respond to `Abdu'l-Bahá’s call was Dr. Susan Moody.
She settled in Tihran in early 1909, and began working in earnest
to improve the health condition of women. She also provided crucial
help in establishing a Bahá'í girls school, similar to that of the Tar-
bíyat Boys School, albeit on a much smaller scale. About a year after
her arrival in Tehran, she wrote to the American Bahá'ís in February
1910 and conveyed this joyous news:

> …The girls’ school is assured. They will start with accommo-
> dations for fifty pupils… Please tell any who want to help
> that it will take only $1.50 per month to educate a girl. There
> are many here too poor to pay and this is the way to help lift
> Persia from her otherwise hopeless condition.23

Dr. Moody was instrumental in seeking `Abdu'l-Bahá’s approval for
recruiting the services of Ms. Lillian Kappes, an American Bahá'í
educator, to teach in the Girls School.

Before going to Iran, Lillian Kappes was aware of the plight of
women in that country. She knew that men dominated over the
affairs of women and did not think much of their education. She was
aware of the challenges that she was going to face in carrying out her
work. What she did not know was that her male colleagues would
stand in the way of her effectiveness in providing for the education of
girls. Fortunately, on her way to Iran, she had met `Abdu'l-Bahá in
Switzerland and had been to some degree prepared for the challenges
ahead. Nonetheless, at times she found the situation unbearable.
For example, she had to administer the girls’ school almost single-
handedly yet without any autonomy. The school had been initially
established as a department of the boys’ school and the education
committee, composed of male Bahá'ís, was principally concerned
with the needs of the boys’ school. Miss Kappes was circumscribed in
her efforts and could not make much progress. The prolongation of
this difficult situation affected her health. In 1916 Dr. Sarah Clock,

another American Bahá'í who had gone to Iran to help Dr. Moody’s
work, sent a letter to some Bahá'í women in the United States, and
disclosed the reality of the situation:

> Yesterday Miss K [Kappes] was simply abused by the meet-
> ing of 5 men, came home in perfect nervous collapse & was
> awake all night from sheer nervousness & worry…., Not
> long ago a tablet came to a Persian here praising Miss K &
> her work in the school … she has the moral support of many
> of the best men, all the women who in an excited meeting
> all stood y her. ….if Miss Kappes were not a Bahai or not
> less than a saint she would not have put up with all she has,
> for five years her hands have been tied, that is they have not
> allowed her to use her own advanced ideas as to a school. …
> some of the good men are entirely with her. They offer to
> open another school for her & several of the nicest of the
> girls will teach for nothing.24

In a country tightly held in the grip of male domination, where women
could not and did not actively participate in any decision-making
process, the presence of a few women, who posed a challenge to the
traditional way of life, was a mighty tool in exposing the prejudices
that had led to women’s degraded status. Unlike an early emissary
to the west who had informed the nascent Bahá'í community of the
United States to exclude women from membership on elected insti-
tutions, the American Bahá'í women taught the women in Iran how
to achieve equal status with men and prepare to serve with them on
Bahá'í institutions. They taught by example that, given opportunities
for advancement, women could do as well as their male counterparts.
Encouraged by the achievements of their Bahá'í sisters, some Iranian
female believers learned to become assertive and to claim their God-
given rights. By doing so, they became entangled in a controversial
issue for which the generality of men in Iran had no sympathy, even

> forbid, it will end in argumentation between men and women.”27 He
> then provided an example, something that had been done contrary

“As in the question of the veil, nothing should be done contrary to

wisdom.”28 He then exhorted the women:

> The individual women should, today, follow a course of action
> which will be the cause of eternal glory to all womankind, so
> that all women will be illumined. And that lieth in gather-
> ing to learn how to teach, in holding meetings to recite the
> verses, to offer supplications to the kingdom of the Lord of
> evident signs, and to institute education for the girls. Ponder
> the manner in which Jináb-i-Táhirih used to teach. She was
> free from every concern, and for this reason she was resplen-
> dent. Now the world of women should be a spiritual world,
> not a political one, so that it will be radiant. The women of
> other nations are all immersed in political matters. Of what
> benefit is this, and what fruit doth it yield? To the extent
> that ye can, ye should busy yourselves with spiritual mat-
> ters which will be conducive to the exaltation of the Word of

> God and of the diffusion of His fragrances. Your demeanour
> should lead to harmony amongst all and to coalescence and
> the good-pleasure of all….29

That the atmosphere between the men and women in Tihran was
tense causing concern, and that `Abdu'l-Bahá was trying with His
loving counsels to calm the situation, in order to hasten the imple-
mentation of the principle of gender equality, is evident from what
He said next:

> I am endeavouring, with Bahá'u'lláh’s confirmations and
> assistance, so to improve the world of the handmaidens
> that all will be astonished. This progress is intended to
> be in spirituality, in virtues, in human perfections and in
> divine knowledge.

To make the women conscious of a unbecoming behaviour, `Abdu'l-
Bahá refers to the situation of the women in America and remarks:

> In America, the cradle of women’s liberation, women are
> still debarred from political institutions because they
> squabble. They are yet to have a member in the House of
> Representatives.30

> It must be stated here that `Abdu’l-Bahá did not spare men from
> engaging in unbecoming behavior either. During His visit to North
> America, He related what He had experienced in France, which
> exposed a similar or worse characteristic in men. He said: “In France
> I was present at a session of the senate, but the experience was not
> impressive.” After explaining the object of true consultation, He says:
“In the parliamentary meeting mentioned, altercation and useless

> quibbling were frequent; the result, mostly confusion and turmoil;
> even in one instance a physical encounter took place between two
> members. It was not consultation but comedy.”31

In His Tablet to the Bahá’í women in Tihran, `Abdu’l-Bahá makes
reference to Bahá’u’lláh addressing the “men of the House of Justice”
which suggests that membership of Bahá’í institutions was one of
the points covered in the communications He had received. He
says: “Also Bahá’u’lláh hath proclaimed: ‘O ye men of the House of
Justice.’” It is interesting to note that in this Tablet, He does not
explain the intent of the Law. Could it be that the process of educa-
tion in Iran was incomplete and the ground was not yet ready for
making the intent of the Law clear? What comes next seems to con-
firm this conjecture:

> Ye need to be calm and composed, so that the work will pro-
> ceed with wisdom, otherwise there will be such chaos that
> ye will leave everything and run away. “This newly born babe
> is traversing in one night the path that needeth a hundred
> years to tread.” In brief, ye should now32 engage in matters
> of pure spirituality and not contend with men. `Abdu'l-Bahá
> will tactfully take appropriate steps. Be assured. In the end
> thou wilt thyself exclaim, “This was indeed supreme wis-
> dom!” I appeal to you to obliterate this contention between
> men and women ….33

He ends the Tablet thus:

> No one can on his own achieve anything. `Abdu'l-Bahá must
> be well pleased and assist.34

The theme of gender equality was time and again addressed by
`Abdu'l-Bahá during His travels in North America and Europe. His

> utterances have been compiled and published in “The Promulgation
> of Universal Peace,” “Paris Talks,” “Abdu’l-Bahá on Divine Philoso-
> phy”, and so forth. His statements on the subject have been included
> in the Compilation on Women. I quote here one statement, which

describes vividly the status of women at the time of Bahá'u'lláh’s Rev-
elation, and the progress made thereafter:

> The woman of the East has progressed. Formerly in India,
> Persia and throughout the Orient, she was not considered
> a human being. Certain Arab tribes counted their women
> in with the livestock. In their language the noun for woman
> also meant donkey; that is, the same name applied to both
> and a man’s wealth was accounted by the number of these
> beasts of burden he possessed. The worst insult one could
> hurl at a man was to cry out, “Thou woman!”

> From the moment Bahá'u'lláh appeared, this changed. He
> did away with the idea of distinction between the sexes, pro-
> claiming them equal in every capacity.

In former times it was considered wiser that woman should
> not know how to read or write; she should occupy herself
> only with drudgery. She was very ignorant. Bahá'u'lláh
> declares the education of woman to be of more importance
> than that of man. If the mother be ignorant, even if the father
> have great knowledge, the child’s education will be at fault,
> for education begins with the milk. A child at the breast is
> like a tender branch that the gardener can train as he wills.

> The East has begun to educate its women. Some there are in
> Persia who have become liberated through this cause, whose
> cleverness and eloquence the ‘ulamá cannot refute. Many of
> them are poets. They are absolutely fearless….

> I hope for a like degree of progress among the women of
> Europe – that each may shine like unto a lamp; that they
> may cry out the proclamation of the kingdom; that they may
> truly assist the men; nay, that they may be even superior to

> the men, versed in sciences and yet detached, so that the
> whole world may bear witness to the fact that men and
> women have absolutely the same rights. It would be a cause
> of great joy for me to see such women. This is useful work;
> by it woman will enter into the kingdom. Otherwise, there
> will be no results.35

When `Abdu'l-Bahá was in the United States, many newspaper
reporters and journalists interviewed Him. In some interviews He
responded to questions about gender equality and woman suffrage.
Almost a century ago, a newspaper in San Francisco published an
interview titled “Abdul Baha Suffrage Advocate – Sex Equality Need
for Progress.” One of the questions the interviewer asked was “How
about woman suffrage?” `Abdu'l-Bahá responded:

> The world of humanity is possessed of two wings, one rep-
> resented by the male, the other by the female. Both must be
> strong in order that the world of humanity may fly. Equality
> of rights and prerogatives of men and women is finding foot-
> hold in America faster than in other parts. Until suffrage
> is established, the body-politic will not achieve its progress.
> Women are the first educators of men. Hence womankind
> must be educated until they reach the level of man.36

Conclusion
The principle of gender equality revealed by Bahá’u’lláh in the mid-
Nineteenth Century is an essential prerequisite for the realization of
the unity of humankind, which is the ultimate goal of His revelation.
The principle was revealed when the world was steeped in prejudices
that had subjugated women and kept them under the thumb of the
authority of men. To restore to women the rights denied them for
many centuries, it was crucial to educate Bahá’í communities and

allow them sufficient time to gradually embrace the principle of gen-
der equality. This process began on a wide scale during the ministry
of `Abdu’l-Bahá and gained momentum when some awaked women
questioned the validity of the status quo which the generality of the
male believers wished to maintain. The strides taken to overcome
traditional barriers and gender biases which began during `Abdu’l-
Bahá’s ministry have been more successful in countries where women
have had the freedom to exercise their rights and prove their worth.
The process is destined to continue until full equality is achieved on
a worldwide scale.
