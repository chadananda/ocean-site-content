Singapore Women's Movement:
Challenges for the Next Millennium

Phyllis Ghim Lion Chew

Abstract

This article is a preliminary attempt to examine the relationship of
religion and the fight for women's rights in Singapore, which began with
the founding of the Singapore Council of Women. It sets out to chart and
analyse the reasons behind the Baha'i Faith's extraordinary engagement
in the women's movement in Singapore and to reflect on the broader
relationship between gender, religion and the women's movement. The
article concludes by examining some challenges for the next millennium
with regards to the relationship between gender and religion.

Introduction

Of the nine religions of Singapore listed in the book "Religions in
Singapore" published by the Inter-Religious Organisation of Singapore
(IRO),1 an organisation which attempts to inculcate the spirit of
friendship and co-operation among the leaders and followers of different
religions in the island republic, the Baha'i Faith can be said to be the
religion with the most direct and consistent involvement in the women's
movement, either in Singapore or in other parts of the world. This is a
unique and unusual phenomenon because religion's record in promoting
the advancement of women has not been exactly exemplary. While
typically in the early years of their existence, religions have tended to

Taoist, Christian, Muslim, Sikh, and Baha'i.

encourage the participation of women, historical evidence suggests a
gradual tendency among religious institutions over time to establish
practices and support attitudes that impede the development of women's
potential. Over time, religions have adopted a patriarchal framework of
interpretation and this has played a role in enforcing the subordinate
status of women.

The great religions of the world have been the most important source for
shaping and enforcing the image and role of women in culture and
society. It is the source for both vision and values as well as a source of
division and social fragmentation. This article is a preliminary attempt to
examine the relationship of religion and the fight for women's rights in
Singapore which began with the founding of the Singapore Council of
Women. I will attempt to chart and analyse the reason behind the Baha'i
Faith's extraordinary engagement in the women's movement in
Singapore and through such an attempt, reflect on the broader
relationship between gender, religion and the women's movement as a
whole. I will then conclude by examining some challenges for the next
millennium with regards to the relationship between gender and religion.

Such an examination is timely because such an inter-relationship has
rarely been commented on, much less published. Nevertheless, where
religion is concerned, there have been studies on religious trends in
Singapore and their implications through an analysis of the 1980 and
1990 census (Kuo 1989 and 1995). University academics such as Ling
(1987) and Clammer (1991), Tamriey and Hassan (1987) and Quah
(1989) have also written sociological accounts on religions in Singapore.
The IRO has published about fifteen published works, mainly speeches
of past conferences and the history of the various faiths.
Correspondingly, there have also been several published works on
gender. Books published by the Association of Women for Research and
Action (AWARE), a leading woman's group in Singapore, focuses only
on the history, social conditions, economic conditions, legal status, laws,
etc. concerning women (1998, 1996, 1999). So too do publications on
women's status by Wong and Leong (1993) and Lam-Lin and Chew
(1993). However, all these give inadequate attention to gender
differentiation in religion and do not uncover the patriarchal framework
of all-religious beliefs and practices. Their accounts have been mainly
descriptive, historical and statistical, and they do not focus on the gender

element in religion. In so doing, they also contribute to the "invisibility'
or marginality of women where Singapore religious life is concerned.

The Baha'i Faith in Singapore

Founded in Persia in 1844, the Baha'i Faith is the youngest independent
world religion. Baha'u'llah, its founder, is regarded by Baha'is as the
latest in a line of messengers of God that include Krishna, Abraham,
Moses, Zoroaster, Buddha, Christ, Muhammad and the Báb. The central
message of Baha'u'llah is the oneness or the unity of humankind.

To foster its basic principle of unity, the Faith teaches that one should
treat others as one would oneself wish to be treated, a not too unusual
tenet, which is also found in the other great religions. What is unique
however, is that the Baha'i Faith extends this basic principle
unequivocally to that of the relationship between men and women. In
other words, it believes that in order to establish justice, peace and order
in an interdependent world, this principle must guide all interactions,
including those between men and women. Men must use their influence
in the political, religious and social institutions which they control to
promote the systematic inclusion of women not out of condescension but
through the belief that the contribution of women is valuable to the
progress of society. Women on their part must be educated and come
forward and contribute their skills to every aspect of social, economic
and political development.

There are Baha'i administrative bodies in almost all countries of the
world. In Singapore, the first Baha'i administrative body, known as a
Local Spiritual Assembly, was incorporated in July 1952. Since then the
community has been active but relatively low-key. In 1956, it organised
the first World Religion Day, an occasion whereby members of different
Faiths come together to talk and discuss important issues in the spirit of
inter-faith harmony. The occasion was graced by the attendance of the
Chief Minister of Singapore, Mr Lim Yew Hock. He was so impressed
with the Faith that in the following year, when the Baha'i community
applied for a cemetery, it was awarded one, an act symbolic of the
recognition by the Singapore Government of the Baha'i Faith's

6             THE SINGAPORE BAHA' I STUDIES REVIEW

independent status. In 1972, the BaháT Faith was awarded a license to
solemnise marriages in the Republic. In 1995, the practice of organising
a World Religion Day was reactivated and such an occasion once again
served to publicise the BaháT Faith's commitment to inter-religious
harmony. Yet another milestone was achieved in 1997 when the BaháT
Faith was admitted to the IRO as a full member. It was also highlighted
in 1999 as one of the nine religious faiths in Singapore in a postage
stamp issued by the Postal Authorities of Singapore.

Presently, the Singapore BaháT community has a membership of 2000
and today there are five Local Spiritual Assemblies in Singapore. These
five assemblies are under the jurisdiction of the Spiritual Assembly of
the BaháTs of Singapore, a national body incorporated in Singapore in
1972\.2 Together, they oversee a wide variety of activities including the
education of children, devotional services, study classes, discussion
groups, social events, the observance of holy days, marriages and funeral
ceremonies.

The Singapore Women's Movement: the First Wave

The BaháT Faith was instrumental in initiating the first women's
movement in Singapore. The names of two BaháT women in particular
come to mind here. One was Mrs Shirin Fozdar (1905-1992), the
Honorary Secretary of the Singapore Council of Women (SCW) from
1952-1961 and the other was Mrs George Lee (Mdm Tan Cheng Hsiang)
(1904-1999), the President of the SCW from 1952- 1971. The activities
of the SCW signalled the first real attempt of women to form a broad-
based umbrella body to fight for social reforms and increase their status
with respect to men in society.3

Both Mrs Fozdar and Mrs Lee were chiefly responsible for formulating
the advocacy work of the SCW and keeping its agenda in the public eye.
While Mrs Lee, as President, held the helm and met with government
agencies and foreign visitors on behalf of the SCW, it was her fiery and
eloquent secretary who was the better known, and who created most of

the publicity for the SCW. Mrs Fozdar's public speaking abilities made
her the natural spokesperson for the SCW and the darling of the media
during the term of her tenure. Mrs Lee, on the other hand was reticent,
soft-spoken and more comfortable in playing a background role.
Nevertheless, she provided a good balance to her dynamic secretary:
being Mandarin and Hokkien-speaking she was the natural magnet for
the Chinese-speaking membership of the SCW.

Mrs Shirin Fozdar was born in Bombay, India, of Persian-Baha'i parents
in 1905. She had begun the fight for the emancipation of women in
India when she was a teenager. Her involvement in the women's
movement in India culminated in her nomination in 1934 as the
representative of the All Asian Women's conference executive
committee on women's rights at the League of Nations in Geneva. Mrs
George Lee, on the other hand, was born in Singapore, was educated in
English and Chinese, and did what most women of her generation did,
managed the home and children. She was a member of the Methodist
Girls' School Alumni Association and the first wife of newspaper owner
and industrialist, Mr George Lee. Influenced by the Baha'i views on the
rights of women and the relationship of that principle to world peace,
her life took on an extra dimension - changing from that of contented
homemaker to that of women' advocate. She became convinced that
women's rights were essentially human rights. As she was herself a
victim of the then pervasive Chinese customary practice of polygamy,
she persuaded Mrs Fozdar that the abolition of such a practice should be
the main focus of the SCW and that it should be used as a symbol of the
injustices faced by women in Singapore.

There were also other women from other religious denominations who
were involved in this first awakening. The first executive committee of
the Singapore Council of Women comprised, in fact, more Christian
than Baha'i women. Christian women, however, were more comfortable
occupying the middle and lower executive positions. A good example
was Mrs E. V. Davies (also known as Mrs Checha Davies) who, as
membership chair of the SCW, recruited new members for the Council,
helping its membership to grow, within a few years, to 2000 in 1955.
She was a staunch Christian who believed that the essence of a religious
life was in the doing rather than the talking. She was the daughter of a
lay preacher in Kerala, India and an active member of the Tamil

Methodist Church in Singapore. While committing much of her time to
the overseeing of SCW social projects for needy women, she
deliberately kept out of the limelight where controversial issues on
equality were voiced.4

Mrs Constance Goh Kok Kee (nee Wee Sai Poh), another member of the
SCW during its inception, was an active member of Wesley Methodist
Church and the General Conference of Women's Society for Christian
Service. She was chiefly responsible for the moderate aspect of the
SCW's agenda such as family-planning, the education of women and the
formation of a girl's club, rather than its better known public stand on
anti-polygamy and one-man-one-wife campaign. Another founder
member and protem President of the SCW, Mrs Elizabeth Choy, was
also a committed Christian and keen to play her part in the upliftment of
women. Through her contacts with members of the Legislative Council,
of which she was member from 1951-1956, the SCW was able to
network with the political elite. Another protem committee member was
Mrs Robert Eu, a City Councillor from 1949-1957 and founder-principal
of the Pay a Lebar Methodist Girls' School who gave much moral
support to the SCW. Other Christian members were Mrs Seow Peck
Leng, Mrs Shufen Khoo and Mrs H. B. Amstutz, wife of the Methodist
bishop in Singapore. The expatriate women members such as Mrs R. A.
Pohan, Mrs Winifred Holmes and Mrs V. W. West were also Christians.
The Christian element was strong because they made up the better-
educated and more socially conscious segment of the population. They
were by and large against the practice of polygamy, which was then
practised largely by the Buddhist-Taoist-Confucianist and Muslim
segment of the population.

While the SCW contained mainly Baha'i and Christian English-speaking
women, it was the Baha'i component which was chiefly responsible for
the advocacy work. Generally, while accepting that the abolition of
polygamy would be good for all, Christian women did not feel
comfortable with the clear and unequivocal stand of Mrs Fozdar and
Mrs Lee with regards to the principle of the equality of the sexes. Thus
while Mrs Elizabeth Choy used her influence as Legislative Council
member to get the SCW off to a good start, her role as member was

largely symbolic after the first year. Mrs Seow Peck Leng found Mrs
Fozdar's ideas "too radical" but admitted that "without her the women's
rights movement wouldn't have begun."5 In the same way, while Mrs
Constance Goh was generous in her financial support to the SCW, she
was comfortable only with its educational and social aspects. The
following statement in a letter by Mrs Goh to Mrs Fozdar in 1952
epitomised the ideological difference between the Baha'i and Christian
coalition: "I do feel that we shall achieve most of our aims if we show
that we are out to assess the needs of the women of Singapore and the
potential contribution they would make to the community given the
opportunity and facilities, rather than to stress fighting for one's rights."6

Muslim Ordinance of 1957

A distinguishing aspect of the SCW fight for the institution of anti-
polygamous laws was that it was not just aimed at Chinese marriages but
also at Muslim marriages. This was because more than half of the Malay
marriages ended in divorce. The laws governing divorce then were lax,
the husband having only to pronounce a ritual formula stating to his wife
"I divorce you". If the husband pronounced a triple "talak", stating "I
divorce you" three times in succession, the divorce became irrevocable.

Baha'i women were therefore in the forefront of consciousness raising
for Muslim women in Singapore. Indeed, there were Muslim members in
the SCW. Two Muslim women, Cik Zahara bte. Noor Mohammed and
Mrs Azizah Izmail, sat on its executive committee. However, Muslim
women generally kept a low profile for fear of reprimand from their
husbands.7 Being familiar with Muslim laws, Mrs Fozdar became their
spokeswoman in the 1950's. Indeed, her attempts to uplift the status of
Muslim women brought her headlong into conflict with the conservative
members of the Muslim Advisory Board (MAB), the body responsible
for advising the government on social, cultural, economic and religious

matters pertaining to Muslims. In an interview, Mrs Fozdar recalled
threats made on her life from irate husbands keen to hold on to such
privileges.8

It was Mrs Fozdar's idea to highlight the plight of Muslim women by the
distribution of handbills in the kampongs. These handbills quoted the
Koran: "And if you fear that you cannot act equitably towards orphans,
then marry such women as seem good to you, two and three and four;
but if you fear that you will not do justice (between them) then (marry)
only one or what your right hand possess (i.e. females taken as prisoners
of war); this is more proper that you may not deviate from the course.9
This activity was stopped in mid-course by the police who feared a
breach of peace, reminiscent of the Maria Hertogh riots in 195010.

In 1954, as a means of putting pressure on the MAB, Mrs Fozdar sent a
petition to a member of the House of Commons in England, Stanley
Awbery, decrying the terrible insecurity of married life in Singapore and
the opposition the SCW was encountering in its attempts to initiate
reforms. Mrs Fozdar argued that while the SCW had a sizeable number
of Malay supporters, a few leaders of the Malays "who are mostly
themselves either Arabs, Persians or Indians and who are rich and can
indulge in polygamy are opposed to any change." Moreover, these men
were "backed by the Kathis (priests) who had made a business out of
frequent marriages and divorces."11 The petition prompted Awbery to
ask the Secretary of State for the colonies in the House of Commons (in
London) to report on the divorce rate in Singapore as well as what steps
were being taken to tighten the marriage and divorce laws.

of Dutch parents given to a Malay family for adoption during the Japanese occupation in
Singapore. The battle for her custody began as a dispute between two families but soon
developed social implications. Racial sensitivity, religious fanaticism and radical
nationalist politics were involved. The issue became a battle between two cultures and
religion.

The activities of the SCW extended across the Causeway. Aware that the
marriage laws in the Federation of Malaysia were more flexible and that
many Malay men wishing to avoid the stricter laws in Singapore could
go across to nearby Johore to be married, the SCW viewed changes in
the Federation of Malaya as a necessary adjunct to their activities. In
1955, a petition was sent to all the Sultans in the States of Malaya asking
them to use their influence to raise the marriage age of girls to 16, to
encourage monogamy and to make the education of girls compulsory. In
addition, Mrs Fozdar wrote to President Gemal Abdul Nassar of Egypt,
than the dominant force in Arab politics, asking him to come to the
rescue of Muslim women all over the world and to legislate for
monogamous marriage, so that other Muslim countries could follow the
progressive trend in Egypt.

Such actions played their part in pressurising the MAB for reforms and
the Board eventually agreed to a provision of the Muslim Ordinance,
which became law in 1957. The ordinance basically provided for the
establishment of a Muslim law court (Syariah Court) in 1958 so as to
make the process of divorce more difficult. Its enactment resulted in a
marked decline in the divorce rate among Muslims.13

The Women's Charter of 1961

While the Muslim Ordinance of 1957 was a sterling victory for Muslim
women, the Women's Charter of 1961 was a landmark victory for non-
Muslim women. Once again, the roots of this Charter can be traced to
1954 when Mrs Fozdar initiated a bill ("Singapore Prevention of
bigamous Marriages Ordinance"), calling for the minimum marriage age
to be raised to sixteen and for bigamous marriages to be made void, for
the attention of the Legislative Council.14 This was uneventful due to
strong opposition from the Chinese, Tamil and Muslim Advisory
Boards. Not one to be impeded by initial setbacks, both Mrs Fozdar and
Mrs Lee lobbied for women's rights with politicians from newly

\[13\] While the divorce rate was 51.7% in 1957 (the year of the passing of the Ordinance),
it fell to 49.2% in 1958, to 36.8 % in 1959, to 26.9% in 1960 and to 21.8% in 1961. By
1962, the Singapore divorce rate was 26.8%.

established political parties such as the Labour Front and the People's
Action Party (PAP), formed to contest for seats in the Singapore
Legislative Council of 1955. In addition, Mrs Fozdar accepted numerous
engagements to speak on radio and public lectures, most of which were
highlighted in the press. One notable public engagement was at the
International Women's Day Conference organised by the Women's
League of the PAP on 8th March 1956 where Mrs Fozdar urged the
crowd to support their stand on the abolition of polygamy. It was on this
occasion that a resolution was passed for the first time by the League in
support of the principle of monogamy, and which was subsequently
moved during the Party's annual general meeting inl957. 15

When the PAP won the election of 1959, they kept their promises to
women made in their election manifesto. Thus, the Women's Charter
was enacted in 1961, which protected the status and welfare of women
in Singapore with regards to marriage and divorce. It also abolished
polygamy among non-Muslims and changed the whole framework of
Chinese marriages. All marriages had to be legally registered from 1961
and those done solely through customary Chinese rites were not
recognised as legal.

The successful passing of the Charter also saw the departure of Mrs
Fozdar to Yasothorn, an impoverished Northeastern region of Thailand,
to start a school for girls, as a means of rescuing them from prostitution
and a life of drudgery. Without the driving force of Mrs Fozdar, and
with most of the SCW's agenda already enacted in the Charter, Mrs Lee,
as a President, found it difficult to hold the committee together, being
more interested by then in the more prayerful and meditative aspects of
the Baha'i Faith rather than in its social-reform agenda. In the sixties,
much of her time was taken up with volunteer duties in the local
spiritual assemblies of the Baha'is of Singapore. She was also elected as
a member of the National Spiritual Assembly of Malaysia (1965-1966),
a position that required much travelling time between Singapore and
various parts of Malaysia. In addition, Baha'i or Christian women were
not forthcoming in the reorganisation of the SCW or in taking over its
leadership. Mrs EV Davis became more involved in social work with the
YWCA. The building of the first women's hostel in Fort Canning Road

The Bahá Y Faith and the Singapore Women's Movement                      13

in 1969 is chiefly attributed to her efforts. Mrs Constance Goh focussed
on family planning and Christian mission work. Due to her work in this
area, she was made a patron of the International Planned Parenthood
Federation in 1977, an honour accorded to only a few. Mrs Elizabeth
Choy concentrated her energies on managing the School for the Visually
Impaired. Mrs Robert Eu left Singapore to begin a new life in Malaysia.
Membership declined and the Council was eventually de-registered in
1971 due to disinterest.

The leadership of the women's movement passed from non-political
women to political women with the departure of the colonial power and
the election of the first nationalist government in 1959. Bahá'is gave up
the initiative to be in the forefront of political change during the early
years of Singapore's independence because of the Baha'i principle of
non-involvement in party politics. Media attention was now on the new
political women - eight of whom contested in the 1959 elections and
another ten in'the 1963 elections.16 The 1959 election saw five women
voted into the Singapore Legislative Assembly. Of these new women,
the most outstanding was Chan Choy Siong, a member of the PAP who
would remain as a Member of Parliament until 1970 and who had
mooted the notion of anti-polygamy in 1956 immediately after the rally
at which Mrs Fozdar spoke. Another early SCW member, Mrs Seow
Peck Leng, who learnt much about advocacy work from Mrs Fozdar in
the early fifties, became the first woman opposition member from 1959
to 1961 in Singapore's first Legislative Assembly.

Since most of the demands advocated by the SCW were met in the
Charter of 1961, women associations reverted to their focus on social,
charitable and community activities. This was a surprising phenomenon
in view of the fact that this period saw the rise of many consciousness-
raising groups in the West. The publication of Betty Friedan's book, The
Feminine Mystique in the early sixties, for example, became a catalyst
for many women by naming the sources of frustration they had
experienced, and served as a focal point around which they could gather.

\[16\] Most of the active women however were in the opposition parties which boycotted
both the 1965 and 1968 elections leaving only Madam Chan Choy Siong of the PAP to
be the spokeswomen for Singapore women. When Madam Chan resigned from politics in
1970, there were no women in politics until the 1984 elections.

14            THE SINGAPORE BAHA'f STUDIES REVIEW

In contrast, the sixties and seventies were relatively quiet years for
women advocacy groups in Singapore. Attention seemed to have shifted
to the pressing need for economic survival for the new nation state rather
than women rights.

Groups such as the Chinese Women's Association, the YWCA, the
Kamala Club, the Asian Women's Welfare Association and the Inner
Wheel were occasionally highlighted by the media for their social,
charitable and educational activities. It was also a time for the inception
of local chapters of international organisations such as Soroptimist
International, Quota Club and the Zonta Club. Professional networking
groups slowly formed during this period e.g. the Singapore Association
of Women's Lawyers and the Singapore Business and Professional
Women's Association. There were also religiously-inspired women
groups such as the Young Muslim Women's Association, the General
Conference Women's Society of Christian Service and the Baha'i
Women's Committee but these organisations did not seek the public
stage on women's rights.17 On the contrary, it was the national
grassroots organisation under the Ministry of Community Development
which made the greatest impact. In 1960, the People's Association (PA)
was formed as a major community development agency. Its women's
committees in each of the electoral constituencies were active in
organising a wide range of cultural, educational, sports and recreational
activities. Control at the grassroots level passed from the hands of
independent civil groups to that of the government.

The Singapore Women's Movement: the Second Wave

Lam and Chew (1993) recount a second awakening in the eighties. By
then, a younger group of Baha'i women were ready to be involved in the
second awakening. When a National Council of Women (NCW) was
inaugurated in 1975 as a broad-based umbrella body, Baha'i women
were a part of the executive committee. However, the NCW functioned
for only two years - until 1977 when the Social Affairs Ministry
informed them that it was not a national organisation but a private one -

help the needy.

since it had only 7 affiliates, which did not include the PA and the
National Trades Union Congress (NTUC), two groups with the largest
number of female members in Singapore.

In 1980 when yet another attempt was made to form a broad-based
Council, this time the Singapore Council of Women's Organisations
(SCWO), Baha'i women e.g. Mrs Anula Samuel and Mrs Shirin Fozdar
(having returned from Thailand after 18 years) rallied once again to its

inaugural meeting. The Baha'i Women's Committee (BWC), a
committee formed in 1972 under the auspices of the Spiritual Assembly
of the Bahá'is of Singapore, became one of the first fifteen women's
associations to seek affiliation to the SCWO.19 Its members took an
active part in the SCWO's many sub-committees. In 1986, Lena Tan, a
Baha'i, became a member of the executive board of the SCWO (1986-
1990).20 Other Baha'i women who succeeded her on the board included
Christine Lee, Lalitha Nambiar and Anula Samuel. In their respective
stints on the SCWO executive board, Baha'i women served mostly as
Treasurer and/or secretary and were also active in committees such as
publication and research.21 Perhaps the most notable achievements of
Baha'i women where the SCWO was concerned was their involvement
in the fundraising for the SCWO building during the tenure of Christine
Lee, (Treasurer of the SCWO from 1992-1994), a period in which a
Finance committee was first instituted to raise funds for a "Women's
Centre".22 When the new building was opened in 1998, the Baha'i
Office for the Advancement of Women (BOAW) (earlier known as the
Baha'i Women's Committee) was among the first to establish its office
there. It is now the focal congregational point for Baha'i women in their
attempts to organise service projects for the public.

Although Baha'i women are no longer in the frontline of leadership,
their participation in the women's movement has remained strong. They
were actively involved in the Fourth UN World Conference for Women
in Beijing in 1995. Eleven Baha'is went as part of the forty-eight strong
SCWO contingent and the two workshops contributed by the SCWO
during this conference were organised by the BWC.23 In 1993, the BWC
teamed up with the SCWO to publish the book Voices and Choices - the
Women's Movement in Singapore, a landmark book which traced the
history of the women's movement in Singapore and which was launched
by the then President of Singapore, Mr Wee Kim Wee.

It was during this period that the BWC/BOAW began to focus not so
much on advocacy work but also on activities such as family life
relationships, education of girls, peace education, environmental
protection and the promotion of women's health. In 1990, Baha'i women
organised a week-long exhibition The Arts for Nature which was one of
the first attempts to raise public awareness, on the need to conserve our
environment in Singapore. The works of more than 60 local artists were
selected and their paintings, sculptures and installation pieces were
displayed at the Empress Place Museum and the proceeds from the sale
of the paintings donated to the Save the Turtles Campaign of the
Malayan Nature Society. In 1992, a Baha'i, Mrs Tia Traazil became the
first woman to win the Ministry of Environment's Green Leaf Award in
the individual category for outstanding contributions to environmental
protection and preservation.

The BOAW has also worked closely with government ministries. In
1995-6, Dr H. B. Danesh, an internationally renowned psychiatrist was
invited by the BOAW to conduct a series of public workshops on
marriage, family life and personal development. During his visits, he
met with several governmental and non-governmental organisations,
medical and educational institutions working in the areas of family
violence and juvenile delinquency as well as with Mr Abdullah
Tarmugi, the Minister for Community Development. Another health
project and one which was endorsed by the Ministry of Health was the
one that took place in 1997-8 when the BOAW and SCWO jointly

\[23\] These two workshops were on "Women, Work and Family" and "Young Women and
a Violence-free Society".

organised a series of talks by medical doctors on various aspects of
women's health.

Keen to cooperate with other civic groups, the BOAW has co-organised
activities with the University Women's Association of Singapore,
Association of Women for Action and Research (AWARE), the
Malayan Nature Society, the Society Against Family Violence and the
National University of Singapore Society in its efforts to promote
consciousness on women rights and the environment.

The second wave of women in the Singapore women's movement were
quite different to those of the first wave. By comparison with its
predecessor, the SCW, the SCWO has had a moderate agenda. The
colonial authorities had left the scene and women's advocacy groups no
longer spoke at street rallies or played to an eager media. Instead, groups
such as SCWO (and subsequently, AWARE and SAWL) preferred the
medium of letter-writing e.g. to the Forum page of the local press and
the writing of reports to government and national bodies as a means of
getting heard. There was not so much of the rousing passionate speeches
and the extensive media coverage which occurred in the fifties. The
socio-political scene was much more subdued than it had been in the
years before independence. For example, a major event in 1984
organised by the SCWO and the Singapore Women's Association
(SWA)24 to commemorate the United Nations 1975-1985 "the women's
decade" was basically an educational rather than an advocacy event. It
was a presentation of the facts, problems, and statistics on women's
jobs, home and families, children education and health rather than an
explicit clarion call for popular support on women's rights.

Dissatisfied with what was perceived as the moderate agenda of the
SCWO, and concerned with the discrimination of women in the home
and workplace, another women's organisation, the Association of
Women for Action and Research (AWARE), was formed in 1985. Its
immediate aim was to lobby and draw public attention to problems such
as violence against women and children. This group also received
support from Baha'i women who worked mainly in its sub-committees..

\[24\] Mrs Seow Peck Leng, an early member of the SCW, was the founder-president of the
Singapore Women's Association.

Since then, AWARE has highlighted controversial issues such as the
phenomenon of unequal pay for equal work in many jobs, the unequal
burden of childcare (with many women having to resort to staying at
home to care for children in their infancy), inequalities in employment
(unequal medical benefits), the prevalence of sexual harassment and
abuse, and last but not least, negative media portrayal which imposes on
women disadvantages and handicaps not faced by men. Not surprisingly,
AWARE has been the women's organisation that has received the most
press coverage in recent years.25

It should also be noted that the second wave of women in the SCWO and
AWARE were eager to promote themselves as secular organisations,
careful not to focus on the powerful influence of religious ideology on
gender issues. This is not surprising since the PAP government, from its
inception in 1959, has handled matters of a religious nature with extreme
care and has made it clear that any hint of religious prejudice that may
lead to feelings of ill will and hostility between different religions would
not be tolerated. To highlight this point, a Maintenance of Religious
Harmony Act was passed in 1990 to provide for the maintenance of
religious harmony in Singapore and to ensure that religion was not
exploited for political or subversive purposes. Since then, civic groups
have been extremely careful in keeping clear of religious issues.

Indeed, of the 41 affiliates of the Singapore Council of Women,
religiously-inspired ones like the BOAW, Young Women's Christian
Association, Young Women's Muslim Association, and the General
Conference Women's Society have not succeeded in assuming
leadership. While individual leaders of the SCWO and AWARE may
have their particular religious affiliations, they are always careful to
keep them in the private domain. This is a noticeable departure from
SCW leaders such as Mrs Shirin Fozdar, Mrs George Lee, Mrs EV
Davis and Mrs Constance Goh who were often keen to connect their
civic commitments to their strong religious convictions. In media
interviews, Mrs Fozdar, in particular, often referred to the Baha'i
teachings as the source of her inspiration.

Two past AWARE presidents, Ms Claire Chiang and Dr Kanwaljit Soin have been
elected Nominated Members of Parliament and two past presidents, Ms Claire Chiang
and Ms Hedwig Anuar have also been nominated "Woman of the Year" in Singapore.

The Bahá 'í Faith and the Singapore Women's Movement                    19

I found, however, three occasions where issues of religion continued to
play a part in the women's movement, all three of them related to
AWARE. One was in 1996, when as immediate past President of
AWARE, Constance Singam, a Catholic, in a speech on the occasion of
the official launching of Veritas, the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of
Singapore's Home page on the internet in 1996, called for the church to
admit women to leadership positions in institutions of the church. She
argued for the socialisation of men and women as equals in Catholic
educational institutions. She urged the Church to introduce gender
studies in Catechism classes, in Catholic schools and in the Seminary.
Finally, she urged the Church to appoint girls for service during Mass,
women as Communion ministers or have women as chairpersons of
Parish Councils.

The other two occasions occurred during the AWARE presidency of Dr
Phyllis Chew, a Baha'i. As AWARE President, Dr Chew highlighted to
the Singapore public the mass rape of Chinese women by the Indonesian
military during the May riots of 1998. AWARE launched a public
exhibition on mass rape and collected 45,000 signatures for a petition to
the Indonesian President and the UN Commissioner of Human Rights,
an event which was given extensive media coverage both in Singapore
and Indonesia.26 It carefully downplayed the religious and racial
character of the rape by highlighting it from the women's angle. The
other occasion took place in December 1998 when AWARE became the
sponsoring body for the play "Talaq" which focussed on oppressed
women divorcees in the Tamil Muslim community. The play explored
the true-life experiences of such women in Singapore and highlighted
social issues such as oppression, marital rape and the culture of silence
forced upon these women. This play raised opposition from the
conservative Tamil Indian Jamath group who filed their complaint to the
Majlis Ugama Islam Singapura (MUIS) and the Ministry of Community
Development on the grounds that it brought disgrace to Islamic
principles and values.27

It can be concluded that while the Baha'i contribution remained strong
in the "second awakening", they had by and large, lost the leadership of
the movement. Nevertheless, they remain highly visible in many
women's groups in Singapore and enjoy a good reputation as co-
operators and workers.

Reasons for Baha'i involvement
Many reasons can be found to explain involvement of Baha'i women in
the women's movement in Singapore and other parts of the world.
Firstly, there is the Baha'i principle that women's education is of greater
importance than men's education and there is the Baha'i view that not
until the equality of opportunity in education for the two sexes is
achieved, will the foundations of war be removed. Indeed, 'AbduT-
Bahá, the interpreter of the Baha'i writings, was even Aware of
linguistic biases and style. In the promotion of a Universal Language for
world-wide communication, he said "... no one person can construct a
Universal Language. It must be made by a Council representing all
countries, and must contain words from different languages. It will be
governed by the simplest rules, and there will be no exceptions; neither
will there be gender, nor extra and silent letters. Everything indicated
will have but one name"2*(my italics).

Second, the Singapore BOAW is also advantaged in the periodic
guidance it receives from the world Baha'i Office for the Advancement
of Women, a committee of the Baha'i International Community in New
York which enjoys consultative status with the United Nations
Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC). It is a world body that has
worked directly with the United Nations Commission on the Status of
Women and its Secretariat, the UN Division for the Advancement of
Women. It has also established a close and co-operative relationship
with other international non-governmental organisations, which are
seeking, through their activities, to promote the advancement of

women.

Thirdly, Baha'i women are also encouraged to assume leadership
positions in the Baha'i administrative system. A survey of the
participation of women in Baha'i community life found that the
percentage of women in leadership positions in the Baha'i Faith
compared favourably with the percentage of women in positions of
political leadership world-wide.30 Women compose an average of 30%
of the elected membership of national-level Baha'i governing councils
and some 47% of the membership in special Baha'i appointment
positions for the sub-national and regional level. According to the Inter-
Parliamentary Union, the average percentage of women members in the
world parliaments is about 10%.31

This is an interesting contrast to religious leadership in other religions.
While mainstream churches e.g. Anglican, Methodist, Lutheran and
Presbyterian do allow the ordination of female pastors, they are by
tradition male-oriented in terms of leadership, ritual and preaching
role.32 In a book published on the occasion of the 40 years anniversary of
the IRO, (1949-1989), Rev Anne Johnson, a Presbyterian minister, was
listed as the only woman in the Council of the IRO. She is of the opinion
that the lack of women leaders in religion is not because of a dearth of
capable women but that the men have kept them out.33 Similarly, while
there are many nuns in Mahayana Buddhism, they are still not equal to
monks. For example, Mahayana nuns do not teach in temples or take
disciples here as the monks do. While monks officiate at funerals, to
transfer merit to the deceased, nuns chant to lessen the bad karma and
pollution of the deceased. In the Hindu tradition, the Dharmasutras
defines a woman as one who is dependent on her father during her
childhood, on her husband during her youth and on her son during her
old age (Manu IX.3). Similarly, in Islam, men's work is usually regarded
as more valuable than women's work, no matter how arbitrary the
division of labour. As a consequence of this standard of determination, a

hierarchy evolved in which women have been considered less significant
than men in many social-religious systems (Wadud-Muhsin 1995).

Last but not least, Baha'is have an unusual role model in the figure of
Tahirih, the most well known woman in Babi-Baha'i history. Tahirih
presents a startling contrast to the former religious female models. This
gifted poet of the 19th century, far from being a dutiful daughter,
continually opposed the theological views of her father, a prominent
Muslim cleric. She is not admired for her success as daughter or wife,
since her estrangement from her husband (also a cleric) also resulted in
forced separation from her children. It is not surprising that to the more
conservative religious clergy, she is a paradigm of the dangers of
allowing woman too much freedom. Tahirih can be contrasted to the role
model of Sita, Mary and Fatimah. In Hinduism, Sita is a wife who
remains faithful to her husband at all costs. In Christianity, the Virgin
Mary is a symbol of motherhood who, through devotion to her son,
remained discreetly aloof from his ministry. Then there is Fatimah,
daughter of Muhammad, who figures as role model of mother, wife and
daughter.

To be objective, it must be noted that the Baha'i Faith has the advantage
of being a relatively young religion. It has been observed that if it is
religion that downgrades women it is usually not the early version.
Women were active in early religious movements, as can be seen in
early Christian and Buddhist histories. However, the loss of momentum
in women's religious activities after their initial success and their painful
absence from epoch-making events attest to arbitrary restrictions
introduced to curtail their work when past religions emerged from
obscurity. What could be the reasons? Jealousy, insecurity, complacency
by men? Disinterest and apathy on the part of women? There is evidence
to support all these speculations. Abraham (1995) recounts that male
theologians and religious leaders, whether they be Muslims, Hindus and
Christians, have taken religious texts taken out of context to relegate
women to subordinate roles in home, church and society.

Sharma (1987) also notes that the less differentiated religion and society
are the greater is the participation of women. The more institutionalised
a religion becomes, the more it excludes women from positions of
authority and power. One observes that women hold higher positions in

The Bahá 'í Faith and the Singapore Women's Movement                         23

archaic, ancient, tribal, and relatively non-institutionalised forms of
religions e.g. shamanism, possession, rites, spiritualism or non-
hierarchical groups like the Quakers, than in highly differentiated
religious traditions with their complex structures. In both primitive and
ancient religions, we find the widespread presence of women magicians,
shamans, healers, visionaries and seers, prophetesses and priestesses.
Women oracles of ancient Greece are well known. Female temple
priestesses exist in Egypt, Sumeria, Babylon, Greece and Japan. As the
Baha'i Faith is a less differentiated religion viz. the other world
religions, (e.g. there is an absence of clergy in the Baha'i Faith), it is not
surprising that women are able to play a more prominent role.

Challenges for the next Millennium

The Baha'i Faith is linked intimately with the inception of the women's
movement in Singapore; just as it is linked with the emergence of a
wider woman's consciousness in the world. Tahirih, for instance, is one
of the firsts, if not the first, woman in the Muslim world to remove her
veil in public, her intention being to signal the dawning of a new
religious dispensation. In Singapore, the public became familiar with the
word "Baha'i" through media coverage on Mrs Fozdar and the anti-
polygamy issue. For many people in Singapore in the 1950's, "Fozdar"
was a household word due to the extensive media coverage, which she
was able to generate with regards to women rights. Mrs Fozdar's
contribution to the social history of Singapore cannot be doubted. She
was the first woman singled out for a tribute by the SCWO inl988.
AWARE has also initiated a trust fund to honour her memory - the
Shirin Fozdar Trust Fund - in 1992. Due to the work of the SCW, the
first umbrella body of women's associations to fight for equal status,
Singapore was ahead of UN organisations and similar organisations in
neighbouring countries such as Indonesia and Malaysia.34 Of course, it

\[34\] The United Nations passed a convention concerning consent to marriage, minimum
age for marriage and registration of marriage only in 1962, one year after the Singapore
Women's Charter. Non-Muslims in Malaysia acquired rights similar to the Women's
Charter of Singapore only after the Marriage and Divorce Act of 1976 was finally
implemented in March 1982. In Indonesia, it was only in 1974 that the status of women
in marriage was safeguarded by a Marriage Act, which recognised the principle of

24           THE SINGAPORE BAHÁ'Í STUDIES REVIEW

must not be forgotten that there were other women who rallied around
her -- most of whom were reform-minded and socially motivated
Christians. Christian women, however, were uncomfortable with the
forthright stand which Baha'is took on the issue of the equality of status
between men and women and preferred a lower profile.

With the first flush of independence in 1959 and the enactment of the
Women's Charter in 1961, the women's movement in Singapore began
to lose its momentum. In the place of the civic groups of the 1950's was
the emergence of women in politics and they began to spearhead policies
pertaining to women. Gradually, more women groups were formed -
professional, international, and charitable - but the issues of interest
were now not so much on women's rights but on adapting to a newly
independent republic keen to get ahead with economic progress.
Meanwhile, the social, recreational and educational needs of the masses
were gradually taken over by the vast network of Peoples'Associations
(PA) all over the island. While Baha'i women remained active
throughout the first and second wave of the women's movement, they
had, by and large, lost the leadership of the women's movement with the
departure of Shirin Fozdar. Due to the changed socio-political climate,
the younger group of Baha'i women in the second wave were not so
focussed on the promotion of human rights per se as their health,
environmental and educational activities.

As the chief influence on culture, social norms and values, religion must
always feature either directly or indirectly in the women's movement. In
the first wave, women leaders in civic groups had the courage to face the
wrath of the conservative religious leaders of the community, as can be
seen in the resistance between the SCW and the Tamil, Muslim, and
Chinese Advisory Boards. In the second wave, women were careful to
detach themselves from matters relating to religion owing to the changed
socio-political climate in Singapore. While Baha'i women attempted to
influence Muslim reforms in the past, it would be inappropriate to do so
today due to the rise of Muslim fundamentalism and also due to the
existence of Muslim women's groups who could themselves take the
lead in their own affairs. Neither is it appropriate for Singaporean

monogamy in marriage and allowed polygamy only with prior approval from the first
wife and a court of law.

groups to extend their work across the Causeway, since Malaysia is now
an independent country.35

What then for the next millennium? For the Singapore Bahá'is, they
will have the task of keeping pace with a movement which they have
been associated with from its inception. They will have to train more
leaders among themselves to play key roles in the movement and they
will have to continue to educate the masses on the importance of human
rights and women's rights in their attempts to create a united world.

There is also an urgency to link the women's movement more closely
with the peace movement. The goals of peace have been a central theme
in all religions, although traditionally, religion has focussed more on
inner than outer social and political peace. Peace is an urgent survival
issue for the contemporary world, an issue of extraordinary magnitude
ever since Hiroshima. It is time for religious leaders to argue
persuasively against, the justification of violence and war. For the
Bahá'is, the achievement of full equality between the sexes is one of the
most important though least acknowledged prerequisite of peace. If
conflict among nations is closely related to conflict in the country and
the family, it is the special responsibility of non-governmental
organisations such as the BOAW to eradicate the underlying sources of
conflict - be it poverty, human rights violations or misunderstandings.
Such sources are often the real causes leading to human unhappiness and
dissatisfaction with one another, eventually contributing to violence as a
means of remedying the source of the perceived injustice. The challenge
then for the Baha'i community both in Singapore and the world is to
educate the public on the inter-relationship between equality of the sexes
and world peace. They have to convince the public that only when
women enter into all fields of human endeavour, then and only then can
the moral and psychological climate be created for international peace to
emerge.

\[35\] In Malaysia, there is the presence of AW AM (All Women Action Society), a member
of the Muslim Women's Action Group (better known from Sept 1990 as "Sisters in
Islam", the name under which the group entered public debate, especially through letters
to the editors of the Malay and English language press). Whether this movement will
eventually influence their Muslim sisters in Singapore remains to be seen.

26              THE SINGAPORE BAHÁT STUDIES REVIEW

It should also be noted that although the Baha'i Faith has been in
Singapore for half a century, its membership size has remained relatively
small. The Baha'i register records a total of about 2,000 believers. It is
an irony that while it is the religion which appears to be the most
conducive where women's rights are concerned, it has not succeeded in
attracting the majority of the more progressive or feminist-inclined
sector of the population. This is striking when one realises that in
Singapore and Southeast Asia, religion is not only holding its own but
also gaining in strength. The Dakwan movement in Malaysian Islam, the
Christian charismatic movement of Southeast Asia, the emergence of
neo-Hindu groups like Sai Baba, the proliferation of Chinese mediums,
the Japanese Nichiren Shoshu School of Buddhism are conspicuous
examples. It will be interesting to see how the Baha'i Faith will meet the
challenge from such groups in the coming years.

Looking at religion in general today, it is obvious that religions are at a
turning point where gender issues are concerned. The feminine critique
of specific religious ideas and practices is becoming sharper, more
articulate and detailed day by day. Today, institutional religion is facing
a crisis due to a worn-out paradigm between the sexes. A new
perspective is needed to help women develop their full potential, which
has laid dormant for most of recorded history. In order to establish this
reality, there is a need to eliminate worn out doctrines and shibboleths
that have emerged from earlier socio-religious conditions and which
have denied women's full equality by claiming she was created unequal
by God.

The challenge of traditional theological thinking has already begun. In
the West, the Movement for the Ordination of Women has gained
considerable support especially in larger Christian churches such as the
Anglican, Roman Catholic and Orthodox. In the last 20 years, the
number of women theology students have risen exponentially. In many
theology courses in the West, more than half are women.36 (King 1993).
In Singapore, in the early 1990's there was a conference on feminist
mariology whereby a statement was issued by the attendees "to liberate
ourselves from the destructive effects of 2000 years of male
interpretation of Mary" and "to return to the Scriptures as women within

\[36\] King, Ursula. Feminist Theology from the Third World, p. 2-20

our own cultural contexts, to rediscover the Mary who is liberated and
the liberator.''37

While most of the challenges so far have been addressed to the
patriarchal heritage of the Judeo-Christian tradition, increasing evidence
exists that critical feminist consciousness is growing everywhere among
the religions of the world, not just Jewish and Christian, but also within
Hinduism, Buddhism and Islam. Buddhist nuns in the Theravada
tradition strongly request the right to full ordination in Sri Lanka and
Thailand. In the Mahayana tradition, women have asked for full
recognition as Zen masters. Hindu women have established the right to
recite the Vedas and follow the path of renunciation (sannyasa)
traditionally closed to them. Some also campaign to be gurus in their
own right.38

There is a growing awareness that religion is indispensable to social
order and has a direct effect on laws and morality. The challenges of the
next millennium must include the challenge to explore in greater depth
the achievements of women and the potential transformative power of
their contributions in religion. More important is the issue of educating
the next and future generations on inequality. How are we to ensure that
succeeding generations will not perpetuate the stereotypical ways of
thinking and being that they have been used to? Society today needs a
global ethic, a universal standard of values, ideals and goals - a need
reflected in the "declaration toward a global ethic" of the recent World
parliament of religions in Chicago (1993) which outlined a "minimal
ethic" based on common values of the great world religions. One ethical
point common to all religions is to treat each other as one would oneself
like to be treated. Certainly, if the treatment of women were scrutinised
in the light of this universal ethical standard, the world would progress
beyond traditional, cultural and religious practices. In Singapore,
perhaps the IRO as the officially recognised body representing the multi-
faiths of the republic, can lead the way where this principle is
concerned.

28          THE SINGAPORE BAHAT STUDIES REVIEW

In the light of fast-changing social-political circumstances, the enduring
values of religion also need, from time to time, to be re-examined.
Questions and problems never encountered before need to be posed. The
challenge of the equality of the sexes confronts most of the world's
religions in an unsettling and perturbing way. The BaháT Faith can only
be commended for pointing and leading the way for its resolution, a
process truly unique in religious history, both in Singapore and
elsewhere.
