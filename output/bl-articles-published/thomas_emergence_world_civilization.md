I n t r od uc t i on

The purpose of this paper is to extract the essence of Shoghi
Effendi’s ideas presented in that chapter of his seminal work —
The World Order of Bahá’u’lláh — entitled “The Unfoldment of
World Civilization.” The book deals with the far and
immediate future of global civilization that is particularly
pertinent for the twenty first century and it is the last chapter
that is so rich in possibilities. If ever a literary work were to be
identified as a monument to its author this one would
certainly suffice for the Beloved Guardian of the Bahá’í Faith,
Shoghi Effendi.

In setting the stage for the study of a future Bahá’í
civilization, the Guardian first drew out the contrast in the
rise of the Administrative Order of the Faith of God and the
disintegration of society as evidenced during the Great
Depression of the 1930s. But it was not the Depression alone
nor the events leading up to it before the crash of 1929 that
caused the disintegration noted by Shoghi Effendi. They were
rather symptomatic of much deeper cumulative breakdowns of
social institutions harking back to the first warnings by
Bahá’u’lláh in the previous century. The Guardian pointed out
the mysterious manner in which the signs were heralding the
birth of that World Order that would signalize the Golden Age
of the Cause of God. He added that all fair-minded observers
could not fail to discern them nor should one be misled by the
slowness of the unfoldment of the civilization that the
followers of Bahá’u’lláh were laboring to establish. And one

364                                 Emergence of World Civilization

should not be deluded by the apparent well being resulting
exclusively in material gain. He then referred to a well known
quote by Bahá’u’lláh: “Soon, will the present day Order be rolled
up, and a new one spread out in its stead… The world’s
equilibrium hath been upset through the vibrating influence of
this Most Great, this new World Order. ” [WOB 161-162]

One of the fundamental principles of The New World Order
espoused by Bahá’u’lláh involves the unification of the entire
human race. He was quoted in reference to the Lesser Peace
(political peace) with warnings to the rulers of the world after
they refused “The Most Great Peace” as embodied in the
famous letters to the kings and religious leaders of the world:

> Be reconciled among yourselves, that ye may need no
> more armaments save in a measure to safeguard your
> territories and dominions… Be united, O kings of the
> earth, for thereby will the tempest of discord be stilled
> amongst you, and your peoples find rest, if ye be of
> them that comprehend. Should any one among you take
> up arms against another, rise ye all against him, for
> this is naught but manifest justice. [GWB 253]
The Most Great Peace based on the divinely appointed
ordinances that are implicit in the World Order that stands
associated with the Holy Name of Bahá’u’lláh was brought into
focus. The Guardian asserted “the spiritualization of the world
and the fusion of all its races, creeds, classes and nations — can
rest on no other basis, and can be preserved through no other
agency…” [WOB 162] And from Bahá’u’lláh: “It beseemeth all men
in this Day to take firm hold on the Most Great Name, and to
establish the unity of all mankind. There is no place to flee to,
no refuge that any one can seek, except Him. ” [GWB 202]
Hu m a ni t y’s C omi n g of A ge

Shoghi Effendi inferred that the advent of the Revelation of
Bahá’u’lláh should be regarded as signalizing the coming of age
of the human race. That its mission is the “organic and
spiritual unity of the whole body of nations.” That it should
not be viewed as just another spiritual revival, or only a further
stage in progressive Revelation. It should be viewed as

Lights of ‘Irfán Book Eight                                   365

“marking the last and highest stage in the stupendous evolution
of man’s collective life on this planet.” He took this startling
concept a step further:

> The emergence of a world community, the
> consciousness of world citizenship, the founding of a
> world civilization and culture — all of which must
> synchronize with the initial stages in the unfoldment of
> the Golden Age of the Bahá’í Era — should, by their very
> nature, be regarded, as far as this planetary life is
> concerned, as the furthermost limits in the
> organization of human society, though man, as an
> individual, will, nay must indeed as a result of such a
> consummation, continue indefinitely to progress and
> develop. [WOB 162]
The Guardian then compared “That mystic, all-pervasive, yet
indefinable change, which we associate with the stage of
maturity inevitable in the life of the individual…” to a similar
stage that “must sooner or later be attained in the collective life
of mankind, producing an even more striking phenomenon in
world relations, and endowing the whole human race with such
potentialities of well-being as shall provide, throughout the
succeeding ages, the chief incentive required for the eventual
fulfillment of its high destiny.” [WOB 164]
T he P r oc es s of I n t egr at i on

This period in which we live was “likened to the culminating
stage in the political evolution of the great American Republic
the stage which marked the emergence of a unified community
of federated states….” Reference was made to the stirring of a
new national consciousness coupled with the birth of an
infinitely richer civilization than its component parts could
separately achieve. This may be viewed as the coming of age of the
American people. Similarly, the stage at which mankind has now
arrived is ripe for the Revelation of Bahá’u’lláh which “has been
endowed with such potentialities as are commensurate with the
maturity of the human race — the crowning and most momen-
tous stage in its evolution from infancy to manhood.” [WOB 166]

It was explained that the founders of past Religions have
shed the splendors of one common Revelation at various stages

366                                  Emergence of World Civilization

that marked the advance of mankind toward maturity. As
such, they may be regarded as preliminary Manifestations
paving the way for that Day when the whole world will have
born its destined fruit. However, the underlying expressions of
Bahá’u’lláh that established absolute oneness of all the Prophets
should never be obscured. The Guardian further stated:

> Any variations in the splendor which each of these
> Manifestations of the Light of God has shed upon the
> world should be ascribed not to any inherent
> superiority involved in the essential character of any
> one of them, but rather to the progressive capacity, the
> ever-increasing spiritual receptiveness, which mankind,
> in its progress towards maturity, has invariably
> manifested. [WOB 166]
T he Fi n a l C on s u m ma ti on

The progression of mankind current in this day was
characterized, as a “stupendous evolution in the collective life
of the whole human race” and that those who associate this
with the Revelation of Bahá’u’lláh are the only ones who can
grasp the significance of His words.

> This Day, however, is unique, and is to be
> distinguished from those that have preceded it. The
> designation ‘Seal of the Prophets’ fully revealeth its high
> station. The Prophetic Cycle hath verily ended. The
> Eternal Truth is now come. He hath lifted up the ensign
> of power, and is now shedding upon the world the
> unclouded splendor of His Revelation. In this most
> mighty Revelation, all the Dispensations of the past
> have attained their highest, their final consummation.
> That which hath been made manifest in this
> preeminent, this most exalted Revelation, standeth
> unparalleled in the annals of the past, nor will future
> ages witness its like. [WOB 167]
The following confirmative words reiterated by ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s
pronouncement were quoted: “Centuries, ” He affirms in one of
His Tablets, “nay, countless ages, must pass away ere the Day-

Lights of ‘Irfán Book Eight                                   367

Star of Truth shineth again in its mid-summer splendor, or ap-
peareth once more in the radiance of its vernal glory…. ” [WOB 167]
P a n gs of Dea t h a n d Bi rt h

Up to this point the Guardian has set the stage for a deeper
understanding of what bodes for the future in the life of
humankind. Beginning fifteen short years after the passing of
his beloved grandfather ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, Shoghi Effendi brought
to bear, the culmination of spiritually disintegrating
conditions of the world in the nineteen thirties. Concurrently
he reflected upon the startling fulfillment of prophetic
utterances of Bahá’u’lláh and His son ‘Abdu’l-Bahá with
expectations of much more to follow especially regarding the
Administrative Order of Bahá’u’lláh and the Golden Age of the
Most Great Peace. He explained that the World Order that the
Revelation of Bahá’u’lláh fosters was yet to be born, that the
creative energies released by the Heroic Age of the Faith were
not yet crystallized into a world society that would mirror
forth the brightness of His glory. Although the framework of
His Administrative Order was erected, and the Formative Age
had begun, the promised Kingdom remained “uninaugurated.”

Reference was made to “the generation of the half-light”
destined to endure the dark forces that would spawn a flood of
agonizing afflictions before the dawn of the Golden Age of the
Faith. The ensuing seven decades since the writing of these
letters have certainly confirmed those dire warnings, and there
is yet more to come before this travailing age “can yield its
fairest fruit.” He referred to that time as an incubation period
for the World Commonwealth envisioned by Bahá’u’lláh. He
further said “We stand on the threshold of an age whose
convulsions proclaim alike the death-pangs of the old order and
the birth-pangs of the new.” [WOB 169]
U n i ver s a l Fer m en t a ti on

The Guardian summarized the reality of a process that the
bulk of mankind was apparently not fully aware that he called
Universal Fermentation. This was defined as a worldwide
phenomenon that continues to this day involving religious,
social, economic and political evidences in anticipation of the

368                                 Emergence of World Civilization

Day when unity of the human race will be established. He
further asserted that we were in a twofold process, each of
which would “bring to a climax the forces that were
transforming the face of our planet. The first was and is
essentially an integrating process, while the second was and is
fundamentally disruptive.” One is an unfolding System that
will serve as a pattern for a future world polity toward which a
disordered world is advancing. The other is a disintegrating
influence that tends to tear down the antiquated barriers that
seek to block humanity’s progress towards its destined goal.

> A titanic, a spiritual struggle, unparalleled in its
> magnitude yet unspeakably glorious in its ultimate
> consequences, is being waged as a result of these
> opposing tendencies, in this age of transition through
> which the organized community of the followers of
> Bahá’u’lláh and mankind as a whole are passing. [WOB 170]
The Guardian explained that the constructive process was
associated with the nascent Faith of Bahá’u’lláh, that it was the
harbinger of a New World Order whereas the destructive forces
were characterized by a civilization that was falling into chaos
and decline.
T hi s A ge of T r a n si t ion

Our focus was then drawn to the outstanding events that
were transpiring in that formative period referred to as “this
Age of Transition” and the tendencies that characterized it. Its
tribulations were the precursors of “that Era of blissful
felicity” which would “incarnate God’s ultimate purpose for all
mankind.” It was inferred that ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s passing in 1921
ushered in its opening phase.

Shoghi Effendi identified two momentous events that just
preceded this opening phase in which we are still living. They
were precipitated by World War I with the fall of the German
Empire and the extinction of the Austro-Hungarian
Monarchy. The war “signalized the opening of the Age of
Frustration destined to precede the establishment of the World
Order of Bahá’u’lláh.” At the time of this writing over seventy
years ago, the Guardian referred to these events as being “the

Lights of ‘Irfán Book Eight                                   369

earliest occurrences of that turbulent Age, into the outer
fringes of whose darkest phase we are now beginning to enter.”
[WOB 170] The twentieth century has certainly confirmed the
truth of these remarks.

Germany had previously conquered Napoleon III and reveled
in glory that would be short lived even after the warnings by
Bahá’u’lláh: “O King of Berlin!… Take heed lest pride debar thee
from recognizing the Day-Spring of Divine Revelation, lest
earthly desires shut thee out, as by a veil, from the Lord of the
Throne above and of the earth below. Thus counseleth thee the
Pen of the Most High…. ” [KA 51] And again: “O banks of the
Rhine! We have seen you covered with gore, inasmuch as the
swords of retribution were drawn against you; and so you shall
have another turn. And We hear the lamentations of Berlin,
though she be today in conspicuous glory. ” [KA 53]

Germany was utterly vanquished only to rise again and
plunge Europe into that darkest phase of a turbulent age
spoken of by Shoghi Effendi, a phase of unparalleled horror
that reached its zenith in World War II.
C olla ps e of I s lám

Within the context of sweeping changes in the politico-
religious life of man in the early twentieth century there was a
central theme of profound import regarding the long standing
world of Islam and its collapse. The Guardian first pointed out
how the power of the Shí’ih hierarchy crumbled in the wake of
Muslim fanaticism after centuries of impregnable power.
Secularization eroded the very foundation of Islámic
orthodoxy. And Shí’ih Islam in particular paid the price for its
intense hostility toward the Faith of Bahá’u’lláh. It “had been
degraded and demoralized, and was being condemned to
hopeless obscurity and ultimate extinction.” Bahá’u’lláh
encapsulated the process:

> Behold, O Mu˙ammad, how the sayings and doings of
> the followers of Shí’ih Islám have dulled the joy and
> fervor of its early days, and tarnished the pristine
> brilliancy of its light. In its primitive days, whilst they
> still adhered to the precepts associated with the name
> of their Prophet, the Lord of mankind, their career was
370                                Emergence of World Civilization

> marked by an unbroken chain of victories and
> triumphs. As they gradually strayed from the path of
> their Ideal Leader and Master, as they turned away
> from the light of God and corrupted the principle of
> His Divine unity, and as they increasingly centered
> their attention upon them who were only the revealers
> of the potency of His Word, their power was turned
> into weakness, their glory into shame, their courage
> into fear. Thou dost witness to what a pass they have
> come. [GWB 69]
With the downfall of the Qájár Dynasty and its unrelenting
harassment of the Faith of Bahá’u’lláh there followed the
humiliation of the Shí’ih ecclesiastical leaders. The atrocious
acts perpetrated on the Bábís, the martyrdom of the Báb, the
banishment of Bahá’u’lláh to the most desolate of cities and the
numerous cruel sentences passed on to His innocent followers
“stand out as among the blackest acts for which posterity will
hold this blood-stained dynasty responsible” declared Shoghi
Effendi. “One more barrier that had sought to obstruct the
forward march of the Faith was now removed.” [WOB 173]

Bahá’u’lláh had been exiled from the land of His birth and
through it all bore the brunt of increasing calamities placed on
Him and the followers of the Báb when placed under the
jurisdiction of the Sultán of Turkey.

> The orders which these foes issued, the banishments
> they decreed, the indignities they inflicted, the plans
> they devised, the investigations they conducted, the
> threats they pronounced, the atrocities they were
> prepared to commit, the intrigues and baseness to
> which they, their ministers, their governors, and
> military chieftains had stooped, constitute a record
> which can hardly find a parallel in the history of any
> revealed religion. The mere recital of the most salient
> features of that sinister theme would suffice to fill a
> volume. [WOB 174]
The Bábí Cause of which Bahá’u’lláh was its leading
proponent triumphed in spite of the endless persecution by the
Iranian leaders both secular and religious. Add the cruel

Lights of ‘Irfán Book Eight                                 371

machinations of the arrogant Turkish despot ‘Abdu’l-`Azíz and
the seditious actions of Bahá’u’lláh’s own kindred and one can
only marvel that the survival of the Cause is “one of the most
intriguing and mysterious episodes of contemporary history.”
Through it all, the eroding, insidious forces of decay resulted
in catastrophic convulsions within the Ottoman Empire
culminating with the murder of the Turkish Sultán in 1876.
Precipitating the overthrow of his successor, ‘Abdu’l-Hamíd II
in 1909 were the Russo-Turkish conflict, wars of liberation and
the Young Turk movement in 1908 that liberated political and
religious prisoners. For the first time since the tender age of
eight and a half years, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá breathed freedom.

With startling swiftness these events were followed with the
calamitous Balkin wars and the liberation of Palestine
including ‘Akká and Haifa. Further dismemberment was
decreed by the Treaty of Versailles and the Sultanate was
abolished. The House of Uthman fell and the Caliphate was
extinguished. The State Religion ceased to be and the Sharí’ah
Law was annulled. About this, with respect to the Cause of
Bahá’u’lláh, the Guardian stated:

> The overthrow of the Sultanate and the Caliphate, the
> twin pillars of Sunní Islam, can be regarded in no other
> light except as the inevitable consequence of the fierce,
> the sustained and deliberate persecution which the
> monarchs of the tottering House of ‘Uthman, the
> recognized successors of the Prophet Mu˙ammad, had
> launched against it. [WOB 173]
Shoghi Effendi compared the evidence of divine visitation
that fell on the persecutors of Jesus Christ with those of
Bahá’u’lláh during the first century of their respective
dispensations. The Roman Emperor besieged Jerusalem and
destroyed the rebuilt temple. He desecrated the Holy of Holies
and removed its treasures to Rome. He further delivered the
penultimate insult by establishing a pagan colony on mount
Zion after massacring the Jews and dispersing the survivors.
Christ had warned:

> O Jerusalem, Jerusalem, which killest the prophets, and
> stonest them that are sent unto thee; how often would I
> have gathered thy children together, as a hen doth

> gather her brood under her wings, and ye would not!…
> (Luke 13:34) And when He was come near, he beheld the
> city, and wept over it, saying, If thou hadst known,
> even thou, at least in this thy day, the things which
> belong unto thy peace! But now they are hid from thine
> eyes. For the days shall come upon thee, that thine
> enemies shall cast a trench about thee, and compass
> thee round, and keep thee in on every side, and shall lay
> thee even with the ground, and thy children within thee;
> and they shall not leave in thee one stone upon another;
> because thou knewest not the time of thy visitation.

(Luke 19:41-44)

In a similar context, Bahá’u’lláh was quoted regarding
Constantinople:

> O Spot that art situate on the shores of the two seas!
> The throne of tyranny hath, verily, been established
> upon thee, and the flame of hatred hath been kindled
> within thy bosom, in such wise that the Concourse on
> high and they who circle around the Exalted Throne
> have wailed and lamented. We behold in thee the foolish
> ruling over the wise, and darkness vaunting itself
> against the light. Thou art indeed filled with manifest
> pride. Hath thine outward splendor made thee vain-
> glorious? By Him Who is the Lord of mankind! It shall
> soon perish, and thy daughters and thy widows and all
> the kindreds that dwell within thee shall lament. Thus
> informeth thee the All-Knowing, the All-Wise. [KA 52-53]
It was to the cruel Sultan ‘Abdu’l-`Azíz that Bahá’u’lláh
wrote one of His famous letters to the leaders of the world. In
it He admonished the brutal monarch, in clear and certain
terms that he should set before him God’s unerring balance and
to weigh his actions every day and every moment. He warned:
“Bring thyself to account ere thou art summoned to a
reckoning, on the day when no man shall have strength to stand
for fear of God, the day when the hearts of the heedless ones
shall be made to tremble. ” [GWB 235] To the ministers of the
Turkish State He commanded “to keep the precepts of God, and
to forsake your own laws and regulations, and to be of them

who are guided aright… Ye shall, erelong, discover the
consequences of that which ye shall have done in this vain life,
and shall be repaid for them. ” [GWB 122-123] Bahá’u’lláh
compared them to the many leaders of earlier ages who, while
superior in rank, had committed the same things they were
committing only to be consigned to inevitable doom. To the
inhabitants of Constantinople He warned “God assuredly
dominateth the lives of them that wronged Us, and is well aware
of their doings. He will, most certainly, lay hold on them for
their sins…. ” [GWB 129]

Thirteen hundred years would elapse after the passing of
Mu˙ammad before the illegitimacy of the Caliphate would be
publicly demonstrated. The Guardian quoted an astonishing
Muslim tradition that corroborated the theme of the fall of Islam:

> In the latter days a grievous calamity shall befall My
> people at the hands of their ruler, a calamity such as no
> man ever heard to surpass it. So fierce will it be that
> none can find a shelter. God will then send down One
> of My descendants, One sprung from My family, Who
> will fill the earth with equity and justice, even as it hath
> been filled with injustice and tyranny… A day shall be
> witnessed by My people whereon there will have
> remained of Islam naught but a name, and of the
> Qur’án naught but a mere appearance. The doctors of
> that age shall be the most evil the world hath ever seen.
> Mischief hath proceeded from them, and on them will
> it recoil… At that hour His malediction shall descend
> upon you, and your curse shall afflict you, and your
> religion shall remain an empty word on your tongues.
> And when these signs appear amongst you, anticipate
> the day when the red-hot wind will have swept over you,
> or the day when ye will have been disfigured, or when
> stones will have rained upon you. [WOB 179]
Bahá’u’lláh addressed the people of the Qur’án and affirmed:
“O concourse of Muslim divines! By your deeds the exalted
station of the people hath been abased, the standard of Islam
hath been reversed, and its mighty throne hath fallen. ” [WOB 179]

Det er i or a t i on of C hr i st i an I n st it u ti ons

Shoghi Effendi put the question: Could the deterioration
that attacked the fabric of the Religion of Mu˙ammad exert its
baneful influence on the institutions associated with the Faith
of Jesus Christ? He maintained that no unbiased observer
could fail to admit that the forces of irreligion and of a purely
materialistic philosophy were spreading and were beginning to
invade some of the most powerful Christian institutions of the
western world. He affirmed that some of these institutions
were already aware of the pervasive influence of the Cause of
Bahá’u’lláh. He inferred that they would regard with deepening
dismay the rise of His New World Order, as their inherent
strength would increasingly deteriorate. He noted Bahá’u’lláh’s
comment made a half-century earlier:

> The vitality of men’s belief in God is dying out in every
> land; nothing short of His wholesome medicine can
> ever restore it. The corrosion of ungodliness is eating
> into the vitals of human society; what else but the
> Elixir of His potent Revelation can cleanse and revive
> it? [GWB 199]
Secularism, the menace that attacked Islam and every other
established religion had laid hold on the communities of
Christianity to such a degree that the Guardian considered the
time in which we were moving as one of the most critical in the
history of Christianity. Many Christian missionaries
proclaimed: “A wave of materialism is sweeping round the
world.” Their reports reflected “the drive and pressure of
modern industrialism, which are penetrating even the forests of
Central Africa and the plains of Central Asia, make men
everywhere dependent on, and preoccupied with, material
things.” [WOB 181] All this was compounded by the rise of
communism characterized as ‘religious irreligion’ that had its
own passionate sense of mission. Though the Soviet Union
collapsed a half-century later, there still remains to this day one
fifth of the world under the communist yoke of atheism. It was
further stated that this form of attack was something new in
history with respect to religion in general. And equally hostile
to Christianity was nationalism, especially militant

nationalism. Yet unlike communism, nationalism is often
bound up with one religion or another. On the other hand, the
policies following World War I exerted a pernicious effect on
the institutions and beliefs connected with Christianity, one
of the most widely spread and best-organized religious systems
of the world. Intolerant and militant nationalism attributed to
the philosophy of Georg Friedrich Hegel deified the state,
inculcated a war-spirit and incited racial animosity according
to Shoghi Effendi. It also marked a weakening of the Church
and diminished its spiritual influence:

> It was being stabbed by an alien and militant atheism
> from without, and by the preachers of a heretical
> doctrine from within. Both of these forces, each
> operating in its own sphere and using its own weapons
> and methods, have moreover been greatly assisted and
> encouraged by the prevailing spirit of modernism, with
> its emphasis on a purely materialistic philosophy,
> which, as it diffuses itself, tends increasingly to
> divorce religion from man’s daily life. [WOB 183]
The Guardian characterized the clash between these
contending interests as disastrous and irreparably damaging.
Examples were listed including the dismemberment of the Greek
Orthodox Church in Russia and the blow sustained by the
Church of Rome after the collapse of the Austro-Hungarian
Monarchy. Also included was the separation of Church and
state in Spain and the persecution the Catholic Church in
Mexico. Listed too were the terrorization of Catholics and
Lutherans in the heart of Europe and the turmoil experienced
by the Church in Africa resulting from military campaigns. The
decline in the fortunes of Christian Missions in Persia, Turkey
and the Far East also exemplified reverses experienced by
Christian ecclesiastical institutions in almost every part of the
world. At this juncture, Shoghi Effendi posed an interesting
question with an observation:

> Might not this disintegrating tendency, from which
> Sunní and Shí’ih Islam have so conspicuously suffered,
> unloose, as it reaches its climax, still further calamities
> upon the various denominations of the Christian
> Church? In what manner and how rapidly this process,

> which has already set in, will develop the future alone
> can reveal. Nor can it, at the present time, be estimated
> to what extent will the attacks which a still powerful
> clergy may yet launch against the strongholds of the
> Faith of Bahá’u’lláh in the West accentuate this decline
> and widen the range of inescapable disasters. [WOB 184]
He then quoted a surprising prophetic statement by a
Protestant minister of the times:

> If Christianity wishes and expects to serve the world in
> the present crisis… it must cut back through
> Christianity to Christ, back through the centuries-old
> religion about Jesus to the original religion of Jesus.
> Otherwise, the spirit of Christ will live in institutions
> other than our own. [WOB 184]
An interesting parallel was drawn between the events in the
early Christian centuries and the first century of the Bahá’í
Era. The dominant religion of the Roman people was pagan but
it was confronted by evasive philosophies and popular cults.
They     were surrounded       by     Neo-Platonists, Gnostic
philosophers, Philonism, Mithraism and a myriad of sects,
which perverted the state religion. These and paganism were
swept away by the new Christian Faith. In the modern era,
beginning with the first century of the Bahá’í Faith, most
Christian Institutions were faced with conditions similar to
those facing Roman state religion in the first centuries of the
Common Era, namely conflicting beliefs and practices.
Ironically, this condition was augmented by the bankruptcy of
that same Faith that had conquered paganism in an earlier time.
To all this, Shoghi Effendi made a timely promise:

> Such institutions as have strayed far from the spirit
> and teachings of Jesus Christ must of necessity, as the
> embryonic World Order of Bahá’u’lláh takes shape and
> unfolds, recede into the background, and make way for
> the progress of the divinely-ordained institutions that stand
> inextricably interwoven with His teachings. [WOB 185]
He inferred that the indwelling Spirit of God which animated
the members of the early Church would be reborn in light of the

redefinition of its fundamental verities and the clarification of
its original purpose. But he made a defining statement about
the Faith of Bahá’u’lláh with respect to Christianity. He said
that there could be no variance with the animating purpose or
authority invested in the Faith of Jesus Christ and concluded
with the following unequivocal words of Bahá’u’lláh.

> We testify that when He came into the world, He shed
> the splendor of His glory upon all created things.
> Through Him the leper recovered from the leprosy of
> perversity and ignorance. Through Him the unchaste
> and wayward were healed. Through His power, born of
> Almighty God, the eyes of the blind were opened, and
> the soul of the sinner sanctified… He it is Who purified
> the world. Blessed is the man who, with a face beaming
> with light, hath turned towards Him. [GWB 85-86]

Shoghi Effendi distinguished moral downfall as a thing apart
from, yet intricately connected to the decline of religious
institutions. He makes reference to the life and conduct of the
individual as a counterpart to the organic whole of religious
institutions. No matter what direction one might turn in the
mid nineteen thirties, one could not fail to be struck by
prevailing moral decadence among men and women. And it was
undoubtedly the decline of religion as a social force that was
responsible for such a degrading condition in the Christian
world. The Guardian reiterated:

> No wonder, therefore, that when, as a result of human
> perversity, the light of religion is quenched in men’s
> hearts, and the divinely appointed Robe, designed to
> adorn the human temple, is deliberately discarded, a
> deplorable decline in the fortunes of humanity
> immediately sets in, bringing in its wake all the evils
> which a wayward soul is capable of revealing. [WOB 187]
He declared that under such conditions, the degradation of
human conduct and the dissolution of human institutions
reveal themselves in their most revolting ways and that this was
the state that individuals and institutions were approaching.
Further, when the human conscience becomes stultified and the

sense of decency obscured, the feelings of joy and hope are
gradually extinguished. He quoted Bahá’u’lláh’s lamenting
questions: “How long will injustice continue? How long is
chaos and confusion to reign amongst men? How long will
discord agitate the face of society?” [GWB 215]

The manner in which the moral downfall and the
degeneration of religious institutions that took place in the
first century of the Bahá’í Era was also reflected in the politico-
economic realm but remains too complex to adequately
estimate or analyze in a brief survey. Yet the potential impact
of the world wide dilemma resulting from the increasing rivalries
and ingrained hatreds in Europe and of the Great Depression
were becoming a matter of deep concern for Shoghi Effendi.

> The Great Depression, the aftermath of the severest
> ordeals humanity had ever experienced, the
> disintegration of the Versailles system, the
> recrudescence of militarism in its most menacing
> aspects, the failure of vast experiments and new-born
> institutions to safeguard the peace and tranquility of
> peoples, classes and nations, have bitterly disillusioned
> humanity and prostrated its spirits. [WOB 188]
The Guardian supported his argument with reference to a
few small voices that were raised by religious scholars as well as
political pundits regarding the looming alarm of worldwide
conflagration. “If war should break out again on a major scale
in Europe, it must bring the collapse of civilization as we know
it in its wake” was the warning of a prominent Minister in
Europe. Another Christian dignitary commented:

> It is likely there will have to be one more great conflict in
> Europe to definitely establish once and for all an inter-
> national authority. This conflict will be the most horrible
> of horribles, and possibly this generation will be called on
> to sacrifice hundreds of thousands of lives. [WOB 189]
The League of Nations was still in its embryonic state when
the dark shadow of impending global disaster was sweeping

over a hapless world. Yet, Shoghi Effendi raised a glimmer of
hope of a future triumph that this institution or “any other
body that may supersede it, is destined to achieve.”
Ba há’ u ’ lláh’ s P r i nc i ple of C ollec t i ve Sec u r i t y

There were several significant landmarks in the “checkered”
history of the League. The Guardian mentioned the Treaty of
Guarantee, the proposal for a United States of Europe,
economic unification of the continent, the Geneva Protocol
and the policy of sanctions. After much deliberation, fifty
some members pronounced “their verdict against an act of
aggression which in their judgment has been deliberately
committed by one of their fellow-members, one of the foremost
Powers of Europe.” This was “an event without parallel in
history.” [WOB 191]

> For the first time in the history of humanity the system
> of collective security, foreshadowed by Bahá’u’lláh and
> explained by ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, has been seriously
> envisaged, discussed and tested. For the first time in
> history it has been officially recognized and publicly
> stated that for this system of collective security to be
> effectively established strength and elasticity are both
> essential…. [WOB 191-192]
Leaders of nations pronounced a movement of public
opinion supporting the verdict. In the 1870s Bahá’u’lláh had
said, “The time must come when the imperative necessity for
the holding of a vast, an all-embracing assemblage of men will
be universally realized. ” [TB 165] And ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, referring to
the sovereigns of the world, reiterated: “They must conclude a
binding treaty, and establish a covenant, the provisions of
which shall be sound, inviolable and definite. They must
proclaim it to all the world, and obtain for it the sanction of
all the human race…” Then He followed with a startling
characterization: “All the forces of humanity must be
mobilized to insure the stability and permanence of this Most
Great Covenant. ” [WOB 191-192]

On the other hand, Shoghi Effendi observed that The League
of Nations still lacked the universality required for “the
efficacious settlement of international disputes.” In fact, the

United States held it aloof while Germany and Japan
abandoned its cause. Still, “the fact must be recognized that so
important a decision marks one of the most distinctive
milestones on the long and arduous road that must lead it to
its goal, the stage at which the oneness of the whole body of
nations will be made the ruling principle of international life.”
[WOB 193] It was however, “a faint glimmer in the darkness” that
enveloped an agitated humanity. The process of disintegration
had to continue. Much suffering would occur among nations,
creeds, classes and races before they would be forged into one
organic commonwealth. We had been warned by Bahá’u’lláh:

> The civilization so often vaunted by the learned
> exponents of arts and sciences will, if allowed to
> overlap the bounds of moderation, bring great evil
> upon men… If carried to excess, civilization will prove as
> prolific a source of evil as it had been of goodness when
> kept within the restraints of moderation… [SDC 64]

The Guardian explained that the Bahá’í community alone was
aware of the silent growth of the World Order of Bahá’u’lláh.
They were the ones who were continuously consolidating through
their activities a world embracing polity “amidst the welter of a
tempestuous age.” It was a slow and unobtrusive building
process to which the World Bahá’í community was consecrated
and that constituted the one hope of a stricken society.

In a world with impaired political and social institutions
and whose religious systems had become anemic, this “healing
agency” was taking shape and was mobilizing its forces for the
complete redemption of mankind. For almost a century it had
succeeded in preserving its identity in spite of the incessant
persecutions to which its leaders had been subjected. Its
enemies had actually caused the Faith to purge and purify its
life instead of retarding its growth. They had utterly failed to
create a permanent schism among its ranks. Those who
seditiously violated the trust of its cause were powerless to
cloud its radiance.

> Persia had been the first to repress and oppose it. Its
> monarchs had miserably fallen, their dynasty had
> collapsed, their name was execrated, the hierarchy that
> had been their ally and had propped their declining
> state, had been utterly discredited. Turkey, which had
> thrice banished its Founder and inflicted on Him cruel
> and life-long imprisonment, had passed through one of
> the severest ordeals and far-reaching revolutions that
> its history has recorded, had shrunk from one of the
> most powerful empires to a tiny Asiatic republic, its
> Sultanate obliterated, its dynasty overthrown, its
> Caliphate, the mightiest institution of Islam,
> abolished. [WOB 196]
Concurrently, the Bahá’í Faith forged unerringly ahead, unified
and undaunted. Its followers had become so inspired that
nothing could undermine their resolution.
A W or ld R eli gi on

The Faith of Bahá’u’lláh had succeeded in visibly
demonstrating its claim to be regarded as a World Religion
and not simply a philosophy of life or a mere sect of Shí’ih
Islam, a movement or an eclectic code of ethics. Its destiny
would in time reach the status of a world-embracing
commonwealth and would become the instrument of the Most
Great Peace. Indeed, the Faith was characterized by one of
Europe’s royalty:

> It is like a wide embrace, gathering together all those
> who have long searched for words of hope. It accepts
> all great Prophets gone before it, destroys no other
> creeds, and leaves all doors open. The Bahá’í teaching
> brings peace to the soul and hope to the heart. To those
> in search of assurance the words of the Father are as a
> fountain in the desert after long wandering. Their
> writings are a great cry toward peace, reaching beyond
> all limits of frontiers, above all dissension about rites
> and dogmas…. [WOB 197]
The Faith of Bahá’u’lláh had transformed the hearts of its
followers and made them lovers of mankind regardless of race,
creed or nationality. It preserved their patriotism and safe

guarded their lesser loyalties. More importantly, it reaffirmed
the Divine origins of all religions and the underlying unity with
respect to the links that bind them together.

> Their Faith they conceive to be essentially non-
> political, supra-national in character, rigidly non-
> partisan, and entirely dissociated from nationalistic
> ambitions, pursuits, and purposes.” They do not
> identify with political or ecclesiastic institutions but
> do uphold the laws of the Faith and do live by its
> principles. These are considered to be “the warp and
> woof of the institutions upon which the structure of
> His World Order must ultimately rest. [WOB 199]
Shoghi Effendi listed a variety of accomplishments by the
Faith in the short span of time since its inception, a few of
which follow. It had demonstrated the force of its cohesive
strength and of its integrating power in the fashioning of the
legal instruments designed to safeguard and regulate the
corporate life of its institutions. It had accumulated adequate
resources, material as well as cultural in every inhabited
continent. It was proving its virility and capacity in laying the
foundations for the gradual formation and establishment of
its educational, cultural and humanitarian institutions. It was
demonstrating extraordinary vitality with which its valiant
defenders, its elected representatives, its itinerant teachers and
pioneer administrators were pleading its cause. It was
acknowledged by the spontaneous tributes paid by royalty,
princes, statesmen and scholars to the sublimity of its cause
and the station of its Founders. It was counteracting the
disintegrating influences to which religious systems, moral
standards, and political and social institutions were being
subjected. He summarized:

> From Iceland to Tasmania, from Vancouver to the
> China Sea spreads the radiance and extend the ram-
> ifications of this world-enfolding System, this many-
> hued and firmly-knit Fraternity, infusing into every
> man and woman it has won to its cause a faith, a hope,
> and a vigor that a wayward generation has long lost,
> and is powerless to recover. They who preside over the

> immediate destinies of this troubled world, they who are
> responsible for its chaotic state, its fears, its doubts,
> its miseries will do well, in their bewilderment, to fix
> their gaze and ponder in their hearts upon the evidences
> of this saving grace of the Almighty that lies within
> their reach — a grace that can ease their burden, resolve
> their perplexities, and illuminate their path. [WOB 201]
Di vi n e R et r i bu ti on

The Guardian quoted a familiar phrase of Bahá’u’lláh’s. “O
ye peoples of the world! Know, verily, that an unforeseen
calamity followeth you, and grievous retribution awaiteth you.
Think not that which ye have committed hath been effaced in
My sight. ” [HW 44] And another: “We have a fixed time for you,
O peoples. If ye fail, at the appointed hour, to turn towards
God, He, verily, will lay violent hold on you, and will cause
grievous afflictions to assail you from every direction…. ” [GWB
213] How forbidding, how prophetic were these words! A short
three years after this letter by Shoghi Effendi, the calamitous
WW II began with horrific consequences that we are still
dealing with sixty plus years after the armistice. He then
encapsulated Bahá’u’lláh’s description of the stages in the
evolution of human civilization:

> The long ages of infancy and childhood, through which
> the human race had to pass, have receded into the
> background. Humanity is now experiencing the com-
> motions invariably associated with the most turbulent
> stage of its evolution, the stage of adolescence, when
> the impetuosity of youth and its vehemence reach their
> climax, and must gradually be superseded by the
> calmness, the wisdom, and the maturity that
> characterize the stage of manhood. Then will the human
> race reach that stature of ripeness which will enable it
> to acquire all the powers and capacities upon which its
> ultimate development must depend. [WOB 201]
W or ld U ni t y t he G oa l

The penultimate goal of the Revelation of Bahá’u’lláh is the
spiritual unification of the planet. Following that, the ultimate

goal is to establish a Universal Peace supported by a World
Federation wherein the personal freedom of all individuals
would be secure and the autonomy of its state members
safeguarded. This commonwealth, envisioned by Bahá’u’lláh in
the late 1800s must consist of a world legislature that would
control the entire resources of its component nations. Its
responsibility would be to enact laws that would satisfy the
needs and adjust the relationships of all races and peoples. As
He exclaimed:

> O ye children of men, the fundamental purpose
> animating the Faith of God and His Religion is to
> safeguard the interests and promote the unity of the
> human race… He Who is your Lord, the All-Merciful,
> cherisheth in His heart the desire of beholding the entire
> human race as one soul and one body. [WOB 202-203]
The Guardian continued with an extraordinary description
of the Golden Age of Bahá’u’lláh’s Dispensation. He listed
numerous idealized conditions that would become reality by
virtue of the Divine outpourings of the pen of Bahá’u’lláh.
Every aspect of life from the innermost heart of the soul to the
outer world embracing unity of global society will be
empowered by the agency of the Blessed Beauty. No aspect of
life on this earth will be neglected. He reminded the reader of
the prophecies of Isaiah some twenty-five centuries earlier:

> And he shall judge among the nations, and shall rebuke
> many people: and they shall beat their swords into
> plowshares, and their spears into pruning hooks: nation
> shall not lift up sword against nation, neither shall they
> learn war any more… (Isaiah 2:4) And there shall come
> forth a rod out of the stem of Jesse, and a Branch shall
> grow out of his roots… And the spirit of the Lord shall
> rest upon him, the spirit of wisdom and under-
> standing, the spirit of counsel and might, the spirit of
> knowledge and of the fear of the Lord. (Isaiah 11:1-2)
St. John, the author of the Apocalypse, was further quoted
regarding The New Jerusalem, a term that ‘Abdu’l-Bahá
described as Devine Civilization and symbolized by Bahá’u’lláh
as His Most Holy Book, the book of laws which constitute a

charter for the New World Order “whose provisions must
remain inviolate for no less than a thousand years.” [PUP 101-102]

> And I saw a new heaven and a new earth: for the first
> heaven and the first earth were passed away; and there
> was no more sea… And I John saw the holy city, new
> Jerusalem, coming down from God out of heaven,
> prepared as a bride adorned for her husband… And I
> heard a great voice out of heaven saying, Behold, the
> tabernacle of God is with men, and he will dwell with
> them, and they shall be his people, and God himself shall
> be with them, and be their God… And God shall wipe
> away all tears from their eyes; and there shall be no
> more death, neither sorrow, nor crying, neither shall there
> be any more pain: for the former things are passed away.

(Revelation 21:1-4)

The Guardian called to mind an affirmation by ‘Abdu’l-Bahá:

> One of the great events which is to occur in the Day of
> the manifestation of that Incomparable Branch
> (Bahá’u’lláh) is the hoisting of the Standard of God
> among all nations. By this is meant that all nations and
> kindreds will be gathered together under the shadow of
> this Divine Banner, which is no other than the Lordly
> Branch itself, and will become a single nation. [SAQ 55]
And finally from Bahá’u’lláh regarding the new creation,
that World Order in the Golden Age of His Dispensation:

> Great is thy blessedness, O earth, for thou hast been
> made the foot-stool of thy God, and been chosen as the
> seat of His mighty throne. The realm of glory
> exclaimeth: “Would that my life could be sacrificed for
> thee, for He Who is the Beloved of the All-Merciful hath
> established His sovereignty upon thee, through the
> power of His Name that hath been promised unto all
> things, whether of the past or of the future. [GWB 30]
C on c lu si on

Shoghi Effendi has masterfully identified the negative
impacts of tumultuous events in human history of the last
century and has skillfully laid out the solutions that are readily

available based on the utterances of Bahá’u’lláh. The Guardian
emphasized unity of the body of mankind as the essential
mission of Bahá’u’lláh’s Revelation and he said that the
tribulations of the Age of Transition that we were entering
were characterized as the precursors of the era that would
incarnate God’s ultimate purpose for mankind. Further, the
collapse of Islam and the deterioration of Christian
Institutions resulting from chronic internal corruption
allowed secularism and a wave of materialism to sweep the
world. Intricately connected with this were the signs of moral
downfall and the resultant breakdown of political and
economic structure. The Great Depression added further dis-
illusionment and with the menacing aspects of a recrudescent
militarism the spirits of humanity became prostrate.

Only a Divine Physician could heal an ailing society and this
would involve Bahá’u’lláh’s Principle of Collective Security,
which would be universally realized by the holding of a vast, all-
embracing assemblage. The first steps were achieved with the
establishment of the League of Nations. Albeit embryonic, the
League produced an event unparalleled in history by
pronouncing a verdict by fifty of its members against one of
its own due to an act of aggression. But it was the Bahá’í
community alone that was aware of the silent growth of the
World Order of Bahá’u’lláh. Indeed, the Faith had emerged as a
World Religion and reaffirmed the Divine origins of all
religions with their underlying unity.

This treatise is but a mere sketch of Shoghi Effendi’s letter
dated March 11, 1936. In it he captured the enormous vision of
Bahá’u’lláh in brilliantly descriptive language and he brought
the impact of spiritual realities on the material world into bold
relief. His baleful predictions made over seventy years ago have
become painfully true and the end is not in sight. Still, in the
context of the Revelation of Bahá’u’lláh there is a resplendent
light at the end of a very long tunnel. In reflecting on human
culture from the birth of its spiritual identity through the
stages of childhood and adolescence we find ourselves
abstrusely approaching a threshold of an unparalleled golden
age in the spiritual and material life of man on this planet.
