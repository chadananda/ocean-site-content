   The Challenge of Change for the Chinese in

Southeast Asia

Yin Hong Shuen

Abstract

Who are the Chinese in Southeast Asia? What are the changes that they
have been through and what are their challenges for the future? Chinese
Baháhs in some Southeast Asian countries are a microcosm of Chinese
people in this region. I will address this issue from my personal
experience as a Nanyang Chinese. Also, an e-mail survey was conducted.
The following questions were asked: What attracts the Chinese in
Southeast Asia to the Bahá'í Faith? What do they see as their contribution
to the community at large? What are some of the difficulties they face?
What changes are expected in the future? To conclude, I will outline how
and why adopting a world vision helps the Chinese in Southeast Asia cope
with their future challenges.

1\. Introduction

What is change? Various definitions exist: “make different the form,
nature, content of something”, “to become transformed or converted”, “to
become altered or modified”. Another definition of change is the
experience of “significant difference”. One way of describing the
challenge of change for the Southeast Asian Chinese is to look for
experiences that cause “significant difference”.

Who are the Chinese in Southeast Asia? I am not referring to the
Taiwanese Chinese or the Mainland Chinese who are permanent residents
of Singapore. I mean people of Chinese ancestry who are bom locally,
and whose parents emigrated to this part of the world. They may not even
speak or write Chinese. Their staple food may be Thai, Indonesian or

Indian. They are your sundry shopkeepers in a little village in Chiangmai,
your fishermen in Balik Pulau in Penang, your rubber tappers in Sarawak
as well as the Banker in Shenton way and IT specialists and electronics
engineers now in great cities from Manila to Kuala Lumpur. They come
from all walks of life. Most of them have never been to China nor know
much about their cultural heritage or beliefs, except for one or two things
like filial piety and Chinese New Year reunion dinner.

Loosely called, "The Nanyang Chinese” or Southeast Chinese,1 they
would be the descendants from the early Chinese immigrants who settled
in Southeast Asian countries. They would be those who still retain some
of the physical features and traditions or values of their forefathers. They
don’t necessarily speak Chinese, nor even any of its dialects. I discovered
this when we organized the first Southeast Asian Bahá’í Chinese
Teaching Seminar in Petahng Jaya when we had Chinese Bahá’ís from
various Southeast Asian countries. We had great difficulties because we
could only communicate with the Indonesian Chinese in Bahasa and the
Thai Chinese were not proficient in Mandarin either. In the end, we used
English, Mandarin and Bahasa to struggle through.

2\. Migration Patterns

Southeast Asia was the place where the Chinese emigrated to
predominantly
in the late 19th and 20th centuries. The Chinese were in Southeast Asia
even before the English sailed on the ’’Mayflower” to arrive on the shores
of America. In 1504 AD, Admiral Cheng Ho visited the Malacca
Sultanate. The presence of the Chinese just like the Indians in Southeast

1 This is a popularization o f the term, Nanyang huaqiao. The historian Yeu-Fam Wang
explains this term in the following way: “The most commonly used term for Chinese in
Southeast Asia is N anyang huaqiao, literally meaning overseas Chinese in the South Seas.
Hua signifies Chinese and qiao signifies a short-term visitor, a sojourner. Historically,
people who left China at any period to go abroad did not generally do so with the blessing
o f the state... The fact that many had sojourned for centuries had not altered the prevailing
expectation that they would eventually return to the motherland. This was the case at least
until mid-20th century. The other half o f the name, N anyang, means southern ocean or the
South China Sea. Nanyang is employed by Chinese to designate all the sub-continental and
island countries o f Southeast Asia.” Y.F. Wang, The National Identity o f the Southeast
Asian Chinese, p. 2.

Asia is a known historical fact. Just a few interesting examples: Brunei in
1972 unearthed a gravestone dated 1264 AD of a Chinese Muslim official
from Fujian. When the Europeans reached the East Indies in Indonesia in
the 16th century, they already found a substantial Chinese settlement,
trading in pepper. So did the Spanish when they arrived in Manila in the
same century. The Chinese chronicler Zhou Daguan in 1296 AD recorded
that there were Chinese merchants and carpenters at the Angkor city in
Cambodia. Thailand's famous King Taksin was known to be half-Chinese.
However, the influx of the Chinese to Southeast Asia came much later,
due mainly to the expansion of trade created through the opening of tin
mines and rubber plantations.

Professor Wang Gungwu outlined the migration patterns into four types2:

1\. The Trader pattern (merchants & artisans)
2\. Coolie patterns (landless labourers who worked in plantations and tin
mines)
3\. Sojourner (teachers, journalists and other professionals who went out to
promote awareness of Chinese culture and national needs)
4\. Descent or re-migrant pattern (Southeast Asian Chinese who migrated
to other countries)

Wang Gungwu states that, "Migration is a universal phenomenon made
more conspicuous today by international attention in an era of
nationalism."3 This aptly describes the situation of Chinese immigrants in
Southeast Asia.

3\. What have been these changes for the Chinese?

What have been the changes experienced by the Chinese people who
migrated to Southeast Asia? They can cover a whole gamut of cultural,
political, economic and social aspects of their lives. The processes leading
to change that occur as a result of contact between societies are complex

2 G.W. Wang China and the Chinese Overseas, pp. 3-10.
3 ibid., p 3.

112           THE SINGAPORE BAHÁ1 STUDIES REVIEW

and diverse. Dennis O’Neil describes some of these “processes of change”
to include the following4:

1\. Diffusion
2\. Acculturation
3\. Transculturation

Diffusion is the movement of things and ideas from one culture to
another. When diffusion occurs, the form of a trait may move from one
society to another but not its original cultural meaning. For instance, when
McDonald’s first brought their American style hamburgers to Moscow
and Beijing, they were accepted as luxury foods for special occasions
because they were relatively expensive and exotic.

Acculturation is what happens to an entire culture when alien traits diffuse
in on a large scale and substantially replace traditional cultural patterns.
After several centuries of relentless pressure from European Americans to
adopt their ways, Native American cultures have been largely
acculturated. As a result, the vast majority of American Indians now speak
English instead of their ancestral language, wear European style clothes,
go to school to learn about the world from a European perspective, and
see themselves as being at least a peripheral part of the broader American
society.

While acculturation is what happens to an entire culture when alien traits
overwhelm it, transculturation is what happens to an individual when he
or she moves to another society and adopts its culture. Immigrants who
successfully learn the language and accept as their own the cultural
patterns of their adopted country, have transculturated.

Over decades, especially in those areas where Chinese education has not
been encouraged or emphasized, a different set of cultural traits diffuse
and gradually replace traditional cultural patterns. An example would be
the Peranakan Chinese who speak Malay, wear Malay dress, chew betel
leaves and see themselves as part of the local community.

Despite the relatively long association with the locals, discrimination
against Chinese immigrants in Southeast Asia has been evident. In the
Philippines for instance, deep-seated Spanish suspicion of the Chinese
gave way to recognition of their potentially constructive role in economic
development. Chinese expulsion orders issued in 1755 and 1766 were
repealed in 1788. Similarly, during the Second World War, while the
Japanese occupied China and various countries of Southeast Asia, the
Chinese were again, targets of persecution.

Largely because of the rise of nationalism in Southeast Asian countries
after the 1st and 2nd world wars, the loyalty of Chinese immigrants has
often been questioned.5 Yet, if one were to make a survey of
intermarriages, it would be no surprise, in my opinion, to see that the
Chinese in Southeast Asia probably have the highest number of interracial
marriages than any of the other ethnic communities in the region.

The story of the Chinese in Southeast Asia is one of slow assimilation and
brief episodes of bloody conflict. Despite the fact that they have been
living in this region for many decades and generations, the question of
their identity continues to be of concern to themselves as well as to the
non-Chinese. They have carved a place for themselves and found success
with small businesses. It is this same success that is a source of conflict
for them. This is because even though there are estimated to be over 23
million ethnic Chinese in Southeast Asia, representing 5 percent of the
total population, they control economic power that is disproportionate to
their numbers.

Take for example, Indonesia, where Chinese immigrants account for only
4 percent of the population. They are reported to control 20 of the 25
biggest business groups in the country. In Thailand, although Chinese
immigrants make up only about 10 percent of the population, they own 90
percent of the commercial and manufacturing capital of the country, and

5 There are many books devoted to the theme o f nationalism in Southeast Asia being the
root cause o f discrimination against the Nanyang Chinese. Leo Suryadinata follows
through this theme in his book, “Chinese and Nation-Building in Southeast A sia”,
Thompson and A dloff also describe it in their book, “Minority Problems in Southeast
A sia”, and Y.F. Wang discusses it in “77ze National Identity o f the Southeast Asian .
Chinese”.

over half of its banking capital. These economic inequalities have raised
considerable tension among the people of Southeast Asia, and are
expected to continue to do so in the future.

How has the Asian Crisis and the so-called, “knowledge-based economy”
affected the Chinese in Southeast Asia? It is interesting to note that the
crisis in Asia occurred after several decades of outstanding economic
performance. Annual GDP in the ASEAN-5 (Indonesia, Malaysia, the
Philippines, Singapore and Thailand) averaged close to 8 percent over the
last ten years.

It would be hard for anyone to imagine that these changes have not
escaped the Nanyang Chinese. The problem of urbanization where the
younger and more educated flock to the cities for better paying jobs at
factories affects everyone, including the Chinese. New technologies
impact manufacturing costs and make it even more competitive to survive,
and so Chinese businesses now have to compete even harder with more
efficient and cost effective enterprises. With stock markets and exchange
rates plunging, not only foreign equity investors, but also many overseas
Chinese investors lost nearly three quarters of the value of their equity
holdings in recent years. Restrictions on monetary flow, fluctuations of
exchange currencies or sudden depreciation, severely affect many
Nanyang Chinese, who have to remit money for their children studying in
foreign countries like Australia, the United States, and the United
Kingdom. Many of their children return home, IT-(Information
Technology) savvy, infused with new knowledge from these developed
countries, and newly acquired tastes and habits. They often do well
because of the high demand for their skills and expertise, and unlike their
older and less educated countrymen, who are struggling to survive. The
next generation are propelled to the forefront of newly created jobs,
opportunities and wealth. The new South Asian Chinese elites join the
ranks of the new sophisticated cultural consumers, whose families are
smaller and whose diets are apt to contain as much bread as rice. They
travel internationally. They watch CNN news broadcasts as avidly as they
watch Hollywood movies. Intellectuals pack the concert halls to hear the
music of Western composers, who are now as much a part of Southeast
Asian culture as they are of any country in the West.

4\. Personal Experience of a Nanyang Chinese

Bom up North in Alor Setar near the Thai border, I attended the same
school as the current Prime Minister of Malaysia. My father was a
businessman who had a wine distillery but died as a Muslim, while my
mother was a school teacher who followed the Buddhist Faith until her
acceptance of the Bahá'í Faith years later. We spoke the local Hokkien
dialect and Bahasa Melayu. I followed my mother everywhere to the
temples and took amulets from Chinese mediums. When my father died,
his cortege was taken into the oldest mosque in town, there for the first
time as a little boy I thought I heard God speaking (it was actually the
echo of prayers being recited). At the age of 13,1 took a vow and became
a young monk for a short three days at the Thai Theravada Buddhist
temple. As a youth, I always felt and admired the harmony, beauty and
peace of the Buddhist, Muslim and Christian faiths.

When I think of my youth, these are some of the pictures in my mind: “A
group of elderly people with the Buddhist priests and one or two Muslim
Hajis sitting at the temple verandah, smoking and chit chatting away. The
soul stirring call of the minaret to prayers in the evenings. The chanting of
the Pali scriptures by the monks. Eating at my Malay classmate's home in
the village.”

Years later, I was shocked to learn of politically motivated racial riots and
religious fundamentalism that meant my Muslim brothers and I could not
eat from the same plate or drink from the same cup. Even to this day, I
feel very uncomfortable when any group of people, be they Chinese,
Iranians or Afrikaans get too enthusiastic about their culture and beliefs. I
remember an incident when a Malay couple whom I knew were talking
about the racial undercurrents among the various races including the
Chinese. They turned to me and said, “But you don’t understand this! You
are a Bahá'í!”

The shock of being an overseas Chinese came to me when I was a young
student. I had left Sri Lanka to enter India in the 1960's via Talaimannar,
the southern tip of the Indian subcontinent. Although holding a Malaysian
passport at the time, I was detained for a few hours because I was
classified as "Chinese". On the other hand, when I was residing in Hong
Kong in the 1970's for a short period of time, I was told how unChinese I

116        THE SINGAPORE BAHÁ1 STUDIES REVIEW

was when a Hong Kong shopkeeper in Kowloon said ’’You are Chinese
and you don’t speak Chinese”. He chastised me because I couldn’t
converse in Cantonese! That was my enigma, too Chinese to the Indian
and not Chinese enough for our Hong Kong Chinese.

It was therefore not difficult for me when I first heard about the Bahá'í
Faith. I liked its fundamental concepts of the oneness of God, the oneness
of religion and the oneness of mankind. Since religion is a very personal
affair and acceptance of a faith and its philosophy is a major change, I
thought it would be interesting to take a peek at the challenge of change of
Chinese Bahá'í s living in the Southeast Asian region.

5\. Random Sampling of Some Chinese BaháTs in the Region
Through an E-mail Survey

Since the Chinese Bahá'ís in some of these Southeast Asian countries are
a microcosm of the Chinese in this region, an e-mail survey was
conducted to find out on a very small scale, what such a change means.
While the sample size may be very small, it provided a glimpse of how
one Southeast Asian Chinese groups responded to a change, in this case, a
religious conversion amidst the many changes surrounding them over the
recent years.

The survey set out to discover how the Chinese in Southeast Asia respond
to the Bahá'í Teachings and how they see their role in the worldwide
Bahá'í community. The following questions were asked in the survey:

What attracts the Chinese in Southeast Asia to the Bahá'í Faith?
What do they see as their contribution in the community?
What are some of the difficulties they face in the change?

Thirty-three responses were received. They were mainly from Malaysia
and Singapore and almost 80% of them had ten or more years of
membership in the Bahd'i community. One third of these people came
from a Buddhist background.

The three reasons/factors whibh attracted the respondents to the Bahd’i
Faith, in the order of their popularity were:

The Challenge of Change for the Chinese in SEA

1\. Spiritual, practical and relevancy of Bahá’í teachings (almost 85%

chose this)
2\. Sense of spiritual identity
3\. Belonging to an international community of people which subscribes

to the three oneness principles (God, Religion and Humanity)

Other reasons were:
Belief in the protecting powers of the Faith
Fellowship and love

How the respondents thought they could contribute to the Bahá’i
Community in general were, again according to popularity:

1\. Add to the cultural and spiritual enrichment of the community (72%).
2\. Bring in more pragmatic and innovative ways of teaching the Faith.
3\. Serve as a “bridge” between traditional Chinese and host

communities.

The problems or difficulties that the respondents encountered in adjusting
to their new Bahá'í beliefs in the initial stages were:

1\. Fasting
2\. Family / Parental objections
3\. Peer acceptance

Some of their remarks about difficulties of adapting to the change were:

Consent for interracial marriage and the amount of time spent on meetings
and travelling to meetings
Elders' fears that one is being drawn away from traditions
Peer pressure and ridicule in such acts as fasting, abstaining from alcohol
Living the life (not backbiting etc)
The Bahá'í Faith sounded obscure
Disbelief in the Bahd'i Faith being a religion
Obedience to the institutions and self-restraint
Lack of Chinese literature
Difficulty of practising consultation
Racial prejudices (from other non-Chinese in the community)

118        THE SINGAPORE BAHÁT STUDIES REVIEW

Based on this e-mail survey, it was found that Chinese Bahá'ís are a
pragmatic group, looking at religion from very practical considerations,
while at the same time, they value a sense of spiritual connectedness.
They also like the idea of belonging to an international community and
wish to contribute to it.

The problems that the respondents faced in adjusting to their new beliefs
were mainly related to fasting, family objections and peer acceptance.
Despite these considerable difficulties, they were able to adjust to the
change. This brings me to the last part of my paper. What is the future of
the Overseas Chinese in Southeast Asia? Will they become fully accepted
as part of their country? How will they meet the new challenges of
change?

6\. Future Changes

In the political arena, successive generations of Southeast Asian Chinese
will probably develop greater bonds with their respective countries of
residence, particularly in countries where there is no obvious
discrimination of race, culture or religion. They will integrate with the
locals and develop some distinct characteristics of their own, such as the
Peranakans.

The Chinese of Southeast Asia will never be “Chinese Chinese” in as
much as Australians or Americans are not English. Except for those who
are presently in their eighties, very few Chinese in Southeast Asia are
expected to have any emotional attachment to Mainland China. Southeast
Asia is now home for the new generation.

In the area of economics, the impact of E-economy will be further felt and
with more business restructuring and trade liberalization, small and
medium enterprises including those belonging to Southeast Asian Chinese
will be severely affected. For those who have been fortunate in obtaining
better education in these newer technologies, they will do well. As a result
of decades of investment in education, hard work and resilience in their
host environments, the Southeast Asian Chinese are expected to achieve
even more economic success than they have already had. On the other
hand, these new successes could again be perceived as a threat to the

locals. The resentment will not only come from the local non-Chinese, but
also the Chinese in China, who do not necessarily welcome business
competition from foreign Chinese businesses.

With improvements in the economy, there will be a corresponding
increase in materialism and less concern with religious matters. However,
not all will be benefiting from this wealth, and the gap between the haves
and have nots will continue to widen. We will continue to witness the
migration and draining of local Chinese talent throughout Southeast Asian
countries to more developed ones elsewhere in the world.

There will be greater mobility in the future. For the younger and Western
educated Chinese, whose parents or family may be in Jakarta or Kuala
Lumpur, an employer may be in Hong Kong or Singapore, and project,
work may be anywhere in the Asia Pacific.

Many changes that we see now as external events, incidents or pictures in
the media daily, will continue to grow in importance: Chinese shops burnt
as a result of racial or religious riots, the gap between the very rich and
poor among the Chinese will continue to widen, Chinese Karaoke lounge
bars and triad societies will continue to proliferate, and so on.

Obviously, such conflicts will not go away overnight. It is easy to be
pessimistic as we scan the present political and social scene not to feel
anxious about the immediate present and future. The Asian crisis, the
emergence of China as a superpower, all these factors are not helping to
reduce the many dangers that threaten the Chinese in Southeast Asia.
Thus, in my opinion, the many problems experienced before the Asian
crisis will continue.

To conclude, I will outline how and why adopting a world vision helps the
Chinese in Southeast Asia cope with their challenges. Changes are
external. Transitions are internal. As the famous ancient Greek
philosopher Heraclitus observed, the only thing permanent is change. One
could look to the past and analyze the socio-political and historical factors
shaping the events changing and afflicting the Nanyang Chinese, or one
could view the change as a journey of many stages.

120         THE SINGAPORE BAHA’I STUDIES REVIEW

To me, the biggest challenge facing the overseas Chinese is how to
manage the transition. It is not what these changes are so much as how
they should manage the changes which are under their control and their
own perceptions of these changes. I believe the Chinese of Southeast Asia
have reached a turning point, a crisis. The Chinese word for crisis is a
combination of two words: danger and opportunity.

7\. Who am I? What am I?

There is a popular Jackie Chan movie called "Who am I?" It is about a
Chinese soldier who is lost in an African country and suffers from
amnesia after a plane crash. He lives among the local Africans, adopting
their ways, and is eventually able to discover his true identity (and of
course, helps thrash some bad people in the process).
The Chinese in Southeast Asia are like economic refugees who left their
homeland, settled down, and are now victims of various social political
and economic circumstances. They should be proud of their heritage
without being xenophobic. A good guide to follow would be this quote
from a Bahd'i international community statement:
“There is no question that one's unique cultural characteristics should be
prized, and that pride in one's culture can be a healthy emotion that can
motivate persons to achieve their full potential and reach out to others,
both within and without their particular group. At the same time, if taken
to an extreme, as it too often is, attachment to one's group can lead to
mistrust of and enmity towards other groups. Unbridled pride in one's
heritage then becomes an excuse for the venting of hate upon others,
because they do not share the same culture, language or religion. Such
attitudes contribute to the deplorable violations of minority rights that
have occurred throughout this century.”6

The many changes that the Chinese Southeast Asians are now facing and
will be facing, may be viewed as a threat or an opportunity. The threats
include: loss of identity, confusion, unknown future, and insecurity. These

Religious and Linguistic Minorities, 21 Jan. 1991, UN Document #E/CN.4/1991/NGO/9,
BIC Document #91-0102.

threats may result in defensiveness, anxiety, and loss of confidence. The
opportunities on the other hand, include: learning, creativity and more
importantly, survival and recognition. For too long, the Chinese Southeast
Asians have been the victims of change. In this new Millennium, they
must rise up and be in the forefront of change, positive change agents in
the progress and advancement of human society. To do that, they must
view themselves as part of that inevitable movement toward a new order,
a world commonwealth, which calls for sufficient flexibility to respond to
the growing and ever-changing needs of modem society.

The fundamental principle they must now recognize is that man is
spiritual and that ”... the source of human rights is the endowment of
qualities, virtues and powers which God has bestowed upon mankind
without discrimination of sex, race, creed or nation. To fulfil the
possibilities of this divine endowment is the purpose of human
existence."7

The second principle is that "Minorities and majorities must embrace an
expansive view of world society that sees all human beings as members of
one human family, united in their fundamental aspirations, yet enriched
by the precious variation in human thought, language, religion and
culture. The development of such a universal and unshakable
consciousness of the oneness of mankind is essential if the rights of
minorities are to be fully realized."8

It is these two visions, that many Chinese Bahá’í s, enamoured by the love
of Bahá'u’lláh, are working towards. It is that role that will prove to be the
turning point and an example of successful living, which will be a model
for the Chinese of Southeast Asia. As it is said in the Bible, Proverbs
29:18, “Where there is no vision, the people perish: but he that keepeth
the law, happy is he."

8\. Conclusion

This paper is an attempt to describe the presence of the Chinese in
Southeast Asia at the macro level, and look at some of the changes
affecting them. Some personal experiences are shared of what it means to
be a Southeast Asian Chinese in a changing environment. A small survey
is taken of Chinese Bahá'ís to find out what attracted them to Bahá'ís
beliefs, the difficulties they encountered, and what they feel they can
contribute to their respective Bahá'í and Chinese communities. An attempt
is then made to outline the future changes awaiting the Chinese in
Southeast Asia and why a world vision helps.

Adopting a world vision may appear like a simplistic single prescription
approach to solving the ethnic problems of the Chinese. While there are
undoubtedly other important factors, such as education, human rights
legislation etc, I maintain that the single most important challenge for the
overseas Chinese is to give up their traditional exclusivity, and become
partners and co workers in the formation of a world society. It will not
come immediately. It will take courage, humility and faith to let go of the
past and embrace the uncertain future, just like our forefathers did when
they left the shores of China. Success this time, will not be measured in
terms of material gains, but spiritual value. Just as our forefathers were
driven by the dream of a better life, our dream should be to bring about a
better world.

I believe that the magnificent Chinese adaptability to change, and their
eclectic approach to life, will make them succeed and thrive once more in
the new millennium. It is this very same pragmatic attitude and
philosophy of life, as demonstrated in the past by them embracing one of
the world's great spiritual traditions, Buddhism, for example, that led to
the further blossoming of Chinese civilization. Similarly, I believe that the
Bahá'í Faith will contribute in no small measure to a renewal of
civilization not only among the ethnic Chinese but also among all the
people of the world.
