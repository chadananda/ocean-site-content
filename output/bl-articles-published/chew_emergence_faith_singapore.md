       The Emergence of the Baha'i Faith in

Singapore
(1950-1972)

Phyllis Ghim-Lian Chew

Abstract

The advent of a world religion is usually the beginning of a significant
phase in the spiritual history of a country. This paper analyses the
emergence of the Baha'i Faith in Singapore in the first twenty years of its
existence. This history will take us from the arrival of the first pioneers in
Singapore in 1950 to the formation of the National Spiritual Assembly of
the Baha'is of Singapore in 1972. It reviews the work of Baha'i
pioneering families, the activities of the Local Spiritual Assembly of
Singapore and the strategies employed to teach and proclaim the existence
of the Baha'i Faith. The significant features of the early Baha'i
community are then summarised.

Introduction

Singapore can be said to be represenrative of the geographic region
of "Southeast Asia". Its three million population in a tiny land area of
626 square kilometres represents a cross-section of the people of South
and East Asia. There are four major races on the island - Chinese,
Malay, Indian and Eurasian, each with their own distinctive history and
culture. Linguistically, the island has four official languages and in
addition to these, its populace speak a large variety of other Chinese,
Indian and Malay dialects. In terms of religious affiliation, almost every

major Faith has found a home. The Chinese are predominately
Confucianists, Taoists, and Buddhists (what has been called "the Chinese
religion")1 the Malays predominantly Muslim, the Indians predominately
Hindu and the Eurasians predominantly Christian.

Situated in the heart of the myriad islands of Southeast Asia, on the
crossroads between India and China, Singapore became the natural port
of transit for many sea travellers. Today, its international airport
performs the identical function that its seaport had traditionally
performed. It is an important centre for the exchange of goods between
the countries of Southeast Asia and more generally for the world Its
strategic location and its natural harbour were in fact the main reason for
its colonisation by the British in 1819.

The 1950*8 marked the main boundary between colonial and
postcolonial era since it saw the liberation of Singapore and the rest of
Southeast Asia from European rule. Like the rest of Southeast Asia and
together with Africa and South America, Singapore was part of the so-
called "third world*. It was a time when new ideas and technology began
to challenge traditional patterns of living. The period also marked the
introduction of a new world religion to Singapore - the Bahá*í Faith. This
paper analyses the emergence of this unique phenomenon. The first
twenty-two years of the BaháT Faith is examined and this takes us from
the arrival of the first BaháT pioneers in Singapore in 1950 to the
formation of the National Spiritual Assembly (NSA) of the BaháTs of
Singapore in 1972. It reviews the work of BaháT pioneering families, the
activities of the Local Spiritual Assembly of Singapore and the central
strategies employed to teach and proclaim the existence of the BaháT
Faith.

By Way of India

The continent of India has always played a significant part in the
political, social and cultural fortunes of Southeast Asia. The region's
traditional link to the Indian subcontinent can be seen in the fact that it
was often referred to as "Further India" by Europeans before the Second

See Chew, The Chinese Religion.

World War.2 The British, for instance, used to rule the Straits Settlements
of Penang, Singapore and Malacca from the office of the Governor-
General in India. The spiritual history of the region is also connected to
India. Religions such as Buddhism, Hinduism and Islam in countries such
as Burma, Thailand, Indonesia and Malaysia were mainly transmitted by
Indian traders visiting the region. Transmission was often effected through
marriage and other social contact, often facilitated through the wealth of
the Indian traders and their claim to magical powers.3 On the whole, it
has been a region receptive to the advent of new religions. Before the
advent of Hinduism, Buddhism, Islam and the Baha'i faith (in that order),
the spiritual characteristics of Southeast Asia were ancestor worship and
beliefs which involved animism, a cosmological dualism between
mountain and sea, and a numerology associated with magic. Thus, when
more sophisticated religious systems wore introduced, they were often
recognised and appreciated as such and easily absorbed by the local
people. New faiths were easily embraced without the necessity of
prolonged conflicts or religious wars so apparent in other countries.4

The first Baha'i teachers to this region, characteristically, also came
from India. Like previous traders, teachers and sojourners, their intended
destination was the comparatively more populated Javanese islands. A
journey by sea would often take these travellers through the Straits of
Malacca, forcing them to stop at the Portuguese (later Dutch and British)
port of Malacca, Penang and Singapore for refuelling and recreation. In
the 1880's, two Baha'i teachers, Sulayman Khan Ilyas (popularly known
as Jamal Effendi) and Siyyid Mustafa Roumie, stopped in Singapore for a
few weeks on their way to the Javanese and Celebes islands.5 Jamal
Effendi was the first Persian teacher of the Faith sent to India in 1878 on
the instruction of Baha'u'llah, while his travel companion, Mustafa
Roumie was a Muslim of Iraqi decent, whom he had converted to the
Baha'i Faith during his religious teaching tour in India. In the 1880's both
of them decided to team up for the purpose of teaching the Faith to the

inhabitants of the countries of Southeast Asia. An account of this
particular journey was written by Roumie and subsequently published.6
Although Roumie does not give a specific date of arrival, one can infer
from his account of the events leading up to the journey that they visited
the Dutch East Indies in 1883.7

Their sea route to the Javanese islands meant that they had to pass
through the Straits of Malacca. They docked at the ports of Penang,
Malacca and Singapore for refuelling and rest. There are verbal accounts
that they may have engaged in some trading of horses.8 In Singapore, they
stayed at the Arab quarters of the town, as guests of the Turkish Vice
Consul, a well-known Arab merchant. During this period, they mixed
freely with the Arab community. It is very likely that they taught the
Baha'i Faith although it is unlikely that they managed to reach the
Chinese race (the majority racial group in Singapore) due to language
problems and the fact that 19th Century Singapore was generally
segregated geographically along racial lines. From Singapore, they caught
a boat for Batavia (Jakarta), then the chief seaport of Java, where they
encountered a lot more success in their teaching endeavours.9

It was to be in the 20th Century, a few more decades lata:, before
any other Baha'i stepped foot on the island. It is likely that two well-
known BaháT teachers, Mason Remey and Martha Root, in their travels
to China and Japan may have stopped on the island of Singapore although
it is unlikely that they would have stayed long enough to do any effective
teaching work.10

Root: "What can I do to promote the Baha'i movement in Singapore, my home city?"
See Seow, The Pure in Heart, p. 59.

The Emergence of the Bahá Y Faith in Singapore                27

It was only in the 1950's that the first Baha'i "pioneer" chose to settle in
Singapore. A pioneer is different from a travel-teacher in the sense that
unlike the latter who has chosen to teach the Faith for a temporary period
in the countries of their travel, a pioneer is one who leaves his place of
residence to promote his belief in a new location, whether within his
country or outside it. They often stay longer than a travel teacher. They
are not "missionaries" in the commonly understood sense of the term since
no special theological training is involved. While "pioneering" may
constitute an individual's sole purpose, Baha'i pioneers often combine it
with furthering their formal education, with business opportunity or career
enhancement, or with a creative retirement. Few receive any funding
although they may be assistedfinanciallyat critical moments, especially
during the process of establishing themselves.11

The first Baha'i pioneers to settle in Singapore were Dr K. M.

Fozdar and his wife, Mrs. Shirin Fozdar. In 1950, as part of the goals of
the second seven-year plan (1946-1953), Shoghi Effendi, the Guardian of
the Baha'i Faith, instructed the National Spiritual Assembly of India to
send pioneers to the whole of Southeast Asia. Requests were made to the
believers in India to volunteer to relocate to the region. Heeding the call,
the Fozdars volunteered to pioneer to Indonesia.

Accordingly, Dr Fozdar resigned from his medical appointment
with the State Railways in India and made plans to leave for Indonesia.
As it was easier to obtain a visa to Jakarta from Singapore rather than
from India, he booked a one-way ticket on a P and O Liner to Singapore.
The journey by ship took three weeks and he arrived in Singapore on the
26th May 1950. On alighting, he immediately sought entry to Indonesia.
Despite several attempts at the Indonesian consulate in Singapore, he was
unsuccessful in obtaining a visa for entry into the country. Failing in his
mission and reluctant to return to India^ he decided to stay on in
Singapore in the hope of reapplying again foe re-entry in the near future.
There were other advantages for staying on in Singapore. For one, it was
in close proximity to the Indonesian islands. Its affairs were also
conducted in English, a language in which he wasfluent.Being an Indian
national, he was also not unfamiliar with British administrative rule.
Thus, very quickly and with the help of friends which he had made on

\[11\] See Hassall, Pacific Baha'i Communities.
28                 THE SINGAPORE BAHAT STUDIES REVIEW
board ship, he quickly found employment as a private medical practitioner
in the colony.12 However, he was never to realise his goal of pioneering to
the Indonesian islands. He remained in Singapore until his sudden passing
from a heart attack eight years later - in 1958.

Subsequent years also saw the arrival of other BaháT pioneering
families in Singapore. They came to settle, and simultaneously, to pursue
their own career and business opportunities. There was, for instance, Col.
Eshraghian, a Persian who came as a pioneer with his family in 1958 and
stayed for two years before leaving for Australia. Other pioneers who
resided in Singapore in the late fifties and who stayed for at least a year
included Mahesh Dayal and Manguhbhai Patel from India, Mr and Mrs
Wesley Huxtable from Canada and John McHenry III from the United
States. In the sixties, these pioneers were joined by Mr. and Mrs.
Rostrum RahnemafromPersia and Mary RobinsonfromBritain.13.

The Proclamation of the Baha'i Faith in Singapore

After securing accommodation and a stable means of income, Dr
Fozdar cabled his wife, Shirin, to join him in Singapore. From the day
Shirin Fozdar arrived on the island (19th September 1950), the Baha'i
Faith became very well known. This was because she was able to generate
enormous publicity for herself and the Faith in whatever she was doing.
When the liner which brought her from India was about to arrive. Dr
Fozdar seized the opportunity to inform the local press that "an eminent
feminist from India" had arrived and would be giving public talks on
women's rights. This bold gesture on a rather conservative British colony
in the 1950 led the Straits Times, the leading English daily,14 to announce
her arrival on itsfrontpage with the caption "A women with a message".

\[12\] Dr Arthur Thevathasan offered him a job in his clinic within a month of his arrival in
Singapore. Dr Fozdar accepted, and worked with him throughout his stay in Singapore.

\[13\] However, Dr and Mrs. Fozdar stayed the longest, with Mrs Fozdar taking up
Singapore citizenship in 1959. Both of them are buried in the Baha'i Cemetery in
Singapore.

This first article not only reported about hor feminist activities in India
but also the fact that she was the "Vice President of the National
Assembly of the B-aha'fs of India and Burma" and that "Baha'is are
dotted all over the world." The report also mentioned that "They believe
in universal brotherhood, the unity of mankind, a spiritual civilisation, a
universal language and universal peace and the establishment of world
government."15 Thus, the Baha'i Faith in Singapore was born, from the
very beginning, in a blaze of publicity.

The day after hot arrival, Mrs. Fozdar gave a public lecture at the
Singapore Rotary Club, then the most prestigious club in the colony. As
this was the first public lecture given by a woman at the Rotary Club
(then an all-male preserve), the press found this newsworthy and reported
parts of her speech the following day under the caption "No more
nonsense from men, says Mrs. Fozdar." Once again, the article had a
concluding paragraph which mentioned that "Mrs. Fozdar spoke on the
new world order which she said was originated by BaháVlláh, the
founder of the Baha'i Faith."16

Mrs. Shirin Fozdar was now in constant demand as a public
speaker. From the day of her arrival up to the year of ha- departure
(1961)17, she spoke on topics such as "the Brothahood of Man" "The
Solution to World Peace" and "Religion should be the Cause of Unity" in
associations, clubs, societies, schools, libraries and ova the radio.18 One
such society in which membas were intaested in what the Baha'i Faith
had to say regarding "the unity of religion" and "the oneness of mankind"
was the Theosophical Society. A significant portion of the early believas
on the island were in fact, forma membas of the society. A prominent
memba of the Singapore Baha'i community, Teo Geok Leng, a

professional accountant, was for example, a former President of the

The Women's Platform

The Baha'i Faith is closely connected with the rise of the early
women's movement in Singapore. Indeed, the Faith was effectively
proclaimed in Singapore (and to a lesser extent, Southeast Asia and the
world), on the wings of the movement. In the 1950's in Singapore,
women had begun to participate more actively in public life and to speak
up on issues which affected them adversely.20 Shirin Fozdar's contribution
to and ideas about the women's cause were very much motivated by her
Baha'i beliefs. The Faith urges its adherents to "walk the spiritual path
with practical feet" and emphasised that a good Baha'i was one who
would dedicate his or her life to the advancement of human civilisation.21
The direct promotion of the equality of the status of men and women, one
of the tenets of the Faith, was one such measure which the Baha'is believe
would bring about a "new world order."

The platform which Mrs. Fozdar used to promote the principle of
the equality of the sexes was that of the Singapore Council of Women
(SCW). In November 1951, she called a meeting of prominent women in
the colony to discuss the formation of an organisation which would act as
an "umbrella" body for the various women's organisations then existing
in Singapore. This would give the SCW the license to act as the collective

\[19\] Teo was a member of the Local Spiritual Assembly (LSA) of Singapore for over
twenty years.

\[20\] For example, in 1949, Mrs. Robert Eu, a close friend of Mrs Shirin Fozdar and a
member of the protem committee of the Singapore Council of Women, became the first
woman to be elected into the Legislative Assembly of Singapore. In the next few years,
other women would be nominated or elected into the same Assembly as well as the
Municipal Council.

\[21\] The motif that was on display was that of social reformism. This was basically a
program advocating specific social reforms and universal social principles, such as the
abolition of extremes of wealth and poverty, the emancipation of women, universal
compulsory education, the adoption of an international auxiliary language, and the
fostering of means to promote the unity, hannony and spiritual development of the
human race.

voice of women in Singapore and enable it to "ensure through legislation
if necessary, justice to all women and to further their welfare as embodied
in the United Nations Declaration of Human Rights."22 The idea was
appealing and the SCW was formally registered in April 1952 amidst
intense public interest and press coverage.23

As the elected secretary-general of the SCW throughout the
1950's,24 Mrs. Fozdar spoke fearlessly on the controversial issues of
polygamy and divorce which affected women's welfare adversely, e.g.
"Shame and misery are forced on Muslim women in Malaya in the name
of God and religion," "Malay beats Hollywood: 60 out of 100 marriages
end on rocks" and "Polygamy feeds the wolf in man". Such statements
would often make the headlines.25 This prompted a local papa*, the Malay
Mail to write an editorial on "Women Leaders", pointing out that Mrs.
Fozdar had a rapidly increasing following throughout Malaya and
Singapore and not from the womenfolk only."26

The formation of the SCW was an important milestone for the
proclamation of the Baha'i Faith in Singapore because on many occasions
when Mrs. Fozdar was speaking on "women's rights", there would be the
accompanying paragraph that this notion was part of the "new world
order", which was originated by Baha'u'llah, "the prophet founder of the
Baha'i Faith." In this indirect fashion, the general public became familiar
with terms such as "Baha'f' and associated it with notions such as
"human rights", "women's rights", "world language" and "world
tribunal".27

In addition, because of Mrs. Fozdar's fame as a crusader of
women's rights, the papers were willing to report on other talks she
delivered which were not on "women rights" but on the Baha'i Faith.
Thus, Singapore readers were exposed to brief summaries of her views

such as the "Concept of a World Conimonwealth", "A Universal
Language", "A World Legislature", and how "national rivalries could be

replaced by racial harmony, understanding and Cupertino.

The SCW also provided an avenue for women from all walks of
life to meet. To encourage mass participation, membership fees wore kept
low and open to all women regardless of race, religion and nationality.
Mrs. Fozdar's "progressive" ideas captured the imagination of the
populace and before long, SWC's ideas wore adopted by other women
groups hoping to seize political power. The Women's League of the
People's Action Party, organised in 1956, for example, encouraged
women to organise themselves in order to press for legal reforms.29 In
1958, a Singapore branch of the Pan Pacific Southeast Asian Women's
Association (PPSEAWA) came into existence and began to host seminars
to promote the social and legal status of women. One Singaporean woman
leader, Mrs. George Lee, became so impressed with the SCW's agenda
that she later became a Baha'i.30

Another way in which the Faith was proclaimed was through the
establishment of a "girls" club in Singapore by the SCW. This idea was
first mooted by the Social Welfare Department who noted that there were
at present eight "boys club" but no "girls club" in Singapore. The
Department asked the SCW to consider the sponsoring of one. The SCW
took up the idea and formed the first girls' club in Singapore. This club
began functioning in February 1953 at the Joo Chiat Welfare Center31
with volunteers recruited from both the SCW and the Baha'i community
to help in the organisation of lessons such as English, the vernacular
languages, cooking, sewing and the art of self defence.32

\[28\] See e.g. Singapore Tiger Standard, 28.11.1958. The SCW had 100 paid-up member
two months after its formation (Straits Times 29.5.1952) and 1,000 members a year
later (Straits Times, 2.4.1953).

Charter of 1961 which made into law most of the demands made by the SCW and with
the departure of Mrs. Fozdar from Singapore soon after.

The Early Baha'i Community of Singapore

The Local Spiritual Assembly (LSA) of Singapore

The Baha'i administrative system is characterised by the absence of
clergy. It is the responsibility of each individual Baha'i to assist in
propagating the religion, according to a code which favours dissemination
of information and which prohibits proselytism. While the Fozdars were
unable to find any believers in the first two years of their stay in
Singapore, things began to change from the beginning of the third year.33
The first Baha'i was enrolled into the Faith in early 1952. He was
Naraindas Jethanand, an Indian national working as a textile salesman
whom Mrs. Fozdar had invited to a "fireside" at her home.34 He was
soon followed by Mr. and Mrs. Cheng Wei Min, neighbours of the
Fozdars and Mr. Teo Geok Leng and Goh Beng Wan, both of whom wore
friends of Dr Fozdar from the Theosophical Society. This small group
began to introduce the Faith to otherfriendsandfromthen on, there was a
slow but steady trickle of declarants.

There being now more than nine members in March 1952, the
Fozdars began to look into the formation of an assembly which could
administer the religious and administrative affairs of the infant
community.35 This could not be done earlier since there were not enough
new Baha'is to participate in an election which would elect nine members
to sit on the Assembly. By April 1952, there was a total of 12 declared

\[33\] In late 1951, a little discouraged, the Fozdars wrote to the Guardian of the Baha'i
Faith expressing doubts on staying. The Guardian encouraged their continued efforts,
and compared the region to initial "difficult places" such as Italy and Switzerland but
which had later became strongholds of the Faith. He told them not to be disheartened,
assuring them that he would pray for "the harvest to come in." (Letter from the
Guardian to Dr and Mrs Fozdar, n.d.)

Narain Das was an Indian national working in Singapore as a textile salesman. Mrs.

Fozdar had made his acquaintance while buying some materials for a sari. The same
day she invited him for a fireside and he declared his belief. Little else is known of him
but he is reputably the first believer on the island (Interview with Mrs. Fozdar, August
1986)

Following the guidelines set down by the Baha'i administrative order, this had to be
done by secret ballot, without nominations or the campaigning of votes.

believers. The Fozdars began to make plans for electing the nine
members who would constitute the first Local Spiritual Assembly (LS A)
of the Baha'is of Singapore.36 The first election was held in April 1952
and thefirstelected members were (in alphabetical order): Mr. Gianchand
Datswani, Mr. Goh Beng Wan, Dr John Fozdar,37 Dr K. M.Fozdar, Mrs.
Shirin Fozdar, Mr. Kishenchand, Mr. Motiram, Mr. Ramsay, and Mr.
TeoGeokLeng.38

In the early years, the Faith was attractive to the Indian community.

There were seven of Indian origin on the Assembly - three of them
members of the Fozdar family and four others of Indian nationality who
had met the Fozdars in the course of their work in Singapore. Only two
members were Chinese and they were English-speaking, close friends of
Dr K. M. Fozdar from the Singapore Theosophical Society. The Fozdars
were not successful in drawing in the Malays (who were predominantly
Muslims) or the Eurasian (who were predominantly Christian). Indian
believers distinguished themselves as stalwart adherents of the Faith.
Some other Indian nationals who were key members of the early
Singapore community were Kishen Khemani and Shatur Chotrani.39
Another was Gian Datwani, who later pioneered to Japan and Hong
Kong. There were also other active Singapore believers of the fifties such
as Pishu and Vashi, who eventually pioneered to West Africa.

The early community was active in holding weekly "firesides"

which were publicised by word-of-mouth to their friends and which wore
conducted at the members' respective homes. Regular firesides are a
means for Baha'is to talk about their Faith. It involves sharing the Baha'i
principles with those willing to give it a hearing and seeking a positive

community e.g. Mrs. Shirin Fozdar, Mr. Koh Lian Chin, and Mr. Teo Geok Leng.

response from the audience. BaháTs would invite friends and
acquaintances to their homes and would teach them about the Faith. If the
listener was interested, another invitation was issued and this would go
on. The home of the Fozdars, for example, became known as the "Baha'i
Center" and was the first such Center registered with the Singapore
authorities. It was from such occasions that the first believers of the
Baha'i Faith were found. The early believers also observed the 19 Day
Feast which was an occasion whore BaháTs would gather to read the
scriptures, to discuss the administrative duties of the Faith and to socialise
among themselves. This was often held in the believers' homes on a
rotational basis. However, by the early sixties, the Singapore community
had saved enough to purchase a small flat at Jalan Kechil, for their
regular meetings. This became the Baha'i Center for the next few years.
This eventually proved inadequate for the community's growing needs and
was later sold in order to purchase a small bungalow, with a little garden,
at Hartley Grove, Frankel Estate, in the late sixties.40

Visitors

The small group of early believers (approximately 20-40 in
number)41 were sustained by periodic talks given by visiting BaháTs.
Baha'i dignitaries such as "Hands of the Cause of God" Dr. R Muhajir,42
A. Faizi, and Collis Featherstone would often stop in Singapore either

subcommittees. (Interview with Mrs George Lee and Shirin Fozdar, 1986).

\[42\] Dr Muhajir may be singled out for special attention. He was the Hand assigned by
the Guardian in 1957 to guide the growth of the Faith in Southeast Asia. He visited
Singapore and Malaya frequently and was often the speaker at summer schools and
youth conferences (held in Malaya) to which many Singaporeans would drive up to
attend. Members of the Hands of the Cause, a Baha'i institution, are responsible for
the propagation and preservation of the unity of the Baha'i Faith.

would spontaneously volunteer to pioneer to other countries.43 Other
frequent visitors included well-known Baha'is such as K. Samimi and K.
Payman from Java.44 As mentioned, the strategic location of Singapore
encouraged prominent BaháT speakers to break their journey and stop
there. Another Hand of the Cause, Shua'u'llah Ala'i, stopped to teach for
a week in January 1960, on his way back to Iran after attending the
historic conference of the Cause in the Holy Land in November 1959.45

The visit of yet another dignitary, Hand of the Cause Amatu'l Bahá
Ruhiyyih Khanum, in Malaysia in 1961 and 1964 gave an added boost to
the young community. She toured both Malaya and Singapore and in
doing so touched the hearts of the believers leaving them with a feeling of
awe and inspiration the aura of which was not forgotten for a long time.
She was in Singapore at the beginning and end of her tour to Malaya.
The Local Spiritual Assembly of Singapore organised a well-publicised
talk entitled "All the Races are needed" at the Singapore National
Library.46

The last "Hand" to inspire the infant community of Singapore was
Tarazu'Uah Samandari.47 In 1966, at the age of 93, he visited Singapore
and Malaysia and gave talks at all the places he visited. Thousands of
believers gathered at places along the route to hear him speak. Being then
the only living link to Baha'u'llah, he was looked upon with awe and
admiration. He was the guest of honour at the Baha'i Seminar held in
Singapore in December 1966 at the Chinese Chamber of Commerce. In
that week when he was in attendance, the Singapore community played
host to the many Malayans, Vietnamese and Thais who journeyed down
especially for the conference. u

Singapore and Malaya

The LSA of Singapore came under the jurisdiction of the National
Spiritual Assembly (NSA) of the BaháTs of India in the first five years of
its existence (1952-1957) and thereafter under the aegis of the Regional
Spiritual Assembly (RSA) of the BaháTs of Southeast Asia (1957-
1963).49 As part of the Indian Assembly, it was treated very much like an
appendage, India being too far removed physically to respond quickly to
local needs and conditions. As a result, many of the administrative
decisions had to be decided on the spot by members of the LSA of
Singapore. The formation of the RSA in 1957 ensured a more coherent
and responsiveframeworkfor the administering of the Faith as its nine
annually elected members were drawn from people who actually lived in
the region, some of whom were born there. Some of the "local-born" RSA
members included Yankee Leong, R. Sauragan and Leong Tat Chee of the
Malayan Peninsula.50

While under the aegis of both the NSA of India and the RSA of
Southeast Asia, the Singapore BaháT community was not regarded as a
distinct national community of Southeast Asia. In fact, Singapore was
administered as part of the Malayan BaháT community.51 This was in line
with the political situation at that time. Being under the same colonial
power as the peninsula of Malaya and separated only by a causeway of
less than a mile, it was administratively convenient to treat the tiny island
of Singapore as such. In 1963, Singapore also became, politically, a part
of Malaysia.52

\[49\] In April 1955, the Guardian of the Baha'i Faith announced to the world that the NSA
of India had been given the responsibility of seeing to the formation of the RSA of SEA
by Ridvan 1957, with its seat in Jakarta.

\[50\] However, it had only a six-year mandate in which to strengthen the local assemblies
of the various countries of Southeast Asia so that they would eventually be independent
enough to elect and run National Assemblies of their own. It was dissolved when the
NSAs of Malaysia, Indonesia, Vietnam, Thailand and the Philippines came into being
in 1964.

\[51\] It was only in the late sixties, following the political separation of Singapore from
Malaysia in 1965, that there was a clear rationale for Singapore to have its own
National Spiritual Assembly

Then, the political map of "Malaysia" included Singapore, Sabah, Sarawak and
Malaya.
38                THE SINGAPORE BAHA'I STUDIES REVIEW

Members of the Singapore community had no problems identifying
themselves closely with events taking place on the Peninsula.53 From the
very beginning, the LSA of Singapore participated in Baha'i events across
the Causeway, as would the Malaysian Baha'is in events organised by the
Singapore community. Believers from both countries helped in each
other's teaching or administrative goals. In 1957, the first summer school
organised by the RS A was held "to give believers the opportunity to fully
acquaint themselves more thoroughly with aspects of Baha'i scripture."54
This was held in Malacca and attracted believers from as far away as
Penang, Singapore and Sarawak. In addition, believers from Singapore
were members of the National Teaching Committee (NTC) which came
into existence in 1961 when the RSA decided it was necessary to have a
specialised body to co-ordinate all the teaching activities in Malaya.55

Travel from Singapore to Malaya and vice versa was easily
facilitated via train or road. The very first such journey was attempted by
Mrs. Shirin Fozdar in December 1953. As Secretary of the LSA of
Singapore, Mrs. Fozdar wrote to Yankee Leong, an acquaintance she had
met at the 1949 Pacifist Conference which took place in Shantiniketan, in
India,56 to try to organise a one-week lecture tour for her to teach the
Baha'i Faith. Yankee organised a lecture tour which took Mrs. Fozdar to
Seremban, Kuala Lumpur and Malacca for three weeks in December

1953. The talk in Malacca was particularly successful with over three
hundred presents. It was presided over by the well-known Chinese scholar
and politician, Dato Tan Cheng Lock. Yankee himself became so
impressed with the principles of the Faith that he declared himself a
believer on the day the tour ended. As the first believer of Peninsula
Malaya, he was mainly responsible for spreading the Faith in Seremban,
Malacca and Kuala Lumpur soon after and for helping the infant believers

\[54\] Summer schools were basically stay-in affairs held within the space of a few days.

\[55\] In the early years, the National Teaching Committee (NTC) activities were
centralised in Malacca where most of the active believers resided.

bring together Mahatma Gandhi and his followers in India, and the pacifist of Western
countries, into a world-wide movement on non-violence (See Ong,Uncle Yankee)
form their respective Local Spiritual Assemblies in 1955. Like the early
Chinese believers of Singapore, many of the early believers of Malaya
were English-speaking and camefromthe Theosophical Society. In 1954
and 1955, the LS A of Singapore took the responsibility to help Yankee set
up the infant communities of Malaya by periodically sending some of its
members on teaching trips on a temporary basis to Seremban, Kuala
Lumpur and Malacca.57

Singapore on its own

The LSA of Singapore came into prominence for the first time in
the wider Baha'i world when it played host to the Intercontinental
Conference of 1958. This was part of five such conferences organised by
the World Center of the Baha'i Faith held throughout the world in that
year: Kampala, Uganda in January; Sydney, Australia in March;
Wilmette, Illinois in May; Frankfurt, Germany in July and Singapore in
September. They were held to commemorate the midpoint of the 10-Year
Crusade (1953-1963), a Crusade which the Guardian of the Baha'i Faith
had initiated as a means to engage the followers of Baha'u'llah in a global
missionary enterprise.58

The Conference was actually supposed to be held in Jakarta, which
was the seat of the RSA but the permit for that conference was cancelled
at the last minute by the Indonesian authorities.59 To save the situation,
the LSA of Singapore successfully applied for a permit from the British
authorities and the conference was held in Singapore at the Victoria
Memorial Hall in September, 1958. Many Baha'is from Singapore and
Malaysia were therefore exposed to what an "international" Baha'i
conference was like. They had the rare opportunity to meet in one place,
the more well known teachers and believers of the Faith, who had
journeyed from many regions to come to the conference.60 The
community became so enthused after the conference that a number of

them left to pioneer to other countries. A few years later, in 1963, a
handful of them saved a quite substantial sum of money to help charter a
plane to take them to the Baha'i World Congress in London in May
1963\.61

From its inception, the Singapore Baha'i community enjoyed good
relations with the Singapore government. The Chief Minister of Singapore
had attended the first World Religion Day in Singapore on the third
Sunday of 195662 at the Victoria Memorial Hall and had given a piece of
burial land gratis to the community. This relationship with government
leaders stood them in good stead in 1964 when the Selangor State
Assembly attempted to pass legislation which refused to recognise the
independent status of the Quadyani, Taslim, as well as the Baha'i Faith.63
This prompted the NSA of Malaysia (of which Singapore was a part) to
appoint a committee to look into the matter and to employ a lawyer to
represent the Baha'i case to the Selangor state government. Members of
this committee included members from Singapore such as Mrs. George
Lee and Mrs. Shirin Fozdar,64 who met privately with the Prime Minister,
Tengku Abdul Rahman and the Mentri Besar of Selangor, Datuk Harun,
to seek their personal assistance on the matter. This meeting was effective
for by the second parliamentary reading of the Bill, the word "Baha'i "
was dropped from the proposed legislation,65

the LSA of Singapore, was elected to the NSA of Malaysia in the first

two years of its existence (1964 and 1965). Monthly meetings were held
in Kuala Lumpur and members from all over Malaysia, including
Singapore and Sarawak, would meet there to consult on the administrative
matters of the Faith. As part of the political union of Malaysia,
Singapore believers helped implement the Malaysian NSA's Nine Year
Plan, whose twin objectives were "the widespread expansion the Cause"

and "Universal Participation". This meant helping in the establishment
of a further 179 assemblies and the opening up of another 351 localities

where BaháTs resided. Funds were also collected from Singapore

members to build the BaháT Center of Kuala Lumpur. In return, the
Singapore community received periodic visits from Malaysian Counsellor
Yankee Leong and from Auxiliary Board Members Leong Tat Chee and
Betty Moiiteiro, who would inspire the members by their talks and

presence.

This went on even after 1965 when Singapore separated itself from
the political union of Malaysia and became an independent republic. It
began to take on a separate political, social and economic identity of its
own. Singaporeans were nevertheless still considered a part of the
BaháTs of Malaysia and indeed BaháT activities in Singapore were
regularly reported in the Malaysian Nineteen-Day Newsletter. It was
however only a matter of time before the administrative situation was

Conclusion

In the first twenty years of its existence (1952-1972), the LSA of
the BaháTs of Singapore was successful in establishing a small but viable
community. It met little resistance from the governments of Singapore,
that is, the British colonial authorities, and later, the Peoples' Action
Party. The LSA's aims were peaceful and its outlook progressive and
universal. It articulated religious values and advocated social and political
mechanisms conducive to the rehabilitation of the fortunes of what
Baha'is called the "lamentably defective" world order. In fact, it enjoyed a
good relationship with the government and sought successfully the
Cupertino of the governing authorities in most of its activities. It also had
prominent BaháT teachers, including members of the Fozdar family.
While many Baha'f pioneers in other countries made no attempt to gain
publicity or newspaper coverage, to contact public officials or political
leaders; this was not the case in Singapore.78 Mrs. Shirin Fozdar together
with Mrs. George Lee deliberately courted publicity by being the foremost
advocates of the women's movement in Singapore. In this sense, the early
Singapore BaháT community was closely associated with the women's
movement and rose from obscurity on its wings. Due to such efforts, the
BaháT Faith became a household word in Singapore in the 1950's.

However, while many Singaporeans were acquainted, in a
superficial sense, with the social principles of the Faith, few were
interested in becoming members. In the period under scrutiny, the
Singapore community could not have had more than a hundred members

Communities, p. 80).

at any one time. It was also a community which was largely transient in
nature, with a significant portion of its members resettling in different
localities in the republic or in some other country. Although the
community remained small, it was nevertheless, a steadfast one, with a
significant proportion of its early believers having pioneered to other
lands,79 and contributing their expertise in the organisation of the many
international BaháT conferences held in Singapore.

The history of the Singapore community is also closely linked to
that of Malaysia. In 1953, Mrs. Fozdar taught the Faith in Malacca, and
together with Yankee Leong, was the chief instrument for the formation of
the first few LSAs in the Malay Peninsula. Together with a few other
members of the Singapore LSA, she was to make many more teaching
trips across the causeway, sometimes residing there semi-permanently.
Malaysians came down in sizeable numbers for the 1958 Intercontinental
Conference held in Singapore while Singaporeans attended the summer
schools of Malaysia, were members of various subcommittees of the NS A
of Malaysia and were featured periodically in their newsletter. In the few
years before the formation of its own NS A, Singapore received help in the
form of pioneering families and travelling teachers from Malaysia. The
early history of the BaháTs of Singapore is thus a history of two cities, its
fate intertwined in so many ways, different yet similar, together yet apart.
