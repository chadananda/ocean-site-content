A Bahá’í Perspective on the Origin of Matter

Keven Brown

Abstract
The origin of matter, according to the Bahá’í teachings, can be explained as a spiritual reality.
Although this view is not modern, modern science is also finding that at the most
fundamental level “permanent aspects of reality are not particular materials or structures but
rather the possible forms of structures, and the rules for their transformation” (Wilczek). The
Bahá’í Faith teaches that science and religion reveal complementary aspects of one truth. To
Bahá’ís, the Word of God is an actual, albeit transcendent, entity with the power to bring
physical reality into being. Its forces directly give rise to the structures and functions of
matter. The theory of the four elements, the threefold structure of being, and the necessity of
balance to life are also examined.

Résumé
Selon les enseignements bahá’ís, les origines de la matière peuvent être expliquées en tant
que réalité spirituelle. Bien que cette façon de voir ne soit pas moderne, la science moderne
est en train de découvrir qu’au niveau le plus fondamental “les aspects permanents de la
réalité ne sont pas des matières ou des structures particulières mais plutôt des formes
possibles de structures, ainsi que les règles qui régissent leur transformation” (Wilczek). La
foi bahá’íe enseigne que la science et la religion révèlent les aspects complémentaires d’une
même vérité. Pour les bahá’ís, la parole de Dieu est une entité réelle, bien que transcendante,
qui a le pouvoir de donner naissance à une réalité physique. Ses forces agissent directement
pour donner lieu aux structures et aux fonctions de la matière. Cet article examine également
la théorie des quatre éléments, la triple structure de l’être et la nécessité de l’équilibre pour la
vie.

Resumen
El origen de la materia, según las enseñanzas bahá’ís, puede explicarse como una realidad
espiritual. Aunque este punto de vista no es moderno, la ciencia moderna también está
encontrando que al nivel mas fundamental, “los aspectos permanentes de la realidad no son
materias o estructuras particulares, sino las formas posibles de las estructuras, y las reglas
para su transformación” (Wilczek). La Fe Bahá’í enseña que la ciencia y la religión revelan
aspectos complementarios de una sola verdad. Para los bahá’ís, la Palabra de Dios es una

entidad actual, ya sea trascendente, capaz de dar existencia a la realidad física. Sus fuerzas
directamente dan surgimiento a las funciones y estructuras de la materia. Se examinan
también la teoria de los cuatro elementos, la estructura tripartita de la existencia, y la
necesidad de dar balance a la vida.
It is a basic Bahá’í belief that the prophets of God are the supreme educators of humankind.
By following their teachings, especially the spiritual essentials, civilizations advance and the
fairest fruits of human nature appear. The prophets have also set forth statements in regard to
the workings of the physical universe that accord with the exigences of the age. At a time
when the Ptolemaic system was in vogue, Muhammad declared that “the sun moves in a fixed
place (mustaqarr)” (Qur’án 36:37) and implied the orbiting motion of the earth: “and each
star moves in its own heaven” (Qur’án 36:38). ‘Abdu’l-Bahá relates that these verses inspired
controversy among Muslims who wished to remain faithful to the Ptolemaic system, and they
were thus obliged to explain them away (Some Answered Questions 23). These were not new
cosmological ideas. The Greek philosophers Pythagoras, Plato, and Aristarchus had formerly
proposed a non-geocentric view of the cosmos, but this view had been forgotten.

Bahá’u’lláh, the prophet-founder of the Bahá’í Faith, has likewise revealed principles that
give a unique perspective on physical reality. Many of his statements in the area of natural
philosophy can be recognized in philosophical theories of the past, especially those of the
ancient Greeks. According to Bahá’u’lláh, most of the knowledge of “the contemporary men
of learning … hath been acquired from the sages of the past, for it is they who have laid the
foundation of philosophy, reared its structure and reinforced its pillars” (Tablets 144). As an
example, it may be noted that Socrates was the father of the dialectic procedure of
investigation, which has always been the basis of proving the validity of a theory down to our
own time. Socrates began by setting forth a proposition, or hypothesis, that could be agreed
upon to be true. The next step was to ask: “What are the consequences that follow from this
proposition?” Since truth is a coherent system, all necessary consequences following from a
hypothesis must also be true. If a consequence is found that seems to be contrary to
observable phenomena, then either the observed facts are misleading or the initial hypothesis
is false. Socrates’ successor Plato was the first to offer a geometrical model of the cosmos,
which accounted for the existence of irrational square roots. In the realm of science, proposes
the historian of science Karl R. Popper, “the Renaissance … largely meant a ‘rebirth’ of
[Plato’s] geometrical method, which was the basis of the works of Euclid, Aristarchus,
Archimedes, Copernicus, Kepler, Galileo, Descartes, Newton, Maxwell, and Einstein”
(Conjectures 89).

The philosophers were not the origin of wisdom, however. In Eastern histories, which
Bahá’u’lláh confirms, the sages are portrayed as having gained the fundamentals of their
knowledge from the prophets. “The essence and fundamentals of philosophy,” Bahá’u’lláh
asserts, “have emanated from the Prophets. That the people differ concerning the inner

meanings and mysteries thereof is to be attributed to the divergence of their views and
minds” (Tablets 145).

In his The Secret of Divine Civilization ‘Abdu’l-Bahá states that it is

> a matter of record in numerous historical works that the philosophers of Greece such
> as Pythagoras, acquired the major part of their philosophy, both divine and material,
> from the disciples of Solomon. And Socrates after having eagerly journeyed to meet
> with some of Israel’s most illustrious scholars and divines, on his return to Greece
> established the concept of the oneness of God and the continuing life of the human
> soul after it has put off its elemental dust. (Secret 77)

One of Bahá’u’lláh’s most significant Tablets in which He sets forth the principles of creation
is the Lawḥ-i-Ḥikmat (Tablet of Wisdom). In another Tablet Bahá’u’lláh advises: “Meditate
upon the Lawḥ-i-Ḥikmat; in every verse the Sea of Seas is concealed” (quoted in Ra’fatí,
‘Andalíb, 5.19:36).1 The philosopher Socrates is singled out in the Lawḥ-i-Ḥikmat as “the
most distinguished of all philosophers,” a fact to which we shall later return. In what follows,
I would like to examine in an introductory fashion the question of matter’s nature and origin
from the standpoint of this important Bahá’í text, as well as from the entire body of Bahá’í
sacred literature, and compare these teachings with observations from modern physics as well
as classical Greek philosophy and its later manifestations in Islamic thought.

It should be observed at the outset that the terminology employed herein may be unfamiliar to
many readers. Many of the terms used in Bahá’í natural philosophy to describe the
metaphysical origin of the universe come from its classical Greek and Islamic heritage. These
terms cannot always be interpreted literally in the way modern science uses words at face
value but must be understood in the context of the tradition from which they derive. For
example, Bahá’u’lláh refers to “earth,” “water,” “air,” and “fire,” but He does not intend the
every-day meanings associated with these terms. In addition, the reader should keep in mind
that when names are used to describe something, the name should not be confused with the
reality it represents. Names are labels, and labels can be changed according to the perspective
from which the reality is [sic] question is being viewed. Thus many designations often refer
to exactly the same thing.

Some may question the relevance of religion to answering questions about matter. To Bahá’ís
and to religionists in general, however, matter is the mirror in which the qualities of the spirit
are reflected. Religion has always approached the question of matter from the metaphysical
side, science from the material side, but both approaches are complementary—each is
attempting to describe an area that is associated with but not customarily the realm of the
other.

The Philosophers on What is Real
The origin of matter and the elements that compose all organic and inorganic forms in the
universe is an ancient philosophical question. In the Western tradition, the Greek
philosophers of the Ionian School (ca. 585-540 B.C.) were the first to reformulate elements of
older religious and philosophical traditions they had inherited from the Near East into a more
rationalistic cosmological system. The Ionian philosophers, such as Thales, Anaximander,
and Anaximenes, were all searching for a unique “something” that would give unity and
structure to the universe. How else could the observable orderliness of the universe be

explained unless a single unifying substance or power existed to connect all the parts?2
Because their answers tended to focus on a physical substance, they have been described as
“material monists.” Democritus of Abdera (ca. 420 B.C.), a contemporary of Socrates, carried
on the physical focus even further by proposing that only atoms (“indivisible” physical units)
and the void are real. All change was explained in terms of the rearrangement of the atoms
moving in a void. Pythagoras of Samos (ca. 530 B.C.) developed another school of thought.
Instead of a material substance serving as the unifying principle, Pythagoras proposed
numbers or abstract mathematical forms (e.g., the principle that determines all particular
triangles: a2 + b2 = c2) and in this way anticipated Plato’s eternal, non-material realities. To
the Pythagoreans, the One, from which multiplicity arises, was not a number but a polarity
consisting of both even and odd. The first number was two. Other schools offered different
perspectives. Heraclitus of Ephesos (ca. 500 B.C.) pointed not to number or substance but to
process. He saw the world as one of constant change, a process of perpetual “becoming,”
caused by the conflict of opposites. In contrast, Parmenides of Elea (ca. 470 B.C.) held that
only absolute unchanging Being exists; movement and change must therefore be sense-
perception delusions.3

According to Theo Gerard Sinnige, the various philosophical developments of the pre-
Socratic Greek philosophers are first brought together in a coherent system in Plato’s
Timaeus. The earlier theories, save that of Pythagoras, remained limited by a dependence
upon spatial dimension. “It was Plato,” proposes Sinnige, “who found the first principles and
who developed a fully metaphysical and abstract method of thinking, the concepts of which
were valid for both material and immaterial Being” (Matter and Infinity 109). To Plato, the
immaterial realm of unchanging Ideas, in other words, the spiritual world, is real and
permanent. The material world only exists as an evanescent and changing copy of the former.
This material world, therefore, is not an illusion, but neither is it absolute and unchanging;
rather it has a quasi-existence. In the Timaeus the universe is described as eternally young
and spherical in form. God, the master Craftsman, fashioned the cosmos as a perfect living
being, of which the component parts are also living and perfect beings. Just as in the human
reality the soul works through its power called mind to organize and rule the functions of the

body, so does the body of the cosmos possess a “World-Soul” and a Nous, i.e., the Universal
Mind that keeps the universe a well-ordered whole and arranges things in the best manner
possible. A human being as the microcosm that corresponds in every respect to the
macrocosm is fundamental to this line of thought.

The Timaeus contains metaphysical and cosmological doctrines that are helpful to
understanding the Bahá’í teachings on creation. The most important of these doctrines is the
Theory of Forms, or Ideas, which is most successfully reconciled with the existence of
sensible things in the Timaeus. This theory shall be

examined more fully later in the article. At this point, it is important to consider the question
of whether the origin of this theory, which is basic to all of Plato’s thought, should really be
attributed to Socrates, rather than to Plato. In the Lawḥ-i-Ḥikmat, Bahá’u’lláh mentions an
“exposition” by Socrates that discusses the theme of “a pervasive nature in things, bearing the
closest likeness to the human spirit, and … distinct from the substance of things in their
refined form” (Tablets 146). In my opinion, there is little doubt that Bahá’u’lláh is here
referring to the Theory of Forms. But where is this particular exposition to be found?

As far as is known, Socrates never wrote down any of his theories; therefore, what we know
of his teachings must be gleaned secondhand from the writings of others, especially those of
Plato, where Socrates often appears as a principal speaker in the dialogues. It is from his
dialogue in Plato’s Phaedo that we learn of Socrates’ use of the dialectic method of debate
and his teachings on the immortality of the soul. It is likewise in the Phaedo that Socrates
first discourses comprehensively upon the reality of the world of Forms, which he uses as an
important proof for the indestructibility of the human spirit. By virtue of its likeness to the
Forms, Socrates proclaims that the human spirit is of an imperishable, non-composite nature
and is therefore everlasting. Socrates was, above all else, concerned with proper human
conduct, and he strove to demonstrate that universal moral principles (Forms) exist which are
changeless and that our earthly attempts to reflect them are only approximations. For
example, no matter how just we regard someone’s action, we are able to imagine a more just
act.

Historians are in agreement that the influence of Socrates upon Plato was immense. W. K. C.
Guthrie in A History of Greek Philosophy sums up the opinion of many: “In the dialogues,
there is no need to emphasize the fact that Plato’s chief inspiration for the greater part of his
life was Socrates” (4:33). The extent of Socrates’ influence upon Plato’s thought, however, is

a source of debate. J. Burnet and A. E. Taylor believe that the Platonic Socrates of the
dialogues is clearly Plato’s recollection of the historical Socrates, but not all historians of
Greek philosophy endorse this view. Bahá’u’lláh concurs with the Burnett-Taylor hypothesis
when He ascribes an exposition to the historical Socrates that may only be found among the
writings of Plato. The exposition that Bahá’u’lláh refers to in the Lawḥ-i-Ḥikmat is most
likely Socrates’ dialogue on the Forms in the Phaedo. However, to obtain a fuller
understanding of this theory in relation to the coming-to-be of things, we must turn to the
section of the Timaeus called “The Work of Necessity.” The term “necessity” refers to
Plato’s “natural receptacle of all bodies,” the essential and passive counterpart of the Forms,
without which physical entities cannot exist.

Plato puts the words of this discourse into the mouth of a person called Timaeus of Locri,
about whom we lack any historical information. Cornford, in his commentary on the
Timaeus, believes that “the very fact that a man of such distinction has left not the faintest
trace in political or philosophic history is against his claim to be a real person” (Plato’s
Cosmology 3). It is more likely that the Timaeus represents a Pythagorean-Socratic-Platonic
synthesis in which Plato attempts to harmonize the seeming incompatibility of the universal
principles to

their particular expressions in sensory experience. Alternatively, however, it is possible that
Timaeus was one of the philosophers of the Hermetic School who are often lamented upon
for their lack of historic visibility. Antiochus of Athens (ca. first century B.C.) referred to an
“earlier interpreter of Hermes called Timaeus” (Fowden, The Egyptian Hermes 3n).

Aristotle was perplexed with the Theory of Forms and no doubt dissatisfied with Plato’s
explanation in the Timaeus. But Aristotle was not a mathematician. Had he read the
inscription that Plato placed above the entrance to the academy: “Nobody untrained in
geometry may enter my house”? Aristotle wanted to define the relationship of Forms to their
sensible expressions: “Is what we call a sensible thing merely a temporary assemblage of
Forms, or ‘universals’, and if it is more, what else is it?” (Taylor, Socrates 170). Aristotle
concluded that the Theory of Forms was “a mistaken attempt to separate the ‘universal
characters’ of individual sensible things from the things themselves, and then to set up these
‘abstractions’ as a second set of super-sensible things which somehow produce the things we
see and handle” (Taylor, Socrates 171). Aristotle then put forward his own hypothesis: that
the Form is only the essential character of a physical thing and is inseparable from it.

The Hermetic philosophers, those who claimed to be following the teachings of Hermes,
maintained, like Plato, that all temporal things consist of both gross matter and a subtle
counterpart, the latter being the lasting and essential part. Since Bahá’u’lláh refers to the
significance of the Hermetic texts in the Lawḥ-i-Ḥikmat, I shall digress here briefly to
elucidate their background. The common belief about these writings in the Roman Empire, a
view that continued to the end of the sixteenth century, was that they were derived from an

even earlier time from the prophet-philosopher Hermes and became the basis of the theories
of some of the Greek philosophers. The philosopher Iamblichus (d.ca. A.D. 330) wrote: “If
you propose some difficulty in philosophy, we’ll settle it according to the ancient stélai of
Hermes that Plato and Pythagoras read in entirety and from which they constituted their
philosophy” (quoted in Lindsay, The Origins of Alchemy in Graeco-Roman Egypt 107).
Ficino and other Renaissance Platonists thought Hermes might be a contemporary of Moses.
As a historical figure, however, Hermes is veiled in almost total obscurity. Accounts of his
origin are numerous and widely divergent. Modern scholarship places the composition of the
extant philosophical Hermetica in the period from the late first to the late third centuries A.D.
and some of the extant technical Hermetica somewhat earlier (Fowden, The Egyptian Hermes
and Scott, Hermetica, vol. 1). Fowden notes that the collection of Hermetica that has come
down to us from the period mentioned above was “the product of an evolutionary process,
since its individual constituent parts were also altered in the course of transmission.… And,
conversely, extraneous material might be introduced into the tradition” (The Egyptian
Hermes 9).

Most modern scholars of the Hermetica propose, contrary to the tradition of antiquity, that the
name “Hermes” was primarily used as a pseudonym, borrowed from legend, by Hellenistic
writers of the Roman Empire to provide an

aura of sacred authenticity to their writings, the essence of which they derived largely from
Plato along with Stoic influences and to which they gave Egyptian overtones. Bahá’u’lláh,
however, follows the traditional account. In one of his Tablets, He writes: “The first person
who devoted himself to philosophy was Idrís. Thus was he named. Some called him also
Hermes. In every tongue he hath a special name. He it is who hath set forth in every branch
of philosophy thorough and convincing statements” (Tablets 148n)

In regard to the other names of Hermes, he was thought to be the Thoth of the Egyptians,
Enoch to the Hebrews, Hushang to the Zoroastrians, and Idrís to the Muslims (Qur’án 19:57-
58). Muslims also called Hermes Abu’l-Ḥukamá’ (Father of the Philosophers), because they
considered him to be the origin of sophia, or wisdom. Seyyed Hossein Nasr states that “early
Shi`ism in general was more sympathetic to [the Hermetic] teachings” but, in time, they
attained such an influence in Islam that “Hermeticism must be considered as one of the most
important factors which aided in the construction of the Muslim world view” (Islamic Studies
71, 76).

The Hermetic philosophers, Nasr says, “sought a particular cause for each particular effect
and chose an ‘experimental’ and concrete method much closer to that of the Stoics than the
Aristotelians” (Islamic Studies 75). That this approach, and the Hermetic philosophy in
general, appealed to many is demonstrated by the impact that Hermeticism has made in the
development of scientific and philosophical thought over the ages. It strongly influenced such
figures as Jábir ibn Ḥayyán, ar-Rází, the Ikhwán aṣ-Ṣafá’, and Ibn Síná in Islam; and

Raymond Lull, Roger Bacon, Ficino, Paracelcus, and Bruno, among others, in the West, not
to mention Isaac Newton and Robert Boyle in the seventeenth century. In regard to Newton,
Betty Jo Teeter Dobbs in her work The Foundations of Newton’s Alchemy demonstrates that
“it was precisely by the route of alchemy [a Hermetic science] and transmutation that Sir
Isaac expected to elucidate ‘the ultimate component parts of matter’”(9), and it was through
his particular resolution of the matter-spirit conflict “that Newton’s new concept of force was
born” (193).

The neo-Platonic philosopher Plotinus in the third century A.D. renewed Plato’s emphasis on
the ideal realm. He proposed that all beings emanate from God like waves moving outward in
concentric circles from a common center. Matter is only the outermost sphere of the ideal,
where the emanation of light gives way to darkness.

Other philosophers have proposed that matter and spirit are irreconcilable realities, neither
one able to approach the sphere of the other. Descartes (d. A.D. 1650) concluded that matter
has no relationship to spirit, the latter being absent in the operations of the universe. In the
twentieth century, the terminology has changed, but the questions are the same. “We still find
ourselves asking what is the ‘status’ of ‘scientific objects’. Just what are the things of which
the mathematician and the physicist discourse?” (Taylor, Socrates 171). And scientists today,
like their Greek predecessors, are looking for a single “unified” theory that would reconcile
the amazing discoveries of relativity

and quantum mechanics to explain the order of the cosmos. What insights on these questions
are offered in the Bahá’í writings?

The Primal Will
To answer such questions we must begin with that which is the First Cause of everything
else. In the Lawḥ-i-Ḥikmat Bahá’u’lláh states that the “Word of God … is the Cause of the
entire creation, while all else besides His Word are but the creatures and the effects thereof”
(Tablets 140). This Word “transcendeth the limitations of known elements and is exalted
above all the essential and recognized substances. It became manifest without any syllable or
sound and is none but the Command of God which pervadeth all created things. It hath never
been withheld from the world of being” (Tablets 141). A common synonym for the Word of
God in the Bahá’í writings is the Primal Will.

The Bahá’í Faith teaches that God is the Creator of all things but is not their Cause. The word
cause implies a dependency with the effects in the same way that the attribute of knowledge,
in the realm of creation, requires the existence of objects of knowledge. Even the term
Creator requires its counterpart, the created, in order to be comprehensible. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá
gives this explanation:

As to the attributes and perfections such as will, knowledge, power and other ancient
> attributes that we ascribe to that Divine Reality, these are the signs that reflect the
> existence of beings in the visible plane and not the absolute perfections of the Divine
> Essence that cannot be comprehended. For instance, as we consider created things we
> observe infinite perfections, and the created things being in the utmost regularity and
> perfection we infer that the Ancient Power on whom dependeth the existence of these
> beings, cannot be ignorant; thus we say He is All-Knowing. It is certain that it is not
> impotent, it must be then All-Powerful.… The purpose is to show that these attributes
> and perfections that we recount for that Universal Reality are only in order to deny
> imperfections, rather than to assert the perfections that the human mind can conceive.

Thus we say His attributes are unknowable. (Bahá’í World Faith 342-43)

God, therefore, exists completely outside the order of creation. In the Timaeus, Plato’s divine
Craftsman likewise exists separately from the universe He fashions. The station of the
Creator of all things as He exists in Himself is portrayed in verses such as this: “‘God was
alone; there was none else besides Him.’ He, now, is what He hath ever been” (Bahá’u’lláh,
Gleanings 192). In the Lawḥ-i-Ḥikmat this station is referred to as the “hidden treasure.”
Bahá’u’lláh affirms that “this is a station that can never be described nor even alluded to”
(Tablets 140). The expression comes from this famous Islamic Tradition (ḥadíth qudsí) about
God: “I was a Hidden Treasure and loved to be known; therefore did I bring the creation into
being.” It is a theme that is often repeated in Bahá’í scriptures. For example, in this prayer
Bahá’u’lláh says:

> Lauded be Thy name, O Lord my God! I testify that Thou wast a hidden Treasure
> wrapped within Thine immemorial Being and an impenetrable Mystery enshrined in
> Thine own Essence. Wishing to reveal Thyself, Thou didst call into being the Greater
> and the Lesser Worlds [the world hereafter and this world], and didst choose Man
> above all Thy creatures, and didst make Him a sign of both of these worlds.…
> (Prayers and Meditations 48-49)

God’s “desire” to be known is fulfilled when human beings fulfill their purpose for being: to
know and worship God. To fulfill this purpose they must first recognize the prophet of God
for the age in which they live as their true educator, and then strive to apply in their lives all
that has been revealed by the Pen of God’s prophet. According to the Bahá’í teachings,
knowledge of the prophet is, for humankind, the knowledge of God, and attainment to the
prophet is attainment to “the presence of God,” because human beings, limited creatures, are
incapable to fathoming, or attaining to, the Supreme Essence. Human beings may also
recognize the signs and evidences of God in the perfection of his creation.

God’s act of wishing to reveal Himself is identical with the outpouring of the Primal Will
from God’s Essence. It is a timeless act, without beginning or end. In this station, Bahá’u’lláh
explains, “God was, and His creation had ever existed beneath His shelter from the beginning

that hath no beginning, apart from its being preceded by a Firstness which cannot be regarded
as firstness…” (Tablets 140). The term “Firstness” in the above verse is another synonym for
the Word of God and the Primal Will. The Primal Will has a priority to creation in the same
way that fire has a priority to heat. But they are inseparable from each other; creation is the
necessary property of the Will. In fact, Bahá’u’lláh says in the Lawḥ-i-Ḥikmat, “Nature is
God’s Will and is its expression (ẓuhúr) in and through the contingent world” (Tablets 142).4
The Will’s numberless manifestations or appearances (ẓuhúrát), which constitute nature, like
the waves upon a sea, are “diversified by varying causes” (Tablets 142).

The Báb explains that what first emanates from God, i.e., the Primal Will, must be single and
unique, otherwise it could not demonstrate the unity of God (from the Súriy-i-Tawḥíd cited in
Nicholas, Le Béyan Arabe 26-27). The Word of God is not part of God in the same sense that
rays emanating from the sun are not parts broken off from it. The Word emanates from God
like a discourse emanates from a speaker.5 Despite its transcendent station, the Word of God
is a contingent reality; it depends upon God for its existence (cf. Some Answered Questions
203 on the Primal Will). However, God’s Word is immeasurably exalted above any physical
property or substance, for the worlds of existence, both material and spiritual, come into
being as its effects. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá states:
> 4. Zuhúr may also be translated as visible aspect, appearance, manifestation.
5. This is also the Hermetic view. “Mind [i.e., the Universal Mind] then is not severed

> from the substantiality of God, but is, so to speak, spread abroad from the source, as
> the light of the sun is spread abroad” (Libellus 12:1 in Scott, Hermetica).

> The truth is that the reality of the Sanctified Essence cannot descend into the world of
> creation. . . . In the height of sanctity He subsists holy and exalted above all
> characteristics, specifications, and individualizations; ever beyond the understanding

> rays of the sun, which is the cause of the manifestation and appearance of beings. This
> is the truth and naught lieth beyond the truth but error. (Makátíb 3:358)6

In the exordium to the Tafsír-i-Súriy-i-Va’sh-Shams, Bahá’u’lláh likewise affirms, as He does
in many other Tablets, that the Primal Will of God upraises creation: “Verily, no God is there
save Him, Who hath created the universe and fashioned all things by the agency of his Primal
Will, the cause of all that hath been and shall be” (Alwáḥ 2).7 In the Hermetica we find: “God
makes by his will the very existence of all things” (Libellus 10:3-4a).8 The Báb points out
that the cause of the existence of the Primal Will is its own self. This is so because there can
be no phenomenal connection between God and his creation, in the sense of the divine
Essence becoming a place of change. If this were so, argues the Báb, then before God created
the existences He was necessarily in one state, and, afterwards, in another state, and this is
impossible for the Supreme Being (from Súriy-i-Tawḥíd cited in Nicholas, Le Béyan Arabe).

The Primal Will is identified in the Bahá’í writings with the Universal Mind, or First
Intellect, of the ancient philosophers (Some Answered Questions 203), and it is the all-
embracing power present in the Manifestations of God.9 “It is this Primal Will,” explains the
Báb, “which appeareth resplendent in every Prophet and speaketh forth in every revealed
Book. It knoweth no beginning, inasmuch as the First deriveth its firstness from It; and
knoweth no end, for the Last oweth its lastness unto It” (Selections 126).

In a Tablet on the opinions of the Sufis, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá states that, according to the Bahá’ís,
“existence has three degrees: God, Command (which is the Primal Will), and creation. The
Primal Will ... is the inner reality of things, and all existing things are its manifestations
(mazáhir), not manifestations of the divine Reality and Identity” (Makátíb 3:356).10 ‘Abdu’l-
Bahá is here refuting the pantheistic belief of the Sufis that God Himself is the inner reality of
things, the essence of his own creation. These three degrees are also explained in Some

and images of the Primal Will. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá relates: “The Báb, may my life be a sacrifice
unto Him, saith that the intention of this verse: ‘The sea is the same sea it hath ever been from
eternity and the contingent phenomena (al-ḥawádith) are its waves and images’, is fulfilled in
the Primal Will, not in the Essence of God” (Makátíb, 3:356).11

In another Tablet ‘Abdu’l-Bahá compares the Primal Will to a sea: “The world of Command
is the station of the Primal Will which is a universal reality that is resolved (munḥall) into
infinite forms. The sea of the Will is the world of Command” (A World Faith 22). The sea of
the Will is also known as the sea of God’s (created) names and attributes, which are
equivalent to the Forms of Plato. The true or essential attributes of God, as have been
mentioned, are unknowable. It is to the created names and attributes of God, which in their
totality are identical to the Primal Will, that ‘Abdu’l-Bahá refers in this passage:

> The names and attributes of Divinity are requirements of this world.... Therefore, all
> the names and attributes of God require the existence of objects or creatures upon

which they have been bestowed and in which they have become manifest.... [These]

> emanate from the eternal attributes of Divinity. Therefore, it is proved that the divine
> names presuppose the existence of objects or beings. (Promulgation 219)

Bahá’u’lláh also reveals the created nature of the names we apply to God. In The Hidden
Words, speaking for God, Bahá’u’lláh says: “O SON OF MAN! My eternity is My creation, I
have created it for thee. Make it the garment of thy temple. My unity is My handiwork; I have
wrought it for thee; clothe thyself therewith, that thou mayest be to all eternity the revelation
of My everlasting being” (18-19). Bahá’u’lláh continues: “My majesty is My gift to thee, and
My grandeur the token of My mercy unto thee. That which beseemeth Me none shall
understand, nor can anyone recount” (19).

‘Abdu’l-Bahá refers above to these names in the plural, but in reality they are one essence.
They are facets of the one reality that emanates from God. Sometimes this reality is called
Love, because it is the source of all ardor and attraction; sometimes Spirit, because it is the
inner reality and highest aspect of all things; sometimes Truth, because it is the point to
which all knowledge returns, and in like manner with all the divine names. These creative
names and attributes are paralleled in the Bahá’i writings by the expression al-a`yán ath-
thábitah, which may be translated “the eternal archetypes” or “the causal essences.” It is a
term borrowed from the mystic philosophy of Ibn ‘Arabí. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá explains that the
independent existence of the archetypes is relative as in the notion that east and west, north
and south are fixed (thabút), but they have no existence in themselves. (Makátíb 3:356).

In the vision of Hermes called The Poimandres, he witnesses the Universal Mind, which he
also calls the Light. Then, says Hermes. “I saw in my mind that the Light consisted of
innumerable Powers, and had come to be an ordered world, but a world without bounds.” To
Hermes, the Mind then explains: “You have seen in your mind the archetypal form, which is
prior to the beginning of things, and is limitless” (Libellus 1:7-8a).

Form and Substance
How do things come into being from the Primal Will? The Primal Will and the Word of God
are also synonymous with God’s Command (amr), which is the word “Be” (kun). Bahá’u’lláh
says, in a Tablet addressed to the celebrated Aḥmad, “He [God] it is Who hath created all that
is in the heavens and on the earth by the word of his Command, which He hath designated as
the ‘B’ before the ‘E’” (quoted in Ra’fatí, ‘Andalíb 5.19:29).12 These two letters symbolize
two principles inherent in the Primal Will that make all subtle and material manifestation

possible. According to the Báb, they represent God’s Will (mashíyyat) and Purpose (irádih)
respectively. He says: “through the ‘B’ God created the substance of all things and through
the ‘E’ God created the form of all things” (quoted in Afnán, Áhang-i-Badí’ 24.5-6:126).13
‘Abdu’l-Bahá explains in his Tafsír-i-Kuntu Kanzan Makhfíyyan (Commentary on the
Tradition “I was a Hidden Treasure ... ) that form and substance arise simultaneously and that
they are interdependent. In setting forth the viewpoints of certain mystic knowers on this
matter, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá states:

> They have said that the potentialities (qábiliyyát) and the recipients of the
> potentialities (maqbúlát) came into being and were created simultaneously. For
> example, it has been stated that all things are composed of two elements: the
> ‘Fashioner’ (qábil) and the ‘Fashioned’ (maqbúl). By ‘Fashioned’ is meant substance
> (mádda) and primary matter (huyúlá), and by ‘Fashioner’ is meant form and shape,
> which confines and limits the primary matter from its state of indefiniteness and
> freedom to the courtyard of limitation and definite form. (Makátíb 2:35).14

One of the Hermetic texts repeats the same theme: “All things are but two, that which is made
and that which makes. And the one cannot be separated from the other; the Maker cannot
exist apart from the thing made, nor the thing made apart from the Maker” (Libellus 14:5).

Titus Burckhardt, in chapter four of his book Alchemy: Science of the Cosmos, Science of the
Soul, gives a masterly exposition on the meaning of these two principles, which we may term
form and substance, or spirit and primary matter respectively. He likens them to the two
Hands of God that artistically

fashion all things with beauty and perfection. They are the active and passive poles of
existence. beyond all visible manifestation. This non-material matter “is not something
separated from spirit, but its necessary complement. In itself it is no more than the
potentiality of taking on form, and all perceptible objects in it bear the stamp of its active
counterpart, the Spirit or Word of God” (Alchemy 58-59). The primordial substance has also
been described as the mirror in which qualities become visible. To the Pythagoreans, these
two principles are the even and the odd concealed in the One that precedes multiplicity.

As ‘Abdu’l-Bahá has explained above, the two principles of existence arise simultaneously
and are interdependent. Burckhardt continues:

> Wholly ‘formless’ matter can neither be represented nor imagined, for it is a pure
> potentiality (that of taking on form) and has in itself no discernible characteristics
> whatsoever. It can only be known at all in its relationship with ‘form’. Even form,
> however, cannot be represented as separate from matter, for every form which has
> been revealed already takes part in materia, and this applies also even for an imagined
> form. (Alchemy 62)

The non-material matter, or materia prima, of the universe is purely passive with regard to its
form-giving counterpart. In the Bible it is symbolized by the waters over which the Spirit of
God moved at the beginning of creation. The active pole contains the “essential
predeterminations of things . . . as ‘prototypes’ or ‘archetypes’” (Alchemy 65).

Bahá’u’lláh, in the Lawḥ-i-Ḥikmat, refers to the two principles inherent in the Primal Will in
these terms: al-fá`il, the active force, and al-munfa`il, its recipient.15 All created things in the
universe reflect the primal polarity, as evidenced by our complementary adjectives male and
female, positive and negative, hot and cold, light and dark, and the like. These opposites are
not independent from each other. Each requires the other to be known: In this world, we
know light by its contrast to darkness; we know love by its contrast to hate; we know justice
by its contrast to injustice. Thus Socrates asks: “Between the members of every pair of
opposites, since they are two, aren’t there two processes of coming-to-be, from one to the
other, and back again from the latter to the former?” (Phaedo 71a-b). In other words, the
realm of becoming requires the existence of contraries. Change or motion is the evidence of
the strife of opposites, and their temporary harmony in nature is, according to Bahá’u’lláh,
through God’s absolute power (Má’idiy-i-Ásmání 1:46).

Bahá’u’lláh calls that which first results from the active force and its recipient, prior (in the
sense of priority, not time) to the generation of the world, al-fá`ilayn,
15. In one of his Tablets ‘Abdu’l-Bahá explains the story of Adam and Eve as a metaphor

> for the active force and its recipient: “‘Adam’ signifieth that reality which is
> pervasive, effulgent and active, that is the manifestation of God’s Names and
> Attributes, and the evidences of His mercy. Whereas ‘Eve’ is that reality which is the

> Nakhjavani, Response 72).

the twin active agents, and al-munfa`ilayn, the twin passive agents, and affirms that they “are
indeed created through the irresistible Word of God” (Tablets 140).16 In other Tablets He
identifies them with the four elements.17

Through the interaction of the active force and its recipient a heat is generated that causes all
motion in the universe. In Bahá’u’lláh’s words: “The world of existence came into being
through the heat (al-ḥarárat) generated from the interaction between the active force and that
which is its recipient. These two are the same, yet they are different” (Tablets 140). In
another Tablet He again refers to the heat: “O Amín, the cause of motion (ḥarakah) hath ever
been heat, and the cause of heat is the Word of God” (quoted in Ra’fatí, ‘Andalíb 5.19:36).18
In another Tablet He says: “In truth, it is the active force through which the world of creation
is raised up. It is the heat without which there would be no motion” (Má’idiy-i-Ásmání
4:80).19 It seems from this that heat is intrinsically part of the active force, but interaction
with the recipient is needed to manifest its effect. “Heat,” used in this context, cannot be
ordinary heat, which is only an exterior thing. Perhaps life-ordering energy would be a better
way to describe it.

The Non-Material Ether
In one of his Tablets ‘Abdu’l-Bahá interprets what Bahá’u’lláh has intended by the two terms
al-fá`il and al-munfa`il in the Lawḥ-i-Ḥikmat. He explains that

> the substance and primary matter of contingent beings is the ethereal power, which is
> invisible and only known through its effects, such as electricity, heat, and light—these
> are vibrations of that power, and this is established and proven in natural philosophy
> and is known as the ethereal substance (máddíy-i-athíríyyih). This ethereal substance
> is itself both the active force and the recipient; in other words, it is the sign of the
> Primal Will in the phenomenal world.... The ethereal substance is, therefore, the cause
> since light, heat, and electricity appear from it. It is also the effect, for as vibrations
> take place in it, they become visible. For instance, light is a vibration occurring in that
> ethereal substance. (Má’idiy-i-Ásmání 2:69)20

This passage suggests why Bahá’u’lláh refers to the active force and its recipient as the same,
yet different: they are the polar aspects of the ethereal substance, which is both spirit and
non-material matter. The ethereal substance, as set forth by ‘Abdu’l-Bahá in Some Answered
Questions, “is an intellectual reality and is not sensible ... ” (84).21 Electricity, heat, and
light—and likewise

subatomic particles—are vibrations of that intellectual substance. Plato’s theory for the
appearance of the perceptible qualities, discussed later, differs slightly from this conclusion
on one point. He proposes that perceptible qualities are vibrations or forces that occur by the
medium of an intellectual substance; they are not actually vibrations of it. These statements
from the Bahá’i writings are analogous to similar statements in contemporary physics
regarding the nature of matter.22

Matter as Perceived by Modern Physics
There are many books available on the new paradigm in physics. Gary Zukav’s The Dancing
Wu Li Masters has stirred up controversy among physicists. However, he explains well the
paradox of why we cannot really answer the question: “What is it made of?”

> The answer to such a question is always another something to which we can apply the
> same question. Suppose, for example, that we ask of an ordinary toothpick, “What is
> it made of?” The answer, of course, is “wood.” However, the question itself has taken

> turned out to be patterns of subatomic particles. In other words, “matter” is actually a
> series of patterns out of focus. The search for the ultimate stuff of the universe ends
> with the discovery that there isn’t any. (193)

Further on Zukav describes the three distinguishing characteristics of subatomic particles:
mass, charge (positive or negative), and spin. In regard to the third characteristic, he says:

> Subatomic particles spin about a theoretical kind of axis like a spinning top. One big
> difference between a spinning top and a spinning particle, however, is that a top can
> spin either faster or slower, but a subatomic particle always spins at exactly the same

> electron.... If the spin of a particle is altered, the particle in question is changed so
> fundamentally that it no longer can be considered an electron, or a proton. or whatever
> it was before we altered its spin. This makes us wonder whether all of the different
> “particles” might be just different states of motion of some underlying structure or
> substance. This is the basic question of particle physics. (207)

Zukav’s emphasis is on the ultimate non-substantiality of physical reality. “The angular
momentum of a subatomic particle is fixed, definite, and known,”
22. The abstract source of matter is also mentioned by Shoghi Effendi in a letter written

> by him to an individual believer (18 February 1930): “The essence of existence is a
> spiritual reality because invisible forces of the spirit are the origin of matter and the
> foundation thereof.”

he continues. Then quoting physicist Max Born, “‘But ... one should not imagine that there is
anything in the nature of matter actually rotating’. Said another way, the ‘spin’ of a
subatomic particle involves ‘The idea of a spin without the existence of something spinning’
... ” (208). According to physicist Frank Wilczek, in the new paradigm of physics “the
permanent aspects of reality are not particular materials or structures but rather the possible
forms of structures, and the rules for their transformation” (Longing for the Harmonies 70).

Physicist David Bohm, author of Wholeness and the Implicate Order, presents a theory that
discloses a realm strikingly similar to that of Plato’s. His “implicate order” is the underlying
reality of the universe, possessed of energy, information. content, form, and structure, in
short, the potential of everything, but it unfolds externally as space-time, or the “explicate
order.” The implicate order is one of unbroken, non-localized wholeness, which Bohm
compares to generalized light (not just visible light). In light itself there is no distance; all
points are simultaneously present—an implication of the principle of special relativity: it is
impossible to change the speed of light by one’s motion. Particles, Bohm says, appear at the
intersection of many light rays; they are “ripples on this vast ocean of light” (Revision
6\.1:37).

Socrates’ Discovery
These statements from modern physics are consonant with the idea that the motion (ḥarakah)
generated from the heat of the active agent in interaction with its recipient is the most that the
best physical instruments will allow us to perceive. In other words, we cannot directly
perceive the active force and its recipient, only the effects of their interaction. Physical
reality, from this standpoint, is fundamentally a complex manifold of various states of motion
or vibration. The term motion, used here, may be a blanket term that covers other properties
of subatomic phenomena such as mass, charge, and spin. The ethereal substance itself, which
is the universal medium for these vibrations and motions, belongs to the realm of the mind. It
may be that this is what Bahá’u’lláh, in the Lawḥ-i-Ḥikmat, said Socrates discerned in things,
bearing a resemblance to the human spirit. Bahá’u’lláh relates:

> Methinks he [Socrates] drank one draught when the Most Great Ocean overflowed
> with gleaming and life-giving waters. He it is who perceived a unique, a tempered,
> and a pervasive nature in things, bearing the closest likeness to the human spirit, and
> he discovered this nature to be distinct from the substance of things in their refined

form. He hath a special pronouncement on this weighty theme. Wert thou to ask from
> the worldly wise of this generation about this exposition, thou wouldst witness their
> incapacity to grasp it. (Tablets 146-47)

Although it was pointed out earlier that the exposition Bahá’u’lláh is referring to was
probably in the Phaedo, the following words in Plato’s Timaeus are more instructive on how
the Forms (spirit) produce, and yet are distinct from, physical beings (gross matter). The
important thing is that the theory, in origin, belongs to Socrates, if Bahá’u’lláh’s words above
are to be meaningful.

Plato begins by introducing a third factor:

> We must start our new description of the universe by making a fuller subdivision than
> we did before; we then distinguished two forms of reality—we must now add a third.
> Two were enough at an earlier stage, when we postulated on the one hand an

This passage is full of allusions significant to understanding the process of creation from a
traditional perspective. The “natural receptacle of all bodies” corresponds to the passive pole
of the ethereal substance mentioned by ‘Abdu’l-Bahá. It is, as was already stated, an
intellectual reality and therefore eternal and on the same plane as the human spirit. ‘Abdu’l-
Bahá affirms that “the rational soul is the substance through which the body exists” (Some
Answered Questions 240). The active pole of the ethereal substance corresponds to what
Plato describes above as the “eternal realities,” i.e., the Forms. In the Bahá’í writings these
are referred to as the eternal archetypes (al-a`yán ath-thábitah) concealed within the Primal
Will, or, more simply, God’s created names and attributes.

In regard to the appearance of the archetypes, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá says in his Tafsír-i-Kuntu
Kanzan Makhfíyyan:

> Within the Hidden Essence [God], the stirrings of love and the inner yearnings
> necessitated Perfect Burnishing and Clarification (and the phrase “Perfect
> Burnishing” among some of the mystic knowers is the manifesting of the Absolute to
> Himself in the archetypal forms, and the word “Clarification” is the gazing by the

> Forms). Therefore the Essential Dispositions have, through the Divine Outpouring
> (fayḍ-i-aqdas) manifested themselves out of the station of the Essence into the station
> of the Divine Knowledge…. And from this manifestation the eternal archetypes came
> into intellectual being. And each one, according to its inherent capacity, is
> distinguished from the others in the mirrors [the recipient reality] of the Divine
> Knowledge…. This stage is known as the Secondary Unknown and Manifested
> Oneness. (Makátíb 2:9-10)23

The active and passive poles of Being have been mentioned frequently. They correspond to
spirit and soul, to the Father and the Mother, to form and substance, to the yin and the yang in
Taoism. All created things, Plato proposes in the Timaeus, result from the interaction of these
two realities, which, in essence, are one. In Bahá’u’lláh’s words, they are “the same, yet they
are different” (Tablets 140).

The Threefold Structure of Being24
Plato sums up the threefold structure of Being in these terms: (1) that which becomes
(physical things), (2) that in which it becomes (ethereal matter), and (3) the model which it
resembles (the archetypes). The archetypes have been described already as the “essential
predeterminations of things” concealed within the Primal Will. They are realities of which
sensible objects are only “accidents” or “phenomena.” Plato calls them “uncreated [in the
sense of being eternal realities] and indestructible, admitting no modification and entering no
combination, imperceptible to sight or the other senses, the object of thought” (Timaeus 70).

David Gallop clarifies, in his commentary on the Phaedo, that

> The Forms are in no sense ‘psychological’ or ‘subjective’ entities. They are not
> thoughts or concepts, existing only “in the mind” of a thinker. Nor are they mind-
> dependent objects. They may be thought of by the mind, viewed “with the soul,” but
> they do not depend upon being thought of for their existence. Just as physical objects
> exist independently of eye and vision, so Forms exist independently of mind and
> thought. (Plato, Phaedo 93)

For the archetypes or essences of things to become distinguished from one another or become
“individualized,” they must be reflected in a medium that itself has no characteristics or
qualities whatsoever. Plato has designated this medium the “receptacle” and “the nurse of all
becoming”; it is as everlasting and immutable as the archetypes. In a way that Plato admits is
“hard to describe” images of the archetypes are cast onto the medium. It is God who “casts”
by his creative act, for the archetypes are a formal energy emanating from his Essence.
Cornford explains that “the Receptacle is not that ‘out of

emanates from God.

which’ things are made; it is that ‘in which’ qualities appear, as fleeting images are seen in a
mirror. It is the qualities, not the Receptacle, that constitute ‘the Bodily’” (Plato’s Cosmology
181).25 When the “reflection” commences, created things come from the state of potentiality
into actuality. The medium provides a “seat” for the images to cling to a state of relative
existence and escape from being nothingness.26

The things that “become” as a result of the reflection cannot really be called “things,”
because they are ever-changing images of the archetypes. “Whenever we see anything in a
process of change,” Plato explains, “for example fire, we should speak of it not as being a
thing but as having a quality ... a continually recurrent similar quality” (Timaeus 67). The
permanent part of a thing, its idea, remains unknown. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá has mentioned the same
proposition in regard to physical things:

> Man discerns only manifestations, or attributes, of objects, while the identity, or
> reality, of them remains hidden. For example, we call this object a flower. What do
> we understand by this name and title? We understand that the qualities appertaining to
> this organism are perceptible to us, but the intrinsic elemental reality, or identity, of it
> remains unknown. (Promulgation 421)

From this perspective, all physical things, even the most fleeting subatomic particles, are no
more than qualities that appear reflected in ethereal matter; they are ever-changing, although
recurrent and similar, qualities that, in Plato’s words, at every moment “pass in and out” of
the receptive medium.

A similar theory was developed in Sufism called the “renewing of creation at each instant.”27
Burckhardt, in his Introduction to Sufi Doctrine, explains that “the ‘immutable essences’ (al-
a`yán ath-thábitah) ... in which God manifests Himself to Himself [possess] relative
modalities, [in other words] all the possible relations (nisab) they imply.” The variety of these
relations is

As the diversity of the reflections from a single archetype is endless in its temporal
succession “it is said that the ‘projection’ of the archetype into existence is renewed at each

instant in such a way that the same state of ‘reflected’ existence never subsists. Thus a
relative being is subject to continual annihilation and continual renewal” (Sufi Doctrine 66).
According to this theory, there is no temporal interval between annihilation and renewal;
therefore, such an action is imperceptible. Bahá’u’lláh may be hinting at this theory when He
elucidates different meanings for the term “return” in the Súriy-i-Vafá: “Know thou moreover
that every created thing is continually brought forth and returned at the bidding of thy Lord,
the God of power and might” (Tablets 183).

At the macroscopic level it is evident that physical beings are in a delicate state of balance
between the forces of composition and decomposition, which may be explained by the above
proposition that the images cast by an archetype are constantly changing. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá gives
this dictum: “all things are subject to transformation and change, save only the cause of
existence itself …” (Selections 157).

‘Abdu’l-Bahá explains that human beings, even as the cosmos, possess the same threefold
structure: “There are in the world of humanity three degrees; those of the body, the soul, and
spirit” (Paris Talks 96). What about the mind? Its faculties, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá sets forth in his
Tablet to Auguste Forel, are “in truth of the inherent properties of the soul ... ” (Bahá’í World
Faith 337).

The Bahá’í writings teach that the reality of humanity is not the body, which we share in
common with the animal. From the moment of conception we are spiritual beings, that is, our
inherent nature is to reflect, even embody, the divine attributes of the world of Forms. This is
that “image” of God we have been created after, not our flesh and bones. The limitless
spiritual potentialities of the soul, however, become evident in human beings only by degrees,
and many powers will become evident only after separation from the body. By passing
through the outer bodily existence the soul is given a special opportunity to develop free
willingly its immortal identity by the choices it makes in this life. However, spiritual
development is not dependent upon living in this world, for the fundamental individuality
(tashakhus) of the soul is from the beginning (Some Answered Questions 240). All of its
potentialities are already latent within it from the moment of conception, like the seed that
contains the potentiality of the oak tree.

The world of Forms, or the world of the soul, of course, is invisible to the senses. It is the
spiritual realm, the world of the divine attributes, “which lieth hidden in the innermost reality
of this world” (Bahá’u’lláh, Tablets 188). It is free from the contraries that mark the realm of
becoming. In Bahá’í and Sufi terminology it is called the “world of vision” or the “world of
similitudes or counterparts” (‘álam-i-mithál), analogous to the Kingdom (malakút), which is

intermediate between this world (násút) and the realm of pure potentialities (jabarút). (This is
the same as affirming that the soul is intermediate between body and spirit.) Bahá’u’lláh
explains that a counterpart of everything in the external universe exists in that plane (Má’idiy-

i-Ásmání 1:18-19). By the statement that everything has its “counterpart” in the spiritual
realm, it should be understood that an entity’s spiritual counterpart is its essential self, the
ethereal form that is both spirit and soul. “In the world of vision,” testifies ‘Abdu’l-Bahá,
“where the soul inhabited by the spirit has its being, and functions without the help of the
material bodily senses. There, in the realm of vision, the soul sees without the help of the
physical eye, hears without the aid of the physical ear, and travels without dependence upon
physical motion” (Paris Talks 86). ‘Abdu’l-Bahá points out in another text that “the world of
existence is a single world, although its stations are various and distinct” (Selections 193).
Therefore, we are now present in the “hereafter” despite our lack of awareness of it: “the
Kingdom of God.... is within this world. The people of this world, however, are unaware of
that world, and are even as the mineral and the vegetable that know nothing of the world of
the animal and the world of man” (Selections 194-95).

The Four Elements
When scientists in the nineteenth century attempted to explain the propagation of light waves,
they came up with the concept of ether, a medium through which light could move. ‘Abdu’l-
Bahá called ether an intellectual reality. However, scientists at that time were looking for a
physical medium for the propagation of light. When they failed to find what they were
looking for (empirical evidence), they discarded the theory of ether and proposed new
theories, such as abstract fields, to explain the same phenomenon. In the same way, the
modern table of elements, which is the basis of modern chemistry, was developed by
scientists as a new, more accurate, and much more comprehensive theory for explaining the
physical composition of things than the older theory of the four elements of Greek physics:
earth, water, air, and fire. There is no question that the modern theory of elements works very
effectively at the molecular level. However, it is evident that Bahá’u’lláh considered the older
theory of the elements appropriate to explain certain other truths or principles about nature.

In the Lawḥ-i-Áyiy-i-Núr (Tablet of the Verse of Light), Bahá’u’lláh gives this paradigm for
the genesis of the worlds of physical creation:

> Know that the first tokens that emanated from the pre-existent Cause in the worlds of
> creation are the four elements: fire, air, water, and earth.... Then the natures
> (usṭuqusát) of these four appeared: heat, moisture, cold, and dryness—those same
> qualities that ye both reckon and know. When the elements interacted and joined with
> one another, two pillars became evident for each one: for fire, heat and dryness, and
> likewise for the remaining three in accordance with these rules, as ye are aware. By
> them God created all that there is in the worlds of creation, whether of the higher or
> lower realms. In whatsoever thing these natures came into equilibrium that thing
> endured the passage of time, as ye behold with the sun and the moon; and in
> whatsoever thing

these natures came not into balance, that thing passed quickly into extinction, even as
> ye observe to be the case with the creatures of the lower worlds. (Má’idiy-i-Ásmání
> 4:82)29

Because Bahá’u’lláh refers to the four elements as “the first tokens” by which material
creation is generated, it is certain that He does not intend the ordinary meanings associated
with the terms “fire,” “air,” “water,” and “earth.” The exposition in Plato’s Timaeus may give
us some insights in this regard.

Plato explains that the receptacle of becoming is not partially empty but is completely full at
all times with the diverse ever-changing images of the archetypes, which are in a state of
disequilibrium and chaos.30 The receptacle is now designated by the term “space.” The
qualities or powers at motion in the receptacle can be reduced to four basic kinds called fire,
air, water, and earth. These qualities are not “things which change” but “changes,” as
permanence can only be ascribed to the recipient and its active counterpart. The Platonists,
Cornford affirms, “confine real being to ‘certain intelligible and bodiless Forms’ and reduce
the bodies which materialists regard as real to ‘a moving process of becoming’, with which
we have intercourse by means of sensation and perception” (Plato's Cosmology 204).

By God’s design the contents of the receptacle were sifted, so to speak, so that unlike
qualities moved apart and like qualities moved together. Thereby, Plato says, the four
different kinds

> came to occupy different regions of space even before they were arranged into an
> ordered universe. Before that time they were all without proportion or measure; fire,
> water, earth, and air bore some traces of their proper nature but were in the
> disorganized state to be expected of anything which god has not touched, and his first
> step when he set about reducing them to order was to give them a definite pattern of
> shape and number. (Timaeus 71-72)

The “space” of Plato is not the void of Democritus; it is full of powers and qualities in a non-
manifested state. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, in one of his Tablets on the universe, likewise asserts that “a
void is impossible (al-khaká’u muḥálun)” (Min Makátíb 1:54). In order for the four kinds,
with all their attendant qualities, to become manifest, Plato says that God endows them with
regular geometrical shapes. These geometrical shapes are not ultimate smallest particles but
fundamental structures. Plato chooses four regular solids: the tetrahedron, the octahedron, the
icosahedron, and the cube, as the “best” that he could find
29. Provisional translation by the author. A similar concept of the elements is found in

> this Hermetic text: “The elements through which all matter has been indued with form
> are four in number—fire, water, earth, and air.… Matter has been made ready by God
> beforehand to be the recipient of individual forms of every shape; and nature,
> fashioning matter in individual forms by means of the four elements, brings into

being, up to the height of heaven, all things that will be pleasing in God’s sight”
(Asclepius 1:3a-3c).
30. In regard to the chaos, Hermes relates: “When matter was not yet formed into body,

> my son, it was in disorder; and even in our world, it retained something of disorder,
> which besets the small living creatures [in contrast to planets and suns]; for the
> process of growth and decay is a remnant of disorder” (Libellus 8:3-4).

his purpose. Each of these solids can be constructed from two elementary triangles, a right-
angled isosceles and a right-angled scalene. Because triangles are constructed from lines, and
lines can be expressed in numbers, the basis of structure is mathematics. By a regrouping of
the geometrical surfaces, Plato proposes that each of the elements can be transformed into
one of the others. What we perceive at the macroscopic level is not the geometrical shapes
but the qualities associated with particular patterns of structure. In light of the remarkable
parallels of Plato’s geometrical model to modern theory, as has been pointed out by Popper, it
is not surprising that W. K. C. Guthrie also remarks of the Timaeus: The Timaeus’
“geometrical theory of the world has come into its own again as evidence of a brilliant natural
insight into the structure of matter.... [It was] Heisenberg’s opinion that the tendency of
modern physics brings it closer to the Timaeus than to Democritus” (A History of Greek
Philosophy 5:242).

Two of the elements, fire and water, according to Bahá’u’lláh, are active agents, and two, air
and earth, are passive agents (unpublished Tablet, Bahá’í International Archives). Plato
likewise demonstrates that some of the qualities in the chaos must be active and others acted
upon, since “motion can never take place in conditions of uniformity” (Timaeus 80).

In the Hermetic tradition, earth, water, air, and fire were never regarded “as corporeal or
chemical substances in the present-day sense of the word. The four elements are simply the
primary, and most general, qualities by means of which the amorphous and purely
quantitative substance of all bodies first reveals itself in differentiated form” (Burckhardt,
Alchemy 66). In other words, when the four kinds at motion in the chaos are brought into
definite form and equilibrium, they manifest to our senses as four states of matter: solid
(earth), liquid (water), gaseous (air), and radiant (fire). Each state, according to this theory, is
characterized by dual properties that allow the elements to separate and intermingle. Air has
hot and moist properties, fire has hot and dry properties, water has cold and moist properties,
and earth has cold and dry properties. Traditionally speaking, from the interaction and
coalition of these properties or natures into different proportions and states of equilibrium,
minerals, plants, animals, and humans are enabled to come into existence.

Figure 1: The Interaction of the Four Elements by Means of the Four Natures

This figure resembles another allusion by Bahá’u’lláh to the process of creation that hints at
the mathematical basis of the universe along Pythagorean lines. He relates: “Know then, that
God, praised and glorified be He, took a line, split it lengthwise into two, rotated the one
about the other, and so made from them the universe. The line, however, formeth only from
the point when you move it. Conceive ye then our meaning” (unpublished Tablet, Bahá’í
International Archives).31 Interestingly, according to one commentator, the elements coincide
with four biochemical processes that preserve life: air (hot and moist) = oxidation, earth (dry
and cold) = reduction, fire (hot and dry) = dehydration, and water (moist and cold) =
hydration (Mahdihassan, Hamdard 20:77).

The Principle of Balance
In Bahá’u’lláh’s above-quoted passage on the elements He goes on to state that the degree to
which any creature maintains the balance of its natures effects the duration of its lifespan.
Balance is the key to preserving life, not just in individual entities, but in ecosystems and
social systems as well. Bahá’u’lláh strongly advised humankind, in this regard, to practice
“moderation in all things.” Such things as liberty and civilization, He warns, will, “if carried
to excess, exercise a pernicious influence upon men …” (Gleanings 216).

The Greek philosophers in general placed great emphasis on the principle of balance.
Hippocrates, the physician (ca. 460-400 B.C.), viewed the body as a balanced system with the
power to heal its disorders from within. He mainly prescribed rest and diet as remedies. Plato
set forth in his Laws that the best system of government is one wherein every party is in
balance with the others. Aristotle, in his essay on Nichomachean Ethics, recognized that the
virtues of humankind are means between excess and deficiency.

Maintaining the balance of one’s natures is not only the key to longevity, it is the attractor of
the spirit or life force. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá explains:

> ... these members, these elements, this composition, which are found in the organism
> of man, are an attraction and magnet for the spirit.... That is to say, when these
> existing elements are gathered together according to the natural order, and with
> perfect strength, they become a magnet for the spirit, and the spirit will become
> manifest in them with all its perfection. (Some Answered Questions 201)

In this world, the effects of spirit and matter upon each other are reciprocal. The act of love of
the father and the mother that generates the embryo simultaneously individualizes the new
soul from the Universal Spirit in which it potentially exists. The soul then, by successive
effusions of its power, i.e., the unique combination of creative names that constitutes its
essence, both directs the development of the embryo through new stages and maintains its
being. Before the body can move on into a new stage of development, it must first have
fulfilled the potential given it by the previous effusion of the spirit. In this manner the soul
gradually

develops the body to the stage of maturity, at which time the soul’s intellectual powers are
also capable of mature expression, and, finally, the soul brings the body to the stage of
fruition, which we call death. Aristotle gives a similar teleological explanation for the coming
into being of natural things. The principle implied is that the immaterial form must precede
the material form, just as a carpenter must first possess the plan for a house in his mind
before he builds it. Our DNA may be the blueprints for our bodies, but the source of that
information, and the energy that activates it, is beyond this space-time existence.

The Bahá’í Faith teaches that humankind collectively on this planet has been evolving
through similar stages by the motive power of God’s Word. God’s Word has been
progressively revealed to humanity, through the mediating agency of the prophets, according
to the exigencies of the time and place, thus setting into motion what Shoghi Effendi
describes as

> that process of integration which, starting with the family, the smallest unit in the
> scale of human organization, must, after having called successively into being the
> tribe, the city-state, and the nation, continue to operate until it culminates in the
> unification of the whole world. . . . It is this stage which humanity, willingly or
> unwillingly, is resistlessly approaching. (The Promised Day is Come 117-18)

The external Word of God, which is set down as scripture, is, of course, only the shell that
preserves for humanity the spirit and purpose of the actual Word of God that encompasses the

universe. Shoghi Effendi refers to “the creative energies” that the Revelation of Bahá’u’lláh
released in the world at the moment humankind was ready to receive them, thus instilling
“into humanity the capacity to attain this final stage in its organic and collective evolution
(The Promised Day is Come 118). By such reciprocal interaction spirit, whether in the
individual or in the universal sense, moves matter toward its ultimate goal: the bringing into
being of creatures capable of knowing and loving their Creator, and of serving the best
interests of their planet with pure and faithful hearts.

To return to the theme of balance, if humanity learns to maintain the delicate equilibrium of
life on earth according to the natural order, it is certain that our planetary environment will
proliferate abundantly for a long period to come. “The elements and lower organisms are
synchronized in the great plan of life. Shall man,” asks ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, “infinitely above them
in degree, be antagonistic and a destroyer of that perfection?” (Promulgation 350).

Health depends upon the equilibrium of the opposing properties that compose the whole
human being. In regard to physical factors alone, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá states:

> The outer, physical causal factor in disease ... is a disturbance in the balance, the
> proportionate equilibrium of all those elements of which the human body is
> composed.... So long as these constituents remain in their due proportion, according to
> the natural balance of the whole . . . there will be no physical cause for the incursion
> of disease. (Selections 153)

In the Lawḥ-i-Ṭibb (Tablet of Healing) Bahá’u’lláh outlines a healthful regimen, which if
followed, He says, will preserve the normal equilibrium of the natures of the body and ensure
that the primary substance (aṣl) remains in its pristine purity (Alwáḥ 224). Thus, preserving
the equilibrium of the natures (qualities, powers), at all levels of created things, is essential
for the life force to continue manifesting itself. Several scientists, in attempting to define the
distinctive characteristics of life, have also noted that the continuance of life depends upon
the peculiar organization and balanced operation of all the parts that compose an organism.
Biologist J. Shaxel says: “Living processes and living materials as such simply do not exist
save as parts of single whole organisms” (quoted in Augros, The New Biology 29).

From the Hermetic perspective, any form of physical life is dependent upon the presence of
soul: “Wherever there is life, there is soul; but in the irrational animals, the soul is devoid of
mind” (Libellus 12:2). The evidence of life or soul is motion. Hermes says: “Know then ...
that everything which exists in the Kosmos . . . is in motion; and that which is in motion must
be alive” (Libellus 12:18). The consequence of motion, which is the fundamental property of
physical beings, is the law of change. According to this Hermetic principle, the universe as a
whole is eternal, but it constantly changes in form over time. Bahá’u’lláh follows this view in
the Lawḥ-i-Ḥikmat. If soul taken in an individual sense is the source of life in each thing, the
Universal Mind, according to Hermes, is the life force of the universe as a whole. It is this

primal emanation from God that contains all things and maintains “in being all things that
are” (Libellus 2:12a).

Among the four natures, Bahá’u’lláh states that two, moisture and heat, are active agents.
Both qualities are found in the element of air, which, Bahá’u’lláh says, is the cause of colors
and mixture and contains that which astounds the minds of those endowed with insight
(Má’idiy-i-Ásmání 1:30). When one observes nature, it can be seen how important these two
qualities are to the generation of life in the plant and animal kingdoms. At the height of the
growing season the growth of plants can be measured daily according to the ratio of heat and
moisture. The emergence of spring, with all of its colors and millions of forms of regenerated
species, may be due to heat and moisture coming into equilibrium with each other once again.
Eggs of most species develop and hatch through the influence of external temperature on
their internal moisture.

In a body of Tablets known as Alwáḥ-i-Iksír (Tablets of the Elixir), Bahá’u’lláh proposes that
it is possible, by means of a special process, to extract the life-imparting essence from nature,
embodied in a highly balanced form of matter.32 Alchemists call it the Stone, and it has
numerous names in the Tablets. In its purified and refined form, i.e., when it becomes free
from the external accidents that inhibit the action of the essence, it is designated, among other
names, “the philosophers’ gold,” “the red oil,” and “the red elixir.” This agent,
32. In the Lawḥ-i-Ḥikmat Bahá’u’lláh alludes to a unique power concealed in nature: “It

> [nature] is endowed with a power whose reality men of learning fail to grasp” (Tablets
> 142).

which Bahá’u’lláh claims is “the Physician of the Ocean (ṭabíb-i-baḥr) upon whose skill
dependeth the well-being of diseased and sick bodies, whether terrestrial, marine, or mineral”
(Má’idiy-i-Ásmání 1:40),33 does not exist in the natural state, but must be fashioned by the
artificial treatment known as “the hidden craft” (ṣan`iy-i-maktúm). According to Bahá’u’lláh,
“the treatment (tadbír) is specially designed so that this precious, life-giving essence . . . may
be purified and cleansed of dross, darkness, and external, corruptive and immoderate
moistures, which prevent the appearance of its effect and action” (Má’idiy-i-Ásmání 1:37).34
Within this “fashioned Stone,” Bahá’u’lláh testifies, resides the essence of the active force,
which is the heat (life-ordering energy?) that underlies the world and causes all motion
(Má’idiy-i-Ásmání 4:80).

The counterpart of the elixir in the realm of Revelation is the Manifestation of God, by whose
Word darkened souls are transformed into luminous, light-seeking essences. This is the
source of missionary zeal and spiritual fervor among believers. Isaac Newton, in true
Hermetic fashion, believed that the alchemical agent which vitalizes matter belonged to the
realm of spirit, and he may have identified it with Christ and the Word, which “was in the
beginning.” As a believer in Arian Christianity, he saw Christ as the mediator of God’s Will

into action in the world. By somehow extracting the alchemical agent from nature he hoped
to “demonstrate God’s action in the world in an absolutely irrefutable fashion” and thus
counter the atheistic tendencies of the mechanists and the Cartesians (Dobbs, “Newton’s
Commentary” 187-89).

I do not fully understand the object of Bahá’u’lláh’s thought in the Alwáḥ-i-Iksír, but it is
certain that a familiarity with the theory of the four elements and the four natures, as well as
the active and passive principles of being, is important, as they are frequently referred to in
Bahá’u’lláh’s explanations of the process. Bahá’u’lláh purposely used the allusive and
symbolic language of the alchemists to explain the knowledge of the elixir, and He strictly
prohibited his followers from becoming engaged in its practice. In many Tablets, He states
that the time of its appearance is fixed by God, and, in one amazing instance, He prophesies
that the appearance of “this hidden treasure” among the learned is one of the signs of the
coming of age of the world (Má’idiy-i-Ásmání 1:41).

Conclusion
Bahá’ís believe that the ultimate origin of matter is a spiritual reality. The Word of God,
which is the first thing to emanate from God, is the cause of all the other existences. To bring
forth the worlds of existence, the Word manifests two poles, which Bahá’u’lláh has
designated the active force and its recipient. They are the even and the odd concealed in the
One that precedes multiplicity. By their interaction a “heat” is generated that has
everlastingly caused the motions, forces, and properties that unite into an ordered universe of
innumerable beings. In Bahá’u’lláh’s words: “There is but one reality and one essence

that is expounded in the worlds of outer form, and, at each of its stages, is described by a
specific name ... in accordance with the degrees of its particular manifestations on the plane
of this limited world” (unpublished Tablet, Bahá’í International Archives).35
