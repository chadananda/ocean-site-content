The History and Provenance of an Early Manuscript of
the Nuqtat al-kaf Dated 1268 (1851 – 52)

It has been more than one hundred years since E. G. Browne discovered two
manuscripts of the Nuqtat al-kaf, a history of the Babi movement, in the
Bibliothèque Nationale. When he published a critical edition of the book based
on these two manuscripts in 1910, Browne attributed it to Hajji Mirza Jani
Kashani, a Babi killed in 1852, and appraised it as one of the earliest histories
of the Babi movement.1 Baha’i leaders of the time contended that the book
was not authored by Mirza Jani, but rather that it was a late Azali forgery.2 Sub-
sequent researchers have reached a middle ground, arguing that the historical
portion of the Nuqtat al-kaf was written in the early 1850s, perhaps by several
authors, on the basis of a shorter, earlier history by Mirza Jani; they also
contend that an earlier theological treatise was appended to the work at this

\[1\] In 1892 Browne asked Subh Azal (see below) about the identity of the author of the Nuqtat al-kaf.

He replied, “The history to which you allude must, by certain indications, be by the uplifted and
martyred Hajji for none but he wrote (such) a history.” Browne inferred that Subh Azal was speak-
ing of Hajji Mirza Jani. See Edward Granville Browne, Kitab-i Nuqtat al-Kaf: Being the Earliest
History of the Babis compiled by Haji Mirza Jani of Kashan (Leiden, 1910), 3 – 4.

Soon after the book’s publication, ‘Abdu’l-Baha’—the eldest son of Baha’u’llah, and the head of
the Baha’i Faith from 1892 to 1921—dismissed the Nuqtat al-kaf and especially its introduction as an
Azali-inspired forgery and instructed a number of prominent and scholarly Baha’is to write refu-
tations of the book and forward them to the Baha’i scholar, Mirza Abu al-Fadl (for ‘Abdu’l-
Baha’s reaction, see ‘Abdul-Hamid Ishraq-khavari, Ma’idih-yi asmani (Tehran, 129 BE/1973) 5:
206 – 10; for Abu al-Fadl’s role, see Ruhullah Mihrabkhani, Zindigani-yi Mirza Abu al-Fadl Gulpaygani
(Hofheim-Langenhain, 1988), 427). A number of Baha’is carried out ‘Abdu’l-Baha’s wishes, with
the most signiﬁcant apology written by Mirza Na‘im Sidihi and Mirza Hasan-i Adib as early as
1911 – 1912. In a letter dated 16 Shawwal 1330 (September 28, 1912) Mirza Abu al-Fadl mentions
that he had written ﬁve or six sections of a refutation (which was later incorporated into his
Kashf al-ghita’) when he received a letter from Ibn Abhar (a prominent Baha’i) and correspon-
dence from Adib and Na’im. Abu al-Fadl relates that these men informed him that they had
found a copy of the Nuqtat al-kaf and discovered the identity of its author and scribe: Mirza
Mustafa, a Babi scribe living in Tehran. See Mirza Abu al-Fadl Gulpaygani, Rasa’il va
raqa’im, ed. R. Mihrabkhani (Tehran, 134 BE/1978), 452 – 3. As we will see, it is certainly poss-
ible that they had discovered a manuscript of the Nuqtat al-kaf in Mirza Mustafa’s handwriting,
but their attribution of authorship to him was premature.

time. These authors differ, however, on whether or not the Nuqtat al-kaf was
heavily redacted by later authors.3 Dating the text and determining its redaction
history is important since it determines how historians can use it. If it was written
in the early 1850s and underwent little redaction, then it is one of the earliest
internal histories of the Babi movement as well as a valuable window into the con-
fused state of that community during the time it was composed. If it was written
later or heavily redacted, then it may be the product of the animosity between the
partisans of Mirza Yahya (known as Azal or Subh Azal), the head of the Babi
community nominated by the Bab, and those of his half-brother Mirza Husayn
‘Ali (known as Baha’ or Baha’u’llah), who began to establish a new religion in
1863\. As such, it would be less valuable as a source for early Babi history,
although it could be used to gauge later communal tensions.

So far, those who have examined the Nuqtat al-kaf have dated it based on
internal evidence and the reports of those who saw early manuscripts of the
text. However, the absence of any manuscripts with colophons containing an
early date has made the matter inconclusive.4 With the discovery of a manuscript
of the Nuqtat al-kaf dated 1268 (1851 –52) in Princeton’s collection of Babi works
we are now able to conﬁrm Browne’s hypothesis that the Nuqtat al-kaf was
written in the early 1850s, although we agree with other contemporary scholars
that Browne mistakenly attributed the entire book to the Kashani merchant.5
Moreover, the 1268 manuscript is not markedly different from Browne’s
edition, which indicates that the Nuqtat al-kaf underwent little substantive

In 1974, Muhit-i Tabataba’i argued that the Nuqtat al-kaf was actually a combination of two
originally separate works: a theological treatise and a history (see his “Kitabi bi nam ba nami
taza,” Gawhar, (1353/1974) 11 – 12: 952 – 61). Tabataba’i points out that in the ﬁrst part, a theologi-
cal treatise, the author states that it was written 1277 years after the ba‘tha (Muhammad’s call to
prophethood). Depending on how this is calculated, it gives us the date of either 1267/1850 – 51
or 1264/1848 (see Dennis MacEoin, The Sources for Early Babi Doctrine and History (Leiden, 1992),
147 – 8). In the historical part of the Nuqtat al-kaf, the author mentions that 1270 years have
passed since the Hijra, thus giving us the date of 1270/1853 – 54. Since the latest date mentioned
is 1270 (1853 – 54), Tabataba’i conjectures that in this year someone combined an earlier theological
treatise with a historical work written around 1270/1853 – 54. MacEoin agrees with this hypothesis,
although he differs with Tabataba’i over who might have authored the work (Sources, 151). Abbas
Amanat and Juan Cole also agree with Tabataba’i’s hypothesis, but they differ from him and
MacEoin in that they posit that the book might have been redacted later. Thus, Amanat
believes that much of the material was written in the early 1850s but some passages detailing
the leadership of the Babi community in 1851 may have been redacted in the 1860s (see his Resurrec-
tion and Renewal (Ithaca, 1989) 423). Going beyond Amanat, Cole argues that the work which
was written in the 1850s was deﬁnitely redacted in the 1860s (“Nuqtat al-Kaf and the Babi
Chronicle Traditions,” Research Notes in Shaykhi, Babi and Baha’i Studies, 2, no. 6 (1998), http://
www.h-net.org/  bahai/notes/vol2/Babihist.htm).

Browne used two manuscripts of the Nuqtat al-kaf acquired by Comte de Gobineau and pur-
chased by the Bibliothèque Nationale in 1884 after his death. One incomplete manuscript was
appended to the end of a copy of the Bab’s Persian Bayan. The Persian Bayan ends with a colophon
dating it to 1279 (1862– 63). Although the incomplete copy of the Nuqtat al-kaf does not have its
own colophon, we can surmise that it was appended to the 1279 Persian Bayan sometime soon after
this date. The other copy of the Nuqtat al-kaf in the Bibliothèque is complete but has no date.

redaction prior to its publication in 1910. Finally, we believe that this manuscript
is not only signiﬁcant for its early date; it may also be a clean copy of the
original draft of the Nuqtat al-kaf. In this article we will present our preliminary
ﬁndings on the provenance of the text and its history, beginning with the two
people who played a key role in its preservation: Mirza Mustafa and Sa‘id
Khan Kurdistani.

Mirza Mustafa was born around the year 1259/1843, presumably in his
home village of Sidih, near Isfahan.6 Then known as Isma‘il Sabbagh Sidihi,
he worked as a dyer (sabbagh) in Sidih. At some point in his youth, he met
Sayyid Yusuf Dihnuhi, a Babi who converted him to the movement.7 Before
Dihnuhi left he entrusted Mirza Mustafa’s religious instruction to the prominent
mujtahid, Zayn al-‘Abidin (later known as Zayn al-Muqarribin), a Babi who
lived in nearby Najafabad.8 Zayn left Najafabad around 1864 and settled in
Baghdad.9 During this time he became a supporter of Baha’u’llah, who claimed
to have received a new revelation from God—a claim his half-brother Subh
Azal rejected.

Unlike his teacher, Mirza Mustafa remained an ardent supporter of Subh
Azal;10 however, he paid a heavy price for his devotion and his efforts to

Kavian Milani offers some new insights on the authorship of Nuqtat al-kaf in his forthcoming
“The Bab’s Stay in Kashan: A Critique of the Nuqtatu’l-kaf Based on the Kashan Pericope,” Baha’i
Studies Review.

There is no birth date for Mirza Mustafa although both Bamdad and Qasimi say that he died in
1339/1921 when he was over eighty years old. See Mahdi Bamdad, Sharh-i hal-i rijal-i Iran dar qarn
12, 13, 14 hijri (Tehran, 1974) 6: 264, and Ali Muhammad Qasimi’s brief biographical notice on
Mirza Mustafa written in 1351/1932 and published in the introduction of Mirza Mustafa’s
Pasukh (Refutation) of Zayn al-Muqarribin (see below) published online at H-Baha’i: http://
www.h-net.org/  bahai/arabic/vol5/zayn/zaynresp.htm).

Sa‘id Kahn Kurdistani, “Notes on Babi Mss. by Dr. Saeed Khan,” (William McElwee Miller
Papers, box 4, envelope labeled “Notes on Babi Books by Dr. Saeed,” Department of Rare
Books and Special Collections, Princeton University Library), 31. William McCants recently discov-
ered the envelope containing these detailed notes by Kurdistani on the history of each manuscript in
his private collection. William Miller (see below), in a footnote of his The Baha’i Faith: Its History and
Teachings, mentions that the “Notes of Dr. Sa’eed” are located at Princeton (xix, n. 17). Although
they are not separately catalogued, they are located in box 4 of William Miller’s papers in an envel-
ope marked “Valuable! Notes on Babi Books by Dr. Saeed.” Miller acquired these notes and Kur-
distani’s collection of Babi manuscripts while he was living in Iran and later donated them to
Princeton University. The notes, numbering over thirty pages, are not only valuable for infor-
mation on the background of many of the manuscripts in the collection; they also contain
unique biographical information on Azali and Baha’i ﬁgures. Miller translated all of these notes
(excluding a few Arabic passages). McCants hopes to publish Miller’s rendition after comparing
it with the original and translating the Arabic passages that Miller excluded.

convert others to his religion.11 Around 1870, Mirza Mustafa ﬂed Sidih due to
a famine and the local persecution of Babis. He sought refuge in Isfahan with
Robert Bruce, a Christian missionary who had settled there in 1869. Although
Bruce baptized him, Mirza Mustafa likely converted for the protection afforded
by the powerful reverend, not out of conviction.12

Despite this conversion, Mirza Mustafa could not escape the stigma of
being a Babi and the accompanying persecution. At some point it seems that
Mirza Mustafa returned to Sidih, since two of his biographers say that he again
ﬂed the city for Isfahan in 1307 (1889 – 1890) when seven “Babis” (which could
either mean Babis or Baha’is) in Sidih were beheaded on the order of the powerful
Usuli mujtahid of Isfahan, Shaykh Muhammad Taqi, known as Aqa Najaﬁ.13
Mirza Mustafa was arrested several days after his arrival and, on the order of
the governor of the time, the Zill al-Sultan, one of his ears was cut off.14 He
was then bridled like a camel and paraded in the streets and the bazaar of
Isfahan, after which he was expelled from the city. Some of the Babis of Isfahan
brought him back to the city under the cover of darkness and, after several
days of hiding, he traveled to the village of Tar. Tar, one of the suburbs of
Natanz, was the home of Mulla Muhammad Baqir, known as Akhund Tari, a
local mujtahid and a Babi. Mirza Mustafa sought out Akhund Tari and stayed
with him for some time, transcribing the writings of the Bab which the mujtahid
had in his possession.15

Apparently Zayn later wrote Mirza Mustafa a letter and tried to convince him of Baha’u’llah’s
claims (Kurdistani, “Notes,” 32). In reply, Mirza Mustafa wrote a lengthy refutation in 1337/1919
that has recently been published online (see note above).

That Mirza Mustafa was engaged in clandestine efforts to spread his faith is demonstrated by
the account of a well-known Baha’i poet, Na’im, who says that he ﬁrst heard about the Bab’s teach-
ings and obtained copies of his writings through his fellow townsman, “Mulla Isma’il” (Mirza
Mustafa). See ‘Aziz’u’llah Sulaymani’s Masabih-i hidayat (Tehran, 123 BE/1967) 3: 140.

This episode is related by Kurdistani (“Notes,” 1). Here Kurdistani writes that even though
Mirza Mustafa converted, “we knew that he was at heart a Babi, and only outwardly Christian.”
For more information on Mirza Mustafa’s conversion, see Moojan Momen, “Early Relations
between Christian Missionaries and the Babi and Baha’i Communities,” in Studies in Babi and
Baha’i History (Los Angles, 1982), 60 – 63.

Bamdad, 242 –243. This date squares with Mirza Mustafa’s own testimony. In the Descriptive
Catalogue of manuscripts owned by E. G. Browne, Nicholson mentions a note written by
Browne who states that Mirza Mustafa disclosed his real name to him as Isma’il-i Sabbagh of
Sidih and said that he ﬂed the persecutions in Isfahan about 35 years ago; Browne received this
note along with several manuscripts on September 15, 1922 (see Descriptive Catalogue, 81). For
general details on the 1890 persecution of Babis and Baha’is in Isfahan, Sidih, and Najafabad, see
Edward Granville Browne, A Traveller’s Narrative (New York, 1930), 400 – 412; and Moojan
Momen, The Babi and Baha’i Religions, 1844 –1944: Some Contemporary Western Accounts (Oxford,
1981), 284 – 91.

Kurdistani asserts that the Zill al-Sultan cut off his ear in order to appease the people and save
Mirza Mustafa’s life (“Notes,” 3).

Bamdad, 243; Qasimi, introduction. Qasimi says that Akhund Tari hid Mirza Mustafa in his
brother’s cellar.

If he had thought to escape the persecution of Aqa Najaﬁ, Mirza Mustafa had
picked the wrong place to hide, for the Shaykh soon set his sights on Akhund
Tari. With the consent of the Zill al-Sultan, horsemen were sent to arrest the
two men and they were forced to ﬂee. Mirza Mustafa went to Tehran and tried
to keep a low proﬁle, changing his name from Isma‘il to Mirza Mustafa and
taking up the occupation of a scribe.16 He continued to transcribe the writings
of the Bab and Subh Azal and even managed to visit the latter in Cyprus with
his two daughters in 1317 or 1318 (ca. 1900), where he remained for three
years. He must have been favored by Subh Azal since one of his daughters,
Hamidih, was given in marriage to Subh Azal’s son, ‘Abd al-Wahid. When the
latter died, Mirza Mustafa returned with his daughters to Tehran and lived
there until his death on July 28, 1921.17

Sometime between his return and 1911,18 Mirza Mustafa made the acquain-
tance of Dr. Sa‘id Khan Kurdistani, a Sunni Muslim convert to Christianity
from Senneh. Kurdistani was somewhat of a polymath who had received a
traditional Sunni religious education in Senneh and was there inducted into the
Naqshabandi Suﬁ order.19 As a young man, he converted to Christianity
through contact with an Assyrian missionary from Urumiyya (who also taught
him Syriac) and then ﬂed to Hamadan to avoid persecution; there he learned
English and the practice of medicine at a Christian mission.20 In 1893, he traveled
to London and stayed there for two and a half years.21 At this time Kurdistani
may have met E. G. Browne, the British orientalist, with whom he would later
correspond and whom he would introduce to Mirza Mustafa.

When he returned to Iran, Kurdistani set up his own clinic in Hamadan. At
the turn of the century, ‘Ayn al-Dawla, the governor of Luristan and Khuzistan

Bamdad, 243; Qasimi, introduction. Mazandarani, a Baha’i historian, gives a brief biographical
notice of an Azali named Sayyid Aqa Khan Talkhunchih’i of Isfahan who also had a severed ear and
moved to Tehran after a wave of Baha’i executions in 1296 (1879). Although Mazandarani’s date
does not match that of Mirza Mustafa’s ﬂight, he must certainly be talking about him since he
reports that this man also took the name “Mulla Mustafa” and worked as a scribe of Babi and
Azali writings (Zuhur al-haqq [Tehran, 1974. Digitally reprinted, East Lansing, MI: H-Bahai,
2001] 8: 505).

Qasimi, introduction. Kurdistani notes that during his time in Cyprus, Mirza Mustafa was very
agitated by the behavior of his daughter’s husband, who, according to Mirza Mustafa, “had thirty
prostitutes as his companions” (Kurdistani, “Notes,” 1).

In an English note appended by Kurdistani to a copy of Tarikh-i jadid that Mirza Mustafa had
transcribed, he writes: “The witness is M. Mostafa the writer of many Babi mss[.] he is a reliable
man, though now/owns [sic] has got tired of Babism and all his own sufferings.” The note is
dated Dec. 18, 1911 (see folio 228a, Tarikh-i jadid, vol. 8, Islamic Manuscripts, Third Series, Depart-
ment of Rare Books and Special Collections, Princeton University Library).

from 1899– 1901, made him his personal physician during an insurrection of Luri
tribesmen.22 Afterward, the governor brought him back to Tehran, where he
received the title of “Khan” and a yearly stipend. Kurdistani was allowed to
return to Hamadan after he successfully operated on one of the wives of Muzaffar
al-Din Shah, which also made him one of the most sought-after doctors in the
area. By 1901 he had returned to Hamadan.23

As an enthusiastic convert to Christianity with training in the traditional
Islamic sciences, Kurdistani did not shrink from debating with his former
Sunni coreligionists or Shi’is. He also seems to have developed an interest in
the Babi movement since one of his biographers writes of him engaging in a
debate with Babis during a trip to Urumiyya in 1901. In this debate, his biogra-
pher notes, Kurdistani exhibited a substantial knowledge of the Bab’s Persian
Bayan.24 As the anecdote indicates, Kurdistani’s interest in Babis and Baha’is
probably stemmed from evangelical concerns—he and his coreligionists were
worried about the successful missionary activities of the Baha’is in Iran, which
they saw as a threat to their own efforts. Regarding this threat, Kurdistani’s
biographer and relative by marriage, Isaac Malek Yonan, writes:

> Babism was soon changed to Bahaism and the Bayan was superseded by the
> Ikan (the written revelation of the sect). The cult has since made deep
> inroads in the ranks of the intelligentsia of Persia, and has even attempted a
> wide propaganda throughout the world, with aspiration of becoming the
> world religion.25

With some relief, he notes that Kurdistani had made it his business to become an
expert on these religious movements:

> There is no living person to-day who knows more and understands better the
> fallacies of Bahaism and who has done more both by his writings and his
> controversies in exposing the hypocrisies and inconsistencies of its claims
> than Dr. Sa’eed, who is an acknowledged authority on the whole system.26

Aside from his evangelical motivation for seeking knowledge about the Babis
and Baha’is, Kurdistani may have also had a personal grudge against the move-
ments’ adherents. In the winter of 1904, according to William Miller,27 some
Jewish physicians of Hamadan who had become Baha’i told several local Shi‘i

clerics that Kurdistani had written The Sources of Islam, a refutation of the Qur’an
actually penned by W. St. Clair-Tisdall, a Christian missionary in Iran. Miller does
not tell us much about their motives for doing so, only that they were “jealous of
his successes.”28 Whether or not this actually happened, it is worth noting that
these converts were not responsible for the book’s initial attribution to Kurdis-
tani. Rather, Miller records that Kurdistani had previously given a copy of the
book to a mulla in Hamadan who then accused him of writing it and ordered
his death while he was away on his 1901 trip to Urumiyya.29 Similarly, in
Miller’s account of the 1904 incident, the mullas of Hamadan decreed Kurdistani’s
death for writing the book and for his attempts to convert Muslims to Chris-
tianity. A wealthy landowner, Amir Afkham, whose wife and daughter Kurdistani
had saved from cholera in 1904, did not immediately intervene because he
wanted the disturbance to continue in order to put pressure on the governor to
resign. When the crisis escalated, he provided protection for Kurdistani. In the
meantime, the region’s governor contacted the prime minister of Iran and
informed him of the situation. The prime minister summoned Kurdistani to
Tehran where he went with his wife and remained for seven years before returning
to Hamadan.30

During this period of time in Tehran, his search for manuscripts and information
on the Babi and Baha’i religions led him to Mirza Mustafa, from whom he
began to commission copies of manuscripts in the latter’s substantial collection.31
One of the books he commissioned was a copy of the Nuqtat al-kaf.32 Although we

Baha’is or his view of their religion, he did not refrain from providing them medical treatment
after his move to Tehran. One of his Baha’i patients, Hasan Balyuzi, writes: “The present writer,
having been Dr. Sa‘id Khan’s patient in his boyhood, remembers him well; the doctor’s probity
was unquestionable” (Balyuzi, Browne and the Baha’i Faith, 34, n. 3).

By 1912 Kurdistani had put Browne in touch with Mirza Mustafa, from whom the professor
also commissioned a number of manuscripts from him. Regarding the size and signiﬁcance of Mirza
Mustafa’s collection, Browne writes:

> For several rare manuscript works I am indebted to an old Babi scribe of Isfahan, resident at
> Tihran, with whom I was put in communication by Dr Sa‘id Khan of Hamadan, who, though
> coming of a family of mullas, is a fervent Christian, while preserving in true Persian fashion a
> keen interest in other religious beliefs. This old scribe, a follower of Subh-i-Azal, seems to
> have been in close touch with many Babis in all parts of Persia, and on several occasions
> when persecutions threatened or broke out to have been entrusted by them with the custody
> of books which they feared to keep in their own houses, and which in some cases they failed
> to reclaim, so that he had access to a large number of rare Babi works, any of which he was
> willing to copy for me at a very moderate charge (Browne, Materials for the Study of the Babi Reli-
gion (Cambridge, 1918), xi); diacritics removed in conformity with the style of Iranian Studies).

Perhaps Kurdistani ﬁrst learned of the existence of the Nuqtat al-kaf from the introduction and
appendices of Browne’s edition of the Tarikh-i jadid; there the British orientalist argued that the
Tarikh-i jadid (written by a Baha’i) was a distorted revision of the Nuqtat al-kaf (Browne, New
History (Cambridge, 1893), Introduction, xxviii-xxix). If so, Kurdistani would no doubt have
wanted a copy of a history that would challenge Baha’i historiography, particularly concerning

do not know how many copies Kurdistani commissioned or how many other
manuscripts of the Nuqtat al-kaf he may have already possessed,33 we know
that Mirza Mustafa made at least one copy in 1327/1909 (hereafter referred to
as NK1327) which eventually ended up in Kurdistani’s Babi collection.
However, Kurdistani did not seem to know that it was copied by Mirza
Mustafa or that it was a recension of the Nuqtat al-kaf. In his notes on the manu-
script, he writes:

> Number 264. This is a history of Babism [tarikh-i babiyyih]. Like the Nuqtat
> al-kaf, it was copied in Kashan in 1268 A.H. They say that one copy was
> also printed. Much of the material is like the Nuqtat al-kaf, but it by no
> means has the simplicity and conciseness of Nuqtat al-kaf. It contains long
> and wearisome sermons. It recounts brieﬂy the ignominy of Badasht.34

This copy was labeled “Tarikh-i Babih (sic)” in keeping with Kurdistani’s
comments35 and, along with the rest of Kurdistani’s Babi manuscript collection,
was purchased by William Miller who later donated the manuscripts to Princeton
University.36 That Kurdistani misread the colophon of this manuscript and did
not examine the text closely will become evident below.

In the colophon of NK1327—the colophon to which Kurdistani refers in his
note above—Mirza Mustafa tells us what manuscripts he used to prepare his
copy:
the successorship of Subh Azal. The polemical value of the work was further enhanced after
Browne published his edition in 1910. Soon after, ‘Abdu’l-Baha’ denounced it as a complete
Azali forgery (see note above). Since Kurdistani was aware of early manuscripts of the Nuqtat
al-kaf that preceded the Baha’i-Azali split, he knew that the publication of such statements by
‘Abdu’l-Baha’ might cast the latter in a negative light. Thus, in a letter to William Miller written
November 17, 1929, Kurdistani tells him about one such statement in Bada’i‘al-athar, a journal
kept by one of ‘Abdu’l-Baha’s amanuenses, and promises to send him a copy once he has obtained
the book from a Baha’i acquaintance (Letter from Saeed Khan to William Miller dated 11-17-29, box
4, “Miller Papers”). So far we have been unable to ﬁnd the speciﬁc comments of ‘Abdu’l-Baha’ that
Kurdistani mentions in his letter.

Tabataba’i learned that Kurdistani’s Assyrian servant stole a copy of the Nuqtat al-kaf from
him in 1315/1946; however, Kurdistani considered it to be defective. See MacEoin, Sources, 146.

Kurdistani, “Notes,” 16. In this and a later quotation, we have modiﬁed Miller’s translation for
accuracy and transliteration (see footnote 7 for details on the translation). Despite Kurdistani’s
assertion, NK1327 is not substantially different from NK1268, including its treatment of the
Badasht episode. This is further evidence that Kurdistani did not compare the two manuscripts
carefully (see below).

This manuscript consists of 172 folios and it is catalogued as vol. 38, Islamic Manuscripts,
Third Series, although it bears Kurdistani’s old catalogue number of 264. This may be the same
manuscript cited by Mangol Bayat as “Tarikh-i babiyya” in her Mysticism and Dissent: Socioreligious
Thought in Qajar Iran (Syracuse, 1982), 208. If so, it appears that she confused this manuscript with
some other text as it contains no reference to Mirza Malkum Khan’s association with Babis in
Baghdad after his exile from Persia (Bayat, 149).

An Early Manuscript of the Nuqtat al-kaf 439

While Mirza Mustafa seems to have written the ﬁrst two passages at the same
time, the hurried handwriting of the ﬁnal passage concerning a 1269 manuscript
indicates that he may have appended it to the colophon at a later date.

Although the language in the ﬁnal passage is somewhat vague, it seems that
Mirza Mustafa made a transcription of the Nuqtat al-kaf based on a 1268 manu-
script, which he ﬁnished in 1327/1909. Sometime later he added a postscript in
which he says that he obtained a published edition of the Nuqtat al-kaf, compared
it with his transcription, and made emendations based on it. It would seem, there-
fore, that Mirza Mustafa had ﬁnished copying a 1268 manuscript of the Nuqtat
al-kaf and then made emendations to it based on Browne’s 1910 published
version of the text, the only edition of the Nuqtat al-kaf ever published.38

Although we do not fully understand why Mirza Mustafa says that the published
edition of the Nuqtat al-kaf was based on a 1269 manuscript,39 a preliminary survey

NK1327, 171a.

It is possible that this is also the manuscript that Mirza Mustafa mentioned in a letter to
E. G. Browne dated March 9, 1912. In this letter, he tells Browne that he had obtained the published
edition of the Nuqtat al-kaf. Before this time, he writes, he possessed three manuscripts of the
Nuqtat al-kaf : one was a partial copy of one of the Paris manuscripts (loaned to him by Nicolas),
his own defective copy, and a manuscript from “the friends in Naraq” dated 1267/1850 – 1.
Mirza Mustafa then says that he made two complete copies based on these manuscripts and sent
one to the “American College” and the other to Kurdistani (MacEoin, Sources, 145 – 146). Since
Mirza Mustafa’s original letter has been lost and we have to rely on MacEoin’s summary of
Browne’s notes on the letter (for which he gives no archival reference), it is difﬁcult to resolve
the discrepancies between this letter and the colophon of NK1327. First, the dates of the manu-
scripts do not match. It is of course possible that Browne misread the date of the Naraq manuscript
in Mirza Mustafa’s letter; the loss of the original, however, makes it impossible to conclusively
resolve the discrepancy. Second, Mirza Mustafa also mentions that he had sent a copy of the
Nuqtat al-kaf to Kurdistani before seeing Browne’s edition. Perhaps he later retrieved the manu-
script from Kurdistani and compared it with the published version. This would explain why he
later added a ﬁnal postscript to the NK1327 colophon mentioning that he had compared it with
the published text. An alternative explanation is that NK1327 and the copy of the Nuqtat al-kaf
sent to Kurdistani by Mirza Mustafa are two different manuscripts. If these two manuscripts
were identical, Kurdistani would certainly have known that Mirza Mustafa was the scribe of
NK1327, which he does not.

Browne’s manuscripts of the Nuqtat al-kaf are not dated. However, Kurdistani also says that
the published edition is based on a 1269 AH manuscript in Paris; he must be referring to Suppl Pers.
1071, the only complete manuscript of the Nuqtat al-kaf that Browne consulted when preparing his
edition.

of the marginal notations in NK1327 indicate that he had indeed consulted
Browne’s edition and “corrected” it by noting its differences from the 1268 text
in the margins. Further, we believe we have found this 1268 manuscript in the
Princeton Babi collection of Kurdistani (hereafter referred to as NK1268).40
Concerning this manuscript, Kurdistani writes:

> This book is the Nuqtat al-kaf of Mirza Jani Kashi, who was the host of the
> Bab for two nights in Kashan. This manuscript was written in the very year
> they killed Mirza Jani in Tehran, and it is a year older than the manuscript
> in the Louvre museum [muzih-yi lur] in Paris.41 The book which Professor
> Browne published was taken from the manuscript in Paris. Aqa Ayati
> Avarih42 and Aqa Niku43 compared this manuscript with Professor
> Browne’s manuscript and found that they agreed perfectly. Perhaps these
> are the only hand-written manuscripts (of this book) in the world; ﬁrst this
> one, and then the Paris manuscript. For this reason this manuscript is very
> authentic. I secured it with great difﬁculty.44

Although Kurdistani does not tell us how he procured NK1268, we do know
from textual clues that Mirza Mustafa used it as the base text for his transcription,
NK1327. First, Mirza Mustafa mentions in the colophon of NK1327 that he
copied a manuscript dated 1268. To our knowledge, NK1268 is the only manu-
script of the Nuqtat al-kaf that bears this date. The colophon says, “1268—The
Letter Ta’ prepared a clean copy of it (harraraha harf al-ta’).”45 If Mirza
Mustafa was referring to a different manuscript of the Nuqtat al-kaf copied in
1268 it has not yet come to light.

Second, there are marginal notes throughout NK1268 in Mirza Mustafa’s
unmistakable handwriting. These are not corrections to the text but notes of
manuscript variants. Further, the variants listed in the margins of NK1327 and
NK1268 are largely the same and, based on a preliminary survey, it seems that

Vol. 43, Islamic Manuscripts, Third Series, Department of Rare Books and Special Collections,
Princeton University Library. The Princeton cataloger has erroneously dated the manuscript 1248
A.H. The cataloger simply misread a Persian 6 as a 4. The NK1268 manuscript has 181 folios.

Kurdistani is mistaken here. The manuscript was actually held at the Bibliothèque Nationale in
Paris.

‘Abd al-Husayn Ayati (Avarih) was a Baha’i historian who left the religion and later published
an exposé on it called Kashf al-hiyal. In it, he mentions seeing a manuscript of the Nuqtat al-kaf in
Kurdistani’s possession that was written “one year before the death of Hajji Mirza Jani” and iden-
tical to the edition published by Browne. See Kashf al-hiyal, 4th. ed. (Tehran, 1340 Sh./1961), 139,
cited by MacEoin, Sources, 146.

Hasan-i Niku was a Baha’i and a close friend of Avarih who also left the religion and wrote
several tracts against it.

Kurdistani, “Notes,” 5 (we have modiﬁed Miller’s translation). Two scraps of paper bearing
Kurdistani’s handwriting that were found tucked between the pages of the Princeton 1268 text
are further conﬁrmation that he is talking about this manuscript.

NK1268, 180b.

they are derived from Browne’s published version of the Nuqtat al-kaf.46 For
example, in Browne’s edition it says that the mother of Quddus, the most
prominent follower of the Bab, was “three-months pregnant and a virgin” (sih
mahih hamilih bud va dukhtar ham bud ) when she married her husband.47 This
phrase is not found in the main texts of NK1268 or NK1327 but is noted in the
margins of both manuscripts in Mirza Mustafa’s handwriting.48 This further
reinforces our theory that Mirza Mustafa’s reference to a published edition of
the Nuqtat al-kaf in the colophon of NK1327 refers to Browne’s edition.

Third, Mirza Mustafa says that the 1268 text from Kashan which he consulted
had spelling errors and mistakes (bi imla’ va maghlut) which the author apologized
for in the beginning of the book.49 This is certainly an accurate description of the
text of NK1268. The text contains a signiﬁcant amount of spelling mistakes which
indicate that the author was not highly literate in either Persian or Arabic. Thus
the author breaks up verbal elements at the end of a line and continues them on
the next line, something an educated man or a professional scribe would not do.
Moreover, the author must have been a native Persian speaker because he often
writes Persian words and Arabic loanwords as they are spoken, not written. Thus
instead of         ,50        instead of      ,51 and             instead of

. Further, he often drops the Persian silent ( ) as evidenced by his
spelling of (      ) and (       ).53 Additionally, the author writes several place
names in an unconventional fashion. Thus Bushruyih is written as
rather than           ,54 Chihriq, the fortress where the Bab was imprisoned in
the latter part of his ministry, is found as           and not as      ,55 and Uru-

miyya is written as          and not as the more standard        . Therefore, while
we are not sure who penned NK1268, we can say that it was not prepared by a
well-educated man or a professional scribe.

A fourth clue that Mirza Mustafa consulted NK1268 is that many of its unique
phrases are found in NK1327 and not in the two Paris manuscripts (although
we concede that they could appear in manuscripts we have not yet consulted).
One interesting example is found in the account of a dream that the Prince

For example, the handwriting and content of the marginal notes in NK1268 (12b, 72b, 98b) are
identical to those in NK1327 (11b, 64b, 88b). These notes are all based on the published edition of
the Nuqtat al-kaf.

NK1268, 137b; NK1327, 125a.

This apology must not have been part of the Nuqtat al-kaf proper since Mirza Mustafa does not
transcribe it in his NK1327. Moreover, we have not been able to ﬁnd this apology in the text of
NK1268 or any other manuscript.

Mihdi Quli Mirza had about the Bab. In it, the prince dreamt that he was part of
the honor guard of Muhammad Shah. When a young Sayyid approached the
monarch, Muhammad Shah became highly anxious and identiﬁed the man as
Sayyid-i Bab. He ordered those around him to arrest the Bab as he believed
that he had come to kill him, but no one noticed. The Bab then approached
the Shah, ﬁred a handgun (tapanchih), and killed the monarch.57 In the Princeton
manuscripts the word used for the handgun is pishtabi, which is a much more anti-
quated term.58

Another example occurs in that portion of the narrative which details the exam-
ination of the Bab in Tabriz in the presence of the Crown-Prince Nasir al-Din
Shah. The Browne edition suggests that the maternal uncle of Nasir al-Din,
Amir Arslan Khan, was especially hostile to the Bab and challenged him on a
few occasions.59 Both NK1268 and NK1327 make no mention of Amir Arslan
Khan and merely refer to him as kasi (someone).60

Finally, it should be noted that Mirza Mustafa was very faithful to the text of
NK1268; we were only able to ﬁnd one difference between it and NK1327 that
cannot be explained by a normal scribal error. This discrepancy is illuminating
since he clariﬁes the language of the original in favor of Baha’u’llah and not
Subh Azal. When detailing the childhood of Subh Azal, NK1268 reads:

> However, his [Subh Azal’s] mother died in childhood and his mother was a
> special wife. His father tells his honored wife [Baha’u’llah’s mother] to
> watch over this child so that the maids serve him well.61

Compare the above with NK1327, which reads:

> However, his mother dies when he was still a child. His father placed him in the
> care of his special, honored wife and tells (her) to watch over this child so that
> the maids serve him well.62

Here, Mirza Mustafa clariﬁes the rather vague phrase about the death of the
mother and then designates Baha’u’llah’s mother, not Subh Azal’s, as a special
(khassih) and honored wife.63

Now that we have demonstrated that Mirza Mustafa used NK1268 when
preparing his 1327 copy, we will consider the authenticity of its date. For most
scholars, a dated colophon is sufﬁcient for dating a manuscript. However, since

The word used for wife here is kawch. The word khassih is more problematic but it may indicate
a ﬁrst wife (for example, see Steingass under khass mahal ).

the provenance of Nuqtat al-kaf is so controversial we will provide additional evi-
dence that suggests there is no convincing reason to question the authenticity of
the date of NK1268.

The early date of NK1268 cannot be proven or refuted based on the manuscript
paper. There are only two folios that bear watermarks: 128 and 144.64 Although
these watermarks clearly indicate the British origin of these two folios, the paucity
of distinguishing signs and the current state of Iranian ﬁligranology make it
impossible for us to cull a date from these pages at the present time. The rest
of the paper seems to be of local origin.65

This lack of conclusive physical evidence leaves us with internal clues as to its
early date. First, various passages in both the published and manuscript forms of
the Nuqtat al-kaf indicate that it was written before the Baha’i-Azali split in the
1860s. Second, linguistic evidence indicates that NK1268 is an early copy of
the original manuscript of the Nuqtat al-kaf. While this alone does not prove
that it was written in 1268, it does indicate that it existed prior to every other
known manuscript.

Juan Cole has argued that Browne’s edition of the Nuqtat al-kaf contains redac-
tions made to the text during the Baha’i-Azali split in the 1860s.66 In 1863,
Baha’u’llah told a small number of followers that he was the messianic ﬁgure fore-
told by the Bab, manyuzhiruhullah (“Him Whom God shall make manifest”), a
claim rejected by Subh Azal and his followers when it became more public in
the ensuing decade. If, as Cole suggests, the book was altered or redacted after
1863, one would expect the text to show some signs of this split; in other
words, Subh Azal would be extolled and Baha’u’llah would be excoriated.

A close reading of NK1268 and Browne’s published manuscript exhibits no
trace of this split. While there are glowing statements about Subh Azal, this is
to be expected from a text written in the early 1850s when he was hailed as the
Bab’s nominee for leadership of the community. Moreover, the three versions
of the Nuqtat al-kaf under consideration also contain effusive statements about
Baha’u’llah; such phrases should not appear in a book allegedly redacted by
Azali-Babis after 1863. Thus the author describes Baha’u’llah as “a person with
perfections (kamal), with a command of the subjects pertaining to the Unity of
God (tawhid), and possessor of praiseworthy attributes and desired character-
istics.”67 Another example occurs in the portion of the narrative that deals
with the mystic Basir. The author describes Basir as attaining “the grace of the
presence of the manifest light of Jinab-i Baha’ al-Imkan” ( fayd-i hudur-i bahir-i
al-nur-i jinab-i baha’ al-imkan). The author goes on to say “the emanations of the

Both pages have chain lines and both have scrolls with words pertaining to the size of the
paper. Page 144 reads “UNIVERSAL” while page 128 says “FOOLSCAP.” 144 also contains a
very faint coat-of-arms.

There are two identical, oval imprints on 154a and 169a that seem to contain English letters,
but they are too faint for the naked eye to distinguish.

lordship of that glory of paradise (baha’ al-ridwan) were manifested in his temple of
servitude.”68

A few authors have also argued that some passages in the Nuqtat al-kaf contain
anachronistic language; hence, they are later additions. For example, the author of
the Nuqtat al-kaf states that Babism had spread to Anatolia, India, and Turkistan
and that there is a group of Babis in Istanbul.69 Moojan Momen argues that this
passage is a later addition because the movement did not spread to these regions
until after 1863.70 This argument, however, is not convincing since this state-
ment—which is found in all of the manuscripts of the Nuqtat al-kaf we have con-
sulted, including NK1268—could just as easily be the result of hyperbole or
rumor rather than later redaction.

Finally, all of the contemporary authors who have written about the Nuqtat al-
kaf have accepted that it is a composite of an earlier theological treatise and a
history of the Babi movement written in 1270/1853 at the earliest. These dates
are based on Tabataba’i’s observation that the author of the historical section
of Nuqtat al-kaf mentions that 1270 years have passed since the hijra of Muham-
mad while the author of the theological section mentions that 1277 years have
passed since the ba‘tha (Muhammad’s call to prophethood in 610 AD), which
would make the date 1267/1850– 51.71 We concede that the date of 1267 is too
precise to be dismissed; yet it does not invalidate the date in the colophon of
NK1268. On the other hand, the date of 1270 (1853– 4), if accepted at face
value, does invalidate the date of the colophon of NK1268. However, the date
is suspiciously round and comes at the end of a long passage detailing the
growing power of Islam after its humble beginnings; thus, such a number
seems to be more of a rhetorical device than a hard and fast date. In a similar rhe-
torical ﬂourish, the author of the Nuqtat al-kaf scolds Muslims in another passage
for still waiting, after a period of 1270 years, for the appearance of the Qa’im
when his theophany has already arrived.72 To argue, based on the previous
instance of 1270, that these two works were written at different times by different
individuals and then combined into a single work around 1853 seems imprudent,
particularly when proponents of this view have offered no persuasive linguistic
evidence or anachronistic historical references to corroborate it.

In fact, there are historical references in the text which indicate that the histori-
cal section was written between 1851 and 1852. Thus the author of the Nuqtat
al-kaf reports that during the siege of Zanjan, the leader of the Babi forces Mulla
Muhammad Zanjani despaired of reaching a peace accord with Amir Kabir and
wrote to foreign powers, including the Ottomans and Russians, asking them to
intercede on behalf of the Babis. The author of the Nuqtat al-kaf then observes

Momen, The Babi and Baha’i and Baha’i Religions, p. 34; Cole repeats the same argument (“Nuqtat
al-Kaf and the Babi Chronicle Traditions,” online).

See footnote 3.

that one of the factors contributing to the Amir’s later dismissal was his harsh treat-
ment of the Babis during this time.73 We know that Amir Kabir was ﬁrst dismissed
from his premiership on November 6, 1851 and was removed from military
command shortly thereafter on November 21, 1851.74 We also know that he was
murdered by imperial decree in Kashan on January 13, 1852 and that the news of
his (supposedly natural) death was publicly announced in the Vaqayi ‘-i ittifaqiyyih
on January 30, 1852.75 One would expect that if the author of the Nuqtat al-kaf was
writing after January 1852, he would have mentioned the death of Amir Kabir and
not just referred to his dismissal; it would simply have been too important a polem-
ical point for him to ignore. This evidence, therefore, dates the writing of the his-
torical section of the Nuqtat al-kaf (or at least this portion) to the interval between
November 6, 1851 and January 30, 1852 (corresponding to 10 Muharram 1268– 18
Rabi‘ al-Awwal 1268).

Having argued that there is nothing in the Nuqtat al-kaf that conclusively dates
the genesis of its historical portion to 1853 or corroborates the assertion that material
was added to it in the 1860s, we will now present linguistic evidence in NK1268
which indicates that it was one of the ﬁrst copies of the original manuscript. In
drawing conclusions on the basis of this evidence we are operating on the assump-
tion that a manuscript which does not have lacunae but does have gross spelling
mistakes and unreﬁned language is older than manuscripts which have lacunae
but few spelling errors and more reﬁned prose; in other words, a reﬁned, but some-
times garbled, text is evidence of redaction by professional scribes or literati.

As we demonstrated earlier, NK1268 contains a number of spelling mistakes
which are not the common errors of a scribe but of an author who is not well edu-
cated. A brief comparison of NK1268 with NK1327 and Browne’s edition indi-
cates that many of these spelling errors were corrected in later copies; for
example, they do not appear in Mirza Mustafa’s NK1327 even though he
acknowledges that they were there originally.

In addition to this, there is language in NK1268 that suits the temperament of
an uneducated author but not the reﬁned sensibilities of a well-educated scribe or
member of the literati. The coarseness of this language prompted at least one
person to polish a few of its passages since there is evidence of some words
being marked through and corrections written above them. This must have
been rather early since a number of these changes were incorporated into later
manuscripts. One noteworthy example is in the section of the narrative that
deals with Ashraf Khan, the governor of Zanjan. The story as recorded in the
published version of Nuqtat al-kaf is that Ashraf Khan had a forced sexual
encounter with a married woman from Zanjan.76 Once the husband informed

his acquaintances, they mobilized the masses who stormed his residence and
looted it. The crowd then seized the governor, “did an indecent act to him”
(ba u ‘amal-i bad mikunand), and expelled him from the city.77 In contrast, the
author of NK1268 had originally left nothing to our imagination; he writes,
“they sodomized him (livat mikunand)” (93a). However, it appears that the
person who later corrected NK1268 crossed out this offensive phrase (although
it is still visible) and replaced it with (ba u ‘amal-i bad mikunand). This euphemism
is carried over into NK1327 and Browne’s edition.

Another example of unreﬁned language in NK1268 that was polished by the
anonymous editor is a line of poetry recited by Mirza Qurban ‘Ali, a famous
mystic with connections to the Qajar court who was arrested and executed for
being a Babi. All versions of the Nuqtat al-kaf relate that he uttered a poem when his
turban fell to the ground after the executioner failed to sever his neck with the ﬁrst
sword blow. According to the original text of NK1268, he recited this line of poetry:

> Well is it with that drunk who, at the feet of the beloved,
> Knoweth not whether to throw his head or scarf.78

After saying these lines, he was struck a second time and died.

The above verse is a variant from a ghazal of Haﬁz.79 The editor of NK 1268

inserted halat after khusha, rendering the poetry closer to the original verse by
Haﬁz. Mirza Mustafa accepted this change and transcribed it in NK1327.80
Browne’s manuscript, however, had clearly been redacted at some point by a
scribe with a more Suﬁ bent. Thus an ‘ashiq (lover) is added to the ﬁrst stanza
and mast (a drunk) is changed into sarmast (intoxicated one):

> Well is it with that intoxicated lover who, at the feet of his beloved,
> Knoweth not whether to cast his head or scarf.81

The most likely explanation for these changes is that the author of the text on
which NK1268 is based wrote a line of Haﬁz from memory. The scribe of

See Muhammad Taqi Lisan ul-Mulk Sipihr Kashani, Nasikh al-tawarikh (Tehran, 1377) 1:913–
914\. The events in Zanjan and the fate of its governor as narrated by Sipihr appears to be more
cautious (and perhaps more accurate) than the version narrated by the Nuqtat al-kaf. Sipihr, for
instance, does not mention that the woman was married, nor does he mention that the governor
was sodomized. On the other hand, the more embellished account presented in the Nuqtat al-kaf
may have been based on popular gossip.

NK1268, 148b.

Divan-i Haﬁz, ed. Muhammad Qazvini and Qasim Qani (Sina, Tehran, nd.), 102:

NK1268 did not change anything but the later editor of NK1268 was not so cir-
cumspect; thus, he added a word to bring it closer to the line of Haﬁz (or perhaps
it reﬂects another popular variant then in circulation). By the time Browne’s
manuscripts were copied, the poetry had been further redacted by someone
with Suﬁ sensibilities.

Of course, it could be argued that the editor of NK1268 is not correcting the
text based on his own literary sensibilities but according to a different manuscript
tradition. Thus, he is not making changes that are then passed from NK1268 to
later manuscripts but is using later manuscripts to make changes to NK1268.
Even if we accept this as a possibility, it does not invalidate the early date of
the manuscript or its priority to other manuscripts of the Nuqtat al-kaf.

In addition to editorial changes that were passed on to later manuscripts,
NK1268 also preserves older material that has not been obscured by scribal
errors. For example, in the section on the Babi uprising at Fort Shaykh Tabarsi
we read on page 169 of Browne’s published edition that Prince Mihdi Quli
Mirza and ‘Abbas-Quli Khan joined forces and began building fortiﬁcations.
The Browne version reads va bi-asbab tartib dadan mashghul gardidand (“they got
busy building equipment”), which seems garbled. In NK1268 and NK1327,
however, it reads bastiyan tartib dadan mashghul gardidand (“they got busy building
bastions”), which makes perfect sense.82

Taken together, the spelling mistakes, coarse language, and better-preserved
text of NK1268 indicate that it is not the product of a series of redactions like
Browne’s edition; rather, it conﬁrms that this manuscript is earlier than any of
the other manuscripts that have come to light thus far. This being said, it is
important to bear in mind that the cumulative differences between NK1268
and Browne’s edition are minimal. Thus, while Browne based his edition on a
manuscript tradition that had been edited, the editing seems to have been con-
ﬁned to correcting spelling mistakes and improving some passages of poetry.

In the foregoing we have suggested that NK1268 is earlier than any other
recension of the Nuqtat al-kaf that has yet been discovered. Even more tantaliz-
ing, it may be a copy of the original manuscript of the Nuqtat al-kaf. The stron-
gest argument that it is a copy of the original draft of the Nuqtat al-kaf is that the
spelling errors and coarse language are preserved. This indicates that it has not
been redacted by professional scribes or the literati. Moreover, it does not have
the garbled passages that are found in later manuscripts, again indicating that it
is a copy of the original that has not been redacted.

We believe it is a copy of the original draft and not the original draft itself for
two reasons. First, in folio 126a there is clear evidence that the scribe’s eyes have
slipped down the page he was copying; he crosses out his mistake, resumes
writing, and places the passage in the correct spot. Second, in the colophon the
scribe writes “The Letter Ta’ prepared a clean copy of it (harraraha harf al-ta’).”

NK1268, 118a; NK1327, 106b. See Dekhoda’s entry on bastiyan.

The Arabic verb harrara is used when a scribe is making a clean copy from a rough
draft.83

Who was the “Letter Ta’ ?” We know that he was probably a Babi based on
his moniker. Arabic letters were a centerpiece of the Bab’s cosmology; he even
called his ﬁrst eighteen disciples “The Letters of the Living (huruf al-hayy).”
Some well-known Babis were also known by the ﬁrst letter of their name; for
example, Mulla Muhammad Ja‘far Naraqi, a prominent Babi in the 1850s, was
known as “the Letter Jim.”84 This type of moniker also seemed to be somewhat
in vogue among Babi/Baha’i scribes. Thus Zayn al-Muqarribin (see above)
signed his colophons as “The Letter Za’.”85 This being said, we are not given
any obvious clues as to what name “the Letter Ta’ ” stood for.

Although we have posited that the mysterious “Letter Ta’ ” made a clean
copy of the Nuqtat al-kaf in 1268 and we have surmised that the source of his
draft was the original Nuqtat al-kaf, we do not know who wrote the original
draft. One possibility is that the “Letter Ta’ ” wrote it and then made a clean
copy. This is not unusual since authors of manuscripts often produced a draft
copy and then made a clean copy for distribution. It could also have been
written by someone else.86

Regrettably, the scribe of NK1268 does not help us out of our dilemma but
leaves us with an enigmatic statement at the top of the ﬁrst page: tawhid-i farmay-
ish-i jinab-i hajji. Tawhid (the unity of God) is, of course, the cornerstone of
Muslim dogmatics but its role in this passage is unclear. The other words are
clearer: “the sayings of Jinab-i Hajji.” The scribe of NK1268 has therefore attrib-
uted the Nuqtat al-kaf to a certain Jinab-i Hajji, but he has not made it clear if it
was written by this man or just based on his oral statements.

Who was “Jinab-i Hajji” and what relationship did he have to the Nuqtat al-
kaf? In the introduction we noted that E. G. Browne ﬁrst ascribed the authorship
of the Nuqtat al-kaf to Hajji Mirza Jani and that later authors have disputed this.
MacEoin and Tabataba’i have argued that the historical portion of the Nuqtat
al-kaf was probably written by someone else around 1270/1853 based on Jani’s
notes and then combined with an earlier theological treatise.87 Amanat and

Two pages from the original text by this author might survive as part of NK1268. As men-
tioned above, folios 128 and 144 are the only pages with watermarks. They are also written in a
different handwriting than the rest of the manuscript. Are these original pages of the ﬁrst draft
of the Nuqtat al-kaf? As stated above, we have not yet been able to date the watermarks so we
do not know when these pages were added to NK1268; thus, it is also possible that they are
later additions to the text, perhaps replacing damaged pages.

Tabataba’i conjectured that it was written by Hajji Muhammad Rida’ (“Kitabi bi nam,” 958,
960). MacEoin surmises that the historical portion of the Nuqtat al-kaf was written in Baghdad
in 1270/1853 – 54 by two or three people and an earlier theological treatise was later added to it
(Sources, 151).

Cole have accepted that an earlier theological treatise and a history written around
1853 were combined in the early 1850s; however, Amanat allows for the possi-
bility of later redaction while Cole maintains that it was deﬁnitely redacted in
the 1860s.88 Leaving aside the issue of the dating of the historical portion of
the Nuqtat al-kaf and its relation to the theological section, the marginal note
of NK1268 indicates that it, or at least the theological portion, was based on
the sayings of a venerable “Hajji;” whether or not this is Mirza Jani is still an
open question. Moreover, the textual priority of NK1268—irrespective of the
date of its colophon—and the absence of heavy redaction in later manuscripts
invalidate Cole’s contention that material was added to the Nuqtat al-kaf in the
1860s.

The exact identity of the author and the scribe of NK1268 is still a mystery, but
perhaps the date of the manuscript and the moniker of the scribe will help answer
the question of authorship in the future. While we would like to produce a new
critical edition of the Nuqtat al-kaf based on NK1268 and NK1327 and conﬁrm
our preliminary ﬁndings, we already know that the ﬁnal product will not be dras-
tically different from Browne’s published text. If our ﬁndings are veriﬁed, then the
Nuqtat al-kaf is indisputably early and free of later doctrinal distortions. Thus, it
is not only valuable as an authentic source for early Babi history but also as a
window into the mind of a Babi in 1851 or 1852 who tried to give meaning to
the history of his religion shortly after the death of its founder.

Amanat argues that the historical portion was written by one or more authors (including Hajji
Mirza Jani) in the early 1850s but also says it is possible that some parts may have been edited in the
1860s, particularly those pertaining to the immediate period after the Bab’s death (Resurrection, 423).
Cole also accepts that there was a version of the Nuqtat al-kaf containing both the historical and
theological treatises in the early 1850s, but argues that it was deﬁnitely redacted in the 1860s
