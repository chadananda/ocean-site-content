The Kitáb-i Aqdas of Mírzá Husain `Alí Núrí, Bahá'u'lláh:

Redating its Beginnings

Kamran Ekbal

"Various petitions have come before Our throne from the believers, concerning laws
from God, the Lord of the seen and the unseen, the Lord of all worlds. We have, in
consequence, revealed this Holy Tablet and arrayed it with the mantle of His Law that haply
the people may keep the commandments of their Lord. Similar requests had been made of Us
over several previous years but We had, in Our wisdom, withheld Our Pen until, in recent
days, letters arrived from a number of friends, and We have therefore responded, through the
power of truth, with that which shall quicken the hearts of men."1

In 1992, the centenary of Mírzá Husain `Alí Núrí, Bahá'u'lláh (1817-1892), the founder
of the Bahá'í faith, and more than 120 years after it was written during the early period of his
banishment to `Akká (1868-1892), the first authorized translation of the Kitáb-i Aqdas, "The
Most Holy Book" and "Book of Laws" of his dispensation was published by the Bahá'í World
Centre in Haifa. Although an annotated summary with an introduction and selected
translations by Shoghi Effendi (1897-1957), the great-grandson of Bahá'u'lláh and "Guardian
of the Cause", was issued in 1973 by the Universal House of Justice, the supreme
administrative body of the Bahá'ís2, for many years efforts to produce an acceptable
translation had been checked.

In a letter dated 2 May 1947 and written on behalf of Shoghi Effendi, the preparation of
a translation was categorically prohibited. It was indicated that he, Shoghi Effendi, "does not

original Arabic text, together with its Persian supplement (Risála-i Su'ál wa Jawáb) and Persian
annotations was published by the Universal House of Justice, Bahá'í World Center, Haifa 1995.

want (it) translated at present". Since the Aqdas was not yet promulgated and since it was not
yet possible to enforce all its laws and provisions, it was considered "premature to let it fall
into the hands of the public"3. The Universal House of Justice confirms this fact and states:
"From various letters written on behalf of the Guardian, it is apparent that he did not consider
the time had yet arrived for the publication of the Kitáb-i-Aqdas, seeing fit only to release
certain of its provisions concerning matters of personal status and a number of its more
general passages such as those addressed to the kings"4. Bahá'u'lláh himself had also
dissuaded from translating his book of laws and warned: "Although the intention of the
translator was good, such an action in these days will lead to differences and is therefore not
permissible"5.

The genesis of the Kitáb-i Aqdas is enveloped in obscurity. The exact circumstances
under which it came into being are far from being clear. Bahá'í and non-Bahá'í sources give
contradictory information regarding the date of its composition. These range from 1870 to
1875\. Only few try to support their respective dates with evidence. It is the aim of this paper
to demonstrate that the Kitáb-i Aqdas was not written on one and the same occasion, but
constitutes a process which started at least in 1868 with the arrival of Bahá'u'lláh in the
citadel of `Akká and continued over a period of five years or more and in different locations.

The main copies and editions of the Kitáb-i Aqdas

The first edition of the Kitáb-i Aqdas, more correctly al-Kitáb al-Aqdas, since it is
written completely in Arabic and was designated as such by Bahá'u'lláh in his Arabic
writings, was published during the lifetime of its author as al-Kitáb al-Aqdas, together with a
selection of "tablets" (lawh, pl.alwáh), in a volume of 380 pages in Bombay in 1308
AH/1890-16. According to Shoghi Effendi another volume, of which little is known, was

in a Memorandum of the Research Department of the Universal House of Justice (UHJ), 25 Apr.1995:

quoted in this paper are in the private papers of the author.

6       Al-Kitáb al-Aqdas wa nabdha min alwáh Bahá'u'lláh, published at the Dutt Prashad Press
belonging to one of the Afnan kinsmen of the Báb. It was lithographed and the copyist was Hájjí
Mírzá Husain of Shiraz, cf. Edward Granville Browne: Materials for the Study of the Babi Religion,
Cambridge 1918, repr. 1961, p.195. For other examples of the Arabic designation of the Aqdas cf. one
of Bahá'u'lláhs tablets in: `Abdu'l-Hamíd Ishráq-Kháwarí (compiler): Rahíq-i Makhtúm, vol.2,
n.p.(Tehran) 131 A.B.(1974), p.337f., and another tablet addressed to Mír `Abdu'r-Rahím in:
Majmú`a-í az alwáh-i jamál-i aqdas-i abhá ki ba`d az Kitáb-i Aqdas názil shuda, Langenhain 1980,
p.168. During the early period of his ministry Shoghi Effendi, too, preferred the Arabic version and
used to write Kitábu'l-Aqdas, cf.Rúhíyyih Rabbání: The Priceless Pearl, London 1969, p.205; Adib
Taherzadeh: The Revelation of Bahá'u'lláh,vol.1-4, Oxford 1988, vol.3, p.345.

published in `Ishqábád 7. Persumably two versions were published in Bombay, the second
one being a slender book containing the text of the Aqdas only8. Another edition was then
published in Bombay during the ministry of Bahá'u'lláh's eldest son and successor, `Abdu'l-
Bahá' (1844-1921), in 1314 A.H./1896 consisting of 263 pages and including a number of
other tablets of Bahá'u'lláh; then again of 178 pages during the period of Shoghi Effendi,
probably without his consent. The 1896 edition may thus have been the last official issue,
since Shoghi Effendi let all copies of another edition of the Aqdas, ordered to be printed by
Sulaymán Raf`at in Beirut 1945, be sent together with the printing plates to the World Centre
at Haifa9.

The Kitáb-i Aqdas was also published in Baghdad in 1931 with a polemical preface by
its editor Khadúrí Ilyás `Ináyat10. Bahá'ís of the East refrained, according to the wish of
Shoghi Effendi, from publishing new editions. Nevertheless, copies were made and
distributed among the believers.

The first summary translation of the Kitáb-i Aqdas was published during Bahá'u'lláhs
lifetime by Edward G. Browne in the Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society 188911, and the
first full translation into a European language, Russian, was published together with the
Arabic text, by Alexandr Tumanskij in 189912. The only other translation was then prepared
by the two Presbyterian missionaries Earl E. Elder and William M. Miller in 196113. The
translation, although complete, is not always correct, especially in regard to the notes14. It
may also prove exigent that the new 1992 authorized translation will also have to be
reexamined in regard to the accuracy of some of its terms. This is especially the case
regarding the interpretative rendering of "bilád" (actually: land/lands,or country/countries)

into "world" in the only passage of the Aqdas (Aq.42) in which a reference, not necessarily
contained in the original Arabic, was thus introduced to the institution of the "Universal"
(bilád!) House of Justice and to its being established by Bahá'u'lláh in his Kitáb-i Aqdas.
Beside this and a number of other inaccurate translations, the English edition of 1992
generally refrains from giving references concerning the Islamic background and the Koranic
origins of major parts of the Aqdas and its termini technici in order to avoid "the impression
of a work that was peculiarly Oriental in its outlook, scope and aims"15.

The genesis of the Kitáb-i Aqdas

The exact circumstances surrounding the genesis of the Kitáb-i Aqdas are not clear.

Although hundreds of Bahá'u'lláh's writings are available in his own hand, no copy of the
Kitáb-i Aqdas was produced, to our knowledge, in his own handwriting. One early copy
seems to be in the hand of `Abdu'l-Bahá'16 and may be taken to indicate that it was dictated to
him by Bahá'u'lláh. Another copy in the hand of Zaynu'l -Muqarrabín, a former mujtahid and
one of the noted companions of Bahá'u'lláh esteemed especially for his calligraphy and whose
questions on the Kitáb-i Aqdas together with Bahá'u'lláh's answers constitute an appendix to
Kitáb-i Aqdas17, was designated by `Abdu'l-Bahá' as authentic, whereas the printed version -
probably the edition published in Bombay in 1308/1890-91 in the handwriting of `Abdu'l-
Bahá's half-brother Muhammad `Alí, which was published again in letter-press in 1314/1896-
97 - was regarded by him to have been manipulated18. The copy used by Earl E.Elder for his
translation and indicated to have been autographed by `Abdu'l-Bahá' and presented by him to
one of the first American Bahá'ís who had visited him in Palestine, is, according to a
statement by the Research Department of the Universal House of Justice, identical with the
1308/1890-91 Bombay edition in the handwriting of Muhammad `Alí19. Whereas the copies

Bahá's handwriting, whereas pages 24-57 are in the handwriting of Muhammad Jawád-i Qazwíní, cf.

of `Abdu'l-Bahá' and Zaynu'l-Muqarrabín were produced in 1880 and may thus be regarded
as the earliest copies available, another manuscript in the handwriting of Zaynu'l-Muqarrabín,
probably his latest, dated 31 December 1900 and deviating from the foregoing ones, was used
as the basic text for the translated edition of 1992, as it was the copy relied upon by Shoghi
Effendi and used by him for his translations!20 Although some differences exist between the
various issues of the Kitáb-i Aqdas - one major discrepancy that was noted in the "`Abdu'l-
Bahá'" text, is, e.g. that Aq.190, forbidding the use of opium, was not included21 - and some
were obviously manipulated, no thorough study has yet been made of this matter. It may also
prove exigent to investigate the problems arising from using a manuscript prepared eight
years after the death of Bahá'u'lláh and neglecting the earlier ones produced during his
lifetime, partly even by his own son and successor `Abdu'l-Bahá'.

Besides the Questions and Answers, the Tablets of Bahá'u'lláh Revealed After The Kitáb-
i Aqdas22 are considered to be supplements (mutammimát) of the Kitáb-i Aqdas. These
supplementary laws, however, are incomplete. Some of them in the pen of Bahá'u'lláh were
e.g. among the papers of `Abdu'l-Bahá' that were stolen by his half-brother Mírzá
Muhammad `Alí23 and appear to be still missing. One may thus conclude that the Kitáb-i
Aqdas together with its supplements, as they exist today, are not the complete and final
versions.

Little is known about the precise circumstances under which the Kitáb-i Aqdas came into
being. `Abdu'l-Bahá' e.g. gives no information concerning the copy in his own handwriting as
to whether it was dictated to him by Bahá'u'lláh, and if so, when, where and under what
conditions. Some evidence may lead, however, to the conclusion, that the Kitáb-i Aqdas was
written, respectively dictated by Bahá'u'lláh, not at one point in time, but over a period lasting
several years. In one letter written in the hand of his most prominent amanuensis Mírzá Aqá
Ján, surnamed "Khádimu'lláh",24 and addressed to `ain-lám qabl-i Akbar, i.e. Hájjí Mullá `Alí
Akbar Shahmírzádí "Hájjí Akhúnd",25 Bahá'u'lláh states that during his sojourn in Adrianople
(1863-1868) he had revealed a number of laws in Persian in response to the questions of

24      Most of the writings of Bahá'u'lláh were dictated to one of his several amanuensis and then,
though not always, confirmed and sealed by himself. On Mírzá Aqá Ján, who later became a
"covenant-breaker", i.e. someone who according to Bahá'í terminology denies the line of succession
of Bahá'u'lláh, and later of `Abdu'l-Bahá', Shoghi Effendi and the Universal House of Justice,

some of his adherents, but that he had not released them (irsál nashud)26. In this letter dated
15 Jumádí I. 1290A.H./11 July 1873 mention is made that "in these days (dar ín ayyám) the
Kitáb-i Aqdas ... was revealed (názil)" - a statement that has been generally regarded in
Bahá'í sources as an indication for the dating of the Kitáb-i Aqdas. Nevertheless, and with
good reason, both Bahá'í and non-Bahá'í sources remain uncertain about the exact date.

In his introdoction to the 1961 translation of the Kitáb-i Aqdas, W. Miller states that it is
not possible to determine the exact date of its writing. Nevertheless, he suggests that the
probable date was 187527. In his more recent and polemical work, The Baha'i Faith (1973),
Miller avoids the date issue completely. Hermann Roemer, on the other hand, mentions "the
first years of the seventies"28, whereas neither Ignaz Goldziher, nor John Richards29, or, as far
as I can see, E.G.Browne, give any dates.

Shoghi Effendi's statement in God Passes By, his review of Bahá'í history, that the Kitáb-
i Aqdas had been "Revealed soon after Bahá'u'lláh had been transferred to the house of `Udí
Khammár (circa 1873)"30 was most probably relying upon the above mentioned tablet of
Bahá'u'lláh to Hájjí Akhúnd dated July 1873, which had mentioned the book as having been
revealed "in these days". The formulation - "(circa 1873)" - shows that even Shoghi Effendi
was not sure of the exact date. In the same manner the Universal House of Justice, in its
introduction to the authorized translation of 1992, mentions it being revealed "around
1873"31. Adib Taherzadeh alludes that it was revealed "In the early part of 1873"32, Peter
Smith writes "about 1873"33 and Nusratu'lláh Husainí states "around 1873" (dar hudúd)34.

The renown Bahá'í scholar `Abdu'l-Hamíd Ishráq-Kháwarí, on the other hand, dispenses
altogether with referring to the ambiguities surrounding the date and gives "in 1873 and
A.H.1287" (bi-sál-i 1873 wa 1287 A.H.)35. He seems unaware of the fact that 1287 A.H.
began on 3 April 1870 and has nothing to do with 1873! On another occasion he mentions the

authors. When the barracks where Bahá'u'lláh and his family were incarcerated were needed for
housing Ottoman soldiers in late 1870, the prisoners were allowed to leave for better quarters within
the city. From Sept.1871 till late 1873 Bahá'u'lláh lived in the house of `Udí (probably either `Udayy
or `Awda) Khammár, a well-off Christian merchant of `Akká, cf.A Basic Bahá'í Dictionary, ed. by

Kitáb-i Aqdas as having been revealed "towards the end of 1287" and, taking Aq.86 where an
allusion is made to the defeat of Napoleon III at the battle of Sedan (2 September 1870),
concludes, this time more correctly, that the book must have been revealed around that time,
i.e. 187036. His statements that the Kitáb-i Aqdas was revealed in the hand of(bi-khatt-i)
Bahá'u'lláh and that it has been preserved ever since and is available (maujúd)37 also seem
unreliable.

Information on the concomitant circumstances surrounding the genesis of the Kitáb-i
Aqdas is also controversial. Taherzadeh, who had mentioned that it was revealed "In the early
part of 1873,"38 observes that this was during the same year of `Abdu'l-Bahá's marriage39. But
according to the same author the marriage took place in 187240 !

Some other authors writing from a Bahá'í point of view are more cautious in regard to
the dating of the Aqdas. Whereas Hasan Balyuzi e.g. states that it was "in the year 1873 ...
that Bahá'u'lláh completed the revelation of the Kitáb-i Aqdas"41, Fádil-i Mázandarání
maintains that the revelation was completed about 1288 A.H./1871-7242. The prominent
Bahá'í author Muhammad `Alí Faidí refrains altogether from giving any date43.

Inspite of such uncertainties concerning the exact date, other Bahá'í sources seem to be
gradually letting this fact fall into oblivion. In their interpretative presentations they now state
apodictically that it was revealed "in 1873"44.

Some authors now admit that the Kitáb-i Aqdas was most probably not written on one
and the same occasion, but that its genesis has been a gradual process. Amír Farhang Imání
e.g. gives "1871-1873" as the period in which the revelation of the book took place45, and
Wahìd Ra'fatí designates a period running from "1287-1291 A.H.( 1870-1874 )"46. The
Research Department at the Bahá'í World Centre seems to be unaware of this statement of
one of its own members, when it maintains "that the revelation of the Kitáb-i Aqdas did not
span a period of years, that the book was revealed no earlier than 1871-72"47.

The time span given for the genesis of the Kitáb-i Aqdas in some Bahá'í sources
stretches thus from 1870 to 1874, non-Bahá'í sources, e.g. Miller, go even further and give
1875\. An examination of the primary sources of Bahá'u'lláh's own writings, supported by
those of `Abdu'l-Bahá', could now produce evidence that the Kitáb-i Aqdas has been the
result of a gradual process, the beginnings of which must inevitably be traced back to 1868.

In a letter to Jamál-i Burújirdí, one of his prominent adherents who later became a
"covenant-breaker", i.e. one who renounced `Abdu'l-Bahá's claim to the succession,
Bahá'u'lláh mentions that even after the process of revelation had been completed, the book
was kept back by him and concealed (mastúr) "for a number of years", before he, upon the
insistence of some of his followers, released a copy of it48. In Aq.98, quoted at the beginning
of this paper, it is also mentioned that the book had been revealed upon the request of the
believers and that Bahá'u'lláh had withheld his pen (amsakná al-qalam) for several years.
Jamál-i Burújirdí, to whom the aforementioned letter was addressed, was then permitted to
make a copy and deliver it to the Bahá'ís of Persia49. The Aqdas was eventually sent around
1290 A.H/1873-4 to Persia50.

Taking for granted that the Book of Aqdas had been kept back "for a number of years"

before Bahá'u'lláh allowed it to be released for distribution and that it had been sent to Persia
about 1873-74, a problem would apparently arise from maintaining 1873 as the date of its
genesis. If it had originated in or around 1873 and had been sent to Persia in or about the
same period, it could obviously not have been kept back simultaneously "for a number of
years"!

In Ishráqát, a tablet written by Bahá'u'lláh after the Kitáb-i Aqdas in `Akká, Bahá'u'lláh
refers himself to the date in which a particular verse of the Aqdas had been revealed. There
he quotes Aq. 48 regarding the obligation to educate children and is very precise in giving the
exact date of its emergence: "Behold that which the Will of God hath revealed upon Our
arrival in the Prison City (sijn) and recorded in the Most Holy Book (Kitáb-i-Aqdas)"51. The
original Persian of this verse is still more precise: "dar awwal-i wurúd-i sijn"52 which literally
means: "At the (very) first (moment) of entering the prison" must be generally taken to imply
the very earliest period after arrival in the citadel of `Akká on 31 August 186853.

Establishing the fact that at least parts of the Aqdas were already written in
August/September 1868 resolves the aforementioned irregularity arising from dating it to
1873 and makes it compatible to it being kept back "for a number of years" by Bahá'u'lláh
before releasing it in 1290/1873-74 for the general use of the believers. A statement by
`Abdu'l-Bahá' that provisions regarding the covenant (`ahd wa mítháq) had been established
in the Kitáb-i Aqdas "twenty-five years before the Ascension" of Bahá'u'lláh54, i.e. about
1867-68, is another confirmation of the fact that the beginnings of the Aqdas must inevitably
be traced back to Bahá'u'lláh's confinement in the citadel of `Akká, and, taken literally, could
even allude to a still earlier period, possibly to that in Adrianople, where some verses
regarding the laws and ordinances had been produced in Persian upon the insistence of some
of his followers. Redating the initial process of the revelation back to 1868 remains in any
case congruent to the assumption, that it may have been "completed"55 in the year 1873 in the
house of `Udí Khammár.

Regarding the statements by Bahá'u'lláh and `Abdu'l-Bahá' quoted above that certain
provisions of the Kitáb-i Aqdas were revealed, respectively, "at the beginning of Our arrival
in the prison city", and "twenty-five years ago", the Research Department of the Bahá'í World
Centre suggests that "these might quite conceivably be accounted for on the basis that they
constitute approximate statements, and that their intention is not to establish precise dates"56!

The above mentioned reference by `Abdu'l-Bahá', in whose hand the original copy of the
Aqdas probably came into being, is not the only one which leads us back to 1868. In another
letter sent by him to Hájjí Mullá Husain of Lár dated 2 Jumádí I 1316 A.H./18 September
1898, which was read aloud to a circle of believers in Cairo and of which a copy was
forwarded to E.G. Browne,`Abdu'l-Bahá' asks: "Was not the Kitáb-i Aqdas revealed thirty
years ago?"57. Substracting 30 years from 1898 again one obtains 1868.

Evidence concerning a more reliable dating of the Kitáb-i Aqdas than 1873 and in full
congruence with `Abdu'l Bahá's information is made also available by Bahá'u'lláh himself.
References contained in his writings give testimony to the fact that the composition of the
Aqdas had already started during the early period of his incarceration in the citadel of `Akká.
Beside the passage in Ishráqát stating that at least one part of the Kitáb-i Aqdas had been
revealed right after entering the prison in `Akká, many more passages in his writings seem
very much to confirm the same and may hardly be regarded merely to "constitute
approximate statements", as the Research Department suggests.

In Lawh-i Dunyá (Tablet of the World), another of his tablets written after the Kitáb-i
Aqdas, Bahá'u'lláh states: "Whilst in the Prison of `Akká, We revealed in the Crimson Book
(dar sahífa-i hamrá' - i.e. Kitáb-i Aqdas - dar sijn-i `Akká názil shud) that which is conducive
to the advancement of mankind and to the reconstruction of the world"58. It is obvious that
Bahá'u'lláh in mentioning "the Prison of `Akká" (sijn-i `Akká) is referring here to the "citadel"
and not to the "city" of `Akká in general, which, upon his arrival, he had designated as the
"Most Great Prison" (as-sijn al-a`zam)59, and in the boundaries of which he was staying
during the composition of Lawh-i Dunyá. It may thus become evident that at least
considerable parts of the Kitáb-i Aqdas had already been composed before leaving the citadel
in late 1870 and particularly in the period prior to entering the house of `Udí Khammár60.

In a similar manner Bahá'u'lláh states on another occasion: "While in prison (sijn) We
have revealed a Book which We have entitled 'The Most Holy Book' (al-Kitáb al-Aqdas)"61,
where sijn also designates very clearly the citadel and not the city of `Akká.

The fact that Bahá'u'lláh seems to distinguish between the two terms sijn for "citadel"

and sijn-i a`zam for the "city of `Akká", may also be deduced from another excerpt of his
writings: " O friend! The Best-Beloved (mahbúb - i.e. Bahá'u'lláh -) is calling thee from His
Most Great Prison (min sijnihi al-a`zam) and exhorteth thee to observe that which Mine
exalted Pen hath revealed in My Most Holy Book (Kitábí al-Aqdas) "62.

The excerpts of Bahá'u'lláh's tablets, published as part of his Tablets Revealed after the
Kitáb-i Aqdas, provide no details as to their dates, addressees and contexts. Should a
researcher gain access to such information sometime in the future, this could help determine
more precisely the history of the Bahá'í faith in general, but also of the Kitáb-i Aqdas in
particular. One such excerpt contains another significant reference for dating the Aqdas: "A
year ago the Most Holy Book (Kitáb-i Aqdas) was sent down from the heaven of the bounty
of the Lord of Names"63. The epistle, which is published without a date, was addressed to
Hájjí `Alí Langarúdí and dated Rabí`u'l-Awwal 1292/April-May 1875. It may be taken to
indicate that by then the Kitáb-i Aqdas, or at least its major parts, had been completed.

60      That the "Crimson Book" mentioned in this passage is an indication to Kitáb-i Aqdas may be
gathered from the following passages, but also from the index to the German edition of the Tablets of
Bahá'u'lláh Revealed after the Kitáb-i Aqdas (Botschaften aus `Akká offenbart nach dem Kitáb-i
Aqdas, Langenhain 1982, p.332), which lists this as well as other passages making mention of the
"Crimson Book" under the index-heading "Kitáb-i Aqdas".

Concluding remarks

Important aspects of the history of the Bábí and Bahá'í religions are still engulfed in
obscurity. In the future, research will have to deal with many sources and documents which
hopefully will become accessible. Apart from the vast number of Bahá'u'lláh's own writings,
this would also have to include e.g. the original text of Nabíl's Narrative, the main and most
important source of Bahá'í historiography, of which only the first part is available as
translated by Shoghi Effendi in 193264. The Dawn Breakers, as this "translation" was entitled,
is based on the original of Nabíl, "but transfigured through the brilliant handling it
received"65, as Shoghi Effendi's wife puts it. The original is still kept out of reach for
researchers, allegedly because of its poor condition66! Copies were never made available.
Particularly its second part could then provide more information on the genesis of the Kitáb-i
Aqdas.

Accessibility to the sources will not only increase the attractivity of Bábí and Bahá'í
topics for the impartial researcher, but will certainly shed more light on many aspects and
details of the history and the doctrines of the twin religions, last but not least, with regard to
the genesis and history of the "Motherbook" of the Bahá'í Faith and its contents.

It was the intention of this paper to demonstrate that, according to Bahá'u'lláh's own
testimony as well as to that given by `Abdu'l-Bahá' and in contrast to the general
representation of Bahá'í historiography, the emergence of the Kitáb-i Aqdas was a process
continuing for several years and most probably at different locations and that this process had
already started and was actually taking place immediatly after Bahá'u'lláh's arrival in `Akká
at the end of August/beginning of September 1868.

for the Bahá'í World Center Archives to prepare the original copy of Nabil's Narrative so as to make it
accessible .... Clearly it is a very precious document, and the most important consideration is its
preservation." "Concerning the English Translation of the Kitáb-i Aqdas", Memorandum of the
Research Dept. of the UHJ, 18 Nov. 1993. In regard to an inquiry, why no microfilm copies were ever
produced in order to ensure the preservation of the document, no response was made. It may be
interesting to note that `Abdu'l-Bahá' in his biographical account of Nabíl-i Zarandí praises him for
his abilities as a poet, but makes no mention of his having ever prepared a "history" of the Bábí and
Bahá'í religions, cf. `Abdu'l-Bahá': Tadhkiratu'l-Wafá' fí Tarjumat Hayát Qudamá' al-Ahibbá', Haifa
1343/1924, pp.57-63.
