A “Phoenix Schedule”

Section 4

> Paul Gerard

Melvil Dewey first proposed the classification that bears his name in
> 1876. It is still the most widely used library subject classification in the
> world - although many large, general libraries (most notably those attached
> to universities) prefer the classification used by the United States Library of
> Congress (LC), while highly specialised libraries of various kinds often use
their own schemes.

DDC is (as might be expected after 125 years!) very old fashioned in many
> respects - but it has the great advantage over LC of having been conceived as
> a unified whole by an undoubted genius, rather than having grown like topsy
> out of a hodgepodge of ad hoc decisions by ordinary librarians; and the great
> advantage over specialised schemes of being instantly familiar to librarians
and library users all over the world.

DDC is now in its 21st edition - which is of course many times larger
> than the original (42 page) proposal. Over the years, it has been changed in
> two basic ways. The first method has been to expand existing schedules to
> accommodate new subjects. The simple “decimal” notation used by DDC is
> admirably adapted to this procedure, up to a point. Eventually new numbers
> become very long indeed, and ultimately, of course, they become unworkably
> long. This is most noticeable in the “500s” and “600s” - (science and technol-
ogy) where many new subjects have arisen since 1876.

The other method has been to simply scrap a whole section of the clas-
> sification that is palpably out of date and insert an entirely new schedule. The
> Dewey people themselves have called this kind of thing a “Phoenix Schedule”
> (after the legendary bird born anew out of the flames). The current section for
music is a fairly recent example.

What is different about this particular “Phoenix” is that it is NOT an official,
