> **Abstract:**  
>   
> If God is beyond the description of aught except Himself; if the Word of God transcends words and letters; if true Understanding shatters discourse, what point is there to Scripture, let alone to scholarship. If knowledge is but a point which the ignorant have multiplied, is discourse an exercise in ignorance? This presentation will explore the relationship between mysticism and language in both the Bahá'í scriptures and some classics of mystical literature from previous religious traditions. It will highlight, and try to understand, the paradox of a history of writers penning volumes on a subject which they assert cannot be grasped by language. It will finally suggest that the relationship between mysticism and language lies at the root of the Universal House of Justice's call for a religiously inspired reorientation of scholarship.

“What I Want to Say is Wordless”:

by Ismael Velasco

t is customary for general works on mysticism to begin by a definition of the term “mysticism.”1 In

I   all of these discussions mysticism emerges, above all, as a form of personal experience, more pre-

cisely, as a form of religious experience of extraord in ary intensity, culm in ating in a profound sense
of union and identity with the transcendent or immanent Absolute. The experience of mystical union is
thus the card in al pole of mystical experience, giving to the mystic’s quest its mean in g, purpose and ful-
filment.

In Christian mystical writings the concept of mystical union appears to extend to two kinds of expe-
rience: first, the momentary rapture in which all sense of self is lost in God and all the powers of the
soul are temporarily stilled in wordless ecstasy—an experience which, according to William James in his
now classic and still influential Gifford Lectures, cannot last much more than half an hour, and at most
an hour or two.2 Secondly, the concept of mystical union is also applied to a less transient and not at all
disabling sense of deep union with God which usually follows, or is punctuated by, such raptures, in
which the human will is said to become one with the divine Will, and all actions, thoughts, affections,
are described as flowing from and tending towards God, resulting in a saintly life characterized by good-
ly deeds and an abiding sense of God’s presence in oneself and in all else. The technical term sometimes
used for the second of these two states of mystical union is “the unitive life.”3

It should be said that although Christian mystics often make clear the distinction, equally often this
d is tinction is blurred in the similarities of language used to refer to both kinds of experience. What is
clear, however, is that both states are intimately linked, and, phenomenologically at least, are often con-
sidered as different aspects or phases of an ultimately unique experience of union with God.

Bearing in mind the interrelatedness of these two states, we will focus in this essay on the second kind
of unitive experience, an experience which we may describe as “abid in g” union with God—the quotidian
experience of union with God to put it another way—as opposed to the ecstatic flight of union often
linked with stirring visions, which is said to herald, usher in, or recur in the course of, the unitive life.
More precisely, we will focus on how this experience of abiding union is articulated by a number of
important Christian mystics affiliated to the Franciscan and Dom in i can mendicant orders.4 In explor in g
this theme we will pay attention to the manner in which their formulation of an inescapably personal
experience sought to bridge the gap of ineffability to reach an audience physically close, yet to all appear-
ances still too far from their state to share or even conceive the preciousness of their sense of real iz a-
tion.5 We will frame this discussion in an exploration of Bahá’u’lláh’s mystical teac h in g.

While mysticism has often been seen as on the margins of “official” religion, in the Bahá’í Faith mys-
tical experience is seen as fundamental not only to the Bahá’í religion, but to religion itself, univer-
sal is ed and aligned with religious faith. In a well-known passage, Shoghi Effendi writes that “the core of
religious faith is that mystic feeling which unites Man with God.... The Bahá’í Faith, like all other Div in e
Religions, is thus fundamentally mystic in character.”6 That mystic feeling has given rise in the great
world religions to mystical traditions which, in turn, have engendered a rich vein of mystical writing and
indeed mystical literature. The Bahá’í Faith, although by far the youngest world religion, has already made
significant contributions to the literary corpus of world mysticism, beginning by the great mystical trea-
tises and visionary poems of the Faith’s Founder, Bahá’u’lláh. These works, regarded by Bahá’ís as div in e
Revelation, have already had a profound impact on the outlook and perspective of the Bahá’í communi-
ty.

Lights of ‘Irfán

Bahá’u’lláh’s major mystical works were revealed in the earliest period of His ministry, shaping in a
fundamental way the attitudes and aspirations of the first believers, and through them successive gen-
erations of Bahá’ís. Bahá’u’lláh’s mystical masterpiece, The Seven Valleys, as well as the mystical apho-
risms that crown his ethical teac h in g, The Hidden Words, were among the earliest works to be translat-
ed into Western languages, both by ind iv idual believers and by the Guardian of the Cause himself. It is
no accident that from the time of Bahá’u’lláh the genre of mystical literature had already germinated
within the nascent Bahá’í community, in the shape of beautiful and intense poetry and prose from Bahá’í
s such as Nabíl, Na’im, Varqa, and other early believers. The roots of this poetry, beside Bahá’u’lláh’s
inspiration and example, lay in large measure in the Persian Sufi tradition and above all in the scripture
and poetry of the Bábí religion. Likewise the earliest years of the Cause in the West saw examples of
Bahá’í inspired mystical literature among a number of Bahá’ís, most notably in the writings and poetry
of the Hand of the Cause of God and former ecclesiastic of Ireland, George Townshend.

At the heart of mystical literature lies an ineradicable paradox: the assertion of ineffability, of the
impossibility of description in relation to mystical experience side by side with pages upon pages of pre-
cisely such description. Why, if language is utterly inadequate, write treatises of mystical guidance? Why,
if the descriptions of mystics fail, do mystics cite each other for validation and illustration?

This paradox, pervasive in mystical literature East and West, is closely related to a sim il ar paradox
underpinning the Bahá’í concept of Revelation: the absolute transcendence, the categorical unknowabil-
ity and indescribability of God-given expression in volume upon volume of revealed words about His
exalted reality, will and purpose. Language is simultaneously held to be incapable of hinting at the real-
ity of God, the Most Hidden of the hidden, while being consistently offered, in the words of the
Prophets, as a ladder of ascent unto His Reality, the Most Manifest of the manifest.

This paradox, in both mysticism and revelation, finds sublime expression in a tablet revealed by
Bahá’u’lláh to Áqá Mu˙ammad Óasan, and chosen by Shoghi Effendi to be the opening passage of
Gleanings from the Writings of Bahá’u’lláh, the volume of his chosen translations of Bahá’u’lláh’s words:

> Lauded and glorified art Thou, O Lord, my God! How can I make mention of Thee, assured as
> I am that no tongue, however deep its wisdom, can befittingly magnify Thy name, nor can the
> bird of the human heart, however great its longing, ever hope to ascend into the heaven of Thy
> majesty and knowledge.

> ...The loftiest sentiments which the holiest of sa in ts can express in praise of Thee, and the deep-
> est wisdom which the most learned of men can utter in their attempts to comprehend Thy
> nature, all revolve around that Center Which is wholly subjected to Thy sovereignty, Which
> adoreth Thy Beauty, and is propelled through the movement of Thy Pen.

> Nay, forbid it, O my God, that I should have uttered such words as must of necessity imply the
> existence of any direct relationship between the Pen of Thy Revelation and the essence of all
> created things... All comparisons and likenesses fail to do justice to the Tree of Thy Revelation,
> and every way is barred to the comprehension of the Manifestation of Thy Self and the Day
> Spring of Thy Beauty.

> ...Whatever duty Thou hast prescribed unto Thy servants of extolling to the utmost Thy majesty
> and glory is but a token of Thy grace unto them, that they may be enabled to ascend unto the
> station conferred upon their own inmost being, the station of the knowledge of their own selves.

> ...Unsearchable and high above the praise of men wilt Thou remain for ever. There is none other
> God but Thee, the Inaccessible, the Omnipotent, the Omn is cient, the Holy of Holies.7
Thus not even the words of the Prophets or, in Bahá’í terminology, the Manifestations of God, can
hint at God’s reality or that of His Messengers. At the most, they can lead to attainment to the true
knowledge of one’s innermost self. In this context Bahá’u’lláh declares in the Hidden Words: “Turn thy
sight unto thyself, that thou mayest find Me within thee, Mighty, Powerful and Self-Subsistent.”8 The cir-

\[120\] Mystical Language, Revelation and Scholarship

cularity of the process becomes apparent. Our praise of and contemplation on God leads to a recogni-
tion of the poverty of our very words and insights in relation to His exalted Reality, leading in the
process to a clearer insight into our own souls—wherein God is manifest. It seems then that the purpose
of our inadequate praise of God is, as echoed by the Guardian in the citation above, to attain the mys-
tical experience of union with God within our souls. Language, however, as is made clear earlier in this
quote, even from sa in ts, remains a broken yet seemingly indispensable vessel to carry the mystic waters.

The tablet to Áqá Mu˙ammad Óasan makes clear that the paradoxical nature of language as both lad-
der to and veil from God applies not only to sacred scripture but to mystical literature also—in relation
to the “sentiments of the holiest of sa in ts” and the “deepest wisdom” of “the most learned of men.”

This paper will explore in more detail the nature of this paradox by exploring in detail the way in
which mystics within one religious tradition use language to describe mystical experience, how that
endeavour is shaped by the mystics’ environment and background, and how that process illum in ates our
understanding of Bahá’í mysticism and of Bahá’í scripture. We conclude with reflections on implications
of this linguistic paradox to the conduct and direction of Bahá’í scholarship.

We have chosen to take a very narrow focus on medieval mendicant Christian mystics. The intention
is that, by rooting our discussion in a relatively homogenous context, the dynamics giving rise to dif-
ferences in mystical description may be more readily perceived, and the relationship between mystical
expression and social context may be more clearly located. As we explore the experience of these mys-
tics, we shall draw links and compar is ons to Bahá’u’lláh’s mystical works.

We begin with general remarks regarding the nature of the experience of abiding union as intimated
by the writings of the mystics under review, noting aspects common to all of them before proceeding to
d is cuss some aspects upon which they differ, in order to attempt some conclusions regarding the con-
cept of mystical union and its formulation and discussion by our mystics. As a point of departure, a
brief description of the sensations attending the experience in the mystics’ own words seems in order.

Suso writes of intoxication, quiet and freedom: “when the good and faithful servant enters the joy of
his Lord, he becomes intoxicated with the immeasurable abundance of the Divine House. For in an inef-
fable manner it happens to him as to a drunk man, who forgets himself, is no longer himself. He is quite
dead to Himself, and is entirely lost in God, has passed into Him, and has become one spirit with Him
in all respects, just as a little drop of water that is poured into a large quantity of wine.” “A man’s will
fades away as regards volition, in the sense of wanting to do this or that from self-will. He has no activ-
ity of such a will in this sinful sense...his life and will and activity are a quiet, untouched freedom,
which is certainly, beyond all doubt, his support.”9

Jacopone da Todi writes: “In God the spiritual faculties come to their desired end, lose all sense of
self and self-consciousness, and are swept away. The soul, made new again, marvelling to find itself in
that immensity, drowns. How this comes about it does not know.... The soul that possesses You remains
forever pure, does not wound or sully itself with sin. On a height and in peace it looks down on the world
below steeped in sin. The sense of self disappears, for it can never rise to this level, where the infinite
charity of God engulfs all.... So it is with the soul: Love drinks it in, it is united with Truth, its old
nature fades away, it is no longer master of itself. The soul wills and yet does not will: its will belongs
to Another. It has eyes only for this Beauty.”10

Angela di Foligno describes the experience thus: “He is presented intimately to my soul, and when I
understand Him to be present, I then understand how He is present in all nature, how in all things He has
being.... And God presents Himself with great illumination and truth and divine grace. So that the soul,
seeing Him thus, can in no wise offend.... And although I can experience sadness and joy exteriorly, I can-
not interiorly; for in my soul is a room into which no joy or sadness, nor pleasure of any kind, neither
virtue nor anything else, can enter. But into that room enters the All-Good…there remains continually with
me a Divine u nction, which is a supreme unction, and which I may have at all times of the day.”11

We could add quotes from our remaining authors, but it is hoped that these excerpts, characteristic of
the genre as a whole, will suffice to indicate the tenor of their descriptions.12

Lights of ‘Irfán

Bahá’u’lláh’s The Seven Valleys echo these descriptions of the unitive life:

> Whensoever the light of Manifestation of the King of Oneness settleth upon the throne of the
> heart and soul, His shining becometh visible in every limb and member. At that time the mys-
> tery of the famed tradition gleameth out of the darkness: “A servant is drawn unto Me in prayer
> until I answer him; and when I have answered him, I become the ear wherewith he heareth...”"
> For thus the Master of the house hath appeared within His home, and all the pillars of the
> dwelling are ashine with His light. And the action and effect of the light are from the Light-
> Giver; so it is that all move through Him and arise by His will. And this is that spring where-
> of the near ones drink, as it is said: “A fount whereof the near unto God shall drink”.... For when
> the true lover and devoted friend reacheth to the presence of the Beloved, the sparkling beauty
> of the Loved One and the fire of the lover’s heart will kindle a blaze and burn away all veils and
> wrappings. Yea, all he hath, from heart to skin, will be set a fl ame, so that nothing will remain
> save the Friend.13
As a starting point for a more detailed exam in ation, it may be useful to turn to William James’ sim-
ple yet useful model of the mystical experience. For William James four characteristics may be said to
mark an experience as mystical: ineffability; noetic quality; transiency; and passivity.14 Of these four
marks of mystical states noted by James, the only one that does not apply to the kind of experience we
are exam in ing is, evidently, transiency. Indeed, William James is focusing on the visionary and raptur-
ous experiences we mentioned earlier, rather than on the sense of abiding union or unitive life we are
discussing here. The other three characteristics, on the other hand, certainly appear to be present in our
mystics’ discussions.

Let us begin with passivity, a word which may at first mislead, since, as it relates to our subject, it
does not refer to the abandonment of human effort but rather to the incapacity of human effort, of
itself, to bring about the longed for union, and the consequent ascription of this union and of the effects
of this union to the activity of God rather than to the striv in gs of man. To this insufficiency of human
effort all of our mystics testify, asserting the necessity of grace, defined as a “supernatural” bestowal
originating in God Himself through Christ Jesus. Human effort then, according to each and all the mys-
tics under review, is secondary—necessary but not sufficient to attain reunion. Bonaventura summ ar is-
es this position as follows:

> But we cannot rise above ourselves unless a higher power lift us up. No matter how much our
> interior progress is ordered, nothing will come of it unless accompanied by divine aid. Div in e
> aid is ava il able to those who seek it from their hearts, humbly and devoutly; and this means to
> sigh for it in this valley of tears, through fervent prayer. Prayer, then, is the mother and source
> of the ascent... First, therefore, I invite the reader to the groans of prayer through Christ cruci-
> fied...so that he not believe that reading is sufficient without unction, speculation without
> devotion, investigation without wonder, observation without joy, work without piety, knowledge
> without love, understanding without humility, endeavour without grace, reflection...without
> divinely inspired wisdom.15
Bahá’u’lláh echoes this in many passages of which we will cite but one from the Book of Certitude:

> Thus will these mysteries be unravelled, not by the aid of acquired learning, but solely through
> the assistance of God and the outpourings of His grace.... Only when the lamp of search, of
> earnest striv in g, of longing desire, of passionate devotion, of fe rv id love, of rapture, and ecsta-
> sy, is kindled within the seeker’s heart, and the breeze of His lov in g-kindness is wafted upon his
> soul, will the darkness of error be dispelled, the mists of doubts and misgiv in gs be dissipated,
> and the lights of knowledge and certitude envelop his being. At that hour will the mystic Herald,
> bearing the joyful tid in gs of the Spirit, shine forth from the City of God resplendent as the
> morn, and, through the trumpet-blast of knowledge, will awaken the heart, the soul, and the
> spirit from the slumber of negligence.16

\[122\] Mystical Language, Revelation and Scholarship

Here the balance is struck between spiritual preparation on the part of the seeker and ultimate depen-
dence upon divine assistance, in the form of “the breeze of His loving kindness,” and “the mystic
Herald, bearing the joyful tid in gs of the Spirit.” The link between mystical feeling and mystical knowl-
edge is likewise clearly drawn in the passage. Of the noetic quality of mystical experience, James writes:
“Although so sim il ar to states of feeling, mystical states seem to those who experience them to be also
states of knowledge. They are states of insight into depths unplumbed by the discursive intellect.”17 This,
again, is clearly reflected in every one of our mystics. Again, we will turn to one of them, Catherine of
Siena, to speak for the rest:

O Abyss! O eternal Godhead! O deep sea! What more could you have given me than the gift of
> your very self? You are a fire always burning but never consuming; you are a fire consuming in
> your heat all the soul’s selfish love; you are a fire lifting all chill and giving light. In your light
> you have made me know your truth: You are that light beyond all light who gives the mind’s eye
> supernatural light in such fullness and perfection that you bring clarity even to the light of
> faith. In that faith I see that my soul has life, and in that light receives you who are Light.18
We now arrive at the ineffability of union, the unutterable nature of what is felt and apprehended in
the privacy of the mystic’s communion. In The Seven Valleys, having described the experience in words
such as those cited above, Bahá’u’lláh adds the paradoxical disclaimer:

> The pen steppeth not into this region, the ink leaveth only a blot. In these planes, the nightin-
> gale of the heart hath other songs and secrets, which make the heart to stir and the soul to clam-
> or, but this mystery of inner meaning may be whispered only from heart to heart, confided only
> from breast to breast.19
“No one grasps this,” explains Bonaventura, “except him who receives, since it is more a matter of
affective experience than rational consideration.”20 And Tauler asserts, “But this reaches far above all
knowledge and understanding; far beyond all powers, even unto a fathomless abyss. As weak eyes can-
not bear the brightness of the sun, so a thousand times less can nature endure this condition in her
weakness. All that we can say of this is that however well we may be able to comprehend it with our
minds, express it in words, or grasp it with the understand in g, still it is all as utterly unlike the reality
as it would be were I to say of a piece of black coal: ‘Look, here is the bright sun which lightens all the
world.’”21 And in Dionysian fashion Suso refers to God as the Nothing, and says, “in point of fact, it is
as far and farther from the Nothing as it would be to say ‘chopping block’ instead of ‘fine pearl.’”22
Angela di Foligno finds language so inadequate as to feel that her descriptions approach blasphemy23
(although doctrinally they could not be more orthodox) and asserts, “Of these divine operations of the
manifestation of God in the soul not one word can be spoken, and of them no man can babble.”24
Catherine of Siena, as if it were God Himself speaking, writes, “Your tongue could never tell, nor your
ears hear, nor your eyes see the joy they have who travel on this road”;25 and Jacopone da Todi exclaims
despairingly, “Oh, the futility of seeking to convey with images and feelings that which surpasses all
measure!”26

Notwithstanding the sense of futility attending their attempts however, “seeking to convey with
images and feelings that which surpasses all measure” is precisely what we find these mystics doing. It
is this paradox which alerts us to the peculiarity of the mystic’s use of language, which attempts, by
means of “images and feelings” to bring, Prometheus like, the hidden fire of mystical experience from
unapprehended heights to the lowly ground of human utterance, not for the sake of those who, like them-
selves, have experienced the summits of reunion first hand—what need have they of words to do injus-
tice to their rav is h in gs?—but rather for the sake of those who have not yet attained the peak of mystical
experience but who are receptive enough to be brought closer to their goal by the mystics’ melodies.

Thus we find Catherine of Siena thanking God for her revelations not only on her own behalf, but on
behalf also “of others who might see themselves mirrored here.”27 Clearly the mystic’s path, although an
intensely personal one, is not a lonely one, but one understood as shared by a multitude of souls.
Bonaventura is still more explicit and precise. He writes his book for “those, therefore, predisposed by

Lights of ‘Irfán

grace, the humble and the pious, the contrite and the devout, those anointed with the oil of gladness,
the lovers of divine wisdom, and those in fl am ed with a desire for it...those wishing to give themselves
to glorifying, wondering at and even savouring God.”28 Those “wishing to,” “lovers of,” “in fl am ed with
desire for”: those, in other words, who want to arrive at the promised goal and are actively endeavour-
ing to reach it, but who are not yet there. This target audience for mystical texts resonates with the tar-
get audience designated by Bahá’u’lláh in the opening paragraphs of the Kitáb-i-ˆqán: “They that tread
the path of faith, they that thirst for the wine of certitude” who have the insight to seek “the shores of
the ocean of true understanding” (‘irfán) but have yet to attain the ultimate goal of reunion.29

From the above may be gathered therefore that in attempting to describe the indescribable, the mys-
tic’s purpose is allusive rather than descriptive, and is a im ed at those held to have the capacity to prof-
it from the guidance, namely, those with mystical calling even if as yet lacking in mystical attainment.
And if words and concepts, including the concept of mystical union, are held to be descriptively inade-
quate or even altogether blasphemous in judging the reality of God by merely human yardsticks; yet are
held to be at the same time didactically useful before a particularly receptive audience, then clearly their
purpose is not description, but rather to carry the intended audience to a point beyond description; to
use language not so much to nullify as to transcend itself, so that words are possible but inescapably
inadequate, yet capable of triggering within the reader a mystical experience of the text.

Mystical language and terminology then, in purpose, is not descriptive but allusive and evocative, and
it is by evocation and allusion that they convey meaning beyond words to those receptive to their images
by reason of what Bahá’u’lláh describes as their “purity of heart, chastity of soul, and freedom of spir-
it.”30 Evocation and allusion together form the bridge that connects the intelligible with the i neffable and
makes mystical teaching possible. It is a bridge built by vivid images, used metaphorically and paradox-
ically to convey what is regarded as unutterable truth.

Here is where we discover the social dimension of mystical language. To be effectively allusive or
evocative language must at the outset be intelligible; and to be intelligible it must use images and con-
cepts that its audience is equipped to understand. Further, the language used by an author will be shaped
by his or her intellectual and cultural background, and, for the mystics under review, will additionally
be limited by a desire to remain within the bounds of Catholic orthodoxy. We thus find our mystics’ dis-
cussion profoundly influenced by, yet not reducible to, their social context. Their treatises may in this
light be seen as a conversation between the individual’s deeply subjective, indescribable, yet not incom-
municable experience, and society’s mores and aspirations. Time and space constraints prevent our deal-
ing with each of our mystics individually, to see how their particular context influenced their writing.
What we can attempt to identify is general ways in which the language of all of these mystics is affect-
ed by their environment, with particular reference to the concept of mystical union.

We mentioned that the intellectual and cultural background of the mystics would affect their writ-
ings. In this respect it would be natural to expect that (male) university-trained mystics would present
differences from the (female) non-academically tra in ed mystics in our list. Indeed, this appears to be the
case. The four university trained mystics—Bonaventura, Jacopone da Todi, Suso, and Tauler—all reflect
a sim il ar intellectual heritage that differs somewhat from the two female mystics. In style if not always
in content, moreover, Bonaventura, Suso and Tauler, the theologians, are set apart from Jacopone, the
erstwhile lawyer, the former using, unlike the latter, prose rather than verse, and being far more prone
to cite, explicitly or without acknowledgement, the voice of scholarly authority. In sharp contrast, the
writing of our women mystics is comparatively devoid of references, other than to the Bible and to pop-
ularly accessible devotional stories, and is both less philosophical and more intimate in character.

A look at the three theologians, although separated by many miles and decades, reveals them to share,
as was mentioned before, a common intellectual heritage with Augustine, Pseudo-Dionysius and
Aristotle, representing the major wellsprings of their thought, if not of their inspiration, which derives
rather from the gospel and the lives of sa in ts, most significantly St. Francis.31 The same intellectual
influences are present in Jacopone da Todi, although less emphatically and less distinctly. By contrast,
the inf luence of these three authors on Catherine of Siena, although noticeable, appears negligible, and
the same is the case with Angela di Foligno. This is most clearly reflected in the relation between the

\[124\] Mystical Language, Revelation and Scholarship

concept of mystical union with God and the ideas of Pseudo-Dionysius.32 Pseudo-Dionysius’ apophatic
theology (seeing God in negative terms—as a Darkness, as a Not h in g, etc.—by reason of His utter tran-
scendence) is one of the principal non-scriptural, explicit references in Bonaventura’s “Journey of the
Soul,” and is even more ubiquitous in Tauler and Suso. Dionysian thought becomes less noticeable though
still clearly apparent in Jacopone da Todi, and even less evident in Catherine of Siena and Angela di
Foligno. It would thus seem that the apophatic image of union with God was mediated by the universi-
ties and popul ar iz ed in the sermons and counsels of such as Tauler and other mystically inclined preach-
ers and confessors through whom it would have reached most laypersons aware of such teaching. This sug-
gestion that the apophatic images of mystical union were transmitted by the schools rather than drawn
naturally from experience is all the more plausible since, as Butler noted, earlier mystics like Augustine,
Gregory, and Bernard of Clairvaux, were predom in antly affirmative, which is equivalent to saying non-
Dionysian (or as he puts it pre-Dionysian) in their mysticism.33 Indeed, the thought of Pseudo-Dionysius
was first translated into Latin by John Scotus in the ninth century, but did not become popular until
the twelfth century. It was subsequently commented on by great schoolmen such as Hugh of St. Victor,
Thomas Aquinas, Eckhart and, as we have seen, Bonaventura. It is thus no surprise that the closer we
get to the universities, and the more we advance in time, the more apophatic our mystics become.
Sim il arly, it is logical to believe that the friars, tra in ed in the universities yet preaching to the masses,
would have been a prime channel for the diffusion of such thought among the people, particularly
among lay members of the mendicant orders such as Jacopone da Todi, Angela di Foligno and Catherine
of Siena.34

In the case of Bahá’u’lláh, a theologically informed Bahá’í perspective assessing the influence of
Bahá’u’lláh’s environment on the shape of His Revelation faces the tensions between illum in ating the
meaning of His message, and giving expression to “such words as must of necessity imply the existence
of any direct relationship between the Pen of Thy Revelation and the essence of all created things.” A
beginning however may be made from Bahá’u’lláh’s own utterances. To take the example of the Seven
Valleys, the book is clearly influenced in its formal structure by Attar’s Conference of Birds and
Sadi’s...35 both of which use the structure of seven stages to the eventual desti nation of mystic union.
Within the Seven Valleys, mystical poets such as Rumi, Hafiz, etc., are cited very frequently, in a way
that does not recur in other genres within Bahá’u’lláh’s corpus of Revelation. The descriptions of mys-
tical union, emphasising the notion of Poverty and Absolute Nothingness likewise echo a specifically
Sufi mystical tradition.

However the key influence in the literary shape of the Seven Valleys is likely to be the recipient and
intended audience of the work, rather than Bahá’u’lláh’s own previous education, as in the case of the
mendicant mystics. Thus Bahá’u’lláh explicitly states in the Seven Valleys: “so much as We have quoted
here is out of deference to the wont of men and after the manner of the friends.”36 In this as in so many
aspects the Bahá’í Faith from its very roots is a uniquely a self-conscious religion, as described by the
founder of World Theology, William Cantwell-Smith. The suggestion that the key factor in shaping the
form of the Seven Valleys is its intended audience may be strengthened by noting that the prevalence of
poetic quotes so striking in the Seven Valleys is not characteristic of a roughly contemporary work deal-
ing in part with very similar themes, the Kitáb-i-ˆqán. There the supporting quotes are drawn pr im ar i-
ly from hadith (traditions) and, as is common throughout His writings, the Qur’án. In the ˆqán as well,
Bahá’u’lláh expresses His consistent approach to citation of authority: “Although We did not intend to
make mention of the traditions of a bygone age, yet, because of Our love for thee, We will cite a few
which are applicable to Our argument.”37 Towards the end of His ministry in His Epistle to the Son of
the Wolf, Bahá’u’lláh clarified the purpose behind this variety of styles, of languages of Revelation:

> So powerful is the light of unity that it can illum in ate the whole earth.... At one time We spoke
> in the language of the lawgiver; at another in that of the truth-seeker and the mystic, and yet
> Our supreme purpose and highest wish hath always been to disclose the glory and sublimity of
> this station.38

Lights of ‘Irfán

This passage intimates that Bahá’u’lláh’s styles were intentionally adopted to speak to different audi-
ences the underlying message of unity which forms the leitmotif of His Revelation, and that the princi-
ple of adopting styles and images that maximise the evocative power of the texts to their intended audi-
ence.

The need to tailor language to audience was shared by the mendicant mystics under review as well. We
find, by way of illustration, that German mystics use terminology not employed by the more numerous
Italians on our list. A case in point is the term “ground” to signify the essence of the soul where the
image of God is found, the place of “hypostasis” where the union of the soul with God takes place. The
idea goes back to Pseudo-Dionysius and before that to Plotinus, and was influentially used in German
circles by Meister Eckhart himself.39 The term was also used, it seems, by George Fox and Julian of
Norwhich among others in England, but does not appear in our Italian mystics’ vocabulary, even though,
as we have explained, Bonaventura at least, and likely also Jacopone da Todi, had direct knowledge of
Pseudo-Dionysius. The root of the difference therefore very possibly lies in the differing audiences. In
whichever way it became common in Germany as a mystical term, the word “ground” was clearly a famil-
iar feature of mystical discourse by the time John Tauler was using it in his sermons to various congre-
gations of nuns who could not have been expected to have acquired knowledge of Dionysius at universi-
ty. The image of the ground of the soul is ubiquitous in Tauler and is almost as common in Suso, yet is
wholly absent in all other mystics under review. In Italy, where the rest of our mystics originate, the term
was clearly not current, so that even if Bonaventura and Jacopone da Todi were familiar with this term,
and even if they had found it descriptively very useful, being largely unknown to their intended audi-
ences, it would have been didactically useless.

We also mentioned the desire for orthodoxy as a significant factor in the way language is used by our
mystics. We may see this most clearly in the discussions of mystical union with God by Henry Suso. In
his Little Book of Truth, written against the background of the condemnation of Meister Eckhart —
Suso’s teacher—for heresy (on the grounds of pantheistic use of language in dealing with the concept of
mystical union),40 Suso goes out of his way to state that the collapse of distinctions between man and
God in the divine union is one of perception rather than of substance.41 Man remains man and God
remains God, except that man ceases to think in terms of this dichotomy. Ontologically however, the
gap between Divinity and humanity is unbridgeable, except in Christ, and in Christ alone.42 So emphat-
ic is he on this point that he holds a real iz ation of the truth of this ineradicable distinction between man
and God to be an essential prerequisite of attainment to mystical union.43 Although, with vary in g
degrees of emphasis, all our writers appear to agree on this point, none is so explicit nor so insistent as
Suso, nor is the context for such discussion so poignant or relevant as it is in his case.

In the writings of Bahá’u’lláh is the same theological self-consciousness, the same explicit effort to
bind spiritual experience within a theological understanding that preserved the distinction between the
divine and the merely human, the finite and the infinite. In the Seven Valleys, having described the
experience of mystic union in the Valley of Unity, Bahá’u’lláh declares:

> However, let none construe these utterances to be anthropomorphism, nor see in them the
> descent of the worlds of God into the grades of the creatures; nor should they lead thine
> Eminence to such assumptions. For God is, in His Essence, holy above ascent and descent,
> entrance and exit; He hath through all eternity been free of the attributes of human creatures,
> and ever will remain so. No man hath ever known Him; no soul hath ever found the pathway to
> His Being. Every mystic knower hath wandered far astray in the valley of the knowledge of Him;
> every saint hath lost his way in seeking to comprehend His Essence.44
To conclude, phenomenologically, the formulation of the concept of mystical union appears to find
roots in a distinctive kind of mystical experience: personal, illum in ating, transcendent and climactic—
passive, noetic, ineffable, in the words of William James. An experience or state far above any and all
words to describe, if not to hint at. Indeed, the concept of “mystical union” appears to have been con-
ceived not so much to describe the feeling or experience of the mystic—a forlorn hope—as to hint at its
nature; to evoke an intuition of it in the receptive heart by means of vivid metaphorical and often para-

\[126\] Mystical Language, Revelation and Scholarship

doxical imagery. Receptivity to this imagery was said by these mystics to depend on a subtle combina-
tion of effort and grace in the quest for this same “mystical union.” The concept of “mystical union” thus
stands out as didactic in purpose even if descriptive or speculative in form, a im ing at imparting non-
d is cursive knowledge to receptive audiences, in order to facilitate or add momentum to these audiences’
ongoing mystical journey towards “reunion” with God. Images and descriptions are useful to our mys-
tics only insofar as they are able to evoke such non-discursive apprehension, or rather intimation, of a
state experienced first hand by them and uniformly stated to lie beyond the capacity of language to
depict, yet evidently not beyond its power to allude (which in a certain way is a capacity to lead towards).

It would seem that, at the individual level at least, Bahá’u’lláh takes a sim il ar approach to Revelation.

Its main purpose is not to inform but to transform, and the depths of meaning that lie within the Sacred
Word can be plumbed only by the spiritually prepared, that is, the spiritually thirsty. In the Kitáb-i-
ˆqán, Bahá’u’lláh emphatically states: “The understanding of His words and the comprehension of the
utterances of the Birds of Heaven are in no wise dependent upon human lear n in g. They depend solely
upon purity of heart, chastity of soul, and freedom of spirit. This is evidenced by those who, today,
though without a single letter of the accepted standards of learning, are occupying the loftiest seats of
knowledge.”45 By understand in g, Bahá’u’lláh clearly means something deeper than the purely linguistic
or even intellectual comprehension ava il able to all alike—the accepted standards of learning. Rather it is
suggested that he means a transformational experience of the text leading to an essentially mystical expe-
rience. Like the mystics, Bahá’u’lláh writes pr im ar ily not to expound but to transform.

This fundamental intention necessitates that the language used be intelligible, indeed evocative to the
intended audience. This, together with a desire to keep mystical language within the bounds of doctri-
nal clarity, and, particularly in relation to the mystics, life experience, make the use mystical imagery
and language heavily influenced by the social environment. Thus the cultural and intellectual make-up
of the intended audience will be a factor in the choice of imagery used to evoke intuitions of the mys-
tics’ ineffable experience. The concern for doctrinal clarity will act as a constraint on mystical discourse,
influencing, among other things, the degree of emphasis and elaboration devoted to various aspects of
mystical experience in order to justify, if necessary, the use of images of great evocative potential but of
doctrinal ambiguity. The intellectual background of the mystic will affect both his style and his choice
of imagery with which he attempts to articulate his insights. In the case of Revelation, the intellectual
environment of the Prophet clearly influences, at the very least, the language of scripture, the questions
He is asked, the audiences He engages with, and the literary and philosophical heritage He draws on. This
accounts to a considerable degree for the differences between mystical writers even within the same reli-
gious and even monastic tradition. It underlies the pivotal principle of Bahá’í theology—progressive rev-
elation.

In a way that resonates with the Bahá’í notion of the fundamental oneness of religion, there appears
to be at the heart of mysticism a fundamental oneness or convergence of religious experience. In the reli-
gious accounts of the mystics, notwithstanding the varieties of expression, the rhetorical effect of the
various images used seems to coincide to a remarkable degree in evoking a shared sense of climax, of
ineffability, of illum in ation, of encounter, and of moral development. This suggests that the experience
alluded to by the concept of “mystical union,” although irreducibly subjective in character, has an objec-
tive nature which allows it to be experienced by a multitude of mystics—which assumption underlies the
very attempt of our mystics at communicating something of their insights and experiences. It is this that
enables mystics to quote liberally from each other to illustrate their experiences. The link between such
mystical experience and Revelation is most compellingly illustrated by Bahá’u’lláh’s use of mystics’ writ-
ings to validate His own Revelation. This suggests that the mystics’ description of his or her journey
towards God potentially holds insights that can help illum in ate our experience of the Word of God.

Although the state alluded to by the concept of mystical union is affirmed by the mystics we have
reviewed to be indescribable, it is indeed considered communicable, at least partially, to kindred souls,
even if to those not mystically inc l in ed the mystic’s words might appear not so much paradoxical as
merely contradictory—not so much ineffable as hopelessly incongruous. Mystical language is thus in a
way exclusive in its functioning, even if not by design, insofar as its proper understanding is explicitly

held to be conditioned on the sincere desire for, and actively pursuit of, the mystic’s goal. It is consid-
ered to elude intrinsically the comprehension of others who, though remote from the mystic’s own
inmost aspirations, care nonetheless to eavesdrop on his conversation. To such as these the mystics we
have considered do not address themselves nor do they expect to be properly understood by such (to the
mystics) worldly ears. If the mystics speak to them at all it is unintentionally, one might almost say
against their will. In this light, the concept of mystical union, as far as the mystic is concerned, takes
on the character, not of an explanation but of a riddle—a guide to the devout and mystically inclined and
an obstruction to the worldly and the unspiritual—to be unravelled only by lov in g, yearning effort,
assisted by grace, guided by a desire to attain to that experience which in the mystics’ eyes, as
Bonaventura wrote, “is mystical and most secret, which no one knows, except him who receives it, no
one receives except him who desires it, and no one desires except him who is in fl am ed by the fire of the
Holy Spirit which Christ sent into the world.”46

“But if you want to know how these things come about, ask grace not instruction, desire not under-
stand in g, the groaning of prayer not diligent read in g, the Spouse not the teacher, God not man, dark-
ness not clarity, not light but the fire that totally in fl ames and carries us into God by ecstatic unctions
and burning affections.”47

The words of Bahá’u’lláh show a fundamental harmony between mystical hermeneutics as expounded
above and scriptural hermeneutics as propounded in the Bahá’í writings. In the Bahá’í writings, too,
understanding of the scared Word is held to be conditioned on a spiritual orientation, and the pursuit
of knowledge is framed in a paradigm of spiritual beliefs, attitudes and skills that are said to mediate
true learning:

> Know verily that Knowledge is of two kinds: Divine and Satanic. The one welleth out from the
> fountain of divine inspiration; the other is but a reflection of vain and obscure thoughts. The
> source of the former is God Himself; the motive-force of the latter the whisperings of selfish
> desire. The one is guided by the principle: “Fear ye God; God will teach you”; the other is but a
> confirmation of the truth: “Knowledge is the most grievous veil between man and his Creator.”
> The former bringeth forth the fruit of patience, of longing desire, of true understand in g, and
> love; whilst the latter can yield naught but arrogance, vainglory and conceit.... The heart must
> needs therefore be cleansed from the idle say in gs of men, and sanctified from every earthly
> affection, so that it may discover the hidden meaning of divine inspiration, and become the
> treasury of the mysteries of divine knowledge.48
The key distinction here appears to center not so much around a different methodology in purely tech-
nical terms, but around a distinctive orientation with its accompanying effect. For instance, in relation
to scripture, a reading of the sacred Word whose “motive-force” is “the whisperings of selfish desire” is
likely to lead in the scholar to “arrogance, vainglory and conceit” and be in danger of acting as a “most
grievous veil between man and his Creator.” The conclusions drawn will, it appears, be “but a reflection
of vain and obscure thoughts.” On the other hand, a reading that is informed by a personal quest for
divine inspiration and conscious effort to cleanse and sanctify one’s motivation and perspective, will
make the heart receptive to divine inspiration and knowledge—that is, spiritually informed insight. The
measure of success in this endeavour is again attitudinal at heart: yielding “the fruit of patience, of long-
ing desire, of true understand in g, and love.” The same may be said of any branch of knowledge, although
perhaps none more so than scriptural study.

The implication seems to be that Bahá’u’lláh regards all knowledge potentially as a bridge towards that
supra-discursive knowledge which the mystics strive for. He thus links the pursuit of knowledge to the
mystic’s quest and the practice of worship, which, as Shoghi Effendi adumbrated, has at its heart “that
mystic feeling which unites Man with God.” Hence, the famous sentence cited by Bahá’u’lláh in the Book
of Certitude among other places, “Knowledge is one point, which the foolish have multiplied.”49 From
this perspective true knowledge is a spiritual, mystical state of communion with God (the “single point”)
that may be triggered by, but not contained in human lear n in g. When human learning is earnestly pur-
sued in a spirit of worship and mystical quest, the process of scholarship becomes a process of reunion

\[128\] Mystical Language, Revelation and Scholarship

with God. When human learning is on the other hand divorced from spiritual questing, and particularly
when it is driven by egotistical or selfish motivations, it acts as a dissociative process separating the
scholar’s soul from his Beloved, and impeding the flow of that “mystic feeling” of the presence of God
within the soul, which Bahá’u’lláh, no less than the mystics under review, equates with true understand-
ing.

What if any are the methodological implications of such an orientation? Clearly, the above perspec-
tive is not methodologically prescriptive in a technical way. Two scholars could look at the same passage
of scripture with identical methodologies and even possibly reach identical conclusions, even if their
spiritual orientation was diametrically opposite. What would certainly differ would be the effect of the
process upon each scholar’s soul, with one reaping the fruit of vainglory, and the other the fruit of love.
But in addition, the likelihood is that the process of investigation, the tone of their writings, and the
relationship to existing scholarship will also differ. These are the key areas where a mystical orientation
to scholarship as described above would have a bear in g.

For instance, a mystically oriented scholarship could include in the process of investigation the culti-
vation of prayer, and, within a Bahá’í paradigm, possibly consultation as well. The tone of one’s utter-
ance might seek consciously to be consensus building and constructive, and strenuously avoid contro-
versy and intemperate criticism of differing views. Existing scholarship would be reviewed in a spirit of
impartiality, humility, and great courtesy, using, particularly when offering constructive criticism,
“words as mild as milk.”50 This does not mean that only spiritually informed scholarship would be
adorned with these virtues, as those potentialities are open to all scholars to a greater or lesser degree.
But a spiritual orientation to scholarship is likely to generate the motive power to make this process
increasingly ref in ed, penetrating, and profound.

Within the Bahá’í community the possibility exists to evolve a distinctive culture of scholarship,
whose ultimate object could be to lead oneself and one’s audience to a closer relationship with the
Div in e. In such a culture the language of scholarship would be likely to develop gradually over decades
and centuries into a vehicle of spiritual evocation as well as technical description. Whether this per-
spective is valid or not, Bahá’í scholarship over the coming decades face the challenge of experimenting
with diverse approaches to bringing spirituality and faith to bear on the scholarly endeavour. Some will
be inc l in ed towards a min im al ist approach that keeps religion as far as possible implicit rather than
explicit in methodologies and outcomes. Others are likely to make bold to bring faith to bear in a more
explicit fashion in their scholarship, while still others are likely to experiment with both approaches in
accordance with the different audiences for their scholarly endeavour. As has been the case in previous
religious traditions it seems plausible to expect that the fruit of the present ferment of scholarly effort
in the Bahá’í community will eventually be a distinctively Bahá’í paradigm of scholarship within which
a number of methodologies coexist. As with previous faith traditions, this paradigm is likely in due
course to integrate a devotional, even mystical orientation, which has at its heart a consciousness of the
ineffability and transformative inf luence of true knowledge. The voice of Henry Suso might well come
in due course to resonate with the deep voice of Bahá’í scholarship:

> What I experience is bottomless; what I love is endless; and therefore, what I want to say is
> wordless.

Appendix: Biographical Information
On the Franciscan side, the first of our mystics is St. Bonaventura (c.1217–1274), described at times as
the Franciscan Order’s second founder. Born at a time when the Franciscan order was reaching its peak,
he was to become one of its foremost scholars and mystics. Although from the moment he joined the
Franciscans (1243), and especially after he became Minister General of the Order, Bonaventura lived a
life of intense activity, scholarly and adm in is t rative, his mystical writings and widely acknowledged
saintliness testify to the unm is takable richness of his inner life. Of his many writings dedicated to the
mystical life, we have chosen to focus on his Itinerarium Mentis in Deum (translated as “The Soul’s

Journey into God”), widely recognized as his masterpiece. The book was widely read in the Middle Ages
and is today the most popular of his many works. Contemplative rather than lyrical in tone, it brought
together and correlated existing traditions of spirituality centered on nature, on the soul and on God
and integrated them in the form of a meditation on St. Francis' climactic vision of a six winged Seraph,
where each wing became a mode of contemplating and reaching unto God.

There follows Jacopone da Todi (c.1230–1306). Born from an aristocratic Umbrian fam il y, Jacopone
became, after studying in Bologna, the medieval academic stronghold of the legal profession, a notaio,
a position mixing the roles of lawyer and accountant. On the death of his wife, “for reasons that are
more or less plausibly conjectural” (Hughes, p. xix), he turned his back on his previous life and embarked
on a life of extreme penitence. After ten years privations, in his late forties, he joined the Franciscan
order. At this time (1278), the friars minor were undergoing great convulsions that would before long lead
to an open schism between the Spirituals, overridingly committed to Francis’ ideal of poverty, which had
been watered down by the Papacy, and the Conventuals, also committed to poverty, but equally com-
mitted to Francis’ ideal of obedience to ecclesiastical authority, which demanded a measure of compro-
mise in observing the rule of poverty. Jacopone, predictably, sided prominently with the Spirituals, and
was lead into direct conf lict with Pope Boniface VIII, resulting in his excommunication and imprison-
ment, commuted only on the death of Boniface the VIII by his successor, Benedict XI. Less contempla-
tive and more lyrical than Bonaventura’s mystical writings, Jacopone’s Lauds are said to represent the
best Italian poetry before Dante. Full of fervour and passion, they are informed by a philosophical ele-
ment that makes his mysticism at once deep and stir r in g. Interestingly, Sufi influence has been traced in
his poems, from the incantatory repetition of particular words in a manner reminiscent of Dhikr,
through the concept of self-ann ih il ation as the means of attainment and the personification of this self-
ann ih il ation and of other virtues in the form of a maiden, to the use of the Qur’ánic image of man as
created from a sorry germ.

Roughly contemporary to Jacopone da Todi, Angela di Foligno (c.1248–c.1309) was also born in the
region of Umbria of prosperous parents. She did not have formal school in g, but is said to have been able
to read and possibly to write. She married at twenty, leading a very active social life until, troubled by a
sin, possibly of a sexual nature, she went to confession, but, too ashamed to tell the whole story, received
Communion conscious of her transgression. The resulting struggle with her conscience precipitated her
conversion, which she describes in eighteen steps, leading to her experiencing a profound “sentiment of
God” in prayer. Thereafter we follow her progress in a series of temptations and a multitude of ecstatic,
rapturous visions that stimulate contemplation on the nature of God, the sufferings of Christ, and the
Trinity. An ecstatic through and through, her attitudes strike one oftentimes as extreme, yet her expe-
riences, at a deeper level, appear as both ardent and profound, and invariably exalted. Unlike Jacopone,
there is no sign that she engaged in any way in the controversies that were pulling the Franciscans apart
during her life time.

Turning now to the Dom in i cans, we may begin by Henry Suso (c.1300–1365). Born in the region of
Swabia to a noble fam il y, Suso joined the Dominicans in his early teens. From that early age he experi-
enced for some years, usually twice a day, ecstatic states and manifold visions of Christ, of the Virgin,
of Eternal Wisdom, and of the Sa in ts. His early life was characterized by a rigorous asceticism, which,
however, became less extreme as his sense of real iz ation increased. He studied at Cologne where he
would have heard Eckhart preach, and in his Little Book of Truth speaks of him as “the master.”
Although sympathetic, Suso was an independent thinker, as Davies remarked. Suso’s Little Book of
Eternal Wisdom was one of the most popular mystical books of the Middle Ages, both for its readabili-
ty (Suso puts the dialogue form to very good use in the form of a discussion between a disciple and
Eternal Wisdom), and for its depth, clarity and spiritual uplift. His Little Book of Truth deals pr im ar i-
ly with the concept of mystical union, and contains, in addition, a defense of Eckhart and a description
of the process of self-abandonment by which we reach unto God.

John Tauler (c.1300–1361), another leading Rhineland mystic and a contemporary of Suso’s , was born
in Strasbourg from a respectable citizen family. Like Suso, he joined the Dominicans in his early teens
and, after two years’ novitiate and eight years of study in Strasbourg, was sent to Cologne for higher

\[130\] Mystical Language, Revelation and Scholarship

studies. It is highly probable that he heard Eckhart’s preaching at both Strasburg and Cologne. By age 25
he was an ordained priest and is said to have adopted already the mystical path. Tauler’s legacy is his ser-
mons, which he preached from then until his death. Other works ascribed to him appear to be spurious.
His sermons may be divided, typically, into those of the year and those devoted to Holy Days. It is the
latter of these that we have studied in translation. The sermons are prominent in Marian devotion,
Dionysian theology and Eckartian mysticism, and are generally sober and cautious, yet uplifting and
illum in ating. To Jacopone da Todi’s self-ann ih il ation and Suso’s self-abandonment, Tauler posits the
dying life as the path of perfection. His discussion of the angelic hierarchies as relating to the various
areas or levels of the self is fascinating.

Finally we arrive at Catherine of Siena (1347–1380), the only woman besides St. Theresa of Avila to
have been granted the title of Doctor of the Roman Catholic Church, for which she had to wait nearly
six hundred years after her death. Born in Siena in the period of the Black Death, she was, for a change,
the child of a lower-class family. She is said to have vowed her virginity to God from age seven, and from
youth to have received visions and other mystical experiences. At age twenty she had a profound experi-
ence of mystical marriage to Christ, after which she gave herself wholly to Him. She practiced, like
Angela di Foligno, great charity, caring for the sick and the poor. Her reputation as a spiritual counselor
grew unstoppably, aided by the support and devotion of her confessor and disciple, Raymond of Capua.
She became involved in contemporary politics in the conflict between city-states and papacy, and exer-
cised considerable inf luence on the papacy and on the Italian cities. In her last years she wrote the
Dialogue, her crowning work, in the form of a dialogue between herself and God where God responds
to her requests for illum in ation on various aspects of the mystical life. Although intricate, the book is
extremely rich in wisdom and spirituality, and is often very beautiful indeed.
