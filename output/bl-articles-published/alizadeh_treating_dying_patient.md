rightfully suggest that those costs are
immense.

Furthermore, our lives are charac-
terized by processes of change—as
soon as we are born, we journey to-
ward death, at least insofar as our
mortal lives are concerned. It is my
own belief that our essential reality
does not stop with the cessation of
our physical bodies. But regardless of
whether one believes in an afterlife,
we can all strive to remain mindful of
mortality on a regular basis in order
that we may maximize the potential of
our individual lives.

Finally, my job as an oncologist
mirrors my duty as a Bahá’í which is
to serve people—first to do no harm,
and then to assist one another as, in
time, we all prepare to leave the shore
of this world. So it is that after each
case, I had best reflect on Bahá’u’lláh’s
teaching:

> O Son of the Supreme! I have

I made the light to shed on thee
