                      Service, Joy and Sacrifice
An Essay on Commentaries by ‘Abdu’l-Bahá

James B. Thomas

Abstract

> Throughout the many talks that ‘Abdu’l-Bahá gave in His epic journey to the
> west on 1912, He consistently interspersed the subjects of service and sacrifice.
> These presuppose basic choices that must be made in changing purpose from self
> interest to sharing. Moreover, such sharing and service must reach beyond an
> individual’s ‘comfort zone’ to have any significance. This essay deals with barri-
> ers to such change and with the unexpected but uplifting rewards that follow. It
> further emphasizes the fact of our spiritual nature and the challenge we face in
> recognizing that fact. The subjects of choice, levels of sacrifice, tests, difficul-
> ties and ultimate sacrifice are compared with respect to the priority of service
> to God and man. In the process of shifting a personal paradigm from self-inter-
> est to concern for others, one will often experience spiritual transformation.
> Within this context, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá provides a supreme example of a life of ser-
> vice to God and to humankind. He expounds upon the meaning of suffering and
> the mystery of sacrifice. We will examine ever-deepening levels of this subject
> with the purpose of ascertaining why it is so important to human life.
