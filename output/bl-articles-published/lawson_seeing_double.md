                    Seeing Double:

    The Messenger ef God stood up amongst tlze people and then praised and glorzjied God as He
      deserved and then he mentioned the DqjJdl, srging, 'I warn you ef him, and there wa.s no
   prophet who did not wam his followers ef him; but I rvill tell you something about him which
            no prophet has told his followers: the DajJdl is one-e_yed whereas God is not."

  The Tablet of Alfrnad has been identified as one of a number of prayers invested
  by Baha'u'llah with a special potency. 2 Baha'is and others may reasonably ask what
  such a statement means. What is the potency referred to? How is a particular
  prayer charged with such a power? Upon what does such povver act and how can
  we tell if it has acted? And by what criteria are we able to determine that a partic-
  ular prayer has been so invested? Can we actually establish double-blind
  experiments by which to test the efficacy of particular prayers and incantations?
       These questions quickly begin to sound a bit strange ... 'pre-scientific', if you
  will. Are we therefore meant simply to accept that the Tablet of Alp:nad and the
  others identified by Shoghi Effendi (the Long Healing Prayer, the Fire Tablet) are
  especially efficacious and powerful and not trouble our brains about what such a
  statement means? It would appear that this attitude borders on the 'blind imitation'
  (originally taqlid) so vehemently denounced by Baha'u'llah.3 Shoghi Effendi himself
  underscores the reasonableness of the God posited by this religion, a position fully
  consonant with one of the more well-known Baha'i principles: the harmony of
  science and religion.4
       The proposition here to be tested is that at the heart of the power of the Tablet
  of Alp:nad is a concern with the Covenant (mithaq/'ahd). The Covenant here would
  be the metahistorical Greater Covenant identified by the Baha'i teachings as having
  been enacted and invoked several times throughout history, most recently through
- the proclamation of Baha'u'llah's own mission.s Each Covenant-taking depends for
  its meaning on the one immediately preceding it, as explained by ~bdu'l-Baha:

      His Holiness Abraham, on Him be peace, made a covenant concerning His
      Holiness Moses and gave the glad-tidings of His coming. His Holiness Moses made
      a covenant concerning the Promised One; i.e. His Holiness Christ, and announced
      the good news of His Manifestation to the world. His Holiness Christ made a
      covenant concerning the Paraclete and gave the tidings of His coming. His
      Holiness tl1e Prophet Mutiammad made a covenant concerning His Holiness the
      Bab and the Bab was the One promised by M~1ammad, for Mul,1ammad gave the
                                                                                            --
                                  THE BAHA'I Ei\ITH ,.\1'\TD THE WORLD'S RELIGIONS


    tidings of His coming. The Bab made a Covenant concerning the Blessed Beauty
    of Baha'u'llah and gave the glad-tidings of His coming for the Blessed Beauty was
    the One promised by His Holiness the Bab. Baha'u'lliih made a covenant
    concerning a promised One who >vill become manifest after one thousand or
    thousands of years. He likewise, with His Supreme Pen, entered into a great
    Covenant and Testament with all the Baha'is whereby they were all commanded to
    follow the Centre of the Covenant after His departure, and turn not away even to
    a hair's breadth from obeying Him. 6

Thus, Covenant also includes the specific stipulations in the Baha'i ·writings indi-
cating how divine authority is to be extended after the passing of Baha'u'llah. This
authority (walqya/vildyat) was vested first in 'A.bdu'l-Baha (d. 1921), the Centre of the
Covenant (markaz-i mithtiq), then in Shoghi Effendi (d. 1957), the Guardian of the
Cause of God (wali amru,lldh).7 Today, according to the teachings of the Baha'i
Faith, authority is vested in the institution of the Universal House of Justice. We
will begin our investigation of this topic with the Covenant in Islam. We will then
proceed to the Covenant as it is referred to in the Tablet of AJ:tmad and close with
some remarks on the literary qualities of the Tablet and the reading strategies used
in order to access them. Throughout the discussion, the idea of 'seeing double' is
used to try to convey the basic structure of the reading act so important in regis-
tering the power which is the subject of this investigation. Basically, 'seeing double'
refers to being able to see two things at once, a basic requirement of metaphorical
th.inking, which is in fact anagogical perception, a perspective whereby the world is
seen as it truly is: an arena for the appearance of the divine. 8 In order to register
this reality, the observer must cultivate the ability to look at phenomena and at the
same time look beyond phenomena. It is in th.is process that the world and all
created things are discovered to be transparent while the sacred light of God shines
through them.9 This same process, according to Baha'i teachings, is involved in
reading holy scripture. In the case of scripture, 'seeing double' means both looking
at the words and looking in the direction beyond the words indicated by the
context. Both the sacred writings of the Baha'i Faith (and sacred writings in
general) and the phenomena of the world are 'sig11s' by means of which the
reader/believer may encounter holiness. 10               .




The Covenant in Islam

The idea, if not the word, of Covenant is one of the oldest and most enduring in reli-
gious history. 11 It denotes a promise from God to continue to guide, bless and reward
humanity as long as humanity conforms to God's plan, law and will. There is space
here only to discuss, very sketchily, the Covenant in Islam with particwar concentra-
tion on the Covenant in Shi'i Islam. 12 Further, we will focus on those aspects of the
Covenant in Shi'i Islam that are seen to be directly related to the spirit and form of
the Baha'i teachings here represented by the Tablet of AJ:tmad, a relatively short
prayer revealed by Baha'u'llah for an Iranian follower sometime in 1865. 13
SEEING DOUBLE: THE COVENANT AND THE TABLET OF Al:J]v.1AD/Lawson                         41

     The purpose of the Covenant may be thought, in the first instance, to provide
spiritual strength to human beings who, while communicating through some
medium with an invisible God, suffer the various challenges, tests, reversals and
failw·es and illsappointments that occur during the earthly experience. The
Covenant says to us: if things go contrary to your plans here, continue to have faith
and to obey the law of God because by doing so you will be fulfilling your part of
the agreement or contract and God, who never reneges, will honour this agreement
and reward you for your diligence, perseverance and faith. Of course the nature of
the reward is construed in a number of ways and there is no space to discuss all of
them or even many of them. Reward 'in the next world' is the most familiar. But in
Shi'i Islam this eschatology is understood in both a this-worldly and an ~ther­
worldly way In Islam in general, the Covenant is seen to have been instituted so
that when, o.n the Day of Judgement 0iawm al-din), or the Day of Resurrection
(yawm al-qfyarna), the children of Adam (that is to say all humanity) are gathered
before the throne of God to receive His judgement, none •vill be able to say that
they were unaware of God's command to obedience and faith because they had not
been told of it~ none can claim ignorance of the law - because God had sealed
the Covenant and all humanity's assent to it on a special occasion (recounted in the
Qur'an at 7:172-4) 'before' the actual creation of the world. The Quranic passage
runs as follows:

       Remember when thy Lord drew fortl1
       From tl1e Children of Adam -
       From ilieir 1oins -
       Their descendants, and made them
       Testify concerning tl1emselves, (saying):
       :'\m I not your Lord
       (Who cherishes and sustains you)?'
       They said: 'Yea!
       We do testify!' (This), lest
       Ye should say on the Day
       Of Judgement: 'Of tl1is we
       Were never mindful':
       Or lest ye should say:
       'Our fathers before us
       May have taken false gods,
       But we are (their) descendants
       After them: wilt Thou then
       Destroy us because of the deeds
       Of men who were futile.'
       Thus do We eA'}Jla.in
       The Signs in detail;
       And perchance they may turn
       (Unto Us). (Adapted Yusuf Ali translation)
                                    THE   BAHA'I FAITH A.t"\ill THE WORLD'S RELIGIONS

 This passage touches on a basic Islamic philosophy of history: communities and
 nations have flourished or failed according to their obedience to God's command
 and faithfulness to His Covenant. Not only wilJ observance of the Covenant benefit
 one on the Day of Judgement and in the next world, it wilJ aJso benefit the commu-
nity here in the world: in history. If humanity is faithful to the Covenant, God wilJ
 continue to send guidance. Nations that have prospered may be seen to have kept
 the law of God and His Niessengers while those that have failed or become extinct
 have only their own heedlessness to blame. Just as the creation story in Genesis
begins time for theJudaeo-Christian tradition, it is of utmost importance to note that
 this verse locates the beginning of 'Islamic time', and therefore the institution of reli-
gious authority, in an event that takes place in a primordial realm of pre-existence. 14
      To the degree that the primordial founding event referred to in the Qur'an is
thus incalculably more ancient than the time depicted in the biblical creation story,
it may therefore also be thought to be, by virtue of this more venerable provenance,
just that much more pure, accurate and incumbent or imperative. The event as
recounted in the Islamic scripture may be seen to be persuasive of the proposition
of the divine sanction and authority for the Islamic dispensation on the historical
plane. The Islamic dispensation began functionally with the birth of the prophet
Muhammad (c. 570 CE) and his call to the prophetic office (c. 610 CE). The official
date for the reckoning of the Islamic period is the year 622 CE, the year of the Hijra.
Muslims were able to demonstrate the truth of Islam to the followers of other reli-
gions in part by referring to this passage in the Qur' an and the various
supplemental teachings contained in the Hadith. The emerging image of the
Covenant is that together with its other functions it also puts the truth claims of
Islam on a much more unassailable basis than, say, the Hebrew narrative telling of
the world beginning, as the latter deals only with mundane creation. This view is
exemplified in the following two Traditions from the sixth ImamJa'far al-$adiq:

    One of the Quraysh said to the Messenger of God: 'By what thing do you claim
    precedence (al-sabiqa) over all the other prophets inasmuch as you came after
    them?' The Prophet said: 'I was the first to affirm faith (amana "to believe") in my
    Lord and the first to answer when God took Covenant with the prophets and made
    them testify against themselves ('ala' arifUsihim) with the words ''.Am I not your Lord?"
    They said "Yea verily" I was the first prophet to say "yea verily''! (bala'). In this way
    I outstripped the others in offering allegiance to God.'

    The first to say 'Yea verily' was the Apostle of God and that was because he, of all
    creation, was closest to God. He was in the place where Gabriel spoke to him
    during the Night Journey saying: 'Approach, 0 Muhammad and walk the path no
    other has walked, neither angel nor sent prophet.' And were it not that his spirit
    and his soul were in that place, he would never have been able to attain. He was
    near God as He has indicated 'The distance of two bows, or closer still' [Qur'an
    53:9], that is he was 'closer still'. 15

        With the Quranic story of the Day of the Covenant we have the assertion that the
        truth of Islam (and by possible association whatever government or worldly power
        has taken it upon itself to defend and expand its territories in the name of Islam)
        transcends - 'outstrips' - the truth heretofore expressed in other earlier scriptures.
        In addition, this new expression of the truth has in1plications for the life of the indi-
        vidual and the community which will produce new modes of religiosity and new
         emphases on what it means to be religious. For it was not only the practitioners of
        a private piety who saw in it nourishment for the individual spiritual quest.
             In addition to having implications for eschatology and other purely religious
        considerations, the parable of the Covenant also has implications for community
        life in that it establishes a standard for agreements between human beings. Thus is
        life in the world spiritualized by a 'literary' connection with the spiritual world. The
        Quranic parable or myth of the Covenant (mit!ui.ql'ahflii is seen as the model for all
        agreements amongst and between Muslirns. ' 6 Such agreements play a large role in
        early Islamic history: '.Aqaba, al-Hudaybiyah, Ghadir Khumm and after the death
        of the Prophet when the majority of the community gave their oath of allegiance
        to Abu Bakr. It is this act of allegiance or oath-taking (bqy'a)'7 that is symbolic of
        obedience to Islam and God through allegiance to God's earthly representative. A
        specific act of allegiance, whether it be primarily to a Sufi Shaykh, the Sunni
        Caliph or the Shi'i Imam is felt as symbolic and reiterative - perhaps even as a
        performative recital - of the primordial act of allegiance of Qur'an p72. Thus to
        offer allegiance to or recognize the spiritual authority of one of these figures is
        referred to as tawalM, a word based on the root w-l-y from which are derived such
        in1portant words as mawla ~ord, master, protector, friend, client), wali (guardian,
        friend, 'saint'; pl. awlhia 'friends' frequently construed in the Qur'an as the 'friends
        of God', e.g. :i:o:63) and waldya (guardianship, authority, 'sainthood').' 8 This passage
        is the sacred paradigm for such oath-giving and taking. In a sense, any rime
        someone makes an agreement and swears to honour it, they are participating in this
        primordial Covenant told in the Qur'an.
             One of the most important of these occasions is tl1e one that occurred during
        the Prophet's return to Medina after his last pilgrimage to :Mecca. Both Sunni and
        Shi'i authorities record the famous episode of Ghadir Khumm during which
        Jv1uhammad is understood by the Shi'a to have nominated 'Ali as his successor
        (khalifa) and the Imam of the Muslim community (umma) with the rank of Guardian
        of the Cause (wali al-ami-). According to Sunni Muslin1s, this episode merely estab-
        lishes 'Ali's special status in the community without bestowing upon him any special
r·•··   authority to govern in a religio-political sense as the embodiment of divine guid-
I
        ance. One of the more frequent derogatory slurs used by the Shi'a against the
        Sunnis is precisely the Quranic term naqi¢: 'breal<er', that is to say, of the Covenant
        established by the Prophet between himself, his community and 'Ali as his successor
        during this historic gathering at the famous Pool of Khumm during the Prophet's
        return from the Farewell pilgrimage.'9 These breal<ers of the Covenant are consid-
        ered to have 'turned away from' (tabarra, the opposite of tawallt1) divine guidance. It
        is known as the Event of Ghadir Khumm and its anniversary is one of the main
44                                      THE   BAHA'I FAITH AND THE WORLD'S RELIGIONS

     holy days in the Shi'i liturgical calendar2° where it is referred to as either the Day
     of al-Ghadir or, more pertinently, the Day of the Covenant (precisely: yawm al-
     mithaq). Here the all-important distinctions between the Sunnis and Shi'is are
     focussed not on a disagreement over the facts of the event but rather on the more
     'scholastic' question of the proper meaning of one of the key words in the sermon,
     namely maw!!t: 'master'. A brief excerpt from the relevant Arabic source is offered
     here:

         The travellers all gathered before [Muhammad] ... When they had gathered, he
         climbed above the.travellers so that he was high above them and he summoned the
         Commander of the Faithful [i.e. '.A...li, see below], peace be upon him. He made him
         come up with him so that he stood on his right. He then began to address the
         people. He. praised and glorified God, and preached most eloquently. He gave the
         community news of his own death, saying: 'I have been summoned and it is nearly
         the moment for me to answer. The time has come for me to depart from you. I
         leave behind me among you two all-important things [i.e. al-thaqalayn, see below]
         which, if you cleave to them, you will never go astray - that is the Book of God and
         my offspring from my family [ahl al-bqyt]. They wilJ never abandon you until they
         lead you to me at the (sacred) waters (of Heaven).'
             Then he called out at the top of his voice: 'Am I not more appropriate (to rule)
         you than yourselves?'
              'By God, yes!' they answered [or 'Yea verily!' Arabic: bald, as in Qur'an TI72
         quoted above].
              He went on speaking continuously without any interruption and taking both
         arms of the Commander of the Faithful, peace be upon him, and raising them so
         that the white of his armpits could be seen, he said: Whoever I am the master
         (mawla') of, this man, '.Ali, is his master. 0 God, befriend whoever befriends him, be
         hostile to whoever opposes him, support whoever supports him and desert whoever
         deserts him.' 21
             Then he, peace be on him, went down. It was the time of the mid-morning
         heat ... He led them in the midday prayer. Then he, peace be on him (went to) sit
         in his tent. He ordered '.Ali, peace be on him, to sit in his tent opposite him, and he
         ordered the Muslims to go in group after group to congratulate hi.ID on his po~ition
         and to acknowledge his command over the faithful. All the people did that. Then
         he ordered his wives and the rest of the wives of the fuithful who were with him to
         go to him and acknowledge his command over the faithful. They did that
             Among those who were profuse in their congratulations on his position was
         'U mar b. al-Khattab. He gave a public appearance of great joy at it, saying: 'Bravo,
         bravo, 'Ali, you have become my master and the master of every believing man and
         woman.' 22

     Because the Shi'a clearly seem to have failed in history and frequently suffered
     persecution as a dissenting minority (that is, until the time of the Safavids,
     1501-1724, and for a while during the time of the Fatimids in the roth-uth
                 SEEING DOUBLE: THE COVENANT AND THE TABLET OF Af:IMAD/Lawson                                 45

                 centuries), the focus in Shi'i piety vis-a-vis the Covenant was on a future date: the
                 return of the Hidden Imam who would, on the Day of Resurrection/Judgement
                 01awm al-qi)'!tma/ din) rise up (qci'im) to restore justice to an unjust world - a justice
                 which had vanished with the most recent breaking of the divine Covenant by the
                 perfidious followers of Muhammad who usurped '.Ali's authority when his foster
                 brother, cousin, father-in-law, protector and friend, Muhammad, the Prophet of
                 God, died in 632 without leaving a clearly written will and testament or Covenant
                 (mitlzciq!'ahd). All those who assented to the primordial Covenant mentioned in the
                 Qur'an would be tested once again as to the sincerity of their oath when the
                 Hidden Imam returned.
                      A very strong theme in Shi'i religious works, therefore, sees the above Quranic
                 passage as referring precisely to the special Covenant between God and
                 Muhammad and '.Ali. I will quote only a few passages from this material. 2 3 In the
                 course of explaining how '.Ali acquired the nickname 'Commander of the Faithful',
                 the following Tradition takes form:

                 MlJl:iammad al-Baqir [the fifth Imam] answered the question from Jabir: 'When
                 did the Amir al-Mu'minin [literally "Commander of the Believers or Faithful"] get
                 this name?' al-Baqir said: 'God named him when He first revealed the verse
                 "Remember when God took a covenant: [The part of this verse which says] 'Am I
                 not your Lord? (Qur'an p72) [was originally extended with the following:] and is
                 not Muhammad My Apostle and is not '.Ali the Commander of the Faithful?"''

                 In the next Tradition, on the authority of Da'ud al-Raqqi, a disciple of the fifth
                 Imam Mul:iammad al-Baqir (d. 735), we have a narrative explaining how tl1e Imams
                 acquired their authority:

                     When God wanted to create creation he scattered [their seeds, dharr24] before Him
                     and said to them: 'Who is your Lord?' The first to speak (nafaqa) were the Apostle
                     of God, the Commander of the Faithful and the [rest of the] Imams. They said:
                     'Thou art our Lord.' So, He charged them with knowledge and religion. Then He
                     said to the angels: 'These are the bearers of My religion and My lmowledge and
                     t11ey are lvfy trustees (umanci') among My creation.'
                          Then He said to the Children of Adam: 'Testify (iqrar) to God's lordship
                     (rububp1a) and submit to their guardianship (walqya) and obedience.' They
                     responded: 'O our Lord we do submit!'
                          Then God said to the angels: 'This 0Ne imposed) lest you should say in t11e
     (       I

     '·
                     future (sic: not al-qiyama) "Of this we were never mindful. Our fathers before us took
     :··             false gods. And we are but their descendants after them. Wilt Thou then destroy us
         j
     '
     I               because of t11e deeds of men who followed falsehood?'" (c£ Qur'an p73)
..   1,                   [The fifth Imam Mu\1ammad] al-Baqir said: 'O Da'ud! Our aut11ority (walqya)
                     was made incumbent upon [lmmanity] during the [primordial day of theJ
                     Covenant (mitluiq). "5
                                 THE BAHA'I FAITH AND THE WORLD'S RELIGIONS

In sum, the Covenant in Shi'i Islam guarantees the Guardianship (waLqya) of the
Imams as the rightful successors of Muhammad as well as guaranteeing
Nluhammad's role as the renewer of the divine and eternal Covenant for his time
and place. As we saw, in one Tradition the assertion of the Prophet Muhammad's
authority entailed also establishing his superiority over all other prophets and
messengers. It is hoped that the following exploration of the theme of the Covenant
in the Tablet of Al;mad will help us better to appreciate the intimate relationship
between Islam and the Baha'i Faith by highlighting essential similarities and
distinctions.


The Covenant in the Baha'i Faith

We have noted how religious and spiritual authority (walaya) is seen to be preserved
by the Covenant so that it is really quite impossible to think of the one without the
other. They are inseparable in Islam and inseparable in the Baha'i Faith. As
everyone knows, the Baha'i Faith was born in an Islamic enVironment. The signif-
icance of this fact has been expressed on behalf of Shoghi Effendi in the following
words:

   The Baha'i view on [the position and significance of Islam in the history of
   civilizationJ is that the Dispensation of Mul:tammad, like all other Divine Dis-
   pensations, has been fore-ordained, and that as such forms an integral part of the
   Divine plan for the spiritual, moral and social development of mankind. It is not
   an isolated religious phenomenon, but is closely and historically related to the
   Dispensation of Christ, and those of the Bab and Baha'u'llah. It was intended by
   God to succeed Christianity, and it was therefore the duty of the Christians to
   accept it as firmly as they had adhered to the religion of Christ .
        . . . Islam constitutes a fuller revelation of God's purpose for mankind. The so-
   called Christian civilization of which the Renaissance is one of the most striking
   manifestations is essentially Muslim in its origins and foundations. When medieval
   Europe was plunged in darkest barbarism, the Arabs, regenerated and transformed
   by the spirit .re.leased. by the religion of Mul:tamma.d, were busily engaged in
   establishing a civilization the like of which their contemporary Christians in
   Europe had never 'Nitnessed before. It was eventually through Arabs that
   civilization was introduced to the West. It was through them that the philosophy,
   science and culture which the old Greeks had developed found their way to Europe
   ... It is wholly unfair to attribute the effiorescence of European culture during the
   Renaissance period to the influence of Christianity: It was mainly the product of
   the forces released by the MuJ:iammadan Dispensation,
        From the standpoint of institutionalism Islam far surpasses true Christianity as
   we know it in the Gospels. There are infinitely more laws and institutions in the
   Qur'an than in the Gospel. vVhile the latter's emphasis is mainly, not to say wholly,
   on individual and personal conduct, the Qur'an stresses the importance of society.
   This social emphasis acquires added importance and significance in the Baha'i

    Revelation. ' Vhen carefully and impartially compared, the Qur'an marks a definite
                 1


    advancement on the Gospel, from the standpoint of spiritual and humanitarian
    progress.
        . . . The Bal1a'is should try to study history anew, and to base all their
    investigations first and foremost on the written Scriptures of Islam and Christianity. 26

And Shoghi Effendi himself wrote the following:

    [The Baha'is] must strive to obtain, from sources that are authoritative and
    unbiased, a sound knowledge of the history and tenets of Islam - the source and
    background of their Faith - and approach reverently and with a mind purged from
    pre-conceived ideas the study of the Qur'an which, apart from the sacred scriptures
    of the Babi and Baha'i Revelations, constitutes the only Book which can be
    regarded as an absolutely autl1enticated Repository of the Word of God. They
    must devote special attention to the investigation of those institutions and
    circumstances that are directly com1ected with the origin and birth of their Faith,
    with the station claimed by its Forerunner, and ,'\Tith the laws revealed by its
    Author. 2 7

One of the ways in which the institution of the Covenant is reinforced in Baha'i
writings is through the many references to and quotations from the Qur'an and the
Holy Traditions. Such references are far from being merely learned gestures or
displays. k suggested above in the citation of the Tradition of Ghadir Khumm
where the word al-tliaqaloyn (the 'two precious things' viz., the Qur'an and the
Imams) occurs, these two 'literary' sources represent the condensation in human
language of divine authority and guidance. 28 Thus, when Baha'u'llah or the Bab or
:l\.bdu'l-Baha appear to us to 'quote' from them by using phrases, words or symbols
taken from the Qur'an and Hadith, they are really involcing this same divine
authority and demonstrating the continuity of Muhammad's Covenant (which had
already demonstrated continuity withjesus' Covenant and all of the earlier prophets
in the Abrahamic and Arabian tradition). Quotation here is a participation in, and
an affirmation, appropriation, celebration, invocation, 'cantillation', deployment,
reprise and enacting of the divine authority of the eternal Covenant. 2 9 Words,
according to the Baha'i teachings, are sources of extraordinary power and influence.
For example, such power is acknowledged by ~bdu'l-Baha in his lament on the
breaking of the Islamic Covenant in which he refers to the destructive power of the
words of 'Uma.r ibn al-Khagab. The eventual second Caliph of Islam is reported to
have ultimately rejected the station of l\1i with the statement, 'Verily the Book of
God is sufficient unto us.' That is to say: 'We need not follow any specific person for
guidan:ce.' AdibTa11erzadeh has summarized :l\.bdu'l-.Baha's remarks as follows:

    ... these few words, embodying the forces of negation, were so potent that tl1ey
    became tl1e prime factor in precipitating all the discord and bloodshed in the
    Islamic Dispensation. They caused the martyrdom of the Imam '.Ali and His
                                                THE BAHA.'t FAITH AND THE WORLD'S RELIGIONS

                illustrious son, Imam I:Iusayn. They gave rise to untold sufferings and death for
                countless souls within the Islamic fold. The effect of these words, according to
                '.Abdu'l-Baha's testimony, was so far-reaching that a thousand years later it brought
                about the martyrdom of the Bab and all the sufferings of Baha'u'llah.3°

            It is suggested here that one of the sources of the extraordinary power said to reside
            in the Tablet of .l\l:tmad is precisely the degree to which the Covenant is evoked
            either through reference to previous scriplure (Qur'an and Hadith) or by the gener-
            ation of new images and symbols for this most important of all agreements or
            contracts, which is given such dramatic mythic form in Qur'an 7:r72. What follows,
            then, is an exploration of a few of these words and images in an attempt to demon-
            strate our thesis. This exercise vvill at the same time, it is hoped, demonstrate some
            of the value of one of Shoghi Effendi's stronger exhortations to the Baha'is
            mentioned above: to learn about Islam.


            Covenant in the Tablet of ~ad
                                                                                                            al-ṣulṭā
al-‘alīm,   The Tablet of Al:tmad contains numerous direct and oblique references to the
            Covenant and the authority or guardianship (wald)a) associated with it. The first
al-ḥakīm
            reference is in the form of an invocation of divine names: 'He is the King, the All-
            Knowing, the Wise!' The first name al-sul/dn does not appear in the Qur'an in this
            form, which could also be rendered 'the absolute ruJer', but several instances of the
            indefinite sulfdn 'absolute rule or authority' do occur and their contexts indicate
            there is no doubt that such authority derives from God.31 The second and third
            names - al-'Ali, al-~accom - are frequent Ouranic names for God. The name 'Ali, 'the
            All-lrnowing', occurs both in the definite and indefinite form a total of r40 times in
            the Qur'an as a name of God, and baccom, 'the All-wise', similarly occurs 8r times.
            But they occur in this form together a total of 29 times and thus this combination
            of divine names may be considered one of the most characteristic of Quranic
            compound divine epithets.3 2
                 The second reference to the Covenant is the image of the 'Nightingale of
            Paradise' singing Q.£1 the 'tw:igs of the Tree of Eternity' (warqatu'l-:firdaws tughanna 'ala
            ajndn sidrat al-baqa'). Literally, the 'nightingale' is not a nightingale (bulbu0 but rather
            a dove or pigeon, the Arabic name of which - warqa - is an onomatopoeic for the
            sound of its cooing. It seems clear that Shoghi Effendi is being sensitive here to the
            literary and linguistic tastes of an audience who may fail to find the necessary
            enchantment in a reference to the pigeon of paradise. Another more interesting
            effect of this translation choice is that it removes the classical nightingale from his
            typical rosebush habitat, where because of his attraction to the beauty and scent of
            the rose, the fated bird would thrust itself against the deadly thorns so that the roses
            are made redder by the shed blood of the nightingale sacrificing its life for beauty
            expressed both visually and through the sense of smell by the roses. This is one of
            the most venerable images in the Persian poetic tradition, which can be traced to
            the influential Ruzbihan Baqli of Shiraz (cl. r22r), in whose commentary on the
        SEEING DOUBLE: THE COVENANT AND THE TABLET OF Al:UvJAD/Lawson                                   4-9

        mystical shatl.zi:Jdt or 'divine scandals' the famous statement from the Prophet is
        cited: 'The beauty of the rose is from (or 'part of' ) the glory of God (literally,
        balza'u'l!lth).' 33 But in the Tablet of l>:..l;mad, the nightingale is singing from the Tree
        of Eternity, sidrat al-baqa'. This is an image which deserves special discussion as it
        combines a number of themes and topics redolent of the institution of Covenant,
        revelation, authority and seeing double.
             There are two words for tree in Arabic that are relevant here. The usual word
        is shajara but in this passage Baha'u'llah uses sidrat. In the Qur'an 'the Lote-tree of
        the further boundary' (s3:16), is not the shajarat al-muntalzd but the.sidrat al-munta/za.
        Sidrat is the name of a species of tree and has been chosen here, one assumes, to
        evoke the Quranic passages (34:16, 53:16, 56:28) and especially 53:16 which is
        concerned with the famous night-journey of the Prophet Muhammad. l\.lthough.
        most such narratives have numerous variants - and this one is no exception - there
        is agreement on the status of the Lote-tree: it is the point in Muhammad's journey
        towards God beyond which - according to Tradition - either his guide Moses or
        Muhammad himself was not permitted to go. 34 The 'Nightingale' (a reference by
        Baha'u'llah to himself) is 'placed' in this essentially placeless and very lofty spiritual
        realm.35 Thus the short phrase is a reference and affirmation of Muhammad's spir-
        itual authority and Baha'u'llah's, as well as an evo~ation of the nearest possible
        proximity to the divine. This sidrat al-muntalza is called sidrat al-baqd' perhaps to avoid
        scandalizing readers who might be oblivious to the poetry of the spirit being sung
        here. But in reality baqa', which means eternity and permanence, connotes the same
        spiritual truth as muntahd': there is a limit to our understanding and perception of
        God. God is always beyond, hidden, unseen, absent, remote (while at the same time
        remaining closer to us than our jugular vein), sublime and transcendent, permanent
        unlike all else which is precisely the opposite: visible, present, mundane, ephemeral,
        evanescent. An understanding of eternity depends on experience of its opposite, an
        experience all human beings share. Thus 'seeing double' is necessary. One cannot
        conceive of eternity without a simultaneous conception of its opposite.
             Baqa' has other connotations as well, especial.ly in the context of Islamic mysti-
        cism where it is frequently yoked with its spiritual and semantic opposite fond':
        extinction and annihilation. In the quest of the mystic, as reiterated for example in
        the Seven Valleys, there comes a time for utter annihilation of the self in order that
        the absolute permanence of tl1e divine may be encountered. 36 Thus the 'eternity'
        of the 'Tree' is evoked to draw attention to God and to the impermanence of the
        'time-ridden' world that is its opposite. In the context of Baha'i teachings, the
        Covenant is also identified with the 'Tree' and this imagery has ramified
'i •.   throughout the tablets. The first example to come to mind is the distinctive termin-
.]

        ology used by Baha'u'llah to refer to descendants of relatives of tl1e Bab and to His
        own offspring, Afnan and Aghsan respectively; who are in reality twigs and
        branches on the Tree of the Covenant. Such t>vigs and branches are most properly
        adorned by leaves (waraqa, note the phonic similarity between leaves and 'nightin-
        gale' in the original languages) - witl10ut which the tree would soon die - another
        distinctive Baha'i term used to refer to the female members of the holy household.
                                   THE BAHA'I FAlTH Ai.'ID THE WORLD'S RELIGIONS

'Abdu'l-Baha explicitly refers to the 'tree of the Covenant' in        following passage:

    Had tl1e Covenant not come to pass, had it not been revealed from the Supreme
    Pen and had not the Book of the Covenant, like unto the ray of the Sun of Reality,
    illuminated the world, the forces of the Cause of God would have been utterly
    scattered and certain souls who were the prisoners of their own passions and lusts
    would have taken into their hands an axe, cutting the root of this Blessed Tree. 37

And from 'Abdu'l-Baha's last tablet to America the following four passages demon-
strate the aptness of associating the 'Tree of Eternity' with the Covenant:

               the power of the divine springtin1e, the dovmpour of the celestial clouds
    and the heat of the Sun of Reality, the tree of life is just beginning to grow. Before
    long, it \vill        buds, bring fortl1 leaves and fruits, and cast its shade over the
    East and       West. This Tree of Life is the Book of the Covenant.

    In           in        days, severe 'INinds have surrounded the Lamp of the
    Covenant, hoping that this brilliant Light may be extinguished, and this Tree of
    Life may be uprooted.38

    0 Lord of the Covenant! 0 luminous Star of the world! The persecuted 'Abdu'l-
    Baha has fallen into the hands of persons who appear as sheep and in reality are
    ferocious wolves; they exercise every sort of oppression, endeavour to destroy the
    foundation of the Covenant, and clain1 to be Baha'is. They strike at the root of
    the Tree of the Covenant and count themselves persecuted just as did the
    people of the Bayan who broke the Covenant of His Holiness, the Bab, and from
    six directions shot arrows of          and calumny at Thy Blessed Body.39

    Here, in a Tablet to 'Abdu'l-Baha, [Baha'u'llah] says also: 'O God! This is a Branch
    which has spmng forth from the Tree of Oneness, the Sadrat of Thy Unity.' 40


The Tree in the Qur' an
Of course, the 'tree' enjoys great popularity in        mythology and folklore of the
world. Perhaps one of the most important             of the tree, in this context, is that
it represents both the visible and invisible worlds: its visible canopy of leaves and
branches is mirrored by its invisible root system, by its verticality it unites the visible
earth with the invisible heaven, it is a symbol of life itself and it gives life. It is a
source of food and shelter. The Qur'an itself is likened to a tree that offers its shade
to the tired and weary.41 It requires sun and water and              soil to grow. All of
these aspects are readily transmuted into metaphors for the spiritual life of
humanity. But we must limit ourselves         to the         background and even that
only ve1y cursorily. Trees in the Qur'an are used as symbols of divine wrath and
pleasure, of bounty, sustenance and shelter. Trees and the ancillary ideas of fruit
SEEING DOUBLE: THE COVE.N'.ANT AND THE TABLET OF AFJMAD/Lawson                           51

and shade are referred to in the Qur'an by a variety of words. We will only discuss
three of these here.

al-sidra: This tree is mentioned four times in the Qur'an. As mentioned, it is the
'Lote-tree beyond which there is no passing' in 53:14 'shrouded in mystery' in 53:17.
In the plural form it appears in both a positive and negative light in the Qur'an. At
34:16 the wild, thorny, fruitless and shadeless lote-n·ees have replaced the once
flourishing pomegranates, dates and grapes that grew in '.Arabia Felix' before God
punished its inhabitants for turning away from Him, breaking His covenant. At
56:28, however, the cultivated, shade-giving and fruit-producing lote-trees are a
symbol of heavenly bliss, akin to the sidra mentioned in sura 53. They will provide
comfort to the so-called 'Companions of the Right Hand' in Paradise.42 So, in addi-
tion to being a symbol of divine transcendence and permanence, tliis tree is also a
symbol of 'free will': through humanity's knowledge and volition negatives may be
n·ansformed into positives.

al-shajara: The Qur'an speaks, for example, of a 'goodly tree' to which a 'goodly
word' is likened (Qur'an 14:24) and an 'evil tree' to which an 'evil word is likened
(Qur'an 14: 26). At Qur'an 17:60 mention is made of the 'accursed tree' or 'tree of
Zaqqum' whose roots are sunk in the bowels of Hell producing bitterness for its
inhabitants (see also 37:62-5, 44:43-6 and 56:52). 43 As is so often the case with the
more apocalyptic conceits of the Qur'an, a good thing is opposed by a similar bad
thing, a polar opposite. Perceiving one entails perceiving the other: seeing double.
At 16:67-8 reference is made to the 'trees' in which God has inspired the bees to
build their hives. In the esoteric exegetic tradition of Shi'ism, the bees are none
other than the Imams t:Eemselv:es whose proper home 15          m the    Tree of the
Covenant. 44
     At 22:18 'trees' are returned to nature, as it were; and described as being in a
state of worship along with all of the other natural phenomeria created by God
such as 'all things in heaven and on earth, the sun, the moon, the stars, the hills,
the trees, the animals, and a great number among mankind'. (See also 55:6 for a
similar statement.) The Qur'an immediately (and characteristically) adds 'But a
veat number are also fit for punishment.' At 32:80 the fact that fire can be brought
forth from 'green trees' (viz., through rubbing tvvo sticks together) is adduced as a
miraculous sign of God. Indeed, nature itself is seen in the Qur'an as just another
means whereby God communicates His power and will to humanity. Thus to
observe nature is in reality a double observation: one sees the visible natural
phenomenon at the same time that one 'sees' the invisible power of God. See espe-
cialJy in this connection Qur'an 27: 60: 'Has He not creat~d the heavens and the
earth and does He not send down rain from the sky? Yea, with it We cause to grow
well-planted orchards full of beauty and delight. It is not in your power to cause
the growth of the n·ees in them. Can there be another god besides God?' (See also
56:72 for a similar statement.) The tree which Adam and Eve were instructed not
to approach is mentioned several times (2:35, 7:19-20, 22). Q.ir'an 20:120-1 is
                                  THE BATu\'i FAITH AND THE WORLD'S RELIGIONS

particularly interesting: 'But Satan whispered evil to him. He said: "O Adam! Shall
I lead thee to the Tree of Eternity (sha:farati 'l-khulr!J and to a kingdom that never
decays?" So they both ate of the Tree ... 'The Burning Bush of Moses is repre-
sented in the Qur'an as the 'Tree growing upon Sinai' (23:20) or 'the blessed Tree           .
                                                                                             '!
growing on the right bank of the valley in the holy territory' (28:30). 45 Whenjonah
was cast forth from the belly of the fi.sh, God caused a large tree to grow as shelter
for him (3p46). At 48:18 a particularly interesting passage is the direct reference to
the oath sworn to Muhammad at al-Hudaybiya, an agreement referred to by
Muslims as the 'Oath of Ric;l.wan' (Bay'at al-rirj,wan) because of the language in the
following verse:

    God's good pleasure (Arabic: radiya 'l!.ahu) was with the believers when they swore
    fealty (c£ bay'a) to thee under the Tree. He knew what was in their hearts, and He
    sent down His Divine Tranquillity (al-sakina) to them and rewarded them with a
    speedy victory. (Qur'an 48:18)

The word Ric;l.van (Arabic pronunciation: rirj,wan) is important as the name
Baha'u'llah gave to the garden which was the site of the renewal of the ancient
covenant in 1863, transferring its focus from the Bab to Baha'u'llih himsel£ It is
also the name of the series of perhaps the most important holy days in the Baha'i
Faith, commemorating that sacred event. As such, the Ric;l.van holy days are analo-
gous to the Ghaclir Khumm observances in Shi'ism, however differently they may
be observed. The word rirj,wcin is derived from the above Quranic verb rarj,iya. The
form rirj,wrin occurs in a variety of contexts 13 times in the Qur'an (3:15, 3:162, 3:174,
5:2, 5:16, 9:21, 9:72, 9:109, 47:28, 48:29, 57:20, 57:27, 59:8) where it may always be
translated as 'the good pleasure of God'. Its Baha'i usage and reading is an excel-
lent example of the way traditional Islamic ideas and symbols are employed by
Baha'u'llah and others to simultaneously honour that tradition and to separate
from it. Seeing double.

al-zaytuna: But perhaps the single most powerful image of the tree in the Qur'an
comes at the exquisitely beautiful Light Verse:

    God is the Light of the Heavens and the Earth. The likeness of His light is as if
    there were a Niche and within it a Lamp, the Lamp enclosed in a Glass, the glass
    a.s it were a glittering star: Lit from a Blessed Tree, an olive neither eastern nor
    western, whose oil would almost shine forth by itself even though no fire touch it.
    Light upon light! God doth guide to His light whom He will. And God strikes
    metaphors for mankind. And God is Knower of all things. (Qur'an 24:35)

It is impossible to overestimate the importance of this verse in Islamic thought and
spirituality. Similarly, it would be impossible to overestimate its significance for the
Baha'i tablets. An exhaustive study of this significance would further elucidate the
relationship between the Baha'i Faith and Islam, the study of which was so strongly
             SEEil'JG DOUBLE: THE COVENAl\1T AND THE TABLET OF Al;:IMAD/Lawson                            53
             urged upon the Baha'is by Shoghi Effendi. The verse is of course the subject of a
             vastly variegated exegetic tradition. In the Shi'i tradition the oil is none other than
             the 'oil' of divine loving protection and authority (walqya) which 'shines forth even
             if no fire touches it'. In a Tradition related on the authority of ja.'fa.r al-.$adiq, the
             verse is explained as follows: The 'Niche' is said to be Fatimah, the daughter of
             Muhammad and wile of 'Ali and considered tl1e 'Mother of all the Ima.ms'. 'In it a
             La.mp, the La.mp' is said to refer to Hasan and Husa.yn. 'The glass as it were a glit-
             tering star' is said to mean tlrnt Fatimah shines like a star amongst the women of
             the world. 'Lit from a blessed Tree' is said to mean 'lit' from Abraham. 'Neither
             eastern nor western' means neither Jewish nor Christian. 'Its oil would almost shine
             forth by itself' means that divine knowledge almost flows spontaneously from it.
             'Even though no fire touched it. Light upon light' means Imam after Imam in
             unbroken succession.46 The Bab himself refers to this tree, its light, its oil, its tran-
             scendence throughout his Qa.yylim al-a.sma.47


             Rejection of Bah:i'u'llah is Rejection of All Divine Messengers

             Perhaps the most powerful and uncompromising sentence in the tablet - vvith
             regard to the fulfilment of the Covenant - is the following remarkably explicit state-
             ment:

                 Be assured in thyself that he who turnetl1 away from this Beauty hath also turned
                 away from the Messengers of the past and showeth pride towards God from all
                 eternity to all eternity.48

             Here Baha'u'llah, with consummate certainty and poise, eA']Jlicitly identifies .t11e
             Bab's ca.use with all of the divine Messengers of the past. That is, the one who turns
             away from this cause has de facto broken the Covenant instituted on the primordial
             Day of the Covenant (described above) and renewed and reiterated through every
             Prophet and Messenger from that time to this. Here Baha'u'llah without the
             slightest hint of tentativeness or apology asserts the divine and authentic origin of
             his religion. The 'Beauty' (hadha ,l-jama~ in the above excerpt ,is a simultaneous
             reference to both the Bab and Baha'u'llah. Y\Thile for Bal1a'is today this may seem
             unexceptionable or unremarkable because they have never questioned the divine
             source of the Cause, it is suggested that those living at the time of Baha'u'llah had
             many pressures to deal with, pressures that from time to time might cause them to

             ask whether or not this is the true Cause for which Muslims - and especially Shi'i

             Day of Resurrection (Yawm al-qiyama)

             It should be noted that the end of tl1e Tablet of Al;imad has remained untranslated
             in prayer books in European languages. But because this brief passage also refers
             to the Covenant we will examine it here. The reference to the Covenant is in the

     mention here of the Day of Resurrection. The Covenant taken between God and
     humanity during that time before time when all things existed only in potential
     recounted at Qur'an 7:172 was taken so that souls would be able to recognize the
     truth on the Day of Resurrection.+9 The following is a provisional translation of this
     brief coda:

         So remember Us to all those dwelling in the City of Goel, the King, the Mighty, the
         Beauteous - those who have faith in Goel and in Him ·whom God cloth raise up on
         the Day of Resurrection. Verily, they are the true sojourners upon the ways of
         Divine Truth and Reality.5°

     From the context of the tablet, it seems clear that Baha'u'llah is referring to the Bab
     as 'He Whom God raises up'. The tablet was revealed in 186551 at a time when the
     Babi community was divided and in disarray. Baha'u'llah wished to express his
     acknowledgement of the Bab's authority - his affirmation of the Bab's Covenant -
     and his recognition of him as the promised one of the Islamic dispensation. In
     recognizing this, Baha'u'llah also affirms the primordial, pre-eternal, pre-creational
     Covenant. At the saqie time, Baha'u'llah asserts His own authoritative relationship
     with the Covenant. The phrase 'those who have faith in God and in Him Whom
     God doth raise up on the Day of Resurrection' (al-ladhina hum amanu bi'llahi wa bi'l-
     ladhi yaba'thuhu allahu fi yawm al-qfyamatz) refers both to the past and the present
     because of the grammatical tenses: the verb 'to have faith' is in the perfect tense, a
     tense that indicates an action has been completed. The verb 'to raise up' is in the
     imperfect tense, a tense which indicates that an action is in process, continuous: it
     began in the past, it is certainly taking place now and it may continue in the future.
     Thus it can refer to the Bab, whom God had already 'raised up' and it can refer to
     Baha'u'llah, whom God is now 'raising up'.
          Baha'u'llah refers to the Bab earlier in this tablet in the sentence, 'And that the
     One Whom He hath sent forth by the name of 'Ali was the true One from God ...
     He is the King of the Messengers and His Book is the Mother Book (umm al-kitab)
     did ye but know ('arif£n).'5° In this passage there are three direct references to the
     Covenant: l) the phrase 'by the name of 'Ali was the true One from God' (huwa ~aqq
     min 'ind allah); 2) the phrase '1Gng of the Messengers'; 3) the phrase 'His Book is the
     Mother Book'. 'Ali is the name of the Bab, or as he was most frequently referred to
     at this stage in the history of the movement, Haclrat-i A'la (His Holiness the Most
     Exalted). But it should never be forgotten or lost sight of that the identity of Islam,
     whether Sunni or Shi'i, is formed in large measure by the dispute over the succes-
     sion to Muhammad referred to above, in which one side claims that the Prophet
     appointed no one to succeed him and another side claims that 'Ali was the true one
     from God.
          Baha'u'llah further exalts the station of 'Ali (the Bab) by calling him the 'King
     of the Messengers' (sultan al-rusu~. There are two common words in Arabic for
     'king': malik and sultan and while it might be thought that the designation sultcin
     represents a lower level of sovereignty than malik, the fact that the Tablet of AJ:imad
SEEING DOUBLE: THE COVENANT AND THE TABLET OF Al:IMill/Lawson                                  55
 opens with an invocation in the name 'the King, the All-Knowing, the \!Vise', where
 'lcing' here is also al-sultan, suggests that for Baha'u'llah the word indicates the
 highest possible level of sovereignty. The word ras'lil is interesting as it represents one
 of the few uses of traditional Islamic terminology for what is usually referred to in
 the Baha'i writings as 'divine Manifestation'. It is interesting also in this regard to
 note that Baha'u'llah is not calling the Bab a divine Messenger (ra.sUl alldh) but is
 rather calling him the King of the Messengers. Here, the King may or may not be
 of the same 'species' as his subjects. However we finally understand this epithet, it is
 certainly clear that as the King of the Messengers, the Bab :is deeply implicated in
the propagation and preservation of the divine Covenant that it is the main task of
the divine Messengers to reiterate and reestablish in their respective communities.
      The station of the Bab is perceived on an even higher plane when Baha'u'llah
deems his tablets to be not 'merely' divine revelation but to be the actual 'Mother
Book' referred to in the Qur'an at 3:7; is:39; 4S:4 and frequently associated in the
commentaries with the Preserved Tablet (law~ ma/;jU:t,) mentioned at Qur'an 8y22.
While anything approaching a complete discussion of this designation would talce
us far afield, it is perhaps sufficient here to our pmpose simply to characterize the
broadest possible consensus on the meaning of these designations in Islam. The
Mother Book or the Preserved Tablet :is the 'heavenly archetype' of all divine revel-
ation. The books of tl1e Prophets (Torah, Gospel, Qur'an) are but reflections of this
sacred and transcendent divine message. Thus, when Baha'u'llah designates the
Bab's tablets as the Mother Book, he is saying that they are qualitatively different
from the previous. scriptures in that they are paradoxically the source of these
earlier revelations rather than the result. Such a dramatic and apparently illogical
claim by Baha'u'llah about the writings of one who for all practical purposes and
to all appearances was defeated by the world bespeaks an adamantine commitment
to the Covenant of his predecessor. That this claim :is done in the very language of
the Qur'an identifies that Covenant with the Covenant of the Prophet and the
Imams.
      A number of other phrases in the Tablet of AJ:imad also stand out as signs of
tl1e Covenant:

    Thus doth the Nightingale utter His call unto you from this prison. He hath but to
    deliver this clear message. V\Thosoever desireth, let him turn aside from this counsel
    and whosoever desireth let him choose the path to his Lord.

    0 people, if ye deny these verses, by what proof have ye believed in God? Produce
    it, 0 assemblage of false ones.

    Nay, by the One :in Whose hand is my soul, tlley are not, and never shall be able to
    do tbis, even should they combine to assist one another.
56                                        THE BAHA'I FAITH AND THE WORLD'S RELIGIONS


     'Thus doth the Nightingale utter his call unto you'

     The verbal phrase 'utter His call unto you' is the translation of a single compound
     Arabic word: yudhakkarukum. This word is derived from the basic root dh-k-r which
     also gives us the word dhikr, usually translated as 'remembrance'. It has been said
     that although Islam recognizes no original sin, it does recognize that human
     beings are forgetful and need to be reminded. Such a statement is based on the
     numerous and varied uses of this word dhikr and its derivatives in the Qur'an. It
     has been suggested that the word for human being, insdn, is derived from the basic
     Arabic word nas[ya meaning precisely 'to forget' .s3 Whether or not this etymology
     is sound, the theological position of Islam and the Qur'an is unmistakable:
     mankind requires the periodic intervention of divine Messengers who come to
     remind them about their Covenant or 'contract' with God.5 4 When the
     Nightingale utters his call, he is actually reminding his listeners/readers of their
     obligations and duties. (cf. also the admonition elsewhere in the tablet to forget
     not: la tansa.)

     'The path to his Lord'

     There is probably no more pervasive metaphor in Islam than that of the path.
     Here the Arabic word is sabil (this words occurs two other times in this tablet), a
     frequent Quranic word, occurring there in the singular form l 12 times, often in
     contexts implying struggle and hardship as in 'Say not of those who are killed in
     the path of God that they are dead' (Qur'an 2:154). Other words in the Qur'an for
     or indicating path or way are: manahij (5:48), mandkib (6p5), rashada (2:186), sawd'
     (2:108,5:12) ~iratl ~irrit al-mustaqim (passim), shari'a/ shir'a (45:18, 5:48), sunna (passim),
     tariql triqa (4:168-9, 46:30; 20:63,104), yabas (20:77 'dry path in the sea'). These
     words, together with their companions 'guidance' and 'leading astray' form one of
     the central distinctive religious motifs of the Islamic religion. To be faithful to the
     Covenant means to be on the right path and vice versa. It would be impossible for
     a Muslim religious thinker to use such a word - or a Muslim audience to hear or
     read such a word - as sabil without making a conscious association with the truth
     of Islam and the Covenant it entails. Bal1a'u'llah's use of the word here is no excep-
     tion: the path of God is the same in this day as it was in the past.SS
         The challenge to those who deny the verses to produce a proof of their belief
     in God and the assurance that they will fail in this is a variation on the Quranic
     theme of ta~zarj,rj,i or 'challenge', in which the enemies of the Prophet are challenged
     to produce a book or verses comparable to the Qur'an. That they cannot do so is
     understood in the context as a proof of the divine source of Muhammad's revela-
     tion. At Qur'an qgo, for example, we find the following:

         Say: If the whole of mankind and Jinn were to gather together to produce the like
         of this Qur'an, they could not produce the like thereof, even if they backed up each
         other with help and support (law kana ba't;f,uhum li-ba't;f,in ?:,ahiran; cf Baha'u'llah's law
        SEEING DOUBLE: THE COVENANT AND THE TABLET OF Af::lMAD/Lawson                                  57
           yalcunu ba'fl.uhum li-ba'¢in ?:,ahiran - even should they combine to assist one another -
            in the Tablet of Al:imad).

            Say: Then bring ye a book from God which is a better guide than either of them
            that I may follow it if ye are truthful. (Qur'an 28:49; cf. also Qur'an 2:23-4)


        Signs
        The motif of signs and verses is also an important feature of the Islamic dispensa-
        tion. The Arabic word 4;J1a 'sign' (pl. 4;J1dt) means both portent and verse of divine
        revelation, verses of poetry being referred to as bqytl ab)Jdt to differentiate scripture
        from other forms of literature. The Qur'an is very specific about the nature and
        function of these qydt whether they are in the form of divinely revealed language
        ('verses') or are in the form of created phenomena, when read correctly they indi-
        cate God and God's Covenant with humanity. A few Quranic quotations '\Nill
        illustrate this. The first is perhaps the most widely cited verse in this connection.
        The Bab's writings are full of references to it and Baha'u'llah either quotes it
        directly or refers to it many times as well.

            Soon will We show them Our Signs in the horizons and in their own souls until it
            becomes manifest to them that this is the Truth. Is it not enough that thy Lord is
            witness over all created things? (Qur'an 41:53)

        The Qpr'an may be understood to say that in addition to the miraculous verses of
        scriptureS 6 which are portents or signs of God, such signs are also deposited in
        nature and in the soul. Thus the reading of signs is to be done on three levels or in
        three contexts: nature, self/ soul and revelation. The implication is that such a triple
        reading will strive to perceive the harmony obtaining throughout these various
        realms. The implication hen: is also that the primary station of the human being is
        that of reader of the world. In this act of reading, it is expected that one views the
        sign as in1portant in that it indicates something beyond itself, so the reading act
        entails 'seeing double'. One must pay close attention to the given sign, which may
        be in nature, in the soul or in the Book. At the very same time, one's vision must be
        drawn towards the beyond-the-sign (God) in order for the reading to be accurate.57
        One may read the famous Quranic verse, said to have been revealed on the occa-
        sion of the change in the direction of prayer (qiblah), as corroborating this point.

            To God belong the East and the West; whithersoever you turn, there is the Face of
            God; God is AIJ-embracing, AIJ-knowing. (Qur'an 2:rr5)

        Here it is important to note that the Arabic word wajh (Face) also can mean direc-
        tion. It has also been translated in this context as 'Presence'. \!\Then understood this
        way, and especially in connection with another important verse:



  ,,.
  '
 f'
_L;;;
                                  THE BAHA'I FAITH AND THE WORLD'S RELIGIONS

    Supplicate no other god save God. There is no god but He. Everything that exists
    is perishing except His Face. (Qur'an 28:88)

the Qur'an says that the way to God is eternal while the various phenomena that
indicate Him are in a process of change. His eternity is             in the very pres-
ence of evanescence. Thus we have another             of        double and one that
is very common to our modes of                 A thing is known by its opposite: heat
through cold, left through     and so on ..58 Perceiving heat entails also perceiving,
or at least remembering the perception of; cold.

           the Qur'an reiterates its 'theory' of signs:

     On the earth are Signs for those of assured faith.
    As also in your own souls, will ye not then perceive?
    •.<\nd in heaven is your sustenance, as also that which ye are promised.
    Then, by the Lord of heaven and earth, this is the very Truth as much as the
    that ye can speak intelligently to each other. (Qur'an 51:20-3)

A final lengthier quotation is included because it            a powerfol example of
the relational and self-referential dynamics of reading. Here the Qur'an, repre-
senting a distinct category of signs, uses          to illuminate the signs of nature
and the soul. The lesson seems to be that the triple reading of phenomena, self and
Book must be coordinated first of all by reference to the Book.

   It is God Who causeth the seed-grain and the date-stone to split and sprout. He
   causeth the living to issue from the dead and He is the One to cause the dead to
   issue from the living. That is God. Then how are ye deluded away from the
   Truth?
        He it is that cleaveth the day-breal: (from the dark): He makes           for rest
   and tranquillity, and the sun and moon for the reckoning (of              Such is i:he
   judgement and ordering of (Him) the Exalted in Power, the Omniscient.
        It is He who maketh the stars as           for you, that you may guide yourselves
   with their help through the dark spaces of land and sea: We detail Our Signs for
   people who know.
        It is He Who hath produced you from a single soul. Here is a place of abiding

   pomegranates. Each similar in kind yet di1ferent in variety. When they begin to
   bear fruit feast your eyes with the fruit and the ripeness thereof. Behold! In these
   things are Signs for people who believe. (Qur'an 6:95-9)
SEEING DOUBLE: THE COVENANT AND THE TABLET OF AJ:l!.'V1AD/Lawson                              59

The Covenant is established through revelation (verses/ signs) and that which the
signs indicate is none other than the divine and the Covenant implied thereby - the
hermeneutic circle, if you please. Tlu·oughout the Tablet of Al)rnad are numerous
such references and hints to the Covenant of Islam instituted by Muhammad and
guarded and protected by His progeny, the Imams. We have only discussed a few of
the more obvious ones. The important point here is that these clues and hints are
to be read in two registers at once: the Islamic and the Baha'i, a historical or 'hori-
zontal' reading. Each 'sign' as we have stated repeatedly is also to be read doubly in
a second direction: 'gothicly' or vertically as metaphor. Metaphor is not merely a
verbal or rhetorical device but a strategy through which divine Truth is made
known in the 'sub-lunar' realrn.59 In the mystical tradition, metaphorical love (<ishq
mojdz~ is precisely the love b.etween human beings; real love (<ishq (zaqiqi) is the love
of God and God's love for humanity. Human love is a bridge (mojd.z) to the real goal
of divine love. Of course these signs and verses may be read in only one register,
with one eye, as it were. However, if this is done then the message of Baha'u'llah is
either distorted or negated altogether. The 'Islamic Antichrist' - al-Dajjal - was
described in the Hadith by the Prophet Muhammad, which is quoted at the head
of this paper, as having only one eye. This indicates that evil is implicated (either
the cause of or caused) by a refusal or inability to see clearly with two eyes - to see
double. In the following provisional translation of the Surat al-shams, Baha'u'llah
is quite unambiguous about how to read:

    Know ye that he who clings to the outer meaning and abandons the inner meaning
    is an ignorant savage and he who clings to the inner meaning and abandons the
    outer meaning is a negligent one. But he who takes the inner meaning in harmony
    with the outer meaning, that one has perfect awareness. 60

'A service in both worlds' (al-thaqalayn)

Another reference to the Covenant is the phrase 'service in both worlds'. The Arabic
is <ibddat al-thaqalayn. The first word here is derived from the same word as <abd,
servant/slave, as in 'A.bdu'l-Baha, 'Servant of Baha'. In this form in the Tablet of
AlJ.mad it is an abstract noun: servitude/service. Thus, Shoghi Effendi's choice in
translation of this first word is quite straightforward. His choice in translating the
second word, thaqala;yn, as 'both worlds' is not quite so transparent and invites serious
study and meditation. Interestingly enough for the present discussion, the word
thaqala;yn is in the dual number. 61 The singular noun tlzaqal means 'burden, load,
baggage'. Cast in the dual form it simply means two of these. (The plural, itlzqril,
refers to three or more. The word mithqdl is derived from this root and means a
weight for measuring- for example, a quantity of gold or silver.) T11e word tlwqalo;yn
does appear once in the Qur'an 62 in the Sura of the Merciful (suratu r-ra(iman):

    Soon shall We settle your affairs, 0 both ye worlds (C!J!)'Uha 'th-t!zaqa!fmi)! (Qur'an
    55:31, Yusuf Ali translation)
60                                    THE BAfiA'f FAITH AND THE WORLD'S RELIGIONS

     This sura is distinguished by its rhyme, predominantly in -an, which also happens
     to be the grammatical suffix indicating the dual number. Thus the word tlzaqalan fits
     perfectly into this rhyme scheme. It is also distinguished by the frequent refrain:
     'Which of the favours of your Lord will ye deny?' The sura has a highly incanta-
     tory form and its contents are very poetic, musical and mystical. It is thought to be
     one of the early Ivieccan suras. As Yusuf Ali so astutely observes:

         Here the special theme is indicated by the refrain. The rhyme in most cases is in
         the Dual grammatical form, and the Argument implies that though things are
         created in pairs, there is an underlying Unity, through the Creator, in the favours
         which He bestows, and in the goal to which they are marching. 63

     Nonetheless, the precise meaning of thaqalan is far from clear. 6'' The most frequent
     explanation is that it refers to the two burdensome groups: mankind and jinn. As
     we see in Yusuf Ali's translation, the two groups are taken as symbolic of two
     worlds: one visible, the other invisible. However, the world of jinn, as understood
     by Muhammad's audience, would not have been a paradise, rather it was an inter-
     realm where both the virtuous and the mischievous and even malevolent beings
     known as jinn pursued their separate destinies. There is no evidence that the world
     of jinn, just because it was invisible to humans, was therefore also the hereafter or
     paradise (or in Baha'i terms, the Abha Ki.ngdom). Such an idea would be unthink-
     able. However, when Yusuf Ali translates al-thaqalayn as 'both worlds' he is counting
     on his reader being familiar with the immediate context which mentions specifically
     men and jinn several times (Qur' an 55: 14, 15, 33, 39, 56, 74) so that there can be no
     doubt about what is intended by Yusuf Ali's 'both worlds'. A short excerpt from this
     sura, indicating the presence of the controlling rhyme -an mentioned above, will
     further illuminate the matter:

         26 All that is on earth will perish ifdn)
         27 But will abide (forever) the face of thy Lord - full of majesty, Bounty and
             Honour (al-ikram)
         28 Then which of the favours of your Lord will ye deny? (tukadlzdhibmz)
         29 Of Him seeks (its need) every creature in the heavens and on earth: every day
             in (new) splendour doth He (shine)! (slza,n)
         30 Then which of the favours of your Lord will ye deny? (tukadhdhibdn)
         31 Soon shall We settle your affairs 0 both ye worlds! (al-thaqalan)
         32 Then which of the favours of your Lord will ye deny? (tukadhdlzibdn)
         33 0 ye assembly of Jinns and men! If it be ye can pass beyond the zones of the
             heavens and the earth, pass ye! Not without authority will ye be able to pass!
             (sultan)
         34 Then which of the favours of your Lord will ye deny? (tukadhdhibdn)

     Yusuf Ali's note to this verse is worth quoting:
          SEEING DOUBLE: THE COVENANT AND THE TABLET OF AI;Ll\1AD/Lawson                                6r

              Thaqal: weight, something weight)~ something weighed with something else. The two
              thaqalas are {the two worlds of} Jinns and men, {the unseen world and the world
              before our eyes} *who are burdened with responsibilit)' or, as some commentators
              hold, with sin.* They are both before {God}*Allal1*, and the affairs of both are
              conducted under His Command. If there are inequalities or apparent disturbances
              of balance, that is only for a season. {God} *Allah* gives to both good and evil men
              a chance in this period of probation; but this period will soon be over, andjudgement
              will be established. To give you this chance, this probation, this warning, is itself a
              favom~ by which you should profit, and for which you should be grateful. (R) 55

          Another important occurrence of the dual of thaqal is in the Sermon of Ghadir
          Khumm quoted above. For convenience, I ·will cite the relevant passage here. Note
          that the word appears in a clifferent grammatical case. in this instance, giving a
          slightly different pronunciation.

              [JY'.Iuhammad] gave the communit)' news of his own death, saying: 'I have been
              summoned and it is nearly the moment for me to answer. The time has come for
              me to depart from you. I leave behind me among you two all-important things (al-
              tlw.qalayn) which, if you cleave to t11em, you will never go astray - that is the Book
              of God and my offspring from my family (ahl al-bqyt). They will never abandon you
              until tl1ey lead you to me at tl1e (sacred) waters (of Heaven).''"'

          The relevance this passage has for a study of the Covenant is obvious. Al-thaqalqyn
          refers to the two things most valuable for maintaining faithfulness to the Covenant:
          the Qur'an and the progeny of the Prophet who have been designated as the
          successive Guardians (awlb1d, sing. wali) of the Cause of God and the Covenant. 67
          These two things, moreover, are stipulated as 'bequests' in this Tradition, as
          Muhammad's own Covenant or testament ('ahd), since, according to the Shi'a,
          Muhammad was prevented from committing His ·will and testament to paper by
          the covenant-breakers. It is interesting to observe here that an alternate translation
          for thaqal is 'army'. 68 Thus it may be possible to understand Muhammad's words in
          the ~adith al-thaqalayn as designating the Qur'an and the Imams as two armies
          protecting the community from the various enemies of covenant-breaking and
          dissension. Such armies would also aid the believers in their task of establishing the
          widest possible area for t11e practice of Islam, known technically as the Abode of
          Islam (ddr al-isldm), and also as the Abode of the Covenant (ddr al- 'aluf;. 69
               The Shi'i Qur'an commentaries consulted for this article all equate the word
          thaqaldn of the Qur'an verse 55:31 with 'tl1e two precious things' mentioned in the
          prophetic Hadith, although Mul1sii1 Fayc;l Kashani adds his opinion that the word
          refers to the world of jinn and men. v\Thether this means that it also refers to these
          'two worlds' is not raised. 7° That Baha'u'll:ih himself affirmed the significance of
          the Hadith al-thaqalayn is clear from his quoting it in the K.itab-i-Iqan. Here Shoghi
          Effendi has translated thaqalqyn as 'twin weighty testimonies' in line with the usual
          Shi'i understanding of this dual noun.71

    The nominative dual usage in sura 55:31 is of special interest because of the
great discrepancy between the interpretations of this verse throughout Islamic
history and the related phrase in the Tablet of A.Qmad which the Guardian has
translated as 'a service in both worlds'. Grammatically, Baha'u'llah's 'ibadat al-
thaqalayn might also be translated as 'a service to both worlds' or 'authorities' - the
Book and the teacher/Imam - since the preposition 'in' (fi) does not occur here.
Thus the meaning might also be: For the one who chants this Tablet, God will give
the reward of a hundred martyrs and the rank of having served faithfully both of
the 'two precious things'. That is, the one who sincerely believes that which is stated
in the Tablet of AJ:imad has be.en true to the Qur'an, to the Prophet and to the
Imams - to the 'Islamic' Covenant, even if it appears otherwise.
    The purpose in drawing attention to this translation question is to highlight
another aspect of the relationship between the Baha'i Faith and Islam. Shoghi
Effendi's enrichment of a standard symbol of the Islamic Covenant, by departing
from the traditional understanding of a single word, is characteristic of the way in
which the Baha'i Faith has become distinct and has acquired an identity which may           I

Over 25 years ago John Hatcher published an essay in which he discussed basic
Baha'i presuppositions about what it means to be in the world.7 2 From what has
been said about the theory of signs above, that this essay is 'apparently' about the
nature of reading will be quite understandable since we have seen how the act of
                                                                                            i

                                                                                            l

reading signs has immediate existential implications.73 Essential here is what might        lI
otherwise be thought a mere literary figure, the metaphorical process. However,
Hatcher demonstrated in his article the profound connections between being, spir-           iI
itual grmvth and reading that are assumed in the Baha'i teachings. In order to make
his point as clear as possible, he painstakingly described the structure of metaphor,
which entails three elements: r) 'the tenor, that which is being described'; 2) 'the
vehicle, that which is compared to the tenor; and 3) the meaning, that area of similarity
between the tenor and the vehicle.' 74 So, in the famous simile 'l\1y love is lilce a red
red rose', the tenor is 'My love', the vehicle is the 'reel red rose' and the meaning is
what occurs in the mind when tl1e comparison is struck. It may be added here that
for all practical purposes the tenor in the metaphorical process is like the 'x' in an
algebraic equation, waiting to be cliscovered through the process. In other words, it
is unknown and to a large extent unseen, unimagined and unthought until the
metaphor is generated. Unlike the algebraic 'x', however, the value that is discovered
through the metaphorical process is not quantifiable. The metaphorical 'equation'
yields a field of meaning rather than an integer. The tenor, then, is seen and known
in the way the author of the metaphor wishes us to know and see it in such a field
of meaning. In his remarkable article, Hatcher explicates in masterful and engaging
fashion how the Baha'i tablets insist that the author of creation, Goel, wishes this
handiwork to be perceived in and through the metaphorical process.
SEEING DOUBLE: THE COVENANT AND THE TABLET OF AJ:lMAD/Lawson

    The reader or listener must be made to think, to be a bit creative, because he must
    complete the final and most important part of the process himself. He is responsible
    for determining in what way the tenor and the vehicle are similar.75

This basic proposition about the perception and reading of existence and reality is
'a safeguard against dogmatism'7 6 precisely because a metaphor, by its very nature,
is a living and changing entity owing to its utter dependence for its life on the active,
creative imagination of the human mind. Just as each mind is different, so each
mind imagines in a distinctive fashion. 'My point is not to assign one translation to
this metaphorical event ... to affix one meaning violates the very nature of the
metaphor . . . '77 Furthermore, this individual reading act has profound (and it
would seem irreversible) implications for society. It is not solely a private act, no
matter how metaphorical:

    The point is that there is no final or complete perception of the abstraction; it can
    always be more acutely perceived or more exquisitely dramatized in the
    phenomenal world. Of course, the idea of limitless growth is not confined to the
    individual. Society itself can manifest a collective awareness of authority, justice,
    honesty, and as its awareness of these attributes expands, society is capable of
    implementing that understanding more completely in social acti.on.7 8

    The physical metaphor ... functions on this plane as an integral and inextricable
    part of man's efforts to fulfil his prin1ary goal, spiritual development. It provides the
    means by which he perceives spiritual qualities in the first place and it is the means
    by which he may express and acquire that attribute once it is understood. Even as
    tl1e process of spiritual growth attains higher levels of response, man never
    completely relinquishes on t11is plane the reciprocal relationship between the
    conception of spirituality and tl1e implementation through metaphorical act.79

The somce of this 'theory of reading' - which is really a theory of being - Hatcher
locates in none other than 'Abdu'l-Bal1a's Some Answered Questions:

   ... human knowledge is of two kinds. One is tl1e knowledge of things perceptible
   to the senses ... The other kind of knowledge is intellectual - that is to say, it is a
   reality of the intellect; it has no outward form and no place, and is not perceptible
   to the senses ... Therefore to explain the reality of the spirit, its condition, its
   station - one is obliged to give explanations under the forms of sensible t11ings,
   because in the sensible world all that exists is sensible. For example, grief and
   happiness are intellectual things; when you wish to express those spiritual qualities
   yoi.1 say: 'My heart is oppressed; [oi~ my heart is dilated', though the heart ofrhan
   is neither oppressed nor dilated. This is an intellectual or spiritual state, to explain
   which you are obliged to have recourse to sensible figures. Anotl1er example: you
   say, 'such an individual made great progress', tl10ugh he is remaining in the same
   place; or again, 'such a one's position was exalted', altl10ugh like everyone else, he
                                  TRE   BAHA'I FAITH AND THE WORLD'S RELIGIONS

    walks upon the earth. This exaltation and this progress are spiritual states and
    intellectual realities, but to explain them you are obliged to have recourse to
    sensible figures because in the exterior world there is nothing that is not sensible.
         So the symbol of knowledge is light, and of ignorance, darkness; but reflect, is
    lmowledge sensible light, or ignorance sensible darkness? No, they are merely
    symbols. 80

It is the 'metaphorical act' or event that has been the proper topic of this paper, the
place where seeing double, or the double vision, occurs because in order for the
metaphor to be 'enacted' or initiated (and in some sense to be embodied) the
subject must be looking at two things at once, or almost at once - a difficult but
quintessentially human accomplishment. 81
     The Muslim mystical tradition, out of which the Baha'i Faith is seen to have been
born, has long recognized this as an axiom of epistemology in the veneration of such
Holy Traditions as: 'The Paths to God are as numerous as the souls of the believers.'
Thus each reader /believer will engage vv:ith the text in a very personal and intimate
way. ·when the double vision is in play, a certain degree of confusion or amphiboly
can occur. This means that the tenor and the vehicle become 'confused'. 82
Amphiboly, as Corbin explained, is a cardinal axiom of the mystical and poetic tracli-
tion; as such, it is relevant to the Baha'i corpus. It may be understood through the
example he gives. Hafiz, whom many consider the greatest Persian mystic poet, has
generated much controversy over the problem of interpreting his vvine poetry liter-
ally or figuratively. The question, as Corbin points out, is badly conceived, since it is
a matter of the otherwise transcendent (or as :i\bdu'l-Baha preferred, 'spiritual or
intellectual' truth) having been clothed so that it might be visible, accessible. And in
this, the clothing also acquires something of the Truth. But the 'clothing' - not only
the Truth itself - is also prone to being misunderstood and confused and confusing. 83


Amphibo!;)I

    This is that which hath descended from the realm of glory, uttered by the tongue of
    power and might, and revealed unto the Prophets of old. We have taken the inner
    essence thereof and clothed it in the garment of brevity, as a token of grace unto
    the righteous, that they may stand faithful unto the Covenant of God, may fulfil in
    their lives His trust, and in the realm of spirit obtain the gem of Divine virtue. 8+

In this well-lmuwn introduction to his Hidden Words Baha'u'llah employs the
metaphor of clothing to illumine the status, function and purpose of this brief
work. ·whether or not there is any direct connection or relationship, it will help
explicate further the theme of seeing double by referring to a similar metaphor
used by the famous and influential r3th-century Iranian mystic Ruzbihan Baqli
Shirazi (seep. 48) in his attempts to elucidate the method by which the Unlmowable
becomes lmown. In fact, Ruzbil1an uses exactly the same metaphor of clothing, but
whereas Baha'u'llah uses a word based on the root q-m-~, in this case the metaphor
       SEEING DOUBLE: THE COVENAJ\!T AND THE TABLET OF Af:IMAD/Lawson

       is based on the root l-b-s and the operative word is iltibtis 'disguised' or 'veiled';
       divine Truth is 'disguised' in phenomenal 'signs'. 85 In elucidating this metaphor, the
       renowned scholar of Islamic mysticism Annemarie Schimmel has written;

           Rtizbihan becomes enraptured when he speaks of his own experiences, of his
           suffering, his yearning for beauty The iltibtis, the concealment of preeternal beauty
           in created forms, is the theme of his meditations; faithful to the classical Sufi
           tradition, he sees in love the effort to break once more through the limits of the
           created world in order to reach 1he state of true [Div:ine Unity] as it existed at the
           [primordial] Day of the Covenant. 86

       The scholar responsible for insisting on the importance of Ruzbihan for an under-
       standing of Islamic mysticism was the above-mentioned Henry Corbin. 87 Corbin
       uses the word amphiboly to translate iltibtis and it is felt that this choice is admirably
       suited to its purpose. 88 Amphiboly occurs in logic, for example, when a statement
       becomes susceptible of two meanings, not because of the double meaning of the
       words used, but because of the construction of the sentence. For example: 'The
       killing of the lions was swift and merciful.' Thus, logical amphiboly depends nm on
       the double meanings of elements in the statement (ambiguity) but on the structure
       of the statement itself. Similarly, creation is susceptible of two 'meanings' because
       of the very structure of Being or Existence. This structure is related to the Hadith
       Qudsi: 'I desired to be kno-wn, therefore I created creation in order to be known
       and I was known.' 89 The meaning of this statement for Ruzbihan is that the mate-
       rial world is essential as a means of knowing Truth or God or Absolute Being and
       as a means for humanity to know 1he Truth. This is much different from saying that
       creation and God are the same. Such a confusion is quite understandable given the
       amphibolous nature of the cosmos.9° Indeed, one of the connotations of the word
       iltibtis is precisely 'confusion'. God created the phenomenal world in order that He
       be lmown but His transcendence is such that He can never be truly lmown. His
       attributes, His energy, if you will, can be detected through the 'residue' of His
       creative aCL, that is to say 'all created things'. That this is so elevates immeasurably
       mere material phenomena to a status otherwise unanticipated. Each created thing

I      becomes a vehicle for the knowledge of God, an 'embodiment' of divine virtue.
       Baha'u'llah himself says exactly the same thing in The Book of Certitude:

           ... the light of divine knowledge and heavenly grace hath illumined and inspired
           the essence of all created things, in such wise that in eacl1 and every thing a door
I          of lmowledge hatl1 been opened, and within every atom traces of the sun hath been

l
J      Prior to using, say, a tree to stand for proxnrnty to God, the Covenant and
i.     Guardianship,9 2 the tree is merely a tree. By using the tree to stand for some aspect
l      of t11e divine, the revelation transforms (or transposes) nature from its worldly,
'
i :.   mundane register. Through the process of divine manifestation (tajalli, pJzur), which
66                                     THE BAHA'I FAITH AND THE WORLD'S RELIGIONS

     paracloxicalJy depends upon the material realm and the human sensorium, 93 this
     material realm is transmuted by association, as if the divine energy charging
     through it actually transfigures it. The tree, by virtue of its participation in the
     Unknown, the Divine Hiddenness, the Invisible realm, the Holy Silence, becomes
     charged with the electricity of this Other Realm. And so the phenomenal world is
     spiritualized (which may be thought to be different from divinized) in the soul or the
     imagination of the observer, reader, believer. Nature read in this manner becomes
     impossible to participate in without being brought into contact - however tenta-
     tively - with holiness, sacredness, divinity. As one scholar explains, the phenomenal
     realm - in the spiritualized consciousness - becomes transparent and the divine
     light now is perceived as shining through all created things. 94 But this light needs to
     be seen by humans ('God desired to be known'). By human perception being
     'drawn through' nature during the metaphorical process, nature is also humanized.
     The world becomes a Holy Land by being humanized.95
         Divine love requires a human reality; Divine Unity requires a divine reality.
     This situation gives rise to possible confusion, a misreading of the world which sees
     either nothing beyond matter or the essence of God in the material realm (a
     frequent misinterpretation of mysticism). 96 The double vision sees matter qua
     matter, an invaluable and indispensable vehicle for the truth and detects also the
     transcendent Truth that actually enlivens matter. The experience of ultimate
     Meaning or Truth must also be referred to through S)'Tilbols and images precisely
     because its abstract reality is incommunicable and inaccessible. Ruzbihan
     frequently referred to this inner Reality as the betrothed or bride; in such a
     metaphor, the intensity of the experience of the perception of Meaning is likened
     to the intensity of the experience of physical love in marriage.97 It would seem that
     Baha'u'llah himself is speaking out of this tradition in those places in the Kitab-i-
     iqan where he refers to the 'brides of inner meaning' .98 In Arabic the idea of
     esoteric meaning is also etymologically associated with the feminine since the word
     bdpn, 'inner meaning, esoteric dimension', is derived from the word for womb (batn).
     Indeed, one may see the presence of this tradition of associating the feminine witl1
     true meaning in the several works devoted by Baha'u'llah to the 'Maid of Heaven'
     who, it will be recalled, was the agent of his revelation in the first place.99 Thus
     Baha'u'llah's encounter with the 'lviaid of Heaven' may be intended to be under-
     stood as an encounter with Absolute Meaning, or the lilce. 100
          The Manifestations of God (that is to say, Prophets and Messengers and
     perhaps Guardians, awliyrJ,1°') are the guides to this way of reading/ seeing.
     Ruzbihan says that it is through these beings, 'ignored by the mass of humanity',
     that God sees the world and that they are the eyes by which creation beholds
     God. ~ They are ignored because that which acts as the place of manifestation, the
          10



     particular phenomenon, can also act as a veil (multabis). Indeed, one of the more
     remarkable qualities of a veil is that it reveals and conceals simultaneously: by its
     very presence it indicates a reality that is being hidden. Siyyid Kazim Rashti, in a
     passage very much in line with the teachings of Baha'u'llah as found in the Smat
     al-shams mentioned above, refers to a similar way of seeing in discussing the
SEEING DOUBLE: THE COVEN.Al\1T A1'H:l THE TABLET OF Al:HvfAD/Lawson


process of manifestation and its veiling. He says that some people are manifesta-
tions of divine unity, others are manifestations of prophethood and others are
manifestations of guardianship in the realm of nature. But all are manifestations of
both their specific stations and the whole 'process' siroultaneousl)' Taking as his
authority a series of Quranic verses and the famous Hadith in which Muhammad
said, 'I am the City (or House) of knowledge and 'Ali is its gate', he further elabo-
rates this idea:

    And Our command (amrwui) is but one (wa~idatun) [Qur'an 54:50] ... ; Thou can
    see no disharmony in the creation of the Merciful [Qur'an 67:3] .. ; If it had been
    from any other than God they would have therein much disharmony [Qur'an 4:72].
        So he who recognizes only one aspect is one-eyed and he who recognizes [only]
    two aspects in one is cross-eyed. But he who recognizes them all in one aspect, and
    not in three, is a true seer (ba.tirun klnnilun) ... Know that the gates of the gate and
    the a.<.pects of the threshold are all one, when you consider what is inside the House
    or the City. But if the sight is turned only to the gates (ilti nefs al-abwab), then the
    access [to the House] will disappear and the way will become blocked. 103


'The Nightingale of Paradise singeth upon the twigs of the Tree of
Eternity'

Such a beautiful image can also indicate, in addition to the time-bound Covenants
of the Bab and Baha'u'llah, the timeless Covenant of the marriage of Meaning
with creation, indicated in the Quranic verse discussed at the beginning of this
article. As the Bab says in the Qayytim al-asma, echoing this Quranic language:

    Verily We have taken a covenant from every created thing upon its coming into
    being concerning the Remembrance of God, and there shall be none to avert the
    binding command of God for the purification of mankind ... '°4

Thus time and eternity are gathered together in the individual sign or verse: seeing
double. This seeing double is constantly reinforced in our experience of duality in
the world. \Nhetl1er in tl1e thought of Heraclitus or the moving lament on tl1e binary
nature of human perception in the Phrlj!do, it has long been acknowledged that our
tendency to perceive polarities in our experience is one of tl1e chief distinguishing
features of thought and perception. 105 By virtue of our experience of duality and
opposition (unity/multiplicity; whole/partial; inner/outer; past/ present; up/down;
hot/ cold; present/ absent; black/white; friend/ enemy; good/bad, fait11/reason and
so on) we are conditioned to instinctively posit tl1e 'other half' or 'otl1er side' of each
phenomenon we encounter. Indeed, the word 'syrribol' stems from the Greek wOrd
S)imbolon, 'that broken object, the two halves of which bear witness, for tl1ose holding
t11em, to old bonds between t11emselves or their families; but it also signifies sign,
contract, a signification that is undecipherable without its counterpart' .105 In a sense, tl1e
world itself is that broken object. Its other half is tl1e trnnscendent realm.
     68                                     THE BAHA'I FAITH Al\T]) THE WORLD'S RELIGIONS

               Such duality is another feature of seeing double because the basic binary
          mode of perception is constantly reinforced by our experience of the myriad dual-
          ities of existence. The reader 'sees double' when reading but habitually does not
          register this all-important perspective or approach at the conscious level. By
          discussing it here, I wish to draw out the workings of the reading act to the realm
          of awareness, not in order to 'explain away' the inherent power of the act but to
          permit us to be more mindful and therefore to participate more fully in the act, to
          understand reading as an experience akin to what the Christ~an traditionro 7 calls a
          sacrament.
               'Seeing double', a term frequently used to describe someone who has become
          intoxicated, is a perfect term in this context, although the intoxication or inebria-
          tion is of a special kind. Baha'is are familiar with the various instances of wine
          imagery throughout the Baha'i scriptures (another legacy of the Islamicate literary
          tradition). Indeed, the innumerable uses of the symbol by Baha'u'llah calls out for
          a separate study. 108 One example will suffice here. In his biographical eulogy of
          Ustad Isma'il, '.Abdu'l-Baha cites the ode of Rumi that Baha'u'llah had written
          down specifically for this early staunch believer, an ode he further instructed Ustad
          Isma'il to chant while facing towards the Bab. The first two stanzas are:

·1            I am lost, 0 Love, possessed and dazed,
              Love's fool am I, in all tl1e earth.
              They call me first among the crazed,
              Though I once came first for wit and worth.

              0 Love, who sellest me this wine,
              0 Love, for whom I burn and bleed,                                                      f
              Love, for whom I cry and pine -                                                         l
                                                                                                      \
              Thou the Piper, I the reed. rog
                                                                                                      I.

          The paradox (seeing double) here is that this intoxication enables one to see things
          as they are, rather than in the distorted way associated with 'physical' drunkenness.
                                                                                                      II
          The motto here would then be 'In truth, wine', rather than the traditional, 'In win.e,      I
          truth' (in vino veritas). ParadoxicaJ.lY, also, such duality and amphiboly produce certi-
          tude so that duality somehow becomes the antithesis of ambiguity in the sense of
                                                                                                      l!
          indeterminacy and vagueness. By searching for the 'brides of inner significance' the
          reader declares belief in a Covenant that guarantees meaning and purpose in the
          world, a reason for our suffering and a promise for the future, a future which is, at
          the same time, the bride of inner meaning. " 0

          Conclusion

              It is evident unto thee that the Birds of Heaven and Doves of Eternity speak a
              twofold language. One language, the outward language, is devoid of allusions, is
              unconcealed and unveiled; that it may be a guiding lamp and a beaconing light
    SEEING DOUBLE: THE COVENANT AND THE TAllLET OF Al:lMAD/Lawson                              69

        whereby wayfarers may attain the heights of holiness, and seekers may advance
        into the realm of eternal reunion. Such are the unveiled traditions and the evident
        verses already mentioned. The other language is veiled and concealed, so that
        whatever lieth hidden in the heart of the malevolent may be made manifest and
        their innermost being be disclosed. 111

    It is important to close with a word of apology: this a11icle - despite false appear-
    ances to the contrary - is not written to 'expose' the profound 'Islamicness' of the
    Baha'i Faith. Such an exercise would in any case be too redundant to waste tnne
    and effort on. Rather, it is written to open up to those who might not have access
    to the necessary sources the deep connection between the tvw religions and to
    establish this relationship as one among many in what must remain the continuing
    and perhaps endless attempt to mine the Baha'i scriptures for all of their possible
    implications. This Islamic substrate need not be privileged at the e}q)ense of all
    other possible hermeneutic presuppositions but it must be acknowledged and taken
    into account in any serious attempt that strives for anything approaching a 1:hor-
    ough reading of the Baha'i scriptures. " 2
         The Baha'i Faith has, despite its Islamic provenance and background, acquired
    a distinct identity through a number of processes and stands today therefore as a
    so-called independent world religion, although the terms distinct and discrete may
    be preferred by some. It may be queried then why it is necessary or even advisable
    to spend so much effort in identifying the Quranic and Hadith content of the vvrit-
    ings of the founders of the Faith since presumably one of the most important
    implications of the Baha'i message is that the Islamic dispensation has now been
    replaced by a new one. Even if we did not have all of the exhortations from or on
    behalf of Shoghi Effendi repeatedly urging Baha'is to become knowledgeable
    about Islam, we might be encouraged in such a project by the results of recent
    developments in the study of literature in general. Specifically, studies of the influ-
    ence of the Bible on the western literary tradition have opened up new vistas for
    the assessment of the relationship between religion and culture. "3 The proposition
    is that the Bible is responsible for the terms of reference, the structure of thought
    and the vocabulary of much of western civilization. If such discoveries are valid,
    then not only do their results have implications for the perhaps strictly academic
    problem of the formation of a literary tradition, but since a literary tradition is also
    both a source and result of moral and ei:hical spiritual values and a guide to the
    specific consciousness and conscience or 'soul' of a society, these discoveries provide
    concrete evidence for the influence on society of what Baha'is call revelation.
    Similar work on the influence of the Qur'an on the Islamic tradition has not been
    done and is badly needed."4 Even though scholars have spoken of such things as
    die 'quranizaticiri of forisciciusriess' and have reeognized - in"deed how could one
    not -. the unprecedented degree to which the book has influenced history and
    culture, there has been no Northrop Frye in Q.lranic studies, as yet, to demonstrate
    this influence in terms compatible with western post-enlightenment scholarly
    tastes. 11 5 But the kinds of insights Frye offers about the relationship between the

     Bible and 'western' culture are very suggestive for the study of the Qur'an and
     Islamic culture. rrG This insistence upon reading the inner with the outer has a long
     and venerable tradition in Islamic culture and may be regarded as one of the most
     precious aspects of the Islamicate legacy to the world, a legacy enshrined,
     preserved and universalized by the Baha'i teachings." 7 The Baha'i Faith is a bearer
     of this Quranic and Islamic influence to a much larger audience than that one
     defined by the traditional boundaries of the 'Muslim world' - the traditional
     Abode of the Covenant. rra In the process, the Baha'i Faith has also distinguished
     itself from Islam more so than any other similar contemporary Islamicate devel-
     opment. The remarkable and distinctive 'post-Islamic' features of the Baha'i Faith
     - by virtue of their number and nature - merit a separate study. It is thought,
     however, that by focusing upon the similarities and the profound genetic relation-
     ship between Islam and the Baha'i Faith we will be in a better position to recognize
     those features when we see them. It is, in any case, quite understandable how the
     Baha'i Faith and Islam enjoy a kind of amphibolous relationship and what is
     meant in the Hadith when the Prophet Muhammad declared that 'Dajjal is one-
     eyed whereas God is not'.

   2. 'These daily obligatory prayers, together with a few other specific ones, such as
      the Healing Prayer, the Tablet of Al).mad, have been invested by Ba11a'u'llah with
      a special potency and significance, and should therefore be accepted as such and

  7. The word wali (guardian, friend, saint) is derived from walf!Jia (authoritative
      friendship, sainthood). More accurately, both words are derived from the same
      basic semitic root w-l-y from which all of the various related connotations and
      denotations of the two words, such as friendship, guardianship, protection,
      sanctity, allegiance, love, nearness, trust and so on are derived. See also below.
  8 . On this topic, in connection with the Baha'i Faith, there is no better source than
      the writings of John Hatcher, beginning with his The Metaphorical Nature of Plrysical
      &aliry, discussed in detail below. See bibliography for other relevant titles.
  g. For a particularly lucid and masterful discussion of this process as found in Islamic
      mysticism, see Izutsu, 'The Paradox of Light and Darkness'.
Io. This is idea is elaborated further below.
 II. See Eiuviclopaedia of Religi.on and Ethics and the Encyclopaedia of Religi.on, 'covenant'.
      In the Hebrew Bible, God is often represented as making a covenant with
      individuals: Genesis 9:9, I5:I8; Exodus 6:4, 244f; Numbers 25:I3; Deuteronomy
      5:2; .Jeremiah 34:I3. Breaking the covenant was followed by punishment:
      Deuteronomy 17:2ff; Joshua 7:rrff, 23:I6; Judges 2:20; II Kings I8:9-12. Blessing
      followed its being observed, e.g. Psalms l32:I2: 'If your sons keep my covenant and
      my testimonies which I shall teach them, their sons also for ever shall sit upon your
      throne.' Note that the New Testament is know in Arabic as the New Covenant (al-
      'ahd al-jadid).
I2. A summary of the Covenant in Islam is in Taherzadeh, Revelation of Baha'u'llah,
      vol. I, pp. I25-8.
I3- On the recipient of the Tablet of AJ:imad, see Faizi, A Flame of Fire. See also
      Taherzadeh, &uelat,ion of Baha'u'lltih, vol. 2, pp. 107-36.
I4- Readers of Baha'u'llah's Hidden Words wilJ be reminded of Persian no. I9,
      although 'Abdu'l-Baha has indicated that this association is not the most
      important, if it is correct in the first place: 'O :tvfy Friends! Have ye forgotten that
      true and radiant morn, when in tl1ose hallowed and blessed surroundings ye were
      all gathered in My presence beneath the shade of the tree oflife, which is planted
      in the all-glorious paradise? Awe-struck ye listened as T gave utterance to these
      three most holy words: 0 friends! Prefer not your own wilJ to Mine, never desire
      that which I have not desired for you, and approach Me not with lifeless hearts,
      defiled with worldJy desires and cravings. Woulcl ye but sanctify your souls, ye
      would at this present hour recall that place and tl1ose surroundings, and the truth
      of rvfy utterance should be made evident unto all of you.' See 'Abdu'l-Baha's
      interpretation of this text, Taherzacleh, Revelation of Bahd'u'llalz, vol. I, p. Br. On
      the Day of the Covenant and the Day of Resurrection as the defining moments
      of 'Islamic time', see Bowering, 'Ideas of Time in Persian Sufism'.

I6. On the Covenant in the Abrahamic tradition, see Firmage, et al., ReligZ:on and Law.
I7. For the commercial background of this term see Shorter Encyclopaedia of Islam, see

        under 'Bai'. Se_e the related usage of bqy'a in the Kitab-i-Iqan, p. 241/187 quoting
        a Hadith fromJa'far al-~adiq, the sixth Imam: 'There shall appear a Youth from
        Bani-Hashim, Who will bid the people plightfealt)I unto Him. His Book ''l'-ill be a new
        Book, unto which He shall summon the people to pledge theirjaith. Stern is His
        Revelation unto the Arab. If ye hear about Him, hasten unto Him.' (italics added)
  18. See Schimmel, 1\t.(ystical Dimensions ef Jsl,am, pp. 199~11j for a discussion of these
        terms as they are used in Sufism. See Lawson, :t\uthority of the Feminine', for a
        discussion of these terms in Shi'ism and the WTitings of the Bab.
  19. cf. Qur'an 2:27, 4:155, 5:13, 8:56, 13:20, 13:25, 16:91
  20. Observed on 18th of Dhu'-1-Hijja annually. It is an official public holiday in Iran.
  2r. Note the similarity of the language here to that in a passage of '.Abdu'l-Baha's Vlill
        and Testament: 'The sacred and youthful branch, the Guardian of the Cause of
        God, as well as the Universal House of Justice to be universally elected and
        established, are both under the care and protection of the Abha Beauty, under the
        shelter and unerring guidance oC the Exalted One (may my life be offered up for
        them both). ·whatsoever they decide is of God. Whoso ohryeth him not, neither obeyetl1
        them, hath not obryed God; whoso rebelleth against him and against them hath rebelled aga.imt
        God; whoso opposeth him hath opposed God; whoso contendetl1 with them hath contended with God;
        whoso disputeth with him hath disputed witli G<!d; whoso deuieth him hath denied God; whoso
        disbtlwvet.h in him hath disbelieved in God; whoso deviateth, separateth hrmse!j and turneth a.rUJ.e
       jTJm hiin !wth in iruth deviated, separated himself and turned a.side.from God. May the wrath,
        the fierce indignation, the vengeance of God rest upon him!' p. I 1. (italics added)
 22. al-Mufid, Kit6.b al-lrsh6.d, pp. 124-5. Translation slightly adapted. On 'Umar's
        eventual breaking of the Covenant, see :t\bdu'l-Baha summarized below.
  2'.j. It is interesting to observe that the topic of Covenant acts as something of a pivot
        for other important doctrinal disputes and questions: the corruption of the
        Qur'an, the notion of fora (human nature), creation itself and so on.
  24. The word seed, Arabic dharr, is understood here. Dharr figures very prominently
        in some of the more abstruse discussions of creational metaphysics in the writings
        of Shay:kb, . Al;unad and the Bab.

  27. Shoghi Effendi, Guidance.for Toda;y and Tomorrow, p. 226.
 28. The Holy Traditions, sometimes called akl1b6.r, may be seen as the actual presence
        of the Imams, Muhammad's progeny - the people of his house in 'literary'
        form. See Lawson, 'Dangers', pp. i 76-8.
 '29. In the beginning of his m.ission, the Bab invoked the authority of the Covenant
        through the very structure of his Qayyum al-asma, each chapter of which
        contains 42 verses. forty-two is the numerical equivalent of the Quranic 'Yea
        verily [we do testify]!' (baM) found in Qur'an p72 quoted above. It signifies that
        God is God and therefore obedience is due Him - in short, this single word
        symbolizes the Covenant.
 30. From the Lawl)-i Hizar-Bayt of '.Abdu'l-Baha, summarized by Taherzadeh,
        Revelation ef Bah6.'u'll6.h, vol. 1, p. 127.                .
  31. Qur'an e.g. 3:151, 4:91, 4:153, n:g6. The word al-Sultan was eventually adopted by
        rulers who had effectively wrested power from tl1e Caliphate and it came,
        therefore, to stand for the bearer of political authoriLy as distinct from the bearer
        of spiritual authority.

     32. Qur'an 2:32, 4:rr, 4:17, 4:24, 4:26, 4:92, 4:104, 4:1n, 4:170, 8:71, 9:15, 9:28, 9:60,

         60:10, 66:2, 76:30. Other frequent compound epithets are 'the Merciful, the
         Compassionate' (al-ral]man al-ral]ih) and the Living, the Eternal (al-baye al-()gJ!JZim).
     33. Baqli, S!zarf;-i sha{f;fyat, p. 153; idem, Ki.tab 'abhar al- 'ashiqin, p. 34; cf. also ibid. p. 3
         for a brief reference to the 'niche' mentioned in the famous Light Verse (Qur'an
         24:35), where Ruzbihan says that humanity has been made a 'niche' for the light
         of the glory of God (nur bahti'i-hz). See the discussion of the 'Light Verse' below.
     34. Remember also that it was beneath sidrat al-nzuntaha that the primordial Covenant
         was taken. See above. A standard reference for both tree and bird imagery in an
         Islamicate milieu is ·vvensinck, Tree and Bird. Cole, 'World as Text' is fargely about
         tree and bird imagery in a work by Shaykh Ah.mad al-Ahsa'i. See also his
         interesting remarks on the etymological relationship obtaining among the words
         'tree', 'true' and 'druid'. See also the recent anthropological study by Fernandez
         ('Trees of Knowledge of Self') for a discussion of trees as symbolic of self
         knowledge. In connection with the theme of duality and 'seeing double', the motif
         of reversal (a sub-species of duality) is found expressed in a most evocative context
         in the universal image of the inverted tree, suggested by Qur'an 69:23 to none
         other than Karim Khan K.:irmam, arch-rival of the Bab, who cites a tradition
         from ~ in explanation of the verse: 'The trees of Paradise are the inverse of the
         trees of this world. The trees of Paradise have their roots above and their
         branches below.' Quoted in Corbin, Spiritual Borfy, pp. 225-6; see Corbin, Spiritual

         interpretation by Muhammad al-Baqir (the fifth Imam and father of al-~adig) to
         stand side by side with this one: the 'niche' is the breast of the believers, and the
         first 'lamp' is the heart, the second 'lamp' is the light which God put in the heart
         of the believer, the 'tree' is the believer (qtif.a: al-sfuy"ara af.mu'min; cf. ~<\bdu'l-Baha's

      possibly because it speaks so directly and specifically to the Shi'i eschaton, which,
      as we have seen, was one of the primary topics associated v.-ith the exegesis of the
     verse of the Covenant - the tone and contents of which Shoghi Effendi perhaps
      considered as too arcane and parochial for a wider readership.

 52. This noun, translated here as a verbal phrase by tl1e Guardian, is highly
      significant and there is no space left to discuss it in full. I have referred to it below
      in the discussion of amphiboly but it really deserves a separate study. Suffice it for
      the moment to point out that it represents a mode of knowledge quite different
      from tl1e 'ilm of the sacerdotal establishment and may best be translated as
      recognition, possibly intuition and sometimes even gnosis. It is the word for 'to
      know' that God speaks in the Hadith of the Hidden Treasure referred to more
      fully below. (c£ also the Hadith man 'arefa quoted or referred to many times in
      Baha'i \Hitings: 'He who knows himself knows his lord.') The 'recognition' of the
      true bearer of waldya is essential for upholding the Covenant. See Lawson, 'Islam
      and the "lower" senses'.

 56. The Quranic verses are considered miraculous for three basic reasons: their sheer
      beauty and persuasive or rhetorical power, their 'alchemical' ability to transform
      tl1e lead of human nature into the 'gold' of human spirituality, and the 'fact' tl1at
      Muhammad was supposedly illiterate, thus the appearance of such exquisite and
      remarkable language from such a person is analogous to the birth of Jesus from a
      virgin. Here it is rarely observed that the Qur'an is an oral composition, making
      the whole question of literacy irrelevant.
 57. In this connection, note the celebrated Hadith Kumayl, quoted in tl1e Kitab-i-
      iqan, p. 164/r28. The first Imam was asked by one of his closest disciples 'O

      wixbout reference to anything else (bi-ta is/ui.ra).' See also Lawson, 'The Bab's

      3) We shall have leisure for you, 0 ye two burdensome companies. [n J (.Bell Bell's
      note, vol. 2, p. ,)50: 'or two races, i.e. jinn and men. Elsewhere Bell says: 'lThis
      verse] contains a threat that in spite of His occupations Allah will have time to
      deal with men andjinn, the thaqaldn.')
      4) We shall dispose of you, 0 ye two dependents (man and jinn~. (Pickthall)
      5) We shall soon be free to turn to you, 0 weary caravans. (Ahmed Ali)
      6) Soon shall We attend to you, 0 ye two big groups. (Maulmvi Sher Ali as v. 32)
      7) 0 you burdens of the earth, we shall soon be getting free to caU you to account.
      (Maududi) Maududi's note: Thaqa! is the burden loaded on a conveyance.
       Tiiaqaldn (dual), therefore, ""'ill mean: 'two Joaded burdens'. Here this word refers
      to jinn and men, who are both loaded on the earth. A':i the addressees here are
      those jinn and men who have turned away from the service and obedience of
      their Lord, they have been addressed as: 'O burdens of the earth.' In other words,
      the Creator is warning these two disobedient companies of His creation, saying:
      'O you who have become a burden for l'viy earth, I am soon getting free to take
      you to task.' This does~not mean that Allah at this time is too l:Jusy tb call the
      disobedient servants to account but it means that Allah has arranged a special
      timetable according to which the time for the fmal accountability and reckoning
      of the jinn and men has not yet come. (p. 878)

      which appears at its end. It would be very interesting to see what Yusuf Ali ""'Tote
      originally. In an earlier edition by the same publisher (1983) the note, this time on
      p. r476, is perhaps the original, though I have not verified this. I have indicated the
      variations of the text as follows: {-} indicates material deleted in the later edition;
      *-* indicates material added in the later edition. Thus it can be seen how the
      Guardian's translation of the word in the Tablet of Al;,mad has much in common
      with the interpretation offered in this note by Yusuf Ali.

     i-Aqdas, para. 4/4, and the Book ef tlie Covenant/ JGtab-i I4hd, p. 220/ 198. It may be
                  that detecting the 'fragrance/ 'a.if' mentioned here in tl1e poetic figure
     is actually a metaphor for the recognition of spiritual authority I walqya. Note that
     'a.if is built on the same root as 'iiflm., the very word used in the first line of the
     Aqdas mentioned below in note 92. From l-b-s the Arabic word libs
     clothing' is formed, as is the word labs, lubs 'confusion, ambiguity' i.e.
     is clothed in such a way that its true identity is unrecognizable or \'eiled.

    to "Vicegerency" debar you               the sovereignty of Him Who is the Vicegerent
    of God, which overshadoweth aU the worlds! (Baha'u'Uah, Kitab-i-Aqdas, para.
    r67) As stated in the notes to the                          'The word here translated
    "Vicegerency" is, in the original Arabic,               , which has a range of meanings
    including "vicegerency", "guardianship", "protectorship" and "successorship". It
    is used in relation to God Himself, to His Manifestation, or to those who are the
    appointed Successors of a Manifestation.' (ibid. note 181) See also Baha'u'llah,
    Gleanings, pp. r75-6, no. 89: "W'.hoso, while reacling the Sacred Scriptures, is
    tempted to choose therefrom whatever may suit him with which to challenge the
    authority of the Representative of God among men, is, indeed, as one dead,
    though to outward seeming he may walk and converse with his neighbours, and
    share with them their food and their drink' 'Representative of God' is Shoghi
    Effendi's translation of ma~la'u'l-wal4Jat (many thanks to Moojan Momen for this

93. 'Seeing double' also applies to the other senses so that reading is done through
    hearing, tasting, touching, feeling and so on.
94. See the article by Izutsu mentioned above. Elsewhere, speaking of the                    of
    seeing double for progress along the spiritual path, Izutsu has written:              who
    has reached this stage is known in the tradition of Islamic Philosophy as a "man
    of two          dhu al-'G;)lru1yn. He is a man who, with his right eye sees Unity, i.e.
    Absolute            and nothing but Unity, while ivith his left eye he sees multiplicity;
    i.e. the world     phenomenal thillgs .. ·. in addition to the simultaneous vision of
    Unity and Multiplicity, he knows that these t:wo are ultimately one and the same
    thing. Such being the case he recognizes ill every one of the actually existent
    things two different aspects: the aspect of fanli and the              of baqd.'.j (Izutsu,
    'The Basic Structure', p. 19. cf. the above comments on              'Tree of baqd.". See
    also Chittick, The Sufi Path ef Knowledge, pp. 356ff:            with Two Eyes')
95. cf. the Tradition: 'The human form is the greatest proof of God to creation.'
    (Kashani, Kalimd.t, p. 125) The implications for ecology are obvious. H poetic and
    metaphorical trees are allowed to die, then earthly trees are also doomed. See also
    Sours, 'Ecofeminist critique'. It is also interesting, in the present context, to note
    that early Muslim scholars divided the earth into two parts: the region where
    Islam had yet to be established, knovm as the abode of strife or war (dar al-4arb),
    and the region where Islam had been established, known as the abode of peace
          SEELNG DOUBLE: THE       COVE.NA.i~    AND THE TABLET OF .!\J:IMAD/Lawson

               or secw-ity. This region could be known either as dar al-Islam 'the Abode of Islam'
               or dar al-'alui 'the Abode of the Covenant'. (Djalili, 'International Law', p. 214)
               One implication of this in this context is that \vhere the Covenant is established
               the physical environment is deja.eta protected as an instrumentality for registering
               the divine and for the divine registering humanity or, perhaps better, more fully
               humanizing humanity. Similarly, the abode of strife entails not only political ru1d
               social warfare but al~o 'environmental warfare'. c( 'The leaves are yellowed by the
               poisoning winds of sedition.' (Baha'u'llah, 'Fire Tablet', Baha'i Prl±Jm, p. 316)
           96. Corbin, En Islam iranien, vol. 3, pp. 75-G.
           97. ibid. p. 59. Ruzbihan may be influenced here by the Arabic poetic tradition where
               a verse of poetry is called a 'tent' in which the damsel of meaning (ma'na) resides
               protected, awaiting reunion with her lover. Hurni later would refer to the Qur'an
               itself a~ a bride (precisely 'art.ls) and there can be no question here of Rumi
               teaching that the Qur'an should submit to anyone; rather the suggestion is that
               the reader/husband, through love, submit to his bride/the Qur'an. See 1viurata,
               The Tao ef Islam, p. 226. cf. also Ghazali's famous metaphor of sexual ecstasy for
               spiritual and intellectual knowledge: i.e. that it cannot be explained or taught but
               must be experienced directly. (Ghaza.li, The Incoherence qf the Philosoj1hers, pp. 213-14)

               by Ekbal, 'Daena-Den-Din'. See also rhe important analysis in Buck, Paradise and

          100. This is not to suggest that this powerful image be intellectualized or 'sanitized' and
               therefore rendered a mere allegory (an integer in a formula). Rather, it is
               suggested that the idea of the encounter ·with Meaning be read alongside other
               possible meanings - another form of seeing double - perhaps privileging this
               reading over iliat for emphasis in various contexts. In short, the Maid of Heaven
               must be allowed to remain a vibrant and living symbol.

               (It may be of some incidental interest to note that Hajj Karim Khan K.irmani,
               one of the most vociferous detractors of the Bab, had only one eye.) The Bab

           because the gate is [merely] the pointer (al-ishdra).' (provisional translation; Tef.rir
           Szirat al-Baqara, p. 12) cf also the Hadith of Kumayl: kaslif,suhulpit al-ja!iI.l min ghayr

            l64/r28-166/r29. See also Lawson, 'The Bab's Epistle on the Spiritualjourney
           towards God' in this issue. In his refotation of Shaykh Al_unad's Risalat al-'ibnfyya,
           the reno\-vned 19th-century Iranian philosopher Mulla Hacli Sabzavari contends
           that its author ultimately lacked 'perspective' in his condemnation of walµlat al-
           wzg'zid ('existential monism'). He says that had Shaykh AJ.imad been able to see
           with 'two eyes' he would have understood that even though the divine essence is,
           of course, utterly unknowable ancl 'beyond being', it is still permissible and even
           necessary to speak about proximity to it, its knowledge and so on. (Sabzavari,
           Shad!, p. 667) On this work of Shaykh Al_1mad's, see Lawson, 'Orthodoxy and
           Heterodoxy'. Two Traditions from the Prophet Muhammad regarding the two
           eyes of the heart are contained in Amuli, Jami' al-a.rrar, p. 581. One reads: 'Verily,
           the heart has two eyes, just like the body. With the physical eye the physical realm
           is seen, with the eye of Reality, which is spiritual, the inner spiritual reahn and the
           divine realities are seen.' The other is very similar.

     105. On the Homeric life of duality and the coincidence of opposites, see the recent
           work of Van Duzer, Duality and Structure. His thesis has implications for tracing the
           thought of such pre-Socratic philosophers as Heraclitus (on whom see Enqyclopedia
           ef PhiloS1Jphy, q.v. 'Heraclitus of Ephesus', especially p. 478). For a later philosophic
           celebration of duality and opposition, see Nicholas of Cusa, Vision and Hopkins.
           The question of a possible Islamicate influence in Cusa's thought on this topic is
           broached in Lawson, 'Nicholas'. In Lawson, 'Interpretation', some of the
           remarkable coincidences of opposites (c£ coincidentia oppositorum) found in the
           Qayyi'.un al-asma are mentioned and in Lawson, 'The Qur'an Commentary', a
           preliminary analysis of these figures is offered, especially pp. 329-6r.
     l06. Kristeva, Tat.es of LJve, p. 70. She continues, 'One should understand that each sex
           is the "symbol" of the other, its complement and support, its bestower of
           meaning. Love, as tendency toward synthesis, would be precisely that which
           creates the recognition of signs, a reading, significations, and would thus set itself
           up in opposition to the closed, egg-shaped world of androgynes.' See also the
           lucid and stimulating discussion of symbols in Buck, Paradise, passim and especially
           pp. 121: 'Symbols are the illustrations of sacred ideas and ideals' in texts that
           would otherwise be without pictures. And, of course, icons are subject to the
           double vision just like all other phenomena.
     107. See Lawson, 'Reading as Holy Communion'.
     108. A preliminary search turned up over 120 separate uses in the English language
           works.
     rog. 'Abdu'l-Baha, i'vfemoiia!.s, p. 30 and note where there is reference to the wine being
           from the jar of 'Yea, verily!', an allusion to the primordial covenant described in
           Qur'an 7: 172 and discussed above. Note also the very apposite verse .from Rumi
           quoted here, p. 31: 'From every eye Thou hidest well,/ And yet in every eye dost
           dwell.' See also 1\!lemorialr, p. i41 for a similar use of the symbol of wine.
     l ro. Surely it is of some interest here to observe that though one is, by necessity, most
           alone while reading, one is, perhaps, at the same time - and again paradoxically
           - the least lonely. Such an observation has implications for the category 'religions
           of the Book' on which see Corbin, En lsl.a.m iranien, vol. l, pp. 135-218.

 III. Baha'u'llah, Kztab-i-iqan, para 283, pp. 254-5/r97: atyar-i huwfna wa qamdmdt-i

II2. Lewis, 'Scripture' is a foundational and essential study on the relationship
      between the Baha'i canon and the Persian and Islamicate literary tradition. ' ...
      the knowledge of [the Qur'an] is absolutely indispensable for every believer who
      wishes to adequately understand, and intelligently read the 11\Tritings of
      Baha'u'llah.' (From a letter written on behalf of Shoghi Effendi to an individual,
      2 December Ig35, in Lights of Guidance, p. 56I)
rr3. Specifically the work of tl1e celebrated critic Nortl1rop Frye. His last books, The
       Great Code and T'1lords of Power, were devoted to the very interesting proposition that
      all literature and speech in tl1e western world has been formed and deeply
      influenced by tl1e Bible, the so-called Old and New Testaments (or Covenants as
      they are known in Arabic). A kind of summary of these books is the short
      collection of lectures published shortly after his death entitled Tlze Double Vision:
      Language and 1Heanir1.g in Religion and which is partly responsible for the title of this
      essa1~ c£ also the comments on Frye made in 11\Tooclman, ':Metaphor', pp. I-7, 24.
I I4. The 'influence' of tl1e Bible and otl1er earlier scriptures on the Qur'an is a
      controversial and sometimes vexatious topic and one tliat remains to be studied
   - properly. Earlier western scholarship frequently sought to 'expose' the biblical
      provenance of much of the Qur'an's contents. But the motive was to question
      Islam's authenticily as a 'true religion' (whatever t11at might mean). This nalurally
      was taken as an insult by Muslims and the effects of such motives can be felt as an
      impediment today in the academic study of Islam and the Qur'an.
rr5. The works of Arkoun (e.g. Lectures) and others have hinted at such a project.
rr6. It is indicative of the kinds of problems and obstacles that still separate Europe
      from tl1e 'Middle East' that we cannot even think of cognate categories with
      which to describe ourselves. Western/Islamic is certainly false, except if 'western'
      is made to stand for a value that is extra-geographic; 'Enlightenment Territory' is
      cumbersome and stillborn. In any case, Islam has been resident in the 'west' for
      centuries. Vl/e cannot speak of Christian culture precisely because of the allergy
      to religion tl1at developed in the post-Enlightenment period. We cannot refer to
      Islamic culture as eastern and if we use the term middle ea.'ltern it still posits
      Europe and her offspring as t11e point of orientation.
rr7. Of course, it is not a question of inventing metaphor or 'spiritual reading of
      scripture' (something usually credited to Philo in any case). But through a very
      happy coincidence of the virtual elevation of reading to tl1e level of sacrament at
      the same time that the arts of tl1e book were becoming improved and elaborated
      - leading to a more universal spread of literacy than that which had obtained
      heretofore - the Islamicate world refined and cultivated such an approach to texts
      fm beyond that which had gone before, in both scale and intensity.
rr8. 'By virtue of its diffusion in 205 or more sovereign and non-sovereign countries
      and territories, tl1e Kitab-i Iqan emerges as the most influential work of Qur'anic
      exegesis outside of the Muslim world.' (Christopher Buck, 'The Kitab-i iqan')
