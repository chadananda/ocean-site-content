Reflections on Human Rights, Moral
Development, and the Global Campaign

to Eradicate Gender-Based Violence

BY MICHAEL L. PENN

Across the planet, and over the centuries, various forms of violence against
women and girls have been an everyday part of humanity’s social life. In the
middle of the nineteenth century, however, a movement bent on eradicating
gender-related abuses and uplifting the station of women burst upon the world.
Among the progenitors of this movement were two women, one from the East,
the other from the West.

At a time and in a country in which women were denied the most basic
rights, the Persian poetess, Qurratu’l-‘Ayn (also known as Táhirih) openly pro-
claimed the equality of the sexes in a gathering of followers of the Bábí Faith.
In the 1840s, in symbolic representation of one of the many new teachings she
had embraced, Táhirih became the first Middle-Eastern woman ever reported
to have removed her veil in public. A social history of the period captures the
reactions she provoked as she presented herself—“adorned and unveiled”—
before a company of men at a gathering known as the Conference of Badasht:

> …suddenly the figure of Táhirih, adorned and unveiled, appeared before the eyes of the
> assembled companions. Consternation immediately seized the entire gathering. All stood
> aghast before this sudden and most unexpected apparition. To behold her face unveiled
> was to them inconceivable. Even to gaze at her shadow was a thing which they deemed
> improper.… Quietly, silently, and with utmost dignity, Táhirih stepped forward and, ad-
> vancing towards Quddús, seated herself on his right-hand side. Her unruffled serenity
> sharply contrasted with the affrighted countenances of those who were gazing upon her
> face. Fear, anger, and bewilderment stirred the depths of their souls. That sudden revela-
> tion seemed to have stunned their faculties. ‘Abdu’l-Kháliq-i-Isfáhání was so gravely shaken
> that he cut his throat with his own hands. Covered with blood and shrieking with excite-
> ment, he fled away from the face of Táhirih. A few, following his example, abandoned

Global Campaign to Eradicate Gender-Based Violence

> their companions and forsook their Faith. A number were seen standing speechless before
> her, confounded with wonder. 1

In 1848, when the authorities could no longer abide either the new spiritual
teachings that she championed or the remarkable social audacity she displayed,
they arranged for Táhirih’s execution. As the hour of her death approached, she
calmly noted, “`You can kill me as soon as you like, but you cannot stop the
emancipation of women. ’”2 In that same year—in Seneca Falls, New York—
Elizabeth Cady Stanton, joined by one man, Frederick Douglass, and a company
of inspired women, initiated the women’s movement in the West.

Stanton’s oration at the opening of the Seneca Falls Convention was no less
memorable than Táhirih’s bold unveiling at the Conference of Badasht. On
Wednesday, 19 July 1848, Stanton arose and addressed the assembled delegates:

> …Verily, the world waits the coming of some new element, some purifying power, some
> spirit of mercy and love. The voice of woman has been silenced in the state, the church,
> and the home, but man cannot fulfill his destiny alone, he cannot redeem his race un-
> aided.… The world has never seen a truly great and virtuous nation, because in the degra-
> dation of woman the very fountains of life are poisoned at their source. It is vain to look for
> silver and gold from mines of copper and lead. It is the wise Mother that has the wise son.
> So long as your women are slaves you may throw your colleges and churches to the
> winds.… Truly are the sins of the fathers visited upon the children to the third and fourth
> generation. God, in his wisdom, has so linked the whole human family together that any
> violence done at one end of the chain is felt throughout its length, and here, too, is the law
> of restoration, as in woman all have fallen, so in her elevation shall the race be recreated.3

Although the women’s movement would enjoy several impressive victories
in the decades following the momentous events in Persia and in Seneca Falls, it
would take more than a full century before efforts to eradicate gender-based
violence would begin to capture the attention of the world. The processes
contributing to the globalization of this campaign can be traced to the founding
of the United Nations in June 1945; to the creation of the Commission on Hu-
man Rights in February 1946 and of the Commission on the Status of Women in
June of that same year; and to the adoption of the Universal Declaration of
Human Rights in December 1948. The goal of this paper is to review some of
the most significant developments in human rights law designed to contribute
to the advancement of women and the eradication of gender-based violence. It
is suggested that while the movement to date has won many impressive victo-
ries, the global campaign to eradicate gender-based violence and to improve
the overall status of women and girls is significantly impaired by the neglect of

Reflections on Human Rights, Moral Development and the

the characterological, moral and spiritual dimensions of the individual and of
the society that must be attended to if law is to serve as a vehicle for the
promotion of justice, the protection of women’s rights and the creation of a
culture of peace. And while it is true that in the most recent past NGOs and
other institutions that are concerned with the well-being of women and girls
have begun to give attention to the psycho-spiritual dimensions of discrimina-
tion and gender-based violence, overall, these aspects continue to receive far
less attention than would be warranted by their importance.

The Globalization of the Effort to Eradicate Gender-Based Violence

The establishment of the United Nations’ Commission on the Status of Women
was among the most significant early developments in the globalization of the
women’s movement. At its inaugural meeting, held in February 1947, the Com-
mission resolved to work “to raise the status of women, irrespective of nation-
ality, race, language or religion,” to establish “equality with men in all fields of
human enterprise, and to eliminate all discrimination against women in the
provision of statutory law, in legal maxims or rules, or in interpretations of
customary law.”4 As significant and far reaching as these goals were, no mention
was made about the need to eliminate sexual and/or physical violence against
women and girls. It would take several more decades before this problem
would receive sustained international public attention and be adopted as a sig-
nificant concern of the world body.

Nevertheless, one of the earliest and most important accomplishments of
the Commission on the Status of Women—an accomplishment that would ulti-
mately prove vital to the campaign to eradicate gender-based violence—was
the Commission’s influence on shaping the language of the Universal Declara-
tion of Human Rights. Upon the Commission’s insistence, the Declaration, which
was adopted in Paris on 10 December 1948 by unanimous vote, was divested of
its gender-insensitive language and tailored to affirm, explicitly, the equality
of women and men. 5 The Preamble to the Declaration sets the tone by affirming
the UN’s commitment to the equality of the sexes: “the peoples of the United
Nations have in the Charter reaffirmed their faith in fundamental human rights,
in the dignity and worth of the human person and in the equal rights of men and
women.”

Another significant step in advancing women’s human rights was taken in
1952 when the UN General Assembly adopted the Convention on the Political
Rights of Women. Entered into force in 1954, this Convention was the first
instrument of international law framed specifically for the protection of the
political rights of women everywhere. It provides that the women of the world,

Global Campaign to Eradicate Gender-Based Violence

whatever their homeland, are entitled to vote in any election, run for any po-
litical office, exercise any public function, and hold any public position that a
man may hold.

In the areas of work and education, the Commission on the Status of Women
also began to gain an appreciation for the impact of inequality on women’s qual-
ity of life. Near the end of the 1940s it collaborated with the International
Labour Organization on women’s economic rights. The fruit of that collabora-
tion was the inclusion in the 1948 Universal Declaration of Human Rights of an
article (Article 23) specifying that everyone, without discrimination, has the
right to equal pay for equal work. The Commission also collaborated with
UNESCO (United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization)
in developing basic educational programs that would afford women and girls
the same access to education that is provided to men and boys. Although great
disparities in access to education continue in many countries, this early work
brought to the United Nations a consciousness of the importance of education
to women’s advancement.

Since the right to nationality is the political basis for many other rights, and
since many national laws require that married women automatically take their
husband’s nationality, international human-rights observers noted that this tradi-
tion left many women vulnerable to losing their own nationality without their
consent. Divorced women, or women who chose to leave their husbands, were
particularly vulnerable to becoming stateless. Recognizing this vulnerability,
the Commission on the Status of Women completed a draft treaty on the nation-
ality rights of married women and in 1955 submitted it to the UN General
Assembly. The Convention on the Nationality of Married Women provided
for the right of a woman to retain her nationality if she so desired, even if her
nationality would be different from that of her husband. Although the Conven-
tion was approved in 1957, and the treaty came into force in 1958, the resistance
of some governments to many of the treaty provisions signaled the difficulties
that would attend any effort to secure nationality rights for women that were
independent of that of their husbands.6

A second measure adopted by the United Nations relating to marriage was
the Convention and Recommendation on Consent to Marriage, Minimum Age
for Marriage and Registration of Marriages. Adopted by the General Assembly
in November 1962, and entered into force in December 1964, the convention
was necessary because of the widespread practice of forced child marriage. It
requires that no marriage take place without the full and free consent of both
parties but leaves it to individual governments to determine the minimum age
at which one may enter into a marriage. With the exception of provisions in the
Declaration on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women (1967), and

the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women
(1979), the agreements framed between 1955 and 1962 constitute all the interna-
tional agreements entered into by the United Nations related to women’s rights
in marriage.7

In the 1950s the Commission on the Status of Women began to express res-
ervations about what amounted to violence perpetrated against women in the
name of customary law, religious practices, and traditional ceremonies. Such
traditional practices—which include female genital circumcision, virginity tests,
dowry and widow burnings, and early childhood marriages—were brought to
the attention of Member States who were encouraged to “take immediately all
necessary measures with a view to abolishing.… all customs which violate the
physical integrity of women, and which thereby violate the dignity and worth of
the human person as proclaimed in the Charter and in the Universal Declara-
tion of Human Rights.”8 In the General Assembly the response of Member
States was mixed. Some maintained that only a gradual process of education
could lead to the eradication of such practices; some suggested that the effort to
abolish traditional practices was in violation of the UN Charter, which pro-
scribes interference in the domestic affairs of Member States; others felt that
traditional practices that compromise the health and well-being of women and
girls should be abolished.

When the World Health Organization refused to undertake a study on the
effects of genital circumcision for the Commission on the Status of Women, the
question of the adverse effects of traditional practices on the well-being of
women and girls was abandoned for approximately twenty years and did not
become a focus of international attention again until the UN’s International
Women’s Year in 1975.9 In 1979 the World Health Organization sponsored a
seminar on Traditional Practices Affecting the Health of Women and Children,
but strong efforts to eradicate such practices did not begin to gain momentum
until the mid-1980s when a growing number of individuals and organizations,
both within and outside of the human rights community, began to consider fe-
male genital circumcision a form of gender-based violence. Such practices, a
growing number of voices began to insist, could no longer be justified in the
name of the sanctity of culture, religion, or tradition.

During the 1960s and 1970s, as former African colonies began to seize their
independence, the number and diversity of Member States at the United Na-
tions grew dramatically. In addition, the economic and social consequences of
centuries of oppression and injustice had crippled the human and material re-
sources of many colonized nations and had begun to present acute threats to the
lives of millions of people—particularly of women and girls—throughout the
developing world. For this reason the survival-related concerns of women in

developing countries began to eclipse the UN’s earlier focus on securing
women’s legal rights.

Concurrently, the economic and health-related problems associated with
the emergence of fledgling nations from colonial rule served to awaken the
Commission on the Status of Women to the disproportionate impact of poverty
and inequality on the lives of women and girls:

> The work of the Commission on the Status of Women in the 1960s and 1970s thus began
> to take it beyond the negotiating tables in New York and Geneva and into the fields and
> rice paddies of the developing world. Such issues as women’s needs in community and
> rural development, agricultural work, family planning and the impact of scientific and
> technological advances on women became increasingly prominent in the Commission’s
> work. This was the first step in a growing perception among United Nations bodies con-
> cerned with development, that the Charter’s promise to ‘promote social progress and
> better the standards of life in larger freedom’ could not be met without the full participa-
> tion of women in society.10

Realizing the grass-roots needs of so many of the world’s women, the Eco-
nomic and Social Council, along with the General Assembly, called upon gov-
ernments to turn to the United Nations for technical assistance in their
development efforts. In addition, organizations within the UN system—such as
the United Nations Children’s Fund and the United Nations Development
Programme—were asked to give special attention to the social and economic
advancement of women in the developing countries.

In an effort to highlight women’s vital role in national and international de-
velopment, and with a view to promoting the equality of men and women in the
international arena, the Commission on the Status of Women recommended that
1975 be designated International Women’s Year. The General Assembly not
only endorsed this recommendation but suggested that, in addition to the themes
of development and equality, International Women’s Year be used to heighten
awareness of the importance of women in promoting world peace.

Perhaps the most significant event of International Women’s Year was the
first global conference on women’s issues ever to be held. The conference
took place in June 1975 in Mexico City. Delegations, 113 of them headed by
women, from more than 133 Member States were present. According to a his-
tory of the advancement of women, the UN’s Secretary-General, in his opening
remarks to the assembled delegates, observed that the conference in Mexico
City was “the first major step in a worldwide attempt to achieve equality be-
tween men and women and to end separation of the sexes in matters of educa-

tion, opportunities and economic priorities.”11 At the close of the conference
the delegates adopted the Declaration of Mexico on the Equality of Women
and Their Contribution to Development and Peace. The Declaration specified
a set of principles that stress the role of women in promoting and maintaining
peace in all spheres of life, including the family, the community, the nation, and
the international arena.

The World Plan of Action for the Implementation of the Objectives of the Interna-
tional Women’s Year was also drafted at the Mexico City conference. This docu-
ment specified three main objectives: to promote gender equality; to facilitate
the integration of women in all development efforts; and to strengthen the
contribution of women to the global movement for world peace. Although the
Plan left it to each country to specify the means whereby these objectives were
to be met, it also outlined minimum goals to be achieved by 1980, the mid-
point of the Decade for Women, which would begin in 1976. These goals in-
cluded efforts combating problems affecting female migrant workers, female
prisoners, and women and girls forced into prostitution; achieving equality of
access to education for women at all levels of schooling; increasing employ-
ment opportunities for women throughout the world; passing laws to ensure
greater participation by women in politics and governance; and making signifi-
cant improvements in women’s access to adequate nutrition, housing, health care
and family planning.

The United Nations declared the period between 1976 and 1985 the UN
Decade for Women. During this period the women’s international human-rights
movement re-emerged as a major concern and began to gather renewed sup-
port and unprecedented momentum. The adoption in 1979 of the Convention on
the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women, together with
international women’s conferences in Copenhagen, Denmark, in 1980 and in
Nairobi, Kenya, in 1985, not only brought women’s issues to the fore but began
to strengthen the effectiveness of nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) that
were moving to the forefront in the effort to promote the advancement of
women. Such organizations began to link violence and discrimination against
women to a variety of national and international crises, including war,
homelessness, illiteracy, poverty, malnutrition, overpopulation, poor health,
and high rates of infant mortality. As a result of their growing strength and
effectiveness, NGOs began to transform the United Nations into a world body
that is not only responsive to the needs and wishes of governments but that is
also receptive to policy recommendations and guidance from the grass roots.

The Convention on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women, an
important action taken during the UN Decade for Women, was adopted by the
United Nations General Assembly on 18 December 1979 and entered into force

as an international treaty on 3 September 1981. Since its adoption, more than 150
nations have agreed to be bound by its provisions.

The spirit and objectives of the Convention are animated by the same vision
and goals that gave birth to the United Nations: “to reaffirm faith in fundamental
human rights, in the dignity and worth of the human person, in the equal rights of
men and women.”12 As an international treaty, the Convention accomplishes two
major objectives. First, it establishes an international bill of rights for women
and specifies a set of actions to be taken by the nations of the world to ensure
that these rights are enjoyed. Second, it mandates the establishment of the Com-
mittee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW), which
is charged with ensuring that the provisions of the Convention are observed.

The notion of gender equality as defined in the Convention is not theoreti-
cal but practical. Its goal, as specified in Article 1 and elaborated in Articles 2
through 30, is to effect equality rather than provide an abstract definition of it.
The Convention seeks to establish gender equality by prohibiting all forms of
discrimination against women and by defining discrimination as “any distinc-
tion, exclusion or restriction made on the basis of sex which has the effect or
purpose of impairing or nullifying the recognition, enjoyment or exercise by
women, irrespective of their marital status, on a basis of equality of men and
women, human rights and fundamental freedoms in the political, economic, so-
cial, cultural, civil or any other field.”13

Articles 2 through 30 of the Convention require signatories both to con-
demn all forms of discrimination against women and to “pursue by all appro-
priate means and without delay” such policies as would result in the elimination
of existing discriminatory practices.14 Steps to be taken to fulfill the Conven-
tion include: embodying the principle of equality of men and women in all
national constitutions or other appropriate legislation; adopting legislative
measures that prohibit and sanction all discrimination against women; estab-
lishing legal protection of the rights of women on an equal basis with men;
actively involving signatories in the elimination of discrimination against women
by any person, organization, or enterprise; modifying or abolishing existing
laws, regulations, customs, and practices that constitute discrimination against
women; and repealing all national penal provisions that constitute discrimina-
tion against women.

Articles of the Convention also require States Parties to take appropriate
measures to ensure the full development and advancement of women in all
fields of endeavor; to modify those social and cultural practices that are based
on the idea of the inferiority or superiority of either of the sexes or that
promote stereotyped roles for women or men; and to adopt special measures

aimed at protecting maternity, specifying that such measures “shall not be con-
sidered discriminatory.” 15 The Convention proscribes all forms of prostitu-
tion, sexual exploitation, and trafficking in women and seeks to ensure that
women enjoy equal rights with men in the exercise of political freedom and
the freedom to participate in all forms of public life.

States Parties are urged in the Convention to grant women equal rights with
men to acquire, change, or retain their nationality upon marriage or divorce.
The Convention grants women equal rights with men to establish the nationality
of their children. The rights of women to enjoy equal access to education and
employment are affirmed, while all discriminatory practices in the field of
health care are abrogated, including discriminatory access to health-care ser-
vices and family planning. Particular problems faced by rural women are ad-
dressed, and signatories are mandated to ensure that rural women participate
fully in, and benefit from, all development. Several Articles of the Convention
require States Parties to accord women full equality with men before the law
and establish that women and men shall enjoy the same rights within marriage
and family life. Part 5 of the Convention, which includes Articles 17 through 30,
is concerned with establishing mechanisms through which the provisions of the
Convention are to be adopted, monitored, and enforced.

The adoption of the Convention on the Elimination of Discrimination against
Women was a major action during the UN Decade for Women. But at the
Copenhagen Conference, which took place in 1980 at the mid-point of the United
Nations Decade for Women, it became clear to the delegates that the goals
articulated in Mexico City could never be achieved by laws alone. Many rec-
ognized that, without a sustained measure of grass-roots social action and with-
out a high level of political commitment, the goals were just that—goals.
Following Copenhagen, at least some of the focus of the movement for the
advancement of women began to be concentrated on mobilizing more effec-
tively at the grass roots. In addition to concentrating on grass-roots efforts, one
of the most important developments of the Copenhagen Conference would be
little noticed: Some of the delegates began to discuss the lack of involvement
of men in improving the status and role of women in society.

The third global conference on women was held in 1985 in Nairobi at the
end of the UN Decade for Women. At that conference, and at the preparatory
conference that took place in Vienna the preceding year, delegates agreed that
the goals for the second half of the Decade for Women had not been achieved.
However, the experience gained in international consultation at the two previ-
ous conferences generated a spirit of confidence and optimism that united the
hearts of the delegates in ways that the previous conferences had failed to do.

When they left Nairobi, many did so with a profound sense of sisterhood and
solidarity that cut across traditional lines of race, class, and culture.

The second major accomplishment of the Nairobi Conference was the clear
emergence of a consensus among the delegates that gender-based violence
would have to be addressed as a human-rights issue in the international legal
and political arenas. The major document coming out of that Conference—the
Nairobi Forward-Looking Strategies for the Advancement of Women—noted
that:

> Violence against women exists in various forms in everyday life in all societies. Women
> are beaten, mutilated, burned, sexually abused and raped. Such violence is a major ob-
> stacle to the achievement of peace and the other objectives of the Decade and should be
> given special attention. Women victims of violence should be given particular attention
> and comprehensive assistance. To this end, legal measures should be formulated to pre-
> vent violence and to assist women victims. National machineries should be established in
> order to deal with the question of violence against women within the family and society.
> Preventive policies should be elaborated, and institutionalized forms of assistance to
> women provided.16

The call raised at the Nairobi conference for addressing gender-based vio-
lence began to bear fruit. In May 1990, the UN’s Economic and Social Council
recognized that gender-based violence in the family and society “is pervasive
and cuts across lines of income, class and culture.” “Efforts to eradicate it,” the
Council noted, “must be matched by urgent and effective steps…” The Council
called upon governments to take immediate and decisive steps to establish
appropriate penalties for violence against women, as well as to reduce its
impact in the family, the workplace, and society.17

In 1992 the Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women
(CEDAW) moved to rectify the omission in 1979 of gender-based violence
from the Convention of the same name. At its eleventh session, CEDAW re-
solved to include gender-based violence under the rubric of gender-based
discrimination. Gender-based discrimination, according to CEDAW, is “vio-
lence which is directed against a woman because she is a woman or which
affects women disproportionately. It includes acts which inflict physical, men-
tal or sexual harm or suffering, threats of such acts, coercion, and other depriva-
tion of liberty.” CEDAW went further to request that States Parties undertake
appropriate and effective measures to end all forms of gender-based violence,
whether such violence be by public or private act. 18

Joining the voices raised against gender-based violence is the Vienna Dec-
laration and Programme of Action, adopted by the World Conference on Hu-
man Rights, held in Vienna, Austria, in June 1993. Part I, paragraph 18, of that
document, addresses violence against women:

> The human rights of women and of the girl-child are an inalienable, integral and indivisible
> part of universal human rights. The full and equal participation of women in political, civil,
> economic, social and cultural life, at the national, regional and international levels, and the
> eradication of all forms of discrimination on grounds of sex are priority objectives of the
> international community. Gender based violence and all forms of sexual harassment and
> exploitation, including those resulting from cultural prejudice and international trafficking,
> are incompatible with the dignity and worth of the human person, and must be elimi-
> nated.19

Part II, paragraph 38, continues:

> The World Conference on Human Rights stresses the importance of working towards the
> elimination of violence against women in public and private life, the elimination of all
> forms of sexual harassment, exploitation and trafficking in women, the elimination of
> gender bias in the administration of justice and the eradication of any conflicts which may
> arise between the rights of women and the harmful effects of certain traditional or cus-
> tomary practices, cultural prejudices and religious extremism.20

In 1993 the UN Declaration on the Elimination of Violence against Women—
adopted by the General Assembly at its forty-eighth session on 20 December
1993—became the first international human-rights instrument designed exclu-
sively to deal with violence against women.

Although not legally binding, the Declaration on the Elimination of Vio-
lence against Women (hereafter referred to as the Declaration) provides the
first set of international standards to address the problem of violence against
women and girls. The Preamble to the Declaration affirms that the root cause of
gender-based violence is the “historically unequal power relations between
men and women, which have led to domination over and discrimination against
women by men and to the prevention of the full advancement of women…” In
affirming that “violence against women is one of the crucial social mechanisms
by which women are forced into a subordinate position compared with men,”
the Preamble recognizes that violence is both a result and cause of gender-
related inequities.21

Like the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against
Women, the notion of equality embodied in the Declaration is free of theoreti-
cal speculation. It seeks to ensure that women are allowed and enabled to
enjoy the most fundamental of all human rights—namely, the right to physical
and psychological integrity and safety. Specifically, the Declaration defines
violence against women as physical and sexual violence that takes place within
the family (and that consists of battering, sexual abuse of female children, dowry-
related violence, marital rape, female genital circumcision, and other tradi-
tional practices that have proven to be harmful to women; nonspousal violence;
and violence that attends various forms of female exploitation); violence against
women in the community (which consists of rape, sexual abuse, harassment, and
intimidation in the workplace and educational institutions, trafficking in women,
and forced prostitution); and violence against women that is either perpetrated
or condoned by the State.

Among the most significant contributions to gender equality embodied in
the Declaration are the obligations imposed upon the State both to “condemn”
gender-based violence and to pursue all “appropriate means” and “without de-
lay” to ensure the elimination of violence directed against women within their
national borders. Commenting on State responsibility in this regard, the UN’s
Special Rapporteur on Violence against Women observed:

> The problem of violence against women brings into sharp focus an issue that has been
> troubling the international community—State responsibility for the actions of private citi-
> zens. In the past, a strict judicial interpretation had made the State responsible only for
> actions for which it or its agents are directly accountable. In this case it would relate to
> issues such as women in custody and women in detention and perhaps the problem of
> women during armed conflict. The question of domestic violence, rape and sexual harass-
> ment, etc., were seen as the actions of individuals and thus beyond the “human rights”
> responsibility of the State.22

By specifying a proactive role for the State in all situations in which women
are more likely than men to be victims of violence, the Declaration on the
Elimination of Violence against Women makes it possible to conceptualize
even private acts of violence against women (for example, domestic violence)
as violations of women’s human rights. Inasmuch as the equal protection of all
citizens from violence on account of race, class, religion, or sex is fundamental
to any functional and operational definition of equality, the Declaration pro-
vides a major advance in establishing the equality of women and men world-
wide.

The four actions taken between May 1990 and December 1993—the actions
of the UN’S Economic and Social Council in 1990 and CEDAW in 1991, the
Vienna Declaration in June 1993, and the UN Declaration on the Elimination of
Violence against Women in December 1993—were the first concrete signs of
the international community’s moral and legal commitment to eradicating this
global, age-old problem. They are among the most significant developments in
human-rights law in the twentieth century and are the first to challenge the legal
and moral foundations on which misplaced justifications for allowing gender-
based violence to continue are based.

In its resolution 44/82, the UN’s General Assembly designated 1994 the
International Year of the Family. This act catalyzed a number of processes that
resulted in clarifying the steps necessary to protect and promote the advance-
ment of women and girls. At its thirteenth session, for example, the Committee
on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women chose to mark the Interna-
tional Year of the Family by analyzing three articles in the Convention on the
Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women that have special
significance for the status of women in the family: Articles 9, 15, and 16.

Article 9(1) of CEDAW disallows nationality laws that discriminate against
women by limiting their nationality rights in situations in which men’s rights are
not so limited. In some countries, for example, women are unable to confer on
foreign husbands such rights as may be conferred by men on their foreign
wives (such as the right of residency or the right to become a citizen after a
brief residency period). Furthermore, inasmuch as Article 9(2) provides women
and men with equal rights with respect to the nationality of children, women
who are now prevented from doing so may soon be able to pass citizenship
onto their offspring. (At present the constitutions of several nations provide
that children born outside of the country may become citizens only if their
father is a citizen.) Commenting on the significance of Article 9, Marsha Free-
man, the director of International Women’s Rights Watch, observed:

> Nationality is fundamentally related to women’s exercise of personal liberty and freedom
> of movement. If a woman’s nationality or that of her children is dependent upon her
> husband’s nationality, her ability to make adult decisions as to residence, travel, her children’s
> welfare, or even marriage is severely limited.23

Article 15 of CEDAW provides for the equality of women before the law.

The right of women to attain the age of majority (or legal age) at the same age as
is applied to men; the right of women to undertake contractual obligations and
to sell, buy, and administer property; the right of women to inherit and admin-

ister estates; the right of women to appear before the court on their own behalf
and to have their testimony given weight equal to that of men; and the right of
women to choose freely where they will live or travel without male consent
are all provided for under Article 15.

Article 16 covers marriage and family law and is designed to promote equality
within the family and to protect women from the discriminatory effects of cus-
tomary laws, traditions, and religious practices that usurp the rights of women
and/or girls to choose their own spouse and to give their consent to marriage.
Article 16 also provides that during marriage men and women should be equally
responsible for household and family responsibilities, should have equal rights
to family decision-making, should be equally responsible for children, and
have equal power in discharging familial authority.

In September 1995, during the fiftieth anniversary year of the United Na-
tions, the Fourth World Conference on Women was held in Beijing, China,
with delegations from 189 countries. This gathering represented the largest
United Nations Conference ever held. The Platform for Action and the Beijing
Declaration emerging out of the Conference were adopted unanimously by 189
countries and are among the most comprehensive human-rights documents ever
articulated on behalf of the world’s women. The Platform for Action seeks to
uphold the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against
Women (1979) and to build on the Nairobi Forward-Looking Strategies for the
Advancement of Women (1985). While the Platform for Action’s overall objec-
tive—empowering all women—conforms to the purposes and principles of
the Charter of the United Nations, its immediate aim was to establish a basic
group of priority actions to be carried out during the five-year period be-
tween 1995 and the turn of the century. The Platform for Action contained twelve
areas of critical concern that were to receive special attention:

> 1. The persistent and increasing burden of poverty on women;
2. Inequalities and inadequacies in and unequal access to education and train-

ing;
3. Inequalities and inadequacies in and unequal access to health care and

related services;
> 4. Violence against women;
5. The effects of armed and other kinds of conflict on women, including

those living under foreign occupation;
6. Inequality in economic structures and policies, in all forms of productive

activities and in access to resources;

7. Inequality between men and women in the sharing of power and deci-

sion making at all levels;
8. Insufficient mechanisms at all levels to promote the advancement of

women;
9. Lack of respect for and inadequate promotion and protection of the hu-

man rights of women;
10. Stereotyping of women and inequality in women’s access to and partici-

pation in all communication systems, especially in the media;
11. Gender inequalities in the management of natural resources and in the

safeguarding of the environment;
12. Persistent discrimination against and violation of the rights of the girl

child.24
In its effort to contribute in new ways to the eradication of all forms of
inequality and abuse, the Platform for Action outlines specific actions to be
taken by governments to address each of the problem areas adumbrated above.
In its comprehensiveness it has left almost no institution of civil society un-
touched. Included in the Platform are actions prescribed for national and local
governments, community organizations, nongovernmental organizations, educa-
tional institutions, the public and private sectors, and the mass media as di-
rected by the State. Thus the Platform for Action is one of the most comprehensive
documents ever articulated in the interest of promoting and protecting women’s
human rights.

Since articulation of the Platform for Action measures have been under-
taken to improve the status of women within the United Nations itself. For
example, the numbers of women in professional and decision-making posi-
tions at the UN has increased and are expected to continue to increase. These
changes not only facilitate the realization of the important goals outlined in the
Platform for Action but also serve as greater evidence of the UN’s commitment
to the advancement of women in all fields of human endeavor. Beyond these
steps, the United Nations has, since the Beijing Conference, sought to forge
even stronger bonds with nongovernmental organizations at the grass-roots levels
and has begun to work to encourage a wider spectrum of civil society to con-
tribute to the advancement of women and their protection from human-rights
abuses.

Where Do We Go From Here?

Despite the progress made during the last half century, and notwithstanding
the detailed and much-needed prescriptions for change addressed to govern-
ments and institutions of civil society, violence against women and girls contin-
ues to be a public-health scourge of global proportions. According to the UN’s
Special Rapporteur on Violence against Women, appointed just before the
Beijing Conference in 1994, violence against human beings, and particularly
against women and girls, continues to be a major factor hindering the realiza-
tion of human rights goals:

> War, repression, and the brutalization of public and private life have destroyed the possi-
> bility of human rights being enjoyed as a universal phenomenon. Violence against women,
> in particular, has inhibited women as a group from enjoying the full benefits of human rights.
> Women have been vulnerable to acts of violence in the family, in the community and by
> States. The recorded incidents of such violence have reached such unprecedented pro-
> portions that they have shocked the conscience of the world.25

As is clear from the review of significant milestones over the course of the
last half-century, international discourse and actions aimed at uprooting the es-
sential causes of gender-based violence and discrimination have tended to be
centered on international law and human rights and on the transformation of
institutions. The underlying assumption appears to be that, when the national
and international legal instruments necessary for securing gender equality and
for protecting women’s rights have been fashioned and applied, gender-based
discrimination and abuse will find an inhospitable environment and will gradu-
ally disappear.

As vital as legal and human-rights measures are, they are insufficient to ef-
fect the magnitude of change necessary. Inasmuch as the various forms of vio-
lence perpetrated against women and girls in the privacy of the home and under
the eye of the State are sustained by long-standing cultural and psychosocial
conventions, legal strategies that are not accompanied by efforts to address the
intra-personal dimensions of the problem are likely to prove ineffective. More
specifically, as long as human beings, collectively and individually, fail to un-
derstand the essential roots of violence, as long as they remain morally, spiri-
tually, and psychologically underdeveloped, they will tend to allow the
perpetration of violence-related cultural norms and meanings regardless of
the rule of law. Indeed, unless cultural norms and outworn modes of thinking
receive sustained attention, legal and human-rights measures, however vital
they may be, will prove to be insufficient. A global campaign to elevate the

status of women, to promote gender equality, and to eradicate gender-based
violence must be fueled and upheld not only by enforceable local and interna-
tional laws but also by educational processes that address the inner terrain of
human consciousness, human values, and human spiritual and moral develop-
ment.

Moreover, even in countries that uphold the rule of law, as legal theorist
and researcher Amede Obiora suggests, the impact of the broad legal culture
on the persistence of gender-based discrimination and violence cannot be over-
looked. The term “legal culture” has been described as “the network of values
and attitudes which determine why, when, where and how people employ le-
gal structures and why legal rules work or do not work.” It is, according to
Obiora, “the legal culture that provides the impetus for the use, abuse, or avoid-
ance of the law.”26 If the legal culture of a nation is not oriented toward the
advancement and protection of women, a proliferation of laws, however much
needed, will not remedy gender-based violence and discrimination.

There are at least three dimensions to a legal culture—the outer form, or
legal structure of a community; the inner form, or the philosophical principles
that animate that structure; and the actors within a community who embody in
their deeds the degree of commitment they have to the principles that animate
their legal and/or social system. The outer aspect of a legal culture is utilitar-
ian and has to do with mechanisms designed to facilitate applying a community’s
constitution and/or body of laws. The inner aspect is abstract and has to do with
metaphysical principles that the laws of a community are designed to embody,
protect, and advance. Thus, more than the facilitation of order and social pro-
cesses, the desire to promote such metaphysical values as justice, equality, hu-
man nobility, and truth are the implicit or explicit goals that buttress most
non-totalitarian legal systems. Indeed, even in contemporary western cultures
where law is presumed to be merely utilitarian or functional, the strength of
the law rests, to no insignificant degree, on its ability to evoke a sense of
respect, and sometimes even reverence, for the legitimacy of the social order
that the law is designed to protect.

A people’s awareness of and appreciation for the underlying metaphysical
values that serve as the foundation of law give a legal culture its enduring
strength and render a legal system more than “a mere code of laws.”27 In the
absence of a concern for the metaphysical values, laws are powerless to pro-
tect against human and civil-rights abuses. Harold Berman, one of the world’s
foremost legal historians, notes that, in the final analysis, what empowers law is
the “deeply or passionately held conviction that law is not only an instrument of
secular policy but also part of the ultimate purpose of life.”28 Thus, underlying
the failure of nations, communities, and families to protect and advance the

rights of women and girls and to protect them against gender-based violence
are not only legal and human-rights standards that leave women vulnerable but
also maladaptive values, attitudes and patterns of behavior that require atten-
tion. It is for this reason that in the global effort to eradicate gender-based
violence, exploitation and abuse, the much-neglected body of world literature
concerned with moral refinement and self-mastery deserves renewed consid-
eration.

Self-Mastery

As has been noted throughout the ages, no effort to eradicate violence and
abuse within a society can be successful without giving due consideration to the
challenges of moral growth and self-mastery. Notwithstanding the violence and
abuse carried out in the names of the world’s spiritual traditions, most of these
have linked the preservation of human rights, honor, and dignity to the control
and/or proper expression of aggression and desire. Islam, for example, en-
courages the followers of Muhammad to engage in jihad, or “holy war.” While
jihad is frequently invoked to justify acts of terrorism and violence, the jihad
spoken of in the Koran may also be understood as a call to the holy war to
conquer one’s self. One who engages in jihad seeks to achieve a state of inner
purity and self-control. Commenting on this fact, the Islamic Sufi mystic Bawa
Muhaiyaddeen observed: “For man to raise his sword against man, for man to
kill man, is not holy war. True holy war is to…cut away the enemies of truth
within our own hearts. We must cast out all that is evil within us, all that op-
poses God. This is the war we must fight.”29 The Bahá’í scriptures also explain
that the Cause of God “belongeth not to the material world. It cometh neither
for strife nor war, nor for acts of mischief or of shame; it is neither for quarrel-
ling with other Faiths, nor for conflicts with the nations. Its only army is the
love of God, … its only battle the expounding of the Truth; its one crusade is
against the insistent self, the evil promptings of the human heart.”30 Similar
guidance on conquering the self may be found in Judaism, Hinduism, Christian-
ity, African spiritual beliefs, the Zoroastrian Faith, Buddhism, and so on.

Although self-mastery need bear no relationship to the self-denying, self-
righteous, or puritanical spirit that often masquerades in its name, it does re-
quire that constant attention be given to developing those human qualities that
may come forth through training and significant effort. For example, inasmuch
as compassion is an antidote to exploitation and abuse, many spiritual traditions
of the world continually exhort their followers to cultivate it. Expressing the
sublime longing of the soul for the quality of compassion, the Buddhist poet-
saint Shantideva pleads:

May I be a balm to the sick, their healer and servitor until sickness come never again;

May I quench with rains of food and drink the anguish of hunger and thirst;

May I be in the famine of the age’s end their drink and meat;

> May I become an unfailing store for the poor, and serve them with manifold things for their
> need.

> My own being and my pleasures, all my righteousness in the past, present and future, I
> surrender indifferently,
> That all creatures may win their way to their end.31

At the core of a spiritual perspective is not ideology but a heartfelt sense of
self-transcendent values, an acute awareness of what is sacred in life, and the
capacity to translate such an awareness into one’s relationships with others. More
than anything else, it is the longing to protect and cultivate that which is sa-
cred—both within oneself and within others—that induces the desire for self-
mastery. When this desire is awakened, individual behavior is conditioned,
not so much by ideology, the force of law, or by the threat of punishment as by
a deep appreciation of the beauty inherent in what the Buddha referred to as
right action.

Addressing the Millennium Peace Summit of Religious and Spiritual Lead-
ers, held at the United Nations on 28—31 August 2000, Albert Lincoln, the
Secretary-General of the Bahá’í International Community, put a turn-of-the-mil-
lennium face on the results of traditional education and appealed to the as-
sembled delegates, on behalf of the world’s children, for moral and spiritual
education:

> Looking beyond immediate crises and conflicts, one of the greatest dangers facing man-
> kind comes from a generation of children growing up in a moral vacuum. Our hearts go out
> to the child-soldiers of Africa, the child-prostitutes of Asia and the desperate scavengers
> of the world’s countless slums and refugee camps, victims of poverty which is both spiri-
> tual and material. But we must not forget the millions of young people growing up in
> societies whose traditional value systems lie in ruins, or those deprived of spiritual training
> by generations of dogmatically materialistic education. And lest we oversimplify the causes
> or the remedies, let us also call to mind the young products of permissive liberalism in the
> West, some of whom are as well-armed and violence-prone as their age-mates in less
> prosperous lands. Each child is potentially the light of the world, and its darkness. Lighting
> the lamps of these souls is a responsibility we must collectively assume if civilization is to
> thrive. Children must not be deprived of the light of moral education, especially the girl

> child, who is the transmitter of values to future generations. Indeed, educated women are
> the most important keys to world peace.32

Development of the “inner life and private character” has long been under-
stood as critical to the civilizing process.33 In The Nicomachean Ethics Aristotle
avers: “the end of political science is the supreme good; and political science
is concerned with nothing so much as with producing a certain character in the
citizens or in other words with making them good, and capable of performing
noble actions.”34 Such notions are not limited to the Western liberal tradition.
In the East the Buddha promoted a system of moral education based upon the
“eightfold path.” His teachings affirm that, until right knowledge, right aspira-
tion, right speech, right behavior, right livelihood, right effort, right mindful-
ness, and right absorption characterize the inner and outer life, neither the
person nor the society can be well-ordered. In the Great Learning, a book
written by the Chinese sage Confucius, the preservation and the development
of the empire are both linked to the moral refinement and development of the
individual:

> The ancients who wished to illustrate illustrious virtue throughout the empire, first ordered
> well their own States. Wishing to order well their States, they first regulated their families.
> Wishing to regulate their families, they first cultivated their persons. Wishing to cultivate
> their persons, they first rectified their hearts. Wishing to rectify their hearts, they first
> sought to be sincere in their thoughts. Wishing to be sincere in their thoughts, they first
> extended to the utmost their knowledge. Such extension of knowledge lay in the investi-
> gation of things.35

Likewise, Christianity, a moral and spiritual philosophy that embraces the
globe, teaches that “man cannot live by bread alone” and that the refinement of
human character is indispensable to the life and health of a community. We find
similar assertions in all the world’s major faiths. There is thus some transcultural
basis for giving consideration to the moral and spiritual dimensions of human
rights abuses.

The Authenticity Group

The International Moral Education Project, also known as the “Authenticity
Group,” is an international team working on the development of materials that
might frame a global approach to moral and spiritual development. Founded by
the Bahá’í-inspired mathematician and philosopher, William S. Hatcher, the Au-

thenticity Group grounds its approach to moral development in the assumption
that the highest values that a civilization can promote are the cultivation of
human consciousness and the development of authentic human relationships.
All other values, they suggest, should be evaluated in light of the extent to
which they are in harmony with these overarching goals.

Moral education, according to the Authenticity Group, is concerned, first
with understanding the nature of value, and second, with applying this under-
standing in one’s relationships with others. There are two types of value: intrin-
sic value, which arises from the inherent properties and capacities of an entity;
and extrinsic value, which is ascribed to an entity through subjective prefer-
ences and social conventions. An example of the latter is the value generally
ascribed to money. Although little more than ink on paper and although highly
ephemeral, money derives a great deal of value by social agreement. Its value
is thus extrinsic to its inherent qualities and nature. Things of intrinsic value, by
contrast, derive their value, not by social agreement, but from the inherent
qualities and potentialities of the entity in question. The sun is of value irre-
spective of any individual’s opinion about it. Its value is inherent in the fact that
it is the primary source of light and warmth in our biosphere and is thus a sine
qua non for life and development in the natural world.

Similarly, the human person is of inherent value. The value of the human
person is inherent in the facts that persons represent the fruit and arrowhead of
evolution on earth and that the maintenance and advancement of civilization—in
all of its forms—depends upon the cultivation of persons. The protection and
development of this value is the supreme objective of any legitimate social
order. Any system of government, any set of laws, any ideology or cultural
practice that unduly jeopardizes the realization of the inherent potential of a
human being is in violation of that person’s inalienable right to become. Such a
society has betrayed its legitimate raison d’être.

According to the Authenticity Group, true morality consists in apprehending
the inherent value of the self and others, and in living in relationship in such a
way as to afford the development and expression of humanity’s full potential.
The creation of the capacities necessary for authentic relationships is the ob-
jective that fuels the work of the Authenticity Group.

The signs of authenticity in relationships are said to be the practice of jus-
tice and the presence of self-sacrificing love. Nonauthentic relationships, by
contrast, are characterized by conflict, disharmony, manipulation, cruelty, jeal-
ousy, and so forth. “Altruistic love,” the Group writes, “is not just a feeling of
emotional warmth towards others, but is an objective, attractive force that oper-
ates according to certain objective laws and principles. Moral education means

learning these laws and principles so that we become ever more subject to the
force of love in our lives. Morality, then, is the pursuit of authentic relationships
or, stated more fully, the process of developing our innate capacity to sustain au-
thentic relationships.” The Authenticity Group illustrates this unique perspective
with an analogy from physics:

> Current physical theory has discovered four fundamental forces. The force of gravity and
> the strong nuclear force are purely attractive forces. The weak nuclear force, however, is
> a purely repulsive force: it has no (currently known) attractive form. Finally, electromag-
> netic force has both an attractive and a repulsive form. Now [we] affirm that altruistic love,
> like gravity, is a purely attractive force. True love cannot be the cause of conflict or es-
> trangement between two people any more than the force of gravitational attraction be-
> tween two physical bodies can push them apart.
> Of course, physical bodies can be pulled apart by forces that overcome their mutual
> gravitational attraction. But, whenever we observe two physical bodies moving away from
> each other, we know that such a configuration is occurring in spite of their mutual gravita-
> tional attraction, not because of it. In the same way, whenever we see conflict and dishar-
> mony in human relationships, we know that it is due to some factor other than love.…
> Thus, moral education is the pursuit of relational authenticity by learning the laws that
> govern the action of love and then implementing that knowledge in our relationship with
> others. The moral person is one who has acquired the capacity for genuine love and self-
> sacrifice. He demonstrates this by his integrity and trustworthiness in his relations with
> others, by consistently treating others with genuine kindness and encouragement.… In
> other words, the basics of morality are stark in their simplicity: either a person has ac-
> quired the capacity for self-sacrifice, which he demonstrates through active, humble,
> reliable service towards others, or he has not, in which case his behavior will reflect various
> pathologies of inauthenticity… (such as greed, untrustworthiness, jealousy, self-
> centeredness, coldness, indifference, anger, cruelty).36

Because the acquisition of the capacity for authentic morality requires con-
tinual, often painful self-evaluation, a number of strategies have been devel-
oped throughout history to transform basic morality into something else that
can be more easily achieved. For example, although one of the overarching
goals of religion is to facilitate the achievement of authentic moral relation-
ships, this goal is frequently transmuted in such a way that religion becomes
primarily an ideology. As an ideology, the doctrines of religion become the
supreme value, and morality is conceived as their protection and propagation
by all possible means. Although all religions present a philosophy of life and
teach the belief in certain doctrines and ideas, “authentic religion conceives of
belief in such doctrines, not as an end in itself, but as a means for developing
the capacity for authentic relationships (both with God and with other human
beings).”37 Thus, the error of ideologized religion lies not in seeking to propa-

gate and advance certain doctrines, but rather in exalting these doctrines above
authentic relationships, thereby interchanging means and ends:

> We will use the term ideology to designate any philosophy which holds that certain doc-
> trines, ideas, or propositions are more important than human beings. Thus defined, any
> ideology (irrespective of what its specific doctrinal content may be) contradicts the basic
> assumption of authentic religion, which holds that (while God may be the Supreme Value
> in Existence) the human being is the supreme value in creation. Moreover, any moral
> system holds that lesser values may be sacrificed to obtain greater values. An ideology
> thus sanctions (at least implicitly) the deliberate sacrifice of human beings, or of authentic
> human relationships, if it is deemed necessary for the propagation of the doctrines of that
> ideology. In regarding its doctrines as more important than human beings, an ideology
> considers these doctrines as God—as the supreme value in existence. Ideology is thus
> idolatry. It is the worship of certain ideas.38

As it is with ideology, culture-specific values and traditions are also fre-
quently invoked in support of the continuation of practices that may be harmful
to the equal participation, development, and/or well-being of subgroups such
as women and girls within a culture. The continuation of such practices is in-
spired by the belief that cultural values are the only ultimate values and that
these values are necessarily local and accidental, rather than intrinsic and uni-
versal. Inasmuch as this perspective renders all cultural values fundamentally
equivalent, the argument is that each cultural group must be left free from out-
side interference in deciding the values that should animate community life.

Legitimate as is the concern for preserving a people’s right to determine
the nature and course of their own lives, the work of the Authenticity Group
assumes that there are also intrinsic, universal values that derive from the uni-
versal nature and needs of all human beings—irrespective of race, culture, or
historical time period. The global community is said to have a moral responsi-
bility to safeguard these values, even when the parties concerned would pre-
fer to operate free from external influence. To do otherwise would be to
render the preservation of culture the supreme value, irrespective of the im-
pact of culture-specific practices on the lives of human beings. The articulation
of an international body of laws designed to preserve human rights is an ex-
plicit rejection of the assumption of absolute cultural relativity by the commu-
nity of nations. At the same time, inasmuch as the adoption of a universal set of
moral values on the local level is not likely to be realized unless large seg-
ments of the population are persuaded of their logic and need, the promotion
of such values depends upon processes of education and persuasion. The Au-

thenticity Group is in the process of developing and testing a variety of mate-
rials that might achieve these objectives.

Reflections on The Nature of Moral Education

An approach to moral education that nurtures in children and youth a hunger
for moral and spiritual growth, while also developing morally relevant capaci-
ties is likely to be more effective in eliminating the root cause of abuses of
power in the family, the community, and the State than are approaches that focus
only on transmitting moral lessons or rules. As has been suggested, what is
needed is the development of an inner agent of self-control that encourages
right action because of its own inherent beauty. Iraj Ayman, a scholar specializ-
ing in moral philosophy, refers to this capacity as the capacity for “spiritual
discernment.”39 According to educator Irene Taafaki, developing spiritual dis-
cernment requires that institutions around the world promote moral growth.
The role of educators is to use a variety of processes to nurture children and
youth to go beyond knowing what constitutes moral ideas to developing moral
insight and practicing moral behavior, the goal being to develop moral wisdom,
rather than a rote following of rules. Moral wisdom then becomes the “inner
lens” through which children are both able to discern what is right and are able
to do those things that enhance the well-being of their own self and others.40

A pedagogy of moral education, notes Taafaki, would include active learn-
ing rather than the passive inculcation of moral lessons; a loving and encourag-
ing environment wherein educators demonstrate in their own lives the qualities
they wish to teach; using the arts, literature, and folklore from the various cul-
tural and religious communities around the world; and cooperative learning
exercises that enable children and young people of diverse backgrounds to
work together in exploring and resolving a range of socially and morally rel-
evant problems. The promotion of a spirit of service to humanity is an integral
part of the pedagogy of moral education. Such service enables children and
youth to enhance their understanding of the relevance of moral behavior for
the development and solidarity of family and community, and for the cultivation
of a sense of “at-oneness” with others.41

In its recent commentary, The Prosperity of Humankind, the Bahá’í Interna-
tional Community notes:

> To an extent unimaginable a decade ago, the ideal of world peace is taking on form and
> substance. Obstacles that long seemed immovable have collapsed in humanity’s path;
> apparently irreconcilable conflicts have begun to surrender to processes of consultation

> and resolution; a willingness to counter military aggression through unified international
> action is emerging. The effect has been to awaken in both the masses of humanity and
> many world leaders a degree of hopefulness about the future of our planet that had been
> nearly extinguished.42

The Bahá’í International Community goes further to note that immense intel-
lectual and spiritual energies are seeking expression throughout the world
and that “[e]verywhere the signs multiply that the earth’s people yearn for an
end to conflict and to the suffering and ruin from which no land is any longer
immune. These rising impulses for change must be seized upon and channeled
into overcoming the remaining barriers that block realization of the age-old
dream of global peace.”43 It may be reasonably argued that few barriers to
peace stand so strongly as does the global problem of gender-based violence.
Over the course of the foregoing century, legal and human-rights advocates
have been mobilized effectively in the global campaign to eradicate it. The
bevy of international laws, conventions, declarations, and resolutions articu-
lated over the last half century in particular attest to the importance of the legal
victories achieved in advancing women’s human rights. What is needed now is
an awakening and mobilization of humanity’s hunger for moral and spiritual
refinement. When these inner dimensions of human life receive the same at-
tention that has been thus far accorded the outer legal dimensions, a context
will be created in which the eradication of gender-based abuses and the ad-
vancement of women and girls in all fields of human endeavor will be finally
realized.
