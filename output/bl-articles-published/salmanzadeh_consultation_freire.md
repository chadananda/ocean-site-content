History and meaning of development

Development as a practice and as an intellectual concept has become a
significant feature in many parts of the world for many decades, and over
time it has carried very different meanings. The meaning of „development‟
that is most related to this dissertation dates from the post war era of modern
development thinking. According to Pieterse2 in modern development, the
core meaning of development was economic growth through Western
aspirations such as mechanization and industrialisation, which was later
broadened to encompass the advancement of social, economic and political
modernisation. Around this period, so-called developed nations believed
that it is only through material advancement (industrialisation and
urbanisation) that social, cultural and political progress can be achieved, and
that capital investment was the key to economic growth and development3
It was also then that many developed nations believed in the importance of
advancing the role of modernisation as an effective way of dealing with the
so-called social, cultural, and political backwardness of the nations that they
come to regard as „Third World”.

In January 20, 1949 US president Truman seized the moment as one of the
powerful leaders of the First World by asserting the importance of the US in
aiding the economic progress of the world:

> “We must embark on a bold new program for making the benefits of
> our scientific advances and industrial progress available for the
> improvement and growth of underdevelopment areas. The old
> imperialism- exploitation for foreign profit – has no place in our

> concepts of democratic fair dealing”4

However, the motivations for the introduction of „development‟ as a global
project and the introduction of the notion of “underdeveloped‟ has been
widely criticised by intellectuals such as Gustavo Esteva, who makes the
following powerful statement:

> “Underdevelopment began, then, on January 20, 1949. On that day,
> two billion people became underdeveloped. In a real sense, from that
> time on, they ceased being what they were, in all their diversity, and
> were transmogrified into an inverted mirror of others‟ reality: a
> mirror that defines their identity … simply in the terms of a
> homogenizing and narrow minority”5

According to McMichael6 this historical proclamation divided the humanity
into the “developed” and the “underdeveloped” regions. This became a new
way of looking at the world where so-called modern became the standard
that all the societies of the world were measured and judged. Furthermore
this became a new paradigm for producing a strategy to improve the
conditions of the Third World, mentioned before came to be known as the
development project. This strategy by the First World assumed that firstly,
no matter how diverse those “underdeveloped” nations where, they were
viewed in a similar way and that the western experience became the
universal model for their development. Secondly, the Third World nations
were seen as being only at the early stages of a universal path to modern
society.

At this period, underdeveloped nations were seen trapped in a cycle of
poverty and lacking the capital to achieve economic growth. To achieve this
material success, international supports such as foreign aid, technology
transfer, stable currency exchange and robust international trade became an
essential part of the development project. To accommodate these necessary
supports and funds United States spearheaded two initiatives to reconstruct
the world economy: the Marshall Plan and the Bretton Woods program 7.As
the result of these initiatives the “ twin sisters” of World Bank and the
International Monetary Fund (IMF) were established, to stabilize national
finances and economic growth by funding the Third World, among others.

The following statement expressed at the 1944 Bretton Woods conference
offered invaluable evidence, for the types of attitudes that supported the
aims of development project for peace and free trade as a whole:

For freedom of opportunity is the foundation for all other freedom”8

Moreover, on delivering the “Resolution of Thanks” at the conference, the
Brazilian delegate, Souza Costa, proclaimed that the Bretton Woods
institutions were “inspired by a single ideal - that happiness be distributed
throughout the face of the earth”9 Overall, these became the key sentiments
of the development project: multinational universalism, viewing natural
bounty as unlimited, and a liberal belief in freedom of opportunity as the
basis of political development and human satisfaction was linked to rising
living standards 10

Later as a direct outcome of those development initiatives and institutions,
many newly independent states were turned into financially dependent
states. It was at this point around the 1960‟s that the dependency school of
thought began to expose the unequal economic relationships of aid, trade,
and investment between First and Third World nations. According to
Pieterse11 dependency theory acknowledged that the core meaning of
development was economic growth, under the heading of accumulation,
which was a distorted form of dependent accumulation that led to the
development of underdevelopment. Well-known dependency theorists like
A.G. Frank criticised development thinking for denying the historical
relationship between development and underdevelopment. Frank12 argued
that „if the now underdeveloped were really to follow the stages of growth
of the now developed ones, they would have to find still other peoples to
exploit into underdevelopment, as the now developed countries did before
them‟.

Dependency theory with its unique critique of development further
established a platform for new reflections and strategies that contributed to
the emergence of „alternative development‟ and „human development‟.
From the 1970‟s to the end of the 1980‟s alternative and human
development thinking offered new understanding and approaches on
development that mainly focused on issues regarding social and community
development. According to Pieterse13 these new development paradigms

tended to be practice-oriented rather than theoretically inclined, and aimed
to create a people-centred development model that valued equity,
participation and sustainability.

The emergence of these new people-centred and action-oriented
development paradigms offers the most relevant context for the central topic
of this paper, discussed below. However it would be appropriate in this
historical overview to briefly discuss the emergence of radically different
development schools of „neo-liberalism‟ and „post-development‟ in the late
1980‟s and 1990‟s. According to Pieterse14 neo-liberalism introduced the
return to the neoclassical economics model of economic growth, to be
achieved through structural reform, privatisation and deregulation. In this
approach development as a source of economic growth remains the central
goal and the market replaces the state as the agent of achieving this goal.
Pieterse further adds that the neo-liberalist approach can be regraded as anti-
development in terms of its emphasis on the power of the market for
achieving economic growth.

In the 1990‟s post-development thinkers also put forth an anti-development
position. Post-development scholars such as Tucker15, Rist16 and Escobar17 ,
began to question the whole nature and the validity of development. Vincent
Tucker18 refers to the “Myth of Development” and criticises its application
as a natural law and a necessity that has been forced on millions upon
millions of human beings by “developed” nations. Furthermore, he strongly
views development as „the process whereby other peoples are dominated
and their destinies are shaped according to an essentially Western way of
conceiving and perceiving the world‟. Similarly, Rist19 affirms that
development is not a natural process or a transcultural concept that can be
simply transplanted to “developing” nations without a careful consideration
of peoples‟ needs, histories and aspirations. Rist further argues that it is for
this very reason that despite all kinds of Western technological or
economical advancements, these accomplishments of the West cannot be
replicated in Third World countries. Some have argued that this attempted
replication of First World socio-economic accomplishments has come to
control the destinies of Third World nations and directly or indirectly began
to influence their social and cultural values and meaning systems 20

Furthermore, Tucker21 recognises this type of control as being a central
issue in development discourse, and questions whether these
accomplishments as well as Western values should be replicated or imposed
on those nations in the name of „development‟. Likewise which traditional
values and practices must be abandoned and which retained to make way for
development and modernisation. These questions are only some of those
asked by critical development theorists to challenge the myth of
development.

Does this imply that there is no need for nations, developed or
underdeveloped, to assist one another as inhabitants of one planet? Post-
development thinkers like Escobar22, Tucker23 and McMichael24 have
suggested that the West should abandon the concept of development as a
means for legitimising the oppression and domination of many nations.
Hegemonical development discourse has failed to acknowledge other forms
of rationality and ways of life that have existed before the introduction of
modernisation. There is an urgent need to rethink the notion of development
by addressing these destructive and dehumanising practices that have
resulted in unhealthy inequalities of power. Tucker25 sees this inequality of
power at the heart of the problem of development, where modernisation and
dependency discourses have „reduced the subjects of development to
passive objects‟.

Today development is no longer divided between mainstream (based on
economic growth) and alternative (based on increasing of people‟s choices
and human capacitation). According to Pieterse26, there is now a
considerable overlap between mainstream and alternative development,
especially in relation to their approach in defining and conceptualising
development in terms of participation, working with the poor and vulnerable
groups, and emphasis on local action. She further acknowledges that these
overlapping ideologies and practices with their particular emphasis on
peoples basic needs (health, literacy, education and housing), are giving
people-centred development a more mainstream position in recent years.
Overall, development is not what it used to be and it is in a constant state of
flux, with development practice, policy and studies rapidly flourishing and
universities establishing development schools more than ever before.

The alternative development paradigm
As mentioned by Pieterse27 alternative development since its inceptions in
the 1970‟s has introduced alternative practices and redefining goals of
development. Its significant contribution has mainly been in the areas of

local and grassroots development. Alternative development is often
identified with development-by-NGOs28, however it can be further
distinguished with respect to its development notions of participation and
self-reliance aimed at achieving basic needs. Also according to Pieterse29
and Korten30, in alternative development the state has an important role in
being a facilitator of people‟s self-development, complemented by business
and other voluntary agencies. For example as mentioned in Pieterse31 the
Thailand Five Star Partnership programme integrates the efforts of
government, NGO‟s, private sector, religious communities and academic
institutions to facilitate local and grassroots development.

In recent years, alternative development has been regarded as a paradigm
that values equity, participation and sustainability32. Alternative
development thinkers such as Rahman33 unlike post-development thinkers
disapprove of abandoning development, as he regards the word
“development” to be a very powerful means of expressing peoples
creativity. He further argues that we must not abandon valuable words
because they are abused: what do we do then with words like democracy
and socialism, which have also been abused? However as Korten34 has
argued it is important to redefine development in relation to its benefits to
developing societies:

> “ Development is a process by which the members of a society
> increase their personal and institutional capacities to mobilize and
> manage resources to produce sustainable and justly distributed
> improvements in their quality of life consistent with their own
> aspirations”35

One of the ways such definition of development becomes realised has been
through the practical concept of „mobilisation‟ in the Participatory Action
Research (PAR) movement. Rahman36 regards mobilisation as a process
where by people are emotionally stimulated, in the sense of generating inner
urges for collective activity, an inner urge being defined as an urge that
arises from one‟s own consciousness to achieve emotional fulfilment.
Hefurther emphasis that mobilisation requires the following:

Firstly, that people have a sense of owning the means of production and a
sense of being the agents of decision-making. Secondly, they must have a
sense of positive purpose in the exercise of ownership and decision-making.
Thirdly, above all they must achieve self-reliance, that can be defined as a
state of mind that regards one‟s own mental and material resources as the
primary source of achieving one‟s collective objectives and emotional
fulfilment.

In relation to the aims of this study it would be relevant to place a particular
emphasis on what Anisur Rahman37 calls „people‟s self-development‟. In his
informative book with the same title Rahman comprehensively discusses
PAR as a significant movement within the field of alternative development.
This book presents Rahman‟s reflection on development through collective
grass-roots initiatives by people themselves. His intellectual and practical
involvement in grassroots, people led development, experimentation with
participatory research, and his experience in the field of „animation‟ is
invaluable to the field of alternative development.

Furthermore, the PAR group decision-making practice of „animation‟ has
been a significant feature of this movement, which according to Rahman38
aims to stimulate unprivileged people to regard themselves as the principal
actors in the development of their communities and to develop a critical
understanding of their conditions and to express and assert themselves
through collective action. In this decision-making process a significant
emphasis is placed on enabling people to get collectively engaged in seeking
creative solutions to their problems. This collective inquiry of people in to
their circumstances must be further complemented by collective action. As
Tilakaratna39 has observed:

> “People operate as animated subjects when they are able to
> investigate, critically reflect on and analyse the social reality on their
> own, perceive self-possibilities for change, take initiatives and
> engage in critical review of their ongoing actions as a regular
> practice. The role of animation is therefore to assist the people to
> build up the above capacities, and a knowledge base to think and act
> creatively to transform their realities”.

Animation further requires „facilitation‟ for it to be systemically possible.
Rahman40 explains that facilitation is needed for the acquisition of basic
skills such as literacy and management skills, for effective operation of
organizations and collective undertakings. Through facilitation people are
also encouraged to develop contact with development agencies and

institutions for funding and support. It is important to mention that this
process is initially introduced to a group by an animator, which has the
responsibility of stimulating people and advancing their knowledge for
collective inquiry and decision-making.

Furthermore, alternative development involves a social and political process
of „empowerment‟ that aims to rebalance the structure of power through
greater participation. According to Oakley41, „power-formal, traditional, or
informal lies in the heart of any process of change and is the fundamental
dynamics that determines social and economic relations‟. Empowerment is
concerned with the recognition of people‟s capacities to take action and to
play an active role in development initiatives. Empowerment is an
intentional and ongoing dynamic process centred on the local community,
involving mutual dignity, critical reflection, caring and group participation,
through the exercise of an increased leverage on power42. Overall, according
to Oakley43 , empowerment requires the full participation of people in every
step of the decision-making processes of: formulation, implementation and
evaluation for the well being of the society to be achieved.

In relation to the main topic of this paper, people‟s participations in
decision-making has been recognised as one of the main features of
empowerment. Alternative development authors such as Friedman44,
Galjart45, Stiefel and Wolfe46 think of development as ‘participation in
decision-making’ in matters to the target group. According to Oakley47 , this
expression of empowerment is significant when it comes to capturing the
basic element of „power‟: the power of decision-making. Empowerment
assists the subjects of development, who normally are, or have been
excluded from decision-making to be come „self empowered‟48. In this
sense decision-making becomes central in exercising one‟s power to
influence change in a developing community in a social-political context.

The significance of decision-making has been discussed above in relation to
a number of concepts in alternative development thinking. However, when it
comes to the practical application of decision-making, alternative
development does not offer enough methodologies and principles to guide
the participants in the decision-making process. This paper aims to offer
and discuss two possible alternative group decision-making methods in the

context of development theory and practice: Bahá‟í consultation, and Paulo
Freire‟s notion of dialogue.

The Bahá’í consultation model

According to Wendi Momen49 the Bahá‟í Faith acknowledges that the
social, political, economic and spiritual capacity of people around the world
is advancing, as the scope of human‟s sense of loyalty to a group is
broadening from family to clan, tribe, city-state, nation and ultimately to the
recognition of the oneness of humanity. Bahá‟u‟llah‟s foundational principle
of the oneness of humankind is articulated in terms of unity in diversity,
peace, justice, and brotherhood among all the peoples of the earth regardless
of religion, nationhood, race or class. This implies, according to the Bahá‟í
writings, “an organic change in the structure of present day society, a change
such as the world has not yet experienced.”50. To achieve these aspirations,
Bahá‟u‟llah advances a series of spiritual, moral, and social guidelines for
human development, one of which involves the decision-making system of
consultation.

Bahá‟í consultation advocates dialogue between individuals and within
groups as the ideal method of clear decision-making. Consultation is
encouraged in personal, family and community decisions51. Bahá‟í
consultation is put forward in the Bahá‟í writings as a method for problem-
solving and decision-making, and a contributor to the well being of the
group which through its processes enables its maturity and understanding to
manifest52. In this communicative process; true understanding materialises
when all the different views regarding a matter are courteously but candidly
expressed by everyone who would like to contribute to the discussion. This
level of openness to considering multiple views allows for a greater and
more holistic understanding of a subject matter. According to Bahá‟u‟llah,
„consultation is the lamp of guidance which leadeth the way, and is the
bestower of understanding‟ 53. Bahá‟í consultation is seen as a powerful
process that can only be discovered gradually through practice and
reflection. It is regarded as significant in its potential to transcend the more
hierarchical decision-making processes of the institutions of church and
state. The Bahá‟í Faith has no clergy and the entire administrative body of
the Bahá‟í Faith locally, nationally and internationally is elected by all adult
members of its community. Authority is vested solely in collective
consultative bodies where individuals have no decision-making power54.

Bahá‟í consultation is aimed to advance beyond the arena of limited interest,
replacing brute force and contending vested interests with a spiritually
engaged participatory process, while ideally enabling human beings to
graduate from divisive partisan politics55

The most significant purpose of Bahá‟í consultation is the “investigation of
truth”56. This search for truth according to the Bahá‟í writings has universal
application. Whether it is used for administrative purposes or purely
personal matters, consultation is a process of achieving “insight into
things”57 and a method of establishing greater awareness in the spirit of
“unity in diversity”. Consultation entails both joint consideration and
allowing an idea to grow. Once an idea is put forward by an individual as a
contribution to the search for truth, it is considered as belonging to the
group. At the same time, regardless of its propounder or the apparent
quality of the idea, the group is urged to consider its possible relevance and
value and consult on whether it needs implementation, further growth,
considered dismissal or postponement for future consultation. This process
is designed to ensure that every idea or recommendation is treated with
justice and fairness regardless of the position and background of the
individual. Bahá‟í consultation is thus a multi-dimensional concept that
respects and combines the experiences, knowledge, minds, hearts, feelings,
hopes and fears of the participants. For this reason consultation can initially
be somewhat complex and challenging for individuals inexperienced in its
dynamics, and it is through committed self-inquiry and personal observation
that one‟s quality of participation can increase.

In Bahá‟í consultative bodies of the Bahá‟í Faith, a chairperson is elected to
facilitate the consultative process and ensure that each member is provided
with the opportunity to contribute to the discussions. Overall, the teachings
of the Bahá‟í Faith emphasises collective leadership and through the process
of consultation the decision-making power of the elected group should be
realised and utilised. The group should welcome the views of all, including
“the most lowly, untutored and inexperienced”58 In this forum, decision-
making is dialectically structured by differences of opinions and “through
the clash of personal opinions the spark of truth is often ignited”59.

Bahá‟ís are encouraged to come to terms with this challenging decision-
making process in the recognition that consultation is not an easy matter,
because of the imperfect individual behaviours, attitudes and orientations
we bring to this consultative process. Bahá‟í consultation is therefore not
merely a mechanical process or a specific methodology, but a journey of
personal maturation in which success will also depend on the qualities of

one‟s character and personal conduct. Consultation requires therefore
constant examination of one‟s motives and conscious adjustment of one‟s
behaviour60 Sinclair suggests that these real dilemmas and conflicts
challenge individuals to mature over time, engendering a process of spiritual
transformation.

The Bahá‟í writings regard the domain of consultation as a “spiritual
conference” and “not the mere voicing of personal views”61. In such a
conference, the participants are urged to detach themselves from their
opinion and “set it forth as a contribution to the consensus of opinion”.
„Abdu‟l-Bahá62 encourages the participants through a “spiritual conference”
to evaluate their personal opinions with utmost “serenity, calmness and
composure”. By controlling one‟s emotional attachment to an opinion the
individual is able to consider the worth and the truth of the opinions that
have already been expressed; therefore they are able to willingly modify
their stance. In such situations, one‟s detachment and clarity enables one to
allow the consultation process to arrive at unity and truth. “Therefore true
consultation is a spiritual conference in the attitude and atmosphere that
good results may be forthcoming. Love and fellowship are the foundation”63

Bahá‟ís are urged to approach all collective matters in “the spirit of frank
and loving consultation”64. Opinions and ideas must be expressed with “the
utmost devotion, courtesy, dignity, care and moderation”65 Those who
engage in Bahá‟í consultation must “search out the truth and not insist upon
their own opinion, for stubbornness and persistence in one‟s views will lead
ultimately to discord and wrangling and the truth will remain hidden”66 This
involves learning increasingly to reconcile in consultation “the principles of
mercy and justice, of freedom and submission, of the sanctity of the right of
the individual and of self-surrender, of vigilance, discretion and prudence on
the one hand and fellowship, candour and courage on the other67

Above all else, then, Bahá‟í consultation stems from an engaged spirituality:
a state, an inner condition, that should manifest itself in action, in everyday
choices, in a profound understanding of human nature and in meaningful
contributions to community life and society.”68 Such individual cultivation
of spirituality is considered fundamental to collective and united
consultation for the investigation of truth. According to Sinclair69 the act of
consultation is itself sacred and sanctified; first, through the spiritual

outlook each participant brings to the consultation process, secondly
through their prayers and concentrated efforts to manifest spiritual qualities;
finally, dialogue is understood to be facilitated by the power of God and
one‟s reliance on God in all matters. “The prime requisite for them that they
take counsel together,” Bahá‟í writings assert, “are purity of motive,
radiance of spirit, detachment from all else save God, attraction to His
Divine fragrances, humility amongst His loved ones, patience and long-
suffering and servitude.”

Sustained by the spiritual dimension of consultation, then, Bahá‟ís are
encouraged to develop strong cooperation and association to achieve true
happiness and development, individual and collective70. Within this context,
Bahá‟ís become increasingly able to examine any issue from various points
of view, together finding the most suitable direction to embark upon,
consulting until a solution for collective action emerges. Through
consultation, unity of thought is persistently pursued and achieved, and
when the thoughts and views of all participants are united, imaginative plans
for development and growth of any community can be achieved71 (Ruhi,
Book 2, 1985).

Consultation is “no easy skill to learn, requiring as it does the subjugation of
all egoism and unruly passions, the cultivation of frankness and freedom of
thought as well as courtesy, openness of mind, and wholehearted
acquiescence in a majority decision”72 (UHJ, Wellspring, p.96). Certainly, in
this early stage of growth of the Bahá'í community with its wide diversity of
individuals the process of consultation may present itself as a challenge, and
at times the perfect decision may not be a practical possibility73 (Abdu‟l-
Bahá, 1982: 96). However, it is important for the group to remain united in
all stages of the decision making process, especially after the group has
reached its final decision. If the final decision is implemented and it does
not produce the desired out come, the group must reflect and consult on the
matter again in unity and solidarity.

Overall, Vick74 (1989:49) believes Bahá‟í consultation is a method of
human interaction and communication that suits all situations. It is a new
social institution that shapes and develops people and communities. Bahá‟í
consultation is put forward by its proponents as unique and evolutionary, its
full potential and powers only gradually being discovered and developed75
(Kolstoe:1985&1995, Vick:1989). The process of consultation is advanced

A case study of Bahá’í consultation in development practice: Radio for
Development (Ecuador)

Consultation is one of the fundamental features of any Bahá‟í initiated
development project around the world. Below a case study of a bahá‟í
development project is discussed in which Bahá‟í consultation has been
used in practice. It is important at this point to offer a brief explanation of
the Bahá‟í understanding of development. Generally, it has been regarded by
the Bahá‟í Faith as the process of maturation of social institutions together
with an increase in participation of individuals and groups in those
institutions, and improvements in the economic welfare, wealth, standard of
living and material comfort of individuals, groups and whole populations76.

Furthermore, the success of any form of material development is held to be
related to the level of spiritual development. All of the social teachings of
the Bahá‟í Faith, such as universal education, equality of men and women,
the importance of agriculture, etc., are approached from a spiritually
informed perspective in both theory and practice. This fundamentally
spiritual approach to development has been the most significant vehicle for
humanitarian aid and assistance by the members of the Bahá‟í Faith.

In 1977, the Bahá‟ís of Ecuador began the first Bahá‟í radio station. Radio
Bahá‟í of Ecuador was established through consultation between the Bahá‟ís
in the Otavalo region and the National Spiritual Assembly of Ecuador.
According to the Bahá‟í scholar Kurt Hein77 the station was established in
part to promote self-determination and self-reliance among rural populations
by encouraging their participation in the operations of the station. In
particular the Bahá‟ís aimed to offer their services to the spiritual,
administrative, social, and economic of the indigenous population.

The station was licensed as an educational, cultural, and religious
institution. Its aims included:

>     Providing universal education for the general population.
>     Promoting the development of human potential.
    Promoting the unification of humankind into “one universal

family”.
    Assisting in the development and instruction of the Bahá‟í

community in the region.

Momen, Dictionary, 69

Kurt Hein, Radio for Development. World Order, 1987,198(3-4), 39-50.

    Helping raise the listener‟s standard of living without

destroying their values.78

In addition Radio Bahá‟í began serving community organizations through
programming that encouraged participation by all community members,
especially women, and by teaching the principles of Bahá‟í consultation as a
method of community decision making. This was initially to develop and
strengthen consultative skills among the Bahá‟í communities in the region,
later extending its benefits and possible usage to the rest of the community.

Bahá‟í consultation became an important feature of the management and
administration of Radio Bahá‟í, implemented by the Radio Bahá‟í
Commission. According to Hein79, the Commission met weekly to review
programming and personal issues. After consultation between the members
of the station staff and the Executive Director, the decisions and the policies
of the Commission were implemented. By following the principles of
Bahá‟í consultation each staff member had the opportunity to offer ideas for
improving the services of Radio Bahá‟í.

Since its inception Radio Bahá‟í has served the community by producing
many regular programs on agricultural and health issues; public
announcements; regular visits to the villagers to interview the people
concerning rural farming issues, women‟s activities, oral traditions;
indigenous music festivals and local news and information. These programs
have been effective for two reasons. First, the audience needs are addressed
and then the programming is developed to address those needs. Second,
Radio Bahá‟í uses the voices of the villagers and the indigenous people not
only so they can hear themselves but also using radio as a medium to reach
civil servants80

With regards to staff training many visiting consultants offered short-term
courses for those interested in learning to produce their own programs. As
mentioned by Hein for example a number of indigenous women produced
their own programs, although none had any radio experience before coming
to the station. In fact, only one of the women had received any formal
schooling. Nonetheless, after completing some initial courses, they were
teamed up with more experienced staff until they felt comfortable operating
the equipment on their own. As their confidence grew they started to
participate in daily consultation regarding Bahá‟í Radio‟s activities,
especially in relation to indigenous women‟s issues.

In addition, through effective consultation between consultants, the
administrative bodies of the Bahá‟í Faith and volunteers, the station has
continued to fulfil its mandate as a participatory service to the indigenous

community for more than two decades. Radio Bahá‟í of Ecuador has
inspired many other communities around the world to initiate similar
projects, Bahá‟í and non-Bahá‟í.

Freirean notion of dialogue

Paulo Freire has become one of the most influential educationists for nearly
four decades. His work and philosophy have inspired not only educational
workers but also others in the fields of human and social development, in
many developing nations and also in many developed countries. In his most
widely read book, Pedagogy of the Oppressed, he lays the foundations of
some of his most thought provoking concepts such as the notions of,
‟liberation‟, „humanisation‟, „dehumanisation‟, „conscientisation‟, and
„dialogue‟. Many of these concepts were developed while developing and
conducting his revolutionary literacy programs in his home nation of Brazil.
However, after the military coup in 1964, the officials found his educational
activities and teaching philosophies too radical and placed him under house
arrest. He was later asked to leave his country and spent more than two
decades in exile.

With regards to the main theme of this study, the notion of dialogue can be
regarded as a significant contribution of Freirian philosophy. However, we
cannot treat dialogue as an isolated notion, and as a stand-alone contribution
of his philosophy. We must as Roberts81 (1998:33) argues, go beyond his
classic work the Pedagogy of the Oppressed and read Freire holistically. „A
holistic reading allows a more complex picture of both Freirean theory in
general, and the place of Pedagogy of the Oppressed in that theory in
particular, to emerge‟

In another early work, Cultural Action for Freedom82 (1972) Freire
addresses some of the political and developmental issues in the Third World
with specific reference to Latin America. He examines the significant
process of conscientisation, and dialogue as one of its key components. Here
we must also mention that, although the concept of conscentisation has been
directly associated to Freire, he was not the first to use the notion. The
original Portuguese term, „conscientizacao‟, came in to being during a series
of meetings between professors at the Brazilian Institute of Higher Studies,
and later popularised by Helder Camara83

It is appropriate at this point of the study to make an explicit and systematic
analysis of the concept of conscientisation and its relationship to the notion
of dialogue. In his work before the Pedagogy of the Oppressed, Freire refers
to dialogue as “communion” in relation to the project of conscentisation by

of Educational Thought, 1998, 32(2), 95-117 33

P Roberts, Rethinking Conscientization . Journal of Philosophy of Education, 1996, 309(2), 179-196

stating that “only praxis in the context of communion makes conscientsation
a viable project”84 (1972: 46). In this sense conscientisation is a joint project
that takes its form with unity and solidarity between the people through
action and constant reflection upon that action and upon the world. Freire
emphasises that, in order for conscientisation to take place a radical
denunciation of dehumanising structures must occur alongside people
constructing a new reality for themselves. By doing this people come to
openly challenge the oppressive conditions they have been subjected to, and
through dialogue and action take charge of their own progress and
development.

According to Freire, the starting point for the analysis of conscientisation is
to critically comprehend humans as beings who exist in and with the world.
“It is as conscious beings that men are not only in the world, but with the
world, together with other men. Only men, as “open” beings are able to
achieve the complex operation of simultaneously transforming the world by
their action and grasping and expressing the world‟s reality in their creative
language.”85 According to Roberts, “„conscientisation‟ is the reflective
moment which occurs in a liberating educational programme designed to
dialogically address and transform conditions of oppression.”86 .

Freire has often referred to the importance of dialogue and its significant
role in the conscientizacao, or “conscientization”, process87. For example,
with regards to students and their process of becoming conscious and
transformed, dialogue represents a powerful and transformative political
process. It is through dialogical interaction and relationships that students
learn to build strong learning communities in which they can freely
communicate their thoughts and ideas about what they know and also in
relation to the larger political project of emancipation88 Even though in this
example the relationship of dialogue and conscientisation is expressed with
regards to students, the same would apply to other members of a society
who continue to engage in the process of critical consciousness and
liberation. According to Darder89 it is important to understand that a true act
of dialogue needs purposeful focus, particularly, on the process of
developing critical consciousness or transformative social action.

According to Krank and Steiner90, Freirean transformation in relation to
education is based on the active engagement of students as liberatory
learners during their educational experiences and the critical facilitation of
learning. Furthermore this kind of transformation creates liberated learners
whom are actively involved in the humanisation of their individual realities
through subjective reflection, and rational objective action. Individual
transformation further contributes to the collective transformation outside of
the learning environment through active and united participation in
dialogical action and reflection. Taylor91 argues that Freire‟s work
constantly asserts that conscientisation, engendered by dialogue, is the
means of transforming objects into subjects, the oppressed into the liberated.
Taylor goes on to identify five premises that accumulatively provide the
infrastructure of the pedagogy of the oppressed and highlights the liberating
and transformative power of dialogue:

>      The individual deprived of dialogue is oppressed.
>      Dialogue is the process and practice of liberation.
>      The individual engaged in dialogue is liberated.
>      Dialogue, by definition, requires more than one person.

     More than one person could be called a society.

Roberts92 stresses the fact that „dialogue for conscientisation implies a
certain unity of purpose‟ and that this collective effort as human beings
originates from the ontological vocation of humanisation93. This unifying
nature of dialogue and its role as agent of unity is one of the key features of
this study and it will be further discussed in relation to the Bahá‟í model of
consultation.

Freire emphasises the importance of a constant dialectical relationship and
interaction for objective transformation. Further, Freire urges us to approach
this dialectical intervention as a way of verbally explaining to the people
their own action. This form of communication „with‟ the oppressed, rather
than „to‟ the oppressed Freire explicitly relates to the notion of „dialogue‟ in
chapter three of Pedagogy of the Oppressed. However before focusing
further on his notion of dialogue we must reflect on his notions of „action‟
and „reflection‟. As mentioned in the Pedagogy of the Oppressed, for action
to be humanising it must be more than an occupation, a preoccupation,
which must not be separated from reflection. This interdependence of action
and reflection is highly important to the advancement of any liberation
process. For the oppressed to pursue liberation, they must engage with each
other dialogically through a constant process of critical action and
reflection. In this sense liberation is a process of struggle that encourages

people to actively strive to improve their conditions as humans with unity,
and at the same time evaluate and reflect on their achievements through
ongoing communication with each other. Even though Freire did not regard
himself as a member of the oppressed class, as a teacher and a human being
he saw the importance of joining the oppressed with their struggle for
liberation and humanisation, and he encouraged others to do the same.
However, Freire warned people, whether academics or community workers
to avoid the trap of thinking that they are the executers of transformation,
just because they truly want to change injustices in the world.

Turning now to dialogue proper, Freire suggests that our initial attempts to
understand the nature and the meaning of dialogue, involves discovering
something that is the very essence of dialogue itself: it is not simply to view
the word as the instrument to carry out dialogue and its literal role in
constructing speech, but to go deeper and comprehend its constitutive
elements. We must understand that this word contains two important
dimensions of reflection and action, and that both need to interact for
authentic dialogue to emerge 94. In the absence of one of these dimensions
the word becomes unauthentic. When the word is deprived of one of these
dimensions, Freire adds95, the other one suffers; in this sense action without
reflection leads to an activism based on action for action‟s sake that negates
true praxis and makes dialogue impossible. On the other hand reflection
without action leads to verbalism, resulting in verbal reflection as an empty
word or idle chatter with no transformative power. These are both
undesirable outcomes in Freire‟s pedagogy for liberation, humanisation, and
transformation of the oppressed. Overall, dialogue must become the
encounter between human beings, which is essentially mediated by the
world, in order to name the world 96.

Clearly, then, Freirean dialogue requires certain personal qualities to
succeed. Freire has discussed these in Pedagogy of the Oppressed 97, as
essential requirements for dialogue, including love, humility, faith, and
mutual trust, among others.

Freire, regards love as the foundation of dialogue, an act of courage, not of
fear, and an act of commitment to others. Dialogue, cannot exist without a
profound love for the world and humanity as a whole. Dialogue requires
humility, for the dialoguers to be able to name the world in unity and
partnership. In this way everyone‟s dialogical contribution is valuable and
no one can be regarded as ignorant. According to Freire, by having faith in
others the “dialogical man” believes in others before even engaging in
dialogue with them. It is also, by having faith in their power to make and
remake; and in their vocation to become more fully human. This faith,

however, is not naïve, and the dialogical man must be critical, although it is
possible for an individual to have the power to transform, it does not mean
individual dialogical action is in isolation. By achieving these virtues,
dialogue becomes a horizontal relationship of mutual trust between the
dialoguers in a logical sequence.

Dialogue emerges from this discussion as a collective and united interaction
(action and reflection) between the dialoguers, a necessary tool for
transforming and humanising the world. In this pedagogy human existence
is not silent, and no one in this collective struggle is denied his or her right
to speak his or her word. Therefore, dialogue becomes a necessary tool for
achieving significance as human beings and through speaking their word,
through naming their world, they have the power to transform their reality:

> “If it is in their word that people, by naming the world, transform it,
> dialogue imposes itself as the way by which they achieve
> significance as human beings. Dialogue is thus an existential
> necessity”98

Freirean Dialogue and Bahá’í Consultation: A Comparative Analysis

A comparative analysis of Freirean dialogue and Bahá‟í consultation can
begin by understanding their similarities and differences.

The Bahá‟í writings on consultation place significant emphasis on the
importance of developing a number of personal (spiritual) qualities when
taking part in the consultation process. Similarly, in Pedagogy of the
Oppressed and A Response among others Freire stresses the importance of
dialogical qualities and virtues that are necessary for individual and the
group as a whole.

In Bahá‟í consultation, „Abdu‟l-Bahá has emphasised that “the first
condition is absolute love and harmony amongst the members…”99. By
acquiring this condition the consultative body are able to free themselves
from estrangement and antipathy and to care for each other personally100.
Furthermore Bahá‟ís are reminded by Shoghi Effendi, that the keynote of
this Faith is “not arbitrary power, but… loving consultation”. This is a kind
of love that is not simply based on just tolerating one another, but truly
committing ourselves to understanding one another.

In a similar way Freire101, regards love as the foundation for dialogue:
dialogue “cannot exist in the absence of a profound love for the world and
for people”. Indeed, he clearly emphasises that love is dialogue itself and

Paolo Freire, Pedagogy of the City. New York: Continuum 1993, 69

Kolstoe, Consultation, 20

Freire, Oppressed, 70

that only people who love one another are able to enter into this dialogue
with each other. According to Darder102 Freire spoke of a love that is rooted
in commitment to humanity and the willingness to struggle to attain what he
calls our “true vocation” – that of being human. Furthermore, he spoke of a
kind of love that was lively, inspiring but at the same time, challenging and
critical: an “armed love - the fighting love of those convinced of the right
and the duty to fight, to denounce, and to announce”103

Hence, although love as a starting point is shared between the two
perspectives, the notion of love used by Freire is fundamentally different to
the Bahá‟í notion of love. Bahá‟í love is based on the spiritual nature of
human relationships springing from the love of God, whereas Freirean love
is based on a humanistic understanding of people‟s love and commitment to
their fellow humans and to the cause of liberation.

Humility is another crucial requisite of Bahá‟í consultation. Shoghi
Effendi104 urges Bahá‟ís to take counsel together with “humility and
lowliness”. Bahá‟ís are discouraged from self-aggrandisement or self-praise
over their contributions to the consultative process. According to Kolstoe105,
humility is achieved through action and service to humanity and the Bahá‟í
community. Furthermore, he explains that true humility lies in the
development and use of talents, capacities and resources by individuals who
have participated in the consultative process106. In Bahá‟í consultation the
ability to listen to others and take in to consideration the opinion of others is
another significant characteristic of a humble participant and an open-
minded individual.

Freire likewise considers humility a crucial component of humanitarian
dialogue. He sees it as enabling dialoguers to name the world in partnership
to achieve common goals. In this way no one is regarded as ignorant, rather
people as partners attempt together to increase their knowledge and
understanding about their world. Freire explicitly states, “Dialogue cannot
exist without humility. The naming of the world, through which people
constantly recreate that world, cannot be an act of arrogance”107. Freire too
emphasises the importance of the virtue of listening as a sign of humility
and that ultimately “only those who listen, speak”108.

However it is important to mention that Freire is not a relativist and does not
believe that everyone‟s dialogical contribution is of equal value; but on the

contrary, some peoples‟ ideas and thoughts are better than others109. In
comparison, while acknowledging the differential value of concrete ideas,
the members of the Bahá‟í faith elect their Bahá‟í consultative groups with
an emphasis on their collective contribution to the community, and not the
quality or record of their individual ideas.

Bahá‟í consultation and Freirean dialogue also share a concern for unity
within a field of human diversity. The virtue of unity and unity in diversity
are fundamental teachings of the Bahá‟í Faith. Bahá‟u‟llah has explicitly
stated that, “no power can exist except through unity, no welfare and no
wellbeing can be attained except through consultation”110. Furthermore both
unity and consultation are bedrocks of Bahá‟í administration. The Bahá‟í
consultative process requires unity to create a sense of wholeness,
togetherness and solidarity among the group. In this form of group decision-
making, it is the first duty of the members to effect their own unity and
harmony in order to obtain good results. Overall according to Kolstoe111,
unity in consultation is a matter of identifying a clear common purpose.
When this clear common purpose is combined with other consultative
qualities of love, humility and respect, the group is then able to move
towards decisiveness. Even if a decision is made that is later proven to be
wrong, a united consultative body will simply review the matter, without
any disappointment or blame.

The principle of unity in diversity is closely related to the quality of unity in
consultation. The notion of unity in diversity offered by Bahá‟u‟llah
encourages Bahá‟ís to first observe their oneness as human beings, so they
can make their differences harmonious. According to this principle, the
diversity of the individuals in a consultative body is acknowledged and
respected; and their personal views and background are welcomed. At the
same time through the ongoing process of consultation on all matters,
Bahá‟ís further recognise and celebrate their common spiritual path, guided
by Bahá‟í‟ principles. The practical application of unity in diversity in many
Bahá‟í communities is in its formative stage and an ongoing learning
process.

In Freirean pedagogy, the notion of unity is closely related to the
revolutionary praxis of liberation. In this model, it is the responsibility of
revolutionary leaders to dedicate themselves to a ceaseless effort towards
unity among the oppressed - and unity of the leaders with the oppressed – in
order to achieve liberation and that the unity between the leaders grows out
of communion with the people. Freire further emphasises that achieving this
level of unity requires a form of cultural action through dialogue, for people
to come to understand their adhesion to reality112. In this sense, unity is a

relationship between individual leaders and the people, whereas from a
Bahá‟í point of view, unity is achieved through consultative processes
between the collective leadership elected by the believers locally, nationally
and internationally and the wider community.

In Bahá‟í administration unity has been regarded as the most vital element
of the organization and management of communities around the world. In
particular, at the local and national level the collective leadership (local and
national spiritual assemblies) and the members of the community as a whole
are encouraged to work and consult in full harmony in a cooperative
manner. According to Shoghi Effendi113 the unity and cooperation of Bahá‟í
administrative bodies at the local and national level are of utmost
importance, upon them depend the unity of the Bahá‟í faith and the
solidarity of the members of the faith. Freire114 also regards unity as vital to
group organization and management development. For him, organization is
a highly educational process of learning and perfecting necessary skills and
knowledge required to achieve liberation. Which further requires the unity
of leaders and the people to create true authority and freedom through
dialogue.

´Thus unity is a recognised notion in both the Bahá‟í Faith and Frerian
pedagogy, however they represent two different models of unity. The Bahá‟í
approach to unity presents a collective spiritual vision of a global faith
community for the systematic and united implementation of Bahá‟í
teachings and its administrative order. For Freire unity represents a
collective action and reflection (dialogue) between people and revolutionary
leaders for social and political change and humanisation of the world.

According to Freire the notion of unity in diversity was born from his
growing awareness of the patterning of the specifics of oppression along the
lines of language, race, gender and ethnicity, etc. He further states that he
has “been defending the fundamental thesis of unity in diversity, so that
various oppressed groups can become more effective in their collective
struggle against all forms of oppression”115. Freire believes that through
unity in diversity and democratic solidarity, people are potentially able to
generate profound shifts in the political and economic systems that intensify
racism and separatism. Freire argues that we must begin by understanding
the history of these cultural differences, due to the presence of factors such
as class, race and gender, and secondly to understand how these differences
have contributed to discriminatory practices that exist in our societies
today116.

Freire, Oppressed, 160

Freire, Dialogue, 310

Freire (1995:395).

Freire‟s approach to the notion of unity in diversity is in some ways
compatible to the Bahá‟í approach especially when it comes to the
importance of open dialogue and solidarity among diverse sections of
society and humanity as a whole for the betterment of the world. Another
similarity is Freire‟s acknowledgement of the importance of understanding
and embracing cultural differences for achieving unity in diversity. In the
Bahá‟í faith the vision of unity in diversity is foundational, considered a
fundamental step towards a greater understanding and the celebration of our
differences, and consultation provides the opportunity to communicate those
differences. In comparison, Freire only began to discuss unity in diversity or
unity within diversity later in his writing, without any in depth exposition of
the topic. His brief expressions on this topic have been mainly in relation to
unity in diversity among educators from educationally and politically
oppressive backgrounds.

Another noticeable similarity between the two philosophies is their
systematic approach to achieving group goals and aspirations. In the case of
Bahá‟í consultation, the Universal House of Justice117 directs all Bahá‟í
institutions and communities to foster the advancement of Bahá‟í
community growth and development by engaging in a constant process of
action, consultation and reflection/learning. Bahá‟ís around the world
engage in regular consultation meetings; to reflect on issues, consider
adjustments, and maintain enthusiasm and unity of thought.

Similarly in Pedagogy of the Oppressed, Freire rouses the oppressed to
achieve transformation through dialogue by committing themselves to a
constant process of action and reflection. If dialogue or the “word” is
deprived of the dimension of action, reflection automatically suffers as well,
and it becomes mere verbalism (Sacrifice of Action). On the other hand if
action is emphasised exclusively, to the detriment of reflection, the “word”
is converted into activism for activism‟s sake (Sacrifice of Reflection)118
(1972:68-69). For Freire reflection provides people with a greater
understanding of the historical backgrounds of oppression, so that their fight
against oppressive conditions is not purely based on informative exposition,
without radical action. Freire has regarded the above as his revolutionary
theory, holding that any human activity or revolution must consist of action
and reflection for it to be transformative. “Human activity is theory and
practice, it is reflection and action. It cannot be reduced to either verbalism
or activism119.

Finally, it is important to recognise that there are a number of fundamental
differences between the two approaches. Bahá‟ís believe that it is through
spiritualisation that humanity can advance and develop materially. Also the

institution of Bahá‟í consultation is regarded as a means whereby people can
now utilise their God-given wisdom to determine their own destiny, and no
longer need self-appointed leaders, clergy and priests to instruct them.
Bahá‟í teachings most of all stress the spiritual nature of justice and freedom
and see them as innate, bestowed when we enter the world. Bahá‟í teachings
also call us to engage, as individuals, with the social injustices of the world
through the development and application of virtues, noble deeds and the
development of spiritual, physical, emotional and intellectual capacities.
Bahá‟ís strongly believe that serious attention must be given to the role of
spiritual values in building human capacity, and that overall human progress
and development cannot come from political and revolutionary
participations alone.

By contrast, Freire focuses on the importance of revolutionary leadership
and theory, to transform the world. He also emphasises the political and
social nature of justice and fighting for freedom from oppression. He most
certainly sees humans as ethical beings always in the state of becoming
more “fully human” by engaging in authentic praxis, through dialogue with
others, in a critically conscious way120. Unlike Bahá‟ís, Freire does not
recognise religious spirituality as the key element for human betterment and
progress. For Freire, liberation and betterment is achieved through
conscientisation and humanisation of people and their willingness to fight
oppression through dialogue and political activism.

Both Bahá‟í consultation and Freireian dialogue are, it is suggested,
effective means of freeing people from oppression and a way of giving them
the power to make their own decisions and realise their own potential. For
Bahá‟ís, however, consultation is also a way of “redefining power in
society” making radiance of spirit, love of God, humility and patience the
dominant forces in all decision-making121. From the Bahá‟í point of view
human power is directly connected with spiritual power initiated through the
love of God and communion with him. Hence, all consultative meetings
always start with prayers and remembrance of the Creator, which is also an
effective way for the group to achieve a meditative state and a level of
clarity in preparation for the decision-making process itself. Bahá‟í
teachings acknowledge the power of human intellect and expression in
consultation, especially when combined with the power of spiritual insight
and faith.

Freire, on the other hand emphasises the power of human intellect and
human ethics for humans to achieve their significance. For instance in the
Pedagogy of the Oppressed he states that dialogue “requires an intense faith
in humankind, faith in their power to make and remake, to create and re-
create faith in their vocation to become more fully human”122. In this

pedagogy the relationship between the dialoguers is the centre of achieving
true dialogue, whereas the Bahá‟ís believe that this relationship is secondary
to the relationship that people must develop with the Creator. However as
mentioned previously when it comes to peoples‟ treatment and their
relationship with each other both Freirean and the Bahá‟í faith demand the
same degree of commitment.

According to Elias123 Freire was committed to the Christian gospel and
many concepts such as freedom and equality have deep religious roots, and
in his work as consultant to the World Council of Churches he more fully
developed the connection between his theological and his educational
theories. As an educationist, he preferred a prophetic type of religion that
used education as “an instrument of transforming action, a political praxis at
the service of permanent human liberation”124 .

Overall, both the Bahá‟í Faith as a religious movement and Freirean
pedagogy as a revolutionary movement aim to empower the oppressed and
the downtrodden to be more conscious about their own abilities and
potentials as human beings. This sense of awakening and consciousness can
be pursued in significant measure through the decision-making powers of
Bahá‟í consultation and Freirean dialogue. Furthermore, they can both be
recognised as effective tools for people to unite and depend on one another
with intense love and faith. They also provide an ideal environment for
people to develop their humanity and human virtues while learning to listen
to others with patience, humility and trust.

Possible Contributions of Bahá’í consultation and Freirean Dialogue to
the Field of Development

Consultation as a method of communication, decision-making and problem
solving has been one of the major features of Bahá‟í community
development for many decades. In relation to the field of development its
usage became official after the 20 October 1983 message from the Universal
House of Justice. Bahá‟ís around the world were encouraged to become
more effective in the field of socio-economic development “through their
application of spiritual principles, their rectitude of conduct and the practice
of the art of consultation, to uplift themselves and thus become self-
sufficient and self-reliant”. As a consequence of this process they would be
able to extend the benefits of their experience and their efforts to society as
a whole125
The call was made globally to Bahá‟ís of all social, economic, educational
backgrounds to contribute to the field of development by evoking their

resourcefulness, flexibility and cohesiveness. This is to say that all Bahá‟ís,
irrespective of their circumstances and resources, are endowed with the
capacity to participate in activities and can use the Bahá‟í principle of
consultation, among others, to raise the quality of human life, followed by
unity in spirit and in action.

According to Vick126, “social and economic development requires
consultation to restore hope and self-confidence to people who do not
recognise their own potential”. Although many people are regarded as
“underdeveloped”, as belonging to the “third world”, they are presented,
within a Bahá‟í paradigm, with an equal opportunity to participate in any
consultative process. First, they begin by creating a greater awareness about
their circumstances by listening to others, secondly, by gaining self-
confidence in expressing their own ideas, and thirdly by becoming aware of
their own abilities to transform their ideas into united action.

Furthermore, Bahá‟í consultation is central to the task of reconceptualizing
systems of human relationships. The standard of truth seeking that is
required by Bahá‟í consultation is far beyond the patterns of negotiation and
compromise that tend to characterize present-day discussion of human
affairs127. This ultimate search for truth as a moral and ethical foundation
allows a group to arrive at a consensus about the truth and the most
appropriate line of action to be taken in any given situation in unity and
solidarity.

In any social and economic development project, individual Bahá‟ís are
called to strive to transcend their individualist perspectives, in order to
function as members of a body128. Even when a collective body arrives at a
decision about an aspect of a project, and some individuals may not fully
agree with the decision they are encouraged to support the decision to
preserve and facilitate the learning processes of the group. With regards to
development, I believe that this kind of approach to decision-making and
problem solving allows people the opportunity to learn from their own
mistakes. They come to understand that Bahá‟í consultation is a process of
discovery rather than a magical solution for their issues and problems.
Viewed in this light, consultation is the operating expression of justice in
any given development practice. In this context true justice is the ability to
consider and consult all possible options with unity of thought and an open
mind.

According to Bahá‟u‟llah129 no Bahá‟í can achieve their true station as
spiritual beings “except through justice. No power can exist except through
unity. No welfare and no wellbeing can be attained except through

Bahá‟u‟llah, Consultation, 1

consultation”. The Prosperity of Humankind, a statement by the Bahá‟í
International Community, points to the significance of justice: “so vital is it
to the success of collective endeavour that it must constitute a basic feature
of a viable strategy of social and economic development. Indeed, the
participation of the people on whose commitment and efforts the success of
such a strategy depends becomes effective only as consultation is made the
organising principle of every project”130.

According to Dahl131 the use of Bahá‟í consultation in development practice
is more than just a procedure for arriving at good decisions; more
importantly it is a method to teach groups to work together and establish
stronger human ties. By participating in the process of consultation people
are forced to acknowledge and hopefully appreciate their differences, while
respecting and being open to each individual‟s unique contribution. Dahl
also emphasises that in a Bahá‟í consultative group everyone has an equal
voice regardless of their level of education or wealth, each individual
equally possesses a human wisdom. In some cases, in his experience, the
best ideas have come from the most humble participants. Overall Dahl
regards such consultative development groups as powerful forums for
practically and concretely exposing Bahá‟ís to the spirit of equality and
brotherhood, which is central to the Bahá‟í teachings.

Bahá‟í consultation according to Vick132, challenges injustice by eliminating
power relationships in decision-making. Shoghi Effendi133 stresses “…the
keynote of the cause of God (Bahá‟í Faith) is not dictatorial authority but
humble fellowship, not arbitrary power, but the spirit of frank and loving
consultation”. Bahá‟í consultation is an exercise of collaborative power,
based on personal and collective qualities such as love, humility and
patience, and the importance of considering all ideas regardless of people‟s
status in the society. Again this shows that consultation is no easy skill to
learn, especially when it comes to people in positions of power coming to
view others as their equals.

Experience has shown, according to Vick134 and Dahl135 that in numerous
Bahá‟í development projects, consultation has enabled highly educated
development experts and communities of illiterate people to make unified
and effective decisions. Such consultation offers all parties a ladder to climb
beyond the limited experiences and attitudes they held about each other
before entering into the domain of consultation.

Consultation is no easy skill to learn, its application in development can at
times be slow and seemingly inefficient136. It takes patience, sensitivity and
profound love to draw out the noble qualities and sentiments in people who
have been denied a voice all their lives137. Bahá‟í consultation, as difficult
and challenging as it might seem, will remain at the heart of the Bahá‟í
faith‟s contribution to the field development. I believe as the number of
successful Bahá‟í development projects grow, more and more communities
will be interested to collaborate with Bahá‟ís in a mutual process of learning
and consolidation. While in the short-term Bahá‟í consultation is used by
Bahá‟ís in development practice, the many positive decisions and solutions
achieved through it aim to benefit humanity as a whole.

With regards to Freire, his work and philosophy has already been recognised
in alternative development tools like Participatory Action Research (PAR),
and he is regarded as a legend in this field. In particular the Freirean concept
of conscientisation or the stimulation of self-reflected critical awareness has
been widely used in the PAR movement. For example, its usage is proven to
be effective in a number of Asian initiatives, where the rejection of „aid‟ has
been recognised as a solution to the problem of people‟s development
(„liberation‟)138.

Furthermore Freirean thinking is well articulated in relation to the role of
education in social development and has come to be viewed as an organic
component of the process of „animation‟139 Similar to dialogue and Bahá‟í
consultation animation is about learning, knowing and understanding, as
well as coming to terms with their own intellectual powers and self
discovery as creators of knowledge. Inspired by Freire, the dialogical
process of Participatory Action Research has offered many developing
communities the chance to create a method of collective reflection and
communication. This dialogical process has also been referred to as
„animation‟, which can be defined as a communication process of people‟s
development of „intellectual capabilities and collective self-knowledge‟, and
through this process they come to recognise themselves as „the principal
actors in their lives and not as subordinates to other social classes, to stand
up with self-esteem, to develop a critical understanding of the conditions of
their lives and to express and assert themselves through collective action‟140

Freire‟s work in alternative development has increased people‟s awareness
by helping them develop their „critical faculty‟ and has encouraged them to
break down decades of passive acceptance to become legitimate
development actors141. Rahman142 uses the example of an NGO in

Bangladesh implementing Freirean pedagogy to develop self-reflected
awareness („conscientisation‟) of the landless. The efforts began with a three
months process of learning and dialogue on matters relating to land
ownership, and even discussing some vocabulary used for expressing land
ownership and landlessness in that community. Through this process
landless people developed organization consciousness at a local level,
starting a savings programme that eventually led to a collective ownership
of a number of agriculturally suitable lands.

As discussed above, according to Oakley143, Rahman144, Roberts145 and
other development thinkers, unequal power relations are a key issue in
people‟s participation in their own development. As early as 1974 Roberts
declared that development should emphasize more equal distribution of
power among people. Paulo Freire146 convincingly argued that only access
to real power could break what he termed „cultural of silence‟, which can be
characterised by the dependence and the marginality of the powerless.
According to Oakley147, power in a Freirean sense refers to power „to do‟,
„to be able‟ and the feeling of being more capable and in control of
situations. This implies that development must recognise people‟s capacities
to take action and to play an active role in development initiatives, and that
dialogue is a significant aspect of it.

Freire believes that the development and the transformation of a society
must occur in its own existential time, never outside it. He then goes on to
state that:

> “It is obvious that only a society which is a „being for itself‟ can
> develop. It is essential not to confuse modernisation with
> development. In order to determine whether or not a society is
> developing, one must go beyond criteria based on indices of per
> capita income, the basic elementary criteria is whether or not the
> society is a „being for itself‟”148.

This notion of „being for itself‟ can only be fully realised by a developing
nation or a community through the political, economic and cultural
decision-making power of dialogue. Promoting a culture of self-reliance,
people are able to realise their own potential and feel a sense of (positive)
purpose in the exercise of ownership and decision-making149.

By using the principles of Freirean dialogue and Bahá‟í consultation,
development practice can further empower and enable people to articulate
and assert themselves verbally and intellectually. The power to voice one‟s
ideas and hopes can ultimately lead to people‟s control over their own
development and self-reliance. This self-reliance and control over their
material resources is strengthened by people‟s united vision, collective
identity and solidarity, driving their material strength and also their spiritual,
mental and emotional powers.

The power of Bahá‟í consultation and Freirean dialogue has already been
discovered and used by many grassroots projects to awaken a sense of hope
and increased capacity among many peoples. In both approaches people‟s
humanity and self-worth lie at the centre of their methodological goals, they
both acknowledge and promote the need for development of certain
qualities. These qualities include love, respect, trust and patience, among
others, when engaging in developmental decision-making. In addition, they
both place a significant emphasis on the power of unity (in diversity,
through diversity), and collective nature of group decision-making. In
addition they both see the importance of complementing communication
with action and vice versa. Overall both approaches share the fundamental
principle that through collective and united dialogue and consultation people
gain a greater awareness an understanding about their own need for self-
development.

It is important to note that the Bahá‟í Faith recognises that a large number of
people in developing nations hold particular spiritual and religious belief,
that make Bahá‟í consultation highly relevant. This is where Bahá‟í
consultation is distinguished from Freirean dialogue and other methods such
as “animation” and “consciousness raising”. Bahá‟í consultation calls for
spiritual qualities and positive responses to problems based on truth and
justice under a collective elected leadership150. On the other hand Rahman151
believes that Freirean pedagogy will continue to be influential in people‟s
self-development in the field of PAR, especially in the area of education
development.

In this paper, I have tried to address issues to do with the decision-making
powers of consultation and dialogue. Further exploration and discussion of
the main themes of this study through comprehensive empirical research
would be beneficial. Overall, as growing disenchantment with the top down
approach in development increases and as some expert consultants fail to
provide suitable solutions to development problems, the decision-making
processes of Bahá‟í consultation and Freirean dialogue will continue to
provide alternative modes of achievement and models of what constitutes a
desirable world of development.
