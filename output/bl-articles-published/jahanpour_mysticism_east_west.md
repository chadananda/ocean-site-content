Farhang Jahanpour

During recent years there has been a great debate about the
clash of civilizations, which ultimately boils down to a clash
between religions, because religions form the moral and
spiritual basis of all civilizations. There is no doubt that there
is a great deal of diversity and even fundamental differences
between various different religions. It is an undeniable fact
that established religions have given rise to many conflicts
throughout history, but the main question is to what extent
have those conflicts been based on fundamental religious
differences and to what extent have they been due to political
and historical differences? True interfaith work needs to be
carried out with a full awareness of our differences and
disagreements as well as our commonalities and similarities.
Interfaith collaboration means to trust and respect one
another enough to be able to differ, to be able to exchange
unbiased and constructive criticism without wishing to
trivialize other faiths or diminish mutual respect.

Even a cursory glance at the main teachings of the Eastern
and the so-called Semitic or Abrahamic religions would reveal
some basic differences between them. 1 Eastern religions
generally believe in Monism or the Oneness of Being, and
maintain that man will be ultimately united with God; while
Semitic religions believe in Monotheism and maintain that God
is and will always remain transcendent. Therefore, although
man may attain God’s presence, union with the divine essence
will be impossible.

At the same time, although it would be inaccurate to suggest
that all religions are identical in their outward teachings and
their worldview, nevertheless, in the area of mysticism we have
the greatest degree of unity and similarity of views among the
mystics from different religious traditions. While religious

dogma and theology that are solely based on concepts and ideas
create differences and disunity, the mystical understanding of
the underlying reality of all religions can provide a basis of
unity between them. Each mystical tradition speaks about the
‘journey in God,’ of intense longing for God and devotion of
the soul to God, of surrender and purification, of
renunciation and abandonment, through union in Love. It has
been said that all mystics recognize one another, because they
come from the same spiritual country.

The late Professor Cantwell-Smith of McGill University
believed that religions could be divided into two parts: ‘Faith,’
which is a personal matter and concerns belief in spiritual
values, and the other aspect of religion which he called
‘accumulated tradition.’2 Another way of putting this idea is
to say that one can distinguish between the ‘original
revelations’ as far as they could be understood by going to the
original sources, and the ‘accumulated traditions’ and various
interpretations to which the original teachings have been
subjected. Naturally, the ‘accumulated traditions’ by which
most religions are known today have been responsible for most
of the differences between religions and also between the
contemporary forms of religions and what their founders
originally revealed.

Additionally, one can make a further distinction, between
the esoteric and the exoteric aspects of religions, between the
mystical essence and the outward and time-bound teachings
and laws. Most religious scriptures have made references to the
distinctions between the literal texts and their deeper
meanings, “the letter killeth, but the spirit giveth life.”3 The
Koran refers to Muhkamat and Mutishabihat .4 Muhkamat
refers to the plain texts that could be understood by all, and
Mutishabihat refers to the allegorical and symbolic meanings
of the text that can be understood only by those who are ‘firmly
grounded in knowledge.’ This is why religious scriptures exhort
the people to read the verses with the eye of the soul. They speak
about the need for awakening, for enlightenment, for proper
understanding, for opening one’s eyes, one’s ears, and one’s
heart.

This shows that the true meaning of the scriptures cannot be
understood by mere reading, but through contemplation, by
becoming blind in order to see, by becoming deaf in order to
hear, by becoming ignorant in order to receive wisdom. (HW
Per. 11) In the words of St Augustine, “I believe in order to
understand.”5 A deeper understanding of the words of God is
one of the functions of Irfán or mysticism. In the words of
Rumi:

> Gusham shanid qesse-ye iman-o mast shod.
> Ku sahm-e chashm surat-e imanam arezust
> My ears heard the story of faith and became
> intoxicated.
> Where is the portion of my eyes, my wish is to see the
> face of Truth.
In Arabic, the term ‘Irfán (mysticism) comes from the root
‘Arafa , to know, to recognise, rather than to be acquainted
with. It refers to seeing and feeling and knowing the Truth,
rather than having heard or read about it. It denotes gnosis
rather than knowledge. In English, the word mysticism comes
from the same root as ‘myth’ or ‘mystery.’ All are derived from
the Greek word musteion, which means to close the eye or the
mouth, to close oneself to the outside world. All three words
are therefore rooted in an experience of contemplation or
silence. These words often have negative connotations in the
West today. The word ‘myth,’ for example, is often used as a
synonym for a lie; in popular parlance, a myth is something
that is not true. Also the word ‘mystery’ is something that
needs to be cleared up, to be sorted out. It is frequently
associated with muddled thinking. Similarly, ‘mysticism’ is
frequently associated with the superstitious, with people who
lack rationality.

It is curious that even in some supposedly religious systems,
such as the present regime in Iran or under the Safavids, or the
Wahhabis or the Puritans in Christianity, mysticism is
frowned upon. Both under the Safavids, the Wahhabis, and the
Taliban the Sufis were persecuted. It should be borne in mind,
therefore, that mysticism is not the same as dogmatic religion.
In many ways, it is its antithesis. So when we speak of Islamic,

Jewish, Christian, Buddhist or Hindu mysticism we are not
talking about Islamic, Jewish, Christian, Buddhist or Hindu
theologies and codes of law, but about their spiritual concepts
that have a great deal in common.

However, mysticism does not deal merely with mystery, but
also with the sacred. Sacred, too, is one of a whole group of
cognate words: sacrament, sacrilege, consecrate, sacrosanct,
sacrifice which means to make sacred. The root of the word
sacred, sacra , means belonging to a deity. It has the
connotation of the divine. One can make a few generalisations
about what follows from the terms ‘Irfán, mysticism and
sacred.

1) Sacred presupposes the divine. You cannot speak of
sunlight without the sun. Without the presupposition of a
deity there cannot be any concept of sacred. The main habit of
a materialistic or atheistic mind is that it denies the existence
of the sacred. If there is no God, it follows logically that
nothing can be sacred. We may respect certain ideas or certain
places due to their utilitarian nature, but their importance lies
in what we derive from them, not in what they are in
themselves; while the term sacred refers to their innate or
intrinsic value.

2) Just as there can be no sacred without God, there can be
no wholeness without God. According to a materialistic
outlook, the universe is made up of disjointed or continuous
particles that follow the blind laws of physics, and there is
nothing that will link them together and that will give them
meaning. The world may be fantastic and mind-boggling, but
ultimately it is “a tale told by an idiot, full of sound and fury,
signifying nothing.”6 Even worse, according to the post-
modernist thinking, it is not even a tale told by idiot, but the
hallucinations of a sick mind. Either the world is the Word of
God, the revelation of God, the will of God — “Be and it was” —
or if, according to Nietzsche, God is dead, by definition the
world is also dead.

It is the loss of contact with the divine, with the sacred and
with the mystery that constitutes the Fall from Grace. This loss
makes man a lowly and a lonely wanderer in an absurd,
pointless and degenerating universe. According to mysticism,

Lights of ‘Irfán Book Eight                                    39

on the other hand, God exists and is the ground of being, and
gives meaning, purpose and significance to man’s life.

3) The third presupposition is God’s immanence, His
indwelling. The mystics speak of creation as the moving image
of the eternity, or a reflection of the divine. God reveals himself
in His creation. It does not mean that God and matter are one
and the same, but that matter is not conceivable without God.

The concept of God’s immanence is not limited to
Hinduism and Buddhism. Judaism, Christianity, Islam and the
Bahá’í Faith are also full of references to God’s revelation in the
world. The Bible teaches that God created man in His own
image. 7 The Koran teaches that “Whithersoever you turn, there
is the Face of God.”8 In Bahá’u’lláh’s Hidden Words we read:

> O Son of Being! Thou art My lamp and My light is in
> thee. Get thou from it thy radiance and seek none other
> than Me. For I have created thee rich and have
> bountifully shed My favour upon thee. (HW Ar. 11)
4) God is never an object. He can be known only through
Himself becoming the absolute subject of our being, an
epiphany. In other words, we know God through Himself. The
Sufis say that God is both the lover and the beloved. Man is
thirsty for God and God is thirsty for man. Man seeks God and
God seeks man. There is a union or trinity between Love, the
Lover and the Beloved. In the words of Rumi:

> Parro-bal-e ma kamand-e eshq-e ust.
> Mukeshanash mikeshad ta kuy-e dust
> Our wings and feathers are the lassos of His love.

They pull us by our hair to the realm of the Beloved.
As Bahá’u’lláh says, “Love Me that I may love thee. ”9 Or:

> O Son of Spirit! I created thee rich, why dost thou
> bring thyself down to poverty? Noble I made thee,
> wherewith dost thou abase thyself? Out of the essence
> of knowledge I gave thee being, why seekest thou
> enlightenment from anyone beside Me? Out of the clay
> of love I molded thee, how dost thou busy thyself with
> another? Turn thy sight unto thyself, that thou mayest

> find Me standing within thee, mighty, powerful and
> self-subsisting. 10
5) Creation is a revelation not about God, but revelation of
God itself. “The heaven and earth are full of thy glory. The
heavens declare the glory of God.”11 If God is not present in a
grain of sand he is not present in heaven either. In the words of
William Blake (1757-1827), true knowledge consists of:

> To see a World in a Grain of Sand,
> And a heaven in a wild flower,
> Hold Infinity in the palm of your hand,
> And Eternity in an Hour. 12
The same universality that exists in the material laws also
exists in spiritual realm. If this was not so there could not be
any contact with the sacred either in life or in art or in religion
and mysticism.

Hinduism and Buddhism are often described as religions of
monism. They allegedly believe that the whole universe is part
and parcel of God, and they do not make any distinction
between the world of the matter and the world of the spirit. But
Brahma, which is the Sanskrit word for the Absolute, is the
supreme divinity, who is transcendent as well as immanent,
beyond all limitations and definitions. He is the principle of
search as well as the object sought, the animating ideal and its
fulfilment. Mundaka Upanishad says about Him: “He is the
Lord of all, that from which all things originate, and in which
they finally disappear.”13

Brahma is the immanent ground and operative principle in
all subjects and objects. At the beginning of Kena Upanishad
we read: “What cannot be spoken with words, but that whereby
words are spoken; know that alone to be Brahma, the Spirit,
and not what people here adore. What cannot be thought with
the mind, but that whereby mind can think; know that alone to
be Brahma, the Spirit, and not what people here adore.”14

Lights of ‘Irfán Book Eight                                     41

Chandogya Upanishad expresses the spiritual experience of
Brahma in these words: “There is a Spirit which is mind and life,
light and truth and vast spaces. He contains all works and
desires and all perfumes and all tastes. He enfolds the whole
universe, and in silence is loving to all.”15

If we ask where is Brahma, the Spirit of the Universe, the
answer is given in Kena Upanishad : “He is seen in nature in the
wonder of a flash of lightning. He comes to the soul in the
wonder of a flash of vision.”16 The glory and majesty of Brahma
are expressed in these beautiful words of the Bhagavadgita : “If
the light of a thousand suns suddenly arose in the sky, that
splendour might be compared to the radiance of the Supreme
Spirit, and Arjuna saw in that radiance the whole universe in
its variety, standing in a vast unity in the body of God of
Gods.”17 The following passage from the Bhagavadgita expresses
the all-inclusive nature of Brahma:

> I am the creation and the dissolution of the whole
> universe. There is not anything greater than I, and all
> things hang on me, even as precious gems upon a
> string. I am moisture in the water, light in the sun and
> moon, invocation in the Vedas, sound in the
> firmament, human nature in mankind, sweet-smelling
> savour in the earth, glory in the source of light. In all
> things I am life; and I am zeal in the zealous; and know
> O Arjoon! that I am the eternal seed of all nature. I am
> the understanding of the wise, the glory of the proud,
> the strength of the strong, free from lust and anger. 18

Mudaka Upanishad expresses the same doctrine in a different
way:

> As from a well-blazing fire, sparks
> By the thousand issue forth of like form,
> So from the imperishable, my friend, beings manifold
> Are produced, and thither also go. 19
Hinduism preaches an unbounded toleration of all other
religions, because although they may differ in appearance yet in
reality they are all of the same substance. A Hindu song says:

Into the bosom of the one great sea

> Flows streams that come from hills on every side;
> Their names are various as their springs;
> And thus in every land do men bow down
> To one great God, though known by many names. 20
In the Upanishads again we read: “My names are many as
declared by the great seers.” Again, “Him who is the One Real,
sages name variously.” “This indestructible enduring reality is
to be looked upon as one only.”21

Hinduism makes allowance for the different stages of
people’s spiritual maturity and allows different people to
approach God in the way that best suits them. Chandogya
Upanishad teaches us that the man of action finds his God in
fire, the man of feeling in heart, and the feeble-minded in the
idol, but “the strong in spirit finds God everywhere.” 22 To the
Hindus, God’s true essence is completely beyond the
understanding of even the wisest of men and so no matter what
we call him is a creation of our mind and is ultimately of little
importance. The best thing is if we can rise above the names
and attributes of God and worship him in his abstract reality:

> The worshippers of the Absolute are the highest in rank;
> second to them are the worshippers of the personal
> God, then come the worshippers of the incarnations
> like Rama , Krishna , Buddha ; below them are those who
> worship ancestors, deities and sages, and lowest of all
> are the worshippers of the petty forces and spirits. 23
This is why when it comes to the definition of God, the
Hindus prefer to answer in negative terms: neti, neti , no, no.
Hindu thinkers bring out the sense of the otherness of the
Divine by the use of the negatives: “There the eye goes not,
speech goes not, nor mind, we know not, we understand not;
how one would teach it?” 24 In essence, they say that we know all
that God is not, but what He is we do not know.

At the same time, in many Hindu texts one can see a
distinction between the world of being and the revelation of
Brahma and his essence. If read properly, Bhagavadgita is
indeed a kind of Mantiq at-Tayr or The Conference of Birds by
Farid al-Din Attar (ca. 1142 — ca. 1220),25 or The Seven Valleys
by Bahá’u’lláh. 26 It talks of the stages of Arjuna’s gradual

Lights of ‘Irfán Book Eight                                  43

development from bewilderment to search, to detachment, to
humility, to submission, to enlightenment and to union with
the Brahma. While at the beginning of the book Arjuna is the
lord and master and Krishna is his charioteer, at the end the
roles are reversed and Arjuna discovers the glory of Krishna. At
times we feel that the words of Arjuna are our own words:
“Speak to me again of thy power and thy glory, for I am never
tired, never, of hearing thy words of life.”27

At this point, the Bhagavadgita rises to the highest points
and Krishna reveals: “I am the beginning, I am the middle, I am
the end. I am the undying Lord of creation. Whenever there is
the decay of religion and an ascendancy of irreligion I am
revealed from age to age.”28

B uddhis m a nd Nir v a na (Nibba na )

Many Western observers have seen something negative in
nirvana as a goal. This seems perverse to the Buddhists, for
whom nirvana is above all supreme happiness. The main schools
of Indian Buddhism agree that nirvana is not a mere negation.
Rather it is unconditional dharma , not expressible in spatial or
temporal terms; knowledge of it dissolves ignorance and ends
craving.

Nirvana means total extinction. However, Nirvana is not
total nothingness. It contains the concept of the Void, the
sonyata , but also of fulfilment. By avoiding the two extremes,
indulgence in sensual pleasure and self-mortification, one gains
the enlightenment of the middle path which produces insight,
produces knowledge, and conduces to tranquility, to higher
knowledge, to Enlightenment, to Nirvana. According to
Buddhist scriptures, Nirvana is ineffable and inexpressible, and
we cannot employ any category to describe what the Void is.
Nothing can be said of it. However, it is something. It is that
thing out of which everything comes. The Buddhists call it
Suchness, it is Whateverness of being. It is the underlying unity
of all things. It is the great reservoir of all possible
potentialities. It is the ground of being, in the same way that
the ocean is the ground of the waves. All waves, whatever their
shapes and forms, have the same water and formlessness as their
substance, their suchness.

Often Nirvana is referred to in positive terms. Buddha
describes Nirvana as:

> …the far shore, the subtle, the very difficult to see, the
> unaging, the stable, the undisintegrating, the
> unmanifest, the unproliferated, the peaceful, the
> deathless, the sublime, the auspicious, the secure, the
> destruction of craving, the wonderful, the amazing,
> the unailing, the unailing state, the unafflicted,
> dispassion, purity, freedom, the unadhesive, the island,
> the shelter, the asylum, the refuge… 29
In its negative aspect, it is our total extinction to the self
and all that is not God. In its positive side, it is the union of us
with the great Source. Nirvana is release because it is the
awareness of the illusoriness of all phenomenal being and their
union with the great Void. Life is like an ever-flowing river,
never being the same. We want to cross the river to the other
side, which is Nirvana. Buddhism is the boat, which will carry
us to the other side. After crossing not only one leaves behind
the first shore and the river, but also the boat that has
transported one to this shore; so that at that point even
Buddha and Buddhism do not exist any longer. One achieves
one’s own Buddhahood and Enlightenment.

However, it has to be borne in mind that Nirvana is not
merely a negative state, but plays a role in Buddhist life that is
analogous to union with God. Edward Conze points out that
the Buddhists often use the same imagery as the theists:

> We are told that Nirvana is permanent, stable,
> imperishable, immovable, ageless, deathless, unborn,
> and unbecome, that it is power, bliss and happiness,
> the secure refuge, the shelter and the place of
> unassailable security; that it is the real Truth and the
> supreme Reality; that it is the good, the supreme good,
> and the one and only consummation of our life, the
> eternal, hidden and incomprehensible Peace. 30
Buddha insisted that Nirvana could not be defined or
discussed as though it were any other human reality. Buddha
always refused to answer questions about Nirvana or the
Ultimate Reality      because it     was  ‘improper’ and

‘inappropriate.’ We could not define nirvana because our
words and concepts are tied to the world of sense and flux.
Buddha taught:

> There is monks, an unknown, an unbecome, an
> unmade, an uncompounded. If monks, there were not
> there    this     unborn,     unbecome,      unmade,
> uncompounded, there would not here be an escape
> from the born, the become, the made, the compounded.
> But because there is an unborn, an unbecome, an
> unmade, an uncompounded, therefore, there is an
> escape from the born, the become, the made, the
> compounded. 31
The reason given for the Buddha’s silence regarding the
nature of God or Nirvana is practical: such matters are time-
wasting and distracting; they do not conduce to the aim.
However, it is totally wrong to see the Buddhism as a form of
atheism or Nirvana as nothingness.

Zor oa s t er ’ s Te a chings

The first important point which Zoroastrian sacred books
preach is the existence of an Omniscient Creator called Ahura
Mazda. The name Ahura Mazda is full of significance. Ahura
(Sanskrit Asura ) means “Lord of Life.” He is the Creator and
upholder of all life, and thus represents the spirit side of the
universe. Mazda may be explained as made up from maz
(Sanskrit mah) and the root da (Sanskrit dha ), and the word
may be translated as “Creator of Life and Creator of Matter.”
Thus this name brings out the fundamental duality of our
visible universe — Spirit and Matter. It implies that the
Supreme Being is the Creator and Upholder of these two great
principles.

This supreme Ahura Mazda is necessarily invisible and
intangible to our physical senses. He can only be “seen” through
the “eye of the spirit.”32 For human beings, He must necessarily
remain a mere name. To understand Him, therefore, Zoroaster
has pointed out a method through the Amesha-Spenta (usually
translated as the ‘Holy Immortals’). In later ages, these have
been understood as almost equivalent to Arch-angels, deities

standing next to the Godhead in rank, each with a special
‘department’ of the universe assigned to him or her to look
after. They can also be described as God’s names and
attributes.

Western scholars have tried to explain them as ‘personified
qualities of Godhead,’ but that seems somewhat inadequate. To
begin with, they are six in number, divided into two groups of
three each. In one group all three bear names in the feminine
gender and represent the Mother-side of the Supreme. In the
other group the names are actually in the neuter gender, but
they stand for masculine concepts and represent the Father-side
of the Supreme. Thus we have among the highest divinities two
clear groups, one representing the active side, the Fatherhood,
and the other representing the passive side or the Motherhood
of the Supreme. These two also correspond respectively to the
Ahura and the Mazda side of God.

It must not be forgotten that all these six are not different
Beings, nor even the ‘creation’ of the Supreme. They are in very
truth aspects of Ahura Mazda. A better comparison would be
with the ‘rays’ of various colours that make up the white light
of the Sun. These six ‘Holy Immortals’ together with Ahura
Mazda Himself make a Heptad , who are known in later
literature as the “Seven Amesha-Spenta .” But the phrase used
for these seven in the Gathas is very significant — they are called
there ‘the Ahura Mazdas’ (in the plural number). 33

The three ‘aspects’ of the Supreme on the Father side are
named Asha , Vohu Mana and Kshathra . These names have been
usually translated “Righteousness or Law,” “Good Mind” and
“Power or Domination.” But these renderings convey a very
faint idea of all that these signify in the Gathas.

Asha stands for the knowledge of the Law of God and for the
Law itself. In many places Asha stand for the ‘Eternal Law of
God,’ which is identical with Righteousness. In later theology
Asha-Vahishta (the Highest Asha ) becomes identified with the
Sacred Fire, the physical symbol of Zoroaster’s religion. The
worshipper expresses this wish: “Through the highest Asha
through the best Asha may we catch a glimpse of Thee, may we
draw near unto Thee, may we be in perfect union with Thee.”34
Asha , in short, is the Righteousness of the Father in Heaven,

which we should seek first so that all other things ‘should be
added’ unto us.

There are six Amesha-Spentas, three masculine and three
feminine. The masculine ones are:
1\. Asha , the Eternal Law       of God or       the Supreme

Righteousness.
2\. Vohu-Mana , ‘the Loving Mind’ or ‘Love.’ In Yasna the

> worshipper and the worshipped are called ‘the Lover and
> the Beloved.’
3\. Kshathra , After achieving Righteousness and Love one

> should translate them into action. He must seek the help
> of the third ‘Aspect’ of the Lord, Kshathra , who
> represents the strength of the Lord — bestowed upon
> those who truly serve their brothers. It is the Creative
> Activity of the Supreme.

Feminine Amesha-Spentas are:
4\. Armaiti , usually translated piety, it is the counterpart of

> Asha on the Mother side. She is the ‘Daughter of Ahura
> Mazda’ and our ultimate refuge. 35

5\. Ameretat is immortality.
6\. Hauravatat is Wholeness or Perfection.

This wonderful and poetic teaching of the Holy Immortals
may be summed up thus: Every human being must understand
the Eternal Law of God of Truth and Righteousness. He must
realise the power of Love, and he must translate both these into
acts of Loving Service. All through his striving he must hold
fast to Faith and thus attain the Goal of Perfection and
Immortality.

The terms used to describe Ahura Mazda are always warm
and friendly. He is portrayed not as a stern judge but as loving
and accessible. He is over and over celebrated in the Gathas in
many beautiful terms. Ahura is always referred to as a “Kind
Friend” or a “Loving Father.” 36 He is consulted at the time of
difficulties. He is questioned at moments of uncertainty.

Communion with Him always leads to satisfaction and
assurance.

Se mit ic Re ligions

The biblical God is also both immanent and transcendent.

He is the God of the farthest remoteness and yet he is the One
who is with man and to whom man may cry “Hear my prayer!” 37
“The Lord is nigh unto all them that call upon him, to all that
call upon him in truth.”38 “Seek thee the Lord while he may be
found, call thee upon him while he is near.” 39 Hence, to speak of
the expansion of life may be a true word of prayer: “Out of
straitness I called upon the Lord: the Lord answered me, and let
me into enlargement.”40

In Hebrew scriptures He and Thou are made to follow
immediately upon one another; all meditation about God soon
resolves itself into invocations addressed to him, into an
expression of personal intimacy and connection: “The Lord is a
high tower for the oppressed, a high tower in times of trouble,
and they that know thy name put their trust in thee: for thou,
Lord, hast not forsaken them that seek thee.”41

To know of this One God, in whom all things and each thing
find meaning and significance, to bear witness to Him,
constitutes the monotheism given to the world by the Prophets
of Israel. Man experiences in himself the meaning of breathing
in that air of infinitude and eternity which embraces his earthly
existence. “The nearness of God is my good; I have made the
Lord God my refuge.”42 Thus, the Psalmist expresses his
yearning: “The earth is the Lord’s and the fullness thereof, the
world and they that dwell therein.” 43 “Holy, holy, holy is the
Lord of Hosts, the whole earth is full of His glory.”44

“All nations are as nothing before him, they are counted to
him less than nothing and vanity.”45 They are only a “drop in a
bucket” or “the small dust of the balance.”46 The parts of the
earth are like “a grain of sand,” and a thousand years are in his
sight “but as yesterday when it is passed.” 47 “The heavens
declare the glory of God; and the firmament shows his
handiwork.”48 “O Lord our God, how excellent is thy name in all
the earth! Thou has set thy glory above the heavens.”49

God is “from everlasting to everlasting,” and yet has “been
our dwelling place in all generations.”50 “For thus says the High
and Lofty One that inhabits eternity, whose name is Holy and:
I dwell in the high and holy place, with him also that is of a
contrite and humble spirit, to revive the spirit of the humble,
and to revive the heart of the contrite ones.”51 Anxiety and
confidence unite together. There is exaltation and there is awe.
As the prophet, in like mood says: “and thy heart shall tremble
and be enlarged.”52

The above verses would be very familiar to Muslims.

Compare with these verses the following verses of the Koran:
“Whithersoever you turn there is the face of God.” 53 “We shall
show them our signs in the heavens [in the firmament] and in
their own souls.” 54 So God is manifest both in the world of
nature, as well as, supremely, in the soul of man. “If my
servants inquire of thee concerning Me,” God charges
Mu˙ammad, “lo, I am near.”55 Indeed, “God is closer to man
than his own jugular vein.”56 The Islamic prayer addresses God
as “He who is far and cannot be seen and is close and hears
every whisper.” In the Light Verse, we read:

> God is the Light of the Heavens and the Earth. His
> Light is like a niche wherein is a lamp, the lamp encased
> in a glass, the glass as it were a glistening star. From a
> blessed tree it is lighted, the olive neither of the East
> nor of the West, whose oil would well nigh shine out,
> even though fire touched it not. It is light upon light. 57
This closeness to God is frequently reflected in the Koranic
verses, too. The merging of the Lover and the Beloved is a
recurring theme in the Koran: “Then He turned to them, that
they might turn.”58 “God was pleased with them, and they were
well pleased with God,”59 so God addresses the blessed saints in
Paradise: “O thou soul in peace, return to thy Lord, pleased
with Him and He pleased with you;”60 for “He loveth them and
they love Him.”61 This last verse is of great significance as
supporting the Sufi doctrine of Love (mahabba ) and as
providing the ultimate authority for the idea of a trinity of
Lover, Beloved and Love.

Therefore, while superficially one may be able to
differentiate between the beliefs of the Eastern and the Semitic

religions regarding God and the Absolute, a deeper reading of
them shows that in essence they are much closer to each other
than often realised. They all believe in a supernatural force
behind the creation. Although they may differ in their
definitions of the Supreme Being, they all maintain that words
are inadequate in defining him. They maintain that the divine
essence is also manifest in the world and especially in man.
They stress that the divine force is loving towards its creation,
and they also believe that there is an inherent, mutual feeling of
love and attraction in man towards that divine reality, and
that the highest aim and end of life is closeness or union with
the Beloved. Therefore, regardless of whatever name is given to
that divine reality, all paths ultimately lead to the same source.
