>   
> In this first part of the presentation, the Global Ethic will be compared with the Bahá'í Faith; this comparison was suggested by the commentary of the German theologian Hans Küng, who prepared the text of the ‘Declaration Towards a Global Ethic’ in 1993 for the Parliament of the World’s Religions:

> > 2.  How far their own tradition corresponds with other ethical traditions;
> > 3.  How far their own tradition has a distinctive, specific, special contribution to make to the ethic.”
> 
> In the official website of the Bahá'ís of the United States (http://bahai.us/) the following summation of the Bahá'í Faith is presented:
> 
> > “The central theme of Bahá'u'lláh’s message is that humanity is one single race and that the day has come for humanity’s unification into one global society. While reaffirming the core ethical principles common to all religions, Bahá'u'lláh also revealed new laws and teachings to lay the foundations of a global civilization.”
> 
> In all religious traditions these core ethical principles are described as the Path (the Way or Pathway) of God; in the Bahá'í Scriptures it is called the Straight & Righteous Path of God, the Path of Justice & Truth, the Glorious & Exalted Path of Remembrance & Guidance, the Path of Love of God

> Aristotle in the Nicomachean ethic has provided the groundwork for ethics in his basic understanding of virtues, saying that we become virtuous by doing virtuous acts, i.e., describing the virtuous life as a path one has actually to walk, or as a habit one has to practice, clearly stating that virtues have to be learned.

> 
> This presentation will demonstrate that the Bahá'í Tradition follows substantially in the same tradition and in the tradition of all other religions, having in common with them many spiritual principles. Further, it will compare several specific ethical principles as they are expressed in the Declaration of a Global Ethic with principles of the Bahá'í Faith. In this process it will become clear that the Bahá'í Ethical principles are not only corresponding with most principals of the Global Ethic, but are renewing them, extending and augmenting them, and adding a new spiritual foundation and an astoundingly deep theological balance to them, all of which could not be expressed in the Declaration and was only marginally present in all previous revelations.  
>   
> In this process the Bahá'í Faith can be described as the fulfillment of all previous Revelations and providing for mankind a deeper and better, a more mystical and unifying ethic. One could even say the Bahá'í Faith is a resurrection or rebirth of the Path of God.  
>   
> **2\. PART II**

> In the second part this paper will conclude that a common global ethic is the most likely first step towards the unification of all religions and could become the inspiration guiding the leaders of the diverse religion towards the goal of Unity in Diversity described by the beloved Guardian in the New World Order of Bahá'u'lláh. The Prerequisites for the Wayfarer in the Path of God are described in the Bahá'í Writings as follows:
> 
> 1.  The Revelation of the Manifestation give Laws and Guidance for the wayfarer in the Path of God
> 2.  The right attitude to recognize and accept the Path required that “A true seeker … must, before all else, cleanse and purify his heart” (KI 192)
> 3.  In order to follow the Path of God this essential recommendation is made: O seeker, It behooveth us firmly to … embrace the dawning light of divine guidance (KI 37)
> 
> The presentation will have the following conclusions:
> 
> 1.  In order to go the Path of God we must have the “Revelation and Guidance” (PM 179) of the Manifestations'
> 2.  In order to move towards a unity of all religion we have to have “a new love for, and a genuine appreciation of the unity underlying, the various religions” (WOB 196)
> 3.  Further, we have to regard all religions “in no other light except as different stages in the eternal history and constant evolution of one religion.” (WOB 114)
> 4.  The “unalterable purpose” of the Bahá'í Faith and the purpose of all fellow wayfarers must be “to assist” each other “in the realization of their highest aspirations.” (WOB 114)
> 
> The following can give a vision of how the Bahá'í Revelation can be understood as the Unity of different facet of ethical truth. The Prayer of the Báb, the four Pathways of Love of Bahá'u'lláh are placed in the frame of the description by Bahá'u'lláh of the four divine states, firstness and lastness, outwardness and inwardness, following this Verse:
> 
> > In thine outward appearance, thou tellest of the appearance of power in the realms of divine creation; in thine inward being thou revealest the hidden mysteries which are the divine trust deposited within thee.  
> >   
> > And thus firstness and lastness, outwardness and inwardness are, in the sense referred to, true of thyself, that in these four states conferred upon thee thou shouldst comprehend the four divine states, and that the nightingale of thine heart on all the branches of the rosetree of existence,re whether visible or concealed, should cry out: "He is the first and the last, the Seen and the Hidden...." \[1 Qur'án 57:3.\] (SVFV 27).

The Path of God
Declaration Towards a Global Ethic

and the Bahá’í Faith

Wolfgang A. Klebel

Introduction

The question “What is religion?” can be answered in many
ways. As the title of this paper indicates, religion is seen here as
a path, as a way, as a special way of life, i.e., the “good life”. It
will be shown that the concept of religion as a path is embodied
in all religions and is almost the only concept that describes all
of the world religions today. Even Buddhism, which does not
have a conceptual understanding of God, is above all described
as “The Eightfold Path.”

The philosophical discipline describing the good life is
Ethics, which follows the concepts of Aristotle who begins his
treatise on ethics with the words: “Every art and every inquiry,
and similarly every action and pursuit, is thought to aim at
some good; and for this reason the good has rightly been
declared to be that at which all things aim.”1

Shoghi Effendi, the Guardian of the Bahá’í Faith, in 1943,
when describing the “three embryonic Bahá’í educational
institutions in the North American continent,” mentions
“courses on Bahá’í ethics” and “lectures on Comparative
Religion.” (GPB 340) Combining these two lines of inquiry, this
paper attempts to describe the ethical implications of the “Path
of God” in the search for the unifying principle of the major
world religions. Such a study of comparative religion could be

100                                       Lights of ‘Irfán Book Eleven

the point of departure on the path towards the unity of all
religions, which is a major principle of the Bahá’í Faith.

The recent “Declaration Towards a Global Ethic”2 indicates
Ethic, as described above, may in this time and evolutionary
setting be seen as a unifying principle of all religions. This
Declaration (henceforth abbreviated DGE) is based on the
conviction that the basis for such a global ethic already exists
in the teaching of all religions, as follows:

> We affirm that a common set of core values is found
> in the teachings of the religions and that these form the
> basis of a global ethic. (DGE 14)
In the Bahá’í Faith, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá clearly expressed that the
basis of ethics, that is, morals and conduct, is the teaching of
the Religions of God:

> … the fundamental principles of the Religion of God,
> which are morals and conduct … (SAQ 53)
He further reminds us that religion is not belief and customs,
but rather God’s teachings, which constitute the very life of
humankind:

> Religion, moreover, is not a series of beliefs, a set of
> customs; religion is the teachings of the Lord God,
> teachings, which constitute the very life of humankind,
> which urge high thoughts upon the mind, refine the
> character, and lay the groundwork for man's
> everlasting honour. (SWAB 53)
In the following passage Bahá’u’lláh not only said that man
is like a mine of hidden treasures, which has to be discovered
through education, but also encourages the learned and
worldly-wise men of this age to discover these values and bring
true liberty and undisturbed peace to humankind.

> The Great Being saith: Regard man as a mine rich in
> gems of inestimable value. Education can, alone, cause
> it to reveal its treasures, and enable mankind to benefit
> therefrom. …
> If the learned and worldly-wise men of this age were to
> allow mankind to inhale the fragrance of fellowship and
The Path of God                                                101

> love, every understanding heart would apprehend the
> meaning of true liberty, and discover the secret of
> undisturbed peace and absolute composure. (GWB 259)
The first meeting of the Parliament of Religions convening
in Chicago in 1893, a year after the ascension of Bahá’u’lláh,
can well be described as a meeting “of learned and worldly-wise
men of this age.” Hundred years later in 1993 the Parliament of
Religions convened in Chicago again, and these learned men
and women of many religions accepted the “Declaration
Towards a Global Ethic,” which was signed by members of the
assembled religious groups. Representatives of the Bahá’í Faith
participated in the hosting committee of the meeting, and they
were alphabetically the first to sign the declaration.

Shoghi Effendi, in his book God Passes By, described the
original meeting of the Parliament of Religions and stated that,
in this very meeting, the first mention of the Bahá’í Faith in
America was made. He referred to the Rev. George A. Ford of
Syria, who had mentioned Bahá’u’lláh. 3 One year later, the
Bahá’í Faith was establishing a strong foothold in the city of
Chicago, the city of that very Parliament. This is how the
Shoghi Effendi describes this event:

> It was on September 23, 1893, a little over a year after
> Bahá’u’lláh's ascension, that, in a paper written by
> Rev. Henry H. Jessup, D.D., Director of Presbyterian
> Missionary Operations in North Syria, and read by
> Rev. George A. Ford of Syria, at the World Parliament
> of Religions, held in Chicago, in connection with the
> Columbian Exposition, commemorating the four-
> hundredth anniversary of the discovery of America, it
> was announced that “a famous Persian Sage,” “the Bábí
> Saint,” had died recently in 'Akká, and that two years
> previous to His ascension “a Cambridge scholar” had
> visited Him, to whom He had expressed “sentiments so
> noble, so Christ-like” that the author of the paper, in
> his “closing words,” wished to share them with his
> audience. (GPB 256)
Shoghi Effendi continues to describe that soon after this
announcement the Bahá’í Faith found its first believers in
Chicago:

102                                       Lights of ‘Irfán Book Eleven

> Less than a year later, in February 1894, a Syrian
> doctor, named Ibrahim Khayru'llah4, who, while
> residing in Cairo, had been converted by Haji Abdu’l-
> Karim-i-Tihrani to the Faith, had received a Tablet
> from Bahá’u’lláh, had communicated with ‘Abdu’l-
> Bahá, and reached New York in December 1892,
> established his residence in Chicago, and began to
> teach actively and systematically the Cause he had
> espoused. (GPB 256)
Can it not be said that the Parliament of Religion convening
in Chicago, unknowingly followed direction, given by
Bahá’u’lláh to humankind, which makes it incumbent on
everyone to consort with followers of all religions, i.e., with
each other, in a spirit of friendliness and fellowship?

> It is incumbent upon every man, in this Day, to hold
> fast unto whatsoever will promote the interests, and
> exalt the station, of all nations and just governments.
> Through each and every one of the verses which the Pen
> of the Most High hath revealed, the doors of love and
> unity have been unlocked and flung open to the face of
> men. We have erewhile declared — and Our Word is the
> truth — “Consort with the followers of all religions in a
> spirit of friendliness and fellowship.” (GWB 94)
In this paper the global ethic will be compared with the
Bahá’í Faith. This comparison was suggested by the
commentary of the German theologian Hans Küng, who
prepared the text of the ‘Declaration Towards a Global Ethic’
in 1993 for the Parliament of the World’s Religions. Hans
Küng, a Catholic theologian, was one of a group of progressive
theologians at the Vatican Council II in 1962.5

The relationship of the Bahá’í Faith with the idea of a global
ethic is expressed in the following statement:

> The central theme of Bahá’u’lláh’s message is that
> humanity is one single race and that the day has come
> for humanity’s unification into one global society.
> While reaffirming the core ethical principles common
> to all religions, Bahá’u’lláh also revealed new laws and
> teachings to lay the foundations of a global

> civilization. “A new life,” Bahá’u’lláh declared, “is, in
> this age, stirring within all the peoples of the earth.”6
As much as possible, the continuous development of the
world’s religions and the growing understanding of the Bahá’í
Faith must be taken into account. The hope is expressed that
this development will lead towards an increasing familiarity
between the religions and will eventually lead towards the unity
of all religions, understood in a new way. Any attempt thus far
at religious unity, even at the level of agreement within the
various branches of existing religions, has been an unreachable
goal. Therefore a new vision of unity is imperative.

Global ethic is described by Küng as “a fundamental
consensus concerning binding values, irrevocable standards,
and personal attitudes.” Küng further insists “There can be no
better global order without a global ethic” and states that
“global ethic means neither a global ideology, nor a single
unified global religion transcending all existing religions, nor a
mixture of all religions.” (DGE 14)

The Bahá’í Faith talks about the unity of all religion in a
different way, neither proposing a unified global ideology or
religion, nor a mixture of all religions, but putting forward a
new appreciation for the underlying unity of all religions, as
will be described below. Once this underlying unity of all
religions is understood, a new concept of unity will have to
develop. This unity of the religions cannot be clearly envisioned
today, but can best be described as “Unity in Diversity”.

The Guardian of the Bahá’í Faith, Shoghi Effendi, seemed to
indicate that a genuine appreciation of the new concept of
unity is not reached at this point but is being instilled in the
adherents of the Bahá’í Faith.

> Far from wishing to add to the number of the religious
> systems, whose conflicting loyalties have for so many
> generations disturbed the peace of mankind, this Faith
> is instilling into each of its adherents a new love for,
> and a genuine appreciation of the unity underlying, the
> various religions represented within its pale. (WOB 196)
It can be expected that it will take time before this
understanding is spread out into the followers of other

104                                       Lights of ‘Irfán Book Eleven

religions. This means that this understanding of unity will take
time to become functional as a uniting principle, acceptable to
all religions. Consequently, only after this understanding
becomes accepted can real unity follow, and it is not possible
today to describe the form it will take.

It could be stated that this appreciation of the underlying
unity of various religions was expressed in the “Declaration
Towards a Global Ethic” as a unity in the area of ethics. As a
matter of fact, it is the contention of this paper to
demonstrate that the area of ethics is the point from where
such an appreciation can best be launched. In other words, the
unity of religion is inaugurated by the unity of the ethical
principles of all religions, i.e., by a global ethic. This
foundational unity between all religions is best described as a
unity in diversity, as the ethical elements of all religions are not
uniform, but are diverse. Yet, these principles are confluent
with each other; they form a bridge between the diverse
religions. The term confluence has been described with the
dictionary as “a meeting or joining of two or more things, or
the place where two or more things meet or join.”

Could it not be said, that true followers of all religions are
more alike to each other in their ethical behavior, when
compared to superficial and external followers of their own
religion? In other words, the difference between the adherents
of any single religion could well be greater than the difference
between the followers of all religions who take the ethical
principles of their religion seriously and follow the “straight
path.”

The need for a joining of religions becomes especially
obvious when considering today’s opposing forces, such as
atheism, materialism, fanaticism and the widespread ethic of
hedonism, which are all threatening the religions, especially and
practically in their ethical principles,.

Bahá’u’lláh sees the Faith of God expressed in all of God’s
Religions, which He here calls “Faith of God and His Religion”:

> The fundamental purpose animating the Faith of God
> and His Religion is to safeguard the interests and
The Path of God                                                 105

> promote the unity of the human race, and to foster the
> spirit of love and fellowship amongst men. (TB 168)
Again, what could be a better beginning for “the spirit of
love and fellowship amongst men” than an agreement over a
common and global ethic, especially if we understand ethics
not only as the moral guidelines for a just and correct life but
as a way, or a path towards a good, happy and fulfilled life? In
a similar way the Wikipedia notes about ethics that besides its
moral aspect, “a central aspect of ethics is the good life, the life
worth living.” In the following sections of this paper this
aspect of ethics and the distinctive and special contribution of
the Bahá’í Faith in this area will be explored.

Religion, the Path of God

When talking about the world’s religions, the question has to
be raised: What is Religion? Is it the administration and the
ministers of churches, is it their dogmas and creeds, is it the
Holy Scriptures, or is it their liturgy and rituals? What in the
whole range of experiences, customs and consideration that are
connected with religion is the crucial issue that describes and
defines what people call religion? We all know that religion
deals with God, or the “numinous”, even though there is at least
one religion, Buddhism that does not talk about God.

There is one concept that is usually overlooked which seems
to be common to all religions. It is the word “Path” or the
synonym “Way”, words which are combined in the English
word “Pathway.” This word describes a central concept of
religion, which is not a philosophical, moral or legal aspect, but
describes what religion actually does: it gives any human
individual, any human group or organization: from the village
to the state, to all of humankind — a path, a way for a good
life, a life worth living, a life that is valuable and leads to God.

Religions derive this way of life from their specific sources,
that is, from the revelation and the example of their founder
Prophets, but all agree that the emphasis is on the path, rather
than the accompanying circumstances, rules, regulations and
definitions. Buddhism as a religion occupies a special place
among all the religions because it is only concerned with the

106                                       Lights of ‘Irfán Book Eleven

path and does not talk much about anything else that is usually
connected with the idea of religion. It does not even have an
idea or description of God, but still is clearly accepted as a
major world religion.

When describing religion as a path, something different is
expressed than the usual understanding of religion as church
membership or adherence to certain beliefs like creed, dogmas
or church laws. The path is not a concept of sociology, law or
order, it is not an idea usually used in theology, but it could be
best described as the actual living religion in an ethical way. In
other words, ethic is describing conceptually the path a
religious person, group or church is supposed to take. In this
paper, therefore, the words path or way are used in the context
of ethic, or ethical prescriptions and encouragements or
behavior towards the religious life. When talking about ethic in
the Global Ethic document, ethic is described as common
values, standards or attitudes, which lead to a specific way of
life, a specific path making life meaningful, good and worth
living for the individual and communities.

The Path of God in Religious Scriptures

How do the Báb and Bahá’u’lláh describe religion? For a
believer in the reality of the Báb or Bahá’u’lláh as a
Manifestation of God, Their writings are believed to be the
Word of God made manifest by the Prophet. In the verse
below, revealed by the Báb, first God speaks about what He has
done for the Báb and then God defines His religion, which the
Báb is to present to the world as none other than this glorious
and exalted Path. Even for an unbeliever or historian, this verse
expresses the idea the Báb had about His religion.

> I have called Thee into being, have nurtured Thee,
> protected Thee, loved Thee, raised Thee up and have
> graciously chosen Thee to be the manifestation of Mine
> Own Self, that Thou mayest recite My verses as
> ordained by Me, and may summon whomsoever I have
> created unto My Religion which is none other than this
> glorious and exalted Path. (SWB 158)

Bahá’u’lláh has affirmed similarly that the sole purpose of
religion as manifested by the Prophets of God is to guide
mankind to the Path of God, or the straight Path of Truth:

> The Prophets and Messengers of God have been sent
> down for the sole purpose of guiding mankind to the
> straight Path of Truth. (GWB 156-157)
Jesus had described Himself as the way, or the path unto the
Father, when He said: (John 14:6)

> I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh
> unto the Father, but by me.
Bahá’u’lláh uses similar words in describing Himself:

> I, verily, am the Path of God unto all who are in the
> heavens and all who are on the earth; well is it with them
> that hasten thereunto! (SLH 3)
As will be explained next, this is said in a tradition that
includes all major religions which are defined with the same
word, the Path or the Way of God.

Religion as Path, or Way of God

A few examples from some of the world’s religions are cited
below to clarify that the terms “Path” or “Way” are apt; in
fact, they are often the preferred terms in which the world’s
different religious Scriptures describe their reality. These terms
are not only common expressions; they seem to be the
fundamental and most universal descriptions of religion in all
of these Holy Writings.

Zoroaster

(Zend-Avesta, Avesta — Yasna) has several mentions of the path
and “the path of Good Thought,” of “Righteousness,” or
“Blessedness,” which talks about:

> … making straight the paths for the Religion of the
> future Deliverer
This path is the best, is shining, and all glorious:

> Grant to us both the desire of, and the knowledge of
> that straightest path, the straightest because of
> Righteousness, and of (Heaven) the best life of the
> Saints, shining, all glorious.

Lord Krishna

He recommends the fair path leading to heaven:

> O Indian Prince! of him whose feet are set On that fair
> path which leads to heavenly birth! (Hindu, Bhagavad Gita)
There are many places in the Hindu Scriptures where the path of
God is mentioned like the following:

> Agni, lead us on to wealth (beatitude) by a good path,
> thou, O God, who knowest all things! Keep far from us
> crooked evil, and we shall offer thee the fullest praise!

(Upanishads vol. 1, Vagasaneyi-Samhita-Upanishad 18)

Lord Buddha

The Religion of Lord Buddha (The Word, The Eightfold Path)
consists almost exclusively in describing the Path, not talking
about God or other issues:

> It is the Noble Eightfold Path, the way that leads to the
> extinction of suffering.

Moses, the servant of God

From the Books of Moses (Exodus 18:19-20)

> Hearken now unto my voice, I will give thee counsel,
> and God shall be with thee: Be thou for the people to
> God-ward, that thou mayest bring the causes unto
> God: And thou shalt teach them ordinances and laws,
> and shalt shew them the way wherein they must walk,
> and the work that they must do.

Abraham in the book of Genesis (18:19) speaking of way of the
Lord:

> For I know him, that he will command his children and
> his household after him, and they shall keep the way of
> the LORD, to do justice and judgment; that the LORD
> may bring upon Abraham that which he hath spoken of
> him.
King David in the book of Psalms (16:11)

> Thou makest me to know the path of life; in Thy
> presence is fullness of joy, in Thy right hand bliss for
> evermore.
The Prophet Isaiah (48:17):

> I am the LORD thy God which teacheth thee to profit,
> which leadeth thee by the way that thou shouldest go

Lord Jesus, the Christ

In the Gospels of Luke (3:3-4) John the Baptist prepares the way
of the Lord which is the straight path:

> And he came into all the country about Jordan,
> preaching the baptism of repentance for the remission
> of sins; As it is written in the book of the words of
> Esaias the prophet, saying, The voice of one crying in
> the wilderness, Prepare ye the way of the Lord, make his
> paths straight.

In the Gospel according to John (14:6) Jesus calls Himself the
Way:

> Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the
> life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me.

Islam, Lord Muhammad

In the opening chapter of the Qur’an the “Path of God” is
mentioned and there are very few Suras where the path or way
of God is not mentioned. Here the Opening of the Qur’an:

> IN the name of the merciful and compassionate God.
> Praise belongs to God, the Lord of the worlds, the
> merciful, the compassionate, the ruler of the Day of

> Judgment! Thee we serve and Thee we ask for aid. Guide
> us in the right path, the path of those Thou art
> gracious to; not of those Thou art wroth with; nor of
> those who err. (Sura 1)
In Sura 6 — Cattle, Muhammad describes His Faith as the
straight path, the same path Abraham has followed:

> Say: As for me, my Lord hath guided me into a straight
> path; a true religion, the creed of Abraham, the sound
> in faith; for he was not of those who join gods with
> God.

Even other religious persuasions and moral authorities are
using this term in describing their religions.

Sikh: (Shri Guru Granth Sahib, Section 6 - Raag Maajh)

Tao: (Chuangtse (Lin Yutang tr.))

The idea of religion as Path of God comes closer than any
other term to what Shoghi Effendi calls the unity underlying the
various religions:

> …this Faith is instilling into each of its adherents a new
> love for, and a genuine appreciation of the unity
> underlying, the various religions represented within its
> pale. (WOB 196)
The unity of all religions is the avowed goal of the Bahá’í
Faith. The way to this unity is the appreciation of the path of
God, which all religions profess to present. Consequently, in
this paper the conclusion is made that talking about unity of
religion is talking about the one Path of God.

Ethics as the Practice of the Good Life

Ethics or moral philosophy is described as the attempt to
formulate codes and principles of moral behavior. The history
of ethics starts with the Sophists of the Greek world in the fifth
century BC. Plato, in opposition to the sophists, describes in
his dialogues the teachings of Socrates in regard to the question
“why should I be moral,” developing the philosophy “that the
good life consists in the harmony of the soul with each part of
the soul — reason, spirit, appetite — performing its proper
function”7 From this point of departure he describes the
traditional virtues.

Aristotle in his Nicomachean Ethics develops a general
theory of virtues. There are two important issues we will
emphasize, one being the fact that virtues are learned and that
one becomes virtuous by practicing virtues. In the words of
Aristotle:

> The virtues we get by first exercising them, as also
> happen in the case of the arts as well. For the things we
> have to learn before we can do them, we learn by doing
> them, e.g., men become builders by building and lyre-
> players by playing the lyre, so too we become just be
> doing just acts, temperate by doing temperate acts,
> brave by doing brave acts.8
The things we learn — and that applies to virtues, which have
to be learned — we learn by doing them. Being virtuous or
leading an ethical life is learned, and it is learned by practicing
it, by making choices and following good judgment. The other
issue stressed by Aristotle is the fact that virtues are the middle
between excess and defect, i.e., they are practiced in
moderation.

> or the man who strays a little from the path, either
> towards the more or towards the less, is not blamed …
> How far, therefore, and how a man must stray before
> he becomes blameworthy, it is not easy to state in
> words …

> But so much at least is plain that the middle state is
> praiseworthy … While the excesses and defects are
> blameworthy.9

More specifically, Bahá’u’lláh places moral behavior and
wisdom in the heart and in the innate powers of believer

> Nay, from their hearts and the springs of their innate
> powers hath gushed out unceasingly the inmost essence
> of human learning and wisdom. (GWB 263)
Consequently, He states in the Arabic Hidden Words:

> 1. O SON OF SPIRIT!
> My first counsel is this: Possess a pure, kindly and
> radiant heart, that thine may be a sovereignty ancient,
> imperishable and everlasting.
In this context it must be understood that the seat of moral
behavior — of the virtues, is referred as being in the heart; that
they are learned and need to be practiced in order to give to the
heart an everlasting and imperishable quality.

In the Christian tradition of Ethics, Thomas Aquinas has
become the foremost representative in this area of thought. He
tried to solve the problem, which still occupies ethicists today,
how a secular understanding of man and of ethical behavior
can be harmonized with the idea that ethical behavior means
following the commands of God. This dilemma could be
formulated in the following way: Is the “good” good because it
is good, or is it good because God commands it?

This is a reformulation of the Euthyphro dilemma, as found
in Plato's dialogue Euthyphro, in which Socrates asks
Euthyphro: “Is the pious (τὸ ὅσιον) loved by the gods because it
is pious, or is it pious because it is loved by the gods?”10

The second part of this question can be interpreted as
arbitrariness on the side of God, the first implies that God has
to follow a moral rule, i.e., God is not omnipotent. In
Christian Ethics, both are true as God is the creator who
established human nature with the ability to recognize the good
life as commanded by God through human reason and
understanding.

‘Abdu’l-Bahá gives a practical understanding for this
difference and for the need to base morals in the area of
religion:

> This transformation of morals, this improvement of
> conduct and of words, are they possible otherwise than
> through the love of God? No, in the name of God.
> If, by the help of science and knowledge, we wished to
> introduce these morals and customs, truly it would
> take a thousand years, and then they would not be
> spread throughout the masses. (SAQ 304)
In the above quoted verses of Bahá’u’lláh, He places the
ability of man to recognize learning and wisdom in the powers
of the human heart. As pointed out in last year’s presentation,
the human heart is able to distinguish between positive and
negative emotions in its “little brain” and can be the
instrument of the soul of man to express this difference of
values, which can be monitored by the variation of heart
rhythms. In a paper on “Psycho-physiological Correlates of
Spiritual Experience” the training in positive emotions is
described and the following conclusion is made.

> We believe that heart rhythm coherence training holds
> promise as a practical and potent approach to
> empower individuals to improve the quality of their
> lives. By enabling the intentional self-generation and
> reinforcement of physiological states that are
> correlated with increased love, care, compassion, inner
> harmony, vitality and flow, in essence this intervention
> helps individuals create an internal environment that is
> conducive to fostering spiritual experience.
> Some might indeed describe the end result as being able
> to live more “from the heart.” in alignment with their
> deepest core values, or with greater connection to
> spirit. 11
How these findings correlate with the Bahá’í Faith was
explained in last year’s presentation. Here it suffices to state
that the metaphorical understanding of heart in poetry and
religion is based on the nature of the human heart as an

instrument of the soul and is much more realistic when the
findings of modern neurocardiology are considered.

> Recent work in the relatively new field of
> Neurocardiology has firmly established that the heart is
> a sensory organ and a sophisticated information
> encoding and processing center. Its circuitry enables it
> to learn, remember, and make functional decisions
> independent of the cranial brain.12

This corresponds well with the Bahá’í understanding that the
human heart needs to be pure, kind and radiant, and that in
man is the innate spiritual power of human wisdom and
correct action.

Küng’s Questions to the Scholars of the Various
Religions

At the opening of the Exhibit on the World’s Religions at
Santa Clara University, March 31, 2005, Hans Küng said:

> There will be no peace among the nations without peace
> among the religions. There will be no peace among the
> religions without dialogue among the religions.
The First World War was a war between empires and
nations; the Second World War was a war between ideologies,
which can be called religions (if we call Nazism and
Communism a religion); the Cold War was continuing this war
between ideologies; today’s War against Terrorists is clearly a
war that has a fanatical religious underpinning.

Bahá’u’lláh clearly distinguishes between the Path of God and
the path of error, and He explains what happened to religion
when religious leaders diverted the old religions from this Path
of God. Bahá’u’lláh accuses them outright of issuing new
commands that are leading into error giving as the motivation
for this behavior their pride and haughtiness.

> Though they recognize in their hearts the Law of God
> to be one and the same, yet from every direction they
> issue a new command, and in every season proclaim a
> fresh decree.

> No two are found to agree on one and the same law, for
> they seek not God but their own desire, and tread no
> path but the path of error.
> In leadership they have recognized the ultimate object
> of their endeavour, and account pride and haughtiness
> as the highest attainments of their heart's desire. (KI 29)
Speaking to Napoleon III of France, Bahá’u’lláh reminded
him that His Path is the same path presented by Christ; it is the
Straight Path, which was revealed by all Manifestations. As a
matter of fact, Bahá’u’lláh simply advises Napoleon to follow
in the path of Christ, to follow the religion he already
confesses. He admonishes him to arise and follow the Cause of
Bahá’u’lláh, and in so doing Napoleon would also follow Christ
in this Straight Path. He warns the emperor that otherwise his
people will rebel against him, which actually happened.

> Commotions shall seize all the people in that land,
> unless thou arisest to help this Cause, and followest
> Him Who is the Spirit of God (Jesus Christ) in this, the
> Straight Path. (PB 20)
In the following section the Declaration Towards a Global
Ethic will be compared with the principles of the Bahá’í
religion; this comparison was suggested by the commentary of
the German theologian Hans Küng, who prepared the text of the
‘Declaration Towards a Global Ethic’ in 1993 for the
Parliament of the World’s Religions:

> It will now be an enjoyable task for the scholars of the
> various religions to work out the project for a global
> ethic further in the light of their own religions and to
> bring out three things:
> How strongly the ‘Declaration Towards a Global Ethic’
> is rooted in their own tradition;
> How far their own tradition corresponds with other
> ethical traditions;
> How far their own tradition has a distinctive, specific,
> special contribution to make to the ethic.13

The first two questions can easily be answered from the
Bahá’í Faith, since this Faith claims that all religions (including
the Bahá’í Faith) are “stages in the eternal history and constant
evolution of one religion, Divine and indivisible, of which it
itself forms but an integral part.” (Shoghi Effendi WOB 114)
Consequently, a Global Ethic, which is deduced from the
ethical principles of all prior religions, will be equally rooted in
the Bahá’í Faith, which understands itself as the most recent
stage in the evolution of the understanding of God’s changeless
Religion.

There are multiple references to the Islamic and Christian
religion, as well as to the Zoroastrian and other religions in the
Bahá’í Writings, stressing the unity of religions and the
meaning of religion seen as a successive process of the one
progressive Revelation of God.

The comparison between principles presented in the Global
Ethic and in the Bahá’í Scriptures presented below will
exemplify this correspondence.

Principles Shared by the Global Ethic and the Bahá’í
Faith

This comparison can only be selective, but it demonstrates
the corresponding spirit and could be extended to a much more
comprehensive exemplification, which is here not possible
considering the limits of this paper. The statements from the
Global Ethic are selected from that part of the Declaration of
the Parliament of Religions, which was verbally presented in the
last plenary session and accepted there. (DGE 12-15)

From the Declaration           From the Bahá’í Writings14
Towards a Global Ethic

We consider humankind our     Compare the nations of the world to
family                        the members of a family. A family is

a nation in miniature. (FWU 100)
We must strive to be kind     Possess a pure, kindly and radiant
and generous                  heart (HW A 1)

> To give and to be generous are
> attributes of Mine; well is it with
> him that adorneth himself with My
> virtues. (HW P 49)
We must treat others as we        And if thine eyes be turned towards
wish others to treat us           justice, choose thou for thy neighbor

> that which thou choosest for thyself
> (ESW 29)

We respect life and dignity,      Its [the Bahá’í Faith’s] watchword is
individuality and diversity, so   unity in diversity (WOB 42)
that every person is treated
humanely, without exception.
We commit ourselves to a          Violence and force, constraint and
culture of non-violence, and      oppression, are one and all
respect for life                  condemned. (KA 238)
To a culture of solidarity and    The economic resources of the world
just economic order               will be organized, its sources of raw

> materials will be tapped and fully
> utilized, its markets will be
> coordinated and developed, and the
> distribution of its products will be
> equitably regulated (WOB 2040)
To a culture of equal rights      Yet another of the teachings of
and partnership between men       Bahá’u’lláh is the equality of men and
and women                         women and their equal sharing in all

rights. (SWA 249)

The following points of comparison better fit the third of
Küng’s questions, i.e., “How far their own tradition has a
distinctive, specific, special contribution to make to the
ethic.” It will be demonstrated that there is a distinct
difference, not so much in the statements themselves, but in the
context in which these assertions are placed, indicating that the
Bahá’í Faith has revealed a new worldview, a new
“Weltanschauung,” which does not change or abolish, but
rather enhances and renews the traditional worldview of the
previous religions.

The progress of Divine Revelation can be recognized in this
new context; as a matter of fact, this makes the Bahá’í Faith
truly a Faith for our time, a new Faith that corresponds to the
new understanding of the world and the new findings and
discoveries of science, as has been pointed out in previous
contributions by this author.

Although, there is no way to demonstrate the distinctive,
specific, and special contributions of the Bahá’í Faith in their
entirety, some aspects will be accentuated here, giving the
reader an example and a paradigm for the fact of the Unity of
all Religions, in which the Bahá’í Faith participates. This will
demonstrate, as well, the progress the one Divine Religion of
God is making from one Revelation to the next, as described in
the Bahá’í principle of Progressive Revelation.

In the following four statements selected from the
Declaration, it is pointed out that only in the context of the
Bahá’í Revelation can they properly be understood and
actualized. In other words, only when these statements are
interpreted or understood through the Bahá’í writings can they
make sense in today’s world and bring forth the intended fruit

Principles of the Global Ethic Improved upon by the
Bahá’í Faith

There are other principles declared in the Global Ethic that
are in the Bahá’í Faith as well, but seen in a different context
and therefore enhanced, when compared with the statements of
the Global Ethic, four of these principles will be outlined here,
and it will be shown how they are enhanced and put in a more
realistic context in the Bahá’í Faith. Some of the reasons why
the Global Ethic statements could not do that is indicated as
well.

The World is in Agony

The “Declaration Towards a Global Ethic” makes an initial
statement about the fundamental condition of today’s world
by stating:

> The world is in agony. The agony is so pervasive and
> urgent that we are compelled to name its
> manifestations so that the depth of this pain may be
> made clear.
Following this, the declaration describes the agony and the
suffering that are common today, mentioning unemployment,
poverty, hunger and destruction of families. The declaration
talks about corruption, racial and ethnic conflicts, abuse of
drugs, crime and anarchy. Additionally they mention the near
collapse of the ecosystem of the world. They further deplore the
fact that the leaders and members of religions “incite
aggression, fanaticism, hate and xenophobia — even inspire
and legitimate violent and bloody conflicts.” Expressing their
feelings of disgust, the members of the Parliament of Religions
“condemn these blights and declare that they need not be.”

The same understanding about the situation of today’s
world is expressed in the Bahá’í Writings. One prayer of
Bahá’u’lláh will be quoted to demonstrate that the agony is well
perceived, but the answer to this situation is different and on
another level of reality, the spiritual or religious level. Only the
first two sections of this prayer will be quoted here and
analyzed sentence by sentence.

> Lauded be Thy name, O Lord my God!
> Darkness hath fallen upon every land, and the forces of
> mischief have encompassed all the nations. Through
> them, however, I perceive the splendors of Thy wisdom,
> and discern the brightness of the light of Thy
> providence.
> They that are shut out as by a veil from Thee have
> imagined that they have the power to put out Thy light,
> and to quench Thy fire, and to still the winds of Thy
> grace. Nay, and to this Thy might beareth me witness!
> Had not every tribulation been made the bearer of Thy
> wisdom, and every ordeal the vehicle of Thy
> providence, no one would have dared oppose us,
> though the powers of earth and heaven were to be
> leagued against us. (PM 14)

As in many prayers, in the first sentence God is praised and
His name lauded. This beginning does not prepare us for the
next sentence, in which the topic of the whole prayer is
announced. In one short and pregnant sentence Bahá’u’lláh
describes the situation of the world today. In many other places
He has described it in more detail; here it is a straightforward
sentence that brings the situation of today’s world in the focus
of our view, when He says:

> Darkness hath fallen upon every land, and the forces of
> mischief have encompassed all the nations.
The whole contrast between light and darkness, as developed
throughout the history of religion is here pointed out,
beginning with the book of Genesis (1:3-4) where it is said:

> And God said, Let there be light: and there was light.
> And God saw the light, that it was good: and God
> divided the light from the darkness.
This light of creation is applied to Christ in the Gospel of
John (1:4-5):

> In him was life; and the life was the light of men. And
> the light shineth in darkness; and the darkness
> comprehended it not.
And later: (8:12)

> Then spake Jesus again unto them, saying, I am the
> light of the world: he that followeth me shall not walk in
> darkness, but shall have the light of life.

In this context we have to understand the surprising next
sentence of the prayer of Bahá’u’lláh:

> Through them, however, I perceive the splendors of Thy
> wisdom, and discern the brightness of the light of Thy
> providence.
We perceive through this darkness, through this absence of
the light — light of Creation and of the Manifestation — the
Splendor of God’s Wisdom and the Light of God’s Providence.
How can we understand that? It does not make sense in any

ordinary way. How can the darkness of the world make us see
the light of God’s providence?

Yet, this is not new. A similar understanding is clearly
expressed in the letter of the apostle Paul (1 Corinthians 1:23-24)

> But we preach Christ crucified, unto the Jews a
> stumbling-block, and unto the Greeks foolishness; But
> unto them which are called, both Jews and Greeks,
> Christ the power of God, and the wisdom of God.
In the cross of Christ the power and the wisdom of God
becomes evident, just like Bahá’u’lláh stated in the prayer
below.

> Had not every tribulation been made the bearer of Thy
> wisdom, and every ordeal the vehicle of Thy
> providence, no one would have dared oppose us,
> though the powers of earth and heaven were to be
> leagued against us.
The darkness of the world opposes the Manifestation, and
the victory of the Manifestation over the darkness, through
cross and suffering, can only be understood when this very
suffering, this very tribulation and ordeal is seen as bringing
the victory of the Light of God through the Resurrection to the
world.

In a similar way, the victory of the Manifestation over the
darkness of the world is expressed in the hymn “Exulted,” being
sung in the Easter Night celebration in the Catholic Church,
where the victory of Christ over death in His resurrection is
celebrated with these words:

> Rejoice, O earth, in shining splendor, radiant in the
> brightness of your King! Christ has conquered! Glory
> fills you! Darkness vanishes forever!
These statements and affirmations are only understandable
when we accept a new worldview, a new Heaven and Earth,
presented in every Manifestation of God to this World, as
expressed in the following section of the prayer:

> They that are shut out as by a veil from Thee have
> imagined that they have the power to put out Thy light,

> and to quench Thy fire, and to still the winds of Thy
> grace. Nay, and to this Thy might beareth me witness!
The understanding of the enemies of the Faith of God has
been proven as nothing other than imagination and idle hope.
The light is always victorious over darkness, as all known
religions explain, from Zoroaster to Bahá’u’lláh. This victory
is, as Paul has said, a stumbling block and foolishness for
unbelievers. On the other hand, as it was written in a letter on
behalf of Shoghi Effendi: “with the aid of Bahá’u’lláh … we can
turn our stumbling blocks into stepping stones …” (LG 602). The
life and the teachings of the Manifestations of God
demonstrate this truth, as Bahá’u’lláh stated in this prayer:

> Had not every tribulation been made the bearer of Thy
> wisdom, and every ordeal the vehicle of Thy
> providence, no one would have dared oppose us,
> though the powers of earth and heaven were to be
> leagued against us. (PM 14)
We might speculate that in a world that is progressing and
heading towards a goal, changes from darkness to light, from
evil to good must happen. Considering that darkness is only the
absence of light and evil the absence of good, a process of
evolution will necessary imply that there will be darkness in
order that there be improvement, and there will be evil in order
to accentuate and bring forth the good.

‘Abdu’l-Bahá gives a long discourse about good and evil and
concludes:

> The epitome of this discourse is that it is possible that
> one thing in relation to another may be evil, and at the
> same time within the limits of its proper being it may
> not be evil. Then it is proved that there is no evil in
> existence; all that God created He created good. This
> evil is nothingness; so death is the absence of life. When
> man no longer receives life, he dies. Darkness is the
> absence of light: when there is no light, there is
> darkness. Light is an existing thing, but darkness is
> nonexistent. Wealth is an existing thing, but poverty is
> nonexisting.

> Then it is evident that all evils return to nonexistence.

Good exists; evil is nonexistent. (SAQ 264)
In light of this understanding it is clear that the evil, which
is lack of good, has a function in development of good in the
providence of God and can lead to a better understanding of
God’s wisdom.

World Transformation

The Declaration towards a Global Ethic expresses its
promise of world transformation by affirming that reflection,
mediation, prayer and positive thinking will result in a
conversion of the heart:

> Earth cannot be changed for the better unless the
> consciousness of the individuals is changed. We pledge
> to work for such transformation in individual and
> collective consciousness, for the awakening of our
> spiritual powers through reflection, meditation,
> prayer, or positive thinking, for a conversion of the
> heart. Together we can move mountains! (DGE 36)
One, actually the most essential element necessary for this
transformation, is not mentioned here; it is the power of God’s
Revelation. It is interesting to note that the Declaration avoids
here and in other places the reference to God and especially to
His different Manifestations. The Catholic theologian Küng
could not have missed this essential element, but probably left
it out deliberately to avoid getting involved in the
interreligious argument regarding which of the different
Prophets truly revealed the Words of God.

This politically necessary omission again seems to indicate
that only the Unity of all Manifestations can explain the Unity
of all Religions, and all attempts to avoid this issue are
detrimental, not only to one or the other but to all religions of
God. Consider; if only one religion is true, then all of them have
to be doubted, at least by some or most of the other religions.
Only the Bahá’í belief that there is only one Religion, as revealed
by God, and that consequently there is only one Revelation to
humanity in a historical sequence through the many Prophets,
can solve the dilemma of the multiplicity of religions.

The statement of the Declaration that “together we can move
mountains” certainly reflects the Biblical Word, implying that
this togetherness must be based on the belief in a
Manifestation. In the Words of Jesus, in whom the Father is
manifest, we find:

> And Jesus said unto them, Because of your unbelief:
> for verily I say unto you, If ye have faith as a grain of
> mustard seed, ye shall say unto this mountain, Remove
> hence to yonder place; and it shall remove; and nothing
> shall be impossible unto you. (Matthew 17:20)
Reading the following statement of Bahá’u’lláh, it is clear in
the context of the Bahá’í Faith that with “these exalted words”
the Revelation of God, as presented by all Prophets of the
different religions are intended, with special reference to the
Revelation of this day, that is the Word of the Báb and
Bahá’u’lláh.

> Through the power released by these exalted words He
> hath lent a fresh impulse, and set a new direction, to
> the birds of men's hearts, and hath obliterated every
> trace of restriction and limitation from God's holy
> Book. (GWB 95-96)
While reflection, meditation, prayer, or positive thinking
are certainly elements in this transformation, it is stated here
that they are not by themselves effective, they are only bringing
about the transformation when based on the Word of God, as
revealed in every Manifestation.

Moderation and Political Power

The next issue to be dealt with in this comparison is
twofold. The Declaration recommends two things: the first is
to use a sense of moderation and modesty when it says: ‘We
must value a sense of moderation and modesty.”

The second is, that the Declaration recommends using
economic and political power in order to implant the global
ethic into this world, when it says: “We must utilize economic
and political power for service to humanity.” (p. 29)

Here again, the Bahá’í Faith has a more integral answer.

While affirming the first part, it disagrees with the use of
power in the sense of political or economic power.

Bahá’u’lláh recommends moderation in many places such as
the application to the progress of civilization, He sees
civilization as being both a source of evil or of good,
depending if the virtue of moderation is used in developing
civilization: “If carried to excess, civilization will prove as
prolific a source of evil as it had been of goodness when kept
within the restraints of moderation”. (GWB 342)

Not only is moderation recommend here, but it is clarified
as well that moderation actually makes the difference between
good and evil action, quite similar to the statement of
Aristotle mentioned above.

When talking on 30 May 1912 in a Theosophical Lodge on
Broadway and Seventy-Ninth Street in New York, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá
stated clearly that political and economic power cannot be
used to achieve unity and world peace, which would include a
binding agreement on a global ethic. He indicates that such
powers can never succeed. While this writer cannot assure the
reader that these are the actual words of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá given in
an authorized translation, they clearly are consonant with
other statements of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá.

> Therefore, a power is needed to carry out and execute
> what is known and admitted to be the remedy for
> human conditions — namely, the unification of
> mankind.
> Furthermore, it is evident that this cannot be realized
> through     material    process    and     means.    The
> accomplishment of this unification cannot be through
> racial power, for races are different and diverse in
> tendencies. It cannot be through patriotic power, for
> nationalities are unlike. Nor can it be effected through
> political power since the policies of governments and
> nations are various. That is to say, any effort toward
> unification through these material means would
> benefit one and injure another because of unequal and
> individual interests. Some may believe this great

> remedy can be found in dogmatic insistence upon
> imitations and interpretations. This would likewise be
> without foundation and result.
> Therefore, it is evident that no means but an ideal
> means, a spiritual power, divine bestowals and the
> breaths of the Holy Spirit will heal this world sickness
> of war, dissension and discord. Nothing else is
> possible; nothing can be conceived of. But through
> spiritual means and the divine power it is possible and
> practicable. (PUP 157)
What ‘Abdu’l-Bahá seems to say here is that the unification
must come first, before peace and acceptance of a global ethic
is possible, and that this unification presupposes a spiritual
power unifying the world. In other words unification of the
world is only possible on the spiritual basis of the unification
of the religions of the world. The Declaration also realizes that
any real change comes from insight, and from the power of
meditation and prayer, or positive thinking as it is called. This
aspect will be followed up below.

Conversion of the Heart

The Declaration acknowledges the need for transformation
and asserts that such a transformation must come from a
conversion of the heart:

> We pledge to work for such transformation … for the
> awakening of our spiritual powers through reflection,
> meditation, prayer, or positive thinking, for a
> conversion of the heart. (p. 36)
As mentioned before, the Declaration does not refer to the
Divine influence exerted through the Manifestation, or
Prophet, in order to avoid the issue of who is and who is not a
“real” Manifestation of God. Considering the present state of
affairs this seems to be a necessary precaution in order to
avoid the old argument between religions, questioning which
the true religion is and which is not. This very argument has
caused many wars and disagreements in the past.

Only the Bahá’í solution, to acknowledge all world religions
as being founded by God for their time, can solve this problem.
Therefore the Bahá’í Scriptures have no hesitation in asserting
that the influence of God is needed to achieve the proposed
transformation

> Through the power released by these exalted words He
> hath lent a fresh impulse, and set a new direction, to
> the birds of men's hearts. (GWB 95)
The Declaration only mentions the activities on the side of
man, like prayer, meditation and positive thinking, but does
not mention that this is futile unless it is based on a Revelation
of God, as the Catholic theologian Küng well knew. Prayer and
meditation does not originate in the human condition, and
man cannot elevate himself towards the Divine. This power to
address the Creator in prayer does not come from the creation.
It is a gift, a token of God’s grace to man. Bahá’u’lláh clearly
expressed the impossibility of the “birds of the human heart” to
achieve this task, i.e., to be able to reach God, when He said:

> How can I make mention of Thee, assured as I am that
> no tongue, however deep its wisdom, can befittingly
> magnify Thy name, nor can the bird of the human
> heart, however great its longing, ever hope to ascend
> into the heaven of Thy majesty and knowledge. (GWB 3)
In the following passage taken from the beginning of the
Seven Valleys, Bahá’u’lláh expressed in poetic language, and in
reference to the Qur’án and the Imám ‘Alí, the thought that the
prayer is originated in the heart by the Fear of God and as a
fruit of memory of the lost paradise, which is approached when
one walks in the Path of God, i.e., follow the Revelation of the
Manifestations.

> Of this hath the nightingale of oneness sung in the
> garden of Ghawthíyih [Sermon by Ali] He saith: “And
> there shall appear upon the tablet of thine heart a
> writing of the subtle mysteries of 'Fear God and God
> will give you knowledge'; [Qur'án 2:282] and the bird of
> thy soul shall recall the holy sanctuaries of preexistence
> and soar on the wings of longing in the heaven of 'walk
> the beaten paths of thy Lord', [Qur'án 16:71.] and gather

> the fruits of communion in the gardens of ‘Then feed
> on every kind of fruit.’ (SFV 3)
It is not unimportant to keep this in mind, because in the
New Age Movement of today it is contended that man can, by
his own power through mediation and spiritual development,
reach an access to the Divine. This was most powerfully
presented by Ken Wilber and can be called spiritual
materialism, where the human power can by itself reach
towards God, or what Wilber calls the “World Soul” or “God
or Goddess.” This basically materialistic understanding of the
world, which is presented in transcendental psychology, is
expressed by Wilber in the following sentence:

> And every I becomes a God, and every WE becomes
> God’s sincerest worship, and every IT becomes God’s
> temple. 15
Therefore, in this view, it is not God Who is transcendent,
but the human psyche can transcend this world by higher forms
of reason and mediation. This thought was further developed
in a previous paper by this writer.16

God as Ultimate Reality

Here again the Declaration presents the truth very cautiously
and avoids calling God by any name, but replaces this concept
with the term “ultimate reality”. Hans Küng explains that this
was necessary in order to not offend the Buddhist Religion,
which does not talk about God but acknowledges a
transcendent reality towards which we strive.

> As religious and spiritual persons we base our lives on
> an Ultimate Reality, and draw spiritual power and
> hope therefrom, in trust, in prayer or meditation, in
> word or silence. (DGE 19)
It is interesting that the Bahá’í Faith can easily accept this
formulation as the Bahá’í writings clearly state that the essence
of God is unknowable and inaccessible:

> God in His Essence and in His own Self hath ever been
> unseen, inaccessible, and unknowable. (ESW 118)

There are many statements explaining this fact and
consequently the term “ultimate reality,” for what is usually
called God, fits this understanding. Again as before, the Bahá’í
Faith insists that all assistance in delivering mankind from its
state of grievous abasement comes from the Hand of Divine
power and not from prayer and meditation alone as the
Declaration seems to insinuate.

> We cherish the hope that the Hand of Divine power
> may lend its assistance to mankind, and deliver it from
> its state of grievous abasement. (GWB 93)

The Bahá’í Understanding of Religious Unity

The Bahá’í Faith asserts the unity of all religions and the
unity of all the Prophets and Founders of the major world
religions, calling them the Manifestations of God for their
time. They renew the one religion of God by restating,
updating and presenting again the fundamental verities of all
of God’s religions, as well as changing, promoting and
adjusting the moral rules to the time, considering the changes
in the evolution of mankind. This is expressed by ‘Abdu’l-Bahá:

> They establish a new religion and make new creatures of
> men; They change the general morals, promote new
> customs and rules, renew the cycle and the Law. (SAQ
> 164)

‘Abdu’l-Bahá distinguishes between Founders of religions
like Buddha and philosophers who renew the morals of their
time like Confucius:

> Buddha also established a new religion, and Confucius
> renewed morals and ancient virtues, but their
> institutions have been entirely destroyed. (SAQ 165)
‘Abdu’l-Bahá in the following passage (SWA 15.7) opens up the
vision of unity in this world which has as its center the unity of
religion. He describes the process of unification in the picture
of the light of seven candles, saying “Behold how its light is now
dawning upon the world’s darkened horizon.” Talking about
these seven candles of light, the unity of religion takes the
center place as the fourth candle, which can be compared to the

arrangement of the Seven Valleys of Bahá’u’lláh, where the
Valley of Unity is the fourth of seven valley as well. ‘Abdu’l-
Bahá gives this unity the place of a cornerstone, stating:

> The fourth candle is unity in religion, which is the
> cornerstone of the foundation itself, and which, by the
> power of God, will be revealed in all its splendor. (SWA
> 15.7)

The first three candles present “unity in the political realm”,
“unity of thought in world undertakings,” and “unity in
freedom which will surely come to pass.”

The fifth candle after the unity of religion is “unity of
nations,” which unity will be “causing all the peoples of the
world to regard themselves as citizens of one common
fatherland.” The sixth candle is “unity of races, making of all
that dwell on earth peoples and kindreds of one race,” and the
final candle is described as “unity of language, i.e., the choice
of a universal tongue in which all peoples will be instructed and
converse.”

This arrangement indicates that unity of religion is the
centerpiece or cornerstone of all unity, it does not give us a
timeline, and describes these unifications rather as a process
“now dawning upon the world’s darkened horizon.”
He concludes with this statement indicating that

> Each and every one of these will inevitably come to
> pass, inasmuch as the power of the Kingdom of God
> will aid and assist in their realization. (SWA 31-32)
In this verse He seemingly refers to the progress and the
evolution of humanity, asserting that this progress will happen
as prophesied by Jesus in the Lord’s Prayer. (Matthew 6:10)

> Thy kingdom come, Thy will be done in earth, as it is in
> heaven.
The question arises: How does this relate to the contention
made in this paper that the first step towards a unity of
religion will be in the area of ethics, as anticipated by the
Declaration Towards a Global Ethic? As it has been mentioned
above, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, while not mentioning ethics in this

enumeration of progressive unification of the world, has
stated the following about the Founders of the world’s
religions, which is a statement of ethics, of making men new
creatures and changing general morals by new customs and
rules:

> They establish a new religion and make new creatures of
> men; They change the general morals, promote new
> customs and rules, renew the cycle and the Law. (SAQ
> 164)

This change of morals has to be understood as a renewal and
improvement in the area of ethics that every Manifestation has
promoted. One could compare it as the growing of a tree from
insignificant seeds to an ever growing, fully developed
structure. In the same way has the ethic of the different
religions been growing, has been adjusted to the development
of man, and therefore all these ethical principles of different
religions are building a complete structure that can today be
described as a global ethic. This is the value of this Declaration
for all religions, so that they can compare and agree upon these
general principles and become increasingly united through these
considerations.

There are differences in particular ethical statements
between different religions, but it can be assumed that these
differences are manmade. For example, in Islam it is generally
allowed to disavow one’s faith in order to save oneself, while in
Christianity and in the Bahá’í Faith, this is not allowed, and the
death of the believer as a martyr could sometimes be the
outcome of this ethical principle.

How will unification of religions come about?

The Declaration raises some warning signs about a possible
unification of religions and states clearly what it could not be
(emphasis in the original):

> By a global ethic we do not mean a global ideology nor
> a single unified religion beyond all existing religion,
> and certainly not the domination of one religion over
> all others. By a global ethic we mean a fundamental

> consensus on binding values, irrevocable standards
> and personal attitudes.
What kind of misunderstanding has to be excluded from this
global ethic or in any unification of religion? The four possible
principles are excluded as leading to a real unity in ethic
understanding and even more significantly in religion.

Triumphalism

The Declaration clearly states that any form of triumphalism
does not lead to a unity of religion, when it said:

> By a global ethic we do not mean a global ideology or a
> single unified religion beyond all existing religions, and
> certainly not the domination of one religion over all
> others. (GE 21)

Eclecticism

This is another form of attempted unification that picks
and chooses parts from the different religions and attempts to
form a unified religion, missing the essential of what religion
is. This would be like picking the best from all religions and
making a combination thereof (Supermarket or Smorgasbord
of Religions).

Collectivism

When unity is misunderstood as uniformity the result would
be a system of collective control and uniformity of all religions
in a global ideology. In the last century, several ideologies have
tried this approach and the world is still suffering from these
attempts. At the turn of the last century two books described
this process. A. N. Wilson in “God’s Funeral”17 describes the
increasing atheism during the last two centuries, and Mark
Mazower in “Dark Continent”18 describes Europe as a
nightmarish laboratory for social and political engineering,
explaining fascism and communism as the ideological struggle
for Europe’s future.

Minimalism

This principle is best described by Unitarian Universalist
Association (UUA), founded in 1961 as a consolidation of the
American Unitarian Association and the Universalist Church
in America. While the certain laudable attempt “to achieve free
and responsible search for truth and meaning” is pursued, the
result is a minimalistic acceptance of everything without
guidance and without a discernable goal.

The Unity of Religion in the Bahá’í Faith

Shoghi Effendi (WOB 57) responds to these attempts of
unification in a lengthy passage, stating the following about
the unity of religions:

> Let no one, however, mistake my purpose. The
> Revelation, of which Bahá’u’lláh is the source and
> center, abrogates none of the religions that have
> preceded it, nor does it attempt, in the slightest degree,
> to distort their features or to belittle their value.
> It disclaims any intention of dwarfing any of the
> Prophets of the past, or of whittling down the eternal
> verity of their teachings.
> It can, in no wise, conflict with the spirit that
> animates their claims, nor does it seek to undermine
> the basis of any man's allegiance to their cause.
These sentences clearly explain how the Bahá’í Faith
understands the unity of religion as not at all based on
abrogating, dwarfing or undermining any of the existing
religions of the world. The opposite is true. Shoghi Effendi
declares here that it is the purpose of the Bahá’í Faith to enable
the followers of all religions to understand their own religion
more fully:

> Its declared, its primary purpose is to enable every
> adherent of these Faiths to obtain a fuller
> understanding of the religion with which he stands
> identified, and to acquire a clearer apprehension of its
> purpose.

This will exclude a superficial eclecticism, as well as any
arrogant triumphalism:

> It is neither eclectic in the presentation of its truths,
> nor arrogant in the affirmation of its claims.
This understanding is based on a new understanding of
religion and of the fundamental unity of all religions and their
historical evolution, claiming that Divine Revelation is
progressive, not final.

> Its teachings revolve around the fundamental principle
> that religious truth is not absolute but relative, that
> Divine Revelation is progressive, not final.

Summarizing this explanation he states the fundamental unity
of all religions in origin, aim, function and purpose:

> Unequivocally and without the least reservation it
> proclaims all established religions to be divine in
> origin, identical in their aims, complementary in their
> functions, continuous in their purpose, indispensable
> in their value to mankind.
Contrasting his understanding of religious unity with
previous attempts described above, which have had devastating
effects on society, the Guardian here indicates how this unity
can come about, and describes that this is already seminally
practiced in the Bahá’í Faith:

> Far from wishing to add to the number of the religious
> systems, whose conflicting loyalties have for so many
> generations disturbed the peace of mankind, this Faith
> is instilling into each of its adherents a new love for,
> and a genuine appreciation of the unity underlying, the
> various religions represented within its pale. (WOB 196)
The unity of religion cannot come from any external,
artificial, or political and diplomatic process: it has to come
from a new understanding of what religion is, and of a vision
that finds the underlying unity of all religious. Can it not be
said that the first inkling of such a new vision can be observed
in the attempts made by the Parliament of Religions, which was
expressed in the Declaration Towards a Global Ethic?

Towards a Bahá’í Ethic

In a prayer Bahá’u’lláh has given us an indication where this
unity will lead humanity. After the initial praise of God,
Bahá’u’lláh expresses that those “who have recognized Thy
[God’s] reality” … “can never hope to pass beyond the bounds,
which … have been fixed in their own hearts.” He further
explains that “every created thing hath recognized its own
impotence, and the power of Thy might, and hath confessed its
own abasement and Thy great glory.”

Having clarified here, as in many other places, the impotence
of human reason to reach to God, He declares what access God
has given humankind to know Him and to worship Him, by
referring to God’s Firstness and Lastness which is identical to
His Revelation and Concealment. This understanding will then,
as a gift to the believers, allow them to reveal this truth about
God to all creatures by becoming manifest signs of God’s
grace, and by following the Path of God.

> I beseech Thee by Thy Lastness which is the same as Thy
> Firstness, and by Thy Revelation which is identical
> with Thy Concealment, to grant that they who are dear
> to Thee, and their children, and their kindred, may
> become the revealers of Thy purity amidst Thy
> creatures, and the manifestations of Thy sanctity
> amongst Thy servants. (PM 229)
In another place Bahá’u’lláh has more clearly spoken about
these four states of man and how they relate to God. What is
here called Firstness and Lastness, Revelation and
Concealment, is in the Four Valleys called Firstness and
Lastness, Outwardness and Inwardness, as explained in a
previous paper of this author.19

In the same Tablet of the Four Valleys, Bahá’u’lláh speaks
about the four journeys in the Pathways of Love, describing the
Path of God in this fourfold structure. A brief prayer of the
Báb, which was highly recommended by Bahá’u’lláh, completes
this structure as is being pointed out in the following picture.
When we put these four fourfold statements together in this
arrangement, the basic structure of life, especially of life as the
Path of God, becomes transparent. This view can be regarded

as an attempt to formulate a Bahá’í Ethic based on the human
essence as described in the Revelation of Bahá’u’lláh.

The below presented figure consists of three statements of
the Bahá’í Writings and one collection of four basic Bahá’í
concepts, which are here presented first as they appear in the
Writings and are below combined in the figure of four
quadrants.

The framework for this figure is taken from Bahá’u’lláh’s
descriptions in the Seven Valleys (SVFV 27) of “these four states”
that are “true of thyself” and “conferred upon thee:”

Inwardness — Outwardness

Firstness — Lastness

Four basic concepts of Bahá’í Life are in the top of each of the
four squares:

Prayer — Unity
Service — Order

Below this are the four statements from the Báb’s “Remover of
Difficulty” Prayer (SWB 216):

Praised be God — He is God
All Are His servants — All abide by His bidding

The last are the four statements of Bahá’u’lláh’s Journeys in the
Pathway of Love (SVFV 25):

> Creature to True One — True One to True One
> True One to Creature — Creature to Creature

This figure is based on four statements from the Bahá’í
Scriptures, which are here unified and organized as a whole, in
an attempt to better understand these statements in the
context of each other. All of these statements have the same
structure: they consist of four quadrants, each of them
consisting of a pair of oppositional concepts that are united
and set against another pair of oppositional concepts. In a
sense this can be understood as an ontological principle of the
created world, and examples of this structure can be found in
Bahá’í Scripture in many places. It is understood by this writer
as an expression of what Shoghi Effendi calls, in several places,
the watchword of the Bahá’í Faith: “Its watchword is unity in
diversity such as ‘Abdu’l-Bahá Himself has explained” (WOB 42):

In the following, these four different quadrants will be
explicated towards a Bahá’í Ethic. Several issues need to be
clarified before the quadrants can be explored by themselves in
their practical meaning towards the ethical behavior of people

in the Path of God. These guidelines apply, not only to Bahá’ís,
but to people of all religions in their honest attempt to travel
this Straight Path according to the directions of their Prophets
or Manifestations.

First: What are these quadrants, and what do the different
statements in them mean in relation to each other, i.e., being
differentiated from and united with each other?

Second: How to they relate to each other on an essential or
ontological level?

And, third: How do they relate to the actual ethical behavior
of the individual, to any organization, from family to nation
to humanity, or to the world as a whole.

Since it is not very difficult to find more quadruple
statements of the same structure in other Bahá’í writings, there
must be a special meaning to this arrangement. This writer
almost accidentally found the first of these statements after
reading the books of Ken Wilber, who has a similar structure
on the basis of his integral understanding of human nature and
of the world. In a previous paper of this writer20, he described
what this surprising correspondence might mean and how the
Wilberian concept needs to be extended and improved when
applied to concepts used in the Bahá’í Writings.

The four quadrants are formed by the framework of the
statements of Bahá’u’lláh in the Seven Valleys (SVFV 27) and can
be described as follows:

> 1. Inwardness and Firstness
> 2. Inwardness and Lastness
> 3. Outwardness and Firstness
> 4. Outwardness and Lastness
With Inwardness the Spiritual, the Hidden, the Concealed is
expressed; with Outwardness its opposite, the Material, the
Manifest and the Revealed is indicated. The opposition
between hidden and manifest, or inward and outward, or
concealed and revealed, is what in today’s parlance is called the
opposition between spiritual and material. What needs to be

repeated here is that both sides of these opposing concepts are
seen not only as opposing each other but at the same time as
forming a unity, which is expressed in the next paragraph where
Bahá’u’lláh states that in the sphere of that which is relative,
i.e., in the created world, these concepts are separated because
of the limitation of men. On the other hand Bahá’u’lláh affirms
that those who have passed over the world of the relative and
the limited have burned away these relativities. They will then
swim in the sea of the spirit and soar in the holy air of light. In
this vision, in this realm, the first is the last itself, and the last
is but the first.

> These statements are made in the sphere of that which is
> relative, because of the limitations of men. Otherwise,
> those personages who in a single step have passed over
> the world of the relative and the limited, and dwelt on
> the fair plane of the Absolute, and pitched their tent in
> the worlds of authority and command — have burned
> away these relativities with a single spark, and blotted
> out these words with a drop of dew. And they swim in
> the sea of the spirit, and soar in the holy air of light.
> Then what life have words, on such a plane, that “first”
> and “last” or other than these be seen or mentioned! In
> this realm, the first is the last itself, and the last is but
> the first. (SVFV 27)
This can be understood as implying that in this world of the
relative and limited, where unity is created from the
unification of parts and where the parts are constituted
through the whole which they form, the world has to be seen in
these oppositions, while from a higher perspective, these
oppositions fall together in an integrated unity. There is not
only a unity in the opposing concepts, like first and last, as
Bahá’u’lláh explains: because the same person is first to his son
and last to his father, in the same way hidden and manifest has
to be seen as belonging to both and at the same time to every
individual person, animal, plant or thing.

The whole creation is also always both, spirit and matter,
hidden and manifest, concealed and revealed, first and last,
individual and collective. And yet, from a spiritual point of
view, these oppositions are again forming a higher unity, and

therefore Bahá’u’lláh can say that first is the last and last is the
first — or the often repeated phrase, that God is the most
hidden of the hidden and the most manifest of the manifest. At
the end of this statement in the Seven Valleys, Bahá’u’lláh
reaches in the area of the mystical, and therefore He quotes
from the Mathnaví of the great mystic, Jalálu’d-Dín Rúmí
(1207-1273 A.D.) the following verse, combining this spiritual
vision with love and the fire of ecstasy, which will burn all
limitations and relativities of this world:

> In thy soul of love build thou a fire
> And burn all thoughts and words entire. (SVFV 27)
When later these quadrants are applied to the ethical
behavior on the Path of God, this unity of the opposites must
never be forgotten. Consequently it is explained by Bahá’u’lláh
that prayer and service have the same value, even though, one,
the prayer, belongs to the inward and hidden aspect of this
world, while, the other, service clearly belongs to the manifest
and material action of a person. And this is true of all the
quadrants. None has a prerogative or priority in the relative
world of ethical action; only in the unity of these aspects is the
spiritual nature of the world manifest.

It is clear from many statements of the Writings that this is
not only a practical and ethical principle, but it is a
constituent and fundamental aspect of the created world, the
world of limitation and relativity. If the four quadrants are
explicated in the realm of ethics and are describing the Path of
God, these three principles need always to be kept in mind.

The Four Quadrants, Possible Cornerstones of a Bahá’í
Ethic

In the following the four quadrants will be described
separately, with their spiritual unity taken into account. This
is a brief description of what could be an extensive outline
towards the development of a future Bahá’í Ethic. Obviously, a
more extensive outline is not possible in the frame of this
paper. What is here presented is more of a description of basic
principles that could be the basis of a Bahá’í Ethic if it stands

the test of time and consultation. Therefore it has to be
regarded as containing tentative and prospective suggestions
for further studies.

Prayer

This is the title of the left upper quadrant which is framed by
the concepts of inwardness or concealment and firstness or
individuality. In this quadrant the focus is on the personal and
individual life of man. It is what we would call the spiritual
and the religious aspect of man. Usually, the concept of soul is
placed in this area, but it needs to be expanded. Because soul is
not restricted to this area, it is really establishing the unity of
all of these four quadrants. The soul is in all of them and is a
single reality, as Bahá’u’lláh clearly states:

> Say: Spirit, mind, soul, and the powers of sight and
> hearing are but one single reality which hath manifold
> expressions owing to the diversity of its instruments.

(SLH 155)

The soul is differentiated only by the instruments it uses. In
other words, the soul of man must be in all four spheres, and
cannot be restricted to one aspect of man.

In this quadrant we place the statement of the Báb’s prayer
“Praised be God” and it is related to the statement of the
journeys on the pathway of love as being from the “Creature to
the True One”. From this inner aspect of the person, the prayer
is directed to the True One in a very individual and personal
process of elevating the heart in love to God. The statement of
the fifth Arabic Hidden Word fits this intention:

> 5. O SON OF BEING!
> Love Me, that I may love thee. If thou lovest Me not,
> My love can in no wise reach thee. Know this, O
> servant. (AHW)
This love is expressed in the praise of God, that is, the
correct approach of the creature to the True One. Prayer in the
love of God is not only a fountain of living waters for the one,
who prays, attracting the love of God; it furthermore
announces the message of the loving God in every world of

God’s worlds. Prayer has not only global reach, but a truly
cosmic significance, as stated in a prayer of Bahá’u’lláh:

> Make my prayer, O my Lord, a fountain of living
> waters whereby I may live as long as Thy sovereignty
> endureth, and may make mention of Thee in every
> world of Thy worlds. (PM 318)
Prayer, while individual and personal, is not limited in its
meaning to the individual, but its goal is to mention God in
every world of Thy worlds, that is, in the whole creation of
God. Therefore, it is not restricted to the individual, in the
sense of excluding others. It must be connected with the other
three quadrants as well; it goes out from the individual but
encompasses all. It must include and will attract all of
humanity and the entire world, affecting all four quadrants. By
causing the heart of every righteous man to throb the prayer
said in the privacy his chamber influences and elevates, “these
four states” that are “true of thyself” and “conferred upon thee
(SVFV 27) i.e., all the four quadrants in the above picture. The
following words of Bahá’u’lláh need to be understood in this
context:

> Intone, O My servant, the verses of God that have been
> received by thee, as intoned by them who have drawn
> nigh unto Him, that the sweetness of thy melody may
> kindle thine own soul, and attract the hearts of all men.
> Whoso reciteth, in the privacy of his chamber, the
> verses revealed by God, the scattering angels of the
> Almighty shall scatter abroad the fragrance of the
> words uttered by his mouth, and shall cause the heart
> of every righteous man to throb. (GWB 295)

Unity

Unity is the next quadrant; it is related to inwardness and
concealment like prayer, but it is formulated in the area of
lastness or collective. Before going into details of this
quadrant, it can easily be seen that it is closely connected with
the previous quadrant, with prayer. The fact that there is no
official congregational prayer in the Bahá’í Faith becomes clear
from this distinction. The Prayer for the Dead is the only

exception to this rule, and it is related to a specific and
manifest occasion. Otherwise Bahá’u’lláh has abrogated all
official community prayers of prior religions. Prayer is
restricted to the individual and does not belong in this
quadrant. This does not exclude the fact that people can pray
together; it only means that there is no distinctive different
value to such prayers; it is not an official prayer any different
than the individual prayer. When Bahá’ís pray together they
pray to God as individuals, not as a church with official
priests or leaders of this prayer.

While, as mentioned before, all quadrants have to be seen in
a mystical unity, this quadrant is exclusively dedicated to the
unity of humankind, to the unity of all Manifestations and
ultimately to the Unity of God. Therefore it corresponds to the
statement of the Báb’s prayer He is God and to the journey on
the Pathway of Love stating from the True One to True One,
indicating that the unity of God can only be seen in the unity
of the Manifestations.

Considering this from the point of view that all quadrants
are unified on a higher spiritual and mystical level, we can state
here as an ethical principle, that any prayer to God, which is
not carried by the spirit of Unity of humanity and of all
Manifestations, becomes defective and vice versa — that any
consideration of unity, be it the unity of family, nation, or
humanity, as well as the unity of all religions, can only be true
when based on the individual prayer and included in the praise
of God. This unity needs to be supported by individual service
and carried forward through the institutions to keep it in
order. Whenever a Bahá’í expresses the praise of God, all of the
religions and all of mankind must be included in this elevation
of the individual soul. Therefore, most Bahá’í prayers start
with this praise of God.

Service

Here we are in the area of Outwardness or that which is
revealed and seen. The other frame of this quadrant is the
aspect of firstness and of the individual. Certainly, service and
work are material efforts, can be seen, can be rewarded
materially and promote civilization.

Again considering the unity of all quadrants, work does not
acquire the status of service if it is not directed towards unity,
towards promotion of humanity and its civilization. This
direction has to include the personal spiritual life of the
servant; otherwise it would be only an external exercise. It is
becoming evident how these quadrants support, promote and
undergird each other.

In the “The Remover of Difficulties,” prayer of the Báb, this
is clearly expressed by the statement: All are His servants.
Service is His service. The journeys in the pathway of love bring
another aspect into this consideration. When combined with
prayer service, is described as From the True One to the
Creatures. Generally, this is not how we think. We regard any
service, any job, as our achievement, as our own effort and
would not see it as something that comes from God to the
creature. Let’s consider what Bahá’u’lláh expresses in the
following statement:

> The tie of servitude established between the worshiper
> and the adored One, between the creature and the
> Creator, should in itself be regarded as a token of His
> gracious favor unto men, and not as an indication of
> any merit they may possess. (GWB 193)
What is this tie of servitude between the Creator and the
creature? Primarily it is the duty prescribed to God’s servant to
extol His majesty and glory, in other words, to praise God, as
this verse of Bahá’u’lláh clearly expresses:

> Whatever duty Thou hast prescribed unto Thy servants
> of extolling to the utmost Thy majesty and glory is but
> a token of Thy grace unto them, that they may be
> enabled to ascend unto the station conferred upon
> their own inmost being, the station of the knowledge
> of their own selves. (GWB 4)
But must not this bond of servitude be extended to all
service of man? Is not all of human work a service in praise of
God? And does not the statement above clarify that service is
not an indication of any merit for the servant? It is a token of
the grace of God that alone makes it meritorious and valuable
for man.

Service has to be seen as a token of God’s grace, as a gift to
allow us to ascend to a higher station of the self. The example
of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá certainly gives testimony to that kind of
spiritual progress. Another consideration can help us
understand this ethical principle. Today’s unemployed would
certainly see it as a gift if somebody gave them a job. So a
person, who has not been given the gift of service from God, is
like a beggar, a useless member of society who fails to reach the
inmost value of being human.

Order

This fourth quadrant is dominated by its outwardness and
lastness or collectiveness. It is the order which has to make
unity manifest in this material world. This is the reason why
the administrative order of the Bahá’í Faith is not a worldly and
unimportant aspect of life, but is equally important as prayer,
spiritual unity and service. An administrative order must be
based on all of these aspects of life; otherwise it will not
function well. When electing the administrative institutions,
prayer and knowledge of the community are required, so the
election becomes an essential aspect of the Bahá’í life.

When we consider the many things the Guardian says about
the World Order of Bahá’u’lláh, and especially his statement
that we cannot know how it will look in the future, it becomes
quite clear that only if all of these four quadrants are verified in
society can this administrative order be fashioned. This is the
ultimate goal of the new world order.

In such an order and civilization the “Remover of
Difficulties” prayer of the Báb will be fulfilled because: All
abide by His bidding, and this order and structure will be what
the creatures will give to the creatures as expressed in that
journeys on the pathway of love, creating a humanity that is
unified, at peace and animated by the individual’s prayers, by
the spiritual unity of mankind and promoted by the service of
all.

Towards a Bahá’í Ethic

It is hoped that this combination and structure imminent in
the Bahá’í Writings will not only allow us to look into the
future of the Bahá’í commonwealth, but give us a guideline on
the Path of God, make this the Straight Path, the True Path, and
lead mankind to the Most Great Peace. Individually, it could be
stated that we must learn to see all aspects of life as this Path of
God; we cannot exclude or separate the material, the
administrative, the unity of mankind and everyday service and
prayer from this path.

Whenever someone believes they are “living the life” as a
Bahá’ís, yet overlook this total integration of all aspects of the
human being, they are in danger of going astray. Some signs of
these errors are the following:
o Words, thoughts and even prayers that do not include

all, but separate and exclude others.
o Scientific pursuits fall into this category if they

> overlook the organic structure of the Faith, if they are
> not executed in the service of the community, or if
> they disrupt the harmony between science and
> religion.
o Individual actions, which are not coordinated with

> the administrative order, even community action
> following other than these principles, will not
> promote the fourfold structure of the Path of God.
o Believers, who are not in touch with the ethical

> principles of the Faith and do not accept the guidance
> of their assemblies, place themselves outside of the
> community in some way. Not in every case will that
> behavior deprive them of their voting rights, but it
> could well deprive them of the spiritual connection
> with the Faith.
On the other hand the administrative organs of the Faith can
never forget that the unity they need to promote is a unity in
diversity, and everybody has to be respected and valued in their
individual ability and nature. Only when both the individual
and the community aspect of the Bahá’í Cause are respected

and find a living harmony, can the New World Order of
Bahá’u’lláh be realized in the future.

We have to be cautious not to be one-sided, we have to
constantly redirect our efforts, and this is only possible if we
continuously dive into the Ocean of His Words and make the
Bahá’í Scripture the compass of all ethical striving.
