> **Abstract:** This article is a legal commentary on the lawsuit _Yacovelli v. Moeser,_ filed in 2002 (in the wake of the 9/11 terrorist attacks) by a conservative Christian organization, against the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, over its academic orientation program, requiring incoming UNC freshmen to read and discuss selected, translated passages from the Qur’an, the holy book of Islam. As a perspective on the academic and legal rationale for teaching the Qur’an in public universities (without violating the First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution), this article provides a brief introduction to the Qur’an, its world-historical significance, history of its revelation, collection, and editing, its salient themes, as well as academic vs. traditional approaches to the study of the Qur’an. This is followed by a review of Michael Sells’s _Approaching the Qur’an,_ legal analysis of _Yacovelli v. Moeser,_ highlights of parallel cases, and conclusion.

The Constitutionality of Teaching

> Islam: The University of North
Carolina Qur’an Controversy1

christopher buck

Introduction

> THE terrorist events of 9/11 sparked public interest in Islam across the
> U.S. The attacks riveted world attention on Islam (albeit radical
Islamism). Sales of the Qur’an and texts on Islam skyrocketed.

To truly understand Islam, one should begin with the Qur’an, the
> holy book of Islam. Although there are at least five distinct “responses
> to modernity” in the Muslim world today,2 one starts with the Qur’an
> in the same way that reading the Bible is necessary to understand
> Christianity. The study of the Qur’an at the university level is a hot
> topic. One national academic and legal controversy in particular has
> raised a number of legal and pedagogical issues in academic settings. In
> summer 2002, the University of North Carolina (UNC) at Chapel
> Hill initially required incoming freshmen, as part of its Summer
> Reading Program, to read and discuss Michael Sells’s Approaching the
> Qur’an: The Early Revelations.3 This text, a fresh translation and eluci-
> dation of the early Makkan surahs of the Qur’an, was recommended
> by UNC Islamicist Carl Ernst to promote an understanding of Islam,
> especially in the wake of the events surrounding the 9/11 terrorist
attacks.4

Alleging that UNC violated the Establishment Clause of the First
Amendment and abridged students’ rights to free exercise of religion

christopher buck

> by obliging incoming freshmen and transfer students to study Islam
> against their will, a conservative-Christian activist group, the Family
> Policy Network (FPN), filed suit in the U.S. District Court, Middle
> District of North Carolina, on July 22, 2002, seeking a preliminary
> injunction to keep UNC from conducting its summer program. The
> case was captioned Yacovelli v. Moeser (after James Yacovelli, an FPN
> spokesman, and James Moeser, UNC Chancellor). When the FPN
> lost, it immediately appealed to the 4th Circuit Court of Appeals, but
> lost again. This case was widely reported,5 nationally and internation-
> ally, but was not judicially “reported;” that is, the district and appellate
decisions were not published.

As Sells commented: “Behind the lawsuit is an old missionary claim
> that Islam is a religion of violence in contrast to Christianity, a religion
> of peace. In effect, the plaintiffs are suing the Koran on behalf of the
> Bible.”6 While America was involved abroad in Afghanistan and Iraq
in the aftermath of 9/11, a clash of religions was occurring at home.

What the national press appears not to have covered yet is a later
> challenge filed in 2004, which also lost on appeal. The Court applied
> technicalities of the Lemon test along with the endorsement and coer-
> cion tests, and the challenge failed. In his decision, Chief Judge N.

Carlton Tilley, Jr. ruled:

> Approaching the Qur’an simply cannot be compared to religious practices
> that have been deemed violative of the Establishment Clause, such as post-
> ing the Ten Commandments, reading the Lord’s Prayer, or reciting
> prayers in school. The book does include surahs, which are similar to
> Christian Psalms. However, by his own words, the author endeavors only
> to explain Islam and not to endorse it. Furthermore, listening to Islamic
> prayers in an effort to understand the artistic nature of the readings and its
> connection to a historical religious text does not have the primary effect of
> advancing religion.7

> This ruling is consistent with the U.S. Supreme Court’s endorsement
> of the academic study of religion in public schools and universities,
> when Justice Tom C. Clark in 1963 declared, “one’s education is not
> complete without a study of comparative religion or the history of reli-
> gion and its relationship to the advancement of civilization.”8 The

The Constitutionality of Teaching Islam

> secular approach makes the academic study of religion constitutionally
> permissible: “Nothing we have said here indicates that such study of
> the Bible or of religion, when presented objectively as part of a secular
> program of education, may not be effected consistently with the First
Amendment.”9

Of course, this is purely dicta, but dicta are often construed as hold-
> ings by those outside the legal profession. As Justice Powell has said
> more recently: “Courses in comparative religion of course are custom-
> ary and constitutionally appropriate.”10 Based on Justice Clark’s state-
> ment as it applies to the Qur’an specifically, university officials now
> argue that, in addition to being constitutionally permissible, one’s educa-
> tion is not complete without a study of the Qur’an (as well as the history
of Islam) and its relationship to the advancement of civilization.11

Religion in general is a controversial topic within higher educa-
> tion, and demands inevitably arise to know why the Qur’an should (or
> even can) be taught in a state university. The situation in the U.S. has
> provoked legal discussions and challenges, chiefly: Does the study of
> the Qur’an in the University violate the Establishment Clause of the
> First Amendment by breaching the wall of separation of church and
> state? Academic experts in the study of religion think they know the
> answer, and for legal scholars the answer may be the same: Religion is a
> proper object of study, just like any other topic, but the explanations
may and do differ.

To gain a proper perspective on the rationale behind teaching the
> Qur’an in the University, this article provides an introduction to the
> Qur’an, its world-historical significance, a brief history of its revela-
> tion, collection, and editing, and its salient themes. This is followed by
> a review of Michael Sells’s Approaching the Qur’an, then a detailed
> analysis of the cases brought against the University of North Carolina
> at Chapel Hill, with a conclusion after a brief look at some parallel
> cases.

Introducing the Qur’an12

> The Qur’an, the holy book of Islam, may well be the most powerful
> book in human history, with the arguable exception of the Bible. Both

christopher buck

> in world history and contemporary affairs, it is doubtful that any other
> book now commands, or has in the past exerted, so profound an influ-
> ence. Objectively, one of every five people on earth today is Muslim,
> and thus subjectively believes the Qur’an supersedes the Bible, and
> that the Qur’an is unsurpassed. Since Muslims see Islam as the last of
> the world’s religions, they view the Qur’an as the latest and greatest
> book. Even if one does not share this view, the sheer magnitude of its
> influence commands respect, and one cannot be cross-culturally and
globally literate without some understanding of this monumental text.

The Qur’an is nothing less than an attempt to reorder civilization:
> to rescue it, Muslims would say, from the appetites and turpitude that
> threaten the moral fiber of human society. Islam offers to fill a spiritual
> vacuum to which western society has largely turned a blind eye.
> Islamic spirituality can be harmonized with the best of western –
> Christian as well as contemporary secular – traditions of civic virtues,
> moral decency, and family values, informed by the West’s traditional
> Judeo-Christian ethic. Just as the Ten Commandments are still rele-
> vant, the Qur’an still has much to say, although even some Muslims say
> it needs to be understood anew within the changed circumstances of
modernity and post-modernity.

The real heart of the Qur’an is its message. One useful way of
> approaching the Qur’an is to see it as the vehicle for expressing pro-
> found truths regarding God and the universe, and humankind and its
> civilizations. God is the creator, and humankind the created (physical-
> ly dependent) and the creative (morally independent). The themes of
> the Qur’an, therefore, are the organizing principles of Islamic religion
> and civilization. Whether the Qur’an is informed by previous sources
> is a vexing question. To suggest that the Qur’an somehow derives
> from predominantly Jewish or Christian sources is tantamount to dis-
> crediting the Qur’an as a document of revelation. For Muslims, the
> question should be the other way around. The Qur’an is the gold stan-
> dard of divine truth. Since it is pure and unadulterated, previous
> scriptures should be measured against the Qur’an, not the other way
around. Indeed, the Qur’an comprehends all previous scriptures.

Within itself, the Qur’an provides Muslims with a view of the
Bible. Mention is made of the “scrolls” of Abraham and Moses, the

The Constitutionality of Teaching Islam

> Tawr¥h (Torah) of Moses, the Zab‰r (usually understood as the Psalms)
> of David, and the InjÏl (Gospel) of Jesus, all conceived as direct revela-
> tion from God to the prophet concerned: “Surely we sent down the
> Torah wherein is guidance and light” (5:44); “And we sent, following
> in their footsteps, Jesus son of Mary, confirming the Torah before him;
> and we gave to him the Gospel, wherein is guidance and light” (5:46).
> In this way, these (and, by implication, all) previous scriptures are pic-
> tured within the revelatory and compositional image of the Qur’an
itself.

The Qur’an, Muslims believe, is a revelation from God, pure and
> simple, communicated through a series of revelations imparted to the
> Prophet Muhammad over the course of twenty-three lunar years.
> Thus, it would be error and sacrilege to speak of Muhammad as the
> “author” of the Qur’an. Furthermore, to say that Muhammad was
> “influenced” by his religious world and that the Qur’an is a hodge-
> podge of intermixed influences is not only highly reductionist, but also
> suggests that the Prophet, not God, was himself the author of the
> Qur’an. The tension between traditional Muslim and western aca-
> demic approaches is perhaps nowhere more intense than on this issue.
> Theologically, to concede that the Qur’an is a text revealed by God is
to obligate a believer in God to abide by it.

Just as the Qur’an cannot be read from cover to cover in quite the
> same way that one reads a novel or a textbook, the Qur’an was not
> written from cover to cover. Just as writers have flashes of inspiration,
> Muhammad experienced flashes of revelation. These cumulatively
> became the Qur’an. Tradition is unanimous that Gabriel was the agent
> of revelation, even though he is mentioned only twice in the Qur’an
> and such a role is never explicitly given to him. The Qur’an itself
> explains how God reveals: “It belongs not to any mortal that God
> should speak to him, except by revelation, or from behind a veil, or
> that He should send a messenger and he reveal whatsoever He will, by
> His leave; surely He is All-high, All-wise” (42:51). In other words,

> sudden and unpremeditated, although Muhammad’s revelations were
sustained for over two decades.

The Qur’an itself claims that it is modeled on an archetypal law^
> ma^f‰·, or “preserved tablet” (85:22), having been sent down to the
> nearest heaven on the “night of power” (surah 97) in the holy month
> of Ramadan, for Gabriel to transmit it to Muhammad. The text of the
> Qur’an is from God, Muslims believe, while the recording and editing
> of the Qur’an is by men. It is important to understand the implications
> of the Qur’an being originally revealed over a period of time, and
thereafter collected and edited.

It was Muhammad’s practice to meditate prayerfully in a cave on
> Mount Hira. He was practicing some sort of pious exercise (ta^annuth)
> when he first encountered a mysterious entity later identified as the
> archangel Gabriel, who revealed the Qur’an to him over the next
> twenty-three years. The hadith literature provides many anecdotes as
> to how revelations would come upon Muhammad. The descriptions
> vary. Gabriel, the agent of revelation, taught Muhammad to recite the
> first passages of the Qur’an. Most frequently, the accounts speak of
> revelations “descending” upon Muhammad, such that he would hear
> the sound of buzzing, or of bells, or would feel a great weight come
> upon him, or would enter a trance, after which the words of the
> Qur’an would become indelibly inscribed in his heart, and subse-
> quently dictated to scribes. The revelations of the Qur’an were first
> recorded by scribes who wrote down the verses on whatever writing
> materials were available: leaves and branches of palm trees, white
> stones, leather, shoulder blades of sheep, ribs. One early account states
> that a revelation was actually eaten by a domestic animal, because it had
been recorded on something organic and edible.

After Muhammad’s death in 632 CE, there was no authoritative
> record of the revelations. They had to be collected. The process of
> assembling, collating, and codifying the Qur’an was not informed by a
> great deal of available information as to dating and other historical
> information on which to base the traditional form the Qur’an eventu-
> ally took. According to tradition, the decision to preserve the Qur’an
> was taken after hundreds of reciters were killed in Battle of Yam¥mah
> (12/633). ¢Umar (who was to become the second Caliph) suggested

The Constitutionality of Teaching Islam

> to Ab‰ Bakr that the Qur’an be collected and written down. Zayd ibn
> Th¥bit, one of Muhammad’s secretaries, was commissioned to do so.
> He wrote it on sheets (|u^uf), handed it to ¢Umar when completed,
> then passed it to the caliph’s daughter. Finally, the text was fixed under
> ¢Uthm¥n, in dialect of the Quraysh tribe (that of Muhammad), said to
> be the clearest of dialects, according to tradition. Where difficulties in
> establishing the text arose, the Quraysh dialect was given preference.
> Written texts required attestation from reciters, who had heard and
> memorized the Qur’an by heart. Thus, the canon of the Qur’an was
> fixed around twenty years after the Prophet’s death, as well as the order
> of the surahs and the integrity of the consonantal text. The vocalization
was not firmly established until around 300 years after Muhammad.

The urgency with which the text became fixed under the decree of
> Caliph ¢Uthm¥n afforded precious little opportunity for a systematic,
> much less “scientific,” ordering of the text. Its preservation was more
> important than its sequencing, and it was left to later Muslim scholars
> to provide a critical apparatus for more fully appreciating the pieces
> that made up the larger whole. How much editing and how intrusive
> or interpretive such editing may have been is largely a modern ques-
tion that has occupied much of western scholarship on the Qur’an.

Soon after the Qur’an was revealed, it spread like wildfire, racing
> with the Arab conquerors during the first two centuries of Arab expan-
> sion. The rapidity and breadth of that expansion was dramatic. At this
> stage, the Qur’an had not yet achieved its status as a world text, for the
> simple reason that it was considered an “Arab” book (or, rather, “the”
> Arab book, since the Qur’an is the first book in Arabic). Non-Arab
> converts were at first obliged to attach themselves to various Arab
tribes, in a kind of process of spiritual and social adoption.

Soon, non-Arabs, especially Persians, took umbrage with this.

> How could a scripture with a universal message, they argued, be
> restricted to just a single ethnicity? And, if not, on what grounds were
> Arabs justified in relegating to non-Arabs a secondary status, when the
> category of “Muslims” constitutes a spiritual and social “nation” that
> embraces all races and nations, yet transcends them? Was not the
> Prophet Abraham a Muslim (“one who surrenders” to the will of
> God)? And is not anyone who professes belief in the oneness of God

> and in the authenticity of the Prophet Muhammad to be accounted as a
> believer, on equal footing with every other? And so it came to be: the
> appeal to the Qur’an’s universalisms, expressive of its egalitarian ethic,
> prevailed. Thus Islam, although based on a message revealed in Arabic,
> was transposed to other cultures and climes, although it took centuries
> before the Qur’an itself was actually translated into other languages.
This singular revelation became a universal scripture.

In its final form, the Qur’an consists of 114 surahs, customarily
> arranged by the longest surah first, except for the short “opening”
> surah. Generally, a traditional dating of these surahs has emerged, with
> the so-called “early Makkan surahs” spanning the first thirteen lunar
> years (with Early, Middle, and Final periods), shifting to the period of
> “Madinan surahs” in 622, coinciding with the first year of the hijrah or
> migration of the early Muslim community from Makkah to Madinah,
> followed by the “Later Makkan surahs” on the Prophet’s triumphal
> return to his native city of Makkah shortly before the end of his life in
632.

Taking what has become Montgomery Watt’s classic, two-part
> division of Muhammad’s life, the early Makkan surahs exemplify
> Muhammad’s role as “Prophet” while the Madinan and later Makkan
> surahs present Muhammad’s vocation as “statesman.” Thus, the earlier
> revelations are intended to strike the fear of God into the heart of the
> listener by the promise of heaven and the threat of hell. Accordingly,
> the Prophet’s role is that of a “warner” who has come to make people
> alive to the threat of impending doom and death unless they repent and
surrender to the will of God.

First warned, later guided is the basic purpose of the revelations and
> the logic of their sequence. The later Qur’anic revelations enshrine
> laws and principles for Muslims to follow. Once a Muslim community
> had formed (the migration of Muslims to Makkah in 622 effectively
> created the first Muslim state), laws were needed. Accordingly,
> Muhammad became a statesman in addition to his role as prophet, and
> began revealing the laws and ethical principles that later became the
foundation for the Muslim schools of law and way of life.

As the recipient of revelation, the Prophet Muhammad was com-
missioned with a divine mission to present the Qur’an as the voice of

The Constitutionality of Teaching Islam

> God, calling the entire world to righteousness and justice, to morality
> and decency, to a life of prayer and fasting, and to surrender to the will
> of God. That Muhammad was commissioned with a divine mission
> does not make Muhammad himself divine, as the Qur’an itself states:
> “He would never order you to take the angels and the Prophets as
> Lords” (3:80). This idea may be seen in an early Christian text:
> “Neither is there salvation in believing in teachers and calling them
lords” (Homilies 8:5).

This concept of the Qur’an as a revealed scripture is basic to an
> appreciation of why Muslims both revere the Qur’an and orient their
> entire lives according to its dictates, for the Qur’an and the hadith (oral
> traditions that report the sayings and actions of the Prophet
> Muhammad) are the two principal sources of authority for Muslim
> doctrine and praxis. A deeper walk with God on the “straight path” of
> Islam can come about through spiritual growth and transformation.
How does one do this? What can serve as an infallible spiritual guide?

For Muslims, the way to bring one’s life into greater conformity
> with God’s will is to follow the laws of the Qur’an and the example of
> Muhammad. The truest sign of one’s transformative faith is conformi-
> ty and dedication to the principles and teachings of Islam that are
> preserved, first and foremost, in the Qur’an itself. The single most
> important act of piety is to surrender one’s own will to that of the will
> of God. The word “Muslim” means “one who has submitted” or
> committed themselves to the civilizing will of God. “Surrender” is not
> the best translation, because following God’s will is an act of free will, a
> vigilant choice, and a matter of strength through commitment and
practice.

Salvation then, for Muslims, consists of much more than simply
> being forgiven for one’s past sins and transgressions. The act of repen-
> tance itself affects much of this, and the true test of one’s sincerity is a
> matter of public record in terms of one’s actions. However, Islam sees a
> spiritual life beyond forgiveness. Salvation is not a change of status that
> magically and suddenly averts God’s wrath. Salvation is a process, a
refinement of one’s character over time.

A nineteenth-century mystic once said that the Qur’an eclipses all
of the miracles of all of the previous prophets, for the miracle of the

> Qur’an, alone, remains.13 That is to say the staff of Moses may have
> turned into a serpent and swallowed up the magicians’ snakes in
> Pharoah’s court, but that prophetic sceptre has vanished. Moses may
> well have parted the Red Sea, as Muslims themselves believe, but that
> prodigy is long gone. No empirical evidence of either miracle remains
> today. What alone abides is the “miracle” of the Qur’an – its prodi-
> gious ability to transform the lives of those who believe and accept the
> Qur’an as the best guide for their lives. This transformation is spiritual
> alchemy, taking the base appetites that most of us are born with and
> transmuting these into the pure gold of a refined moral and spiritual
> character. The Qur’an can transform a pair of horns into a set of wings,
> changing the pious believer from a devil into an angel. Such is the
> nature of Muslim belief about the Qur’an.

Approaching the Qur’an

> Reading the Qur’an is far easier said than done. The Qur’an is a chal-
> lenging text. To the uninitiated, the Book is both simplistic and
> enigmatic. To the untrained eye, the Qur’an, on first impression, may
> strike one as arcane, florid, repetitive, or otherwise impenetrable to
> westerners wholly unprepared to study the text dispassionately.
> However, there is a deeper hermeneutical issue involved, one of atti-
> tude and assumptions as to the authority and nature of the text. The
> Qur’an may be a difficult text for non-Muslims, but it is not unfath-
> omable. Sells’s Approaching the Qur’an has probably done more to
> render the Qur’an accessible to a western audience than any other
book in the past few years.

The Qur’an makes its own particular truth-claims, which are quite
> audacious. It tells the reader that its source is an archetypal “mother of
> the book” (umm al-kit¥b) in heaven. The Qur’an is therefore of divine
> origin. It is not only authorized but is actually authored by God
> Himself. This is an extraordinary claim, indeed. As such, from a
> Muslim perspective, the element of divine revelation is of paramount
> importance. God wrote the Qur’an, Muslims believe, and thus the
> book commands their respect. Yet should it command the respect of
> those who have not been raised in its culture, who might consider it in

> the university? Absolutely. So where does one begin? There are
methodological considerations that must first be addressed.

The predominantly Christian West may have serious misgivings
> regarding the truth of such claims. They may view the Qur’an as an
> ersatz version of the Bible, as a derivative imitation. This very assump-
> tion largely biased the western reception of the Qur’an from the very
> start, and affected and infected its study until now. As a result, polarities
> in the study of the Qur’an have emerged, although these are beginning
> to disappear. The great divide in Qur’anic studies has historically been
> the tension between traditional Muslim approaches and western aca-
demic approaches.

Although problematic for gaining a coherent understanding and
> appreciation of the Qur’an, these two competing paradigms are some-
> what synergistic. If you combine the two, you get what Wilfred
> Cantwell Smith regarded as the insider-outsider dynamic. In principle,
> he suggested that the best approach to the study of the Qur’an and
> Islam is to be able to enter into a believer’s (emic) perspective while
> maintaining some degree of relative objectivity (etic perspective).
> Indeed, Smith’s canon of believer intelligibility requires that “no state-
> ment about a religion is valid unless it can be acknowledged by that
> religion’s believers” (although in later writings he reversed this some-
> what). This “creative principle” offers the best of both worlds, for it
> “provides experimental control that can lead” scholars “dynamically
> towards the truth.” However, unless one adheres to Smith’s principle,
> polarities will inevitably arise. The following table highlights the
> nature of these polarities.

Polarities in the Study of the Qur’an

> Western                                 Muslim
> Secular academic                        Traditional academic
> Analytic                                Synthetic
> Tendency to over-differentiate          Tendency to harmonize
> Use of reason and bias                  Use of reason and faith
> Sometimes offensive                     Sometimes defensive

Here we see a complement of productive and reductive approaches.

> The method of reading largely determines what is read and how it is
> understood. The Muslim approaches the Qur’an reverentially and
> with full faith in the truth it enshrines. The western secular approach
> can be just the opposite: it is skeptical and analytic, yet it does not have
> to be. Where there are apparent difficulties and even apparent contra-
> dictions in the text, the Muslim will try to resolve those anomalies by
> harmonizing them on a higher plane of understanding, while a person
> approaching the text from a secular perspective (the westerner) may be
> dismissive of the Qur’an as simply a human enterprise where inconsis-
> tencies and errors are to be expected. Such a conclusion is not only
> misguided, according to any knowledgeable Muslim, it is also an attack
upon the integrity of a sacred text that is divinely revealed.

Returning to Approaching the Qur’an itself, Professor Sells makes his
> objective clear: “The purpose of this book is neither to refute nor to
> promote the Qur’anic message. Rather, the goal is to allow those who
> do not have access to the Qur’an in its recited, Arabic form to
> encounter one of the most influential texts in human history in a man-
ner that is acceptable.”14

Critics see the book as presenting a glorified image of the Qur’an,
> and thus of Islam itself, through a process of favorable selectivity. This,
> they claim, is tendentious. Instead of an Orientalist bias against Islam,
> which permeates so much of western scholarship over the past centu-
> ry, the opposite holds true here. By conveniently removing the more
> sensitive Qur’anic passages – those that would surely offend and alarm
> a typical western, non-Muslim reader – Michael Sells has misrepre-
> sented Islam, critics say, not by focusing on its more controversial
> elements, but by meretriciously suppressing them. This is tantamount
> to a kind of “spin” – a public relations ploy that critics allege neatly
> packages Islam as something it is not. By giving a partial view of the
> Qur’an, the positive verses effectively hide the negative. This may be
> thought of as a kind of reverse stereotyping that idealizes, whitewashes,
> and romanticizes the Qur’an. This “spin doctoring” is problematic,
> yet is the author’s prerogative. Apologetic literature does this charac-
> teristically by lionizing the “true” religion and demonizing the “false”
> religion. Such criticisms as these tend not to come from Professor
> Sells’s peers, but rather from Christian conservatives and evangelicals.

While any scholar or other author is perfectly at liberty to do this, a
> public university becomes complicit in the process once such a book
> itself is adopted as part of a curriculum. That means state action, and
> that action, critics charge, is tantamount to establishment of religion.
> The UNC Qur’an controversy raises precisely this kind of allegation.
> While Michael Sells, a respected Islamicist (a scholar of Islam, although
> presumably not a Muslim himself), has affirmatively disavowed and
> repudiated all such charges, when the debate moved into the legal
> arena, it was for the courts to decide.

Facts and Case Analysis

> In 2002 and again in 2004, the University of North Carolina at
> Chapel Hill was sued over its 2002 freshman orientation program.
> This program had been initiated relatively recently, two years before
> 9/11. In 1999, UNC established its “Carolina Summer Reading
> Program” as part of its “First Year Initiative.” This orientation pro-
> gram for incoming freshmen had been recommended by the “Report
> of the Chancellor’s Task Force on Intellectual Climate” in August
> 1997. The goal of this three-year pilot project was to provide “an
> intellectual uplift of the freshman orientation experience” so that
Carolina students would “value an active intellectual life.”15

Prior to the fall orientation experience, incoming students were
> required to participate in a summer reading program. This special
> summer reading assignment happens annually. Each year, a book is
> chosen according to an adopted theme. 9/11 prompted the theme for
> 2002 – unquestionably topical and highly relevant subject matter.
> However, Approaching the Qur’an drew widespread criticism from the
> religious right as intellectual propaganda by presenting a beautified

Having taught Islam at the university level over the years has given

Muslim world today.

Thus, I have taught students (including my Muslim students) to

> traditionalism; 3. neo-traditionalism; 4. modernism; 5. secularism;
> 6. postmodernism; and 7. post-Islamism. Michael Sells’s Approaching

> would not prepare students to understand radical Islamism in its pres-
> ent-day manifestations. For this, a history of various works of tafsÏr
> (Qur’an commentary) would provide some necessary connections,

> be supplemented by a history of the modern Muslim Middle East,
> beginning from the intrusion and subsequent hegemony of European

> colonialism (from Napoleon’s invasion of Egypt in 1798 onward) and
its reconstructive yet destabilizing aftermath.

Much writing of the history of the modern Muslim Middle East has

Therefore, UNC’s adoption of a text that is quite sensitive to (and

> tion of Approaching the Qur’an as required reading for incoming
> Carolina freshmen: “The Koran assignment at the University of North
> Carolina, where I am a professor of religious studies, is a belated
> attempt to catch up with the one-way flow of globalizing culture.”16
> Yet this “one-way flow” precipitated a two-way collision on campus
> and in court. The actual reading assignment is still on UNC’s
> “Carolina Summer Reading Program” official site:

> The Carolina Summer Reading Program is designed to introduce you to
> the intellectual life of Carolina. Required of all new undergraduate stu-
> dents (first year and transfer), it involves reading an assigned book over the
> summer, writing a one-page response to a particular subject, participating
> in a two-hour discussion, and sharing your written response with others.
> The goals of the program are to stimulate discussion and critical thinking
> around a current topic, to introduce you to academic life at Carolina, to

> enhance a sense of community between students, faculty and staff, and to
> provide a common experience for incoming students. Some find they
> enjoy sharing the reading with members of their family during the
summer.

This year’s reading is Approaching the Qur’án: The Early Revelations,
> translated and introduced by Michael Sells. Although the summer reading
> is required, if any students or their families are opposed to reading parts of
> the Qur’an because to do so is offensive to their own faith, they may
> choose not to read the book. These students should instead complete their
one-page response on why they chose not to read the book.

…all students are expected to…bring their one-page response to
> their small group discussions led by selected faculty and staff. This is an
> opportunity for you to connect with members of Carolina’s learning
> community and to share a common academic experience with your new
> peers.17

> Note that provision was made for students who took umbrage at the
> reading to opt out of it and to simply explain the rationale behind their
> decision in a short essay. Originally, UNC required all its students to
> do the reading, without exception. However, when exception was
> taken (by critics), UNC backtracked to make an exception.
> Disaffected students could opt to write an essay as to why they elected
> not to read Approaching the Qur’an. The actual number of students who
> exercised this option is not available, and so assessing the level of con-
> troversy that the summer reading program had generated in the
student population is quite impossible to tell.

While the internal situation was relatively protected from the glare
> of public scrutiny, the controversy did make the national press.18 It hit
> a raw nerve and tapped into public interest in Islam – a piqued desire to

the UNC program (see below).

Guests included eminent Islamicist John Esposito, Professor of
Religion and International Affairs, Georgetown University, and

> author of Unholy War: Terror in the Name of Islam,20 and Michael Sells,
> Professor of Comparative Religion, Haverford College (Haverford,
> PA), and author of Approaching the Qur’an: The Early Revelations.21

> name is misspelled as “Canner” on the NPR web site), Assistant

> and co-author of Unveiling Islam.23 At that time, Caner was erstwhile
> advisor to the Family Policy Network, the conservative Christian
> advocacy group that brought suit against UNC. Caner complained
> that “reading a portion of the Qur’an” that selectively beautifies the
> more universal features of Qur’anic discourse and expurgates by omis-
> sion some of the more controversial passages effectively “becomes a
> propaganda tool.” While not aimed at actually converted students to
> Islam, the nature of the propaganda tool presents Islam as an inherently
> peaceful religion. For this and other reasons, Professor Caner objected
> to the fact that some 4,200 incoming freshmen would be “forced” to
> read a text that promotes a positive view of the Qur’an that distorts the
> real picture by presenting the early Makkan surahs (the first revelations
> of the Qur’an, which, as a whole, were revealed to the Prophet
> Muhammad over a period of twenty-three lunar years). The required
> reading did little to shed light on an event that shed such blood and
tears as 9/11.

When host Neal Conan asked Professor Sells for his views as author
> of the controverted text, Sells disclaimed his book of having any pro-
> pagandistic purpose whatsoever. Approaching the Qur’an is purely an
> introductory text on the Qur’an and offers insights as to how the text is
> read and appreciated by Muslims. It simply does not deal with why
> Islamic extremists commit terrorism in the name of Islam (and based
> on an extremist reading of key passages of the Qur’an that are not part
> of the early Makkan surahs and are therefore not found in the text of
> Approaching the Qur’an). Sells disavowed such an ulterior motive or
> agenda for the book, and advocated what he called a “non-conflictual
> view of religion” that allows for a dispassionate inquiry into religions.
> In Sells’s defense, Professor John Esposito, the other Islamicist guest on
> NPR, pointed out that Sells’s book was written before 9/11 and

> therefore could not be expected to address its implications for a
> nuanced understanding of the mentality that animated the terrorists
themselves.

Altogether, four actions were brought against UNC that dealt
> directly with the Qur’an controversy: two lawsuits in 2002 and two

that the court decisions themselves remain unpublished.

Quite the reverse occurred with respect to the 2004 cases.

writer has now obtained a transcript of this proceeding.24

The case was heard by the Hon. N. Carlton Tilley, Jr., Chief
> District Judge, U.S. District Court, Middle District of North Carolina,
> in Greensboro. Two of the three student plaintiffs were aged 18, and
> the third was a 17-year-old minor, represented by the parents. The
> first student, bearing the pseudonym John Doe No. 1, was an evangel-
> ical Christian. John Doe No. 2 (the minor, represented by “John and
> Jane Doe, Sr.”) was a Roman Catholic, and Jane Doe was Jewish. The
> action was originally filed on July 22 in the Federal District Court.25
> The plaintiffs were represented by Stephen M. Crampton and Michael
> J. DePrimo of the American Family Association/Center for Law and
> Policy. The two attorneys have publicly stated their personal convic-
> tions (“What We Believe”) as it relates to the law:

> The principles that inform the Center for Law and Policy’s jurisprudence
> and policy positions derive from the Bible, for as Sir William Blackstone
> wrote over two centuries ago, the law of the Creator is “the true law.”
> Blackstone’s understanding of “true law” has resonated throughout the
> corridors of history from voices as diverse as Moses, Plato, Cicero,
> Jefferson, and countless other theologians, philosophers, jurists, and
> statesmen. Liberty stems only from the true law and the principles drawn
> therefrom. It is these principles, embodied in the Declaration of
> Independence, upon which the Center for Law & Policy premises its
> actions.26

> Presumably, in a further effort not to reveal their identities, none of
> these students were present in Tilley’s Greensboro court. Over UNC’s
> objections to the contrary, Judge Tilley allowed the three students to
> remain unknown due to their age, even though there was no indica-
> tion that these students stood in any danger or faced any reprisal for
> their legal actions. “I think it could be disruptive to the education and

> the mental health of those three students to be identified,” Tilley
stated.27

UNC Chapel Hill was represented by Assistant Attorney General
> Celia Grasty Lata and Joyce S. Rutledge, and Susan H. Ehringhaus and
> David Parker, General Counsel, University of North Carolina.
> Counsels for the Defendant argued that the case was not about reli-
> gious freedom, but censorship of ideas. Lata argued that to halt the
> reading program would have a chilling effect on freedom of speech in
> the University, causing professors to be wary of choosing other books
> that might spark controversy. “It might have done that already,” Tilley
remarked in court.28

As plaintiffs’ advocate, Stephen M. Crampton, chief counsel for the
> Mississippi-based American Family Association Center for Law and
> Policy, played the Muslim call to prayer, in Arabic, from the audio CD
> that accompanies Approaching the Qur’an. “We would like to ask how
> this stimulates critical thinking?” Crampton asked, as the recording
> played in the background. “I would submit that’s a quintessential reli-
> gious exercise.” Judge Tilley later responded to this contention in his
> holding: “The two-hour discussion session is not a religious activity,
> just as playing the CD in this courtroom did not convert it into a reli-
gious activity.”29

Playing a CD in Arabic has educational value in creating an impres-
> sion as to what the Qur’an actually sounds like when recited. Whether
> the playing of the CD also has a religious effect “certainly goes to the
> question of how academically that might be considered and discussed
> instead of promoting or endorsing Islam or a possible view of Islam,
> whether it is palliated or not.”30 Recital of the Qur’an is a religious
> activity, but listening to a recitation is not, unless one happens to be a
> Muslim, understands Arabic, and is a participant in the liturgical expe-
> rience. As Tilley further observed: “Presumably, very few people
> entering Chapel Hill would speak Arabic and be able to understand the
> words.”31 The role of the listener is thus that of an interested observer.
It is the “music appreciation” akin to listening to a Gregorian chant.

After hearing the merits of the controversy, Judge Tilley held that
> there was simply no evidence that the University chose Approaching the
> Qur’an in an effort to convert students to Islam: “I do not believe an

> objective person reading the book would believe the University is sug-
> gesting a preference for Islam, a particular interpretation of Islam or
> religion itself.”32 In reading the book for himself, Judge Tilley
> remarked:

> Now, with regard to the book, Mr. Crampton read certain small portions
> of the book which he contends support his position that the book does not
> fairly teach the Qur’an and, therefore, would instill in persons who are
> participating in the program an unduly positive view of the Qur’an. My
> own review of the book was not to that effect. My own review was that
> the book did present Dr. Sells’ opinion that he was not endorsing as truth
> any of the revelations. He does point out in there that Muhammad
> claimed he had those revelations. Dr. Sells is not saying he did have those
> revelations.33

> Judge Tilley then reviewed Approaching the Qur’an in general terms,
> highlighting specific passages he found particularly relevant.34 His
> overall conclusion was that the book was strictly academic, not reli-
> gious in nature, and therefore did not amount to a religious activity.
> He ended his analysis with an application of the Lemon test – a test for
> Establishment Clause violations deriving from Lemon v. Kurtzman,
> 403 U.S. 602.35 In closing, Judge Tilley complimented attorneys on
> both sides, in saying:

> I think the case has been very well-handled by all the lawyers.
> You’ve done an excellent job on your briefs. You’ve done an
> excellent job on your arguments, and if every case that came
> into court were as well-represented as the persons in this partic-
> ular case had been, I think the state of our jurisprudence would
> be elevated several levels.36

> As expected, the plaintiffs appealed, still seeking an injunction, prima-
> rily on anti-establishment grounds, for a halt to the Qur’an discussion
> sessions scheduled for August 20.

> The House of Representatives of the North Carolina General Assembly

> program or course that deals with a single religion unless all known reli-
> gions are given equal treatment. (This proviso, which also would affect
> many offerings in the Department of Religious Studies, was quietly
removed when the state budget finally [passed] in mid-September.)

And in response to this clear threat to academic freedom, the Board
> of Governors of the 16-campus University of North Carolina system
> failed in an initial vote to endorse a resolution in support of academic free-
> dom. (Later, after our program was over, the Board of Governors
approved a resolution reaffirming academic freedom.)

Finally, on August 19, after the Family Policy Network’s legal
> efforts to shut us down had failed, we went on with our discussion groups.
> Nothing terrible happened; our students read a book, talked about it and

But the combination of the lawsuit, the legislative threat and the

One academic’s protest over the House’s vote deserves to be cited

> ulty of the sixteen University of North Carolina campuses. In his

> Professor Veit took a stand for academic freedom against the House’s
> threatened budgetary sanctions for promoting the study of Islam by
> means of the Qur’an. Speaking on behalf of some 13,000 UNC pro-
> fessors, Dr. Veit stated:

> Inseparable from the search for truth is the search for understanding. It is
> the obligation of scholars, faculty, and students to examine the world as it

> is, in all its aspects. In a diverse, complex, dangerous, and increasingly
> interconnected world, we must gain the fullest possible understanding of
others and of ourselves.

As faculty we have the obligation to teach students, not to indoctri-
> nate them, not to provide them with a store of facts, but to expose students
> to diverse thought, to teach them to analyze, compare, and evaluate ideas.
In short, we must train students to think for themselves.

It was in the spirit of open inquiry and the quest for understanding
> that the faculty at Chapel Hill assigned the reading and discussion of a
> scholarly book, Approaching the Qur’an: The Early Revelations. If legislators
> impose what would be, in effect, a ban on the study of a particular book,
> they would limit academic freedom in a way no different or less destruc-
> tive than the shackles placed on academic inquiry by the Taliban in
pre-9/11 Afghanistan.

Academic freedom entails that academic and curricular decisions in
> a university must be made, through orderly academic processes, by the
> faculty. When the faculty’s considered professional judgments are limited
> or overturned by others, academic freedom ceases to exist and the univer-
sity ceases to function as a university.

Academic freedom is a powerful idea, but it is constantly under
> attack, and it exists only when it is vigilantly and vigorously defended. As
> faculty we urge the North Carolina General Assembly to reject the pro-
> posal in the House budget that would curtail academic inquiry.42

> The appeal itself was timely, but not persuasive. Speaking from the
> Louis F. Powell, Jr. U.S. Courthouse in Richmond, Virginia, the
> Court handed down a unanimous decision, rendered by Judge Robert
> B. King, and joined by Judges Roger L. Gregory and William B.
> Traxler Jr., in which the three-judge panel upheld the federal district
> court’s decision by ruling that “the appellants have failed to satisfy the
> requirements for such relief.”43 According to the Associated Press,
> “No further explanation was contained in the brief ruling.”44 A copy
> of the actual order bears this out.45 The FPN’s effort to get an injunc-
> tion having failed, UNC’s Qur’an discussion groups proceeded as
planned the very next day.

The story was far from over - the Family Policy Network did not
> give up. Another event provided the pretext for a new action: an
> Islamic awareness week. In early October 2002, the American Family

> Association’s Center for Law and Policy, which had represented the
> FPN in its previous actions, amended its federal court complaint in an
> effort to block UNC from hosting the round-table discussions and
> seminars on Islam, scheduled for November 11-15. According to
> Michael DePrimo, an attorney for the Center for Law and Policy:
> “There’s a lot more going on than we thought there was when we first
> filed our complaint.”46 The amended complaint was filed on Oct. 4,
> giving UNC 20 days to respond. “The issue” DePrimo stated, “is
> whether or not the University is advancing the religion of Islam.” To
> which he hastened to add: “And clearly they are.” The issue would
> again be decided in the Federal District Court in Greensboro.47
> Reports of the outcome of this action, as of this date, are unavailable.
> However, the FPN continued to mount challenges to UNC policies
> promoting Islamic awareness. The eventual federal responses, pub-
> lished in 2004, would prove to be as articulate as they were definitive.

> Yacovelli v. Moeser, 2004 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 9152
> (M.D.N.C. May 20, 2004)
> There were seven “players” in this lawsuit. Alleging that UNC’s ori-
> entation program violated both the Establishment Clause and the Free
> Exercise Clause, this action was brought by three anonymous students
> (named by the pseudonyms of “John Doe No. 1” and “John No. 2,”
> along with a seventeen-year-old minor represented “by and through
> his parents, John and Jane Doe, Sr.”), together with two taxpayers,
> James Yacovelli and Terry Moffitt, against the University of North

> capacity as Chancellor of the University of North Carolina at Chapel
> Hill, and Cynthia Wolf Johnson, in her official capacity as Associate
> Vice Chancellor for Student Learning for the University of North
> Carolina at Chapel Hill.” The Plaintiffs alleged, in part, the following:

> …Approaching the Qur’an presents a biased view of Islam as a peaceful reli-
> gion and that it leaves out less flattering stories about Muhammad.
> Plaintiffs conclude that this positive portrayal of both Muhammad and
> Islam constitutes an endorsement of Islam. Furthermore, Plaintiffs

> contend that the inclusion of surahs and a compact disk (“CD”) contain-
> ing a reading of these surahs in Arabic is impermissible. While Sells
> explains that listening to a reading of the text in Arabic creates a different
> experience than simply reading a translation, Plaintiffs argue that listening
> to the CD exposes students to “the spell cast by a holy man of Islam.”48

> The last sentence is surprising and might have added a refreshing touch
> of levity, were it not for the fact that the Plaintiffs were quite serious in
> this allegation. The notion that a recital of the Qur’an is an act of sym-
> pathetic magic probably derives from a demonic view of Islam from
> within a conservative Christian perspective. Both religions, in a sense,
> not only require a belief in a Supreme Being and in prophetic figures
> (Jesus and Muhammad in Christianity and Islam, respectively,
> although the Qur’an recognizes the divine mission of Jesus as well)
> who are commissioned by that Being to convey a message of salvation
> to the world, but entail a belief in Satan (Islam: IblÏs) as well. More lib-
> eral interpretations of each religion have tended to treat Satan as the
> personification of human evil, a development that can be seen in the
> youngest independent world religion, known in the West as the Bahai
> Faith, which has disenchanted the universe of demonic principalities
> altogether and shifted the burden of responsibility for evil back onto
the shoulders of its effective agents, human beings.

Since, from an evangelical Christian perspective, Satan may assume
> angelic qualities in order to trick the spiritually susceptible into believ-

obvious contradiction at the level of principle.

The reader may well wonder why, some two years later, the plain-
tiffs persisted in their cause of action against UNC. The Court notes

> their rationale: “Although the program has now been completed,
> Plaintiffs urge this Court to enjoin UNC from organizing such a pro-
> gram in the future. Plaintiffs also seek nominal damages and attorneys’
> fees.”49 This case was pursued on juridical (and religious) principle
> and for its largely symbolic value. For “their alleged lack of standing to
> challenge the reading assignment,” the Court granted UNC’s motion
> to dismiss the Taxpayer Plaintiffs, James Yacovelli and Terry
> Moffitt.50 Although there is no requirement of economic injury, the
> Yacovelli and Moffitt failed to show a constitutionally mandated “case
> or controversy.” Their “intangible injury” simply did not rise to the
> threshold of a legally cognizable harm for which relief (here, injunctive
relief) might be sought.

Although absent from their amended complaint, the Court still
> addressed the Taxpayer Plaintiffs’ contention that “UNC’s display of
> the assignment and study questions on the University’s website is, in
> effect, an offensive state sponsored religious display.”51 Plaintiffs’ pro-
> cedural error notwithstanding, the Court explained that mere
> observation of religiously offensive conduct did not constitute a real
> injury for purposes of standing. Furthermore, UNC’s website, while
> state-sponsored, was hardly religious and therefore “could not proper-
> ly be deemed a religious display.”52 The Court observed that UNC’s
> website simply “provided a brief synopsis of Approaching the Qur’an
> without including any portions of either the book or the Qur’an” and
> that, at most, the site gave straightforward information “about an ori-
> entation session that may or may not be constitutional.”53 The
> Taxpayer Plaintiffs’ complaint failed because they could not “present a

gation of having been “injured as taxpayers.”55

Flast v. Cohen56 carves out an exception to the general rule that tax-
> payers have standing purely by virtue of their taxpayer status. The
> Court recited the rule that “[p]laintiffs asserting taxpayer status must
> allege more than a violation of the Establishment Clause. They must
> contend that, by use of the taxing and spending power, the govern-
> ment has exceeded its constitutional authority under the

> plaintiffs’ complaint over UNC’s expenditure of operating funds in
> support of its orientation program did not amount to a challenge of
> “congressional or state legislative exercise of the power to tax and
> spend” nor “any specific appropriations measure.”58 The Court clear-
> ly distinguished the UNC fact scenario from situations adumbrated by
> Flast that involve permissible “challenges to legislation governing the
> appropriation of tax moneys.”59 Having shown no personal injury,
> and having failed to demonstrate a relevant challenge to state spending
> under Flast, the Court dismissed James Yacovelli’s and Terry Moffitt’s
taxpayer claims.60

Yet the Court preserved the complaint of the three UNC students,
> who did have standing. First, the Court “granted the ‘rare dispensa-
> tion’ of proceeding anonymously,”61 balancing the public’s right of
> access to open court proceedings versus citizens’ right to privacy. The
> Court enumerated the five factors outlined in James62 that courts must
> weight in deciding whether to conceal the true identities of plaintiffs:
> 1. to protect a “specific sensitive and personal privacy interest;”63 2. to
> seriously contemplate any “threatened consequences of the identifica-
> tion of plaintiffs;”64 3. to give due regard to the “ages of the plaintiffs”
> who seek to safeguard their privacy interests;65 4. to explore “whether
> the plaintiff is pursuing legal action against a governmental or private
> party;”66 5. to weigh any “risk of unfairness and prejudice to the other
party.”67

Without recapitulating its close application of the five James fac-
> tors, which tipped in favor of the student plaintiffs,68 the Court
> considered an additional factor, that of possible adverse publicity:
> “[T]his Court may also consider the fact that the case has received
> intense media coverage. The threat of harassment and public hostility
> is therefore potentially more severe and harmful than that in a less pub-
> licized case.”69 Based on the five James factors plus the additional sixth,
> the Court allowed the three student plaintiffs to proceed anonymous-
ly.

By 2004, these students’ allegations were mooted once the orien-
> tation program had run its course (having been announced in May and
> finished in August 2002). Normally, there would be no constitution-
> ally required “case or controversy to adjudicate. But an exception

> obtains in any allegedly aggrievous situation that is “capable of repeti-
> tion, yet evading review.”70 As to the plaintiffs themselves, the
> situation they faced and the harms they feared simply had no chance of
> recurring. Had such an action been permissible if brought on behalf of
> other students, the outcome might have been different. In other
> words, if the student plaintiffs’ could have brought a “future class
> action” suit (as distinguished from a class action suit) where future
> harm may be legally prevented that might affect a class of prospective
> victims (even though that may be too strong a term), then the Court
> could have contemplated an injunction against UNC from ever again
> selecting a religious text for its summer orientation program. The
> Court recognized Justice Scalia’s dissent “for the proposition that a risk
> of harm to persons other than the complaining party may suffice under
> extraordinary circumstances,” but, as the Court was quick to add, “the
> current state of the law is otherwise.”71 Thus, the plaintiffs’ injunctive
demands were dismissed.72

The Court next granted defendant’s motion to “dismiss the nomi-
> nal damages claim against Chancellor Moeser in his individual capacity
> as to the Establishment Clause claims based on qualified immunity.”73
> Qualified immunity shields state officials performing discretionary
> duties where the official’s conduct “does not violate clearly established
> statutory or constitutional rights of which a reasonable person would
> have known.”74 Of course, the student plaintiffs alleged UNC’s viola-
> tion of the Establishment Clause, which bars federal and state
> governments from endorsing, financing, or coercing any religious
> claims, initiatives, or beliefs, respectively. The Court applied the stan-
> dard, three-pronged Lemon test, requiring that state action 1. evinces a
> secular purpose; 2. has the primary effect of neither advancing nor
> inhibiting religion; and 3. without causing excessive government
> entanglement in religion.75 UNC’s actions would violate the
> Establishment Clause if any one of the three Lemon factors were not
> met. As for the first, the Court held: “Because UNC’s stated secular
> purpose does not appear to be a sham, this Court will give deference to
> this stated secular purpose.”76 Can a religious text, such as the Qur’an
> (and especially the Qur’an), be studied for a secular purpose? The
> Court applied to following rationale to find that UNC’s purpose was
indeed secular:

> The study of religious texts can be secular in purpose. If the religious text
> is presented as part of an objective secular program in which the school
> intends to explore the history, civilization, ethics, literary, or historical
> aspects of the text, or if the text is used in the study of comparative reli-
> gions, the use of the religious text is secular.77

> The Court found that UNC had satisfied Lemon’s second inquiry in
> that “Approaching the Qur’an simply cannot be compared to religious
> practices which have been deemed violative of the Establishment
> Clause, such as posting the Ten Commandments, reading the Lord’s
> Prayer or reciting prayers in school.”78 The excessive entanglement
> prong involves both “kind and degree.”79 The Court points out that
> the only institution to benefit from the reading program was UNC
> itself, and that there simply was no institutional affiliation with any
> Islamic organizations. Moreover, no Muslim clerics were present at
> any of the two-hour discussion sessions. In favor of the legal status of
> the academic study of religion, the Court pressed this decisive distinc-
> tion:

> The Supreme Court has made a distinction between “the discourse of the
> scholar’s study or the seminar room” or the “merely descriptive examina-
> tion of religious doctrine” and “the evangelist’s mission station.”
> Rosenberger v. Rector & Visitors of the Univ. of Va., 515 U.S. 819, 868, 132
> L. Ed. 2d 700, 115 S. Ct. 2510 (1995) (noting that an article discussing
> how Christ alone provides spiritual fulfilment [sic] fell in the latter catego-
> ry). UNC’s orientation program involved the examination of both period
> writing, comparisons to earlier Arabic thought, and imagery as they relate
> to religious doctrine. It was scholarly discourse, not a proselytizing mis-
> sion.80

> The Court here makes a crucial distinction that has been absolutely
> vital to the legal, political, and fiscal survival of departments and pro-
> grams of comparative religions across the U.S., Canada, and Europe.
> What used to be called “religious studies” is more properly termed the
> “academic study of religion.” During my doctoral studies at the
> University of Toronto, what was called the Centre for Religious
> Studies at entrance in 1991 was later changed to the Centre for the

> Study of Religion, in order to disambiguate the term “religious” from
> “religious” orientation and exercise in the traditional, faith-based
> sense of the word. While the academic study of religion is necessarily
> “religious” as to its subject matter, it is decided secular as to its metho-
> dology. Of course, there are a number of “engaged” (religiously
> committed) scholars in the profession. However, they endeavor to
> make their work intersubjectively available by adhering to the canons
of free inquiry and academic rigor.

After giving a ringing endorsement of academic freedom, the
> Court concluded the issue by saying: “In short, UNC’s orientation
> program passes the Lemon test. Because there has been no violation of
> the Establishment Clause, Defendant Moeser is entitled to qualified
> immunity as to the Establishment Clause claims.”81 There remained
> the issue of the plaintiffs’ Free Exercise claim: “The Plaintiffs’ Motion
> for Leave to File a Second Amended Complaint will be GRANTED
> as it relates to the Pseudonymous Plaintiffs’ Free Exercise claims.”82
> Beyond some minor procedural issues, this decision paved the way for
> the final stage of the litigation, which took place several weeks later.

> Motion granted by, dismissed by Yacovelli v. Moeser, 324 F. Supp. 2d 760,
> 2004 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 12815 (M.D.N.C., July 7, 2004)
> The subsequent ruling had narrowed to a single issue, and the pub-
> lished opinion was correspondingly shorter. In Yacovelli v. Moeser,83
> decided on July 7, 2004, the very same U.S. district judge, Judge N.
> Carlton Tilley, granted UNC’s (D) motion to dismiss the plaintiffs’
> Free Exercise claim and issued a memorandum opinion summarizing
> the facts and setting forth the reasons for his holding. In relating the
> instant case back to the 2002 actions, the Court encapsulated the pro-
> cedural history in this nutshell summary:

> A preliminary injunction was denied both by this Court and by the
> Fourth Circuit, and the orientation program took place as scheduled.
> Thereafter, this Court dismissed the Taxpayer Plaintiffs for lack of stand-
> ing, dismissed any further claims for injunctive relief as moot, and
> dismissed any claims that the defendants violated the Establishment
> Clause. Plaintiffs were permitted to add new factual allegations as they

> related to the sole remaining claim, the Free Exercise Claim. The defen-
> dants have now moved to dismiss the Free Exercise claim.84

> At this final stage of the litigation, the “sole remaining claim” was “the
> Free Exercise Claim.”85 It did not rise to an actionable claim because
> the complaint failed to allege facts sufficient to state a claim for a Free
> Exercise violation. In other words, the plaintiffs failed to make their
> case. Judge Tilley enumerated four reasons for this:

> The complaint does not allege a factual basis for the conclusion that UNC
> either 1. compelled affirmation of any particular religious belief, 2. lent its
> power to a particular side in a controversy over religious dogma, 3.
> imposed special disabilities on the basis of religious views or religious sta-
tus, or 4. punished the expression of any particular religious doctrines.

There is not a sufficient factual or legal basis for the conclusion that
> UNC either compelled affirmation of Islam, or lent its power in favor of
> Islamic dogma.86

> The Court had previously “found that UNC’s assignment was aca-
> demic, and not religious, in nature” and that “UNC, instead of
> endorsing a particular religious viewpoint, merely undertook to
> engage students in a scholarly debate about a religious topic.” The
> ensuing discussion groups, moreover, “were likewise intended to
> encourage scholarly debate about the Islamic religion,” where
> “[s]tudents were free to share their opinions on the topic whether their
> opinions be positive, negative or neutral.”87 The offending of some
> students’ religious sensitivities notwithstanding, nothing in the
> required reading assignment nor in the discussion sessions that fol-
> lowed amount to religious indoctrination or exercise. UNC’s original
> objective of helping students gain a more informed perspective on
> Islam in response to the tragic events of 9/11, and in sharpening their
> analytical and critical thinking skills in the process, has entirely to do
> with program design and not with any subterranean religious motives.
> Any positive portrayal of Islam was an incidental effect that, if nothing
> else, served as a counterpoint to already existing stereotypes of Islam in
> general and the deservedly negative public perceptions of Radical
> Islamism in particular.

The whole issue of coercion was sidestepped when UNC revised
> its original requirement that all incoming students read Approaching the
> Qur’an and each write a reflective essay based on it. In accommodating
> those students who might find this assignment religiously offensive,
> UNC officials adopted an opting out policy. The Court recognized
> the positive value of this policy in saying: “Allowing students to
> express their own religious views, or to choose not to do so, did not
> punish student expression of religious beliefs. Instead, this type of
> assignment specifically encouraged students to address any and all
> views they may have had on either the Qur’an [sic] or on the Islamic
> faith.”88 The fact that there was no grade attached to the assignment
> was also important, in that a charge of religious coercion might have
> been possible had there been any negative academic consequences for
> opting out of the assignment, or even for boycotting the assignment
> altogether.89 The Court concluded:

> UNC implemented a freshman orientation program which did not
> infringe upon the rights of its students under the Free Exercise Clause.
> The Second Amended Complaint fails to provide sufficient allegations to
> show that UNC compelled students to perform acts which burdened
> their religious beliefs, or otherwise punished students on the basis of their
> religion. To the contrary, UNC implemented a program asking students
> to discuss a religion thrust into recent controversy, and to do so from an
> academic perspective. Part of the purpose of this program was to intro-
> duce students to the type of higher-level thinking that is required in a
> university setting. Students who were not members of the Islamic faith,
> probably the great majority of students, were neither asked nor forced to
> give up their own beliefs or to compromise their own beliefs in order to
> discuss the patterns, language, history, and cultural significance of the
> Qur’an [sic].90

Conclusion

> This is really a test case of religious pluralism and of its possibilities and
> limitations within the university context. The study of the Qur’an
> focalizes all these issues and intensifies them. The terrorist events of 11

September 2001 provided the catalyst. That dark day was the decisive

> factor in the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill’s selection of
> Approaching the Qur’an as the required text for its 2002 summer read-
> ing program. The Family Policy Network’s challenge of that choice
> was a judicial protest that took on national proportions. The following
> section restates the pedagogical case for the Qur’an and then reflects on
> the constitutional question (and the answer) provided by Yacovelli v.
Moeser.

Muslims (including American Muslims, of course) have a coherent
> worldview, one that originates from the Qur’an itself. (This is not to
> obscure the contours of serious internal rifts within the Muslim com-
> munity itself, and significant variances within Muslim self-under-
> standing.) To appreciate the Qur’an is to develop a keener sensitivity
> to the operation of the divine in a culture once far removed from the
> Euro-American world but now increasingly an integral part of it. The
> Qur’an is a world unto itself, a palatial architecture of meaning that is
> multidimensional and comprehends the totality of the human experi-
> ence. On the moral and spiritual foundation of the Qur’an, an entire
> history and civilization has been built. One can only gain from such an
> appreciation of the Qur’an’s role in world history and in contemporary
> world affairs. Indeed, one may be enriched by a study of the Qur’an (as
with the Bible as well), but only if one’s prejudices are first abandoned.

Yes, the Qur’an is a text of monumental historical importance. Yet
> it may have an even greater contemporary relevance, for in an increas-
> ing number of western nations, the population of Muslims is
> beginning to surpass the number of Jews. Islam is rapidly entrenching
> itself as a French religion, as part of British society, as a feature of the
> Canadian mosaic, and as an essential element of the spiritual landscape
> of America. To acknowledge the beauty and depth of the Qur’an is not
> to convert to Islam, but to converse with it and with Muslims who are
> enlivened by it. Therefore, to know the Qur’an is to better prepare
> oneself for inevitable encounters with Muslims both in America and
> abroad – not as the exotic “other” somewhere in the distant Orient,
> but as the religion and way of life of our fellow compatriots at home –
> friends, neighbors, and, through increasing religious intermarriage,
> that of our immediate and extended families.

The Qur’an can and should be taught in the University, not to con-
> vert students into pious Muslims, but to convert pious Muslim beliefs
> into something students can understand, so that they can appreciate
> the power of the book to influence those who believe in it. However,
> beyond the question of why the Qur’an should it be taught, there is the
> problem of how it should be taught within constitutional bounds. In
> whatever course and context it may be taught, the real challenge is
> how to engage students in the study of this text, and to assist them in
discovering the Qur’an for themselves.

The Qur’an is a text of world-historical proportions that institu-
> tions of higher learning can scarcely afford to ignore, because our
> domestic life, as well as international affairs, will be increasingly
> informed by it. Discovering the Qur’an on a personal basis can be
> rewarding for its own sake. Studying the Qur’an will equip university
> students with a competence they are sure to find useful in an increas-
> ingly multicultural world, one-fifth of which is already under Islam’s
> spiritual, political, and cultural authority, with an even greater part of
> the world affected by it. The Qur’an is the constitution of Islamic soci-
> ety in far more profound way than the Constitution is to American
society.

The constitutionality of religious studies in university settings has
> generated a vigorous debate,91 and the instant case was no exception.
> One original thesis, sure to spark a lively debate, is Leslie Griffin’s dis-
> tinction between the academic standard and the constitutional
> standard as to justifying the integration of religious studies in university
> curricula.92 In the case of Yacovelli v. Moeser, the FPN’s persistence
> preserved the issue, yet constitutional consistency prevailed. Consti-
> tutionally, the UNC’s adoption of Approaching the Qur’an rested on
> solid ground, over and above FPN’s bedrock faith in the merits of its
> challenge. The FPN’s advocacy ultimately resulted in the UNC’s vin-
> dication. While the subject matter (the Qur’an) was religious, the
> University of North Carolina’s approach was not. Judge Tilley’s
rationale, although it did not set precedent, faithfully followed it.

The UNC Qur’an controversy should be viewed within a broad
> spectrum of cases that form the body of educational law as regards the
> teaching of religion in public schools and institutions of higher

> learning. The Courts have already weighed in on the University of
> North Carolina Qur’an controversy. While reading the Qur’an can-
> not be required, it is required reading for religious, political, cultural
> and global literacy. In its own way, it is a democratic as well as academ-
> ic enterprise. It strengthens our Constitution by testing its limits and
> expanding the juridical horizons of this quintessentially American
> counterpart of the Qur’an.
