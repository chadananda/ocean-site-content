   Chinese Religions: Evolution, Compatibility
and Adaptability - A Historical Perspective

Kow Mei Kao

Abstract

The Chinese civilization has a long, long history and its religions too,
have a history of almost 2000 years. It is interesting and worth our while
to have a retrospective examination of its early development as a case
study of its nature and characteristics so as to predict its future trend of
development.

It is widely known that there were three major religions in imperial China;
these are Confucianism, Daoism and Buddhism. I shall examine them one
by one, tracing their formations, and whenever convenient, demonstrate
each of their compatibility and adaptability and mutual influences in the
process of their early development.

1\. Religious Confucianism

Whether Confucianism is a religion is debatable, and most scholars are
not in favour of considering it as a religion. A recent publication by Li
Shen, of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences in Beijing, has regarded
Confucianism as a religion, though he admitted that many of his friends
did not agree with him. The ru Confucianism in Indonesia is being
developed into a religion and this may lead one into concluding that
Confucianism was a religion. My own impression is that Confucianism
was strictly and solemnly observed in imperial China and therefore it had
the spirit of a religion. The modern translation of the English word
religion is zongjiao, derived and borrowed from the Japanese translation
of such a concept, and it is quite difficult to find an equivalent in the
Chinese language per se. In fact, Confucianism or rujiao can either mean

64            THE SINGAPORE BAHAT STUDIES REVIEW

the teaching of the ru or to the modem Chinese, the ru religion (jiao).
While Buddhism and Daoism were always calledyzao in Chinese, the man
in the street does not bother to distinguish whether the jiao has a religious
connotation or not. In any case, this paper tries to adopt a new term,
"religious Confucianism", modelled on the distinction made between
philosophical Daoism and religious Daoism.

The initial formation of rujiao or religious Confucianism, came much
later in Confucian history, at the beginning of Western Han dynasty (206
BC - 24 AD).

Confucius has always been regarded as a great thinker or philosopher in
ancient China, and his ethical and political thinking, expounded by his
followers, has had extensive influence on Chinese culture. Although the
Analects recorded that he never talked about death, ghosts and spirits,1 I
would argue that he thought about them. All this might show inclination
of his religious sentiments, which could be developed into a religion.

It was from the early Han dynasty that Confucius was deified as zjiaozhu
or religious master. Since Confucius' teachings suited the ruler's
administration, rulers of different dynasties made an effort to reform or
moderate them so that they might become compact and complete. After a
long process, Confucius was eventually deified, and his classics regarded
as canons. Later, when Daoism was formed, maybe in the wake of the
spread of Buddhism into China, Confucianism absorbed some of the
thoughts both from Buddhism and Daoism, became more religious, took
on an ideological form, and extended its lasting influence.

\[1\] See Book VII "Shu'er.22" and Book XI "Xianjin.12" in Lunyu (Analects). These are the
two occasions where Confucius' views on ghosts and spirits are recorded. See D.C. Lau
(tr.) The Analects, 1979 p.88 and p. 107. The two passages are being translated
respectively as follows:
"The topics the Master did not speak of were prodigies, force, disorder and gods", and
"Chi-lu asked how the spirits of the dead and the gods should be served. The Master said,
'You are not able even to serve man. How can you serve the spirits?' ". Based on the two
passages above, I assume that such a topic was lingering in Confucius' mind and had him
puzzled, though he never openly spoke on it. At least one of his students was also eager to
know something about it, though nobody could provide an answer.

During the Spring and Autumn periods (776-476 BC), Confucius' .
teaching first inherited the views on Heaven and ancestor worship from
the Zhou period (770-221 BC). The cornerstone of this thinking placed
emphasis on the absolute authority of social hierarchy and advocated the
graded system of blood relationship. Thus Confucianism had the potential
to be developed into a religion. It was not yet a religion in Pre-Qin China,
competing on an equal basis with other great schools of philosophy. The
time was ripe when China was united into a great empire for the first time.
During a period of evolution lasting 1000 odd years, there had been two
major reformations. The first occurred during the rein of Emperor Wu of
Han, when Dong Zhongsu (179-104 BC) obtained imperial support,
disparaged all hundred schools and upheld Confucianism as an orthodox
school. Such an act was badly needed, as the autocracy required such a
religion and philosophy, ideologically matching its sentiments.

Dong Zhongsu expressed his central ideas best when he wrote of how the
actions of man flowed into the universal course of Heaven and Earth and
caused reciprocal reverberations in their manifestations. Since there was a
close relationship between Heaven and man, the Han Confucians believed
that abnormal events in the human world caused Heaven to manifest
abnormal phenomena in the natural world. These abnormal phenomena
were known as catastrophes and anomalies. Catastrophes represented the
warnings of Heaven to errant man. Such warnings might be in the form of
floods, famines, landslides or earthquakes. If man persisted in his evil
ways despite these warnings, Heaven would cause strange anomalies to
occur in the form of the eclipse of the Sun or the Moon, unusual
movements of the stars, the growth of beards on women, or the birth of
babies with two heads. If man still persisted in evil, unmindful of these
signs from Heaven, then he was doomed to ruin. On the other hand, if
man acted correctly, then the world system would be harmonious and well
governed.2

\[2\] Dong Zhongshu is regarded the creator of religious Confucianism. Dong held Confucius
in high esteem and advocated to disparage the hundred schools. Dong was particularly
interested in education and he set up many local schools. He emphasized the selection of
talented, filial and worthy persons as government officers. Dong maintained that the
reciprocal actions between man and Heaven are the highest principle of his theory. He
believed that man's goodness or evil manipulated Heaven's wishes. He differed from
Confucius and Mencius in that Confucius and Mencius advocated making people rich
before educating them while Dong placed primary emphasis on education. More
importantly, Dong standardized rituals such as offering sacrifices to Heaven, sacrifices at

66           THE SINGAPORE BAHAT STUDIES REVIEW

In general, Confucianism of the Han period had the following features:
a) Belief in Heaven and a personal god, who watches over the

conduct of man and government;
b) Belief that man is the noblest creature created by the essence of

Heaven and Earth, and is favoured by Heaven;
> c) Belief in rewards and punishments for good and evil;
d) Belief that there is a reciprocal relationship between Heaven and

> the conduct of man, so that good deeds bring forth propitious
> omens, and evil deeds, warnings and penalties;
e) Belief in astrology as the means of predicting events and

interpreting the meanings of the Heavenly phenomena.

All these elements were woven into a comprehensive system of politico-
religious philosophy of Confucianism.

The Han Confucianists, using their earthly empire as a model, created a
Heavenly kingdom, and then used the divine instruction from this
Heavenly kingdom to control activities on earth. The natural order was
created to be like the social order and acquired the same ethical attributes.
Although there was no creation of the world by God, as is found in
Western civilization, there were similarities. Confucius was the only
sacred teacher, and the Confucian classics had become the yardstick for
moral, social, and family life.

The second reformation of Confucianism took place in the Sung dynasty
(960-1279 AD). Based upon the experience of the failure of previous
dynasties, the rulers during this period centralized military power, finance
and administration. Confucianism underwent some reforms to suit new
political requirements. Actually, even during the Tang dynasty (618-906
AD), the dynasty immediately preceding the Sung dynasty, Han Yu (768-
824 AD), a leading Confucianist thinker, had already upheld the Mean to
confront Buddhism, while his disciple, Li Ao, had also used the Mean to
counter-attack Buddhist mysticism.3

the ancestors' temples and regulating altars for various rites. This was Dong's contribution
to establishing a religious system for Confucianism. See Li Shen, Zhongguo Rujiao Shi,
pp. 217-241.

\[3\] See Zhu Bosi, Sanjiao Xinlun, (Preface dated_1971) p.8. Actually Confucianism was not
pure even as early as the Early Han dynasty. Lu Jia's Xinyu was regarded one of the purest
Confucian classics of Early Han dynasty, yet Daoist thinking such as non-action was found

Although the Three Compendium (sangang) of the early Confucianists
and Legalists such as Xunzi (331-283) and Han Feizi (? - 233 BC) were
merely political and ethical ideals, it was Dong Zhongsu, as mentioned
earlier on, who put them into practice in daily life. In order to strengthen
their regimes, the rulers always matched imperial power with divinity,
paving the way for the acceptance of the fact that the divine bestowed
imperial power on them. But in actual fact, the divine power was
subordinated to the ruler and was never supposed to suipass that of a
sovereign.

In the early Han dynasty, the imperial meeting at the White Tiger Hall
was a typical example of a ruler using the "divine" to support his imperial
regime. This kind of Confucianism was not the primordial Confucianism
of the Pre-Qin period in its own right. It already displayed signs of
adaptation.

During the Wei-Jin dynasty (220-420 AD), Daoism and Buddhism
flourished, and Confucianism lost its dominance, but it was not deserted.
Confucianism was widely influenced by Daoist mysticism. Most of the
Confucianists were fond of "Empty Talks" (qingtan) though this trend
subsided eventually.4 After the establishment of Neo-Confucianism in the
Sung dynasty, the process of the institutionalization of religious
Confucianism was complete. Neo-Confucianism absorbed concepts from
Buddhism to re-interpret Confucianism and was different from primordial
Confucianism.5 Confucianists worshipped Heaven and Earth, the ruler,
parents and teachers. Heaven was upheld as the highest authority, teachers
were regarded as priests. It contained a theory similar to the Christian
belief that man has original sin - desires and selfishness.

Religious Confucianism propagated the belief that poverty was an honour,
and upheld the avoidance of material enticements. Religious
Confucianism did not make any effort to study the laws of Nature, but
concentrated on the purification of the heart. Thus religious Confucianism
was like any other religion.

influenced by Daoists "Empty talks". See also Yuxueming and Chen Hong, Zhongguo

2\. The inception of Religious Daoism

Religious Daoism emerged at the end of the later Han (25-220 AD)
dynasty, just about the time of the spread of Buddhism into China. It
might be that the Chinese created this religion to counteract the impact of
an alien religious faith.

In ancient times, people worshipped the sun, moon, stars, rivers and seas
in the natural world, and their ancestors which they regarded as spirits.
This form of worship had eventually evolved into a primordial religion
and witchcraft. The witches were, by profession, mediums who
communicated with ghosts and spirits on behalf of man. They passed on
messages of the gods to men and prayed for blessings. Daoism eventually
absorbed traditional sacrificial rituals, together with all these concepts, to
form the first indigenous Chinese religion.

The concept of immortals emerged quite early in Chinese history and was
widely believed. Most people were enthusiastic pursuers of immortality
and transcendence. Magicians (fangshi) used many techniques, such as
alchemy, herbs, talisman and breathing exercises, to achieve this aim.
Daoists incorporated all these beliefs and techniques into their religion.
In the process of the development of an indigenous religion, Daoists drew
a lot from the ontological view of life oiLaozi and Zhuangzi. The Daoists
saw Dao as God who was omnipresent, the source of myriad things, and
the saviour of the world.

Daoism represented by Laozi and Zhuangzi, was a sort of nature -
mysticism. The Daoists discovered nature, expressed their joy and
amazement over it, and sought to identify with it, also calling it Dao. The
Confucian Dao represents the right to act, in terms of morals, society and
politics. The Dao of the Daoists is metaphysical; it is the natural law of
the universe. To them, the Dao brings all things into existence and
governs their every action. The guiding aim of the Daoist is to achieve
union with this Dao through identification. Since the Dao is perceived as
eternal, everlasting and unchanging, the individual who achieves unity
with it is also considered to have reached eternity. To distinguish this
aspect of Daoism from its other expressions, this aspect of it is often
referred to as philosophical Daoism.

Chinese Religions: Evolution, Compatibility and Adaptability                       69

About the same time that philosophical Daoism was taking shape in the
third century BC, there developed another movement that was primarily a
religion of salvation. It also aimed at attaining immortal life for
individuals. This movement became prevalent about the beginning of the
Christian era and represented an amalgamation of all popular ideas and
superstitions rampant m Chinese society at that time. It is held that the
cult called itself Daoism during the Han dynasty (206 BC - 219 AD) m
order to acquire some respectability, since the contents of the texts of
Laozi and Zhuangzi were ambiguous enough to accommodate its views.

In the religion of salvation, the ambition of Daoists is to acquire material
immortality. To the Daoists, man is formed with a spiritual soul and a
material body, and consists of elements that disperse at death. Immortality
is achieved by conquering these elements that form the body and by
preventing them from dispersing. In order to obtain immortal life, certain
obligations are necessary. First, the body has to be nourished in order to
suppress the causes of decrepitude and to create an embryo endowed with
immortality. Second, the spirit had to be nourished, and this involves
meditation and concentration. Even during the centuries before the
Christian era, Daoists were already engaged in this kind of spiritual
cultivation.

Huang Lao's philosophical theories play a great part in the formation of
Daoism. Huang-Lao advocated quietness and non-action, concepts that
were basically mysterious. The Daoists used the Yin-Yang and Five
Phases to interpret Huang-Lao's theories and these became the primordial
form of Daoism.6

Apart from the influences mentioned above, Confucianism and Moism,
especially the prognostics and the Five Phases, can also be found in the
Daoist literature Taiping Jing and Laozi Xiangerzhu, which have concepts
of filial piety, loyalty, the Yin-Yang theories, calamities and strange
phenomena. The Taiping Jing and Laozi Xiangerzhu, together with the
Moists' Heavenly Wishes, had paved the way for Daoism to teach the way
of spirits and ghosts.7 The Laozi Xiangerzhu is annotations using Laos's

Ancient China, pp. 256-257.

\[7\] The Taiping Jing (Canon of Great Peace and Equality) is the earliest Daoist canon which
highlights virtues and loyalty to the ruler. The Laozi Xiangerzhu is an important canon for

70           THE SINGAPORE BAHAT STUDIES REVIEW

mysticism to explain Laos's concepts and using Laozi 's terminologies to
expound longevity and immortality.

Being the earliest Daoist canon, the Taiping Jing deserves a detailed note
here. Its main features are as follows:

> a. It advocates that it is the primordial qi that generates the Universe.
> b. It deems that qi subdivides into Yin, Yang and Central Harmony.
c. It advocates the theory of Yin, Yang and the Five Phases. It

> emphasizes that man should follow the signs of warning from
> Heaven such as natural calamities and catastrophes and make
> changes.

> d. It advocates that Heaven and man are communicative.
e. It advocates that misdeeds of ancestors will pass down (chengfu) to

their posterity who in turn will bear the sufferings on their behalf.
f. It advocates that each one should try his best, and if so, those of

> middle capability will gain longevity while those below average,
> minor longevity.

The TaipingJing put emphasis on accumulation of good deeds and loyalty
to the sovereign, respecting of teachers as well as being filial to parents.
Its rationale is that a sovereign gives one honour, that is why one should
be loyal to him, while a teacher is where one's wisdom comes from,
therefore due respect should be accorded. In the respect of cultivation, the
Taiping Jing emphasizes:
a. Guard major internal organs and make them firm.
b. Guard that body and spirit be inseparable and form an entity so as to
achieve longevity.
c. Take the qi breath and medicine and follow the formula from canons
when preparing elixirs.
d. It upholds equality and justice as its social ideal.

Buddhism also served as a point of reference, and its rituals as well as its
tenets were also absorbed into the Daoist system.8 Evidence shows that

further understanding the teaching of Wudoumi Daoist Sect (The Five Bushels of Rice
Sect of the Later Han dynasty). In this canon, Dao is the highest god, surpassing all human
beings.

Chinese Religions: Evolution, Compatibility and Adaptability                     71

Daoism drew its tenets from Buddhism. Thus its compatibility or all
embracing nature is revealed. For instance, an important Daoist canon
DongxuanLingbao Jing modelled upon Buddhist sutras in form by
changing Buddhist terminologies and absorbing Buddhist tenets such as
nirvana, retribution and terma. Another Daoist canon, Zhengao copied a
Buddhist sutra Sis hi ferzhang Jing. A third Daoist canon, Taishangdong
Xuanling Baozhi Huidingzhi Tongwei Jing was based on the Buddhist
belief in accumulating merits and upon death ascending to Heavenly
paradise. In fact Daoism's compatibility can be further shown in that it
absorbs some of Confucian concepts such as loyalty, filial piety, propriety
and righteousness for its disciplines. For example, a Daoist canon, Dajue
Shangpin Jing, wished that when a Daoist saw an emperor, he should be
as filial (loyal) to him as he would be to his own parents. Furthermore, the
creation of Daoist gods could be inspired by Buddhism.

Taiping Jing, which already contained tenets, later branched out into two
different Daoist sects. One was the Elixirs Sect while the other was the
Talismans Sect. The highest gods of Daoism are the Three Purities
followed by the Jade Emperor, Heavenly Officials (Tianguan), Earthly
Officials (Diguan), Water Officials (Shuiguan), which are composed of
the pedigree of the Daoist gods. The Daoists also believe that there are
gods everywhere, even in human bodies and organs.

During the Wei-Jin period (220-420 AD), along with the emerging
Daoism, the movement of creating deities was overwhelming. In the
Northern Wei dynasty, Kou Qianzhi (386-448 AD) created gods in the 36
Heavenly Palaces,10 while in the Sung dynasty of the Six Dynasties period
(470-589 AD), Tao Hongjing (456-536 AD) classified 700 gods into nine
levels, each level having a principal god at the center flanked either by
male or female gods.11 Historical figures also had a place in these

Zhongguo Daoshi Shenghuo, p. 38 note no. 4.

\[10\] Kou Qianzhi was an important Daoist in the development of Daoism. In the 36 Heavens
created, each had a palace, presided over by a god. The highest God was "Wuji Zhi Jun"
(The Limitless and Most Sacred Lord). See Re Jiyu, Zhonguo Daojiao Shi, p. 207.

\[11\] Tao Hongjing was also an important Daoist in the development of Daoism. He
constructed the system and hierarchy of gods and immortality. See Ren Jiyu, Zhongguo
Daojiao Shi, pp. 179-183.

72           THE SINGAPORE BAHAT STUDIES REVIEW

hierarchies.12 Tao Hongjing was very intelligent and widely read.
Normally Daoists pursued immortality. This might be regarded as
religious illusion, but because of Tao Hongjing's vast scholarship, while
he practised Daoism, he delved deeply into research and he composed,
valuable canons such as Zhengao, Dengzhen Yinlunjue and Bencao Jizhu.
He contributed extensively in alchemy and in establishing the Maoshan
Daoist Sect.

The Daoists believed death was the disintegration of corpse and soul, and
another way to attain salvation was ascendance into Heaven. There are
altogether 36 heavenly palaces in the sky as mentioned earlier. The
immortals are classified into three types. The first type is those who can
fly, the second are those who wander around. Those who cannot ascend to
Heaven live in caves on earth or on islands. There are 10 caves and 36
minor caves and 72 places of blessings, which occupy all the major scenic
places on earth.13

3\. The Spread and Adaptability of Buddhism into China

The dream of Emperor Ming (58-75 AD) of the Han dynasty has often
been connected with the introduction of Buddhism to China. Briefly, the
episode was as follows: One night in a dream, Emperor Ming saw a
golden deity flying in front of his palace, and the next day he asked his
ministers to explain the identity of this deity. One of them, Fu Yi, replied
that he heard there was a sage in India who had attained salvation and
became Buddha, who was able to fly and whose body was of a gold hue.
He went on to say that the deity seen in the dream was this Buddha. The
emperor accepted his explanation and dispatched envoys abroad to learn
more about this sage and his teachings. The envoys returned bringing
back with them a Sutra in 42 Sections, which was received by the emperor
and deposited in a temple constructed outside the walls of the capital
Loyang.14 In fact, Buddhism had already existed in China slightly earlier

than the later part of the Han dynasty, though its influence was
insignificant.15

a. Buddhist teachings in the Han dynasty

Among the many tenets of Buddhism, were the indestructibility of the
soul and the circle of rebirth and karma. In the beginning, Chinese
Buddhists had difficulty understanding the idea of repeated rebirths
without some entity linking together the different stages of rebirth. To
overcome this difficulty, they evolved the concept of Shenling, or an
indestructible soul that is transmitted through successive rebirths. Man
consists of a material body and a spiritual soul. The body comes into
being at birth and disintegrates at death, but the soul is indestructible and
eternal. Due to the effects of the karma, this soul is forever bound to the
circle of rebirths. The Hou Hanji of Yuan Hing (318-376), summarized
these different arguments succinctly. The Buddhists also teach that when a
person dies, his soul does not perish, but is reborn and assumes another
form. The meritorious and evil deeds performed during one's lifetime all
have their rewards and punishments. Therefore, the Hou Hanji values the
practice of meritorious deeds and the cultivation of the way so as to
discipline the soul. By so doing, they are able to attain nirvana and
become Buddha.

b. Period of Preparation

By the end of the Han dynasty, two different trends had already developed
in Buddhism. One was the Dhyana School with its emphasis on mind
cultivation and the suppression of passions. It was Hinayana in nature.
The chief transmitter was An Xigao of Persian origin.

Contrary to this school was the Prajna School. It was based largely on the
translation of Chih Ch'an and was Mahayana inclined. It was more
interested in probing the nature of the Buddha and ultimate reality behind
the external appearance of things. Beginning in the middle of the third
century, this sect of Buddhism was to grow and develop until it became
dominant within Buddhism in the Southern Dynasties (470-589 AD). The

\[15\] For detailed discussion, see D. Ikeda (Author), Burton Watson (Translator) The Flower
of Chinese Buddhism, pp. 9-13.

popularity of the Prajna School brought about two results: 1) The spread
of Mahayana Buddhism in China; 2) the development of close relations
between Buddhist monks and the Chinese literati who embraced the
thoughts of Laozi and Zhuangzi, especially those of quietness and non-
activity.

Early translators of Buddhist texts were almost all foreigners (non-
Chinese). At the end of the Eastern Han Dynasty (617-420 AD), a
prominent translator, An Xigao, was the son of a Persian king who had
abdicated the throne. The most prominent translator was Lokaraksa (Zhi
Loujiaqian), from Great Yuezhi (Kushana), and according to Chu Sanzang
Ji (Translation of Tripitaka and other Miscellaneous Essays), there were
30 sutras translated by him.

At the end of the Three Kingdoms period, Indian and Central Asian
monks came to China in order to spread Buddhism. Some came from
Indo-China, but whether they were Indo-Chinese is not clear. Among
them, the most prominent one was Dhamarkala        (Tangke Jialuo). A
learned man, he was born in India and was familiar with astrology. His
major contribution to Chinese Buddhism was the translation of the
Buddhist Laws. Another translator by the name of Zhiqian, was of Great
Yuezhi origin but was totally sinicised. He began to study foreign
languages at the age of 13, and was proficient in 6 languages. He
translated 30 sutras into Chinese.16

Kang Senghui was of Kangju origin (Sogdina, in present day
Samarkand). The family lived in India for generations.His father was a
merchant who migrated to Kochin (Jiaozhi). Both Zhiqian and Kang
Senghui were bilingual in Central Asian languages and Chinese.

In Western Jm (265-316 AD), QiYu came to China from Funan (present
Cambodia) and then to Kochin, eventually arrived in Xiangyang of Hubei
via Guangzhou, Yuchang (present day Nanchang) and Hunan. Another
monk Zhu Shulan, of Indian origin, was born in Henan. He was the
translator of important sutras such as Fangguang Panruo Jing (a version
of Prajna Sutra) and Weimoji Jing {Vimalakirti Sutra), which amounted

\[16\] See Kamata Shigeo's book translated into Chinese titled Zhongguo Fojiao Tongshi, Vol.
l , p . 155 and pp. 195-199.

to more than 100,000 words. Zhu was proficient in Chinese and several
Central Asian languages, and his translations were precise and accurate.

Among these translators, Kumarajiva (active around 400 AD) was the
greatest translator of Buddhist texts17. He was well versed in Buddhist
philosophy and learned in medicine, astronomy, exegetics, technology and
logic. Being proficient in Indian and Chinese languages, his translations
were not only noted for their skill and beauty of language, but also for
their accuracy. It was generally believed that later, the great Chinese
translator of Buddhist texts, Xuanzang (602-624) of the Tang dynasty,
surpassed him almost in every sutra ever translated. In actual fact, some of
Kurarajiva's translations remained standard despite efforts put in by
Xuanzang to re-translate them.

As the Sanskrit language was very difficult and the translators were not
always accurate, there were a number of monks who braved the
geographical distance and climate and went to India through Central Asia
to obtain the authentic meanings of the sutras.

One of the pioneers was Fa Xiang (340-420 AD).18 He recorded the
following: "In the deserts were numerous evil spirits and scorching winds,
causing death to anyone who would meet them. Above there were no
birds, while on the ground there were no animals. One looked as far as
one could in all directions for a path to cross, but there were none to
choose. Only the dry bones of the dead served as indications...."

On crossing the Pamirs, he wrote, "The path was difficult and rocky and
ran along a cliff extremely steep. The mountain itself was one sheer wall
of rock 8000 feet high, and as one approached it, one became dizzy. If one
wished to advance, there was no place for him to place his feet. Below
was the Indus River.. ,."19

Despite these dangers and hardships in succeeding centuries, many other
Chinese monks followed in his footsteps and went to India to acquire the
wisdom of the Indians, and returned to China to transmit the sutras to their

fellow Chinese. This period was a period of preparation for Chinese
Buddhism. In the beginning, only a limited number of sutras were
available, and there were no outstanding Chinese monks at all. By the end
of Eastern Jin in 420 AD, some of the most eminent monks had completed
their tasks and had made available important Mahayana texts such as the
Lotus Sutra and the Nirvana Sutra.

More important was the fact that this period witnessed Chinese Buddhism
developing along two divergent lines in the north and south. In the North,
the emphasis of the Buddhist monk was upon rendering service in the
form of military and diplomatic counsel to the non-Chinese rulers of the
era. The relationship cultivated greatly benefited the development of
Buddhism at a later stage.

c. Growth in the period of disunity (Northern and Southern Dynasties)

When the Han dynasty fell in AD 220, Buddhism was barely able to
maintain its existence in Chinese soil and had to seek support from
Daoism to retain its foothold. By the time the country was reunited in 581
AD (the Sui dynasty), however, Buddhism had spread to all parts of the
empire; converts had been made in all strata of society; images, statues
and temples were prevalent everywhere; and a great source of literature
had accumulated. There were 1768 temples and 24000 monks and 2846
nuns in the Sung dynasty. It was said that the number of Buddhist texts
circulated exceeded the number of Confucian texts by several tens to a
hundred times. And in the region of the Yangtze and south, where the
Liang dynasty ruled from 502-557 AD, there are reported to have been
over 2,800 temples and 82,700 monks and nuns. In addition, of course,
there must have been great numbers of lay believers.20

A conspicuous point of Buddhist adaptability was that Chinese Buddhism
espoused the cardinal Confucian virtue of filial piety. Once a person
joined the monastic order, he severed all relations with his family and
society, so that he was no longer bound to honour his ancestors. Yet in the
description found at Yunkang and Longmen, there were indications that

p.31.

donors prayed for their ancestors to attain meritorious rebirths in paradise.
Stupas of Buddhas were erected to perpetuate the memory of their
parents. This shows that Buddhism adapted itself to suit Chinese
customs.21
Among the factors causing Buddhism's growth in the period of disunity
were:

a. Its attraction to the commoners

Among the Buddhist monks in north China during the period of disunity
there were many who were proficient in the interpretation of charms, or
who claimed to be able to predict the future. By such powers of
prognostication, Buddhist monks were able to gain wide attention among
the general public. Such feats attracted both the common people and the
ruling classes. By giving advice on the outcome of military movements or
the reliability of some of the officials, the monks obtained state support
and patronization.

Karma, the doctrine of personal reward and retribution gave hope to those
who were sunk in hardship and misery during the period of uncertainly.
The ideal held by Mahayana was that all creatures, no matter how low or
humble, possessed the Buddha nature and so were capable of attaining
Buddhahood and salvation. Such a noble ideal had never been put forth
before common Chinese people until this time, and it acted like a magnet,
drawing people to Buddhism. Mahayana's repetition of the names of
Amitaba also made the path leading to this type of salvation very easy.

b. The attraction to the intellectuals

The failure of the Confucian system to provide a satisfactory outlet for the
religious aspirations of the Chinese people also contributed to the growth
of Buddhism. Individuals normally desired communion with deities to
find solace for their own sorrows and disappointments, or to ask for divine
assistance when their earthly burdens seemed too heavy to bear. Such

Zhexueyu Zongjiao, pp. 108-110; see also Kamata Shigeo, Zhongguo Fojiao Tongshi,

exchanges of Buddhism and Confucian are useful for a quick reference.

earthly burdens tend to become accentuated in times of uncertainty and
instability.

Confucianism, with its lack of emphasis on the spiritual world (one of its
most important doctrines advocated respect for the spirits while still
keeping them at distance) was too earth -bound and practical to satisfy the
religious yearning of common people. Buddhism stepped in to fill this
gap. It brought with it a host of deities in the form of ever compassionate
and merciful Bodhisattvas, always ready to supply aid to those who
sought their assistance. It dazzled the Chinese with a brilliant hierarchy of
heavens, and rebirth, which was held up as the reward for meritorious
living on earth. At the same time, it depicted hells, where the tortures
became progressively more terrifying. As a Chinese philosopher Hu Shi
once expressed it, the Chinese were so captivated by this colourful
pageantry of heavens and hells that they succumbed easily to the Buddhist
religion.

c. Maturity and acceptance

After adequate preparation, Chinese Buddhism flourished and bloomed in
the Tang Dynasty and developed its own characteristics. A lot of Yijing
(modified sutras) were created . These modified sutras first appear in the
Southern dynasties, and later on, more and more of such sutras emerged.
The mixing of these sutras with a number of Chinese teachings, enhanced
their Chineseness. There were altogether 209 such sutras according to
Seng Zhao'sXinji Yiping Weizhuan Jilu22

4\. The Synthesis of the Three Teachings

Ever since the introduction of Buddhism into China, the three teachings
have always been intertwined through conflict and synthesis. Buddhism as
an alien religion, naturally faced the resistance of Chinese culture,
especially by Confucianism. The main conflict was between Buddhism,
Confucianism and Daoism, while the conflict between Confucianism and

\[22\] See K. Shigeo, Zhongguo Fojiao Tongshi, pp. 171-174.

Daoism was minor. This was because Confucianism and Daoism had their
roots m the same culture, complementing and supplementing each other.23

During the Eastern Jm dynasty, despite general antagonism towards
Buddhism, we can already see the amalgamation of Confucianism and
Buddhism. There were scholars such as Dao'An (312-385 AD), who were
born into traditional Confucian families. He studied under FoTucheng for
14 years. At the age of 38, he went to Hengshan of the Taihang Ranges,
and later he returned to Jizhou in Hebei, and from Jizhou later he lived for
15 years in Xiangyang of Hubei where he had hundred of followers and
his influence even extended to Jingzhou. He was captured in Chang'an
where he died 5 or 6 years later. He was skilled at composing poems, well
versed in Confucian classics and Buddhist sutras (jing), the disciplines
(lu) and treaties (lun).24

In fact, Eastern Jin was the earliest meeting point of Confucianism,
Daoism and Buddhism and the place where they adopted many aspects of
one another. Through various conflicts and competition, the merging of
the three religions into a single religion commenced. This was typified by
the case of Su Chuo (?- 367 AD). He was fond of Laozi and Zhuangzi and
was fascinated by the hermit's life style. Yet he took up government posts
as the Confucianists did. He had, to his credit, writings on Confucianism
and Buddhism.25 He deemed the Confucian sages to be equal to Buddhist
saints. He combined Confucianism and Buddhism's views in his writing,
Yudaolun (Essays Revealing the Dao).26

Though there were efforts to reconcile the three religions, unfortunately,
the conflicts between these three teachings mixed with unending political
struggles. Buddhism was persecuted bitterly twice in the Northern
Dynasties. Each time monasteries were demolished and sutras were burnt,
monks were secularised.27 But Buddhism tried to maintain its own
characteristics, and at the same time, it tried to adapt to new
circumstances. This approach worked quite well, and Buddhism
succeeded in becoming part of the Chinese culture.

\[27\] c/f the description of Dasaku Ikeda, The Flower of Chinese Buddhism , pp. 153-168.

Buddhism emphasized the renouncing of the world, which contradicts
Chinese cultural beliefs. Therefore it had to reach a compromise with
Chinese culture. The Mouzi Liuhelun is a work representing a general
view of the people of the Wei-Jin period (220-420 AD), it attacked
Buddhist sutras, saying that they were alien and would not be accepted by
ru Confucianism. In addition, the fact that Buddhism advocated the
renouncing of the world and destroyed one's outward appearance, meant
it was not compatible with Confucian ethics. Further, Buddhism talked
about rebirths and karma, and this too did not match Confucian teachings.

The Buddhists refuted the incompatibility accusations, arguing that
whatever is good should be adopted, and that they should not necessarily
adopt these teachings from Confucius and other sages. On top of this, the
distinction between Chinese and alien people were not so clear-cut. The
Confucian sages, such as the great Yu were of Qiang origin (probably a
north western tribe in China)28 and thus, not Chinese. The Buddhists'
renunciation of their families was a minor matter when compared to moral
cultivation, and Buddhists do have moral cultivation. On top of that, if
Buddhists have achieved Buddhahood and have returned to help their
parents and brothers, they are also filial or even better. The Chinese
custom of invoking ghosts and offering sacrifices is no different from the
Buddhist karma.

In the 2nd century, there was a legend that Laozi went to the West to
educate the barbarians; this legend was purposely fabricated to show the
superiority of Chinese culture.29 In order to gain a foothold in China,
Buddhists tolerated this fabrication. They even said that Laozi and
Confucius were saints of Buddhism.

During the Six Dynasties (235-589 AD), the cultural exchanges between
religions were more thorough. Buddhism had ambitions not only to
convince Daoists and Confucianists, but also to win superiority, to be

298).

ranked first in the hierarchy. Confucianism and Daoism were reluctant to
give up their own orthodox status; so heated debates took place.30 The
issues were as follows: the distinction between Chinese and alien people,
whether monks should show respect to emperors and kowtow to them or
not; and the belief in the indestructibility of a soul.

Monk Seng You (445-518 AD)31 argued that the territorial distinction
between China and alien states was not fixed. The sages held in high
esteem by the Chinese, such as Emperors Yu and Shun, were not of
Chinese origin. The Chinese upheld this distinction out of ethnic pride.
Of course, this was conservative and harmful because it blocked the path
of cultural interactions with other civilizations.

The issue of whether monks should kowtow to emperors reflects the
contradictions between Buddhism and the ruling regimes. The monks
were forbidden to kowtow to common people and even to their parents.
But the supremacy of emperors was so deeply rooted in Chinese culture,
that this problem was not easy to solve.
Monk Hue Yuan (334-416 AD)32 explained that living in the mundane
world is different from renouncing the world; therefore monks do not
have to kowtow to emperors. The argument also abated for a while but
recurred during the Tang Dynasty. Both parties eventually compromised
agreeing that monks did not have to kowtow to emperors, but should
acknowledge themselves as subjects of the emperor.

In the South Dynasty, Buddhists believed that the soul was indestructible.
They likened souls to firewood and fire. Hueyuan said that fire was passed
onto wood, and when the wood finished, the fire could be passed on to
another piece of wood, likewise, the soul was passed onto the body, and

\[30\] The debates on the ranking of the three religions and related issues took place from 463-
466 about 8 different times under the reign of Emperor Wu of Liang dynasty (See K.
Shigeo, op. ci., pp. 451-478). The struggles were on and off throughout the history of
China. The ranking was not always in this manner: Daoism followed by Buddhism and
Confucianism. It all depended on the liking and sponsorship of each individual emperor.

Zongjiao Tongshi, pp. 418-420; see also Yu Xueming and Chen Hong, Zhongguo Gudai di

when the body decomposes, the soul can be passed onto other forms, and
therefore souls were indestructible. This is the origin of the theory of
retribution.

But in the Qi-Liang period (479-557 AD), Fan Zhen challenged this
theory. He regarded soul and body as an organic entity. Fan asserted that
the fate of different people was different, and this was not the result of
retribution. He considered man's fate to be like the flowers on a tree.
When a flower falls on a carpet, he is lucky enough; but if it drops in the
mud, he is unlucky. He said this was natural and contingent, not
predestined. Fan was very famous and influential, and many intellectuals
followed the debate closely.

Thus, we can see that from Eastern Jin to the South dynasties, there was a
period of conflict, but by obtaining gradual consensus, compatibility
emerged. Buddhism tried hard to identify its similarities with the other
two religions, at the same time Confucianism and Daoism also tried to
adapt the Buddhist way of thinking. Within the spirit of mutual
understanding, the three religions were involved in gradually merging into
one. Buddhism became more sinicised and had a new direction. It placed
emphasis on the heart and mind, and influenced the Chinese culture
immensely.

In Tang times, the issue of supremacy continued to spark conflicts. From
the Sui dynasty to mid-Tang, the translation of Buddhism was extensive
and was fully absorbed by the Chinese intellectuals; Confucianists were
amazed that they were short of such profundity. Ever since the Wei-Jin
dynasties (220-420 AD), Daoism had continuously learned from
Buddhism in the areas of thought, ritual, organization and canon, while
Confucianism from late Tang, commenced to absorb Buddhist and
Daoists ideas in order to revive itself. On the other hand, Buddhism also
absorbed the Daoist's nourishment of life, and incorporated the filial piety
of Confucianism into its system of beliefs. Thus, the synthesis of the three
was complete at the end of the late Tang dynasty.

5\. Conclusion

The above paper has portrayed some characteristics of Chinese culture,
especially in the area of religion. China was, and will be a great political
and economic entity. Its contacts with other cultures are wide and
extensive. It will also continue to be so in the Information Technology age
and more globalized environment. History shows that it is difficult for a
great culture to survive without any adaptation to new challenges; it is
very difficult for any great culture to survive if it is not broad -minded
and adaptable!

By accepting an injection of new blood to revitalize itself, Chinese
culture, like any other culture in the world, will proceed in this direction.
