> **Abstract:** This is one among eight Persian poems Bahá'u'lláh signed “Dervish.” They were most probably written in Kurdistan, where Bahá’u’lláh remained from 10 April 1854 to 19 March 1856. It is a _ghazal,_ meaning a mystical "song" or "elegy of love" about The Beloved, being God or His representative on earth.
