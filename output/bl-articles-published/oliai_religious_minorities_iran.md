Religious Minorities in Iran: Baha’is, Jews, and the
Islamic State

Introduction

The 1979 Islamic Revolution ushered in a new way of
constructing the Iranian nation-state. The state was no longer
defined in terms of its connections to its ancient empires and
monarchical past; rather the new regime sought to define Iran as a
national community united under Shi’a Islamic principles. In this
new national construction, Ayatollah Rouhollah Khomeini and the
leading clerics’ understanding of Shi’ism were incorporated within a
new government structure to form the Islamic Republic of Iran and
establish Islam as the state’s official religion.

While the vast majority (89%) of Iran’s population is Shi’a
(“The World Factbook: Iran” 2010), the institutionalization of Islam
has significantly affected Iran’s religious minority communities. The
Iranian constitution recognizes Christianity, Judaism, and
Zoroastrianism as the only protected minority religions, but the

experiences of the Baha’i and Jewish communities have been
especially unique considering their relationships to the Islamic state.
Although there is significant scholarship about the impact of the
Islamic Revolution on Iranian women, far less prominent work
focuses on the Revolution’s effects on Iranian religious minority
groups. Meanwhile, the persecution these groups face only
intensifies. The discrimination faced by these specific groups is best
understood in terms of the challenges that they pose to the
authenticity of the Islamic state and its vision of the Islamic Iranian
nation-state.

Iran’s Established Islamic Identity

The Shi’a Islamic national identity is constructed within the
Iranian state through the Islamic government. Iran’s highly complex
theocracy “mixes elements of both civic and exclusionary nationalist
traditions” and the state defines national membership by its
members’ willingness to “accept the rule of the supreme jurisprudent
and to be subordinate to the apparatus of Islamic law” (Cole 2005,
128). National identity and belonging within the Iranian nation is
conditional on accepting the Islamic state as the ultimate authority.
One of the primary ways that this religious authority is built into the
nation-state’s structure is through Ayatollah Khomeini’s concept of
velayat-e faqih, the rule by the Islamic jurisprudents and the basis of the
Supreme Leader’s position within the Iranian government.
Khomeini was the first to argue that in the absence of the Twelfth
Imam (the Mahdi), religious scholars and especially the jurists among
them should serve as the political leaders for the community in
addition to providing religious guidance (Dorraj et. al. 2008, 510). He
justifies this position by arguing that there is no distinction between
religion and politics in Islam (Dorraj et. al. 2008, 510). Toward the
end of Khomeini’s life when the issue of determining a suitable
successor came to light, Khomeini accommodated Ayatollah Ali
Khamenei’s lack of religious credentials by refining his argument
about velayat-e faqih. Under his new interpretation of the concept,
Khomeini argued that while clerical rule is desirable, those in the
clergy more knowledgeable in the economic, social, and political

arenas should rule instead of clerics solely knowledgeable in religious
scholarship (Dorraj et. al. 2008, 512).

Efforts to limit the role of the clerics within the government
have been made but thus far have not materialized into meaningful
changes. Former president Ayatollah Mohammad Khatami
attempted to change the constitution in order to increase the powers
of the presidency, but such efforts were effectively shut down by the
Khamenei and his supporters (Aramesh 2010). Recently, President
Mahmoud Ahmadinejad’s cabinet has called for a curtailment of the
Expediency Council, chaired since its establishment in 1988 by his
largest political rival, Ayatollah Ali-Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani
(Aramesh 2010). The Expediency Council’s main duties are to
reconcile differences between the Majles (parliament) and the
Guardian Council (the council comprised of 12 clerics who must
approve legislation and vet presidential, parliamentary, and Assembly
of Experts candidates (“Iran: Who Holds the Power?” 2010)), as well
as to provide advice to the Supreme Leader. Although Khamenei has
not yet declared a definite position regarding changes to the
constitution, “major factions within the ruling conservative coalition
are strongly opposed to any constitutional changes” (Aramesh 2010).

In addition to Khomeini’s principle of clerical rule, the
constitution of the Islamic Republic is an extremely important
document for examining the place of religious minorities in a nation
that defines itself and its borders in religious terms. The Iranian
constitution “clearly marks the ideology of the state with respect to
notions of citizenship; nationality; religious minorities, including non-
Shi’a Muslims; and what it means to be Iranian” (Price 2005, 310).
At the time of the 1979 Revolution, Iran’s population was 93% Shi’a,
5% Sunni, and 2% others; the largest non-Islamic communities
remain the Baha’i, Jewish, Zoroastrian, and Christian groups (Price
2005, 310). Despite non-Shi’a Muslims comprising a very small
percentage of the country’s population (7% total), four (5%) of the
73 total representatives that drafted the Islamic Republic’s
constitution were from non-Muslim groups, excluding the Baha’is
(Price 2005, 311). Fifty-five representatives (75% of total

representatives) were clergy members and over 50 were members of
the Islamic Republican Party (Price 2005, 311).

Islamic National Construction through the Constitution

The Iranian constitution first asserts Shi’a Islam as the
framework with which to construct the nation through several
articles in the constitution that state the supremacy of Islam,
establishing it as the official religion of the state. Of the initial
constitutional articles, the first and the fourth are most important in
clearly establishing Shi’a Islam and Islamic law as the government and
legal system to be followed by the new Islamic state. The first article
states that “the form of government in Iran is that of an Islamic
Republic,” followed by the fourth article’s declaration that all laws
and regulations must be based on Islamic criteria establishing the
Guardian Council as the judges in such matters (“Islamic Republic of
Iran Government Constitution” 2010). These two articles illustrate
the implementation of Khomeini’s argument regarding the complete
lack of separation between religion and state in government. Article
12 specifically identifies which school of Islam will be followed by
the state as the Twelver Jafari School of Shi’a Islam while also
recognizing the rights of followers of many other schools of Islam
within the state as well.

The constitution goes further in its establishment of Shi’a
Islam as the official state religion and basis for its legal code; the
constitution explicitly recognizes its importance to the formation of
national identity. Article 11 is most important in this regard, stating
that “all Muslims form a single nation, and the government of the
Islamic Republic of Iran has the duty of formulating its general
policies” (“Islamic Republic of Iran Government Constitution”
2010). The implications for national identity are made clear within
this article. The state is to be a community of Muslims, specifically
Shi’a, whose membership and acceptance within this nation and its
borders is to be determined by acceptance of this understanding of
Islam. The oaths taken by specific members of government as stated
in the constitution also construct national borders and reinforce
Islam’s supremacy within the nation-state. Article 67 details the oath

taken by Majles representatives. Although the four Majles
representatives of the recognized religious minority groups swear the
oath on their own holy books, part of the representatives’ oath as
representatives includes swearing to protect the sanctity of Islam and
guard the accomplishments and foundations of the Islamic Republic.
The oath of the directly-elected president includes swearing to guard
the official religion of the country.

One of the tools through which the government can assert its
authority is the military apparatus, and it is used by the Islamic regime
to enforce its ideal vision of Iranian national identity. Article 144
delegates this authority to the Islamic army with the duty of
protecting the Islamic state. No religious minorities are exempt from
the 18 months of mandatory military service for men, but the law still
reproduces societal discrimination within the military’s structure,
forbidding “non-Muslims from holding officer positions over
Muslims” (“Iran” 2010). Though college-educated members of
recognized religious minorities can serve as officers during their
mandatory military service, they cannot become career military
officers. (“Iran” 2010).
Iran’s constitution also directly addresses the topic of minority
religions. There are several specific constitutional provisions about
certain religious communities in Iran. Article 13 explicitly recognizing
Zoroastrians, Christians, and Jews as the only recognized religious
minorities in Iran able to “perform their own religious rites, and to
act according to their own canon in personal matters and religious
education” (“Islamic Republic of Iran Government Constitution”
2010). Article 14 goes on to state that Iran and its Muslims must
treat all non-Muslims in accordance with “ethical norms and the
principles of Islamic justice and equity,” but adds the caveat of only
doing so for those who “refrain from engaging in conspiracy or
activity against Islam and the Islamic Republic of Iran” (“Islamic
Republic of Iran Government Constitution” 2010). Despite the
universal recognition of rights for all citizens, many of the non-
Muslims that were persecuted by the state had charges of conspiracy
leveled against them.

The formation of political and religious groups is addressed
in Article 26. The article allows for specifically recognized minorities
to form such groups, provided that they do not violate principles of
“independence, freedom, national unity, the criteria of Islam, or the
basis of the Islamic Republic” (“Islamic Republic of Iran
Government Constitution” 2010). The final article of the
constitution that directly addresses religious minorities and their place
within the Iranian state is Article 64, detailing the division of Majles
representatives for minority religious groups. According to this
article, the recognized religious minorities are allowed four
representatives in Majles. The Jewish and Zoroastrian communities
elect one Majles representative each, the Assyrian and Chaldean
Christians jointly elect a single representative, and the Armenian
Christians elect their own representative.

General Policies towards Recognized Religious Minorities

Despite the constitutional recognition that these recognized
religious authorities receive in Iran, this rhetoric underscores the
implications of living under the Islamic regime, which became clear
during the regime’s early years. In 1980, Ayatollah Allameh Yahya
Nuri argued that “an individual’s geographical, national, ethnic, or
linguistic background” was not important; as long as “they share[d]
the beliefs of Islam,” there would be no discrimination (Sanasarian
2000, 30). Despite the legal recognition of specific minority religious
groups, not adhering to Shi’a Islam became grounds for
discrimination in the Islamic state (Sanasarian 2000, 30), and these
inequalities continue in Iranian jurisprudence today. In 1981, the
Majles were presented with the Islamic penal code and despite
widespread criticism by Iranian religious minorities, the code was
approved in 1982 (Price 2005, 311). In its classification of crimes and
their punishments, the code places greater severity on non-Muslims
as well as crimes and/or interactions occurring between Muslims and
non-Muslims (Price 2005, 311). Examples include significant
differences in sentencing for murder and adultery between men and
women of different faiths (Sanasarian 2000, 25), the greater severity
of capital punishment applied to non-Muslim offenders, as well as

the required amounts of financial compensation for various crimes
(Sanasarian 2000, 132-133).

In light of constitutional articles 13 and 26, recognized
religious minorities are allowed to assemble and manage their own,
smaller courts for addressing family matters, personal disputes,
marriage, divorce, and inheritance (Sanasarian 2000, 312). However,
the Islamic regime maintains its hegemony in this sphere of civil life
as well. These courts and their rulings are subject to supervision and
final approval by the Islamic state authorities. Committees
comprised of recognized religious minorities make decisions
regarding marriage, divorce, custody, and inheritance, but the final
decisions are determined by the state agency in charge of the
particular case (Sanasarian 2000, 75). While the decisions of these
committees are generally upheld, the role of the Islamic state as the
final arbiter in the recognized minority religions’ separate courts
seems to directly oppose Article 13’s provisions for free practice of
these recognized religions; in reality, the article’s phrasing “within the
limits of the law” curtails such practice.

Disputes between Muslims and non-Muslims are only
addressed in Islamic courts, placing the non-Muslims at a
disadvantaged because of the legal system’s differential treatment of
each group (Price 2005, 312). Recognized religious minority groups
are encouraged to convert to Shi’a Islam, and if one family member
does so, he or she inherits all of the property of his or her non-
Muslim relatives (Price 2005, 312). Furthermore, due to the concept
of the velayat-e faqih and the position of the Supreme Leader within
the government as the highest religious and political authority in the
state, the Supreme Leader’s authority is considered divine; therefore,
no aspect of legislation or state practice contrary to his ruling or
religious opinion can be implemented (Alexander and Hoenig 2008,
13).

Supervision by the regime is not limited only to minority
courts. The regime still asserts its authority over recognized religious
minorities by controlling their ceremonies and public gatherings.
Recognized religious minorities are allowed to have their religious
ceremonies but government officials must be notified ahead of time

and speeches to public gatherings must be submitted in advance to
the Ministry of Culture and Islamic Guidance for approval
(Sanasarian 2000, 74). Speeches in languages other than Persian must
also be submitted with the original text as well as a Persian translation
to the Ministry’s Department of Religious Minorities for approval
(Sanasarian 2000, 74). Even something as simple as annual calendars
marking religious holidays and events must be reviewed by the
Ministry’s Department of Publications for approval prior to
distribution. Proselytizing of any sort within these documents is also
prohibited (Sanasarian 2000, 74). These myriad requirements exist
for religious minority groups and serve as yet another means of
curtailing rights and the practice of recognized minority religions;
such encompassing requirements are not applied to practitioners of
Shi’a Islam.

The state also exerts its domination over religious minorities
in the sphere of education. Recognized religious minorities are
allowed to have their own religious schools, and Jewish communities
have schools that teach Hebrew (Vivier-Muresan 2007, 600). Despite
these legal rights, recognized religious minorities often find them to
be significantly undermined by government policies enforced in
contradiction to these rights. In 1981, the Ministry of Education and
Training (MET) determined that religious education must be taught
in Persian, a single religious textbook written by MET must be used
in the classroom, schools must request special permission for
conducting any secular and religious ceremonies, and female students
and teachers must observe Islamic dress codes (Sanasarian 2000, 80).
The MET’s book, Religious Studies Specifically for Religious Minorities: Jews,
Zoroastrians, Christians, was to be used in the single religion course
offered by minority groups’ schools; this course was to be taught by a
Muslim teacher for a minimum of three hours per week (Sanasarian
Religion classes were not the only classes where the state
chose special textbooks and curriculum. In addition to the special
religious text, “non-Muslim students read the same texts used by
Muslim students throughout the nation…textbooks were agents of
socialization for the new generation, with the goal of forming a ‘new

Islamic person’ in Iran” (Sanasarian 2000, 83). In order to gain
entrance to universities, all students, including recognized religious
minorities, must pass an examination in Islamic theology and obtain
approval from the MET on their moral conduct and qualifications
(Sanasarian 2000, 83). Students were graded by their Muslim
principals who sometimes abused this role (Sanasarian 2000, 84).
The exams were especially difficult for non-Muslim students in
competition with their Muslim peers as well as their instructors’
evaluations, and while “minority students continued to attend
universities and major in various fields, their numbers compared to
the pre-revolutionary era went down considerably” (Sanasarian 2000,
84).

Restrictions on religious educational institutions only
increased. In 1983, several significant changes occurred that served
to further reduce the freedoms of these recognized religious minority
schools (Sanasarian 2000, 77). First, there was widespread
appointment of Muslim principals, teachers, and clerics to minority
religious schools. Secondly, there was significant teaching time
reduction or complete elimination of languages other than Persian
within the classroom. Finally, interference in the actual teaching of
minority religions became even more overt. The end result of these
and similar policies is that religious minority children became both
direct and indirect targets of socialization and Islamic proselytizing
(Sanasarian 2000, 83). Viewed as transients on their way to becoming
Muslims rather than being fully allowed to maintain and practice their
religious beliefs, “the role of a theocracy [became] to facilitate this
change, gradually, while maintaining their rights as the respected and
protected People of the Book” (Sanasarian 2000, 83).

The Baha’i Experience in Post-Revolutionary Iran
The Baha’i faith, based on the teachings of the Bab and Bahaullah,
was established with Bahaullah’s revelation in 1863; its administrative
system was implemented while Shoghi Effendi, Bahaullah’s eldest
grandson, served as the faith’s guardian between 1921 and 1957
(Dorraj et. al. 2008, 61). Prior to the 1979 Iranian revolution, there
were an estimated 150,000 to 300,000 Baha’is in Iran (Price 2005,

319). As of 2008, it is estimated that there approximately five million
Baha’is worldwide, about 300,000 living in Iran alone (Dorraj et. al.
Since its foundation, the Baha’i experience in Iran has been
characterized by severe repression which was intensified with the
establishment of the Islamic Republic. Baha’is are not a recognized
religious minority, and the Islamic government continued this poor
treatment of Baha’is through systematic discrimination and
persecution. In a 1983 interview, Iranian Prosecutor General Seyyed
Hossien Musavi Tabrizi definitively stated that “any organized Baha’i
activity was against the law” (Sanasarian 2000, 119). Furthermore,
the Hojjatieh Society, of which Ahmadinejad is a member, is one of
the most important actors against Iranian Baha’is to this day.
Originally founded in the 1950s, the organization identified the
eradication of the Baha’i faith as one of its central goals (Dorraj et. al.
2008, 62). The group is a strong supporter of the private sector
businesses and free trade, and its members are “religious
fundamentalists with a strong anti-Baha’i and anti-Communist stand”
(Sanasarian 2000, 120). Hojjatieh members infiltrated Baha’i groups
and organizations, gaining access to Baha’i registration books and
confidential correspondences. Their actions, coupled with similar
information obtained from SAVAK, resulted in sweeping arrests and
executions of Iranian Baha’is after the Revolution (Sanasarian 2000,
120).
Of such arrests and executions, those of Mihdi Anvari and
Hidayatu’llah Dihqani in Shiraz on March 17, 1981, are especially
significant. The two men were charged with collaborating with Shah
Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, espionage activities on Israel’s behalf, and
complicity in plots against the Islamic Republic (Nash 1982, 115-
116). The guilty verdict and subsequent executions of these two men
became the first time that membership in Baha’i organizations and
institutions was made a capital offense; the precedent set by this case
has been followed in subsequent cases (Nash 1982, 115-116).
Violent actions were also taken against the Baha'i community’s
leadership. On August 21, 1980, all nine Baha’i National Spiritual
Assembly of Iran members were arrested by Revolutionary Guards

and disappeared (Sanasarian 2000, 116). In accordance with Baha’i
rules, nine more leaders were elected, eight of whom were later
arrested on December 13, 1981; these eight were secretly executed
two weeks later (Sanasarian 2000, 116).
The Islamic Republic and its fundamentalist supporters lashed out in
other ways against the Baha’i community as well. One of the most
significant actions against the community was the destruction of the
House of Bab in Shiraz, the holiest Baha’i site in Iran. The House
was demolished on March 24, 1980, with participation by the local
government of Shiraz (Dorraj et. al. 2008, 62). The Islamic regime
stated the incident was an act of vandalism, but Baha’is argue that the
temple was destroyed by approximately 25 Revolutionary Guard
members, led by local clerics who were accompanied by the head of
the religious endowments department in Shiraz (Nash 1982, 76). A
mosque was later build on this site (Dorraj et. al. 2008, 62).

By the mid-1980s, the Iranian Baha’i community was
“stripped of its collective assets, denied all legal recognition and thus
placed outside the protection of the law, and its individual members
were suffering [from] discrimination… the Government still
maintained that human rights of all groups were being respected in
Iran” (Dorraj et. al. 2008, 88). A decade later, the majority of Baha’i
“administrative centers, holy places, and cemeteries, if not destroyed,
remained confiscated by the state” (Sanasarian 2000, 121). In 1993,
Tehran’s municipal government destroyed a Baha’i cemetery in order
to build a cultural center on the site (Cole 2005, 142). Even the
uprooted gravestones and markers were sold (Cole 2005, 142).
Other general measures were also taken by the Islamic regime to
facilitate the destruction of the Iranian Baha’i community. Some of
the formally registered Baha’is were taken to mosques where they
were forced to convert to Islam; in some cases, the state abducted the
children of families who refused to convert, giving them to Muslim
families to raise (Cole 2005, 139). The regime sought to eradicate
Baha’is from all aspects of public and civil life within the state.
Baha’is were not allowed to have government positions, teaching
positions, formal education institutions within the Baha’i community,
and Baha’is were barred from the bureaucracy, universities, and

cemeteries (Cole 2005, 157). Steps against Baha’is in education were
taken immediately in the early days of the Revolution. Iran’s Minister
of Education at the time – Mohammad-Ali Rajai, appointed in
November of 1979 – dismissed all Baha’i teachers and ordered them
to repay in full the salaries they had previously received (Sanasarian
The Baha’i Threat to the Islamic Republic’s Regime

There are several reasons why the Baha’is, excluded entirely
from recognition and representation in the government, have been
constructed to be the “other” threatening the Islamic Republic and
its power structure. The concept of religious minorities as the
“other” threatening the new Iranian nation became institutionalized
with the rise of the Islamic regime (Cole 2005, 159). In othering the
Baha’i community, Baha’is were constructed by the Islamic Republic
as a monolithic whole and as an assimilationist group. The group’s
connection to Israel, where the Baha’i World Center is located, was
presented as a connection to implementation of colonial goals.
Baha’ism was constructed not as a religion, but rather as a political
entity created by anti-Islamic and colonial powers. Baha’is “formed
the most powerful wing of the [monarchical] ruling regime and were
responsible for violations of human rights” (Sansasian 2000, 121).
The fact that the group had been integrated at some level into
society, albeit highly discriminated against, fueled conspiracy theories
and paranoia, constructed as the internal enemy of Iran (Sanasarian
2000, 122-123).

Instead of viewing Baha’is as a recognized religious minority,
a label that would entail legal rights, the Islamic regime dismissed the
Baha’is as “perverted…instruments of Satan and followers of the
Devil and of the superpowers and their agents” (Cole 2005, 137). In
the aftermath of the Revolution, Khomeini stated that the Baha’is
were “a political faction; they are harmful; they will not be accepted”
(Nash 1982, 77). However, Baha’ism is strictly apolitical and the
religion does not allow its believers to participate in political
movements; these religious convictions did not even permit them to

vote in the national referendum to the Islamic Republic (Nash 1982,
80).

Given Khomeini’s view that there was no distinction between
religion and politics in Islam (Dorraj et. al. 2008, 510), it was easy to
characterize the apolitical Baha’i as a subversive political group
threatening Islam and the state. While nations are comprised of
religious and ethnic communities, “civic nations make a place for
them as constituents of the nation, whereas exclusionary nations
achieve their unity precisely by singling out the un-absorbable
minority within as a cultural and political fifth column” (Cole 2005,
159). In such a nation, as spoken of by former president Ayatollah
Mohammad Khatami, will be impossible “so long as thousands of
Iranians remain under the sentence of civic death” (Cole 2005, 159).

The works of Sultanhossein Tabandeh, a prominent Shi’a
author, published in the 1960s were incorporated into the Islamic
Republic’s legal structure and understanding of relations between
Muslims and non-Muslims. Tabandeh’s views also resulted in the
regime forbidding the following of religions deemed to be acting
against Islam, including communities under which the name of
religion is organized against Islam (Sanasarian 2000, 26). At the
request of Ayatollah Ali Khamenei and President Ali-Akbar Hashemi
Rafsanjani, the Supreme Revolutionary Cultural Council developed
government policy specifically formulated to confront and destroy
their cultural roots outside the country…[and the government must
block] their progress and development” (Sanasarian 2000, 121).
The Islamic regime also views Baha’ism as a challenge to its
legitimacy as an Islamic theocracy. Baha’is are the only non-Islamic
group to revere the Qur’an as a divinely revealed book and
Mohammad as a prophet (Nash 1982, 95), but the regime views
Baha’is as apostates because their religion was established after the
establishment of Islam and recognizes prophets born after
Mohammad. The real challenge to the Islamic Republic’s theocratic
legitimacy comes in the Baha’i critique of the role of clergy. As
previously discussed, Iran’s government structure and interpretation
of Shi’ism is heavily dominated by high-ranking clergy. However,
Baha’is challenge the role that clergy plays and call for each believer

to independently investigate truth – each Baha’i is called to compare
claims made by the Bab and Bahaullah to his or her own knowledge
and learning before accepting their claims as the truth (Dorraj et. al.
The Baha’i faith also rid itself of many of the particularistic
practices of Shi’ism, especially in regard to women’s rights and
polygamy (Cole 2005, 132). This approach to religious practice
places the role of interpreting religion with the individual believer,
thus eliminating the role of clergy in controlling and implementing
their own religious interpretations. In sharp contrast to the
hierarchical structure of the Shi’a clergy, the Baha’i governance
structure is more democratic, the role of the individual is emphasized,
and allocates equal rights to men and women (Dorraj et. al. 2008, 61).
In this sense, the Baha’i faith can be seen as similar to a religious
reform movement, but clearly threatening the legitimacy of the
Islamic Republic’s claims and its fundamental principle of velayat-e
faqih.

The Experiences of the Iranian Jews
As one of three recognized religious minorities, the Iranian Jewish
community’s experience in post-revolutionary Iran has been different
from that of the Baha’is. The Iranian Jewish community is extremely
old and deeply rooted within the Iranian cultural fabric, and is
believed to have existed in Iran for over 2,500 years. Modern Iran is
still home to the largest Jewish community in the Middle East, with
the exception of Israel (Dorraj et. al. 2008, 266). Prior to the Islamic
Revolution, there were an estimated 80,000 Jews in Iran, but within
one year after the Revolution, the estimate had already declined to
50,000 to 60,000 Iranian Jews (Price 2005, 315). Of the Jews leaving
Iran during and after the revolution, only 10,000 to 15,000 went to
Israel, the rest immigrating to Europe and the United States (Ram
2008, 95). Official censuses conducted by the Islamic Republic in
1986 and 1996 place the numbers of Iranian Jews at 26,354 and
12,737 respectively; outside estimates place the number closer to
35,000 (Price 2005, 315). In the summer of 2007, members of the
Iranian Jewish community in the Untied States offered $60,000 to

any Jewish family in Iran willing to immigrate to Israel, but by
December of 2007, only 40 Jews had accepted the offer (Dorraj et. al.
In contrast to the Baha’i experience, the Iranian Jewish community is
entitled to certain rights as established by the constitution.
Parliamentary representation is one of the most significant of these
rights. Of the 290 Majles representatives, one position is allocated
for Jewish representation, and the office is currently being served by
Maurice Mo’tamed. Iranian Jews are also allowed to (and do)
celebrate their own Jewish holidays, as well as Noruz, the Persian
New Year celebration that has its roots in ancient Iran and
Zoroastrianism (Price 2005, 316). Esther and Mordecai’s
mausoleum, a holy site in Hamadan, is also open for pilgrimages
(Price 2005, 316). Tehran alone has eleven functioning synagogues
(Dorraj et. al. 2008, 264).
Even as a recognized religious minority with constitutionally
protected rights, Jews in Iran still face discrimination and
persecution. With the May 9, 1979 execution of Habibullah
Elqanyan, a successful former Jewish community leader accused of
Zionist espionage and activities (Dorraj et. al. 2008, 261), the Iranian
Jewish community was legitimately concerned about their place
within the new Islamic state. On May 14, 1979, a delegation of
Jewish leaders approached Khomeini in Qom, where Khomeini
reassured them of their place. He stated that “We are against [the
Zionists] because they are not Jews, but politicians…but as for the
Jewish community and the rest of the [minority] communities in Iran
– they are members of this nation” (Dorraj et. al. 2008, 261).

While Khomeini’s statement was meant to ease the Iranian
Jewish community’s anxiety regarding the new direction of the
Iranian state, Iranian Jews are still persecuted and the distinction that
Khomeini made between Jews and Zionists has been lost. This
support by the government for the Jewish community has not lasted
beyond this single statement. Jews, as one of the three recognized
religious minorities, have their own religious courts for smaller
matters, but the system is supervised by the Islamic government and
requires state approval, thereby negating the independence of these

courts (Price 2005, 312). The government also undermines the
autonomy of Jewish religious schools. Jewish and synagogue schools
teach Hebrew, but government authorities strongly discourage
Hebrew texts, making it extremely difficult for the students to learn
the language (Price 2005, 316).
Iranian Jews also face discrimination in the economy. On December
24, 2000, Mo’tamed “lashed out at the widespread discrimination
against non-Muslims in Iran… [pointing to] discrimination in
academic education, in government recruitment and job
promotion… in criminal law, and restrictions on Hebrew
instruction” (Dorraj et. al. 2008, 264). The Iranian Jewish
community’s economic position was significantly diminished after the
Revolution, and fierce economic competition among bazaar
merchants was used to mistreat Iranian Jews (Sanasarian 2000, 113).
In the wake of the Revolution, the Islamic Republic’s
conceptualization of Israel changed, and Khomeini saw Israel as an
imperialist, anti-Muslim state. Jews that were perceived as having
deeper economic or personal connections to Israel were aggressively
persecuted by the new regime. In its early days, prominent
businessmen and leaders were executed for collaboration with the
“enemies of God: imperialism and Israel” (Price 2005, 316). During
the 1980s, substantially more Iranian Jews were imprisoned as
compared to any of the other recognized religious minorities
(Sanasarian 2000, 112).

The Iranian Jewish Challenge to the Islamic Republic
There are several different ways that the Islamic regime perceives
Jews to be a threat to its vision for the Iranian nation. The first is the
notion of kafir, a person who denies that Mohammad was God’s last
prophet, “doubting Muslims,” or those who do not fast (Sanasarian
2000, 85). Ayatollah Hossein-Ali Montazeri, one of the leading
figures in the Islamic Revolution and designated successor to
Khomeini before their 1989 falling-out, stated that the rules
determining purity and impurity “must be adhered to by the
followers of Islam, and the goal [was] to promote general hatred
toward those who are [impure and] outside Muslim circles’ in order

to prevent Muslims from succumbing to corrupt thoughts [of non-
Muslims]” (Sanasarian 2000, 85).

The establishment of Islam within Iran holds it superior to
other faiths. A person of another faith, deemed impure for their
disbelief by the regime, directly challenges the very premise upon
which the Islamic revolutionaries obtained power and continues to
govern the country by posing other religions and identity
constructions as alternatives. In this vein, the Iranian Jewish
community’s deep roots to a pre-Islamic Iran is a direct threat to the
legitimacy of the Islamic Regime’s power and construction of Iranian
national identity. Being labeled as impure is an attempt by the regime
to respond to threats to its legitimacy.

This idea of impurity was extended to severe segregation of
non-Muslims, despite the constitutional recognition of the Jewish
minority. This notion affected types of jobs one could hold; some
stores that sold food not prepared or sold by Muslims have to display
“especially for minorities” signs (Sanasarian 2000, 86). Even though
Ayatollah Seyyed Abol-Ghasem Mostafavi Kashani, speaker of
parliament during Mohammad Mossadegh’s premiership and a figure
idealized by Khomeini, ordered that all recognized religions are
eligible for employment, Majles representatives of the recognized
religious minorities continuously bring complaints of such
discrimination and advertisements that non-Muslims need not apply
for various jobs (Sanasarian 2000, 87). Although Montazeri made
some exceptions to such notions of impurity for Jews and Christians
in order for them to purify themselves, these rules were based upon
Shi’a religious interpretations and law, not that of the religious
minorities themselves (Sanasarian 2000, 85).

Ghettos for non-Muslim minorities have existed for years. In
cities such as Shiraz, Esfahan, and Yazd, Jewish ghettos are believed
to have existed since the 1600s (Vivier-Muresan 2007, 595). Within
these ghettos, synagogues, other places of worship, and schools were
of special social prestige (Vivier-Muresan 2007, 598). Under the
Pahlavis’ policies, there was greater integration of groups, and ghettos
and traditional religious quarters became synonymous with poverty
and backwardness (Vivier-Muresan 2007, 600). The ghettos became

a “symbol of dirt and disease” (Ram 2008, 86). With the affluent
members of the Jewish community rejecting the traditional council’s
authority (Vivier-Muresan 2007, 600), the religious community’s
authority was seen as backward. This denial of religious authority,
even within their own spiritual community, is implicitly a denial of
the Islamic Republic’s claims to religious authority and governance.

With the actual formation of the Islamic Republic, Khomeini
went beyond Montazeri’s exceptions, stating that “non-Muslims of
any religion or creed are najess (impure)” (Sanasarian 2000, 85). The
impurity of non-Muslims was taken seriously by the regime that
imposed new, stricter measures upon them. Iran’s non-Muslim
communities, especially the Jews with their deep connection to pre-
Islamic Iran and this conflicting vision of Iranian national identity,
threatened the Islamic Republic’s foundational beliefs and national
construction. Constructing the Jewish community as impure is a
blatant attempt to delegitimize criticism of the Islamic regime and
Iran’s establishment as a theocracy.

The regime’s suppression of Iranian Jews is based in
conflated understandings of Judaism and Zionism. The regime is
based upon a complete rejection of Western colonialism and the
Shah’s connections to the West and Israel. Although there are
distinctions in the law and occasionally in the regime’s rhetoric
between Zionism and Judaism, these distinctions are often blurred
(Dorraj et. al. 2008, 265). Ahmadinejad’s statements at the
Holocaust-denying conference in 2006 completely negated previously
held distinctions. The result of Ahmadinejad’s insulting statements is
that it places Iranian Jews, an integral part of Iran for thousands of
years, as one of the primary enemies of the Islamic Republic. Jews
still face charges of treason and conspiracy (Price 2005, 316), with
perhaps the most notable incidents being the hanging of two
individuals in 1997 on charges of spying for Israel and the United
States and the arrests of 13 Iranian Jews from Shiraz and Esfahan on
the eve of Passover in 1999 (Alfon et. al. 1999). The 13 arrested were
convicted on charges of spying for Israel in July of 2000, but all were
released by February of 2003. Despite their release, the arrests

“planted fear in the heart of the Jewish community, bringing its
loyalty under question” (Dorraj et. al. 2008, 264).

The regime’s confusion of Judaism and Zionism incorrectly
assumes that Zionism is a goal shared by all Jews, national and
religious, preventing the regime from understanding that “identities
are not at all uniform and homogeneous, and that Iranian Jews could
very well be both Jewish and Iranian without necessarily ascribing to
Zionism” (Ram 2008, 96). However, Ahmadinejad’s statements
regarding the Holocaust have resulted in his re-writing “the Iranian
stance not only on Zionism and the Holocaust but on the right of
Jews to a natural presence in the Middle East” (Naji 2008, 157). In
fact, the large number of Iranian Jews (relative to other Muslim,
Middle Eastern countries) demonstrates the “non- (and oftentimes
even their anti-) Zionist credentials” (Ram 2008, 97). Such
statements by Ahmadinejad and his 2006 conference focused on
Holocaust-denial insult and intimidate the Iranian Jewish community
(Naji 2008, 157). Iranian Jewish community leader Haroun
Yashayaie’s letter stating that Ahmadinejad’s comments have spread
fear and panic in the Iranian Jewish community marked the first time
since 1979 where the Jewish community has spoken out in
opposition to the government (Naji 2008, 158). Jewish Majles
representative Maurice Mo’tamed sharply criticized Ahmadinejad for
the conference, calling it an insult to all Jews and a denial of their
history (Naji 2008, 166). He also criticized anti-Israeli state television
broadcasts for fueling anti-Jewish sentiments and leading to an
increase in emigration (Naji 2008, 159).

Conclusion

Despite Iran’s rich ethnic and religious diversity, the
establishment of the Islamic Republic in 1979 has created an
environment where religious minorities, the Jewish and Baha’i
communities in particular, are viewed by the state as a threat to
Iranian national identity. The Iranian constitution directly establishes
its interpretation of Shi’a Islam as the primary identity of the Iranian
nation and uses the founders’ understandings of Islamic theology to
justify the clergy’s powerful roles within the Iranian government.

The pre-Islamic and secular history of Iran is not valued in the
regime’s new interpretation of and vision for the Iranian nation. This
places Iran’s non-Muslim minorities, especially its Baha’is and Jews,
outside of this new national construction and significantly diminishes
their rights within modern Iranian society. These groups in particular
are seen to be internal enemies that threaten the legitimacy of the
Islamic Republic’s foundation and its vision for Iranian national
identity.

Baha’is, with their anti-clerical structure and their belief in
prophets following Mohammad challenge the principles of the
Islamic regime. Iranian Jews with their roots to pre-Islamic Iran
challenge the legitimacy of constructing Iran as solely an Islamic
republic. While Jews are one of three recognized religious minorities,
the extensive discrimination that they face within Iranian society
significantly constrains their rights. The concept of apostasy and
impurity are used by the regime to delegitimize these groups’
criticisms of its harsh policies and rhetoric, and members of these
groups are persecuted as subversive political actors and Zionists.

Iranian Jews and Baha’is are thus seen to be significant
threats this vision, as expressed through their own histories, beliefs,
and connections to states the regime deems to be its primary
enemies, namely Israel. This rendering as the “other,” the threat to
the very principles by which Iran’s modern Islamic identity is
envisioned by the state, has resulted in harsh discriminatory policies
by the state that continue to negatively affect the lives of Iranian
minority religious groups and reveals the inadequacy of the state to
protect the rights of its religious minorities.
