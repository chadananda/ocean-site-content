> **Abstract:** The author analyzes three dynamics conducive from the mysticism of nascent religions, involving the whole community of believers, to the mysticism of periods of spiritual decline, involving only elites of believers, estranged from organized religion. These dynamics are related to the cyclicity of the historical processes of religions, to the limitations of human imperfection, and to the relativity of revelation. The mystics of the past perceived the widespread estrangement from the spiritual reality of religion caused by these dynamics and drew away from organized religion, seeking solace in their inner experiences of the Divine. Today humankind is mature. We cannot fully understand the implications of its maturity for the development of the Bahá'í religious world. We can only venture some hypothesis. It seems unlikely that the Bahá'í religious world will not have its winter. But the infallibility of the Universal House of Justice, granted for the whole course of the Dispensation, should imply a different kind of winter. A mysticism of religious decline may develop, and yet those future mystics could find solace and reassurance in an infallible Head of the Cause. Also human imperfection will remain, even in the presence of people who may arise to the station of the lesser prophets of the "House of Israel."  
>   
> However, the Bahá'í Revelation, the revelation of the maturity of humankind, is free from certain flaws that in the past implied an early development of spiritually unacceptable behaviors, such as dogmatism, ritualism, externalism, exclusivism. The power of the Bahá'í Covenant, the proscriptions of ancient "ordinances as holy war, destruction of books, the ban on association and companionship with other peoples or on reading certain books," the authoritative exposition of a divine philosophy by 'Abdu'l-Bahá and of an institutional and societal policy by Shoghi Effendi, are new features in the history of religion. These features seemingly discourage any dichotomy between the mystical and the institutional aspects of religion, responsible of dogmatism, ritualism, and externalism, and rule out any exclusivist attitude. Moreover, the early spiritual education prescribed by the Bahá'í teachings should enable human beings to start their mystical journey at higher and higher spiritual levels and to ascribe a greater importance to the mystical stage of the return journey to the world, at the service of humankind. The mystics of the new era may thus more easily avoid a number of past mistakes: the refusal of any mediator between God and them; the advancement of heretical doctrines; a leaning towards an unduly speculative mentality and aristocratic and initiatory attitudes; an over-evaluation of mystical experience and of the so called charismatic gifts; the refusal of living in this world. They may thus concentrate on the core of mysticism, that is, to realize a state of communion between themselves and the Soul of the Manifestation of God that conveys the Spirit of God unto them bringing "such ecstasy of joy that life becomes nothing."

   “T h e n ewly b o r n ba b e of th at Day”
M ys ticism in th e Age of th e M a t urity of
Human kin d

Julio Savi

One of the sundry classifications of mysticism suggested by
Western scholars describes a mysticism of nascent religions, and a
mysticism of periods of spiritual decline.1 The former is
characterized by “an emotion which no one could escape,” in a time
when “all were so deeply concerned with religion that we should say:
all were mystic” (Sudbrack 13). The latter is born from “the awareness
that beliefs have lost their meanings” (Beaude 37) and from the
resulting “intense tension between faith in the Ineffable and the
instruments offered by religion” (Beaude 98). In both cases mysticism
seemingly characterizes souls endowed with a greater capacity to
receive spiritual influences than others. In the former case, mystics
are the first to perceive the earliest signs of the new spiritual
springtime; in the latter case, they suffer more than the others
because of the deadening harshness of the spiritual winter.

The transition from the former form of mysticism, widely shared
by the whole religious community, which is the first outward fruit
of the teachings of each Manifestation of God, to the second one,
an elite that is often viewed as a “denial of the religious component”
(Beaude 102) of spirituality, seemingly depends on a gradual
departure of religious communities from the spirit of the original
teachings that has characterized in various degrees and in different
ages the history of all great religions. This departure appears to cause
the souls endowed with greater spiritual capacities to become
isolated. The most evident reasons of this departure and isolation are
four: the intrinsic human imperfection, the progressive maturation
of humankind, the relativity of Revelation, and the cyclicity of the
spiritual evolution of humankind.

The intrinsic human imperfec tion

‘Abdu’l-Bahá writes that “self-love is kneaded into the very clay
of man” (SDC 96). Therefore man “can flutter along for some short
distance, into the endless vast; but he can never soar upward to the
Sun in the high heavens” (SWAB 47). This imperfection implies that
human beings may apprehend God’s “purpose only to the extent of
their station and spiritual capacity” (GWB 77). This limited

202          Mysticism in the age of the maturity

understanding, in its turn, leads, in the course of time, to an
unavoidable gap between Religion in its spiritual or metaphysical
essence, and religion in its historical or physical manifestation, that
is, what human beings did with the original message of that
Religion. Being endowed with a greater capacity for understanding
the spiritual reality of religion than others, mystics cannot adapt
themselves to the flaws of the historical reality of religion, during
those times when those flaws are fundamental.
The progressive maturation of huma nkind

Humankind as a whole is often compared by ‘Abdu’l-Bahá to an
individual human being, who goes through different ages, from
“protoplasm” (PUP 359) to adulthood (SWAB 285). These words
seemingly imply that, although humankind is intrinsically imperfect,
still it is going through an ongoing perfecting process.2 Therefore,
since “human beings are, by their very nature, different one from
the other,” and their diversity is due to both “differences of degree
which are innate” (CC 1:258) and capacities that have been developed
through personal efforts, in a period of spiritual decline a mystic,
who has greater spiritual capacities than most of her fellow persons,
may be projected towards spiritual goals that seem incomprehensible
to her contemporaries.
The relativity of Revelation

Although the Manifestation of God is omniscient, yet He reveals
a body of teachings adequate to the maturity of those human beings
he has come to educate. But since Revelation is relative, in the
course of time the revealed teachings that are specifically related to
contingent circumstances of time and place become obsolete,
because in the meantime humankind has developed. And thus those
teachings do not satisfy the mystics, endowed as they are with
greater spiritual capacities than the others. For these reasons, in a
period of spiritual decline, when the teachings of the Manifestation
of God have already given their fruits, a mystic may be endowed
with spiritual capacities that project him towards spiritual goals
which his organized religion cannot even conceive.
The cyclicity of the spiritual evolution of humankind
‘Abdu’l-Bahá explains:

> In this material world time has cycles; places change
> through alternating seasons ...At one time it is the season of
> spring; at another it is the season of autumn; and again it is
> the season of summer or the season of winter ... It is the same
> with the spiritual cycles of the Prophets . . . they are always
revolving and being renewed. (SAQ73, 74, 76; cf. PUP 94-5)

Lights of ‘Irfán Book Seven         203

Each spiritual springtime has therefore its winter. Bahá’u’lláh
seemingly describes this spiritual winter as a time of “oppression.”
He writes: “ What ‘oppression’ is more grievous than that a soul
seeking the truth, and wishing to attain unto the knowledge of God,
should know not where to go for it and from whom to seek it?” (KI
31) Joseph Beaude, a researcher at the French CNRS (Centre
National de la Recherche Scientifique) who specialized in studies of
the 16th and 17th centuries, describes the experiences of the
European mystics of the 16th and 17th centuries, which he considers
a time of “neglect by the Christian institution” (93), as “experiences
of upset and dispossessed souls, tried by an absence, that is, the loss
of what in former days has been seen as the foundation of all
certitudes” (92), souls that “regard exile as their country, and
endeavor to translate their language of exiled peoples into the
language of the surrender to the Other” (93). He writes that they
“speak the language of the night,” which they “draw and accept
from the cultural and religious conditions of their world” (98).

Features of the ancie nt Dispensations

If we keep in mind these considerations, we may more easily
understand a number of historical facts of the ancient
Dispensations. First, none of the ancient Manifestations clearly
conferred the infallibility to a successor and an interpreter, to whom
the community of believers would be expected to turn. ‘Abdu’l-
Bahá says that in the past

> many of the holy beings who were not dawning-points of
> the Most Great Infallibility, were yet kept and preserved
> from error under the shadow of the protection and
> guardianship of God, for they were the mediators of grace
> between God and men. If God did not protect them from
> error, their error would cause believing souls to fall into
> error, and thus the foundation of the Religion of God
> would be overturned, which would not be fitting nor
> worthy of God. (SAQ 172)
But the “acquired” or “conferred” (SAQ 173, 174) infallibility of
those “holy beings” was not openly proclaimed by the Manifestation
of God in front of everyone. This fact was conducive to early
divisions within the ancient religions and thus to a departure from
the spirit of the original teachings. Shoghi Effendi said, as to the
succession in Christianity:

> The real reason why Christ did not make some explicit
> statement regarding His succession is not known, and
cannot be known . . . The utmost we can do is to give some

204         Mysticism in the age of the maturity

> explanations, but these must necessarily fail to give the
> fundamental reason to the problem we seek to solve.”3

Therefore, we can only hypothesize that one of the reasons of this
uncertainty as to the succession in the ancient Dispensations is the
characteristics of those remote ages, and that this fact may have
something to do with the concept of the relativity of Revelation.

Second, the ancient Manifestations of God have revealed
teachings that a posteriori seem to deny a concept explained by
‘Abdu’l-Bahá, that is, that “every universal cause is divine and every
particular one is temporal,” and thus the teachings of the
Manifestations of God are always “all-universal and all-inclusive”
and “in the service of universal education” (SWAB 68-9). For
example, the position of women has always been, although partially,
subordinated to that of men. For another example, a relentless fight
against idolaters has been prescribed, especially in the two primary
monotheisms, that is, Judaism and Islam. In the light of the concept
of progressive Revelation, the prescriptions that today seem a
discrimination against women may have been in reality a protection
of their lesser physical strength in front of men, in a society
ruthlessly ruled by the struggle for existence. And the unrelenting
fight against idolaters may be justified by the need to inculcate the
concept of monotheism, in a world in which this idea was not yet
part of a shared cultural legacy.

The progressive maturation of humankind is thus conducive to
an increasing gap between the spiritual potentialities of human
beings and the social teachings of the Manifestations of God.
Moreover the exploitation of the religious message by people
subjected to the dictates of their lower selves, in the absence of a
centre of authority clearly appointed by the Manifestation of God, is
conducive to a chasm between the spiritual understanding of the
teachings of the Manifestations of God by people endowed with
greater spiritual capacities, like the mystics, and the understanding
shared by the majority of people. Therefore the mystics of the
periods of spiritual decline become estranged from the human,
outward aspect of religion and turn towards its spiritual, inward
aspect.

The mystics of the times of spiritual decline manifest this
estrangement from the masses in several ways. In their relation with
the Manifestation of God, they prefer his union with God, rather
then his relations with human beings. Moreover, since the mystics
perceive the flaws of organized religion, they are inclined to
dispense with its function as an intermediary. Therefore, as Beaude
puts it, on the one hand mysticism has been viewed as a “denial of
the religious component” and of its claim to bestow “the means

Lights of ‘Irfán Book Seven         205

whereby one may be ‘reconnected with’” (102) God, and on the other,
“the harshest blame put on the mystics came from the devoted” (100).

Prevented from expressing themselves freely in a world,
dominated by ideas they do not approve and critical against them,
mystics take refuge in the secret of their hearts. Thus they adopt
initiatory and occult attitudes, to protect themselves from the
official religion, usually entrenched in exclusivist and absolutist
positions. Mystics also devote themselves to the quest for impossible
inner experiences, and unlikely descriptions, of transcendence, in the
hope to find there a comfort for their loneliness and a balm for the
bitterness of their spiritually oppressed souls. This is the origin of
certain mystic theologies, sometimes conflicting with the official
ones, and of the search after a consolatory ecstatic union, in times
when very few outer traces of the presence of God can be detected
in the religious community.

Mysticism in the history of the Ba há’í Faith

As to the history of the Bahá’í Faith, the mysticism of nascent
religions can be easily identified in the narratives of its early days.
Shoghi Effendi said that “the true mysticism, and the secret, inner
meaning of life which humanity has at present, drifted so far from”
may be found in the communion with “the Souls of the
Manifestations,” achieved by the martyrs, that “brought them such
ecstasy of joy that life became nothing.”4 And the Bahá’í
martyrology is particularly rich and documented, and it is not yet
concluded. Mystical episodes are referred in God Passes By (cf. 152-5)
and in the Dawn-Breakers. The ongoing persecutions against the
Bahá’ís in Iran and the recent martyrdoms in that country, as well as
the numberless episodes of sacrifice and selflessness characterizing
Bahá’í service throughout the world, confirm that nascent mysticism
is still alive in the Bahá’í community.

If we want to attain a better understanding of the present and
future developments of Bahá’í mysticism, it may be useful trying to
hypothesize which are the implications of the above mentioned
concepts for those developments. And thus we should remember
some of the fundamental differences between the Bahá’í and the
past dispensations. Whereas the ancient Manifestations appeared in
archaic epochs, Bahá’u’lláh has been defined as “the Prophet of
civilization” (Martin). Whereas the ancient Manifestations addressed
a humankind in its “long ages of infancy and childhood” (WOB 202),
Bahá’u’lláh announces “the coming of age of the human race” (WOB
206) and addresses a humankind in “the most turbulent stage of its
evolution, the stage of adolescence, when the impetuosity of youth
and its vehemence reach their climax, and must gradually be

206          Mysticism in the age of the maturity

superseded by the calmness, the wisdom, and the maturity that
characterize the stage of manhood” (WOB 202).We cannot yet fully
understand what this incipient maturity implies for the development
of the Bahá’í civilization, and thus of its mysticism. We can only
suggest a few hypotheses.

The intrinsic human imperfection will certainly persist, because
“Peter cannot become Christ” (SAQ 231). But undoubtedly, since
humankind’s perfecting process will continue, the level of
perfection accessible to human beings in the new Era will be higher
and higher. In this vein, Bahá’u’lláh wrote: “The station which he
who hath truly recognized this Revelation will attain is the same as
the one ordained for such prophets of the house of Israel as are not
regarded as Manifestations ‘endowed with constancy’ ” (WOB 111).
And the Báb said: “The newly born babe of that Day excels the
wisest and most venerable men of this time, and the lowliest and
most unlearned of that period shall surpass in understanding the
most erudite and accomplished divines of this age” (DB 93).

Progressive revelation and the cycles of humankind’s spiritual
evolution imply that the Bahá’í Faith will also have its winter. To
presume that the Bahá’í world will not experience any decline is
seemingly tantamount to stating that the Bahá’í Faith is also perfect
for a future humankind. This statement seems to be in conflict with
the concepts of the ongoing perfecting process of humankind and
of the relativity of Revelation taught by the Bahá’í Faith.
Bahá’u’lláh may allude to this concept when He writes that the
“‘oppression’” of spiritual winter is “the essential feature of every
Revelation. Unless it cometh to pass, the Sun of Truth will not be
made manifest. For the break of the morn of divine guidance must
needs follow the darkness of the night of error” (KI 31). Happily this
feature of each Revelation is our concern only because we want to
attain a better understanding of the great present opportunities,
because the Bahá’í winter seems to be still very far off. Of the
Manifestation that will come after Him, Bahá’u’lláh writes: “I am
not apprehensive for My own self . .. My fears are for Him Who will
be sent down unto you after Me” (WOB 117).5 That is, He seemingly
foresees that the Manifestation who will come after Him will be
persecuted by humankind, like those who came before Him. But the
Universal House of Justice has been ordained by God “as the source
of all good and freed from all error” (WT 14), as a fulfillment of the
promise of “the Day which shall not be followed by night” (SLH 34),
and thus described as “a continuing centre of divine guidance in the
world.”6 In the opinion of the writer, these words imply that the
Universal House of Justice will be infallible in the guidance of the
Bahá’í community for the entire course of the Bahá’í dispensation,
and deny the hypothesis that it will loose its “infallibility” as soon as

Lights of ‘Irfán Book Seven         207

the next Manifestation exists on earth, otherwise its “Day” would
indeed be followed by “night.” Then who will persecute the future
Manifestation? The hypothesis may be suggested that the Universal
House of Justice will recognize and accept the next Manifestation.
This hypothesis is seemingly supported by the following statement
by the Supreme Body itself in its Constitution:

> The provenance, the authority, the duties, the sphere of
> action of the Universal House of Justice all derive from
> the revealed Word of Bahá’u’lláh which, together with the
> interpretations and expositions of the Centre of the
> Covenant and of the Guardian of the Cause . . . constitute
> the binding terms of reference of the Universal House of
> Justice and are its bedrock foundation. The authority of
> these Texts is absolute and immutable until such time as
> Almighty God shall reveal His new Manifestation to
> Whom will belong all authority and power. (CUHJ 4)
And thus the mystics of the Bahá’í winter will seemingly always find
a comfort for their loneliness and a balm for the bitterness of their
spiritually oppressed souls in their Supreme Body, that in that far off
“Day of Judgment” will commit them into the hands of the new
Manifestation, together with their own spiritual mandate. And, the
persecutions against that future Manifestation — and almost
certainly against the mystics who will follow it — will be perpetrated
by an unspiritual society that will disregard the guidance of the
infallible Universal House of Justice. As to us today, whatever may
be the conditions of society at large, or the level of maturity of our
specific Bahá’í communities, we still have the great privilege of
living in days of full springtime, when the Sun of Truth shines in its
full splendor and the whole community does its best to follow the
Centre of the Covenant infallibly guiding it towards that Sun. All
that is required is the spiritual capacity to perceive the great
opportunities of the present day.

The Bahá’í Revelation “vouchsafed unto men in direct
proportion to their spiritual capacity” (GWB 87), which is today the
capacity of an incipient maturity, is free from many of the flaws
that in the past religions implied an early departure from the reality
of religion and the development of spiritually unacceptable outward
attitudes, like dogmatism, ritualism, exclusivism and, most of all,
sectarianism. In particular, the authenticity of the Covenant
regarding the succession and the interpretation of Scripture; the
proscription of “such ordinances as holy war, destruction of books,
the ban on association and companionship with other peoples or on
reading certain books,” which in the ancient religions “had been laid
down and affirmed according to the exigencies of the time” (TB 28);
the fact that “Bahá’u’lláh has reduced all ritual and form to an

208          Mysticism in the age of the maturity

absolute minimum in His Faith,”7 and the concept that “rigidity and
rituals should be strictly avoided”;8 ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s authoritative
interpretations of the spiritual topics of divine philosophy; Shoghi
Effendi’s authoritative interpretations of institutional and
“political” issues; and last but not least the “clear distinction ...drawn
in the Bahá’í Writings between authoritative interpretation and the
understanding that each individual arrives at from a study of its
Teachings” (KA note #130) — all these features of the Bahá’í
Revelation are brand new in the history of religion. The power of
the Covenant and the warnings against rituals exclude any
dichotomy between mystical and institutional aspects of religion,
typical of dogmatism and ritualism. The proscription of the above
mentioned ancient ordinances and the proclamation of the oneness
of humankind imply that any feeling of superiority or hostility
against any sector of the human family, typical of exclusivism, is de-
legitimized. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s and Shoghi Effendi’s authoritative
interpretations of theological and institutional issues, a perennial
guidance for present and future students and scholars, as well as the
distinction between authoritative and personal interpretations,
exclude any possibility of sectarianism.

These aspects of the Bahá’í Revelation were mentioned only to
gain a clearer understanding of the present opportunities for
individual mystical seekers, who may feel free and assured, because
they are protected from some of the traps into which past mystics
fell, provided they abide by the revealed teachings.

The refusal of any mediator betwee n G od and
themselves

A number of mystics refused, and refuse, any mediator between
God and themselves, not even the Manifestation of God. The Bahá’í
position on this issue is very clear. Bahá’u’lláh unambiguously
explains that “the door of the knowledge of the Ancient of Days” is
“closed in the face of all beings” (KI 99), and that “by ‘attainment
unto the divine Presence’ is meant attainment unto the presence of
His Beauty in the person of His Manifestation” (KI 169). However,
when Bahá’u’lláh abolished the institution of the clergy, He
excluded any intermediary between God and human beings beside
the Manifestation of God and the Centre of the Covenant. It is not
a surprise, then, that Bahá’u’lláh writes: “whereas in days past every
lover besought and searched after his Beloved, it is the Beloved
Himself Who now is calling His lovers and is inviting them to attain
His presence.” In this Day “the anguish of . . . separation from Him”
that afflicted past mystics during periods of decline may be turned
“into the joy of an everlasting reunion” and “the bitterness of . . .
remoteness from His court” may be dissolved by “the sweetness of

Lights of ‘Irfán Book Seven          209

His presence” (GWB 319). And there is other good news. The
Manifestation of God has clearly conferred the infallibility to the
Centre of his Covenant and the line is indisputably uninterrupted,
albeit in different forms, through ‘Abdul-Bahá and Shoghi Effendi,
as well as through the Universal House of Justice. The Pole towards
which human being should orientate their practical efforts is not a
hidden pole, as it was the case, for example, with the Muslim
mystics, who were thus brought to search for an inward, occult,
relation with their Pole. Shoghi Effendi may have pointed out the
importance of the physical presence on the earth of the Centre of
the Covenant, when he made clear to a believer

> that it is best to assume that generally speaking when
> people claim they are receiving              messages or
> communications from the Master or Bahá’u’lláh, etc., it is
> a psychic experience or their imagination, and that they are
> not in real contact with them. These Holy Beings have the
> channels of the Cause through which to guide us. They do
> not need to go outside these and send individual
> revelations;9
or when he informed the Bahá’ís that

> he never secretly, or inwardly, communicates his
> instructions to any believer . . . about the affairs of the
> Cause; his instrument in these matters is the N.S.A.
> [National Spiritual Assembly, the governing body of Bahá’í
> national communities] . . . any one who thinks that he is
> being directed by him in the inner plane is just deluding
> himself and others ...he answers ...[the believers] in writing,
> not psychically, whenever he wishes to do so.10
The issue becomes more difficult when, beside the Guardian and
the Universal House of Justice, that were incontrovertibly endowed
with the gift of the infallibility, other Institutions of the Bahá’í
Administrative Order that were not endowed with that gift, and that
are squarely recognized as imperfect and capable of becoming more
perfect, are mentioned. Shoghi Effendi said that the Bahá’í World
Order is “still embryonic, and as yet improperly understood”11 and
that “its institutions are not yet functioning perfectly.”12 However,
he underlined the great importance of upholding “the principle of
authority invested in our elected bodies.”13 In this case, the
imperfect yet perfectible Institutions are not to be obeyed as if they
were mediators between God and oneself. Only the Manifestation
and the Centre of the Covenant are mediators between God and the
believers. The Bahá’ís are called to abide by the teaching that the
unity of the community is more important than any other
consideration. This teaching was emphasized by Bahá’u’lláh himself

when he said to two groups, arguing about His station, as mentioned
by Shoghi Effendi, “that if they were united both sides were right
and if they were divided both were wrong.”14 The same teaching was
emphasized by ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, when He wrote:

> If they agree upon a subject, even though it be wrong, it is
> better than to disagree and be in the right, for this
> difference will produce the demolition of the divine
> foundation. Though one of the parties may be in the right
> and they disagree that will be the cause of a thousand
> wrongs, but if they agree and both parties are in the wrong,
> as it is in unity the truth will be revealed and the wrong
> made right. (BWF 411)
> The Bahá’ís are required “to master and follow the principles of
their divinely laid down Administrative Order.”15 This attitude is
strictly connected with a typical Bahá’í teaching: that the believers
“should endeavor to learn about Bahá’í laws and principles and
should, as a matter of conscience, endeavor to practice these to the
best of their ability.”16 The “Prophet of civilization” expects his
followers to have a high sense of their personal responsibility, a
sense of responsibility that is part of Bahá’í mysticism.

Heretical doctrines

The vigilance over the purity of the doctrine exercised by the
clergy, lest heresy should arise, in the past Dispensations may be
compared to the vigilance exercised by the Bahá’í Institutions lest
Covenant-breakers should impair the unity of the community. But
whereas in the past many heresies could flourish, today Covenant-
breakers have little hope to survive for very long, as history has
demonstrated. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá ascribes this fact to “the most great
characteristic of the revelation of Bahá’u’lláh, a specific teaching
not given by any of the Prophets of the past . . . [that is] the
ordination and appointment of the Center of the Covenant,” which
safeguards and protects “the religion of God against differences and
schisms, making it impossible for anyone to create a new sect or
faction of belief” (PUP 455-6). Moreover, the teaching that human
understanding of the teachings of the Manifestation of God is
relative denies an undue importance to be ascribed to any
interpretation suggested by any human being, as esteemed and
honored he may be. In the synthetic words of the Universal House
of Justice: “Unity of doctrine is maintained by the existence of the
authentic texts of Scripture and the voluminous interpretations of
‘Abdu’l-Bahá and Shoghi Effendi, together with the absolute
prohibition against anyone propounding ‘authoritative’ or ‘inspired’
interpretations or usurping the function of Guardian” (MUHJ63 56).

If we add the prohibition of monasticism, with its specific rules, we
may come to the conclusion that the emergence of rigid mystical
schools, with their more or less unorthodox doctrines and specific
rituals, similar to those who appeared in the past, is quite unlikely in
a Bahá’í context.

A distinction betwee n the kernel a nd the shell

Muslim mystics distinguished between the kernel and the shell of
religion, that is, between the outer aspects, related to the laws, and
the inner aspects, related to non ritual prayer, meditation and
contemplation. The concept whereby the inward aspects of religion
are superior to its outward aspects is present also in the Christian
world, as it is evident in the Pauline theology’s criticism against the
law. Bahá’u’lláh clarifies the importance of the law not only in the
Seven Valleys, when He states that the Law “is indeed the secret of
the ‘Path’ and the fruit of the Tree of ‘Truth’ ” (SV 40), but also in
the first paragraph of the Kitáb-i-Aqdas, where He states that the
duties of recognizing the Manifestation of God and observing His
ordinances are “inseparable,” and that “neither is acceptable without
the other” (SV 19). The mystical path recommended by Bahá’u’lláh
consists thus in obeying the law for the love of God and using the
law as an instrument of inner purification, spiritual upliftment and
nearness to God, that is, as the main instrument for advancing on
the spiritual path. The seeker becomes purified through the grace of
God attracted by the efforts exerted to comply with the outward
law. Purification implies the development of spiritual capacities of
whose development the seeker may be wholly unaware (cf. GWB 295).
The development of spiritual capacities leads the seeker to draw
nearer to God, as ‘Abdu’l-Bahá explained: “nearness is likeness” (PUP
148). It is unlikely that future mystics may undervalue the
importance of abiding by the laws. They will certainly do their best
to keep alive the spirit of the obedience to the law, that is, for the
love of God, so that any externalism may be avoided.

Unduly speculative flights while attempting to
understand meta physical issues

In the past the mystics of periods of spiritual decline produced
complicated, sometimes fanciful and unclear, theologies and
cosmologies, perhaps because their human imperfection and the
ineffability of the experiences which inspired them were not
sufficiently assisted by the words of the Revelation, conceived as
they were for an infant humankind. Bahá’u’lláh warn us to avoid
those kinds of speculations, when He recommends to study those
sciences that “can profit the peoples of the earth” and to keep away

from “those which begin with words and end with words” (TB 51-2).
And Shoghi Effendi explains that the “fruitless sciences” mentioned
by Bahá’u’lláh are “metaphysical hair-splittings, and other abstract
things carried to the extreme,”17 as well as those “those theological
treatises and commentaries that encumber the human mind rather
than help it to attain the truth.”18 Moreover, the contemplation of
the themes of transcendence were often viewed as the apex of
mysticism, whereas Bahá’u’lláh writes: “The conceptions of the
devoutest of mystics, the attainments of the most accomplished
amongst men, the highest praise which human tongue or pen can
render are all the product of man’s finite mind and are conditioned
by its limitations” (GWB 62). And yet He exhorted over and over His
followers to meditate on Scripture, revealed a number of deep
meditations on the topics of the ancient mysticism — as for example
Prayers and Meditations, nos. 38 and 178 — and revealed Tablets on
those topics, as for example the “Law˙-i-Kullu Ta‘am.” ‘Abdu’l-
Bahá advised spiritual seekers to study metaphysical questions, and
suggested a list of the important ones that should be studied.19 He
also said: “You cannot apply the name ‘man’ to any being void of
this faculty of meditation; without it he would be a mere animal,
lower than the beasts” (PT 54.10). He Himself wrote several Tablets
explaining metaphysical matters, as for example His “Commentary
on the Tradition: “I Was a Hidden Treasure (Tafsír-i-Kuntu Kanzan
Makhfíyyan),” His “Commentary on the Qur’ánic Verses
Concerning the Overthrow of the Byzantines” (cf. Momen), or His
“Tablet of the Universe (Law˙-i-Aflakiyyih).”

Apparently the Bahá’ís are not discouraged to study and meditate
on metaphysical problems in themselves. They are discouraged to do
it adopting the methods and the aims of the ancient mystics. And
the Bahá’í Writings suggest new methods and different aims: the
Faith of civilization differs from past religions in this respect as
well. In the theoretical perspective, Bahá’í Scripture encourages the
seekers to pursue the mystical path. But the “steed” and the goal of
the mystical journey, that is annihilation in God, is service, described
as the highest way of life on earth: gradually overcoming the
limitations of the self through one’s submission to His law for the
love of God. And His law prescribes that the collective wellbeing of
humankind should be promoted. Therefore Bahá’í mystics are active
Bahá’ís, who “love all the world ...love humanity and try to serve it ...
work for universal peace and universal brotherhood.”20 In a practical
perspective, the Writings of Bahá’u’lláh on these issues and the
authoritative interpretations by ‘Abdu’l-Bahá offer a method and an
orientation that are precious for the lovers of this kind of study.
And it seems that more and more Bahá’ís will devote themselves to
this kind of study and activity as time goes by. Last but not least, the
explanations of institutional and “political” issues by Shoghi Effendi

and the infallible guidance of the Universal House of Justice seem a
sufficient guarantee against the useless verbosity and
inconclusiveness of the past.

Aristocratic and initiatory attitudes

Mystical quest has always been an elite, aristocratic activity. The
reasons of this fact seem to be fundamentally two. On the one hand,
in the past, because of the inferior collective maturity of
humankind, only a few had the capacity to follow the difficult path
of the mystical quest, so much so in its theological and philosophical
aspects. On the other, the elitist selection of the mystics was favored
by the initiatory methods they were obliged to adopt, if the secrecy
of the results of their quest had to be preserved in their dangerous
religio-social milieu — a milieu in which the physical absence of a
spiritual Centre clearly appointed by the Manifestation and the
power seized by individuals who were more interested in power itself
than in the spiritual guidance of the community implied a blind
conformism, that was in conflict with the aspirations of the mystics.
It is unlikely that these conditions may ever prevail in the new
Dispensation. Bahá’u’lláh proclaims: “The mystic and wondrous
Bride, hidden ere this beneath the veiling of utterance, hath now, by
the grace of God and His divine favor, been made manifest even as
the resplendent light shed by the beauty of the Beloved” (HW 51-2).

These words by Bahá’u’lláh imply at least three important facts:
first, all people “that are in heaven and on earth” have received the
“divine favor”; second, the interpretive key of the mystical language
used by the ancient Manifestations has been revealed by the Prophet
of civilization, in such precious books and Tablets as the Kitáb-i-
ˆqán; and third, the new religious Institutions have such a clear
divinely-revealed foundation, that there cannot be doubt as to their
legitimate authority to guide the human “endeavors in the path of
detachment.” The Administrative Order of the new Dispensation,
with its perfect fusion of the best aspects of the three forms of
government described by Aristotle as well as of theocracy, “cannot
ever degenerate into any form of despotism, of oligarchy, or of
demagogy which must sooner or later corrupt the machinery of all
man-made and essentially defective political institutions” (WOB 154).
The mystical path is opened in front of all human beings and its
Pole, the Centre of the Covenant, will remain visible and intact for
the whole course of the Dispensation. Obviously this does not mean
that all Bahá’ís will achieve the same level of spirituality. In this
vein, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá has reportedly said: “even in this great cycle it is
not possible for all to attain the highest” (ADP 55).

The search for mystical experiences

Many experts have described mysticism in terms of mystical
experience, an experience that, by definition, “defies expression,”
because “no adequate report of its contents can be given in words”
(James 367). Shoghi Effendi has given a new meaning and value to
these so called mystical experiences. He said that they are very rare
and independent of the human will, and discouraged anyone from
seeking them. In other words, the goal of the mystical quest
described in the Writings is not having a mystical experience in its
traditional meaning, but coming closer to God, in one’s “likeness” to
Him. In other words, the goal of the mystical quest is the
development of one’s spiritual capacities through, and in view of,
service. Bausani quotes a Tablet by Bahá’u’lláh, translated by
himself:

> Open thy spiritual wings and soar through all the spiritual
> kingdoms with the swiftness of a lightning. Fling wide
> open the vision of the eyes and regard the grace of the
> invisible world. If thou throwest mud into the water it
> sinks, but if thou depositest a rose into it, it remains like a
> crown floating upon it: i.e., Ωáhir and baqá (exteriority and
> permanence) are better than bá†in and faná’ (interiority
> and annihilation). In other words weight is the cause of
> sinking, therefore thou must free thyself from the weight
> of possessions and, like a rose, in this very bodily frame
> float through eternity upon the surface of earthly
> dominions. (5)21

Bausani interprets this passage as “a very fine criticism of that
system or those systems of religious mysticism (so frequent in
oriental countries and often a cause of decay for those peoples),
which assume that sinking into oneself, shutting one’s eyes to every
exterior reality” and as “a religious indication of exotericism and
activity against the exaggerated importance given by almost all
religions to meditation and annihilation.” Bausani remarks that ““too
often pseudoreligious persons, imagining they are deeply sinking
into unheard of spiritual abysses, do nothing more than mix up their
own subconscious and unconscious zones . . . Only God . . . speaking
through his Manifestations can inspire humanity with creative
thoughts, which result in creative action” (5).

The search for so called c harismas

Another aspect of traditional mysticism, strictly related to the
previous one, and typical of Christian mysticism, is the undue
importance ascribed to the so called charismas, that is, those special
powers, as for example thaumaturgical powers, ascribed to the

saints, that should be the quintessence of mysticism. The Bahá’í
position on this issue is serenely rational, and it is expounded in a
Tablet by Bahá’u’lláh, “The Book of the River (Sa˙ífiy-i-
Sha††íyyih),” Nader Saiedi, who published a provisional translation
of this Tablet, writes that this Tablet explains that

> human reason is incapable of comprehending any
> phenomenon independent of experience and observation.
> If it were not for that actual experience and observation,
> human reason would not believe in the existence of any
> phenomenon. If the rationalist argument for the rejection
> of miracles attributed to the former Prophets were true,
> then the reality of all natural phenomena must be rejected
> as well. (31)
Obviously, the possibility that God, and His Manifestation, may
perform miracles is not denied, but miracles are not considered the
usual method whereby God bestows His grace upon human beings,
because “the miracles desired by people would involve an unnatural
interruption in the natural course of divine revelation ...and far more
negative consequences would result” (32-3). Each person receives the
grace bestowed by God in proportion to her capacities. In this vein,
‘Abdu’l-Bahá says: “man must seek capacity and develop readiness.
As long as he lacks susceptibility to divine influences, he is incapable
of reflecting the light and assimilating its benefits” (PUP 148). The
Manifestations of God guide human beings towards the
development of spiritual capacities through the usual method of
exposing them to the trials of everyday life, while bestowing upon
them the guidance of their teachings and the assistance of spiritual
powers attracted by the efforts exerted by human beings while
trying to follow the divine guidance. Bahá’u’lláh promises the
development of great capacities to any seeker who make sincere
efforts in His way. For example in the Seven Valleys He writes on
the results of a sincere spiritual quest:

> . . . yearning would . . . draw thee from the earthly homeland
> to the first, heavenly abode in the Center of Realities, and
> lift thee to a plane wherein thou wouldst soar in the air
> even as thou walkest upon the earth, and move over the
> water as thou runnest on the land ... (SV 3-4).
And ‘Abdu’l-Bahá writes to a spiritual seeker:

> I now assure thee, O servant of God, that, if thy mind
> become empty and pure from every mention and thought
> and thy heart attracted wholly to the Kingdom of God,
> forget all else besides God and come in communion with
> the Spirit of God, then the Holy Spirit will assist thee with
a power which will enable thee to penetrate all things, and

> a Dazzling Spark which enlightens all sides, a Brilliant
> Flame in the zenith of the heavens, will teach thee that
> which thou dost not know of the facts of the universe and
> of the divine doctrine. (TAB 3:706-7)
But these capacities are acquired through sacrifice and according to
the usual divine method. Bahá’u’lláh writes:

> Know ye that trials and tribulations have, from time
> immemorial, been the lot of the chosen Ones of God and
> His beloved, and such of His servants as are detached from
> all else but Him ....Such is God’s method carried into effect
> of old, and such will it remain in the future. (GWB 129)

Withdrawing from the world

One the innovations of the Bahá’í Faith is that spiritual
confirmation has been bestowed upon issues that the modern world
can hardly recognize as spiritual concerns, and views as social topics.
The so called twelve principles of the Faith are not mere social
statements, they are spiritual principles, that is, descriptions of the
spiritual reality of human relations. Abiding by these principles is as
important as observing the laws of prayer, fast, meditation and daily
reading of the Holy Texts. If these principles are not complied with,
there is no progress in the mystical path. They are not part of the
shell, but of the kernel, of the Faith. In the light of these remarks,
evidently withdrawing from the world, if not just for very short
periods, as Bahá’u’lláh did in Sulaymaníyyih and Shoghi Effendi in
Switzerland, is not part of the Bahá’í mystical path, whose
fundamental part is the journey of return from God to one’s fellow-
beings. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá has reportedly said: “That which is truly
spiritual must light the path to God, and must result in deeds. We
cannot believe the call to be spiritual when there is no result” (ABL
107).

If we add the obligation of giving a spiritual education to our
children since their early infancy, we may suppose that the future
mystics will begin their journey on higher and higher mystical levels.
Therefore it is difficult envisioning which spiritual goals will be
gradually attained and which fruits will be reaped in the Bahá’í
summer and early autumn. As for today, it is enough to understand
that the divine springtime is well advanced, that we are all
encompassed by the divine grace and that the greater spiritual
capacities we will be able to develop through our mystical efforts in
the path of service, the greater will be our practical results in our
foremost task: promoting the oneness of humankind. And perhaps
we may see the realization of the words written by the Báb:

> God hath, according to that which is revealed in the Book,
> taken upon Himself the task of ensuring the ascendancy of
> any one of the followers of the Truth, over and above one hun-
> dred other souls, and the supremacy of one hundred believers
> over one thousand non-believers and the domination of
> one thousand of the faithful over all the peoples and
> kindreds of the earth; inasmuch as God calleth into being
> whatsoever He willeth by virtue of His behest. (SWB 153)
