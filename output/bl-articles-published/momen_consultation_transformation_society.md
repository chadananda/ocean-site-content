Bahá’í Consultation and the Transformation of

Society

Moojan Momen

Abstract: This paper looks at consultation in the Bahá’í Faith. It
starts from the mention of this process in the Kitab-i-Aqdas and
the manner in which this was initially put into practice in Iran in
the late 1870s. It then looks at the ways in which each of the
successive leaders of the Bahá’í Faith — Bahá’u’lláh, `Abdu’l-
Bahá and Shoghi Effendi emphasized the importance of
consultation and promoted its use in the community. Finally,
the paper looks at the role of consultation in the
transformation of society from the present established and
customary practices in the world towards the new World Order
that Bahá’u’lláh envisaged.

Consultation in Tribal Societies and in the Bible

The concept of consultation is a very important one
sociologically since it signals a move away from
authoritarianism towards a situation where the leaders ask the
opinions of others before taking decisions. It seems to be
common in tribal societies that the elders consult when an
important decision is to be made, even if in many cases, it is the
leader who makes the final decision. It is possible to find this
type of consultation referred to in the Bible for example: “Then
King Rehoboam consulted the elders who had served his father
Solomon during his lifetime. ‘How would you advise me to
answer these people?’ he asked.” (1 Kings 12:6)

292                                             Lights of Irfán vol. 15

There is also advice on consulting in the Book of Proverbs:

> A wise man will hear and increase in learning, and a man
> of understanding will acquire wise counsel. (Proverbs 1:5)

> Prepare plans by consultation, and make war by wise
> guidance. (Proverbs 20:18)

> Without consultation, plans are frustrated, but with
> many counselors they succeed. (Proverbs 15:22)

Consultation in Islam

The Arabic for consultation comes from the root shin-waw-
ra — root form shára means to extract honey from a hive, or
from a hollow or from other places where it has been placed by
wild bees. From this derived the meaning of extracting or
making known a matter (e.g. making known one’s thoughts
about a matter) and hence in the mutual forms of the verb, the
third and sixth forms, the meaning of mutually making known
one’s thoughts — and hence the meaning of consultation
emerges.

In Islam, there has been a general idea that consultation is a
good thing. This is based on the authority of the Qur’an where
Muhammad is commanded by God to consult with the people
whom he rules over in Mecca: “It is part of the Mercy of God
that thou dost deal gently with them. Wert thou severe or harsh-
hearted, they would have broken away from about thee: so pass
over (their faults), and ask for (God’s) forgiveness for them; and
consult them in affairs (of moment). Then, when thou hast
Taken a decision put thy trust in God. For God loves those who
put their trust (in Him)” (Qur’an 3:159). Those who order their
affairs by mutual consultation are commended (42:38).
Consultation is also exhorted upon the Muslims in the family;
for example, the parents are urged to consult abut weaning a
baby (2:233).

Bahá’í Consultation                                            293

However, these injunctions are vague as to the details of who
should be consulted and about what. There is a little more
specificity in the Traditions. For example: “`Ali asked, ‘O
Prophet! If we have a matter in which we do not find a
command or prohibition then what is your advice?’ He said,
‘Consult the righteous wise people and do not depend upon
individual opinion.’”

In the strongly patriarchal and hierarchical society of early
Islam, the role of consultation was more or less immediately
relegated to the process of choosing a leader, but once the
leader was chosen, there seems to have been little idea that he
should use consultation in his rule over the people. The first
caliph, Abú Bakr, was chosen by a general consultation of those
Muslims at the portico of the Banú Sa`d immediately after the
death of the prophet. However, important elements of Islamic
society were missing from that consultation, in particular `Alí
and the family of the Prophet. The second caliph was appointed
by the first caliph. The third caliph was appointed by a
consultative assembly of six people chosen by the second caliph.
The fourth caliph, `Alí, was chosen by general acclamation of
the people of Medina and many elements of the Muslim
community were not consulted. After this, Mu`áwiyah seized
the caliphate and the succession to the caliphate became either
hereditary or seized by force down to 1924 when it was
abolished. While the classical Sunni jurists continued to
recommend consultation (shúrah) in the process of electing a
caliph, they do not appear to have thought that it played a role
in the administration of an Islamic state. Thus, in Sunni Islam,
the principle of consultation, while talked about in principle,
was largely ignored in practice until modern times which we will
consider shortly. Since the consultations that were held to
decide the first and third caliph resulted in decisions against
`Alí, consultation has never been held in high regard among Shi`i
Muslims.

Many Islamic tribal societies have ruled their affairs by
calling consultative councils of elders but it is not clear whether

294                                           Lights of Irfán vol. 15

this practice arose out of Islam or was part of the tribe’s
customary practice even before the conversion to Islam. In
modern times, Islamic reformers have argued that the Quranic
injunction to consult is the equivalent of modern democracy.
And so decisions arrived at through parliamentary processes can
be considered to be in accordance with the Qur’an.
Conservative scholars reject this idea and say that shúrah was
only intend as a means for giving advice to the ruler and not for
making decisions. Even then it is not obligatory for the ruler to
pay attention to the advice given. Moreover, there is no place
for non-Muslims in the shúrah process.

Modern Democracy

Interestingly, the processes that led to modern democracy do
not seem to have been much influenced by any of the calls to
consult described above in Judaism, Christianity and Islam.
There are two main forms of democracy, direct and
representative. Direct democracy stems from ancient Greece
and involves convocations of all of the citizenry (which
excluded women, slaves, foreigners, non-landowners, and males
under 20 years old) who voted on important matters. The main
surviving examples of this form of democracy in the modern
world is the town meetings in small towns in New England in
the United States and in the smaller Swiss municipalities. For
obvious reasons, this form of democracy cannot be scaled up
for communities of much more than 6-10,000. However, some
people have considered that binding referenda are a comparable
phenomenon, although limited in that they are typically only
organized for major decisions and thus only occur rarely.

Representative democracy, although commonly stated to
have originated in Rome, stems more from the struggles in the
Middle Ages by the barons to limit the power of the king, which
led in England to the Magna Carta in 1215, in which the king’s
absolute authority was constrained by the concept of due
process and there were provisions that taxation could not be

Bahá’í Consultation                                              295

imposed without “common counsel of our realm” (Clauses 12
and 14) — thus establishing a need for a parliament which was
first called in 1265. After the English Civil War and the
Glorious Revolution of 1688, the English Bill of Rights of 1689
was enacted, and this together with the Reform Act of 1832
established Parliamentary representative democracy as it is
known in England. The vote was finally given to women in
1928\. Thus at first the barons and aristocrats obtained a say in
the running of the country, then propertied males, then all
males, then women. The same general process can be described
in other countries — none of which had any involvement of the
religious principles of consultation.

History of Bahá’í consultation — Bahá’u’lláh

The history of consultation in the Bahá’í Faith starts with the
Kitáb-i-Aqdas in which there is a verse establishing Houses of
Justice in every locality and instructing that the members should
take counsel together:

> The Lord hath ordained that in every city a House of
> Justice be established wherein shall gather counsellors to
> the number of Bahá, and should it exceed this number it
> doth not matter. They should consider themselves as
> entering the Court of the presence of God, the Exalted,
> the Most High, and as beholding Him Who is the
> Unseen. It behoveth them to be the trusted ones of the
> Merciful among men and to regard themselves as the
> guardians appointed of God for all that dwell on earth.
> It is incumbent upon them to take counsel together and
> to have regard for the interests of the servants of God,
> for His sake, even as they regard their own interests, and
> to choose that which is meet and seemly. Thus hath the
> Lord your God commanded you. Beware lest ye put away
> that which is clearly revealed in His Tablet. Fear God, O
> ye that perceive. (KA v. 30)
296                                           Lights of Irfán vol. 15

But in Questions and Answers there is also advice on how
consultation could take place in other circumstances (and the
Universal House of Justice has confirmed that this approach
may be used for example in resolving personal problems):

99. QUESTION: Concerning consultation.

> ANSWER: If consultation among the first group of
> people assembled endeth in disagreement, new people
> should be added, after which persons to the number of
> the Greatest Name, or fewer or more, shall be chosen by
> lot. Whereupon the consultation shall be renewed, and
> the outcome, whatever it is, shall be obeyed. If,
> however, there is still disagreement, the same procedure
> should be repeated once more, and the decision of the
> majority shall prevail. He, verily, guideth whomsoever
> He pleaseth to the right way. (KA 13)

Towards the end of his life, Bahá’u’lláh became more and
more insistent on the importance of consultation. For example
in the Law˙-i-Maqßúd, he states:

> The Great Being saith: The heaven of divine wisdom is
> illumined with the two luminaries of consultation and
> compassion. Take ye counsel together in all matters,
> inasmuch as consultation is the lamp of guidance which
> leadeth the way, and is the bestower of understanding.

(TB 168)

There are many other quotations from Bahá’u’lláh about
consultation, stating that “in all things, it is necessary to
consult,” (CC1 93) and that “No welfare and no well-being can be
attained except through consultation.” (CC1 93)

There are also examples from history that demonstrate the
importance that Bahá’u’lláh attached to consultation:

1. When the Kitab-i-Aqdas first came to Iran, the Bahá’ís
there started to try to implement its provisions. Mírzá

Bahá’í Consultation                                         297

Asadu’lláh Ißfahání who was then in Tehran tried to implement
some of the administrative instructions in the book. With
regard to verse 30, he had no guidance beyond what was in the
text and so he applied his own cultural norms to this. He called
together, in 1294/1877, some of the prominent Bahá’ís and
called this gathering the Assembly of Consultation (majlis-i
shawr) and the house in which they met the House of Justice.
The cultural norms of that society and that time (and indeed of
the whole world at that time) was that it was only the elite
whose opinions were worth hearing and who should therefore be
invited to the consultation.

This group consulted about the affairs of the community, in
secret. The minutes of their meetings exist and show that it was
decided in 1880 to send three of their number on journeys
though Iran to spread the practices of dawn prayers, assemblies
of consultation and communal funds. Ibn-i Aßdaq and Mírzá
Asadu’lláh Ißfahání travelled to Mázandarán and Khurásán,
with the latter going on to Yazd and Ißfahán, while Óájí Mírzá
Óaydar `Alí Ißfahání went to Hamadán.1 When Ibn-i Aßdaq
informed Bahá’u’lláh of the above-mentioned decision of the
assembly of consultation that he and Mírzá Asadu’lláh should
proceed to Khurásán, Bahá’u’lláh replied that although he had
previously indicated his wish that Ibn-i Aßdaq should remain in
the Tehran area, since the decision to go to Khurásán had been
arrived at through consultation, He accepted (maqbúl) the
decision.2

2. When Ibn-i Abhar was forced to leave his hometown of
Abhar, he travelled to `Akká. While there he asked Bahá’u’lláh
where he should take up his residence. Although Bahá’u’lláh was
perhaps better informed about the conditions of the various
Bahá’í communities in Iran and elsewhere and could easily have
given instructions, he replied that Ibn-i Abhar should return to
Iran and consult with the Bahá’ís there about this matter.3

So these appear to be examples of the importance that
Bahá’u’lláh attached to the process of consultation and the

298                                            Lights of Irfán vol. 15

manner in which He indicated its importance by subordinating
His own guidance to that arrived at by consultation.

`Abdu’l-Bahá

`Abdu’l-Bahá wrote a great deal about consultation. He
stated that “consultation is one of the most fundamental
elements of the divine edifice” (CC1 97) and laid out the spiritual
prerequisites for those taking part (CC1 99), emphasising that it
should be used for both personal matters (“Without prior
consultation, take no important step in your own personal
affairs” [CC1 98]), that individuals should consult the Bahá’ís
administrative institutions (CC1 94) and that the Bahá’í
administrative institutions should themselves conduct their
affairs and make their decisions through consultation. (CC1 95)

From the early days of his ministry, `Abdu’l-Bahá established
the Tehran Assembly (in 1897) through instructing the four
Hands of the Cause to select a number of other individuals and
form this assembly. He sent individuals such as Ibn-i Abhar
around Iran with instructions to set up assemblies of
consultation wherever there were Bahá’í communities of a
sufficient size. At first in Iran these were appointed bodies but
gradually, starting in America, these became elected bodies.

When `Abdu’l-Bahá was in Chicago and had just laid the
foundation stone of the House of Worship there and the
convention of the Bahá’í Temple Unity was still in session, he
declined to speak about the House of Worship. Later he said
that if he had spoken, he would have said that the building of
the House of Worship should take place immediately, but it
should be a matter for the consultative assembly.4

Shoghi Effendi

Shoghi Effendi was greatly concerned during his ministry
with building up the Bahá’í administration and with issuing
guidance regarding Bahá’í consultation. As part of this, he

Bahá’í Consultation                                                299

frequently emphasised the importance of the process of
consultation for arriving at decisions in the administrative
order and also the importance of Bahá’ís obeying such
decisions. In only his second letter to the North American
Bahá’ís, Shoghi Effendi related the story that when Shaykh
Faraju’lláh al-Kurdí had submitted his Arabic translation of the
Ishráqát to `Abdu’l-Bahá, the latter, although he was perhaps the
best person to judge the quality of the translation, nevertheless
instructed the Shaykh to submit his translation to the Spiritual
Assembly of Cairo for their approval before publication:

> So great is the importance and so supreme is the
> authority of these assemblies that once `Abdu’l-Bahá
> after having himself and in his own handwriting
> corrected the translation made into Arabic of the
> Ishráqát (the Effulgences) by Sheikh Faraj, a Kurdish
> friend from Cairo, directed him in a Tablet to submit
> the above-named translation to the Spiritual Assembly
> of Cairo, that he may seek from them before publication
> their approval and consent. These are His very words in
> that Tablet:- “His honor, Sheikh Faraju’lláh, has here
> rendered into Arabic with greatest care the Ishráqát and
> yet I have told him that he must submit his version to
> the Spiritual Assembly of Egypt, and I have conditioned
> its publication upon the approval of the above-named
> Assembly. This is so that things may be arranged in an
> orderly manner, for should it not be so any one may
> translate a certain Tablet and print and circulate it on his
> own account. Even a non-believer might undertake such
> work, and thus cause confusion and disorder. If it be
> conditioned, however, upon the approval of the
> Spiritual Assembly, a translation prepared, printed and
> circulated by a non-believer will have no recognition
> whatever.” (BA 23)

And Shoghi Effendi himself set an example to all Bahá’ís of
the need to submit to the results of the consultation of the

300                                            Lights of Irfán vol. 15

assemblies of the administrative order. When he had completed his
translation of the Kitáb-i-ˆqán, he sent it to the United States
NSA for publication together with a letter from his secretary
saying:

> As Shoghi Effendi has been emphasizing the need of
> submitting all publications to the Reviewing Committee,
> he wants to be the first to abide by that rule, though he
> hopes that they will not make unnecessary delay.5

So what has been presented so far in this article are examples
of all three of the central figures in the Bahá’í Faith emphasising
the importance of consultation in their writings and underlining
its importance and setting an example for all Bahá’ís by being
willing to subordinate their own guidance and decisions and
work to the decisions arrived at through consultation by Bahá’ís
and Bahá’í institutions.

Theoretical considerations — the Bahá’í transformation of
society

In the survey above, examples were given of the use of
consultation in religions historically. But as mentioned there,
these examples relate to religion giving approval to the practice
by leaders of consulting with the elders and the elite, before
making a decision. It is really only through secular democratic
processes that the power to choose their own leaders has been
extended to all adults. Even so, by their hegemonic control of
the media and education and the ability that this gives them to
shape the norms of society, it is still white wealthy males who
occupy most of the higher positions in Western societies and
are thus the ones making the decisions for everyone else.

What we appear to see in the Bahá’í Faith is an attempt to
end the present hierarchical structures of society — where power
is constructed in a pyramid and only a few at the top of the
pyramid hold power — and create a more egalitarian society —
where every individual is encouraged to form and express

opinions in a consultative process that can then play a
meaningful role in the decision-making process.

In doing this, the Bahá’í system can be seen as a fusion of the
traditional religious concept of consultation with the secular
concepts of both direct and representative democracy. The
overall result is, ideally, the involvement of all adult Bahá’ís
(and to an extent youth6) in the process of decision making both
directly in the matter of local affairs and also through
representatives in the national and global Bahá’í administrative
order. It is easiest to discuss these three elements in the order in
which they became applied historically in the Bahá’í community:

1. Representative democracy. Bahá’ís directly elect a local
spiritual assembly in every locality where there is a sufficiently
large community to do so. They indirectly (through elected
representative at a national convention) elect a national
spiritual assembly, which in turn directly elects the Universal
House of Justice. This is a system of representative democracy
— although it differs somewhat in that the elected members of
the institutions are not answerable to their electors. These
Bahá’í elected institutions make their decisions through
consultation and `Abdu’l-Bahá states that “It is incumbent upon
every one not to take any step without consulting the Spiritual
Assembly, and they must assuredly obey with heart and soul its
bidding and be submissive unto it...” (CC1 94)

The institutions elected through this process have ultimate
authority over a Bahá’í community. But at the same time, are
exhorted to consult with the Bahá’ís under their jurisdiction so
that the right balance between this authority and the rights of
the individual can be maintained:

> Let us also bear in mind that the keynote of the Cause of
> God is not dictatorial authority but humble fellowship,
> not arbitrary power, but the spirit of frank and loving
> consultation. Nothing short of the spirit of a true Bahá’í
> can hope to reconcile the principles of mercy and
302                                            Lights of Irfán vol. 15

> justice, of freedom and submission, of the sanctity of
> the right of the individual and of self-surrender, of
> vigilance, discretion and prudence on the one hand, and
> fellowship, candour, and courage on the other. (BA 63)

2. Consultation. Both Bahá’u’lláh and `Abdu’l-Bahá wrote
about the importance of consultation and Shoghi Effendi
provided the structure and the principles by which Bahá’í
consultation should occur. The important point about Bahá’í
consultation is that it is not a consultation of the elite. When
there is consultation at the Nineteen-Day Feast, for example, all
of those present may participate and if a vote is taken on a
resolution to send to the local spiritual assembly, then all voting
members vote. The chairman has no casting vote and does not
dictate the agenda, but is responsible for ensuring that the
consultation is not dominated by aggressive or dominating
individuals and that even those who may be reticent are
encouraged to speak.

In the Bahá’í authoritative texts, it is emphasized that Bahá’í
method of consultation is a skill to be learned. (CC2 96) In the
last decade, Bahá’ís have been going through a sequence of
courses. Part of the training imparted in these courses is to
enable people to think about issues and to express their
thoughts in consultation with others. This training is very
important for the large numbers of people in any community
who have been relegated to the lowest level in the power
pyramid, sometimes because of their lack of education or
intellectual capacity, but also often because of their gender,
race, religion or class. Such individuals have experienced all
their lives the fact that their opinions do not matter, have been
told what to think about issues by the newspapers and television
and have learned to remain silent when those higher up the
pyramid have been present. They need to be trained to think for
themselves about issues (and not just to repeat what they have
been told to think) and to have the confidence to express those
thoughts in the consultation setting.

3. Direct Democracy. The most recent element in the present
complex of Bahá’í decision making is the local Reflection
Meeting. Here all those interested meet to consider the needs of
the locality and to consult about both what has happened in the
previous period (and what lessons may be drawn from this) and
also to draw up a plan of action for the forthcoming period.
The focus of the consultation is to promote the welfare and
prosperity of the local area. At a minimum this involves
organising children’s classes, junior youth empowerment
programmes and devotional meetings as well as the sequence of
training courses mentioned above. But as the community
develops, then other needs of the community can be addressed
and plans for action drawn up.

All present at Reflection Meetings may engage in the
consultation and thus be part of the decision-making process
regarding the plans of action. This may include individuals who
are not Bahá’ís but are interested to carry forward this
programme of action; this group of people are called the
“community of interest”. This is an important development
since not only are the voiceless gender, racial, and class elements
in society being given a voice but also, probably for the first
time in religious history, the boundary between believer and
non-believer is also being broken down. This development
means a change towards a situation where everyone in a locality
really can be “one spirit, one soul, leaves of one tree, flowers of
one garden, waves of one ocean” (PUP 23). In addition, a number
of groups of people who may feel excluded from the Bahá’í
community because they do not feel able to keep the laws of
Bahá’u’lláh in particular areas, or they want to remain as
members of their existing religious community because of
family pressures or they cannot accept certain of the Bahá’í
teachings, can nevertheless participate in the Reflection
Meetings and the programme of action. Also included in the
consultations at the Reflection Meetings may be members of
the elected Bahá’í institutions, the local spiritual assembly, and
the members of the appointed arm of the administration

304                                           Lights of Irfán vol. 15

(Auxiliary Board members and their assistants), whose
responsibilities focus on the encouragement and guidance of the
community. These participants are able to feed in the learning
from other localities as well as providing guidance on the best
way forward.

The Reflection Meetings and the sequence of courses that is
designed to enable people to consult and thus to participate in
the Reflection Meetings appear adequately to take care of the
problems associated with delivering simultaneously what James
Fiskin regards as the three desirable but usually incompatible
characteristics of a system of direct democracy — the
Democratic Reform Trilemma:7

> Participation — universal participation in the decision-
> making process by the people affected. This is achieved in
> the Bahá’í mechanism by motivating and giving people the
> skills in the sequence of courses to become involved in
> community action and giving them the confidence and skills
> to participate in the consultative process.
> Deliberation — thoughtful and rational discussion where all
> major points of view are weighted according to evidence.
> This is achieved by training all members of the community in
> the sequence of course to engage meaningfully in the
> consultation process. The Bahá’í consultation process itself
> involves gathering the facts, then applying the relevant
> spiritual and moral principles to the subject under discussion
> and lastly formulating a plan.
> Equality — all members of the population on whose behalf
> decisions are taken have an equal chance of having their
> views taken into account. This is again achieved through the
> consultation process where all are encouraged to put
> forward their opinions and these are then discussed without
> reference to the personalities of those who put forward the
> proposal. The sequence of courses is designed to empower
> the disempowered and enable them to take part in the
> process on an equal footing with others.

In a letter of 1 October 1969, the Universal House of Justice
wrote that: “Authority and direction flow from the Assemblies,
whereas the power to accomplish the tasks resides primarily in
the entire body of the believers” (MUHJ68-73 30). As a result of
the developments of the last two decades in the Bahá’í world,
we seem to be moving to a situation where the ultimate
authority to set the framework of action of the Bahá’í
community rests with the administrative institutions established
through a system of representative democracy. But the
immediate plans of action and day-to-day activities of the
Bahá’í community and its wider community of interest proceed
in accordance with a system of direct democracy at the
Reflection Meeting. Thus the power to create the programmes
of action that will carry forward these processes resides with the
individual Bahá’ís who attend the Reflection Meeting and carry
out the plans decided there. And both the decision making by
the institutions of the representative democracy and the
decision making in the Reflection Meetings is done through a
consultative process, as is the interaction between the elected
institutions and the community of Bahá’ís. Consultation is thus
the oil that keeps the whole machine running and thus the
quality of consultation is an important element in the success of
the system.

The Bahá’í world is still at a very early stage in the
development of this system of combined representative and
direct democracy. The exact nature of the relationship between
the Bahá’í institutions and the direct democracy of the
Reflection Meetings has not yet been fully worked out.
Questions such as: what happens when a Reflection Meeting
takes a decision that the local assembly disapproves of? What
will happen if the community of interest attending Reflection
Meetings outnumber the Bahá’ís and start to take decisions that
are against Bahá’í principles, such as taking off in a party
political direction? Regarding such matters, the Universal House
of Justice envisages the consultations that go on at the
Reflection Meetings as a fluid, open, inclusive system where

306                                            Lights of Irfán vol. 15

experimentation and flexibility are encouraged as part of an
ongoing learning process involving all individuals, communities,
and institutions:

> It should be remembered that the aim of such
> consultations, beyond addressing certain practical
> considerations, is to maintain a high level of enthusiasm
> and to create a spirit of service and fellowship among
> those present. Discussions should not become bogged
> down by undue concern for procedural issues, but
> should focus on what can be achieved and on the joy of
> witnessing the fruits of hard work and diligent effort.8

The Bahá’í programme would thus appear to be a very radical
attempt to restructure society away from its present hierarchal,
patriarchal, hegemonic form into a new form that is more
egalitarian, allowing many who are currently powerless and
cowed into silence to be empowered. In a way, this parallels a
movement in the wider society that is also tending to bring
down the hierarchical structures in society by bypassing them
through social networking and electronic communications. This
movement can be seen in the Arab Spring, the anti-globalization
movement, and the spontaneous unorganized street revolts that
are occurring in many countries where the people are protesting
the actions of their government.

Neither the Bahá’í process or the street movements can be
categorised in the old political framework of Left and Right
Wing politics. They contain elements of both Left (in their
move towards a more egalitarian society) and Right (in their
desire to decentralize and empower the individual). The nearest
analogy that can be drawn is in an example from the Internet.
The old internet, the so-called Web 1.0, consisted of webpages
where the flow of information was one-way — from the owner
of the web-page to the viewer. This corresponds to the present
political system with its hierarchy where orders come down to
the masses, who have little control over what happens to them,
partly as a result of the manipulation and control of

information by the hierarchy. Web 2.0 refers to pages where the
content is created by the viewers — such sites as Wikipedia,
blogs, Facebook, etc. With Web 2.0, the owner of the web-
pages is only responsible for setting the subject and controlling
excesses. This corresponds to the mechanism that Bahá’ís are
creating, where everyone is encouraged to participate in
community action and in the consultative decision-making
process, while the authority for setting the agenda and
controlling excesses rests with the local assembly.

Lastly, the question arises as to whether we can see all of this
foreshadowed in the writings of the founder of the Bahá’í Faith.
Bahá’u’lláh wrote in the framework of a highly hierarchical,
traditional society, for which the norms were completely
different to those operating today. Furthermore, he needed to
be diplomatic in what he wrote so that his words would not
become a source of problems for the Bahá’í community by
appearing to align them with elements in Iran who were
advocating radical measures of reform and causing alarm to the
government. However, one possible meaning of the following
quotation could refer to the present developments in the Bahá’í
Faith. This passage is from the Law˙-i-Itti˙ád, which has not yet
been officially translated. In this tablet, Bahá’u’lláh describes
six types of unity. A provisional translation of the first unity is:

> Thou hast asked about unity (itti˙ád). The first kind of
> unity is unity in religion. This unity has always been the
> cause of the victory of the Faith of God in every age and
> century. Togetherness is the mystic sword of God.

> For example, should a government see that most of the
> people of the country have rent asunder the veils and are
> turning towards the horizon of Divine revelation, it
> should remain silent and should listen to what is said.
> Each person who is attentive attains to the knowledge of
> God, except those who are utterly distant from the
> Mercy of God.9

When I first translated this tablet more than a decade ago,
the way I had translated this passage was rejected by a number
of Persian speakers. The issue was around the interpretation to
be given to the words rendered above as “it [the government]
should remain silent and listen to what is said (sákit shavad va
ánchih guftih shavad bishnavad)”. They thought (and I later
discovered that Mr Adib Taherzadeh when discussing this tablet
summarizes this tablet in this way also) that this sentence should
be read as though “what is said” means “what is said by the
Divine Revelation” — that is to say that if the majority of a
nation became Bahá’ís, then the government should be silent
and pay heed to the words of the Bahá’í revelation. Or in the
paraphrase of Mr Taherzadeh: “when the majority of the people
in a country embrace His Cause, then the government will be
able to put into practice His teachings and commandments.”10

Given the recent developments in the Bahá’í Faith described
above, I now think that my original translation may well have
been correct and that “what is said” refers to “what is said by
the people”. In other words that once the people were following
the path laid down by God, the government should allow the
people to take control of their own affairs and should listen to
what they say; in other words that they would be able to steer
their own path and would need little control and direction from
the centre.11 If this second reading is correct, it points to the
path that Shoghi Effendi indicated when he laid down the
principle that the Bahá’í community should, as far as possible
operate in a decentralised manner.12 This is also the path that the
Universal House of Justice has taken as it has gradually
devolved responsibility for the creation and execution of
expansion plans from the international level to the national
level and increasingly to the local level, as the communities have
matured and gained experience. It also points to the evolution
of the Reflection Meeting where once the people in an area have
had the necessary training through the sequence of courses and
have understood the Bahá’í system of consultation, they can be

allowed to plan and execute programmes of action. In the words
of the Universal House of Justice:

> Specifically, a space has been created, in the agency of
> the reflection meeting, for those engaged in activities at
> the cluster level to assemble from time to time in order
> to reach consensus on the current status of their
> situation, in light of experience and guidance from the
> institutions, and to determine their immediate steps
> forward.13
