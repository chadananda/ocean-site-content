  The Bahá’í Writings and Kant’s “Perpetual Peace”1

Ian Kluge

Introduction
In 1795, Immanuel Kant published Perpetual Peace: A Philosophical
Sketch2 in which he outlined the practical steps necessary to end war
among nation-states. This work is a part of the history3 of utopian
thought4 in Europe, and was preceded by a long tradition of plans to
improve individuals and the society that began most famously with
Plato’s Republic, continues through St. Thomas More’s Utopia, and
comes in the period before and after Kant to a number of propos-
als for eliminating war. Among those preceding Kant’s “Perpetual
Peace” was Emeric Cruce’s Discourses on the Opportunities and Means
for Establishing a General Peace and Freedom of Trade Throughout the
World (c.1623).5 Among the root causes of war, Cruce listed “bigotry,
profit, reparation and glory-seeking.”6 In his view, the best way to
overcome these causes are closer trade and communication among
the peoples of the world, a global currency and a political congress
made of representatives from all of humankind. His solutions are
still discussed today.7 Another noteworthy work in the ‘peace tradi-
tion’ is William Penn’s “An Essay Towards the Present and Future Peace
of Europe” (1693). Penn proposes a European parliament with man-
datory attendance by all European monarchs to settle all disputes
that cannot be solved by direct negotiations by the affected parties.
States refusing to submit their differences or refusing to abide by
the European parliament’s decisions shall be compelled to do so and
be liable for all costs and damages resulting from their refusal. Two
decades after Penn, the French philosopher Saint-Pierre published
A Project for Setting an Everlasting Peace in Europe (1714) which

Lights of ‘Irfán Book Thirteen

suggested that peace was best achieved by uniting all European
states into a “representative federation based on population rather
than power”8 and by limiting the size of national armies. Difficult
issues would be discussed and resolved by committees established to
reconcile conflicting claims. In short, the relations among European
states were to be based on the rule of law and not on the ambitions
or advantages of kings. Jean-Jacque Rousseau suggested a European
federation or confederation united by the rule of law in A Lasting
Peace Through the Federation of Europe (1782). Rousseau saw four
necessary requirements for a lasting European peace: first, all the
important powers in Europe must be members of this federation;
second, whatever laws these powers legislate must be binding on all;
third, there must be a common military force able to compel obe-
dience from every members state and fourth, once in, no state can
withdraw from this federation.9 Here, too, we observe a proposal
for a trans-national parliament with dispute setting powers and the
means for enforcing its judgments.

There were, of course, others who had contributed to this ‘peace
tradition’ before Kant. Three of the most famous are Hugo Grotius
who formulated the first code of international laws regarding war and
peace (1625), Samuel Pufendorf, the first man to be a professor of
international law (1674) and Christian Wolff who tried to organize
the different types of laws among nations (1754) in order to clarify
legal processes. Of course, these authors advocated plans to bring
order to current diplomatic and military practices rather than the
complete elimination of international conflict. War among sovereign
nation-states might be limited in scope to combatants, made more
humane and legally allowed only in certain circumstances but the
practice of war would remain as a tragic but inevitable part of the
human existence. However, what Cruce, Penn, Saint-Pierre, Kant
and the Bahá’í Writings aim at is the eventual complete elimination
of war itself.

Because of Kant’s incalculable influence on the development of
virtually all aspects of modern philosophy and thought in general,
our comparison study will focus on the Bahá’í Writings and “To
Perpetual Peace: A Philosophical Sketch.” We shall devote our efforts
to answering one question: To what extent does Kant’s essay directly
anticipate and/or indirectly foreshadow the Bahá’í teachings about
the elimination of war and the establishment of a workable peace?
Answering this question requires a careful examination of their simi-
larities and differences not only in what is or is not said explicitly but
also in what is also left implicit or in the background.

Our examination will show that while there are numerous similarities
between “Perpetual Peace” and the Bahá’í Writings, these similari-
ties are not only superficial, but also accidental and not essential. In
other words, as long as we confine ourselves to surface presentations,
it appears that Kant’s proposals and the Writings are much of a kind,
but in-depth analysis shows such is not the case. Indeed, because these
similarities are based on vastly different foundational principles, they
are accidental or coincidental, rather than essential and necessary
conclusions derived from common principles. Therefore, any claim
that Kant anticipated Bahá’u’lláh is only tenable when our analysis
remains superficial.

1: A Brief Overview of Kant’s
“Perpetual Peace: A Philosophical Sketch”
At the beginning of the first section, Kant outlines the six “prelimi-
nary articles for perpetual peace among nations.” (Kant 1983, 107)
The first of these is, “No treaty of peace that tacitly reserves issues
for a future war shall be held valid.” (ibid) In other words, no treaty
may have secret clauses that legitimize future declarations of war.
Obviously such clauses would change a peace treaty into a mere
truce. Kant’s second article states that “No independent nation, be

Lights of ‘Irfán Book Thirteen

it large or small, may be acquired by another nation by inheritance,
exchange, purchase or as a gift.” (ibid 108) Territories and especially
human beings are not “mere objects to be manipulated at will.” (ibid)
This principle stems from Kant’s famous dictum that human beings
are never to be treated as objects or means disposable for others’
use.10 The third article says that “Standing armies (miles perpetuus)
shall gradually be abolished” (Kant 1983, 108) for the simple rea-
son that maintaining them lays unduly burdensome expenditures
on the people. Article four demands that “No national debt shall
be contracted in connection with the foreign affairs of a nation.”
(ibid 109) Kant believed that contracting foreign debt especially
with regard to foreign affairs encouraged profligate spending and
military adventures. In the fifth article, Kant asserts the principle
of absolute national sovereignty: “No nation shall forcibly interfere
with the constitution and government of another.” (ibid 109) Finally,
the sixth article states, “No nation at war with another shall per-
mit such acts of war as shall make mutual trust impossible during
some future time of peace.” (ibid) In other words, countries must not
make use of tactics like assassination, encouraging treason in the
opposing nation, or other underhanded stratagems that erode the
trust necessary to build a future peace.

Kant next adds three “definitive articles of perpetual peace” (ibid 112)
the first of which is that “[t]he civil constitution of every nation should
be republican,” (ibid) i.e. members of every nation-state should be free
and in government, the executive and legislative powers should be
separate. (ibid 114) The second “definitive article” states that “the right
of nations shall be based on a federation of free states” (ibid 115) that
would eventually include all nations. (ibid 117) The third and final
article states that “Cosmopolitan right shall be limited to conditions
of universal hospitality.” (ibid 118) A visitor to a foreign country has
a right to hospitality “as long as he behaves peaceably.” (ibid) In other
words, citizenship is universal, or global, so long as a person does
nothing to undermine the peace.

In the first of the two supplements, Kant explains that

> Perpetual peace is insured (guaranteed) by nothing less
> than that great artist nature (natura daedala rerum) whose
> mechanical process makes purposiveness [Zweckmaessigkeit]
> visibly manifest, permitting harmony to emerge among men
> through their discord, even against their wills. (ibid 120).

In this passage (remarkably prescient of Hegel’s theory of history)
Kant seems to be predicting that human unity will occur not just
despite the fact of war but also because of the fact of human war. Con-
flict, he says has not just driven peoples to populate the world but also
to “establish more or less legal relationships.” (ibid 121) Like Toynbee
after him, Kant noticed that peoples entangled in war inevitably draw
closer even though this is not their intent. Kant’s second supplement
requires that while political leaders must rule, they should at least
consult with philosophers who bring a wider perspective to the analy-
sis of any subject. Obviously, the idea of Plato’s philosopher king still
has some life left in it according to Kant. The two appendices which
follow the supplements are concerned with various issues related to
the concept of individual, public and international “right” which Kant
believes must underlie any perpetual peace.

2: The Baha’i Vision of International Order: An Overview
Bahá’u’lláh’s vision for the attainment of world peace is divided
into two major phases, a Lesser Peace which will “be established
through the efforts of the nations of the world” 11 and the Most Great
Peace which is “the ultimate peace promised to all the peoples and
nations.”12 The Most Great Peace will be the crowning stage of the
current chapter of human development. According to Bahá'u'lláh,
the process leading to these momentous and revolutionary changes
has already begun:

Lights of ‘Irfán Book Thirteen

> The world’s equilibrium hath been upset through the vibrating
> influence of this most great, this new World Order. Mankind’s
> ordered life hath been revolutionized through the agency of this
> unique, this wondrous System—the like of which mortal eyes
> have never witnessed. (GWB 136)

In other words, Bahá’u’lláh’s Revelation has initiated the process
by which “[m]ankind’s ordered life,” i.e. politics, culture, economics
and spirituality will be “revolutionized” or radically transformed in
ways unimaginable in pre-global phases of historical development.
Now that all human activities are globally inter-connected, radically
new ways of thinking and acting are necessary for individuals and
collectives like national states, economies and religions. Bahá’u’lláh
prophesies that this may happen more quickly than we think: “Soon
will the present-day order be rolled up, and a new one spread out in its
stead” (GWB 313) These changes are unavoidable because it is no
longer reasonable to believe that “the world will somehow be able to
continue muddling its way through world-problems using nation-
oriented solutions.”13 The current order stands in the way of human
progress, i.e. hinders the full realization of individual and collective
potentials and must be replaced by something else. This immanent
transformation will be ‘revolutionary’ not in the historical sense of
fomenting a violent upheaval but in the sense of changing the funda-
mental principles by which individuals and societies view the world
and function. Such changes will be far-reaching and deep because
they extend beyond the superstructural phenomena of politics,
culture and economics and “revolutionized the soul of mankind.” (PB
117) In other words, these changes touch the very foundations of
human nature.

Before humankind can attain the Most Great Peace, it must first
establish the Lesser Peace. Bahá’u’lláh writes,

> We pray God—exalted be His glory—and cherish the hope
> that He may graciously assist the manifestations of affluence
> and power and the daysprings of sovereignty and glory, the
> kings of the earth—may God aid them through His strength-
> ening grace—to establish the Lesser Peace. This, indeed, is the
> greatest means for insuring the tranquillity of the nations. It is
> incumbent upon the Sovereigns of the world—may God assist
> them—unitedly to hold fast unto this Peace, which is the chief
> instrument for the protection of all mankind… It is their duty
> to convene an all-inclusive assembly, which either they them-
> selves or their ministers will attend, and to enforce whatever
> measures are required to establish unity and concord amongst
> men. They must put away the weapons of war, and turn to the
> instruments of universal reconstruction. Should one king rise
> up against another, all the other kings must arise to deter him.
> Arms and armaments will, then, be no more needed beyond
> that which is necessary to insure the internal security of their
> respective countries. (ESW 30)

Although it has spiritual aspects, the Lesser Peace is chiefly a politi-
cal process involving the nations of the world. It will come about
not so much by virtue of spiritual enlightenment as by the quest
for national survival and mutual economic benefit, i.e. by largely
secular concerns. These concerns may be correlated with some spiri-
tual developments, but spiritual matters are not of primary interest.
According to Ali Nakhjavani, the Lesser Peace “is solely founded
upon political considerations and requirements”14 and will be viewed
by political leaders “as the last and only remaining solution to their
political ideals.”15 He adds,

> although its future constitution will—to some extent—be
> influenced by moral and ethical standards, it will undoubt-
> edly be devoid of the bounty of the spiritual principles of the
> Cause of God.16

Lights of ‘Irfán Book Thirteen

In other words, the Lesser Peace is primarily political and not spiritual
in nature. This means, among other things, that the Lesser and Most
Great embody two different forms of consciousness, one grounded
in purely human will and without any concern for the transcendent
aspects of reality, and the other grounded in transcendent divine will
as expressed in revelation. These forms of consciousness are mani-
fested in differences in law, culture, philosophy, social organization
and norms, leadership the arts as well as the life-expectations people
have. But the differences go further. We might also say that the Lesser
Peace is superstructural insofar as it is not based on humankind’s
spiritual nature, i.e. does not involve the whole human being. Given
the frailty of human nature, this is not assuring.

If the Lesser Peace did not lead to the Most Great Peace, humankind
would never evolve spiritually. Shoghi Effendi states,

> No machinery falling short of the standard inculcated by the
> Bahá’í Revelation, and at variance with the sublime pattern
> ordained in His teachings, which the collective efforts of mankind
> may yet devise can ever hope to achieve anything above or beyond
> that “Lesser Peace” to which the Author of our Faith has Himself
> alluded in His writings. (WOB 162)

This statement clearly means that the Lesser Peace while necessary, is
not sufficient for the fullest development of human potentials both
in individuals and in collectives. It is not sufficient because, among
other things, “religious strife and racial prejudice will not have
entirely left the hearts and souls of the human race.” 17 Moreover, in
the last analysis, how much can we rely on superstructural political,
cultural, and economic changes that are not grounded in spiritual
transformations that have “revolutionized the soul of mankind”? (PB
117) We need more than good intentions.

This intermediate stage is called Great Peace, a terminology used
in the Bahá’í Writings in Persian, and as elaborated by Ali Nakh-
javani, the historical nature of human development means there will
be an intermediate, transition period between the Lesser Peace and
the Most Great Peace. In this transition period, we can observe the
appearance of some of the key components of the Most Great Peace.18
This intermediate phase is the “Great Peace,” is the time when “the
Bahá’í Teachings will have beyond any doubt penetrated the organs
of the Lesser Peace”19 and when religious and racial prejudice will
be eliminated. Bahá’í institutions will become influential at all levels
in the unfolding unification of humankind and the renewal of all
aspects of human existence. However, even at this point, the crown-
ing achievement of this development is missing, namely the Most
Great Peace. In the words of Bahá'u'lláh,

> That which the Lord hath ordained as the sovereign remedy
> and mightiest instrument for the healing of all the world is the
> union of all its peoples in one universal Cause, one common
> Faith. This can in no wise be achieved except through the power
> of a skilled, an all-powerful and inspired Physician. This, verily,
> is the truth, and all else naught but error. (SLH 91 emphasis
> added)

`Abdu’l-Bahá says, “All men will adhere to one religion, will have one

common faith, will be blended into one race, and become a single people.
All will dwell in one common fatherland, which is the planet itself. (SAQ

> 64–65) Of course, this spiritual unity will reflect itself in the gov-
> ernance of the new world order and the establishment of a renewed
> cultural, scientific, economic and political existence.

Because the Lesser Peace and the Most Great Peace are phases of a
single historical process, we shall discuss them both in our study of
the Writings and Kant’s “Perpetual Peace.”

3\. A World Federation

The best known feature of Kant’s “Perpetual Peace” is his proposal for
a “league of peace” (Kant 1983, 117) whose goal is to “end all wars
forever.” (ibid) In Kant’s view, the most practical way to achieve this
goal is by means of a “federation of free states” (ibid 115) that will
eventually include all nations on earth. As members of this “league”
or “federation,” all nations give up the right of their “savage (lawless)
freedom” (ibid 117) to make war just as individuals give up some of
their ‘lawless’ freedoms in return for the benefits of living in a peace-
ful nation. Restraining the exercise of some of their freedoms is the
only way for individuals and nations to the gain greater advantages
made possible by cooperation, especially in regards to collective
security. Kant says, “For the sake of its own security, each nation can
and should demand that the others enter a contract resembling the
civil one and guaranteeing the rights of each.” (ibid) Furthermore, for
Kant, the guarantee of national rights was an absolute necessity in
upholding peace:

> This league does not seek any power of the sort possessed by
> nations but only maintenance and security for each nation’s
> own freedom as well as that of other nations leagued with it
> without their having thereby to subject themselves to civil
> laws and their constraints (as men in a state of nature must
> do). It can be shown that this idea of federalism should
> eventually include all nations and lead to perpetual peace.

(ibid 117 emphasis added)

In other words, Kant’s vision limits the powers of the federation to
external affairs, specifically in regards to waging war, and does not
envisage any jurisdiction over a state’s internal issues. Nations will
not be subject to “civil laws” the way individuals are subject to “civil
laws” within the state. This view harmonizes with his previously
announced principle that “No nation shall forcibly interfere with the

constitution and government of another.” (ibid 109) The principle of
national sovereignty, i.e. non-interference in a state’s internal affairs
prevails in Kant’s proposals.

This aspect of “Perpetual Peace” shows that Kant’s thinking lies within
the framework of the Treaty of Westphalia (1648) which established
the modern nation-state system on the principle of absolute national
sovereignty. Consequently, he is at pains to point out that nations
voluntarily join the “league of peace” “without their having thereby to
subject themselves to civil laws and their constraints.” (ibid 117) They are
only subjecting themselves to a voluntary agreement regarding exter-
nal relationships, specifically about war and the capacity to go to war
and not about their own internal affairs. There they retain absolute
sovereign rights. According to Kant, nations give up the right to war
only because it is irrational: it replaces reason with force and it serves
only those “who are disposed to seek one another’s destruction and
thus to find perpetual peace in the grave.” (ibid) In short, it serves
only the blood-thirsty.

However, in one respect Kant’s proposal leaves the Westphalian
framework behind, viz. the recognition that purely nation-based
solutions to the problem of war will not work. Simple bi-lateral
agreements among individual nations are not enough to ensure
peace. Consequently, some kind of ‘supra-national’ agency is needed,
a “league of peace” which ensures that all members are committed
to the same basic principles, i.e. have unity of vision, and act within
the same basic limitations, i.e. have some unity of action. This unity
of outlook and action lays the foundation for predictability in inter-
nationality and, thereby, for stability and peace. International action
will thus be driven by law and not by personal will.

Nevertheless, Kant’s move beyond the Westphalian model is rather
limited, more a matter of improving than actually dealing with
the fundamental short-comings of the model. As we shall observe

> below, his proposals leave too much power in the hands of individual
> nations and rulers to be truly effective in preserving peace. In short,
“Perpetual Peace” is too restricted in its scope to achieve its goal. There

> is, for example, no clear method for dealing with recalcitrant rulers
> and nations or even those who renege on their commitments, i.e. no
> way of dealing with “rogue states” which threaten the peace. It is also
> doubtful that by themselves Kant’s proposals are enough to lay a
> foundation for a lasting peace. For example, he is silent about the
> need for a unified world-view among the peoples of the world—as
> distinct from their governments—or the abolition of racial, religious
> and class prejudice. These are not just theoretical quibbles. In the
> 20th Century humankind has had bitter experience with the ability
> of clashing world-views or ideologies and racial, religious and class
> prejudices to plunge the planet into mass warfare despite such inter-
> national agreements as the Kellogg-Briand Pact (General Treaty for
> the Renunciation of War, 1928), which was signed by virtually every
> participant in WW II. Obviously, purely political or diplomatic
> agreements are not enough to ensure peace.

The Bahá’í teachings certainly agree with Kant as to the need for a
global federation in preventing war and to establish a “world federal
system” (WOB 204) in which humankind will be “liberated from the
curse of war and its miseries.” (WOB 204) Elsewhere the Guardian
refers to `Abdu’l-Bahá’s hope “in the hoisting of the standard of the
Lesser Peace, in the unification of mankind, and in the establishment
of a world federal government on this planet.” (CF 126) However,
while for Kant, the realization of a global federation or “league of
peace” marks the terminus of humankind’s socio-political evolution,
for the Bahá’í Faith, the Lesser Peace which brings about “unity in the
political realm” (SWAB 32) is only a transition phase to the still more
comprehensive Most Great Peace in which

> all nations and kindreds will be gathered together under the
> shadow of this Divine… and will become a single nation.

> Religious and sectarian antagonism, the hostility of races and
> peoples, and differences among nations, will be eliminated. All
> men will adhere to one religion, will have one common faith, will
> be blended into one race, and become a single people. All will
> dwell in one common fatherland (SAQ 65 emphasis added).

In the Bahá’í vision, the ultimate end of our social evolution will be
a unity based on spiritual principles which will over-ride differences
of religion, race, class and nationality, and make the earth itself our
homeland. This, of course, requires a momentous spiritual transfor-
mation that will, in effect, make politics as we know them, obsolete.

> For Kant, such a vision raises concerns about national sovereignty i.e.
> the rights of nations. When all “dwell in one common fatherland” what
> remains of the autonomy of the national state? As he says, “Such a
> federation is necessarily tied rationally to the concept of the right
> of nations.” (Kant 1983, 117) Only in regards to war-making can
> there be any limitation of national sovereignty or rights. The basic
> problem with this is that as noted above, in the 20th Century we have
> learned by experience that establishing peace requires measures far
> beyond political and diplomatic agreements for reducing the ability
> to wage war; enduring peace can only be established when other, non-
> political/diplomatic conditions are met such as unity of world-view
> and the abolition of racial, national, religious and class prejudice. It is
> relatively easy for well-meaning or politically shrewd nations to admit
> that unilateral war-making is not a national right. As Kant says,
“[F]rom the throne of its moral legislative power, reason absolutely

> condemns war as a means of determining the right.” (ibid 116) Few
> would argue that being stronger proves one is right. However, the
> question that 20th Century history raises is ‘How long can such good
> political intentions last if the foundations for peace are not firmly in
> place’? How long can they resist internal pressure from a population
> ablaze with racial, religious, nationalist or class fervor? And how long
> can they refrain from war in a struggle of ideologies? Kant, of course,

could not have foreseen such developments and, therefore, he set up
no provisions for preventing or short-circuiting them. The Bahá’í
Writings, on the other hand, seem to have foreseen such develop-
ments insofar as they prescribe, as we shall see, the exact measures
needed to forestall them. While they do not use the word ‘ideology’—
who would have understood it at the time?—they do prescribe the
exact remedies needed to undermine and undo the effects of these
various forms of prejudice and their ideological outgrowths.

The Bahá’í Writings both agree and disagree with Kant’s propos-
als in “Perpetual Peace.” They agree that the “league of peace” must
be a federation of some kind. Asked by an official of the American
government how best to serve both the interests of his country and
the people of the world, `Abdu’l-Bahá advised him “to assist in the
eventual application of the principle of federalism underlying the govern-
ment of your own country to the relationships now existing between
the peoples and nations of the world.” (WOB 36 emphasis added) In
American federalism, responsibilities and rights are divided between
the central government which looks after the well-being of the whole
federation, and the states which look after a particular part of the
union. The individual states are united by a covenant or agreement
but are not subject to an autocratic centralized government. In this
regard, `Abdu’l-Bahá also states,

> It is very evident that in the future there shall be no centralization
> in the countries of the world, be they constitutional in government,
> republican or democratic in form. The United States may be held
> up as the example of future government—that is to say, each
> province will be independent in itself, but there will be federal
> union protecting the interests of the various independent states
> (PUP 167 emphasis added).

It is noteworthy that the “ federal union” will protect the legitimate
interests of its “independent states.” What these “legitimate interests”

are may, of course, vary from one historical circumstance to another;
this guarantees flexibility but the rights and responsibilities of the
constituent states prevents this power to look after the whole from
becoming a dictatorial centralized power. According to Shoghi
Effendi, the principle of federalism applies even to the Most Great
Peace; he describes the international form of government in the Most
Great Peace as “a world federal system.” (WOB 203)

> This general agreement notwithstanding, the Bahá’í concept of
> federalism differs substantially from Kant’s. The difference is not
> one of degree but of kind. As we have already seen, Kant writes
> that nation-states can join the federal union of the “league of
> peace” “without their having thereby to subject themselves to civil
> laws and their constraints.” (Kant 1983, 117) Elsewhere he writes,
“Nations can press their rights only by waging war and never in a

trial before an independent tribunal,” (ibid 116) and that nations
“have outgrown the compulsion to subject themselves to another

> legal constitution that is subject to someone else’s concept of right.”
> (ibid) In other words, nations remain absolutely sovereign except in
> regards to war-making which they relinquish by voluntary agree-
> ment. There is no supra-national authority or tribunal where a state
> may be arraigned.

Such is not the case in the Bahá’í vision of a world federalism neither
in the Lesser Peace nor in the Most Great Peace. Shoghi Effendi
points out that Bahá’u’lláh advocates “the inevitable curtailment of
unfettered national sovereignty as an indispensable preliminary to
the formation of the future Commonwealth of all the nations of the
world.” (WOB 40) This preliminary to the Commonwealth of the
Most Great Peace is foundational to the Bahá’í vision of the future
world order. Humanity must abandon the basic principle of the
Westphalian system of international politics in order to attain genu-
ine security and progress in eliminating the basic causes of war. This
alone makes the difference between Kant’s “Perpetual Peace” and the

Bahá’í vision a difference not in degree but in kind. In essence, Kant’s
plan is still Westphalian in nature, and Bahá’u’lláh’s is not and this
divergence leads to a number of significant consequences.

For example, as Shoghi Effendi tells us, there will be more than a
“league of peace”—there will be a “world super-state” (WOB 40) in

> which all nations will not only give up the right to make war, and,
> by implication, to build up war-making potentials, but will also
> give up “certain rights to impose taxes.” (WOB 40) The political
> and diplomatic provisions for limiting the capacity for waging war
> are, in principle, present in Kant’s dictum that “standing armies
> (miles perpetuus) shall be gradually abolished.” (Kant 1983, 108)
> Obviously, standing armies must be eliminated not only because
> they encourage wars of aggression by encouraging arms-races that
> increase the risks of war breaking out, but also because they impose
> needless and burdensome costs on the citizens of a nation. How-
> ever, nothing in “Perpetual Peace” suggests that the “league of peace”
> will “include within its orbit an international executive adequate to

absolute, even autarkical independence, members of the WTO take
each other to binding arbitration on a regular basis and political
leaders have found themselves charged and/or tried by the Interna-
tional Criminal Court in The Hague for policies they have enacted
both abroad and in their own countries. Finally nations can find
themselves being sanctioned by the U.N. for their behavior. Appeals
to the principle of absolute national sovereignty are still made but
they no longer carry the conceptual or ethical force they once did.
The Westphalian concept of unfettered national independence is
rapidly becoming an artifact of humankind’s political past.

On this issue of absolute national independence and tribunals,
`Abdu’l-Bahá says:

> It is necessary that the nations and governments organize an
> international tribunal to which all their disputes and differ-
> ences shall be referred. The decision of that tribunal shall be
> final… International questions will come before the universal
> tribunal, and so the cause of warfare will be taken away. (PUP
> 300 emphasis added)

> In other words, on certain matters at least, nations can indeed, be
> required to face an international tribunal which is akin to a Supreme
> Court in a federal system. Moreover, this tribunal’s decisions are
“final,” i.e. not appealable to any higher authority and thus, binding

on nation-states. Shoghi Effendi adds,

> A world tribunal will adjudicate and deliver its compulsory
> and final verdict in all and any disputes that may arise between
> the various elements constituting this universal system. (WOB
> 202 emphasis added)

The fact that this tribunal’s verdicts are compulsory in “all and any dis-
putes” involving the “various elements” making up the “universal system”

suggests that even non-state actors like NGO’s, transnational corpora-
tions, cartels and international unions fall under its jurisdiction. After
all, modern politics, especially at the international level, is no longer
limited to state-actors as was traditionally the case. This position, too,
indicates a substantial difference with Kant’s proposals and outlook
insofar as the Bahá’í plan is not necessarily limited to state-actors.

Lest there be any misunderstanding, it is important to re-emphasize
that the Bahá’í version of world federalism simply applies the feder-
alist principle of the division of powers to the international sphere.
The central government and each constituent state, province, canton
or republic have their own, inviolable sphere of rights, powers and
responsibilities. There will be no autarkies. “[E]ach province will be
independent in itself, but there will be federal union protecting the inter-
ests of the various independent states.” (PUP 167) With this division of
power “the autonomy of its state members and the personal freedom
and initiative of the individuals that compose them are definitely and
completely safeguarded.” (WOB 202) According to Shoghi Effendi,
even though there will be “a single code of international law” (WOB
40) in the future world commonwealth, “the autonomy of its state
members and the personal freedom and initiative of the individuals
that compose them are definitely and completely safeguarded.” (WOB
202) He adds that in a Bahá’í global federation, there is no intent “to
abolish the system of national autonomy so essential if the evils of
excessive centralization are to be avoided.” (WOB 41 emphasis
added) Over-centralization is seen as a cause of war for which reason
one of the goals of the future world is “[t]o cast aside centralization which
promotes despotism is the exigency of the time. This will be productive of
international peace.” (PUP 167 emphasis added)

A federal framework is also conducive to the essential Bahá’í concept
of unity in diversity, i.e. the goal of preserving unity while at the same
time maintaining

> the diversity of ethnical origins, of climate, of history, of
> language and tradition, of thought and habit, that differenti-
> ate the peoples and nations of the world. It calls for a wider
> loyalty, for a larger aspiration than any that has animated
> the human race (WOB 41).

Shoghi Effendi summarizes the Bahá’í position: “It repudiates
excessive centralization on one hand, and disclaims all attempts at
uniformity on the other. Its watchword is unity in diversity” (WOB
41). Federalism is the only way to achieve this goal.

> Because excessive centralism inevitably leads to tensions and hostili-
> ties, it is an example of ‘structural violence,’ i.e. social, economic and
> political structures that repress certain groups and deprive them of
> their rights. This repression is built into law, political processes and
> rules, social customs and economic arrangements and are regarded as
‘normal’ or ‘appropriate’ by those who benefit from the arrangements.

> Sooner or later, however, such structural violence erupts into open
> hostilities because it is inherently unjust; “the absence of justice is
> the principle source of social upheaval and unrest.”20 On this issue

> as part of their proposals. Whether Kant was aware of them or not is
> a matter for Kant specialists to decide. What matters to this study is
> that in contrast to the Bahá’í Writings, Kant gives no consideration
> to the topic of structural violence.

The Bahá’í Writings make it clear that economic injustice is an
absolutely intolerable form of structural violence and to cure it
envisages a “world community in which all economic barriers will
have been permanently demolished and the interdependence of Cap-
ital and Labor definitely recognized.” (WOB 40) Unlike Kant, the

Bahá’í federal system recognizes that economic ties are necessary to
establish and maintain peace both within nations and among them.
Within nations, the Writings teach that the extremes of wealth and
poverty should be abolished (DG 20) not only because such extremes
are unjust but also because they create a climate for class conflict
within society. By recognizing the “interdependence of Capital and
Labor” Bahá’í federalism removes the basis for all concepts of class
warfare, i.e. the belief that the interests of the working classes and of
capitalists or investors are always irrevocably opposed in a struggle
that can only end with the complete victory of one or the other. By
saying that “Capital and Labor” are interdependent, the Bahá’í
federalism suggests that their best interests can be managed so they
are complementary insofar as each depends on the other. Thus, each
benefits by restraining and conforming its demands for the good of
the whole economic system. Furthermore, at the international level,
making nations economically inter-dependent and, thereby making
each of them an integral part of the global economy will help make
destructive actions such as war economically unfeasible. The more
national economies depend on each other, the less they are able to go
to war against each other.

Finally, the Bahá’í federal world order will be one in which:

> the clamor of religious fanaticism and strife will have been
> forever stilled; in which the flame of racial animosity will have
> been finally extinguished; in which a single code of interna-
> tional law—the product of the considered judgment of the
> world's federated representatives—shall have as its sanction
> the instant and coercive intervention of the combined forces
> of the federated units; and finally a world community in
> which the fury of a capricious and militant nationalism will
> have been transmuted into an abiding consciousness of world
> citizenship (WOB 40 emphasis added)

In the future state sought by Bahá’ís, some of the major causes for
war will be eliminated, i.e. “religious fanaticism” as well as “racism”
and lawlessness or anarchy in international affairs. The first two
undermine peace because they are really forms of tribalism dividing
humankind into “them versus us” factions and, thereby, creating a
culture of conflict that is the necessary psycho-social pre-condition
for war. Without a “single code of international law” there will be
anarchy in international affairs which is turn engenders an atmo-
sphere of mutual suspicion and fear of the unpredictable, in which
arms races flourish. These, in turn, destabilize international affairs
and often make it easy for wars to be ignited.

> There will also be a monumental expansion of loyalties as people see
> themselves not only as citizens of a particular nation but also as citi-
> zens of the world. This widening of perspective is not merely a matter
> of sentiment. Our loyalties influence our priorities and these affect
> our actions. For example, the issue of global poverty elicits different
> responses from those who think primarily in terms of a global loyalty
> than from those who think primarily in terms of national loyalty. We

> munications, travel, finance, military matters and increasingly, culture.
> Of course, this expansion of loyalties is not intended “to stifle the flame
> of a sane and intelligent patriotism in men’s hearts”(WOB 41) but an
“intelligent patriotism” means precisely that we can recognize that the

> long-term best interests of our own country are in self-restraint and
> cooperation for the good of the whole global community.

The cumulative importance of these differences between Kant’s
“Perpetual Peace” and the Bahá’í vision of a global federalism is

> that the Bahá’í vision seeks to remedy the underlying conditions
> that make war possible whereas Kant’s proposals for the most part

seek remedies at the political or diplomatic level. Consequently,
his proposals are primarily superstructural in nature and do little
to remedy the underlying causes that are pre-conditions for war.
Among these are international anarchy, i.e. too much national
independence or diplomatic and economic autarchy; racism, reli-
gious fanaticism, “militant nationalism;” class warfare ideology,
and extremes of wealth and poverty. “Perpetual Peace” has little if
anything to say about these.

The diplomatic or political nature of Kant’s proposals is evident even
from a cursory examination. For example, the first, “No treaty of
peace that tacitly reserves issue for a future war shall be held valid”
(Kant 1983, 107) is something that only rulers or governments can
decide among themselves. What is or is not valid in international
affairs is a matter of political convention. The same can be said
regarding the rule that “The rights of nations shall be based on a
federation of free states.” (ibid 115) Who else but rulers or govern-
ments could agree to or sign such an accord? It is strictly an issue
of government-to-government negotiation and ratification. Here are
other ‘articles’ of Kant’s “Perpetual Peace” that are largely matters of
diplomatic convention:
1.   No nation at war… shall permit such acts of war as shall

> make mutual trust impossible during some future time.

[Assassinations, instigation of treason etc.] (ibid 110)
2.   No independent nation be it large or small may be

> acquired by another nation by inheritance, exchange,
> purchase or gift. (ibid 108)
3.   No national debt shall be contracted in connection with

the foreign affairs of the nation. (ibid 109)
4.   No nation shall forcibly interfere with the constitution

and government of another. (ibid)
5.   Standing armies (miles perpetuus) shall be gradually

abolished. (ibid 108)

The decision to establish and abide by each of these articles or conven-
tions lies entirely in the hands of a nation’s political and diplomatic
leadership. Who else would have the authority to agree to and institute
any of them? Who else could be responsible for maintaining them?
Who else but leaders and diplomats could amend, abrogate or coun-
teract them on the international scene? Of course, the Bahá’í vision
of a new world order also includes political measures but it focuses
equally if not more on establishing the necessary pre-conditions for
an enduring peace.

Reasonable and workable as they are, Kant’s proposals implicitly
assume that if nations and rulers agree to these provisions, there
shall be universal peace, i.e. that political will or fiat are sufficient to
create and maintain peace perpetually. There are at least two serious
difficulties with Kant’s assumption. The first is the “ force majeure”
problem, i.e. external forces compel actions that a ruler does not
wish to take.21 Such actions may include violations of the “league
of peace.” Common examples throughout history are natural disas-
ters such as prolonged unseasonable weather, disease and famine or
unfortunate conjunctions of events (“perfect storms”) like precipi-
tous plunges in economic fortunes. If, for example, a ruler’s people
are facing starvation and a neighboring ruler has a vast surplus he
will not share, the first ruler may not have much choice about going
to war to get food to get territory where food can be produced. This
violates at least one of Kant’s rules, i.e. not acquiring territory by
conquest. The ruler may not want to do so this but the people may
demand it regardless of what treaties have been signed. Political will
or fiat is simply inadequate to keep the peace in such cases. As we
shall see later, the Lesser Peace and the Most Great Peace outlined
in the Bahá’í Writings have ways of solving these difficulties. World
War I is another example of the “force majeure” problem. The bal-
ance of power politics was supposed to prevent WW I yet leaders
quickly lost control of a seemingly unstoppable cascade of unfore-
seen events. Again we see that diplomatic means and political will

may be sufficient to establish peace but they are not always sufficient
to maintain it especially in times of crisis.

The second weakness in Kant’s reliance on diplomatic means is the
“bad apple” problem. The inevitable succession of monarchs or changes

> in republican politics make it doubtful that political fiat alone can
> maintain peace perpetually because sooner or later there will arise one
> or a number of leaders who manipulate political, economic and social

> which renounced war “as an instrument of national policy,”22 it was
> three signatories—Japan, Italy and Germany—which manipulated
> and/or violated diplomacy to bring about war. Again, this shows the
> limitations of purely political measures to establish and keep peace.

> below how the Bahá’í vision deals with this problem.

> It is, therefore, clear that Kant’s diplomatic proposals are incapable of
> maintaining peace because they do not address the underlying con-
> ditions that make war possible and, indeed, likely. However, Kant
> does appear to recognize the importance of underlying conditions for
> peace in one important—albeit political—respect. In the first place,
> he believes in a constitutional state, one in which the exercise of power
> is limited by law so that the will of an individual does not become
> the supreme power. To have “domestic legitimacy,”23 a state must
“cohere with the concept of right” (Kant 1983, 115) within countries.

> Without this coherence with right, a state becomes despotic and
> despotism facilitates war. In conjunction with this requirement for
“domestic legitimacy,” Kant stipulates that the “civil constitution of

> every nation should be republican” (ibid 112) by which he means it
> should have a division between the executive and legislative branches
> of government. (ibid 114) Republicanism also ensures the translation
> of the public will into political action, a development that he believes
“provides for this desirable result, namely, perpetual peace.” (ibid 113)

According to Kant, in a republic, war requires the “consent of the
citizenry” (ibid) and, therefore, will also require the citizens to make
great sacrifice of materiel and lives, often themselves or their children.
Except for self-defense, citizens are rarely inclined to go to war. More-
over, since in a representative government rulers “take[] hold of the
public will and treat it as their own private will” (ibid 114) the public
will is translated into political action and war will, thereby, avoided.

The foregoing explanation shows that even when Kant discusses a
nation’s internal conditions for peace, he focuses on the political
aspects of national life, i.e. on legitimacy, power, representation,
leadership and so on. This is not to suggest that these matters
are unimportant but as the far more comprehensive Bahá’í vision
shows, while they are necessary they are not nearly sufficient to
achieve the abolition of war. From a Bahá’í perspective, this makes
Kant’s proposals deficient.

> Furthermore, Kant’s proposals are clearly associated with the con-
> cept of ‘negative peace,’ i.e. focusing on the actual fighting, either
> preventing it or stopping it once it starts. In this approach, peace is
> simply the absence of actual fighting. 24 Negative peace only addresses
“overt, direct violence but largely ignores those social inequalities…

> [or] ‘structural violence’ from which overt violence often springs.”25

We shall examine below what the Bahá’í Writings have to say about
‘positive peace” and the creation of conditions that facilitate peace,

> but for now it is important to note that the Writings also concern
> themselves with ‘negative peace’ i.e. the prevention or stopping of
> actual combat:

> Should any king take up arms against another, all should unitedly
> arise and prevent him. If this be done, the nations of the world will
> no longer require any armaments, except for the purpose of pre-
> serving the security of their realms and of maintaining internal

> order within their territories. This will ensure the peace and
> composure of every people, government and nation (GWB 249)

Clearly, Bahá’u’lláh is aware of the necessity of preventing aggression
which means that action must take place before the aggression starts.
In other words, He recommends pre-emption, a controversial issue
even in our age with a United Nations to oversee collective security.
Nothing in “Perpetual Peace” suggests that the principle of pre-emp-
tion fits into its framework. On the other hand, Bahá’u’lláh explicitly
mandates pre-emption, He says “all should unitedly arise and prevent
him” i.e. He speaks in the imperative; pre-emption is a duty for lead-
ers. This is vitally important in facilitating peace. If nations can be
sure that potential aggressors will be prevented from gathering arms
and attacking, then they can meet their security needs even while
keeping armaments at a minimum. This, in turn, reduces military
tension among states, i.e. “ensure peace and composure,” and allows
other, peaceful methods of problem solving to do their work.

However, Bahá’u’lláh’s injunctions go beyond the principle of pre-
emption. In His Tablet to Queen Victoria he says, “Should any one
among you take up arms against another, rise ye all against him, for this is
naught but manifest justice.” (WOB 40, 192) Again, it is important to
notice the imperative mode of this statement. This is not a matter of
choice, of political preference or even of popular will. It is an unquali-
fied duty and this duty is identified with “ justice.” Modern history
justifies Bahá’u’lláh’s strictness in this regard. The events leading to
WW II show the results of not following Bahá’u’lláh’s commands:
Japanese aggression in China in 1935; Fascist Italy’s attacks on Ethio-
pia starting in 1934; and Nazi Germany’s march into the Rhineland
in 1936 are all significant preludes to the global conflict of WW II.
Nor should we carry out Bahá’u’lláh’s command in a half-hearted
or sporadic fashion; doing so simply opens the door to aggression as
various nations ‘try their luck’ in avoiding counteraction.

4: Peace-Building

Let us now turn our attention to positive peace-building. In its
broadest terms, peace-building involves establishing the politi-
cal, social, cultural, economic and spiritual conditions that make
possible an enduring peace. The concept of peace-building is based
on the conclusion that “[t]raditional methods of diplomacy have
proved ineffective in preventing and resolving… hostilities.”26 This
is not to say that diplomacy is unnecessary, but only that without
the foundations for a lasting peace, diplomacy is not sufficient to
prevent wars from erupting. While diplomats can make peace,
they are unable to maintain it without establishing conditions that
make peace a more advantageous option than war. Peace-building
assumes that if the right conditions exist within and among states,
there is little if any chance of war occurring because there will
always be more political, social, cultural, economic spiritual and
even military factors against war than for it.

Kant’s “Perpetual Peace” really has only one proposal in regards to
peace-building i.e. that all states must be representative and republi-
can. (What that means precisely we shall examine in a moment.) This
proposal makes “Perpetual Peace” one of the first examples of what is
now known as “democratic peace theory”27 according to which citizens
of democratic states do not go to war, at least not against other demo-
cratic states. In this view, “the spread of legitimate domestic political
orders would eventually bring an end to international conflict.”28 Peace
is “fundamentally a question of establishing legitimate domestic orders
throughout the world.”29 Kant would agree for which reason he insists
that the “civil constitution of every nation should be republican.” (Kant
1983, 112) Constitutional republican states are not much inclined to go
to war because the traumas of war are not borne only by professional
armies but also by the general population. The vast majority of people
are generally adverse to such ordeals, though, of course, defensive war
may be the exception. Consequently, according to Kant, if all nations

were republics as he prescribes, then war will be eliminated. However,
Kant’s assent to “democratic peace theory” is qualified because he does
not think being republican by itself is not enough assure peace. That
is why he proposes the “league of peace.” Republicanism is part of the
solution but not all of it. On this he is in agreement with the Bahá’í
Writings.

It should be noted that we must be careful not to interpret Kant’s
republicanism as identical to democracy. Universal suffrage, a sine
qua non for modern democracy is not even mentioned in “Perpetual
Peace”; indeed, Kant is “no champion of democratic government”30
in its modern form. He associates democracy as we understand it
with “despotism” (ibid 114) because majority rule—‘the tyranny of
the majority’—threatens individual freedom. As we have seen before,
Kant’s republicanism only requires representative governments in
which the executive and legislative branches are separate. The repre-
sentation need not come from popularly elected representatives.

The Bahá’í Writings agree with Kant that representative govern-
ment is, in the last analysis, the only legitimate form of governance.
However, the Writings differ markedly from Kant in defining
what constitutes a legitimate government. Unlike Kant, they show
preference for popular democracy. Bahá'u'lláh states that although “a
republican form of government profiteth all the peoples of the world,” (TB
28) He prefers constitutional monarchy which combines democratic
representative government with monarchy. He writes,

> The system of government which the British people have adopted
> in London appeareth to be good, for it is adorned with the light
> of both kingship and of the consultation of the people. (TB 93)

The British parliamentary system is, of course, a form of democratic
representative government in which the representatives are elected by
popular vote. At the same time, Britain is a constitutional monarchy,

i.e. a popularly elected democratic government with a monarch who
is the head of state but does not rule. Actual executive power rests
with a prime minister who, as head of the government, rules in the
name of the monarch who is the titular head of state and has largely
ceremonial functions.

`Abdu’l-Bahá clearly supports democratic i.e. free and consultative

forms of government:

> Consider what a vast difference exists between modern democ-
> racy and the old forms of despotism. Under an autocratic
> government the opinions of men are not free, and development
> is stifled, whereas in democracy, because thought and speech are
> not restricted, the greatest progress is witnessed. It is likewise
> true in the world of religion. When freedom of conscience, liberty
> of thought and right of speech prevail—that is to say, when every
> man according to his own idealization may give expression to
> his beliefs—development and growth are inevitable. (PUP 197

emphasis added)

`Abdu’l-Bahá portrays “modern democracy” positively and associates

> it with “the greatest progress.” The “old forms of despotism,” whether
> secular or religious, hinder progress and development by stifling free
> thought and expression. `Abdu’l-Bahá stresses the importance of
> freedom elsewhere too. He makes freedom the third of the ‘seven
> candles of unity’ and, in his introduction to the seven candles, indi-
> vidual freedom is the underlying condition which makes peace and
> unity possible. (SWAB 31) For example, he mentions the freedom
> to travel and communicate, to associate without hindrance, and to
> exchange viewpoints and beliefs. Because of these freedoms and the
> interdependence they encourage, “the unity of all mankind can in this
> day be achieved.” (PUP 197) Here, too, we observe how closely freedom,
> democracy and progress are connected in the Bahá’í world-view. The
> Bahá’í International Community makes a similar point, stating that

democracy is among the chief characteristics that ensures human
progress.31 Indeed, grassroots democracy is an integral part of the
Bahá’í Faith’s internal structure as seen for example in the Feast
which “combines religious worship with grassroots governance and
social development.”32 Thus, the Feast is an arena of democracy at
the very root of society"33 and in that sense, of the Bahá’í social order.

However, in reflecting on the subject of democracy it is important to
keep in mind Shoghi Effendi’s statement that

> No form of democratic government; no system of autocracy
> or of dictatorship, whether monarchical or republican; no
> intermediary scheme of a purely aristocratic order; nor even
> any of the recognized types of theocracy… none of these can
> be identified or be said to conform with the Administrative
> Order which the master-hand of its perfect Architect has
> fashioned… It blends and harmonizes, as no government
> fashioned by mortal hands has as yet accomplished, the
> salutary truths which each of these systems undoubtedly
> contains without vitiating the integrity of those God-given
> verities on which it is ultimately founded. (WOB 152)

> The future Bahá’í Administrative Order will incorporate the posi-
> tive aspects of the various forms of government without “introducing
> within its machinery any of the objectionable features which they
> inherently possess.” (ibid) Indeed, Shoghi Effendi explicitly states
> that “The Administrative Order of the Faith of Bahá’u’lláh must in
> no wise be regarded as purely democratic in character” (ibid) because
“democracies depend fundamentally upon getting their mandate from

> the people.”. (ibid) Shoghi Effendi’s words strongly suggest that democ-
> racy, while invaluable in the progress of human development, is not
> the end-station in regards to humankind’s socio-political evolution.

The Writings also associate progress and peace. `Abdu’l-Bahá says:

> God has chosen you for the purpose of investigating reality and
> promulgating international peace; God has chosen you for the
> progress and development of humanity (PUP 434).

Elsewhere he says,

> Bigotry and dogmatic adherence to ancient beliefs have become
> the central and fundamental source of animosity among men,
> the obstacle to human progress, the cause of warfare and strife,
> the destroyer of peace, composure and welfare in the world.

(PUP 439)

The reason for associating progress and peace is clear: unless people
today progress beyond the “old order” (PB ix) and its restricted
beliefs, attitudes, world-view and ways of thinking and acting, we
shall be stuck with its political, religious, cultural and economic
hostilities. If we cannot move beyond the “old order” we shall be
trapped within it and its constantly erupting wars as we have been
in the 20th Century. This, in turn, undermines all other positive
human developments or progress.

The foregoing argument makes it clear that “Perpetual Peace” and
the Bahá’í Writings converge on an “inside-out”34 approach to
international relation insofar as they both link the internal, politi-
cal constitution of a state to its external relations. Each sees the
establishment of representative and republican government as con-
ducive to peace, although the Writings differ from Kant inasmuch as
they require democratic representative government. Both also agree
that representative government, while necessary, is not sufficient to
guarantee peace which is why Kant proposes a “league of peace” and
the Bahá’í Writings some form of a global tribunal.

However, unlike Kant, the Bahá’í Writings outline various vital
peace-building measures necessary to ensuring peace in the phase of
the Lesser Peace and its fruition in the Most Great Peace. In our view,
the most fundamental teaching to eliminate conflict is recognizing the
essential unity of humankind. Without a deep commitment to this
idea, i.e. a commitment so strong it will over-ride cultural, national,
ethnic, class, economic, religious and political barriers, there is no
realistic hope of establishing a durable peace. We must learn to make
loyalty to humanity our prime—though not only loyalty—and to
realize that the best way to serve our own nation or sub-group is by
serving the good of the humankind as a whole. As long as we fail to
shift our primary loyalty to humanity we will continue to be divided
along lines that sooner or later fracture into hostilities. The reason
why is clear: a primary loyalty to humankind limits the influence of
narrower national, ethnic, religious or other interests on our world-
view and decision-making. Or, to put it in pragmatic terms, until the
good of all as opposed to the good of some becomes the primary goal
of global action, we cannot rationally expect to achieve and maintain
peace. Anything less inevitably pits some against others and re-creates
situations that undermine peace and facilitate war. Moreover, until
human beings inwardly identify themselves with all other humans,
i.e. until our identity as humans trumps all other identities, we can-
not create a mental and spiritual condition that is prepared to make
the sacrifices necessary for global peace. To use a sports expression,
everyone must be willing to “take one for the team.” In support of
this psycho-spiritual condition, the Writings frequently mention the
importance of sacrifice. (PUP 130) As Bahá'u'lláh says, “Let not a man
glory in this, that he loves his country; let him rather glory in this, that he
loves his kind… ” (PB viii) Such a shift in our scale of loyalties is an
absolute sine qua non for the elimination of war.

To support the contention that realizing the oneness of humankind
is essential to peace, the Bahá’í Writings provide two ways in which

humankind is essentially one. The first of these is the universal pos-
session of a “rational soul.” (SAQ 208)

> The human spirit which distinguishes man from the animal is
> the rational soul, and these two names—the human spirit and
> the rational soul—designate one thing. This spirit, which in the
> terminology of the philosophers is the rational soul, embraces
> all beings, and as far as human ability permits discovers the
> realities of things. (SAQ 208)

This may be understood from a secular and spiritual perspective.
From a perspective of secular philosophical anthropology, this
statement asserts that rationality is the distinguishing feature of
all human beings. Regardless of culture, historical time or circum-
stances, all humans possess the power of rational thought which
allows them to discover the truth about reality and reason abstractly.
(SAQ 187–188) Even a cursory glance at human achievement shows
that humans possess rationality to such an overwhelming extent that
we are, in effect, different in kind from animals. In other words, there
is a uniquely characterized human nature that we all share 35—and
this human nature is one of the foundation stones of human unity. Of
course, this single human nature with its countless potentials can be
expressed in different ways in different times and circumstances. But
in the last analysis, it is always a clearly recognizable human expres-
sion. The oneness of humankind is also observable at the physical
level; humans share a fundamentally identical physiology so that doc-
tors trained in one part of the world can practice medicine in another.
There are some physiological differences but these are accidentals
adhering to an essential or universal identity.

Furthermore, it is possible to take a spiritual perspective on the con-
cept of the rational soul. The rational soul is the basis for our spiritual
lives since it sets us free from an animal captivity to the senses and
allows us to reason not only about physical, natural phenomena but

also about non-physical beings like God, gods and ultimate powers,
as well as revelation, the soul, Manifestations and spirituality in
general. Consequently, the universality of religion and the efforts
to understand and explain non-physical reality provides additional
evidence for the universality of human nature and the rational soul.

> The Writings also offer a purely spiritual reason for accepting the
> oneness of humanity: we are all the creations or children of God.
`Abdu'l-Bahá says, “Look upon the whole human race as members of one

> family, all children of God; and, in so doing, you will see no difference
> between them.” (PT 170) Elsewhere he states,

> each individual member of the human family is a leaf or branch
> upon the Adamic tree; that all are sheltered beneath the pro-
> tecting mercy and providence of God; that all are the children
> of God, fruit upon the one tree of His love. God is equally
> compassionate and kind to all the leaves, branches and fruit of
> this tree. Therefore, there is no satanic tree whatever—Satan
> being a product of human minds and of instinctive human
> tendencies toward error. (PUP 230)

And again,

> therefore must all souls become as one soul, and all hearts as one
> heart. Let all be set free from the multiple identities that were
> born of passion and desire, and in the oneness of their love for
> God find a new way of life. (SWAB 76)

Our ‘humanity’ must be our only over-arching identity, which, while
including others, has priority over them. However, we are not to lose
our identities: rather, we are to become “as” one soul and “as” one heart,”
i.e. distinct but harmonized by one supreme identity. The mandate
of Bahá’u’lláh’s revelation is to let this essential oneness of human-
kind achieve outward expression in the lives of individuals, societies

and the world in general. We should cease indulging in a fetishism
of artificial, man-made barriers, and seek ways to make differences
work together, or, if necessary, rid ourselves of them altogether. As
Bahá’u’lláh says, “He Who is your Lord, the All-Merciful, cherisheth in
His heart the desire of beholding the entire human race as one soul and
one body.” (GWB 213 emphasis added) He also says,

> If any man were to meditate on that which the Scriptures, sent
> down from the heaven of God’s holy Will, have revealed, he
> would readily recognize that their purpose is that all men shall
> be regarded as one soul, so that the seal bearing the words “The
> Kingdom shall be God’s” may be stamped on every heart (GWB
> 259 emphasis added).

In our interpretation, the injunction to regard each other as “one soul
and one body” means that we must work together, cooperatively, as
the human body and soul work together to engender a unified living
being. Consequently, we must set aside all accidental differences that
hinder laboring together on the common project of building peace.
(Diversities that do not prevent us from working together are a differ-
ent matter.) In other words, we must work organically, with each part
in its own way supporting every other part. Applied to the planet as
a whole, this means that we must not only be unified physically or by
material means but also spiritually, as in “one common faith.” (SAQ 65)

These statements from the Writings make it clear that the oneness of
humankind must be transformed form a fine sentiment for ceremo-
nial occasions into a robust, universally applied principle that informs
thoughts, feelings and actions both in individuals and collectives. For
peace to be enduring instead of temporary, we must cease to think,
feel and act as if race, religion, nationality or class constituted essen-
tial differences among humans instead of being mere accidentals.

Another key principle of peace-building is the elimination of the
extremes of wealth and poverty. `Abdu’l-Bahá states, “The fourth
principle or teaching of Bahá’u’lláh is the readjustment and equalization
of the economic standards of mankind.” (PUP 107) Kant’s “Perpetual
Peace” says nothing about this vital topic or even about economic
reform in general as a necessary part of building an enduring peace.
For that reason alone, belief that his proposals are sufficient to
establish a permanent peace is not justified. The “maldistribution
of wealth”36 inevitably undermines both domestic and international
stability and unity (COL 25) especially in an age when global

communications make it impossible to hide the enormous dispari-
ties in wealth. This sets the stage for war.

> This readjustment of the social economy is of the greatest
> importance inasmuch as it ensures the stability of the world of
> humanity; and until it is effected, happiness and prosperity
> are impossible.( PUP 181 emphasis added)

When, for example, a small portion of the world’s people use up half
or more of the world’s resources, we would be foolish to expect a
lasting peace. The immense suffering and consequent anger caused
by such gross inequalities undermines peace in two ways. First, it
destabilizes countries internally as various groups scramble for what
little wealth is left and/or violent revolutions erupt and second, it
destabilizes international relations as internal conflicts affect sur-
rounding nations and political opportunism exacerbates problem
through foreign involvement. Even a cursory glace at the history of
the 20th century reveals how all of these scenarios can unfold and
unbalance large portions of the world.

While the Bahá’í Writings recognize that reasonable economic and
social differences are based on natural variations of ability and tem-
perament, they also teach that these variations do not justify exces-
sive disparities of income. Shoghi Effendi sums up the Bahá’í position
by saying, “Extremes of wealth and poverty should… be abolished.”
(DG 20) Sympathy for the less fortunate is one reason: “Is it possible
that, seeing one of his fellow-creatures starving, destitute of everything, a
man can rest and live comfortably in his luxurious mansion?” (SAQ 276)
However, `Abdu’l-Bahá gives another reason:

> [e]very human being has the right to live; they have a right to
> rest, and to a certain amount of well-being. As a rich man is
> able to live in his palace surrounded by luxury and the greatest

> comfort, so should a poor man be able to have the necessaries of
> life. Nobody should die of hunger; everybody should have suf-
> ficient clothing; one man should not live in excess while another
> has no possible means of existence. (PT 131–132 emphasis
> added)

> It is important to notice the “rights” language, used by `Abdu’l-Bahá.
> This language implies that people have an innate and irrevocable
> claim to the basic “necessities of life” solely by virtue of being human.
> Conversely, this implies that society has at least some obligation to
> provide people the opportunity to attain their basic requirements.
> (Precisely how this is to be done, is, of course, a matter of intense
> debate and cannot be discussed here.) `Abdu’l-Bahá describes
> extreme disparity of wealth as “the height of iniquity” and adds that
“no just man can accept it.” (SAQ 273) By implication, no just society

can accept it either. The importance of this issue is emphasized by
`Abdu’l-Bahá’s insistence on economic justice for workers. In order to
“regulate the excessive fortunes of certain private individuals and meet the

needs of millions of the poor masses” (ibid)

> laws and regulations should be established which would permit
> the workmen to receive from the factory owner their wages and
> a share in the fourth or the fifth part of the profits, according
> to the capacity of the factory; or in some other way the body
> of workmen and the manufacturers should share equitably the
> profits and advantages. (ibid)

To counteract these injustices, `Abdu’l-Bahá establishes the principle
of wage and profit-sharing as a way of preventing an undue and exces-
sive concentration of wealth which exacerbates tensions and hostilities
within and among countries. He also teaches a just redistribution of
wealth must include provisions for old age as well as what we today
call a ‘progressive income tax’: “taxation will be proportionate to capacity
and production and there will be no poor in the community.” (FWU 37)

At this point, it is very important to issue a caveat that the Writings
must not be associated with communism in regards to income distri-
bution. `Abdu’ l-Bahá makes it clear that

> absolute equality is just as impossible, for absolute equality in
> fortunes, honors, commerce, agriculture, industry would end
> in disorderliness, in chaos, in disorganization of the means of
> existence, and in universal disappointment: the order of the
> community would be quite destroyed. (SAQ 273)

The unfortunate history of communism in Eastern Europe and
Russia proves the truth of `Abdu’l-Bahá’s warnings on this matter.
Thus, the Writings accept some differences in wealth as natural, but
do not accept that these differences should be allowed to emiserate
large portions of humankind. Moreover, the 20th century saw how
destabilizing gross maldistribution of wealth can be. For example,
though it eventually morphed into something else, the Russian Rev-
olution of 1917 was a reaction against the extreme concentrations
of wealth and the subsequent emiseration of much of humanity. Its
destabilizing effects were felt throughout the rest of the century. It
is simply unrealistic to expect an enduring peace within or among
nations without decisively remedying this underlying injustice
which distorts and destroys the lives of countless human beings.

> In addition to legal reforms, the Writings in addition to making vol-
> untary donations also offer another way to achieve the appropriate
> adjustment of wealth: the law of Huqúqu’ lláh. This law—which has
> many detailed provisions—provides a way of calculating a payment
> made of a percentage of one’s increase in wealth, beyond what is
> essentially needed, to a special Fund at the Universal House of Jus-
> tice for humanitarian services. The prime purpose of Huqúqu’ lláh is
“the elimination of extremes of wealth and poverty, and a more equitable

> distribution of resources.” (PUP 102) In other words, obeying this law
> is one way in which virtually everyone can contribute to the laying

the foundations of world peace. The law of Huqúqu’ lláh fosters
the spiritual maturity needed to make people voluntarily accept the
moderation of wealth, a new attitude that is itself a necessary part of
the economic foundations of a lasting peace. Unless people evolve to
find satisfaction and purpose in things other than the accumulation
of wealth, the innate competitiveness of material, economic pursuits
will continue to destabilize the intra-and-inter-national scene.

In the Bahá’í teachings, another necessary foundation stone for
establishing and maintaining an enduring peace is the essential
oneness of religion. Religion has always played an important role
in human existence and, therefore, must be included in any seri-
ous plan for changes in international relations. No other social
phenomenon in history has shown itself as potent in transforming
large numbers of people as religion, a fact which suggests that Kant’s
plan to establish a “perpetual peace” without religion simply ignores
human nature and is, thereby, unrealistic. Moreover, as `Abdu’
l-Bahá points out, “It has been the basis of all civilization and progress
in the history of mankind.” (PUP 361) Without including the potency
of religion, it is highly doubtful that rationally based political plans
for world peace will be successful.

> However, religions can only fulfill their role as an agent of perpetual
> peace if they cease to promote divisions among humankind and
> decide to work in unity on the basis of their essential principles which
> are identical. `Abdu’l-Bahá, sums up this position quite succinctly:
“Truth is one in all religions, and by means of it the unity of the world

> can be realized.” (PT 129) By ‘religion’ the Writings mean “the essen-
> tial foundation or reality of religion, not the dogmas and blind imitations
> which… are inevitably destructive.” (PUP 363) Because the “essence of
> all religions is the Love of God, and… is the foundation of all the sacred
> teachings,” (PT 82) religion, or at least, religion in its original intent,
> is necessary for an enduring peace. When religions return to their

essential truth, they, not man-made philosophical concepts, will unify
humanity Bahá’u’lláh declares,

> O ye children of men! The fundamental purpose animating the
> Faith of God and His Religion is to safeguard the interests and
> promote the unity of the human race, and to foster the spirit
> of love and fellowship amongst men. (GWB 215 emphasis
> added)

In a similar vein, `Abdu’l-Bahá states, “The central purpose of the divine
religions is the establishment of peace and unity among mankind.” (PUP
98) “[U]nity is the essential truth of religion.” (PUP 32)

The need for religion as a ‘partner for peace’ illustrates the need for a
unifying world-view, or, as `Abdu’l-Bahá states it, the need for “unity
of thought in world undertakings.” (SWAB 32) If we are to have genuine
peace, we must have effective cooperation, and effective cooperation
requires a common framework of thought and action, i.e. a common
world-view. This common world-view provides, among other things,
the ultimate purpose for which we act; the allowable means by which
we may act to achieve those goals; the terms in which to analyze and
evaluate situations; the guidelines for planning, prioritizing and
coordinating action. Furthermore, if different nations and/or cul-
tures are to work together effectively, they need a set of “core values…
which are sought to be maintained.”37 Without such a set of “core
values” participants will have neither goals to aspire to nor standards
by which to judge their efforts; in effect, they would be ‘flying blind.’
These values also provide the moral legitimacy to enlist popular sup-
port. In addition, they provide the “unity of conscience”38 needed
to motivate people intellectually, emotionally and spiritually, i.e. to
awaken and energize the complete human being. Without all these
advantages provided by a coherent world-view, our efforts to achieve
peace will be half-efforts at best and counter-productive at worst.

> the essential oneness of all religions. This is a major short-coming
> that the Bahá’í Writings remedy. However, Kant does recognize the
> need for a unifying world-view or framework of thought to establish

> bend its knee before morality” (Kant 1983, 131) or “the right” (ibid
> 128) by which he means that politics must be guided by morality or
‘the right’ and not by expedience or any consideration of results. This

holds true both for individuals and nations.

‘Right’ applies to all human activities, including politics because the

> sequently, he is able to say, “The rights of men must be held sacred,
> however great the cost of sacrifice may be to those in power.” (ibid

> For Kant, ‘right’ itself derives “from the ought, whose principle
> is given a priori through pure reason” (ibid 134) which means that
‘ought’ and ‘right’ are determined by reason alone and not by expedi-

> ency, prudence, desirability or consideration of consequences. ‘Ought’
> and ‘right’ have an “unconditioned necessity,” (ibid 132) i.e. the ‘ought’
> and its resulting ‘right’ are applicable regardless of results or wishes.

Kant approvingly quotes the dictum, “Let justice reign, even if all the

rogues in the world should perish.” (ibid 133) Summing up his ideas,
he says, “Seek first the kingdom of pure practical reason and its righ-
teousness and your end [Zweck] (the blessing of perpetual peace) will
come to you of itself.” (ibid)

More specifically, actions are ‘right’ if they conform to the categorical
imperative (CI) which for Kant has uncontested universal validity.
Kant does not specifically explicate the CI in “Perpetual Peace” but
make use of it in his arguments as shall see. In its first form, the CI
states, “Act as if the maxim of your action were to become through
your will a universal law of nature.”39 In other words, if we do some-
thing we should agree that everyone else should do the same thing
in the same circumstances. For example, if we choose to act on the
principle of ‘destroy your enemies,’ we would soon realize that every-
one—ourselves included—would eventually be destroyed because
everyone is somebody’s enemy. The irrational, suicidal nature of the
act is immediately clear. Analogous results follow if we apply Kant’s
CI to lying, stealing, cheating or being lazy, to name only a few.
Social existence would quickly become unworkable. “Perpetual Peace”
applies the first form of the CI to nations, which, he says do not have
the right to go to war

> because it is then a law of deciding what is right by unilateral
> maxims through force and not by universally valid public
> laws which restrict the freedom of everyone. 40

Even states must behave in such a way that its acts may become uni-
versal law instead of being arbitrary and special-pleading. The latter
is a logical fallacy and inimical to Kant’s rationalism.

The other form of the CI asserts that we should always treat all humans
as if they were ends-in-themselves and never as means to serve the
purpose of another’s will.41 In “Perpetual Peace” Kant refers to this
form of the CI in his objection to standing armies, i.e. paying men

to kill or be killed is to “use them as mere machines and tools in the
hands of another.” (Kant 1983, 108) It violates their right to be ends-
in-themselves. (The whole modern theory of human rights grows out
of this aspect of Kant’s work.) If we treat others as ‘means’ to satisfy
our will, then others are logically entitled to treat us as ‘means’ too—a
situation which rapidly makes personal and collective life unworkable.
Special pleading or making ourselves an exception from either form
of the categorical imperative traps us in a logical inconsistency, i.e. in
irrationality, which violates our nature as rational beings.

Both Kant and the Bahá’í Writings endorse treating human being
as end-in-themselves and not merely as a means or tool to be used to
the advantage of another. The Writings state this in two ways. The
first is through the teaching that we must love all human beings; to
love another person is to value him in-himself, to see him as an end-
in-himself, as a ‘Thou.’ There is no meaningful sense of separation or
limitation to such love. 42 Of course, the Bahá’í Writings express this
in a theological form as in the following:

> Like the sun, let them [“the loved ones of the Lord”] cast their
> rays upon garden and rubbish heap alike, and even as clouds
> in spring, let them shed down their rain upon flower and thorn.

(SAQ 257)

Another way of stating that all humans are ends-in-themselves is to
say we are made in the image of God and that “Inasmuch as all were
created in the image of God, we must bring ourselves to realize that all
embody divine possibilities.” (PUP 113) Consequently, all persons are
valuable in-themselves as unique, distinctive and irreplaceable images
of the divine and must be treated as ends-in-themselves. Because they
recognize that everyone is an end-in-himself, the Writings implicitly
acknowledge that the rules of behaviour we apply to ourselves must
be applicable by all insofar as we are all equally images of God. This
agrees with the first form of the categorical imperative.

5 Why Religion and not “Reason Alone”?

The foregoing discussion leads to an important question vis-à-vis
Bahá’u’lláh’s and Kant’s plans for world peace: Why choose religion
over philosophy as a unifying world-view? Or, to put it another way,
what does religion to offer the quest for world peace that philosophy
lacks? To answer these and related questions, it is necessary to exam-
ine Kant’s proposal in the light of recent history.

According to Kant and the Bahá’í Writings, humans are essentially
rational by nature. In other words, rational behavior and thought
is more appropriate to our essential nature than irrational behavior
though although we still have free will to act irrationally. Again, this
is not specifically explicated in “Perpetual Peace” but underlies its
arguments. That is why Kant says, for example, that we look down
on those who prefer a senseless and lawless, “mad freedom to a ratio-
nal one,” (Kant 1983, 115) which restrains “the depravity of human
nature.” (ibid 116) The Bahá’í Writings assert that “[t]he human spirit
which distinguishes man from the animal is the rational soul, and these
two names—the human spirit and the rational soul—designate one thing.”
(SAQ 208) What Kant calls the “depravity of human nature,” they
refer to as our “animal nature” (PUP 41) which we must overcome in
order to live up to our distinctly human and rational potentials. Of
course, we must recall that in the Writings, the rational soul requires
the assistance of “the spirit of faith” (SAQ 208) in order to “become
acquainted with the divine secrets and heavenly realities.” (ibid) Conse-
quently reason is not fully independent in regards to ethical teachings
which are ultimately grounded in a transcendental God. Reason may
prove the validity of these teachings, but proof alone is not authority
of which God is the ultimate source. Kant does not recognize any
need for such assistance because he denies that we can ever know the
transcendental, noumenal or “heavenly realities.”

Given the historical record, it is difficult to avoid the conclusion that
while rationality is necessary to peace-building, it is by no means suf-
ficient. What is needed is something that can motivate humans to
want to apply reason, to want to be rationally consistent and to want
to value themselves and others. “Perpetual Peace” explains how reason
can help us do these things in political action but it does not provide
a motivation to actively desire to do them, especially when it is to our
advantage to ignore them. What can fill this gap?

What is needed is not a purely intellectual idea but rather, an
existential attitude or stance towards humankind, the world, the
Not-me, the stranger, the ‘Other.’. It must be something that does
not rely only on calculative reasoning about gain and loss, ‘mine and

> thine’ or ‘friend and foe.’ It must also not simply be rational but trans-
> rational, i.e. not just an idea but an idea with personal and collective
> transformative power. In other words, it cannot only be objective but
> must have a subjective aspect as well so that it really touches people’s
> hearts because ideas that do not touch the heart, no matter how well
> conceived they may be, can atrophy all too easily. There must not only
> be a new world-view, but there must also be a new world-feeling, a
> deep, personal and subjective sense of connection to all peoples and
> a commitment to their future together. Purely intellectual agree-
> ment is not enough to bring about a new way of being-in-the-world.

`Abdu’l-Bahá makes this clear when he says,

> the Holy Spirit unites nations and removes the cause of war-
> fare and strife. It transforms mankind into one great family
> and establishes the foundations of the oneness of humanity. It
> promulgates the spirit of international agreement and insures
> universal peace. (FWU 85)

His reference to the family taps one of the strongest and deepest
subjective experiences of love known to humankind. Applying
these feelings to humanity would go a long way in establishing
genuine peace.

The lack of such a trans-rational and transformative element in “Per-
petual Peace” is only one of the decisive differences between Kant and
the Writings. Unlike the Bahá’í Writings, Kant does not consider
this topic at all, apparently believing that political and diplomatic
action within the current framework is sufficient to reach his goal.
He neglects the need for personal and intellectual transformation in
both populations whose views must be represented and in diplomats
and politicians who must craft and carry out agreements. After all,
both these groups have had their thinking and feeling shaped by the
competitive Westphalian nation-state system with its emphasis on
absolute national sovereignty. Perhaps his proposals lay the objective

foundations for peace but overlook the equally necessary subjective
pre-conditions for peace.

According to the Bahá’í Writings, the motivation to adopt the way of
being-in-the-world needed to establish and maintain a lasting peace,
must come from love. As Bahá’u’lláh says, “Let not a man glory in this,
that he loves his country; let him rather glory in this, that he loves his
kind… ” (PB viii) `Abdu’l-Bahá explains why this is so:

> God alone is Creator, and all are creatures of His might.
> Therefore, we must love mankind as His creatures, realizing
> that all are growing upon the tree of His mercy, servants of
> His omnipotent will and manifestations of His good pleasure.

(PUP 230)

Elsewhere he says,

> My admonition and exhortation to you is this: Be kind to all
> people, love humanity, consider all mankind as your relations
> and servants of the most high God… God has created all, and
> all return to God. Therefore, love humanity with all your heart
> and soul. (PUP 290–291)

Bahá’u’lláh identifies the ultimate goal, saying, “He Who is your
Lord, the All-Merciful, cherisheth in His heart the desire of beholding the
entire human race as one soul and one body.” (GWB 214) This univer-
sal love is based on the fatherhood of God: “God is the Father of all”
(PUP 266) regardless of our worldly circumstances or spiritual state.
According to `Abdu’l-Bahá, “we are the servants of one God, that we
turn to one beneficent Father, live under one divine law, seek one reality
and have one desire.” (PUP 66) With an outlook of universal love, we
naturally approach others with goodwill, and desire to treat them as
ends-in-themselves instead of means, and want such treatment to be
the universal standard of behavior. `Abdu’l-Bahá states,

> The third virtue of humanity is the goodwill which is the basis
> of good actions. Certain philosophers have considered intention
> superior to action, for the goodwill is absolute light; it is purified
> and sanctified from the impurities of selfishness, of enmity, of
> deception. Now it may be that a man performs an action which
> in appearance is righteous, but which is dictated by covetous-
> ness… But the goodwill is sanctified from such impurities.

(SAQ 301 emphasis added)

With universal goodwill as a foundation for their actions, humans are
inwardly transformed so that humans will choose to act rightly not
from a sense of duty or fear or logical consistency but from an inner
want to do the right thing, a want to apply the categorical imperative
to their dealings with others. With goodwill, each person chooses to
be his ‘brother’s keeper,’ and has a sense of “ultimate concern” for the
well-being of others. Goodwill effects an inward character transfor-
mation that simply cannot be replaced by any outward regulations
no matter how detailed they are. When goodwill is the basis of diplo-
macy, problems like deception, secrecy and under-handed methods—
all mentioned in “Perpetual Peace”—disappear not because of formal
treaties, concerns about logical consistency or notions of duty, but
because with goodwill, diplomats lack the desire to commit such
acts. Moreover, with goodwill, their peoples no longer expect them
to indulge in perfidy for the sake of the ‘national good.’

“perpetual peace,” Kant’s proposals are inadequate to their task.

It may be objected that the whole project of “Perpetual Peace” as well
as the second form of Kant’s categorical imperative, i.e. the injunction
of treating others as ends and not means already covers the issue
of goodwill. Indeed, Kant seems to give implicit recognition to the
importance of goodwill by enshrining rules against secret clauses
(Kant 1983, 107) and dishonest tactics. (ibid 109) One problem, of
course, is that a diplomat may sign any number of such protocols
without sincere goodwill. “A man may smile and smile and be a
villain.”43 Moreover, diplomatic and political means, while necessary
in establishing and maintaining a durable international peace, are
not sufficient to guarantee the required universal goodwill. Leaders
and governments, and with them, policies and attitudes, inevitably
change. The decisive fact is that Kant does not specifically identify
and develop goodwill or love as crucial components in “Perpetual
Peace”; he seems to think that the outer restraints provided by treaties,
agreements and purely rational agreements can create and maintain
peace without any character transformation.

Another issue is the problem of “the transcendent.”44 Put in its starkest
terms, the difficulty revolves around the question, ‘Can we achieve
perpetual peace by means of immanent reason alone?’ Immanent
reason rejects any suggestion of the transcendent, i.e. God, as a neces-
sary factor in the quest for peace and confines itself to the phenom-
enal realm. 45 However, if perpetual peace has no better and more
authoritative grounding than human reason, then sooner or later this
peace will be challenged by another idea. Perhaps a belief will arise
that war is good hygiene for the nation and species, that it rids us
of the weak and unfit and establishes the natural dominance of the
biological and intellectually stronger. If ideas have no other author-
ity than themselves, who is to say if this last alternative is wrong or
evil? All we can do is argue on the basis of yet another idea which
also has its authority only in itself. Thus, we are caught in an infinite
regress making a solution impossible—and this is a situation which
makes perpetual peace an unlikely prospect. If immanent reason is

insufficient to serve as a foundation of goodwill and peace, then we
are at least obliged to examine the alternatives.

According to `Abdu'l-Bahá, there is good evidence to reject immanent
reason as sufficient. Kant’s proposals operate within the framework
of what `Abdu'l-Bahá calls “material civilization” (PUP 11) which
pertains to scientific, technical, economic, government, law and so
on. However, as `Abdu’l-Bahá points out, and, as we have learned in
the 20th century, even a high degree of material civilization is no sure
bulwark against barbarism:

> Progress and barbarism go hand in hand, unless material civi-
> lization be confirmed by Divine Guidance, by the revelations
> of the All-Merciful and by godly virtues, and be reinforced by
> spiritual conduct… Therefore, this civilization and material
> progress should be combined with the Most Great Guidance
> (SWAB 284).

Elsewhere he adds,

> among the teachings of Bahá’u’lláh is that although material
> civilization is one of the means for the progress of the world of
> mankind, yet until it becomes combined with Divine civiliza-
> tion, the desired result, which is the felicity of mankind, will
> not be attained… These battleships that reduce a city… are the
> result of material civilization. (SWAB 303)

Immanent reason and its resulting material civilization are unable to
deliver peace to the world for the next phase of its evolution because
they cannot effect the inner transformation, i.e. the universal love
and goodwill, needed to bring about peace. Therefore, while neces-
sary, they are not sufficient to reach the goal of an enduring peace.

This conclusion leads to a new question: ‘What can religion pro-
vide that immanent reason cannot?’ Most obviously, religion can
provide the element of “the transcendent,” i.e. the belief, however
it is articulated, that there exists something beyond the limits of
human perception and ordinary human experience to which we can
and must develop a positive relationship. The universal presence of
belief in the transcendent throughout all known cultures from all
historical times and places, not to mention the strong resurgence
of religious faith after decades of systematic suppression in the
former Soviet Bloc provides irrefutable evidence that belief in the
transcendent is inherent in human nature. 46 Whether this faith is
intellectually sophisticated or not is irrelevant—the need it fulfills is
the same. The transcendent may be called God, gods, the Tao, Brah-
man, the One, the Unknowable or anything else but in each case it
exists beyond the limits of all phenomenal things and finite human
beings. Ideas grounded in “the transcendent,” i.e. ideas that ‘come
from God’ also seem to show a far greater transformative power than
ideas originating from men. `Abdu'l-Bahá confirms this when he says
that the influence of the greatest philosophers comes nowhere close
to the influence of the Manifestations Who are the Spokesmen for
the Transcendent. (PT 164, SAQ 14) The transcendent origin of
their teachings gives these ideas a legitimacy and authority that no
mere human ideas can ever have.

This leads to an interesting line of thought. Even if one does not
believe in the ontological reality of the transcendent, given the vast
power that belief in it clearly has, there are reasons to act as if it
really exists. Why not make use of this idea, since it will always be
a factor in human affairs? Indeed, Kant did something very like this
in The Critique of Practical Reason. Kant discusses “the existence of
God as a postulate of pure, practical reason.”47 According to Kant,
practical reason “must postulate the existence of God, as the neces-
sary condition of the possibility of the summum bonum (an object of
the will which is necessarily connected with the moral legislation of

pure reason).”48 Kant’s postulatory theism holds that although we
cannot prove God’s existence speculatively, i.e. by logical argument,
we must, nonetheless, postulate God’s existence as a purely practical
matter, i.e. as the basis of morals. How else can moral injunctions
gain legitimacy and final authority? God is needed because morality
is connected to achieving the greatest good (summum bonum) and it
is only God Who can make this highest good a matter of absolute
moral duty. As Creator of all, He alone has, or could have the ulti-
mate legitimacy and authority to do so. That is why “it is morally
necessary to assume the existence of God.”49 Consequently, on the
basis of Kant’s own work, we can assert that religion bestows a practi-
cal reason for basing the necessity of universal love and goodwill on
the existence of God.

However, Kant does not make use of this religious aspect of his
thought in “Perpetual Peace.” This is a major difference with the
Bahá’í Writings which, of course, completely reject the notion of a
mere “postulatory theism” and recognize God’s ontological reality,
even from a strictly logical standpoint. `Abdu’l-Bahá says,

> The existence of the Divine Being hath been clearly established,
> on the basis of logical proofs, but the reality of the Godhead is
> beyond the grasp of the mind. (SWAB 46)

The “Godhead” is unknowable, but the logical necessity for such a
‘Being’ can be known by man within the limits of human experience

> and reason. From the foregoing discussion, we may conclude that a
> religious approach to establishing and maintaining world peace is
> more likely to succeed than a purely rational approach such as taken
> by Kant.

6 The Guarantor Question

Any discussion of world peace inevitably raises the question ‘How can
we be sure this is not just a pipe-dream?’ Kant shows his awareness of
this question when he writes,

> Perpetual peace is insured (guaranteed) by nothing less
> than that great artist nature… whose mechanical process
> makes her purposiveness [Zweckmassigkeit] visibly manifest
> permitting harmony to emerge among men through their
> discord, even against their wills. (Kant 1983, 116)

In other words, the natural processes of history, including human
conflict, ultimately lead to harmony and peace—even if it is against
our wishes. Such is the purpose of nature. Kant, however, goes even
further, adding

> the mechanism of nature, in which self-seeking inclinations
> naturally counteract one another in their external relations,
> can be used by reason as a means to prepare the way for its
> own end, the rule of right, as well as to promote and secure
> the nation’s internal and external peace. (ibid 124)

> Kant’s idea, which pre-dates Hegel’s “cunning of reason”50 asserts
> that reason uses usually conflicting human self-interest as a means to
> achieve peace both domestically and externally. In other words, rea-
> son itself takes an active role, as if it were a character, in the evolution
> towards a perpetual peace. Thus reason takes on a role not unlike
> that of a transcendent God, Who guides humankind through the
> wilderness of its own errors and evils towards the ultimate promised
> land. Through its ‘cunning,’ reason is able to make positive use of our
> mistakes, or, as Milton put it in Paradise Lost, reason or God will
“Out of our evil seek to bring forth good.”51

As we have seen above, the “rule of right” is intimately connected to
the goal of perpetual peace since, as we have seen before, politics must
be based on “the rule of right” if proper order is to be maintained.
Kant even thinks that war itself is part of the historical process of
evolving towards perpetual peace since “through war she [nature] has
constrained them to establish more or less legal relationships.” (ibid
121) The possibility of war forces humans to organize themselves i.e.
adopt orderly, legal regulation in their national and international
relations (ibid 124) and, thereby, eliminate war itself. Kant also
recognizes the importance of “mutual interest,” (ibid 125) especially
economic mutual interest as a means by which “nature unites[s]
people against violence and war” (ibid) and says,

> financial power may be the most reliable in forcing nations
> to pursue the noble cause of peace (though not from moral
> motives); and whenever war threatens to break out they will
> try to head it off through meditation as if they were perma-
> nently leagued for this purpose.

Kant seems to recognize that the “league of peace,” its political and
diplomatic treaty and the establishment of “cosmopolitan right”
may be incapable of eliminating war. This reliance on economics is
a de facto admission of the insufficiency of his statement that “All
politics must bend its knee before morality” (ibid 131) or “the right.”52
Moreover, even though Kant believes war “appears to be ingrained in
human nature,” (ibid 123) he maintains that the necessity of survival
will drive human beings in the direction of order, the rule of right
and, ultimately, peace. But, here, too, he argues on the basis of ani-
mal necessity rather than rational right and, thereby, makes his ‘right’
based argument unnecessary. Humanity will attain perpetual peace
with our free and conscious participation or without it. Nature will
compel us to act in the ways that will bring about peace despite our
lack of interest: “in this fashion nature guarantees perpetual peace by
virtue of man’s inclinations to themselves.” (ibid 125)

The problem with this position is obvious both from a Bahá’í and
non-Bahá’í perspective. The natural “mutual interest” common to
humankind has always existed—and yet has been remarkably inef-
fective in eliminating or even limiting war. Our personal survival
and economic needs have not changed for ages; the needs of trade
and finance are fundamentally the same (though now fulfilled in
different ways) and yet war continues, and indeed, is itself a profitable
business. Even class loyalty could not over-ride forces like nationalism
as shown at the start of WW I when socialist deputies—who had
previously sworn to oppose international war in the name of class loy-
alty—everywhere voted in favor of war credits to their governments
in 1914. Moreover, it is difficult to imagine that Kant would not have
known this, given the history of his own time, let alone previous
human history. The inescapable conclusion is that economic motives
are not sufficient to eliminate war. They cannot serve as replacements
for goodwill and love, though they can support the efforts motivated
by goodwill and love.

> From the perspective of the Bahá’í Writings, there are several

> the transcendent in any way. The fact that he invokes God, albeit in
> the form of a personified nature, indicates that Kant, too, has found

no better way of ‘grounding’ his proposals for a durable peace than
in the transcendent. 53 We have already seen why in the foregoing
discussions on diplomacy and economics.

Kant’s position—at least in effect, though not in intention —is simi-
lar to the Bahá’í position insofar as the guarantor for world peace is
a transcendental power or God. Through His Manifestations, God
has guided humankind through numerous evolutionary stages and
historical circumstances, but always with the theme of unity in mind:

> All the divine Manifestations have proclaimed the oneness of
> God and the unity of mankind. They have taught that men
> should love and mutually help each other in order that they
> might progress. Now if this conception of religion be true, its
> essential principle is the oneness of humanity. The fundamental
> truth of the Manifestations is peace. This underlies all religion,
> all justice. (pup 32)

In the Bahá’í vision, God acts through history, i.e. through human
beings and Manifestations living in particular historical circum-
stances; thus, while the theme of love and human unity is always
present, it appears in different forms through the vicissitudes of
history. That is why Bahá’u’lláh says,

> Had not every tribulation been made the bearer of Thy wisdom,
> and every ordeal the vehicle of Thy providence, no one would
> have dared oppose us, though the powers of earth and heaven
> were to be leagued against us. (PM 14)

In other words, even the troubles and hostile actions against us serve
God’s purposes. Another prayer emphasizes the same idea, stating
that “All are His servants and all abide by His bidding!” (SWB 217)
The concept that God uses history as a vehicle for the realization of

His plan is also found in the teachings about the process of world
history. Jeffrey Huffines writes, that the Bahá’í world view

> is shaped by the teleological belief in the oneness of humanity
> that is at once a cardinal principle and an assertion of the
> ultimate goal of human existence on this planet… Bahá’í
> theology presupposes a linear flow of history….54

The apparent chaos of historical processes notwithstanding, there is
a goal and purpose at work in history, viz. the unification of human-
kind in the Most Great Peace. This means, in effect, that the goal
of the historical developments we live through is, in the long run, to
bring about the “perpetual peace” both the Bahá’í Writings and Kant
desire. The Bahá’í International Community writes,

> The central theme of Bahá'u'lláh's writings is that humanity
> is one single race and the day has come for its unification
> into one global society. Through an irresistible historical
> process, the traditional barriers of race, class, creed, faith
> and nation will break down. These forces will, Bahá'u'lláh
> said, give birth in time to a new universal civilization. The
> crises now afflicting the planet face all its peoples with the
> need to accept their oneness and work towards the creation
> of a unified global society.55

Of course, in the Bahá’í view, this goal will be achieved through the
power of the Manifestation and religion and not through the power
of immanent reason alone.

Conclusion
The foregoing discussions—and there is still more to be said—dem-
onstrate the untenability of any suggestion that Kant’s “Perpetual

Peace” anticipates the Bahá’í vision of a Lesser and Greater Peace
in anything but accidental ways. They are substantially different in
underlying assumptions as well as in what they consider to be the
necessary components of any realistic peace project. In the Bahá’í
Writings, the foundation of peace is made of spiritual principals
such as the Fatherhood of God, the essential oneness of humankind,
justice, the role of the Manifestations and the primacy of love and
goodwill. Political diplomatic and economic factors in addition to
natural self-interest are secondary insofar as they gain their value,
purpose and direction from the spiritual foundations. In Kant, the
situation is virtually reversed. Spiritual factors, if they play any role
at all, do so surreptitiously. Nature is portrayed as having plans and
reason as cunningly turning our self-interest into public benefit.
However, these concessions to the need for the transcendent are
smuggled into Kant’s argument.

> These differences notwithstanding, some rapprochement with Kant
> is possible, at least from a Bahá’í perspective. Kant’s proposals in
“Perpetual Peace” can be integrated almost in toto into the Bahá’í plan;

> Generally, we conclude that Kant’s proposals are better suited to the

Unfortunately, the converse is not true. “Perpetual Peace” has no place
for many key aspects of the Bahá’í plan, above all for the necessity
of character transformation and the cultivation of love and goodwill
towards all on the basis of recognizing the Fatherhood of God. This
is obviously essential to the Bahá’í plan. From a Bahá’í viewpoint

this lack of a religious foundation is a serious weakness in Kant’s
program, if only because religion has historically demonstrated the
power to effect deep and permanent character transformation in
large numbers of people. This transformation may be for good or
bad—but the transformative power of religion is beyond question
and any plan to change humanity without it is self-defeating.
