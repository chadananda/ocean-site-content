      Grand Narratives and the Bahá’í

Writings

Ian Kluge

Introduction

This paper takes its cue from Shoghi Effendi, the Guardian
of the Bahá’í Faith, who calls on Bahá’ís “to investigate and
analyse the principles of the Faith and to correlate them with
the modern aspects of philosophy and science.”1 He reinforces
this point by saying,

> The Cause needs more Bahá’í scholars, people ... who
> have a deep grasp of the Teachings and their
> significance, and who can correlate its beliefs with the
> current thoughts and problems of the people of the
> world.2

He adds, furthermore, that

> If the Bahá’ís want to be really effective in teaching the
> Cause they need to be much better informed and able to
> discuss intelligently, intellectually, the present condition
> of the world and its problems ... who [are] capable of
> correlating our teachings to the current thoughts of the
> leaders of society.3
216                                           Lights of Irfán vol. 18

It is worth noting that the Guardian associates “really
effective” teaching with the ability to “correlate” the Bahá’í
teachings with current issues and debates in society. Such
correlations can be “really effective” because they help make
the Writings part of public discourse about contemporary
topics and, thereby, draw awareness to the Writings themselves
by showing their relevance to modern issues. In addition, they
can show that the Bahá’í Writings have uniquely new ideas and
perspectives to share with the world.

The concept of grand narratives has been and is still under
continued and strenuous attack in our time, being blamed,
among other things, for being totalitarian and setting the stage
for totalitarian regimes;4 for engaging in intellectual
“terrorism”5 by ‘marginalizing the ‘others’ who are different;
and for Western triumphalism and its concomitant colonialism.
The Bahá’í Faith has not — to the best of our knowledge — been
explicitly accused of these short-comings, but the existence of
its grand narrative of progressive revelation leaves it open to
allegations of this nature. Therefore, in the first part of this
paper we shall examine the nature of grand narratives, appraise
some of the major attacks on them and present our
understanding of the Bahá’í grand narrative and why the
criticisms vis-à-vis grand narratives do not apply to the
Writings.

In the second part of this paper we correlate the Bahá’í grand
narrative with the three most influential non-totalitarian grand
narratives of the twentieth century — Oswald Spengler, Arnold
Toynbee and Pitirim Sorokin — and point out the unique
features of the Bahá’í grand narrative that compensate for the
short-comings of other theories.

We draw three major conclusions from our study. First, the
arguments against grand narratives are logically unconvincing
and paradoxically self-refuting. Second, there are numerous and
far-reaching correlations between the Bahá’í Writings and the
work of Spengler, Toynbee and Sorokin. Third, alone among

Grand Narratives and the Bahá’í Writings                      217

these grand narratives, the Bahá’í Writings go beyond diagnosis
of the patterns of human history and complete the diagnosis
with a prescription and the establishment of a healing
institution, i.e. the Universal House of Justice. This
completeness — diagnosis, prescription and healing institution
— allows the Writings to work as a plan for the next stage of
human evolution.

PART I: Grand Narratives

Background, Controversies and an Overview of

the Bahá’í Grand Narrative

1: Introduction

Grand narratives or metanarratives are stories or narratives
by means of which we interpret and understand history. A
narrative may be defined as a series of coherently presented real
or imagined events explicitly or implicitly embedding an
interpretation of the events. In the field of history, such events
and their interpretations may cover local, national,
international and even cosmic history.6 Their prime task is
reveal certain patterns, trends, laws or themes guiding,
informing, shaping the historical processes in societies, nations
or even the world as a whole.7 In other words, metanarratives
purport to demonstrate that history has implicit or explicit
order, coherence and meaning despite superficial appearances
of disorder, randomness even anarchy. Consequently, for grand
narratives the unfolding of history is not just a series of
random, accidental events without any overall order, tendency
or direction. Instead, history has patterns and to that extent is
rational and can be understood rationally.

Moreover, these patterns, themes or principles help us
establish (1) values; (2) criteria for objectively evaluating
historical facts as well as standards for identifying goodness,

218                                            Lights of Irfán vol. 18

truth, legitimacy; (3) consequences and/or logical inferences
from the grand narrative and (4) criteria for making predictions
about the course of history. They are the contexts within which
we form our beliefs. In embryonic or fully developed form,
grand narratives embody a world-view by which both
individuals and societies consciously or unconsciously orient
their lives in regards to fundamental values such as meaning and
purpose, ‘the good,’ justice and ‘evil.’ As will be shown below,
history is replete with examples of grand narratives functioning
as world-views for numerous civilizations.

For grand narratives, the unfolding of history is not just a
series of random, accidental events without any overall order,
tendency or direction. Instead, history has patterns and to that
extent is rational and can be understood rationally. The
existence of order, coherence and meaning in history makes
some degree of predictability possible. Consequently, these
patterns, themes and laws make some degree of historical
predictability possible. The kind of predictions are usually
statistical in nature; like actuarial tables in the life insurance
industry, the patterns of events allow us to calculate general
trends — or the probability of death among certain groups of
people — without being able to predict an individual death. The
immense profitability of the life insurance industry
demonstrates the effectiveness of such statistical predictions.

The Bahá’í Writings explicitly embody a grand narrative of
the history of humankind as well as a vision for its future
culmination in a unified global commonwealth. Without this
grand narrative, much of the raison d'être of the Bahá’í Faith
would vanish since it is Bahá’u’lláh’s specific mission as a
Manifestation of God to guide human history to its
culmination in world unity [WOB 162]. In the words of Shoghi
Effendi,

> Unification of the whole of mankind is the hall-mark of
> the stage which human society is now approaching.

Unity of family, of tribe, of city-state, and nation have
Grand Narratives and the Bahá’í Writings                        219

> been successively attempted and fully established.
> World unity is the goal towards which a harassed
> humanity is striving [WOB 202, emphasis added].

This study of grand or metanarratives and the Bahá’í Writings
aims to accomplish three main goals:
1. To show how the Bahá’í Writings explicitly embody a

grand narrative of the history of humankind;
2. To show how the Bahá’í grand narrative has important

> similarities to three influential metanarratives by Oswald
> Spengler, Arnold J Toynbee and Pitirim Sorokin;
3. To demonstrate the untenability of various criticisms of

> the concept of grand narratives in general, and of the
> Bahá’í grand narrative in particular.
These three goals are interdependent insofar as they are
necessary to provide more than a skeletal presentation of the
subject and to be useful in explicating the Bahá’í Writings, in
apologetics and engaging in dialogue with other religions or
schools of thought.

2: Grand Narratives: The Historical Background

Grand narratives are not a modern invention. Religions
embed metanarratives either in developed or in embryonic
form.8 One of the earliest is the Zoroastrian doctrine that
existence is a universal and cosmic struggle between truth and
order on one side and lie and chaos on the other; our duty is to
support the truth and order. This view gives a cosmic
dimension to all individual and social actions, e.g. personal
business dealings or exchanges with neighbors as well as
political events at the local, national and even transnational
levels. In short, history is a struggle for the victory of the good.
The Jewish grand narrative concerns the story of the Jewish
people (and by extension, humanity as a whole) overcoming
their exile from Paradise and finding their way home to the

220                                           Lights of Irfán vol. 18

Promised Land. During the wanderings, a pattern emerges of
falling away from God, suffering the consequences and
eventually triumphing. Here, too, victory, i.e. attainment of
the Promised Land, is identified with the good. The Christian
grand narrative includes the struggle or good against evil, but
has a personal salvational emphasis focussed on the redemption
for original sin bought for us by the crucifixion. The ultimate
providential aim is for individuals to save their souls and to
work for the establishment of the kingdom of heaven on earth.
The Muslim metanarrative takes up this theme of a providential
kingdom on earth which is set forth in greater detail than in
Christianity and proclaims the end of historical revelation with
Mohammed. The Muslim revelation essentially marks the end of
history as a process to a greater goal.

Numerous philosophers have written enormously influential
grand narratives about particular societies and about universal
history. Saint Augustine’s City of God — clearly influenced by
Zoroastrian dualism — portrays the history of humankind as a
struggle between God and the Devil, and our need to choose
between the City of Man and the City of God. This clearly fits
into the Christian tradition. The 12th century CE theologian
Joachim of Fiore included the concept of progress in his three-
fold division of history: the Age of the Father with its Old
Testament emphasis on law and obedience; the Age of the Son
which included law but emphasized mercy; and the Age of the
[Holy] Spirit in which a “universal Christian society”9 would
emerge. Ibn Khaldun, a 14th century CE Arab Muslim writer
also saw a cyclic pattern of increasing immorality and
corruption when successors took over from the founding
generations of great dynasties. The cyclical nature of this
seemingly inevitable process allows a measure of predictability
in the historical process if not in specific events then in the
nature and sequence of events. Giambattista Vico’s The New
Science (1725 CE) shows history as a progressing and expanding
spiral. The cycles represent the three stages of development: the
age of the gods in which humans are ruled by supernatural

Grand Narratives and the Bahá’í Writings                       221

beings or God; the age of heroes in which humans are ruled by
aristocratic classes; the age of equality in which all people
viewed themselves as equal at least insofar as they shared a
common humanity. The first led to theocratic government or
rule by priests; the second to aristocratic government or
monarchies; the third led to republican or democratic
government. According to Vico “the nature of peoples is first
crude, then severe, then benign then delicate and finally
dissolute.”10 After this, the cycle begins again though always
“recurring on a higher plane.”11 Thus Vico combined the ideas
of progress and cyclical patterns to show history as predictable
at least the kind of developments we can expect.

The 18th century CE of the European Enlightenment — so
vehemently excoriated by the postmodernists — marks the
beginning of an unusually productive period in the efforts to
understand history. What almost all of these efforts have in
common is belief in the progress of humankind not only in
scientific knowledge but also in the growth of rationality,
freedom and social and cultural tolerance. Moreover, a theme
hitherto implicit in earlier grand narratives came to the fore at
this time: the perfectibility of man, society and the world.
Kant’s “Idea of a Universal History from a Cosmopolitan Point
of View” is a good example.12 According to Kant, the purpose
of history is the extension of individual freedom in an ordered
national and international society. Viewing history as a whole,
he states,

> history, which is concerned with narrating these
> appearances, permits us to hope that if we attend to the
> play of freedom of the human will in the large, we may
> be able to discern a regular movement in it, and that
> what seems complex and chaotic in the single individual
> may be seen from the standpoint of the human race as a
> whole to be a steady and progressive though slow
> evolution of its original endowment.13

According to Kant,

222                                           Lights of Irfán vol. 18

> The history of mankind can be seen, in the large, as the
> realization of Nature’s secret plan to bring forth a
> perfectly constituted state as the only condition in
> which the capacities of mankind can be fully developed,
> and also bring forth that external relation among states
> which is perfectly adequate to this end.14

The mechanism by which humanity will actualize its “original
endowment” is that our lower animal nature drives us to
overcome ourselves — because we can’t accept ourselves as
mere animals — and to develop our higher natures. From a
Bahá’í perspective this is a true but inadequate motivation for
progress because it sidesteps the need for Manifestation.

Hegel’s Philosophy of History sees history as the conscious
self-actualization of the Spirit in humankind and through
human history and the growth of freedom. In the end, all
humans will recognize themselves as free and as one with the
Spirit. Hegel’s erstwhile student, Marx, also promulgated a
metanarrative based on the concept of class war between the
ruling classes and the ruled and exploited. Eventually, the
exploited classes would triumph and there would be a
“withering away of the state.”15 Some modern feminist
metanarratives center on the claim that patriarchy, i.e. a male-
dominated society has a specifically anti-female agenda which
has dominated history so far in all parts of the world. Instead
of seeing history in terms of class struggle, they see it terms of
struggle between the sexes with themselves in the role of the
proletariat.

The Bahá’í Writings do not view history as a struggle
between classes, genders, political parties, races, tribes or
nations but rather as a struggle to increase awareness of and
commitment to the unification of mankind. This struggle is
spiritual, epistemological and ethical in nature and employs
persuasion, and instead of various methods of power-seeking
such as partisan political warfare. They aim “to awaken spiritual
susceptibilities in the hearts of mankind, to kindle anew the

Grand Narratives and the Bahá’í Writings                     223

spirit of humanity with divine fires and to reflect the glory of
heaven to this gloomy world of materialism” [PUP 7]. The
Writings view history as a process leading to the unification of
humankind in a global federal commonwealth united by “one
common faith” [SAQ ch.12].16

although this process does not necessarily follow a simple
linear progress. With this goal in mind, they emphasize a
“world-embracing” [TB 86] vision because there is no other
adequate way of understanding human nature and history in the
contemporary world. Less expansive views do not allow us to
see the global development of humankind that has already been
achieved, nor to project these achievements into the future just
as we cannot ‘see’ the progress of a river from a deep valley.
However, a “world-embracing” vision allows such insight in the
same way that we may see the course of a river from a high
mountain.

Furthermore, the Writings are not alone in recognizing that a
“world-embracing” vision is necessary for a deeper
understanding of human history. There are several new
developments in the pursuit of global historical studies. We
observe, for example, the establishment of the World History
Association which studies history from “a trans-national, trans-
regional, and trans-cultural perspective”17 has been growing and
developing since 1980. An examination of the WHA’s
specialities shows that the WHA is doing the same kind of
studies as Spengler, Toynbee and Sorokin.18 We also note the
rising interest in ‘Big History,’19 which starts history with the
Big Bang and reveals various patterns repeating themselves
throughout cosmic and human history.20 Juan Jose Gomez-
Ibarra’s A Scientific Model of History: Where is the Future
Leading Us21 (2003) shows the scientific laws — such as Malthus
and Toynbee’s ‘challenge and response — underlying historical
processes. Ross E. Dunn and Laura J. Mitchell’s Panorama: A
World History is yet another example of historians working
from a global perspective. In addition, there is Immanuel
Wallerstein’s “world systems theory.”22 Sebastian Conrad calls

224                                            Lights of Irfán vol. 18

these expanded visions of history the “all-in version of global
history”23 or “planetary comprehensiveness.”24 We also refer
readers to R. MacNeil and W.H. MacNeil, The Human Web: A
Bird’s-Eye View of World History25 which demonstrates how
communications are unifying the world. Finally, we should take
note of the rise of Civilizational Science, an interdisciplinary
field which uses a scientific approach (e.g. the Annales School)
to pursue macro-historical studies (e.g., Toynbee) to “address
some of the most important problems of globalizing society in
the 21 century and beyond.”26

3: Why Grand Narratives? Four Reasons

At this point we may ask ‘Why are humans so fascinated with
grand narratives? Why do these ‘stories’ keep reappearing — as,
for example, in the recent ascent of Big History, Global
History and scientific history? ‘What characteristics seem to
make them indispensable?’ Why, for example, are the works of
Spengler, Toynbee, Sorokin and Marx still read even though
most professional historians ignore them or dismiss them as
misleading? Why do established academic historians like the
MacNeil’s still try to demonstrate the existence of a pattern
uniting global history?

In our view, there are at least four reasons why grand
narratives survive and will continue to survive.

First, every religion is a grand narrative — at least in outline
or embryo form — that shapes our understanding of the reality,
truth, goodness and morality, justice, human nature, and
values. Religious stories provide a way of understanding
individual and group behavior in the present and the past. For a
pre-literate culture to say ‘We do things this way because our
ancestors did’ is, in effect, an embryonic grand narrative about
the past, present and future. In short, as long as religions exist,
grand narratives will continue. The fact that anthropologists
have never encountered a group of humans without religion
indicates how indispensable religion and its implicit and explicit

grand narratives are to human survival and well-being.
Religions, of course, are more than metanarratives; they are,
for the most part, revelations from God [GWB 217]27 to advance
our spiritual development. However, when we accept a
Manifestation and His spiritual teachings, we also implicitly
accept a grand narrative. Consequently, it seems self-evident
that believing we can live without a grand narratives of one
kind or another violates our empirical anthropological
knowledge of human nature.

‘Abdu’l-Bahá presents a second reason why metanarratives
are necessary: they are necessary to help us make sense of
ourselves and the world in general, i.e. they have an
epistemological function. According to ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, “The
human spirit, which distinguishes man from the animal, is the
rational soul, and these two terms — the human spirit and the
rational soul — designate one and the same thing” [SAQ ch.55].
Because humans have a “rational soul,” we naturally want things
to ‘make sense,’ i.e. to be understandable, intelligible,
justifiable, self-consistent and practicable. Even Pieter Geyl,
one of most relentless critics of metanarratives, admits that it
is “an ingrained habit of human nature ... to try to construct a
vision of history in which chaos, or apparent chaos, is restored
to order.”28 (Unfortunately, he does not ask why this habit is so
deeply ingrained.) Without order, there is no understanding,
and without understanding life becomes meaningless and even
catastrophic: it is virtually impossible to make sense of
ourselves and the world around us and, thereby, a clear sense of
identity, of our values and of our goals. This, in turn,
undermines our ability to act rationally and coherently and to
maintain social relationships. How could a society made up of
such individuals function? If we cannot act with a certain
consistency, we shall often undermine our own efforts and
confuse ourselves and others. In effect, we fail to actualize
ourselves as “rational souls” — our essential attribute [SAQ ch.55]
— at the personal and societal level, and, therefore, cannot
function optimally. For example, if we fail to recognize and act

226                                           Lights of Irfán vol. 18

on the Bahá’í teaching that all human beings have both a
spiritual and a physical nature [SAQ ch.29] and that the spiritual
function must rule, then we are severely hindered in actualizing
our essence as “rational souls.” In the words of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá,
“If the physical or natural disposition in him should overcome
the heavenly and merciful, he is, then, the most degraded of
animal beings” [PUP 41]. We are incomplete beings whose
“spiritual susceptibilities” [PUP 339] remain dormant. We remain
at or close to the level of animals without the activation of our
higher capacities.

Helping us gain such understanding of ourselves and the
world is one of the benefits conferred by the Manifestations
Who, for example, teach us about our spiritual and animal
natures and the long-term benefits of having our spiritual
nature in control. In addition, the Manifestations provide a
‘map’ or a guidebook to reality, its nature, its purpose and its
goal or final cause. As humankind progresses, the accidental or
culture-bound attributes of former metanarratives are
abandoned and a new Manifestation arrives to establish a new
grand narrative commensurate with the intellectual, social,
material and spiritual development of the time. In other words,
the continual presence of Manifestations means that there
never has been a time when grand narratives of one kind or
another have not guided human thought, feeling and action. In
short, metanarratives are so important to human development
that God sends Manifestations to establish them.

The third major function of grand narratives is also
epistemological but in a more technical sense, i.e. to bring
order to our knowledge and thinking. Bringing order to any
kind of knowledge and thought requires us to prioritize or
privilege (a) some facts over others vis-à-vis truth, relevance
and importance and (b) some sources of knowledge and
knowledge-claims over others. In practical terms, we must
choose if we are going to take surgical advice from a surgeon or
an astrologer. We must be able to recognize and distinguish
between the essential and non-essential aspects of information

and discard what is less important and unreliable sources. In
religion, it is the Manifestation Who “distinguishes the essential
and the authentic from the nonessential and spurious in their
teachings” [PDC 108]. Such distinctions are necessary because no
one can accept all knowledge sources and knowledge as equally
relevant or as equally valid because that makes it impossible to
take action — which requires us to select one option or fact
over another. Furthermore, such distinctions are also necessary
because humans are fallible and not all knowledge claims are
equally valid.29 This inevitably sets up a hierarchy of knowledge.
The Writings obviously privilege Bahá’u’lláh, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá and
Shoghi Effendi as infallible knowledge vis-à-vis the teachings of
the Faith. Moreover, Bahá’u’lláh, God’s Manifestation for this
age, clearly rejects some sources of knowledge as invalid when
he says,

> Its [the world’s] sickness is approaching the stage of
> utter hopelessness, inasmuch as the true Physician is
> debarred from administering the remedy, whilst
> unskilled practitioners are regarded with favor, and are
> accorded full freedom to act... [GWB 39-40]

Similarly, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá says,

> This panacea [of religion] must, however, be
> administered by a wise and skilled physician, for in the
> hands of an incompetent all the cures that the Lord of
> men has ever created to heal men's ills could produce no
> health, and would on the contrary only destroy the
> helpless and burden the hearts of the already afflicted.

[SDC 98]

The Writings clearly endorse such prioritizing since not all
remedies and/or knowledge claims are equally effective as
shown in the reference to “unskilled practitioners.”
Furthermore, from the quotations given above, the Writings
clearly privilege one side of the following binary oppositions:
competent/incompetent; rational/irrational; true/untrue; order/

228                                            Lights of Irfán vol. 18

disorder; health/sickness; knowledge/ignorance; and enemy/
friend. Indeed, the unskilled physician who pretends to be
skilled is, in effect, an enemy to the patient. It is irrational to
bar the “true Physician” because doing so upends the proper
order of things and is, thereby, not only chaotic but unjust.
Other binary oppositions implicitly or explicitly found in the
Writings and the Bahá’í grand narrative are essential/accidental;
order/disorder; progressive/regressive; noumenal/phenomenal;
true/untrue; moral/immoral; knowledge/superstition; rational/
irrational, good/evil-satanic [GWB 19] and primitive/civilized.

These binary oppositions are a part of the Bahá’í
metanarrative. Removing them undermines the Bahá’í
teachings. For example, if we refuse to privilege truth, i.e.
refuse to declare truth superior to untruth, we would also
undermine every statement in which Bahá’u’lláh claims to speak
the truth. He says, “Wherefore, should one of these
Manifestations of Holiness proclaim saying: ‘I am the return of
all the Prophets,’ He, verily, speaketh the truth” [GWB 51]. This
statement, which is taken as true in the Bahá’í context, is
privileged over its denial and, therefore, is more valuable than
the denial of Bahá’u’lláh’s words since it reveals something
fundamental about the Manifestations and history. In short, the
denial is simply wrong.30 By means of these oppositions,
metanarratives take on a prescriptive function not only for
individuals but for entire societies which use them to construct
their world views. In short, metanarratives help individuals and
societies make sense of the world.

Privileging truth statements is also an example of the
“legitimation of knowledge,”31 which is to say that the
metanarrative provides the standard for identifying truth. It
provides the foundational principles by which to distinguish
‘real knowledge,’ fact or truth from error, superstition, myth
or the utterances of the insane. Of course, the “legitimation of
knowledge” is obvious in the Bahá’í Faith insofar as both
Bahá’u’lláh and ‘Abdu’l-Bahá are regarded as infallible and
Shoghi Effendi as infallible his interpretations of the Writings.

> Say: This [revelation] is the infallible Balance which the
> Hand of God is holding, in which all who are in the
> heavens and all who are on the earth are weighed, and
> their fate determined, if ye be of them that believe and
> recognize this truth. Say: Through it the poor have been
> enriched, the learned enlightened. [GWB 136]

Because the Manifestation and His revelation are the balance
for assaying the truth, He also has to clear away — uproot and
destroy — falsehood. As ‘Abdu’l-Bahá says,

> The divine Manifestations have been iconoclastic in
> Their teachings, uprooting error, destroying false
> religious beliefs and summoning mankind anew to the
> fundamental oneness of God. [PUP 154]

Thus, the metanarrative becomes the gatekeeper of knowledge.
It is worth emphasizing that the Manifestations mission of
“uprooting error” and “destroying false religious beliefs” shows
that not all knowledge-claims are valid and that at least some
beliefs are erroneous.

The fourth major function of grand narratives is the
“legitimation of power,” i.e. they provide a rationale to explain
why certain individuals or groups have power and why or why
not such power is legitimate or illegitimate. Such legitimation is
necessary to maintain at least a certain minimum of social
stability. The Bahá’í grand narrative also fulfills this function
insofar as its metaphysical framework explains the unique
metaphysical status of the Manifestations:

> And since there can be no tie of direct intercourse to
> bind the one true God with His creation, and no
> resemblance whatever can exist between the transient
> and the Eternal, the contingent and the Absolute, He
> hath ordained that in every age and dispensation a pure
> and stainless Soul be made manifest in the kingdoms of
> earth and heaven. Unto this subtle this mysterious and
230                                             Lights of Irfán vol. 18

> ethereal Being He hath assigned a twofold nature; the
> physical, pertaining to the world of matter, and the
> spiritual, which is born of the substance of God
> Himself. He hath, moreover, conferred upon Him a
> double station. The first station, which is related to His
> innermost reality, representeth Him as One Whose voice
> is the voice of God Himself ... The second station is the
> human station, exemplified by the following verses: “I
> am but a man like you.” [GWB 66]

This passage explains why, metaphysically speaking, the
power of the Manifestations is legitimate: They are God’s
representative on earth. Their power is justified or legitimated
by Their omniscience because They, not we, truly understand
what is best for humankind inasmuch as Their knowledge of us
is complete and not limited by time or space. Moreover,
because Their power is metaphysically based, there is no
legitimate replacement — Their status, power and omniscience
are part of the basic structure of reality itself. Lyotard,
Foucault, and others would, of course, portray God as a
dictator but this critique overlooks the free will God bestows
upon the individual as one of our essential attributes. We shall
discuss this in more detail below.

4: The Bahá’í Grand Narrative: Getting Started

There is, in our view, no question that the Bahá’í Writings
establish a grand narrative of the gradual unification of
humankind into a world federal commonwealth united in “one
common faith” [SAQ ch.12]. This will be achieved by the
actualization of humanity’s physical, intellectual and spiritual
potentials guided by the successive Manifestations of God each
of Whom inaugurates a dispensation [DG 7].32 Each dispensation
passes through a spring, summer, autumn, fall and winter at
which time a new dispensation begins. The pattern of ascent,
apex and decline is universal and applies to all cultures none of
which is eternal and each of which has an inevitable, pre-

ordained end. Thus the Bahá’í metanarrative reflects a synthesis
of linear, i.e. progressive as well as cyclical theories of history
which may be represented by an expanding and advancing
spiral. Our progress is inspired and guided by the succession of
Manifestations to the goal of unifying mankind into a federal
world commonwealth united by “one common faith.” This final
goal sheds new light on the meaning to human history as a
whole. For example, W.W. II may be seen not only as a result
from a series of tragic diplomatic, political and military events
but also as a part of the process of weakening the colonial
powers and, thereby, enabling colonized peoples to begin their
struggle for freedom and future independent development.

Regarded cosmically, the Bahá’í grand narrative begins with
the intentional creation of the phenomenal world by a loving
God [PUP 298] Who bestows on all things signs of “His names
and attributes” [GWB 178] as well as the latent perfections [GWB
259] to be actualized over time. These divine bestowals are real
and objective values which form an integral part of the cosmic
historical process, i.e. the struggle to actualize the potentials
inherent in all things. Since humans struggle to do the same,
their evolutionary striving for complete actualization is a
specialized case of the teleological striving of the entire
phenomenal world. From this we may infer that history has a
meaning, and exemplifies certain values like unity, self-
overcoming and “awaken[ed] spiritual susceptibilities” [PUP 7].
The divine origin of the phenomenal, i.e. created world and the
presence of God’s “names and attributes” in all things
demonstrates that these values are real and objective aspects of
phenomenal reality. It also demonstrates the sacred nature of
reality as well as the sacred nature of the cosmic and human
historical process.

The human historical process is the vanguard of cosmic
evolution because God created man as the “supreme talisman”
[GWB 259] who not only represents all “the names and
attributes” of God in creation but is also the “fruit” [PUP 6] or
ultimate purpose of cosmic evolution. Mankind is the highest

232                                             Lights of Irfán vol. 18

expression of the cosmic process. Without humankind, the
material world would have “no use” [SAQ ch.50]. From this we
may conclude that in the Bahá’í grand narrative, cosmic
evolution and human evolution and history are integrated, i.e.
aspects of a greater whole. Humankind plays a real part in the
evolution of the cosmos — it is not “an accidental composition
or arrangement” [SAQ ch.47] but is, rather, an essential part of
the cosmos actualizing its own hidden potentials. This suggests
that a proper understanding of humans and human nature is
necessary for a proper understanding of the physical world.
Because cosmic evolution has a purpose, it is both teleological
and progressive and, thereby, rational, i.e. the purpose and the
means are adapted to one another and work together. The same
is true of mankind’s historical development inasmuch as it is
directed to achieving a goal set by “that invisible yet rational
God” [WOB 112].

In the historical process, we observe the expansion of the
social unit, i.e. increasing inclusiveness to include previously
excluded or marginalized groups. This process seems to be
proceeding with increasing speed since the 15th century CE with
the European voyages of ‘discovery,’ The entire history of
mankind from pre-historic times to the 21st Century can be
understood in light of this theme. In the words of Shoghi
Effendi,

> This will indeed be the fitting climax of that process of
> integration which, starting with the family, the smallest
> unit in the scale of human organization, must, after
> having called successively into being the tribe, the city-
> state, and the nation, continue to operate until it
> culminates in the unification of the whole world, the
> final object and the crowning glory of human evolution
> on this planet. It is this stage which humanity, willingly
> or unwillingly, is resistlessly approaching. [PDC 117]

He re-emphasizes this by saying,

> Unification of the whole of mankind is the hall-mark of
> the stage which human society is now approaching.
> Unity of family, of tribe, of city-state, and nation have
> been successively attempted and fully established.
> World unity is the goal towards which a harassed
> humanity is striving. Nation-building has come to an
> end. [WOB 202, emphasis added]

We begin with the family, advance through clan and tribe,
then proceed to city-states, nations, empires and collaborative
supra-national alliances and end with a world federal
commonwealth. The changes in consciousness and spirituality
required for this development occur through the often
unnoticed influence of the successive Manifestations, and in
our age, of Bahá’u’lláh Whose teachings are the most
appropriate and advanced guidance for our time. In the process
of actualizing its potentials, humankind starts coalescing into
larger and larger social units which require further actualization
of social capacities, intellectual and spiritual capacities and
even material capacities. It is worth noting the inevitability of
mankind’s integration into one global commonwealth in which
“All men will adhere to one religion, will have one common
faith, will be blended into one race, and become a single
people” [SAQ ch.12]. This process will not be without
tremendous suffering; as Shoghi Effendi tells us,

> Much suffering will still be required ere the contending
> nations, creeds, classes and races of mankind are fused
> in the crucible of universal affliction, and are forged by
> the fires of a fierce ordeal into one organic
> commonwealth, one vast, unified, and harmoniously
> functioning system. [WOB 193]

Such statements facilitate the conclusion that the Bahá’í
Writings portray history as teleological with a divinely fixed
and inescapable goal. Our only choice is whether we shall
advance towards this goal “willingly or unwillingly.” Following

234                                           Lights of Irfán vol. 18

the analogy of adolescence [PUP 439] used in the Writings,
humanity may choose to grow up the hard way or the easier
way, but in either case we shall grow up. Those who oppose
global unification will end up working for it despite their
intentions. As the Báb says, “All are His servants and all abide
by His bidding!” [SWB 214] In other words, subjectively we may
think our actions hinder the unificatory process but
objectively, in actual effect, our actions help the process in the
long run. This is illustrated by the Bahá’í diaspora after the
1979 revolution in Iran. The Bahá’í diaspora spread the
teachings of the Faith on a global scale and drew world-wide
attention which attracted more people to Bahá’u’lláh.

Progressing to the goal of world unification requires the
actualization of intellectual potentials and the “awaken[ing of]
spiritual susceptibilities in the hearts of mankind” [PUP 7].
Awakening the “susceptibilities” is a duty incumbent on all
insofar as Bahá’u’lláh states, “All men have been created to
carry forward an ever-advancing civilization” [GWB 214]. In this
process, humanity is guided by the successive Manifestations of
God each of Whom inaugurates a dispensation that passes
through a spring, summer, autumn, fall and winter at which
time a new dispensation begins to progress even further
towards the ultimate goal. Two points are clear from this
teaching. First, dispensations and their associated civilizations
are not eternal. There is no final divine dispensation — a
teaching contradicted by Judaism, Christianity, Islam and some
interpretations of Buddhism — and there is no final civilization
which humans cannot surpass. This doctrine undercuts the
hubris of religious and cultural supremacist ideologies. Second,
Manifestations are one of the ways in which God takes active
part in human history. In other words, God is a ‘God of history’
insofar as He works through the actual, messy historical
processes in which flawed human beings struggle through
countless difficulties, many of them created by nature and/or
their own behaviors. In other words, history manifests a

salvational or providential plan to bring genuine peace and
advance the material and spiritual evolution of mankind.

Shoghi Effendi outlines the mission of Bahá’u’lláh — and all
other Manifestations — as follows:

> Repudiating the claim of any religion to be the final
> revelation of God to man, disclaiming finality for His
> own Revelation, Bahá’u’lláh inculcates the basic
> principle of the relativity of religious truth, the
> continuity of Divine Revelation, the progressiveness of
> religious experience. His aim is to widen the basis of all
> revealed religions and to unravel the mysteries of their
> scriptures. He insists on the unqualified recognition of
> the unity of their purpose, restates the eternal verities
> they enshrine, coordinates their functions, distinguishes
> the essential and the authentic from the nonessential and
> spurious in their teachings, separates the God-given
> truths from the priest-prompted superstitions, and on
> this as a basis proclaims the possibility, and even
> prophecies the inevitability, of their unification, and the
> consummation of their highest hopes. [PDC 107]

This passage shows that the Manifestations have all been
working towards the final goal of the historical process as a
whole. This is one of the outstanding and unique features of the
Bahá’í grand narrative: it includes without any qualification, all
the Manifestations of God from all major religions as equal
partners in history and especially in the spiritual history of
mankind. All Manifestations have an unqualifiedly rightful
place in the unfolding of history and are not accepted merely as
a courtesy, as a matter of ‘political correctness’ or as display of
tolerance.

At this point, the Bahá’í grand narrative shows part of its
metaphysical foundations:

236                                               Lights of Irfán vol. 18

> These Manifestations of God have each a twofold
> station. One is the station of pure abstraction and
> essential unity. In this respect, if thou callest them all by
> one name, and dost ascribe to them the same attributes,
> thou hast not erred from the truth. Even as He hath
> revealed: “No distinction do We make between any of
> His Messengers.” ... The other station is the station of
> distinction, and pertaineth to the world of creation, and
> to the limitations thereof. In this respect, each
> Manifestation of God hath a distinct individuality, a
> definitely prescribed mission, a predestined revelation,
> and specially designated limitations. [GWB 50]

At the spiritual level, all the Manifestations are ontologically
one and the same which is why Bahá’ís must accept and value all
Manifestations as completely equal in all respects. However,
the Manifestations are also distinct historical individuals
fulfilling particular mandates for particular places, times and
circumstances. From this perspective it becomes clear that
contrary to the apparent plethora of religions, there is only one
religion for all of humanity. All past religions have revealed
various aspects appropriate to various spiritual, intellectual and
material conditions. In the words of Dr. Moojan Momen,

> Thus, we may describe Bahá’u’lláh’s project as that of
> creating a metareligion — a religion that encompasses
> and provides a theoretical framework within which it is
> possible to see the truth of all religion.33

In other words, from the unity of the Manifestations’
missions, we also find that there is, in the last analysis, only one
human history to which partial histories contribute.

5: The Four Foundational Principles of the Bahá’í
Grand Narrative

In our view, the Bahá’í grand narrative is built on four
principles. All attributions to the Bahá’í metanarrative must
agree with or converge on or, at least, not contradict these
principles which form the rational and coherent foundation of
this master narrative. With this narrative we may interpret
major historical developments by contextualizing them, i.e. by
locating them and their effects vis-à-vis the advance towards
world unification. As shall be discussed below, such assessments
must also take into account “the wisdom of God” which
reconciles human free will with a pre-determined historical
outcome.34

In our understanding, the first foundational principle of the
Bahá’í historical metanarrative is the doctrine of “progressive
revelation.” This doctrine asserts that mankind’s development
is inspired and guided by successive Manifestations of God
Who lead us to the continued actualization of our spiritual and
material potentials. According to the Writings, “without the
teachings of God the world of humanity is like the animal
kingdom” [PUP 62] i.e. without the Manifestations, humankind
would never advance beyond the limits of materialistic thought
to the higher levels of specifically human development. The
Manifestations’ spiritual teachings enable humanity’s other
capacities to develop and progress:

> “Progress” is the expression of spirit in the world of
> matter. The intelligence of man, his reasoning powers,
> his knowledge, his scientific achievements, all these
> being manifestations of the spirit, partake of the
> inevitable law of spiritual progress and are, therefore,
> of necessity, immortal. [PT 90, emphasis added]

Two statements are worth noting. First, matter becomes
progressive through the action of spirit. Without spirit, matter
is intrinsically in motion [SAQ ch.63] but it is not progressive in

238                                            Lights of Irfán vol. 18

the sense of having an intrinsic final cause that leads it to
transcend its inherent limitations in greater unities. Second,
‘Abdu’l-Bahá, refers to “the inevitable law of spiritual
progress” which makes it clear that, with the guidance of the
Manifestations, human progress is pre-destined, unavoidable
and certain. This guaranteed — though not necessarily simple
linear — progress is a distinguishing feature of the Bahá’í grand
narrative. Insofar as the Manifestations inspire mankind’s
progress, they are the origins of culture. As humanity advances
spiritually and materially, additional Manifestations appear
with new time-appropriate teachings that help us take the next
step in spiritual and social progress. The essential teachings of
the past are renewed, new teachings are added and the
accidental features suitable to past times and places are
abandoned. Shoghi Effendi writes the aim of each
Manifestation is to

> widen the basis of all revealed religions and to unravel
> the mysteries of their scriptures. He insists on the
> unqualified recognition of the unity of their purpose,
> restates the eternal verities they enshrine, coordinates
> their functions, distinguishes the essential and the
> authentic from the nonessential and spurious in their
> teachings, separates the God-given truths from the
> priest-prompted superstitions, and on this as a basis
> proclaims the possibility, and even prophecies the
> inevitability, of their unification, and the consummation
> of their highest hopes. [PDC 108, emphasis added]

All these measures serve Bahá’u’lláh’s command that “All
men have been created to carry forward an ever-advancing
civilization” [GWB 214]. It is worth noting that “civilization” is
singular thereby reminding us that the ultimate goal of the
historic process is one civilization joined in a global federal
commonwealth united in “one common faith” [SAQ ch.12]. Each
culture makes its contribution to the final whole, thereby safe-
guarding the principle of unity in diversity. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá

prescribes other guidelines for contributing to an “ever-
advancing civilization”:

> It is now the time in the history of the world for us to
> strive and give an impetus to the advancement and
> development of inner forces — that is to say, we must
> arise to service in the world of morality, for human
> morals are in need of readjustment. We must also render
> service to the world of intellectuality in order that the
> minds of men may increase in power and become keener
> in perception, assisting the intellect of man to attain its
> supremacy so that the ideal virtues may appear. [PUP 325]

A key aspect of progressive revelation is that revelation is
never-ending. Shoghi Effendi says, that Bahá’í

> teachings revolve around the fundamental principle that
> religious truth is not absolute but relative, that Divine
> Revelation is progressive, not final. Unequivocally and
> without the least reservation it proclaims all established
> religions to be divine in origin, identical in their aims,
> complementary in their functions, continuous in their
> purpose, indispensable in their value to mankind. [WOB 58]

This declaration not only establishes the centrality of
progressive revelation in the Bahá’í world view, but also
outlines the basic grand narrative explicitly and implicitly
present in the Writings. Divine revelations exist to guide
humankind throughout the phases of its development in a way
that is appropriate to its condition at any given time. Hence, it
progresses, i.e. reveals more as the human condition warrants
and as we “awaken spiritual susceptibilities” [PUP 7]. There is no
end to this revelation and, therefore, no final Manifestation or
final formulation of the truth. Truth is “relative” inasmuch as
the expressions of the divine truth are adapted to human
condition at any given time, but — and this is essential to note
— these culture-formed relative expressions are all expressions
of certain enduring truths or “eternal verities” [PDC 108] as

240                                            Lights of Irfán vol. 18

Shoghi Effendi calls them. In other words, “truth is one,
although its manifestations may be very different” [PT 121]. The
fact that revelation is progressive means that the Bahá’í grand
narrative of mankind’s history is teleological, i.e. goal and
purpose driven to a particular end, i.e. the unification of
mankind into a global federal commonwealth joined in “one
common faith.” In other words, appearances to the contrary,
history has an inherent order that includes some measure of
predictability.

5\.1: The Second Foundational Principle: The Oneness
of Humankind 35

The second foundational principle of the Bahá’í grand
narrative is

> the principle of the Oneness of Mankind, the
> cornerstone of Bahá’u’lláh's world-embracing dominion,
> implies nothing more nor less than the enforcement of
> His scheme for the unification of the world. [WOB 36]

Without recognizing the essential one-ness of mankind, the
vision of history as a grand narrative aimed at the unification
of mankind would lack a workable foundation. Physical things,
ideas and beliefs or events cannot be united in any durable way
without sharing something in common.36 ‘Abdu’l-Bahá makes it
clear that all human beings share an identical, essential nature in
several ways. First, he declares that “there are two natures in
man: the physical nature and the spiritual nature” [SAQ 118]. All
human beings share this constitutional make-up. At the physical
or natural level this essential nature is demonstrated by the
universality of medical and physiological studies. While some
medical differences between ethnic groups exist,37 they are not
enough to change our essential human nature. Even more, all
humans share the essential attribute of having a “rational soul”
which “is the human reality” [SAQ ch.38] or essence. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá
says that which

> distinguishes man from the animal is the rational soul,
> and these two names — the human spirit and the rational
> soul — designate one thing. This spirit, which in the
> terminology of the philosophers is the rational soul,
> embraces all beings, and as far as human ability permits
> discovers the realities of things and becomes cognizant
> of their peculiarities and effects, and of the qualities
> and properties of beings. [SAQ ch.55]

From these passages, we may conclude that humankind shares
“the human spirit” or the “rational soul” as well as its dual
constitution of our natural and spiritual aspects. Moreover, for
all humans our natural or animal aspects are the source of “all
imperfection” and the spiritual aspect is the “source of all
perfection,” i.e. good [SAQ 118]. In short, all human beings share
the same ontological structure which, as we shall see, the
natural and spiritual aspects of the soul explain the origins of
good and evil in humankind, i.e. the vices and virtues. On the
other hand, the powers of the rational soul explain why humans
everywhere have, at least in principle, the universal capacities
for learning and thought, for rational action like building
societies, and for creative invention among other things. Of
course, the presence of these capacities does not always mean
they are used to the same degree or to the same advantage. Nor
does it prevent societies from getting ‘sick’ or succumbing to
“maladaptive” i.e. self-destructive ideologies.38

5\.2: The Third Principle: The Unification of Mankind

The third principle of the Bahá’í grand narrative is the
ultimate goal of the unification of humankind in a global
commonwealth in which

> All men will adhere to one religion, will have one
> common faith, will be blended into one race, and
> become a single people. All will dwell in one common
> fatherland, which is the planet itself. [SAQ ch.12]
242                                            Lights of Irfán vol. 18

Shoghi Effendi makes the international aspect of this goal clear:

> The unity of the human race, as envisaged by
> Bahá’u’lláh, implies the establishment of a world
> commonwealth in which all nations, races, creeds and
> classes are closely and permanently united, and in which
> the autonomy of its state members and the personal
> freedom and initiative of the individuals that compose
> them are definitely and completely safeguarded. [WOB 203]

Clearly, the Bahá’í grand narrative is teleological in nature, a
principle that allows us to understand and judge historical
developments in light of the ultimate goal, i.e. whether they
facilitate or hinder humanity’s progress to this endpoint.

At this point it is essential to note a unique feature of the
Bahá’í grand narrative. It combines freedom of the individual
will with the principle of a determined ultimate goal in history.
In other words, world unification is an inevitable goal —
ultimately pre-determined by God — but how we get there, by
easy ways or hard or by whatever process we individually and
collectively choose, history will arrive at a global federal
commonwealth united by “one common faith.” For example,
humanity could have chosen the Most Great Peace when
Bahá’u’lláh offered it but chose instead the trouble-ridden path
to the Lesser Peace, leading Bahá’u’lláh to exhort, “Now that ye
have refused the Most Great Peace, hold ye fast unto this, the
Lesser Peace, that haply ye may in some degree better your own
condition and that of your dependents” [GWB 253].

Statistical science tells us there is nothing inherently
contradictory about a process that combines free individual
choices and predictable and pre-determined ends for groups.
Consider the actuarial tables compiled by life insurance
companies. Countless millions of uncoordinated free individual
decisions about life-style lead to orderly patterns and trends in
death statistics that enable us to make predictions about groups
and as well as identify life-expectancy probability for

individuals. Of course, there are always exceptions but the
majority of people do, in fact, die as predicted which is why life
insurance companies are so immensely profitable. The reason
for this paradoxical result is the inherent parameters of human
nature which constrain the number of possible outcomes which
in turn leads inevitably to the formation of patterns and/or
trends. Another illustration of this apparently self-
contradictory phenomenon can be seen in the graph line of
stock investments. The graph are the results of countless free
uncoordinated individual decisions, but the overall direction or
trend shows a preferential movement in a certain direction even
if contrary trends appear from time to time. Many of these
patterns and trends are so predictable that computers can be
programmed to anticipate them and take action.

5\.3: The Fourth Principle: The Means of Unification

Finally, the fourth principle of Bahá’í meta-history are the
processes by which unification takes place. The first of these is
the Manifestation of God Who comes to inaugurate a new
stage of evolution in which humankind will make more
spiritual, material and cultural progress. This process begins
with destabilizing the established — though already
disintegrating — order. Bahá’u’lláh says,

> The world's equilibrium hath been upset through the
> vibrating influence of this most great, this new World
> Order. Mankind's ordered life hath been revolutionized
> through the agency of this unique, this wondrous System
> — the like of which mortal eyes have never witnessed.

[GWB 136]

In other words, God sends a new Manifestation when one
phase of human development has run its course i.e. actualized
its potentials and a new one is to begin self-actualizing. Because
the previous revelation and its social order no longer meets the
needs of human progress, the new Manifestation arrives to

244                                            Lights of Irfán vol. 18

guide humankind through the next stage of spiritual, material
and cultural growth. Through the Manifestations, God acts in
the historical process.

The second aspect of the means by which God participates in
history refers to the two-fold action when a new stage of
development starts within a worn-out civilization without any
new potentials left to actualize. Shoghi Effendi notes while one
historical process is the death agonies of an old world order,

> The second proclaims the birth pangs of an Order,
> divine and redemptive, that will inevitably supplant the
> former, and within Whose administrative structure an
> embryonic civilization, incomparable and world-
> embracing, is imperceptibly maturing. The one is being
> rolled up, and is crashing in oppression, bloodshed, and
> ruin. The other opens up vistas of a justice, a unity, a
> peace, a culture, such as no age has ever seen. [PDC 17,
> emphasis added]

In other words, two historical processes operate at the same
time — a degenerating process of the old order of society and,
growing within it, (Toynbee’s “chrysalis” and “internal
proletariat”) a new revelation and its concomitant civilization.
As the old civilization declines, the vigor of the new revelation
and world order increases until it is established.39 The new
civilization will be better able to meet the challenges of the
next stage of human development.

Finally, the means by which history advances is through the
expansion of the social order, i.e. growing inclusivity. Shoghi
Effendi states,

> Unification of the whole of mankind is the hall-mark of
> the stage which human society is now approaching.
> Unity of family, of tribe, of city-state, and nation have
> been successively attempted and fully established.

World unity is the goal towards which a harassed

> humanity is striving. Nation-building has come to an
> end. The anarchy inherent in state sovereignty is moving
> towards a climax. A world, growing to maturity, must
> abandon this fetish, recognize the oneness and whole-
> ness of human relationships. [WOB 202, emphasis added]

In other words, social units show an increase in the number
and variety of people who are included as ‘one of us’ or even
seen as ‘fully human.’ Conversely, the number of people who
are considered as irredeemably ‘other’ are reduced. This must
happen on an individual and collective level.

To reach the next, i.e. global stage of historical
development, we must recognize that “nation-building has
come to an end” at least in the traditional sense and it is now
time to concentrate our efforts on building a global federal
commonwealth united by “one common faith.” This involves
numerous and radical changes in personal and collective self-
image and self-definition; in the expansion of spiritual capacity;
in personal and societal ethical standards; political and social
world-views and practices; and in a re-alignment of our
loyalties vis-à-vis national state and the world. However, we
must not think this is necessarily a single straight-forward
process especially in the contemporary world when two
processes are at work.

6: The Metaphysical Foundations of the Bahá’í
Grand Narrative

The Bahá’í grand narrative of world history is grounded in
the metaphysical and ontological teachings embedded in the
Bahá’í Writings. The reason for this is clear: history is a part of
the phenomenal world created by God and the metaphysical and
ontological principles laid down in the Writings are the pre-
conditions that inform and shape everything that exists or
happens in the phenomenal world. Consequently, the historical
process is necessarily linked to the appropriate metaphysical

246                                             Lights of Irfán vol. 18

and ontological principles or pre-conditions. For that reason
the most complete form of a grand narrative of world history is
one capable of connecting the metaphysical foundations with
the actual historical processes. This give us the greatest possible
understanding we can obtain within the inherent
epistemological limits of humankind. It also increases logical
coherence because it contains within itself all the metaphysical
principles needed to justify its own arguments, inferences and
conclusions. Only three other metanarratives attempt such
comprehensiveness: Hegel and Marx, and to a lesser degree
Toynbee.

The metaphysical foundation of the Bahá’í grand narrative is
the existence of God as the “the Creator of earth and heaven”
[ESW 40], “the Sustainer” [TB 144] of all that exists. This has at
least five important consequences. First, the phenomenal world
is intentional, i.e. it is intentionally brought into existence by
an act of God’s Will:

> Through His world-pervading Will He hath brought into
> being all created things ... All that is in heaven and all
> that is in the earth have come to exist at His bidding,
> and by His Will all have stepped out of utter
> nothingness into the realm of being. [GWB 318]

It is important to notice that God intended, i.e. wanted the
phenomenal world to exist because He loved it: ‘Abdu’l-Bahá
states “The cause of the creation of the phenomenal world is
love” [PUP 297] which also suggests that by virtue of God’s love,
creation, the phenomenal world has inherent value. This, in
turn, establishes that in the Bahá’í grand narrative, at least some
values are objective and real, and that ethical subjectivism does
not universally apply. It also means that Hume’s Guillotine —
the impossibility of getting from a description to a prescription
— does not work with the Bahá’í metanarrative because at least
some values are inherent in phenomenal things.

What we also learn from the pervasiveness of the divine Will
is that the phenomenal world cannot explain itself in strictly
phenomenal terms — as materialist and atheist systems require —
but must be referenced to something that is beyond it in
capacity and power and is unavoidable. Any attempt to explain
physical nature by strictly physical means ends in an infinite
regress since any alleged ‘final’ explanation lapses into an
infinite sequence of physical causes. Bahá’u’lláh also speaks of
“the Divine Will that pervadeth all that is in the heavens and all
that is on the earth” [GWB 5] and notes that “Happy is the man
that hath apprehended the Purpose of God in whatever He hath
revealed from the Heaven of His Will, that pervadeth all
created things” [GWB 335, emphasis added]. Similarly, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá
refers to “the divine breath which animates and pervades all
things” [PUP 58]. Bahá’u’lláh also states,

> Whatever is in the heavens and whatever is on the earth
> is a direct evidence of the revelation within it of the
> attributes and names of God, inasmuch as within every
> atom are enshrined the signs that bear eloquent testimony
> to the revelation of that Most Great Light. [GWB 177]

Already at this point it is clear that the existence of a creator
God Whose Will permeates all things will have a dramatic
effect on how we contextualize and write world history.
Whether or not human history is contextualized in a theistic,
atheistic or agnostic way matters because the kind of world-
view we espouse — either consciously or unconsciously —
contextualizes our thinking and, thereby, influences our
judgments about values, human nature, motivations, actions,
events, society, politics, justice and truth to name only a few.
Our understanding, evaluation and presentation of lives or
events will be dramatically different if contextualized by an
indifferent world of matter, random mutations and struggle for
survival or by a world in which there are intentions, purpose,
order and even love for our existence.40 For example, the nature
of the Bahá’í grand narrative will be in sharp contrast to the

248                                           Lights of Irfán vol. 18

atheist Marxist grand narrative or agnostic grand narrative by
the McNeil’s The Human Web: A Birds-Eye View of World
History.41 Different questions will arise for historians such as
‘What is God’s intention or desire in creation?’; ‘How is this
intention made known to us?’; ‘How do we best meet this
intention?’; ‘What kind of values are implicit in this intention?’
Furthermore, different events or kinds of events will be
important, less important or unimportant depending on the
metaphysical context.

It also follows logically that a phenomenal world with a
purpose allows us to evaluate, prioritize, judge and interpret
historical events and persons in light of that purpose which is
objectively embodied in reality. This distinguishes the Bahá’í
grand narrative from those like Marxism which attempts to
explain world history in strictly immanent, i.e. non-
transcendental and materialist terms. The problem is that
without an objective standard by which to render evaluations,
historical understanding ultimately becomes an exercise in
personal and collective subjectivity and preferences.
Furthermore, the context we choose also affects the kinds of
evidence we are or are not willing to accept; the kind of
explanations or possibilities we are willing to explore; the
interpretation of events, actions and developments; the
conclusions and judgments we draw and the values by which we
draw them; the delineation of meaning; and the attitudes with
which we approach our material. With the possible exception
of chronicles, i.e. simple lists of events or objects, it is
extremely difficult, if not impossible, to write any kind of
history without these factors coming into play to one degree or
another. It is also clear that even the effort to avoid
metaphysics and ontology in history writing lands us in an
alternate metaphysics.

It might be argued that historians do not — or should not —
mix the study of history with any school of metaphysics and its
theological implications. However, the problem with this
position is that we cannot avoid taking metaphysical — and

implicitly, theological — standpoints no matter what we do
when studying history. It is obvious that empiricism,
positivism, the scientific method et al. do not avoid
metaphysics but merely assert a different kind of metaphysics
and the implicit theologies or a-theologies. Each of the
following propositions is metaphysical — and implicitly a-
theological — to the core: (1) ‘There is no, or we can detect no,
transcendentally originated purpose in the cosmos,’ (2) ‘The
only valid and decisive evidence is physical/material evidence’
that is the same for all viewers; (3) ‘We seek only facts in
history.’ The first two propositions are manifestly metaphysical
in nature and the second is obviously self-refuting. No valid
material evidence that such is the case can be produced — even
in theory. The third statement is logically circular because those
who support it will only accept material evidence as ‘facts’ to
begin with. The argument that historians must reject ‘miracles’
i.e. divine involvement in history is also problematic — but only
if we accept Hume’s definition of miracles violating the laws of
nature.42 If, on the other hand, we define miracles statistically,
like quantum theory, we would say that a miracle is an event of
an extremely low order of probability.43 Being highly
improbable and being absolutely impossible are two different
things — and obviously a miracle is a highly improbable event.
In other words, the argument that a Bahá’í grand narrative
contaminates history with metaphysics and theology is not in
itself a valid reason to reject it because any objection
inescapably makes the same ‘error’ of at least implicitly
invoking metaphysics.

The second consequence of God’s role as Creator and
Sustainer is that the Bahá’í metanarrative connects human
history to natural history and the evolution of the universe. In
other words, mankind’s history is an intrinsic part of the
“divine milieu” 44 as Teilhard de Chardin calls it and humankind
is not as an accidental outcome of random mutations or
chemical processes. Rather, humanity is a necessary goal of
cosmic history.45 As ‘Abdu’l-Bahá says,

250                                             Lights of Irfán vol. 18

> Moreover, it is necessary that the signs of the
> perfections of the spirit appear in this world, that the
> realm of creation may bring forth endless fruits, and
> that this body of the contingent world may receive life
> and manifest the divine bounties ... So, for example, the
> rays of the sun must shine upon the earth and its heat
> must nurture all earthly beings; if the rays and heat of

> this world, it would be like a body without a spirit. By
> another token, this world is even as a tree and man as
> the fruit; without the fruit the tree would be of no use.

[SAQ ch.52]

We hardly need mention that the Writings support the
concept of intelligent design of the phenomenal world.
According to ‘Abdu’l-Bahá,

> This composition and arrangement arose, through the
> wisdom of God and His ancient might, from one natural
> order. Thus, as this composition and combination has
> been produced according to a natural order, with
> perfect soundness, following a consummate wisdom,
> and subject to a universal law, it is clear that it is a
> divine creation and not an accidental composition and
> arrangement. [SAQ ch.47]

‘Abdu’l-Bahá also speaks of the “the mysteries and creative
purposes hidden within the phenomenal world” [PUP 74]. Because
the phenomenal world is an intentional creation of God, it is
inherently imbued with a purpose, i.e. God’s purpose which is

the final cause of creation itself. The final cause directs or
guides the proximate causes — the material, efficient and
formal causes [SAQ ch.80]46 — so that they harmonize with the
final cause.

The third consequence of God’s role as Creator concerns
purpose. If creation is intended by God, it has a purpose. If
something has a purpose — especially God’s purpose — it has
intrinsic value by which to judge whether a thing and/or event
supports or opposes the divine purpose. Furthermore, because
it has intrinsic value, it also has meaning or significance or
importance for thought and action. This situation is
noteworthy for grand narratives of world history because it
implies that human history is not embedded in a fortuitous and
essentially chaotic universe but, rather, is part of a universe
with a final cause, a purpose, value and meaning. In other
words, history takes place in a “divine milieu,”47 in an
environment actualized and fashioned by God’s presence
through His divine Will and signs of His ubiquitous presence.
Showing how at least some of the major events of world history
fit into and exemplify the divine signs either by their presence
or indirectly by their absence is one of the challenges of the
Bahá’í grand narrative.

When metahistorical studies are contextualized by a “divine
milieu,” the next logical step is to discover what this purpose is
and how it is reflected in human history. Our knowledge of
purpose, value and meaning which comes primarily through the
Manifestations, provides the standards or criteria by which to
evaluate the importance of historical events. Grand narratives
that omit the intrinsic and objectively real purpose, value and
meaning of historical developments become untenable since, in
effect, they are distorting history by errors of omission. For
example, the Bahá’í Writings say that the final goal of human
history is the unification of mankind, from which it logically
follows that it is unsound and short-sighted to neglect this
information in interpreting and evaluating historical persons
and/or events. Shoghi Effendi makes such a judgment when he

252                                           Lights of Irfán vol. 18

says, that “Nation-building has come to an end” [WOB 202], a
statement which, in effect, discourages “nation building” as a
side-line of contemporary political action.48

The fourth consequences of God’s act(s) of creation is that
value is not only innate to all existence but is also objectively
real and not merely a personally subjective or even socially
subjective phenomenon. In other words, the Writings espouse
value realism, i.e. the belief that at least some values — ethical
or otherwise — do not depend on human observers, i.e. they are
not subjective individually or socially. At least some values are
objective, established in the natural world by the presence of
the signs and Names of God [SAQ ch.50]. The objectivity of these
values is confirmed by Shoghi Effendi who states that all the
Manifestations assert the “eternal verities” [PDC 108] in each
dispensation. Such “verities” are “eternal” precisely because
they endure and are objectively real, i.e. not dependent on
human opinion either individual or collective. The manner in
which these “verities” are applied diverges among dispensations
but the “verities” themselves do not. We might characterize this
situation as ‘theme and variations’ or, as ‘Abdu’l-Bahá says,
“truth is one, although its manifestations may be very
different” [PT 128]. The application of these values such as the
nature of the good, also varies with the level of creation. For
the plants, animals and humans, the value is growth to its
highest possible condition but ‘growth,’ while essentially the
same in all cases has different attributes in a plant and a human.
In other words, nature and the human history embedded in it,
are value-laden and have been so from the earliest beginnings of
the phenomenal world. This implies that the struggles of history
are unconscious or conscious efforts to attain the appropriate
good. World history has an objective ethical dimension.

A fifth consequence of divine creation is that the historical
process is essentially rational insofar as it is mandated by the
“invisible yet rational God” [WOB 112]. Thus, it is divinely
endowed with an innate purpose or goal and a correlated means
of achieving this goal, i.e. the establishment of a global federal

commonwealth united in “one common faith” achieved with the
guidance of the successive Manifestations of God and the
actualization of humanity’s intellectual and spiritual potentials.
For this reason the holy Manifestations of God appear in the
human world. They come to

> educate and illuminate mankind, to bestow spiritual
> susceptibilities, to quicken inner perceptions and
> thereby adorn the reality of man — the human temple —
> with divine graces. [PUP 330]

Bahá’u’lláh explains the necessity for an orderly development in
history:

> Know of a certainty that in every Dispensation the light
> of Divine Revelation hath been vouchsafed unto men in
> direct proportion to their spiritual capacity. Consider
> the sun. How feeble its rays the moment it appeareth
> above the horizon. How gradually its warmth and
> potency increase as it approacheth its zenith, enabling
> meanwhile all created things to adapt themselves to the
> growing intensity of its light ... Were it, all of a sudden,
> to manifest the energies latent within it, it would, no
> doubt, cause injury to all created things .... In like
> manner, if the Sun of Truth were suddenly to reveal, at
> the earliest stages of its manifestation, the full measure
> of the potencies which the providence of the Almighty
> hath bestowed upon it, the earth of human
> understanding would waste away and be consumed; for
> men's hearts would neither sustain the intensity of its
> revelation, nor be able to mirror forth the radiance of
> its light. Dismayed and overpowered, they would cease
> to exist. [GWB 87]

The divine Manifestations arrive in succession to inaugurate
new dispensations, i.e. new steps towards the ultimate goal of
world unity when humankind is socially, intellectually and
spiritually ready to take the next step. This sequential order is

254                                               Lights of Irfán vol. 18

rational in two senses of the word. First, it represents a
‘natural’ or ‘organic’ rationality in which each step is the
fulfillment of the appropriate potentials (for the goal) of the
previous step and the preparation for the actualization of the
next stage. The underlying reason for each step is that it
facilitates reaching the goal or final cause in an orderly manner.
Second, the same principle applies in logical reasoning; each
step in a chain of logical inferences must be the necessary and
sufficient condition for the next inference.49 Hegel’s belief that
the historical process functioned dialectically may have been
mistaken, but his insight that there is an underlying rational
sequence in history agrees with the Bahá’í Writings. Science also
shows that the cosmic process itself is rational and orderly
insofar as science is based on the observation that the universe
works by means of classical and statistical laws and regularities.

We hasten yet again to add that the teleological and rational
nature of the historical process does not necessarily deny
individual free will. Our collective goal is pre-determined — the
world commonwealth and the actualization of human potentials
— but this does not pre-determine any of our personal decisions
for good or bad. Morally speaking the individual remains free
to make whatever choices s/he wants:

> Certain matters are subject to the free will of man, such
> as acting with justice and fairness, or injustice and
> iniquity — in other words, the choice of good or evil
> actions. It is clear and evident that the will of man
> figures greatly in these actions ... he is free in the choice
> of good and evil actions, and it is of his own accord that
> he performs them ... All these deeds and actions are
> under his own control, and he is therefore accountable
> for them. [SAQ ch.70]

In other words, individual and collective free will operates
within the context of the teleological historical process. To put
it another way, God has determined the ultimate goal of the
historical process insofar as He has endowed humanity with the

potentials to work towards this goal, but we are personally and
collectively free to decide whether or not to strive for this goal
and by what means. Furthermore, free will also means that we
are free to do evil or to be “perverse.”

> His purpose, however, is to enable the pure in spirit and
> the detached in heart to ascend, by virtue of their own
> innate powers, unto the shores of the Most Great
> Ocean, that thereby they who seek the Beauty of the All-
> Glorious may be distinguished and separated from the
> wayward and perverse. [GWB 70, emphasis added]

God also gives us free will so that the “pure in spirit” may be
differentiated from “the wayward and the perverse” by means
of their own free moral choices.

The issue of free will inevitably raises the problem of evil.

Before proceeding, two points must be noted. First, both good
and evil acts require choices, i.e. they must be conscious and
intentional. We cannot claim to have acted virtuously because
an involuntary arm spasm caused us to swerve and avoid hitting
a man collapsed on the road in front our car. Nor can we claim
a baby committed an evil act if it accidentally poked and
blinded us in one eye. For this reason, natural disasters are not
evil since nature is not conscious and cannot form intentions.
Second, without the potential of choosing evil, our will would
not really be free. Indeed, if we were only allowed to do good
deeds, we would be robots or zombies without consciousness,
intention, choice and action. In short, we would not be human
beings and God’s creation would lack purpose. True freedom
requires the right to do wrong. The Universal House of Justice
explains,

Bahá’u’lláh also raises the possibility that possessing free
will, human beings may well commit evil and “wittingly” break
“His law.” By the exercise of his free will, man either affirms
his spiritual purpose in life or chooses to perpetuate evil by
living below his highest station. The question is asked: “Is such

256                                             Lights of Irfán vol. 18

a behaviour to be attributed to God, or to their proper selves?”
And [Bahá’u’lláh] concludes: Every good thing is of God, and
every evil thing is from yourselves [MUHJ63 663].

Genuine evil, i.e. malicious criminal acts — not tragic
accidents, oversights, good intentions gone wrong and results
of ignorance — is caused, and can only be caused by, human
beings. Along with other factors such as unforeseeable natural
disasters, tragic accidents and good intentions gone wrong, evil
is the source of the apparent irrationality of history. However,
God does not allow man-made anarchy and crime — or even
natural disasters — to divert the historical process from its
ultimate goal. Even those who disobey and defy God will
eventually discover that as the Qur’an says, “they plotted, and
God plotted; and God is the best of plotters.”50 As the Báb
states, “All are His servants and all abide by His bidding!” [SWB
216, emphasis added] In short, even their opposition will eventually
be made to serve God’s purpose. This is reminiscent of Milton’s
Paradise Lost in which God allows free will to Satan and his
fallen angels and uses their evil actions as an opportunity to
bring out greater good.51 The same idea underlies Hegel’s
concept of “the cunning of reason ... [which] sets the passions
to work for itself.”52 Bahá’ís have a concrete example of this in
our own history. The IRI sought to extirpate the Bahá’í Faith
but by driving many Bahá’ís out of Iran, it effectively spread
the Faith into more countries than ever before.

We should point out in passing that the Báb’s teaching forms
the basis of a Bahá’í theodicy, i.e. an explanation of evil and its
role in a divinely created universe. Mankind has freedom to do
ill, but God has the power to use evils for greater good. This
preserves free will in mankind and assures the advancement of
humankind. Unfortunately, we shall not be able to advance this
topic at this time.

7: Essentialism and the Bahá’í Grand Narrative

The Bahá’í Writings and the metanarrative that grows out of
them support essentialism, i.e. the philosophical view that all
things have specific nature and attributes that distinguish them
from other things in a real and objective way. According to the
Writings, all things have an essence, among them God [SAQ
ch.37]; “all created things” [SWAB 111]; the human soul [GWB 159];
humankind [SWAB 184]; justice [GWB 167]; beauty [GWB 321];
species of living things [GWB 300]; truth [GWB 328]; religion [PUP
344]; “this new age” [PUP 304]; “existence” [SWAB 157] and the
spirit [SWAB 167]. These references to the essence are even more
wide-spread once we realise that such phrases as “inmost
reality”; “the realities of,” the “inner reality,” and “inner
realities” also refer to the essence of things.53 As we shall
demonstrate below, essentialism is the logical and ontological
foundation of the doctrine of progressive revelation.

According to ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, essences cannot be known
directly and immediately by intuitive insight but can be known
only indirectly by studying their actualized attributes or
qualities:

> As our knowledge of things, even of created and limited
> ones, is of their attributes and not of their essence, how
> then can it be possible to understand in its essence the
> unbounded Reality of the Divinity? For the inner
> essence of a thing can never be known, only its
> attributes ... Thus everything is known by its attributes
> and not by its essence: Even though the human mind
> encompasses all things, and all outward things are in
> turn encompassed by it, yet the latter are unknown with
> regard to their essence and can only be known with
> regard to their attributes ... That is, as created things
> can only be known through their attributes and not in
> their essence, the reality of the Divinity, too, must be
> unknown with regard to its essence and known only with
> respect to its attributes. [SAQ ch.59]
258                                              Lights of Irfán vol. 18

The principle of knowledge by attributes even applies to God
Whose attributes are made known to us by the Manifestations.
These revelations are basis for reasoning about God.

Furthermore, there are two kinds of attributes — essential
and accidental. Essential attributes are those that a thing must
have to be the kind of thing it is e.g. three wheels to be a
tricycle. Accidental attributes are those which are “non-
essential” [TAB3 562] as illustrated in the statement that “that
which is changeable is accidental, evanescent” [PUP 416]. The
tricycle’s color can be changed and, therefore, may be seen as
“evanescent” but the necessity of three wheels is permanent or
essential. God, of course, has no accidental attributes since that
would deny His unchangeable nature and perfect unity.

The distinction between essential and accidental attributes is
the metaphysical foundation for progressive revelation.
Writing about these two aspects of the divine teachings,
‘Abdu’l-Bahá states,

> Each one of the divine religions has established two
> kinds of ordinances: the essential and the accidental. The
> essential ordinances rest upon the firm, unchanging,
> eternal foundations of the Word itself. They concern
> spiritualities, seek to stabilize morals, awaken intuitive
> susceptibilities, reveal the knowledge of God and
> inculcate the love of all mankind. The accidental laws
> concern the administration of outer human actions and
> relations, establishing rules and regulations requisite for
> the world of bodies and their control. These are ever
> subject to change and supersedure according to
> exigencies of time, place and condition. [PUP 338, emphasis
> added]

Elsewhere ‘Abdu’l-Bahá declares,

> We must remember that these changing laws are not the
> essentials; they are the accidentals of religion. The

> essential ordinances established by a Manifestation of
> God are spiritual; they concern moralities, the ethical
> development of man and faith in God. They are ideal
> and necessarily permanent — expressions of the one
> foundation and not amenable to change or
> transformation. Therefore, the fundamental basis of the
> revealed religion of God is immutable, unchanging
> throughout the centuries, not subject to the varying
> conditions of the human world. [PUP 365]

Shoghi Effendi refers to this distinction between the
essential and the accidental when he discusses the permanent
“eternal verities” that underlie all religions in contrast to the
temporary “nonessential and spurious in their teachings” [PDC
108]. In a very apt metaphor, one author calls these “eternal
verities” the “golden core”54 of religion which is different from
the accidental adaptations to a particular time and place. In the
words of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, “every one of the divine religions
contains essential ordinances, which are not subject to change,
and material ordinances, which are abrogated according to the
exigencies of time” [PUP 106]. Moreover, he adds,

> The second division comprises laws and institutions
> which provide for human needs and conditions
> according to exigencies of time and place. These are
> accidental, of no essential importance and should never
> have been made the cause and source of human
> contention. [PUP 393, emphasis added]

Here we see how the Bahá’í principle of rejecting religious
conflict of any kind is logically justified by its metaphysical
basis in the essence/accident distinction. The rejection of
religious conflict is not solely a matter of good will towards
men but also a matter of logical reasoning.55 This also
demonstrates ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s dictum that “The world of minds
corresponds with the world of hearts” [PUP 270] insofar as our

260                                             Lights of Irfán vol. 18

good will towards humankind is correlated to rational
philosophical principles.

The essence/attribute distinction allows us to avoid the
apparent contradiction between the “eternal verities” which are
absolute and unchangeable and Shoghi Effendi’s statement that
“religious truth is not absolute but relative, that Divine
Revelation is progressive, not final” [WOB 58; cf. PDC Preface]. The
seeming self-contradiction is solved by recalling that the
changes affect the accidental or culture-bound attributes of a
revelation and not in its permanent inner essence or “eternal
verities.” This distinction meets the requirements of both
stability and growth. The “eternal verities” provide a stable
foundation for knowledge and faith, without which, ethics
would be inescapably reduced to subjectivity and preference.
The accidental qualities allow — under the guidance of the
Manifestation for a specific age — adaptation of the essentials
to various cultural conditions.

8: The Ontology of Potentials

Another aspect of the metaphysics underlying the Bahá’í
grand narrative of world history is the ontology of potentials
which characterizes the nature of created things. The ontology
of potentials — which has its roots in Aristotle56 — states that
(1) all things are characterized or defined by particular set of
potentials or changes they can or cannot undergo; (2) this set of
potentials is their essence as a member of a species or group
and as a unique individual within that group; (3) all things seek
to actualize their potentials to an optimal degree illustrating
thereby the principle of perfectibility which is especially true of
the human soul [PT 85]. This principle is at work in the doctrine
of progressive revelation which depends on continual progress
in our self-actualization to operate. Let us examine an example
of these ideas. At birth, a puppy has a certain set of potentials
that make it (a) a member of the dog species and (b) a specific
set of potentials that make it a particular puppy. No matter

what happens, it has no potentials to become a grasshopper or a
duck. No amount of tinkering with the puppy’s environment
and education can change this. During its life-time, a dog can
actualize its potentials for protection, playing Frisbee and
Flyball and obeying certain commands. However, few if any
beings — dogs or humans — exist long enough to actualize their
full potentials for which reason unactualized attributes and
potentials are necessary aspects of their essence. In that sense,
there is a mystery in all created beings.

The Writings make it clear that potentials are not small
physical ‘things’ embedded in an entity like raisins in a bun.57
According to ‘Abdu’l-Bahá potentials are present but not
visible or apparent: “from the beginning of its formation, all of
these [branches and leaves] existed potentially, albeit invisibly,
in the seed” [SAQ ch.51]. Elsewhere he states,

> One of the functions of the sun is to quicken and reveal
> the hidden realities of the kingdoms of existence.
> Through the light and heat of the great central luminary,
> all that is potential in the earth is awakened and comes
> forth into the realm of the visible. [PUP 74, emphasis added;
> cf. PUP 186]

The Writings reject strict empiricism in which being real is
equivalent to being perceptible [SAQ ch.16], and assert the
existence of “intellectual realities” which “do not exist
outwardly ... that is to say, intellectual realities which are not
sensible, and which have no outward existence” [PUP 186, emphasis
added]. Furthermore, since potentials are an aspect of an entity’s
essence, and the essence of things is not available for direct
human knowledge [SAQ ch.74] it seems to follow that, like
essences, the potentials of things are known by their qualities or
attributes, i.e. by their effects in the world. In themselves they
are not unperceivable — although their effects may be well
known and predictable. In the sciences, the subject of non-
sensible and unpredictable potentials, i.e. hidden, undetectable
possibilities is covered by the subject of ‘emergence.’ For

262                                              Lights of Irfán vol. 18

example, nothing in oxygen and hydrogen atoms provides
empirical evidence that the combination of these atoms, i.e.
water, will (1) be transparent; (2) be a liquid and (3) will expand
when cooled below 4 degrees C unlike all other materials. This
and other examples of emergence — the symmetrical and fractal
based patterns of snowflakes for example — support the Bahá’í
view of the reality of potentials.

The ontology of potentials is essential to the Bahá’í grand
narrative insofar as it grounds the concept of the perfectibility
of man which is itself essential to the doctrine of progressive
revelation. According to Bahá’u’lláh we must “Regard man as a
mine rich in gems of inestimable value. Education can, alone,
cause it to reveal its treasures, and enable mankind to benefit
therefrom” [GWB 259]. Bahá’u’lláh informs us that only
education can actualize these gem-like potentials and make
them visible, and, thereby allow us to fulfill His command that
“All men have been created to carry forward an ever-advancing
civilization” [GWB 214]. It is important to notice the universal
and categorical term “all” which tells us there are no exceptions
to this purpose. The actualization of potentials and most
especially the actualization of the higher spiritual potentials are
vital to the goal of the unification of humankind. Only by
striving for self-transcendence and self-overcoming can this
goal be reached [PUP 143].

> Only by improving spiritually as well as materially can
> we make any real progress, and become perfect beings.
> It was in order to bring this spiritual life and light into
> the world that all the great Teachers have appeared.
> They came so that the Sun of Truth might be
> manifested, and shine in the hearts of men, and that
> through its wondrous power men might attain unto
> Everlasting Light. [PT 63]

In this passage, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá connects the three concepts of
spiritual and material progress with the doctrine of progressive
revelation as initiated and guided by God’s Manifestations.

The ontology of potentials is the basis of an objective
standard by which to measure human progress, i.e. the degree to
which potentials have been actualized in any given individual or
society. In regards to individuals — including ourselves —
‘Abdu’l-Bahá says,

> The only real difference that exists between people is
> that they are at various stages of development. Some are
> imperfect — these must be brought to perfection. Some
> are asleep — they must be awakened; some are negligent
> — they must be roused; but one and all are the children
> of God. Love them all with your whole heart; no one is a
> stranger to the other, all are friends. [PT 171]

This can be applied not only to individuals who, for
whatever reason, have not actualized their potentials but also
to cultures and nations, as seen in ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s question
about Persia: “Must she now, for this contemptible sloth, this
failure to struggle, this utter ignorance, be accounted the most
backward of nations?” [SDC 8] Similarly, he says of Paris, and by
extension, the West, that “her spiritual progress is far behind
that of her material civilization” [PT 27]. Shoghi Effendi refers
to “backward peoples” [UD 25] in various parts of the world.
The objective standard by which to assess progress is the degree
to which this person, or this culture have actualized or
expanded the actualization of their latent potentials. From a
Bahá’í perspective, the answer seems clear: advanced individuals
or cultures are those which have actualized the most potentials
and provided more opportunities for more people to develop
their potentials, i.e. their “inestimable gems.”

However, it must be emphasized that the actualization of
potentials must not be one-sided, especially in the materialist
direction:

> I want to make you understand that material progress
> and spiritual progress are two very different things, and
> that only if material progress goes hand in hand with
264                                           Lights of Irfán vol. 18

> spirituality can any real progress come about ... The
> laws of God may be likened unto the soul and material
> progress unto the body. If the body was not animated
> by the soul, it would cease to exist. It is my earnest
> prayer that spirituality may ever grow and increase in
> the world, so that customs may become enlightened and
> peace and concord may be established. [PT 108]

In other words, progress consists of the actualization of our
material, intellectual and above all our spiritual potentials to
the greatest degree possible in the greatest possible number of
people. Of course, in light of the final goal of world history,
we are all spiritually and/or materially “backward,” albeit not
necessarily in equal measure.

9: Controversies about Grand Narratives

Grand narratives are sharply criticized and strenuously
rejected by contemporary historians, postmodern philosophers
and cultural studies scholars. Since the Bahá’í Writings
explicitly present a grand narrative, it is, in my view,
imperative to understand at least some of these critiques and
the possible answers — especially those from the Bahá’í
Writings. Such knowledge is not only valuable to Bahá’ís
engaged in teaching or apologetics but also to scholars of
comparative religion and philosophy.

Ever since the publication of Spengler’s Decline of the West
(1919) and Toynbee’s A Study of History (1934–1961) grand
narratives have been a highly controversial subject among
philosophers, historians and cultural studies scholars. Among
the philosophers, Karl Popper, an influential philosopher of
science, was the most persistent and systematic opponent who
not only rejected grand narratives as intellectually mistaken but
also as a potent source of evil. In The Poverty of Historicism
(1957) and The Open Society and Its Enemies (1962) Popper
strives to undermine the philosophical underpinnings which

make grand narratives possible. In so doing, he anticipates most
of the postmodernist — e.g. Lyotard — critiques about the
“totalization”58 and “terrorism”59 supposedly inflicted by
metanarratives.

In The Poverty of Historicism and The Open Society and Its
Enemies Popper blames metanarratives from Plato to Hegel and
Marx for the rise of totalitarian regimes in Fascist Italy, Nazi
Germany and Communist Russia. In fact, he dedicated The
Poverty of Historicism to all those who “fell victim to the
fascist and communist belief in Inexorable Laws of Historical
Destiny.”60 His objection to grand narratives and the implied
ability to predict — or identify possible or probable
developments — is that grand narratives lead to all the
associated ills of totalitarianism: omnipresent state planning;
gleichschaltung, i.e. an enforced coordination of all aspects of
public and private life; and the reduction of the individual to a
mere means or tool of the state. For Popper grand narratives
have no redeeming features.

According to Popper, grand narratives (although the term
had not yet been invented) are a part of “historicism” which he
defines as

> an approach to the social sciences which assumes that
> historical prediction is their principal aim, and which
> assumes that this aim is attainable by discovering the
> ‘rhythms’ or the ‘patterns’ the ‘laws’ or the ‘trends’ that
> underlie the evolution of history.61

In Popper’s view, there are no laws manifested in history,
which means, in effect, there are no regularities, patterns or
trends to be seen and, therefore, no grand narratives to be
established. Therefore, “History has no meaning.”62 Because it
has “no meaning” it has no goals or even a general direction, i.e.
is not teleological. He continues, saying that, “There is no
history of mankind, there is only an indefinite number of
histories of all kinds of aspects of human life.”63 With this

266                                           Lights of Irfán vol. 18

statement, Popper, like the postmodernists, asserts a
nominalistic view of history by breaking up all concepts of a
universal ‘human history’ into a multitude of smaller individual
histories of localities, nations and so on. Toynbee aptly
describes Popper’s view as “antinomian”64 insofar as the
historical process is not subject to any regularity or law.

In light of our foregoing discussion of the Bahá’í grand
narrative, the clash between the Bahá’í teachings and Popper’s
views are inescapable. However, in our view, none of Popper’s
critiques of metanarratives are especially salient.

The first weakness is blatant self-contradiction at the most
fundamental level: to make his complaint about ‘historicism’
and grand narratives, Popper indulges in ‘historicism’ himself.
He claims that there are no predictable patterns in history and
yet he asserts the existence of such patterns on the basis of
historical events in Fascist Italy, Nazi Germany and Communist
Russia and then predicts that such grand narratives necessarily
and inevitably lead to totalitarian states. If history has no
pattern and cannot be predicted, on what basis does he make
his prediction? And without evidence, i.e. patterns or laws — or
even the possibility of evidence — why should we accept his
word? On this score, Popper’s argument is logically flawed and
unpersuasive.

There is a second weakness, namely, if history is too complex
to allow grand generalizations or grand narratives of history,
then there is no basis for Popper’s thesis that history lacks
order and is too complex to be known. How could he know this
if history is too complex to be knowable? Such a judgment
already pre-supposes a complete knowledge of history —
something he says is beyond us. The most he can say is that he
can discover no order — but it does not logically follow
therefrom that no order exists. Nor is his inability to find an
order in history logically sufficient to reject all other attempts
to disclose such order and meaning. In short, Popper asserts but
he does not prove.

A third weakness is that Popper’s denial of meaning in
history is, in effect, no more than a proposal for a different
meaning of history, i.e. for an alternate grand narrative of the
historical process even though his argument supposedly forbids
metanarratives. To say that human actions lack order and
meaning and exhibit no value or purpose is, in effect, an
alternative interpretation of history, albeit a negative one. This
is no logical caprice such as claiming that ‘nothing’ is
‘something.’ Popper’s negative metanarrative resembles
positive metanarratives insofar they both embed a certain set
of beliefs, principles and values and both prohibit certain other
views. In short, both function in a similar manner. Popper’s
grand narrative endorses or at least encourages a particular set
of beliefs and values, i.e. those usually associated with atheist
secular humanism which recognizes humankind as the only
source of values and only the physical as real.

Despite his arguments against grand narratives, Popper still
feels the need for some sensed of meaning in history: “Although
history has no ends, we can impose these ends of ours upon it;
and although history has no meaning, we can give it a
meaning.”65 Unfortunately, there is an obvious problem here. If
we know that the historical process is intrinsically chaotic and
complex beyond all human understanding, it is difficult to see
how we can successfully “impose” our own order on it. Either
this man-made order is entirely fictional and, therefore,
dubious, or it reflects or connects to something real in the
historical process. However, in the latter case Popper’s
rejection of grand narratives would be at least partially false,
i.e. there is at least some genuine order we can connect with.

The fourth — and the most important problem with Popper’s
theories — is clear by reference to the Bahá’í Writings: history
is turbulent and sometimes even chaotic but there is one
constant throughout: human nature. The essential oneness of
human nature is the field on which all the historical turmoil
plays out. Whatever the historical events, the responses are
inevitably shaped and limited by human nature itself. As W.H.

268                                            Lights of Irfán vol. 18

Walsh notes, “history is properly concerned with human
experiences,”66 adding that “History is intelligible ... because it
is a manifestation of mind.”67 History is constituted by our
understandings of and reactions to what we experience. R.G.
Collingwood expresses the same idea as follows: “For history,
the object to be discovered is not the mere event, but the
thought expressed in it.”68 Thought, “the object to be
discovered” is also shaped and limited by human nature no less
than action. The conclusion is inescapable: the human mind —
or the “rational soul” as the Bahá’í Writings call it — is the
underlying common denominator that unifies all the various
histories of humankind. W.H. Walsh concludes that “[A]
fundamental set of generalizations, belonging to the science of
human nature, is presupposed in all historical work.”69

The unity of human nature is a foundational principle of the
Bahá’í Writings. It is most obviously evident at the physical
level. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá says,

> When we observe the human world, we find various
> collective expressions of unity therein. For instance,
> man is distinguished from the animal by his degree, or
> kingdom. This comprehensive distinction includes all the
> posterity of Adam and constitutes one great household
> or human family, which may be considered the
> fundamental or physical unity of mankind. [PUP 190,
> emphasis added]

In other words, human nature as a whole is distinguished from
animal nature and, therefore, humans make up one family that
illustrates “the physical unity of mankind.” The sciences
provide decisive evidence for this “physical unity.” It is self-
evident that medical science, i.e. doctors, surgeons,
physiologists and pharmacologists study the same basic texts
the world over because our physiological processes and organs
are essentially the same regardless of ethnic origins. Moreover,
in the 1950’s, humanist psychologist Abraham Maslow
established his widely influential70 hierarchy of physical, psycho-

social and even spiritual needs which characterize human nature
everywhere.71 All humans have D-needs for survival — air,
water, food, shelter, protection, appropriate clothing and
opportunities to look after ourselves — and B-needs which we
need not to survive but to thrive, to be fulfilled as specifically
human individuals. Among these needs are purpose and
meaning, friendship and appreciation.

Further evidence for the essential oneness of mankind comes
from anthropology and cognitive science. As noted by
prominent anthropologist Donald E Brown in Human
Universals, “human biology is a key to understanding many
human universals.”72 In The Blank Slate: The Modern Denial of
Human Nature, Steven Pinker, a cognitive scientist, explores
the philosophical history leading to the rejection of the concept
of a universal human nature. Based on but also extending the
work of Donald Brown, he lists over three hundred traits as
universal.73

The Bahá’í Writings also inform us that the universal
attributes of humankind are not only physical but also spiritual
and intellectual:

> The human spirit, which distinguishes man from the
> animal, is the rational soul, and these two terms — the
> human spirit and the rational soul — designate one and
> the same thing. This spirit, which in the terminology of
> the philosophers is called the rational soul, encompasses
> all things and as far as human capacity permits. [SAQ
> ch.55]

The message is clear: regardless of culture, time, place or
circumstance, all people share one human nature because they
all have a rational soul. We also share a higher, spiritual nature
and a lower animal nature which the higher nature must control.
In addition, we all possess “spiritual susceptibilities” [PUP 339]
which must be cultivated in order to make spiritual progress
possible. Since there is a universal human nature, it must be

270                                            Lights of Irfán vol. 18

manifested in historical human actions. Indeed, a universal
ethic is also possible because of our universal human nature
insofar as at least some ethical rules apply to everyone at all
times and in all places. God being the creator of human nature,
means that no one is better qualified than He to establish what
this ethic is. As Shoghi Effendi notes, all the Manifestations
teach the “eternal verities” [PDC 107]. Consequently, objective
and cross-cultural moral standards exist across all cultures,
places, times and circumstances.

Not only is human nature universal, it is also stable over
time, i.e. it is historically stable. This is evident in Shoghi
Effendi’s statement that the successive Manifestations “restate
the eternal verities” [PDC 108] over the course of human history.
If human nature changed, then the “eternal verities” would not
be relevant through historical changes. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, reinforces
this point when, writing of evolution, he says that man’s
“species and essence undergo no change” [SAQ 183]. In short,
human nature is constant. The actualization of hidden and
latent potentials is not, of course, a change in nature but a
fulfillment or completion of our nature. Such actualization of
potentials is what occurs during the historical process that, in
the Bahá’í grand narrative, culminates in a world-wide federal
commonwealth united by “one common faith.”

Another criticism of grand narratives is that they do not
follow the methods of ‘scientific history.’ The demand for
‘scientific history’ is itself problematic and, therefore, weak. It
is hard to know what this demand is supposed to mean. Clearly,
grand narratives cannot follow the methods of the experimental
sciences though it can follow the scientific method of forming
a hypothesis, gathering evidence, testing the hypothesis and
then arriving at a conclusion. However, as we shall see, the
three writers examined by this study — Spengler, Toynbee and
Sorokin — fulfill the requirements of the scientific method.

However, if by ‘scientific’ we mean limiting all conclusions
to what can be directly and literally documented, then R.G.

Collingwood makes the obvious point that history is more than
just documentable events and is the history of “the thoughts
out of which these events grew?”74 Elsewhere he says, history
cannot be limited to external events. William H McNeil
expresses this issue more dramatically, commenting that “ink-
soiled paper does not and never has embraced all the parameters
of human life with which historians might appropriately
concern themselves.”75 William H Dray notes, “For it is surely
the historian’s task ... not only to establish the facts, but to
understand them. And this will involve him in giving
explanations.”76 Explanations require interpretations and
interpretations lead to judgments. He adds,

> Application of the evidence criterion to history isn’t
> contentious: we do not find theorists arguing that
> history should be written in contravention of the
> evidence. Nonetheless, to ask how and to what extent
> the evidence should guide historical accounts does
> permit substantive debate ... The extent to which
> historical accounts are constrained by the evidence
> invites consideration of the question of under-
> determination. It may be that historical accounts are
> determined by the evidence to a significantly lesser
> extent than are scientific accounts; in particular in so
> far as those historical accounts are interpretive or
> narrative.77

Other criticisms of grand narratives assert that they require
the marginalization of certain knowledge, beliefs, and peoples
as individuals or groups. This critique is invalid insofar as the
Bahá’í teachings reject the marginalization of people(s) and
argue for the essential oneness of mankind. However the
marginalization of people(s) is not the same thing as the
marginalization of ideas and knowledge-claims. Marginalizing
individuals qua individuals cannot be justified but, the entire
concept of ‘progress’ which is integral to the Writings (see
below) necessitates leaving some knowledge behind as mistaken,

272                                           Lights of Irfán vol. 18

impractical, malevolent or even “the outcome[s] of human
perversity” [GWB 217] as Bahá’u’lláh says of “a few” religions.
The rejection and marginalization of human beings and the
rejection and marginalization of ideas, knowledge, beliefs and
customs are not at all the same things. Bahá’u’lláh’s foregoing
words about some religions as the “outcome[s] of human
perversity” demonstrates, the Bahá’í Writings themselves show
no hesitation in rejecting certain beliefs as false and
superstitious and, in the case of a few religions, even perverse.
Indeed, the Writings clearly acknowledge the existence of
“error” [SAQ ch.46], “idle fancies and vain imagining” [ESW 15],
“ignorance” [SAQ ch.60], “heedlessness and superstition” [PB 95],
and even “absurd” [TAF 18] i.e. illogical arguments. Furthermore,
Bahá’u’lláh advises us to “meditate profoundly ...so that light
may be distinguished from darkness, truth from falsehood,
right from wrong, guidance from error, happiness from misery,
and roses from thorns” [KI 8]. In other words, the Writings
clearly assert that not all claims to know the truth are really
true, or, conversely, that some views and opinions, no matter
how passionately held are simply wrong and must be rejected if
humankind is to make progress. Indeed, the whole concept of
progress which plays such an essential role in the Writings,
means that some knowledge, some beliefs, some practices must
be abandoned, i.e. permanently marginalized. Bahá’u’lláh’s
assertion that “All men have been created to carry forward an
ever-advancing civilization” [GWB 214] virtually requires us to
leave behind all those beliefs, attitudes, loyalties and practices
that hinder progress, and most notably, those that hinder
progress towards the unification of humankind. His statement
also requires us to recognize that humanity as a whole shares the
same divinely given task.

A final critique of grand narratives is that they artificially
impose a pattern or agenda on the historical process. It is
difficult to understand this critique since to one degree or
another, all histories except, perhaps, the simplest lists of
names or events can avoid some ‘imposition’ on their material.

However, even with simple chronologies we cannot avoid some
choice of what to include and leave out and, thereby, the
judgments and interpretations entailed by such selection. All
histories must do this and even more: making choices about
what to accept as evidence (documents, oral traditions, eye
witnesses, logical deductions); judging importance and
relevance; and identifying meanings and implications. Thus,
making imposing patterns a special misdeed for grand
narratives is an obvious case of special pleading. Imposing an
‘agenda’ is no unique sin of metanarratives. Nor is it necessarily
dishonest or obfuscating if we are open about writing to prove
a certain viewpoint. Such statements of intent allow readers to
investigate for themselves and form independent judgments.
Moreover, criticizing an author like Toynbee for finding
religious truths illustrated in history seems hypocritical in light
of the respectful reception given to Marxists like Eric
Hawbsbawn and E.P. Thompson. Marxism itself is a grand
narrative and those who work within the Marxist metanarrative
are fleshing out smaller fragments of it. In our view, the
common sense attitude to this issue lies with Sebastian
Conrad’s defense that the concept of world history is, in
principle, no less viable than other, more limited,
historiographical theories and practices.78 Such efforts are not
inherently and necessarily flawed and, therefore, cannot be
rejected a priori.

10: Global Grand Narratives

To help us understand the nature of grand narratives of
global history in particular, we must reflect on two inter-
connected problems — scale and order. All global grand
narratives claim that if we study history on a world scale we
will be able to observe patterns of that are not visible at sub-
global scales. However, this leads to a problem with other
historians who work with smaller units of study such as nations.
Georg Iggers writes that world historians like Fukuyama and
Huntington are not

274                                              Lights of Irfán vol. 18

> eyes, most clearly in the scientific, technological and ...
> economic spheres, and ... [modernization] has
> transformed societies globally ... [and] must be taken
> seriously on a world scale.79

Sebastian Conrad makes a similar point arguing that contrary
to what opponents80 of grand narratives assert,

> No unit [local, national, global] of study is inherently
> superior ... No unit is the one and only true unit of
> inquiry. What is more, different units direct our
> attention to different processes. Different units ... are
> not only different windows on the same subject, but
> each window allows us to see processes that might not
> have come into view through another window. The
> common criticism that the grand narratives get the
> details wrong is beside the point — they aim at larger
> processes and trends.81

In other words, there are some kinds of historical knowledge
we can only obtain by taking an expansive, global view. This is
not difficult to illustrate. A close sociological study of a single
family lets us focus very specifically on individual situations,
self-images, familial dynamics, motives and actions among
other things. We acquire detailed knowledge of individuals.
However, such a narrow study does not tell us much about the

trends and patterns in family life at the regional or even
national level. Indeed, at the smaller scale, such knowledge is
not available for observation. In statistics it is established that
a small sample size is unreliable for drawing general conclusions
about very large groups of people because some causal factors,
correlations, trends and patterns only become significant when
the sample size is sufficiently large. Appropriate sample size
also washes out the outliers, those anomalies that can easily
distort the knowledge we get from small scale studies. The
difference in gathering knowledge at different scales is why
historian William H McNeil states, “historian’s fixity of
attention on national and local affairs is misleading.”82
Similarly, Sebastian Conrad explains, “Global history thus
acknowledges the causal relevance of factors that do not lie
within the purview of individuals, nations, and civilizations.”83
What the foregoing discussion suggests is that insisting that
only one scale or perspective is valid, denies us access to
knowledge that may be essential to humankind.

Sebastian Conrad rejects complaints about grand narratives
getting factual details wrong as being “beside the point”84
because grand narratives “aim at larger processes and trends.”85
Larger processes or statistical sample sizes are not as sensitive
to errors in detail as smaller processes and sample sizes where
they can have undue influence on a smaller pool of data.
Conrad makes the same point about errors allegedly found in
meta-historians like Arnold Toynbee and Oswald Spengler. By
itself, the existence of the outlier or detail error is not enough
to disprove anything in large scale studies. W.H. Walsh makes
the same point by saying that in the sphere of global history “a
man can be wrong in detail and sound in essentials.”86 To assert
that an outlier or error invalidates a general trend or pattern or
a grand narrative, we must show in each case the reasons why
this difference causes a severe distortion in the pattern that has
been found. The mere assertion of error is not enough.

We shall now get into more details of the Bahá’í grand
narrative in comparing and contrasting them with the work of
Spengler, Toynbee and Sorokin.

PART II

The Bahá’í Grand Narrative and Spengler,

Toynbee and Sorokin
Oswald Spengler’s two-volume The Decline of the West
published in Germany in 1918 is one of the best known
metanarratives of the 20th Century. Despite the largely academic
controversies surrounding this two volume magnum opus, it is
still widely available in various translations and in both book
and e-format which suggests that it still arouses considerable
interest. In 1952, H. Stuart Hughes wrote that despite the
“bitter invective, icy scorn, urbane mockery or simply
pretending that it is not there,”87 Spengler’s work continues to
attract readers and generate “intellectual excitement.”88 Half a
century later, Neil McInnes’s article “The Great Doomsayer”89
provides a cavalcade of the major contemporary thinkers who
have been influenced by Spengler, despite his continued poor
reputation amongst academics. Among them we find Francis
Fukuyama, author of The End of History and The Origins of
Political Order; Hans Robert Jauss, the originator of reception
theory; Henry Kissinger; F. Scott Fitzgerald; and Michael
Foucault.90 Others include Joseph Campbell, Northrop Frye,
Theodor Adorno, Ludwig Wittgenstein, Martin Heidegger,
Camille Paglia, Ernest Hemingway and Hans Morgenthau.91 His
far-reaching influence alone makes his ideas worth careful
study. Adda B Bozeman notes this need for more careful study
in “Decline of the West? Spengler Reconsidered.”92 W. Reed
Smith explains Spengler’s and Toynbee’s contemporary
relevance in his 2009 article “Megalopolis versus Social
Retardation: The Continuing Relevance of the Views of
Spengler and Toynbee on the Variability of the Rate of Cultural

Change.”93 Mehdi Mozafari’s Globalization and Civilization
also notes Spengler’s wide-ranging influence on contemporary
thought.94 Neil McInnes points out that if nothing else, “there
gradually arose after Spengler a sustained interest in what was
variously called the science of civilization, cultural studies and
comparative macrosociology.”95 A renewed appraisal of
Spengler’s continued relevance was published in 2001 by John
Farrenkopf, a professor of history and political science.96 This
curious contrast between Spengler’s negative reception among
academic historians and his wide-spread influence among major
writers, diplomats and thinkers is something that requires
further exploration. Such a serious disconnect suggest that
something important is being overlooked in his work. Later, we
shall see that the same may be said of Arnold Toynbee.

In outline, Spengler’s theory is clear. The first issue to note
is Spengler’s distinction between ‘Culture’ and ‘civilization.’ As
such, this distinction does not exist in the Bahá’í Writings. For
Spengler, Culture is the phase in which all later civilizations
have their start; according to Spengler, “The Civilization is the
inevitable destiny of the Culture.”97 The transition from
Culture to Civilization is “the victory of the inorganic
megalopolis over the organic countryside which was
henceforward to become spiritually ‘the provinces.’ “98 W. Reed
Smith notes,

> The California wine country may still be semi-rural, but
> it is nevertheless thoroughly megalopolitan in outlook
> and lifestyle. One can live in rural Mississippi and still
> be thoroughly megalopolitan in outlook. Indeed,
> megalopolitanism is a world-view, a way of life; and
> although it is springing forth from the overgrown urban
> centers such as New York and Los Angeles, it cannot and
> should not be misunderstood to be somehow limited to
> people living within the city limits of the great cities.99

Culture contains all the potentials that it and its subsequent
civilization can actualize. It is the time of true creativity in all

278                                              Lights of Irfán vol. 18

areas of human endeavor and a time genuinely experienced
religiosity. Perhaps the most basic aspect of a culture is its
“world-feeling”100 i.e. its feeling about the nature of reality as,
for example, being inherently alive, or inherently sacred or as
am image of a greater reality, or, as in materialism, inherently
utterly passive or ‘dead.’ This underlying “world-feeling” shapes
all of a culture’s artistic, intellectual and practical activities.
What Spengler says about mathematics and different theories
of number in the following passage is true of everything else:

> We find an Indian, an Arabian, a Classical, a Western
> type of mathematical thought and, corresponding with
> each, a type of number — each type fundamentally
> peculiar and unique, an expression of a specific world-
> feeling, a symbol having a specific validity which is even
> capable of scientific definition, a principle of ordering
> the Become which reflects the central essence of one and
> only one soul, viz., the soul of that particular Culture.101

Another important aspect of the “world-feeling” is the
“Destiny-idea [in which] the soul reveals its world-longing, its
desire to rise into the light, to accomplish and actualize its
vocation.”102 Spengler believes that the eight ‘high cultures’ he
has selected possess the “Destiny-idea” to a superlative degree
although he admits that “to no man is it entirely alien.”103 In
other words, both individuals and cultures possess a “Destiny-
idea” at least during their growing cultural phases. For
Spengler, “world-feeling,” “Destiny-idea” and “prime symbol”
are connected.

> the Destiny-idea manifests itself in every line of a life.
> With it alone do we become members of a particular
> Culture, whose members are connected by a common

> its outer world through the symbol of extension; and
> thenceforth this symbol is and remains the prime symbol
> of that life, imparting to it its specific style and the
> historical form in which it progressively actualizes its
> inward possibilities.104

The “prime symbol” which is connected to the “world-
feeling” and “Destiny-idea” grows out of the intuitions of
space and time whose importance has been grossly
underestimated by academic historians.105 For the Classical or
Apollonian Greek world, time and space were a single point in
the present as illustrated for example in ancient Greek drama.
Greek drama required (1) unity of time: the action could take
no more time than the duration of the play; (2) unity of space:
the action could not require a change of scene; (3) unity of
action: there could only be one action/plot with only minimal
subplots, if any. Throughout The Decline of the West, Spengler
shows how Greek culture, e.g. mathematics and art reflected
their prime symbol of ‘one-ness.’ Greek philosophy, for
example, was heavily focussed on the problems of the one and
the many, being and becoming, essence and attribute — all of
which are aspects of their prime symbol. Western, or Faustian
culture’s prime symbol was “an infinitely wide and profound
three dimensional space”106 as reflected in the invention of
calculus, i.e. the mathematics of movement and approaching
infinity; in invention of multi-dimensional, i.e. unlimited
geometries, and the fugue which is an attempt at infinite
complexity in music. The Magian or Arab, Hebrew and Iranian
prime symbol is a cavern which exhibit the

> “Semitic” primary-dualism which , ever the same under
> its thousand forms, fills the Magian world. The light
> shines through the cavern and battlers against the
> darkness [John i, 5]. Both are Magian substances. Up and
> down, heaven and earth become powers that have entity
> and contends with one another.107
280                                              Lights of Irfán vol. 18

In more general terms, the Magian Cavern is an inherently
mysterious place inhabited by enigmatic and shadowy beings
whose cryptic struggles are reflected in the sinewy complexities
of Arabesques and in the transformations of algebra.

As in the Bahá’í Writings, each culture and civilization lasts
about one thousand years the last centuries of which are a
hardening of flexible creative culture into a civilization which
marks the final phase of its existence. Moreover, each culture is
an organic entity that passes through its phases of development
without any chance of deviation. In human terms, this process
resembles human growth, from birth, to childhood,
adolescence, youth, adulthood and old age. More commonly,
though, Spengler uses the seasonal cycle as his organic analog;
here, too, there is no chance of avoiding the inevitable. No act
or cultural-political program can deflect this order. The last
season — the one in which Spengler locates us — is winter,
which is dominated by dominated by technology,
commercialism and vulgarity. It is in the winter phase that the
“Destiny-idea” is “overpowered by matter-of-fact feeling and
mechanizing thought.”108 In other words, most people no longer
have any ability to conceive of themselves anything more than
physical beings with a super-natural destiny of vocation. They
feel soul-less and rootless who confuse being lost with being
free. This time of confusion gives rise to a period of “let’s
pretend” spirituality or what Spengler today would call ‘new
age hocus pocus,’ along with the mock-spirituality of
Hollywood supernaturalism intended to entertain. However,

> [t]he fact that the latter [pseudo spirituality] is possible
> at all foreshadows a new and genuine spirit of seeking
> that declares itself, first quietly, but soon emphatically
> and openly, in the civilized waking consciousness ...
> [However] The material of the Second religiousness is
> simply that of the first, genuine, young religiousness.109

He also sees the loss of genuine religiosity as a sign of the
autumn and winter season, i.e. taking over a culture:

> It is this extinction of living inner religiousness, which
> gradually tells upon even the most insignificant element
> in a man's being, that becomes phenomenal in the
> historical world-picture at the turn from the Culture to
> the Civilization, the Climacteric of the Culture, as I
> have already called it, the time of change in which a
> mankind loses its spiritual fruitfulness for ever, and
> building takes the place of begetting. Unfruitfulness —

> “race-suicide” of the civilized and rootless strata,
> phenomenon not peculiar to ourselves but already
> observed and deplored — and of course not remedied —
> in Imperial Rome and Imperial China.110

As a civilization approaches its end, it also experiences a
“Second Religiousness”111 which is marked by a “deep piety.”112
However,

282                                            Lights of Irfán vol. 18

Because all cultures pass through the same life-cycle in the
same seasonal order for roughly the same length of time, the
meaning of the word ‘contemporary’ is decisively altered
inasmuch as events may be separated by a thousand years, but if
they occur at the same phase or season in the life cycle of two
cultures, these events are ‘contemporary.’ For example,
Spengler sees Julius Caesar and Napoleon as contemporaries
because they fulfilled the same basic role at the same point in
the seasonal cycle albeit it in different cultures. Both mark the
beginning of the winter season of their cultures.114
Furthermore, the history of a culture is predictable insofar as
the specific phases of development can be foretold as well as
the sub-phases, such as the “second Religiousness” or, in the
last phases of civilization, “Caesarism” i.e. the rule of strong
leaders able to impose their will on society as well as the rule of
money. Ironically, Caesarism “grows on the soil of
Democracy”115 although it eventually asserts itself over popular
will, money or aristocracy. According to Spengler, the West is
now in the middle of its winter or civilizational phase.

As cultures harden into the winter of civilization, the
“destiny-idea” in individuals is replaced by “matter-of-fact-
feeling and mechanizing thought.”116 Spengler does not limit the
“Destiny-idea” to any particular race, class, nation or culture.
The eight “high Cultures” he mentions are simply the
outstanding achievers among humanity. The intuited “Destiny-
idea” “manifests itself in every line of a life”117 and connects us
by a common world-feeling and a common world-form”118 to
the culture in which we live. For Spengler, destiny is more
important than external causality because destiny is what we
choose to do as opposed to what is forced upon us. Our
intuition of time and space becomes “the prime symbol of that
[cultural] life, imparting to it its specific style and the
historical form in which it progressively actualizes its inward
possibilities.”119 The hidden influence of the “prime symbol”
shapes all aspects of life in every culture as it actualizes its
potentials.

According to Spengler, “High Cultures” are the true focus of
historical studies, not nations, races, states or empires. The
latter are subunits of what Spengler calls “High Culture”120
which are subject to the seasonal cycles. There have been eight
major cultures in the past: the Babylonian, Egyptian, Chinese,
Indian, Mayan/Aztec, Classical Greco-Roman, Arabian
(including Jewish and Persian) or Magian, Western or Euro-
American. These are “high Cultures.”121

> The group of the high Cultures is not, as a group, an
> organic unit. That they have happened in just this
> number, at just these places and times, is, for the human
> eye, an incident without deeper intelligibility.122

This list demonstrates two important aspects of Spengler’s
theory of history. First, not all cultures are “High Cultures” i.e.
cultures with a strongly developed “Destiny-idea” and the
subsequent unity and strength that grow out of this idea.
Second, “High Culture” is not dependent on a biological
conception of race as shown by the presence of only one
Western or Euro-American High Culture. In fact, Spengler had
no use for biological and darwinian concepts of race, and, like
Nietzsche, thought of ‘race’ as a matter of character, style and
form, and tradition.123 His list includes no African cultures —
he does not, of course, think Egyptian culture was Black —
because from his perspective no “High Cultures” existed in
Africa. As the rest of his list shows, biological race was not a
factor in this judgment. His contempt for Hitler — despite the
Nazis’ attempt to enlist Spengler as a fore-runner — is wittily
summarized by his statement that Germany needs a hero, “not a
heroic tenor.”124 In regards to the Jews, he viewed the tensions
between Jewish and Christians as being about cultural heritage,
not blood.

The foregoing examples of Spengler’s method of historical
study reveal three important aspects of his work.

284                                             Lights of Irfán vol. 18

First, he unequivocally rejects the linear view of history as a
progressive sequence from ancient to modern with its implied
superiority of Western culture. He regards this as a distorted
view of history.125 In Spengler’s view, there is no progress in
history — cultures simply go through their life-cycle but they
are not working towards anything but the actualization of their
potentials as their natural goal. The Writings and Spengler are
in glaring disagreement about progress as indicated by the
Bahá’í doctrine of progressive revelation and Bahá’u’lláh’s
statement that “All men have been created to carry forward an
ever-advancing civilization” [GWB 214]. However, this progress
is not confined to any one particular culture but — as the
‘Amazonian’ metaphor of the Bahá’í grand narrative suggests —
historical progress is made up of tributary contributions from
different cultures at different times. No one culture or people
bears the entire burden of making progress. However, the
progress made by humankind is objectively real and the
Writings set an objective standard for assessing progress in
both individuals and cultures: the degree of actualization of
inherent physical, intellectual and spiritual capacities. More
advanced cultures actualize more potentials in more people
than less advanced cultures. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, implicitly applies
this standard when he speaks of some peoples and tribes as
practicing “savageries” [SAQ ch.77] and proceeding to the
necessity for education i.e. actualization of the intellectual and
spiritual capacities to lift them out of this condition. He asks,
rhetorically,

> How long shall we drift on the wings of passion and
> vain desire; how long shall we spend our days like
> barbarians in the depths of ignorance and abomination?
> God has given us eyes, that we may look about us at the
> world, and lay hold of whatsoever will further
> civilization and the arts of living. He has given us ears,
> that we may hear and profit by the wisdom of scholars
> and philosophers and arise to promote and practice it.

[SDC 3, emphasis added]

In contrast, Spengler does not think that any such standards
among cultures and civilizations exist and, therefore, there is
no such thing as ‘progress’ in history. He is unable to do so
because the monadic nature of each culture and civilization
make impossible the application of any common standard of
assessment.

Second, Spengler rejects the limitations of ‘scientific’
history, i.e., the belief that

> history joins astronomy and volcanology in being an
> evidentially but non-experimental discipline ...
> Nonetheless, to ask how and to what extent the evidence
> should guide historical accounts does permit substantive
> debate ... It may be that historical accounts are
> determined by the evidence to a significantly lesser
> extent than are scientific accounts; in particular in so
> far as those historical accounts are interpretive or
> narrative.126

Historical understanding based strictly on material evidence
is, in Spengler’s view, inappropriate and insufficient for dealing
with the complexities and depths of human thought, feeling,
personal and socio-political action values, religion and culture.
Concepts like “world-feeling,” “Destiny-idea” and “prime
symbol” play an extremely important role in the inner, often
unconscious motivation for actions, beliefs and values. That is
why, in his view, we also need intuition, empathy and
‘einfuehlung’127 (‘feeling our way into the life and perspective
of another being’) are necessary in the process of
understanding, explaining and interpreting history.128 Because
history is made by humans, we need not only facts but also
assessment and interpretation of facts and their implications.
In other words, according to Spengler, the ‘hard’ basic facts of
history are necessary but not sufficient to understand the past
that humans make. This conclusion has a major impact on how
we view — and write — history.

286                                            Lights of Irfán vol. 18

In regards to historical methodologies, there is a clear
convergence — though not full agreement — between the Bahá’í
Writings and Spengler. Both agree that by themselves,
“materialistic’ methodologies and attitudes,”129 i.e. methods and
attitudes limited to what can be known via documents or other
physical evidence — are insufficient for an adequate
understanding of the past. Humanity cannot be understood by
way of its physical remnants alone. However, the Writings go
further than Spengler (or Dilthey) insofar as they see the
necessity of developing our “spiritual susceptibilities” which
includes “the quickening of mental capacity” [PUP 340]. With
such a spiritually-based “quickening” of our intellects historians
will be able gain new, and hitherto invisible, insights into the
historical process. In other words, clinging to the “materialist
methodologies” hinders the progress of acquiring historical
insights both for Spengler and the Bahá’í Writings.

Third, Spengler studied history not on the basis of sequential
events and cause-and-effect relationships but rather on the
basis of forms, structures and functions, or, as he put it,
“morphologically.”130 He completely rejects the division of
history into ancient, medieval, renaissance and modern as being
Euro-centric and, thereby, distorted. Instead, he focussed on
the repetitions that occurred as cultures went through the
various phases in their life-cycles. His morphological studies
examine the forms, structures and functions in which cultures
express their ideas, feelings, art, sciences, religion and politics
among others. He found there are amazing correspondences and
analogs between unalike cultures in the same phases of
existence.

One of the most controversial aspects of Spengler’s theory is
that each culture is self-contained and can neither influence or
be influenced by other cultures. To paraphrase St. Thomas
Aquinas, the reason is that whatever influence is received from
the outside, is always received in the terms of the receiver’s
beliefs131 i.e. in ways that the receiver can understand. This is
also because each culture has its own “world-feeling,”132

“Destiny-Idea”      and    “prime     symbol”    are    essentially
incomprehensible to other cultures. Their fundamental “world-
feelings,” “Destiny-ideas” and “prime symbols” are too
different for that to happen. Each culture can only see other
cultures from its own perspective and, therefore, never really
‘contact’ or understand the other culture in itself.133 The
influence that is ‘sent out’ is not the same as the influence that
arrives. Intercultural influence as usually understood does not
occur. Furthermore, [c]onnotations are not transferable”134 are
an enormous part of any culture’s communication. Because
each culture is essentially isolated each culture also has its own
character that shapes all aspects of its life, beginning with the
“world-feeling” and including the sciences, arts, philosophy,
mathematics, music and religion. The Bahá’í Writings, as will be
shown below, reveal the serious short-coming of this view.

One of the unavoidable consequences of that cultures are
self-enclosed monads is a strong epistemological and ethical
relativism. ‘Truth’ is truth for one culture — there are no
universal truths just as there is no universal good. As we shall
see later, Spengler undermines his own position in this regard
by positing a number of universal attributes of humans and
cultures.

11: Comparing the Bahá’í Writings with Spengler

One of the first questions we might ask vis-a-vis the Bahá’í
Writings and Spengler is if there are any correlations with
Spengler’s “Destiny-idea,” “world-feeling,” and “prime symbol.
In our view, the strongest such correlation concerns the
“Destiny-idea.” The Bahá’í Writings exemplify the concept of
“Destiny-Idea” insofar as the Manifestations have a general and
a unique mission that that informs all cultures They inaugurate.
‘Abdu’l-Bahá declares that

> The mission of the Prophets, the revelation of the Holy
> Books, the manifestation of the heavenly Teachers and
288                                             Lights of Irfán vol. 18

> the purpose of divine philosophy all center in the
> training of the human realities so that they may become
> clear and pure as mirrors and reflect the light and love
> of the Sun of Reality. [PUP 60, emphasis added]

This is the general mission of all Manifestations. However,
each Manifestation also has a unique mission within the
historical process. In addition to their station of “essential
unity” [GWB 52] the Manifestations have another station.

> The other station is the station of distinction, and
> pertaineth to the world of creation, and to the
> limitations thereof. In this respect, each Manifestation
> of God hath a distinct individuality, a definitely
> prescribed mission, a predestined revelation, and
> specially designated limitations. [GWB 52, emphasis added]

From this perspective, each culture inaugurated by the
Manifestation has a general purpose or mission and a particular
task in achieving the general mission. In this way a “Destiny-
idea” is imparted to the cultures receiving guidance from the
Manifestations.

In our understanding, the Writings also exemplify what
Spengler calls “world-feeling,” i.e. our attitude and feelings
about the world around us. For example, it is possible to have a
“world-feeling” of mistrust as in Sartrean existentialism, a
power struggle as in Marxism or Fascism, or disenchantment as
in much modern literature and philosophy. The fact that all
things but especially humanity exemplify the names of God is,
indeed, a “re-enchantment of the world”135 as a sacred place,
and all beings as fundamentally sacred. Every being is a moment
of divine revelation in its own way.

> How resplendent the luminaries of knowledge that shine
> in an atom, and how vast the oceans of wisdom that
> surge within a drop! To a supreme degree is this true of
> man, who, among all created things, hath been invested

> with the robe of such gifts, and hath been singled out
> for the glory of such distinction. For in him are
> potentially revealed all the attributes and names of God
> to a degree that no other created being hath excelled or
> surpassed. [GWB 176]

In our view, Bahá’u’lláh’s statement expresses the Bahá’í
“world-feeling” of the sacred nature of reality and the high
station of humankind and its spiritual vocation and destiny.
This “world-feeling” pervades the Writings and should pervade
Bahá’í life. Indeed, this statement is a potent encapsulation of
many Bahá’í teachings as well as the Bahá’í “world-feeling.”

In the Bahá’í Writings, the “prime symbol” as Spengler uses
it, is ‘light’ which implicitly includes space since light has to be
‘somewhere,’ i.e. perceived in some perceptual or conceptual
space. (Spengler’s “prime symbol” involves varying intuition of
space.) The pervasive sun, light and dark imagery used
throughout the Writings; the emanationist metaphysics
associated with the image of the sun136; and the importance of
‘planes’ suggest — to this author at least — that light is the
underlying symbol of the Writings.

Another concept important to Spengler is ‘pseudomorphosis’
which happens when

> an older alien culture lies so massively over the land that
> a young Culture, born in the land cannot get its breath
> and fails not only to achieve pure and specific
> expression forms, but even to develop its own self-
> consciousness.137

This concept has some obvious similarities to post-colonial
situations in which an alien culture smothers or almost
smothers a newer culture struggling for existence. Although the
concept of pseudomorphosis has no counterparts in the
Writings, it is relevant in another, pragmatic way. It serves to
alert us to the temptation or danger of allowing “an attempt [to

290                                           Lights of Irfán vol. 18

be] made to impose, on the Bahá’í community's own study of
the Revelation, exclusively materialistic methodologies and
attitudes antithetical to its [the Faith’s] very nature.”138 A
pseudomorphosis is precisely what might happen if such an
imposition of “a purely materialistic interpretation of reality
[were] imposed on scholarly activity of every kind, at least in
the Western world.”139 Those who support such a “materialistic
framework ... have even gone so far as to stigmatize whoever
proposes a variation of these [materialistic] methods as wishing
to obscure the truth rather than unveil it.”140 To forestall a
pseudomorphosis — at least in the culture of scholarship — it is
necessary to avoid undue reliance and trust on “materialistic
methodologies.”

Perhaps the most important similarity between the Bahá’í
grand narrative and Spengler are the concepts of societies, the
world, cultures and civilizations as being organic in nature. In
other words, they embody highly complex inter-active
relationships that transcend the mere sum of their constituent
parts. The underlying belief that the Writings and Spengler
share is that society is more than a collection of atomic, i.e.
separate and distinct individuals who are not intrinsically
connected in any way. Rather, society has an emergent
character, i.e. a nature or essence that cannot be reduced to its
constituent parts. A classic illustration of emergent
characteristics is water which has qualities and behaviors that
cannot be reduced to or predicted from oxygen and hydrogen
by themselves. When two hydrogen and one oxygen atom are
joined, a whole new level or plane of reality becomes manifest
with new, hitherto unknowable attributes such a liquidity and
expansion when frozen. The organic view of society makes the
same point about groups of individuals. Bahá’u’lláh points to
this organic nature of society when He says, “Regard the world
as the human body” [GWB 254]. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá speaks of “the
great body of human society” [PUP 233, SDC 33, PDC 122].

The seasonal analogy supports the organic view of society
insofar as we are expected to take it seriously as a model for a

natural process it directs our analysis and judgment into that
direction. Moreover, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá relates the physical and
spiritual seasons in Some Answered Questions in a series of
passages too long to quote here [SAQ ch.14]. In this section, he
explains the correspondences between the physical and spiritual
seasons. After explaining the physical and spiritual spring,
summer and autumn, he says,

> Winter arrives — that is, the chill of ignorance and
> unawareness envelops the world, and the darkness of
> wayward and selfish desires prevails. Apathy and
> defiance ensue, with indolence and folly, baseness and
> animal qualities, coldness and stone-like torpor, even as
> in the wintertime when the terrestrial globe is deprived
> of the influence of the rays of the sun and becomes
> waste and desolate. Once the realm of minds and
> thoughts reaches this stage, there remains naught but
> perpetual death and unending non-existence. [SAQ ch.14]

It must be noted that “nonexistence” in the Writings is
relative, i.e. it means ‘existent’ or ‘nonexistent’ relative to
something that is higher or lower in the scale of being, For
example, the human world is nonexistent from the perspective
of the mineral world because the mineral world cannot perceive
and comprehend mankind’s existence [SAQ ch67]. The spiritual
world of the “rational soul” does not exist for the animal soul.
In other words, by living more according to their “animal
instincts” and not according to the “rational soul,” people slip
into ‘nonexistence’ in regard to their specifically human
capacities.

Spengler agrees that societies and cultures are organic in
nature. H. Stuart Hughes writes,

> Spengler called his method ‘morphological.’ That is, it
> represented an application to history of the biologists’
> concept of living forms. Each culture, in his view, was
> an organism, which like any other living thing went
292                                              Lights of Irfán vol. 18

As already noted, the Writings accept the organic “conceptual
frame” for thinking about culture.

In addition to the seasonal metaphor, the Writings also use
the metaphor of human growth from birth to old age as an
explanatory principle in understanding the life-cycles of
societies and cultures. For example, Shoghi Effendi writes

> The long ages of infancy and childhood, through which
> the human race had to pass, have receded into the
> background. Humanity is now experiencing the
> commotions invariably associated with the most
> turbulent stage of its evolution, the stage of

> superseded by the calmness, the wisdom, and the
> maturity that characterize the stage of manhood. Then
> will the human race reach that stature of ripeness which
> will enable it to acquire all the powers and capacities
> upon which its ultimate development must depend.

[WOB 202]

Obviously, the seasonal and the human growth metaphor
deliver the same message: societies and cultures are living things
and go through the appropriate phases of development and,
eventually, die. Such a life course applies to all living things, i.e.
is predictable. The Writings and Spengler agree on this issue.

Predictability is one of the most controversial issues in
regards to historical metanarratives. Can historians predict
future events and/or developments? Of course, Bahá’u’lláh can

do so — and does so in His letters to the monarchs of Europe —
but He is a Manifestation with privileged access to timeless
knowledge. Ordinary historians lack such divine insight.
However, they can — if they wish — make use of three sources
of information to make well informed guesses about the general
course of coming events. The first is the recognition of
repeating patterns in the past, for example, all cultures undergo
birth and death; power struggles occur within them; the deaths
are often violent. There is a long history of historians finding
various patterns even in our time as seen in the rise of “Big
History” and Global History142 as an academic discipline and
such publications as The Human Web by two distinguished
historians.143 These studies provide positive reasons for
believing such patterns are real.

The belief that there are patterns in the historical process is
supported by the universality of human nature. The Bahá’í
Writings recognize the oneness of human nature explicitly,
while Spengler’s vision of detailed correspondences in the
phases of eight unconnected “High Cultures” implicitly pre-
supposes the universality of human nature. The Bahá’í Writings
go even further — they predict specifics such as the decline and
degeneration of religion and civil society, the arrival of a new
Manifestation and the persecution and ‘war’ against the new
faith. The exact outward attributes of these events depends on
time, place and situation but the essential events re-occur. That
is because human beings are specific kinds of entities and,
therefore, have a wide but limited range of responses to
situations. There are, for example, only so many ways to deal
with a severe drought: we can stay and try to survive; we can
migrate to better weather; we can make deals for food e.g.
labor; we can wait for others to donate food; or we can plunder
food from other groups either by raids or outright conquest.
Since human nature is universal, i.e. human responses to various
situations fall within certain parameters — as we see in clinical
and social psychology — we would logically expect repeating

294                                             Lights of Irfán vol. 18

patterns and a resulting ability to predict the future, at least in
outline.

The third support for belief in historical patterns comes
from the organic nature of society. Like all other organisms and
organizations, societies have needs that must be met for
survival. For example, as the Writings indicate, unity or social
cohesion based on a common goal and/or world-view; they also
need structure and a willingness to work within it [MBW 103]. It
is possible to predict that if these needs are not met, society
will disintegrate.

The organic metaphors have a number of far-reaching con
sequences in regards to our understanding of cultures and
history. One of the most important is how they shape the
relationship between the individual in society, especially in
regards to freedom. To exist, organisms require a balance
between the nature and the interests of the individual and the
nature and interests of the whole, i.e. society. Cancer, for
example, is precisely the result of this balance being lost and
individual cells going out of control, act only for their own
interests and, thereby, destroy the organism itself. In short, it is
an excess of individual ‘liberty’ by one part at the expense of
the whole. That, i.e. the necessity of “reciprocity” [PUP 338], in
organic systems is why the Bahá’í Writings do not present
individual liberty as an isolated end-in-itself that over-rides all
other values under all circumstances. It is an important value
but not the only one and, therefore, must be balanced with
others. For that reason, Bahá’u’lláh states, “We approve of
liberty in certain circumstances, and refuse to sanction it in
others” [GWB 335]. He adds,

> Consider for instance such things as liberty, civilization
> and the like. However much men of understanding may
> favorably regard them, they will, if carried to excess,
> exercise a pernicious influence upon men. [GWB 216]

Indeed, He goes on to warn us that “If carried to excess,
civilization will prove as prolific a source of evil as it had been
of goodness when kept within the restraints of moderation”
[GWB 342].

He also states,

> Liberty must, in the end, lead to sedition, whose flames
> none can quench. Thus warneth you He Who is the
> Reckoner, the All-Knowing. Know ye that the
> embodiment of liberty and its symbol is the animal. That
> which beseemeth man is submission unto such restraints
> as will protect him from his own ignorance ... Liberty
> causeth man to overstep the bounds of propriety, and to
> infringe on the dignity of his station. It debaseth him to
> the level of extreme depravity and wickedness ... We
> approve of liberty in certain circumstances, and refuse
> to sanction it in others. We, verily, are the All-
> Knowing. [GWB 335, emphasis added]

In our understanding of this declaration, the rights of the
individual should not extend to the point of damaging the
society on which s/he depends, or to demean “the dignity of his
station” as a human being. Spengler has similar ideas about
freedom of which he says, “now what is understood by freedom
is in fact indiscipline,”144 which rejects the “submission” we
need to act in accordance with our “dignity.” Elsewhere,
Spengler says, that people want “freedom from something;”145
i.e. something that “is always, purely negative. It consists in the
repudiation of tradition, dynasty, Caliphate.”146 These words
imply, that freedom — as stated by Bahá’u’lláh — needs to be
‘disciplined,’ i.e. kept within proper bounds in order not to
become a destructive part of the social organism.

As noted above, cultures and dispensations inevitably decay
and die and will be replaced. Bahá’u’lláh and Spengler agree that
not only modern Western civilization but also the world as a
whole is in its final stages of its winter phase and requires

296                                           Lights of Irfán vol. 18

renewal. At first sight, and certainly judged by the title,
Spengler’s views are confined to the western civilization.
Appearances to the contrary, it must be observed that the term
‘West’ is no longer as geographically confined as it once was.
This can be observed in the domination of western science and
technology as well as their products and impacts on thought,
feelings, attitudes, expectations and tastes in arts and
entertainment. Spengler’s concerns about the effects of science
and technology can also be applied globally to virtually all other
cultures and civilizations. In other words, many of the
symptoms of decline can be discovered in all modern societies
which to a large extent are all westernized and thus susceptible
to Spengler’s analysis. Consequently, there are good reasons to
see Spengler’s study as having global relevance and working in
support of Bahá’u’lláh’s descriptions of the global winter
phase.

However, it is important to recall that the disintegration of
an old world order does not mean ‘total destruction’ of
everything it has achieved and contributes to the advancement
of mankind. There is genuine good in current civilization of the
West as well as the world that is worth preserving. We cannot
contribute to “an ever-advancing civilization” [GWB 214] if we
constantly reject and abandon the achievements of the past and
cannot use them to make progress in the future. In short, we
must accept the good of the past and re-think it in light of
Bahá’u’lláh’s revelation.

Spengler tries to comfort us by saying that there is nothing
we can do about our current situation147 and that like ancient
Rome, the time for greatness in art, philosophy and great
literature is past, and that engineers, physical scientists,
financiers and inventors are the genuinely pre-eminent
‘philosophers’ of our time.148 He sums up his view by saying
“We have descended from the perspective of the bird to that of
a frog.”149 I suspect ‘Abdu’l-Bahá would approve of this
metaphor which suggests we have fallen from a spiritual or

transcendental view of the world to a lower, strictly materialist
view of reality.

Living in the winter or old age of a culture is extraordinarily
difficult even if we know that a new and even greater will arise
from the ruins of the old. Shoghi Effendi refers to the

> steadily deepening crisis which mankind is traversing, on
> the morrow of the severest ordeal it has yet suffered,
> and the attendant tribulations and commotions which a
> travailing age must necessarily experience, as a prelude
> to the birth of the new World Order, destined to rise
> upon the ruins of a tottering civilization. [CF 39]

Bahá’u’lláh predicts the world’s “perversity will long
continue [GWB 118, emphasis added]. Statements like these are not
negativistic but, on the contrary, are intended encourage an
‘evolutionary attitude.’ Such an attitude ensures we do not
become obsessively attached to any particular cultural or
dispensational form and defend it as the necessary and final
form a society or a religion can take. These dire predictions
may also be seen as an intellectual anti-dote against clinging to
the past. We might also see it as an on-going reminder to
remain humble. In summary, this life-cycle model of history
emphasizes that cultures and dispensations are both unique and
limited in the potentials they have to actualize and that cultural
death is normal. Shoghi Effendi makes a similar point about the
fall — and rise — of cultures saying,

> Such simultaneous processes of rise and of fall, of
> integration and of disintegration, of order and chaos,
> with their continuous and reciprocal reactions on each
> other, are but aspects of a greater Plan, one and
> indivisible, whose Source is God, whose author is
> Bahá’u’lláh, the theater of whose operations is the entire
> planet, and whose ultimate objectives are the unity of
> the human race and the peace of all mankind. [ADJ 72]
298                                            Lights of Irfán vol. 18

However, the Bahá’í Writings differ from Spengler insofar
as they note that the exhaustion and fall of one civilization is
closely connected to the rise of a new one through the influence
of a new Manifestation. The new culture originates with the
inspirational power of a new Manifestation until it, too, is
exhausted and disintegrates.150 This sequence of events
constitutes the basis of progressive revelation which is another
Bahá’í concept incompatible with Spengler’s grand narrative. In
his view, there is no progress in any human activities; instead,
there is only an accumulation of absolutely irreconcilable
creations rooted in different “world-feelings,” “Destiny-ideas,”
and “prime symbols.” Consequently, Spengler advocates
epistemological and ethical relativism because he does not
believe there is any objective, ‘Archimedean point’ from which
to judge as to truth and morality. On this score, too, he is in
conflict with the Bahá’í Writings which see the Manifestation
i.e. Bahá’u’lláh, as being such an ‘Archimedean point.’
Moreover, Spengler’s relativism also requires him to reject
progressive revelation since the idea of progress entails making
epistemological and moral judgments about the value, moral
legitimacy and truthfulness of cultural practices and
achievements. However, Spengler’s relativism must not be
conflated and confused with Shoghi Effendi’s statement that
for Bahá’ís, “religious truth is not absolute but relative” [WOB
115]. In our understanding, Shoghi Effendi refers to the manner
in which “religious truth” is expressed is “relative,” i.e. adapted
for specific times, places and circumstances without suggesting
that the essential religious truths, the “eternal verities” [PDC

108], are dependent on us or our situations.

Indeed, unlike the Writings, Spengler sees no connection
between the rise and falls of the “high Cultures” and in that
sense, history is random and irrational. In his view, no real
contact between cultures and civilizations is possible. The
Bahá’í Writings, on the other hand, see the fall of one
civilization as the necessary prelude to the ascent of the next.
Precisely because the destruction of the old is necessary for the

construction of the new. Speaking            of   contemporary
Christianity, Shoghi Effendi states, it

> weakened, and was contributing, in an increasing measure,
> its share to the process of general disintegration — a
> process that must necessarily precede the fundamental
> reconstruction of human society. [WOB 186]

In regards to these twin disintegrative and integrative
processes, Shoghi Effendi notes,

> How striking, how edifying the contrast between the
> process of slow and steady consolidation that
> characterizes the growth of its infant strength and the
> devastating onrush of the forces of disintegration that
> are assailing the outworn institutions, both religious and
> secular, of present-day society! [WOB 154]

In other words, in the Bahá’í grand narrative correlates a
process of disintegration with a process of construction and
integration, both of which work simultaneously because both
have the same immediate cause, viz. a new dispensation
inaugurated by a new Manifestation of God. The disintegrative
phase is also necessary because without it, the new dispensation
and culture would have no space to grow and expand.

Knowledge of the twin processes also gives Bahá’í a
confidence in life in the contemporary historical processes and,
thereby, protection against depression, despair and the
temptations of nihilism in regards to the future. Unfortunately,
in Spengler’s theory of cultures as isolated monads and no
connection between the fall and rise of cultures, such
pessimism, despair and nihilism come all too easily. We should
also note at this point that Spengler’s concept of a “Second
Religiousness” does not correspond to the arrival of a new
Manifestation and surge of new spiritual energy; rather, it
refers to a fresh but uncreative burst of enthusiasm for old

300                                              Lights of Irfán vol. 18

religious forms and in that sense is a reactionary not
revolutionary development.

Despite the foregoing differences, the Writings and Spengler
agree that cultures and civilizations are based in religion and
succumbs with the fall of religion:

> Every soul has religion, which is only another word for
> its existence. All living forms in which it expresses itself
> — all arts, doctrines, customs, all metaphysical and
> mathematical form-worlds, all ornament, every column
> and verse and idea — are ultimately religious, and must
> be so ... As the essence of every Culture is religion, so —
> and consequently — the essence of every Civilization is
> irreligion — the two words are synonymous ... It is this
> extinction of living inner religiousness, which gradually
> tells upon even the most insignificant element in a man's
> being, that becomes phenomenal in the historical world-
> picture at the turn from the Culture to the Civilization
> the Climacteric of the Culture ... the time of change in
> which a mankind loses its spiritual fruitfulness for ever,
> and building takes the place of begetting ... the change
> manifests itself not only in the extinction of great art,
> of great courtesy, of great formal thought, of the great
> style in all things, but also quite carnally in the
> childlessness and “race-suicide” of the civilized and
> rootless strata, a phenomenon not peculiar to ourselves
> but already observed and deplored — and of course not
> remedied — in Imperial Rome and Imperial China.152

The Bahá’í Writings see “Divine Revelation” and the cultures
that arise from it, as “orderly, continuous and progressive and
not spasmodic or final” [WOB 115]. In other words, the
Manifestations do not appear in accidental order but appear
according to the evolutionary needs of humankind. As we have
already mentioned above, the Bahá’í view is that history is
rational, not fortuitous, and teleological and not aimless. By

contrast, no inherent order exists between the rise and fall of
Spengler’s “High Cultures.”

The various issue considered above lead to an important
question, viz. ‘Is it useful to us to know about historical
patterns and the possibility of predicting them?’ First, it seems
obvious that we can expect different attitudes and actions
between a world-view that sees history as having some
explainable order and one that sees history as a haphazard
sequence of events. Bahá’í who sees the twin processes of
disintegration and construction at work now and in the past,
will actually be able to view the current world situation with an
attitude of hope, a sense of meaning, a clear sense of values, a
clear commitment to purposive action and a sense of
compassion for those who flounder in confusion in the changes
of our time. Such knowledge provides understanding of our
spiritual, social and political environment and with such
understanding comes a certain sense of control; confidence; an
enhanced capacity to analyze, assess and judge. In other words,
it enhances our capacity for rational thought and — sometimes
–for rational action. These psycho-spiritual assets may seem
trivial when limited to an individual but can have enormous
socio-political impact if wide-spread throughout society. It
might conceivably affect leadership decisions — although we
find this unlikely given the need for popularity to win
elections. However, the understanding facilitated by a
knowledge of future historical phases, allows us to evaluate
current developments and policies vis-à-vis the inevitable
changes that must come.

Historical patterns enable us to make predictions about the
future but we must still determine if these predictions are
general and/or specific. Knowing in which season we are e.g.
winter allows us to predict some of the phenomena mentioned
in the Writings, as the attributes of the winter season:

> When that Sun reaches its zenith it begins to decline,
> and that summer season of the spirit is followed by
302                                              Lights of Irfán vol. 18

> autumn. Growth and development are arrested; soft
> breezes turn into blighting winds; and the season of
> dearth and want dissipates the vitality and beauty of the
> gardens, the fields, and the bowers. That is, spiritual
> attractions vanish, divine qualities decay, the radiance
> of the hearts is dimmed, the spirituality of the souls is
> dulled, virtues become vices, and sanctity and purity are
> no more. Of the law of God naught remains but a name,
> and of the divine teachings naught but an outward
> form. The foundations of the religion of God are
> destroyed and annihilated, mere customs and traditions
> take their place, divisions appear, and steadfastness is
> changed into perplexity. Spirits die away, hearts wither,
> and souls languish. [SAQ ch.14]

Shoghi Effendi is even more explicit about the general trends:

> The signs of moral downfall, consequent to the
> dethronement of religion and the enthronement of these
> usurping idols, are too numerous and too patent for
> even a superficial observer of the state of present-day
> society to fail to notice. The spread of lawlessness, of
> drunkenness, of gambling, and of crime; the inordinate
> love of pleasure, of riches, and other earthly vanities;
> the laxity in morals, revealing itself in the irresponsible
> attitude towards marriage, in the weakening of parental
> control, in the rising tide of divorce, in the
> deterioration in the standard of literature and of the
> press, and in the advocacy of theories that are the very
> negation of purity, of morality and chastity — these
> evidences of moral decadence, invading both the East
> and the West, permeating every stratum of society, and
> instilling their poison in its members of both sexes,
> young and old alike, blacken still further the scroll upon
> which are inscribed the manifold transgressions of an
> unrepentant humanity. [PDC 114]

However, while general trends and patterns may be
predictable, nothing either in the Writings or Spengler allows us
to make specific predictions about future events. Of course,
this applies to us and not to Bahá’u’lláh, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá and
Shoghi Effendi. Bahá’u’lláh, for example, foretold specific
events like the catastrophes awaiting France and Germany and
the downfall of Sultan Abdu’l-Aziz.

12: Toynbee and the Bahá’í Grand Narrative

Arnold Toynbee is one of the most controversial historians
of the 20th Century, the main reason for this being his twelve
volume magnum opus A Study of History, published between
1934 and 1961. In the years before he died, Toynbee, with the
aid of Third Reich historian Jane Caplan, released a huge one
volume abridgement of his twelve volume magnum opus in
which he gave his final responses to criticisms and made final
adjustments to his ideas. This is the text to which we shall
generally refer because it represents Toynbee’s thought in its
final form. When necessary, we shall consult his original twelve
volume work. An incredibly prolific author, Toynbee also
wrote more than a dozen works about history and
historiography. It is worth noting that decades before Edward
Said and post-colonial studies, Toynbee was sharply critical of
the West’s representation of Islamic history and cultures.

The reception of Toynbee’s A Study of History was and
remains sharply divided. He is the only historian to have been
on the cover of Time magazine (March 17, 1947) which
indicates just how famous he had become — and still is —
among the general public. During the 1990’s, his advocacy of a
civilizational rather than national approach to history has
gained “renewed currency”153 with the rise in academia of Big
History, Global History, World Systems Theory and the World
History Association. Sebastian Conrad’s book, What is Global
History? suggests that in light of social, economic and cultural
globalization, civilizational not national studies of history not

304                                           Lights of Irfán vol. 18

only will but must come to the fore. Particularly noteworthy on
this issue are the words of J R McNeil and William H McNeil,
who write in The Human Web that history shows clear patterns
of increasing development and expansion in communication,
trade, ideas, and competition throughout history. They write,
“So the general direction of history has been toward greater and
greater social cooperation — both voluntary and compelled —
driven by the realities of social competition.”154 This statement
strikes a Bahá’í ‘note’ for three reasons. First, it asserts that
history has a “direction” or goal; second, it harmonizes with
Shoghi Effendi’s statements about the expansion of the social
units, i.e. the expansion of co-operation; third, this
development will occur with or without the consent or wishes
of the historical actors. As the Báb says, “All are His servants
and all abide by His bidding!” [SWB 216] From a Bahá’í
standpoint, the only major omission here is failure to refer to
the Manifestations. These new developments in historiography
suggest that Toynbee — and Spengler and Sorokin — had simply
been too far ahead of his time for a majority of academics.

Among academic historians, however, the response to his
work rangers from open hostility and even mockery to
respectful and carefully reasoned disagreement. According to
H. Trevor-Roper, Toynbee was “the Messiah” of his own
concocted “religion of Mish-Mash … his mind is ... fundamentally
anti-rational and illiberal.”155 Trevor-Roper misreads Toynbee as
saying that we should “all creep back under the skirts of a
received medieval church.”156 In contrast to Trevor-Roper’s
spleen, we have the respectful but rigorous critique of W.H.
Walsh, an important philosopher of history who asks if “any
amount of historical knowledge can serve as an adequate
ground of such deductions about the meaning of history as are
drawn here?”157 The problem with this question concerns what is
included “historical knowledge.” Toynbee, like Spengler, answer
this important question by showing the limits of strictly
empirical knowledge and the need for empathy, intuition, and
judgment in understanding history and acquiring “historical

knowledge.” Pieter Geyl is similarly meticulous but respectful
in his criticism of “apriorism”158 i.e. Toynbee’s imposition of
his ideas upon the historical materials. There is one major
problem with this critique. First, it is easy to make but virtually
impossible to prove. The extreme wealth of historical data in
Toynbee’s twelve volume opus does not support the belief that
Toynbee’s schema did not develop from or engagement with his
empirical studies. It is not credible to assert that such breadth
and depth of engagement did not play a major role in the
formation of his schema. In fact, we know empirical evidence
played a key role in shaping his ideas because they led Toynbee
to revise his conclusions in Volume 12 and in his personal one
volume abridgement. Second, the apriorism critique can be
made of almost any historical study, because bare facts seldom
simply ‘speak for themselves’ — they must be evaluated and
understood and doing so requires bringing other, external
concepts to bear. The Holocaust (Shoa) provides a classic
example. There is no physical document of any kind linking
Hitler personally to the Wannsee Conference (January, 1942)
when the decision to annihilate European Jewry was made. The
diaries of Goebbels, Hitler’s closest confidant, and Hitler’s
Table Talk mention nothing about this. What does this fact tell
us by itself? Contrary to what Holocaust deniers say, this fact
tells us very little. To understand this fact, we must bring in
not only facts but, among other things, our empathy, intuition
and “Einfuehlung” — all non-empirical factors — to make sense
of this.

Let us now turn to Toynbee’s grand narrative in outline. One
of the most obvious similarities concerns the structure of the
historical process. As we understand them, the Bahá’í Writings
combine a two-fold pattern in the unfolding of civilizations:
the “circle of life” as The Lion King calls it, with a cycle of
seasons, birth and death, and the linear progress as seen in
“progressive revelation.” We have previously described this as
an expanding stretch out spiral, or, in Toynbee’s terms as a
chariot’s wheels and axle. In Toynbee’s words, the wheel and

306                                              Lights of Irfán vol. 18

axle of a chariot is such that “under the repetitive movement of
the wheel ... the vehicle ... attains its unique realization ... and
its unique goal.”159 This common structure of the historical
process is significant for three reasons. First, it means that
history is not a random process, a mere sequence of events
without any long-term structure, direction or goal.
Appearances to the contrary, history is teleological and has
order. This is significant because of the tremendous effect the
realization of such order has on the world-views of both
individuals and collectives. In turn, this affects life choices,
values, motivation, conduct and virtually all other aspects of
the human psyche. For proof we need look no further than the
tremendous motivating effect Marx’s equally teleological
theory of history had on his followers and their willingness to
suffer and sacrifice.

Second, these models of history mean that history — at least
in its broad strokes — is predictable, especially if we are aware
of our position — such as winter or a period of moral
disintegration — in the process. We can, as a minimum, know
what sort of developments to expect. Finally, because we can,
at least broadly, predict future developments, we are also better
equipped to serve the needs of our time. As Bahá’u’lláh says,
“Be anxiously concerned with the needs of the age ye live in,
and center your deliberations on its exigencies and
requirements” [GWB 213].

The heart of Toynbee’s theory is the concept of “challenge-
and-response,”160 i.e. the belief that all cultures and civilizations
face challenges to which they must respond successfully if they
are to continue their growth and development. The image he
uses is that of mountain climbers scaling a cliff: some succeed
and reach the next challenge; some remain stuck, or “arrested”
at a certain point; and some barely get started and are
“abortive,” i.e. stop. Failure means either repeatedly facing the
same challenge until they are conquered or succumbing to them
or giving up and ‘aborting’ their climb. However, no response
is pre-determined — challenge-and-response is not the same as

cause-and-effect161 — and neither tools nor race162 nor other
physical advantage guarantee success. As with the Bahá’í
Writings, personal and collective free will are essential features
of Toynbee’s grand narrative. What matters ultimately in the
success or failure of a civilization is “the vision, initiative,
persistence and above all, self-command ... [and] the spirit in
which Man responds”163 to the challenges s/he faces.164

Toynbee applies the challenge-and-response criteria to 28

civilizations. Nineteen of these are major: Egyptian, Andean
(Incan), Sinic or Shang, Minoan, Sumerian, Mayan, Indian,
Hittite, Western or European, Russian Orthodox Christian, Far
Eastern (China, Korea, Japan from 500 CE to 1912 CE),
Persian, Arabic, Hindu, Mexican or Aztec, Yucatec and
Babylonic. Some of these civilizations are related or “affiliated”
to earlier predecessors in the same region as for example, `the
original Sinic civilization around the Yellow River and the later
Far Eastern civilization. The Yucatec and the later Aztec
civilization are another example. Among the aborted
civilizations, he includes the Irish165 and Scandinavian,166 and
among the “arrested” civilizations i.e. those which attained a
certain point and never moved on to the next challenge, he
includes the Inuit or Eskimo and the Ottoman.167 There is, of
course, controversy about some of what he designates as
separate ‘civilizations’ — e.g. the Sinic and the Far Eastern —
but the list is sufficiently long and varied to preclude criticisms
of having too narrow a base and being tainted by racism.

Another major similarity is the most essential criteria of
growth in a civilization is inward, spiritual growth not material
progress. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá reminds us that

> no matter how far the world of humanity may advance
> in material civilization, it is nevertheless in need of
> spiritual virtues and the bounties of God. The spirit of
> man is not illumined and quickened through material
> sources. [FWU 58]
308                                            Lights of Irfán vol. 18

Elsewhere he reminds us that

> hearts must receive the Bounty of the Holy Spirit, so
> that Spiritual civilization may be established. For
> material civilization is not adequate for the needs of
> mankind and cannot be the cause of its happiness.
> Material civilization is like the body and spiritual
> civilization is like the soul. Body without soul cannot
> live. [ABL 29]

This statement clearly establishes the primacy of the spiritual
over the material in the development of civilization. Without
inward spiritual development, true civilization cannot arise or
thrive. It is possible to be “materially advanced but spiritually
backward” [MUHJ68]. Toynbee has similar views regarding what
he calls the “movement of transference”168:

> True growth consists in a progressive change of
> emphasis and transfer of energy and shifting of the
> scene of action out of the field of the macrocosm and
> into that of the microcosm; and in this new arena
> victorious responses to challenges do not take the form
> of overcoming an external obstacles but manifest
> themselves instead in a progressive self-articulation.169

Toynbee’s term for this “transfer of energy” from the outer
phenomenal world to his inner psycho-spiritual nature is
“etherialization ... in which challenges do not impinge from the
outside but arise from within.”170 This, too, corresponds with
the primacy of inward growth over external, material
development in the Bahá’í Writings. “Etherialization” is a sign
of growth because

> Growth means that the growing personality or
> civilization tends to become its own environment and
> its own challenge and its own field of action. In other
> words, the criterion of growth is progress towards self-
> determination.171

‘Abdu’l-Bahá shows a similar connection between inward
freedom — becoming one’s own challenge and thinking for
one’s self — and growth:

> When freedom of conscience, liberty of thought and
> right of speech prevail — that is to say, when every man
> according to his own idealization may give expression to
> his beliefs — development and growth are inevitable.

[PUP 197]

The material factors present the human and natural
environmental challenges but the human spirit — in both its
secular and religious sense — decides whether or not to
confront the challenges and how and with what persistence.
This spirit cannot be reduced to material explanations and
consequently, purely materialist explanations are inadequate to
explain why civilizations arise or fail. Here, too, Toynbee’s
thought converges with the Bahá’í Writings insofar as both are
premised on religion as essential for an adequate understanding
humankind. Moreover, Toynbee’s “trans-rationalist”172 views —
reason can tell us some things but not everything — agrees with
the “moderate rationalist”173 views found in Gleanings from the
Writings of Bahá’u’lláh. Both the Writings and Toynbee agree
that the understanding and wisdom about human experience
gathered by the “Higher Religions”174 has relevance to our
interpretation and understanding of history which is, after all,
the record of human actions. In other words, both the Writings
and Toynbee recognize that non-material factors, i.e. spirit are
definitive in civilizational success or failure. As Toynbee says,
“the spiritual progress of individual souls in this life will in fact
bring with it much more social progress than could be attained
in any other way.”175

The issue of spirit inevitably raises the question of God or
the divine in Toynbee’s theory of history. Toynbee certainly
recognizes the transcendent and imminent as ontologically real
forces in history. He borrows his term for this ground-of-being

310                                             Lights of Irfán vol. 18

from Henri Bergson, i.e. the “elan vital.” Toynbee writes that
he has

> attained the conception of one omnipresent power
> which manifests itself in the performance and
> achievements of all Mankind and all Life. We may
> conceive of this power as a transcendent first cause and
> call it God, or as an imminent source of continuous
> creation and call it (as Bergson calls it) Evolution
> Creatrice or Elan Vital.176

Like the Bahá’í Writings, Toynbee recognizes that a non-
material power is manifesting itself through the phenomenal
world and that ‘what we see is not all that we get.’ This elan
vital, which is referred to throughout A Study in History serves
as the ground-of-being of all things. Like the Bahá’í concept of
God, Toynbee’s elan vital is both a “transcendent final cause”
and an omnipresent “immanent source of continuous creation.”
It is important to note that the elan vital is the immanent
source of creation and is not creation itself as it is in
pantheism. As in the Writings, creation is an on-going process.
‘Abdu’l-Bahá informs us that the “creation thereof [the
universe] is without beginning and without end” [PUP 378] and
Bahá’u’lláh says, “Endeavour now to apprehend from these two
traditions the mysteries of ‘end,’ ‘return,’ and ‘creation without
beginning or end’” [KI 168]. In other words, the concept of God
in the Writings and in Toynbee is ontologically similar but not
necessarily the same inasmuch as Toynbee’s concept does not
include an exact counterpart of the concept of divine
Manifestations as messengers of God. However, he has an
analogous concept, i.e. the creative individuals who provide the
creative impulse at the start of a civilization. They

> are superhuman in a very literal for they have attained
> self-mastery which manifests itself in a rare power of
> self-determination ... they are privileged human beings
> whose desire it is ... to set the imprint of the elan upon

> the whole of mankind ... The creative personality feels
> the impulse of internal necessity to transfigure his
> fellow men by converting them to his own insight.177

Elsewhere he states that it is “creative personalities ... [who
are] in the vanguard of civilization.”178 From statements such as
these, we can observe that Toynbee’s thought was moving in
the direction of recognizing Manifestations as originators of
civilization. Like the Writings, Toynbee recognizes that strictly
materialist explanations of the birth of civilizations are
inadequate. While such explanations can describe the
conditions under which a civilization started to grow, they
cannot explain why in similar or even the same conditions, the
civilizational process begins in one place but not in another. In
fact, the creative elan or drive of a civilization requires what
Toynbee calls a “creative minority” which devises solutions to
the challenges and unifies a shapeless social mass to give it
direction and a new spirit. A good example of such a creative
minority would be Charles Martel and his grandson
Charlemagne — although the ultimate source of their power
comes from Christ Who is the fountainhead of Western
Civilization. When civilization starts top breakdown, the
“creative minority” is replaced by a “dominant minority” which
cannot rule by attraction and loyalty but rule through violent
oppression, marginalizing or even ‘crusades’ as did Catholicism
during the Albigenisan campaigns (1209–1229 CE).

The importance of spiritual and religious aspects of
civilizations is also evident in the later development of
civilizations. Toynbee refers to these as “higher religions that
liberate human beings from their servitude to their ancient
civilizations.”179 In other words, they are explicitly, i.e.
consciously addressed to all of humanity and not to a portion
of it. (This, of course, creates a confusions with Judaism which
has elements of both insofar as some groups stress universal
appeal and others stress the matrilineal blood-line to determine
‘Jewish identity.’) Interestingly enough, Toynbee’s definition

312                                             Lights of Irfán vol. 18

bears some resemblance to the Bahá’í teaching of overcoming
ancestral imitations in the process of progressive revelation. To
break out of an ancestral religious mindset and culture
obviously requires that we abandon at least some inherited
attitudes, beliefs, laws, formulations and practices by
recognizing them as growth-inhibiting or even harmful.

The challenges faced by civilizations are not necessarily
external military threats but could also involve the natural
environment as in droughts, floods, human or animal disease or
internal problems with governance, economics, technology,
culture or spiritual issues. For this reason, according to
Toynbee, when civilizations fall, the external military attacks
usually finish off a culture that is already fatally weakened from
within. The fall of a corrupt Rome to the Germanic barbarians
in 410 CE, 450 CE and finally in 476 CE is an obvious example
of fatal inward weaknesses inviting conquest by vigorous
external enemies. Here, too, is a strong convergence with the
Bahá’í Writings inasmuch as both agree that the inner life of a
civilization i.e. its spiritual and moral life, its “spirit” plays a
decisive role in deciding whether a civilization collapses or
survives to face a new challenge. Material means are secondary.
To remind us of this truth, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá says,

> I want to make you understand that material progress
> and spiritual progress are two very different things, and
> that only if material progress goes hand in hand with
> spirituality can any real progress come about. [PT 108]

This strong emphasis on the inward mental, spiritual and
moral condition of a civilization as the crucial element in its
rise or fall is another reason why strictly materialist
understandings of history are inevitably inadequate. The
information they provide is necessary but is not sufficient.
Empathy, intuition and “Einfuehlung” are also necessary.

In Toynbee’s grand narrative, all civilizations go through a
“time of troubles” i.e. a period of conflict between members of

a civilization. This time of troubles ends with the establishment
of a “universal state” which is the guarantor of order and
relative peace within a particular civilization. WWI and WWII
may be seen as a “time of troubles” for the nations of Europe
and the European Union with its headquarters in Brussels as an
attempt to establish a “universal state” to keep order. The
current existential difficulties of the E.U. are perhaps the first
signs of the inevitable breakdown after a “universal state” has
been established. The United Nations may also be understood as
the embryo of a future “universal state” or global civilization.
However, we must not forget that for Toynbee the “universal
state” is only a stop-gap measure to prevent an inevitable
decline of a particular civilization. Two consequences follow.
One is the rise of an “external proletariat” whose aim is to
bring down the “universal state” in one way or another. The
Germanic tribes were the “external proletariat” to Rome which
they wore down until the final conquest in 476 CE. The other is
the “internal proletariat,” the excluded classes within the
civilization, the disenfranchised and marginalized, but within
the proletariat, we often find a “chrysalis”180 which are the form
of a new religion, or what Toynbee calls a “universal church.”181
“Our survey ... has shown that principle beneficiaries of
universal states are universal churches ... [and that] the church
is flourishing while the state is decaying.”182 In short, “universal
churches lead to new civilizations. Let us, therefore, take note
of the following quote from Shoghi Effendi who reminds us of
the “twin processes of internal disintegration and external
chaos are being accelerated every day and are inexorably
moving towards a climax” [TDH 23]. This “twin process” is what
Toynbee observes when he refers to the “universal church”
growing amid the tumbling ruins of the “universal state.”
Shoghi Effendi refers to the

> steadily deepening crisis which mankind is traversing, on
> the morrow of the severest ordeal it has yet suffered,
> and the attendant tribulations and commotions which a
> travailing age must necessarily experience, as a prelude
314                                              Lights of Irfán vol. 18

> to the birth of the new World Order, destined to rise
> upon the ruins of a tottering civilization. [CF 39]

Here, too, the Bahá’í Writings are in general agreement with
Toynbee’s theory.

Having examined some of the factors that make civilizations
grow, let us now examine their breakdown and decline. Let us
start by recalling that the Bahá’í Writings assert that “the
source of his calamities ... resides within Man himself; he carries
it in his heart.”183 Bahá’u’lláh reminds us that, “Every good
thing is of God, and every evil thing is from yourselves” [GWB
149]. In other words, we cannot blame the decline of a
civilization on God. As already noted, both the Writings and
Toynbee agree that the spirit within people determines our
creative or destructive reactions to events in the material
world. Individuals and collectives have free will, i.e. the power
of self-determination, and, therefore, are responsible for their
fates. In his examination of the characteristics that encourage
and/or carry forward the process of disintegration, Toynbee
lists behaviors that the Bahá’í Writings describe as being
“imitations” and, therefore, to be rejected. He defines
imitation as an orientation towards the elders and a
simultaneous turn away from “the pioneers.”184 As a result, a
passive attitude develops and there is a loss of flexibility and
freedom in dealing with new challenges. He also says that
idolatry has its roots in

> intellectually and purblind worship of the part instead
> of the whole, of the creature instead of the Creator, of
> Time instead of Eternity; and this abuse of the highest
> faculties of the human spirit ... has its fatal effect upon
> the object of idolization ...In practical life this moral
> aberration may take the comprehensive form of an
> idolization of the idolator’s own personality or own
> society ... or may take the limited form of idolization of
> some institution or particular technique.185

‘Abdu’l-Bahá warns us about the dangers of imitation, saying

> Imitation destroys the foundation of religion,
> extinguishes the spirituality of the human world,
> transforms heavenly illumination into darkness and
> deprives man of the knowledge of God. [PUP 161]

He adds, “The essence of all that We have revealed for thee
is Justice, is for man to free himself from idle fancy and
imitation” [TB 156]. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá points out that “Man must
leave imitation and seek reality” [PUP 169]. The notion that
imitation is a way of avoiding reality is one that plays an
extremely important role both in the Bahá’í grand narrative as
well as Toynbee. Simply imitating past beliefs and past
practices destroys the prospects for human progress by making
impossible the actualization of new personal and collective
potentials. In the words of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá:

> Therefore, we learn that allegiance to the essential
> foundation of the divine religions is ever the cause of
> development and progress, whereas the abandonment
> and beclouding of that essential reality through blind
> imitations and adherence to dogmatic beliefs are the
> causes of a nation's debasement and degradation. [PUP 363]

As the foregoing quotation shows, what makes A Study of
History especially interesting for Bahá’í is that it explores in
great detail the various forms of imitation and how they
destroy a civilization. The first of these is “mimesis,”186 i.e.
following examples in behavior, thought and attitudes. To a
certain extent mimesis is necessary for social cohesion. The
problems with mimesis begin with its inevitable “mechanization
of human movement and life.”187 The essential danger is that it
prevents taking original and creative, often tradition-breaking
action to engage new problems and situations. It destroys the
flexibility, strength, willingness as well as daring needed to
succeed in a constantly changing historical process in which
new challenges are the rule and not the exception. Too much

316                                           Lights of Irfán vol. 18

mimesis, i.e. too much of a good thing, can apply to social
relationships, financial and economic structures, military
thinking, religion and values and technology among other
things. Too much mimesis also destroys individual freedom and
all the advantages it brings.

A second form of mimesis or imitation is what Toynbee calls
“the idolization of an ephemeral self.”188 Civilization is self-
satisfied and content to be what it is instead of seeking new and
creative ways to secure inward growth and/or meet external
challenges. Toynbee’s main examples are Athens and Venice
both of which ‘worshipped’ themselves in their most successful
form until they were destroyed. This “idolization” can also
affect “ephemeral institutions.”189 In other words, institutions
are so convinced of their perfection that they cannot conceive
of any reason to change their thinking and/or modus operandi.
Toynbee’s prime examples are the Catholic and Eastern
Orthodox churches. As shown by His letter to Pope Pius IX,
Bahá’u’lláh shows the need for Catholicism to abandon its self-
adulation as it is and to make the changes necessary to serve
humankind.

A third kind of imitation is the “idolization of an ephemeral
technique.”190 For Toynbee this applies chiefly to military
techniques as seen in the story of David and Goliath. The
Philistines relied on slow moving but heavily armored warriors
who were successful against all enemies — except a man with a
sling. We observe this story even today with the success of
asymmetrical, i.e. low-tech warfare against the highly
sophisticated war machinery of the First World. Of course,
Bahá’u’lláh and ‘Abdu’l-Bahá do not specifically mention this
vis-à-vis warfare, but They do deal with it in another form, i.e.
the West’s continued reliance on material methods, i.e.
technology to solve problems that can only be solved by
spiritual means. There are no material and technological
remedies for spiritual problems. As ‘Abdu’l-Bahá says,

> No matter how far the material world advances, it
> cannot establish the happiness of mankind. Only when
> material and spiritual civilization are linked and
> coordinated will happiness be assured. [PUP 108]

13: Pitirim Sorokin and the Bahá’í Grand Narrative

Pitirim Sorokin, a Russian-American sociologist and founder
of the sociology department at Harvard, is regarded as one of
the foremost sociologists of the 20th Century. Employing
quantitative, i.e. statistical methods to support his qualitative
judgments and conclusions about world history, he developed a
cyclical theory of history based on the identification of three
types of ‘culture complexes’ which alternate as the dominating
force in a society. Sorokin calls these three types the sensate,
the ideational and the idealistic or integral culture complex.
Each of them presents a complete world-view with its own

> o metaphysics or theory of reality;
> o epistemology or theory of truth and knowledge:
> o logic or beliefs about rationality and reasoning;
> o methods of validation;
> o philosophy of human nature;
> o ethics, justice and law;
> o theory of governance and politics;
> o aesthetics or theory of beauty and art;
> o theory of science;
> o theory of society, its nature and requirements.

We shall explore these three forms of culture complexes in
more detail below. Before beginning, we must note that
Sorokin goes to great lengths to show how his three culture
complexes manifest in philosophy, especially in epistemology;
in science; in religion; in the fine arts; in ethics and law; and in

318                                             Lights of Irfán vol. 18

politics, government and economics. In a paper such as this, it
is impossible for us to follow him across this broad swath of
human activity. We shall, therefore, focus most of our
attention on the philosophical aspects of his studies because the
“defining characteristic of each type derives from its principles
of ultimate truth through which it organizes reality.”191 In
short, Sorokin’s central principle is philosophical and we shall
follow his lead.

Perhaps the most unique feature of Sorokin’s philosophy of
history is the voluminous use of statistics. Historian Richard L.
Simpson states,

> He and his assistants did a more complete and
> systematic job of classifying cultural items and tracing
> their fluctuations than anyone before or since has
> attempted. Staggering numbers of artistic and literary
> works, legal and ethical codes, and forms of social
> relationships are classified, and their changing
> proportions of Sensatism and Ideationalism are graphed.
> Sorokin has shown quantitatively, where others have
> only argued qualitatively, to what extent fluctuations in
> thought patterns parallel fluctuations in other
> departments of life. His numerical time charts should
> enable historians in the future to delineate the
> boundaries of such periods as the Middle Ages and the
> Hellenistic Age with a precision never before possible.192

This statement calls for several comments. The use of
quantitative and statistical methods makes a significant
contribution to bringing history and the methods of science
closer together. Through the statistical analysis of large
numbers of events in the sciences, arts, philosophy, religion,
economics and so on, Sorokin and his collaborators were able
to identify large scale patterns and trends in the historical
process. In other words, despite seemingly overwhelming
amounts of data, Sorokin provided scientific, i.e. quantitative
proof that patterns and trends exist. The existence of such

patterns and trends opens the possibility of making the same
kind of statistical predictions used in the life insurance
industry. Despite virtually endless amounts of data generated
by millions of customers all making independent decisions,
actuarial tables are able to identify patterns and groups among
policy holders. They use these patterns to make predictions
about mortality among various groups. Although actuarial
tables cannot predict the death of any one individual, they can
accurately predict when people with a defined set of health and
life-style attributes tend to die. Using this information, they set
personal life insurance rates. The enormous profitability of the
life insurance industry is quantitative proof that this method
works. Sorokin’s use of statistical methodology provides
quantitative, i.e. scientific proof that Popper, Geyl and
Montagu are factually wrong in their rejection of historical
patterns and trends.

Sorokin and his co-workers discovered that there are three
basic types of culture complexes and that the “defining
characteristic of each type derives from the principles of
ultimate truth through which it organizes reality.”193 On this
basis, we can deduce a significant portion of a culture’s
attributes. Sorokin writes,

> the distinguishing of one variable of a culture enables us
> to construct logically a large network of connections
> with many of its other variables; to forecast what will be
> the nature of each of these variables if the culture is
> logically integrated; and, in this way, to comprehend
> quickly the enormous diversity of its traits, qualities,
> quantities, in one united and all-embracing system ... If
> we discover that this culture does contain the
> appropriate body of traits and variables, by one stroke
> we obtain several important cognitive results: (1) a
> highly intimate and certain understanding of many of
> the important aspects of the culture; (2) an insight into
> the nature and workings of most of its significant
320                                               Lights of Irfán vol. 18

> components; (3) a knowledge of the spectrum of its
> dominant mentality; (4) a comprehensive grasp of the
> very complex network of relationships between many of
> its traits which otherwise would escape us ; and (5) an
> answer to the question as to whether or not, and to what
> extent and in what parts, the culture is indeed logically
> integrated. 194

In his numerous works, Sorokin demonstrates how these
culture-complexes manifest in actual societies. He shows not
only the alternating dominance of one culture-complex or
another but also that the dominance of one culture-complex is
not absolute, i.e. vestiges of the other complexes remain active.
We shall discuss this “superrhythm”195 of history in more detail
below.

Ideational Culture

The first of Sorokin’s three culture complexes is the
ideational or spiritually oriented culture. Sorokin writes,

> By Idealism as philosophy, metaphysics, or mentality is
> meant a system of ideology which maintains that the
> ultimate, or true, reality is spiritual, in the sense of God,
> of Platonic ideas, of immaterial spirit, of soul, or of
> psychical reality.196

In other words, the most obvious — and most important —
belief for ideational culture is the existence of God, or a
ground of being, or a mysterious and unknowable Tao, or a
cosmic process of dependent origination as the origin and
ultimate governor of the universe. Of course, this transcendent
orientation may be expressed differently in different cultures
but is ultimately the same everywhere: “truth is one, although
its manifestations may be very different” [PT 128]. The Bahá’í
Writings are clearly ideational in this regard. As ‘Abdu’l-Bahá
says, “That which we imagine, is not the Reality of God; He, the

Unknowable, the Unthinkable, is far beyond the highest
conception of man” [PT 25] and Bahá’u’lláh reminds us that God
is “the Inaccessible, the Omnipotent, the Omniscient, the Holy
of Holies” [GWB 5]. The foundational importance of the
Transcendent is significant because it means that ideational
cultures view human existence sub specie aeternitatis i.e. in
relationship to the Transcendent and not only in relationship to
the phenomenal world or human ambition, desire and
convenience. Indeed, human desires and ambition take second
place not only because it is the Transcendent Who determines
truth, beauty, justice, goodness and all other genuine values but
also because the omniscient and omnipotent Transcendent
knows our nature and understands our best long-term
advantages better than we do. As Bahá’u’lláh says, “It is
incumbent upon everyone to observe God's holy
commandments, inasmuch as they are the wellspring of life
unto the world” [TB 126], i.e. they bring true life to us.
Furthermore, ideational cultures, have a long-term time
perspective on existence; they think and evaluate in terms of
eternity and not in terms of short-term effects.

According to the ideational world view, the ultimate truth
and ultimate basis for truth is an inherently unknowable
Transcendental entity, process, power or ground of being. It is
absolutely independent of any other beings although these
individual beings are completely dependent on this
Transcendental whatever it may be. Since its existence does not
depend on itself alone, creation is not ‘fully’ real. Some like
Plato regard the world as a shadows of a transcendent ideal
world; others as an illusion or a dream or as a sinful distraction
from the quest for salvation for the soul. While the Bahá’í
Writings do not denigrate the phenomenal world, they make it
clear that it is of secondary importance insofar as it is only a
stage, a transition period on the journey of our existence. It is
not the final stopping point and, therefore, cannot be an
ultimate value. That is the inescapable conclusion that follows

322                                            Lights of Irfán vol. 18

from our spiritual nature. Throughout the Writings we find
reminders that we shall not find our final destiny in this world:

> Know thou that the Kingdom is the real world, and this
> nether place is only its shadow stretching out. A shadow
> hath no life of its own; its existence is only a fantasy,
> and nothing more; it is but images reflected in water,
> and seeming as pictures to the eye. [SWAB 177]

Because of its transcendental orientation, the ideational
culture regards intuition, spiritual insight and mystical
experiences as valid sources of knowledge and concomitantly
places little trust in sensory or empirical knowledge and values
logic only insofar as it supports intuition or revelation or the
quest for salvation: “Pure logical reasoning and the testimony
of the organs of sense have only a subsidiary role and only
insofar as they do not contradict revealed Scripture.”197
Knowledge about the empirical or sensory world is secondary
(but not worthless) to knowledge about personal salvation or
one’s ultimate destiny. The Bahá’í Writings also recognize the
importance of intuition in the quest for knowledge. ‘Abdu’l-
Bahá declares,

> True distinction among mankind is through divine
> bestowals and receiving the intuitions of the Holy
> Spirit. If man does not become the recipient of the
> heavenly bestowals and spiritual bounties, he remains in
> the plane and kingdom of the animal. [PUP 316, emphasis
> added]

Elsewhere he refers to the necessity of receiving the bounties
of the Holy Spirit to make reason effective [PUP 302]. This
harmonizes with ideational cultures which are more open to
what Sorokin calls “the supraconscious mode of cognition”198
which comes from the “supraconsciousness” an aspect of the
mind above the unconscious, the ego or super-ego. It is
“egoless”199 i.e. beyond all sense of individuality. As a
sociologist, Sorokin avoids explicitly drawing any metaphysical

conclusions from the existence of the supraconsciousness
(which he deduces from cultural evidence) but it is clear that he
believes in the reality of a Transcendent with which all cultures
try to harmonize. The supraconsciousness which puts us into
touch with the Transcendent is the source of human inspiration
not only in religion but also in the arts, sciences and social
relations.

From the ideational perspective, humankind is essentially
spiritual in nature and, therefore, a spiritual destiny beyond the
material world. Our destiny is not here. The challenge of
attaining our proper destiny is to achieve the “ennoblement of
character.”200 Bahá’u’lláh states,

> From the heaven of God's Will, and for the purpose of
> ennobling the world of being and of elevating the minds
> and souls of men, hath been sent down that which is the
> most effective instrument for the education of the
> whole human race. [GWB 93]

Either acting through Manifestations or inspiring the
supraconscious, the Transcendent sets the standards of what is
or is not true, good, just and beautiful; human considerations
about utility, pleasure, convenience or rationality are simply
irrelevant because the underlying assumption is that God knows
us — and what is good for us — better than we know ourselves.
‘Abdu’l-Bahá may be referring — at least in part — to the
supraconscious when he instructs us “to awaken spiritual
susceptibilities in the hearts of mankind, to kindle anew the
spirit of humanity with divine fires and to reflect the glory of
heaven to this gloomy world of materialism” [PUP 7]. The
“spiritual susceptibilities” like the supraconsciousness connects
us to the Transcendent or God and thereby helps us understand
ethics (the good), law (the just), art (the beautiful) and
knowledge (the true) are based on revelation or divine
commands or the inspiration of the supraconscious through
which we are connected to the Transcendent. This means that
ideational ethics are not utilitarian in the material sense, but

324                                           Lights of Irfán vol. 18

rather, in a spiritual sense, seeking to bring us closer to God201
by actualizing above all our spiritual potentials. They do not
aim at “the greatest happiness or comfort or self-esteem for the
greatest number” but rather at living harmoniously with the will
of the Transcendent.

Sorokin identifies two kinds of ideationalism. “Ascetic
ideationalism” seeks to suppress physical and social needs as
much as possible, and often seeks to dissolve rejects the ego or
sense of self. The Bahá’í Writings, of course, prohibit extreme
asceticism and permanent withdrawal from the world [KA 195].
Sorokin also recognizes what he calls “active ideationalism”202
which seeks to fulfill its spiritual mission by minimizing and
controlling but not suppressing physical needs and by seeking
to transform or spiritualize itself and the world and everyone in
it.203 This, of course, is the mission which all Bahá’ís undertake
as their life’s work. Indeed, towards the end of his life Sorokin
published The Ways and Power of Love (1954) in which he
extolls altruistic and universal love, not only as a necessary
social feeling but as an organizing principle for societies and
the world as a whole. The affinities with the Bahá’í Teachings
are too obvious to require in-depth discussion.

Ideational cultures share other important characteristics.

They value self-control of the senses and emotions. They do not
view self-expression of feeling as necessarily intrinsically
valuable for its own sake. Nor do they see liberty or freedom as
an ultimate value in all aspects of life. Rather, they emphasize
what Sorokin calls “ideational liberty” or an “inner liberty”204
which concerns reducing demands and restraining desires or
surrendering our will to the Transcendent. This emphasis on
self-control is clearly evident in Bahá’u’lláh’s statements
regarding freedom or liberty.

> Liberty must, in the end, lead to sedition ... Know ye
> that the embodiment of liberty and its symbol is the
> animal. That which beseemeth man is submission unto
> such restraints as will protect him from his own

> ignorance, and guard him against the harm of the
> mischief-maker. Liberty causeth man to overstep the
> bounds of propriety, and to infringe on the dignity of
> his station. It debaseth him to the level of extreme
> depravity and wickedness. [GWB 335]

In short, liberty must be “[t]rue liberty [which] consisteth in
man's submission unto My commandments” [GWB 336]. God’s
commandments are “true liberty” because they bring our
thoughts and actions into alignment with our true nature or
essence as human beings.

Ideational economic beliefs and practices must also reflect
or be compatible with revelation and intuition. For example, in
the Middle Ages taking interest or usury was forbidden to
Christians and the principle of a “just price” was applied to
sales of all kinds. The modern principle that price is what the
traffic will bear i.e. what people are willing to pay is viewed as
an invitation to limitless greed — and, therefore, as damaging to
the soul. The Bahá’í Writings also present economic teachings
to enact spiritual values in the phenomenal world. Economic
principles must reflect that human beings are spiritual entities
made in the image of God and in whom “are potentially
revealed all the attributes and names of God to a degree that no
other created being hath excelled or surpassed. All these names
and attributes are applicable to him” [GWB 177]. In other words,
Bahá’í teachings recognize that in economics more than strict
economic matters must be taken into consideration. To a
certain degree, economics are always a matter of psychology
and spirituality, and when these change so will the economic
operations. Bringing economics more into line with a spiritual
outlook is precisely what ideational cultures do.

From the foregoing survey of the major attributes of
ideational cultures, it is clear that the Bahá’í Writings have
many ideational attributes. However, for reasons to come, we
would not describe the Writings as ideational.

Sensate Culture

Sorokin asserts that “Sensate culture is the opposite of the
Ideational in its major premises.”205 It asserts that reality is
strictly material/physical and that there are no super-sensory
beings and processes of any kind. Truth is wholly empirical and
sensory, i.e. all truth-claims must be based on sensory or
material evidence that can be subjected to the scientific method
with its requirements of quantifiability; objectivity;
repeatability and falsifiability. In Sorokin’s words, “The Sensate
mentality, knowledge, science, is characterized by materialism,
empiricism, mechanisticism, determinism, quantitativism.”206 In
other words, all knowledge has a material basis; all material
processes are explainable in mechanistic, i.e. cause-and-effect
terms which enshrine determinism and reject free will; and only
things that can be counted and quantified are real. Conversely,
“inner experience — divine inspiration, mystical union,
revelation, pure meditation, ecstasy, trance”207 as well as the
assistance of the Holy Spirit in acquiring knowledge [PUP 302]
are rejected as delusional. At this point it is already clear that
the sensory culture-complex and the Bahá’í Writings are
incompatible at the most fundamental level vis-à-vis
metaphysics, ontology and epistemology. The dismissal of non-
sensory, i.e. transcendental ‘being’ like God is not reconcilable
with belief in an omnipotent, omnipresent and omniscience
God Who is the willing creator and organizer of all things; Who
gives all things their nature and Who is, therefore, the source of
all knowledge. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, of course, rejects materialism as
an adequate world-view in his talks at Stanford and compares it
to the natural outlook of animals. “Then why should we go to
the colleges? Let us go to the cow” [PUP 361].

For the sensate cultures, humankind is an entirely physical
being which can be studied and known completely by strictly
empirical methods. Because we have no soul we have ‘spiritual
needs’ which will be shown to have biological explanations nor
need we be concerned about the after-life. Furthermore, all

values, e.g. ethical, theological, societal values must be based
on sensory evidence; must be testable by scientific means; and
must be justified by tangible utilitarian benefits such as health,
pleasure (“hedonism”) convenience, power, wealth or other
tangible.208 They define ‘good’ and ‘right’ in strictly practical
terms. Sorokin writes that the “sensate mentality”

> chooses and emphasizes predominantly the sensate,
> empirical, material values. Eudaemonism, hedonism,
> utilitarianism, sensualism; the morals of “ Carpe diem,”
> ... Man should seek pleasure and avoid pain; utility is
> positive, disutility is negative. The maximum pleasure
> for the greatest number of beings, this is in essence the
> motto of Sensate moralists. The second characteristic of
> the moral systems of a Sensate culture type is that they
> are never absolute, but are always relativistic, varying
> “according to circumstances and situations.” They can
> be modified, have no sacred, unalterable, eternal
> imperatives.209

Obviously, sensate moral relativism is logically incompatible
with Shoghi Effendi’s statement that the Manifestation “insists
on the unqualified recognition of the unity of their purpose,
restates the eternal verities they enshrine ... distinguishes the
essential and the authentic from the nonessential and spurious
in their teachings” [PDC 108]. In relativism, “eternal verities” are
logically impossible because verities that are eternal are true
under all circumstances and from all perspectives. According to
the Bahá’í Writings, the accidental outward expression of the
verities might change, but the essential truth always remains. In
practical application, the philosophy of materialism supplies
the principles on which society, law, economics, science and
technology and even the arts are built. In a sensate culture
people think primarily in materialist terms on such issues as ‘the
good life,’ ‘success,’ a ‘good person,’ a ‘good job;’ the soul or
spirit is reduced to physical brain function or to computer
soft-ware, spirituality is reduced to feeling good or strong self-

328                                           Lights of Irfán vol. 18

esteem and belief in God to childish fear. To paraphrase Oscar
Wilde, they confuse ‘value’ which is not necessarily sensory
with ‘price’ which can easily be measured. 210 Naturally, sensate
cultures have a strong, natural tendency to atheism and
secularism, often in militant forms, as seen, for example, in the
new atheist movement. In our view, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá sums up the
sensate perspective when he says,

> Mankind is submerged in the sea of materialism and
> occupied with the affairs of this world. They have no
> thought beyond earthly possessions and manifest no
> desire save the passions of this fleeting, mortal
> existence. Their utmost purpose is the attainment of
> material livelihood, physical comforts and worldly
> enjoyments such as constitute the happiness of the
> animal world rather than the world of man. [PUP 335]

How compatible is the sensate world-view with the Writings?

Insofar as the sensate culture’s thorough-going materialism in
metaphysics, ontology and epistemology are concerned, there is
no compatibility. The denial of any non-sensory beings, entities
or truths cannot be reconciled with the assertion that a non-
sensory God, soul and spiritual truths exist — they are logical
negations of one another.211 Claiming that each is valid from its
point of view does not actually reconcile their specific
contradictions but simply compartmentalizes them in separate
boxes where their actual contradictions remain unresolved.
However, we might ask if there are certain issues on which the
two might be seen as compatible, i.e. two aspects of a whole
like the yin/yang symbol. For example, the Bahá’í Writings do
not deny the need for an existence free from physical
deprivations and disease, a sense of well-being, security and
opportunities to earn a reasonable living. Nor do they deny that
to some degree utilitarianism, i.e. “the greatest happiness for
the greatest number” or the good of the community as a whole
is an important consideration. Because of their underlying
metaphysics, ontology, epistemology and philosophy of human

nature, the Writings proclaim that these goals cannot be
attained by strictly material means but must include the
spiritual aspects of existence. In short, the sensate beliefs are
necessary but not sufficient. Here is where the reconciliation
breaks down because the sensate view cannot by virtue of its
materialist metaphysic admit that spiritual entities and beliefs
have any role in the quest for well-being. The Bahá’í Writings
have no difficulty including the material needs of mankind
despite their spiritual foundations whereas the sensate view is
logically unable to make any such accommodations.

This last point brings us to Sorokin’s integral culture which
is precisely a synthesis of the ideational and sensate.

Integral Culture

Sorokin’s third culture is the integral culture which
dominated Greece in 4th and 5th centuries BCE and Europe
during the 13th and 14th centuries CE. Naturally, we must recall
that no one culture-complex dominates society absolutely but
always exists with ideational and sensate undercurrents at work.
In Greece during this time the most influential philosophers
were Socrates, Plato and Aristotle, both of whom combined the
ideational, intuitive “truth of faith” with the empirical “truth
of the senses” to form a coherent philosophy or world-view.
Plato’s intuitive “truth of faith” concerned the Ideal Forms of
which all phenomenal things are shadows as noted by ‘Abdu’l-
Bahá: “Know thou that the Kingdom is the real world, and this
nether place [the phenomenal world] is only its shadow
stretching out” [SWAB 178]. In other words, the phenomenal
world is merely an image that is dependent on the original and,
thereby, less real than the Kingdom which “is a spiritual realm, a
divine world, and it is the seat of the sovereignty of the
almighty Lord” [SAQ ch.67]. For Plato, the Ideal Forms can only
be understood by intuition within the limits of human capacity.
For Aristotle the “truth of faith” was in the ‘forms’ i.e. Platonic
ideas that are embedded within things, just as the Names of God

330                                              Lights of Irfán vol. 18

are immanently reflected from within things. Plato, Aristotle
(and later Thomas Aquinas) and the Bahá’í Writings unite these
kinds of truth into a rational and coherent world-view.212
Moreover, because integralist truth “combines into one organic
whole the truth of the senses, the truth of faith and the truth of
reason”213 it has a more complete understanding of reality, and,
thereby, is closer to the truth. He writes,

> the integral truth is not identical with any [one] of the
> three forms of truth, but embraces all of them. In this
> three-dimensional aspect of the truth of faith, of
> reason, and of the senses, the integral truth is nearer to
> the absolute truth than any one-sided truth of one of
> these three forms ... The threefold integral system of
> truth gives us ... a more adequate knowledge of the
> reality ..... Each of these systems of truth separated
> from the rest becomes less valid or more fallacious.214

‘Abdu’l-Bahá notes that “the grace of the Holy Spirit is the
true criterion regarding which there is no doubt or uncertainty”
[SAQ ch.83] thereby showing that without consideration of the
spiritual realm, our epistemic processes are inherently
incomplete and, therefore, open to doubt. Vis-à-vis the world
at large, this means that the current Western, i.e.
predominantly sensate culture has an inadequate and thereby
misleading concept of reality. Sorokin writes,

> the major premise [of integral culture is] that true
> reality is partly supersensory and partly sensory — that it
> embraces the super-sensory and the super-rational aspect
> plus the rational aspect and finally the sensory aspect,
> all blended into one unity, that of the infinite manifold,
> God.215

On the basis of this statement, one might conclude that the
one-sided sensate view of reality also presents obstacles to
thinking about God. As the contemporary debates about God
demonstrate, a one-sided view of reality makes it especially

difficult to think coherently about God. A question such as
‘Can God lift an object heavier than Himself?’ is a good
example of confusion between the material with the spiritual.216

Finally, both the Writings and Sorokin view humans as dual
in nature — as material and spiritual with the spiritual being our
higher nature. Sorokin notes that man is “a supersensory and
super-rational being,”217 who possesses a “supra-consciousness”
connecting him to a transcendental reality from which he draws
inspiration and understanding. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá informs us that
“In man there are two natures; his spiritual or higher nature and
his material or lower nature. In one he approaches God, in the
other he lives for the world alone” [PT 61]. For both the Bahá’í
Writings and Sorokin ignoring our spiritual or supraconscious
we is a devastating mistake because we fail ourselves by not
actualizing all our potentials for knowledge and spiritual
development.

The kinship of integral culture and the Bahá’í Writings is
obvious insofar as they agree on the foundations of
metaphysics notably on the dual nature of ‘existence’ which has
two aspects or ‘levels.’ The first and primary aspect is the
Transcendent i.e. “transpersonal source ... [that is]
providential, guiding culture through history with a definite
plan.”218 In other words, the integralist culture not only
recognizes a superior Being Who is the source of phenomenal
reality and all knowledge about it. It also plays a role in
“guiding” human history according to a plan of some kind, i.e.
plays a role in humankind’s unfolding history through the
inspirations of the supraconscious in particular people.
Sorokin’s descriptions of integral culture make no mention of
Manifestations of God or prophets; the gifted people inspired
through the supraconscious are the closest to that exalted
position. The second aspect or level of reality is the
phenomenal world, i.e. physical existence, which, as we seen
above, is a “shadow” i.e. an image of something more real than
itself. Like a shadow it is completely dependent on its original.
Both the Bahá’í Writings and integral culture reject any extreme

332                                           Lights of Irfán vol. 18

denials or mortifications of our physical nature as a proper
response to living in this shadow world. They advocate a
moderate, i.e. balanced approach to self-discipline or self-
control. As we shall see below, the Writings and Sorokin’s
theories also agree that metaphysics is includes by a potentialist
ontology that characterizes all individual things.

How, we may ask, is Sorokin’s theory of culture-complexes
relevant to the philosophy of history and the subject of grand
narratives and to the Bahá’í grand narrative in particular?
Sorokin’s answer is clear: cultures and history have empirically
demonstrable patterns, they go through empirically
demonstrable cycles and show empirically demonstrable
progress in our understanding of reality — albeit not in a simple
linear form as the Enlightenment thought. Moreover, the three
culture complexes dominate societies in an oscillating pattern
whereby the decline of one leads to the rise of another. The
periods of domination are not always of the same length and no
one culture complex is ever absolutely dominant; the two
remaining culture-complexes remain active as undercurrents
one of which will be ‘ready’ to take the dominant position by
meeting the needs. These three culture-complexes and their
alternating periods of dominance in a society constitute what
Sorokin calls the “superrhythm”219 of history.

This “superrhythm” brings up the issue of progress. Does
Sorokin’s philosophy of change in history include the concept
of ‘progress, i.e. improvement in knowledge or social practice?
Does history have a direction or is it subject to divine
guidance? He clearly rejects the Enlightenment view of an
“Omnipotent Evolution and Providential Progress unerringly
lead mankind ever nearer to some goal or toward some ‘bigger
and better’ state.”220 Obviously this conflicts with the Bahá’í
teaching of “progressive revelation” and belief in an “ever-
advancing civilization” under the guidance of the
Manifestations.

However as Barry V Johnston points out, in effect, Sorokin
re-introduces the concept of progress in another form that
turns out to converge with the Bahá’í Writings. Sorokin wanted
a solution for the problem that the “superrhythm” of three
culture-complexes would simply go on forever without any
movement towards ultimate truth or at least towards
improvements, expansions, of knowledge and understanding.
Without such a direction, without improvement the cycles of
history would be rather pointless. Sorokin sees the solution in
the periods of integral culture which embrace and connect
ideational, sensate and integral views of truth i.e. connected the
“truths of reason, senses and faith”221 and thereby gained a
broader and deeper understanding of reality. Consequently,
integral culture more accurately reflects human nature with its
intellectual, sensory and intuitive faculties. Insofar as our
understanding of reality has improved, there has been and will
be progress in history, although it is not necessarily an
unbroken linear progress as imagined by the Enlightenment.
Consequently, we conclude that like the Bahá’í Writings,
Sorokin recognizes epistemological progress which, in turn,
leads to progress in other areas of humanity’s existence as new
knowledge is applied. In this sense it seems clear that over the
long term humanity has advanced beyond its ancestors. This is
at least a partial reconciliation between the Writings and
Sorokin.

There are several reasons why the dominance of the three
culture-complexes oscillates. According to Sorokin, the most
important is that in each culture-complex, “the system of truth
is partly true and partly false”222 and as the falsities expand a
society has “either to continue the dangerous drift and suffer
fatal atrophy or else to correct the mistake”223 by adopting a
more adequate system of truth. He adds, “Some cultures, like
the Graeco-Roman and the Western were able to make such a
shift several times; others could not do so.”224 In other words,
the inadequacies in each culture-complex help drive the
historical process forward.

334                                             Lights of Irfán vol. 18

Furthermore, another reason for change occurs from within
the three culture-complexes as well as all other things. The basis
of this change is the potentialist ontology the Bahá’í Writings
and Sorokin share. The Writings recognize this in their
references to the “potential in the seed” [PUP 91]; of the sun
awakening “all that is potential in the earth” [PUP 74]; of the
“virtues potential in mankind” [PUP 70]; of the inventions
“potential in the world of nature” [PUP 309]; and of the embryo
progressing until “that which was potential in it — namely, the
human image — appears” [PUP 359]. Sorokin’s sociology and
philosophy of history is also potentialist. He discusses this
under the “principle of immanent change”225 by which he means
that the basis of change is in the potentials or essence immanent
in a thing. Each thing possesses “‘immanent self-regulation and
self-direction.’”226 The environment can stimulate change but it
cannot determine the kind of change we will see. No amount of
environmental influence can make a duck manifest the
attributes of a donkey. The potentials for such a change are not
present. Things are not simply the passive playthings of the
environment. 227 As Sorokin says, Sorokin puts it, the essence of
a thing “the determining potentialities of the system are the
system itself and are its immanent properties.”228 The Bahá’í
rejection of “environmentalism” is found not only in its
potentialist ontology but also in the spiritual guidance we
received from Bahá’u’lláh: the “the faith of no man can be
conditioned by anyone except himself” [GWB 143] even if all
others in society oppose him or her. Elsewhere Bahá’u’lláh says
of the true believers that they will persevere in faith “even if all
the powers of earth and heaven were to deny Him” [GDM 55].
Logically, if “environmentalism”229 or “externalism”230 are false,
then all things — but at least humans — must have some degree
of free will. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá states that

> Certain matters are subject to the free will of man, such
> as acting with justice and fairness, or injustice and
> iniquity — in other words, the choice of good or evil
> actions. It is clear and evident that the will of man

> figures greatly in these actions. But there are certain
> matters where man is forced and compelled, such as
> sleep, death, sickness, failing powers, misfortune, and
> material loss: These are not subject to the will of man
> and he is not accountable for them. [SAQ 287]

In the phenomenal world, we are subject to the laws of
physical existence but we have the capacity to be spiritually
free. Sorokin does not specifically discuss free will but a
reading of his texts clearly shows that he assumes it as real and
effective.

Finally we should note that more than any other historian —
even Toynbee — Sorokin has made a careful study of the “over-
ripe” conditions of our sensate culture and its ills.

Pre-Conclusion

Because — as Shoghi Effendi urged us to do — we have
examined so many correlations vis-à-vis grand narratives in
history, we believe it is fitting to end with a review of some of
the aspects which make the Bahá’í grand narrative of mankind’s
history unique and especially suitable for the religious and
cultural divisions in the contemporary world. From our
perspective, the doctrine of progressive revelation is the
‘flagship’ teaching of the Faith in regards to a global
metanarrative. Numerous other teachings are implicitly present
in this doctrine. First, is its hitherto unprecedented religious
inclusiveness. Other religions are not merely recipients of good
will and toleration, they are incorporated as equal, necessary
and essential parts of a single global “meta-religion” of which
the Bahá’í dispensation is the latest but by no means the final
phase. It is difficult to imagine a more rational and more
morally satisfying alternative to the problem of religious and
cultural disunity among humankind. Second, embedded in
progressive revelation is the concept of progress as primarily
spiritual but also as material progress. This also shows that in

336                                           Lights of Irfán vol. 18

the Bahá’í Writings, the idea of progress has a theological basis
as a necessary part of Bahá’u’lláh’s revelation The sequence and
nature of different divine revelations depends on the degree of
spiritual progress a society has made: “Know of a certainty that
in every Dispensation the light of Divine Revelation hath been
vouchsafed unto men in direct proportion to their spiritual
capacity” [GWB 87]. In this way their progress is expedited to the
next stage. Furthermore, “All men have been created to carry
forward an ever-advancing civilization” [GWB 214], a statement
which, in effect, makes spiritual and material progress a
religious duty for all. This is doctrine is especially suited to a
world harshly divided by sectarian prejudices and horrible
material inequities. From the foregoing, we observe the
objective ethical standard to evaluate individual and collective
acts. This avoids the quagmire of ethical relativism which
creates confusion because it can justify anything.

Because religion and culture are so intimately connected,
progressive revelation leads logically to the conclusion that
eventually humankind will be united into a federal global
commonwealth united by “one common faith.” Religious
history — and history in general — exhibit a clearly foreseeable
purpose. The clarity of this purpose leads to the next implicit
concept in progressive revelation: the Universal House of
Justice. If we have a clear goal, then the obvious question is
‘How shall we get there?’ As noted in our Introduction, the
Bahá’í Writings are not limited to mere diagnosis of human
history but also provide a prescription for healing the world’s
ills as well as the institution for putting the healing into
practice. Recommending universal love — as Toynbee and
Sorokin do — is not in itself a prescription except in the
vaguest sense especially in the contemporary world. What
humankind requires is a program of practical steps on the
practice of love and an institution or vanguard to guide this
practice. This is especially true when we think on a global inter-
cultural and international scale. While good will and good
feelings are necessary, they are not sufficient in humanity’s new

situation. Moreover, the Universal House of Justice develops
plans to bring both individuals and societies closer to the goal
of unification. Such planning and coordination are necessary
because individual action while necessary is not sufficient at
this time in history.

In addition, the teaching of progressive revelation also
implies the essential oneness of human nature. We cannot
expect the world to become united if we do not believe that
human nature has certain universal aspects that can be the
common basis for unity. The essential oneness of humankind
also points to the “eternal verities” i.e. the universal ethical
principles on which unity can be established to become the
foundation for spiritual evolution. Finally, the harmonization
of science and religion as part of our material and spiritual
progress since both of them are necessary and inescapable
aspects of human existence. The apparent conflict between
science and religion is symptom of short-sightedness and lack
of true understanding that must be over come because both of
them are undeniable aspects of human nature.

Conclusion

> Our conclusion consists of four major points.

First, the Bahá’í Writings present a well-developed,
spiritually based grand narrative of human history that lays the
foundations for the unification of humankind.

Second, the Bahá’í Writings share numerous similarities with
the historical theories of Spengler, Toynbee and Sorokin but go
much farther in developing spiritual and practical responses to
the problems explored in these other grand narratives. Unlike
the other grand narratives, the Bahá’í Writings provide not only
a description or diagnosis of the historical process but also a
prescription or plan of action and an institution to put these
plans into action as guided by Bahá’u’lláh, the Manifestation of

338                                                 Lights of Irfán vol. 18

God for this age. This institution is the Universal House of
Justice.

Third, the grand narratives we have studied show that it is
necessary to adopt a “world-embracing” vision to observe the
identifiable patterns and trends exist in the historical process
and that using these patterns it is possible to make testable
predictions about future trends. The existence of these patterns
based on a universal human nature allows greater understanding
of our position in the historical process. Perspectives that are
too narrowly specialist do not serve us well vis-à-vis the global
aspects of human history.

Fourth, the various attempts to undermine and invalidate
grand narratives are often logically self-contradictory;
unscientific vis-à-vis the use of statistics; inaccurate in their
presentation of human nature; and motivated more by political
than scholarly concerns, especially in the case of Popper and the
postmodern philosophers. None of the arguments against grand
narratives present insuperable obstacles for advocating the
Bahá’í grand narrative.
