Significance of some Sites Mentioned in

Memorials of the Faithful

Foad Seddigh

Abstract

Memorials of the Faithful is not merely a book devoted to
the hagiography of some believers and to some extent a
historical narrative of their lives, it is also a depository of
matchless beauty in Persian writing, an exquisite text with
profound meaning, and a testimonial to the devotion of
believers to the Cause of God and the Covenant. The believers
whose stories appear in the book comprised a diverse cross-
section of the Bábí and Bahá’í communities including believers
that society would consider low in rank as well as high, poor and
rich, semi-literate and learned.

In the book Memorials of the Faithful, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, in the
course of portraying the life history of these believers, cited
many countries, cities, towns, villages and sites, some of which
were blessed by the foot-steps of the Twin Manifestations of
God for this age, and others which were important due to their
association with significant historical events of the Faith. In
this paper three such places were selected from among all the
sites mentioned in the book and their niche in the history and
the Writings of the Faith were further elaborated. These are: (1)
The Most Great House in Baghdad, (2) The ruins of Mada’in,

306                                          Lights of Irfán vol. 17

located some thirty kilometers south of Baghdad, on the banks
of the River Tigris, a place where the Blessed Beauty visited
many times, and which once graced the palaces of great kings of
the Sassanid dynasty, and (3) the city of Mosul in northern Iraq
on the banks of the River Tigris where a number of believers
and the Holy family were kept as captives for several years, a
city which Bahá’u’lláh’s caravan passed through on His journey
to exile in the seat of the Ottoman Empire.

The Most Great House

Bahá’u’lláh arrived in Baghdad on April 8, 1853 and stayed a
few days in the old quarters of the city then moved to al-
Káẓimíyyah (Káẓimayn),1 a holy town in the eyes of Shí’ah, Islám
[King of Glory p. 106]. Al-Káẓimíyyah houses the shrines of two
Shí‘ah Imáms and therefore is a place of pilgrimage for Shí‘ahs.
At the time, this place was at a distance of 10 km from Baghdad,
and now is one of the nine administrative districts within the
city. Soon after Bahá’u’lláh’s arrival, an official from the
Iranian consulate paid Him a visit and advised Him, in utmost
humility, that this place was not suitable for His residence.
Therefore, after staying a month in al-Káẓimíyyah, He moved to
a house in the Al-Karkh2 district of Baghdad, referred to as the
House of Óájí ‘Alí Madad. Due to the inadequacy of space in
this house, the holy Family was not comfortable, and lived in
cramped conditions. During the absence of Bahá’u’lláh during
his sojourn in the mountains of Kurdistan, the Family moved to
a house known by the name of Sulaymán-i-Ghannám, belonging
to Musá Javáhirí; this house was also located in the Al-Karkh
district (Bahá’u’lláh left Baghdad for Kurdistan on April 10,
1854 and returned on March 19, 1856 [King of Glory pp. 112-115]).
The Guardian describes this residence of Bahá’u’lláh with the
following words [GPB 129-130]:

> Within a few years after Bahá’u’lláh’s return from
> Sulaymáníyyih the situation had been completely
> reversed. The house of Sulaymán-i-Ghannám, on which
Significance of Some Sites                                       307

> the official designation of the Bayt-i-‘Aẓam (the Most
> Great House) was later conferred, known, at that time,
> as the house of Mírzá Músá, the Bábí, an extremely
> modest residence, situated in the Karkh quarter, in the
> neighborhood of the western bank of the river, to which
> Bahá’u’lláh’s family had moved prior to His return from
> Kurdistán, had now become the focal center of a great
> number of seekers, visitors and pilgrims, including
> Kurds, Persians, Arabs and Turks, and derived from the
> Muslim, the Jewish and Christian Faiths. It had,
> moreover, become a veritable sanctuary to which the
> victims of the injustice of the official representative of
> the Persian government were wont to flee, in the hope of
> securing redress for the wrongs they had suffered.

The exact date of the family’s transfer to this house is not
known. The house of Sulaymán-i-Ghannám was rented at the
beginning and later on became a property of Bahá’u’lláh. This
transition is a fascinating story which has been narrated by
‘Abdu’l-Bahá in one of the chapters from the Memorials of the
Faithful where the life history of Mírzá Mu˙ammad-i-Vakíl is
narrated. A brief extract from His explanation is given below:

> There was a notable in Baghdád by the name of Óájí
> Mírzá Hádí, the jeweler. He had a distinguished son, Áqá
> Mírzá Músá,3 who had received from Bahá’u’lláh the
> title “Letter of Eternity.” This son had become a staunch
> believer. As for his father, the Óájí, he was a princely
> individual known for his lavish open-handedness not
> only in Persia and ‘Iráq but as far away as India....

> Toward the close of his life he conceived a remarkable
> love for Bahá’u’lláh, and most humbly, would enter His
> presence.... Such was the situation of that illustrious
> prince when he passed away, leaving as heirs a son and
> two daughters....
308                                            Lights of Irfán vol. 17

Mírzá Músá was a staunch believer; his sisters, however, were
from a different mother, and they knew nothing of the Cause.
One day the two sisters, accompanied by the son-in-law of the
late Mírzá Siyyid Ri∂á, came to the house of Bahá’u’lláh. The
two sisters entered the family apartments while the son-in-law
settled down in the public reception rooms. The two girls then
said to Bahá’u’lláh: “The Persian envoy, the judge, and the
faithless mujtahids have destroyed us. Toward the close of his
life, the late Óájí trusted no one but Yourself. We ourselves
have been remiss and we should have sought Your protection
before; in any case we come now to implore Your pardon and
help....” [MF 108 -109]

The Blessed Beauty refused to become involved in such
matters and they insisted and begged him to the extent that they
said they would not leave the house until He acceded to their
requests. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá further explains:

> Finally one day Bahá’u’lláh summoned me to His
> presence. “These esteemed ladies,” He said, “with all
> their exactions, have put Us to considerable
> inconvenience. There is no help for it—you will have to
> see to this case. But you must solve this entire,
> complicated matter in a single day...”. [MF 112]

The Blessed Beauty accepted to intervene and instructed
‘Abdu’l-Bahá to spend only one day to settle the matter.
‘Abdu’l-Bahá followed His instructions and resolved all the
matters of dispute to the best satisfaction of all. In return, they
gave one third of the inheritance to Him which at long last He
accepted and donated in its entirety to Mírzá Músá Javáhirí.
Then ‘Abdu’l-Bahá explains further that:

> Grateful for the bounty he had received, Mírzá Músá
> offered Bahá’u’lláh everything he possessed: orchards,
> lands, estates—but it was refused. Then he appointed the
> ‘ulamás of ‘Iráq to intercede for him. They hastened to
> Bahá’u’lláh in a body and begged Him to accept the
Significance of Some Sites                                      309

> proffered gifts. He categorically refused. They
> respectfully told Him: “Unless You accept, in a very
> short time Mírzá Músá will scatter it all to the winds.
> For his own good, he should not have access to this
> wealth.”

> Then in his own hand, Mírzá Músá penned deeds of gift,
> made out according to each of the five creeds, in Arabic
> and Persian; two copies he made, and chose the ‘ulamás
> as his witnesses. Through certain ‘ulamás of Baghdád,
> among them the famed scholar ‘Abdu’s-Salám Effendi,
> and the erudite and widely known Siyyid Dávúd Effendi,
> he presented the deed of gift to Bahá’u’lláh. The Blessed
> Beauty told them: “We are appointing Mírzá Músá
> himself as Our deputy....” [MF 119]

This house was later on called the “Most Great House,” by
Bahá’u’lláh, which is one of the three locations designated for
pilgrimage for the Bahá’ís. The Most Great House in Baghdád
and the House of the Báb in Shiráz were designated in the Most
Holy Book (The Kitáb-i-Aqdas) for pilgrimage; ‘Abdu’l-Bahá
added to this list the third place which is Shrine of Bahá’u’lláh in
Akká, but He did not specify any rites for this pilgrimage [KA
191]. In Baghdad, Bahá’u’lláh and His family lived in this house
for a longer period than they did elsewhere in Iraq. The Most
Great House witnessed many events during the earlier years of
Bahá’u’lláh’s mission while He had not yet declared. Many
Tablets were revealed in this House, many believers attained
Bahá’u’lláh’s presence in this House, and many dignitaries and
men of status and knowledge met Him in this House.

When Bahá’u’lláh was exiled to Istanbul and Edirnih
(Adrianople) several believers became custodians of the House
among whom were: Gawhar Khánum (His wife from Káshán),
Mírzá Mihdí Káshání (Gawhar Khánum’s brother) and Mírzá
Mu˙ammad-i-Vakíl. Towards the end of Bahá’u’lláh’s stay in
Edirnih, nearly seventy believers among whom was Jináb-i-
Zaynu’l-Muqarrabín were arrested in Baghdad and sent as

310                                          Lights of Irfán vol. 17

prisoners to the city of Mosul. This deprived the House of
lawful custodians and in the interim some individuals looked
after the House. This is the earlier period that provided an
opportunity for the enemies of the Cause to transgress against
this House. It has been reported that a number of believers on
their way to ‘Akká stayed in this House. This included Badí‘, the
pride of the martyrs.

In the first year of His stay in Edirnih (Adrianople),
Bahá’u’lláh revealed two Tablets of pilgrimage (Surih-i-Hajj)4,
one for the House of the Báb and the other one for the Most
Great House and sent them to Nabíl Zarandí (Nabíl A‘ẓam) who
was travelling in Iran at the time proclaiming the news of the
appearance of the promised one of the Bayán. Bahá’u’lláh
instructed Nabíl to perform the pilgrimage according to the
instructions given in the Tablets. Nabíl Zarandí proceeded at
once and performed the pilgrimage according to the
instructions contained in these two Tablets. As far as the
history has recorded, Nabíl Zarandí is the only person who has
performed the pilgrimage in accordance with all the instructions

of the Tablet of Pilgrimage. Sheikh Mu˙ammad Damirtchi was
another person directed by Bahá’u’lláh to visit the House and
read a Tablet of Visitation at the House which had been
revealed in his honor. He performed the pilgrimage according to
the instructions, disregarding the mobs who were throwing
stones at him.

The Nobility of the Most Great House

Bahá’u’lláh extols the station of this House in several
Tablets, including the one which was revealed in the honor of
the aforementioned Sheikh Mu˙ammad Damirtchi. Some
passages from this Tablet appear below:

> When thou art departed out of the court of My
> presence, O Mu˙ammad, direct thy steps towards My
> House (Baghdád House), and visit it on behalf of thy
Significance of Some Sites                                     311

> Lord. When thou reachest its door, stand thou before it
> and say: Whither is the Ancient Beauty gone, O most
> great House of God, He through Whom God hath made
> thee the cynosure of an adoring world, and proclaimed
> thee to be the sign of His remembrance unto all who are
> in the heavens and all who are on the earth? Oh! for the
> former days when thou, O House of God, wert made His
> footstool, the days when in ceaseless strains the melody
> of the All-Merciful poured forth from thee! What hath
> become of thy jewel whose glory hath irradiated all
> creation? Whither are gone the days in which He, the
> Ancient King, had made thee the throne of His glory, the
> days in which He had chosen thee alone to be the lamp
> of salvation between earth and heaven, and caused thee
> to diffuse, at dawn and at eventide, the sweet fragrance
> of the All-Glorious?

> Where, O House of God, is the Sun of majesty and
> power Who had enveloped thee with the brightness of
> His presence? Where is He, the Day Spring of the tender
> mercies of thy Lord, the Unconstrained, Who had
> established His seat within thy walls? What is it, O
> throne of God, that hath altered thy countenance, and
> made thy pillars to tremble? What could have closed thy
> door to the face of them that eagerly seek thee? What
> hath made thee so desolate? Couldst thou have been told
> that the Beloved of the world is pursued by the swords
> of His enemies? The Lord bless thee, and bless thy
> fidelity unto Him, inasmuch as thou hast remained His
> companion through all His sorrows and His sufferings...

[GWB 111-112]

In relation to the names and titles of this House, The Guardian
states:

> Most Great House of God,” His “Footstool” and the
> “Throne of His Glory,” “the Cynosure of an adoring
312                                             Lights of Irfán vol. 17

> world,” the “Lamp of Salvation between earth and
> heaven,” the “Sign of His remembrance to all who are in
> heaven and on earth,” enshrining the “Jewel whose glory
> hath irradiated all creation,” the “Standard” of His
> Kingdom, the “Shrine round which will circle the
> concourse of the faithful” was irrevocably founded and
> permanently consecrated. Upon it, by virtue of its
> sanctity as Bahá’u’lláh’s “Most Holy Habitation” and
> “Seat of His transcendent glory,” was conferred the
> honor of being regarded as a center of pilgrimage second
> to none except the city of ‘Akká, His “Most Great
> Prison...” [GPB 110]

It is evident that the high station given to a House is due to its
association with the Manifestation of God and not because of
the materials, stones, bricks and concrete used to construct the
house.

Prophecy of the Desecration of the House

Bahá’u’lláh in some of His Tablets clearly predicted that the
House of God (The Most Great House) will be dishonored:

> Grieve not, O House of God, if the veil of thy sanctity
> be rent asunder by the infidels. God hath, in the world of
> creation, adorned thee with the jewel of His
> remembrance. Such an ornament no man can, at any
> time, profane. Towards thee the eyes of thy Lord shall,
> under all conditions, remain directed. He, verily, will
> incline His ear to the prayer of every one that visiteth
> thee, who will circle around thee, and calleth upon Him
> in thy name. He, in truth, is the Forgiving, the All-
> Merciful. [GWB 114]

Also the Sublime Pen writes in the following terms concerning
the future humiliation awaiting the House:

Significance of Some Sites                                      313

> Call thou to mind that which hath been revealed unto
> Mihdí, Our servant, in the first year of Our banishment
> to the Land of Mystery (Adrianople). Unto him have We
> predicted that which must befall Our House (Baghdád
> House), in the days to come, lest he grieve over the acts
> of robbery and violence already perpetrated against it.

> to flow from every discerning eye. Thus have We
> unfolded to thee things hidden beyond the veil,
> inscrutable to all save God, the Almighty, the All-
> Praised.... [GWB 114-115]

Although several attempts were made by the Shí‘ah clergy, the
ever vigilant enemy of the Cause of God in Baghdad, who tried
to wrestle away this House from the hands of its lawful owner,
but all their efforts in this regard failed miserably. Towards the
end of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s Ministry, the condition of the House
deteriorated to such an extent that it was in a sorry state. One
of the new adherents of the Faith in Baghdad, Óájí Ma˙múd-i-

Qassábchí, with the permission from ‘Abdu’l-Bahá and with his
own resources, undertook to repair the House. This period of
time coincided with the termination of World War I and the
dissolution of the Ottoman Empire. As a result, Iraq came
under the administration of the League of Nations, a new
constitution was adopted and the freedom of religion and belief
was announced. The reconstruction of the House and its
development produced a steadily widening measure of publicity.
This emboldened the Shí‘ah clerics to seize possession of the
House through the favourable judgement of an obscure Shari‘ah
Court which made several obvious and possibly deliberate
mistakes. This crisis which originated about a year prior to

314                                             Lights of Irfán vol. 17

‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s ascension eventually precipitated in its seizure
by Shí‘ah clerics in the summer of 1922. Since this time the
House has not been returned to the Bahá’ís. This House had
continued to be in the unbroken and undisputed possession of
Bahá’u’lláh’s followers ever since His departure from Baghdád,
a period of more than six decades. As an example of an obvious
mistake committed by the court was that it disregarded the rule
that fifteen years of lawful possession and occupation of a
house disqualifies any dispute attempted at the seizure of the
house.

This unjust ruling became the object of the consideration of
successive tribunals. First by the local Shí‘ah Ja‘faríyyih court in
Baghdád, second by the Peace court, then the court of First
Instance, then by the court of Appeal in Iraq, and finally by the
League of Nations, the greatest international body in existence
at that time. The League of Nations had been empowered to
exercise supervision and control over all Mandated Territories.
Though repossession of the House was not resolved due to a
combination of causes, religious as well as political, it has
already remarkably fulfilled Bahá’u’lláh’s own prediction
concerning the humiliation it will suffer in the hands of the
enemies of the Cause of God.

The appeal of the local Bahá’í community in Iraq, and those
of the International Bahá’í community from around the world,
as well as the letters of the Guardian written as the Head of the

Bahá’í Faith to the highest authorities and to King Faisal
produced no results; and the Government of Iraq under the
leadership of King Faisal remained adamant in acting in a
manner which was just—as he was much afraid of the religious
passion of the Shí‘ahs. Details regarding these communications
are comprehensively documented in the volumes of the Bahá’í
World: Bahá’í World II pp. 33-34, Bahá’í World III pp. 198-
210, Bahá’í World IV pp. 237-248, Bahá’í World V pp. 351-359,
and Bahá’í World VI p. 437.8 In these volumes, we find the
resolutions of various courts, minutes of the council of the
League of Nations, as well as some important letters. Among

the various accounts, Arnold Toynbee, the well-respected
British historian provides an informed accounting of the
situation concerning the House [Survey of International Affairs pp.
116-122]. The American Lawyer, Mountfort Mills, exerted
tremendous efforts and dedication towards securing possession
of the House for the Faith. In paying tributes to his effort, the
Guardian referred to him as “Mr. Mountfort Mills, whose
services to the Cause only future generations can estimate” [BA
127]. Other efforts included the audience of Miss Martha Root

with King Faisal I in Baghdad and her request for the
intervention by the King. Finally, the Government of Iraq
gained complete independence in 1932 and joined the League of
Nations in 1933 and all those who were involved with this
matter either died or were replaced and the case has remained
unresolved until this time despite several fundamental changes
of Government in Iraq. The final act was the news released by

the Universal House of Justice in a letter dated 17 July, 2013,
of razing the House almost to the ground by unknown
elements, without any legal permit from the Government,
between 24-26 June, 2013, in order to prepare the ground for
building a mosque on the spot where the Most Great House was
originally standing.

Promise of the Rise of the House of God

Bahá’u’lláh also prophesied that the House will suffer such
humiliation which will cause tears of the faithful to flow; after
that it will rise again and will find its high station which has
been destined for it. The Supreme Pen provides this assurance
with these words:

> In the fullness of time, the Lord shall, by the power of
> truth, exalt it in the eyes of all men. He shall cause it to
> become the Standard of His Kingdom, the Shrine round
> which will circle the concourse of the faithful. Thus hath
> spoken the Lord, thy God... [GWB 115]

Al-Mada’in Becomes the Seat of Glory

One of the chapters of Memorials of the Faithful is devoted
to the life of Mírzá Mu˙ammad-‘Alí, the Afnán who was
eventually buried in the vicinity of the ancient city of Mada’in.
Mírzá Mu˙ammad-‘Alí, the Afnán, was a cousin of the Báb and
the eldest child of the eldest uncle of the Báb for whom the
Kitab-i-Íqán was revealed. About a year prior to the departure
of Bahá’u’lláh from Baghdád for Istanbul, Mírzá Mu˙ammad-
’Alí who was a resident of Shanghai in China, along with his
younger brother, attained the presence of Bahá’u’lláh and
became aware of His high station. For the second time he gained
admittance to the presence of Bahá’u’lláh in ‘Akká—this is the
visit that ‘Abdu’l-Bahá describes in these terms:

> One day I was up on the roof of the caravanserai. Some
> of the friends were with me and I was walking up and
> down. It was sunset. At that moment, glancing at the
> distant seashore, I observed that a carriage was
> approaching. “Gentlemen,” I said, “I feel that a holy
> being is in that carriage.” It was still far away, hardly
> within sight.” Let us go to the gate,” I told them.
> “Although they will not allow us to pass through, we can
> stand there till he comes.” I took one or two people with
> me and we left... The gatekeeper stayed outside, the
> carriage drew up, the gentleman had arrived. What a
> radiant face he had! He was nothing but light from head
> to foot. Just to look at that face made one happy; he
> was so confident, so assured, so rooted in his faith, and
> his expression so joyous. He was truly a blessed being....

[MF 17]

During one of his trips from China, Mírzá Mu˙ammad-‘Alí
Afnán arrived in Bombay and took his flight to the Abhá
Kingdom due to an illness. However, the burial of his remains
became problematic and one of the believers by the name Áqá
Siyyid Asadu’lláh-i-Qumí according to the instructions of

‘Abdu’l-Bahá took the body to Iraq with the intention of
finding a burial place in one of the holy cemeteries of Islám.
Eventually, according to the instructions of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, he
buried the body of Mírzá Mu˙ammad-‘Alí in the Salmán
Cemetery near Mada’in. Mada’in was once the seat of the
Government of the Sassanid dynasty which ruled over Iran for
five centuries, and eventually was defeated by the army of the
Arab Muslim invaders who plundered the riches of this
kingdom. Bahá’u’lláh is a descendant from this line of kings.
The city of Mada’in consisted of several smaller fortified cities
on both sides of the river Tigris. The city of Ctesiphon was one
of the cities and the seat of the government, and it housed
sprawling palaces which were the envy of the rulers of the world
at that time—as for its location, Mada’in is located nearly thirty
kilometers south of Baghdad. Salmán was the first Muslim ruler
for the newly opened territories, stationed in Mada’in and after
his death he was buried there in a place where it has become a
cemetery bearing his name; in this place Mírzá Mu˙ammad-‘Alí
Afnán was buried. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá states that this place is a holy
place because the Blessed Beauty walked there and revealed
Tablets; moreover He states that in this place a house of
worship (Mashriqu’l-Adhkár) should be built. The following is
His statement in the Memorials of the Faithful:

> Thus did God’s grace and favor encompass the Persians
> of an age long gone, in order that their ruined capital
> should be rebuilt and flourish once again. To this end,
> with the help of God, events were brought about which
> led to the Afnán’s being buried here; and there is no
> doubt that a proud city will rise up on this site.....

> At last, praised be God, it was laid down in the very spot
> to which time and again the Blessed Beauty had repaired;
> in that place honored by His footsteps, where He had
> revealed Tablets, where the believers of Baghdád had
> been in His company; that very place where the Most
> Great Name was wont to stroll. How did this come

> about? It was due to the Afnán’s purity of heart.
> Lacking this, all those ways and means could never have
> been brought to bear. Verily, God is the Mover of
> heaven and earth.

The Guardian made the transfer of the remains of Mírzá
Mu˙ammad-‘Alí Afnán one of the goals of the Ten-Year
Crusade; the Bahá’ís of Iraq identified his grave, and transferred
his remains to the Bahá’í cemetery in Baghdad. The Hands of the
Cause of God residing in the Holy Land informed the Bahá’í
world community of the achievement of this goal of the plan on
June 14, 1959.11

Mosul

Mosul is another place which appears in the stories from
Memorials of the Faithful. In fact, the city of Mosul has been
mentioned twenty eight times in the book—this could be due to
a number of reasons, some of which are enumerated as follows:
o Mosul is one of the places where the caravan of

> Bahá’u’lláh on His way to Istanbul chose to stop and rest
> for a few days.

o About four to five years after Bahá’u’lláh left Baghdad,

> some believers of Persian descent were rounded up and
> were sent to Mosul in captivity including the family of
> Bahá’u’lláh.
o For some believers who traveled to Edirnih or ‘Akká via

> land, Mosul was one of the cities through which they
> passed on their way from Baghdad to Syria.
o Mosul is an old city near the ruins of the city of Nineveh

and was built on it.
o Mosul and Nineveh is the city of Jonas the prophet which

> is mentioned in the Old Testament as well as the New
> Testament, and in the Qur’án.

Now we will offer brief explanation regarding the above topics.

Mosul: Bahá’u’lláh’s Caravan Passed Through

Mosul is located some 350 km north of Baghdad and built on
the eastern banks of the river Tigris. Bahá’u’lláh’s caravan
stopped briefly in Mosul on its way to Istanbul. H.M. Balyuzi
gives a detailed accounts of this phase of the land travel of
Bahá’u’lláh to Istanbul [King of Glory 182]. In addition, the
Guardian writes: “In Mosul, where He tarried three days...” [GPB

\[156\] 

Mosul: Place of Captivity of Believers

Mosul is also the place of captivity for some Persian
believers. Approximately five years after Bahá’u’lláh left
Baghdád, through the mischief of the Consul General of Iran in
Baghdád, nearly seventy believers were arrested and sent in
captivity to Mosul for nearly twenty years. Included in this
group was the third wife of Bahá’u’lláh known as Gawhar
Khánum. Her marriage took place sometime in Baghdád before
the declaration of Bahá’u’lláh’s mission. While Navváb and
Mahd-i-’Ulya travelled with Him in all His exiles, Gawhar

Khánum remained in Baghdad with her brother, Mírzá Mihdiy-i-
Káshání. Bahá’u’lláh writes in the Tablet to the King of Persia:
“O King! The lamps of equity have been extinguished, and the
fire of tyranny hath so blazed on every side that My people have
been led as captives from Zawra’ [Baghdád] to Mosul, known as
Hadba.” In here, by “My people” He means his third wife,
Gawhar Khánum.

In this captivity, a believer who rendered unique and valued
services to the community was Mulla Zaynu’l-‘Abidin, named by
Bahá’u’lláh Zaynu’l-Muqarrabín (The Ornament of Those Who
are Nigh). He acted as a father in relation to this small band of
believers. Under his supervision a ‘charity fund’ was established.
His knowledge and learning, his understanding of the Faith, his
intelligent and well-balanced personality, together with a
delightful sense of humour, endeared him to the believers and
made him the focal point of the community. Bahá’u’lláh had
also instructed him in His Tablets to gather the friends together,
exhort them to unity and love, encourage them to deepen in the
Faith, and help them to attain heavenly qualities. He spent most
of his time transcribing the Writings of Bahá’u’lláh and making
them available to the friends. In particular he had to make
several copies of those Tablets which were addressed to some or
all of the believers in Mosul, and give each one a copy [Revelation
of Bahá’u’lláh II, p. 335].

The Bahá’ís in Mosul, under the leadership and guidance of
Zaynu’l-Muqarrabín, soon became a model Bahá’í community
reflecting something of the spirit of the ‘Akká community.
While in Mosul, it became Zaynu’l-Muqarrabín's task to
transcribe the Tablets of Bahá’u’lláh that arrived from ‘Akká on
their way to Iran. Thus these Tablets could be distributed more
widely and each of those to whom a Tablet was addressed could
have a copy.

In the course of one of his journeys, Óájí Mírzá Haydar-‘Ali,
the Angel of Carmel, visited Mosul. He has written his
impression about the community in his popular book “Bahjat-us

Sudur”, Delight of Hearts. Mr. Taherzadeh has translated and
quoted this report:

> I attained the presence of Zaynu’l-Muqarrabín and other
> loved ones of God in Mosul including Áqá Mírzá
> Mu˙ammad-i-Vakil. The latter, owing to destitution,
> had to work as a cobbler in spite of old age... The
> friends in Mosul, together with the person of Zaynu’l-
> Muqarrabín, made one remember the days spent in
> Bahá’u’lláh’s holy presence in the holy city of ‘Akká.
> These believers were living in the utmost unity and
> harmony. They vied with each other in their efforts and
> their services. They had no desire except first, to gain
> the good pleasure of the Blessed Beauty, and secondly, to
> attain His presence... [Revelation of Bahá’u’lláh II, p. 335]

In October 1885 Bahá’u’lláh gave permission for Zaynu’l-
Muqarrabín to go to ‘Akká where he took up residence in the
Khán-i-‘Avamíd, continuing to transcribe Tablets and
frequently having the honor of being in Bahá’u’lláh’s company.
