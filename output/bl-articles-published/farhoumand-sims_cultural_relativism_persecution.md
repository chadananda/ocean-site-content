       BAHÁ’Í-INSPIRED PERSPECTIVES ON HUMAN RIGHTS
The Universal Declaration of Human Rights, Cultural Relativism and

the Persecution of the Bahá’ís in Iran

The Universal Declaration of Human Rights,
Cultural Relativism and the Persecution of

the Bahá’ís in Iran

BY CHESHMAK FARHOUMAND-SIMS

In 1979, a revolutionary movement in Iran toppled the powerful regime of
Reza Shah Pahlavi. Under the leadership of the Ayatollah Khomeini, the new
regime declared itself the Islamic Republic of Iran, and established a new
government based on the Islamic Shari’a.1 In an effort to consolidate its power,
the new regime quickly began a campaign to eradicate all remnants of the pre-
vious regime and to destroy anything deemed un-Islamic. One of the earliest
victims of the clerics’ wrath was the Bahá’í community, the largest religious
minority in Iran. 2 The persecution of the Bahá’ís is not a new phenomenon, and
has been a part of Bahá’í history from its founding in mid-nineteenth century
Iran. Their oppression however took on new force and intensity under a lead-
ership determined to create a ‘pure’ Islamic state, and annihilate any trace of
what it wrongly accused of as a ‘community of infidels.’ The Bahá’í community of
Iran first responded to this persecution by appealing to the state apparatus
within Iran. When these pleas for tolerance proved fruitless, Bahá’í communi-
ties outside of Iran began to appeal to their governments, the international
community and its non-governmental instruments for support. Thus began se-
vere criticism by governments and international organizations against the Is-
lamic Republic’s human rights record, and an international campaign in support
of ending the persecution of the Bahá’ís.

The persecution of the Bahá’ís in Iran provides a unique case to test the
efficacy and applicability of international instruments created for the protec-
tion of human rights. This particular case study raises important questions about
the universality of human rights principles in a diverse world; the difference
between individual and group rights; and the dilemma of finding compromises
between opposing systems of law. Moreover, the Bahá’í case challenges the
international community to find creative ways to uphold and enforce the noble

ideals enunciated in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights fifty years ago.
It is not within the scope of this paper to adequately analyze many of the rel-
evant aspects of this discussion. 3 This paper will attempt to explore these themes
by discussing the controversial universality debate surrounding the Universal
Declaration of Human Rights by comparing Western and Islamic notions of
human rights. Moreover, the paper will examine the religious justifications
provided by the Iranian regime for the persecution of the Bahá’ís, and seek to
demonstrate that there are no grounds, religious, moral or political for such
oppression.

The Universal Declaration of Human Rights

The notion of human rights is not new. Although Western historians and
theorists highlight the European contribution to the development of human rights
discourse, a diverse body of literature suggests that human rights has been a
topic of discussion in many cultures throughout human history. The teachings of
all the world’s religions make reference to human rights and include thorough
philosophical dialogue on the subject. The ‘Golden Rule’ which admonishes the
treating of others as we wish to be treated, is an ideal found in the Holy Scrip-
tures of all Faiths; Hinduism, Buddhism, Taoism, Jainism, Confuscianism, Zoro-
astrianism, Judaism, Christianity, Sikhism, Islam and the Bahá’í Faith. 4
Furthermore, religious philosophers representing all the faiths have contrib-
uted to the development of the theory and practice of human rights within their
societies. One of the earliest historical examples of respect for human rights
is illustrated in the reign of the Persian King, Cyrus II (550 C.E.) who bestowed
citizenship and all its privileges to those the people inhabiting the lands he
conquered. It was Cyrus who ordered the rebuilding of Jerusalem and its
Temple, and returned the gold and silver vessels that King Bebuchadnezzar
had confiscated from the Jerusalem Temple years earlier.5 This clearly sug-
gests that the notion of human rights is neither new, nor Western.

The earliest Western discussions of human rights are found in the English
Magna Carta of 1215. The principles presented in this document were further
elaborated in 17th century Europe with contemporary philosophical discussions
of natural rights and the dignity of the individual by Locke, Rousseau and oth-
ers. These discussions were conceptualized within the framework of a social
contract and finally found legal expression in documents such as the English
Bill of Rights (1689), the American Declaration of Independence (1776), the
French Declaration of the Rights of Man and Citizen (1789), and the American
Bill of Rights (1791).6

The Universal Declaration of Human Rights, Cultural Relativism and

the Persecution of the Bahá’ís in Iran

It was the events of the 1940’s and the horrific realities of the Second World
War however, that served as the backdrop for a concerted and universal effort
to develop a system of international organization and human rights protection.
Prior to 1945, states were the only recognized subjects of international law, and
protected by the laws of sovereignty. The unprecedented brutality and depth
of suffering under the extremist regimes of Spain, Germany, Italy and Japan
led to such worldwide shock and disbelief that the need for protection of the
individual from state apparatus became evident and served as the impetus for
the United Nations’ 1947 appointment of the Commission on Human Rights. The
Commission was made up of representatives from 10 nations, chaired by Mrs.
Eleanor Roosevelt and given the seemingly impossible task of creating a uni-
versal code for human rights practices which would be short, simple, easy to
understand, expressive and “acceptable to all the Members of the United Na-
tions.”7 It took over eighteen months for the Commission to complete its ob-
jective, and present to the General Assembly of the United Nations a blueprint
for the worldwide promotion and protection of human rights, seen as a neces-
sary prerequisite for international peace. President Franklin Roosevelt’s 1941
speech to the US Congress which outlined the four freedoms,8 together with
drafts submitted by States and non-governmental groups served as the inspira-
tion for the text of the document. After considerable consultation and delibera-
tion, the United Nations General Assembly adopted the Universal Declaration
of Human Rights (UDHR), on December 10, 1948.

The UDHR is perhaps one of the most significant documents written in the
history of humankind. The text of this document has been hailed as “one of the
greatest steps forward in the process of global civilization” whose impact “ex-
tends to the moral, political and legal spheres.”9 The UDHR not only lay the
foundation for international human rights law, but more importantly introduced
the individual person as a subject of international law. The rights articulated in
the UDHR can be divided into two main categories. The first group is civil and
political rights. These include the right to life, liberty and security of the per-
son; freedom from slavery and torture; equality before the law; protection
against arbitrary arrest, detention and exile; the right to a fair trial; the right to
own property and participate in politics; the right to marriage; the fundamental
freedoms of thought, conscience and religion, opinion and expression; free-
dom of peaceful assembly and association; and the right to take part in govern-
ment. The second group is economic, social and cultural rights which include:
the right to work, form and join unions; the right to an adequate standard of
living, education and full and free participation in cultural life.10

Three central principles provide the basis for these rights. The first pro-
claims that human rights are inherent. This implies that human rights “can not be

the Persecution of the Bahá’ís in Iran

enumerated or deduced; they are not earned or acquired but inhere in all people
by virtue of their humanity alone.”11 The second principle delineates every
human being’s basic rights as indefeasible or inalienable, meaning that “such
rights can never be annulled or denied by outside parties or even by the af-
fected individuals themselves.12 The third and final principle declares that any
conflicts between different rights must be resolved in accordance with just and
impartial laws and procedures.13

Today, in addition to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which with
the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights and the In-
ternational Covenant on Civil and Political Rights 14 there are over eighty uni-
versal and regional conventions that provide the framework for modern
international human rights law. In adopting these instruments, “the international
community not only agreed on the content of each right set forth in the Univer-
sal Declaration, but also on measures for their implementation.”15 Moreover,
these conventions endorsed the United Nations’ resolution which stated that
“the enjoyment of civil and political rights and economic, social and cultural
rights are interconnected and interdependent.”16

Universality, Cultural Relativism and the Universal Declaration of Human
Rights

Despite the noble and progressive ideas articulated in the Universal Dec-
laration of Human Rights, the document has faced severe criticism from its
inception. Much of the controversy revolves around the question of the univer-
sality of the theory and application of the UDHR. The challenge this has pre-
sented to the human rights movement has been theoretical, practical and
political.17 And allowed many states to continue repression of their citizenry,
by arguing for cultural relativism. The controversy gained momentum in 1948,
when the American Anthropological Association published its famous state-
ment rejecting the “applicability of the Declaration of Human Rights to man-
kind as a whole” and stressing that “the rights of Man cannot be circumscribed
by the standards of any single culture, or be dictated by the aspirations of any
single people.” 18 These cultural relativists contend that “other people’s truths
are contained in their own classification and understanding,” and that no one
culture offers a “self-evidently privileged standard of verity.” 19 For relativists,
there are no “overarching, universal moral truths, or principles or universal
cultural ideals.”20

Other cultural relativists have focused on the ‘Western’ premise of human
rights discourse. They assert that human rights are a “Western construct with
limited applicability”21 and argue that human rights norms “possess a distinc-

tively Western or Judeo-Christian bias, reflecting assumptions that the values
of other cultures, peoples and races are inferior.”22 Hence, the opposition of
non-Western societies to the UDHR for its emphasis on individual rights and
freedoms at the detriment of personal responsibilities to the community and
cohesive values. A third criticism questions the UDHR for its emphasis on civil
and political rights. Although the UDHR emphasizes the interdependence of
civil/political rights with social/economic/cultural rights, it has been the case
that Western members of the General Assembly tend to favour the former. The
underdeveloped world challenges this preference and argues that civil and
political rights are meaningless and irrelevant if a certain level of economic
development is not achieved by the populace. This point is well taken and
demonstrates the cultural difference in the applicability of the principles out-
lined in the UDHR.

Today, scholars supporting the notion of moral universalism pose a serious
challenge to the human rights controversy, and make it increasingly difficult for
cultural relativists to uphold their position. 23 The work of these universalist
scholars - mainly anthropologists and sociologists - seems to suggest that the
debate directly relates to the relativists’ confusion between principle and ap-
plication, and illustrates that while the “concept of human rights is universal, the
content varies among different societies.”24 They defend their position by pro-
viding evidence of certain moral precepts transgress cultural and traditional
boundaries. These include the universal intolerance for lying, stealing, and
incest as well as “the prohibition of murder or maiming without justification;
economic justice; reciprocity and restitution; provisions for the poor; and pri-
ority for immaterial goods [such as freedom.]” 25 The debate created enough
disunity among the nations to be one of the main points of discussion at the
World Conference on Human Rights in Vienna in 1993. Many participants at
this gathering, particularly those representing the developing world “concerned
with cultural imperialism argued that while human rights are universal, their
interpretation and implementation is subject to national and regional particu-
larities and various historical, cultural, and religious backgrounds.”26 Despite
these concerns however, the member States agreed to signing the Vienna Dec-
laration which among other things stated that, “Respect for human rights and for
fundamental freedoms without distinction of any kind is a fundamental rule of
international human rights law…” Further, the Vienna Declaration addressed
the question of cultural relativity by reaffirming that:

> All human rights are universal, indivisible and interdependent and interrelated. The inter-
> national community must treat human rights globally in a fair and equal manner, on the
> same footing, and with the same emphasis. While the significance of national and regional

> particularities and various historical, cultural and religious backgrounds must be borne in
> mind, it is the duty of States, regardless of their political, economic and cultural systems,
> to promote and protect all human rights and fundamental freedoms.27

The signing of this document does not mean there is a universal consensus
on the subject of human rights, and there is still a need to translate principle
into practice. The debate persists and serves a political purpose for the justifi-
cation of immoral acts. Opposing notions of freedom, conscience, and expres-
sion lie at the heart of this situation.

The Bahá’í Faith: An Introduction to History and Teachings

The Bahá’í Faith was founded in mid-nineteenth century Iran through the
teachings of two successive Founders who are regarded by Bahá’ís as Divine
Messengers. The first of these was a young Persian merchant from Shiraz, who
in May 1844, proclaimed that He was the bearer of the latest Revelation from
God. The Báb,28 explained that his revelation served a dual purpose: one to
reaffirm the teachings of past Faiths, and secondly to announce the imminent
appearance of yet another Divine Messenger, whose teachings would inspire
global unification and moral and spiritual transformation. The Báb’s teachings
were well-received by a great number of people, and attracted tens of thou-
sands of followers within a short time. In 1863, one of the Báb’s leading dis-
ciples, a Persian of noble birth announced that He was the Messenger whom
the Báb had referred to during His ministry. This second religious figure in
the Bahá’í Faith is known to history as Bahá’u’lláh. 29 Through the power of His
person, and the force of His teachings, Bahá’u’lláh was able to affirm His claim
and within a short period of time, many surviving B ábis professed their faith in
Bahá’u’lláh. Thus began the Bahá’í Faith.

With this new development, the government of Nasir’ul-Din Shah30 decided
that the best way to destroy the Bahá’í community was to exile Bahá’u’lláh and
His family out of Iran. This exile did not extinguish the development and
spread of this young Faith, and actually promoted it. By the time of Bahá’u’lláh’s
passing, the Faith had spread beyond Iran’s borders and included followers in
the Indian subcontinent, Asia, several Arab nations and northern Africa. By the
mid-1950’s, the Bahá’í Faith had been introduced in almost every country in the
world. The central teachings of the Bahá’í Faith are: the oneness of God, the
progressive nature of divine revelation; and the oneness of humanity. The third
principle is the pivotal concept around which all other Bahá’í teachings re-
volve. These include: the abolition of all forms of prejudice; the full equality
of rights and opportunities between men and women; universal education and

economic justice. For the Muslim clerics of the time, one of Bahá’u’lláh’s most
contentious teachings was His insistence that “humanity has entered an age of
maturity and no longer requires clergy and ritual in its search for the Divine.
He introduced the principle of the inherent right and indeed responsibility of
each individual to investigate the truth for himself, and instituted consultation
and group decision-making as the key to individual and societal development.
Bahá’ís are also prohibited from participation in partisan politics and are obliged
to obey the laws of the government under whose authority they live.31 These
last two teachings are particularly relevant to this study and will be further
discussed.

Today, the Bahá’í Faith is recognized as a world religion and respected in
the international community not only for its social teachings but for its applica-
tion of principle to practice as demonstrated in the community’s commitment to
peace, justice, and social-economic development. The Bahá’í International Com-
munity (BIC) represents the worldwide Bahá’í community at the United Na-
tions and enjoys consultative status with UNESCO and ECOSOC. Today, there
are over five million Bahá’ís in 180 countries of the world, representing every
ethic, racial and religious background. With the absence of a clergy, the com-
munity functions on an elaborate administrative order laid down by Bahá’u’lláh
Himself. This administrative order is based on elected bodies at the local,
national and international levels.32 At the local level, adult members of the
community (age 21 and older) annually vote for nine members from the commu-
nity in an election which prohibits electioneering and nominations and is based
on secret ballots. Each community then elects a number of delegates to repre-
sent them at the national convention electing the national administrative body.
Finally, every five years, members of the National Councils elect the interna-
tional governing council, the Universal House of Justice.

The Persecution of the Bahá’ís in Iran: Historical Developments

Throughout history, the advent of every new religion has resulted in the
persecution of its members. Particularly in the formative phase of the religion’s
development, ‘believers’ have been the object of violence and oppression for
their spiritual convictions. The persecution of the Bahá’ís in Iran is a classic
example of human rights violation resulting from religious intolerance. And,
despite Bahá’í commitment to non-violence, tolerance and governmental quies-
cence, they are classified as ‘unprotected infidels’ who do not enjoy any rights
under the present Iranian constitution. 33 Much of the conflict can be attributed to
the general population’s “almost universal ignorance of the religion’s nature,
teachings and history.”34 resulting in a deep-rooted prejudice against the mem-

bers of this community. The persecution began in 1844, when thousands began
to accept the Báb’s claim that He was the much awaited Qa’im35 of Shi’i Islam.
The Báb’s claim and His teachings, in addition to His repute attracted the atten-
tion of the Muslim clergy who saw Him as a threat and responded with brutal
force. In 1850, the Báb was executed in the city of Tabriz and the clergy began
a pogrom which resulted in the death of over 20,000 of His followers. These
incident were so large in scale and brutal in force that they “aroused the revul-
sion of Western diplomats and scholars, and deeply scarred the Persian psyche,
inspiring an effort to justify the killing of thousands of innocent people by
excoriating the victims’ beliefs and intentions.”36 The systematic effort to eradi-
cate the Bábis proved unsuccessful, but they continued to be the target of oppo-
sition and oppression under the leadership of Bahá’u’lláh.

Bahá’u’lláh’s noble lineage protected him from execution, but not from
arrest and an imprisonment which lasted 40 years. From Iran, He and his family,
and a small community of followers were exiled to Baghdad, Adrianople,
Constantinople and finally the Ottoman Empire’s prison city of Akka where He
died in 1892. The persecution of His followers continued. Under the Qajar
Kings,37 oppression of the Bahá’í community was a national policy which led to
occasional killings, usually at the hands of the populace. For example, in 1903,
101 Bahá’ís were killed in the city of Yazd after the local Mullahs encouraged
their congregation to disperse into the streets and kill any Bahá’ís they meet. 38
The end of the Qajar dynasty and the beginning of the Pahlavi dynasty in 1925,
introduced a number of important changes with consequences for the Bahá’í
community. One of the goals of both Pahlavi Kings was to transform Iran into a
modern, secular state. In order to do so, they pursued a policy aimed at exclud-
ing the clergy from influencing the social and cultural aspects of Iranian society,
and began a systematic attempt to secularize the country, which included such
things as prohibiting women from wearing the traditional chador, 39 and appoint-
ing highly educated individuals in positions of authority.

The Bahá’í minority, representing some of the most educated people in
Iranian society were among those appointed to posts in the civil service while
denied constitutional rights.40 The Shah also appointed a number of Bahá’ís to
prominent positions in his government. The Bahá’í law prohibiting involve-
ment in politics prevented these individuals from being able to accept these
political posts. There is only one recorded case where a Bahá’í accepted such
an appointment to the Cabinet. Consequently, his administrative rights in the
Bahá’í community were removed. It is worth noting that the Bahá’í community
provided a political pawn for the Shah. When faced with cleric opposition,
both Pahlavi Shahs used the persecution of the Bahá’í community as a means of
appeasement. These included the destruction of holy places, the closing of

Bahá’í schools, inciting mob attacks on Bahá’ís, particularly in the rural villages,
and confiscation of property. This death and destruction was brought to the
attention of the international community by foreigners stationed in Iran, and
resulted in United Nations intervention in 1955 following a particularly violent
period.

The revolution in Iran in 1979, and the acquisition of power by the Islamic
clergy introduced a new chapter in the suppression of the Bahá’ís in Iran. Even
before the establishment of the Islamic Republic and his return to Iran, Khomeini
made his position on the Bahá’í minority very clear in an interview conducted
in December 1978, by saying that in an Islamic Iran, “Bahá’í citizens would have
no rights whatsoever.”41 In formulating a new constitution, the theocratic regime
of Ayatollah Khomeini confirmed the status of Jews, Christians and Zoroastri-
ans as ‘protected minorities’42 but the Bahá’í community was deprived of any
constitutional rights. The exclusion of the Bahá’ís from the constitution meant
that “Bahá’ís enjoy no rights of any sort, and that they can be attacked and perse-
cuted without impunity.”43 Islamic courts denied Bahá’ís of the right of redress
and protection against crimes including assault, killings and other forms of per-
secution, and ruled perpetrators as not liable for damages because their vic-
tims are “unprotected infidels.”44 The inevitable consequence of this, and the
negative messages delivered in the mosques and the media inevitably resulted
in violent incidents across the country. Bahá’ís were beaten, young girls were
kidnapped and raped, Bahá’í cemeteries were desecrated, holy places were
destroyed, and Bahá’í homes and businesses being burned. By 1980, the gov-
ernment began to participate in this campaign and prominent Bahá’ís, mostly
those serving on local and national administrative bodies were arrested and
imprisoned. This was followed by mock trials and led to the first set of execu-
tions in June 1980.45

Under government decree, Bahá’í marriages were declared null and void,
and Bahá’í marital life reduced to the status of prostitution and children de-
clared illegitimate. Bahá’í children were expelled from schools and universi-
ties, and retired Bahá’ís declared no longer eligible for pensions and ordered
to pay back the pension they had thus far received.46 At first, the response of the
Bahá’í community was to appeal to local authorities in their efforts to end the
persecution. After years of trying to no avail, the international Bahá’í commu-
nity began to bring this matter to the attention of their respective governments
while the Bahá’í International Community (BIC) at the United Nations began a
campaign to bring the plight of the Iranian Bahá’ís to the attention of the interna-
tional community through the instruments of international organization.

Documents obtained through the Iranian media found their way to Amnesty
International 47 and other human rights organizations which immediately exposed

the Iranian objective to completely obliterate the Bahá’í community in Iran.
This led to almost universal international outrage; leading to severe criticism
of the Iranian government from individual governments and within the United
Nations. Despite the international condemnation, more than 200 Bahá’í men,
women and children were executed by the Iranian government between 1978
and 1988. Many others were arrested, disappeared, and were presumed dead.
One particularly disturbing incident involved the hanging 10 women in the city
of Shiraz, for their refusal to recant their Faith and convert to Islam. 48 The
women ranged in age from 16, to the early twenties and two were senior citi-
zens. Their execution followed the execution two days earlier of six men,
which included the husbands, fathers and sons of four of these women. 49 The
judge presiding over their trials was quoted in the Iranian newspaper Khabar-
i-junúb, as saying “If the Bahá’ís do not recant their faith, the day will soon come
when the Islamic nation will God willing fulfill the prayer of Noah: Lord leave
not one single family of infidels upon the earth.”50

In August 1983, the Public Prosecutor of the Islamic Revolution declared
that Bahá’í religious institutions should be banned, its institutions ordered to
dissolve and its members declared guilty of criminal offenses.51 In accordance
to the Bahá’í law of obedience to one’s government, the Bahá’í community im-
mediately complied and dissolved its local and national administrative bodies,
and ended all administrative activities. Letters were sent to the government to
announce the community’s compliance with the decree, and asked to be allowed
to practice their Faith in the privacy of their own home. On 21 September 1983,
the prosecutor-general released a statement announcing that,

> If a Bahá’í himself performs his religious acts in accordance with his own beliefs, such a
> man will not be bothered by us, provided he does not invite others to the Bahá’í Faith, does
> not teach, does not form assemblies, does not give news to others, and has nothing to do
> with the administration.52

This statement however, did not protect the Bahá’ís from further oppression
and was followed by a new series of arrests and executions. This resulted in
new international opposition and a series of United Nations resolutions against
Iran. The Iranian government responded by reducing the number of executions
and releasing a number of Bahá’í prisoners. The international community how-
ever continued its protest and called for the immediate release of all Bahá’í
prisoners and the exercise of tolerance toward the Bahá’í community.

In 1984, the United Nations Commission on Human Rights adopted a new
resolution calling for the appointment of a special representative, responsible

for the human rights situation in Iran, and the treatment of Bahá’ís in that country.
Mr. Andres Aguilar was appointed to the post and was replaced in 1986 by Mr.
Reynaldo Galindo Pohl who made three visits to Iran under the mandate of the
United Nations Human Rights Commission. In anticipation of Mr. Pohl’s first
visit in January 1990, the Iranian government began to release a large number
of the more than 750 imprisoned Bahá’ís. Moreover, Bahá’í children were al-
lowed to return to school, but still forbidden university attendance. While the
BIC acknowledged the improvement in conditions in Iran vis-à-vis the Bahá’ís,
it noted that the Bahá’ís were still denied access to their holy places, prohib-
ited from practicing their Faith and excluded from the constitution. This was
confirmed by Mr. Pohl’s report. Mr. Pohl was invited for a second visit in Octo-
ber 1990. This trip proved less fulfilling than the first, as illustrated in Mr.
Pohl report stating that

> With respect to the situation of the Bahá’í minority, many documents signed by adminis-
> trative authorities have been received, providing evidence of discrimination, confiscation,
> rejection by universities, suspension of pension, demands for the return of pensions earned
> and paid, denial of passports and other irregularities … This keeps the Bahá’ís in a per-
> petual state of uncertainty about their activities. The government should therefore be
> requested to take effective action to ensure that these Iranian citizens enjoy the same
> civil and political rights as the rest of the population.53

A third visit was initiated in December 1991 to assess improvements in Iran
resulted in more severe criticism of Iran’s human rights practices, particularly
against the Bahá’ís who did not present any threat to the Islamic regime and its
mandate. This third report noted that while there had been no further execu-
tions, harassment and discrimination continued in the same manner as stated in
the representative’s previous report. Following these harsh reports, the situa-
tion of the Bahá’ís seemed to worsen. For the first time in four years, a Bahá’í
prisoner was executed in March 1992. This was followed by several random
murders and two more execution orders.

In 1993, a secret government memorandum drafted by the Supreme Revolu-
tionary Cultural Council discussing the policy relating to the ‘Bahá’í question’
was discovered. 54 This document clearly stated that the government’s objective
is to ensure that the “progress and development” of the Bahá’í community “shall
be blocked.” 55 The paper included the signature of President Ali Kham8enei
and exposed the true intention of the Iranian government toward the Bahá’í
community. The situation of the Bahá’ís has somewhat improved since 1992.
Although two Bahá’ís were killed in 1997 - and four are presently under death
sentence, two of these for apostasy - the number of Bahá’í prisoners has been

reduced to less than 20. Children are again allowed to register and attend school,
and Bahá’ís are more easily able to travel to and from the country. But this does
not mean that Bahá’ís live freely without harassment and discrimination. They
may be arrested for religious belief. Bahá’í youth are still prohibited from
attending university and most recently the fourth year of high school. Employ-
ment discrimination continues in the form of denial of jobs and pensions, and
the right to inherit property is denied. Most importantly, they are denied the
freedom to practice their Faith as a community, and to elect administrative
bodies despite the fact that “they have never engaged in illegal activity nor
participated in any form of opposition to the government.”56

The Ideological Roots of the Persecution of the Bahá’ís In Iran

There are two ideological sources to the persecution of the Bahá’ís in Iran,
one theological, and the other social. The first relates to the Bahá’í belief that
Bahá’u’lláh is the latest Messenger of God with teachings for this age in the
development of humanity. According to Muslim interpretations of the Qur’an,
the Prophet Muhammad is the last of God’s Divine Messengers, the seal of the
prophets.57 In light of this verse and its interpretation, Bahá’ís are seen as her-
etics and apostates who have renounced the true religion of God for belief in
heresy. This classification of Bahá’ís as apostates condemns them to death as
prescribed by the Qur’an and the Sunna.58

The second pertains to particular teachings in the Bahá’í Faith that were (and
are) perceived as a threat to the Islamic establishment and social order. The
most contentious of the Bahá’í teachings from the perspective of the Muslim
clergy has been those pertaining to equality of rights and opportunities for the
sexes, which has been regarded as a moral threat, and the abolition of the
clergy which they perceived “would bring to an end the system of tithes, en-
dowments, social precedence, and political power which they have always re-
garded as their religious right.” 59 Both of these, played a role in provoking the
latest episode of persecutions in Iran. The accusation of apostasy however, has
served as the most profound premise for persecution. This relates directly to
Western and Islamic notions of human rights and particularly the freedom of
conscience and religion.

Western Notions of Human Rights

Present-day Western (Judeo-Christian based) and Islamic notions of what
constitutes individual human rights and freedoms are deeply tied to the his-

torically related philosophical developments within each of these civiliza-
tions. The history of Western Christianity illustrates a constant struggle to dis-
tinguish between the ‘personal’ and the ‘external’ which in society has translated
into a separation between church and state, thus “restricting the legitimate con-
trol of civil coercion over religious life.” 60 As Little explains,

> …to hold that true belief is not a matter of external causes, but of deeply felt inward
> motions, is to affirm, by implication, the importance of establishing a “free zone” where
> individuals are permitted to negotiate their spiritual life according to the dictates of their
> own best inner judgment.61

Early Christianity focused on the intensifying of the inner, personal experi-
ence and contributed to the development of the idea of conscience as a natural
and abiding focus of attention which served as “a private monitor, as a deeply
internal self-reflective and self critical operation that defined, at bottom, what
it meant to be a self or a person.”62 Hence Christian thought came to admonish
freedom of conscience. The writings of Thomas Aquinas and St. Augustine were
instrumental in this development. Little explains that for Aquinas “a person’s
will is totally dependent upon the recommendations for action put to it by the
conscience” and therefore “the argument moves in the direction of tolerating
conscientiously held beliefs and actions with which one may profoundly dis-
agree.” 63 D’arcy’s study of Aquinas and Augustine shows that both agree that “The
act of faith is essentially a free act; without an interior, free choice of the will
there is no valid act of faith at all. It is therefore not lawful to use compulsion
in any way to force Jews or pagans to accept the Christian Faith.”64 In the final
analysis, as St. Augustine affirms that “a person can do other things against his
will; but belief is possible only in one who is willing… unwilling belief is an
impossibility. The only valid act of faith is that which proceeds from a free,
interior choice.”65 This has translated into practice in the way that Christians - in
general - may disagree with another creed, but will not seek to force change.

These Western ideals have clearly inspired the relevant portions of all
United Nations documents relating to human rights, and particularly those dis-
cussing the freedom of conscience and religion. These documents define the
individual person as, “a spiritually free being who is, within wide limits, ac-
corded sovereignty over mind, conscience, and spirit…”66 This leads to the
belief that,

> …the right to religious freedom and conscience rests upon the deep conviction that
> human beings are fulfilled in being guided by ‘reason’ and by persuasion, rather than by
> external ‘causes’ and controls. In short, to conceive of human beings in terms of an indefea-
> sible ‘right to freedom of thought , conscience, religion and belief’ in the words of the
> Declaration against Intolerance, is itself to affirm and to seek to guarantee the ‘natural’
> irreducibility of the human spirit.67

Islamic Notions of Human Rights

Unlike Christianity, Islam does not make a separation between the spiritual
and the civil. For Muslims, the Qur’an represents a complete book of laws
pertaining to one’s spiritual as well as social existence. Hence, there is no
separation in Islam between ‘church’ and state. As seen under the leadership of
the Islamic caliphs, spiritual and temporal power were inseparable and inter-
connected.

In matters of law, Islam does not make a separation between the spiritual
and the civil, and Muslims agree that the Quran is the undisputed source of all
law in Islamic society. Of the approximately 500 Quranic verses, approxi-
mately 80 are considered as articles of code, and beyond this, Muslims rely on
sunna, ijma, and Qíyás for further guidance and clarification on laws:68
1. The sunna to the oral traditions that are extracted from reliable sources

> about the sayings and activities of the Prophet Muhammad, providing clari-
> fication about conduct.
2. Ijma refers to the decisions that are arrived at through consultation and

consensus among learned learned scholars of Islam.
3. Qíyás refers to comparison by analogy69 which provides further clarifi-

> cation on laws and ordinances. Shia Islam does not use Qíyás, and pre-
> fers to rely on ‘aql or reason.
Islam recognizes that human beings can reject this guidance, “although they
cannot produce any valid excuse for its rejection.”7 0 Hence, “human beings are
given the choice to accept or reject the faith, and they bear the consequences of
their choice.”7 1 Rejection leads to misguidance which the Qur’an considers as
“God’s response to unsatisfactory actions or attitudes on the part of individuals
who have chosen to reject the faith.”7 2 A second relevant point is the Muslim
distinction between islam (submission), and iman (faith), “that is, between a
submission to sacred authority that might be coerced or compelled by human
beings … and the faith born of voluntary consent, free of human coercive inter-

ference, developing from a keen spiritual and moral awareness and motiva-
tion.”7 3 The Qur’an clearly suggests that it is God who puts iman in the heart of
man, which thereby produces islam. Qur’anic verses clearly state that compul-
sion is not allowed. 7 4 Another example reads,

> And if thy Lord had willed, whoever
> is in the earth would have believed,
> all of them, all together. Wouldst thou [O Muhammad]
> then constrain the people, until
> they are believers?
> It is not for any soul to believe
> save by the leave of God; and He lays
> admonition upon those who have
> no understanding.75

This has been interpreted to suggest that “submission to the will of God
must come through voluntary consent” and that “even the Prophet, the bearer of
revealed guidance, should not compel the people to believe.”7 6 Hence, the
Qur’an, the most authoritative of the three sources of jurisprudence teaches the
freedom of conscience and religion.

I have attempted to demonstrate that there is agreement in Islamic and West-
ern notions of the freedom of conscience and religion. The tolerance expressed
in Islamic scripture however, does not extend to believers who then choose to
change their faith. These individuals are designated apostates who have broken
their covenant with Allah and the Prophet, and present a threat to the umma, the
community of believers. The problem of applying Islam’s liberal principles
into practice arises then, in relation to other scripture within the Qur’an ex-
pressing intolerance for disbelief, encouraging compulsion to Islamic Faith
and prescribing severe punishing for those who do not believe. The essence
of the legitimization of the Islamic Republic’s persecution of the Bahá’í commu-
nity therefore, lies within these passages and their interpretation.

Islamic Opposition to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights

Islamic opposition to the UDHR began in the early days of deliberation on
the document, and focused primarily on Article 18 which states:

> Everyone has the right to freedom of thought, conscience and religion; this right includes
> freedom to change his religion or belief, and freedom, either alone or in a community with
> others in public or in private, to manifest his religion or belief in teaching, practice, worship
> and observance.77

The opposition was so great in fact, that a number of Islamic countries unsuc-
cessfully attempted to delete this article all together. Objections were ex-
pressed again in relation to two proposed sections of the International Covenant
on Civil and Political Rights, namely section 2 stating that “No one shall be
subject to coercion which would impair his freedom to have or to adopt a
religion or belief of his choice” and article 26 which added a further guarantee
of equal protection of the law against any form of discrimination “on any ground
such as race,… sex,… or religion.”7 8 Tabandeh explains this vehement conten-
tion as follows:

> Freedom of thought, of conscience and of belief is allowable [in Islam] to the extent that
> it does not clash with the Qur’an or with Islamic Canon Law. No one’s freedom gives him
> the right to blaspheme or to curse God, His Prophets or His Saints. Whoso commits this sin
> is liable to punishment.79

This narrow interpretation of the Qur’an’s teachings on the freedom of con-
science and religion may relate not only to the seemingly contradictory verses
in the Qur’an on the subject, but is also largely a consequence of the historical
development of Islam, and the textual and historically based preoccupation
with “the political threat of religious unbelief.”80 Hence the liberal spirit of
Islam as discussed earlier in the paper, must be weighed against statements in
the Qur’an “demanding the use of force in achieving one of the central ideals of
Islamic revelation, the creation of a just social order.”81

The historical roots of this intolerance are more profound. When the Prophet
Muhammad died in 632 C.E., there was immediate threat of division and dis-
unity within the community in regards to His successor. The community se-
lected Abu Bakr, a long time companion of the Prophet as the temporal and
spiritual leader of the uma. One of the greatest challenges facing Abu Bakr as
a new leader was to keep the tribes of Arabia united. In order to facilitate this
“Abu Bakr, and jurists since then, condemned secession from Islam (ridda) as
“an offense both against God and against the state: it is both apostasy and trea-
son.”82 This attitude illustrates the Islamic emphasis on the individual’s obliga-
tion not only to God but to community, and demonstrates the primacy of collective
over individual rights. Tabandeh articulates the Muslim position in his book A

Muslim Commentary on the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. He explains
that:

> Religious minorities who follow the one true God and the revelation given to a prophet of
> His - like Jews, Christians, Zoroastrians - enjoy complete freedom within limits of their
> own faith, can pursue its services and ceremonies openly and make their lives conform to
> its regulations and precepts. But followers of a religion of which the basis is contrary to
> Islam, like those who demand Islam’s extirpation, have no official rights to freedom of
> religion in Islamic countries or under an Islamic government, nor can they claim respect
> for their religion, any more than in certain countries definite political parties which are
> contrary to the ideology of the regime can claim freedom since they are declared to be
> inimical to the welfare of that land and people.83

Hence, the presence of non-Muslims who are not referred to in the Qur’an
as people of the book is perceived as a great threat to both Islam and its com-
munity. And for the protection of the faith, the land and the people, this pres-
ence must be controlled and if possible, removed.

The most recent Muslim opposition has been to the draft of the Declaration
on the Elimination of All Forms of Intolerance and of Discrimination Based on
Religion or Belief. Efforts there resulted in the United Nations General As-
sembly decision to change some of the wording in the Declaration referring to
the “right to choose, adopt, or change one’s religion,84 thereby allowing for
Muslim states to ratify this convention. Again, Tabandeh attempts to present the
Muslim opposition to choice and changing of faith by stating,

> There are also difficulties in accepting this clause in that it affirms the individual’s freedom
> to change his religion and confession … the decision to change religion may be forced on
> a person under pressure or duress: or again it may be induced by false motives like the
> desire to get a divorce under the easier conditions of some other doctrine. There is
> however, a still more important and fundamental objection to the freedom to change
> religion. No man of sense, from the mere fact that he possesses intelligence, will ever turn
> down the better in favour of the inferior. Anyone who penetrates beneath the surface to
> the inner essence of Islam is bound to recognize its superiority over the other religions. A
> man, therefore who deserts Islam, by that act betrays the fact that he must have played
> truant to its moral and spiritual truths in his heart earlier. If he pleads doubt as his reason, he
> must be saved from uttering falsities by a calm discussion. These are all possible motives.
> Their very nature makes it plain that they should not be given encouragement of any kind,
> let alone by an international law. Such a pronouncement as this clause permitting freedom
> of choice can only result in confusion both in the individual’s mind and in the moral and
> spiritual stability of society.85

There are a number of problems associated with this statement. On the one
hand, Tabandeh acknowledges the gift of intelligence, on the other he suggests
that freedom would lead to confusion in the individual’s mind. The claim of the
superiority of Islam is also troublesome in that it presents an exclusivist and
ethnocentric view which has served as a premise for persecution throughout
Islamic history of those classified as apostates.

Allegations of Apostasy and the Persecution of the Bahá’ís in Iran

Apostasy is considered the most bane of crimes in Islam, and “has come to
be included in Islamic law as one of the hudad, or capital crimes, along with
adultery, defamation and slander, alcoholism, theft, brigandage, treason, mur-
der and armed rebellion.” 86 Islam distinguishes between two types of apos-
tates; The first refers to fetri apostates “who break with their faith” that is,
“whose parents are Muslims, and who was born into the Islamic ‘fetre’ or tradi-
tion, but after coming of age turns from his religion.”87 According to the Qur’an,
for these individuals there is no repentance,88 “for he has deserted his natal
faith and traditional philosophy.89 Such a person is “like a diseased member of
the body politic, gangrenous, incurable, fit only for amputation, and must be
executed.”90 Another example of a fetri apostate is one who embraces Islam and
then changes his mind. Such an individual must be reasoned with for three days.
If he does not repent and return to the Fetre, he too is punishable by death
under the law of the Shari’a.

The second category of apostasy refers to those “who break loyalty as a
citizen, e.g. one who contravenes the constitution or plays traitor against his
own government …”91 Such a person is also perceived as a threat to social
order and is punishable by death. Tabandeh and other Islamic jurists 92 adopt this
extremist position based on their interpretation of textual references that con-
demn the apostate to death. For example, Sura 4: 89 says,

> They [the disbelievers] wish that you should disbelieve as
> they disbelieve, and then you would be
> equal; therefore take not yourselves
> friends of them, until they emigrate in
> the way of God; then if they turn their backs,
> take them and slay them wherever you find them;
> take not to yourselves any one of them as friend or helper.

And again in Sura 5:33,

> This is the recompense of those who fight
> against God and His Messenger, and hasten
> about the earth, to do corruption there:
> they shall be slaughtered, or crucified, or their hands and feet shall
> alternately
> be struck off, or they shall be banished
> from the land. That is a degradation for them
> in this world; and in the world to come awaits them a mighty
> chastisement.

According to Sachedina, the severe prescription decreed in these Qur’anic
passages are reinforced by statements of the Prophet as reported in the hadith.
These include stories of Muhammad having said that “He who changes his reli-
gion must be killed” and by reports of apostates losing their hands and feet
before being killed during the Prophet’s lifetime.93

The question that arises in one’s mind is how can there be two different
messages expressed in the Qur’an and Sunna; one of tolerance and forbiddance
of compulsion and the other prescribing force in conversion, and death as a
punishment for those who do not. Dr. Abdullahi An-Na’im explores this dis-
crepancy in his analysis of Shari’a in the book Toward an Islamic Reformation:
Civil Liberties, Human Rights and International Law. Dr. An-Na’im points out that
whereas the Qur’anic verses revealed in Mecca encouraged peaceful persua-
sion, and allowed for the freedom of choice to accept or reject Islam, the Qur’an
and Sunna of the Medina stage sanctioned, and under certain conditions re-
quired the use of force in conversion and the punishment of death for those
who refused Islam. He explains this inconsistency by explaining that,

> To reconcile these apparent inconsistencies, the founding jurists engaged in a process of
> naskh (abrogation or repeal) of certain texts of the Qur’an and Sunna to produce a coher-
> ent and comprehensive system of Shari’a which was consistent with the totality of the
> Qur’an and Sunna. Thus, to justify compulsion as opposed to freedom of choice in religion,
> and to give legal efficacy to verses sanctioning the use of force against non-Muslims and
> renegade Muslims, the founding jurists deemed that the verses enjoining freedom of
> choice and peaceful persuasion were abrogated or repealed by the verses authorizing
> compulsion and the use of force.94

An-Na’im argues that these decisions based on ijma are inadequate and inap-
propriate because ijma is “never to be exercised in matters governed by clear
and definite texts of Qur’an and Sunna.”95 Hence, the jurists’ decision on the
subject being based on their interpretation on the Medina-stage revelation as
binding law (because they were not changed by the Prophet before his death)

may be flawed. And therefore, evidence that the Qur’an allowed for freedom
of choice in the practice of religion, the Shari’a is based on a more limited and
politically motivated interpretation.

The Bahá’ís have long been accused of apostasy. In the case of those who
were arrested and provided with a trial, the charge entered has always in-
cluded apostasy. In every case, Bahá’í individuals were given the opportunity
to recant their faith and return to Islam, and in so doing enjoy freedom or face
death. In the vast majority of the cases, despite severe torture and threats to
one’s families, Bahá’ís refused to denounce their faith. However, there were a
number of Bahá’ís, who did sign the statement of recantation. In these cases, the
government would publish a copy of the statement in the local newspapers as
evidence of their success.

Other Allegations Related to the Persecution of the Bahá’ís in Iran

In addition to the charge of apostasy, Bahá’ís have been accused of support-
ing the Shah’s regime; of being Western agents determined to destroy Iran’s
traditional Islamic society; and of being agents of Zionism and spies for Israel.
These are clearly false allegations. The Bahá’í duty to obey their government
would not allow for Bahá’ís to support or denounce the Pahlavi regime, and the
Bahá’í community was in no way responsible for its rise to power or its fall
therefrom. Under the Pahlavi regime, Bahá’ís did not accept political positions
in government, and focused their activities on in the civil service, non-political
positions in government, and philanthropy.

The Islamic regime’s affiliation of the Bahá’ís to Zionism and Israel stems
from the location of the Bahá’í world centre in Haifa, Israel. This is not associ-
ated in any way to Bahá’í support - or lack thereof - for the state of Israel, but
relates to the fact that Bahá’u’lláh’s last venue of exile and place of death was in
that area, then known as Palestine. Bahá’u’lláh was imprisoned, and subsequently
under house arrest in Akka, until his passing in 1892. His prison cell, his home
and his place of burial have been holy places of great significance for Bahá’ís
around the world long before the state of Israel was created. These allegations
provide the Iranian leadership with a convenient rationale to continue their
religiously motivated persecution. They and many in the general population
know that allegations of Bahá’ís political support for the governments of the
Shah, the ‘Evil West’ and Israel are completely false. Though these excuses are
used to justify persecution under the guise of treason, it is a well known fact
that the Bahá’ís are persecuted for one reason only, their religious convictions.

Conclusion

Every day, religious persecution occurs somewhere in the world. Iran is
not the only perpetrator, and the Bahá’ís are not the only victim. The Universal
Declaration of Human Rights and its associated covenants were created to end
this tragedy. Unlike previous eras, individuals and communities are theoreti-
cally protected under the various Articles of the UDHR guaranteeing a variety
of rights and freedoms. At the present time, the Bahá’ís of Iran are denied all
the rights and privileges guaranteed in the Universal Declaration, to which Iran
is a signatory. They are not entitled to all the rights and freedoms set forth in
the UDHR (article 2); they do not enjoy the right to life, liberty and security of
the person (article 3); they have been subjected to torture and inhuman punish-
ment (article 5); they do not have the right of recognition as a person before the
law (article 6); they do not enjoy equal protection without discrimination under
the law (article 7); they have been and continue to be subjected to arbitrary
arrest and detention (article 9); when arrested, they are not provided with a
fair and public hearing by an independent and impartial tribunal (article 10);
they are not presumed innocent until proven guilty (article 11); they have been
subjected to arbitrary interference with privacy, home, family and correspon-
dence (article 12); they did not and some still do not have freedom of move-
ment (article 13); they do not have the right to own property (article 17); they do
not have the right to freedom of conscience and religion (article 18); they do
not have the right to the freedom of peaceful assembly and association (article
19); they do not enjoy equal access to public services (article 21); they do not
have the right to social security (article 22); they are denied the right to work,
and equal pay (article 23); they do not have an adequate standard of living (ar-
ticle 25); and they are deprived of the right to education (article 26).96

The case of the Bahá’ís, and other examples of religious persecution chal-
lenge the efficacy and potency of the United Nations and the Universal Decla-
ration of Human Rights from protecting individuals from persecution and human
rights violations. The case of the Bahá’ís however, also shows that international
pressure can indeed bear fruit and help to protect victims of oppression. The
concerted criticism of the international community and the United Nations clearly
prevented another potential holocaust in this century. As we approach the twenty
first century, it is of utmost importance for the United Nations and its member
nations to increase their commitment and efforts to human rights protection.
One important dimension of this has been the promotion of human rights edu-
cation. Human rights education has been defined as

> training, dissemination and information efforts aimed at the building of a universal culture
> of human rights through the imparting of knowledge and skills and the molding of attitudes
> which are directed to: strengthening of respect for human rights and fundamental free-
> doms; full development of the human personality and the sense of its dignity; promotion
> of understanding, tolerance, gender equality and friendship among all the nations, indig-
> enous peoples and racial, national, ethnic, religious and linguistic groups; enabling of all
> persons to participate effectively in a free society; and the furtherance of the activities of
> the United Nations for the maintenance of peace.97

After all, “Knowledge of basic human rights by the individual is necessary
because, ultimately, human rights are respected and protected - or violated - by
individuals, even if they are acting in some official capacity.”98 To recognize
the significant role of education in protecting and promoting human rights, the
United Nations General Assembly has proclaimed 1995 - 2005 as the United
Nations Decade for Human Rights Education.

The United Nations should make it a goal to impart human rights education
at all levels of society, from children to government leaders. Furthermore, the
United Nations General Assembly should consult on ways to enforce the ob-
jectives of the UDHR. It should be clear that as signatories, national govern-
ments are bound - and should be required - to fulfill their obligations to the
UDHR and the United Nations, or be reprimanded. Only then can the transla-
tion of principle to practice become feasible.

57 Qur’an 33:40. The exact verse reads: “Muhammad is the father of no man amongst you. He is the

> Apostle of God and the Seal of the Prophets.” An analysis of this verse however, in comparison
> with other verses of the Qur’an and the sunna, along with historical contextualization suggests
> alternative interpretations which show that the Muslim interpretation may not be accurate. For
> an in-depth analysis of this issue see: Farhoumand, C. (1989). The Seal of the Prophets: A Bahá’í
> Interpretation. Unpublished paper.
58 The sunna represents a compilation of oral histories or hadith, some said to date back to the

time of the Prophet, which provides guidance and further elaboration on the Islamic life as

exemplified in the life of the Prophet Muhammad and his closest peers.
