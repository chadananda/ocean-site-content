## The Báb's Epistle on the Spiritual Journey towards God

> **Abstract:**  
>   
> One of the earliest, if not the earliest, extant compositions of the Báb is a brief discussion of the mystic quest, entitled Risála fi's-Sulúk. This work is extremely important for the light it sheds on the Báb's relationship to the Shaykhi movement and to Siyyid Kázim in particular. It was written well before two other early works (Tafsír súrat al-Baqara and Tafsír súrat Yásuf/Qayyum al-Asmá). However, the concerns and topics of this earlier work continue to appear in the Báb's later writings. The discussion will highlight the Qur’ánic verses and the Hadíth that form the basis of the Báb's teaching about the mystic quest in this Epistle, together with some thoughts on the nature of the teaching itself. A preliminary translation will be offered of the entire text and, it is hoped, improved upon by fellow conference attendees.

                                 The Spi ritual Journey towards God

The Báb’s Epistle on the Spiritual Journey towards God

by Todd Lawson

Introduction to the translation

he preliminary translation offered here is of the Risála fi’s-sulúk (Tehran Bahá’í Archives Ms. 6006. C.,

T       pages 73-74, 23 lines per page), one of the Báb’s earliest extant Writings—perhaps the earliest. 1 The

Risála begins on the seventh line of page 73. I am grateful to Stephen Lambden who years ago supplied
me with a xerox of this privately published “edition.” I have no knowledge of its manuscript base. Denis
MacEoin in his Sources for Early Bábí Doctrine and History, pp. 44, 196 (n.b. under Risálat at-tasdíd) lists
five privately published “editions” for the Risála (among which this is one) and observes that the original Work
“appears to have been written during the later years of Sayyid Kázim Rashtí’s life (and thus before the com-
mencement of the Báb’s own career).” (p. 44) Here MacEoin has chos en to translate sulúk as “right behavior,”
but the contents and concerns of this brief piece strongly suggest that a more accurate rendering would be
“journey,” “spiritual search,” or even “mystic quest.”

The first translation of the text, below, is offered without the encumbrances of copious notes and references,
except as indicated by small caps (indicating a quotation from the Qur’án) and quotation marks (indicating a
quotation from the hadíth) and other minor punctuation (Arabic has no punctuation s ystem analogous to
English usage). Much of this same Qur’ánic and hadíth material will continue to figure prominently in later
Writings of the Báb. For example, the relatively lengthy quotation from the Hadíth Kumayl in this short work
is noteworthy because it shows the importance the Báb attached, from the beginning, to this celebrated and
widely-commented-upon short sermon of ‘Alí ibn Abí Tálib, the first Imám of the Shí‘a and prime bearer of
post-prophetic spiritual authority and charisma (waláya). The Hadíth Kumayl is also known as the Hadíth
má’l-haqíqa, viz, the s acred words in answer to the question “What is divine reality?” It should be noted, also,
that this very important hadíth is not found in the canonical Nahj al-balágha. Reference to it by the Báb is sig-
nificant because it shows that He was deeply engaged in the long, venerable and exceedingly rich Shí‘í mys-
tical—or gnostic—discourse associated with it. Indeed, the Báb also wrote a separate commentary devoted
solely to this sermon (Sources, p.199). In the Bábí/Bahá’í tradition, interest in the Hadíth did not stop with the
Báb; one of His more prominent followers eventually adopted one of its distinctive formulations, subh-i-azal,
“Dawn of Eternity,” as an honorific title. Bahá’u’lláh Himself also makes repeated reference to this sermon
throughout His Writings as when, in referring to another one of the sermon’s distinctive ideas, He speaks of
the “veils of glory” (subuhát al-jalál, “delusions of grandeur”). The literal meaning, “lofty praises of divine
glory,” suggests that one must rigourously avoid equating one’s understanding of sublime divine qualities with
the absolute unknowable essence of God. “Veils of glory” is a symptom of spiritual disease diagnosed origi-
nally by ‘Alí.

The translation offered here also demonstrates, if s uch were necessary, how important the Qur’án was for
the Báb. It is most important to point out that while many of the Qur’ánic quotations or references are very
brief, their appearance in this text is also meant to s timulate in the mind of the reader the immediate scriptur-
al context that they represent in addition to the relevant distinctive Shí‘í exegetical tradition. Therefore, in the
accompanying notes some of the unquoted Qur’ánic context is supplied.

Finally, this Risála shows quite clearly the interest the Báb had in and His attachment to the teachings of
Shaykh Ahmad and Sayyid Kázim. Apart from the explicit mention of the latter, the basic quaternary structure
of the discourse reflects Shaykhí teachings. The understanding of the “next world” (Paradise or Hellfire) as
spiritual conditions, rather than places, is also a distinctive Shaykhí teaching and shows how that synthesis
combined the languages of Sufism and Shí‘ism. I plan to offer a fuller account of these features of the Risála
in a future article which will contain, in addition to a translation of the Hadíth Kumayl, the Báb’s separate com-
mentary on it, a study of Shí‘í exegesis of the text and a discussion of the Qur’ánic and other Hadíth material
in addition to a discussion of related writings from the masters of the Shaykhí school.

In some cases, the translation violates strict literalness in the interest of readability. Qur’án translations are
based upon those of Yusuf Ali. I should like to record my debt to Dr. Muhamed Afnan who years ago kindly
agreed to look over a preliminary edition of the Arabic text and offer several valuable suggestions based upon
his precious and intimate knowledge of the Báb’s writings and manuscripts of the Risála not available to me.
All errors in the translation are mine and mine alone.

For those who would like to pursue a more detailed study of the Risála I offer a second translation (follow-
ing the first, below). This one does have a few notes scattered throughout the text and is more technical in gen-
eral. In this connection, it is important to mention the manner in which the Báb expresses His ideas through
the poetic and “musical” use of a few key Arabic roots, the most frequent being Q-W-M (straightness, rising,
standing), B-W-B (gate), W-H-D (oneness). Here, again, the Composition would appear to follow the rules of
improvisation.

The Báb’s “Journey towards God” : the Risálah fi’s-Sulúk ilá Alláh*

IN THE N AME      OF   GOD,   THE   M ERCIFUL ,   THE   C OMP ASSIONA     TE **

> Be steadfast, O seeker of piety, in the station of affirming the divine unity. As God, exalted be He, has said:
> AS FOR THOSE WHO SAY “OUR LORD IS GOD ” THEN CONTINUE STEADF AST , THE ANGELS DESCEND UPON THEM SA Y -
ING “ FEAR NOT , NOR BE GRIEVED , AND RECEIVE GOOD NEWS OF THE GARDEN WHICH YE WERE PROMISED !”

Know ye that “the paths to God are as numerous as the breaths of the creatures” yet, there is N O S OUL but
ONE and there is no religion but the one religion, and it is the CAUSE OF GOD . AND OUR COMMAND IS BUT A SIN -
GLE ACT .

SO SET   THOU THY FACE STEADIL Y TO THE TRUE FAITH                —THE     NATURE MADE BY G OD —IN WHICH               H E HAS    MADE MEN .

THERE IS   NO ALTERING GOD 'S CREA TION .

> Verily, Religion is supported by four pillars:
> 1) Affirming the divine unity
> 2) Prophethood
> 3) Guardianship, and
4) The community of true believers

> These are four gates, none of which is of any use without the others.

And all of this is the F ACE OF GOD WHICH WILL NEVER PERISH . And this is the love of the Family of God which
is the same as the love of God. This is the Hidden Treasure to which the Prophet, upon Him and His family be
peace, openly alluded when He said: “Above each good is another good until one loves us, and when one loves
us there is no good higher.”

So love, beloved, lover, and Beloved are four divine signs appearing from the radiant self-manifestation of
the family of God in you and in your soul. Whenever these four signs are remembered within you and your heart
is illumined, and your soul stirred, and your spirit moved and your body quakes with longing, then you are truly
among the people of paradise and the companions of the Commander of the Faithful, upon him be peace.

Indeed, at such a time you are in conformity with the TRUE RELIGION and the TRUE BALANCE and the obvious
and clear PATH. Above this station there is no good.

Thus one ascends unto the abode of the permanence of God.

> There is no end to the love of God and no finish.
This is the guiding principle of the search.

There can be no question, the Sharí‘a in its entirety is one method in the quest of the servant for his Lord, but
it must be according to the guiding principle and goal as I have described.

As for the road to attaining the guiding principle—know that attainment to the station of your own sign is
attainment to your Lord. And this is the station of pure piety towards God, exalted be He, as when one of the
prophets asked of God, praised be He, “How can we attain to Thee?” God, may He be exalted, said, “Cast away
thyself and rise to Me.”

And this is why the station of the novices is conditional upon denying the self what it passionately desires
and forcing upon it what it detests because there is no veil more base for the servant than his own self.

By God! If you struggle against your self you will by and by send it to the station of nearness and remem-
brance and intimacy in the shade of your Beloved and adore Him above all else, to the extent that even if you
were cut to shreds you would not be negligent of His station. Because, the [true] knower is he whose heart is
with God; such a one has no speech, thought, nor act except in, by, with and about God, exalted be He.

Neglect not your personal struggle and thereby forfeit   THY POR TION IN THIS WORLD BUT DO THOU GOOD AS     GOD
HAS BEEN GOOD TO THEE .

And if you are neglectful it will be your great loss on the Day of the Return and you will say: “AH ! W OE       IS
ME !—IN THA T   I NEGLECTED MY DUTY TOWARDS G OD!”

So pass on whither we have been ordered and fear not THE REPROACHES     OF THOSE WHO FIND FAUL T.   THIS   IS THE
GRACE OF GOD WHICH      HE WILL BEST OW ON WHOM HE PLEASETH AND GOD          IS THE OWNER OF ALL GRACE AND THE
ALL -KNOWING .

Flee from whatever distracts you from God. Indeed such is a deadly poison which will consume you in flames
though you be unaware.

NAY, WERE YOU     TO KNOW WITH CER TAINTY OF MIND YOU WOULD BE AWARE .       YOU   SHALL CER TAINL Y SEE HELLFIRE    .

AGAIN YOU SHALL     SEE IT WITH CER TAINTY OF SIGHT

It is incumbent upon you to abandon the world and all that is in it. Indeed, it is the chief of all evils. And in
your quest do not linger in any one station. Thus a dog of the Jews is better than the people of the marketplace
because the people of the marketplace are the people of spiritual torpor. Verily, this lingering is the source of
that negligence which bars access to God.

Verily, the world and the hereafter are two spiritual states. If you turn towards God, exalted be He, then you
are in paradise and if you are occupied with your self then you are in hell and in the world. Therefore under-
stand these allusions and sever thyself from all unworthy habits and lusts. Endure patiently the alienation of peo-
ple and the blame of the companion and the Schadenfreude of the enemy from among family and offspring.

And when you have begun your quest according to this METHOD of search, then the gate of God will open to
your soul and you will request entrance into the realm of the holy one.

> For the people of insight these subtle allusions will suffice:
> “Rend the veils of glory and allusions and efface the idle fancies and rend the veils and be attracted to the
exclusive unity—the quality of affirming the divine unity until the light of dawn shines forth from” the sun of
thy reality and YOU ENTER THE CITY of unity WHILE ITS PEOPLE ARE UNA WARE “and extinguish the lamp” of every-
thing that has veiled you from God, exalted be He, so that you will attain to the PRAISED ST ATION that God, exalt-
ed be He, has promised the people who glorify God at night—that is to say the turning towards the absolute
divine unity in the midst of intense darkness, as in the verse: I T MAY BE THA T THY LORD WILL RAISE THEE UP TO
A PRAISEWOR THY STATION .

And THIS BOOK , on the WAY of search, is kept brief for those possessed of insight and in it is that which will
be sufficient for the pure amongst the affirmers of the divine unity. The particulars have been fully written about
by my master, my support, my teacher, the pilgrim Sayyid Kázim al-Rash tí, may God lengthen his life and bring
forth from it good results. So seek the WAY OF YOUR LORD MADE SMOOTH FOR THEE . THERE COMETH FOR TH FROM
THEIR BELLIES A DRINK DIVERSE OF HUES , WHEREIN IS HEALING FOR MANKIND AND A MERCY ; WHILE THE OPPRESSORS
INCREASE ONL Y IN RUIN .

Annotated translation of
The Báb’s “Journey towards God” : the Risálah fi’s-Sulúk ilá Alláh

> IN THE N AME OF GOD , THE MERCIFUL , THE C OMP ASSIONA TE 2

Be steadfast (QWM),3 O seeker of piety (TQW), 4 in the s tation (QWM) of affirming the divine unity (WHD).5
God, exalted be He, said:

AS FOR THOSE WHO SAY “OUR LORD IS GOD ” THEN CONTINUE STEADF AST (QWM), THE ANGELS DESCEND UPON
THEM SAYING “FEAR NOT , NOR BE GRIEVED , AND RECEIVE GOOD NEWS OF THE GARDEN WHICH YE WERE PROMISED !”
(Qur’án 41:30; cf. 46:13)

Know ye that “the paths to God are as numerous as the breaths (anfás) of the creatures,” 6 while there is NO
SOUL but ONE (nafs wáhida; WHD; cf. Qur’án 4:1; 31:28; 39:6), and that there is no religion but the one reli-
gion (dín wáhid; WHD), and it is the CAUSE OF GOD (amr Alláh; Qur’án 33:37; 49:9 and passim). AND OUR COM -
MAND (amruná) IS BUT A SINGLE (ACT ) (wa má amruná illá wáhida; WHD Qur’án 54:50; the second half of the
verse, not quoted here by the Báb, continues: AS THE TWINKLING OF AN EYE ).

S O SET THOU (fa-’aqim; QWM) THY FACE STEADIL Y TO THE TRUE FAITH — THE NATURE MADE BY G OD (fitra
alláh)—IN WHICH HE HAS MADE MEN . T HERE IS NO ALTERING G OD 'S CREA TION . (Qur’án 30:30; cf. the end of this
verse and Qur’án 30:31-32 alluded to here but not explicitly quoted by the Báb: THA T IS THE RIGHT RELIGION
(al-dín al-qayyim; QWM), BUT MOST PEOPLE DO NOT KNOW . 31: TURN YE BACK IN REPENT ANCE TO HIM AND FEAR
HIM (ittaqúhu; TQW), ESTABLISH REGULAR PRA YERS (wa’aqímú al-salát; QWM), AND BE NOT OF THOSE WHO JOIN
GODS WITH GOD (wa lá takúnú min al-mushrikín). 32: THOSE WHO SPLIT UP THEIR RELIGION AND BECAME MERE
SECTS (shí’an), EACH PARTY REJOICING IN WHAT THEY HAD WITH THEM .)

> Indeed, (true) Religion is supported (mutaqawwam; QWM) by four pillars.
> 1) Tawhíd (affirming the divine unity)
> 2) Nubuwwa (prophethood)
> 3) Waláya (guardianship), and
4) Shí‘a (the community of true believers)

> These are four gates (abwáb, sing. báb BWB) of which no one is of any use without the others.

And all of this is the FACE OF GOD (wajh Alláh ) WHICH WILL NEVER PERISH . (cf. Qur’án 28:88). 7 And it (i.e.

this “face of God”) is the love of the Family of God (hubb ál Alláh) 8 which is the same as the love of God (wa
huwa nafs hubb Alláh). This is the Hidden Treasure9 to which the Prophet, upon Him and His family be peace,
openly alluded when He said: “Above each good is another good until one loves us, and when one loves us
there is no higher good above it.”10

So love (hubb), beloved (habíb), lover (muhibb), and Beloved (mahbúb) are four divine signs (áyát) appear-
ing from the self-manifestation of the family of God (tajallí ál Alláh) in you and they are your soul. 11

Whenever these four signs are remembered within you and your heart is illumined, and your soul stirred,
and your spirit moved and your body quakes with longing (shawq), then you are truly (haqqan) among the peo-
ple of paradise and the companions of the Commander of the Faithful, 12 upon him be peace.

At s uch a time you are indeed upon the TRUE RELIGION (al-dín al-qayyim, Qur’án 30:30; QWM) and the TRUE
BALANCE (al-qistás al-mustaqím, Qur’án 17:35 and 26:182; QWM) and the obvious and clear PATH (al-sirát al-
wádih al-mubín). Above this station (QWM) there is no good (hasana).

> Thus one ascends unto the abode of the permanence of God (baqá’ Alláh).13
> There is no end to the love of God and no finis h.
> This is the guiding principle (qutb) of the search.14

Indeed the Sharí‘a in its entirety is a method for the quest of the servant for his Lord, but by movement

Lights of ‘Irfán

according to the guiding principle (qutb) as I have described.

As for the road to attaining the guiding principle (qutb)—know that attainment to the station (QWM) of your
sign is attainment to your Lord. And this is the station of pure piety (TQW) towards God, exalted be He, as
when one of the prophets asked of God, praised be He, “How can we attain to Thee?” God, may He be exalt-
ed, said, “Throw down thyself and rise to Me.” 15

And this is why the station (QWM) of the novices (al-mubtadi’ín) is conditional upon denying the self what
it passionately desires and forcing upon it what it detests because there is no veil more base (awhash) for the
servant than his own self.

By God! If you struggle against your self and thereby send it to the station of nearnes s and remembrance
and intimacy in the shade of your Beloved and adore Him above all else, even if you were cut to shreds you
would not be negligent of His station because the knower is he whose heart is with God and he has no speech,
allusion nor act except in, by, with and about God, exalted be He.

Neglect not your personal struggle (ijtihád) and thereby forfeit THY POR TION IN THIS WORLD BUT DO THOU
GOOD AS GOD HAS BEEN GOOD TO THEE . 16

And if you are neglectful it will be your great loss on the Day of the Return and you will say: “A H! W OE IS
ME !—IN THA T I NEGLECTED MY DUTY TOWARDS G OD !” (Qur’án 39:56) 17

So pass on Whither We Have Been Ordered18 and Fear Not19 THE REPROACHES OF THOSE WHO FIND FAUL T .

THAT IS THE GRACE OF GOD WHICH HE WILL BEST OW ON WHOM H E PLEASETH AND G OD IS THE OWNER OF ALL GRACE
AND THE ALL -KNOWING . (Qur’án 5:54) 20

Flee from whatever distracts you from God. Indeed such is a deadly poison which will consume you in
flames while you are unaware. NAY, WERE YOU TO KNOW WITH CER TAINTY OF MIND (‘ilm al-yaqín) (YOU WOULD
BE AWARE ). YOU SHALL CER TAINL Y SEE HELLFIRE . AGAIN YOU SHALL SEE IT WITH CERTAINTY OF SIGHT (‘ayn al-
yaqín). (Qur’án 102:5-7)

It is incumbent upon you to abandon the world and all that is in it. Indeed, it is the chief of all evils. And in
your quest do not linger in any station. Verily, a dog of the Jews is better than the people of the marketplace
because the people of the marketplace are the people of lingering (ahl al-wuqúf). Verily, such is the source of
that negligence which bars access to God. 21

Indeed, the world and the hereafter are two spiritual states. 22 If you turn towards God (19), exalted be He,
then you are in paradise and if you are occupied with your self then you are in hell and in the world. Therefore
understand these allusions (ishárát) and sever thyself from all habits and lusts. And endure patiently the alien-
ation of people and the blame of the companion23 and the Schadenfreude of the enemy from among family and
offspring.

And when you have begun your quest along this path of search, then the gate of God (báb Alláh; BWB) will
open to your soul and you will request entrance into the realm of the the Most Generous (mulk al-karím).

> For the people of insight these subtle allusions [will suffice]:24

“Purge” to the highest possible degree “the sublime praises of divine glory” of “allusions” and “efface the
idle fancies and rend all veils and be attracted to the divine exclusive unity—[by] the quality of affirming the
divine unity until the light of dawn shines forth” from the sun of thy reality and YOU ENTER THE CITY of unity
WHILE ITS PEOPLE ARE UNA WARE 25 and extinguish the lamp26 of everything that has veiled you from God, exalt-
ed be He, so that when you attain to a PRAISED STATION 27 (QWM) such as God, exalted be He, has promised the
people who glorify God at night28 that is to say the turning towards the abs olute divine unity in the midst of
intense darkness, SOON THY L ORD WILL RAISE THEE UP TO A PRAISEWOR THY STATION . (QWM)29

And THIS WRITING on the METHOD (sabíl) of search, is kept brief for those possessed of insight and in it is
that which will be sufficient for the pure amongst the believers in the divine unity. The particulars have been
fully written about by my master, my support, my teacher, the pilgrim Sayyid Kázim al-Rashtí, may God
lengthen his life and bring forth from it good results. So seek the WAY31 OF YOUR LORD MADE SMOOTH FOR THEE .
THERE COMETH FOR TH FROM THEIR BELLIES A DRINK DIVERSE OF HUES , WHEREIN IS HEALING FOR MANKIND AND A

Appendix

Hadíth Kumayl*

> Kumayl bin Ziyád asked ‘ Alí:
> “What is reality?”
> ‘Alí replied: “What are you compared to reality?” (i.e., “How dare you ask such a question!”)
> Kumayl said: “Are you not the master of your own secret knowledge?” (i.e., “What is the matter, can’t you
answer my question?”)

‘Alí replied: “Most certainly (balá)! But you will receive only a few drops of the ocean of knowledge that
overflow from the abundance of my own knowledge.”
Kumayl: “Is it like you to disappoint a questioner?”

‘Alí responded: “reality is dispersing the clouds of glory without allusion.” (al-haqíqat kashf subuhát al-
jalál min ghayr ishára = [The perception of] reality [is achieved only in] dispelling one’s delusions of grandeur
in vain attempts to compare that reality with anything whatsoever.)

Kumayl said: “Explain this further!”
> ‘Alí said: “It is the effacement of vain imaginings with clear consciousness of that which is known.”
> Kumayl said: “Explain this further!”
> ‘Alí said: “It is the rending of the curtain and being overwhelmed by the divine secret.”
Kumayl said: “Explain this further!”

‘Alí said: “It is the irresistible attraction of the exclusive divine unity [achieved] by means of the quality of
affirming the divine unity.”

> Kumayl said: “Explain this further!”
> ‘Alí said: “A light shines forth from the dawn of eternity and it radiates it effects upon the temples conse-
crated to affirming the divine unity.”
‘Alí said: “When the dawn breaks, extinguish the lamp.”

7) The idea of the “face of Go d” is mentioned s everal times in the Qur’án. Its interpretation, like man y other important Qur’ánic

> words and phras es , is high ly controv ersial. One of th e more frequently-q uoted verses in which the “face o f Go d” is men tion ed
> is in the con text of the s tory of the changin g o f th e Qiblih fro m Jeru salem to Mecca. At 2:11 5, the Qur ’án says: UNTO GOD
> BELONG THE EAST AND THE W EST, SO WHITHERSOEVER YE TURN , THERE IS THE FACE OF G OD . LO ! GOD IS ALL EMBRACING, ALL KNOW -
> ING . “Face of Go d” has been interpreted a number of ways. The M anifestation is the “face” of God in th e sen se that He repre-
> sents th e visible aspect of the divine, the Deus Revelatus, as distinct from the eternally hidden aspect o f God, the divine
> Ess ence, th e Deus Absconditus. There is another s ens e in which “face” can be understoo d. The root W-J-H denotes s urface and
> directio n. The derivative jiha means aspect or sense (cf. the French sens “direction” as in the word for “on e way [street]” : sens
> unique. Looked at this way, then the “face” of God, far from den oting or even connoting any crude anthropomorphis m, means
> “God’s direction.” Thus , the above verse says all direction s lead to God. This is in acco rd with the partial hadíth q uoted below
> by the Báb. The direction in which Go d may be sough t is therefore a perfect topic in an epistle devoted to the best way of jour-
> neyin g toward s God. Cf. als o jihát, wajh/wujúh as technical terms in tafsír. A vers e may be said to have s everal wujúh, or

8) hub b ál Alláh ál Alláh , “Family of God,” is most immediately understood as th e Prophet Muhammd , His daughter Fátima and

> the twelve Imáms. Th ere is also a feature of this usage th at indicates “ál” (as distinct from “ahl”) can als o includ e faithful fol-

9) Cf. the Hadíth Qudsí kn own as kuntu kanz an makhfíyan “I was a Hidden Treas ure” an d the commentary on this important had íth

10) Although the relevant sources are full of cou ntless trad itions enjoining the believers to love the Prophet and His Family, I have

> not found a source for this hadíth. Note here, howev er, that the Báb, in the cou rs e of His ep istle on the top ic of the mystic quest
> also provides an interpretation of two key Islamic texts: (1) th e “face o f God” an d (2) the identity of the “Hidden Treasure.”
11) The text is difficult to read h ere. Prev iously, I saw it as fíka wa fí nafs ika. No w I thin k it is really fíka wa hiya nafs ika. One

awaits other mss. to compare this reading with .
12) ‘Alí ibn Abí Tálib , the first Imám of th e Shí‘a, cousin and h alf-brother of the Prop het Muhammad, hu sband of Fátima and

"fath er" of all the oth er Imáms.
13) Trad itional Sufi technical term, u sually seen paired with its con ceptual oppo site “annihilation,” faná’. See, for example,

> Bahá’u’lláh, The Seven Valleys, the Valley of Tru e Poverty and Absolute Nothingness. The bas ic idea is that on e s eeks to anni-
> hilate (faná’) the self, ego (nafs) so that nothing remains (baqá’) except divinity.
14) Qutb is another traditional Su fi technical term. It typically refers to an individual who is the bearer o f spiritual auth ority

> (waláya). It mean s “axis,” “pivot,” and “center.” (The No rth Pole is called, in Arabic al-q utb al-shamálí [shamálí = “north”])
> Although it is generally thoug ht th at the word acquired its meanin g central s piritual au thority in a mo re or less purely Sufi con -
> text, it is important to note that in one o f the most widely celebrated sermons from the Na hj a l-balágh a ‘Alí refers to h ims elf
> as the “pivot of the community ” (qutb al-r ahá). The Báb’s use of this term demons trates one of th e more important featu res o f
> the Shaykhí-Bábí-Bahá’í traditio n, namely that it continued a process of using mys tical termino logy in a Shí‘í context. The idea
> of “center” figures prominen tly in the later Qayyúm al-asmá. See my article “The Coincid entia Oppositorum in the Qayyúm al-
> asmá” available on the World Wide Web at www2.h-net.ms u.edu/bahai/bh pap ers/vol5/tatanj/tatan j.htm
> 15) In the Su fi tradition, this hadíth is ascribed to al-Kharráz, the important n inth-century mystic of Baghdad.
16) Cf. Qur’án 28:77, the story of Qárún . This reference may be a clue to the social class, if not the identity, o f the recipien t of the

tablet. This vers e continues: AND SEEK NOT OCCASIONS FOR MISCHIEF IN THE LAND. FOR GOD LOVES NOT THOSE WHO DO MISCHIEF.
17) Qur ’án 39:56 má farr attu fí janb alláh (janb is a metaphor implying threshold and by ex tension door or gate, viz., báb). The

verse continues: AND WAS BUT AMONG THOSE WHO MOCKED!

> 18) Paraphrase of Qur’án 15:65.
> 19) Qur’ánic diction.
20) The Báb deviates, with remarkable deftness, from the Qur’án in this citation. Again, it is important to no te the men tion of the

> TRUE FRIEND (walí) in th e verse immediately followin g (but u nquoted by the Báb) as well as the other elements of the Shaykhí
> four su pports: YOUR REAL FRIENDS (awliyá, p lural of walí: guardian) ARE NO LESS THAN GOD, HIS M ESSENGER AND THE FELLOW -
> SHIP OF THE BELIEVERS . . . . Qur ’án 5 :55.

21) That is “lingering/loitering/hesitation ” —wuqúf—is “th e source of that negligence which bars access to God.” The root mean -

25) Reference to Qur’án 28:15 and the story of Moses’ act of murder.

Shortly, at 28:1 8, th ere is a mention of DAWN or MORNING. See th e following.
26) This is a brief running commentary, begin ning here with the word “pu rge” and ending with the Qur’ánic word STATION on an

> oft-cited portion of the famous Hadíth Kumayl (see app end ix). The Báb also wrote a commentary on this h adíth (Sources, p.

199 lists 5 “mss .” of this early work.)
27) maqám mahmúd, cf. Qur’án 17 :79 and the later us e of this epithet by Bahá’u’lláh in the Fou r Valleys.
28) ahl al-tahajjud fí al-layl
29) Qur’án 1 7:79. N.b. the un cited previou s verse: ESTABLISH WORSHIP AT THE GOING DOWN OF THE SUN UNTIL THE DARK OF NIGHT,

> AND THE RECITAL OF THE Q UR ’ ÁN AT DOWN. LO ! THE RECITAL OF THE Q UR ’ ÁN AT DAWN IS EVER WITNESSED . A ND SOME PART OF THE
> NIGHT AWAKE FOR IT (fa-tah ajja d bihi), A LARGESS FOR THEE (Qur’án 17:1 78). This connects the Báb’s language, men tion ed in
> the previous n ote to the Qur’án. His reader was expected to g rasp the allus ion withou t His having to explicitly cite the precis e
> langu age. Perh aps , thou gh, the most important allusion His interlocutor was expected to understand was the one to the follow-
> ing verse (17:80 ): S AY “O MY LORD! LET MY ENTRY BE BY THE GATE OF TRUTH AND HONOR, AND GRANT M E FROM THY PRESENCE
> AN AUTHORITY (sultán) TO AID ME .

30) Qur’án 2:2: dhálika al-kitáb may also be translated as THAT IS THE BOOK ( IN WHICH THERE IS NO DOUBT ). Here the Báb shows

> an early instan ce of putting His Writing s in the same category as the Qur’án. This wo uld become one o f the most prominent
> features of His Work as repres ented, for example, in th e later Qayyúm a l-asmá.

31) Different grammar but can h ave the same meaning as the b eginning of following Qu r’ánic quotation.
