           “In the Pure Soil of Thy Heart”
The Heart in Bahá’í Writings and Neurocardiology

Wolfgang A. Klebel

Introduction

The title is to this paper is taken from the Hidden Word of
Bahá’u’lláh, talking about the pure soil of the heart, and
indicating that the seeds of divine wisdom and the water of
certitude will make the soil fertile with divine knowledge. This
beautiful metaphor can be understood in many ways; in this
paper we will try to understand how the physical heart in its
new discovered properties can actually be the seat of knowledge
and right decisions.

> 33. O MY BROTHER!
> Hearken to the delightsome words of My honeyed
> tongue, and quaff the stream of mystic holiness from
> My sugar-shedding lips. Sow the seeds of My divine
> wisdom in the pure soil of thy heart, and water them
> with the water of certitude, that the hyacinths of My
> knowledge and wisdom may spring up fresh and green
> in the sacred city of thy heart. (PHW 33)
In the previous paper the connection of the physical heart
with the spiritual aspect of man was described, here a more
close comparison of the scientific findings of the last decades
will be introduces and used for a better understanding of the
concept of heart as is presented in the Bahá’í Writings

The new science of Neurocardiology has reestablished the
importance of the heart for mental, emotional and physical
well-being. It has reaffirmed the deeper meaning of the
statement of Lucretius (circa 55 B.C.):

> The dominant force in the whole body is that guiding
> principle which we term mind or intellect. This is
> firmly lodged in the mid-region of the breast. Here is
> the place where fear and alarm pulsate. Here is felt the
Lights of ‘Irfán Book Ten                                      132

> caressing touch of joy. Here, then, is the seat of the
> intellect and the mind. 1
The findings of this science are new, as described in an
article on Neurocardiology2 ; and will here presented in some
length, as the information is rather unexpected, even in
scientific circles.

> In the last twenty years, evidence has accumulated for
> the presence of a functional heart brain — first
> described as the “little brain of the heart.” From a
> neuroscience perspective, the nervous system within
> the heart, that is intrinsic to the heart, is made up of
> populations of neurons capable of processing
> information independent of extra cardiac neurons
> (including those of the CNS3 ).
> This collection of neurons can sense alterations in the
> mechanical and chemical milieu of various regions
> throughout the heart. With every beat of the heart,
> changes in heart rate and regional dynamic changes are
> detected and transduced into neuronal impulses that
> are processed internally. Such information is also sent
> to neurons in the base of the brain via afferent axons
> in the vagus nerve and to the spinal column neurons via
> afferent axons in sympathetic nerves. This information
> is returned via efferent neurons controlling the heart.
> Furthermore, circulating hormones influence the
> behavior of the little brain of the heart.
It must be noted here that this “little brain” of the heart can
function independently from the cortical brain, as is evident in
heart transplants, where the heart continues functioning, even
when it is not yet connected to the brain.

Another aspect to be considered anew is the function of the
ANS, or what ‘Abdul-Bahá called the sympathetic nervous
system. “This nervous system has been assumed to be
independent of reason, beneath consciousness, functioning in
an autonomous fashion.” And further “the fact that our ANS
rarely impinges on our consciousness, however, should not be
interpreted as indicating that it is ‘primitive’ or that we can
exert no conscious influence on it.”4

And further it is stated that the ANS regulates the internal
environment in concert with neurons in the Central Nervous
System (hereafter abbreviated as CNS) that senses the external

“Heart” in Bahá’í Writings and Neurocardiology                133

environment. This paper further describes the function of the
sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous system in detail and
reveals its close connection and interaction with the heart.
The paper concludes in stating:

> An understanding of the complex anatomy and
> function of the heart’s nervous system contributes an
> additional dimension to the newly emerging view of the
> heart as a sophisticated information processing center,
> functioning not only in concert with the brain but also
> independent of it. Further exploration of the part that
> neurocardiological interactions play in sustaining
> healthy functioning may permit a more comprehensive
> understanding of the heart’s multidimensional role in
> facilitating successful adaptation to the challenges of
> daily living. 5
These findings directly support ‘Abdu’l-Bahá statement
about the function of the heart in the maintenance of health,
when He states that “Physical and spiritual diseases will then
receive absolute healing.”

From the above findings of the recent research from the
Institute of HeartMath it can be concluded that the
importance of the heart and the sympathetic nervous system
for one’s health proves ‘Abdu’l-Bahá rather brief statement in
the initial quote above.

What about the other statement, indicating that the
sympathetic nervous system is between the physical and
spiritual and is connected to both? Can this statement be
proven by modern research as well?

The Appreciative Heart

The HeartMath Institute published a paper in 2003 with the
title “The Appreciative Heart” and it carries the subtitle: “The
Psychophysiology of Positive Emotions and Optimal
Functioning”6. Some of the findings of this paper bring us
closer to the above quoted statement of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá about the
connection of the physical and the spiritual and of the in-
between of these two areas.

In the abstract of this paper the authors explain that they
“review research that has identified new physiological correlates

Lights of ‘Irfán Book Ten                                     134

associated with the experience of heartfelt positive emotions
with a specific focus on appreciation.” The question of
positive versus negative emotions and how these concepts can
relate to the nervous system is intriguing, to say the least.

Until recently, medicine and physiological research would
not have admitted the distinction between positive and
negative emotions, and both sciences would have discarded any
value statements in relation to the understanding of the
nervous system. Some emotions like fear, which leads to the
flight or fight response, have been studied extensively, but they
were not contrasted with positive emotions, such as love and
acceptance, in these studies.

Even psychology, trying to posture as hard science in
behaviorism, had no use for such value statements. On the
other side, in psychoanalysis, Freud talked about the mental
freedom allowing change to a higher and better level of
functioning after the dissolution of the neurosis in therapy.
This mental freedom, which is guided by the value system of a
person, allows changes towards health to be made, changes that
will result in positive emotions and a better and less troubled
life. In spite of this finding, Freud was unable to integrate this
idea of freedom into his theoretical understanding of the
psyche and strangely enough the term freedom did not find its
way into the subject index of the standard edition of Freud’s
work7.

Physiology was not good or bad or even correlated to good
and bad, to positive and negative emotions; the best one could
defend was the survival value of emotions in a strictly
Darwinian sense. While it might be possible to connect
positive emotions with survival of the fittest, it would
certainly be hard to prove. For example, while many regard the
Crucifixion of Christ as the highest value in the Christian
religion, it certainly does not follow the Darwinian
understanding of the survival of the fittest. On the other hand,
if good and bad have an intrinsic correlation in the
physiological sphere, we are closer to understanding the value
of sacrifice and of positive emotions like acceptance.

Good and bad, positive and negative emotions are moral
concepts, are concepts that fit possibly into the mind, but how
could they have correlates in the brain, or the heart? This
question will remain open for the time being. After this

“Heart” in Bahá’í Writings and Neurocardiology                 135

philosophical excursion let’s follow the research in the quoted
article, where it is stated:

> Recent work in the relatively new field of
> Neurocardiology has firmly established that the heart is
> a sensory organ and a sophisticated information
> encoding and processing center.
> Its circuitry enables it to learn, remember, and make
> functional decisions independent of the cranial brain.8
The findings of this paper are based on the measurements of
heart rate variability (hereafter abbreviated as HRV), which is a
measure of the naturally occurring beat-to-beat changes in
heart rate. When this HRV or heart rhythm was measured it
was found that there is an important link between emotions
and changes in the patters of both efferent and afferent
autonomic activity. The paper concludes in stating:

> In contrast, sustained positive emotions, such as
> appreciation, love, or compassion, are associated with
> highly ordered or coherent patterns in the heart
> rhythms, reflecting greater synchronization between
> the two branches of the ANS, and a shift in autonomic
> balance toward increased parasympathetic activity.
> We have found that during the experience of emotions
> such as anger, frustration, or anxiety, heart rhythms
> become more erratic and disordered, indicating less
> synchronization in the reciprocal action that ensures
> between the parasympathetic and sympathetic branches
> of the autonomic nervous system (ANS). 32
In other words, emotions like love, appreciation and
compassion have a direct influence on the physiological
reaction of the heart, which in turn influences the brain and the
whole body. (See Table 1 below) Research has further shown that
the change between negative and positive emotions can be
produced rather quickly in any person who has learned to use
the biofeedback system of Freeze-Frame, which has been
developed, tested and researched extensively in different
populations by the Institute of HeartMath. These heartfelt
positive emotions, such as love, appreciation, care and
compassion, have long been associated with spiritual
experience. Doc Children and Rolling McCraty, Ph.D. have
explored this connection in the article “Psychophysiological
Correlates of Spiritual Experience, 9 where they conclude:

Lights of ‘Irfán Book Ten                                      136

> We believe that heart rhythm coherence training holds
> promise as a practical and potent approach to
> empower individuals to improve the quality of their
> lives. By enabling the intentional self-generation and
> reinforcement of physiological states that are
> correlated with increased love, care, compassion, inner
> harmony, vitality and flow, in essence this intervention
> helps individuals create an internal environment that is
> conducive to fostering spiritual experience. Some
> might indeed describe the end result as being able to
> live more “from the heart” in alignment with their
> deepest core values, or with greater connection to
> spirit.

Table 1

The different emotional states of the heart are here depicted,
on the left is the Heart Rate Variability described, in the
middle the corresponding frequency of this variability. It is
rather remarkable that in the emotional situation of Love and
Acceptance a coherence frequency of 700 is achieved, while in
all other states the frequency is about 150. On the right side of
the picture the heart’s reaction to extreme negative emotions is
shown, where a critical statement of a marital conflict was
presented to the patient, throwing him into a fit of anger. 21

“Heart” in Bahá’í Writings and Neurocardiology                 137

Table 2

This picture combines a multiple emotional response pattern
of the heart as it is presented by the Heart Rate Variability in
different emotional situations.

This spiritual dimension of positive emotions, and what this
means in terms of religious and spiritual experiences, needs be
followed up elsewhere. What is here called a correlate between
physiological states and emotions was expressed by ‘Abdu’l-
Bahá as the correlation between the material and divine world
and He explains the position of the heart and the ANS as
connecting both worlds10 .

The question remains: how can an intentional change of a
person in a moral category affect the physiology of that
person? Since Descartes and before, this issue has been a thorn
in philosophical and scientific questioning of the relationship
between the soul and the body, the mind and the brain, or
however the split is conceived. The fact that science was
philosophically based on a prevalent materialistic and
reductionistic foundation was the source of this omission,
and this situation can be best described by the term scientism
as a philosophical rather than scientific approach. 11 Certainly a

Lights of ‘Irfán Book Ten                                     138

new understanding of these issues is required to explain the
findings reported.

At this point this issue of philosophy will not be further
pursued. What is important here is the fact that the experience
of the human mind and body has created a new paradigm and a
new therapeutic activity that has been proven to be very helpful
in many areas. McCraty states in this paper:

> During states of psycho-physiological coherence,
> bodily systems function with a high degree of
> synchronization, efficiency, and harmony and the
> body’s natural regenerative processes appear to be
> facilitated. Psychologically, this mode is associated
> with improved cognitive performance, increased
> emotional stability, and enhanced psychosocial
> function and the quality of life. Additionally, many
> people report experiencing a notable reduction in inner
> mental dialogue along with feelings of increased peace,
> self-security, and sustained positive emotions after
> practicing maintaining this mode even for short
> periods such as a few days or weeks.
As reported, these described effects are staggering and they
match what ‘Abdu’l-Bahá stated when He talked about
“physical and spiritual diseases will then receive absolute
healing.” Or, as the researchers say, “the body’s natural
regenerative processes appear to be facilitated.”

The Inner and Outer in Bahá’í Theology

In the Bahá’í writings the inner and outer aspects of reality
and of the human condition are a familiar topic. Many terms
are used to express these opposing characteristics, such as:
physical and spiritual, manifest and hidden, seen and unseen,
immanent and evident, internal and external, inner and outer,
inwardness and outwardness. We find these different
translations for the original concepts in the Arabic and Persian
languages.

In the above quoted passage of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá this
understanding is presumed. Here He uses the concepts of
physical and spiritual, or material and divine world. He states
a surprising fact, namely that the relations between these two
have to be normal for perfect appearance. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá
explains this relationship in the next paragraph again; where He

“Heart” in Bahá’í Writings and Neurocardiology                   139

states that the two worlds have to be well co-related. This fact
will make the hearts become heavenly and the aspirations pure
and divine so that a perfect connection shall take place. This
situation is called a perfect manifestation and results in
healing of physical and spiritual of diseases. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá
clearly states that these two aspects have to be well
coordinated, and He calls this coordination normal.
Everything else seems to be abnormal and the cause of spiritual
and physical abnormalities or diseases.

This fact is expressed in the studies of autonomic function
and balance. Clinical correlates of Autonomic Dysrythmias are
mentioned as being:

> Fatigue                     Migraine
> Depression                  Fibromyalgia
> Irritable Bowel             Panic Disorder
> Nausea                      Dizziness
> Arrhythmia                  Hypertension
> Hypoglycemia                Sleep Disorder
> Anxiety                     Asthma
> Premenstrual Syndrome       Mitral Valve Prolapse 12
The conditions in this veritable list of ailments of modern
life are all related to the disturbance of the autonomic nervous
system and of its disharmony. In the words of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá
these “physical and spiritual diseases” are the consequence of
what He describes as a lack of coordination between the
material and divine world in the “sympathetic nervous system”
of the human person.

The conclusions of this brief description are obvious:
physical and spiritual diseases are caused by an abnormal
relation between the spiritual and physical and by
disorganization of these two aspects of man. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá
further states that this correlation affects the heart and, if it is
co-related normally (according to the norm) it will make the
heart heavenly and grow the heart’s aspirations pure and
divine, making a perfect connection. In a way the argument is
circular; it states that if these two worlds are coordinated well,
then the heart makes a perfect connection between these two
worlds. And as we will see below, this circular relationship is
truly a fact of the relationship between the mind and the heart
of man, as well as between the different aspects of the reality of
the universe.

Here we will consider three texts of Bahá’u’lláh, which are the
key to this question of the inner and outer of the human
person. The first two passages were revealed before the
Announcement of Bahá’u’lláh at the Garden of Ridván (1863).
The third text was written in Adrianople and later in ‘Akká,
where Bahá’u’lláh arrived in 1868.

The first text is from the Seven Valleys, i.e., from the central
valley — the fourth valley — the valley of Unity. 13 After giving
several examples of the relative world of attributes, Bahá’u’lláh
presents the following explanation which He introduced with
the words “that the full meaning be manifest.”

> And thus firstness and lastness, outwardness and
> inwardness are, in the sense referred to, true of thyself,
> that in these four states conferred upon thee thou
> shouldst comprehend the four divine states, and that
> the nightingale of thine heart on all the branches of the
> rose tree of existence, whether visible or concealed,
> should cry out: “He is the first and the last, the Seen
> and the Hidden….” (SVFV 27)
Bahá’u’lláh explains that the human reality, the “truth about
thyself” is expressed in these four states, Inwardness and
Outwardness, First and Last.14 The inwardness and
outwardness can be interpreted with ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s statement
of physical and spiritual aspects of man. In the picture of the
nightingale of the heart and of the branches of the rose tree of
existence, the essential nature of this understanding is
presented in poetic and mystic language.

That these four divine states refer to the comprehension of
the Manifestation is clearly expressed by Bahá’u’lláh in the next
quote from His book of Certitude, where He explains what it
means to comprehend and attain to the Manifestation, which
He calls “holy Luminaries:”

> By attaining, therefore, to the presence of these holy
> Luminaries, the “Presence of God” Himself is attained.
> From their knowledge, the knowledge of God is
> revealed, and from the light of their countenance, the
> splendour of the Face of God is made manifest.
> Through the manifold attributes of these Essences of
> Detachment, Who are both the first and the last, the
> seen and the hidden, it is made evident that He Who is
> the Sun of Truth is “the First and the Last, the Seen,
> and the Hidden.” (KI 141)

The next quote explains the effect of this harmony of the four
states of man,

> O people! Fear God, and disbelieve not in Him Whose
> grace hath surrounded all things, Whose mercy hath
> pervaded the contingent world, and the sovereign
> potency of Whose Cause hath encompassed both your
> inner and your outer beings, both your beginning and
> your end. Stand ye in awe of the Lord, and be of them
> that act uprightly. Beware lest ye be accounted among
> those who allow the verses of their Lord to pass them by
> unheard and unrecognized; these, truly, are of the
> wayward . (SLH 40)
Bahá’u’lláh speaks of the Divine potency of His Cause, which
encompasses our inner and outer being, our beginning and
end. To stand in the mercy of the Lord, to act uprightly is
required; otherwise one truly is counted among the wayward.
In other words, the acting uprightly, the leading a life of
compassion, care, love and acceptance is the requirement to be
able to accept the message of Him Whose grace surrounds all
things. Living uprightly and experiencing the inner balance of
the physical and spiritual is a precondition to achieve the unity
of the inner world in the harmony of the heart and the unity of
the outer world, expressed in ‘Abdu’l-Bahá formulation about
“the heart of all that is.”

Consequences of Bahá’u’lláh’s Revelation

These passages of the Writings of Bahá’u’lláh give us a
gleaning of what ‘Abdu’l-Bahá stated in the short passage about
the sympathetic nervous system. The more the science of
medicine explores the human condition the more the words of
the Bahá’í Writings become obvious and understood. What has
been given us in spiritual language can now be found in
scientific research. And this is not by accident. Bahá’u’lláh
explained:

> Every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God is
> endowed with such potency as can instill new life into
> every human frame, if ye be of them that comprehend
> this truth. All the wondrous works ye behold in this
> world have been manifested through the operation of
> His supreme and most exalted Will, His wondrous and
> inflexible Purpose. …

> All the wondrous achievements ye now witness are the
> direct consequences of the Revelation of this Name. In
> the days to come, ye will, verily, behold things of which
> ye have never heard before. (GWB 14)
What is here described about the effect, which the
Revelation of Bahá’u’lláh has on the development of the world,
can equally be applied to the “inwardness” and “outwardness”
of man and the unity of all four states of man as expressed in
the human heart. Following the above quoted statement of
Bahá’u’lláh we can say that the energies released by this
Revelation have a century later resulted in the discovery of
what ‘Abdu’l-Bahá has already briefly stated.

The sympathetic nervous system is between the spiritual and
physical aspect of man and the harmony and coherence of this
system is a cure for all disharmonies in life, which is expressed
in the pathologies of the dysrythmias of the human organism.
With gratitude and in a spirit of appreciation we can study
and use what human research has made available for the healing
of humanity as ordered by the Divine Physician, Bahá’u’lláh.

Returning to the twofold meaning of the concept “heart”,
what was called the physical or medical heart and the
metaphorical concept of the spiritual heart, the following
conclusions can be made from the findings described in this
paper. One is specific; the other conclusion is more general.

Specifically, the finding of neurocardiology have
demonstrated that the heart is much more than a physical or
medical blood pump, so any metaphorical use of this term can
draw on a whole host of abilities and functions of this physical
body organ, called the heart. Consequently, the concept “heart”
as used in the Bahá’í Writings becomes not only more
transparent and meaningful, it furthermore directs the
meaning and understanding of this word towards the
underlying unity and oneness of the world, indicating that
matter and spirit are fundamentally one and not to be seen in
opposition or mutual exclusion.

In general, even the physical heart participates in the newly
developed understanding of the world. The cosmos, which
modern physics and cosmology describes, is not at all a
mechanical machine, totally regulated by cause and effect, but
it is an emerging, enchanted, entangled and excellent world,
where spirit and matter must be seen in their unity, where the

parts constitute the whole, and the whole equally constitute the
parts in mutual dependence and support.

The new view of the cosmos and of the heart brings together
what the Bahá’í Writings describe, when they talk so frequently
and eloquently about the heart. The Heart is described not only
as constituting the unity of the individual human person, not
only as the place where man is in contact with God and His
revelation, but the word heart is used as well in a cosmological
sense, describing the unity of the universe in phrases like “the
heart of all that is” and the “heart of the world.” The spiritual
unity of this world will be described in the following chapter
and what the meaning of this unity is in human experience.

The Human Spirit and the Spirit of Faith

The following question has to be raised at this point, how
can the results of a physiological exercise be related to the
spirituality that is expressed by the Bahá’í Faith? Is using the
Freeze-Frame technique the same as praying, or as believing in
the Revelation of Bahá’u’lláh? Certainly not! We must ask what
the difference is and in what way can a physiological exercise
have value in the expression of religious faith? We must
distinguish between the human spirit and the spirit of faith as
‘Abdu’l-Bahá explains:

> The human spirit, which distinguishes man from the
> animal, is the rational soul, and these two names — the
> human spirit and the rational soul — designate one
> thing. This spirit, which in the terminology of the
> philosophers is the rational soul, embraces all beings,
> and as far as human ability permits discovers the
> realities of things and becomes cognizant of their
> peculiarities and effects, and of the qualities and
> properties of beings. But the human spirit, unless
> assisted by the spirit of faith, does not become
> acquainted with the divine secrets and the heavenly
> realities. It is like a mirror, which, although clear,
> polished and brilliant, is still in need of light. Until a
> ray of the sun reflects upon it, it cannot discover the
> heavenly secrets. (SAQ 208)
Clearly, the human spirit or the rational soul can become
cognizant of the qualities and properties of beings. Applied to
this situation, the human spirit can detect the importance of

the heart and the variance of the heartbeat, can develop the
science of neurocardiology and can develop a technique to
improve the harmony and health of the human body and spirit.
‘Abdu’l-Bahá summarizes this activity as clearing and polishing
the mirror of the human mind.

He does not underestimate this task; He only puts it in the
right perspective. Only when the human mind is polished and
clear, only if people practice positive emotions and action in
their lives, can the light of the divine Revelation reach the
human soul.

Bahá’u’lláh expresses this in frequent statements, for
example, when He says in the Arabic Hidden Words:

> O SON OF SPIRIT!
> My first counsel is this: Possess a pure, kindly and
> radiant heart, that thine may be a sovereignty ancient,
> imperishable and everlasting. (HW Ar1)
and again in the Persian Hidden Words:

> O MY BROTHER!
> Hearken to the delightsome words of My honeyed
> tongue, and quaff the stream of mystic holiness from
> My sugar-shedding lips. Sow the seeds of My divine
> wisdom in the pure soil of thy heart, and water them
> with the water of certitude, that the hyacinths of My
> knowledge and wisdom may spring up fresh and green
> in the sacred city of thy heart. (HW Pr33)
Here again the heart is the center of the meeting of the divine
and the human, of the revelation and the wisdom presented to
man. And again, the heart has to be pure, has to be prepared to
receive the seeds of the divine wisdom of the Manifestation.

Any means that can assist in this process of preparing the
heart is helpful. Any technique that brings the heart in harmony
with the body and with the world around a person; any process
that can stop the disharmony and dysrythmias that are the
hallmark of modern spiritual and physical pathology, must be
used to prepare a pure, kindly and radiant heart.

Nevertheless, as ‘Abdu’l-Bahá clearly states, this is only the
pre-condition, only the preparation of the heart, the human
mirror of the rational soul, which makes it ready to receive the

spirit of faith, the spirit of the Manifestation of God. It is not
accidental that feelings of love, appreciation, care and
compassion are the hallmark of this process—they are the
cleansing of the heart. These feelings purify the heart and make
it kind to one’s fellow man. When our hearts are in sync with
our bodies, with humanity and the world, we can, as ‘Abdu’l-
Bahá has stated in His prayer, “hear the hidden truths that are
written and embedded in the heart of all that is.” “The heart of
all that is” is the same as the city of the heart, the acceptance of
the Manifestation, functioning as the Divine Physician who
has come to cure a sick humanity.

Conclusion

We will conclude with a word of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, in which the
whole of this paper is summarized:

> Man has two powers, and his development two aspects.
> One power is connected with the material world and by
> it he is capable of material advancement. The other
> power is spiritual and through its development his
> inner, potential nature is awakened. These powers are
> like two wings. Both must be developed, for flight is
> impossible with one wing. Praise be to God! Material
> advancement has been evident in the world but there is
> need of spiritual advancement in like proportion. We
> must strive unceasingly and without rest to accomplish
> the development of the spiritual nature in man, and
> endeavor with tireless energy to advance humanity
> toward the nobility of its true and intended station.
> For the body of man is accidental; it is of no
> importance. The time of its disintegration will
> inevitably come. But the spirit of man is essential and
> therefore eternal. It is a divine bounty. It is the
> effulgence of the Sun of Reality and therefore of
> greater importance than the physical body. (BWF 262)
We need to use both wings, the one provided by science and
human progress and the other provided by Revelation,
following the spiritual aspect of man, leading to the “Sun of
Reality.” The harmony does not originate from a biofeedback
technique, but in reverse. The biofeedback technique works
because of this inherent harmony, which is “true of thyself,”
which is given to us, so we can recognize the Divine States.
Love and Care, Acceptance and Compassion are not only tools

to promote harmony through the biofeedback technique as has
been discovered by modern science. Obviously, the system
works even without any recognition of higher truth.
Nevertheless, it will only bring fruit if the inner capacity to
recognize true spirituality by the user of this technique is
activated.

What ‘Abdu’l-Bahá asserts so convincingly, is the need to
develop the spiritual nature of humanity in order to take
advantage of modern scientific findings, such as the
HeartMath procedure. On the other hand, it can be hoped that
the increased focus on positive emotion, given in this
scientific biofeedback technique, will awaken the spiritual
potential in people and direct them away from negative
emotions to positive ones.

This emotional shift increases spirituality in general and
hopefully will lead to the expression of spirituality in moral
action and religious affiliation as well. The mutual
complementation of the two wings is the most effective way to
improve the fate of humankind, and the need to develop both
aspects in harmony is a major focus of the Bahá’í Faith. This
Faith is the first religion in the history of humanity that
combines these two aspects of the human capacity. All
previous major religions have mainly focused on the spiritual
and moral capacities. Science did not exists then and human
scientific and material progress was unknown in their times,
compared with what we have experienced since the Advent of
the Báb.

The Bahá’í faith is the religion for our time, primarily
because this faith responds to the material development of
humanity, giving it a new meaning in the spiritual dimension.
Today this spiritual dimension is in the process of being
discovered, even by the material progress of science. In the
presented practice and research of HeartMath, the value of
positive emotions for physical health and inner peace and
harmony has been demonstrated. The connection is based on
the sympathetic nervous system and the heart, as ‘Abdu’l-Bahá
noted, and pondering upon this issue results in recognizing the
value and prophetic power of these statements of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá.

Humanity is at the beginning of this development and its
future should be seen in this improved harmony of scientific
and religious progress. According to the Bahá’í Faith the

Manifestation of God brings this Progressive Revelation to the
world.

The Divine Physician, who has been sent to cure the problems
of mankind, is the initiator, the originator, and the sustainer
of this creative process. The universality of this new message,
the catholicity of this new religion, and the spirituality of the
human reality, as promoted by this Faith of Divine origin —
and nothing else — is the future of humanity.

The combination of science and religion, of human research
and divine revelation will allow “the nightingale of thine heart,”
the human soul, to wing its way into the unity of mankind, “on
all the branches of the rose tree of existence.” (SVFV 27) This
unity of man, of humankind, of all of their personal and
scientific abilities, as well as all of their social and cultural
achievements, is the promise made to all of humanity by the
Manifestation of God, by Bahá’u’lláh. He is the return of
Christ and one with all previous Prophets.

This unity is nothing else than the promise of the coming of
the Kingdom of God on earth as predicted in the Lord’s Prayer
for the world’s future. And this future is starting now in the
Bahá’í Faith and in all men of good will.
