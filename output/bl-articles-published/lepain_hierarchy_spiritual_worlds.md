> **Abstract:** This paper analyses some of the terminology that Bahaullah uses in one of his earliest tablets, the Tablet of All Food (Lawh-i Kullu't-Ta'ám), which is addressed to a Babi, Haji Mírzá Kamálud-Dín Naráqí, who visited Bahá'u'lláh in Baghdad. In particular the hierarchy of the spiritual worlds is examined under the headings of the four terms that Bahá'u'lláh uses to describe this hierarchy: Háhút, Láhút, Jabarút and Malakút. This paper is based on the first chapter of the book _Archéologie du Royaume de Dieu: Ontologie des mondes divins dans les écrits de Baha’u’llah_ (Paris: La Librairie Baha’ie, 1990).

The fundamental question that is raised here, as a point of exegesis, is
> the divinely ordained capacity of prophets to change social aspects of the
> divine law (shar ı̄‘a) after it has been revealed. Baha’u’llah will address this
> question again in the Book of Certitude (Kitāb-i Īqān) in a more detailed
> and didactic manner. The explanation that he gives in the Tablet of All Food
> deals more with the mystical aspects of the question.

> The hierarchy of the spiritual worlds
> The Tablet of All Food is written in Arabic and begins with a long prologue
> of great poetical character woven in a chain of metaphors. An impression
> of grandeur and of majesty is emitted throughout the whole treatise, cap-
> tivating the reader through luminous expressions which Baha’u’llah puts
> into motion as oceans of light and of fire upon which the billowing waves
> break over one another before our eyes.8 He describes the inundation of an
> enflamed gushing ocean from the ‘Temple of saintliness’, a temple which
> constitutes in all likelihood an allusion to his own person.9 Then, changing
> register, he announces that the ‘Dove of light’, symbol of divine inspiration,
> has newly begun singing the eternal melodies, that a ‘Light’ shines upon
> Mount Sinai, and that the ‘Bird of light’ has come out from behind the veils
which concealed it from the view of men.10

After this long preamble, Baha’u’llah begins his commentary by explain-
> ing that the word ‘food’ has numerous meanings and these meanings can
> only be understood through the hierarchy of the four spiritual worlds. These
> four worlds are the worlds of Hāhūt, Lāhūt, Jabarūt and Malakūt.11 In other
> writings the name of Nāsūt appears as part of the hierarchy. It is the world
> of human beings (nās). It is not the physical world, but rather a psychologi-
cal world in which we must fight our spiritual battles.

This terminology has a long history. Most of these words have an Aramaic
> origin. The concept of Malakut emerges in the Aramean tradition between the
> 2nd century BCE and the 6th century CE as a term depicting God’s sovereignty
> and is often associated with Gebrūt as an attribute of divine power. Malkūt is
> probably the word that Jesus used to name ‘the Kingdom of God’. In a later
> tradition, Malkūt will become one of the ten sefirot of the Kabala. The word
> Malakut appears three times in the Qur’an, but not the other names, which
> have been borrowed from the Jewish and Christian tradition through other
> sources. Originally the word was not associated with any angelic reference

> know Him. It is to this station of Hahut that the following words of the
> prophets apply: ‘“In the beginning was God; there was no creature to know
> Him” and “The Lord was alone; with no one to adore Him”.’13 The world of
> Hahut is a world outside of time and before any causation. In that world
> there is no first cause or cause of causes in contrast with the world of time
> where God has always been a creator and where there was always a creature
> to know Him. This is why he indicates that these words signify ‘that the
> habitation wherein the Divine Being dwelleth is far above the reach and ken
of any one besides Him’.14

Baha’u’llah describes this world as the world of ‘He is’ (Huwa), and
> ‘the Paradise of the Absolute Unicity’ (Ah.adiyya).15 It is the Absconditum
> where no intelligence has ever penetrated. One refers to this world as to
> that of the ‘Hidden Mystery’ or the ‘Primal Point’, for the primal point (al-
> nuqt. a al-awwaliyya) is the first singularity from which all has proceeded
> and that encompasses in itself all the potentialities of existence. It is the
> One who contains nothing but himself and from whom all the numbers
> have been engendered. God, in that world, is an unmanifested essence, for
> the essence manifests itself by attributes, but they are not yet distinct from
> the essence. The ancient philosophers made reference to this world as the
world of the ‘One’.

This passage of the tablet can be related to a commentary that ‘Abdu’l-
Baha wrote in 1861, seven years later when he was only 17 years old, on

of the human mind when dealing with such questions. The only thing that                 21. Bahā’u’llāh, Prayers

> can be affirmed with certitude about this station is that the divine essence                (Wilmette, IL: Bahā’ı̄

> value to the letter), without being able to find in the point any trace of their
> ipseity (huwiyyat), and also without being able to establish the least distinc-
tion between them.17

Hence, when we consider the divine essence on the ontological level of
> Hahut, we can see that the names, the attributes and the essential poten-
> tialities (shu’ūnāt-i dhātiyyih)18 are in a state of non-existence. It is for this
> very reason that we refer to that essence as a ‘Hidden Treasure’. For even
> though, on this ontological level, nothing is manifested, nevertheless it is
> from the non-manifested potentialities of this essence that the existence
> of all things is derived. ‘Abdu’l-Baha then uses another image that is also
> a common feature of this metaphysic of Being, the image of the number
> One (Ah.ad), which contains in itself all the numbers. Without the concept
> of the number One, other numbers could not exist. Therefore it is possi-
> ble to consider that the number One is responsible for engendering all the
> other numbers and that all the numbers are contained in the One with-
> out, of course, finding in the One the least trace of these numbers.19 In
> this manner, the character of absolute transcendence of the divine essence
> is preserved. Baha’u’llah says, speaking of this station: ‘The door of the
> knowledge of the Ancient Being hath ever been, and will continue for ever
to be, closed in the face of men.’20

Finally, the Hidden Treasure retains its mystery, for, contrary to what the
> majority of the thinkers and philosophers of the past have said, Baha’u’llah
> and ‘Abdu’l-Baha do not identify the Primal Point or the One with the
> divine essence. For them, such expressions should be considered at best as
> images (tamthı̄l) or mental representations (tas. awwurāt) used only to facili-
> tate our comprehension. In one of his tablets, Baha’u’llah affirms that it is
> false to speak of God as One for that introduces already a sign of quantity,
> and God is above all numbers and all quantity.21 It is a clear repudiation of

> The world of Lāhūt
> In the world of Lāhūt, the attributes of God begin their unfoldment. The
> potentialities contained in the divine essence manifest themselves, but
> only within the boundaries of the divine essence. A distinction between
> the essence and the attributes can finally be made. Baha’u’llah describes
> this level of existence of the divine Manifestations as ‘the station of pure
> abstraction and essential unity’.22 At this level of existence, it is impossible
> to make any distinction between God and the divine Manifestations. The
> Manifestations exist only in total union with the essence of God. They have
> no individuality, no separate identity. They do not possess any other self
> but the divine self; this is the reason this world is called the kingdom of ‘He
> is He Who is and there is no other but Him’ (Huwa huwa wa lā ilā huwa).23
> This world is the world of the first divine emanation (tajallı̄), that is to say
> the Holy Spirit or the divine Word. The Word is the spiritual force God
> uses to create the world. The philosophers have named this spiritual force
‘Logos’ or ‘Nous’.

Baha’u’llah, in many passages of his writings, refers to the world of
> the divine Word as the invisible force that animates his manifestation and
> the inspiration that moves his pen. Sometimes he speaks of it as a totally
> divine world, external to himself, where the essence of God manifests itself
> as ‘the Lord of Lords’. Sometimes he describes the Word as manifesting
> itself through his own person and incarnating in him. This indicates two
> points of view, both of which are relative and neither of which is exclusive.
> In his writings Baha’u’llah frequently distinguishes these two ontological
> viewpoints. The western reader would be mistaken in believing that they
> are pure artifices of poetry. When, for example, Baha’u’llah refers to him-
> self as ‘the Tongue of Grandeur’, or ‘the Most Exalted Pen’, he does not
> use simple poetic metaphors. Rather, such expressions introduce different
> ontological and metaphysical distinctions between him as a person and the
> Word for which he is the mouthpiece. Once he spoke from Lahut and at
> another time he spoke from the Jabarut. These ontological stations change
> the perspective he gives on reality and these expressions become precious
> indications that allow the spiritual and metaphysical meaning of such pas-
sages to unfold.

As already stated, there is no possibility of making any distinc-
> tion between God and His Manifestation in the world of Lahut. The
> Manifestation appears in the absolute nakedness of his own essence and
> in union with the divine essence. There is no trace of his individual self,
> and any other vestige of his personal identity has vanished. For this very
> reason, this station is called ‘the Universal Manifestation’ (Maz. har-i kullı̄).

Only the divine Manifestation has access to the world of Lahut. The
> divine dove and the mystical nightingale are other personifications of the
> world of Lahut. It is from this world that divine inspiration descended
> upon Jesus in the form of a dove on the day of his baptism and the angel
> Gabriel who appeared to Muhammad is another personification of that
> world. In the writings of Baha’u’llah, the prophetic inspiration is some-
> times symbolized by a dove or a nightingale, sometimes by a virginal and
> angelic creature which is called a H.ūrı̄. Like the dove on the day of Jesus’
> baptism, this celestial Huri appeared to Baha’u’llah in the Siyāh-Chāl at
> the moment in which he received the first intimation of his prophetic mis-
> sion. It is important to note that the Huri does not represent an actual
> vision. Rather it should be taken as an image depicting in symbolic terms
> the mystical experience of the prophetic inspiration that results from total
> union with God.

> The world of Jabarūt
> Below the world of Lahut comes the world of Jabarūt, a world in which noth-
> ing exists but the divine will (Jabr). In this world one finds only God and
> His Manifestations. At this level of existence divine Manifestations leave
> the level of the fused union of essences, which is particular to Lahut, and
> acquire individual existences. Baha’u’llah describes this level of existence of
> the divine Manifestations as ‘the station of distinction’ which pertains ‘to
> the world of creation and limitation thereof’ and which is characterized by
> ‘differentiation, temporal limitation, characteristics and standards’.27 In this
> world, the Manifestations become the channels of the divine will. They are
> the archangels of which the Mosaic tradition speaks. To them is applied the
> formula ‘Thou (the Manifestation) art He (God) and He (God) is thee (the
Manifestation)’.28

Baha’u’llah refers to this world using various expressions such as ‘the
> Kingdom of unity’ (Wāh.idiyya), ‘the most exalted Paradise’, ‘the Paradise

The world of Malakut has great importance for humans because it is

> companions of Baha’u’llah. In the chapter consecrated to Mullā ‘Alı̄ -Akbar,
> who was named by Baha’u’llah a ‘Hand of the Cause of God’, and who
> played a very significant role in the propagation of the Baha’i teachings,
> ‘Abdu’l-Baha describes a dream that he had some years after the death of
> this individual:

> One night, not long ago, I saw him in the world of dreams. Although his frame
> had always been massive, in the dream world he appeared larger and more
> corpulent than ever. It seemed as if he had returned from a journey. I said to
> him, ‘Jināb, you have grown good and stout.’ ‘Yes,’ he answered, ‘praise be to
> God! I have been in places where the air was fresh and sweet, and the water
> crystal pure; the landscapes were beautiful to look upon, the foods delectable.
> It all agreed with me, of course, so I am stronger than ever now, and I have
> recovered the zest of my early youth. The breaths of the All-Merciful blew over
> me and all my time was spent in telling of God. I have been setting forth His
> proofs, and teaching His Faith.40

> ‘Abdu’l-Baha added this particularly significant commentary: ‘The meaning
> of teaching the Faith in the next world is spreading the sweet savours of
holiness; that action is the same as teaching.’41

This short text teaches us two things. The first is that the most impor-
> tant actions of our terrestrial life such as loving one’s fellows, propagating
> the divine teachings, giving and receiving unselfishly, all have a counterpart
> in Malakut and should be regarded as the symbolic expressions of the life
> of the soul in the divine Kingdom. The second is that as long as human
> beings inhabit this physical world, they can neither comprehend nor directly
> express the realities of the spiritual world. As long as they are prisoners
> of this world, their intelligence cannot understand these realities and no
> human language can describe them. All it can do, at the very best, is to
> have a vague intuition of their reality. Poetic language is the only way to
> mediate this communicational impossibility, and recourse to metaphors
> based upon this sensible world is therefore inevitable.

> Baha’u’llah explains that all the divine worlds revolve around this world.
> He says that for this reason, the soul, which in this world has always
> behaved according to the Will of God and according to His commands,
> after its departure for the other world, will demonstrate qualities that in
> this world existed only as potentialities. He adds that in each world there
> exists for every soul a state that was previously assigned to it. ‘Abdu’l-
> Baha writes in one of his tablets:

> Those souls who are pure and unsullied, upon the dissolution of their ele-
> mental frames, hasten away to the world of God, and that world is within this
> world. The people of this world, however, are unaware of that world, and are
> even as the mineral and the vegetable that knows nothing of the world of the

> It is this differentiation and interdependence between the two worlds that

> Since the most remote antiquity, it has been understood that a funda-
> mental similitude exists between ‘the world above’ and ‘the world below’.
> But each religion, each tradition, has given its own interpretation of this
> similitude often based on philosophy and metaphysical speculation.
> The Baha’i writings suggest that meditating upon the physical realities
> of this world can be a means of understanding the spiritual realities of
> the other world, providing that in doing so we do not lose sight of what
> has been outwardly conveyed to us through divine Revelation, and that
> we allow ourselves to be guided by this divine Revelation. If the world

> Because the spiritual worlds are beyond the power of words, only the use
> of metaphors can allow us to approach them, and when we start reading
Baha’i writings we soon find that there are a number of recurrent themes.

One of these recurrent themes is the similitude that exists between the
> embryo in the womb of its mother and this terrestrial life. We will look in
> detail at this theme because it is a good demonstration of how the Baha’i
> writings base their description of the physical world on inferences devel-
> oped from metaphors. This approach is based on two principles: the
> physical world is a metaphorical image of the spiritual world (and not the
> reverse) and nature is an expression of the Will of God, therefore continuity
> exists between physical and spiritual laws. The law of progress is universal.
Spiritual evolution is simply the continuation of biological evolution.

This theme begins with the recognition that the embryo in the womb of
> the mother has no knowledge of an external world. It is not even conscious
> of its mother’s existence and has no understanding of its environment. In
> the same way, human beings in this world, if they rely solely on their physi-
> cal senses, might be led to believe that the physical world is the only world
> that exists, although, ‘Abdu’l-Baha says, the distance that separates this
> world from the spiritual world is even thinner than the uterine membrane.
> The spiritual world completely surrounds the physical world. In the same
> way the matrix is narrow and dark, this physical world will appear narrow
and dark to those who leave it.

Another idea that comes from this metaphor is that the uterine world
> and the external world are governed by the same laws, even though these
> laws manifest in different ways. Likewise, the material world and the spir-
> itual world are also governed by the same laws, even if they appear differ-
> ent, for these two worlds form only one reality. The physical world is only
> a small region of a larger world that is the ‘World of Creation’ (‘ālam al-
khalq), just as the uterus is part of the physical world.

The comparison that can be made between the uterine world and the
> physical world does not end here, as the development of the soul can be
> compared to the development of the embryo. From the moment the ovum
> is fertilized, we know that gestation will not exceed nine months. Uterine life
> has a term just as physical life has a term. At the end of the nine months,
> the embryo reaches maturity, which means that in order to continue its
> development it must leave the mother’s womb and pass into the extra-
> uterine world. Staying indefinitely in this physical world would not lead to
> more spiritual progress. When the fruit is ripe it must fall from the tree
> and release its seed, otherwise it will wither on the branch and completely
> fail to fulfil its purpose. When the infant is born before term, she might
> pass through a critical phase during which her life is in the balance and she
> needs special care. However, she is likely to recuperate and later continue

51. ibid 1:338.                 as the embryo. The purpose of physical life is to develop spiritual qualities.

> Humans might wonder why they need spiritual qualities since some people
> seem to live a comfortable and happy life without aiming for high spiritual
> attainments. But the Baha’i writings teach that spiritual qualities are, in the
> next world, like legs, arms and eyes in this world. Humans enjoy life because
> they have an adapted physical body and senses to perceive the world. Living
> without the capacity of walking or seeing is a serious handicap. Similarly, fail-
> ing to develop their spiritual qualities in this world will result in us entering the
> next world with spiritual handicaps because spiritual qualities are the means
> by which we will interact with the spiritual world. ‘Abdu’l-Baha developed this
> theme in many of his tablets and talks.48 In one tablet in Persian49 he explains
> that as long as the embryo is in the womb of its mother its physical defects
> and imperfections are hidden, for defects and imperfections do not become
> manifest until after birth. So also, to a large degree, human spiritual defects
> and imperfections are not apparent in this world, but when humans enter the
next world then these in their turn become evident and manifest.50

Infinite variations on such a theme are possible. However, one should
> not believe that this is a simple metaphor. Such metaphors are powerful
> because they express a deep reality: the lower world is an image of the
> higher world. Metaphors are necessary because reality is structured in a
> metaphoric manner. They express the deep relationship that exists between
things throughout all of God’s creation.

In the same tablet cited above, ‘Abdu’l-Baha declares that human life
> can be compared to a tree and that the metaphorical heaven and hell of the
> tree are contained in the fruit.51 The tree is responsible for the fruit it pro-
duces. Paradise and hell are in us. They are spiritual states.

‘Abdu’l-Baha adds that those who negate the existence of the spiritual
worlds are in the same position as the mineral that negates the existence

> world is built upon the human world (‘ālam-i insānı̄ or Nasut). Each of the
> superior worlds encompasses the inferior worlds and all are interdependent
just as reflected in the different kingdoms of nature.

While the nature of the tree is to plunge its roots in the soil to take from
> the earth its sustenance, if a tree chose to bury its branches in the soil, it
> would condemn itself to wither away and to rot. Its very nature pushes it
> to lift up its branches towards the sky in the opposite direction to the earth

> nevertheless, they cannot attain this development without detaching them-
> selves from the things of this world. For that reason, without detachment
> there is no spiritual development possible. The essential nature of human
> beings is spiritual and it attracts them to the spiritual world even as the
branches of the tree are attracted to the sky.

If the tree directs its branches to the sky, it is because it is attracted by

> ‘Sun’ of the divine Manifestation and it is this spiritual light that condi-

the light of the sun, even those that do not directly receive this light. There
> even exist parasitic plants like tropical creepers, ivy or mistletoe, which not-
> withstanding their own feebleness make use of other trees to attain this
> light. Human life is formed in a similar fashion. There are individuals who
> live directly in the light of the Manifestation and those who never see that

> is the cause of their existence and of their spiritual development. This is
> why the path of spiritual development is never totally blocked, even to those
who do not recognize God and His Manifestation.

Because all God’s creatures are dependent on the light of ‘the Sun of
> Reality’, the world of existence can only be one. The differences that we see
> between Hahut, Lahut, Jabarut, Malakut and Nasut are purely conceptual.
> However, the same divine light is infused through all these worlds. Everything
> created exists only by the breath of the Holy Spirit. Nothing would exist with-
out this light, which is the cause of the existence of all things.

One could elaborate infinitely upon this theme of the similarities
> between the laws of the physical world and those of the spiritual world.
> There are many examples of this theme found in the writings of Baha’u’llah
> and ‘Abdu’l-Baha; for example, ‘Abdu’l-Baha says that universal gravity is
> an example of the law of love which is the fundamental law governing all of
creation and indeed all the divine worlds?

These few reflections allow us to see that the metaphorical character
> of the physical world in relation to the spiritual world is not like a simple
> play of mirrors. This metaphorical relation is the expression of something
> much more profound which derives from the unity of the creation of God;
> unity which encompasses as much the physical world as the spiritual, the
> sensible as the intelligible.

> The infinite continuum of the divine worlds
> All that we have said about the different divine worlds obviously implies
> that, when Baha’u’llah refers to these worlds, his explanation is necessar-
> ily limited by human language and by our comprehension. It is but a faint
> glimmer and without doubt very distant from reality. The divine worlds form
> an infinite continuum. Any attempt to establish distinctions between them
is but a creation of the human mind based upon arbitrary criteria.

Nevertheless, the definitions that Baha’u’llah gives of the divine worlds
> provides a precious key that unlocks and therefore allows us to comprehend
> his writings. It often happens that when reading his writings one may ask,
> who is this person speaking? Is it God? Is it a personification of the Holy
> Spirit? Is it the universal Manifestation or is it Baha’u’llah? In the same
> text Baha’u’llah often use several levels of language, sometimes creating
> dialogues between these levels. Once he speaks as a mere man, and once
> as Divinity personified. Sometimes he introduces distinct entities such as
> the nightingale, the dove, the celestial pen and so forth. At other times, his
> writings represent a dialogue between various voices, as in the Fire Tablet.
> These different levels of language represent the different aspects of the
> divine Manifestation as viewed from the perspective of the worlds of Lahut,
Jabarut, Malakut and Nasut.

This hierarchy of the spiritual worlds does not derive its meaning from
a creationist theology as can be found in Muslim philosophy or among

BSR_16_Lepain_art_043-060.indd 58                                                                                  3/27/10 2:06:30 PM

> The Kingdom as a structure of intelligibility
> This paper is intended to demonstrate that what appears at first sight
> as a purely metaphysical question is better addressed from a herme-

> inventory of all spiritual meanings of the word ‘food’ and, on the other
> hand, we have a question that initially appears to be purely ontological,

> sis is mistaken and is the source of all the errors that have been made in
> the study of the ‘metaphysics’ of Baha’u’llah. I put the word ‘metaphys-
> ics’ between quotation marks because just as Baha’u’llah did not want to
> create a cosmology, he never intended to produce a metaphysical system.
> Baha’u’llah has warned us to avoid sciences that ‘begin with words and
> end with words’.55 There is no doubt that he had in mind the scholastic
> system of his time, deeply rooted in metaphysics. It does not mean that
> metaphysical questions should be avoided. Metaphysical questions are
> inescapable. However, metaphysical questions, as such, cannot be solved
> by metaphysics. This is one of the major lessons that ‘Abdu’l-Baha gives in
> Some Answered Questions. Traditionally, metaphysical systems try to iden-
> tify the ultimate principle, such as ‘the One’, ‘the First Cause’, ‘Being’ or
> ‘Existence’, from which all other principles derived. ‘Abdu’l-Baha points
> to the futility of that approach. Instead he proposes a bottom-up approach
> that starts from the observation of the natural world to identify principles
> that can be extended to other realms of human knowledge. We have seen
several examples of that approach in this paper.

The hierarchy of divine worlds, even if its purpose is mainly hermeneuti-

metaphysics, is thus totally displaced. Hence, Baha’i ontology splits into
> two branches. The first is an onto-hermeneutic, which we find exemplified
> in the Tablet of All Food and which defines a ‘world’ as a level of under-
> standing dependent upon the spiritual situs of the seeker. The second is
> an onto-cosmology which defines a ‘world’ as a mode of being, which is
> itself a modality of the spirit upon which depends a structure of intelligibil-
> ity. It is this structure of intelligibility that establishes the unity of ontol-
> ogy and which assures interaction between the onto-hermeneutic and the
> onto-cosmology. The plurality of worlds described in Baha’u’llah’s writings
> exists only in the human mind and is created by our cognitive limitations.
> Ontological categories are, in fact, epistemological or cognitive categories.
> To be in the world of Nasut means to be cognitively limited by the ontologi-
cal situs specific to the human species.

Like every philosophical explanation, this one may appear complicated.

> A superficial reading of Baha’u’llah’s writings might tend to avoid such
> questions that are fundamentally alien to western culture. It is not in our
> cultural habit to have philosophical ideas conveyed by poetical means, often
> without the recourse of philosophical jargon. The effectiveness of this poeti-
> cal language is based on the resonance that images and metaphors can cre-
> ate in our inner being, often shortcutting our discursive mode of thinking.
> However, if such resonances exist it is because these images reverberate in
> the symbolic universe of our collective and personal unconscious and can
be apprehended directly by our intuitive faculties.

We hope that this paper will have convinced the reader that the var-
> ious images that we find in the writings of Baha’u’llah such as the ‘the
> Sun of Reality’, ‘the Tongue of Grandeur’, ‘the Supreme Pen’, ‘the Mystical
> Nightingale’ are not innocent poeticisms resulting from the excess of an
> oriental flowery language. Western readers often have a tendency to dis-
> card such images as obstacles to reach the core meaning of the text. On
> the contrary, these images should be taken as precious guides through the
> intricacies of subtle questions.
