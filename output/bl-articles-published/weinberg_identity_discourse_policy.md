Identity, Discourse, and Policy:
Reconstructing the Public Sphere
MATTHEW WEINBERG

Abstract
It is through interchange that individuals and the communities they compose are
able to define their identities and their long-term goals. In this sense, human life
has a “fundamentally dialogical character.” New models of social transformation
will emerge only from a change in consciousness about who we are, how we
regard others who enter our ambit—no matter how near or distant—and how we
collectively design the structures and processes of social life, whether local or
global. Giving full consideration to the multiple dimensions of human experience
in public discourse can give rise to new social meanings and expand policy dia-
logues beyond narrow conceptual boundaries.

Résumé
C’est par un processus d’interactions que les communautés et les humains qui les
composent sont en mesure de se définir une identité et des objectifs à long terme.
On peut donc dire, en ce sens, que la vie humaine a un « caractère fondamentale-
ment dialogique ». De nouveaux modèles de transformation sociale n’émergeront
qu’à la suite d’un changement de perception concernant, d’une part, qui nous
sommes et comment nous percevons les autres qui—aussi près ou aussi loin de
nous qu’ils soient—entrent dans notre sphère, et, d’autre part, comment nous
établissons collectivement les structures et les processus de la vie en société, au
niveau de la localité, voire de la planète. Si le discours public tenait pleinement
compte des multiples dimensions de l’expérience humaine, il pourrait s’ensuivre
de nouvelles significations sociales et un recadrage des dialogues de politique au-
delà des limitations conceptuelles étroites qui prévalent actuellement.

de transformación social surgirán solo de un cambio en la conciencia acerca de
quiénes somos, cómo consideramos a otros quienes entran en nuestros ámbito—
sin importar cuán cerca o distante—y cómo diseñamos colectivamente las estruc-
turas y procesos de la vida social, sean local o globales. Dándole completa consid-
eración a las múltiples dimensiones de la experiencia humana en el discurso públi-
co puede dar origen a nuevos significados sociales y expandir diálogos de política
más allá de estrechos límites conceptuales.

To effect social change requires transforming “habits of thought,” for in so
many ways our minds are involved in constructing the world we find our-
selves in.1 Our perceptions and the concepts we hold determine the social
reality we see and create. The very patterns of our thought—our suppo-
sitions, frameworks of understanding, and the questions we are moved to
ask or not ask—influence how we interact with and shape this reality.
Thus, our conceptions of who we are as human beings, the interactions
and discourses that inform our thinking, and our experiences in applying
ideas and ideals, all serve to define the parameters of social existence. In
this respect, Bahá’u’lláh provides clear direction as to where our thoughts,
and the actions flowing from these thoughts, should be focused: “Do not
busy yourselves in your own concerns; let your thoughts be fixed upon that
which will rehabilitate the fortunes of mankind and sanctify the hearts and
souls of men” (Gleanings 93). It is this challenging mandate of the Bahá’í
teachings that is examined here, particularly how a spiritual understanding
of human identity and purpose gives rise to social processes and policies
essential for humanity’s collective progress.

As we now look at human society, its characteristics of complexity,
interconnectedness, and immediacy are unprecedented. As the sheer
intensity and velocity of change challenges our assumptions about the
nature and structure of social reality, a set of vital questions confront us.
These include: What is the source of our identity? Where should our
attachments and loyalties lie? If our identity or identities so impel us,
how—and with whom—should we come together? What is the nature of
the bonds that bring us together? And how does such self-understanding
give rise to the formation of individual and societal goals?

Identity, Discourse, and Policy                     75

The organization and direction of human affairs are inextricably con-
nected to the future evolution of our identity. For it is from our identity
that intention, action, and social development flow. Identity determines
how we see ourselves and conceive our position in the world, how others
see us or classify us, and how we choose to engage with those around us.
“Knowing who we are,” the sociologist Philip Selznick observes, “helps us
to appreciate the reach as well as the limits of our attachments” (“Civility
and Piety” 46).2 Such attachments play a central role in shaping our
“authentic selves” and in determining our attitudes toward those within
and outside the circle of our social relationships. Acting on the commit-
ments implied by these attachments serves to amplify the powers of indi-
viduals in effecting societal well-being and advancement. Notions of per-
sonal and collective identity can thus exert considerable influence over the
norms and practices of a rapidly integrating global community.

As we have many associational linkages, identity comes in a variety of
forms. At times we identify ourselves by our family, ethnicity, nationality,
religion, mother tongue, race, gender, class, culture, or profession. At
other times our locale, the enterprises and institutions we work for, our
loyalty to sports teams, affinity for certain types of music and cuisine,
attachment to particular causes, and educational affiliations provide defi-
nitional aspects to who we are. The sources of identification which ani-
mate and ground human beings are immensely diverse. In short, there are
multiple demands of loyalty placed upon us, and consequently, our identi-
ties, as Nobel laureate Amaryta Sen has noted, are “inescapably plural”
(Identity and Violence xiii).

But which identity or identities are most important? Can divergent iden-
tities be reconciled? And do these identities enhance or limit our under-
standing of and engagement with the world? Each of us on a daily basis,
both consciously and unconsciously, draws upon, expresses, and mediates
between our multiple senses of identity. And as our sphere of social inter-
action expands, we tend to subsume portions of how we define ourselves
and seek to integrate into a wider domain of human experience. This often
requires us to scrutinize and even resist particular interpretations of alle-
giance that may have a claim on us. We therefore tend to prioritize which

76            The Journal of Bahá’í Studies 21. 1/4. 2011

identities matter most to us. As the theorist Iris Marion Young stresses:
“Individuals are agents: we constitute our own identities, and each person’s
identity is unique. . . . A person’s identity is not some sum of her gender,
racial, class and national affinities. She is only her identity, which she her-
self has made by the way that she deals with and acts in relation to others.
. . .” (101–2). The matrix of our associations surely influences how we
understand and interpret the world, but cannot fully account for how we
think, act, or what values we hold. That a particular identity represents a
wellspring of meaning to an individual need not diminish the significance
of other attachments or eclipse our moral intuition or use of reason.
Affirming affinity with a specific group as a component of one’s personal
identity should not limit how one views one’s place in society or the possi-
bilities of how one might live.

While it is undoubtedly simplistic to reduce human identity to specific
contextual categories such as nationality or culture, such categories do
provide a strong narrative contribution to an individual’s sense of being.
Social, cultural, and other narratives directly impact who we are. They
provide context and structure for our lives, allowing us to link what we
wish to become to a wider human inheritance, thereby providing a basis
for meaningful collective life. Various narratives of identity serve as vehi-
cles of unity, bringing coherence and direction to the disparate experi-
ences of individuals.

But modernity has transformed identity in such a way that we must
view ourselves as being not only in a condition of dependence or inde-
pendence but also in a condition of interdependence. Our connections to
others now transcend traditional bounds of culture, nation, and communi-
ty. The unprecedented nature of these connections is radically reshaping
human organization and the scale and impact of human exchange.
Globalization, though, has been with us a long time; the movement of peo-
ples, goods, and ideas is an inherent feature of human history and devel-
opment. Virtually every culture is linked to others by a myriad ties.

Clearly, the perceptions that human beings hold of each other matter. In
a world convulsed by contention and conflict, conceptions of identity that
feed the forces of prejudice and mistrust must be closely examined.

Identity, Discourse, and Policy                      77

Assertions that certain populations can be neatly partitioned into opposi-
tional categories of affiliation deserve particular scrutiny.

“A tenable global ethics,” the philosopher Kwame Appiah observes, “has
to temper a respect for difference with a respect for the freedom of actual
human beings to make their own choices” (“Case for Contamination”).
Existing mores, practices, and institutions can inform, validate, and even
ennoble the human condition, but cannot or should not foreclose new
moral or social directions for individuals and communities. Indeed, collec-
tive learning and adjustment are defining characteristics of social evolu-
tion. Because our perceptions and experiences change, our understanding
of reality necessarily undergoes change. So too, then, do our identities
change.

The prevalent stance that identity is solely about difference is untenable.

Perceiving identity through the relativistic lens of separation or cultural
preservation ignores compelling evidence of our common humanity and
can only aggravate the forces of discord now so pervasive in the world.
The only alternative to this path of fragmentation and disunity is to nur-
ture affective relationships across lines of ethnicity, creed, territory, and
color—relationships that can serve as the basis of a new social framework
of universal solidarity and mutual respect. A one-dimensional understand-
ing of human beings must be rejected.

As Amartya Sen underscores, “The hope of harmony in the contempo-
rary world lies to a great extent in a clearer understanding of the plural-
ities of human identity, and in the appreciation that they cut across each
other and work against a sharp separation along one single hardened line
of impenetrable division” (Identity and Violence xiv). The resolution of the
problems now engulfing the planet demands a more expansive sense of
human identity. As articulated by Bahá’u’lláh more than a century ago:
“The earth is but one country, and mankind its citizens” (Gleanings 250).

The crucial need of the present hour is to determine the conceptual and
practical steps that will lay the foundations of an equitable and harmonious
global order. Effectively addressing the crises now disrupting human
affairs will require new models of social transformation that recognize the
deep interrelationship between the material, ethical, and transcendent

78            The Journal of Bahá’í Studies 21. 1/4. 2011

dimensions of life. It is evident that such models can emerge only from a
fundamental change in consciousness about who we are, how we regard
others who enter our ambit—no matter how near or distant—and how we
collectively design the structures and processes of social life, whether local
or global.

From a Bahá’í perspective, a universal identity is a vital precursor to
action that is universal in its effects—to the “emergence of a world com-
munity, the consciousness of world citizenship, the founding of a world
civilization and culture” (Shoghi Effendi, World Order 163). In emphasiz-
ing our global identity, Bahá’u’lláh presents a conception of life that
insists upon a redefinition of all human relationships—between individu-
als, between human society and the natural world, between the individ-
ual and the community, and between individual citizens and their govern-
ing institutions.

In the Bahá’í view, social origin, position, or rank are of no account in
the sight of God. As Bahá’u’lláh avers, “man’s glory lieth in his knowl-
edge, his upright conduct, his praiseworthy character, his wisdom, and not
in his nationality or rank” (Tablets 67).3

The “watchword” of the Bahá’í community is “unity in diversity”
(Shoghi Effendi, World Order 41). More than creating a culture of toler-
ance, the notion of unity in diversity entails vanquishing corrosive divi-
sions along lines of race, class, gender, nationality, and belief, and erecting
a dynamic and cooperative social ethos that reflects the oneness of human
nature. From this vantage point, our multiple senses of identity are not in
tension with our common humanity, but are facets of that common
humanity.

The ideology of difference so ubiquitous in contemporary discourse
militates against the possibility of social progress. It provides no basis
whereby communities defined by specific backgrounds, customs, or creeds
can bridge their divergent perspectives and resolve social tensions. The
value of variety and difference cannot be minimized, but neither can the
necessity for coexistence, order, and mutual effort.

To foster a global identity, to affirm that we are members of one human
family, is a deceptively simple but powerful idea. While traditional loyal-

Identity, Discourse, and Policy                     79

ties and identities must be appreciated, they are inadequate for addressing
the predicament of modernity, and consequently, a higher loyalty, one that
speaks to the common destiny of all the earth’s inhabitants, is necessary.
Self-determination, whether at the personal or group level, must now be
understood as participation in the construction of a broader collectivity.
Participation of this kind by a diverse array of cultures and peoples offers
the promise of enriching the entire fabric of civilized life.

An inherent aspect of such a universal identity is recognition of the
spiritual reality that animates our inner selves. To be sure, a global iden-
tity grounded in awareness of our common humanness marks a great
step forward from where humanity has been, but a strictly secular or
material formulation of global identity is unlikely to provide a sufficient
motivational basis for overcoming historic prejudices and engendering
universal moral action. Establishing a global milieu of peace, prosperity,
and justice is, in the final analysis, a matter of the heart; it involves a
change in basic attitudes and values that can only come from recognizing
the normative and spiritual nature of the challenges before us. This is
especially so given that the vast majority of the world’s peoples do not
view themselves simply as material beings concerned with material needs
and circumstances, but rather as beings endowed with spiritual sensibili-
ty and an innate dignity.

The recognition, then, of our common spiritual nature is what ultimate-
ly informs personal and shared social meaning, and therefore our social
arrangements. It provides the basis for empathetic relationships and coop-
eration as well as principled action. For enkindled souls, spiritually
inspired behavior flows not from externally imposed duties and rights
but from the spontaneous love that each member of the community has for
one another. From perceiving that we are all sheltered under the love of
the same Divine Reality comes both humility and the means for true social
cohesion.

Our different senses of identity consequently become fully realized
through the development of our spiritual identity; they each provide a
means for achieving our basic existential purpose—the discovery and
refinement of the spiritual capacities latent within us. Through the concrete

80             The Journal of Bahá’í Studies 21. 1/4. 2011

expression of such capacities—compassion, trustworthiness, fairness,
courage, forbearance, and willingness to sacrifice for the common weal—
we define a path of spiritual growth. This is the path of transcendence—a
way of being and doing in which individual identity is tied to something
greater than the self.

Human beings are social beings. The self cannot evolve outside of human
relationships. Indeed, the self develops principally through endeavors that
are participatory in nature. Virtues such as generosity, loyalty, mercy, and
civility cannot be manifested in isolation from others. The Bahá’í teachings
affirm that the principal agent of moral choice is the autonomous person.
But this autonomy is exercised within a broader social context, as well as
an all-encompassing spiritual reality that informs the nature of that social
context. The Bahá’í teachings thus offer a social conception of human iden-
tity in which the inner aspirations of the self are aligned with the goals of
a just and creative global polity. In this way, the Bahá’í community is able
to balance individual prerogative and development with the needs of the
whole, thus reconciling “the right” with the “good.”4

Realizing a common understanding of human purpose and action, espe-
cially in a complex world of pluralistic identities and rapidly shifting cul-
tural and moral boundaries, depends on the recognition and expression of
a spiritual conception of life. For the emergence of progressive modes of
living requires both an internal and external reordering—a reordering of
human preferences, priorities, and modes of social organization. By
redefining identity in terms of the totality of human experience, the Bahá’í
teachings anticipate the moral reconstruction of all human practices.
When an evolving global society draws upon the spiritual mainspring of
human identity and purpose, truly constructive avenues of social change
can be pursued. “Among the results of the manifestation of spiritual
forces,” ‘Abdu’l-Bahá confirms, “will be that the human world will adapt
itself to a new social form . . . and human equality will be universally
established” (Promulgation 132).

It is still regrettably the case that the identity of certain individuals or
groups results from a shared experience of oppression—from being the
victims of systematic discrimination or injustice. In addressing this

Identity, Discourse, and Policy                      81

dimension of human identity, Bahá’u’lláh speaks forcefully and repeatedly
about the rights and dignity of all human beings, and the indispensability
of creating mechanisms of social justice, but He also explains that spiritu-
al oppression is the most serious of all: “What ‘oppression’ is more griev-
ous than that a soul seeking the truth . . . should know not where to go for
it and from whom to seek it?” (Kitáb-i-Íqán 31). From this standpoint, it is
in the displacement of a transcendent understanding of life by an ascen-
dant materialism that we find the source of the disaffection, anomie, and
uncertainty that so pervades modern existence. All forms of oppression
ultimately find their genesis in the denial of our essential spiritual identi-
ty. As Bahá’u’lláh earnestly counsels us: “Deny not My servant should he
ask anything from thee, for his face is My face; be then abashed before Me”
(Hidden Words, Arabic no. 30).

Clearly, our search for self-definition and recognition is intimately tied
up with the struggle for social justice. Establishing patterns of reciprocal
recognition, of genuine respect and concern for “the other,” is an expres-
sion of our true identity as spiritual actors. Social integration and harmo-
ny is critically dependent on such mutual recognition. As the theorist Axel
Honneth suggests, only to the degree to which we actively care about the
development of the potentialities of others can our shared goals be real-
ized. And this requires cultivation of what Honneth terms “communicative
freedom,” or what we might describe as participatory equality—the
opportunity for all members of society to meaningfully interact and con-
tribute to public discourse and thereby to the building of a definite vision
of the common good.5

So in a very real sense, the formation and evolution of our identities
occurs through dialogue and association with others. Human life, the
philosopher Charles Taylor notes, has a “fundamentally dialogical charac-
ter” (33). It is through interchange that individuals and the communities
they compose are able to give tangible definition to their identities and
their long-term goals. Human beings are “learning, creating, communicat-
ing” beings, and therefore participatory mechanisms that allow this essen-
tial “communicative” nature to be fully expressed must characterize all
institutional practices and social arrangements.

82            The Journal of Bahá’í Studies 21. 1/4. 2011

Constructive dialogue, or what Bahá’u’lláh describes as “consultation,”
is at the very heart of social order. He indicates that consultation is the
“bestower of understanding” and that “In all things it is necessary to con-
sult,” for “no welfare and no well-being can be attained except through
consultation” (in Consultation 93). ‘Abdu’l-Bahá states: “The principle of
consultation is one of the most fundamental elements of the divine edifice.
Even in their ordinary affairs the individual members of society should
consult.” (in Consultation 97). But He adds: “[T]rue consultation is spiritu-
al conference in the attitude and atmosphere of love” (Promulgation 72).

If individuals and communities are to become the principal actors in
promoting their physical, spiritual, and social well-being, they must devel-
op the capacity to consult and act in a harmonious manner. Further,
advancing toward conditions of greater justice must involve a process of
collective reasoning that assesses the actual states of persons and commu-
nities, especially their ability to realize opportunities for choice and
action.6 Consultation, therefore—and this is critically important—can
lead to the creation of new social meanings and innovative social forms
that reflect what is reasonable and fair for communities to achieve. But any
such process of collective deliberation and decision making, the Bahá’í
writings insist, must be devoid of adversarial posturing and must be dis-
passionate and fully participatory in spirit. It is through discourse which
is inclusive and unifying that the religious impulse finds expression in the
modern age.

Obviously, there can never be an absolutely objective or static under-
standing of what constitutes concepts such as social equity, human securi-
ty, power, “the common good,” democracy, or community. There is an evo-
lutionary aspect to social development—a dynamic process of learning,
dialogue, and praxis in which social challenges and solutions are constant-
ly redefined and reassessed. There are always multiple understandings of
particular social questions and these diverse perspectives each typically
contain some measure of validity. By building a broader framework of
analysis that encompasses not only material and technical variables but
the normative and spiritual dimensions of various social issues, new
insights can emerge that enrich dialogues previously locked into narrow

conceptual boundaries. A unifying sense of identity can obviously play an
important role in facilitating and sustaining such a consultative path.

In many ways, the struggle to understand our identity is tied up with
the question of meaning in modern life. Increasingly, calls are being made
for rooting meaning and identity in community, but when the community
is religiously, morally, and culturally pluralistic in character it is challeng-
ing for diverse voices to find common ground. It is here where the Bahá’í
concepts of unity in diversity and nonadversarial dialogue and decision
making can offer a potent alternative vision of social advancement.
Engaging in a cooperative search for truth will no doubt lead to the dis-
covery and implementation of shared perspectives and values. Such open
moral dialogue within and among diverse communities can lead to a
process of action, reflection, and refinement resulting in genuine social
learning and progress.7

Meaning emerges from an independent search for truth and a chosen
freedom grounded in social experience and social participation—a partic-
ipation that leads to the enlargement of the self. Participation “creates new
identities and new solidarities” (Selznick, The Moral Commonwealth 524).
In Bahá’í communities around the globe, patterns of fellowship, knowl-
edge building, and collaboration among diverse peoples are giving rise to
a new human culture. Bahá’ís have found that encouraging new modalities
of association, participation, and dialogue is key to promoting social devel-
opment and effective local governance that is democratic in spirit and
method. Hence, Bahá’u’lláh’s statement that fellowship and sincere associ-
ation “are conducive to the maintenance of order in the world and to the
regeneration of nations” (Tablets 36).

Yet, as even a cursory review of contemporary affairs makes painfully
clear, social discourse around the world is all too often characterized by
disunity, contention, manipulation, and power seeking. How, then, can the
arena of human interchange known as the “public sphere” be reconceived
and reconstructed? The notion of the “public sphere” is a complex con-
cept in philosophy and social theory. For our purposes here, it can be
understood as the many social spaces of discourse and deliberation where
the diverse voices of society identify mutual interests, reach common

84            The Journal of Bahá’í Studies 21. 1/4. 2011

judgments, and influence action in light of those judgments.8 It can also
be described as the “realm of social life in which public opinion” is
“formed.”9 In this sense, the public sphere is where society attempts to
articulate ideas and goals related to the common good. The public sphere
gives expression to the values and aspirations of individuals and families
(the private sphere) and thereby affects the assumptions and policies of
public institutions.

Not surprisingly, many thinkers have assailed the “patterns of social
exclusion and inequality in dominant public spheres,” which have accentu-
ated social divisions and led to the fragmentation of public dialogue.10
Others contend that discourse in the public sphere is impoverished and
indeed distorted by the avoidance and exclusion of religious and spiritual
perspectives.11 The constrained vocabulary and categories of secular dis-
course fail to adequately convey the full implications of our normative
convictions, premises, and commitments (Smith 39). Drawing upon reli-
gious insights and imagination can admittedly complicate public dialogue,
but it can also serve to vitalize and deepen public deliberation. Any plau-
sible vision of social betterment must give reference to those universal
spiritual postulates that animate and guide human initiative. To ignore the
very self-understanding that individuals and communities have regarding
their essential identity and purpose is untenable and nonempirical. It
severely limits the horizons of human flourishing available to us. We need
a critical theory of society but not one in which the interpretative schema
is primarily materialistic in character.

Public discourse must seek to be “more open to alternative possibilities”
of framing social challenges, and more morally engaged, even with the
likely outcome of disagreement, because it is only in this way that social
understanding can evolve (Smith 213). Truly productive or “conscien-
tious” discursive engagement depends on fidelity to what actually grounds
human belief and action (Smith 225). Ultimately, it is only through recon-
ceiving identity—reflecting about our obligations to the multiple commu-
nities to which we are bound—that substantive and creative social direc-
tions will unfold. Reflection about our obligations to the many communi-
ties in which we are embedded, to our family, our inner selves and to God,

gives further definition to who we are and what our aims should be.12 To
not reconceive identity in this way would be to fail to draw on the very
roots of human motivation that can ensure transformation of individual
and collective behavior. This observation is underscored, for example, by
recent work exploring how moral revolutions, such as the end of Atlantic
slavery and the abandonment of Chinese footbinding, emerged as a result
of changed public perceptions about notions of human dignity and honor.13

For Bahá’ís, it is through recognition of our shared identity as noble
human agents that inequities and distortions in the public sphere will
eventually be overcome. Understanding that all human beings possess a
primary spiritual identity, and thus an underlying moral equality and
worth, serves to overcome any perceived categories of difference or dis-
tinction and opens the way for meaningful forms of cooperative action.
With belief in the fundamental oneness of human relationships, Bahá’ís
work to transcend the tendency of fragmented discourses in which some
groups seek ascendancy over others; instead, Bahá’ís strive to expand the
consciousness and capacity of communities to address their complex
needs and aspirations. In this approach, the idea of power in the public
sphere is radically reconceptualized from being a means of achieving
advantage or domination to being an instrument of conciliation, service,
truth, and unity.

Bahá’ís seek to be agents of social transformation. The issue at stake is
the type of transformation needed and how to bring it about. Both means
and ends are important. The goal of a just and unified society cannot be
attained through unjust and divisive means. Bahá’ís reject everything
associated with the prevailing culture of adversarialism and base material
motivation. But this does not imply that the Bahá’í community is disen-
gaged from vital matters of the day.

The grassroots or core activities now being pursued by Bahá’ís in all
parts of the world are inherently vehicles of personal and communal
change that inevitably lead to meaningful social endeavor and participa-
tion in public discourse. In many places, they already have. Social action is
the fruit of spiritual awakening and knowledge generation. Implicit in any
type of social action is a process of understanding and defining issues,

86            The Journal of Bahá’í Studies 21. 1/4. 2011

roles, values, and relationships—a process that is a key aspect of the new
culture taking root in the Bahá’í community. In particular, the framing of
issues—whether internal or external—is grounded in spiritual perception
and spiritual principle. In the Bahá’í experience, the empowerment of indi-
viduals and groups flows from spiritual awareness expressed in tangible
forms of service. Bahá’ís are building patterns of social learning and fel-
lowship in which meaning, understanding, and action are conjoined. This
process of building community is occurring in a variety of ways and at dif-
ferent levels.

Participation in the prevalent discourses of society is an area in which
individuals, groups, and institutions of the Faith work within their respec-
tive spheres of influence to effect positive change in prevailing patterns of
thought, communication, and practice. In a letter to a National Spiritual
Assembly, the Universal House of Justice explains that “[w]hat is impor-
tant is for Bahá’ís to be present in the many social spaces in which think-
ing and policies evolve on any one of a number of issues—on governance,
the environment, climate change, the equality of men and women, human
rights, to mention a few—so that they can, as occasions permit, offer gen-
erously, unconditionally and with utmost humility the teachings of the
Faith and their experience in applying them as a contribution to the bet-
terment of society.”14

The Bahá’í community’s contributions to public discourse are as much
about the mode of its interactions with others as about the ideas it shares.
While it is confident in bringing insights from Bahá’u’llah’s teachings to
the public sphere, and in sharing its modest experience in applying these
teachings to the challenges of daily life, it also recognizes that what it
directly learns from the Revelation of Bahá’u’lláh is complemented by
what it learns from the broader effects of the Revelation—from the
advances in knowledge across all areas of human undertaking. And so
Bahá’í participation in the discourses of society can be viewed as a process
of mutual learning with partners, one that entails a posture of collabora-
tion, sincerity, humility, openness, and flexibility. The goal is not to pres-
ent answers or persuade others to accept a Bahá’í position, but to enrich
the conceptual terrain associated with a given discourse. Previous experi-

ence has shown that the most effective Bahá’í contributions to major dis-
courses have entailed reconciling various viewpoints, raising questions
that stimulate new avenues of inquiry, and offering ways of creatively
reframing issues.15

Every public discourse has a potential policy dimension. In a broad
sense, public policy is about the nexus between individual interest and the
public interest; it is about collective intention, purpose, and effort—about
societies and communities developing strategies for realizing common
ideals and goals, defining and addressing problems, managing key social
relationships, and formulating structures and processes that channel indi-
vidual capacity and harness collective resources.

Public policy is by its very nature a subject of considerable interest to
Bahá’ís, but it is also a realm of activity where Bahá’í institutions and indi-
vidual Bahá’ís have carefully modulated the extent of their involvement.
And for good reason. Public policy of whatever form is often suffused with
political calculation, factionalism, or partisan political ideology. This obvi-
ously is something that Bahá’ís avoid because of the clearly enunciated
Bahá’í principle of nonparticipation in political matters, a principle that
safeguards the integrity and unity of the Bahá’í community.16

The Universal House of Justice indicates, though, that “involvement in
social discourse and action will at times require that Bahá’ís become asso-
ciated with the development of public policy. In this regard, the term ‘pol-
icy,’ like the term ‘politics,’ has a broad meaning. While refraining from
discussion of policies pertaining to political relations between nations or
partisan political affairs within a country, Bahá’ís will no doubt contribute
to the formulation and implementation of policies that address certain
social concerns.”17

It can be said that Bahá’ís engage in discourse on public affairs at the
level of principle. But depending on circumstance, this can be a delicate bal-
ancing act and consequently requires institutional guidance to sort out
challenges associated with particular policy dialogues. Any social issue can
be viewed through a partisan lens or perspective. Even basic terminology
previously understood in neutral ways can suddenly take on specific parti-
san meanings, and likely would not be used by Bahá’ís in certain contexts.

It is important to recognize the evolutionary nature of the principle of
noninvolvement in political affairs. There has been a gradual shift in the
nature and intensity of the interactions between Bahá’í institutions—par-
ticularly National Spiritual Assemblies—and governments. The situation
of the Bahá’ís in Iran has been a central catalyst in bringing about this
shift. As the Bahá’í community expands and as its principles and methods
for addressing the many ills of today’s world receive wider attention, it
will no doubt be called upon to help develop solutions to pressing social
challenges. Its direct engagement with government decision makers, non-
governmental organizations, and leaders of thought from the cluster to
the international level will only intensify. The Universal House of Justice
alludes to the evolving conditions facing the Bahá’í community: “With the
passage of time, practices in the political realm will definitely undergo the
profound changes anticipated in the Bahá’í writings. As a consequence,
what we understand now of the policy of non-involvement in politics will
also undergo a change. . . .”18

Policy is intimately bound up with politics and Bahá’ís should be com-
fortable with this reality. Broadly speaking, politics is concerned with the
art of governance and the organization of human affairs. Policy analysis
and policy making can be understood as the systematic expression of
political will and exchange. Policy is all about ideas and how ideas are
explored, debated, and actualized in political communities. As one policy
scholar has observed, “What communities decide about when they make
policy is meaning, not matter” (Stone 379). The development of shared
meanings about social reality simultaneously provides the conceptual and
volitional basis for collective action. The manner in which issues are
defined and possible solutions assessed is socially and politically con-
structed. Policy making, then, can be understood as an ongoing process of
dialogue in which categories of thought and action are assessed from
diverse perspectives and in light of concrete experience. In this constant
process of interchange, underlying disagreements about common ideals
and goals are reformulated or resolved.

If public policy is defined as a process which involves the assessment,
the evaluation, and ultimately the adjustment of conditions affecting the

general welfare of society, then there is no conflict with Bahá’í teachings.
Bahá’u’lláh affirms: “The progress of the world, the development of
nations, the tranquillity of peoples, and the peace of all who dwell on earth
are among the principles and ordinances of God” (Tablets 129–30). That
the “the object of every Revelation” is “to effect a transformation in the
whole character of mankind, a transformation that shall manifest itself
both outwardly and inwardly, that shall affect both its inner life and exter-
nal conditions” (Bahá’u’lláh, Kitab-i-Iqan 240) speaks to a fundamental
congruence between the policy enterprise and the activities of the Bahá’í
community.

The central objective of any public policy is to bring about systemic
transformation, and in many cases this means behavioral transforma-
tion—including changing the nature of relationships between various
social actors, the way society treats its most vulnerable members, the way
it uses natural or financial resources, the underlying assumptions it makes
concerning the value of various avenues of human endeavor, or the man-
ner in which it plans to meet the needs of future generations. So we have
a basic convergence, as both the Bahá’í Revelation and public policy are
concerned with social transformation. As Bahá’u’lláh says, “every matter
related to state affairs which ye raise for discussion falls under the shadow
of one of the words sent down from the heaven of His glorious and exalt-
ed utterance.” (Tablets 151).

Clearly, a spirit of inquiry and knowledge generation must guide the
Bahá’í community’s efforts to contribute to policy discourse. Promoting a
process of inquiry and learning among relevant policy actors can to lead
to more comprehensive understandings of social problems while simulta-
neously building bridges of cooperation among these actors. In limited
ways, this has been the experience of the Bahá’í International Community
and various National Assemblies in relation to certain discourses such as
human rights, social development, and environmental preservation. Policy
questions inevitably involve ambiguities or uncertainties which can only
be addressed by expanding or altering existing viewpoints. Collaborative
efforts to generate new knowledge can work to change dispositions and
point to possible policy solutions (Linblom 6). Such an approach can also

90            The Journal of Bahá’í Studies 21. 1/4. 2011

serve to constructively inform public opinion, an expression of public edu-
cation given great emphasis by ‘Abdu’l-Bahá.19

In any given social or political context, it is necessary to understand the
various frames of reference that inform and shape the different perspec-
tives of key policy actors. At the most basic level, policy decision makers
draw on particular views of human nature, appropriate social relation-
ships, how problems are caused and should be solved, what problems fall
into the private or public domains, what constitutes social betterment, or
what types of social improvement are possible in light of human nature,
and when cooperative or government action is required. Ideology, values,
religious world views, social history, various social and physical indica-
tors,20 ostensible empirical information from other societies, scientific data,
and the force of public opinion all contribute to the construction of inter-
pretative lenses through which potential policy paths are formulated,
decided, and evaluated. Bahá’ís consequently need to be systematic in
mapping out how particular policy issues are understood and framed
across the entire spectrum of policy stakeholders—civil society, industry,
government, academia and the general public, whether at the local, nation-
al, or international levels. Once efforts are taken in this direction, it
becomes possible to discern how Bahá’í principles and concepts can help
clarify the essential issues underlying major policy questions and how to
begin to identify practical measures in light of those principles.

The very language sometimes used in policy discourse can severely
limit policy framing and programmatic action. As an illustration, consid-
er the problem of “corruption.” In the main, the policy challenge of
addressing corruption in public life has been reduced to procedural
improvements and efforts at promoting public transparency concerning
the use of funds for social projects, but an educational component, address-
ing the question of moral leadership or moral development, is rarely men-
tioned in corruption policy discourse. A Bahá’í approach to corruption
would no doubt be very different. Bahá’ís might not even describe the
issue or goal as anticorruption policy, but rather as fostering moral devel-
opment as a precursor to moral governance. The emphasis would not
solely be on procedural and regulatory approaches but on how to awaken

the moral consciousness of individuals and harness the voluntary and
cooperative forces of communities.21 That the concepts of “capacity build-
ing” and “participation” dominate international development discourse—
but actually reflect very narrow and materialistic notions of individual and
collective empowerment—is another example. Bahá’í International
Community statements have attempted to address the issue of terminolo-
gy in development discourse by offering a more expansive understanding
of “poverty” as encompassing social, ethical, and spiritual resources as
well as material resources, and even defining the overall objective of devel-
opment policy as comprehensive “prosperity” rather than only “poverty
alleviation.”22

The sometimes contentious nature of policy making often yields less
than optimal solutions and precludes innovation. Bahá’u’llah’s exhortation
to follow the path of moderation is particularly relevant. Solutions to
problems should be truly balanced, equitable, and proportionate.
Moderation, though, does not mean compromise. Achieving consensus is
important but not by sacrificing or compromising basic principles in
doing so. “Second-best” solutions are usually not adequate. Mutuality of
purpose among policy stakeholders and an exceptional standard of fair-
ness in meeting the needs of different elements of society must always be
the goal.

Finally, a major contribution that Bahá’ís can make in the policy arena
is to demonstrate how the complementary knowledge systems of science
and religion can together raise the capacity of individuals and communi-
ties to advance well-being.23 The set of capacities necessary for building up
the social, cultural, economic, technical, and moral fabric of society
depends upon the resources of both mind and spirit. By themselves,
rational or scientific methodologies will not tell us which concepts or
norms best advance a specific social objective or competence. For this rea-
son, the knowledge we bring to bear in our discourses must be multidi-
mensional, encompassing not only techniques, methodologies, concepts,
theories, and models but also values, ideals, qualities, attributes, intuition,
and spiritual perception. Drawing on both science and religion allows us
to satisfy these diverse knowledge requirements, and to identify new

92            The Journal of Bahá’í Studies 21. 1/4. 2011

moral standards and avenues of learning in addressing emerging contexts
of social dilemmas. It also helps us avoid reductionistic approaches and to
see how various social problems are interrelated. This is not about reli-
giosity of any particular kind, but understanding how rational and spiri-
tual capacities substantively interact in fashioning our social world. It is
about accessing sources of knowledge that provide insight into the pri-
mary motivational forces of human experience and how those forces can
be mobilized to advance the processes of civilization. The Bahá’í premise
that religion is a system of knowledge is certainly challenging, but moves
public discussions about religion away from vague notions of spirituality,
misplaced conceptions of salvation, or dogmatic doctrine, and instead
brings focus to how the powers of the human spirit, in conjunction with
the methods of science, can be channeled in original and productive ways.
Conceiving religion in this manner can serve to underscore the validity of
spiritual perspectives and aspirations in shaping the social order.24

Reconstructing the public sphere is no easy task. Achieving a unity that
liberates, that is creative, that is characterized by its embrace and harmo-
nization of diversity, is the work of generations. Ultimately, of course, it is
the power of example, and specifically the development of concrete mod-
els of amity and equity, that will extend the bounds of intersubjective affir-
mation regarding the relevance of a spiritual conception of life. For those
who doubt or reject that an objective spiritual dimension informs our
social reality, Bahá’ís can only offer these words of exhortation from a
Prisoner: “Should one fail to attain unto the recognition of Him Who is
the Eternal Truth, let him at least conduct himself with reason and jus-
tice” (Bahá’u’lláh, Summons 168).

The Bahá’í concept of an inhering human diversity leading to higher
forms of unity suggests that we can and must move beyond a liberal con-
struction of pluralism that is unable to provide an overarching vision of
human development. But rather than engaging in a quixotic quest to over-
come the innumerable evils at work in society or right the “countless
wrongs afflicting a desperate age,” Bahá’ís are devoting their whole ener-
gy to building the world anew.25 As we have seen, recognizing the essen-
tial spiritual character of our identity is a defining feature of this project.

Further, at this moment in our social evolution, the appropriate locus for
action is the globe in its entirety, where all members of the human family
are joined together in a common enterprise of promoting justice and social
integration.

Bahá’u’lláh provides us with a potent new moral grammar that allows
us to appreciate and nurture human diversity while expanding our hori-
zons beyond the parochial to a solidarity encompassing the boundaries of
the planet itself. He offers a vision of a comprehensive good that recog-
nizes and values the particular while promoting an integrating framework
of global learning and cooperation. His summons to unity articulates an
entirely new ethics and way of life—one that flows from a spiritual under-
standing of human history, purpose, and development.

This spiritually based conception of social life goes beyond notions of
mutual advantage and prudence associated with the idea of the social con-
tract. While the principle of self-interested, rational exchange implied by
the social contract indisputably represents an advance over coercion as a
basis for social existence, there surely exists a step beyond rational
exchange. Bahá’u’lláh instead offers a covenant of universal fellowship, a
spiritually empowered ethic of deep and abiding commitment, as the basis
for collective life. As a result of this covenant of oneness, in the depriva-
tion and suffering of others we see ourselves. Such a frame of reference
opens the door to critical reflection and true social renewal. In the words
of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá: “Let all be set free from the multiple identities that were
born of passion and desire, and in the oneness of their love for God find a
new way of life” (Selections 76).

A distinction is thus made between the moral and spiritual equality of all
human beings and the differentiation that may exist in how individuals serve
society.

4. In the vocabulary of moral philosophy, “the good” refers to a vision of hap-
piness, human well-being, or a specific way of life. Thus, many conceptions of “the
good” are possible. “The right” refers to types of principled or just action—bind-
ing duties, codes, and standards that regulate and guide how individuals pursue
their particular notions of the good. Modern liberal thought, going back to
Immanuel Kant, places emphasis on the right over the good. Communitarians
have critiqued this view, arguing that it has led to the exaggerated individualism
of Western society.

8. It is helpful to note that in the sense used here, “discourse” refers to the col-
lective processes of social interchange and discussion relating to a particular sub-
ject area—for example, the international human rights discourse. More generally
it can allude to a framework of concepts, shared understandings, and practices
through which particular aspects of social reality are interpreted and constructed.

12. The recognition and exercise of such duties provide the very framework for
actualizing human rights. A complementary relationship thus exists between
duties and rights. That individuals have specific entitlements or needs informs us
of particular duties that attach to other individuals or the broader society.
Bahá’u’lláh speaks of both duties and rights in shaping social reality.

15. Sometimes simply sharing Bahá’í principles of consultation has been a
notable contribution to a policy dialogue. The Bahá’í community’s moral leader-

ship—its commitment to integrity, fairness, the search for truth, serving the com-
mon interest, and to articulating a spiritual conception of social reality—also
characterizes its participation in public discourse.

16. Shoghi Effendi emphasizes that the standard of rectitude expected of the
followers of Bahá’u’lláh must include “non-acceptance of political posts, non-
identification with political parties, non-participation in political controversies,
and non-membership in political organizations. . . .” (Advent of Divine Justice 26).

and this is impossible except through the use of adequate arguments and the
adducing of clear, comprehensive and conclusive proofs” (‘Abdu’l-Bahá, Secret

20. Indicators often drive policy decision making. However, indicators can often
be misleading if they are measuring variables of secondary importance. For exam-
ple, education statistics compiled by UN agencies and national governments typ-
ically measure the percentage of students of a population enrolled in schools,
teacher-to-student ratios or the number of new educational facilities built. Rarely,
if ever, do educational indicators attempt to address the question of educational
quality, for example, the content of educational curricula.

21. As the Bahá’í International Community underscores: “The adoption of
administrative procedures and legal safeguards, however important such meas-
ures may be, will not bring about enduring changes in individual and institution-
al behavior. For governance, in essence, is a moral and spiritual practice whose
compass is found within the human heart” (“Overcoming Corruption”).
