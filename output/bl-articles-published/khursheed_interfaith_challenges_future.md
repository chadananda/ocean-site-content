           Crossing Religious Boundaries:
Interfaith Challenges for the Future

Anjam Khursheed

Abstract

The purpose of this paper is to summarize the growing world-wide
interest in interfaith activities and how Baha'is can work together with it.
It first describes a Baha'i approach to inter-religious harmony, which
includes: coming together with people of other faiths in the spirit of
searching after truth; having the humility not to go beyond one's
experience; understanding that there are elements to religious faith which
are relative, subjective and progressive; testing theology by its moral
effects, and propagating religious truths primarily by the force of
example. The paper sets out to demonstrate how the modern interfaith
movement is also advocating these same principles. More and more
believers from the Abrahamic faiths are abandoning their traditional
position of religious exclusivism, and identifying with a more globally
pluralistic outlook, where all religions are understood to be equally true
and complementary in nature. This process is bringing about a radical
revision of traditional theology and missionary work. There is a
preference to meet people of other faiths in a spirit of fellowship, rather
than in competition. The theme of this paper is that Baha'is can learn
much from this global trend towards inter-religious harmony. Baha'is
must have the humility to acknowledge that although they have world
religious unity as one of their core fundamental principles, they are as
yet, only beginning to understand how it might be translated into
practice. They too, like everyone else, are a natural part of the world-
wide interfaith experience. Baha'is can learn lessons from the inter-
religious harmony of India and the Far East, just as many Christians,
Jews and Muslims have already done. The paper argues that this process
of learning is essential to the specific mission of the Baha'i Faith, which
is to fulfil the aspirations of all previous religions. Baha'i missionary
work need not be in conflict with their interfaith activity, provided that

Baha'is understand their mission in the broader terms of creating unity
and fellowship. Nor is the Baha'i interfaith contribution independent of
Baha'i community life. The quality of the fellowship Baha'is can offer to
people of other faiths is critically dependent on the degree to which they
can achieve unity and harmony amongst themselves.

1\.        The Interfaith Challenge

As we move inexorably towards a multi-faith global village, more and
more people today are crossing traditional religious boundaries. Whether
they be religious fundamentalists, reformists, or liberals, whether they
identify themselves with a religion or not, people from all backgrounds
are joining in the multi-faith debate.

The modern interfaith movement has been developing alongside the
Baha'i Faith in the West, and there have been times when the two
converged. The first Parliament of the World's Religions conference
took place in 1893 in Chicago, and is widely regarded to be the start of
the modern interfaith movement1. The conference also has a significant
place in Baha'i history, since it was one of the first times that the Baha'i
Faith was mentioned in a public forum in the West. Although the Baha'i
Faith was not represented at the conference, a paper by Reverend Henry
H. Jessup, director of Presbyterian Missionary Operations in North Syria,
referred to Baha'u'llah (the founder of the Baha'i Faith) as a "Persian
Sage", and closed with the well-known pen portrait of Baha'u'llah by the
Cambridge University scholar E. G. Browne2. But there is considerable

Marcus Braybrooke, in his Pilgrimage of Hope, One Hundred Years of Global
Interfaith Dialogue, "Although flawed in several ways as a model of interfaith co-
operation, the Parliament of the World's Religions, held at Chicago in 1893, has come to
mark the beginning of what is now known as 'the interfaith movement", p. 8.

Baha'i Faith, God Passes By. He writes, on p. 256, "... a paper written by Rev. Henry H.
Jessup, D.D., Director of Presbyterian Missionary Operations in North Syria, and read by
Rev. George A. Ford of Syria... it was announced that, 'a famous Persian Sage... the
Bábi Saint' had died recently in Akka, ... 'a Cambridge scholar' had visited Him, to
whom he has expressed 'sentiments so noble, so Christ-like' that the author of the paper,
in his 'closing words' wished to share them with his audience". Jessup quoted from E.G.
Browne's interview with Baha'u'llah, "We desire but the good of the world and happiness
of the nations; yet they deem us a stirrer up of strife and sedition worthy of bondage and

irony in how the Baha'i Faith came to be mentioned at the conference.
Jessup's paper set out to demonstrate the social, political, moral and
religious superiority of the Anglo-Saxon race, and its duty to
Christianize humanity3.

Apparently, quite independently, a Baha'i Syrian doctor by the name of
Ibrahim Khayrullah, who had learned of the Baha'i Faith in Cairo, had
settled in Chicago in February 1894, and was the first Baha'i in the North
American continent to actively promote Baha'i teachings4. Over a space
of only a few years, a Baha'i community began to develop in Chicago, in
the years following the first Parliament of the World's Religions
conference. Among the first to join the Baha'i Faith was the American,
Thornton Chase, who in Baha'i history, is referred to as the first Baha'i in
the West5. This occurred in 1894. Both the history of the Baha'i Faith in
the West and the modern interfaith movement had their beginnings with
events that took place in Chicago around the years 1893-4.

In 1933, a World Fellowship of Faiths conference was held in Chicago,
modeled after the 1893 Parliament of the World's Religions conference.
Shoghi Effendi, then head of the Baha'i Faith6, encouraged Baha'is to
participate at the conference, stating that it was "in harmony with the
spirit of the teachings"7. In 1936, the impetus towards interfaith activities
gathered further momentum by the holding of the World Congress of
Faiths conference in London. Shoghi Effendi was invited to give a paper.
Shoghi Effendi delegated the task to an Irish Baha'i scholar, George
Townshend. Townshend was at that time still a clergyman (Archdeacon),
and had just finished writing his first book on the relationship of the
Baha'i Faith to Christianity8. Townshend went on to publish many more

such books, and was later recognised for his contributions to the growth
of the Baha'i Faith in the United Kingdom9. The 1936 Townshend
interfaith paper was published in "Faiths and Fellowship", the World
Congress of Faiths conference proceedings, along with the discussion it
generated. It is reprinted here, in this Baha'i Studies volume. From the
various reports of the conference, it is clear that there was a considerable
amount of Baha'i involvement10.

George Townshend's paper has historical significance. It was checked by
Shoghi Effendi himself, and is one of the first Baha'i statements made in
a modern interfaith setting. Moreover, it was written by one of the most
distinguished Baha'i scholars of the time. In a letter to George
Townshend, Shoghi Effendi stated that his 1936 interfaith paper was
"impressive, convincing, and its moderate tone will greatly appeal to the
British mind"11. The paper, entitled, "Baha'u'llah's Ground Plan of
World Fellowship", starts off by stating that the aim of the Baha'i
"ground plan of fellowship" is in "complete accord" with the purpose of
the World Congress of Faiths conference, a purpose which Townshend
described to be the promotion of the "spirit of fellowship through the
inspiration of religion."12

Shoghi Effendi refers to the "World Fellowship of Faiths" conference in
1936 alongside other interfaith events. He specifically encourages
members of the Baha'i community to participate in such activities so that
the "universality and comprehensiveness" of the Baha'i Faith can be
demonstrated and so that "vital and enduring links" between Baha'i
administrative agencies and interfaith organizations can develop13.

who had rendered outstanding services to the Baha'i Faith

The World Congress of Faiths organization has played an influential role
in helping to promote interfaith activities around the world. Interfaith
activities were resumed after the Second World War, where conferences
organized by various groups began to take place regularly. However, in
the last few decades, interest in interfaith issues has become much more
widespread. This year sees the convergence of two interfaith
conferences, one local to Singapore and the other global. In their own
ways, they constitute important landmarks in the development of inter-
religious harmony. In June, the Inter-Religious Organisation of
Singapore (IRO) celebrated its 50th anniversary, while in December, the
3rd Parliament of the World's Religions conference takes place in Cape
Town, South Africa.

The visionary behind the Inter-Religious Organisation of Singapore, a
Muslim missionary from India, Maulana Shah Muhammad 'AbduT
Aleem Siddiqui Al Qadri, described its aim to be that of providing a
forum whereby followers of each and every religion can "know the
teachings of other religions, so that a spirit of fellowship might be
created among them and so that they could all work together to spread
the accepted moral principles and to fight the common evils"14. On the
global level, the same sentiment is expressed in the mission statement of
the 3rd Parliament of the World's Religions conference, which is to
create, "harmony and cooperation between the world's religious and
spiritual communities, giving rise to their commitment and contribution
to a more just and peaceable world"15. These two mission statements
obviously echo Townshend's description of the common ground between
the Baha'i Faith and interfaith movements, namely the "spirit of
fellowship through the inspiration of religion".

In Singapore, the Baha'i community organized a series of annual "World
Religion Day" conferences from 1995 onwards, which were
subsequently jointly held with the Inter-Religious Organisation (IRO) of
Singapore. The First World Religion Day organized by Baha'is in
Singapore took place in 1956. Baha'is formally became members of the
IRO in 1997. This year, (1999), the name of the Baha'i Faith appeared on

a postage stamp along with the names of eight other religions, brought
out to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the IRO. The rise of the Baha'i
Faith in South East Asia and the interfaith movement in Singapore have
also, like elsewhere, been progressing side by side. One year after the
formation of the IRO in Singapore in 1949, the first Baha'i missionaries
to Singapore arrived. Dr K. M. Fozdar and his wife, Mrs Shirin Fozdar,
were not only the first teachers of the Baha'i Faith to Singapore, but they
inspired the growth of Baha'i communities throughout the whole of
South East Asia16.

The aim of this paper is to clarify the relationship between the Baha'i
Faith and the ideals of the modern interfaith movement, so that Baha'is
and members of other faiths can be more effective in creating a "spirit of
fellowship through the inspiration of religion". There are many ways in
which Baha'is and their fellow interfaith co-workers can learn from each
other. Baha'is can learn to appreciate the great principles of other
religions and how they have transformed history. They can learn much
from the vast experience already accumulated on inter-religious harmony
and seek ways to correlate their own principles to it. On the other hand,
Baha'is have a specific mission to carry out: they are charged with the
mission of fulfilling the promise of all the world's major faiths. They
have the duty, through the teachings of Baha'u'llah, to bring about the
unity of mankind. In the Baha'i writings, the unity of religions is
described to be the "cornerstone" principle upon which the unity of
mankind is to be founded17.

It should be emphasized from the outset that the views presented in this
paper are the author's personal views, and should not be taken to be
representative of a single Baha'i approach to the subject of interfaith
harmony. They are of course, many other possible approaches. For more
articles by Baha'is on this subject, the reader may wish to refer to articles
written by May and Fazel18.

2\.        The relationship of the Baha'i Faith to other religions

If the aim of the interfaith movement is to bring about more inter-
religious harmony, it is in complete accord with Baha'i principles.
Baha'is are expressly enjoined by Baha'u'llah to associate with peoples of
all religions in a spirit of friendship and fellowship. Baha'u'llah states,
"Consort with all religions with amity and concord, that they may inhale
from you the sweet fragrance of God"19. These kinds of statements, both
by Baha'u'llah and 'AbduT-Bahá20, make it clear that to participate in
initiatives aimed at bringing about a greater degree of interfaith harmony
is for Baha'is, a religious duty.

The insight that all religions are fundamentally one, described to be the
"unalterable foundation and central tenet of Baha'i belief in the Baha'i
writings21, does not make the Baha'i Faith syncretic nor does it mean that
it believes that all religions are the same. The Baha'i Faith is an
independent world religion which has its own revealed scripture, laws
and codes of ethics. It has its own doctrines and teachings that are based
upon the writings of Baha'u'llah, its founder (1817-1892). The Baha'i
principle of "progressive revelation" teaches that there are two parts to
every religion, an eternal part which is essentially common to all faiths,
while the other part is transient, relative to the time and place and
understanding of the people to whom it is revealed. The transient part
typically pertains to the social laws and ordinances of a religion, while
the eternal part consists of spiritual ideals and qualities. 'Abdu'1-Bahá,
describes it in the following way,

"The Law of God is divided into two parts. One is the fundamental basis
which comprises all spiritual things - ... it will never be abrogated, for it
is spiritual and not material truth; it is faith, knowledge, certitude,

the darkness of estrangement amidst the peoples and kindreds of the world may give way
to the Light of unity", Will and Testament of 'Abdu'UBaha, p. 14.

justice, piety, righteousness, trustworthiness, love of God, benevolence,
purity, detachment, humility, meekness, patience and constancy ... The
second part of the Religion of God, which refers to the material world,
and which comprises fasting, prayer, forms of worship, marriage and
divorce, the abolition of slavery, legal processes, transactions,
indemnities for murder, violence, theft and injuries - this part of the Law
of God, which refers to material things, is modified and altered in each
prophetic cycle in accordance with the necessities of the time."22

Elsewhere, 'AbduT-Bahá refers to the eternal spiritual part of religion as
its "inner side", while calling the transient side its "external side"23.
Baha'ullah likens the difference between the founders of religion to be
like wearing different clothing, that is, it is only in external appearance
that they differ. The "Prophets", "have appeared clothed in divers attire",
but they are really "soaring in the same heaven, seated upon the same
throne, uttering the same speech"24. Their differences, are like "accents
of God"25. From a spiritual inner perspective, they speak with one voice,
utter the "the same speech", but outwardly, they sound different. Their
difference is a superficial one, like different accents on the same word.
Baha'ullah equates the recognition of this unity with "the highest and
innermost sanctuary of the inner meaning of the Word of God"2 .

In his 1936 interfaith paper, Townshend emphasises the point that the
unity of all religions is most effectively approached at the mystical level.
He quotes the famous Christian mystic, Evelyn Underhill, noting the
universality of the mystic experience. Referring to religious mystics,
Underhill writes, "whatever the place or period in which they have
arisen, their aims, doctrines and methods have been substantially the
same"27. Townshend gives a poetic analogy to illustrate the Baha'i

see for instance, "If we abandon hearsay and investigate the reality and inner
significance of the heavenly teachings, we will find the same divine foundation of love
for humanity", Promulgation of Universal Peace, p. 232, also in Paris Talks p. 136, in
the context of finding religious harmony, 'Abdu'1-Bahá states, "we should therefore,
detach ourselves from the external forms and practices of religion".

approach. He likens each religion to be like a temple which blends in
within its own environment, but which from afar, looks to be quite
different to other temples. Only by going inside them, "within their
sacred structures", do we discover a "kinship in beauty", an inner unity:

"This age of widening consciousness and deepening love of truth has
begun to bring us, on a scale quite unprecedented, some accurate
knowledge of the sacred treasures and the sacred history of the human
race. Scholars, divines, men of letters, poets have all contributed to this
enlightenment. They show us each of the great religions as being like a
majestic temple reared in some chosen spot by the hand of a master
architect, and surrounded now by a multitude of lesser buildings of
various later dates. Each temple blends with its own environment but is
in marked contrast with all the other temples. No two are alike, and the
annexes connected with each are still more unlike. But if the enquiring
traveller pursues his investigations and makes his way within the sacred
scriptures, he discovers in their several interiors and even in the shrines
themselves an unmistakable kinship in beauty"28.

Here Townshend touches upon another important Baha'i principle. In
addition to the Baha'i two-fold distinction of a transient and eternal part
to every religion, is the teaching that humanity is evolving spiritually,
and that the teachings of each religion represent successive phases in the
development of "one truth". The "widening consciousness and
deepening love of truth" of this age is part of a greater process of
spiritual evolution:

"The fundamental principle enunciated by Baha'u'llah ... is that religious
truth is not absolute but relative, that Divine Revelation is a continuous
and progressive process, that all the great religions of the world are
divine in origin, that their basic principles are in complete harmony, that
their aims and purposes are one and the same, that their teachings are but
facets of one truth, that their functions are complementary, that they
differ only in the nonessential aspects of their doctrines, and that their
missions represent successive stages in the spiritual evolution of human
society..."29

\[28\] Ibid., p. 304.

\[29\] Shoghi Effendi, The Promised Day is Come, page v.

This means that for Baha'is, religious truth is partially relative in at least
two senses. In one sense, there is a portion of religious truth that is
adapted to the needs and requirements of the people to whom it is
revealed, and secondly, all religions are a natural part of the progressive
spiritual evolution of humanity. Baha'u'llah claims to have brought the
latest revelation in this evolutionary process, one which is directed to the
whole world. He claims to be the "Promised One of all ages", declaring
that all past religious prophecies and ideals will find their fulfilment in
His revelation30. This is of course, a momentous claim. Each individual
is invited to investigate it for his or her own self. The specific mission of
the Baha'i Faith is to usher in the prophesised age of universal unity and
peace. This, according to Baha'u'llah, is the requirement of this age, the
"unity of the human race"31. Religions can no longer advance separately
and spiritual progress must be global in nature. Religious unity is thus an
inseparable part of the future of mankind. 'Abdu'1-Bahá states, "The gift
of God to this enlightened age is the knowledge of the oneness of
mankind and of the fundamental oneness of religion. War shall cease
between nations, and by the will of God the Most Great Peace shall
come; the world will be seen as a new world, and all men will live as
brothers"32. Baha'ullah's words, quoted at the first Parliament of the
World's Religions in 1893 express the same sentiment, "We desire but
the good of the world and happiness of the nations; yet they deem us a
stirrer up of strife and sedition worthy of bondage and banishment... That
all nations should become one in faith and all men as brothers."33

In the interfaith context, this naturally raises the question of whether the
claim of Baha'u'llah to be the "Promised One" implies that the Baha'i
Faith is in any way superior to other faiths, or whether it somehow
supersedes them. Are there not in the Baha'i writings, passages which
emphasise its distinctive "preeminent" character, stating that it "stands
unparalleled in the annals of the past, nor will future ages witness its
like"?34 Is the Baha'i Faith not a strongly missionary religion which calls

"O people! The Day, promised unto you in all Scriptures is now come", Gleanings, p.

beings, both seen and unseen have rejoiced. Take ye advantage of this Day", Kitáb-i-

upon its members to bring about the "eventual recognition by all
mankind of the indispensability, the uniqueness and the supreme station
of the Baha'i Revelation"?35.

The answer to this question is clearly given in the Baha'i writings.
Although the Baha'i Faith claims to be the fulfilment of previous
religions, Baha'u'llah never regarded Himself to be superior to the
founders of other religions, nor must Baha'is ever consider their faith to
be intrinsically superior to other faiths. The differences between religions
are to be entirely accounted for by the differing requirements and needs
of the people to whom they were revealed. The greatness of the Baha'i
Faith does not lie in the superiority of its founder over the founders of
previous faiths, rather, it comes from the greatness of this age36.

Throughout the Baha'i writings, whenever the uniqueness and sublime
character of Baha'u'llah's revelation is emphasised, it is followed by an
equally forceful statement on the intrinsic unity and equality of all
religions. Baha'u'llah declares that, "Take heed that ye do not vacillate in
your determination to embrace the truth of this Cause - a Cause through
which the potentialities of the might of God have been revealed, and His
sovereignty established. With faces beaming with joy, hasten ye unto
Him. This is the changeless Faith of God, eternal in the past, eternal in
the future"37. In fact, Baha'u'llah emphatically warns his followers that
they must never yield to the temptation of making any distinction
between the founders of religions, or in any way imply that one is
superior to another:

\[35\] In the context of describing the aims of members that serve on Baha'i administrative
institutions, Shoghi Effendi states, "Whether it be by an open and bold assertion of the
fundamental verities of the Cause, or the adoption of a less direct and more cautious
method of teaching; whether by the dissemination of our literature or the example of our
conduct, our one aim and sole object should be to help in the eventual recognition by all
mankind of the indispensability, the uniqueness and the supreme station of the Baha'i
Revelation. Whatever method he adopts, and however indirect the course he chooses to
pursue, every true believer should regard such a recognition as the supreme goal of his
endeavor. Baha'i world." (Letter addressed to the members of the National Spiritual
Assembly of the Baha'is of the United States and Canada, 11th May Í926, quoted in
Baha'i Administration, p. 109)

\[36\] Shoghi Effendi, The World Order of Baha'u'llah, p. 166.

\[37\] Baha'u'llah, Gleanings, p. 136.

"Beware, O believers in the Unity of God, lest ye be tempted to make
any distinction between any of the Manifestations of His Cause, or to
discriminate against the signs that have accompanied and proclaimed
their Revelation. This indeed is the true meaning of Divine Unity, if ye
be of them that apprehend and believe this truth. Be ye assured,
moreover, that the works and acts of each and every one of these
Manifestations of God, nay whatever pertaineth unto them, and
whatsoever they may manifest in the future, are all ordained by God, and
are a reflection of His Will and Purpose. Whoso maketh the slightest
possible difference between their persons, their words, their messages,
their acts and manners, hath indeed disbelieved in God, hath repudiated
His signs, and betrayed the Cause of His Messengers" .

This is one of the most explicit declarations of religious equality that
appears in all sacred scripture. Full equality between the founders of all
the world's major religions is an inherent requirement of being a Baha'i.
A Christian cannot become a Baha'i unless he or she accept that the
revelation of Islam stands on an equal footing to Christianity and that the
Quran is the "Word of God". Nor can a Jew become a Baha'i unless he
or she accept that Christianity and Islam are, like Judaism, covenants
from God. Likewise, all members of the Abrahamic Faiths who embrace
the Baha'i Faith must accept that Hinduism and Buddhism are divine
revelations which are equal in importance to their former faith. Each
religion, from the Baha'i perspective, has been indispensable to the
spiritual welfare of mankind.

After describing the uniqueness of the Baha'i Faith, and referring to the
founders of other faiths as "preliminary Manifestations", Shoghi Effendi
reiterates the "oneness" of religions:

"The successive Founders of all past Religions Who, from time
immemorial, have shed, with ever-increasing intensity, the splendor of
one common Revelation at the various stages which have marked the
advance of mankind towards maturity may thus, in a sense, be regarded
as preliminary Manifestations, anticipating and paving the way for the
advent of that Day of Days when the whole earth will have fructified and
the tree of humanity will have yielded its destined fruit. Incontrovertible

\[38\] Baha'u'llah, Gleanings, pp. 59-60.

as is this truth, its challenging character should never be allowed to
obscure the purpose, or distort the principle, underlying the utterances of
Baha'ullah - utterances that have established for all time the absolute
oneness of all the Prophets, Himself included, whether belonging to the
past or to the future. Though the mission of the Prophets preceding
Baha'ullah may be viewed in that light, though the measure of Divine
Revelation with which each has been entrusted must, as a result of this
process of evolution, necessarily differ, their common origin, their
essential unity, their identity of purpose, should at no time and under no
circumstances be misapprehended or denied. That all the Messengers of
God should be regarded as "abiding in the same Tabernacle, soaring in
the same Heaven, seated upon the same Throne, uttering the same
Speech, and proclaiming the same Faith"39 must, however much we may
extol the measure of Divine Revelation vouchsafed to mankind at this
crowning stage of its evolution, remain the unalterable foundation and
central tenet of Baha'i belief. Any variations in the splendor which each
of these Manifestations of the Light of God has shed upon the world
should be ascribed not to any inherent superiority involved in the
essential character of any one of them, but rather to the progressive
capacity, the ever-increasing spiritual receptiveness, which mankind, in
its progress towards maturity, has invariably manifested"40.

Elsewhere, Shoghi Effendi writes

"Nor does the Baha'i Revelation, claiming as it does to be the
culmination of a prophetic cycle and the fulfilment of the promise of all
ages, attempt, under any circumstances, to invalidate those first and
everlasting principles that animate and underlie the religions that have
preceded it. The God-given authority, vested in each one of them, it
admits and establishes as its firmest and ultimate basis. It regards them
in no other light except as different stages in the eternal history and
constant evolution of one religion, Divine and indivisible, of which it
itself forms but an integral part. It neither seeks to obscure their Divine

\[39\] Shoghi Effendi quotes Baha'ullah, "ft is clear and evident to thee that all the Prophets
are the Temples of the Cause of God, Who have appeared clothed in divers attire. If thou
wilt observe with discriminating eyes, thou wilt behold Them all abiding in the same
tabernacle, soaring in the same heaven, seated upon the same throne, uttering the same
speech, and proclaiming the same Faith", Gleanings, p. 52.

origin, nor to dwarf the admitted magnitude of their colossal
achievements. It can countenance no attempt that seeks to distort their
features or to stultify the truths which they instill. Its teachings do not
deviate a hairbreadth from the verities they enshrine, nor does the weight
of its message detract one jot or one tittle from the influence they exert
or the loyalty they inspire. Far from aiming at the overthrow of the
spiritual foundation of the world's religious systems, its avowed, its
unalterable purpose is to widen their basis, to restate their fundamentals,
to reconcile their aims, to reinvigorate their life, to demonstrate their
oneness, to restore the pristine purity of their teachings, to co-ordinate
their functions and to assist in the realization of their highest aspirations.
These divinely-revealed religions, as a close observer has graphically
expressed it, "are doomed not to die, but to be reborn...'Does not the
child succumb in the youth and the youth in the man; yet neither child
nor youth perishes?'..." 41

The call for Baha'i missionary work must go hand in hand with the
equally important principle of the oneness of religions. This means that
Baha'is should never find themselves competing with members of other
religions for converts. They should ultimately regard all religions as
manifestations of "one religion", the "same Faith" and their purpose with
respect to other religions should be to, "widen their basis, to restate their
fundamentals, to reconcile their aims, to reinvigorate their life, to
demonstrate their oneness, to restore the pristine purity of their
teachings, to co-ordinate their functions and to assist in the realization of
their highest aspirations". This most definitely requires inculcating a
spirit of fellowship with members of other faiths.

In the Baha'i writings, the spiritual development of mankind as a whole
is likened to the growth of a human being, who grows through the
various stages of childhood, youth and adulthood42. The last two lines in
the citation already quoted from Shoghi also uses the same analogy for
religions, "does not the child succumb in the youth and the youth in the
man; yet neither child or youth perishes"43. Here Shoghi Effendi is

drawing from an analogy given by the Báb44 "True knowledge ... is the
knowledge of God, and this is none other than the recognition of His
Manifestation in each Dispensation ... This doth not mean, however, that
one ought not to yield praise unto former Revelations. On no account is
this acceptable, inasmuch as it behooveth man, upon reaching the age of
nineteen, to render thanksgiving for the day of his conception as an
embryo. For had the embryo not existed, how could he have reached his
present state? Likewise had the religion taught by Adam not existed, this
Faith would not have attained its present stage.'

The analogy of different religions being like different phases in human
growth needs to be considered carefully. On a superficial level it might
appear to support the belief that the later religions are in some way more
advanced than the earlier ones. But, both the Báb and Shoghi Effendi
present this analogy to state precisely the opposite, that is, they use it to
describe the equality of all religions. This analogy has been previously
explained in an earlier Singapore Baha'i Studies Review article in the
following way:

"During childhood, a human being learns fundamental principles which
stay with him for the rest of his life, arguably, childhood is the most
important period. Most of us in childhood and youth go through various
experiences, learn different principles, which are not related together. It
is only usually during the adult phase of our lives that the different
experiences of our past are pieced together, put into a wider perspective.
It is only usually as an adult that the different lessons of the past acquire
a greater meaning. Of course, each phase of our life is equally important,
and at any one stage, we are still the same person. Along with each phase
of our growth, we are discovering more about ourselves. But the
consciousness of our self-identity does not fully mature until we are
adults. Adulthood is the time that we are best able to integrate our
different experiences together. The Baha'i claim is that mankind as a
whole is approaching the phase of maturity or adulthood, and is at
present caught in the tumultuous phase of the rebellious youth46. All
religions have taught us fundamental lessons which will always remain,

taken to be one of the three principal figures of the Baha'i Faith.

but this is the time in our collective history when all these different past
experiences will be brought together"47. Baha'u'llah claimed to have
brought the revelation which will achieve this unity. This is, in a
nutshell, the unique claim of the Baha'i Faith. Baha'is are not in any way
superior to members of other faiths, or to people of no faith. They are to
be distinguished by the nature of their task. They are specifically called
upon to unite all religions.

In the context of arriving at religious harmony, the Baha'i writings
frequently stress the need to "search after truth". When asked for the best
way to unite people of different faiths together, 'Abdu'1-Bahá replied,
"Search after truth. Seek the realities in all religions. Put aside
superstitions. Many of us do not realize the Reality of all Religions"48.
The Baha'i writings stress the need to investigate things for oneself, first-
hand, and minimise the passive absorption of second-hand information.
We are encouraged, wherever possible, to go to the source, to investigate
for ourselves. In matters of religion, this means that we must read and
understand the scriptures of different faiths for ourselves, and not be
content to rely on other people's description of them. In the Baha'i Faith,
not investigating matters for ourselves is stated to be the chief source of
propagating religious prejudices. If however, our motivation is to search
for truth, then, according to the Baha'i writings, we will naturally be led
to discover that all religions are one:

"In order to find truth we must give up our prejudices, our own small
trivial notions; an open mind is essential. If oqr chalice is full of self,
there is no room in it for the water of life. The fact that we imagine
ourselves to be right and everybody is wrong is the greatest of all
obstacles in the path towards unity, and unity is necessary if we would
reach truth, for truth is one... when we are earnest in our search for
anything, we look for it everywhere. This principle we must carry out in
our search for truth. Science must be accepted. No one truth can
contradict another truth. Light is good in whatsoever lamp it is burning!
A rose is beautiful in whatsoever garden it may bloom! A star has the
same radiance if it shines from the East or from the West. Be free from
prejudice, so you will love the Sun of Truth from whatsoever point in the

\[47\] A. Khursheed, 'The Hindu Concept of God: Unity in Diversity', The Singapore Baha'i
Studies Review, Volume 2, 1997, pp. 3-49.

horizon it may arise! You will realize that if the Divine light of truth
shone in Jesus Christ it also shone in Moses and in Buddha. The earnest
seeker will arrive at this truth. This is what is meant by the 'Search after
Truth'. It means, also, that we must be willing to clear away all that we
have previously learned, all that would clog our steps on the way to
truth; we must not shrink if necessary from beginning our education all
over again. We must not allow our love for any religion or any one
personality to so blind our eyes that we become fettered by superstition!
When we are freed from all these bonds, seeking with liberated minds,
then shall we be able to arrive at our goal. 'Seek the truth, the truth shall
make you free.' So shall we see the truth in all religions, for truth is in all
and truth is one!"49

Townshend in his 1936 interfaith talk describes "truth" to be the "living
rock" upon which the "Baha'i programme of fellowship" is based, and
goes on to describe it as the "sole real corrective of all forms of error":

"Man's advancing power is due to his increasing knowledge of truth; and
the magnificence of this present age bears witness in the last resort not to
the personal greatness of this generation, but rather to the greatness of a
continuously unfolding Truth. If this Age is to become the Age of
Universal Brotherhood, it must be the Age of Knowledge, knowledge of
Truth. The Truth will set us free. The Truth will make us one. As the first
item of his programme, therefore, Baha'u'llah claimed that every
individual should have the right of seeking for himself the truth. Love of
truth, which at the present time is growing apace among mankind, is the
sole real corrective of all forms of error and illusion. The great enmities
which in the past have divided mankind, and which were due to
misunderstanding and ignorance, have, in recent times, lost their vitality,
and our estrangements are now due chiefly to the instinct of imitation
and to prejudice. These prejudices have come down to us from the past,
racial, religious, national. For them all, Baha'u'llah offers one radical
cure, the search after truth"50.

The "search after truth" principle is sometimes referred to as "unfettered
search after truth", to emphasise that it involves us making every effort

\[49\] 'Abdu'1-Bahá, Paris Talks, pp. 136-7.

\[50\] George Townshend, 'Baha'u'llah's Ground Plan of World Fellowship', Faiths and
Fellowship, p303

to rise above our prejudices. It is important to note that the "search after
truth principle also applies to Baha'is, that is, it is an attitude of mind.
We should not be content with another person's description of religion,
even where we share the same beliefs. We should investigate for
ourselves. Baha'is should read and reflect on the Baha'i writings for
themselves. If Baha'u'llah makes a claim, it needs to be tested by one's
own experience. Religious truth cannot be propagated by tradition, from
generation to generation, it must be rediscovered by each new
generation.

Another corollary of the search after truth principle is that Baha'is should
not attempt to convince others about the truth of Baha'u'llah's claim, but
rather, they should let other people investigate it for themselves. The
requirement of making one's own investigation, as opposed to relying on
tradition or respected authorities is of course, the essence of a scientific
approach. Science advances when people think for themselves and do
hot blindly follow others. The Baha'i Faith has been referred to as
"scientific in its method" by Shoghi Effendi51. The old approach of
"preaching" the message must be replaced by a spirit of investigating
truth, because that is what the "unfolding Truth" for this age requires:

"In accordance with the divine teachings in this glorious dispensation we
should not belittle anyone and call him ignorant, saying: 'You know not,
but I know'. Rather, we should look upon others with respect, and when
attempting to explain and demonstrate, we should speak as if we are
investigating the truth, saying: 'Here these things are before us. Let us
investigate to determine where and in what form the truth can be found.'
The teacher should not consider himself as learned and others ignorant.
Such a thought breedeth pride, and pride is not conducive to influence.
The teacher should not see in himself any superiority; he should speak
with the utmost kindliness, lowliness and humility, for such speech
exerteth influence and educateth the souls."52

Humility, as the precondition for investigating the truth together with
people of different religions is, from the Baha'i perspective,
indispensable. It also means that we should refrain from making
judgements about the spiritual merit of another person. 'Abdu'1-Bahá

\[51\] Shoghi Effendi, The World Order of Baha'u'llah, 1955 edition, p. 7.

stated, "Let us therefore be humble, without prejudices, preferring
others' good to our own! Let us never say, 'I am a believer but he is an
infidel', 'I am near to God', whilst 'he is an outcast'. We can never know
what will be the final judgement! Therefore let us help all who are in
need of any kind of assistance"53

In terms of how we are to treat people, it matters not if someone is a
"believer" or a "non-believer". All must be treated with equal
compassion, friendliness, and respect because this is what the unity of
mankind principle implies. 'Abdu'1-Bahá explains that

"A fundamental teaching of Baha'u'llah is the oneness of the world of
humanity. Addressing mankind, He says, "Ye are all leaves of one tree
and the fruits of one branch." By this it is meant that the world of
humanity is like a tree, the nations or peoples are the different limbs or
branches of that tree, and the individual human creatures are as the fruits
and blossoms thereof. In this way Baha'u'llah expressed the oneness of
humankind, whereas in all religious teachings of the past the human
world has been represented as divided into two parts: one known as the
people of the Book of God, or the pure tree, and the other the people of
infidelity and error, or the evil tree. The former were considered as
belonging to the faithful, and the others to the hosts of the irreligious and
infidel - one part of humanity the recipients of divine mercy, and the
other the object of the wrath of their Creator. Baha'u'llah removed this by
proclaiming the oneness of the world of humanity, and this principle is
specialized in His teachings, for He has submerged all mankind in the
sea of divine generosity."5

How does the above injunction, of making no distinction between the
"believer" and the "non-believer" relate to the opening verse of
Baha'u'llah's "Most Holy Book"? Baha'u'llah states here that, "The first
duty prescribed by God for His servants is the recognition of Him Who
is the Dayspring of His Revelation and the Fountain of His laws, Who
representeth the Godhead in both the Kingdom of His Cause and the
world of creation. Who achieveth this duty hath attained unto all good;
and whoso is deprived thereof hath gone astray, though he be the author

\[53\] 'Abdu'1-Bahá, Paris Talks, pp. 147-8.

\[54\] 'Abdu'1-Bahá, Promulgation of Universal Peace, p. 454.

of every righteous deed."55 This text is sometimes used to justify the
view that Teaching' the Baha'i Faith is more important than being the
"author of every righteous deed". But the passage goes on to state, "It
behoveth everyone who reacheth this most sublime station, this summit
of transcendent glory, to observe every ordinance of Him Who is the
Desire of the world. These twin duties are inseparable. Neither is
acceptable without the other"56. This means that something which is
equally important to the recognition of Baha'u'llah's mission, in fact
"inseparable" from it, is "observing every ordinance of Him".
Baha'u'llah's counsels are first and foremost to do with spiritual
transformation, "O Son of Spirit! My first counsel is this: Possess a pure,
kindly and radiant heart, that thine may be a sovereignty ancient,
imperishable and everlasting"57, and "The most vital duty, in this day, is
to purify your characters, to correct your manners, and improve your
conduct. The beloved of the Merciful must show forth such character and
conduct among His creatures, that the fragrance of their holiness may be
shed upon the whole world, and may quicken the dead, inasmuch as the
purpose of the Manifestation of God and the dawning of the limitless
lights of the Invisible is to educate the souls of men, and refine the
character of every living man. Good character is, verily, the best mantle
for men on the part of God; by this God adorns the temples of His
friends. By My life, the light of good character surpasses the light of the
sun and its effulgence. He who attains thereto is accounted as the essence
of men. Upon this the honour and glory of the world are based and are
dependent. Good character is the means of guiding men to the right path
and the great message."58 Can any Baha'i really claim to have observed
"every ordinance" of Baha'u'llah. How can we really make any
meaningful distinction between the person who has not recognised
Baha'u'llah's message and the Baha'i who has not properly acted upon it?
If we are to be true to Baha'i ideals, we should not make judgements on
the spiritual merit or demerit of someone on the basis of the recognition
or non-recognition of Baha'u'llah. As Baha'is, our primary concern
should be to focus on how well we ourselves are living up to
Baha'u'llah's message.

\[58\] Baha'u'llah, The Pattern of Baha'i Life, A Compilation, p. 31.

A similar passage to the opening verse of Baha'u'llah's Kitáb-i-Aqdás
has already been quoted from the writings of the Báb in the context of
understanding the Baha'i unity of religions principle. The Báb appears to
state, like Baha'u'llah, that the most important duty is for everyone to
recognise the "Manifestation in each Dispensation" (founder of a
religion): "True knowledge... is the knowledge of God, and this is none
other than the recognition of His Manifestation in each Dispensation".
But he then goes on to make it clear that this in no way means that those
of other faiths, of previous "Dispensations", are inferior: "This doth not
mean, however, that one ought not to yield praise unto former
Revelations. On no account is this acceptable, inasmuch as it behooveth
man, upon reaching the age of nineteen, to render thanksgiving for the
day of his conception as an embryo. For had the embryo not existed, how
could he have reached his present state? Likewise had the religion taught
by Adam not existed, this Faith would not have attained its present
stage."59

Underlying all claims to Baha'i uniqueness, are the equally important
principles of the unity of mankind, and the unity of religion. Taken
together, they imply that Baha'is are never to consider themselves to be
intrinsically superior to anyone, or in any way special. They are only
special or unique in terms of their unique mission, which confers upon
them a special responsibility. It is a duty clearly described in their sacred
scriptures. They, through the teachings of Baha'u'llah, must endeavour to
bring about the unity of mankind, which involves creating inter-religious
harmony on a global scale. Baha'is are specially charged with the task of
fulfilling the highest aspirations of all the world's spiritual traditions.
The weight of this responsibility should provide an antidote to the all too
human tendency to feel superior.

Being more humble, in the sense of not stepping beyond one's
experience is an essential prerequisite to carrying out science and often,
secular objections to religion are made with this important principle in
mind. The famous philosopher Bertrand Russell objected to proofs of the
existence of God on the grounds that they go beyond our experience60,
while the famous physicist, Albert Einsten rejected the Christian/Judaic

\[59\] Báb, Selections from the Writings of the Báb, p. 89.

\[60\] B. Russell, 'The existence of God', chapter 13 in the book, Why I am not a Christian,
conception of God, because it was in his view, anthropomorphic, and the
result of people going beyond their experience61. This makes the
necessity for taking a more humble approach in investigating truth all the
more urgent. The Baha'i principle, that religious truth is in part relative,
both in a subjective and progressive sense, provides the framework for a
less dogmatic approach. The objective truths of religion, the absolute
timeless ones, lie beyond reason, and can only be approached at the
mystical level, in an inner spiritual way. On the other hand, the outward
truths of religion are relative to our comprehension of the world and
ourselves, and they, according to Baha'i teachings, change from time to
time and from place to place. The way we understand our "souls" or
"God", or the act of "creation" is obviously dependent on our culture. It
is also irreducibly personal and subjective. Even within the same faith,
believers will differ about the way they understand them. This means
that we should not be dogmatic about the doctrines of our faith, since we
cannot avoid the imprint of cultural and individual subjective bias.

The Baha'i Faith accounts for the relative nature of religious knowledge
in its doctrines. Take for instance the Baha'i concept of God. In the
Baha'i Faith, as in the Abrahamic religions, God is unknowable. So what
is it that we imagine when we think of God? The Raha'i writings give
clear answers to this question. When we think of God, we are actually
thinking of the spiritual qualities of the "Manifestations of God" and of
"our true selves".

The "Manifestations of God" are in Baha'i terminology, the founders of
religions. Baha'u'llah writes that, "These Prophets and chosen Ones of
God are the recipients and revealers of all the unchangeable attributes
and names of God. They are the mirrors that truly and faithfully reflect
the light of God. Whatsoever is applicable to them is in reality applicable
to God, Himself, Who is both the Visible and the Invisible" , and if
"man attains to the knowledge of the Manifestations of God, he will
attain to the knowledge of God"63. 'Abdu'1-Bahá gives the analogy of
God being like the sun, and the Manifestations being like perfect pure
mirrors. While it might be impossible for a terrestrial creature to reach

A. Einstein, Ideas and Opinions, pp. 36-8.

\[62\] Baha'u'llah, Kitáb-i-íqán, p. 142.
'Abdu'1-Bahá, Some Answered Questions, p. 222.

the Sun (God), we can come into contact with it through the reflected
light of a perfect and pure Mirror, the Manifestation of God.

On the other hand, anything we can conceive, must be understandable in
human terms. So even with respect to the Manifestations, we cannot
have objective knowledge of them. In the Baha'i writings, the concept of
God is linked to our spiritual potential, to the spiritual qualities latent
within us. In the context of knowing God, Baha'u'llah states,

"Far, far from Thy glory be what mortal man can confirm of Thee, or
attribute unto thee, or the praise with which he can glorify Thee!
Whatever duty Thou has prescribed unto Thy servants of extolling to the
utmost Thy majesty and glory is but a token of Thy grace unto them, that
they may be enabled to ascend unto the station conferred upon their own
inmost being, the station of the knowledge of their own selves." w

Our praise has in fact very little to do with God and more to do with our
own spiritual progress. The Manifestation helps us unlock our true
potential, of reaching the "knowledge" of our "true selves". This is stated
in many different ways in the Baha'i writings. Sometimes the soul of
man is likened to a mirror which reflects the light of the Manifestation,
"A pure heart is as a mirror; cleanse it with the burnish of love and
severance from all save God, that the true sun may shine within it and
the eternal morning dawn... Whenever the light of Manifestation of the
King of Oneness settleth upon the throne of the heart and soul, His
shining becometh visible in every limb and member"65. In the another
instance, the human heart is likened to the soil of a garden which yields
spiritual fruits when nurtured by the "divine Gardeners" (the founders of
religions), "man is in need of divine education and inspiration, that the
spirit and bounties of God are essential to his development. That is to
say, the teachings of Christ and the Prophets are necessary for his
education and guidance. They are the divine Gardeners Who till the earth
of human hearts and minds. They educate man, uproot the weeds, burn
the thorns and remodel the waste places into gardens and orchards where
fruitful trees grow."66 To know God, is, according to the Baha'i writings,

128            THE SINGAPORE BAHA' I STUDIES REVIEW

the reason why we exist67. The meaning of life is therefore a paradox: we
are called upon to know God but can never do so. But we can develop
spiritually, through the help and influence of the Manifestations of God,
and in doing so, we fulfil our life's purpose.

In sum, human knowledge of God, according to the Baha'i writings, is
irreducibly relative and personal. It is relative to the knowledge of our
true selves, which is deepened through our knowledge of the founders of
religion. There is no objective way to understand God. To speak of God
in an objective way would be to step beyond our experience. A strong
sense of humility is needed to prevent us from thinking we could ever
know God in objective terms.

What of the descriptions of God as Creator, is that an objective attribute?
According to the Baha'i Faith, all attributes of God are subject to our
limited human comprehension. It is clear that creation myths differ from
culture to culture, but what about the act of creation itself? In the
Abrahamic religions, God is always related to the act of creation, but in
Buddhism, associating God with an act of creation is apparently a
mistaken doctrine. Does this not indicate that even God as Creator is a
relative notion, which changes with time and is different from place to
place? In fact, in the Baha'i writings, the act of creation is a continual
process where the universe is being "renewed and regenerated" by the
"Word of God", "Every thing must needs have an origin and every
building a builder. Verily, the Word of God is the cause which hath
preceded the contingent world - a world which is adorned with the
splendours of the Ancient of Days, yet is being renewed and regenerated
at all times"68. The act of creation is inseparable from the Word of God,
but are we capable of knowing the difference between God and the Word
of God? The Word of God, according to the Baha'i writings, is on
another realm of existence, a higher plane which exists outside space and
time, but nevertheless, it is not God. According to the Baha'i writings, it
is the Word of God which is periodically incarnate in human form, and
not God. It appears to us in the form of the Manifestations of God69. The
important point here is that there is an intermediary world between us

\[67\] Baha'ullah, Gleanings, p. 65.

\[68\] Baha'ullah, Writings of Baha'u'llah, p. 241.

\[69\] Baha'ullah, Gleanings, p. 47.

and God, and it represents the source of all attributes of God for us,
including that of Creator.

We are not capable of knowing whether the universe was created by
God, or the Word of God, or of understanding the difference between the
two. For an ant, an artificially created plastic drinking cup and the
natural soil of a garden are indistinguishable. The ant is simply not
capable of making any meaningful distinction between the two.
Likewise, we can speak of a Creator, but we must not be dogmatic about
it since at the end of the day, it is a relative human concept, and the
world of God lies far beyond what we can conceive. A more modest
goal, is to translate some of the teachings of our faith into deeds, and
then, in our own personal way, we can begin to know our true selves and
develop spiritually. This, according to Baha'i teachings, as I understand
them, is knowledge of God.

Because there can never be any objective knowledge of God, a strong
sense of humility in our interaction with people of different religions is
needed, and for that matter, with people of the same faith. For Baha'is,
doctrinal issues must never become a source of dispute. Our
understanding of religious doctrines will always be inherently subjective,
and tolerance of this diversity is essential for religion in the modern
world. Adherence to objective religious truths, to formal doctrines,
whether they appear in a common declaration of principles or creed, is
no longer adequate. Religious beliefs today must necessarily be more
personal, more diverse, and more humble. The touchstone to assess the
validity of various religious doctrines is to examine their moral outcome.
Have they helped us to be of better service to others? Have they helped
us unlock our true potential? What in other words, are their moral fruits?
A religious outlook of this kind, more modest, more personal, is also
compatible with modern science.

Another area where our spiritual diversity needs to be recognised, is with
respect to how we proclaim and teach our faith. Because our faith is
inherently personal, we all contribute to it in our different ways. There
should never be any pressure on any individual believer to take part in
organised campaigns. Organised campaigns, while inspiring for some,
will inevitably not appeal to others. More and more people, in the spirit
of thinking for themselves, prefer to take their own initiatives.

If one surveys the Baha'i writings, noting all places where Baha'is are
exhorted to teach the Baha'i Faith, it becomes apparent that its success is
conditional upon living the Baha'i life. Living the Baha'i life, is the
highest and most effective means of spreading the Baha'i message. It is
best spread through deeds, and only secondly by words. A sample of the
Baha'i writings on this subject is given below:

"God hath prescribed unto every one the duty of teaching His Cause.
Whoever ariseth to discharge this duty, must needs, ere he proclaimeth
His Message, adorn himself with the ornament of an upright and
praiseworthy character, so that his words may attract the hearts of such
as are receptive to his call. Without it, he can never hope to influence his
hearers."70

"Whoso ariseth among you to teach the Cause of his Lord, let him,
before all else, teach his own self, that his speech may attract the hearts
of them that hear him. Unless he teacheth his own self, the words of his
mouth will not influence the heart of the seeker. Take heed, O people,
lest ye be of them that give good counsel to others but forget to follow it
themselves."71

"Love ye all religions and all races with a love that is true and sincere
and show that love through deeds and not through the tongue; for the
latter hath no importance, as the majority of men are, in speech, well-
wishers, while action is the best."72

"As to the fundamentals of teaching the Faith: know thou that delivering
the Message can be accomplished only through goodly deeds and
spiritual attributes, an utterance that is crystal clear and the happiness
reflected from the face of that one who is expounding the Teachings. It
is essential that the deeds of the teacher should attest the truth of his
words. Such is the state of whoso doth spread abroad the sweet savours
of God and the quality of him who is sincere in his faith."73

"Not by the force of numbers, not by the mere exposition of a set of new
and noble principles, not by an organized campaign of teaching - no
matter how worldwide and elaborate in its character - not even by the
staunchness of our faith or the exaltation of our enthusiasm, can we
ultimately hope to vindicate in the eyes of a critical and sceptical age the
supreme claim of the Abhá Revelation. One thing and only one thing
will unfailingly and alone secure the undoubted triumph of this sacred
Cause, namely, the extent to which our own inner life and private
character mirror forth in their manifold aspects the splendor of those
eternal principles proclaimed by Baha'u'llah."74

This last passage suggests that there can be no substitute for living the
Baha'i life. In the "eyes of a critical and sceptical age", the degree to
which Baha'is live up to their ideals will determine their success in the
missionary field. At present, in the author's experience, there is a
tendency to give priority to gaining new converts (declarations in Baha'i
terminology), to organise teaching campaigns, and to engage in all
manner of publicity orientated activities. These kinds of activities
typically promote the principles of the Baha'i Faith, concentrating on its
external aspects. As we look toward the future, more will be required of
an inner spiritual kind. Are Baha'is themselves shining examples of their
own principles? Are they known to be independent investigators of
truth? Do they rely upon second-hand accounts of the Baha'i writings, or
do they make their own independent investigations of them? Are they
known for their humility? Are they known for their service to mankind?
Are they known for bringing religious harmony? When they announce
the uniqueness of Baha'u'llah's claim, do Baha'is in the same breath
declare the unity of mankind and unity of religious principles? Is the
Baha'i community a living example of the fellowship and unity it
advocates for the world? These are the kinds of questions Baha'is should
be continually asking themselves, and in the author's experience, they
have only just begun to realise it.

Consider the following analogy, given in the context of describing the
interfaith challenge to Christians:

"We have been like a company of people marching down a long valley,
singing our own-songs, developing over the centuries our own stories

\[74\] Shoghi Effendi, Guidance for Today and Tomorow, p. 194.
132            THE SINGAPORE BAH A' I STUDIES REVIEW

and slogans, unaware that over the hill there is another valley, with
another great company of people marching in the same direction, but
with their own language and songs and stories and ideas; and over
another hill yet another marching group - each ignorant of the existence
of the others. But then one day they all come out onto the same plain, the
plain created by modern global communications, and see each other and
wonder what to make of each other.. ."75

Where would we locate the Baha'i Faith and its followers in this
analogy? Since Baha'is are for the most part, mainly converts, they are
like everybody else, arriving on the modern interfaith "plain" and like
everybody else, they are in the process of discovering the world's rich
variety of spiritual traditions. They do not have however, as yet, a
religious tradition in the same sense as the other groups. They do not
have an established "singing tradition". In my opinion, Baha'is are like
people who have found the sheet music of a new song on the plain which
is promised to be the "universal song". The problem is that although they
have found the music, they, like everyone else, are not very good singers,
and are gradually realizing that it is not good enough to have the written
music, they also need to train at singing. Not only this, they are
beginning to realize the need to learn the existing songs, so that they are
better prepared to sing the "universal song". Just like everyone else, they
are becoming aware of more songs. Their special task is to help each
group remember its own song. They must do this largely by example,
that is, they must themselves concentrate on becoming good musicians
who can sing the original version of all the old songs. The new
"universal song" will require the harmonies and rhythms of all the old
songs, and the music of all songs will never be lost. The "universal song"
is not a syncretic mix of all previous songs, it contains elements from
them, it harmonizes with them, and yet at the same time, it is something
completely distinct, it has its own melody and character, and is
something that all the people on the modern "plain" can participate in.
This analogy is honest to the great truth claim of Baha'u'llah, and yet at
the same time, stresses the need for individual Baha'is to be humble, to
become living examples of their own principles. It highlights the need
for Baha'is to work in fellowship with people of other religions, learning
from them, and eventually assisting them in realizing their highest
aspirations.

\[75\] J. Hick, God Has Many Names, p. 41.

It is interesting to note that, in the context of spreading the Baha'i
teachings, 'Abdu'1-Bahá also uses the "song" metaphor:

"... the call to the world of unity... may be raised; the flag of the
oneness of the world of humanity be unfurled, the melody of universal
peace may reach the ears of the East and West... the song of the love of
God may exhilarate and rejoice all the nations and peoples... exert ye
with heart and soul, so that association, love, unity and agreement be
obtained between the hearts, all the aims may be merged into one aim,
all songs become one song and, the power of the Holy Spirit may
become so overwhelmingly victorious as to overcome all the forces of
the world of nature."76

3\.         The Living Example of' Abdu'1-Bahá

Although the Baha'i Faith is relatively young in comparison to other
world faiths, it has already established an interfaith history. At the centre
of this contribution is the living example of 'AbduT-Bahá, who,
particularly through his Western tours between the years 1911 to 1913,
demonstrated how the Baha'i principles on inter-religious harmony can
be translated into action. Over a period of several years, throughout
numerous centres in both Europe and America, 'AbduT-Bahá spoke of
religious unity from Church pulpits, Synagogues, and Mosques. His
public and private addresses attracted the interest of many leading
clergymen. His two visits to Britain for instance, received a day by day
account in the London based Christian Commonwealth journal. The
spirit of fellowship and the deep accord that 'AbduT-Bahá struck with
leading Western clergymen is evident in the following two extracts from
the Christian Commonwealth journal while he was in London:

This newspaper article records a dialogue between the Reverend R. J.
Campbell, Minister of the City Temple Church in London. The editor of
the Christian Commonwealth journal, Albert Dawson, recorded the
dialogue and published it along with other articles which featured
'AbduT-Bahá and the Baha'i Faith in the 13th September edition 1911.

\[76\] 'Abdu'1-Bahá, Tablets of the Divine Plan, pp. 78-9.

Three days before this, 'Abdu'1-Bahá gave his first Western public
address in the City Temple Church.

We must follow his example.
R. J. C: What is distinctive of the Baháí movement as
compared with the faith out of which it came?
A. B.: The Báb foretold the coming of One after him who would
address the whole world. We are followers of that One -
Baháulláh. When he manifested himself, some of the followers
of the Báb did not receive him. Those are called Babis; the
disciples of Baháulláh are Baháís. The Báb came as a reformer
of Islam, and foretold the coming of a greater one in his
footsteps. Instead of confining his revelation to the Moslem
world, Baháulláh gave it forth to all mankind. The narrow-
minded ones, even those who meant well, could not understand
so broad a movement, they were not strong enough to follow
Baha'ullah; they said, :He is speaking a language we cannot
understand". Therefore they are called Babis.
R. J. C: What a close parallel to primitive Christianity! The
Judaising portion did not wish the Gospel to go any further.
A. B.: It has come about, by their narrow-mindedness, and
exclusiveness, that the Babis are now opposed to all the other
religions; they want to keep rigidly to the teaching of the Báb,
and convert everybody to it. The Baháís recognise the truth in
all religions. They come from the same root, but there is now
that difference.
R. J. C: A difference of attitude
A.B.: Their conduct is absolutely different.
R. J. C: How many Babis are there?
A. B.: Very few
Interpreter: Perhaps 200 or 300 in Persia.
R. J. C: It is suggested that there are three million Baháís.
Interpreter: There are no statistics....
R. J. C. (to 'Abdu'1-Bahá): I should like you to visit the City
Temple
A. B.: I should like to come. I know that the City Temple is a
centre of progress in the religious world, and seeks to promote a
universal understanding. As you have been a promoter of unity
in the Christian world I hope you will strive to bring about unity
in the whole world. A man first wants unity in his own family,
and then as his intelligence expands he wants unity in his
village, then in his town, then in his country, then in the world.
I hope you will strive to unify the whole world.
R. J. C: We are doing what we can. We believe that religions are
many, but Religion is one.
A. B.: The principle of religion is one, as God is one.
A Lady: Mr Campbell's reform movement in Christianity is
helping the world of Islam. The attitude of the New Theology is
one Moslems can understand; they cannot understand the
divisions of Christianity.

> R. J.C.: I have some evidence of that.
> When Mr Campbell left it was with the understanding that there
> would be a further meeting.

Another Christian Commonwealth newspaper article appeared a week
later, describing the meeting of 'Abdu'1-Bahá with another London
Church Minister. This time, 'Abdu'1-Bahá was invited by Archdeacon
Wilberforce to address his congregation at St John's Church.

Crossing Religious Boundaries                            \ 37

Full of expectation, the congregation waited when the
Archdeacon for a brief moment left the church. Divested of his
white surplice, he returned with 'Abdu'1-Bahá. All eyes were
fixed on the leader of the Baháí movement. In his customary
Eastern robe and head-dress, walking hand in hand with a
leader of the West, it did indeed seem that the veil was
vanishing.

Down the aisle they passed to the bishop's chair, which had
been placed in front of the altar for 'Abdu'1-Bahá. Standing at
the lectern, Archdeacon Wilberforce, introduced the "wonderful"
visitor. He told of his life in prison, of his sufferings and bravery,
of his self-sacrifice, of his clear and shining faith. He voiced his
own belief that religion is one, as God is love.

Then Abdu'1-Bahá rose. Speaking very clearly, with wonderful
intonations in his voice and using his hand freely, it seemed to
those who listened almost as if they grasped his meaning,
though he spoke in Persian. When he had finished, Archdeacon
Wilberforce read the translation of his address. His theme was
the Character of the Manifestations of God. He said God the
Infinite could not be comprehended of man; that whatever man
understands of God is born of his imagination. For illustration
he pointed to the mineral, which does not comprehend the
vegetable, as the vegetable cannot understand the animal. So
the animal cannot reach the intelligence of humanity. Neither,
said he, is it possible for man, a created being, to understand
the Almighty Creator. Nevertheless, the perfections and
qualifications of God are seen in every created being and in the
most perfect beings in the most perfect manner. In the
manifestations of God, 'Abdu'1-Bahá likened these qualities to
the rays of the sun focussed in a mirror. If we claim that the
sun is seen in the mirror, we do not mean that the whole sun
has descended from the holy heights of heaven and entered into
the mirror, that is impossible. The Eternal Nature is seen in the
manifestations, and its light and splendour are visible in
extreme glory. Therefore men have always been taught and led
by the prophets of God. The prophets of God are the mediators
of God. All the prophets and messengers have come from one
Holy Spirit and bear the message of God, suited to the age in
which they appear.

It is the One Light in them, and they are one with each other.
But the eternal does not become the phenomenal, netiher can
the phenomenal become eternal. St. Paul, the great apostle said,
"We all, with open face, beholding as in a mirror the glory of
God, are changed into the same image, from glory to glory."

> Then, raising his hands, 'Abdu'1-Bahá prayed: "O God, the
> Forgiver! O Heavenly Educator! This assembly is adorned with
> the mention of thy holy name. Thy children turn their face
> towards thy kingdom. Hearts are made happy and souls are
> comforted. Merciful God! Cause us to repent of our
> shortcomings! Accept us in thy heavenly kingdom and give unto
> us an abode where there shall be no error. Give us peace. Give
> us knowledge, and open unto us the gates of thy heaven.
> 'Thou art the Giver of all! Thou art the Forgiver! Thou art the
> Merciful!"
> The final note of a real chord of harmony was struck when
> Archdeacon Wilberforce asked that 'Abdu'1-Bahá would
> pronounce the Benediction. "I think we should take it kneeling,"
> he said.

Who shall say that that the veil is not vanishing?

'AbduT-Baha's interfaith contribution, has as yet, not been fully
documented. A considerable amount of literature was generated through
'AbduT-Baha's direct and indirect contacts with theologians, Church
Ministers, and Christians from a variety of different backgrounds. Apart
from articles in newspapers and journals, some Christian scholars were
inspired to write books that were based upon their meetings with
'Abdu'1-Bahá. A book entitled, "The Reconciliation of Races and
Religions" by the Oxford Bible scholar, Thomas Kelly Cheyne was such
a book. Cheyne entitled his chapter on 'Abdu'1-Bahá as "The
Ambassador of Peace". The Christian Commonwealth journal was
considered to be a reform movement within Christianity, calling for a
greater degree of openness and recognition for the truth in other
religions. The subtitle of the journal which appeared on the front page of
every issue read, "The organ of the Progressive Movement in Religion
and Social Ethics". Clearly from the above citations, Rev. R. J. Campbell
and Archbishop Wilberforce were making contacts with religious figures
in the East. Just how movements like these might have influenced the
modern interfaith movement is a fascinating question, and one for future
research. The Englishman, Sir Francis Younghusband, founder of the
World Congress of Faiths organisation, certainly knew of the Baha'i
Faith. He had great admiration for the Báb and frequently attended
Baha'i meetings77. At the time of 'AbduT-Baha's visit to London,

D. Hofman, George Townshend, p. 123.

Younghusband, living in England, was around 50 years old, and was
beginning to write several books that described his religious views78.

4\.         Modern Religious Pluralism

Modern interfaith dialogue has its critics as well as its supporters.
Harvey Cox, a Christian speaker at the 2nd Parliament of the World's
Religions held in Chicago 1993, spoke of the presence of an
"antidialogical wing" in Christianity, Hinduism, Buddhism and Islam.
Harvey Cox acknowledged his having "sharp-edged and sometimes
unpleasant conversations" with his fellow Christians, who were opposed
to interfaith dialogue79. At the first Parliament of the World's Religions,
John Henry Barrows, one of Chicago's most liberal clergymen who
promoted the event, claimed later that he had hoped leaders of world
religions would be convinced of the superiority of Christianity. Most
Protestant evangelicals agreed with the response of the Archbishop of
Canterbury, that to participate was to presuppose the equality of
religions, but Salvation is in Christ alone, they protested. The Christians
who gave their support to the conference lay outside mainstream
American Protestant Churches.

Seyyed Hossein Nasr, the Muslim speaker at the 2nd Parliament of the
World's Religion conference cited several difficulties for modern
interfaith dialogue. The first is that it is dominated by the West, and so in
many ways reflects the religious concerns of western educated people,
rather than being representative of the world's religions80. The agenda of
interfaith dialogue, according to Nasr, is thus dominated by modernity
and reactions to it, "the presence of the modern world is twofold: One is
through the destruction of religion and the other through the
foreshortening of its vision"81. Nasr claims that modernity "denies the
significance of religious categories" and that this limits the effectiveness
of inter-religious dialogue, since it is primarily, a modern western debate
about religion. Under the pressure of a secular threat, religious
communities, according to Nasr are becoming more intolerant. This is

Marcus Braybrooke, A Wider Vision, pp. 28-9.

\[81\] ibid., p. 162.

clearly discernible in some forms of fundamentalism. Nasr gives the
example of the present young generation of students at Muslim
universities, "when you look at those young students at an Islamic
university who do all the shouting and who think they are the most pious
and devout of all Muslims, many of them are the ones who, in contrast to
their grandfathers, have much less interest and much less affinity for
friendship with people of other religions"82

Another difficulty raised by Nasr is the element of Christian mission: "so
many Western scholars have tried to present Christianity, let us say, to
the Islamic world or the Hindu world, in their capacity as missionaries.
In the majority of cases (there are always exceptions) their goal has been
to bring about an understanding of Christianity to Islam or to Hinduism
or to Buddhism not so much with the purpose of explaining but of
seeking to convert them to their own point of view"83. Other Muslims
have leveled the same objections at Christian interfaith dialogue.
Mahmoud Ayoub commenting on the Pope's recent interfaith dialogue
initiatives, questioned whether this was dialogue or mission. He cites
statements of the Pope to conclude that the dialogue recently advocated
by the Catholic Church is "simply an instrument of mission"84. The Pope
himself declared, "Inter-religious dialogue, is a part of the Church's
evangelizing mission"85'86. But this kind of intention is precisely what is
unacceptable to many non-Christians partners in the interfaith debate. In

A recent statement delivered by the Pope during the Wednesday's General Audience:
"Dear Brothers and Sisters, We are reflecting today on how to witness to God the Father
in our relations with the followers of other religions. Sacred Scripture teaches us that
there is one God who desires the salvation of all. This truth is the foundation for inter-
religious dialogue. Dialogue does not lead to the abandonment of proclamation but is a
part of the Church's evangelizing mission. Discussion and exchange should lead to
deeper knowledge of one another's convictions, and to eventual agreement on
fundamental values. While recognizing that the world's religions "often reflect a ray of
that Truth which enlightens all men", the Church is also aware of her duty to proclaim
Christ, "'the way, and the truth, and the life' (John 14:6), in whom men find the fullness
of religious life and in whom God has reconciled all things to himself (Nostra Aetate,
2). May the Great Jubilee be an opportunity for the followers of all religions to grow in
esteem and love for one another, through a dialogue which will truly be a saving
encounter." Wednesday, 21 st April, 1999.

the 1986 Assisi conference, where by special invitation of Pope John
Paul II, religious leaders from different faiths came together to pray for
world peace, the Pope in his closing address expressed his feelings of
being a "brother and friend" to all those present but in the same breath
stated, "I profess here anew my conviction shared by all Christians, that
in Jesus Christ, as Saviour of all, true peace is to be found"87.

From the very beginning of the modern interfaith movement, missionary
work was thought to be incompatible with it, and this has been the basis
of much opposition ever since. Christian opposition has often called for
more missionary involvement, while Muslim and other non-Christian
groups have sought to reduce it.

The secular threat which some believe to be inherent in the modern
interfaith movement has several aspects to it. The word "secular" has
primarily been defined in a Western context and it is generally associated
with the rejection of something religious. It would be misleading to
suggest Western secular societies have rejected religion. The Western
crisis of religion is more accurately a crisis of organized religion, and not
about whether people have become irreligious. Hans Kung, the famous
Catholic thelogian argues that religion today has successfully resisted the
opposition of various secular movements that were popular at the
beginning of this century: "If we look at East Germany, at Poland, at
Czechoslovakia or the Soviet Union, at South Africa, Iran, the
Philippines or Korea, and finally also at North and South America, today
the cultural historical thesis of the end or the dying out of religion seems
clearly to have been falsified. Neither atheistic humanism (a la
Feuerbach) nor atheistic Socialism (a la Marx) nor atheistic science (a la
Freud or Russell) has succeeded in replacing religion. On the contrary,
the more the ideologies, these modern secular convictions of faith, lost
credibility, the more the religions, old and new convictions of faith,
gained impetus. Nowadays people talk of a post-ideological era but
hardly still of a post-religious era.88. He cites the 1987 Gallup Poll in the
USA, where 94% believed in God, the 1989 Allenbach Poll in West
Germany where 70% believed in God and the 1990 Sunday Times and
Sunday Telegraph in the UK in which 75% believed in a "supernatural

being". Hans Kung goes on to conclude that the crisis of religion in the
West is one relating to organized religion, "It is Institutionalized religion,
the Christian churches, which at least in Europe are in crisis because of
fossilization and isolation (in the case of the Catholic Church) or
exhaustion and lack of profile (in the case of the Protestant Church),
which they have brought down on themselves. But given the present
diffusion of religion and the zeal for conversion among fundamentalists
or alternative communities there can be no question of a dying out of
religion generally" .

While the majority of people in the "secular West" continue to believe in
God, very few still regularly go to Church. Some estimate that less than
ten percent in Europe regularly attend church, and the reasons given for
this is that religious thought is out of date, and not relevant to today's
needs90.
Western scholars of religion have identified three broad categories of
how people of different faiths see one another: the exclusivists,
inclusivists, and pluralists. Although these categories were first made in
the context of Christianity's relationship to the other world's religions,
they were later generalised to apply to all inter-faith relationships.

The first category of people, the exclusivists, are most popularly
associated with traditional religion. Their attitude of mind is exemplified
for instance, in the late medieval Catholic dogma, extra ecclesiam nulla
salus, 'outside the church, no salvation'. It is also epitomised in the
pronouncement of Pope Boniface VIII in 1302:

\[89\] ibid

\[90\] J.M. Templeton states: "Religious thought should progress along with the social,
political, economic, and scientific environment, or people will grow dissatisfied and
abandon belief systems that appear to have little basis in reality. A New York Times study
covering 1957 to 1970 chronicled Americans' replies to the question, 'At the present
time do you think religion as a whole is increasing its influence in American life or
losing its influence?' The percentage who thought religion was indeed losing influence
increased from fourteen percent in 1957 to seventy-five percent in 1970. Reasons given
for this decline in religious influence included statements that religion was 'outdated' or
'not relevant in today's world'. The report stated that these results revealed one of the
most dramatic reversals in opinion in the history of polling. The Gallup organization has
found even greater religious decline in Europe. Every nation in Europe has lower church
attendance percentage-wise than in America. In some nations still considered heavily
Christian, church attendance by adults now averages below ten percent." (The Humble
Approach, p. 66)

"We are required by faith to believe and hold that there is one holy,
catholic and apostolic church; we firmly believe it and unreservedly
profess it; outside it there is neither salvation nor remission of
sins...Further, we declare, say, define and proclaim that to submit to the
Roman Pontiff is, for every human creature, an utter necessity of
salvation"91.

There has been some discussion as to whether this statement was really
directed at other religions, or whether it was essentially a Christian inter-
denominational one9 . But the inter-religious intolerance of the period in
which it was written is unmistakable. The medieval period was a time of
Holy Wars between Christianity and Islam. Religious polemics were
inseparable from the clash cultures. Religious exclusivism was an
essential ingredient to cultural exclusivism. For Christian Europe,
religious superiority remained an underlying ethic for cultural
exclusivism right up to the end of the Western Colonial period earlier
this century. Even now, there are vestiges of it that still linger on.

For the rest of the world, religious exclusivism is an integral part of
traditional culture. It is apparent in the widespread tendency to equate
religious beliefs with cultural identity. For example, until recently, the
faith of most Muslims was derived from their country of origin. There
seems to be little choice in the matter. Even if say a Pakistani child is
brought up in Britain, he or she is often deemed to be a Muslim
irrespective of what his or her religious views are. This fact was
poignantly illustrated in the Salam Rushdie affair. Religion by culture,
as opposed to religion by choice is the traditional religious approach, not
all modern Muslims agree with it today. Religion by choice, and not by
place of birth, is a relatively recent modern practice.

Religious exclusivism is also popularly associated with religious
fundamentalism. The term "fundamentalism" originally arose out of
Christian reform movements in America around the turn of the 20*
century, but is now inseparable from a religious response to secularism.
It would be incorrect to reduce fundamentalism to religious exclusivism
or to describe it as anti-scientific. Fundamentalists see themselves as
holding beliefs that are more truthful to their religious tradition than

other denominations. This often involves a more literal interpretation of
their scripture than other members of their faith, which leads on some
occasions to a conflict with modern science, as in the Creationists vs
Evolutionists controversy. In other instances, a more literal approach to
interpreting scripture encourages religious exclusivism. For instance,
some Christian fundamentalists justify their religious exclusivism by
quoting Biblical texts such as, "I am the way, the truth and the life; no
man cometh unto the Father, but by me" (John 14:6). But it is important
to remember that fundamentalism is first and foremost an intra-religious
phenomenon, rather than an inter-religious one. Fundamentalists,
particularly Christian ones, have historically defined their beliefs
primarily in relation to how they differ from members of their own faith.
Of course, as people of different faiths come into greater contact with
each other, fundamentalists are beginning to reformulate their doctrines
taking people of other religions into account. It cannot however, be
assumed in .advance that their outlook will be exclusivist.

The inclusivists give more respect to other faiths than the exclusivists.
They acknowledge that there are valuable aspects to other religions, but
recognise them ultimately to be indirect manifestations of the revelation
of their own faith. The Jesuit theologian Karl Rahner (1904-84),
considered non-Christians to be "anonymous Christians"93. A similar
position is articulated by the present Catholic Church. In a statement
prepared in 1965 called Nostra Atate, the Catholic Church set out its
relationship to the world's major religions in the following way:

"The Catholic Church rejects nothing that is true and holy in these
religions. She regards with sincere reverence those ways of conduct and
of life, those precepts and teachings which, though differing in many
aspects from the ones she holds and sets forth, nonetheless often reflect a
ray of that Truth which enlightens all men. Indeed, she proclaims, and
ever must proclaim Christ "the way, the truth, and the life" (John 14: 6),
in whom men may find the fullness of religious life, in whom God has
reconciled all things to Himself. The Church, therefore, exhorts her sons,
that through dialogue and collaboration with the followers of other
religions, carried out with prudence and love and in witness to the
Christian faith and life, they recognize, preserve and promote the good

\[93\] Karl Rahner, 'Christianity and the Non-Christian Religions', in Christianity and Other
Religions selected readings, edited by J. Hick and Brian Hebblethwaite, pp. 56, 61.

things, spiritual and moral, as well as the socio-cultural values found
among these men" 9 4

Here the Catholic church only recognizes the validity of other religions
in terms of them containing a "ray of truth" which is much more fully
present in Christ. In 1998, the present Pope cites the first Encyclical
Letter of his pontificate which mentions the "seeds of the Word" being
"present and active in various religions"95. In the same letter he states, "It
must first be kept in mind that every quest of the human spirit for truth
and goodness, and in the last analysis for Gody is inspired by the Holy
Spirit". So either by being "seeds of the Word", or as a ray of the Holy
Spirit, some degree of good is allowed for in other religions. However,
they cannot be compared to the "fullness of religious life" in Christ. This
approach exemplifies religious inclusivism. Not wanting to reject other
religions outright, inclusivists allow other religions to contain a small
measure of their own truth.

The third category of responses to the modern multi-religious challenge,
pluralism, puts all religions on an equal footing. Each is described to be
different, but complimentary in character. Each contains valid lessons for
the others, and there is none that is intrinsically superior to the rest. Brian
Hebblethwaite, a Christian pluralist, describes pluralism in the following
way:

"Christians must cease to think of their faith as bearing witness to Goďs
final and absolute self-revelation to man. Rather, they must learn to
recognize their experiences of God in Christ to be but one of many
different saving encounters with the divine which have been given to

different historical and cultural segments of mankind" .

The pluralist believes his or her religious tradition is one amongst many.
Each religious tradition is considered to be equally valuable to mankind
as a whole.

Sherwin and H. Kasimow, pp. 3-4.

Another spokesman for religious pluralism, perhaps the most famous, is
the Protestant theologian/philosopher, John Hick. He presented the
challenge of pluralism in terms of a metaphor borrowed from the history
of modem science. Just as the earth was believed to lie at the centre of
the universe, with all the planets and the sun revolving around it, so
traditional religion sees itself at the centre of a "universe of faiths". But
just as Copernicus realized that it was the sun which lay at the centre, not
the earth, so too must all religions make a Copemican like revolution in
their spiritual universe. The religious Copemican challenge is to place
God at the centre of the universe of Faiths. John Hick puts it in the
following way

"Copernicus realized that it is the sun, and not the earth, that is at the
center, and that all the heavenly bodies, including our own earth, revolve
around it. And we have to realize that the universe of faiths centers upon
God, and not upon Christianity or upon any other religion. He is the sun,
the orginiative source of light and life, whom all the religions reflect in
their different ways"97.

The religious Copemican metaphor has a democratic appeal about it. It
has obvious attractions to a multi-faith society and so seems better
adapted to the future of mankind than exclusivism or inclusivism. It has
however, aroused considerable opposition. The Christian theologian,
Martin Forward, states, "the alluring call by pluralists for a theocentric
rather than christocentric theology of religions could turn out to be a
siren call to destruction. It espouses a simplistic, partial and
reductionistic view of Jesus"98. Elsewhere, he states, "If Hick's and other
pluralist's interpretation of Jesus' importance to the world of the third
millenium were to triumph in Christianity, Jesus would in practice
become a rather marginal figure"99. The fear here, is that a theocentric
centre will displace the position of Christ, who according to Martin
Forward, must always lie at the centre of a Christian's faith.

Opposition to religious pluralism may in some instances, be linked to its
similarity to postmodernist pluralism. The postmodernist thesis in
relation to different cultures, not only respects their differences but also

\[97\] J. Hick, God Has Many Names, pp. 70-1.

\[99\] ibid, p. 164.

states them to be incompatible, that is, it rejects any common ground
between them. The positive aspect of this is that there is no basis for
superiority or inferiority. As a social philosophy, cultural pluralism has
obvious merits, and engenders an ethic of equal respect for all races. But
it has limitations. By making all values relative, there is the danger of
arriving at no values at all. If all values are equally valid, there is nothing
to recommend any of them. Likewise, the postmodernist insistence that
all truths' claims are relative, means by the same token, that the
postmodernist thesis itself is one amongst many equally valid ones, there
being no objective basis to choose between them. These types of
limitations to pluralism as a philosophy are well known, and it might
appear that the same kind of limitations exist for religious pluralism. If
all religions are ultimately relative, in the subjective and cultural sense,
there is no objective basis to recommend any one of them. They are
equally invalid as they are valid. If all religious people become pluralists,
they will, by definition, no longer be committed to any one faith.
Pluralism taken a little further, undermines belief in religion as a whole.

But religious pluralism is different from postmodern pluralism. In Hick's
Copernican analogy, each religion is not left without a centre, God is
placed at the centre. Religious pluralism entails a unity in diversity of
truths, where the common centre to each religion, according to Hick, is
God. Now just what we mean by God is of course debatable. Buddhism
does not seem to attach the same importance to it as say the Abrahamic
religions. Hick suggests that all religions in one way or another entail
belief in what he refers to as "the Real" or "the Eternal One"100. But the
main point here is that religious pluralism is different to postmodern
pluralism in that it recommends something. Just because all religions are
equally valid does not make them all completely relative. There are of
course many subjective elements to them, but religious pluralism also
acknowledges common elements to all religions, that is, objective ones.
Articulating their objective side is not a straightforward task, but
nevertheless, it is important to recognise that this side to religious
pluralism exists.

Hick's proposal of putting the Real at the centre of all religious
experience is a separate proposition from the principle of pluralism. It is
not clear if "The Real" provides the common ground on which people of

\[100\] J. Hick, A Christian Theology of Religions, pp. 57-81.

different faiths can unite. But the spirit of Hick's proposition calls for a
reorientation of egocentric values, and that is the part with which most
people would agree. Seyyed Nasr, in the same spirit, prefers to put the
"perennial religion" at the centre of all religions. He defines it as the
"inner reality" of each faith:

"One can speak of religo perennis, the perennial religion, lying at the
heart of all authentic religions... this philosophy, or rather metaphysics,
is based on the fundamental principle that the only point of accord
between various sacred forms is precisely the inward esoteric dimension;
that is, the forms of a religion are not exhausted by their outward
limitations, and there is always an inner reality of which the outward is
the external form. The outward exists by virtue of the fact that it has
issued from the in ward... if we limit religions and their truth claims
simply to their externality, we will never be able to reach the inner
dimension where alone unity is to be found"101.

Nasr's "perennial religion" has a close relationship to the mystical side
of all religions. Whether it is Hick's Real or Nasr's perennial religion,
the important point here is that they both believe in an eternal and
universal part to religion. They both describe the differences between
religions to have come about from the finite nature of human knowledge,
which changes from time to time and from place to place. Nasr refers to
"crystallizations in the world of time and space", on the "human
plane"102. Hick speaks of the "diversity of forms" in religions coming
from the principle (articulated by the theologian St Thomas Aquinas)
that "Things known are in the knower according to the mode of the
knower"103. He also cites the philosopher Kant's well-known distinction
between the "noumenal world" or "Real in-itself, as opposed to the
finite human conception of it104.

The inner mystical side to religions being at the common centre of the
world's spiritual traditions is also very close to the Baha'i approach. But
how would Baha'is respond to Hick's proposal of putting the Real at the

centre of their faith instead of Baha'u'llah? Would their response not be
similar to Christians like Martin Forward who reject it?

A Baha'i response to Hick may be made along the following lines. Even
though the idea of an unknowable being, the Real, is present in most
religious traditions of the world, the Real's spiritual attributes are known
to us through the founders of religions. The Christian God for instance, is
known through the person of Christ. So to displace Christ from the
Christian centre would also be tantamount to displacing God from the
centre. We can displace the human, historical transient Christ from the
centre, but not the eternal spiritual Christ. In fact, the common centre has
all the founders of religions in it. The transient parts to all religions,
although still important, will take a secondary role and revolve around
the inner timeless centre. Christians should keep Christ at their centre,
but if it is to be shared by people of other faiths, it must be an inner
Christ, the Logos, the eternal Word of God. Baha'is should put
Baha'u'llah at the centre of their faith, and if it is Baha'u'llah as the
eternal Word of God, faith in Baha'u'llah will lead to faith in the other
founders of religions, and vice-versa. They will all be connected. In this
way can the many names of God, along with the names of various
prophets and sages, find unity in an unnameable centre.

It is important to recognise that interfaith dialogue is not limited to
religious pluralism. Martin Forward, although opposed to religious
pluralism, is committed to interfaith dialogue. Dialogue may involve
clearing up misunderstandings and be a way of making oneself heard.
Certainly, all participants in the dialogue do not have to agree with one
another. Even if all participants were to agree on the fundamental unity
of religions, they may differ about the way they describe it. They can all
still learn from one another. Keith Ward, an influential Christian
philosopher and theologian thinks that the kind of pluralism advocated
by Hick cannot overcome religious differences, and that we have to learn
to live with religious theological and doctrinal differences. He
emphasizes the importance of finding common ground on pluralist
ethics, rather than finding unity in theology or doctrine. He states that "It
is a mark of maturity to be able to disagree in friendship, and that is what
religious believers in the pluralist context of the modern world are going
to have to do"105. Ward lists "seven principles of global pluralism" which

105   Keith Ward, God, Faith and the New Millennium, p. 168.

150         THE SINGAPORE BAHA' f STUDIES REVIEW

include having an attitude of respect, humility, concern for other
people's welfare, search for truth, cooperation, peace etc.

Pluralism, primarily in terms of an ethical attitude of mind, was
articulated in the "Dialogue Decalogue, ground rules for Interreligious,
Inter-ideological dialogue" by Leonard Swidler, editor of the Journal of
Ecumenical Studies. He presents "ten commandments" which are based
upon having respect, humility, honesty, sincerity etc106. Other notable
efforts to found pluralism on adopting the right ethics have been made by
the Catholic theolgians, Hans Kung and Paul Knitter. Kung in the
concluding pages of his book "Global responsibility, in search of a new
world ethic" states:

"In this book it has become clear from beginning to end that a new post-
colonial, post-imperialistic, postmodern world constellation is in the
making, and thus a polycentric world which is being bound ever closer
together by new communication technologies. But at the same time this
polycentric world must be a transcultural and multi-religious world. In
this polycentric, transcultural and multi-religious world ecumenical
dialogue between the world religions takes on quite new importance; for
the sake of its peace this postmodern world needs more than ever the
global religious understanding without which a political understanding
will in the last resort no longer be possible. The slogan of the hour is
therefore, 'We must begin on global religious understanding here and
now!' We must advance inter-religious understanding energetically in
the local, regional, national and international spheres. We must seek
ecumenical understanding with all religious groups and at all levels... we
need a more intensive philosophical and theological dialogue of
theologians and specialists in religion which takes religious plurality
seriously in theological terms, accepts the challenge of the other
religions, and investigates their significance for each person's own
religion...at the same time we need the spiritual dialogue of religious
communities, of monks, nuns and laity, who are silent, meditate and
reflect together and are concerned with a deepening of the spiritual life,
and the questions of a spirituality for our time...Therefore the
programme which guides us and which comes together as one may be
summed up once again in three basic statements: no human life together

Leonard Swidler, 'The Dialogue Decalogue' in A Source Book for the Earth's
Community of Religions", project editor, J. Beversluis, pp. 158-160.

without a world ethic for the nations; no peace among the nations
without peace among the religions; no peace among the religions without
dialogue among the religions"107.

Now Kung's call for pluralism is clearly much more practical than
theological. It is a call to recognise "religious plurality" in the context of
finding ethics for the future peace and security of the world. Kung was
invited by the Council for a Parliament of the World's Religions
(CPWR) to help draft the "Global Ethic" declaration statement. This
statement was signed by many people attending the 2nd Parliament of the
World's Religions conference in 1993108.

The call for "global responsibility" is also the major theme explored by
Paul Knitter. An important contribution made by Knitter is to suggest
how Christian mission should be reevaluated in terms of Christians
serving humanity. The force of his argument lies in the suggestion that
the paramount duty of Christians is first and foremost to bring about the
"Kingdom of God", and not necessarily to win more converts for
Christianity. He suggests that it is "conversion to the Kingdom" which
has priority, and this involves bringing about a more united, just and
peaceful world. He states that, "Such an understanding of mission can be
not only sobering but consoling. A missionary who has no baptisms to
report, but who has helped Hindus, Buddhists, and Christians to live
together lovingly and justly is a successful disciple of Christ; a
missionary who has filled the church with converts without seeking to
change a society that condones dowry deaths or bonded labor is a
failure""109.

Knitter's arguments are directed primarily at Christians, but they also
obviously apply to members of other faiths. He also writes against
Christian exclusiveness. Being faithful to Christ's message does not
necessarily mean that a Christian has to be exclusive. Christians can be
"true" to their spiritual experience by affirming the transforming of
Christ in their own lives, but they step beyond their experience when
they try to make it exclusive. They can only properly affirm the truth of

their own experience, and this does not automatically mean that they can
judge the truth of other people's experience. Knitter sums this up by
stating, "Truly" doesn't require "Only"110.

Another Christian who has written in favour of religious diversity and
pluralism is J. M. Templeton. Templeton, advocates a Christian "humble
approach", which makes it possible for Christianity to be open to learn
from the insights of other religions as well as learning from the
discoveries of modern science. Templeton states,

"Differing concepts of God have developed in different cultures. No one
should say that God can be reached by only one path. Such exclusiveness
lacks humility because it presumes that we can and do comprehend God.
The humble person is ready to admit and welcome the various
manifestations of God. Jesus quoted Isaiah thus: "But in vain they do
worship me; teaching for doctrine the commandments of men."
(Matthew 15: 9). Schism in religions is caused by intolerance; and
intolerance is a form of egotism. However, tolerance is not the same as
the humble approach. We should seek to benefit from the inspiring
highlights of other denominations and religions, not just to tolerate them.
We should try our very best to give the beauties of our religion to others,
because sharing our most prized possessions is the highest form of "Love
thy neighbor". Let us not water down the diverse religions into a know-
nothing soup; but rather let us study enthusiastically the glorious
highlights of each. An old Chinese precept is, "the good man does not
grieve that other people do not recognize his merits. His only anxiety is
lest he should fail to recognize theirs." It is a mistake for people of
different religions to try to agree with each other. The result is not the
best of each but rather the watered-down, least-common denominator.
What is more fruitful is a spirit of humility in which we recognize that no
one will ever comprehend all that God is. Therefore, let us permit and
encourage each prophet to proclaim the best as it is revealed to him.
There is no conflict unless the restrictive idea of exclusiveness enters in.
We can hold our ideas of the Gospel with utmost enthusiasm, while
humbly admitting that we know ever so little of the whole and that there
is plenty of room for those who think they have seen God in a different
way."111.

\[110\] ibid, p. 72.
J.M. Templeton, The Humble Approach, p. 46.

Apart from humility, Templeton advocates a theology based upon the
principle of spiritual evolution, which has obvious parallels with the
Baha'i approach. He describes it in terms of an evolution of
"consciousness":

"The nature of the Universe is to evolve. This is true of every part
including rocks, minerals, plants, animals and man. This is also true of
the very essence of the Universe, which is consciousness. Consciousness
has been present in every stage. It is God-Mind seeking to express Itself
as perfection. Consciousness evolves along with every other element. A
rock is more limited in consciousness than the mineral it contains. A
vegetable with its ability to grow is a still more highly evolved
expression of consciousness. As the Persian poet wrote: "God sleeps in
the mineral, dreams in the vegetable, stirs in the animal, and awakens in
man""112. He then goes on to quote Teilhard de Chardin, the famous
French Catholic theologian who lived in the early part of this century. He
cites Chardin for evolution being the "law of the universe", where "each
one of us is evolving towards the God-head"113. Chardin believed that
evolution was directed, both on the physical and spiritual level by the
"Universal Christ". He called the future point of human evolution, the
"Omega Point". Chardin writes of a "Super-Christ", responsible for
developing a "Super-Mankind" or "Super-Humanity". But Templeton's
multi-faith approach is a great advance on Chardin's theology. Chardin
asks whether Christianity is the only "possible religion?", and argues that
it is, believing that only Christianity is truly universal. Of Islam, he
states, "the Allah of the Koran will remain a God for the Bedouin. He
could never attract the effort of any truly civilised man"114. Of Hinduism,
he states that it is based upon "negation" and that we must "never allow
ourselves to be run away with by the sophism of the East" . He
concluded that "if Christianity is now the only factually possible
religion, it is because it is the only one logically possible. The divine,
with which mankind cannot do without if it is not to fall back into dust,
will be found for us only if we adhere closely to the movement from

\[113\] ibid, p. 92.

\[114\] Teilhard de Chardin, Science and Christ, p. 105.

\[115\] ibid, p. 106.

which Christ is progressively emerging."116. There are in Chardin,
unmistakable sentiments of Western cultural and religious superiority.

There are obviously different levels at which religions can interact.
Although many have reservations about Hick's theological pluralism,
there are a growing number of people who support a movement for
religious plurality in the service of mankind, in coming together to create
a more united, just and humane world. Even, Hick's rational theology is
part of a broader hope for brotherhood:

"The broad trend of the present century is ecumenical. Old divisions are
being transcended. The deeper essentials in which people agree are
tending to seem more important than the matters on which they differ.
Projecting this trend into the future, we may suppose that the ecumenical
spirit which has already so largely transformed Christianity will
increasingly affect the relations between the world faiths. There may
well be a growing world ecumenism, in which the common commitment
of faith in a higher spiritual reality which demands brotherhood on earth
will seem more and more significant, while the differences between the
religious traditions will seem proportionately less significant. The
relation between them may thus become somewhat like that between the
Christian denominations in this country - that is to say, they are on
increasingly friendly terms: they freely visit one another's worship and
are beginning to be able to share places of worship; they cooperate in all
sorts of service to the community; their clergy are accustomed to meet
together for discussion; and there is even a degree of interchange of
ministries; and so on."117.

So far, examples of Christian pluralism have been described. There are
however, like-minded movements in Judaism. Jonathan Sacks, Chief
Rabbi in the United Kingdom, likens the plurality of faiths to the
plurality of languages. Just as knowledge of many languages does not
detract from one's own mother tongue, but in fact leads to a greater
appreciation of language in general, so interfaith activity can enhance
our appreciation of religion. Just as the existence of many languages can
exist side by side, without feeling threatened by the others, so too, can
religions coexist peacefully. Sacks describes it in the following way,

\[116\] ibid, p. 111.
J. Hick, God Has Many Names, p. 77.

"Babel is the essential preface to the history of Abraham. Without it, we
might have thought that the covenant with Abraham was universal like
the covenant with Noah, that it applied to all humanity and that it
expressed a universal religious truth. It did not. Just as after Babel there
is no single universal language, so there is no single universal culture
and no single universal faith. The faith of Abraham left room for other
ways of serving God, just as the English language leaves room for
French and Spanish and Italian. Faiths are like languages. There are
many of them, and they are not reducible to one another. In order to
express myself at all, I must acquire a mastery of my own language. If I
have no language, I will still have feelings but I will be utterly
inarticulate in communicating them. The language into which I am born,
which I learn from my parents and my immediate environment, is where
I learn self-expression. It is a crucial, perhaps even an essential, part of
who I am. But as I venture out into the world I discover that there are
other people who have different languages which I must learn if we are
to communicate across borders. A faith is like a language. I am at home
in my own language as I am at home in my own faith. True conversions
are rare. But I am not compromised by the existence of other languages.
To the contrary, the more languages I can speak, the more I can
communicate with others and the more I am enriched by their
experience. To believe that our faith is the only religious reality there is,
is rather like the old-fashioned British tourist who believed that you
could communicate with the Spanish by speaking English very slowly
and very loudly. After Babel, the religious reality, like the linguistic
reality, is inescapably plural."118

The contemporary orthodox rabbi, David Hartman, finds in the Bible two
covenants, that of "Creation", and the other "Sinai". The Creation
covenant (as reflected in the story of Noah), is with all mankind, while
the Sinai covenant is specifically with Israel. The two covenants run in
parallel and do not preclude each other. This allows for the plurality of
faiths, each God's way of speaking to different groups of people119.
Rabbi Dr Norman Solomon, director-designate of the Centre for the
Study of Judaism and Jewish-Christian Relations (at Birmingham in the

England), uses the "covenant of Noah', the universal covenant in
Judaism, as a basis for interfaith dialogue:

"The 'covenant of Noah' offers a pattern for us to seek from others not
necessarily conversion to Judaism, but rather that faithfulness to the
highest principles of justice and morality which we perceive as the
essence of revealed religion. The dialogue of faiths is therefore for us a
natural outgrowth of our mission. We are still bound to one another by
our history and by common religious formats; this special bond is open
for others to join, though they are under no obligation to do so. Yet we
take joy in the bond that unites mankind, as descendants of the one 'first
created pair', Adam and Eve, and look forward to the restoration of that
universal bond in time to come, when 'the earth shall be full of the
knowledge of the lord, as the waters cover the sea' (Isaiah 11 :9)."120

Jewish pluralists such as Jonathan Sacks and Norman Solomon accept
that God has made multiple covenants in human history, each with
different people. They emphasize that there is nothing in the covenant of
Judaism that precludes or negates the validity of the others. The unity of
mankind must ultimately be the principle upon which Jewish pluralism
takes its inspiration, since ultimately, we are all made in God's image
(Genesis 1:26).

The three key organisers of the first Parliament of the World's Religions
conference were Christians: Charles Bonney, Rev. John Henry Barrows,
a Presbyterian minister, and Rev. Jenkin Lloyd Jones, a Unitarian
minister. Most the speakers and attendees at the conference came from a
Christian background. In a study guide on "Interfaith Dialogue", the
Rev. Marcus Braybrooke, a leading figure in the world interfaith
movement over the last 25 years, lists four organizations which have
been particularly active in promoting global interfaith exchange. They
are: The International Association for Religious Freedom, started in 1900
by some of those who attended the Parliament of the World's Religions:
The World Congress of Faiths, founded in 1936 by Sir Francis

\[120\] ibid., p. 25.

Younghusband: The Temple of Understanding, now based in New York,
founded in 1960 by Judith Hollister: and The World Conference on
Religion and Peace, whose first assembly did not meet until 1970121. The
founders and main contributors to these organisations have been, for the
most, Christians.

These organisations, largely Christian in inspiration, are reaching out
into the non-Western world. It is interesting to note that there was a first
Parliament of Religions conference in Singapore on the 22nd December,
1979, and the first Asian conference on Religion and Peace took place in
Singapore in 1976.

Most the literature on modern religious pluralism originated from
debates started from within Christianity, and the influential writers on
the subject have been Christian. As the debate becomes more global in
nature, this is slowly changing. But the main point here is that the
modern interfaith movement has emerged from the Christian West.
There is considerable irony in this fact, since compared to the other
world religions, Christianity has relatively little experience in interfaith
harmony.

The great Buddhist emperor Ashoka of the third century CE in Sri
Lanka, after converting to Buddhism, transformed a reign of war into
one of peace and inter-religious harmony. Instead of sending out troops
to conquer neighbouring countries, he sent out Buddhist missionaries
preaching a message of unity, compassion and non-violence. He
explicitly set out to promote inter-religious harmony in the name of
Buddhism. Buddhism spread throughout South East Asia without
violence.

In the world of Islam, the most famous example of inter-religious
harmony is in medieval Spain. Christians and Jews were allowed to live
peacefully for long periods at a time under the protection of Islamic
rulers. This kind of protection and harmony was linked with the ethics of
Islam. There were of course other times where local Caliphs attempted
forced conversions. In such cases, many Jews and Christians were
pressured to renounce their faith, flee their homes, or suffer a martyr's

Source Book for the Earth's Community of Religions", project editor, J. Beversluis.

death. The family of Moses Maimonidies, the most famous of all Jewish
philosophers was compelled to leave their home for this reason122.
However, this persecution was relatively mild in comparison to the
persecution of Jews under Christian rule, or the suffering of Muslims
under the Spanish Inquisition.

Another enlightened period for interfaith harmony took place in
Northern India in the 15th and 16th centuries, where saints from both
within Hinduism and Islam attempted to repair the damage of religious
intolerance. The ten saints of the Sikh religion, starting with Guru
Nanak, based their doctrine of religious harmony on the unity of God. In
their scared scripture, the Adi-Granth, there are quotations from both
Hindu and Muslim sages. The great Muslim ruler Akbar in the 16th
century, attempted to found a "Divine Faith', which incorporated
elements from Islam, Hinduism, Christianity and Zoroastrianism, but his
dream of religious unity did not continue on after his death.

The long period of Buddhists, Taoists and Confucianists living side by
side in China is also an important interfaith achievement. Wing-Tsit
Chan, a writer on Chinese history, describes it in the following way:

"It has often been said that in the last 1800 years the three religions of
Confucianism, Buddhism, and Taoism have been going on in parallel,
harmonised, or synthesised... It is not uncommon to find in a Chinese
family a Buddhist father, a Taoist mother, and a Confucian son... the
great majority, however, cannot be described as exclusive followers of
Confucianism, Buddhism, or Toaism either in the broad sense of systems
of thought or in the narrow sense of an organised religion. In the realm
of religion, many of them follow the three religions at the same time,
visiting Buddhist or Taoist temples as the need arises and also perform
Confucian rites before their ancestors. Temples dedicated to the Three
Sages are found in all parts of China, and some of them even include
representations of Islam, Christianity, and Judaism... It is often said that
the average Chinese is one who wears a Confucian crown, so to speak, a
Taoist robe, and Buddhist sandals."123

Wing-Tsit Chang, 'The Historic Chinese contribution to Religious Pluralism and
World Community', in Religious Pluralism and World Community, edited by E. J. Jurji,
There have been periods of religious conflict in China. The Buddhists
were persecuted in the 5th, 6th, 9th and 10th centuries, but these periods of
intolerance were relatively brief, very seldom involved bloodshed, and
were largely political and economic in nature. At the turn of this century,
various interfaith organisations in China were formed, apparently quite
independent of the modern Western interfaith movement. Around 1915
for example, The Society of World Religions and the International
Society of Holy Religions were founded. In a decade or so, they were
followed by The Universal Ethical Society, the Tao Yuan or Society of
the Way and the Dcuan Tao or the Way of Pervading Unity124. Members
of these societies recognised the validity of Confucianism, Taoism,
Buddhism, Islam, Christianity and Judaism.

Religious pluralism, although very much in vogue at the moment in the
West, has in fact ancient roots. Both in India and China, the unity in
diversity principle of religions has evolved over millennia. The founder
of Taoism, Lao Tzu, at the beginning of his most famous work, the Tao-
te Ching, points to the unity of all things in the "Nameless Tao". There is
"non-being", and the world of "being", these two worlds are the "same,
but after they are produced, they have different names, they both may be
called deep and profound, the door of all subtleties!"125.

In the Analects of Confucius, the brotherhood of man concept is clearly
and unmistakably stated. A disciple of Confucius, Ssu-ma Niu expressed
his anxiety over having no brother, but in response, the following
Confucius saying is cited, "If a superior man is reverential (or serious)
without fail, and is respectful in dealing with others and follows the rules
of propriety, then all within the four seas (the world) are brother"126. In a
footnote, the translator, Wing-Tsit Chan, adds that here, "the four seas"
would ordinarily mean China, none doubts that here it means the entire
world"127. Indeed, the context of the passage, implying that wherever
someone treats another person with reverence and respect, that person is

one's brother. The passage proclaims the universal brotherhood of
mankind, and points to a common ethical principle underlying all people.

Buddhism in China articulated the "One in Many" principle. r le
philosophy of Fa-Tsang (596-664) of the Hua-Yen school, is known as
the "One-and-all" philosophy128. Summarizing the Buddhist unity in
diversity principle, Fa-Tsang states, "the tendency of harmonious
combination becomes unrestricted because it has no nature, and all
phenomena which exist spontaneously can be combined because they
rise through causation. As the one and the many totally involve each
other, we look at one particle of dust and everything suddenly becomes
manifest. As the "This" takes in the "other", we look at a tiny hair and all
things appear together. The reason is that, when the mind understands,
all dharmas can be free and at ease, and because the principle is clear,
great wisdom can be achieved. Among seekers of wisdom, who will
examine its source? People talking about it it seldom investigate its
mystery to the limit." 12 . The Buddhist "One in Many" principle
influenced the Neo-Confucianists in the Sung period, and for the last
millennium, it has become deeply rooted in Chinese culture. The Neo-
Confucianist, Chang-Tsai (1020-77), linked it to Confucian brotherhood,
"Heaven is my father and Earth is my mother, and even such a small
creature as I finds an intimate place in their midst. Therefore that which
fills the universe I regard as my body and that which directs the universe
I consider as my nature. All people are my brothers and sisters, and all
things are my companions"130. Moreover, specifically on the subject of
religious plurality, To K'an Tse of the 3rd century AD stated, "All
religions have their source in Heaven which they obey"131. The Emperor
Wu (502-549), said of Confucius, Lao Tzu, and Buddha, "Traced to the
source, the three sages are no different"132. These are but a few examples
of the long history of religious pluralism in China, there is much more.
In the I-Ching, "The Book of Changes", the classic pre-Confucian text, a
religious unity in diversity principle is clearly articulated, "In the world,

there are many different roads but the destination is the same. There are a
hundred deliberations but the result is one" 1 3 3 .

Religious pluralism in India has also a long tradition to it. In the Rig
Veda, hymns that date before 1000 BC, the following unity of the gods
principle is stated: "They call it Indra, Mitra, Vaurana, and Agni and also
heavenly, beautiful Garutman: The real is one, though sages name it
variously." (Rig. Veda 1: 169). In the famous Baghavad Gita, Lord
Krishna declares that: "In any way that men love me in that same way
they find my love: for many are the paths of men, but they all in the end
come to me" (Gita 4: 11).

If Hinduism has a long history of searching for unity, of advocating
religious pluralism, then Buddhism has a distinguished legacy in the
"search after truth". Of all the world's religious traditions, it is Buddhism
that gives the most simple, profound, and clearly stated lessons on
detachment. More than any other religion, it warns against the perils of
blind attachment to religion. There are many images that beautifully
express this in Buddhist writings. One such story is the "parable of the
Raft". The Buddha likens religious teachings to being a raft which can be
used to cross the river of life. But once on the other side, the traveller is
encouraged to leave it behind, and continue the journey unencumbered
by it:

"Monks, as a man going along a highway might see a great stretch of
water, on his side dangerous and frightening, the further bank secure, not
frightening; but if there were no boat for crossing by or a bridge across
for going from this side to the beyond, it might occur to him: 'Suppose
that I, collecting grass, sticks, branches and leaves and tying them into a
raft, depending on that raft and striving with hands and feet, should cross
over safely to the beyond?' Then he does so. This might then occur to
him. 'Depending on this raft and striving with hands and feet, I have
crossed over safely to the beyond. Suppose now that putting this raft on
my head or my shoulder I should proceed as I desire?' What do you
think, monks, if he does this is he doing what should be done with that
raft?" "No, Lord." "What, monks, should that man do with the raft? It
might occur to him: 'Suppose now that I beach this raft on dry ground or

\[133\] Book of Changes, quoted by Phyllis Chew, The Chinese Religion and the Bahďí
Faith, p. 68.

submerge it and proceed as I desire?' In doing this, monks, that man
would be doing what should be done with the raft. Even so, monks, is
this simile of the raft taught by me for crossing over, not for retaining.
You, monks, by understanding this simile should get rid, even of right
mental objects, all the more of wrong ones"134

There are of course, many ways in which this image of the Buddha can
be understood. On the individual level, we all have our "rafts", our
"attachments", which we must be ready to leave behind in the path of
truth. Maybe, some doctrines or practices were useful to us at one stage
of our development, but now, only hinder us from going forward. This
does not necessarily mean we reject religious teachings, but it does mean
that we do not blindly adhere to them, remaining static within them.
Religion should always be carrying us forward: if we are to progress,
some of our previous beliefs must in some way be superseded. If there
are elements to our faith that are no longer useful, a hindrance to our
progress, then we should have the courage to discard them. Moreover,
our love for one religion must not blind us from recognizing the truth in
another. In this context, the Baha'i Faith is also very clear. 'Abdu'1-Bahá
stated that "We should, therefore, detach ourselves from the external
forms and practices of religion. We must realize that these forms and
practices, however beautiful, are but garments clothing the warm heart
and the living limbs of Divine truth. We must abandon the prejudices of
tradition if we would succeed in finding the truth at the core of all
religions"135. 'Abdu'1-Bahá goes on to say that, "We must not allow our
love for any one religion or any one personality to so blind our eyes that
we become fettered by superstition"136. Indeed, 'AbduT-Bahá
encouraged us to discard the kind of religious beliefs that lead to discord
and conflict, "Religion should unite all hearts and cause wars and
disputes to vanish from the face of the earth, give birth to spirituality,
and bring life and light to each heart. If religion becomes a cause of
dislike, hatred and division, it will be better to be without it, and to
withdraw from such a religion would be a truly religious act."137

Implied in the above passages, is the encouragement to judge religious
doctrines by their moral effects and results. This approach is beautifully
stated in the Buddhist writings. After hearing different Brahmins dispute
about religion, each claiming that their way was the only correct one, the
disciples of Buddha asked for advice. The Buddha replied:

"Don't you accept anything merely because it is a revealed authoritative
tradition. Don't you accept anything merely because it is an unbroken
succession of teaching (apostolic succession). Don't you accept anything
merely because it is report or hearsay. Don't you accept anything merely
because it is found in the scriptures (of various sects). Don't you accept
anything merely on the grounds of logic or from speculative
metaphysical theories. Don't you accept anything merely because of
standpoint or point of view. Don't you accept anything merely after
reflecting on reasons. Don't you accept a fact as true merely because it
agrees with a theory you are already convinced of. Don't you accept
anything merely on the grounds of competence or reliability of a person.
Don't you accept anything merely out of respect for your teacher.
Whenever you know for yourselves that these things are of merit, these
things are harmless, these things are praised by the wise, these things, if
performed in full, conduce to benefit, conduce to happiness, then do you
keep on fulfilling them"138.

There is in this passage, a strikingly modern approach to finding truth,
which has close parallels to a modern scientific outlook. Blind
acceptance of doctrines in religion can no more be accepted than
untested theories in science. Each must in some way be tested by
individual experience. The touchstone for testing religious doctrines is
their moral effect: do they "conduce to benefit, conduce to happiness"?
We must be continually asking, what are the fruits of a religious doctrine
or belief, in order to assess its truth content. The relativity of religious
truth is implicit in this approach. There is no attempt to arrive at absolute
or objective theology. The touchstone of judging a religious doctrine by
its moral effects plays a similar role to that of experiments in science.
Both types of tests cannot of course be applied too literally. A religious
doctrine may be true, even though religious people do not translate it into
good actions. A religion cannot be judged solely on the actions of its

\[138\] Kalama Sutta, The Raft, Twelve Discourses of the Buddha, compiled by Mom Chao
Upalisan Jumbala, p. 4.

followers. But it does provide a useful guide when attempting to make
judgements between conflicting religious beliefs. Likewise in science,
experiments by themselves seldom establish the truth of a theory, but
they do help in choosing between rival theories.

The "fruit test" does not of course, only exist in Buddhism. All religions
have a version of it. Christ gave it to his followers as a means of
distinguishing between "false prophets": "Watch out for false prophets.
They come to you in sheep's clothing, but inwardly they are ferocious
wolves. By their fruit you will recognise them. Do people pick grapes
from thornbushes, or figs from thistles? Likewise every good tree cannot
bear bad fruit, and a bad tree cannot bear good fruit" (Matthew 7:15-18).
This "fruit test" is, very close in spirit to the Buddhist criteria of judging
a doctrine by its moral effects. The difference is one of emphasis.
Buddhism throughout its history has made the individual investigation of
truth the touchstone for all religious beliefs. Even with respect to the
Buddha's own teachings, a critical attitude is encouraged, "Just as
experts test gold by burning it, cutting it, and applying it on a touchstone,
my statements should be accepted only after critical examination and not
out of respect for me"139. Baha'u'llah cites the words of Christ in the
context of pointing to moral fruits being the way to settle religious
disputes: "... dissensions among various sects have opened the way to
weakness. Each sect hath picked out a way for itself and is clinging to a
certain cord. Despite manifest blindness and ignorance they pride
themselves on their insight and knowledge. ... It lowereth man's station
and maketh him swell with pride. Man must bring forth fruit. One who
yieldeth no fruit is, in the words of the Spirit,(Christ) like unto a fruitless
tree, and a fruitless tree is fit but for the fire (Matthew 7:19)"140.

Now all references to theological subjects like "God" and "soul" in
Buddhist scripture should be understood with the "fruit test" in mind. It
is precisely in the background context of doctrinal disputes that the
Buddha appears to be agnostic. But when examined more closely, the
Buddha is rejecting the authority of certain Brahmins to talk about God
or the soul, and not rejecting the concepts of God or the soul in
themselves. In fact the opposite is true, he affirms that they are very

\[139\] Kalatissa Nanda Jayatilleke, 'Buddhism relativity and the one-world concept', in the
book Religious Pluralism and World Community, edited E. J. Jurji, p. 67.

\[140\] Baha'u'llah, Tablets of Baha'u'llah, ?. 60.

important and that he has the authority to speak about them. Take for
instance, the concept of God141. A classic Buddhist text, invariably
quoted to demonstrate Buddhist agnosticism is Chapter 1 of the Tevigga-
Sutta142. This discourse starts off with an argument between two
Brahmins, Vasetta and Bharadvaga. Each of them, has his own path
which leads to a "state of union with Brahma", and they begin to dispute
about which one is superior. Unable to come to an agreement, they seek
the advice of Buddha. Buddha establishes the fact that neither they, nor
the sages that they respect or invoke, have met "Brahma face to face",
and shows that there is a contradiction in their belief: they are dogmatic
in their own "straight path" that leads to Brahma, yet they do not know
Brahma, nor have they seen him. The Buddha concludes, "Verily,
Vesettha, that Brahmans versed in the Three Vedas should be able to
show the way to a state of union with that which they do not know,
neither have seen - such a condition of things has no existence!"143

The Buddha likens the belief of Vasetta and Bharadvaga to be like the
love that a man has for the "most beautiful woman in this land", but
when asked to describe her, they are unable to do so. The Buddha
concludes that, "Yet these Brahmans versed in the Three Vedas say,
forsooth, that they can point out the way to union with that which they
know not, neither have seen! ... Does it not follow that, this being so, the
talk of the Brahmans, versed though they be in the Three Vedas, is
foolish talk?"144 The Buddha continues with this line of enquiry, likening
their theological position to be people who build a staircase to mount
into a mansion, but in practice, they mount into thin air. He then goes on
to observe that the behaviour of the Brahmins in question is quite
different from the Brahma they worship, observing that the "Brahmans
versed in the Three Vedas - omitting the practice of those qualities which
really make a man a Brahman, and adopting the practice of those
qualities which really make men not Brahmans", and that "such a
condition of things has no existence"145. The Buddha observes that

\[141\] For a discussion on this point with respect to the soul, see, A. Khursheed, 'Body,

\[145\] ibid, p. 180.

Brahma is not "full of anger", or "is pure", or has "self-mastery", but that
"the Brahmans of the Three Vedas" have the opposite qualities. He
concludes that in this way, "the Brahmans versed though they be in the
Three Vedas, while they sit down (in confidence), are sinking down (in
the mire); and so sinking they are arriving only at despair, thinking the
while that they are crossing over into some happier land"146. But when
asked whether he knew the path to Brahma, the Buddha responded, "For
Brahma, I know, Vasettha, and the world of Brahma, and the path which
leadeth unto it. Yea, I know it even as one who has entered the Brahma
world, and has been bom within it!"147.

The moral of the Buddha's discourse is that the two Brahmans who were
disputing about which was the way to "union with Brahma", did not in
fact know Brahma - they had not taken that path for themselves.
Moreover, they did not in any way reflect the spiritual qualities of
Brahma. They did not have the authority to talk about Brahma because
Brahma was not part of their experience, and their talk was, according to
the Buddha, "foolish talk"148. The Buddha was not rejecting the world of
Brahma, or the spiritual attributes of Brahma. He was merely rejecting
the authority of certain Brahmans to talk about Brahma. The Brahmans,
in terms of what they could describe, and in terms of how they acted,
proved that they did not know the way to "union with Brahma", whereas
the Buddha, made it unmistakably clear that he not only knew the path to
the Brahma world, but had been "bom within it".

The apparent Buddhist rejection of God as Creator is also made in the
context of rejecting the doctrine of certain Brahmans149. The Buddha
describes a being who thinks of himself as Brahma, as the Creator, but in
reality, he was bom into the world like others. He gains a following of
people who also believe him to be the "Creator", by virtue of the fact
that he lived a long time before them, not by the fact that he created
them. The Buddha describes a being, who thinks of himself as the
Creator, and who in reality is not. His belief is a delusion of grandeur. At
the end of his discourse, the Buddha states, "This, bretheren, is the first
state of things on account of which, starting from which, some recluses

\[147\] ibid, p. 186.

\[148\] ibid, p. 178.

and Brahmans, being eternalists as to some things, and non-eternalists as
to others, maintain that the soul and the world are partly eternal and
partly not"150. The Buddha only implies that the creation doctrine of
some Brahmans is faulty. He does not comment on whether there really
is a Creator or not. His words cannot be generalised to apply outside the
non-Brahman context, to say the Creator God of Abraham.

The general point is that Buddhism discourages speculation about all
metaphysical doctrines, and makes judgements only with respect to their
moral effects. Historically, this approach has protected it from entering
into divisive doctrinal disputes. Instead of attempting to define a
"common creed", or "declaration of faith", as with the Abrahamic
religions, Buddhism has left doctrinal issues to individual judgement. In
helping the individual decide, it has recommended the use of the "fruit
test". There is a lesson here for anyone wishing to contribute to interfaith
harmony.

For Baha'is, although they have the principles of religious unity, the
search after truth and the harmony of science and religion in their
scriptures, they have as yet to translate them into living principles which
contribute to the unity of mankind. In this respect, they can learn much
from Eastern wisdom. In Buddhism, the principles of the independent
investigation after truth and the harmony of science and religion are
beautifully embodied, both in word and deed. One can capture a glimpse
of the power of these principles by appreciating the great contribution
Buddhism has already made to the spiritual welfare of mankind. In
modern times, these principles have captured the imagination of the
Western world, and contributed towards a movement of inter-religious
harmony, away from the traditional dogmatic religious exclusivism of
the Abrahamic religions.

Hinduism, not the Baha'i Faith, is generally credited for having brought
the principle of religious unity to the modern world151. Although Baha'is
have this principle as a central tenet of their faith, they are only just
starting to explore how it might be put into action. In contrast, the Hindu
contribution to religious harmony has been a living tradition in India and

Unity have been Indian", Christianity and World Religions, p. 13.

the Far East for over several millennia. Nowhere is the spiritual unity in
diversity principle more beautifully and poetically stated than in the
Hindu scriptures152. Hinduism, along with Buddhism, Taoism and
Confucianism have an experience of inter-religious harmony far beyond
anything in the history of the Abrahamic religions. Baha'is must have the
humility not only to accept this, but willingly celebrate and appreciate it.

6\.         Modern Eastern Pluralism

In recent times, before the rise of the modern Western interfaith
movement, China and India had been reformulating and restating their
interfaith principles. In the 16th century, while the Sikh religion arose to
create unity between Islam and Hinduism, and started a remarkable
period of inter-religious harmony in Northern India, in China, Lin Chao-
en (1517-98), became the founder of the "Three-in-One" religion. This
sect formulated a synthesis involving Taoism, Buddhist and Confucian
doctrines. It attracted a considerable following, but was later outlawed by
the late Ming government which burnt its books and temples.
Nevertheless, despite this persecution it still survives today, particularly
in Taiwan.

More recently, in the last half of the 19th century, inter-religious
movements in China and India predate the first Parliament of the
World's Religions in Chicago in 1893. The "Gospel" of Sri Ramakrishna
(1836-1886) is now well known amongst the world's religious
community, and in fact, Vivekananda, its foremost disciple, attended the
first Parliament of the World's Religions conference in Chicago. The
core teaching of the Ramakrishna movement is that all religions are one.
In the words of Ramakrishna,

"So many religions, so many paths to reach the same goal... I have
found that it is the same God towards whom all are directing their steps,
though along different paths" 153. On another occasion Ramakrishna
likens the different religions in the world to the different names that each
culture gives to water, although the names sound different, they refer to

\[152\] A. Khursheed, "The Hindu Concept of God: Unity in Diversity", The Singapore
Baha'i Studies Review, Vol. 2, 1997, p3-49

\[153\] quoted by Prabhavananda, in The Spiritual Heritage of India, p. 341.

the same liquid, "The tank has several ghats. At one Hindus draw water
and call it jal, at another Mohammedans draw water and call it pani; at a
third Christians draw the same liquid and call it water. The substance is
one though the name differs, and everyone is seeking the same thing.
Every religion of the world is one such ghat. Go with a sincere and
earnest heart by any of these ghats and you will reach the water of
eternal bliss. But do not say that your religion is better than that of
another"154.

In his address at the Parliament of the World's Religions congress, in
Chicago on 11th September 1893, Vivekananda stated that, "Unity in
variety is the plan of nature, and the Hindu has recognised it"155. He went
on to describe religious unity by paraphrasing the words of Krishna, "It
is the same light coming through different colours. And these little
variations are necessary for the purposes of adaptation. But in the heart
of everything the same truth reigns. The Lord has declared to the Hindu
in His incarnation as Krishna, "I am in every religion as the thread
through a string of pearls. Wherever thou seest extraordinary holiness
and extraordinary power raising and purifying humanity, know that I am
there"..."156. Krishna in the Bhagavad Gita states, "In the whole vast
universe there is nothing higher than I. All the worlds have their rest in
me, as many pearls upon a string" (Gita 7:7). Clearly Vivekananda
draws the natural conclusion implied in Krishna's words that the thread
which unites together all things in the universe, must also bind together
different religious revelations.

In the 19th century the Chinese Confucianist, K'ang Yu Wei (1858-
1927), formulated his vision for a Great Age of Unity. His vision was of
the whole world as one family, where all live equally and justly:

"In the world of Great Unity, the whole world becomes a great unity.
There is no division into national states and no difference between races.
There will be no war... In the Age of Great Unity, the world government
is daily engaged in mining, road building, reclamation of deserts, and
navigation as the primary task... In the Age of Great Peace, there are no

equal, and do not consider position or rank as an honour either. Only
wisdom and humanity are promoted and encouraged... In the Age of
Great Peace, since man's nature is already good and his ability and
intelligence is superior, they only rejoice in matters of wisdom and
humanity. New institutions appear every day. Public benefits increase
every day. The humane mind gets stronger every day. And knowledge
becomes clearer every day. People in the whole world together reach the
realm of humanity, longevity, perfect happiness, and infinite goodness
and wisdom... In the Age of Great Peace, all people are equal. There are
no servants or slaves, rulers or commanders, heads of religions or
popes... In the Age of Rising Peace, humanity is extended to one's kind
and therefore people are humane to all people. In the Age of Great
Peace, all creatures form a unity and therefore people feel love for all
creatures as well... History goes through an evolution, and humanity has
its path of development."157

K'ang Yu Wei reformist attempts were largely unsuccessful and his book
on the Great Unity {Ta-ťung shu), remained unpublished until 1935,
eight years after his death. Shortly afterwards, the communist movement
in China grew to power, and religious matters were discouraged.
However, from ancient times, religious plurality is deeply rooted in the
Chinese tradition. When China comes out of its seclusion, and begins to
play a more important role in world affairs, it will surely voice its
support for inter-religious harmony.

Religious pluralism as a movement in Christian circles only began to
develop after the Second World War. This means that religious pluralism
in Christianity has a very short history. The Western modern interfaith
movement is somewhat older than this, but in practice, it did not really
attract much attention until relatively recently. Nor has Christianity any
premodern examples of taking initiatives to promote inter-religious
harmony. So all in all, there is much the Christian West can learn from
the East.

There are many signs to suggest that the modern Western interfaith
movement arose from its interaction with the East. Paul Knitter,
describes how the West has been challenged to catch up with the

K'ang Yu Wei, A Source Book in Chinese Philosophy, edited by Wing-Tsit Chan,

religious pluralism of the East: "As I was told again and again by Indian
Christians, in India - especially before power lusting politicians began
exploiting religion to promote communalism or factionalism - Hinduism,
Muslims, and Christians have had to live together, to form and grasp
their religious consciousness in relation to each other. That "my truth"
cannot be the "only truth" has long been part of the Indian religious
subconscious. Here the West is catching up as the plurality of religious
truth invades and reshapes its consciousness"158. The Archbishop of
Canterbury, Robert Runcie, cites his visit to India to be a decisive
turning point in helping him make a commitment to interfaith dialogue,

"If we trust the life-giving power of the spirit within and amongst us, we
can meet each other in openness and trust; we can learn to explore
together the moments of revelation and the spiritual treasures which our
respective faiths have handed down to us - a spark of divine life and a
vision of holiness whereby the lives of countless people in past and
present are nourished, sustained, transformed and sanctified. Again, the
Indian religious heritage contains a great variety of spiritual disciplines
and knows many saints and sages who have lived and taught the path of
meditation and inwardness. Indian spirituality invites Christians perhaps
above all to the practice of contemplation, to a life of inner and outer
simplicity. Many western Christians have gone to India to learn precisely
this, to be schooled in the inner life. It is remarkable how many Christian
ashrams have been founded all over India in recent years."159

It is also worth noting that the founder of the World Congress of Faiths
organization, Sir Francis Younghusband, developed a deep interest in
Eastern religious literature. He was able to study them through his
numerous expeditions to India, China and Tibet160. The Reverend
Marcus Braybrooke, who has been a central figure of the interfaith
movement for the last 30 years and longstanding president of the World
Congress of Faiths, spent a year in India in 1962-3, and subsequently
wrote several works on the relationship of Christianity to Hinduism1 .

Two Indians who have been influential in the shaping of Western
interfaith consciousness this century have been Sri Aurobindo (1892-
1950), and Mahatma Ghandi (1869-1948). Their religious outlook,
encapsulates many aspects of the long spiritual tradition of India, and
also has many points in common with Baha'i teachings.

Sri Aurobindo was an Indian sage who lived and wrote around the same
time as the Catholic theologian Teilhard de Chardin, in the first half of
this century. Aurobindo, like Chardin, wrote of spiritual evolution.
Aurobindo states, ""All evolution is in essence a heightening of the force
of consciousness in the manifest being so that it may be raised into the
greater intensity of what is still unmanifest, from matter into life, from
life into mind, from mind into the spirit"162. This upward evolution
through different grades of consciousness or spirit is also a natural part
of Baha'i teachings163. For Aurobindo, the path towards higher
consciousness is leading to the "supermind". The force behind this
upward evolution, he termed the Spirit or Mind. Unlike Chardin,
Aurobindo was a religious pluralist. Aurobindo, in the introduction to his
commentary on the Baghavad Gita sets out his principle of religious
harmony and his opposition to religious exclusivism as follows:

"First of all, there is undoubtedly a Truth one and eternal which we are
seeking, from which all other truth derives, by the light of which all
other truth finds its right place, explanation and relation to the scheme of
knowledge. But precisely for that reason it cannot be shut up in a single
trenchant formula, it is not likely to be found in its entirety or in all its
bearings in any single philosophy or Scripture or uttered altogether and
forever by any one teacher, thinker, prophet or Avatar. Nor has it been
wholly found by us if our view of it necessitates the intolerant exclusion
of the truth underlying other systems; for when we reject passionately,
we mean simply that we cannot appreciate and explain. Secondly, this
Truth, though it is one and eternal, expresses itself in Time and through
the mind of man; therefore every Scripture must necessarily contain two
elements, one temporary, perishable, belonging to the ideas of the period
and the country which it was produced, the other eternal and
imperishable and applicable in all ages and countries"164

\[162\] Aurobindo, The Life Divine, p. 726.
> 'Abdu'1-Bahá, Some Answered Questions, chap. 36.
Aurobindo, Essays on the Gita, p. 2.

Here Aurobindo acknowledges the existence of a "Truth one" which
exists beyond the expression of any one single faith, having an eternal
aspect, but also having diverse expressions in history which are relative
to the "mind of man". Aurobindo here comes close to the Baha'i two-fold
distinction of there being an eternal (spiritual) part to each religion, and
there being a transient relative part (social laws, ordinances). In almost
identical fashion to the Baha'i unity of religions principle, Aurobindo
writes, "A unity behind diversity and discord is the secret of the variety
of human religions and philosophies; for they all get at some image or
some side clue, touch some portion of the one Truth or envisage some
one of its myriad aspects"165.

Aurobindo also describes a great challenge for organized religion in
modem times. When organized religion ignores the spiritual diversity of
its followers, tries to lay down explicit codes of belief and practice with
infallible authority, it will, according to Aurobindo be "open to denial":

"Religion has opened itself to denial by its claim to determine the tmth
by divine authority, by inspiration, by a sacrosanct and infallible
sovereignty given to it from on high; it has sought to impose itself on
human thought, feeling, conduct without discussion or question... Faith
is indispensable to man, for without it he could not proceed forward in
his journey through the Unknown; but it ought not to be imposed, it
should come as free perception or an imperative direction from the inner
spirit... The wide and supple method of evolutionary Nature providing
the amplest scope and preserving the true intention of the religious
seeking of the human being can be recognised in the development of
religion in India, where any number of religious formulations, cults and
disciplines have been allowed, even encouraged to subsist side by side
and each man was free to accept and follow that which was congenial to
his thought, feeling, temperament, build of the nature. It is right and
reasonable that there should be this plasticity, proper to experimental
evolution: for religion's real business is to prepare man's mind, life and
bodily existence for the spiritual consciousness to take it up; it has to
lead him to that point where the inner spiritual light begins fully to
emerge. It is at this point that religion must learn to subordinate itself,
not to insist on its outer characters, but give full scope to the inner spirit

\[165\] Aurobindo, The Life Divine, pp. 699-700.

itself to develop its own truth and reality"166.

Aurobindo's point, of not substituting inner spiritual fundamentals with
collectively enforced external practices, is of course, in keeping with the
Baha'i teachings. It is the inner side to religion which is eternal. The
external side, although important from a social point of view, should
never be used to stifle the inherent diversity of religious expression.
Aurobindo fully acknowledges the irreducibly subjective side to
religious experience. He presents the Indian experience here as an
example of religion evolving in a natural way, where people are not
pressured into holding religious beliefs by external authorities.
Historically in India, there were religious disputes, but they were not
violent as they were between the Abrahamic faiths. For the most part,
Indians have been free to choose their faith. India has had this element of
choice and diversity in religion from ancient times. This type of religious
pluralism is now, more and more, characterising religion in the modern
world. In the West, many have rejected organised religion for its lack of
flexibility. There is an important lesson here for the survival of organised
religion as a whole. People in the modern day have demanded the right
to have their own religious beliefs, to their own individual self-
expression. Any organised religion, if it is to survive, must give full
recognition to this personal side to religious belief. The Baha'i Faith,
although it acknowledges this diversity in principle, is in its early stages
of development. Although it fully recognises that religious truth is
relative, both in a progressive and subjective sense, it has as yet, no
living tradition of it. The great experience of religious diversity on the
Indian subcontinent, is not something to reject or compete with, it is
rather, an experience from which all of us can learn.

Mahatma Ghandi, is perhaps the most well known example of a modern
Indian sage. In characteristic Indian style, he was committed to the
spiritual unity in diversity principle: "I believe in the fundamental truth
of all great religions of the world. I believe that they are all God-given,
and I believe that they were necessary for the people to whom these
religions were revealed. And I believe that, if only we could all of us
read the scriptures of the different faiths from the standpoint of the
followers of those faiths, we should find that they were at the bottom all

\[166\] ibid, pp. 863-4.

one and were all helpful to one another."167. Here Ghandi emphasizes the
need for us to read the source scriptures for ourselves. Throughout his
life, it was the practice of religion that he was better known for: Gharidi
was known for his deeds, not so much for his words. He exemplifies the
Eastern preference to practise religion rather than talk about it. This, in
the missionary context, means that words by themselves have little
effect. Religion is something that must be first and foremost translated
into action: "I do not believe in people telling others of their faith,
especially with a view to conversion. Faith does not admit of telling. It
has to be lived and then it becomes self-propagating"168.

The need to demonstrate the truth of religion primarily in terms of deeds,
as opposed to words is something, which is of course, emphasised in all
religions. But religion in the West has tended to theorise, and divorce the
practice of religion from its theology. Religion at the level of words
alone encourages multiplicity of ideas, and has historically, often led to a
clash of doctrines. The history of religion in the West is dominated by
such doctrinal disputes. But when religious principles are translated into
action, it takes on a unifying character, where people of different faiths
meet on the field of community service, where hearts mingle in prayer
and meditation. The contemporary Indian voice, through sages like
Mahatma Ghandi, reject people who tell "others of their faith, especially
with a view to conversion". At the beginning of this century when
Ghandi wrote these words, Christian missionaries were still sent out to
the world to spread the Gospel. In India, their message was for the most
part, rejected. Recently, Christianity has had to seriously revise its
missionary ambition. Religious people in the West have moved much
closer to the Eastern view that religion is best spread through deeds
rather than by words.

Modern Buddhism also emphasizes the fact that religious conflicts arise
from the failure of religious people to translate their own principles into
action, and that they often attempt to hide this failure by aggressively
converting others to their faith. A Christian addressed the present Dalai
Lama by stating, "Christ's words "Love thy neighbour" embody for us
the Christian religion", and then asks him, "What is your message to

\[167\] M. Ghandi, All men are Brothers, no. 26.

\[168\] ibid, no. 24.

humanity when you meet another human being?" The Dalai Lama
responded in the following way:

"Love of one's neighbor, kindness, and compassion - these are, I believe,
the essential and universal elements preached by all religions. In spite of
divergent philosophical views, we can establish harmony among all
spiritual traditions on the basis of these common traits of love, kindness,
and forgiveness. I always insist on this point and devote a great deal of
energy to it. Most difficulties between religions come about because of
people who, having failed to transform and bring peace to their own
minds, do not really apply their own beliefs yet try all the while to
impose them on others. This unfortunate behavior can provoke serious
conflicts... my personal experience leads me to say that we must
concentrate on the essence of our tradition rather than become attached
to ritual and ceremony. The ritual and ceremonial aspects are, of course,
linked to the changing customs of a place and an era. However, the
essence of religion, of which teachings on the fundamental suffering of
humanity are a part, is very useful... All human beings have greatly
varied dispositions and characteristics. It is therefore advantageous, even
desirable, to have many spiritual paths to cater to the diverse needs of
diverse people. I often try to understand how certain so-called
fundamentalist or extremist movements have come about. Upon
reflection, I think that instead of concerning themselves with their own
spiritual evolution, these fundamentalist movements fall into extreme
attitudes by imposing their religion on others. Having failed to achieve
their own maturity - the basic purpose of every spiritual tradition is, after
all, the transformation and mastery of the mind - they impose on others a
transformation that they themselves have not yet achieved, a constraint
which is at the root of hatred, attachment, and all sorts of negative
passions. These are often the signs of fundamentalism. On the other hand
I think we naturally feel great respect for all the other forms of
spirituality if we practice our religion in a perfectly pure fashion, with
the understanding that in an initial stage the purpose is our own
transformation. I also think that dialogue, communication, and exchange
with other traditions are essential factors for mutual understanding. If the
representatives of the different religions remain isolated, insular, they
can have only a very fragmented and partial vision of their spiritual

traditions, and misunderstandings will remain. Exchange, contact, and
shared personal experience can only lead to greater mutual respect.. ."169

There is a great deal here in this passage that summarizes the Eastern
approach to religion, and it is in complete agreement with Baha'i
teachings. The Dalai Lama points to the inner and spiritual aspects of
religion, its practice, rather than its "ritual and ceremonial aspects",
which are "linked to the changing customs of a place and an era". These
words parallel the Baha'i two-fold distinction between the eternal
spiritual part to each religion, and its transient social part. The inherent
subjective nature of religious faith is fully acknowledged, and the need to
"have many spiritual paths to cater to the diverse needs of diverse
people" is openly welcomed. In principle, Baha'is have unity in diversity
as a central tenet of their faith, and believe that all religions are
"complimentary" and part of the "evolution of one religion"1 °. Yet in
practice, in the author's experience, the Baha'i community is only just
beginning to explore how this principle may be realised in deed, rather
than word.

At present, Buddhism is playing an important role of uniting Eastern and
Western spiritual traditions. Eastern sages are reformulating their
respective traditions to the modern era. Rather than being in competition,
Baha'is can learn how to be in fellowship with them. Historically, the
Baha'i contribution to the modern interfaith movement was made
alongside Buddhism and Hinduism. There is much common ground,
even at the doctrinal level. But doctrinal issues, even where there is
convergence, should be kept at the secondary level, while the practice of
religion must always be the primary concern, "Consider a rose", writes
Baha'u'llah in the context of explaining the unity of religions principle,
"whether it blossometh in the East or in the West, it is nonetheless a rose.
For what mattereth in this respect is rather the smell and fragrance which
it doth impart"171.

7\.       Doctrinal issues of Finality

The Baha'i Faith has some specific teachings that relate to the doctrinal
claims of finality and exclusivity in the Abrahamic religions. These
issues go beyond theology: in Iran, the birth place of the Baha'i Faith,
Baha'is have suffered severe persecutions precisely on the basis of one
such finality doctrine. Since, according to many Muslims, Muhammed is
the last and final prophet, all religions after Islam are charged with
heresy, which in many cases, is punishable by death. What is the
scriptural authority for such an action? In the Quran, there is only one
passage upon which this Islamic claim to finality hinges. In the Surah of
the "Confederates", it is stated that, "Muhammed is not father of any of
your men, but he is the Apostle of Allah, And the Seal of the Prophets:
And Allah has full knowledge of things" (Sura 33: 40). There are
sometimes other passages of the Quran which are quoted to also support
an exclusive position, such as, "If anyone desires a religion other than
Islam, never will it be accepted of him.." (Sura 3:85), but these passages
clearly should not be invoked in this way. There was no religion of Islam
at the time the Quran was being written down. Islam in these passages,
should be taken to mean "submission to God", for that is what the term
"Islam" means. It does not refer to the religion of Islam, which came
later.

There are many ways Baha'is can refute the charge of heresy, only one
will be mentioned here172. The Baha'i position with respect to
Muhammad being the "Seal of the Prophets" is to agree with it. They do
not dispute it. But what they do say is that the "Seal" here refers to the
"prophetic tradition", which is limited to the Abrahamic religions. The
term "prophet" is used only by Muslims and the "People of the Book"
(Christians and Jews). In the tradition of the "prophet", Muhammad is
the "Seal". But there are other religious traditions in the world which
have developed in parallel to the Abrahamic tradition. The "Seal of the
prophet" does not for instance mean that there will be no more Hindu or
Buddhist sages. The "Seal of the Prophets" does not mean that there will
not be future revelations from God, only that in the "prophetic tradition",
or Abrahamic tradition, Islam is the final one.

\[172\] S. Fazel and K. Fananapazir, 'A Baha'i Approach to the Claim of Finality in Islam',
The Journal of Baha'i Studies, Vol. 5, No. 3, pp. 17-40.

There are two terms for the word prophet that appear in the Quran:
prophet nabi, and apostle/messenger rasul. The word nabi appears most
often in the context of describing descendants of Abraham and it is
precisely the prophet nabi which is used in the "Seal of the prophets"
(khatam al-nabiyyin) passage in the Surah of Confederates. Throughout
the Quran, the word nabi is used exclusively for the descendants of
Abraham, while the word Apostle appears to be more general (it includes
Apostles outside the Abrahamic tradition, Hud, Salih, and Jethro).
Moreover, the term Apostle frequently appears in a more universal
context, such as, "To every people was sent an Apostle" (Sura 10:47).

Baha'u'llah never claimed to be a prophet, nor did his son, 'AbduT-Bahá.
From the Baha'i perspective the "Prophetic Cycle" has come to an end.
Baha'u'llah's message is not specifically addressed to the Abrahamic
religions alone, but it is a call made to mankind as a whole. Baha'u'llah
states: "It is evident that every age in which a Manifestation of God hath
lived is divinely ordained, and may, in a sense, be characterised as God's
appointed Day. This Day, however, is unique, and is to be distinguished
from those that have preceded it. The designation "Seal of the Prophets"
fully revealeth its high station. The Prophetic Cycle hath, verily, ended.
The Eternal Truth is now come. He hath lifted up the Ensign of Power,
and is now shedding upon the world the unclouded splendor of His
Revelation"173. The "high station" of this age, according to Baha'u'llah, is
that religious development in the world will no longer go on in parallel,
that is, separately in different parts of the world. For the first time in our
collective history, one revelation will inspire people from all parts of the
world to move forward together. Baha'u'llah claims to be the bearer of
that revelation.

Claims of finality were also made in Judaism and Christianity and it is
instructive to examine how Muhammad responded to them: "And they
say: "None shall enter Paradise unless he be a Jew or a Christian." Those
are their (vain) desires. Say: "Produce your proof if ye are truthful. Nay,-
whoever submits His whole self to Allah and is a doer of good,- He will
get his reward with his Lord; on such shall be no fear, nor shall they
grieve" S. 2:111-2. Clearly for Muhammad, whoever is a "doer of good"
is acceptable to God. On another occasion, after citing the exclusivism of
some "People of the Book", Muhammad stresses the fact that the

\[173\] Baha'u'llah, Gleanings, p. 60.
180         THE SINGAPORE BAHÁT STUDIES REVIEW

bounties of God lie above human comprehension, they are unbounded,
and we should not place our human limits upon them: "A section of the
People of the Book say: "Believe in the morning what is revealed to the
believers, but reject it at the end of the day; perchance they may
(themselves) Turn back; And believe no one unless he follows your
religion." Say: "True guidance is the Guidance of Allah. (Fear ye) Lest a
revelation be sent to someone (else) Like unto that which was sent unto
you? or that those (Receiving such revelation) should engage you in
argument before your Lord?" Say: "All bounties are in the hand of Allah.
He granteth them to whom He pleaseth: And Allah careth for all, and He
knoweth all things." For His Mercy He specially chooseth whom He
pleaseth; for Allah is the Lord of bounties unbounded." (Sura 3:72-4)

The Baha'i Faith fully acknowledges the divine revelation of the Quran,
it does not in any way oppose it or abrogate it. It does not in any way
claim to be superior to it, and emphasizes the fact that all religions come
from the same source and come for the same purpose. This is completely
in keeping with the expectations of the Quran itself: "It is never the wish
of those without Faith among the People of the Book, nor of the Pagans,
that anything good should come down to you from your Lord. But Allah
will choose for His special Mercy whom He will - for Allah is Lord of
grace abounding. None of Our revelations do We abrogate or cause to be
forgotten, but We substitute something better or similar: Knowest thou
not that Allah Hath power over all things?" (Sura 2:106-7) Moreover, the
way Muslims are called upon to judge others is by applying the "fruit
test", that is, they must examine claims of truth in terms of their moral
effects. They must accept the "righteous" and those who do "good
works": "Those who believe (in the Qur'an), those who follow the
Jewish (scriptures), and the Sabians and the Christians,- any who believe
in Allah and the Last Day, and work righteousness,- on them shall be no
fear, nor shall they grieve. (Sura 5:69), or "Not all of them are alike: Of
the People of the Book are a portion that stand (For the right): They
rehearse the Signs of Allah all night long, and they prostrate themselves
in adoration. They believe in Allah and the Last Day; they enjoin what is
right, and forbid what is wrong; and they hasten (in emulation) in (all)
good works: They are in the ranks of the righteous. Of the good that they
do, nothing will be rejected of them; for Allah knoweth well those that
do right, exceeding torment." (S 3:113-5)

It is also instructive to examine how Christ responded to the religious
exclusivist claims of some Jews. In Deuteronomy, it is said that "but he
has revealed his Law, and we and our descendents are to obey it for
ever" (Deut. 29:29). Upon these kinds of statements, some Jews reject
the proposition that there could ever be another convenant with God after
Judaism. So when the Pharisees charged Christ with breaking the Law,
Christ responded: "Think not that I am come to destroy the law, or the
prophets: I am come not to destroy, but to fulfil. For verily I say unto
you, Till heaven and earth pass, one jot or one tittle shall in no wise pass
from the law, till all be fulfilled." (Matthew 5: 17-18).

What about the text, "I am the way, the truth and the life: no man
cometh unto the Father, but by me" (John 14: 6)? This passage is often
quoted to justify Christian claims of exclusivity. But it must be read in
context, and if this is done, it does not appear to suggest that Christ is
making an exclusive claim that applies to all humanity for all time. The
context of this passage is that Christ is speaking to his disciples,
reassuring them of eventual triumph. Christ first starts off by stressing
the universality of his revelation, "In my Father's house there are many
mansions", but after his disciple Thomas did not understand it, Christ
made it simple for him - "I am the way, the truth and the life". The entire
passage reads: "In my Father's house are many mansions: if it were not
so, I would have told you. I go to prepare a place for you. And if I go and
prepare a place for you, I will come again, and receive you unto myself;
that where I am, there ye may be also. And whither I go ye know, and
the way ye know. Thomas saith unto him, Lord, we know not whither
thou goest; and how can we know the way? Jesus saith unto him, I am
the way, the truth and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by
me. If ye had known me, ye should have known my Father also: and
from henceforth ye know him, and have seen him." (John 14:2-7). Read
in context, Christ is speaking specifically to his disciple Thomas. It is not
clear what the "many mansions" are in the "house" of the "Father", but
one thing is clear, it is by no means an exclusive message. In fact, it
suggests that there are many pathways to God (many "mansions"), it was
exclusive for Christ's immediate disciples, but certainly should not be
the basis by which Christians should reject the truth of other religions.

As with other problems of inter-religious intolerance, a greater degree of
humility is required. Who are we to judge whether someone is acceptable
before God or not? Has not the history of religion taught us that we are

very poor judges indeed? Were the Pharisees not completely wrong
about Christ? Were the People of the Book not completely wrong about
Muhammad? In the words of St Paul, "for the letter kills but the Spirit
gives life" (2 Cor. 3:6). The truth of St Paul's words echo down centuries
and centuries of religious violence.

8\.      Conclusion

This paper has described some trends in the modem interfaith movement
and how Baha'is can both contribute and learn from them. The paper
describes how the rise of the Baha'i Faith in the West and the modem
interfaith movement developed side by side and how they have the
common aim of bringing about more inter-religious harmony. The trend
of people of different faiths coming together in a spirit of service, in the
search after truth, is something which Baha'is can fully participate in.
Baha'is can learn from the rich heritage of the older religions,
particularly from the inter-faith legacy of Hinduism, Buddhism and the
Chinese spiritual traditions. The paper has argued that this learning
process is essential to the specific Baha'i mission of being the "promise"
of all the world's spiritual traditions.

There are many people today, who distrust and even resent traditional
missionary activity. In the Pope's recent tour of India, public
demonstrations were made against the work of Christian missionaries
there. Despite the fact that India has an admirable record of inter-
religious harmony and that there have been recent Papal statements in
encouraging interfaith dialogue, many modem Indians see interfaith and
missionary work as fundamentally incompatible. A conflict between the
two need not arise for Baha'is, provided they understand their mission in
the broader terms of bringing about a greater degree of inter-religious
unity and fellowship. The success of all Baha'i interfaith activity is
crucially dependent on the degree to which Baha'is are able to translate
their principles into action, particularly the extent to which they are able
to achieve unity and fellowship amongst themselves. In short, Baha'is
must themselves become living examples of the unity and fellowship
they advocate. Having achieved unity amongst themselves, they are then
in a position to bring together people of different faiths. This point is

made again and again in the Baha'i writings. 'AbduT-Bahá describes it in
the following way:

"Today, the one overriding need is unity and harmony among the
beloved of the Lord, for they should have among them but one heart...
Until such time, however, as the friends establish perfect unity among
themselves, how can they summon others to harmony and peace? ...
Wherefore, o ye beloved of the Lord, bestir yourselves, do all in your
power to be as one, to live in peace, each with the others; for ye are all
the drops from but one ocean, the foliage of one tree, the pearls from a
single shell, the flowers and sweet herbs from the same one garden. And
achieving that, strive ye to unite the hearts of those who follow other
faiths."174
