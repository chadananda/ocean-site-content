Abstract
Religions can transmit their culture by means of community religious education, writing, publication, formal
scholarship and scriptural studies. This is especially important in the Baha’i Faith which is a lay religion.
This essay is a preliminary survey of the history of the cultivation and evolution of religious education in the
Baha’i Faith in Iran in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. Key individuals who played a role in these
educational processes are briefly introduced and discussed.

Historical Context
Systematic study of any subject, including religion, can take on diverse forms, contain various degrees of
depth and breadth, and be aimed at achieving different goals. The study of the Baha’i religion is no
exception. The history, teachings, principles, and ultimate aims of this religion – as well as its relationship
with eastern and western religious traditions – have been the subject of study in Baha’i communities for
many decades. Early attempts ranged from regular classes held for children and youth to deepen their
knowledge of the Baha’i tradition, to teacher training classes for preparing Baha’i teachers to promote the
religion, to research and publication of treatises by Baha’i scholars in defense of the nascent religion against
those who considered it a heresy.

Mirza Abu’l-Fadl

Earliest attempts at formalizing the study of the Baha’i religion were first aimed at Baha’i children and youth
– a tradition that began in 1894 when, during a 10-month stay in Haifa, Mirza Abu’l-Fadl Gulpaygani (1844–
1914), the renowned Persian Baha’i scholar, started teaching the youth and children of Baha’i pilgrims and
Baha’i residents of the Haifa-Akka regions.1 In the early 1900s, similar classes were held by Haji Mirza
Haydar-‘Ali Isfahani (ca. 1830–1920) who, at ‘Abdu’l-Baha’s (1844–1921) instruction, began holding
informal Baha’i study classes for the children of ‘Abdu’l-Baha’s household – a group that included Shoghi
Effendi (1897–1957), who later succeeded ‘Abdu’l-Baha as the head of the religion.2 These early study
classes slowly expanded to regions outside the Holy Land. For instance, in 1903, shortly after his
conversion, Siyyid Ahmad Musavi Sadru’l-Ulama-yi Hamadani (1868–1908), known as Sadr al-Sudur3 –

another prominent Persian Baha’i scholar and a contemporary of Mirza Abu’l-Fadl – began holding study
classes for select Baha’i youth in Tehran. ‘Abdu’l-Baha had instructed Sadr al-Sudur to write a rational
treatise in defence of the new religion. As he began working on the treatise, he developed the idea of
sharing the content with some of the bright young Baha’is. After getting approval from veteran Baha’is, as
well as the original Hands of the Cause appointed by Baha’u’llah himself, Sadr al-Sudur organized what
essentially became the Lama‘āt-i Khams va Tajallīyāt-i Shams (The Five Flashes and the Effulgences of
the Sun).4

His classes were held on Friday mornings. Interestingly, among those who attended Sadr al-Sudur’s
classes for a few weeks in 1906 were Hippolyte Dreyfus-Barney (1878–1928) and Laura Clifford-Barney
(1879–1974). The couple, who were engaged at the time, received permission from ‘Abdu’l-Baha to travel
to Persia and spend time with Persian believers so that eastern and western Baha’is could experience
companionship with each other and begin to break down cultural and language barriers. In his biography
of Sadr al-Sudur, Nasrullah Rastigar, one of Sadr al-Sudur’s students,5 provides a detailed account of the
visit by this western couple and their participation in Sadr al Sudur’s classes.6 Rastigar also provides
another version of the account, along with the picture below, in an issue of the Persian magazine Ahang-i
Badi‘ (The New Melody).7 Dreyfus-Barney had become the first French Baha’i in 1901, and later wrote and
translated a great number of Baha’i writings into French. During this visit, Laura Clifford Barney also
presented a series of questions to Sadr al-Sudur, which she compiled – along with Sadr al-Sudur’s
responses – into a treatise of just over a hundred pages that became known as Istidlaliyyih-i Mukhtasar-i
Sadr al-Sudur (Sadr al-Sudur’s Brief Rational Treatise).8 Barney’s questions concerned Islam and how the
divine origin of the Babi and Baha’i revelations could be proven through the Qur’an and Muslim hadith
(traditions). Upon her return to Haifa, she presented a copy of this treatise to ‘Abdu’l-Baha. She had
previously attempted the same approach with ‘Abdu’l-Baha himself. During her 1904–1906 ‘Akka (Acre)
stay, she had conducted a series of interviews with ‘Abdu’l-Baha during lunch breaks. She later compiled
her accounts of those interviews into a book called Some Answered Questions.

In 1906, study classes for Baha’i children were expanded beyond the Palestine region into ‘Ishqabad, which
had a significant Baha’i population. ‘Abdul-Baha had sent Shaykh Muhammad-‘Ali Qa’ini (1861/62–1924)9
to that city and asked him to take charge of the education of Baha’i children there. The Ishqabad Baha’i
community had established the first Baha’i school in the world some ten years earlier.10 Shaykh
Muhammad-‘Ali later expanded these into fully-fledged classes for Baha’i youth as well, when he began
teaching at Ishqabad Baha’i Schools for boys and girls. These schools were adjacent to the Baha’i Temple
there.11 The textbook he used was called al-Durus al-Diyanah (Lessons on [the Baha’i] Religion), which
was in his own handwriting.12 In 1908, Sadr al-Sudur’s untimely death at the young age of 40 left a void for
Baha’i youth training in Tehran. However, in that same year, ‘Abdu’l-Baha sent the well-known Baha’i poet,
Mirza Muhammad Sidihi – known as Na‘im (Delight) – a tablet in which he invited Na‘im to continue the
tradition that Sadr al-Sudur had started. Na‘im, author of several treatises himself, accepted the invitation
and hand-picked sixty Baha’i youth for his classes. These were held at his own home and focused on the
fulfilment of Biblical and Qur’anic prophecies by the Bab and Baha’u’llah. Na‘im also offered similar classes
for Baha’i girls and women.13

Baha’i Studies as Apologia
By the start of ‘Abdu’l-Baha’s ministry, Mirza Abu’l-Fadl had already established himself as the most
distinguished Persian Baha’i scholar of his time. He was the recipient of about ten tablets from Baha’u’llah
and over one hundred from ‘Abdu’l-Baha.14 Mirza Abu’l-Fadl was highly respected by both Baha’u’llah and
‘Abdu’l-Baha, so much so that the latter had invited Baha’is to follow Mirza Abu’l-Fadl’s example15 and once
proclaimed that Mirza Abu’l-Fadl was like ‘Abdu’l-Baha’s own self.16 Though erudite, early Baha’i scholars
such as Mirza Abu’l-Fadl often came from the ranks of Shi‘ite clerics. Thus, their education and publications
differed significantly from what is today the standard in the modern Western field of religious studies. Most
of the early works of such scholars were written in the form of apologias for the newly founded religion.17
Thus, they were unambiguous in their commitment to the Baha’i religion. This made their publications and
compilations enormously popular among the Baha’is of their era and future generations of Baha’is. In fact,
Mirza Abu’l-Fadl’s rational treatises in defence of the nascent religion began a tradition of essays that
contained a wide range of logical presentations of the Baha’i religion to Jewish, Christian and Muslim
audiences. Soon, his works became the foundation for more rigorous studies of the Babi and Baha’i
religions and their truth-claims. Mirza Abu’l-Fadl’s writings continue to play a significant role in Baha’i
Studies to this day. He also remains the only early Persian Baha’i scholar whose works have been
translated into English.18 In addition to writing apologetic works, Mirza Abu’l-Fadl also travelled widely
throughout his life. At Baha’u’llah’s instruction, he travelled throughout Persia for about a decade. Between
1888–1891, he also travelled to Central Asian countries, including Turkmenistan.19 Later, at ‘Abdu’l-Baha’s
instruction, Mirza Abu’l-Fadl also traveled to Egypt and the United States to give presentations on the Baha’i
religion.

After Mirza Abu’l-Fadl, Mirza Asadu’llah Fadil Mazandarani (1881–1957) and ‘Abdu’l-Hamid Ishraq-Khavari
(1902–1972) are generally considered to be next in rank of the distinguished Iranian Baha’i scholars. Fadil
Mazandarani, whose mammoth nine-volume history of the Babi and Baha’i religions, known as Zuhūr al-
Haqq (The Manifestation of Truth); five-volume Babi and Baha’i dictionary, entitled Asrār al-Āthār (Mysteries
in the Writings [of the Faith]); and four-volume compilation of hitherto unpublished writings of Baha’u’llah
and ‘Abdu’l-Baha, known as Amr va Khalq ([The Kingdoms of ] Revelation and Creation), have provided
students and academicians of Baha’i Studies with a wealth of knowledge and information about the early
history and teachings of these religions. Mazandarani was also instructed by ‘Abdu’l-Baha – and later by
Shoghi Effendi – to travel widely and make presentations on the teachings of these religions. Among the
countries he travelled to were Iraq, India, the United States and Canada. In the early 1920s, Mazandarani
delivered a series of pioneering presentations in the US on gender equality, racial harmony, religious
tolerance, globalization and constructive collaboration among the nations of the world.20

‘Abdu’l-Hamid Ishraq-Khavari is the last of the three most accomplished Persian scholars. He received his
religious education at a seminary in Mashhad and was gaining prominence as a Shi’ite cleric when he
converted to the Baha’i religion in 1927. He devoted the rest of his life to Baha’i research and activities until
his death in 1972. This included compiling large volumes on Baha’i history, teachings, laws, and ordinances.
Many of his works, particularly his nine-volume Mā’idih-yi Āsmānī (Heavenly Sustenance) – which, much
like Mazandarani’s Amr va Khalq, made a host of previously inaccessible writings of Baha’u’llah and ‘Abdu’l-
Baha available to Baha’is – and the four-volume Qāmūs-i Īqān (A Dictionary of [the Book of ] Certitude),
are still among the most influential sources of research for Baha’i Studies in Persian.21 A long list of Ishraq-
Khavari’s writings remains unpublished to this day.22

Baha’i Studies Classes for Teacher Training
Sadr al-Sudur’s classes and those held by Shaykh Muhammad-‘Ali Qa’ini in Ishqabad offered a great model
for other capable Baha’i teachers to follow in the ensuing decades. For instance, in the early 1940s, a
Baha’i Studies class known as Kilās-i Ālī-yi Dars-i Tablīgh (The Institute for Teacher Training) was
established at the National Baha’i Administrative Centre in Tehran, known as Hazīrat al-Quds-i Millī. The
class, which ran well into the 1960s, was taught by such eminent Baha’is as Ishraq-Khavari, ‘Azizu’llah
Sulaymani (1901–1985), ‘Ali-Akbar Furutan (1905–2003), Ahmad Yazdani (1891–1978) and Siyyid ‘Abbas
‘Alavi (1893–1961). Among the students was Dr Heshmat Moayyad (1926/7–), who later became Professor
of Persian at the Department of Near Eastern Languages and Civilization at the University of Chicago.23 In
1959, Dr Nosratullah Mohammad Hosseini (1935–) began a three-year class in Advanced Baha’i Studies
that covered selections from the works of Baha’u’llah, ‘Abdu’l-Baha and Shoghi Effendi, as well as materials
on Babi and Baha’i history. Muhammad Hosseini’s classes were among the first in Baha’i history to include
non-traditional subjects, such as Arabic syntax and grammar, the Qur’an and courses on world religions,
including Jainism, Sikhism and Manichaeism.24 Among the graduates of this programme was Baha’i scholar
Dr Vahid Ra’fati (1945–), who has been at the Research Department of the Baha’i World Centre in Haifa,
Israel since 1980. In the 1960s and 70s, several other prominent scholars held rigorous Baha’i Studies
classes in different Iranian cities, including the prolific Ishraq-Khavari in Isfahan, as well as Dr Riaz Ghadimi
(1927–2006) and Dr Farhang Holakouee (1944–) in Tehran. Ghadimi designed and conducted a four-year
programme of Advanced Baha’i Studies, during which students memorized selected Baha’i writings,
learned Arabic grammar to improve their reading and understanding of the Arabic Baha’i writings, and
studied oratory. Ghadimi’s students also studied the histories and sacred texts of other religions as well as
the development of philosophy as a field of study, beginning from ancient Greek philosophy to the modern
schools.25

Baha’i Studies as Rigorous Academic Programme: The Institute for Advanced
Baha’i Studies (IABS)
In September 1974, the National Spiritual Assembly of the Baha’is of Iran received a letter from the
Universal House of Justice encouraging them to begin educating a select few talented Baha’i youth in the
rigorous study of the Baha’i religion, as well as traditional religious and mystical subjects. A year later, the
establishment of an institute that would accomplish this goal became one of the objectives of the Five Year
Plan (1974–1979) for the Iranian Baha’i community. In April 1976, the institute officially opened its doors
and began operation under the title of Mu’assisih-yi ‘Ālī-yi Ma‘ārif-i Amr (The Institute for Advanced Baha’i
Studies, henceforth IABS).26 IABS started with five faculty members and 20 students, mostly college-age,
who were hand-picked by the faculty or other prominent Baha’is. The five instructors were Dr ‘Ali Murad
Davudi, Mr Badi‘u’llah Farid, Dr Muhammad Afnan, Mr Muhammad Muvahhid (a former Shi’ite cleric), and
Colonel Jalal Dini. Those who selected the initial students were expected to be familiar with candidates’
potential and dedication to Baha’i Studies. At first, classes were focused on teaching Baha’u’llah’s Kitāb-i
Aqdas (the Most Holy Book), the Bab’s the Persian Bayan, the Qur’an, Islamic Studies, the English works
of Shoghi Effendi and Arabic syntax and grammar. Research areas students could focus on were also
defined and a library was established. The plan was to eventually transform the institute beyond a mere
centre for academic study of the Baha’i religion into an organization, the goals of which would include
arranging and holding scientific, scholarly conferences, as well as conventions for consultation and
discussion on religious and spiritual subjects. IABS started its educational activities with a three-cycle
curriculum:

Cycle 1: The first cycle consisted of a two-year introductory programme in Persian, Arabic, and English.
The goal of the first cycle was to provide a foundation in basic Baha’i Studies and prepare the students for
more advanced topics. Subjects for this two-year programme were divided into four semesters:
• Baha’i Works in Persian
• A Short History of the Baha’i Religion
• Short Histories of World Religions
• The Baha’i Administrative Order
• Arabic Syntax
• Baha’i Works in Arabic
• The Kitab-i Aqdas
• Baha’i Works in English
• A Short History of the Baha’i Religion
• Baha’i Laws
• A Brief History of World Religions
• Arabic Syntax
• The Study of the Works of the Bab
• Baha’i Works in English
• Logical Reasoning
• Ancient Greek Logic
• General Topics on the Social Teachings of the Faith
• The History of Western Philosophy
• Supplementary Arabic
• The Study of the Works of the Bab
• The Qur’an and Qur’anic Exegesis
• Baha’i Works in English
• Scriptural Reasoning
• The Study of Wisdom
• The History of Eastern Philosophy
• Supplementary Arabic
Cycle 2: The second cycle was a year-long specialization programme that initially started with only one
area of focus – Islamic Studies. Future plans included the addition of other specializations in Eastern
philosophy, world religions and jurisprudence. The specialization in Islamic Studies included the following
two divisions:

• The Qur’an and Qur’anic Exegesis
• The Science of Discourse (‘ilm al-kalām)27
• The Principles of Islamic Jurisprudence (Usūl-i fiqh)
• Qur’anic Studies
• The Works of the Bab
• Gnosis and Mysticism
• Islamic and Shi’ite Sciences and Idioms
• Ancillary Studies

• The Qur’an and Qur’anic Exegesis
• The Science of Discourse
• The History of Islam
• Qur’anic Studies
• The Works of the Bab
• Gnosis and Mysticism
• Muslim Sects and Their Beliefs

Cycle 3: The third and last cycle was an advanced studies programme which was to last a minimum of one
year. During this time, students who had completed the previous two cycles would engage in intensive
research on a subject selected in consultation with a faculty member. The outcome of the research was to
be published as a thesis. The faculty for all three cycles was to be selected from among Baha’i instructors
inside and outside Iran. Some of the most prominent Iranian scholars of the Baha’i religion were asked to
serve as faculty at IABS. Below are brief accounts of their lives and descriptions of the capacities in which
they served at that institute.

Dr ‘Ali Murad Davudi (1922–1979?)
Davudi was the first student in Iran to receive a doctoral degree in philosophy. His doctoral dissertation won
an award from Empress Farah Pahlavi’s Cultural Foundation.28 Davudi went on to become one of the most
prominent professors of philosophy in Iran prior to the Islamic Revolution of 1979. He eventually became
the chair of the Department of Philosophy at the University of Tehran. In addition to writing many works on
the history of Greek and Islamic philosophies, Davudi also became an expert translator of great works of
philosophy from French into Persian.29 His works also included numerous books, treatises, and audiotaped
talks on Baha’i philosophy, theology and metaphysics. Many of these talks were later published in print by
others, including Vahid Ra’fati, one of Davudi’s students. With the recent translation of his book, Insān dar
Ā’īn-i Bahā’ī, from Persian into English by Riaz Masrour under the title ‘Human Station in the Baha’i Faith’,
Davudi became only the second prominent Baha’i scholar (along with Mirza Abu’l-Fadl) to have his works
translated into English. At IABS, he focused on gnosis (‘irfān), particularly Islamic and Baha’i mysticism.
For Islamic mysticism, the main textbook he used was the classic Misbāh al-Hidāya wa Miftāh al-Kifāya

(The Light of Guidance and the Key to Sufficiency) by the eminent Muslim philosopher and mystic Shihab
al-Din Yahya Suhrawardi (1154–1191), the founder of the School of Illumination (Ishraq).30 For Baha’i
mysticism, the primary text was Baha’u’llah’s Seven Valleys. Davudi also gave regular Baha’i study classes
to the youth in Tehran and in summer schools across the country. He frequently visited a local recording
studio and taped lectures on various subjects, such as prayer, the station of man, and free will. These were
later distributed on cassette tapes to the Baha’i community.

On 11 November 1979, while he was walking alone in a park near his home in Tehran, Davudi was abducted
and never seen again. He has since been presumed dead and was more than likely a victim of state
kidnapping and execution. The Iranian government denied any involvement, but three revolutionary guards
later admitted that they had been ordered to kidnap Davudi.31

Badi‘u’llah Farid (1927–1981)
Farid was instrumental in the establishment of IABS. Even though he had obtained a law degree in the
1950s, he was a teacher by profession and served in that capacity for many years. From a rather young
age, Farid had developed great interest in Baha’i Studies and developed a thorough knowledge of the
Arabic language, syntax and grammar. He published several works on those subjects and was also familiar
with logic, philosophy, Islamic jurisprudence, theology, Persian literature, and the sacred writings of various
religions, particularly the Qur’an, the Kitab-i Aqdas and the Kitab-i Iqan (the Book of Certitude).

After the passing of Fadil Mazandarani, Farid began gathering, collating and publishing his works. He also
prepared and organized materials for the Majallih-yi Akhbār-i Amrī (Baha’i News Magazine), which was a
publication of the National Spiritual Assembly of Iran and contained various kinds of Baha’i news. Following
the establishment of IABS, Iran’s National Spiritual Assembly chose Farid to manage and supervise the
institute. He invested all of his time in the growth and development of this institute and served in that
capacity until his arrest. Farid also served as a teacher at IABS and taught classes on the Kitab-i-Aqdas
and Kitab-i-Iqan. Additionally, for a number of years, he served on Iran’s Baha’i Publications Approval
Committee as well as the committee for finalizing the vocalization32 of words in the Kitab-i-Aqdas. Towards
the end of his life, Farid was elected to Tehran’s Spiritual Assembly.

On 7 February 1980, while in his car along with his personal driver, Farid was stopped, arrested and
transferred to Evin Prison. On 24 June 1981, after more than 16 months of imprisonment, Farid was
executed on fabricated charges along with three other Baha’is. Among his posthumous publications is An
Essay on the Kitab-i-Aqdas.33

Muhammad Muvahhid (1937–1979?)
Muvahhid was born in Shiraz. The son of a renowned cleric, he himself was six years into his religious
education at a seminary when he came across Baha’i writings at a city library and was deeply attracted to
them. He eventually converted to the religion in 1957 and practised it in secret for eight years. In September
1965, Muvahhid revealed his conversion to his seminary students and his brothers. Upon hearing the news,
some of his students became enraged and threatened to kill him. To protect him from harm, others declared
Muvahhid mentally unsound and sent him to a mental asylum, where he remained in custody for 95 days.
His doctors, however, stated that he was in perfect mental health and subsequently released him. Muvahhid
then moved to Tehran, where he began studying and arranging classes for teaching the Baha’i religion.

He was asked to teach at IABS in 1977, where he held classes on the Bab’s Arabic Bayan as well as Arabic
syntax and etymology, for which he used Jāmi‘ al-Muqaddamāt (A Comprehensive Introduction [to Arabic
Syntax and Etymology]). In May 1979, Muvahhid was abducted and never heard from again. He is
presumed dead.34

‘Azizu’llah Sulaymani (1901–1985)
Sulaymani was born on 10 November 1901 into a prominent Baha’i family in the village of Kelateh Yazd-
Abad in Khurasan. His maternal grandfather was Shatir-Rida, who had travelled to Baghdad and owned a
bakery there that provided bread for Baha’u’llah’s household. When Sulaymani was 5 or 6 years old, his
family moved to Ishqabad, Turkmenistan, which had one of the most vibrant Baha’i communities in the
world at the time and eventually became home to the first Baha’i House of Worship in 1908. It was there
that, as a youth, Sulaymani attended a Baha’i school and received education from such eminent Baha’i
teachers as Shaykh Muhammad-‘Ali Qa’ini.

Later, Sulaymani studied the Arabic language and Islamic Studies, and eventually settled in Iran. In the
1940s, he began collecting biographical information about prominent early Babis and Baha’is. In 1955, he
met Shoghi Effendi, the Guardian of the Baha’i religion, who advised him to travel across Iran. Therefore,
Sulaymani further expanded his travels and, in the process, continued to compile and publish life stories of

early Babis and Baha’is – something he continued to do until the early 1970s. The result was a huge 10-
volume series of more than 5,600 pages that covered the lives of 99 prominent Babi and Baha’i figures.
The collection became known as Masābīh-i Hidāyat (Lamps of Guidance). The first nine volumes were
gradually published from 1948 to 1976. The Islamic Revolution of 1979 prevented print publication of the
tenth and last volume. However, that volume was eventually published digitally in 2007.35 What makes this
collection unique is the fact that Sulaymani gathered the materials for these biographies through his travels
across Iran, where he conducted personal interviews with descendants of his subjects or others who had
intimate knowledge about them. In the process, he also collected a great number of primary source
documents and manuscripts. Masābīh-i Hidāyat remains one of the most comprehensive biographies of
early Babis and Baha’is to date.

As noted above, by 1961, Sulaymani was teaching at the Institute for Teacher Training at the National
Baha’i Administrative Center in Tehran with other distinguished Baha’i scholars. He was eventually asked
by Iran’s National Spiritual Assembly to manage this institute. At IABS, Sulaymani taught ancient Greek
logic for which he used his own textbook, Mantiq-i Sulaymānī (Sulaymani Logic). He passed away on 24
October 1985 in the city of Gunbad-i Kavus, Mazandaran.36

Dr Muhammad Afnan (1930–2017)
Dr Afnan was a descendant of the family of the Bab and an expert on the Babi religion and the Bab's works,
particularly the Persian Bayan, which he taught at IABS. He was one of the five original instructors and a
key member of the faculty at IABS. After the Islamic revolution, Afnan moved to Canada and later to Israel,
where he served at the Research Department of the Universal House of Justice for many years. He
eventually relocated to Canada, where he passed away in August 2017. Two volumes of his essays on
Babi and Baha’i studies, entitled Majmū‘ih-yi Maqālāt (The Collected Essays of Dr. Muhammad Afnan),
have been published by Andalib (Dundas, Ontario, Canada).

‘Inayatu’llah Fananapazir (1921/22–1978)
Fananapazir was born around 1921–1922 into a Baha’i family in Isfahan. Fananapazir was a prominent
scholar and teacher of the Baha’i religion who specialized in Islam, particularly Qur’anic and hadith
prophecy, which were some of the subjects he taught at IABS.

From a young age, he taught Baha’u’llah’s Kitab-i-Aqdas and Kitab-i-Iqan, often travelling from Isfahan to
Najafabad to deepen other Baha’is in those books. Later in life, he was appointed as an itinerant teacher
(muballigh-i sayyār). Throughout his life, he transcribed tablets and works of the Central Figures of the
Baha’i religion. With his calligraphy, he copied the Kitab-i-Aqdas 95 times. In April 1957, he left Iran for the
Gambia to serve as a Baha’i pioneer. He stayed there until 1977, when he returned to Iran to be of help to
his mother-in-law. Around the same time, he started serving as a teacher at IABS until he passed away in
April 1978.37

Jalal Dini (1910–1978)
Jalal Dini was born in 1910 into a Muslim family in Zanjan. During his childhood and youth, he exhibited
great interest in Islamic hadith and had a strong desire to learn Arabic – two qualities for which he became
known during his life as he engaged in deep study of the Baha’i writings. When Dini was 16 years old, he
attended a religious school to become a cleric. About two years later, his father, Aqa Khalil Dini, learned
about the Baha’i religion and became a devout follower. For over two years, the young Dini vehemently

opposed his father about converting to a ‘heretical sect’ and attempted to persuade his younger brothers
and sisters to defy their father and sever ties with him, even though they all lived under the same roof.
About a year later, Dini attended a fireside by a respected Baha’i teacher named Mr Mouhebat, who was
traveling through Zanjan. He deliberated on what he had learned at that fireside and converted to the Baha’i
religion the next day. From that point on, he and his father remained under constant surveillance. They
were often taken to the police department for questioning and interrogation, and were occasionally
imprisoned for days and weeks at a time.

A few years after his conversion to the Baha’i religion, Dini moved to Tehran and enrolled in a military
school, where he eventually became an officer. While continuing to participate in various Baha’i activities
in Tehran, he married and started a family with Esmat Mahdi. In 1953, he was transferred to Kermanshah
for a military post as a colonel. He continued teaching the Baha’i religion in Kermanshah and held regular
study classes on the writings of Baha’u’llah and ‘Abdu’l-Baha for the Baha’i community there.

In 1961, Dini was transferred back to Tehran and, among other things, worked with Ahmad Yazdani to
prepare some Arabic Baha’i texts for publication.

Like Fananapazir, Dini was also a scholar of the Qur’an and Muslim hadith. He taught Qur’an classes at
IABS using Tafsīr-i Sāf ī, a well-known Shi’ite exegesis of the Qur’an. Dini passed away on 14 January
1978 at the age of 68.38

Jalal Dini.

Other IABS Faculty
In addition to the regular teachers, several other individuals also served as adjunct faculty. Among these
were:

•      Dr Mashallah Moshrefzadeh (1930–2015), who taught Western philosophy
•      Mr Hesam al-Din Nuqaba’i (1927–1986), who taught world religions
•      Dr Jamshid Fanaian (1937–), who taught the English writings of Shoghi Effendi

Conclusion
The seeds of Baha’i scholarship germinated in Persia with the efforts and works of a handful of Persian
scholars, who were primarily concerned with defence of their faith against attacks by Shi’ite clerics,
Christian missionaries and others who considered the religion a heresy. Their publications provided ample
resources for the establishment of Baha’i Studies and teacher training classes. From the 1950s, the scope
of these classes began to gradually widen and include such subjects as world religions, Islamic Studies,

mysticism, Qur’anic studies and Arabic language and grammar. In the mid-1970s, thanks primarily to the
pioneering work of Dr ‘Ali Murad Davudi and his colleagues, Baha’i studies gained the rigour of an academic
institution through the establishment of IABS in 1976. This institute was specifically established to prepare
and nurture the next generation of Baha’i scholars in Iran. While students who initially attended IABS were
mostly college students from different institutions of higher education in Tehran, the ultimate goal was to
transform IABS into a full-blown Baha’i college or university that students across the country could choose
as an alternative – rather than a complement – to a secular school. There were also plans to facilitate the
travel and residency of some Baha’i students from other cities to Tehran so they could attend IABS.

Although the Islamic Revolution of 1979 resulted in the closure of IABS as a public Baha’i institution of
higher education, IABS did succeed in bringing together some of the greatest scholars and teachers of the
Baha’i religion in Iran for about three years. Moreover, despite the fact that the Revolution interrupted the
development of what could have been the first Baha’i college or university in Iran, IABS managed to cultivate
a love for Baha’i scholarship in the hearts of some of the Baha’i youth in Iran. To this day, some of the
former students of IABS are still pursuing Baha’i scholarship in different parts of the globe. Additionally,
after the Islamic Revolution, the pursuit of the goals of IABS continued inside and outside Iran. For the next
20 years, a post-secondary institution offering advanced Baha’i Studies operated inside Iran. A large
number of young Baha’i students attended the rigorous classes of this new institution. Many finished the
structured curricula and published their own theses.39

Additionally, thanks to a personal initiative by Dr Muhammad Afnan, the former IABS faculty member – and
with the approval of the Universal House of Justice – the Persian Institute for Baha’i Studies, which operates
under the supervision of the National Spiritual Assembly of Canada, was established in Dundas, Ontario in
1985\.

3 He was given the title of Sadr al-Sudūr (Foremost Among the Distinguished) by ‘Abdu'l- Baha. It took many months of rigorous
discussions with numerous Baha’is in two cities (Hamadan and Tehran) to eventually win over Sadr al-Sudūr to the new religion. In
his Tārīkh-i Had. rat-i Sadr al-Sudūr [The Chronicle of the Esteemed, Sadr al-Sudūr], Unpublished Manuscript, Mu’assisih-yi Millī-yi
Mat. bu’āt-i Amrī (The National Baha'i Publishing Trust of Iran), 108 BE/1951, 21–37, a digital copy is available through Iran’s online
Parliament Library: http://www.icnc.ir/index.aspx?pid=289&metadataId=131f4ecd-e477-4c4c-8552-96eb2606c5ec. Rastigar notes
that Sadr al-Sudūr first learned of the new religion through a certain Hajī Hakīm Mūsā, who was a Baha’i of Jewish origin and served
as Sadr al-Sudūr’s family physician. Hakīm, who had himself been converted by Gulpāygānī, held a teaching session with Sadr al-
Sudur at the home of Hājī Mihdī Arjmand in Hamadan. Later, when Sadr al-Sudūr moved to Tehran to continue his religious
education, he met other Baha’is through Mīrzā Sulaymān Semsār, who was recommended by Hakīm and – after months of
investigation – joined the new religion. Rastigar evidently heard the conversion story from Mīrzā Na‘īm Sidihī, the well-known Baha’i
poet who resided in Tehran at the time. Na‘īm – along with some of the Hands of the Cause and brothers Nayyir and Sinā, also
poets – were all engaged in teaching the Faith to Sadr al-Sudūr. On the night of conversion, the three aforementioned Baha’i poets
and Shaykh Muhammad-‘Alī Qā’inī (see below) were present in a private teaching session with Sadr al-Sudūr. After long
discussions, the final turning point for Sadr al-Sudūr was apparently hearing the recitation of sections of ‘Abdu’l-Baha’s Lawh-i
Khurārsān chanted by Qa’inī in a melodious tone. However, Yūnis Khān-i Afrūkhtih, in Khātirāt-i Nuh-Sālih-yi ‘Akkā, Los Angeles:
Kalimát Press, 1983 125–132, gives a different story of the night of conversion. Afrūkhtih indicates that Mīrzā ‘Abdu’llāh Farāhānī,
the famous Qājār court musician who had become a Baha’i as a youth, had also held talks with Sadr al-Sudūr in Tehran. Due to his
notoriety as a court musician, Farāhānī was presumably hiding his religious identity from most people. Later, Arastou Khān-i Hakīm,
a Baha’i physician in Tehran, contacted Afrūkhtih and invited him to hold additional teaching sessions with Sadr al-Sudūr along with
Mīrzā ‘Abdu’llāh. Afrūkhtih agreed and met with Sadr al-Sudūr at the home of Mīrzā ‘Abdu’llāh, where Sadr al-Sudūr eventually
accepted the new religion after a moving experience that led all three individuals to burst into tears. What seems clear from these
conflicting reports of Sadr al-Sudūr’s conversion is that it took efforts by numerous individuals over a relatively long period of time to
win him over. This is not surprising, considering the fact that Sadr al-Sudūr was an erudite man who practiced unfettered search
after the truth. Therefore, his initial interest, perhaps even one of these confirmations of faith, may have come across to some
Baha’is as wholehearted acceptance of the new religion. However, for a while in Tehran, Sadr al-Sudūr was also attracted to
Sufism, and went so far as being ‘initiated into the Ni‘matu’llahi Sufi order, rising to the position of pīr-i dalīl [a station in the Sufi
order reserved for individuals who serve as intermediary between the Sufi guide and his disciples]. See Moojan Momen, The Baha’i
Communities of Iran, 1851–1921, Vol 1: The North of Iran, Oxford: George Ronald, 2015, 97.

‘Abdu’l-Baha’s western travels. In a telegram to Aqa Muhammad Taqi Isfahani in Egypt, ‘Abdu'l-Baha instructs him to prepare the
