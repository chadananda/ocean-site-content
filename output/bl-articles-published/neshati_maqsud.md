                     The Tablet of Maqsúd (Law˙-i-Maqsúd)
Guidance on human nature and leadership

Ramin Neshati

Introduction

he Tablet of Maqsúd is a monumentally significant missive in the corpus of Bahá’u’lláh’s

T     revelatory texts.1 It is addressed to a certain Mírzá Maqsúd, a Persian Bahá’í residing in

Syria. In this Tablet, transcribed2 by Mírzá Áqá Ján circa late-18813 at Bahjí, Bahá’u’lláh
amalgamates advice and admonition drawn from earlier tablets with some uniquely instructive
pronouncements on a host of noteworthy topics including human potential and its efflores-
cence through the knowledge of God, the achievement of peace by means of disarmament, the
demand that leadership and political statesmanship be based on wisdom, equity and justice,
and other related topics. As with most post-Aqdas era works, its tone is majestic and its themes
are of universal significance and interest. Shoghi Effendi Rabbani numbered this Tablet as
amongst those Bahá’u’lláh revealed to further explain the core precepts and principles of His
teachings, to reiterate previously proclaimed truths and to augment some of the laws of the
Kitáb-i-Aqdas.4 In this paper, I intend to elaborate on some of Bahá’u’lláh’s counsels and to
examine their relevance vis-à-vis contemporary global circumstances. Following a synopsis of
the Tablet, I will attempt to explore two of its overarching and inextricably-coupled concepts:
1.   The innate nobility of human nature and the means for the full realization of its

potential, and
2.   The essential attributes of leadership, their relevance to the pursuit of justice and

peace, and the duties devolved to a leader.
While these are not the only topics, nor do they comprise the sole arguments, of far-reach-
ing interest advanced by Bahá’u’lláh in this weighty Tablet, yet they succinctly and compre-
hensively encapsulate its core message. Bahá’u’lláh touches on many intriguing topics which,
owing to space constraints, will be omitted from this brief review to maintain focus on the
selected themes.

Synopsis
The following is an abridged, sequential outline of the Tablet:

Prophets are necessary intermediaries between God and creation. Mankind stands in need of
guidance from his creator, but God is invulnerable and self-sufficient. Without divine messen-
gers humanity remains oblivious to the trust bestowed upon him. Mankind is recognized as the
‘supreme Talisman’ ( Tilism-i-a’zam), but he needs divine education for his true worth to be
uncovered and for his character to be polished and refined.

Bahá’u’lláh acknowledges the receipt of Maqsúd’s letter after showering prolific praise upon
Mu˙ammad, the prophet of Islam, and upon His kindred and companions.

Concerned about the dismal state of human affairs, Bahá’u’lláh regrets and is mystified by
the irony of a heedless world turning a deaf ear to His healing message, while stigmatizing Him
with mischief for its own misfortunes.

The graciousness and the unified action of world leaders are preconditions for justice. On a
related note, reward and punishment form the twin pillars upon which world order is estab-
lished and which usher in just and equitable conditions for all who dwell on earth.

Reaffirming the notion of collective security and the promotion of peace and tranquility,
Bahá’u’lláh calls for a conclave of the world’s rulers and statesmen, led by the ‘Great Powers,’
to put up a united front against nefarious and aggressive elements in society. Armaments are
hence reduced and only maintained for defensive purposes. It is worth mentioning that He
acknowledges the need for a deterrent force as a counter-balance to would-be rogue regimes.

Reflecting on the necessity for a universal language and script, instituted through a consul-
tative process led by a representative group of scholars and leaders of thought, He makes its
promulgation and promotion incumbent upon all ‘men of insight.’

The exercise of justice, balanced by wisdom and common sense, is requisite to successful
statesmanship.

Bahá’u’lláh underscores the plea for unity and the abandonment of discord, estrangement
and the pursuit of selfish and self-preserving schemes.

> Wisdom and common sense are the outcomes of consultation and compassion.

The pursuit of useful sciences, and not those that ‘begin with words and end in words,’ yield
optimum benefits to the civilized world. In effect, Bahá’u’lláh puts a damper on ventures in
mindless minutia such as those practiced by some Muslim ecclesiastics.

To avert injustice, moderation is mandatory upon all. This is especially applicable to those
in positions of power and influence.

> Tolerance and righteousness are required for a true understanding of divine mysteries.
> Learning and wisdom are as eyes giving sight to the body of mankind.

Speech must be influential and penetrating. Words should accompany deeds and be moder-
ated for best effect. Speech is endowed with a spirit and its misuse can be detrimental.

After responding to Maqsúd’s personal questions, Bahá’u’lláh ends the Tablet by urging and
encouraging the adoption of a virtuous life.

Let us now inquire into the two aforementioned themes: the nobility of human nature, and
the essential attributes and demands of leadership.
On human nature

Bahá’u’lláh hails mankind as the supreme talisman and reaffirms the divine conferral of a
latent gift to every soul. The realization of human aptitude and potential—that is, the discov-
ery of the latent gift—is contingent upon proper education. This education, by implication of
a spiritual nature,5 is comprised of exhortations, guidance, instructions and teachings brought
forth through the agency of the divine messengers, acting as intermediaries between the cre-
ator and the world of creation. The reason Bahá’u’lláh cites for the necessity of such an educa-
tion is mankind’s incapacity to fully comprehend ( idrák) by himself that which is revealed in
the heavenly books. Spiritual education is a fundamental and constant human need and does
not vary with the appearance of successive messengers. Indeed, it is humanity’s inability and
impotence ( ghásir, ájiz) to understand and comprehend the heavenly books sans the assistance

\[124\] Tablet of Maqsúd

of God’s prophets that gives rise to the need for his spiritual education. Man, whom Bahá’u’lláh
has elsewhere termed ‘the most noble of all creation’ ( ashraf-i-makhlúqát), is endued and
entrusted with mysterious and latent gifts. The discovery of the possession and the full real-
ization of that with which he is charged is not possible save through spiritual training and edu-
cation. Bahá’u’lláh’s emphasis on spiritual education through revealed religion is further aug-
mented in the Tablet of Splendours, in particular the first Ishraq, where He says: “Should the
lamp of religion be obscured, chaos and confusion will ensue, and the lights of fairness and
justice, of tranquility and peace cease to shine.”6

There is a delicate balance in Bahá’u’lláh’s depiction of human nature: while man is termed
the supreme talisman—the implication being that he trumps other forms of earthly life—yet in
matters of the spirit he falls short in perception and understanding of the mystical realms by
himself, and is in acute need of the assistance of divine messengers to fathom their inner mean-
ings. Even in simple earthly matters, lacking such training, man is not immune from descend-
ing to base and beastly behavior. Commenting on this point, Abdul-Bahá brings to light that
“. . . education is of three kinds: material, human and spiritual.”7 The pinnacle of human
achievement is the attainment of spiritual education, for it is through this alone that human-
ity can distinguish and differentiate itself from other forms of life. The role of the Educator is
to impart divine knowledge so as to “educate the human reality that it may become the center
of the divine appearance, to such a degree that the attributes and the names of God shall be
resplendent in the mirror of the reality of man.”8

What is the latent gift bestowed to mankind and what does the phrase supreme talisman sig-
nify? For the first answer, let us examine Bahá’u’lláh’s Hidden Words.9 As a representative sam-
ple (and not an exhaustive survey), we find that in the Arabic Hidden Words, number 12, He
states: “O Son of Being! With the hands of power I made thee and with the fingers of strength
I created thee; and within thee have I placed the essence of My light.” Again, in the Arabic
Hidden Words, number 22 He says: “O Son of Spirit! Noble have I created thee . . . ” and in
number 69, He says: “O Ye Sons of Spirit! Ye are My treasury, for in you I have treasured the
pearls of My mysteries and the gems of My knowledge.” In the Persian Hidden Words, number
29, He states: “O Son of Bounty! Out of the wastes of nothingness, with the clay of My com-
mand I made thee to appear, and have ordained for thy training every atom in existence and
the essence of all created things.” In His Will and Testament, Bahá’u’lláh declares: “Great and
blessed is this Day—the Day in which all that lay latent in man hath been and will be made man-
ifest. Lofty is the station of man were he to hold fast to righteousness and truth and to remain
firm and steadfast to the Cause.”10 In the yet-to-be-translated Tablet to Manikji, Bahá’u’lláh
states (my provisional rendering): “The soul is the treasury of My Mystery; do not surrender it
to avarice . . . ” ( ján ganjíniy-i ráz-i man ast ú rá bidast-i áz maspáríd).11 Finally, in this and
in other tablets of the same era, Bahá’u’lláh advises us to “Regard man as a mine rich in gems
of inestimable value.”12

In the above passages, Bahá’u’lláh confirms the greatness of mankind and the nobility of his
creation, yet He makes man’s eminence conditional upon resolute faith in Him—in other words,
spiritual training revealed through God’s intermediaries. This notion is rooted in the Báb’s
Writings. In the Persian Bayán, commenting on man’s inherent potentialities, He says: “Man’s
highest station, however, is attained through faith in God in every Dispensation and by accep-
tance of what hath been revealed by Him . . . ”13 As for man being the supreme talisman, the
reference has less to do with physical objects such as amulets ( hayákil) and charms ( ahráz), or
to the science of gematria. Rather, it sustains the assertion that to everyone is given the poten-
tial to rise to the rank of the Perfect Man.14 Bábis and early Bahá’ís wore or carried with them

Lights of ‘Irfán Book Four

lockets, rings and other objects engraved with signs and symbols or containing fragments of
holy writings, prayers and invocations expressly revealed for special occasions. These were
deemed to have talismanic powers in repelling malevolent, evil spirits and in bringing protec-
tion and blessings to their bearer. In this Tablet, it is likely that Bahá’u’lláh uses talisman as a
literary device to elevate the station of man to that of a higher form of life vested with myste-
rious elements—an enthralled being! The potential to rise above the baser self is only realized
through spiritual education. In the Aqdas, Bahá’u’lláh confirms that He has come to educate
mankind “for naught but the protection of your own selves and the elevation of your sta-
tions.”15 He goes on to state that the mission of all the Prophets has been “to nurture the trees
of human existence with the living waters of uprightness and understanding, that there may
appear from them that which God hath deposited within their inmost selves . . . The purpose
of these educators, in all they said and taught, was to preserve man’s exalted station.”16

We can deduce, therefore, that the latent gift bestowed to mankind is the ‘essence’ of divine
Light, the ‘pearls’ of divine Mysteries and the ‘gems’ of divine Knowledge. In expounding on
the purpose of creation, Bahá’u’lláh attests that it is for the attainment of the true under-
standing of God ( maqsúd az áfarínish irfán-i ˙aq búdih).17
On leadership

Bahá’u’lláh’s poignant reflection on the state of human affairs, its forlorn leadership and its
collective failure to settle conflicts peacefully and with due attention to justice, forms the
other theme being examined in this brief review. There is an unambiguous connection between
the demands of leadership with the disposition of those being led. Bahá’u’lláh’s sanguine vision
for a peaceful, unified world is predicated on the graceful acquiescence of humanity to leader-
ship that is itself informed by wisdom and humility, and driven with a keen sense of equity and
justice.

The decades leading to the revelation of this Tablet were witness to violent clashes and con-
flicts around the world.18 The Great Powers of the time—Britain and Russia—were occupied
with imposing their might and control far beyond their recognized borders. This rampant
march of colonialism and the ensuing assertion of ethnic and nationalistic pride by those bear-
ing the brunt of imperial exploitations was a major cause of regional unease.19 The self-serv-
ing, colonial games in which Britain, Russia, France and other major powers of the time
indulged themselves heralded a rapid deterioration in the plight of the subjugated masses.
Economically, conditions were slowly but surely improving for a greater share of the people in
the West. As industrial expansion picked up steam and the decline of feudalism and dynastic
rule gave way to more liberal and democratic governance, a renewed sense of optimism per-
vaded some Western nations and with it the hopeful signs of equitable and egalitarian prospects
for a greater share of their denizens. The same, sadly, did not hold true for the rest of the world.
In this Tablet, Bahá’u’lláh expresses disappointment that the din and noise of wars and revolu-
tions have drowned out His healing message. He calls for the establishment of a global con-
clave of world leaders to collectively engage in reforms, to cohesively put out rogue and unjust
aggression, to consistently trim offensive armaments, retaining only minimal amounts neces-
sary for defensive purposes, and to coherently promote universal peace (the ‘Great Peace’)
through dialog and consultation. Bahá’u’lláh’s call is all-embracing and not hemmed in by the
bounds of geographic or ethnic divides.

Over the past century we have witnessed the steady coalescence of the international com-
munity via the intercessions of the now-defunct League of Nations, the current United Nations
(and its many affiliated agencies) as well as the various military and economic partnerships such

\[126\] Tablet of Maqsúd

as the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, the European Union, and so on.20 These sputtering
efforts at cooperation and the bringing together of human civilization have yielded a few tan-
gible results. Among the pertinent examples of the united endeavors of world leaders is the
manner in which conflicts have been dimmed in Europe and Africa, and more recently in the
Persian Gulf, the Balkans and other trouble spots. Although not with entirely reliable or uni-
formly positive outcomes, yet most statesmen have taken resolute steps to address endemic
global problems such as the alarming buildup of armaments, racism and discrimination, eth-
nic and religious tensions, environmental pollution and degradation, drug abuse, the rapid
spread of deadly diseases, hunger and malnutrition, etcetera. They have introduced and main-
tained deterrents to curb the arbitrary belligerence of strongmen and dictators and have coun-
tered the naked aggression of some of the more flagrantly seditious tyrants and fanatics with
decisive undertakings. In the process, they have come to fulfill Bahá’u’lláh’s call that “Should
any king take up arms against another, all should unitedly arise and prevent him” ( agar malikí
bar malikí bar khízad jamí’ mottafighan bar man’ ghíyám namáyand).21 Their work is far from
done but the machinery of communal action is in gear and, one would hope, irreversible—albeit
at times faltering and beset with bias. Filtering the clashes and catastrophes of the past centu-
ry through the lens of Bahá’u’lláh’s predictions, we can begin to grasp the relevance and the
urgency of His plea for impartial, graceful, just and balanced leadership.

In 1875 Abdul-Bahá penned a treatise known as “The Secret of Divine Civilization”
addressed to the people and government of Persia.2 2 Referring to rulers who are known for
their sense of justice and who champion the cause of human rights, Abdul-Bahá states that their
station in the sight of God is second only to that of His prophets.23 Abdul-Bahá recalls the hor-
rific events of the Franco-Prussian War and laments over the senseless destructions and the
tragic loss of human life. He is puzzled over mankind’s inability to learn from these mistakes
and expresses alarm at the invention of even deadlier armaments and instruments of warfare.24
Appealing to the greatness of the Persian nation by alluding to its pre-Islamic glory, He argues
for the redirection of resources into rebuilding the nation’s infrastructure, reforming its edu-
cational system, renewing its social welfare apparatus, and so on. In short, Abdul-Bahá echoes
the essence of Bahá’u’lláh’s message of enlightened and progressive leadership rooted in the
principles of justice and equity.

Bahá’u’lláh underscores the necessity for the leader to exercise self-moderation, wisdom and
common sense in advancing the common good. The leader is one who makes judicious use of
rewards and punishments to arbitrate and mitigate conflicts. In the eight Ishraq—an integral
part of the Aqdas—He reiterates: “O people of God! That which traineth the world is Justice,
for it is upheld by two pillars, reward and punishment”25 Further, Bahá’u’lláh re-reveals many
of the themes found in this Tablet, mainly the two discussed in this paper, in the Tablet of the
World.26
Conclusion

By reaffirming the necessity of spiritual education for the fulfillment of the intrinsic great-
ness of mankind, Bahá’u’lláh unfurls His vision for world peace by accentuating the attribut-
es of enlightened leadership. In this Tablet, the former theme (nobility of creation) becomes the
antecedent of and a prerequisite for the attainment of the latter ( peace through progressive
leadership). He unequivocally designates and commits to the leaders and statesmen the formi-
dable task of training the nations under their charge and calls on them to cooperatively estab-
lish peace and security. Other themes such as the efficacy of moderated speech, the appeal for
reforms, the need for long-term vision and planning, the abandonment of estrangement, the
inexorableness of a common language and script and so on are, alas, omitted from considera-

Lights of ‘Irfán Book Four

tion due to the limited scope of this paper. Above all, His emphasis on the need for limits to
liberty and civilization, the excess of which can exercise a “pernicious influence upon men,”
requires meticulous attention and study. Further elaboration on this point appears in the ninth
Leaf of the Words of Paradise.27 It can be argued that in this and other tablets of the same era
Bahá’u’lláh anticipates the fall of despotic, tyrannical rule and the rise of democratically elect-
ed governments and leaders. He awaits the “high endeavours” of political statesmen to lead
humanity in beneficial pursuits. Correlating the concept of leadership as articulated here with
some of His other writings, we find that in a final, remarkable gesture towards the rulers and
kings ( mulúk), Bahá’u’lláh calls on the trustees of God (i.e. the yet-to-be-formed Universal
House of Justice) to pray for them and affirms that the rulership of the world is entrusted to
their care, while the hearts of men are set aside for Himself.28

With guidance to political leaders for the establishment of peace and tranquility through
consultation and mutual respect, Bahá’u’lláh re-reveals and weaves together many of the themes
He has enunciated in various other writings. This coherent collage of exhortations—for the
spiritual education and advancement of humanity, for the reconciliation of nations and for
unprejudiced leadership—stands out as the most distinguishing feature of this Tablet. What
makes it all the more riveting is its bearing on global events in more recent times—its core mes-
sage being as fresh and relevant now as it was over a century and half ago! More than a simple
response to a private letter of a bewildered believer, the Tablet of Maqsúd surely ranks among
the “choicest fruits” emanating from the Supreme Pen.
