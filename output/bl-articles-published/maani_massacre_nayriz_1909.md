> **Abstract:** At the turn of the twentieth century the people of Iran, tired of despotic regimes and the inordinate influence of the clergy, demanded changes in the way the country was governed. Their struggles for democratic reform bore fruit when Muzaffiri’d-Din Shah Qajar signed the decree in 1906 for the establishment of parliament and for constitutional monarchy to replace absolute rule by the sovereign. He died shortly after signing the decree. His successor, Muhammad-'Ali Shah dissolved the parliament and tried to reestablish dictatorship. Iranians arose again, dethroned him, and brought to power his underage son, Ahmad Shah. The incessant fighting between the proponents of democracy and their opponents, the entanglement of the government in disputes that ensued, and the rule of self-seeking and inexperienced kings weakened the central government and gave rise to lawlessness. The situation was particularly dire in places further away from the capital, where rebels exploited existing tribal rivalries, unfurled the banner of rebellion against the government, plundered properties, established themselves in the name of Islam, and used their triumph as license to declare holy war on defenseless Bahá’ís. The worst affected area was Nayriz and its surroundings.
> 
> Mirza Muhammad-Shafi Rouhani, author of the history of the Bábí-Bah’a’í Faith in Nayriz, titled _Lama'atu’l-Anvar, Depicting the Soul-Stirring Episodes of Nayriz,_ was twelve years old when the Bahá’ís of Nayriz were engulfed in a raging battle between the supporters of Shaykh Dhakariyya and forces of the local government, which suffered defeat and left the Bahá’ís of Nayriz at the mercy of the rebels. Many Bahá’ís left their homes and took refuge in hiding places outside the town. The victors offered monetary reward to anyone who killed a Bahá’í male ten years and older and produced his head as evidence. The reward was three times higher when a male Bahá’í was arrested and delivered alive. Women and children, including boys under ten, were granted amnesty. Mirza Muhammad-Shafi’s father was then in the Holy Land on pilgrimage. As he was unable to keep pace with the men who were fleeing on foot for a place of safety many miles away, his mother dressed him as a girl and together with the women of the family left their hiding place and returned to town. He has left a vivid description of what transpired before, during and immediately after Shaykh Dhakariyya’s rebellion, which culminated in the martyrdom of nineteen Bahá’ís on Naw-Ruz 1909, the day that witnessed one of 'Abdu’l-Bahá’s most remarkable achievements of His ministry, the interment of the remains of the Báb in the Mausoleum He had built on Mount Carmel in Haifa for the purpose. That description and some related matters form the contents of this paper.

Eyewitness Account of the Massacre of

Bahá’ís in Nayriz on the Naw-Ruz
`Abdu’l-Bahá Interred the Remains of

The Báb on Mount Carmel

Baharieh Rouhani Maani

Naw-Ruz 1909 is a significant landmark in the history of the
first Bahá’í century. `Abdu’l-Bahá chose the festive occasion to
accomplish a most sacred task entrusted to Him by His Father.
The task was the interment of the remains of the Báb in a
specific spot in the heart of Mount Carmel in Haifa. When
Bahá’u’lláh assigned the task to His Most Great Branch, the
remains of the Báb were still in Iran and the land on which a
befitting Mausoleum for the purpose was to be built had not
yet been acquired. The accomplishment of the task became one
of the principle objectives of `Abdu’l-Bahá’s ministry. This
objective and that of His trip to the West achieved within a
short period after He gained freedom from decades of exile and
incarceration are mysteriously linked. He undertook His
historic journey to Egypt and the West only after He had
successfully completed the original structure of the Shrine of
the Báb and ceremoniously interred the body of the martyred
Herald of Bahá’u’lláh’s revelation in the designated spot.
Another historic event took place thousands of miles away
during that historic Naw-Ruz: The believers in Nayriz were
targeted once again for adhering to the tenets of the nascent
Faith, and eighteen souls innocent of any wrongdoing were
tortured and put to death. `Abdu’l-Bahá links the interment of
the “sanctified body of His Holiness, the Báb … in the Shrine on
Mount Carmel” to the event in Nayriz. He says: “[S]acrifice was
necessary and martyrdom required … The loved ones in Nayriz …
won the trophy of excellence.”1

The Interment of the Remains of The Báb

Gripping as is the life and martyrdom of the Bab, the account
of the rescue of His body, its transfer to the Holy Land, and
interment in a spot designated by Bahá’u’lláh in the heart of
Mount Carmel sixty years later is no less fascinating. According
to Shoghi Effendi, “[T]he mangled bodies of the Báb and His
fellow-martyr, Mirza Muhammad-`Ali Zunuzi, were removed, in
the middle of the second night following their execution,
through the pious intervention of Haji Sulayman Khan, from
the edge of the moat where they had been cast to a silk factory
owned by one of the believers of Milan, and were laid the next
day in a wooden casket, and thence carried to a place of safety.
Subsequently, according to Bahá’u’lláh’s instructions, they were
transported to Tihran and placed in the shrine of Imam-Zadih
Hasan” [GPB 273]. The decision to transfer the remains to Tihran
“was prompted by the wish the Báb Himself had expressed in
the ‘Ziyarat-i-Shah `Abdu’l-`Azim,”2 in which, addressing the
buried saint, He says: “Well is it with you to have found your
resting-place in Rayy, under the shadow of My Beloved. Would
that I might be entombed within the precincts of that holy
ground!”3

It took sixty years from the date the bodies of the Báb and
His fellow-martyr were removed from the edge of the moat
outside Tabriz until they were finally interred in the Shrine on
Mount Carmel. During that time “by reason of the ascendancy
of the enemy, and from fear of the malevolent” the sacred
remains knew “neither rest nor tranquility” until “through the
mercy of the Abha Beauty” they were “ceremoniously deposited,
on the day of Naw-Ruz, within the sacred casket, in the exalted
Shrine on Mt. Carmel.”4 Early in His ministry, `Abdu’l-Bahá
arranged for the “precious Trust” to be transported to the Holy
Land. It was delivered into His hands on 31 January 1899 [GPB

\[274\] 
Immediately after the remains reached the Holy Land,
`Abdu’l-Bahá with great difficulty acquired the plot of land on
Mount Carmel, which Bahá’u’lláh had specified for the Resting
Place of the Báb’s remains, and began constructing the original
six rooms of the Shrine. With the intrigues employed by

Massacre of the Bahá’ís in Nayriz                                235

Covenant-breakers to abort or at least indefinitely delay the
completion of the project, it took nine years for the original
structure to be built. “Every stone of that building, every stone
of the road leading to it” `Abdu’l-Bahá “with infinite tears and
at tremendous cost, raised and placed in position” [GPB 275]. To
help the believers grasp the significance of this undertaking and
appreciate its vital importance, Shoghi Effendi says:

> `Abdu’l-Bahá Himself testified, on more than one
> occasion, that the safe transfer of these remains, the
> construction of a befitting mausoleum to receive them,
> and their final interment with His own hands in their
> permanent resting-place constituted one of the three
> principal objectives which, ever since the inception of
> His mission, He had conceived it His paramount duty
> to achieve. This act indeed deserves to rank as one of the
> outstanding events in the first Bahá’í century. [GPB 273]

The successful completion of this sacred undertaking
fulfilled an old prophecy in Zechariah: “Thus speaketh the Lord
of hosts, saying, Behold the man whose name is The Branch; and
he shall grow up out of his place, and he shall build the temple
of the Lord.”5 The enshrining of the remains of the Báb paved
the way for another remarkable achievement of `Abdu’l-Bahá’s
ministry: His trip to Egypt, North America and Europe. The
consummation of the second depended on the accomplishment
of the first and neither was possible without `Abdu’l-Bahá
gaining freedom from decades of exile and strict confinement.
His freedom could not be realized without drastic changes in
Iran and Turkey, two countries intent on uprooting the nascent
Cause of God or at least keeping its advancement in check. Had
the necessary changes occurred sooner, Abdu’l-Bahá would have
built the Báb’s Shrine, entombed His remains earlier, then
undertaken His trip to the West when He was younger and time
constraints were not so intense. Freedom came when `Abdu’l-
Bahá was sixty-six years old and His health impaired. Time was
of the essence. The world was moving toward the first
conflagration of international magnitude. With the
dethronement of Muhammad-`Ali Shah in Iran and Sultan
`Abdu’l-Hamid, the Ottoman Emperor, impediments to His
freedom were removed. Several months after achieving

236                                   Lights of ‘Irfán Book Fourteen

freedom, He with His own hands placed, during a moving
ceremony, the inner casket containing the sacred remains of the
Báb and His fellow-martyr in the marble sarcophagus prepared
by the Bahá’ís of Rangoon, Burma. The sarcophagus had arrived
and been placed beforehand in the vault of the Shrine, which
had been built for the purpose. The historic Naw-Ruz that
witnessed one of the most significant achievements of `Abdu’l-
Bahá’s ministry coincided with the martyrdom of eighteen
Bahá’ís in Nayriz.

In a visitation prayer revealed in 1909 in honor of the Bahá’í
martyrs of Nayriz, `Abdu’l-Bahá beseeches God to make their
blood the cause of the dissemination of divine signs, of the
appearance of mysteries and the shining of light in other lands.6
On the Naw-Ruz that witnessed the interment of the remains of
the Báb on Mount Carmel and the martyrdom of the Bahá’ís in
Nayriz, `Abdu’l-Bahá received the joyous news of the
convocation in Chicago of the first American Bahá’í
Convention and the election of the members of the Bahá’í
Temple Unity, a prelude to the election of the National Spiritual
Assembly of the United States and Canada, linking the
entombment of the remains of the Báb and the election of the
Bahá’í Temple Unity with the martyrdom of the believers in
Nayriz.

On the day of the entombment of the remains of the Bab,
three believers from Nayriz were among the eastern and western
pilgrims present at the ceremony.7 On that day `Abdu’l-Bahá
singled out the three Nayrizi pilgrims for special consideration.
The outpourings of His loving kindness vouchsafed to these
three pilgrims astonished the recipients and everyone present.
After the ceremony, `Abdu’l-Bahá announced that there was
room in His carriage for three people. Not wishing to show
favoritism, He asked that a lot be drawn. The drawn names were
those of the three pilgrims from Nayriz. These friends were well
aware of their unworthiness and of the presence at the gathering
of devoted and outstanding believers from the east and the
west, so they could not fathom the significance of `Abdu’l-Bahá
focusing His special attention on them. The following day,
`Abdu’l-Bahá went for a walk along the seashore and took with
Him the pilgrims from Nayriz. As He was walking, He looked at

Massacre of the Bahá’ís in Nayriz                              237

the sea and spoke of a storm. Seeing the calm sea, the Nayrizi
pilgrims thought `Abdu’l-Bahá was speaking of a storm in the
making. `Abdu’l-Bahá repeated: “The sea is stormy, very
stormy.” He then turned to the pilgrims and said you are
dismissed. Tomorrow you return home. He gave them specific
instructions how to proceed and said: Tarry not anywhere until
you reach home.8

The Mystery of Sacrifice

Shortly after the martyrdom of the believers in Nayriz during
Naw-Ruz 1909, `Abdu’l-Bahá revealed a Tablet. In it He speaks
of the heroism of the friends, of the atrocities they suffered and
the effect of the pure blood that was shed there. The Tablet
leaves no doubt that the martyrdom of those lovers of the
Blessed Beauty was a ransom for the highly remarkable
undertaking of His ministry, the interment of the sanctified
body of the Báb in its eternal resting place on Mount Carmel:

> O ye Friends of God! In these days Nayriz hath become
> the place for blood shedding. Sanctified souls among
> the loved ones of the Lord have sacrificed their lives
> and hastened to the field of martyrdom in the path of
> the conspicuous Light. For this the eyes are tearful and
> hearts burn with sorrow. Sobbing and sighs have soared
> to the highest heaven and extreme sadness hath caused
> lamentation to appear anew. `Abdu’l-Bahá’s highest
> wish is to quaff a drop of the chalice of faithfulness
> and to be intoxicated with the wine of sacrifice, that
> the end of His life may be the beginning of infinite
> grace…

> O ye friends of `Abdu’l-Bahá! In these days, through a
> felicitous event and confirmations from the Lord of the
> highest Heaven, as well as assistance from the unseen
> Kingdom, the sanctified body of His Highness, the Bab,
> was interred in its Shrine on Mount Carmel. Therefore,
> sacrifice was necessary and martyrdom required. The
> loved ones in Nayriz, inebriated by this brimming
> chalice and with the rod of high resolve, have won the
238                                     Lights of ‘Irfán Book Fourteen

> trophy of excellence. Happy are they and blessed is this
> chalice, which is overflowing with the wine of the love
> of God. Upon them be the Glory of God…9

The necessity of sacrifice and the requirement of martyrdom
in relation to the interment of the remains of the Báb and its
linkage to what the Bahá’ís of Nayriz suffered highlight the
significance of a phenomenon strongly present in the early
history of the Bahá’í Faith. The tree of the Cause of God has
indeed been nurtured with the blood of martyrs. Before His
declaration, the Báb offered up His only son, Ahmad, as a
sacrifice. Thousands of believers met their death and many more
thousands sacrificed everything they possessed for the
promotion of His Cause. He later offered His own life in the
path of the One Whose Advent He had come to herald. Two
decades later Bahá’u’lláh sacrificed His saintly son, Mirza
Mihdi, for the realization of the lofty ideals of His Cause, while
He was incarcerated together with His family and companions
in the army barracks in `Akka. Nearly two years had passed since
they had arrived there and lived under stringent restrictions. No
change in their situation was in sight. The few pilgrims who
spent months travelling on foot to attain Bahá’u’lláh’s presence
had to be content with seeing the movement of His hand from a
distance, then retrace their steps. For the doors of the prison to
open, for some relief to come to Bahá’u’lláh, His family and
companions, for the pilgrims to attain the presence of their Best
Beloved, a mighty sacrifice was required. That sacrifice was the
sanctified life of the Purest Branch, the youngest son of
Bahá’u’lláh and Asiyyih Khanum. “His dying supplication to a
grieving Father was that his life might be accepted as a ransom
for those who were prevented from attaining the presence of
their Beloved” [GPB 188]. Prison doors opened four months after
his martyrdom.

The Purest Branch’s sacrifice served other purposes. The
quickening of the world and the unification of its inhabitants
owe their realization to Bahá’u’lláh offering up His beloved son
as a ransom: “I have, O my Lord, offered up that which Thou
hast given Me, that Thy servants may be quickened, and all that
dwell on earth be united” [GPB 188].

Massacre of the Bahá’ís in Nayriz                            239

The Uprising of Shaykh Dhakariyya Kuhistani

The episode that led to the massacre of eighteen Bahá’ís in
Nayriz during Naw-Ruz 1909 has become known as the uprising
of Shaykh Dhakariyya, for it was under his command that the
rebel forces living in the Kuhistan region surrounding Nayriz
launched an attack on the town, wreaked havoc on the Bahá’í
inhabitants, and massacred the male believers they laid their
hands on. Rebels invariably thrive when chaos and confusion
reign. When the government is strong, the officials are just and
the rule of law is observed, they keep a low profile, ever ready
to take advantage when the ingredients for security are absent.

The quest for freedom from the despotic rule of the Qajar
kings began in Iran almost simultaneously with the Advent of
the Báb in the mid-nineteenth century and culminated in the
constitutional revolution in the early years of the twentieth
century. The Advent of the Báb awakened the people of Iran to
the potentialities inherent in human beings and raised their
awareness of the glorious destiny awaiting the human race. His
teachings spread throughout the country and beyond startling
the ecclesiastics and government leaders alike. The
transformative power of His revelation changed the inner
realities and outward conduct of His followers, which
continued to grow after His execution in 1850. Thousands of
His followers were put to death, and Bahá’u’lláh, the most
prominent and influential of all, was forced to leave the
country and spend the rest of His life in exile. Some fair-minded
scholars have begun assessing the influence of the Báb’s
teachings on the movement for reform in Iran. Future historians
and analysts, unbiased and impartial, will no doubt cover in
detail the crucial contribution that His Advent, as well as that
of Bahá’u’lláh and the writings of `Abdu’l-Bahá, have made to
social and political change in that land and beyond.

The constitutional revolution created a fertile ground in Iran
for the proponents and opponents of democracy to get
entangled in their opposing ideologies and fight for priorities
that served their selfish ends. `Abdu’l-Bahá was in constant
communication with the believers and provided guidance that
protected them from falling a victim to the intrigues employed

240                                   Lights of ‘Irfán Book Fourteen

by self-seeking individuals on either side. The volume of Tablets
revealed during that period testifies to the precariousness for
the Bahá’ís of the events that transpired. Muzaffari’d-Din
Shah’s willingness during his ministry (1896-1906) to allow some
measure of democracy to take hold afforded some relief to the
Bahá’ís in Iran and enabled them to promote the teachings of
Bahá’u’lláh with less stringent restrictions. The atmosphere was
favorable enough for `Abu’l-Bahá to send a Bahá’í delegation
consisting of Mr. Hippolyte Dreyfus and Lua Getsinger to meet
the Shah and his Prime Minister, Mirza `Ali Asghar Khan
Atabak, during the Shah’s second visit to Paris in 1902. The
purpose of the meeting was to seek restitution of Bahá’í rights
and appeal for justice. The relative calm during the rein of
Musaffari’d-Din Shah provided the people of Iran, including the
Bahá’ís, some measure of freedom to pursue independently
matters of conscience. As a result, people in high office and
from all walks of life, who wished to know about the Bahá’í
Faith, had the opportunity to do so without fear of severe
persecution.

The signing of the decree to adopt a constitution and
establish a parliament in 1906 presaged a new era of social and
political change in Iran. However, the Shah’s death immediately
after he signed the decree, his successor’s opposition to
democratic rule, and the blatant interference of foreign nations
in the internal affairs of the country, threw everything into
confusion and chaos ensued. Muhammad `Ali Shah, who
succeeded Muzaffri’d-Din Shah, disbanded the parliament and
sided with those who benefited from dictatorship. He was
dethroned by the proponents of democracy in 1909 and his son,
Ahmad, a minor when he came to power, ruled by proxy. These
rapid changes and deep-rooted ideological differences and
conflicts weakened the central government, emboldened
different factions and tribes who sought autonomy, and gave
rise to rebellion especially in areas farther away from the
capital. One such place was Nayriz, a small town situated about
228 kilometers to the south east of Shiraz.

Although a famous town in ancient Iran, when the Báb
declared His Mission in 1844, Nayriz was an obscure place on
the map of that country. What made it prominent again was the

Massacre of the Bahá’ís in Nayriz                            241

heroism of the Bábís of the town who fought alongside Jinab-i-
Vahid in the Fort of Khajih and defended their right to adhere
to a new system of belief they considered the pathway to
individual and collective transformation and salvation. That
episode ended on 29 June 1850, ten days before the Báb’s
martyrdom, but the heroism of the believers did not end there.
After Jinab-i Vahid and many valiant souls were martyred, the
survivors of the Fort of Khajih episode were persecuted
mercilessly. The continuation of the atrocities committed
against the defenseless Bábí community reached unbearable
proportions when Zaynu’l-`Abidin Khan, the governor of
Nayriz responsible for the first upheaval and the continued
suffering of the believers, was murdered.

To escape the onslaught of a relentless enemy, the scattered
beleaguered believers took refuge in nearby mountains under
the leadership of `Ali Sardar, assisted by Khajih Qutba, two
young and brave souls who cared for the survivors of the first
Nayriz upheaval. Their congregation alarmed the governor, who
sent exaggerated reports to Shiraz and gathered an army to
force the Bábís into submission. This second upheaval became
known as Jang-i Jabal (Battle of Mountain), during which
nineteen strongholds each consisting of nineteen brave believers
engaged the combined forces of the government and tribal
factions living in the area. One of the strongholds was defended
solely by women under the leadership of Nanih Sami` (the
mother of Sami`).10 The believers fought heroically to the last
fighting man and woman. That episode occurred in 1852 and
coincided with the imprisonment of Bahá’u’lláh in the Siyah
Chal of Tihran and the intimation of His Mission in the
concluding months of that year. The survivors of the second
Nayriz upheaval, mostly old men, women and children, were
taken captive and sent to Shiraz, every two riding on the back
of an unsaddled horse, with the heads of martyrs on spears
parading before them. Most men suffered martyrdom at
different stages of the journey; the rest were executed in
Tihran. The women and children, after untold suffering, were
freed in Shiraz and abandoned to their fate. Many returned to
Nayriz, some remained in Shiraz. One of the survivors, a young
boy about twelve years old, named Muhammad-Shafi`, who had
lost his father and four paternal uncles in the first and second

Nayriz upheavals, was taken captive together with his mother
and grandfather. He and his mother were held in Shiraz; his
grandfather, Mirza `Abdu’l-Husayn, together with other male
survivors, continued the arduous journey toward Tihran.11

Muhammad-Shafi and his mother were among the women and
children captives who were freed in Shiraz and remained there.
Under the care of his mother he continued his education and
grew up to be a staunch and devoted believer. With the help of
the Imam Jum`ih, who knew his father and grandfather,
Muhammad-Shafi` became proficient in religious knowledge
necessary for holding responsible positions. Impressed with his
personality and demeanor, after the death of his grandson, the
Imam Jum`ih appointed Muhammad-Shafi` to the prestigious
position of the Imam (prayer leader) of Jami` mosque in
Nayriz.12 He then became known as Mullá Muhammad-Shafi`,
and served the people of his town and its surrounding areas with
integrity and distinction. He attained Bahá’u’lláh’s presence in
Baghdad and dedicated his life to the promotion of His Cause.
The many Tablets revealed in his honor testify to the
staunchness of his faith and to the selfless services he rendered.
He later wrote an account of the first and second upheavals in
Nayriz during the Bábí period and sent the original of his
manuscript to the Holy Land. Nabil bases his account of those
episodes on Mullá Muhammad-Shafi’s booklet.13 It is believed
that the account was written when Bahá’u’lláh directed Bahá’ís
with firsthand knowledge of historical events to prepare such
accounts and send them to the Holy Land. The original of Mulla
Muhammad-Shafi`’s manuscript has so far not been found. It
may have been among the material stolen by the Covenant-
breakers. The draft of the manuscript was destroyed during the
third episode, known as the uprising of Shaykh Dhakariyya.14
Fortunately by then a few transcripts had been made and were
held by certain individuals. Muhammad-Shafi` Rouhani, the
author of Lama`atu’l-Anvar and the father of this writer,
located one transcript in Rafsanjan in the province of Kirman,
which he used for writing the history of the Babi-Bahá’í Faith in
Nayriz.

An interval of more than half a century separates the second
Nayriz upheaval, known as Jang-i Jabal (Battle of Mountain),

from the third episode, known as the uprising of Shaykh
Dhakariyya. The lengthy lull in the cessation of hostilities has
been attributed to the wise leadership of Mulla Muhammad-
Shafi`. He established friendly relationship with governor Fath-
`Ali Khan, the son of Zaynu’l-`Abidin Khan.15 The two entered
into a formal agreement, which both sides honored to the end
of their lives. The provisions of the agreement provided for
mutual understanding and respect, and for disputes to be settled
through negotiation, not violence and armed conflict. The
friendly contacts between them led to the governor
investigating the truth of Bahá’u’lláh’s Claim and professing
belief in the tenets of His Faith. During his governorship the
general atmosphere in Nayriz changed and became so warm and
friendly between Bahá’ís and Muslims that a number of
prominent Bahá’í teachers were allowed to visit the place, teach
the Cause of God to people of all backgrounds, and
complement Mulla Muhammad-Shafi` in his efforts to promote
the nascent Faith and deepen the understanding of the friends in
Bahá’u’lláh’s teachings.16 As a result, the friends’ transition
from the Bábí to Bahá’í Faith was very smooth. The militant
Bábís of Nayriz accepted Bahá’u’lláh as the One for Whom the
Báb had sacrificed Himself, and changed their conduct to
comply with the tenets of His Cause, one of which was the
abolition of holy war. Their firmness in Bahá’u’lláh’s Covenant
passed the test when after His Ascension the opponents of
`Abdu’l-Bahá, His appointed Successor, tried hard but failed to
win their support.

Mulla Muhammad-Shafi’s eldest grandson and namesake, a
true heir of his grandfather in many respects, by a strange
coincidence was also twelve years old when the uprising of
Shaykh Dhakariyya took place. Like his grandfather, the young
Muhammad-Shafi’ made acquiring knowledge his lifelong quest,
became a committed Bahá’í, was steadfast like a solid rock in
the Covenant, and dedicated his life to the promotion of the
Cause of Bahá’u’lláh. One of his imperishable services has been
the writing of the history of the Bábí and Bahá’í Faiths in
Nayriz. After extensive search, as stated earlier, he found in
Rafsanjan in the province of Kirman a transcribed copy of his
grandfather’s booklet, gathered his own notes, located and
interviewed the living members of the families of survivors of

the earlier episodes, added his own observations of subsequent
events, and wrote Lama`atu’l-Anvar, Depicting the Soul-Stirring
Episodes of Nayriz.17 He also wrote his memoirs, entitled
Khatirat-i Talkh va Shirin (Bittersweet Memories) which were
published after his death. The following account is based
principally on these two sources.18

Eyewitness Account of the Massacre of
Bahá’ís in Nayriz During Naw-Ruz 1909

It was mid-March 1909 when the notorious rebel from the
Kuhistan region, Shaykh Dhakariyya, who had earned his
reputation by defying government regulations, by launching
attacks on defenseless people, plundering property, using
distortion to enrich himself and his supporters, even causing
bloodshed, engaged in armed conflict with the local government
of Nayriz. The attack did not happen in a vacuum. It was
carried out on orders from Haji Siyyid `Abdu’l-Husayn-i Lari,
the leader of the Shi`is of the area. His pretext was setting up a
national government and protecting Islam from undesirable
influences. It was several days before Naw-Ruz. Bahá’ís were
fasting and like all Iranians were preparing to embrace the New
Year. With the launching of the attack the festive mood turned
somber, then it became a nightmare for the Bahá’ís of the town
when on Naw-Ruz eve the Shaykh conquered an important fort
outside Nayriz and turned the attack, which until then the
inhabitants thought was political and against the local
government, into an onslaught against the Bahá’ís. That Naw-
Ruz coincided with the interment of the remains of the Báb in
the heart of Mount Carmel, fulfilling the sacred task Bahá’u’lláh
had entrusted to His Most Great Branch many years earlier.

That a rebel with meager resources and control over a tiny
part of the country could in the name of religion declare war on
a local governor installed and supported by the regime in power
and prevail is a tale beyond the scope of this paper. Suffice it to
say that during the rein of the Qajar kings, whom Iranians
considered usurpers of the crown, clergy in Iran gained
inordinate influence and meddled at will with matters of state
culminating in humiliating defeat for the country, the loss of

territory to Russia, intensification of the influence of foreign
powers, and causing widespread discontent. Disgusted with the
hopeless situation, Iranians rose up against despotism and
demanded reform. The movement for democracy gathered
momentum and yielded some tangible results in the early years
of the nineteenth century. The preoccupation with internal
struggles for social and political change and the rapid succession
of kings sapped whatever strength was left and exhausted the
energy needed to keep law and order in the country. When the
constitutional revolution was in full swing, in some provinces
certain elements took advantage of the weakness of the central
government and raised the banner of rebellion. Among them
were clerics who worked with tribal heads and looked for
opportunities to spread their influence. The deteriorated
security situation was a gift to the rebels who thrived when
chaos and confusion reigned. Some tribes revolted against the
central authority and wreaked havoc on the regions they
brought under their control. Nayriz was one of the worst
affected areas.

During the constitutional revolution `Abdu’l-Bahá provided
constant guidance to the Bahá’ís of Iran and warned them
emphatically against getting involved. As a result, the believers
kept clear of politics and continued promoting the teachings of
Bahá’u’lláh, revolving around the principle of the oneness of
humankind. The truce that Mulla Muhammad-Shafi` had
negotiated with Fath-`Ali Khan, the governor of Nayriz, years
earlier enabled prominent Bahá’í teachers to visit Nayriz,
provide spiritual sustenance to the believers, and guide eager
souls to the pathway of truth. The visit of the last two itinerant
teachers during this period, Mr. Tarazu’llah Samandari, later
appointed by Shoghi Effendi to the rank of a Hand of the Cause
of God, and Mr. Ali Akbar Rafsanjani,19 coincided with the
period leading to the uprising of Shaykh Dhakariyya. The
meetings held for these teachers were filled to capacity; even
rooftops were occupied. Some of the inhabitants of the town
started investigating the truth of Bahá’u’lláh’s Mission and
expressed interest in joining the Faith. This development roused
the animosity of the antagonists and determined them to do
what it took to stop the progress achieved. The deputy governor
of Nayriz, a friend of the Faith, secretly sent a message to the

Local Spiritual Assembly, apprised its members of the enemy’s
schemes, and advised that the best course of action was for the
visitors to leave Nayriz immediately and go to a safer place.
Upon the receipt of this advice, the two teachers, escorted by
ten Bahá’í men known for their bravery and staunchness of
faith, left for Sarvistan, a town in the province of Fars not very
far from Nayriz.

The teachers left the town safely but the adversaries did not
stop agitating. They turned to Haji Siyyid `Abdu’l-Husayn-i
Lari, the leader of the Shi`is of the area, and beseeched him to
take necessary action to curb the advancement of the Bahá’í
Faith. The Haji had an added incentive to encourage an assault
on Nayriz to take place: he had received an invitation from the
Shaykhu’l-Islam20 of the town asking him to subdue the local
government and rid Nayriz of its governor and his family. The
reason the Shaykhu’l-Islam had turned against the local
government was unrelated to the Bahá’í Faith and the teaching
activities of the friends. In fact, he was favorably inclined
toward Bahá’u’lláh’s Cause. His grievance had to do with an
incident involving the governor and his deputy, which he found
highly offensive and humiliating.

Mas‘udu’d-Dawlih, the son of Asifu’d-Dawlih, was then the
governor of Nayriz. He was married to Nazhatu’l-Muluk, the
daughter of Fath-`Ali Khan. Her brother, Muhammad Hasan
Khan-i Sartip, was the deputy governor. Mas‘udu’d-Dawlih
committed an act which, though legal in Islam, caused great
offence and cost him his position. What did he do? He
contracted another marriage, this time with the daughter of the
Shaykhu’l-Islam, a very influential personage in the area, nay in
the province of Fars. His first wife’s family, immensely
displeased with Mas‘udu’d-Dawlih, brought tremendous
pressure to bear on him until he relented and divorced his
second wife. This was something far beyond what the Shaykhu’l-
Islam could bear. Deeply offended and insulted by the incident,
he decided to exact revenge and waited for opportunity to
present itself. When he found the ground ready, he sent an
invitation to Haji Siyyid `Abdu’l-Husayn to attack Nayriz and
dislodge the governor.21

The requests that Haji Siyyid `Abdu’l-Husayn received from
the fanatic inhabitants of Nayriz and from the Shaykhu’l-Islam
provided ample justification for him to act, but the timing had
to be right. The dethronement of Muhammad `Ali Shah Qajar
and the ensuing chaotic situation presented the hoped-for
opportunity. To realize the dream of subduing the people of the
town and inducing them to do what he and his supporters
desired, he needed a ruthless agent. Shaykh Dhakariyya
Kuhistani, whose authority was supreme in twelve small towns
and villages in the mountains surrounding Nayriz, was the man
for the job. The Haji ordered the Shaykh to proceed toward the
town with forces under his command. Shaykh Dhakariyya was
happy to comply and did as ordered. He and the armed men
under his control moved toward Nayriz intent on conquering
the town, expelling the governor, establishing an autonomous
entity that opposed the central government, and dealing the
Bahá’ís a fatal blow.

Nayriz was besieged and fighting began between the forces of
the governor supported by the inhabitants of Nayriz on the one
hand and the rebels supported by tribesmen living in the
surrounding areas on the other. To prevent support and supplies
from Shiraz, the capital of the province of Fars, to reach the
governor’s forces in Nayriz, the rebels cut off all means of
communication.

After three days of fighting, the rebels took the northern
highlands and strongholds. After that victory, Shaykh
Dhakariyya invited the inhabitants of Nayriz to the fort of
Sayfabad, which he had conquered. The people were curious to
know what the Shaykh had in mind, so they attended the
meeting. Shaykh Dhakariyya’s purpose was to induce them to
cooperate with him. To succeed, he knew that he had to offer
them incentives they could not refuse. Knowing the fanatic
population’s deep-rooted animosity toward the Bahá’í Faith and
its followers, he made the Bahá’ís a scapegoat. In his speech he
introduced Haji Siyyid `Abdu’l-Husayn-i Lari as the defender of
Islam and the supporter of a national government, and himself
as the standard-bearer of Islam. In the same speech he attacked
the Bahá’í Faith and roused his audience against the Bahá’ís of
the town.22 By so doing he helped the seed of hatred and

contention, which had been planted in their hearts decades
earlier, to yield the fruit he desired. At the same time he
diminished support for the local government, whose forces were
already hard pressed to hold ground. Then in a surprise attack
by night, he took a section of the town known as Mahallih
Kuchih Bala.23 A few days later another section of the town fell
into the rebels’ hands and they moved closer to Mahallih Bazar,
the seat of the government. The governor of Nayriz,
Mas‘udu’d-Dawlih, and his brother-in-law Hasan Khan-i Sartip,
the grandson of Haji Zaynu’l-`Abidin Khan,24 fled Mahallih
Bazar and moved to Mahallih Chinarsukhtih, where the Bahá’ís
lived. They chose the Jami` mosque, which was a mighty
stronghold, for their defense. Intimidated by the approaching
forces of the Shaykh, the governor and his brother-in-law fled
Nayriz by night in disguise and left the Bahá’ís at the mercy of
the advancing forces of the Shaykh. Thus Mahallih
Chinarsukhtih became the battlefield. Fighting began around the
Jami` mosque between the inhabitants of that mahallih and the
rebels. One of the Bahá’ís, Muhammad-Hasan, son of Rahim,
was killed during that encounter. After Mahallih Chinarsukhtih
fell to the rebels, the Shaykh issued a decree making it a
religious duty to kill the Bahá’ís, plunder their property, and set
fire to their homes. The fanatics among the inhabitants of
Mahallih Chinarsukhtih joined hands with the Shaykh’s forces in
carrying out the decree. Most Bahá’ís, in obedience to
Bahá’u’lláh’s teachings prohibiting His followers from engaging
in holy war, left Nayriz and moved to a mountainous area to the
south of the town, where the early Bábís had defended
themselves against their adversary. Some with infants, or elderly
family members unable to walk a long distance, could not get
very far and went into hiding closer to the town.

Among the Bahá’ís who fled the town and took refuge in the
nearby mountains were the twelve-year old Muhammad-Shafi`,
his two younger brothers, his mother, Nurijan Khanum, and his
maternal uncle and aunts. Fearing the outcome of the Shaykh’s
victory, they took off for areas outside the town they
considered safe.

Other Bahá’í fugitives from Nayriz scattered in the same
region: Those younger and stronger moved further up the

mountain in search of safer hiding places, the groups consisting
of older people, women and children stayed in caves lower down
the mountain. With the group comprising Muhammad-Shafi`
and his family was a servant who carried some provisions for
them on the back of a mule. They started off early in the
morning of Naw-Ruz 1909. The mother of Muhammad-Shafi`, a
devoted and valiant soul, knowing the gravity of the situation,
related stories about the heroic deeds of the early believers,
awakening in them the spirit of heroism and sacrifice. Before
noon they reached a valley known as Tang-i Lay-i Hina and took
refuge in a small cave. When night fell, everywhere was pitch
black and no sound could be heard except the water and the
wind. Frightened and bewildered, they counted the hours and
minutes. About midnight they heard footsteps and wondered
whether the enemy had discovered their hideout. As they held
their breath in readiness to meet their fate, they heard a familiar
voice. A Muslim relative, whose Bahá’í wife was a member of
the group, had come to warn his relatives that the area was
unsafe. He informed them of the Shaykh’s decree and added that
he had announced that whoever presented the severed head of a
male Bahá’í, age ten years or older, would receive the reward of
a hundred tumans; if a Bahá’í were captured and taken to him
alive, the captor would receive 2000-3000 Rials, the wealthier
the victim the higher the reward. However, the women and small
children were not to be harmed, he said. The visiting relative
suggested that while it was still dark the men should take an
unfrequented mountain route to flee the area, and the women
and children return to Nayriz. Everyone agreed. What was of
concern was the situation of the boys who were older than ten.
Muhammad-Shafi` was then about twelve years old. He and two
other boys two years younger than him could not keep pace
with the men who were going to Sarvistan on foot.25 After
deliberation, it was decided that he and the other two boys
should wear the chadur and accompany the women. As the
parting time arrived, Muhammad-Shafi`’s maternal uncle,
Shaykh Muhammad Husayn, turned to his Muslim brother-in-
law and said:

> Now that we are saying goodbye and moving towards
> an unknown destiny, God has willed that you take
> charge of these defenseless and homeless women and

> children. I adjure you to hide them in an obscure and
> deserted place in Nayriz. If you see that the enemy is
> likely to find and dishonor them and you are unable to
> provide protection, throw them into a well and cover it
> with debris that no blight may touch this family.

Readers unfamiliar with the cultural norms of the Middle
East in the early nineteenth century may find it extraordinary,
even outrageous that men made life and death decisions on
behalf of the women in their care. Unless one has lived in those
places at the time when those norms dictated certain behavior,
it would be most difficult, if not impossible, to understand the
dynamics at work. Tradition backed by Quranic references was
the supreme determiner of behavior. What they perceived as
‘honor’ was uppermost in men’s minds, when it came to their
womenfolk. Men were in charge of the affairs of the women,
and they made decisions as necessary to ensure at any cost what
they considered their honor. If they could not do it themselves,
they delegated the responsibility to another male member of the
family, which is what happened here. It must be added that the
women who fell in the hand of the enemy, if they did not enjoy
amnesty, suffered a worse fate than death, as evidenced by what
is going on today in places where religious and holy wars occur.

At the time of farewell, the immediate future looked bleak.

No one knew what the future held. The hope of reunion was
slim indeed. Time was short. Loved ones had no choice but to
separate. Tears were ceaseless, hearts were burning with anguish,
sighs were soaring high, but uttering a sound could cost their
lives, emotions had to be contained and words were uttered in
whisper. The fate of the ones who were fleeing, as well as those
who were returning to Nayriz was unknown. Those who fled
faced many hazards on the way. Those who remained had little
hope of making it through the ordeal. Risky as the choices were,
they were better than immediate annihilation.

After the men left, the women and children, exhausted and
distraught, decided to tarry a while longer in the Tang-i-Lay-i
Hina. They spent the night in fear and uncertainty. No one had
the appetite to eat. However, spiritually they were ready to
embrace any eventuality. When daylight broke, the boys who
were older than ten wore the chadur and with the women started

walking toward Nayriz. With them was Mashhadi Hasan, the
Muslim husband of Muhammad-Shafi`’s aunt, as well as the
servant, whose name was Muhammad-Taqi. On the way they
could hear gunshots and see fire raging in that part of the town
where Bahá’ís lived. They realized that their houses had been set
on fire. The rebels’ practice was to set fire to Bahá’í houses
after plundering the contents. As the group continued walking,
feeling anxious and exhausted, the mule that carried their
provisions, carpet and bedding, was wrested out of the servant’s
hand by thieves and the servant himself stripped of his clothes.
However, the women were not disturbed. About noon, hungry
and without necessary provisions, they reached the ruins of a
house where they decided to retire for a while. They spent the
night in that spot without food and water. Fear of being
discovered kept everyone awake. Every time they heard a
footstep, all rushed to a dry well within the ruins of the house
and stood ready to throw themselves in, to honor the parting
words of Shaykh Muhammad-Husayn.

The plunderers and opportunists were hard at work that night
searching every corner of the town and the surrounding areas to
find male Bahá’ís, turn them in, and collect their reward. The
next morning another Muslim relative, a cousin by the name of
Mirza Muhammad-i-Shu`a`, who had heard his aunts and cousins
were staying in that place, rushed to their aid, took them to his
home and offered hospitality until the situation improved. To
get to his house, the group had to walk through the area in front
of the Masjid-i Jami` in Mahallih Chinarsukhtih, where fighting
was intense. As they were passing through the area, the young
Muhammad-Shafi` saw from under his chadur deplorable and
tragic scenes. Opposite the mosque he saw a body hanging
upside down from a mulberry tree. The corpse was bright red,
like freshly barbequed meat. There was also a heap of stone
collected under the body. His curiosity made him ask whose
corpse it was. In response, his cousin said it was the corpse of
Mulla Muhammad-`Ali who, together with his son-in-law, Mulla
Hasan, had been killed in Mahallih Bazar on the day of Naw-
Ruz. The corpse of Mulla Hasan, he was told, was similarly
hung in Mahallih Bazar but Mulla Muhammad-`Ali’s body had
been dragged to Mahallih Chinarsukhtih near the mosque, where
it had been set on fire, hanged and stoned. So many stones were

used that an elevation was formed under his body. The purpose
of inflicting abuse on dead bodies was to send a twofold
message: To intimidate the believers that if they insisted on
holding on to their new belief they would suffer a similar fate,
and to strike fear in the hearts of those who sympathized with
the Bahá’í Faith that if they crossed the line and joined the
adherents of that Faith, they would know what to expect.

Seeing the horrific scene and hearing the explanation in
response to his question so affected Muhammad-Shafi` that
after reaching the home of his cousin, he fell ill and developed a
temperature. The scene was so imprinted on his soul that he
remembered it vividly to the end of his life.

The search for male Bahá’ís continued. The hostile elements
among the population let loose by Shaykh Dhakariyya violated
the privacy of every Bahá’í home. They entered any and all areas
where they suspected Bahá’ís were hiding. The men who had not
fled the area and gone to Sarvistan were in grave danger. Nayriz
and its surroundings were combed for male Bahá’ís. When
found, they were dragged out and delivered to the Shaykh’s
gunmen, who took them to the Shaykh for interrogation, the
hope being that they would recant their belief in Bahá’u’lláh in
exchange for their lives. However, none caved in under
pressure, they all courageously confirmed their adherence to the
Bahá’í Faith and expressed readiness to die, to vindicate its
truth. They were summarily tried and brutally put to death, their
properties confiscated, plundered and burnt to the ground,
their women and children left without shelter, protection,
barest necessities and means to survive.

In that chaotic situation the rebels and ruffians enriched
themselves by causing the innocent Bahá’ís death and
destruction, others to sustain untold suffering and heartache.
But among the population there were some who extended a
helping hand to their Bahá’í friends and neighbors, at times
risking their own lives. A case in point is a Muslim father whose
daughter was engaged to a young Bahá’í man, named `Ali,
arrested for his faith. He did what he could to save the life of
his son-in-law to be and succeeded in getting a decree from the
Shaykh to spare the young man’s life. When he happily reached
the place of execution with the decree in his hand, he realized it

was too late, `Ali had already been executed. Then he saw that
`Ali’s brother, Mulla Rahman, was being taken to the arena of
sacrifice. He used the decree to save his life instead. Mulla
Rahman was kept in prison until Shaykh Dhakariyya left Nayriz,
then freed.26

Another man saw his Bahá’í friend, Amru’llah Nikayin, sitting
in the full view of public gaze on the day the Shaykh’s gunmen
had entered the town and were roaming the place looking for
Bahá’ís. He realized that his friend was unaware of the dangers
facing the Bahá’ís. He immediately briefed him of the situation
and advised him to take refuge in a house where his father and
brother-in-law were hiding. The father, the son and the son-in-
law stayed in that house for about a week before being
discovered by those working for the Shaykh. When armed men
entered to search the house and got close to the room where the
three were hiding, one of the neighbors, a Mirza Nasru’llah,
came forward, protested that they had entered unannounced,
and angrily said: “If you are looking for Bahá’ís, I am one of
them.” In the encounter he received some injuries. A group of
Muslims later testified that Mirza Nasru’llah was not a Bahá’í,
and he was released. However, the house was no longer a safe
place for the Bahá’ís to hide. At midnight when no one was
around, Mirza Nasru’llah took the three Bahá’ís to a place
outside Nayriz, showed them the route to Sarvistan and said all
Bahá’í fugitives have fled to that town; it is best for you to join
them there, he said. The three left Nayriz. In Khayr, a village
between Nayriz and Runiz, they tarried for a while.
Unfortunately, while there they were robbed of their
belongings. They were even stripped of the clothes they were
wearing. But they did make it alive to Sarvistan and joined other
Bahá’í fugitives there.

When the young Muhammad-Shafi` and his family reached
the home of his cousin, the women were accommodated in one
room and he had to stay in a storeroom, away from the eyes of
would-be intruders. An opening large enough for him to crawl
into was made under saddlebags that were filled with dried fruit,
nuts and grain. He spent 13 days and nights in that hole until
Shaykh Dhakariyya left Nayriz. The only time he could leave his
hiding place for a brief time was late at night. The Muslim

relatives kept the fugitives abreast of the news: more Bahá’ís
were killed every day. Even ten-year-old Bahá’í boys were not
immune. If one were found alive, he would be burned rather
than killed. Muhammad-Shafi` saw clearly that this could happen
to him but instead of being fearful, was so filled with the spirit
of faith and sacrifice that he found himself ready to offer up his
life for his belief. He attributed his state of readiness for
sacrifice to the visit of the two prominent Bahá’í teachers,
Mirza Tarazu’llah Samandari and Mirza `Ali Akbar-i Rafsanjani,
who had visited Nayriz before the incident. Their visit had
prepared the Bahá’ís of the town for such a day, he believed.

During the thirteen days of the Naw-Ruz celebration that
Shaykh Dhakariyya was in Nayriz (21 March to 3 April 1909),
eighteen valiant believers were brutally tortured and killed for
no reason other than their adherence to the Bahá’í Faith. As
stated earlier, every one of them was taken to the Shaykh and
ordered to recant his faith or be killed. Each refused to recant
and preferred to die for the truth he had embraced. Those
martyred were Mulla Hasan, Mulla Muhammad `Ali, Muhammad
Hasan-i Kulahmal, Mulla `Abdu’l-Majid, Aqa `Abbas,
Muhammad Isma`il, `Ali, the son of Muhammad Isma`il,
Muhammad Ibrahim, the brother of Muhammad Isma`il,
Asadu’llah, the son of Muhammad Ibrahim, Mihdi, the son of
Mulla Husayn and son-in-law of Muhammad Isma`il, `Ali Akbar,
the son of Mashhadi Naw-Ruz and the nephew of Muhammad
Isma`il and Muhammad Ibrahim, Mulla Husayn, the son of
Zaynal and the father of Mihdi, Muhammad `Ali, the son of
Darvish, Ibrahim, the son of Darvish and brother of
Muhammad `Ali, Mirza Akbar Kaffash, Ustad `Ali Sabbagh,
originally from Sirjan, Ustad `Ata’u’llah, and Amru’llah, the son
of Sulayman.27

Before Shaykh Dhakariyya left Nayriz, he installed a man
there as his deputy. The rule of the Shaykh and his deputy lasted
for a month. During that time pressure was maintained on the
Bahá’ís. Those who were hiding could not come out. The
properties, which had been confiscated, stayed in the rebels’
hands and the women and children, through necessity, lived on
the barest minimum. Muhammad-Shafi` and the members of his
group lived for a month on a daily ration of figs and a little

coarse bread. After a month, news was received that a new
governor had been installed in Fars, that Qavamu’l-Mulk-i
Shirazi had been put in charge of keeping law and order in the
province, and that he had ordered his forces to move towards
Nayriz and the areas under the control of tribal chiefs. As this
news spread, the situation improved. Muhammad-Shafi` and two
other Bahá’í boys of his age were able to venture out. He could
run errands for his mother outside the home. But whenever he
stepped out, he faced the abusive language of the children who
roamed the streets and inflicted on him and other Bahá’ís as
much insult and harm as they possibly could. One day he met
another Bahá’í, Haji Mir `Ali, who had just come out of his
hiding place. He whispered into the ear of Muhammad-Shafi`:
“Relief supplies have arrived from Shiraz. Tell your mother to
send someone to my home to receive a saddlebag of wheat
(about 75-80 kilos).” The young boy was overjoyed, ran home
and gave his mother the glad-tidings. His mother said in
response, “My husband is in the Holy Land, I cannot degrade
him by accepting handouts.” The young hungry boy, who was
longing for a piece of good bread, was naturally disappointed.

Gradually the inhabitants of the town discovered where
Muhammad-Shafi` and his family were hiding and exerted
pressure on their hosts for having provided shelter to Bahá’ís.
One day the landlady suggested to grandmother Nurijan that in
order to put an end to the talk circulating in town, she should
consider going with the womenfolk to the mosque. She stressed
that her mere presence in the mosque would suffice to ease the
pressure. Grandmother refused to comply, saying, “I will leave
your home and stay in the wilderness but will not visit the
mosque. I will not bring upon myself the blight of people
thinking that I have abandoned my faith.”

It was close to mid-May 1909 when Nurijan Khanum took
the hands of her three young sons and returned to their home,
of which only a skeleton remained. The first night was spent on
the rubble with no bedding, but to them it looked like heaven,
for they had been freed from confinement and could breathe a
sigh of relief. Another month passed before her husband, Mirza
`Abdu’l-Husayn, returned from the Holy Land and found his
business partner, Mulla Hasan, martyred, all accounting books,

records and documents destroyed, harvests demolished,
agricultural produce devastated, and his family destitute. He
had to start all over again and build his life from scratch.

When the pilgrims heard the news that Mulla Hasan had been
martyred on Naw-Ruz, they realized the significance of what
`Abdu’l-Bahá had said in response to the request they made on
his behalf: Mulla Hasan had wanted to go on pilgrimage and
asked his friends to submit to `Abdu’l-Bahá the request that he
may attain his heart’s desire. Instead of granting the request,
`Abdu’l-Bahá said that he had attained. The pilgrims knew that
Mulla Hasan had never been on pilgrimage and fearing that they
had not presented the request properly, repeated it in different
words. `Abdu’l-Bahá said again that he had attained. When the
returning pilgrims found out what had transpired on Naw-Ruz,
they realized that `Abdu’l-Bahá was aware of Mulla Hasan’s
martyrdom at the time it was taking place. He knew that in the
world of spirit he had attained his heart’s desire.28

The Fate of the Bahá’ís Who Fled Nayriz

Between seventy to eighty Bahá’í fugitives from Nayriz
gathered in Sarvistan, which was the only safe place accessible
to them in the province of Fars. After Shaykh Dhakariyya
entered Nayriz as a victor and issued his infamous decree, many
male Bahá’ís fled the town. They took off on foot in small
groups. The first town on their route where the Bahá’í
community could offer them refuge was Istahbanat, but danger
awaited them there as well. The fanatics were determined to bar
the fugitives from entering. They agitated the inhabitants to
arise against ‘infidels’ coming to their town. The Bahá’ís of
Istahbanat, knowing the dangers awaiting their fellow
religionists, appointed a trustworthy person to meet the groups
before they entered Istahbanat, warn them of the dangers
awaiting them in the town, and advise them to proceed directly
to Sarvistan. The fugitives’ first stop was Runiz, a place
between Istahbanat and Nayriz, owned by some members of the
Afnan family. The man who managed the property was Mir
Muhammad Hasan, a Bahá’í. He warmly received the fugitives
and extended to them loving hospitality. Within twenty-four
hours almost all the fugitives had gathered there. Although

warmly welcomed, the fugitives could not tarry there for long,
for nomadic tribes roamed the area frequently, rendering the
place unsafe. Therefore, the fugitives continued their journey
to Sarvistan. They sent one person ahead of time, to inform the
friends in that town of their imminent arrival. Mr. Tarazu’llah
Samandari and Mr. `Ali Akbar Rafsanjani, who had left Nayriz
before the disturbances, were still in Sarvistan. In consultation
with them, the believers prepared a plan for sending relief
supplies to the refugees and for receiving them in their town.
The provisions and warm clothing that were sent proved
critical, for the number of fugitives was large, not everyone was
dressed properly for the bitter cold, nor did they have sufficient
foodstuff to continue the arduous journey on foot.

Kharman Kuh, the mountain route the fugitives had to cross
to get to Sarvistan, was covered with snow, and there was no
clear path to follow. When they reached the peak, they had no
choice but to slide down on their back, to reach the other side.
By the time all got down, they suffered from exhaustion and had
no energy to continue the trip. Seeing a friendly face awaiting
their arrival on the other side and receiving the means of
sustenance sent from Sarvistan ignited in their hearts the spark
of hope. This was to them like heaven compared with the hell
they had been through. After a short sojourn there, they
continued their trip. In the vicinity of Sarvistan, sympathetic
friends came out en masse to meet them. What a scene to
behold! After days of traversing rough trails and snow-covered
mountain routes, uncertain of what was lying ahead, they found
themselves amidst loving friends who received them with open
arms, shed with them tears of joy, and joined them in offering
prayers of gratitude to the Lord. Alas, the joy was incomplete
and had sorrow in its embrace. The fugitives, grateful for
having reached a safe place, were anxious about the fate of their
wives, children, mothers and sisters they had left behind. They
knew not what had happened to them after their midnight
separation days ago.

Life for the refugees was made as comfortable as possible
within the means available to the Bahá’ís of Sarvistan.
Meanwhile, a new provincial governor, Sahamu’d-Dawlih, was
installed in Shiraz, the capital of Fars, and Nasru’d-Dawlih was

given responsibility to keep law and order in areas populated by
tribes and nomads. On his way to Laristan, he stopped in
Sarvistan, where the Bahá’í refugees were gathered. They
appointed Khajih Muhammad, a survivor of the first and
second Nayriz upheavals, to submit a written complaint against
Siyyid `Abdu’l-Husayn-i Lari and Shaykh Dhakariyya. They also
briefed Nasru’d-Dawlih in detail of what the Bahá’ís of Nayriz
had been put through. Nasru’d-Dawlih was visibly affected by
what he heard, and promised to do everything in his power to
make the two men responsible for the atrocities to pay for their
crimes. Right then he issued a decree appointing Rida Quli
Khan, the Mushir-i Divan, as the deputy governor of Nayriz,
charging him with responsibility to subdue the Shaykh’s deputy
and his supporters with the help of the Bahá’ís. He told Rida
Quli Khan to leave immediately for Nayriz and carry out the
order as soon as the Bahá’ís reached there. At the same time, he
advised the Bahá’í refugees to leave for Nayriz and assist the
deputy governor to carry out his mission. He further advised
the friends not to demand the return of their confiscated
properties found in the hands of the rebels. For that, he said,
“await my arrival.” The Bahá’ís did as advised. Nasru’d-Dawlih,
faithful to his promise, succeeded in cleansing Nayriz from the
presence of the rebels, and returned the confiscated properties
to their rightful owners.

The end of the Shaykh Dhakariyya episode did not mean the
end of disturbances in Nayriz. Time and again the Shaykh and
other rebels attacked Nayriz and caused the Bahá’ís much
suffering, the loss of property and livelihood. A detailed
account of each event is written in Lam`atu’l-Anvar by
Muhammad-Shafi` Rouhani, which is currently being translated
for publication in English.

\[25\] Sarvistan is a town in the province of Fars, about halfway between Shiraz
