> **Abstract:** One of the foundational philosophical premises at the heart of Bahá’í ontology is that the structure of 'being' (wujúd) is one of 'process' and 'becoming' rather then static and fixed. This dynamic ontology in the writings of Bahá’u’lláh is typified by the symbolism of Fire which via its attribute ‘heat’, is the cause of motion and hence the very foundation of being and existence. Fire, due to its dynamic nature, is often the symbol of the Primal Will (mashíyyat awalíyya) in the Bahá’í Writings, which manifests itself in history in the persons of the Manifestations of God. In one of Bahá’u’lláh’s important tablets to Zoroastrians He states that this Divine Fire which is the Primal Will is the Cause of all things, that it is the secret contained in the Zoroastrian scriptures and that it is He who is the messianic appearance of this Celestial Fire (átar). In this paper the mystico-messianic hermeneutics of Bahá’u’lláh in which He enunciates to be the theophanic appearance of the Zoroastrian Divine Fire (átar) in person will be examined in light of some of the relevant material from the Gathas (the earliest Zoroastrian texts which are considered to be the Prophet’s own words), and other Zoroastrian sources that point to this eschatological expectation. Also, some of the relevant history of the transference of this motif of the Zoroastrian Fire into early Greek philosophy, Judaism, Christianity, Arabic Hermetica/Alchemy and Islamicate philosophy will as well be briefly outlined.

Introduction

The French Islamo-Iranologist and philosopher Henry Corbin
(d. 1978), in his four-volume magnum opus En Islam Iranian (In
Iranian Islam) whilst discussing the Zoroastrian motif of the
divine Fire in the works of the Persian philosopher Shihab al-
Din al-Suhrawardi (d. 1191), called al-Maqtul (the Slain) and the
Shaykh al-Ishráq (the Master of Illumination), wrote:

> Just as each species is the theurgy and image of a Light
> among the victorial Lights, a Light from which they
> emanate and which governs them, so also Fire, the
> luminous Fire (nar dhat al-nur), not the infernal Fire, is
> the theurgy of the Archangel Ordibehest (one of the

However, they reach their highest degree in the Fire.3
46                                      Lights of ‘Irfán Book Fourteen

In the last portion of this terse passage, Corbin observes that it
is “movement and heat,” that “are the manifestational forms of
Light,” and that “they have no other cause then the Light,” but
that “they reach their highest degree in the Fire.” This insight of
Corbin provides an ideal framework for our discussion of the
motif of the Mazdean celestial Fire (and other Zoroastrian
motifs) in the Bahá’í scriptural corpus, as it precisely maps the
complex coordinates of the various components of this topos,
namely the dialectic of movement and heat, light and fire.

One of the foundational philosophical premises at the heart
of Bahá’í ontology is that the structure of being and existence
(wujud) is one of process and becoming rather then static and
fixed.4 Thus ‘being’ as such is ‘becoming’, and is manifested in
history in a dialectical relationship, of existence and essence,
matter and form. This foundational vision of a dynamic and
dialectical ontological process,5 in the writings of the Iranian
prophet Mirzá Husayn-`Alí Núrí, Bahá’u’lláh (d. 1892) — the
founder of the Bahá’í Faith — is often typified by the symbolism
of Fire (New Persian atash), which via its attribute/quality ‘heat’
(hararat), is the cause of motion or movement (harakat) and
hence the very foundation of the world of existence. Among the
various symbolic imaginaries, Fire, due to its dynamic nature, is
one of the symbols of the Primal Will (mashiyyat awaliyya) in
the Bahá’í writings, the active and dynamic agent (fa’il) through
which all things/beings come into existence in a perpetual or
processual creation.6 Indeed, the greatest mytho-symbol at the
heart of Bahá’í metaphysics par excellence is none other then
this Primal Will — which is the pre-existential reality of the
prophets, termed Manifestation(s) of God (mazhar iláhí) in
Bahá’í lexicon, (also variously called in the texts as the
Command (amr) or Word of God (kalimat allah, Greek logos) —
who is at once both the perpetual motive force behind the
genesis of the cosmos (cosmogony) and the unfoldment of
sacred history or hierohistory (termed in Bahá’í lexicon as
progressive revelation) as such.7

In many of his significant tablets to Zoroastrians, Bahá’u’lláh
makes a startling and profound eschatological enunciation,
namely that he is the messianic theophany of the divine Fire
(atash) foretold in the Mazdean scriptures.8 This Fire which is at

Celestial Fire                                                  47

once the symbol and theurgy of Truth (asha/arta) in
Zoroastrianism, is according to Bahá’u’lláh, manifested
(mazhar) in his person; thus effectively enunciating that he is the
messianic theophany or the locus of the manifestation (mazhar)
of the primordial divine Fire in Mazdeanism. This enunciation,
however profound, forms only the first layer of his spiritual and
divine hermeneutics (ta’wil iláhí) (see below), as Bahá’u’lláh in
one hermeneutical turn deploys both a cosmogonic and
messianico-eschatological register to the Mazdean Fire, by
equating the Primal Will (mashiyyat awaliyya) with the celestial
Fire in Zoroastrianism. In other words, the Primal Will whose
symbol is this celestial Fire in Zoroastrianism has appeared in
the ‘person’ of Bahá’u’lláh.

In Zoroastrianism, this divine Fire (átar) is personified as a
primordial being or divinity in the oldest portion of the Avesta
(Zoroastrian scriptures), namely the Gáthás. It is in the Avesta
that this Fire is endowed with the profoundly theophanic
epithet entitled, “the Son of Ahura Mazda,” which is at once co-
extensive with the divine Truth (asha) (there is one instance in
which they are co-terminus) and forms with it a syzygy, a twin,
or dualitude. This Fire is also intimately connected to another
profoundly sublime concept in Mazdaism, namely to the
luminous light of Khvarnah (literally ‘Glory’), the Light of Glory
or Divine Glory. It is precisely this Khvarnah, as we shall see,
which is linked to the very name of Baha’(-Allah), apropos his
claim to be the theophanic locus or manifestation (mazhar) of
the Mazdean Fire, and the very embodiment of the farr iláhí or
the “Divine Glory.” This is precisely the same Khvarnah that
shone resplendent in the prophet Zarathustra himself, and it is
the Araeo Glorea of the Mazdean messianic figure par
excellence, the savior called in the texts — Saoshyant (He who
will bring benefit), who is at times referred to as, “He who hath
the appearance of the Sun.” It is the Saoshyant, possessed of the
fiery Khvarnah, who will usher in the renovation, the
transformation and transfiguration of the world at the end of
time, “the making brilliant of Creation” or farshokart / farshigard
(Avestan frasho-kereti, Pahlavi frashegird). Thus according to
Zoroastrian apocalyptic imaginary, it is precisely the divine Fire
(atar) and Truth (asha) that shall be ‘embodied’ or “made flesh”
as it were, in a ‘person’ at ‘the end of time’, and who shall judge

48                                       Lights of ‘Irfán Book Fourteen

the world by means of his luminous and spiritual radiance,
symbolized at once as the Fire and the Khvarnah, and shall be
victorious (Vahram/Bahram) over the forces of darkness or the
Lie (druj), through the forces of light or the Truth (asha).

While Bahá’í scholarly literature on the Zoroastrian
apocalyptic imaginary have largely focused on Bahá’u’lláh as the
appearance of the messianic figure called Shah Bahram
Varjivand in some Pahlavi texts,9 yet the apocalyptic
expectation of the coming of the luminous and divine Fire (atar)
in the Gáthás and later Zoroastrian sources (such as the Pahlavi
texts), and their relation to Bahá’u’lláh’s messianic claims have
effectively gone unnoticed and remain a virtual terra incognita
(See Below).10 Indeed, in light of the tremendous importance
that this theme has upon the study of Bahá’u’lláh’s messianic
self-conception and its relation to Zoroastrian apocalyptic
imaginary, it is surprising that no studies have as yet appeared in
elaborating the significance of this motif (and other
constellation of motifs) and its deployment in Bahá’u’lláh’s
oeuvre.11 In this study, I will rely on a number of translated and
previously untranslated Persianate tablets of Bahá’u’lláh to
Zoroastrians, where he deploys a mystico-messianic
hermeneutics (ta’wil) of the Zoroastrian scriptures, in which he
proclaims at once to be the cosmogonic primal Fire (who is the
cause of creation), and the messianic epiphany of the Mazdean
apocalyptic or eschatological Fire (atar) in person. I will
undertake my analysis in light of some of the relevant material
from the Gáthás, the Younger Avesta, and later Zoroastrian
scriptural corpora, such as the Pahlavi texts, that point to this
eschatological expectation and cosmogonic function of the
Zoroastrian divine Fire.

Bahá’u’lláh as the Theophany of the Divine
Fire ( átar ) in Zoroastrianism

> Last night, from the cypress branch, the nightingale
sang, in Pahlavi notes, the lesson of spiritual stations.12

— Hafiz (d. 1389/90)
Celestial Fire                                                   49

In a collection of the writings of Bahá’u’lláh and ‘Abdu’l-
Bahá to Zoroastrians called Yárán-i Pársí (Zoroastrian or Persian
Friends), we find a few of the many tablets Bahá’u’lláh wrote to
Zoroastrians and believers of Zoroastrian heritage, throughout
his ministry. Such tablets as the tablet to the Zoroastrian
notable Mánakjí Sa˙ib (Lawh-i-Mánakjí Sa˙ib) and the Tablet
of the Seven Questions (Lawh-i-Haft Pursish),13 — which were
composed mostly in the so-called “pure Persian” or pársí-ye
sáreh — are perhaps among the outstanding examples of the
Persianate tablets of Bahá’u’lláh.14 Indeed, there is an evident
intertextuality between these works of Bahá’u’lláh and
Zoroastrian     sacred    texts,     though     they    are    more
phenomenological in scope, rather than citations and references
to specific scriptural texts. It is within the larger cycle of these
Zoroastrian tablets, that we often encounter Bahá’u’lláh
alluding to himself with characteristic Zoroastrian symbols and
motifs, such as the celestial or heavenly Fire (atash, nar), Light
(roshanaee, nur), Radiance (partow) and Solar imagery
(khorsheed, aftab, shams), among other symbols of divine
luminosity, illumination, and radiance, so often encountered in
Zoroastrian and Manichean (the so-called ‘Religion of Light’)
texts. Indeed, it is at the beginnings of many of these tablets
that there is an extended doxology or doxophany, in which the
reality of the Word of God (kalimat allah), or the Primal Will of
God (mashiyyat awaliyya) — the pre-existent reality of the
Manifestation — is alluded to symbolically as the Primal Light,
the Primal Fire, the pre-eternal Sun.

In many of these Zoroastrian tablets, Bahá’u’lláh explicitly
identifies himself with the Mazdean sacred Fire and its
apocalyptic or messianic advent. Bahá’u’lláh states “open your
inner eye, that ye may behold the celestial Fire (‘átash-i yazdan,
literally the ‘Fire of God’) [i.e., himself].”15 Indicating that
organs of spiritual apperception are required, rather than sense
perception, to behold this celestial Fire hypostasized and
personified as his-self. In another emblematic passage
Bahá’u’lláh writes:

> Today the Sun of the Word of God (goftar-i yazdan) is
> resplendent above the horizon of Utterance (bayan) and
> with an emanation (tajallí) from its divine emanations,
50                                      Lights of ‘Irfán Book Fourteen

> the heart of the people of the world are made refulgent
> and luminous. The Fire which imparteth Love (‘átash-i
> mohabat afrooz), is today manifest and resplendent in
> the world [i.e., himself].16

Here Bahá’u’lláh deploys Solar symbolism whilst alluding to the
pre-existential Word of God (goftar-i yazdan), evoking the
centrality of the Sun and its imagery in Zoroastrian as well as
Manichean literary corpora, and states that the Fire (atash) from
which love emanates or which is the source of love, is today
made manifest and shines resplendent in the world through his
being. In another hermeneutical turn, Bahá’u’lláh whilst
deploying the motifs of light and darkness, emblematic of
Zoroastrianism, refers to himself as the messianic appearance of
the Mazdean Light. In Lawh-i-Mánakjí Sa˙ib he writes, “At a
time when darkness had encompassed the world, the ocean of
divine favor surged and His Light was made manifest, that the
doings of men might be laid bare. This, verily, is that Light
which hath been foretold in the heavenly scriptures [i.e.,
Zoroastrian scriptures].”17 Indeed, here Bahá’u’lláh by referring
to himself as the Light that became manifest whilst darkness
reigned, at once evokes Zoroastrian symbolisms of light and
darkness, which simultaneously recalls the imagery of the
Johannian Logos, “In him [λόγος, logos] was life and the life was
the light [φως, phos] of men. The light shines in the darkness,
and the darkness has not overcome it” (John 1: 4-6, 9-10). The
Logos of John itself has been influenced by the logos doctrine
of Philo and Heraclitus, whose conception of Logos as Fire has
clear Zoroastrian influences. (For further relations of the
relation of the logos to fire and light, see below.)

Perhaps one of the most significant hermeneutics of Mazdean
Fire found in the Bahá’í textual corpus that must be mentioned
here, and which as we shall see profoundly corresponds to one
of the symbolic registers of Fire in the Zoroastrian scriptures
(see below), is that the Holy Spirit (ruh al-quds), also termed the
Most Great Spirit (ruh al-’azam), is identified with the
Zoroastrian Sacred Fire. What is of profound interest for our
theme is that in the writings of Bahá’u’lláh the visionary logic
and symbolic imagery of the Holy Spirit, is personified in a
feminine figure called, the “Maid of Heaven” (huriyya or

Celestial Fire                                                  51

huriyyat al-firdows). It is this heavenly Maiden, symbolized at
once with the Mazdean Fire, who appeared to Bahá’u’lláh in an
oneiric encounter whilst in prison, in the so-called Black Pit
(siyah chal), which according to Bahá’í liturgical calendar, is the
moment of the birth of his divine revelation and mission.
Shoghi Effendi, the Guardian of the Bahá’í Faith (wali amrullah)
writes, “the “Most Great Spirit,” as designated by Himself
[Bahá’u’lláh], and symbolized in the Zoroastrian, the Mosaic,
the Christian, and Muhammadan Dispensations by the Sacred
Fire, the Burning Bush, the Dove and the Angel Gabriel
respectively, descended upon, and revealed itself, personated by
a “Maiden,” to the agonized soul of Bahá’u’lláh (emphasis
added)” [GPB 238-239]. In another similar passage Shoghi Effendi
notes that the Most Great Spirit (ruh al-’azam) is, “that same
Spirit which, in the Zoroastrian, the Mosaic, the Christian, and
Muhammadan Dispensations had been symbolized by the
‘Sacred Fire’, the ‘Burning Bush, the ‘Dove’, and the ‘Angel
Gabriel’” (emphasis added) [CF 100]. It is precisely this sacred
fire, which in Zoroastrian-ism is the Holy Spirit, and is
personified in the writings of Bahá’u’lláh as a Maiden, a
luminous being of light, the heavenly ‘Twin’ or alter ego of
Bahá’u’lláh. Thus the Mazdean Fire and the Maid of Heaven are
co-terminous and refer to the same phenomenon, or more
precisely noumenon, in the writings of Bahá’u’lláh, namely to
the Holy Spirit (ruh al-quds), and the Most Great Spirit (ruh al-
’azam). Indeed, it is this “Sacred Fire,” which in Zoroastrianism
is identified as the Holy Spirit, and who is personified in the
writings of Bahá’u’lláh as a Maiden, and typified by the
feminine figure of Daena in Mazdaism, and as the Maiden of
Light in Manichaeism (see below).18

Perhaps an early precedent to Bahá’u’lláh’s self-identification
with the Zoroastrian sacred Fire may be found in Manichaeism,
the religion of the Iranian Gnostic-prophet Mani (d. 277), the
so-called “Apostle of Light.”19 Indeed, there is a profound
resemblance and correspondence between Bahá’u’lláh’s own
multi-messianic claims and Mani’s prophetic claims:

> Wisdom and deeds have always from time to time been
> brought to mankind by the messengers of God. So in
> one age they have been brought by the messenger called
52                                       Lights of ‘Irfán Book Fourteen

> Buddha to India, in another by Zardusht [Zarathustra]
> to Persia, in another by Jesus to the West. Thereupon
> this revelation has come down and this prophecy has
> appeared in the form of myself, Mani, the envoy of the
> true God in the Land of Babylon.20

In the religious literature of Manicheaism, which was
composed in several languages, including Middle Persian, we
find an interesting identification of the Living Self/Soul
(Middle Persian griv zindag) to the Zoroastrian sacred Fire. In a
Manichean text called the Recitation of the Living Self (Gwysn
‘yg Gryw Zyndg), the Living Self states:

> I am the fire that Zarathustra kindled
> And he bade the righteous to kindle.
> From the seven consecrated, sweet smelling fires
> Bring to me, the Fire, purified fuel.21

Concerning this hymn Klimkeit states that, “it interprets the
sacred water and sacred fire of the Zoroastrian cult in a Gnostic
sense.”22 Here the Living Self identifies itself with the
Zoroastrian fire, and proclaims to be the appearance of the
sacred Fire consecrated by Zarathustra. In one of the Hymns to
the Living Soul, Mani himself is identified with the Living
Soul/Self, “Praise to you, Living Soul, holy, holy, Lord Mar
Mani!”23 Indeed, Mani is often given a lofty and theophanic
status in the Manichean writings. In the Bema hymns, Mani is
addressed as the (beautiful) “form that was created by the
Word” (of the Father of Light)… as the divine Word that has
assumed visible, incarnate form.”24 This same Living Soul/Self
in Manichean myth is also referred to in various ways as the
Cross of Light, the Five Elements or Limbs, the Soul, the Youth,
and the Suffering Jesus (Jesus Pitiblis). There are three figures
of Jesus in the Manichaen writings, they are, Jesus the
Splendour, the Suffering Jesus (Jesus Pitiblis), and Jesus the
Messiah, or the prophet of history. The relationship of the three
figures of Jesus in Manichean writings, are not always clear, and
at times, they are interchangeable with each other. Mary Boyce
notes that, “the three concepts of Jesus are not always kept

wholly distinct.”25 Indeed, Bahá’u’lláh in his vast corpus of
writings often refers to himself as the “Youth.” In the Arabic
Lawh Mallah al-Quds or Tablet of the Holy Mariner, in which
the Maiden figures prominently, Bahá’u’lláh refers to himself as
al-fata al-’iraqi or the “Iraqi Youth” (“the Arabian Youth,” in
Shoghi Effendi’s rendering), and in the Persian tablet of the
same name, this title is given its full force in terms of the
Persian character of the “Youth,” by the opening words of the
tablet, “He is the non-Arab, the Persian, the Iraqi” (huwwa al-
’ajami al-farsi al-’iraqi) (see below).26

In the Manichaen writings, the Maiden of Light, the
Suffering Jesus, the heavenly Twin, the Light/Great Nous, and
the divine Glory (farrah), namely the Zoroastrian Khvarnah, all
symbolize and designate the same reality, namely Mani’s angelic
Twin, his heavenly self or alter ego. In a Hymn of Praise to
Mani it is written:

> We bend our knees in deep veneration, we worship and
> praise the mighty God, the praised King and Lord of the
> Worlds of Light, worthy of honor, according to whose
> wish and will you (Mani), our exalted God, did come to
> us.

> We worship Jesus, the Lord, the Son of Greatness, who
> has sent you, blessed one, to us. We worshipt the
> exalted Maiden (of Light), the bright Twin, who was
> your comrade and companion in every battle.

> We worship your great Glory (farrah), our Father,
> Apostle of Light, oh Mani, oh Lord!27

In this hymn the Maiden of Light, the Twin, and the divine
Glory (farrah) are identified with Mani, the “Apostle of Light.”
Indeed we encounter this Maiden of Light again and again, as
the heavenly Self or ‘Twin’ (syzygos) of Mani. In a Parthian
prayer to Mani, we read:

> … Great Maitreya, noble Messenger of the gods,
> interpreter of the religion, …Jesus — Maiden of Light,
> Mar Mani, Jesus — Maiden of Light — Mar Mani, have
> [mercy] upon me, oh merciful Bringer of Light!28

The imagery of the “Maid of Heaven” (huriyya al-firdows)
the personification of the Holy Spirit in the writings of
Bahá’u’lláh is also often filled with images of light (nur),
splendor (munawar) and illumination (ishraq). Indeed, the
Maiden of Light, which is Mani’s heavenly Twin, and the
Mazdean Fire, are identical to the Maid of Heaven in
Bahá’u’lláh’s oeuvre and acts as a signifier for his heavenly Twin
or alter ego. Bahá’u’lláh recounts the moment of divine
revelation and the epiphany of the Holy Spirit, personified as a
“Maiden” in this manner:

> While engulfed in tribulations I heard a most
> wondrous, most sweet voice, calling above My head.
> Turning My face, I beheld a Maiden — the embodiment
> of the remembrance of [the name of] My Lord —
> suspended in the air before Me. So rejoiced was she in
> her very soul that her countenance shone with the
> ornament of the good-pleasure of God, and her cheeks
> glowed with the brightness of the All-Merciful. Betwixt
> earth and heaven she was raising a call which captivated
> the hearts and minds of men. She was imparting to both
> my inward and outward being tidings which rejoiced my
> soul, and the souls of God’s honored servants. Pointing
> with her finger unto My head, she addressed all who are
> in heaven and all who are on earth, saying “By God! This
> is the Best-Beloved of the worlds, and yet ye
> comprehend not, and the power of His sovereignty
> within you, could ye but understand… [SLH 185]

Thus, it may be said that the Manichean Maiden of Light, and
the Mazdean celestial Fire, are therefore conceptually co-
extensive with the ‘Maid of Heaven’ in the writings of
Bahá’u’lláh,29 a reality designated in his oeuvre by various
symbolic imaginaries such as inter alia, the Primal Will (mashiyat
awaliyya), First Intellect (aql al-awwal), Word of God (kalimat
allah), Command of God (amr allah) and the Holy Spirit (ruh al-
quds), all designating the same divine reality and sublime entity.
Indeed, the source of Mani’s revelation is designated as his
‘Twin’ or heavenly self, but has also been referred to as the
“Living Paraclete” who appeared to him and gave him the
knowledge of all things, as it states in the Kephalaia, “Thus did

the Paraclete disclose to me all that has been and all that will
be.” As there seems to be an apparent discrepancy between
these figures, namely the twin, and the Living Paraclete,
Widengern states, “here the celestial Messenger is called the
‘Living Paraclete.’ Western sources say that Mani described
himself as the Paraclete Predicated by Jesus in the Fourth
Gospel. On the basis of the foregoing, this assertion cannot be
impugned. But, how can it be then that it is the so-called ‘twin’
who comes to Mani as his higher self? Precisely because the
Living Paraclete, who is the Holy Ghost [Spirit], is the same as
the ‘twin.’”30 Here again the Living Paraclete, the Twin, and the
Holy Spirit, are identified with Mani’s own higher self.31 The
appearance of the Living Paraclete which revealed the
knowledge of all that has been and all that will be also recalls a
description of the revelatory source of Bahá’u’lláh’s knowledge
of all things, which he states appears to him “in the form of a
tablet”:

> Thou knowest full well that We perused not the books
> which men possess and We acquired not the learning
> current amongst them, and yet whenever We desire to
> quote the sayings of the learned and of the wise,
> presently there will appear before the face of thy Lord
> in the form of a tablet all that which hath appeared in
> the world and is revealed in the Holy Books and
> Scriptures. Thus do We set down in writing that which
> the eye perceiveth. Verily His knowledge encompasseth
> the earth and the heavens.32

Indeed, this passage recalls the Irano-gnostic heritage discussed
above, and this description in Bahá’u’lláh’s oeuvre is another
symbolic epithet of the Maid of Heaven, the Primal Fire, the
Holy Spirit, all designating his heavenly self, his twin, or alter
ego. In an important passage the convergence of all these
symbolic imaginaries for the same spiritual reality are further
illuminated by Bahá’u’lláh:

> Whenever I chose to hold My peace and be still, lo, the
> Voice of the Holy Spirit, standing on My right hand,
> aroused Me, and the Most Great Spirit appeared before
> My face, and Gabriel overshadowed Me, and the Spirit

> of Glory stirred within My bosom, bidding Me arise and
> break My silence. [GPB 100]

The motif of the appearance of a ‘suspended’ written tablet
also figures in the celebrated Syriac or Coptic Gnostic fable, the
Hymn or Song of the Pearl, composed sometime in the 3rd
century CE. The Song recounts the life of a Parthian Prince,
designated as the “Youth” (like Mani and Bahá’u’lláh)33 who
‘descends’ to Egypt, at the request of his royal parents, to
acquire the pearl which is guarded by a fierce dragon. He strives
in vein to keep his identity a secret from the dwellers of this
foreign land. Whilst in the inn where he stays, he is given an
extremely rich meal after which he falls into a deep slumber.
Soon the tidings of his son’s predicament, reaches his father and
the King calls the magistrates and princes to compose a tablet
with a sign and seal by the feduatories, the Queen and the King.
The tablet, inscribed on fine silk assumes the form of a
marvelous bird, an eagle/falcon34 whose melodious voice
awakens the Prince from his sleep:35

> And serving as messenger,
the letter was a letter sealed by the king with his right

hand
against the evil children of Babylon and the savage

demons of the Sarbug labyrinth.
It rose up in the form of an eagle, the king of all winged

fowl;
> it flew and alighted beside me and became speech.
> At its voice and the sound of its rustling
> I awoke and rose from my sleep.
> I took it, and kissed it, broke its seal, and read.
And the words written on my heart were the letter for

me to read.36

Here the letter/tablet, which symbolically appeared as an eagle,
is the very words written in the heart of the Prince. The
letter/tablet is the Princes’ own self or twin. Towards the end

of the Song, when the Princely “youth” sets out upon his return
voyage to his heavenly homeland, the letter accompanies him
much like the Daena in Zoroastrianism:

On my way the letter that awakened me was laying like a

women on the road.
And as she awakened me with her voice so she guided

me with her light as if she were an oracle.37

Indeed, the Mazdean parallels with the figure of Daena — the
feminine angelic figure or “maiden,” that accompanies the soul
on its post-mortem celestial voyage — are clear in this text.
Thus, in a similar vein the tablet which appears to Bahá’u’lláh is
his own self or heavenly twin, and at once signifies the Maid of
Heaven, the Holy Spirit, the Most Great Spirit, the Pen (al-
qalam), all of which act as symbolic signifiers for Bahá’u’lláh’s
own self. Indeed, in an invocatio or prayer Bahá’u’lláh refers to
his heavenly and pre-existential reality as an archetypal divine
sealed book that speaks:

> This, verily, is the Day wherewith Thy Scriptures, and
> Thy Books, and Thy Tablets, have been adorned. And
> He Who now speaketh is, in truth, the Well-guarded
> Treasure, and the Hidden Secret, and the Preserved
> Tablet [al-lawh al-mahfuz], and the Impenetrable
> Mystery, and the Sealed Book [al-kitab al-mamhur].38

Thus, Bahá’u’lláh by referring to himself as the “Sealed Book,”
recalls the sealed letter of the King, which appeared in the form
of an eagle/falcon to the “youth,” the Parthian Prince in the
Song of the Pearl. As we shall see the symbol of the eagle or
falcon will have further hermeneutical ramifications in the
writings of Bahá’u’lláh and its association with the Khvarnah in
Zoroastrianism (see below).

The Angel or ‘Heavenly Twin,’ or syzygos of Mani, which the
Firhist of Ibn al-Nadim (d. 995) in Arabic calls al-Taum (derived
from the Syriac word tauma, meaning ‘twin)39 appeared to him
twice in his life, first at the age of 12, and then at the age of 24.
This topos of two, doubling, or twin revelations is precisely
repeated in the prophetic career of Bahá’u’lláh. Bausani refers

to this motif of the twin revelations whilst discussing the two
“revelations” of Mani, and notes that, “the ‘double’ initial
revelation [is] recorded in a number of religions, including the
recent Bahá’ísm…”40 Shoghi Effendi, who often deploys the term
“twin” in many of his English letters and communications to the
Bahá’í world, in one of his talks points out the mysteries of the
appearance of twin or two sacred personages, structures, and
events in the Babi-Bahá’í revelations and states, “In the Cause
of God everything is twin.”41 Indeed, the motif of twin
revelations of Bahá’u’lláh, one hidden (batin) and one open
(zahir), is consonant with this symbolic register of the motif of
“twins” in Irano-gnostic universe of thought. The first hidden
epiphany, as we have seen, occurred in the siyah chal (Black Pit)
dungeon in Tehran in 1853, and the second open revelation
occurred in 1863 in the Garden of Ridvan outside Baghdad. The
two 12 days (12+12=24) pertaining to the commencement of
Bahá’u’lláh’s revelation and his open declaration at the garden
of Ridvan, are significant as they fall into this same symbolic
motif of the “twin.” Indeed, according to ‘Abdu’l-Bahá the
doubling of 12 from previous religious cycles to 24, signifies
the “greatness” of the Bahá’í revelation, and in his exegesis of
the twenty-four elders in the visionary Apocalypse of John of
Patmos states that, “in this glorious manifestation there are
twenty-four [elders], double the number of all the others, for
the greatness of this manifestation requires it” [SAQ 57]. In this
precise sense, the Bahá’í revelation may be termed the religion
of the “twin” par excellence.

Another precedent to Bahá’u’lláh’s claim to be the theophany
of the Mazdean celestial Fire may be found among the Nusayris.
Indeed, among the esoteric Shí’ite sect of Nusayris (also called
the Alawis), who are often considered to be part of the so-called
“ghulat” (extreme Shi’ites) and whose doctrines display clear
Zoroastrian influences, the figure of ‘Ali ibn Abi Talib, the
cousin and son-in-law of the prophet, and the first Shi’i Imam,
is identified with the heavenly Fire in Zoroastrianism. Indeed,
the Nusayris believe in seven manifestations of God from Able
to ‘Ali, which is said to have taken place in seven cycles or
periods, namely the cycle of Abraham, the Arab, the cycle of
Muhammad and the Persian cycle in which ‘Ali manifested
himself. In Persian Nusayri texts ‘Ali is entitled Numayr, which

means fire.42 In Nusayri texts such as Risala fi al-Siaqa by Al-
Khasibi, it is written that ‘Ali had previously manifested himself
to the Persians:

> The Most High [‘Ali] deposited his wisdom with the
> Persians [i.e., Zoroastrians] and then left, being pleased
> with them. He promised to return to them. He is the
> one who said that God Almighty has deposited His
> mystery with you [the Arabs], manifested Himself
> amongst you, and destined you to receive it. But you
> have lost it while the Persians have preserved it even
> after its disappearance, by means of fire and light, in
> which He manifested Himself.43

Here ‘Ali is associated with fire and light, through which he
manifested himself among Zoroastrian Persians, and through
which, namely the Mazdean fire, his mystery was preserved.
Another Nusayri author al-Tabarani states:

> The Persians have sanctified fire, from which they await
> the manifestation of the deity. This manifestation will
> take place among the Persians, for they never cease to
> keep lighted the fire from which they await this same
> manifestation, and the accomplishment of the promise
> of the deity in that event.44

Thus, according to these Nusayri texts the manifestation of God
will take place among the Persians, and it will be through the
fire, which is identified with ‘Ali. This has obvious and clear
resonances with Bahá’u’lláh’s own claim to be the manifestation
of the Mazdean Fire, and clearly reaches back to the same Irano-
gnostic spiritual universe. It is possible that Bahá’u’lláh, during
the Istanbul/Edirne period in Ottoman Turkey (1863-1867-8),
and the ‘Akka period in Palestine (1868-92), may have come into
contact with members of the Nusayri community, who largely
live in Syria, as well as in Turkey and Palestine. Thus, the
Nusayris preserve within their doctrines elements of Iranian and
Zoroastrian thought, and conceive of the eschatological promise
of the manifestation of the divine Fire among the Persians — a
claim perfectly exemplified in Bahá’u’lláh’s own claims to be
the manifestation and theophany of the Mazdean Fire (atash).

Fire and its consequent light, have often symbolized the
divine theophany or epiphany of God and Divine self-
manifestation and self-revelation in many religions. In the
Hebrew scriptures Fire is referred to in the Sinaitic episode,
where God, in an Angelophany (or theophany), “appeared in a
flame of fire [‘esh] out of the midst of the bush” [Ex 3:2]; in
another instance God went before the Israelites, “by day in a
pillar of cloud [‘ammud ‘anan]…. And by night in a pillar of fire
[‘ammud ‘esh] to give them light” [Ex 13:21].45 Intimately linked
to this concept of Cloud (Hebrew ‘anan, Arabic ‘amma)46 and
Fire is the concept of the Divine Presence or Shekinah with that
of God’s Glory (kevod, also spelled kavod),47 “Moses could not
enter the Tent of Meeting, for the cloud rested [shakhan] upon
it, and the glory of the Lord filled the Tabernacle” [Ex 40:35]. In
another instance in Ezekiel’s vision of God’s Glory (kevod), we
read, “upon the likeness of the throne,” “was a likeness with the
appearance of a man,” and “with the appearance of the fire with
brightness all around,” “this was the appearance of the likeness
of the Glory [kabed] of the Lord” [Ezk 1:26-28]. Hence in the
Hebrew Bible the Glory of God or kevod elohim, is likened to
the appearance of a man, who has the appearance and
luminosity of fire. Jackson notes the striking similarity of the
Persian Khvarnah, with the Shekinah, stating, “The doctrine of
this flaming majesty [khvarnah] has an analogy in the Shekhína
of the Jews.”48 It must be recalled here that such texts as the
Book of Ezekiel were composed in Second Temple Judaism
after the Babylonian exile, and when the Jews had come into
contact with Persians and had been living under Persian rule for
some time.49

In the New Testament, Jesus, also states, “I shall baptize you
with the Holy Spirit and with Fire [pyr]” (Mt 3:11, Lk 3:16] and
the book of Hebrews declares, “for our God is a consuming
fire” [Heb 12:29], and in the visionary narrative of the
Apocalypse of John of Patmos, which as we shall see has explicit
Zoroastrian influences, Jesus in his parousia is envisioned with
an imagery of fire not unlike Ezekiel’s vision of God’s Glory,
“His eyes were as a flame of fire,” and “his name is called the
Word [logos] of God” [Rev 19:12] and “fire came down from
God out of heaven” [Rev 20:9]. Here the Logos is depicted with
the imagery of Fire, characteristic of Zoroastrianism. Scholars

such as David Flusser have noted that the Apocalypse of John
has explicit Zoroastrian influences, especially from a Judeo-
Greek apocalyptic text or apocalypse called the Oracle of
Hystaspas, which has its provenance in a Zoroastrian source or
sources. Indeed, many references to the topos of Fire in John’s
Apocalypse have their origin in the apocalyptic text of the
Oracle of Hystaspes.50 The Oracle of Hystaspes is a Jewish
apocalypse written in Greek, largely transmitted by the Church
Father Lactantius in his Divine Institutions, and has been
demonstrated to have a clear Zoroastrian provenance and to
have influenced to a great degree the Apocalypse of John of
Patmos. Indeed, there are several references in which the Fire
symbolism of the Oracle of Hystaspes has clear parallels with
the Apocalypse of John, and point to their Zoroastrian heritage.
For instance the final apocalyptic end described in the Oracle is
accompanied by fire, as it states, “Cities shall be utterly
overthrown, and shall perish; not only with fire and the
sword…”51 Also, at the apocalyptic end fire emanates from “a
great prophet” (magnus propheta) who is sent forth from God,
and “if anyone shall endeavour to injure him, fire shall come
forth out of his mouth and shall burn that man. By these
prodigies and powers he shall turn many to the worship of
God.”52 In another instance, speaking of the “coming of the
King (regis)” — the messianic figure in the text whom the early
Christians such as Lactantius considered to be Jesus — who
“shall descend with a company of angels to the middle of the
earth (in medium terrae, i.e. Jerusalem) and there shall go before
him an unquenchable fire…”53 Yet, another clear Zoroastrian
parallel is the evocation of the followers of truth (ashvan) vs.
the wicked or followers of the lie (dregvan) at the end of time,
“When these things shall so happen, then the righteous and the
followers of truth shall separate themselves from the wicked…”54
Finally, in the book of Acts of the Apostles, we read, “And
there appeared to them tongues as of fire, distributed and
resting on each one of them, and they were all filled with the
Holy Spirit” [Acts 1:3-5]. The “tongues of fire,” act as a signifier
for the illumination of the Holy Spirit descending upon the
hearts of the apostles.

In the Qur’an as well, Fire and Light — which is an attribute
of fire — has been employed in describing God. The famed

‘Light verse’ is perhaps the most emblematic example of the
association of light with God.

> God is the light (nur) of the heavens and the earth. The
> likeness of His light is a niche within which is a lamp in
> glass, the glass like unto a shining star lit from a blessed
> tree, an olive, neither of the East nor of the West, its
> oil nearly glowing though fire had touched it not. Light
> upon Light. God guides to His light whomsoever He
> wills.55

In another passage of the Qur’an it states in one instance
“the Fire of God (nar allah) kindled roaring over the hearts
covered down upon them, in columns (‘amadin) outstretched”
[Qur’an 104:6-8]. Note again the reference to the Columns
(‘amadin) of Fire, which we saw earlier in the Hebrew Bible. In
early esoteric Shi’ite traditions attributed to the Imams this
imagery of light associated with the Prophet Muhammad or the
Nur Muhammadi is extended to the whole complex of the motif
of the Fourteen Pure Ones, the Prophet Muhammad, Imam ‘Ali
and all the Imams, as well as the daughter of the Prophet,
Fatima, namely the pleroma of the Fourteen Pure Ones
(chahárdah ma’súmín) — a complex that has such close parallels
with the light imagery of Zoroastrian and Manichean texts, that
their influence on these early traditions (ahadith/akhbar) cannot
be contested. In Twelver Shi’ism the promised one, the
Qa’im/Mahdi, in the hermeneutics of the Imams is interpreted
as the Fire. In a Tradition attributed to Ja’far al-Íádiq, in the
hermeneutics of the first part of Qur’án 74:31, {We have
appointed only angels to preside over the Fire (má ja’alná aß˙áb
al-nár illá malá’ika)}, the sixth Imam stated, “The Fire is the
Qá’im (fa-l-nár huwa al-qá’im), peace be upon him, who has
kindled his light and (the light of) his appearance for the peoples
of the east and the west (i.e. for the whole world) (qad anára
∂aw’ahu wa-khurújahu li-ahl al-sharq wa-al-gharb). The angels
are they who possess the knowledge of the family of
Mu˙ammad (wal-malá’ika hum alladhína yamlikúna ‘ilm ál
Mu˙ammad), may the blessings of God be upon them.”56 Here,
in the hermeneutics of the Imams, the Shi’ite faithful are
symbolically interpreted to represent the “angels,” who have
knowledge of the Imams. This esoteric hermeneutics is, as we

shall see, continued in the Bahá’í writings in relation to the
Bahá’í faithful, the people of Baha’ (see below).

One particular image in early esoteric Shi’ite Traditions
ascribed to the Imams is the Column of Light, the columna
gloriae, which as we saw earlier was mentioned in the Hebrew
Bible and the Qur’an. It is this Column of Light which appears
earlier in the Manichean literature and may very well have
influenced them; called variously the Column of Glory (umud al-
subh) or Pillar of Fire or Light, and which is significantly
mentioned in one of the tablets of Bahá’u’lláh, in a visionary
encounter with the heavenly Maiden or Maid of Heaven (see
below). Indeed we encounter a Colum of Light or ‘amud min
naur (or ‘amud al-nur) in early Shi’i cosmology and cosmogony,
in which it acts as one of the sources of the gnosis of the
Imams. The earliest Shi’i Traditions relate that the pre-
existential reality of the Prophet and the Imams were in the
form of a Column of Light, dwelling in worlds (‘awálim) of
light, before the creation of the world, and subsequently made
its voyage from Adam to the Imams, and eventually will
culminate in the Day of Resurrection. In these traditions,
reference is made to ‘amud min naur, or the Column of Light,
which is precisely what their reality or light is derived from, in
pre-existence, where Prophet Muhammad and the Imams exist as
silhouettes of light (ashbáh) before the creation of the world. In
one such tradition the Prophet states:

> We were silhouettes of light until God wanted to create
> our form; He transformed us into a column of light
> (sayyarana ‘amuda nurin) and hurled us into Adam’s
> loins; then he made us be transmitted through the loins
> of fathers and wombs of mothers... and when He had us
> reach the loins of ‘Abd al-Muttalib [the grandfather of
> both the Prophet and ‘Ali], He divided the light into
> two and placed half in the loins of ‘AbdAllah [the
> Prophet’s father], and the other half in the loins of
> ‘Abu Talib [the Prophet’s uncle and the father of ‘Ali],
> Amina [the Prophet’s mother] received in her breast the
> half that was for me, and she brought me into the
> world; likewise Fatima, the daughter of Asad [the
> mother of ‘Ali] received in her breast that half that was

> for ‘Ali, and he begot al-Hasan and al-Husayn... Thus
> this light will be transmitted from imam to imam until
> the Day of Resurrection.57

This voyage of the Column of Light, the columna gloriae, in
early esoteric Shi’ite sources is also comparable to the light of
the Khvarnah in Zoroastrianism, in which it is transmitted as a
luminous and fiery seminal fluid,58 and is linked to the birth of
the prophet Zarathustra (see below). The Manichean influence
may also be witnessed in Tayyibi Isma’ilism, in which the
Column of Light plays an important imamological and
eschatological function. According to Tayyibi gnosis the soul of
the faithful initiate (mustajib) is said to make a spiritual
ascension or voyage from spiritual rank to rank (hadd) and this
“ascension toward the superior hadd is caused by the magnetism
of the column of light (‘amud min nur, or al-’amud al-nurani),
the summit of which reaches into the pleroma of the archangels
and towards which the souls of the believers are drawn.”59 The
great Iranian Sufi Sahl b. Abdullah at-Tustari (d. 283/896), who
was one of the teachers of the famed Sufi martyr Mansur al-
Hallaj (d. 309/922), also refers to the Column of Glory, and
may have been influenced either by Manichean sources or more
likely by such Shi’ite Traditions as noted above. Gerhard
Böwering, in his excellent study of the role of the prophet
Muhammad in Tustari’s work writes:

> God in His absolute oneness and transcendent reality, is
> affirmed by Tustari as the inaccessible mystery of
> divine light which yet articulates itself in the pre-eternal
> manifestation of the “likeness of His light, “mathlau
> nurihi, that is, “the likeness of the light of Muhammad,”
> nur Muhammad. The origin of the nur Muhammad in
> pre-eternity is depicted as a luminous mass of
> primordial adoration in the presence of God which
> takes the shape of a transparent column, ‘amud, of
> divine light and constitutes Muhammad as the primal
> creation of God. Thus, explaining the terminology of
> the Light-verse, Tustari says: “When God willed to
> create Muhammad, He made appear a light from His
> light. When it reached the veil of the Majesty, hijab al-
> ’azamah, it bowed in prostration before God. God

> created from its prostration a mighty column like
> crystal glass of light that is outwardly and inwardly
> translucent.60

The Manichean Column/Pillar of Light/Glory has further
profound parallels in Jewish mysticism and esotericism, namely
Kabbalah, and may have influenced such texts as the Zohar.
There is a veritable list of affinities between the Manichaean
and the Zoharic vision of the Pillar of Glory/Light, as Moshe
Idel has noted, “1. The concept of a pillar that is luminous is
found in both the Zohar and in Manicheaism. 2. Both
Manicheans and the circle of the Zohar share the view that a
pillar of light or of glory leads souls to paradise. 3. The pillar of
glory is identical to the perfect man in Manichaen sources. In
the Zohar, ‘amuda’ de-’emtza’ita’ is related to Adam, as both
are symbols of the sefirah of Tiferet.”61 This is only a few of the
similarities between the Manichean and Zoharic Column of
Light, but their affinity with the Shi’ite Column of Light is also
evident.

In one of Bahá’u’lláh’s tablets, Ishraqat (Splendors: literally
the radiance of the rising sun), the Maiden is personified as the
embodiment of Trustworthiness standing upon a Pillar of Light
(‘amud min al-nur):

> One day of days We repaired unto Our Green Island
> [jazirat al-khadrá´]. Upon Our arrival, We beheld its
> streams flowing, and its trees luxuriant, and the
> sunlight playing in their midst. Turning Our face to the
> right, We beheld what the pen is powerless to describe;
> nor can it set forth that which the eye of the Lord of
> Mankind witnessed in that most sanctified, that most
> sublime, that blest, and most exalted Spot. Turning,
> then, to the left We gazed on one of the Beauties of the
> Most Sublime Paradise, standing on a pillar of light
> [‘amud min al-nur], and calling aloud saying: ‘O inmates
> of earth and heaven! Behold ye My beauty, and My
> radiance, and My revelation, and My effulgence. By
> God, the True One! I am Trustworthiness and the
> revelation thereof, and the beauty thereof. I will
> recompense whosoever will cleave unto Me, and

> recognize My rank and station, and hold fast unto My
> hem. I am the most great ornament of the people of
> Baha, and the vesture of glory unto all who are in the
> kingdom of creation. I am the supreme instrument for
> the prosperity of the world, and the horizon of
> assurance unto all beings.’ Thus have We sent down for
> thee that which will draw men nigh unto the Lord of
> creation. [TAB 122]

Since Kamran Ekbal has discussed the Manichean parallels of
the Column of Glory/Light or Pillar of Fire with the writings of
Bahá’u’lláh, there is no reason to cover that ground again here.62
However, what is seldom noted is the location or topography of
this visionary encounter, referred to by Bahá’u’lláh as “Our
Green Island” or jazirat al-khadrá´. Shoghi Effendi in his
hermeneutics of the above passage states, “In one station the
intent is the Garden of Ridvan [in ‘Akka], and in another, it is a
spiritual interpretation of the station of Trustworthiness.”63 It
is well known that the Green Island refers to the Garden of
Na’myan in the vicinity of ‘Akka, which Bahá’u’lláh later
suggestively (re)named the Garden of Ridvan (Paradise), but
what is never mentioned is that it is also an allusion to certain
Shi’ite traditions concerning the Green Island (jazirat al-
khadrá´) beyond the White Sea, the land or earth of visions,
which is associated with Paradise, and where the Twelfth Hidden
Imam, the awaited Qa’im/Mahdi, is said to have resided and
where the Shi’ite faithful may voyage and encounter him.
Corbin sums up the symbols in a narrative concerning the Green
Island, by an “Iranian shaykh, ‘Ali ibn Fazel Mazandarani,
toward the end of our thirteenth century, an experience
recorded in the Account of strange and marvelous things that he
contemplated and saw with his own eyes on the Green Island
situated in the White Sea”:

> The account of the Green Island allows us an abundant
> harvest of symbols: (1) It is one of the islands belonging
> to the son of the Twelfth Imam. (2) It is that island,
> where the Spring of Life gushes, in the shade of the Tree
> of Paradise, that ensure the sustenance of the Imams
> followers who live far away, and that sustenance can
> only be a “suprasubstantial” food. (3) It is situated in

> the west, as the city of Jabarsa is situated in the west of
> the mundus imaginalis, and thus it offers a strange
> analogy with the paradise of the East, the paradise of
> Amitabha in Pure Land Buddhism; similarly, the figure
> of the Twelfth Imam suggestive of comparison with
> Maitreya, the future Buddha; there is also an analogy
> with Tir-na’n-g, one of the worlds the Afterlife among
> the Celts, the land of the West and the forever ever
> young. (4) Like the domain of the Grail, it is an
> interworld that is self-sufficient. (5) It is protected
> against and immune to any attempt from outside. (6)
> only one who is summoned there can find the way. (7) A
> mountain rises in the center; we have noted the symbols
> that it conceals. (8) Like Mont-Salvat, the inviolable
> Green Island is the place where his followers approach
> the mystical pole of the world, the Hidden Imam,
> reigning invisibly over this age- the jewel of the Shi’ite
> faith.64

In fact it was ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, the son of Bahá’u’lláh who
acquired this “Green Island” for his father, so that after forty
years of consecutive imprisonment and exile from Iran, his
father may find therein a measure of peace, as he well knew that
Bahá’u’lláh loved the verdant beauty of nature. In one of his
tablets ‘Abdu’l-Bahá states, “Praise be to God who made the
center of His Splendour and Dawning-place of His Lights, and
the horizon of His signs and the center of His mysteries the
Exalted Horizon (ufuq-i al-’ala) and the Kingdom of Abha
(malakut al-abha’), and the Supreme Paradise and the Green
Island (jazirat al-khadrá´), and the inhabitants of Jabalqa and
the City of Jabarsa…”65 Here the symbols of the earth of visions
is realized messianically on the plain of history, in ‘Akka66 in the
Garden of Ridvan (Paradise) which is transfigured into the
visionary topography of the “Green Island,” the visio
samargadina, and can only be perceived as such with “the eyes
of fire,67“ as Corbin puts it, namely through the organ of
visionary apperception activated by the Holy Spirit, whose
symbol is the Fire. Already before his outward declaration in the
Baghdad period, Bahá’u’lláh gestures towards a spiritual
hermeneutics of the expectation of the Shi’ite Hidden Imam
Muhammad al-Mahdi, the presumed son of Hassan al-Askari,

who had remained in occultation, according to Shi’ite doctrine,
for at least a thousand years. Bahá’u’lláh writes in the Gems of
Divine Mysteries (Jawahir al-Asrar):

> All that thou hast heard regarding Mu˙ammad the son
> of Óasan — may the souls of all that are immersed in the
> oceans of the spirit be offered up for His sake — is true
> beyond the shadow of a doubt, and we all verily bear
> allegiance unto Him. But the Imáms of the Faith have
> fixed His abode in the city of Jábulqá, which they have
> depicted in strange and marvellous signs. To interpret
> this city according to the literal meaning of the

> corners of the earth, nay probe its length and breadth
> for as long as God’s eternity hath lasted and His

> such as they have described, for the entirety of the earth
> could neither contain nor encompass it. If thou wouldst

> have established Him upon the seat of His
> sovereignty.68

Hence Bahá’u’lláh’s allusion to the Green Island in which he
had a vision of the personification of Trustworthiness in the
form of a luminous Maiden, at once contains multiple messianic
allusions drawn from Mazdean, Manichaen, and Shi’ite sources,
all of which are emblematic of the spiritual universe of Iran.

In the Mazdean liturgy of prayer, the Zoroastrian faithful
pray five times during the twenty-four hour period, whilst
standing in the presence of Fire, whether an actual fire, a lamp,
the Sun, the Moon, or any source of light and luminosity.69
Hence the point of adoration for the Zoroastrian faithful is the
outward manifestation of the divine Fire, which is at once the
syzygy of Asha (Truth/Order). The Báb in the Persian Bayan, as
well, enjoined every believer to face the Sun on Friday and to
recite a specified prayer to it and similarly to recite a monthly
prayer to the Moon. The Báb writes:

> While facing the sun on Friday, say this verse so that
> you will attain the presence of the sun of reality on the
> day of resurrection: “Verily, the glory (al-Bahá’) of God
> be upon your rising, O rising sun! Testify to that which
> God hath testified of His Own Self: Verily, there is no
> God but Him, the Almighty, the Best-Beloved.”70

The Zoroastrian liturgy of prayers to be recited before the
presence of a source of fire such as the sun (and the moon) is
clearly apparent in this liturgical enunciation of the Bab.
However, these exoteric (zahir) supplications by the Bab, at
once point to an esoteric (batin) and messianic dimension.
Indeed, Bahá’u’lláh states that the esoteric and messianic
significance of this liturgical supplication of the Bab, acts as an
encoded signifier to his own name, that is Baha’, and to his
messianic status as the promised one of the Bayan. He writes:

> Someone wants to know the secret of what was revealed
> to him that came before me [the Bab] regarding the sun
> and his standing while facing it. Blessed is the one who
> asked this question and wanted to know what was
> concealed from the hearts of the worlds. Say: I swear by
> God that what he meant by the sun is my beauty that

Here the Báb’s invocation to the sun, which contains the
Greatest Name al-Bahá’, according to the hermeneutics of
Bahá’u’lláh, becomes a reference to himself, and by glorifying
and supplicating the rising of the visible sun, the Báb
effectively gestures towards the advent of the rising of the
invisible Sun of Reality, namely the figure of Bahá’u’lláh. In
many of the writings of the Báb and Bahá’u’lláh the Sun and
Moon act as symbols of the divine Light, at once typifying the
pre-existential Primal Will of God, which in the lexicon of the
Báb and Bahá’u’lláh are often referred to as the Sun of

Truth/Reality (shams-i haqiqat, shams al-haqiqa), the Sun of the
Word of God (shams-i kalamey-i ellahi, shams-i kalimat allah).
Indeed, in Shi’ism the two symbols of the Sun and Moon
represent respectively, the Prophet Muhammad and Imam ‘Ali,
exemplified in the famed Tradition, “I am the Sun and ‘Ali is the
Moon,”72 that is, the Sun signifies the station of Prophethood
or the Primal Will, and the divinely ordained Guardianship or
Walaya, reflecting the light of the Sun of Prophethood,
symbolized as the Moon. This would not have escaped the early
Bábí votaries, who mainly ranked among the Shaykhis, and who
were long steeped in the traditions of the Imams. Indeed,
Bahá’u’lláh in his commentary on the Qur’anic Surah of the Sun
“Tafsír-i-Súriy-i-Wa’sh-Shams” (Surah 91) writes, “Know thou
that whoso clingeth to the outward sense of the words, leaving
aside their esoteric significance, is simply ignorant.”73 He then
provides several hermeneutic registers for the term ‘Sun’ in that
verse, which confirms that one of the meanings of the Sun is the
“Primal Will,” and goes on to state that by the verse, ““By the
moon when it followeth it!” The moon signifieth the station of
guardianship [walaya], which followeth the sun of prophethood,
that is, it appeareth afterward, to vindicate the cause of the
prophet among God’s servants.”74

In the preamble of the tablet to Mánakjí Sahib, Bahá’u’lláh
identifies the pre-existent or primal Word of God, with the
primal or first Light through which all things have come into
being:

> This dewdrop, which is the Primal Word of God
> (nakhusteen guftar-i kerdegar), is at times called the
> Water of Life, in as much as it quickeneth with the
> waters of knowledge them that have perished in the
> wilderness of ignorance. Again it is called the Primal
> Light (roshanai-ye nakhosteen), a light born of the Sun
> of divine knowledge, through whose effulgence the first
> stirrings of existence (junbesh-i nakhusteen, the primal
> movement) were made plain and manifest.75

It is clear from the above that “existence” which is literally “the
first movement” of creation is ascribed to the Primal Light,
which is the same as the Primal Word of God. In a similar

passage Bahá’u’lláh writes, “This movement was made manifest
in creation from the heat of the Word of God. Whosoever hath
attained unto this heat, hastened to the path of the Friend, and
whosever remained deprived became despondent, a despondency
that hath no end.”76 This primal Light or Fire, which is co-
terminus with the Primal Will, is the cause of heat through
which all of existence is set in motion. Abdu’l-Bahá in a short
tablet to a Zoroastrian believer states, “The soul of the world
and the movement of existence is from the essence of the
[heavenly] Fire…”77 It is here that the dialectic of fire and light,
of heat and movement are related at once to the existentiation
of the cosmos and its perpetual motion. In a profound series of
theophanic utterances related to divine radiance so often
encountered in Mazdean and Manichean texts, Bahá’u’lláh
proclaims, “Today the Light is speaking, the Fire is conversing
and the Sun of Truth is shining.”78 Here in no uncertain terms
Bahá’u’lláh claims to be the personification, embodiment, and
epiphany of the Mazdean Fire.

Now among these Persianate Tablets to Zoroastrians, which
continue the same motif(s) of Fire, Light, Heat, and Movement,
one stands out as the locus classicus par excellence, as it is here
that Bahá’u’lláh at once unequivocally identifies himself as the
appearance of the divine Fire (atash) foretold in the Zoroastrian
scriptures; whilst simultaneously equating this Mazdean celestial
Fire with the pre-existential Primal Will as the cause or motive
force which has brought all creation into existence. In this
Tablet called Lawh-i Dustan-i Yazdani (Tablet of the Divine
Friends), whose recipient remains unknown, Bahá’u’lláh in one
profound turn accomplishes several hermeneutical registers for
the divine Fire in Zoroastrianism. Since this portion of the
tablet will act as the locus for our analysis, I shall cite it here in
full and begin to explore it in greater detail:

> Ascent and descent, stillness and motion [harikat], have
> come into being through the Will of the Lord of all that
> hath been and shall be. The cause of ascent is lightness,
> and the cause of lightness is heat [hararat]. Thus hath it
> been decreed by God. The cause of stillness is weight
> and density, which in turn are caused by coldness. Thus
> hath it been decreed by God. And since He hath

> ordained heat to be the source of motion and ascent
> and the cause of attainment to the desired goal, He hath
> therefore kindled with the mystic hand that [True] Fire
> [‘átash-i haqiqi]79 that dieth not and sent it forth into
> the world, that this divine Fire [‘átash-i illahiyya] might,
> by the heat of the love of God, guide and attract all
> mankind to the abode of the incomparable Friend. This
> is the mystery enshrined in your Book [Avesta] [in ast
> sirr-i kitáb-i shuma] that was sent down aforetime, a
> mystery which hath until now remained concealed from
> the eyes and hearts of men. That primal Fire [‘átash-i
> ágház] hath in this Day appeared with a new radiance
> and with immeasurable heat. This divine Fire burneth of
> itself, with neither fuel nor fume, that it might draw
> away such excess moisture and cold as are the cause of
> torpor and weariness, of lethargy and despondency, and
> lead the entire creation to the court of the presence of
> the All-Merciful. Whoso hath approached this Fire hath
> been set aflame and attained the desired goal, and
> whoso hath removed himself therefrom hath remained
> deprived.80

There are two important hermeneutical registers or narratives to
be noted in the above passage, first a more philosophical
narrative, and second a more mytho-symbolic one:
1. Fire as the symbol of the Primal Will of God, who via heat

> is the agent or cause of motion/movement and hence of
> creation (cosmogony),81 and
2. This Primal Will which is symbolized as the divine Fire, is

> sent into the world (i.e., Bahá’u’lláh), and was foretold as a
messianic     expectation      in   Zoroastrian     scriptures

(messianism/eschatology).
First let us turn to the hermeneutics of Bahá’u’lláh related to
his symbolic identification of himself as the fulfillment of the
messianic expectation of the divine Fire in Zoroastrianism. A
comparative analysis of the motif of Fire in these Zoroastrian
Tablets of Bahá’u’lláh with the Zoroastrian scriptures will
enable us to perceive that indeed they have their counterpart,
their syzygy as it were, in the Zoroastrian texts themselves. In

particular, we will look at the Gathas (meaning Songs or
Hymns), which are considered to be the words of the prophet
Zarathustra himself. Indeed, the Gathas are unanimously
considered by scholars to be the prophet Zoroaster’s’ own
words. They are couched in an ancient mantic poetry, which
have caused many difficulties for scholars translating the
Gathas. It is no wonder then that the translations of the Gathas
are at times so varied and different from one another.83 The
other parts of the Avestan Yasna or the Acts of Worship, and
the Yashts are called respectively the Younger Avesta.

Now, before we explore the monumental hermeneutical
edifice that Bahá’u’lláh has raised round the motif of the
Mazdean Fire, it is important to see what other scholars have
said in their respective commentaries regarding the above
passage. To our knowledge only two scholars have referenced
the above text, namely Faridu’ddin Radmehr84 and Christopher
Buck. Since Radmehr refers to the first portion of this
paragraph dealing with its philosophico-cosmogonic elements
only, without discussing its Zoroastrian context, we shall deal
with it in another section. However, Buck has referenced the
above passage in its messianic and eschatological context, but
only cites part of the passage, namely the portion which reads:
“this is the mystery enshrined in your Book that was sent down
aforetime, a mystery which hath until now remained concealed
from the eyes of men.”85 Buck reads this passage in light of his
discussion of the prophecy of Sháh Bahrám Varjivand, whereby
this “mystery” (sirr) becomes a reference to Sháh Bahrám.
However, it is clear from the full context of the passage cited
above, that the “mystery” or “secret” (sirr) in this instance does
not refer to Sháh Bahrám, but to the divine Fire (atash).
Bahá’u’lláh significantly refers to this Fire as a “mystery”
foretold in the Mazdean sacred texts, indicating that it has
remained hidden until now. However, the expectation of Sháh
Bahrám was neither a mystery nor a secret, in fact it was a
widespread messianic expectation in nineteenth century Iran, as
noted by Buck himself.86 Thus the secret effectively contained in
the Zoroastrian scriptures, according to Bahá’u’lláh, is a
messianic secret, which is none other then the promise of the
appearance of the divine Fire, which now stands revealed (i.e.,
himself).

In many of his tablets to Zoroastrians Bahá’u’lláh again and
again alludes to that which had hitherto remained ‘hidden’
(mastur) in the Mazdean scriptures, but which has now been
revealed via subtle allusions and references in his writings. In
one instance, whilst speaking about the tablets which have been
revealed in honor of Zoroastrians Bahá’u’lláh writes:

> In these days Tablets have been revealed especially for
> the people of Zarathustra [i.e. Zoroastrians]. And that
> which has been hidden (mastur) up to now in their
> Books (kutub), has been mentioned therein (madhkúr).
> But unless and until that which belongs to them does
> not become known (ma’lum nashavad), no one will
> understand the references of the words of the Revealer
> of Verses [i.e., Bahá’u’lláh].87

In the above text Bahá’u’lláh significantly indicates that all that
was hidden (mastur) up to now in the Zoroastrian scriptures has
been mentioned in his writings and that unless and until that
which belongs to Zoroastrians (i.e., their sacred texts), does not
become known or understood (ma’lum nashavad), no one can
appreciate the subtle references and allusions in his writings to
Zoroastrians. But, what is it that was hidden in the Zoroastrian
scriptures? And what is it that must become known first, in
order to properly appreciate such references? Indeed, as
indicated by Bahá’u’lláh in the previous passage, one such
hidden secret or mystery is precisely the promise of the
messianic advent of the divine Fire (atar/atash) — a promise
first alluded to in the Gathas, as well as other Zoroastrian texts
such as the Younger Avesta, and the later Pahlavi texts. Hence,
presumably it is this motif and similar constellation of motifs in
Mazadean scriptures that must become more widely read and
studied, that such references as alluded to by Bahá’u’lláh in his
tablets to Zoroastrians, may be better appreciated and
understood.

In another tablet to a Zoroastrian believer Bahá’u’lláh refers
to this same secret or mystery with the significant Persian term
ráz (secret, mystery):

> The radiance of the world-conquering Sun hath
> illuminated the world and has bestowed freshness to this
> age of despondency, happy is the eye that hath seen and
> recognized. Ask from the self-sufficient Lord, so that
> He may shine upon you the mystery (ráz) of His Day,
> and may vivify you with a new life. He is the Able, the
> Knowing.88

The mystery or secret (ráz) here is the appearance of
Bahá’u’lláh, which is referred to as His Day, or the Day of God,
or the divine spring-time or Naw-Ruz (New Day). It is
interesting to note here that in some of the Middle Persian or
Pahlavi texts in the Sassanian period (3rd–7th century CE), which
received their final form sometime from the 7th to the 11th CE,
the Persian term ráz meaning “secret,” or “mystery” (which is
semantically co-terminus with sirr in Arabic), is used at times to
signify precisely “the secret of eschatology”89 in its broadest
sense of both individual and universal. Apart from this, there is
an important occurrence of ráz in a text, which is related to the
seventh day of creation in Genesis, as it states, “for this same
secret the Jews rest on the day of Sabbath even now.”90 Shaked
avers that “the ‘secret’ here is the reason that God rested on the
seventh day after He had created the world,”91 but he does not
elaborate as to what this secret “reason” entails.92 What seems
to have escaped Shaked and is important to note here is that in
the Zoroastrian calendar out of the seven holy days or festivals,
the 7th and final holy day, is the festival called the New Day or
Naw Ruz (the spring-equinox), “prefiguring annually the future
‘New Day’ of eternal bliss,”93 that is to say of frashegird (the
making brilliant of creation), and which is precisely associated
with Truth (asha) and Fire (atar) (see below). Indeed, these seven
festivals were associated with one of the seven creations and its
divinity in the Pahlavi texts, as Boyce states:

> The six feasts are assigned to a creation and its divinity
> in the order given in the Zoroastrian creation myth…
> the sixth being that of mankind, which was under the
> especial care, through his Holy Spirit, of Ahura
> Mazdá… The seventh [creation], that of fire, which
> quickens all the others, was under the guardianship of
> Asha ... and its feast is Nowruz itself.94

Thus, as we have seen in both the Gathas and in the Pahlavi
texts, Fire is the originating cause of creation, and acts as the
cause of movement that sets existence into motion (this will be
more fully developed in the section on Mazdean Fire: see
below). Indeed, there are profound messianic overtones in
aspects of the Zoroastrian calendar and its relation to
Fire/Truth and their correspondences to the Babi-Bahá’í
calendar called the Badí’ (meaning New, Wondrous, Unique)
calendar, and the name Baha (Glory, Light, Splendor, Beauty).
Some scholars have noted the overall resemblance of the Badí’
calendar to the Zoroastrian liturgical calendar, as Walbridge
states, “The Báb’s [also Bahá’u’lláh’s] calendar resembles the
Zoroastrian calendar much more closely than the Muslim one,
being a solar calendar with non-lunar months and with months
and days named after divine attributes.”95

Indeed, there is a profound homology and correspondence
between the Zoroastrian calendar, with the name of divinities or
angelic entities (yazatas, izads) which have their counterpart,
their syzygy, in the Babi-Bahá’í calendar, in the divine names
and attributes of God (asma’ wa sifat-i illahi), which is
effectively those of the Manifestation of God.96 The
Zoroastrian calendar may be considered therefore, as a sort of
messianic cryptogram containing an allusion, a secret (raz), a
“hierophantic sign,” as Corbin puts it, heralding the coming of
the New Day or Naw-Ruz, that is the appearance of the Divine
Fire as the Saoshyant, which is encoded into the month and the
days set aside for Fire (atar, a∂ar, azar), which is numerically the
number nine (See Figure 1 and Figure 2).97 Indeed, nine is
precisely the numerical value of the divine name Baha’
according to the Arabic abjad system98 — in which each Arabic
letter of the alphabet represents a numeric value — and nine is
associated with the days and months that are presided over by
the divine Fire (atar/a∂ar/azar) in the Zoroastrian liturgical
calendar, and Baha’ is the divine name presiding over the year
nine in the Badí’ calendar, and it is precisely the divine name

Baha’ which is linked with Naw Ruz and linked to the element
of Fire. Thus the heavenly and divine Fire as symbolized in the
Zoroastrian calendar, is co-incident and co-terminus in every
particular with the divine name Baha’ in the Badí’ calendar.
Here again the Most Great Name or Baha’ is co-extensive with
the divine Fire in Zoroastrianism (See Figure 199 and Figure 2),
and as we shall see, becomes the embodiment of the Mazdean
divine Fire and Light of Glory or Khvarnah (see below).100

Thus as we have seen, Bahá’u’lláh’s spiritual hermeneutics
locates the divine (Primal) Fire as a messianic secret or mystery
foretold in the Zoroastrian scriptures. Now we must first
ascertain in more detail if in fact the Zoroastrian scriptures, and
the Gathas in particular, do contain an expectation of the
coming of the divine Fire, namely as a messianic figure in
eschatological times, and second to see if in the Gathas and
other Zoroastrian sources (i.e., the Pahlavi texts) this divine Fire
is the primal cause of existence or creation.

Mazdean Fire: From Cosmogony to
Eschatology

There is perhaps no single religion that lights the imagination
with the symbol of a holy and sacred Fire, than the religion of
ancient Iran, namely Zoroastrianism.101 The symbolism of a
sacred Fire permeates all aspects of Mazdaism, from its sacred
texts, to its liturgy, from its cosmology and cosmogony, to its
messianism and apocalyptic-eschatology. Indeed, it cannot be
gainsaid that Fire in all its manifestation is one of the
quintessential symbols of Mazdaism par excellence. So much so,
that for centuries, Zoroastrians were polemically referred to as
“Fire worshipers” (atash parast). It was to such misconceptions
that the great poet Firdowsi (d. 1020) spoke to when he wrote
these lines in his Book of Kings (Shahnameh):

[Hushang’s] ancestors had their religion, their spiritual

practice.
Worshiping Izad [God] was the way they pursued.

> At that time fire with its beautiful color [was to them],
> What stone in the mihrab is now to Arabs [Muslims].
> Fire was placed in the heart of stones in order for
[Divine] light to spread from it throughout the

world.102

The adoration and worship of Fire stretches into the
immemorial past among the Indo-Iranians, and in all probability
had its origins in the cult of the hearth fire like such divinities
as the Vedic Agni (fire). Similarly Fire among the ancient
Iranians was the visible manifestation of the divinity called
Atar, and was worshiped via the hearth fire in liturgical
ceremonies that made offerings to the divinity. The term used in
the Gáthás for Fire is átar, (Avestan átar, Middle Persian ádar or
ádur, New Persian átash) the etymology of which remains
unknown.103 Also as Skjærvø notes, “In the Old Avesta, divine
beings are referred to as “lords” (ahura, Old Indic asura), among
them the heavenly fire, Ahura Mazda’s son…”104 (12). Indeed,
Atar is one of the many but significant divine entities or beings
called yazatas or izads (The Adorable Ones) in Zoroastrianism,
and which Zoroastrian tradition designates as “angels”
(fereshtegan).105

The Gathas (Songs or Hymns), which are considered to be the
prophet Zoroaster’s/Zarathustra’s own words, may be dated
approximately to 1500-1000 BCE and form the oldest portion
of the Avesta often called the Old Avesta. They are couched in
an ancient mantic poetry, which have caused many difficulties
for scholars translating them. It is little wonder that the
translations of the Gathas are at times so varied and different
from one another.106 The other parts of the Avestan Yasna or
the Acts of Worship, and the Yashts are called respectively the
Younger Avesta, and were formed before the Achaemenid
dynasty, perhaps during the Median period around 700-550
BCE. Finally, the later Middle Persian or Pahlavi texts belong to
the Sassanian period (3rd–7th century CE), and received their
final form sometime from the 7th to the 11th CE.

Before examining the motif of the divine Fire in the
Zoroastrian scriptures, one of the most important aspects of

Zoroastrianism that must be mentioned at the outset is its
profound mytho-logic, in which, there is a simultaneous
“mythical and theologico-philosophical” narrative functioning
side by side. Indeed, as Alessandro Bausani notes, “Sufficient
attention has not been paid to this “style” of Mazdaic
Scriptures. This is true not only of the later Pahlavi books but
also of Avesta itself.”107 Indeed, Wolfson’s definition of the
mythologic operative in dreams, is apropos with regard to the
logic of Zoroastrian texts, as he states, “mythologic — … should
not be construed as privileging either logical or mythical
patterns of discourse, rendering one subordinate to the
other…”108 It is precisely due to this mytho-logic operative in
Mazdean imaginary, that the attributes of God or Ahura Mazda
“are not (be they eternal or created) intelligible concepts; rather
they are themselves ‘persons’ or ‘angels.’”109 Indeed, Bausani is
in agreement with Corbin when he states, “the Mazdean, instead
of putting to himself the questions: “What is Time? What is
Earth? What is Water?,” asks: “Who is Time? Who is Earth?
Who is Water?”110 Indeed, it is precisely here that the Mazdean
question becomes Who is Fire? rather than What is Fire? As
Bausani notes, “The problem lies in rightly interpreting the verb
is: in which sense are these images of vision what they represent?
Certainly they are not angels in the Biblical and the Qur’anic
sense of mere messengers or servants of God; Corbin compares
them rightly with the dii-angeli of Proclus.”111 This Fire (atar,
adar, atash) in Mazdean texts, as we shall see, is precisely a
divine “person,” an angelic primordial being, who is personified
as the ‘Son’ of Ahura Mazda, and His most Holy Spirit (amesha
spenta). In this precise sense, Fire is not conceived of as a
concept or abstraction, but rather as a “person,” one of the
creative “angelic” cohorts of Mazdean cosmology and cosmogony.
It is crucial to bear in mind this unique mytho-logic operative in
the “style” of the Mazdaic scriptures, throughout this section.

Fire (átar) in the Gáthás plays (both a cosmogonic, as well as)
an important apocalyptico-eschatological role — particularly at
the eschaton or ‘end of time.’112 In Yasna 43:4, it states, “Yes, I
shall (truly) realize Thee to be both brave and virtuous, Wise
One, if Thou shalt help me (now) with the very hand with which
Thou dost hold those rewards Thou shalt give, through the heat
of Thy truth-strong fire, to the deceitful and to the

truthful…”113 This passage gestures towards the eschatological
function of fire/atar at the end of time. Indeed, Insuler in his
note to this verse relates the rewards which Ahura Mazda will
give through “the heat of Thy truth-strong fire” to “the time of
the final judgment” to the “deceitful and to the truthful,”114
namely to the ashavan and dregvan. This passage is profoundly
significant as it links Truth/Order (asha) with Fire, to which we
shall return to in due course.

In another significant passage of the Gathas, the observation
noted above, namely the reversal of What with Who in
Mazdean mytho-logic, becomes directly evident in relation to
the Fire, “Yes I have already realized thee to be virtuous, wise
lord, when he attended me with good thinking. To his question,
“whom dost thou serve?” I then replied: “Thy fire. As long as I
shall be able, I shall respect that truth is to have a gift of
reverence” (Yasna 43:9).115 Indeed, it is precisely to the question
of “whom do you serve,” that Zoroaster responds, “Thy fire,”
thereby personifying the fire, but also pointing to his
identification with the fire and truth, a unito mystica, with his
own heavenly counterpart or twin. Here again Fire is associated
with Truth/Asha, and is considered to be its visible
manifestation. In Yasna 47:6 it states, “Wise Lord together with
this virtuous spirit [spenta mainyu] Thou shalt give the
distribution of the good to both factions through Thy fire, by
reason of the solidarity of piety and truth. For it shall convert
the many who are seeking.”116 What is important in this passage
is the unmistakable link between the Fire of Ahura Mazda, and
His Virtuous Spirit or Holy Spirit (spenta mainyu); and indeed
the locution “it will convert the many who are seeking,” has
clear messianic overtones, as it is the Fire who will “convert the
many,” at the final judgment.

In the Yasna Hapniahitni (The Yasna of the Seven-Chapters)
which is as old as the Gathas (1000-1500 BCE), the divine Fire is
explicitly identified with Ahura Mazda’s Holy Spirit, “As fire
Thou art a joy to the Wise Lord… as the Most Holy Spirit art
thou a joy to him — for this is thy most efficacious name.”117
Another translation of the same Yasna 36:3 reads:

You are indeed the Fire of the Wise Lord.

> You are indeed his most bounteous spirit.
> We approach you O Fire of the Wise Lord,
> With what is the most powerful of your names.118

Here we see that the Fire is identified with Ahura Mazda’s most
Bounteous Spirit, which is variously translated as the Virtuous
Spirit or Holy Spirit (spenta maniyu). It is through this most
powerful of God’s names, Fire (atar), which is synonymous with
the Holy Spirit that the faithful worshiper approaches God. It is
of profound interest here to note that the divine Fire, which is
here referred to as the “Most Powerful of Your Names,” is not
unlike the concept of the Greatest of all names, the shém há
mephorash of Jewish tradition,119 and the Greatest Name of God
(al-ismu’llah al-a’zam) in Islam, and may well have its Mazdean
homologue in the divine Fire. The notion of God’s Greatest
Name or the Most Great Name has a long heritage in the Judeo-
Christian and Islamic traditions and seems to have its ancient
counterpart in the Gathas of Zarathustra regarding the Fire as
the most powerful name of Ahura Mazda. Indeed, it is precisely
in the name Baha’ — termed as ‘the most great name of God’ by
Bahá’u’lláh (al-ismu’llah al-a’zam) — which means at once
glory/light/splendor/beauty that we shall see the very epiphany
and theophany of the divine Fire in Zoroastrianism — a Fire
which is at once ‘the most great name of God’, and the essence
of the symbol of Khvarnah or the Light of Glory. In this precise
sense, it is this Fire typified by the luminous light of the
Khvarnah that shall accompany the Messianic figure, the
Saoshyant, at the eschaton (see below).

In a veritable list of similar passages in the Gathas, the
eschatological appearance of Fire (Atar) and its connection with
Asha may be noted (italics are added for emphasis):

> Yasna 34:4Now, we wish Thy fire, Lord, which possess
> strength through truth [asha] and which is the wisest,
> forceful thing, to be of clear help to Thy supporter but
> of visible harm, with the powers in its hands, to Thy
> enemy, Wise One.

> Yasna 31:19  This knowing world-healer has listened
> [Zarathustra], he who has respected the truth, Lord,
> being one who has mastery over his tongue at will for
> the true speaking of the (proper) words when the
> distribution in the good shall occur to both factions
> through Thy bright fire,120 Wise One.

Whom hast Thou appointed as guardian for
> Yasna 46:7
> me, Wise One, if the deceitful one shall dare to harm
> me? Whom other than Thy fire and Thy (good) thinking
> through whose actions one has nourished the truth,
> Lord?

> Yasna 51:9The satisfaction which Thou shalt give to both
> factions through Thy pure fire and molten iron, Wise
> One, is to be given as a sign among living beings, in
> order to destroy the deceitful and to save the truthful.

In the Younger Avesta, the divine Fire or Atar is personified
with the sublime and theophanic title, the “Son of Ahura
Mazda” (Atars puthra Ahurahe Mazda) (Fire, the Son of God).
Thus we read:

> Yasna 2.To Fire, the son of Ahura Mazda. To you, O
> Fire, son of Ahura Mazda. With propitiation, for
> worship, adoration, propitiation, and praise.

> Yasna 2:12With this libation and Baresman I desire for
> this Yasna you, the Asha-sanctified Atar, the Son of
> Ahura Mazda, the master of Asha, with all Fires.

> Yasna 62: 1.I offer my sacrifice and homage to thee, the
> Fire, as a good offering, and an offering with our hail
> of salvation, even as an offering of praise with
> benedictions, to thee, the Fire, O Ahura Mazda’s son! ...
> 6. And may’st thou grant me, O Fire, Ahura Mazda’s
> Son! that whereby instructors may be (given) me, now
> and for evermore, (giving light to me of Heaven) the
> best life of the saints, brilliant, all glorious. And may I
> have experience of the good reward, and the good

> renown, and of the long forecasting preparation of the
> soul.121

It is evident from the above passages that Fire (atar) is
personified as a “being,” ‘the son of Ahura Mazda,’ who, like
God, is at once the object of love and worship for the faithful.
Fire, is the “most adorable of the most adorable” of the Yazatas,
and considered the primary way and intermediary, by which the
faithful are to draw near the object of their worship, namely
God (Ahura Mazda). This personification of Fire as the Son of
Ahura Mazda is profoundly significant, as it already adumbrates
the coming of the divine Fire as a ‘being’ who is precisely
manifested as Asha (Truth), the messianic figure at the eschaton,
namely the Sayoshant, and not simply an element or an
abstraction symbolizing divine judgment at the end of time.

It is worth mentioning here that the term ‘Son of God’ which
is applied to the Mazdean Fire, may have influenced, early on,
the theophanic title of Jesus as the ‘Son of God’ in the New
Testament, which has no precise precedence in the Jewish
scriptures (i.e., Hebrew Bible).122 Indeed it may be argued that
this title in its Christian context may owe more to the
Zoroastrian heritage of the “Son of God” than to Judaism, for
in all of the Jewish scriptures nowhere can we discover
references to a Messiah, who is at once ‘divine’ and the creator
of the world and is referred to with the epithet ‘Son’ of God.
The great Jewish philosopher Philo of Alexandria (50 CE), calls
the Logos the “Son of God,” and the “only begotten son of
God,”123 and the first manifestation of God, but Philo’s Logos
doctrine does not conceive that the Logos could become
‘embodied’ in a ‘person’ or to be “made flesh.” But, this is
precisely what we discover in Zoroastrianism, namely Fire
personified as the ‘Son of God’ and who shall appear at the end
of time, ‘embodied’ as it were, in the Zoroastrian savior.

The designation ‘Son of God’ and its relation to Fire, the
Holy Spirit, and Truth/Order in Zoroastrianism lend themselves
to a comparative analysis with the lexicon of the New
Testament, which refer to Jesus in similar terms. For instance,
Jesus was asked by Pontus Pilate as to who he was, and he states,
“I am the Truth,” effectively enunciating to be the
“embodiment” or incarnation of Truth, just as the Gathas

foretold the embodiment of the Truth in the eschatological final
judgment. In another place, Jesus states, “I am the way, the
truth and the life” (John 14:6), and in another instance turning
to his disciples he states, you shall be baptized by the “Holy
Spirit and by Fire,” thereby equating fire with the Holy Spirit,
precisely as it is found in the Zoroastrian scriptures. Indeed, the
Logos of John 1:1, which appears in the “flesh,” namely Jesus of
Nazareth, is the “Light, which shineth in darkness, but the
darkness comprehendeth not,” again evokes classic Zoroastrian
motifs of light and darkness. The New Testament concept of the
virgin birth of Jesus is likely more related to the Zoroastrian
conception of the virgin birth of the Sayoshant, than to any
references or precedents in the Jewish scriptures (see below).
Indeed this should be of no surprise, as the influence of Iranian
motifs, especially apocalyptic and eschatological motifs, on
Judaism, Buddhism, Christianity, Manichaeism, and Islam, are
well known, and have received general scholarly consensus
among Iranologists.

Now let us see how in the Gathas (and other Zoroastrian
texts), the divine Fire (who is called the Son of God) is
intimately linked with the divine Truth/Order called Asha124
(Avestan, Arta, Asha or Asha Vahishata, Best Truth, Middle
Persian, Urdiwahasht or Urdibehesht, which can also be
translated as Order, Righteousness, cosmic and moral order) and
the ‘Virtuous Spirit’ (Spenta Mainyu) which may also be
translated as the ‘Holy Spirit,’ through which all of creation
comes into being.125 Asha is one of the six Archangelic beings or
Amesha Spentas (Ahura Mazda himself being the seventh —
forming together a divine Heptad), which all have a
corresponding element, “these six Amesha Spentas are also the
archangelic emblem-personification of the primordial elements:
Earth (Spenta Armaiti), Cattle (Vohu Manah), Fire (Asha),
Metals (Khshathra), Water (Haurvatat), Plants (Ameretat).”126
Indeed, as Bausani perceptively points out, these Amesha
Spentas or archangelic beings “are the elements not as allegories
of them, but as living personal symbols, as “Lords of the
Species.” The concept of Ratu, Lord of the Species, is present
everywhere in Mazdaic books. The Lord of the Species
“Woman” is, for instance, the mythico-historical Daena,
‘religion’…”127 Hence, Asha does not only allegorize or

symbolize Fire, but is the Fire, insofar as it is its Lord of the
Species. Indeed, it was Suhrawardi who equated the Platonic
Forms with the Zoroastrian Angelic entities (yazatas),128 and
who “designates them the “lords of the species” (arbáb al-anwá’)
(see Harawi, Anváriyyih, pp. 41-42), an expression which
Bahá’u’lláh confirms in a Tablet in which He explains the
meaning of the “active force” [fa’il] mentioned in the Tablet of
Wisdom. In that Tablet, He says: “The intention of the active
force is the lord of the species, and it hath other meanings”

[Áthár-i-Qalam A’lá, vol. 7, p. 113].”

Indeed, all of the seven Amesha Spentas form together a kind
of unio mystica which is alluded to in Yasht 19:16.

> Who are all seven of one thought, who are all seven of
> one speech, who are all seven of one deed; whose
> thought is the same, whose speech is the same, whose
> deed is the same, whose father and commander is the
> same, namely, the Maker, Ahura Mazda.130

It is important to note also that in the Gathas the Holy Spirit,
Fire, and Asha are all linked together. As it states, “A person
shall bring to realization the best… according to the single
understanding: the Wise One is the Father of Truth (a⌃a). Wise
Lord, together with this virtuous spirit [spenta maniyu] Thou
shalt give the distribution in the good to both factions through
thy fire” [Yasna 47:2, 6]. It is precisely by the Virtuous Spirit or
Holy Spirit, which is here linked with Asha/Truth, that the Wise
Lord shall distribute good or justice to both factions through
His Fire. This passage is precisely in the context of eschatology,
when Fire will appear and act as a judge through which good or
justice will be distributed to the ashavan or followers of truth,
and to the dregavan or the followers of falsehood. Stanly Insler
in his comments to the translation of the Gathas states, “Fire
was considered to be a manifestation of truth. Therefore
worship of the fire was worship of the truth.”131 Similarly Mary
Boyce states: “Zoroaster … apprehended fire as the creation of
A⌃a Vahi⌃ta (q.v.), and … saw fire as the instrument of God’s
judgment at the Last Day.” Indeed it was to remember this fact
that the prophet Zarathustra states in Yasna 43.9: “At the

offering made in reverence (to fire) I shall think of truth (a⌃a) to
the utmost of my power.”132

Now let us look further into the Gathas to see if this divine
Truth/Order/Asha which forms with Fire a dualitude or syzygy,
has a conceptual parallel like that of the Primal Fire as the active
agent though whom all creation comes into being (i.e., the
cosmogonic cause), and who will be embodied in the world as a
Saviour, the Saoshyant, in eschatological times (much like the
tablet(s) of Bahá’u’lláh to Zoroastrians). In Gatha 48:6 it states,
“And the Wise One shall increase the plants for her through
Truth [asha], He who is to be Lord at the birth of the foremost
existence.”133 Here the pre-existence and personification of
Asha is described as “He,” “who is to be Lord at the birth of the
foremost existence.” This title ‘Lord of foremost existence’ may
be related to both cosmogony and eschatology, namely to the
notion of Frashegird or the making “brilliant” or “luminous” of
creation at the end of time. Indeed, most scholars have noted
that Asha is part of the creative/cosmogonic principle of Ahura
Mazda, as Boyce puts it succinctly:

> As the hypostasis of what should be in the physical
> sphere, i.e., order, regularity, A⌃a is present “in the
> beginning, at creation,” when Ahura Mazdá fixed the
> course of sun, moon and stars (Y. 44.3). It is through
> him that Ahura Mazdá made the plants grow (Y. 48.6),
> and he has the epithet “world-furthering,” fradá
> t.gaétha- [Y. 33.11].

Thus Asha is a pre-existent being that was present “in the
beginning at creation,” and that it is through him that God set
the cosmos in order (i.e., sun, moon, and stars), and that it is
through Asha that things grow (i.e., plants and other existent
things) and have their existence. Indeed, this recalls the Logos
(often translated as Word, which also means Order, or Logic,
and is the conceptual cognate of Asha) in John 1:1, which was
there “in the beginning,” and through whom all things were
created, just as it is with Asha. Furthermore, the cosmogonic
epithet “world-furthering,” fradá t.gaétha” is further testimony
to the eternal creative agency of Asha. Hultgård also in
reference to the above passage in Yasna 44: 3-5 also notes that,

“the oldest Avestan texts, the Gathas, pay homage to Ahura
Mazda as father and “creator” of the universe (Y. 44: 3-5; the
word datar meaning here “one who sets [chaos] into order”).”134
What is interesting is that the Avestan word datar, which is one
of the masculine noun r stems literally meaning ‘giver’, is
related to the word atar in the same stem — the adjectival form
of nominative singular atarsh (átar⌃) — which is precisely the
word for fire.135 Indeed here we have an early linguistic relation
of Truth/Order (asha) with Fire.

Now it is in the same important hymn of the Gathas, namely
Yasna 43, that a link is established between Truth/Asha and the
Saoshyant, meaning “He who will bring benefit,” and his
‘embodiment’ on earth at the time of the renovation or
frashegird. Indeed, as Shakad has noted “One of the clear
eschatological terms in the Gáthás is Sao⌃yant, the future
benefactor, a term which may have originally applied to
Zoroaster himself (e.g., Y. 46.3; cf. Boyce, 1975, pp. 234 ff.).136

> Yasna 43:16 Therefore, Lord, this Zarathustra chooses
> that very spirit of Thine which indeed is the most
> virtuous of all, wise one. “May truth [Asha] be
> embodied and strong with breath. May there be piety
> under the rule of Him who has the appearance of the
> sun. May He dispense through His good thinking (each
> reward).137

Here the messianic and eschatological hope of the coming of
Asha is clearly stated by the prophet Zarathustra himself, that
“Asha may be embodied” or become ‘flesh’ as it were, and be
“strong with breath,” namely as a living and breathing human
being, who is later identified with the Saoshyant or the savior in
Zoroastrianism. The messianic name, Astvat-ereta, “he who
embodies Asha,” was given to the Saoshyant and developed
from this very last passage of Yasna 43:16. As Boyce states,

> Zoroaster’s community held ardently to hope in the
> coming of this man [Astvat-ereta], to whom was given
> the title Sao⌃yant, “He who will bring benefit,” and
> gradually it came to be believed that he would be born
> of the seed of Zoroaster himself, miraculously

> preserved at the bottom of a lake, where it is watched
> over by the frava⌃is (see Frawahr) of the just. When
> Fra⌃ō.kəәrəәti is near, it is held, a virgin will bathe in this

> name is evidently derived, with a small dialect
> difference, from Zoroaster’s own words in Y. 43.16:
> astvaṱ a⌃əәm hyáṱ “may righteousness [asha] be
> embodied.”138

Indeed the Saoshyant, who is entitled Astvat-ereta, will radiate
the luminous and fiery Khvarnah or Light of Glory, which does
not only accompany kings, but prophetic and messianic figures,
including Zoroaster himself. As Boyce further notes:

> Astvat-ereta will be accompanied, as his father was
> before him, and as all righteous kings and heroes are, by
> Xᵛarəәnah, Divine Grace (see Xwarrah), and it is in Ya⌃t
> 19, which celebrates Xᵛarəәnah, that the extant Avesta
> has most to tell of him. There the worshippers declare:
> “We sacrifice to the mighty ... kingly Xᵛarəәnah ... which
> will accompany the victorious Sao⌃yant ... so that he
> may make existence new again, not ageing, not dying,
> not decaying” [Yt. 19.88-89].139

Now in the Middle Persian or Pahlavi texts, both cosmogonic
and eschatological functions of the divine Fire are further
elaborated. Indeed, the cosmogonic aspect of the divine and
celestial fire becomes more pronounced in the Pahlavi text
called Bundahi⌃n (Creation), as J. Duchense-Guillemin states,
“In Mazdean orthodoxy when Ohrmazd creates the world, he
produces at first, from Infinite Light, a form of fire, from
which all things are to be born. This form of fire is, “bright,
white, round, and visible from afar…. [emphasis added]”140 This
is the passage of the Bundahi⌃n that Duchense-Guillemin refers
to, “Ohrmazd fashioned forth the form of His creatures from
His own self, from the substance of light — in the form of fire,
bright, white, round, visible afar.”141 Here we have a pre-
existent being in the “form of fire” through which all things are
created and which has a clear cosmogonic function. It is

interesting to note that this fire is linked with Ohrmazd himself
and is created from the substance of his own light. Guillemin
points out that another Pahlavi text gives “the name of this
giant body, or form of fire… in the Datistan-i Danik [it is
written]… that ‘Ohrmazd, the Lord of all things, produced from
Infinite Light, a form of fire whose name was that of Ohrmazd
and whose light was that of fire.’”142 In his reflection on this
enigmatic passage Duchense-Guillemin states: “Ohrmazd
creating a body which is called Ohrmazd — what can be the
meaning of this? It seems to me that everything becomes clear if
we are prepared to consider the phrase as a clumsy adaptation
of a Zurvinite one which said in effect: Zurvan creates Ohrmazd
— not forgetting that in Manichaeism, Ohrmazd is the name of
Cosmic Man, issued from the supreme god Zurvan.”143 But,
though Duchense-Guillemin is correct in his reading that there
seems to be a Zurvinite influence on this otherwise orthodox
Mazdean cosmogony, yet there is an ancient precedent in the
Avesta, in which the “form of fire,” especially the ritual fire, is
conceived symbolically as the “shape” or “body” of Ahura
Mazda. In the Yasna of the Seven Chapters, in Yasna 36: “the
ritual fire is addressed as Ahura Mazda’s most beautiful shape”:

> We proclaim, O Wise Lord, That these lights are your
> most beautiful shape of shapes, since that highest of the
> high was called the sun.144

In another Pahlavi text, the Denkard (Acts of Religion), a
similar cosmogonic function of the Fire is deployed, with clear
Neo-Platonic influences. As Mansour Shaki puts it, “Blending
traditional tenets with Neo-Platonic doctrine, the passage
recounts that the creator first fashions from the Endless Light
the all-embracing form of fire (âsrô-kerp), which emanates two
instruments of equal creative powers: the Spirit of the Power of
the Soul (mênôg î wax⌃ nêrôg) and the Spirit of the Power of
Nature (mênôg î chihr nêrôg).”145 Hence, even in the scheme
presented in the Denkard, which is a mixture of Neo-Platonic
emanationism with traditional Mazdean cosmogony, the “form
of fire” is what brings the process of emanation and hence
creation into being. Just as in Mazdean cosmogony the
luminous divine Fire is at the origin or beginning of creation
and is the means by which creation is existentiated, so also, Fire

figures as the quintessential feature of the drama of the end, at
the eschaton, and the renovation (frashegird) of the world.
Indeed, the Pahlavi texts speak of the eschatological appearance
of the Fire at the end of time as a “person” or a human figure.
In the Zatspram or Zadspram we read, “In the end, manifest and
plain, there will be seen by night and in the atmosphere a form
of fire, in the shape of a man, conceived by the spiritual gods,
riding as it were, a fiery horse, and fearful (to behold): and they
shall be freed from doubt.”146 Here a similar “form of fire”
which at the beginning of creation, in pre-existence, brought
forth the creation of all things (cosmogony), appears in the
“shape of a man,” at the end of time (eschatology), as a savior
riding upon a horse. Indeed, this passage recalls the figure of
Logos in the Apocalypse of John riding upon a white horse, and
is evocative of the Oracle of Hystapes, and may have been
influenced by it.

> And I saw heaven opened, and behold a white horse; and
> he that sat upon him was called Faithful and True, and
> in righteousness he doth judge and make war. His eyes
> were as a flame of fire, and on his head were many
> crowns; and he had a name written, that no man knew,
> but he himself. And he was clothed with a vesture
> dipped in blood: and his name is called “The Word of
> God.” [Rev. 19:11-13]

Indeed, the Word of God or Logos in the Apocalypse of
John, whose eyes are like “flames of fire” has clear Zoroastrian
overtones. It is also worth noting that this vision of Christ or
the Word of God is regarding his second appearance or
parousia. In another instance, Hultgård also paraphrases a
portion of Wizidagiha-i Zadspram, stating that, “the great fire
is likened to a huge human figure holding in his hand a tree with
the branches above and the roots below. The branches will take
the righteous and bring them to paradise the roots will seize the
wicked and drop them in hell [WZ 35:40, 44].” Thus, the
symbolism of the “great fire,” “in the shape of a man,” a theos
anthropos, alludes to a messianic figure, a soter or savior, the
Saoshyant, who will come at the end of the Zoroastrian aeon
(age), and through whom the “righteous” will enter paradise and
the “wicked” into hell: a classic motif attributed to Fire as

divider of the ashavan and dreagvan at the final judgement, that
as we have seen, goes back to the Gathas themselves. This form
or shape of fire is also mentioned in a Manichaean text in
Middle Persian called Shapuragan in the context of eschatology
and the end of the aeon. It describes in vivid terms the
eschatological Day of Judgment, in which “the Great Fire
ascends to the heavens in the chihr (i.e., shape) of Ohrmazd-
bagh (The Primordial Man).”147 Thus in Mazdaism and
Manichaeism, the heavenly and celestial Fire is visualized as a
sacred person.

In Iranian apocalyptic imaginary there is a sublime
correspondence between the beginning (cosmogony) and the end
(eschatology), as Hultgård has observed: “One cannot
understand Persian Apocalypticism without taking into
consideration its context within cosmic history. There is an
inner coherence between the beginning and the end that is
unique to the Iranian worldview.”148 Kreyenbroek also notes this
homology of the beginning with the end in Mazdean thought
stating that, “in Zoroastrian eschatology as it developed since
the time of the Prophet [Zarathustra], the Last Things have
come to mirror the First things [Cosmogony] am lost
completely, although in a compressed form.”149 In his brief
description of the stages of cosmogony in the Pahlavi texts he
states, in the early creation “Fire brings movement” and towards
the “End of Time” “Fire and Molten metal cleanse the
world…”150 In this precise sense, the dialectic of fire and
movement is linked in Zoroastrianism to cosmogony, just as it
is in Bahá’u’lláh’s Persianate tablets. In fact, Kreyenbroek
observes that of the various “elements of eschatology, only the
cleansing flow of molten metal, has no obvious counterpart in
the cosmogony. As it plays an important role in the Gathas, it
seems likely that its presence in Zoroastrian eschatology goes
back directly to Zarathustra’s teaching.”151 It is in this Mazdean
sense that Jesus in the Apocalypse of John states, “I am the First
or the Beginning (alpha) and the Last or the End (omega)” [Rev.
1:17; 2:8; 22:13]. Indeed, Bahá’u’lláh in a similar manner correlates
the beginning with the end, he states, “Know thou that the end
is like unto the beginning. Even as thou dost consider the
beginning, similarly shouldst thou consider the end, and be of
them that truly perceive. Nay, rather consider the beginning as

the end itself, and so conversely, that thou mayest acquire a
clear perception” [TB 183]. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’ also states that in all
the great spiritual cycles “the origins and ends are the same”
[BWF 400] Namely that each cycle of divine revelation begins by
the Manifestation of the Primal Will, symbolized here by the
celestial Fire, and ends with its appearance again on the plain of
history. Thus cosmogony mirrors eschatology and vice versa,
and each cycle of the self-revelation and theophany of the
Primal Will, is itself a microcosm of the process of cosmogony.
As it is abundantly clear in the Mazdean context the world
comes into being through the divine Fire and ends by the
coming of Fire, which personified and embodied as the salvific
appearance of Truth/Asha in the form of the Saoshyant, will
radiate the Fire of the divine “Glory,” namely the Khvarnah.

Bahá’u’lláh as the Fire and Light of the Divine
Glory ( Khvarnah )

There is a profound correspondence and sublime homology
between Zoroastrianism and the Bahá’í faith152 — these twin
religions of the soil of Iran, “the earth of Light” — which may
be gestured at the outset of this section by an emblematic
episode in the life of Bahá’u’lláh, in which he states to his
prison interrogators in ‘Akka, who upon insisting as to his name
and native home land exclaimed: “My name is Bahá’u’lláh (Light
of God), and my country is Nur (Light).”153 It is here that
Bahá’u’lláh in a sublime hermeneutical turn simultaneously
reveals the spiritual correspondence, the syzygy, between his
heavenly abode, and his earthly homeland, a land which is the
realm of spiritual Light(s) in the pleroma of the world of Lahut,
and which in the sacred topography of this world, and the
coordinates of the world of Nasut (the physical world), is the
land of Iran (often referred to in our texts as mahd-i amr’ullah
or the cradle of the Cause of God), in the province of
Mazandaran called Nur (Light). Indeed, it is in the very name of
Baha’ (Allah) that we shall discover the manifestation of the
divine Fire, not least typified by one of the most sublime
concepts in all of Mazdeanism, namely the Khvarnah.

One of the aspects of the divine Fire in Zoroastrianism is the
sublime concept of Khvarnah, the “Divine Glory” or “Light of
Glory,” as Corbin calls it.154 Khvarnah, the Avestan term for
‘Splendour’ or ‘Glory’ (Old Persian farnah, middle Persian
khwarr, new Persian khurrah or farr), is derived from khvar, ‘to
shine, to illuminate’, and was translated into Greek as doxa or
glory. This luminous and radiant glory is not only characteristic
of Yima (Jamshid), the first king in Mazdean mytho-history (and
of Royal light of kingly authority and legitimacy in general),
and Zarathustra as the prophet of God, but also of the future
messianic savior(s), the Saoshyant(s). In iconography, it is
typified by the luminous halo or Aura Gloriae of kings and
priests (such as the relief of Kartir at Naqsh-i Rostam and
Naqsh-i Rajab) in Zoroastrianism, and which influenced the
iconography of Buddhism (the halo behind the head of the
Buddha), Christianity (the halo represented behind Jesus Christ
in paintings and icons), and Islam (represented by both a halo
and flames of fire emanating from behind the head of prophet
Muhammad in miniatures and paintings).

The relation of Khvarnah to the sacred Fire, has often been
noted by various scholars, for example, Jackson states, “the
essence of fire manifests itself in the form of the huvarenah
[khavarnah]…”155 In many of the passages of the Avesta
Khvarnah is a “power of luminous and fiery nature.”156 For
instance it is in Yasht 10:127 that the “‘strong’ (uγra-) xᵛarəәnah-
of the kauui- is identified with a “blazing fire” (átar⌃
yōupa.suxtō) that precedes Mithra in his chariot.”157 Indeed, all
the three great sacred Zoroastrian fires of ancient Iran, namely
“Farnbág, Gu⌃nasp, and Burzén-Mihr,” were thought to be the
visible manifestation of “the divine “Glory of Fire” (Av. atarəә
xvarəәnah-) which is the hypostasis of the power and “glory” in
all fires (see Bd. 18.15).”158 It is in one of the Pahlavi scriptures,
the Revayat, that another link is established between the Fire
and Daena, as it states, “the spirit of Fire itself, will be present
“with the other Ame⌃aspands” to receive the righteous soul at
the Činvat Bridge.”159 Here it is the Fire, like the Daena the
heavenly twin of the soul, who will be the one to receive the
soul of the righteous in its post-mortem heavenly voyage. As
Corbin states, “that is why Daena is also Xvarnah [Khvarnah],
personal Glory and Destiny, and as such is ‘thine Aeon, thine

Eternity.’”160 Thus, the soul’s archetypal counterpart, its twin, is
at once Daena and Khvarnah, and may be linked to what
‘Abdu’l-Bahá has termed “the heavenly spirit” or the “spirit of
Faith” (ruh-i iman), which may be linked to the concept of
Daena (the Maiden) signifying at once religion, the soul’s
double/twin, and a maiden.161 In his discussion of five types of
spirit Abdu’l-Bahá states, “The fourth degree of spirit is the
heavenly spirit; it is the spirit of faith and the bounty of God; it
comes from the breath of the Holy Spirit, and by the divine
power it becomes the cause of eternal life. It is the power which
makes the earthly man heavenly…” [SAQ 144]

Indeed, as we have seen the celestial Fire is linked to the
radiance of the Zoroastrian savior or Saoshyant, and the flaming
majesty or glory that is Khvarnah, which accompanies all the
Zoroastrian saviors, including Zoroaster himself, and whose
being permeates and radiates the Light of Glory (khvarnah). The
Denkard (Acts of Religion), one of the Pahlavi texts, describes
in mytho-poetic terms the birth of the prophet Zarathustra in
which three days prior to his birth, his mother, Frin, became so
radiant and luminous that the whole village was immersed in
light. The inhabitants thought that a great fire had been set
ablaze and hurriedly evacuated the village. But, upon their
return they came to find a boy full of brilliance had been born.
When the mother of Zarathustra was fifteen, she irradiated light
wherever she moved. The Denkard explains that the sublime
radiance that emanated from her was due to the Khvarnah that
dwelt in her.162 In another Pahlavi text the Zádspram,
“Zoroaster’s xwarrah [Khvarnah] is said to have descended from
heaven and become manifest “in the form of fire” (pad átax⌃
éwénag) at the moment of his birth (5.1, 8.8).”163 The motif of
this supra-natural splendor or light, which accompanied the
birth of Zarathustra, is also evident in Islamic Sira narratives
concerning the birth of Muhammad. According to Ibn Ishaq,
when the mother of prophet Muhammad, Amina, was pregnant
with him, she witnessed in a dream that a light radiated from her
belly to the castles of Syria.164

The dramatic setting of the revelation of prophet Zarathustra
is also characterized by the supra-natural splendour of the
heavenly Fire that radiated upon the mountain where the

prophet had retired. The Greek philosopher Dion Chrysostom
of Prusa (d. 112), “mentions the highest peak on which
Zarathustra retired in order to “live in the way that was his
own,” and where a ceremony of ecstasy, invisible to the eyes of
the profane, unfolds in a setting of fire and supernatural
splendor.”165Indeed, this event has its similitude in Bahá’u’lláh’s
own retirement to the mountains of Sulaymaniyyah in Iraqi
Kurdistan (after his epiphanic encounter with the luminous
Maiden (huriyya), the symbol of the Holy Spirit and his own self
or ‘Twin’), where some of his sublime poetical outpourings such
as the qasída-i `izz-i varqaiyya or “the Ode of the Dove” were
penned, at the request of Naqshbandi Sufis, among whom
Bahá’u’lláh lived at the time.

Now, it is precisely in one of the poems of the Baghdad
period (1853-63), penned during his two-year retirement to the
Sulaymaniyyah mountains that Bahá’u’lláh states that he is the
Divine Light of Glory (farr iláhí):

That King, through whose Command the world is

recreated,
> From whose breath, Christ’s spirit came to life.
That Divine Light of Glory (farr iláhí), from whose

Decree, the Holy Spirit, is made a humble servant.166

Here Bahá’u’lláh identifies himself, in the third person, with the
Zoroastrian farr iláhí or Divine Light of Glory, and which is
also at once personified and symbolized in his person and name,
Baha’. This is the clearest textual basis for Bahá’u’lláh’s claim to
possess the farr iláhí or the Divine Light of Glory. In fact,
Bahá’u’lláh’s messianic claim to be the appearance of the
Mazdean divine Fire is precisely co-extensive with being the
manifestation of Khvarnah, for as we have seen, Khvarnah is the
victorial Fire, and it is precisely this Fire which will symbolically
radiate from the Zoroastrian savior. Indeed it is in the Arabic
verbal noun Baha’, meaning at once, splendour, glory, radiant
light, and beauty, that the term Khvarnah, Khurrah, farr itself
becomes translated and transferred into Arabic as Baha’. This is
accomplished through the mystical lexicon of Suhrawardi, the
Shaykh al-Ishraq. In this respect the work of this great martyr

philosopher of Iran, acts as a spiritual bridge — a chintvat
bridge as it were — between Mazdean and Islamic Iran, to the
Bahá’í faith. It is worth citing an extended passage in Corbin’s
In Iranian Islam, in which he discusses the translation of
Khvarnah as Baha’, in Suhrawardi’s Hikmat al-Ishraq (the
Philosophy of Illumination):

> Other terms make as many allusions to these “sources of
> the Light of Glory” [Khvarnah] during the course of the
> book. As we have stated, the book of Oriental
> Theosophy [Hikmat al-Ishraq] begins with a radical

> which “Angels who draw others to the Orient” advance

> exactly by the Arabic bahâ (beauty, flash, splendor).
> “Sources of Beauty,” on this page is therefore
> equivalent to Yanâbî al-Khurrah, the Sources of the

> “Sources of Life” and “Sources of Light and Life” on
> other pages. The Source is itself not an object of
> knowledge but that what makes it gush forth [emphasis
> added].168

Here, as Corbin observes, the term Khvarnah in Suhrawardi’s
lexicon becomes “translated exactly by the Arabic Baha’,” and
that the “Sources of Beauty” (Yanbu al-Bahá), and the Sources
of the Light of Glory, namely Yanabi al-Khurrah, become
mutually interchangeable terms. In one of the Persianate tablets
of Bahá’u’lláh, he states that by his manifestation, “…the

luminous rays of the Imperishable world are resplendent (ishraq)
from the Dawning-place of the Will (mashriq-i iradih) of the
Merciful.”169 That is to say, that through his appearance the
primal Will shines resplendent in the world. Such texts not only
recall Zoroastrian motifs of celestial light and divine radiance,
but at once evoke the mystical lexicon so characteristic of the
school of Ishraq, the illuminationist philosophy of Suhrawardi.
Thus here through the medium of the Suhrawardian corpus, we
have a precise cognate in the translation of the term Khvarnah
into the Arabic Baha’, a translation which is perfectly
exemplified in the very name of Baha’(Allah), who claims to be
the manifestation and theophany of the Mazdean divine Fire,
and he who embodies and radiates the divine Light of Glory, the
“Victorial Fire,” namely the Khvarnah.

In another ingenious turn Bahá’u’lláh mystically alludes to
himself as the embodiment of Khvarnah by evoking one of the
ancient symbols associated with the Light of Glory, namely the
royal Falcon (shah-baz). In the Table to Manakji Sahib
Bahá’u’lláh states:

> The Tongue of Wisdom [kherad] proclaimeth: He that
> hath Me not is bereft of all things. Turn ye away from
> all that is on earth and seek none else but Me. I am the
> Sun of Wisdom [aftab-i binesh] and the Ocean of
> Knowledge [darya-ye danesh]. I cheer the faint and
> revive the dead. I am the guiding Light [roshanaee] that
> illumineth the way. I am the royal Falcon [shah-baz] on
> the arm of the Almighty. I unfold the drooping wings
> of every broken bird and start it on its flight.170

The obvious allusion to the art of falconry notwithstanding,
in this passage to the Zoroastrian literati Manakji Sahib,
Bahá’u’lláh, by referring to himself as the royal Falcon (shah-
baz), is subtly proclaiming to his interlocutor — who
presumably would know the symbolic association of the Falcon
with Khvarnah — that he is the Khvarnah, the divine Light of
Glory.171 Indeed, in Iranian textual and iconographical sources
the falcon is the symbol of the Khvarnah par excellence. In
certain Kushan coins (1-2 CE) the Khvarnah is represented, not
only as a human figure with flames of fire radiating from it, but

also as a “bird of prey, whether eagle or falcon.”172 It was in
Yasht 19:34-35 that Khvarnah assumed the form of a bird and
abandoned Yima (Jamshid), as the Yasht states, “…Khvarnah was
seen to depart from him [Yima] in the shape of a bird…
Khvarnah went from shining Yima… in the shape of a hawk
[varegna].”173 Another iconographical source that represents the
Khvarnah is in Persepolis, exemplified by the bird like winged-
disk on the Achaemenid brick-panels, which evokes the
“metamorphosis” of the Khvarnah into a falcon. The term
varegna which has variously been translated as falcon, hawk, or
eagle, may be best rendered into English as falcon. Sodovar
examining many textual and iconographical sources of the
Khvarnah concludes that, “these sources all tend to confirm the
association of flacons — rather than eagles — with the
khvarnah.”174 Finally, in one of the iconographies of the
Khvarnah, in which it is depicted as a falcon, the falcon is
carrying in its claws two pearls (see the Song of the Pearl
above). Indeed, in the Qur’an the maidens of paradise —
huriyya, are likened “unto hidden pearls” [Qur’an 56:23], a symbol
associated at once with the Khvarnah and the Daena (Maiden) in
Zoroastrianism and with the Maid of Heaven in Bahá’u’lláh’s
oeuvre. Thus, in this precise sense, Bahá’u’lláh is the royal
Falcon, which is the Khvarnah and the embodiment of
Khvarnah, the bearer of the Aura Gloriae, the Divine Fire and
Light of Glory: the visible manifestation of the divine and
celestial Fire. It is precisely this Divine Light or Glory that was
to accompany the Saoshyant, the messianic figure of
Zoroastrianism par excellence, who is to appear at the end of
the aeon and shine resplendent with its light.

Incidentally, there is a profound homologue between the
falcon and Símurgh, the fabulous and great “Saéna bird,” which
“derives from Avestan məәrəәγô saênô ‘the bird Saêna’, originally
a raptor, either eagle or falcon, as can be deduced from the
etymologically identical Sanskrit s‚yena‚”175 meaning falcon.
Indeed, the Saéna is conceptualized as a colossal falcon, “which
has its perch on the Tree of All Seeds or of All Healing’ (Yt.
12:17), and which by its great weight and the beating of its
wings breaks the twigs of this tree and scatters its seeds, which
wind and rain then carry over the earth”176 Indeed, in Yasht
14\.41 “Vəәrəәthraγna [Wahram/Bahram], the deity of victory,

wraps xᵛarnah [Khvarnah]… round the house of the worshipper…
like the great bird Saéna, and as the watery clouds cover the
great mountains, which means that Saéna will bring rain.”177 In
this precise sense, the luminous Khvarnah, the royal Falcon, and
the Símurgh are all symbolically co-extensive with one another.
It is here that in a profound hermeneutical turn, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá
states that the mytho-poetic figure of the Símurgh, symbolically
signifies none other than Bahá’u’lláh. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá in a tablet
to one of the believers who resided in Shemiran, which lies on
the slopes of the Alborz mountain outside the City of Tehran,
states:

> But, the change of weather in Shemiran is due to the
> Bird of Love in the vicinity of the All-Merciful. That
> place is not the dwelling place of birds; it is the
> dwelling-place of the ‘Anqa’ of the East, and the nest of
> the Símurgh of Mount Qaf. For the Blessed Beauty…
> resided for one year during the summer season, in that
> pure and fragrant grove…178

In this passage ‘Abdu’l-Bahá at once makes the ‘Anqa’ and the
Símurgh co-terminous,179 and provides a mystical interpretation
of Bahá’u’lláh as the Símurgh, and indicates that the weather of
Shemiran, which was once cold and inhospitable, has become
mild and pleasant, due to Bahá’u’lláh’s presence in that region
for a time. In another tablet ‘Abdu’l-Bahá provides a further
hermeneutical register to the Símurgh and its legendary
dwelling-place on the mystical Mount Qaf in Islamic literature
and Sufi discourse. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá refers to the Báb who was
imprisoned in Chehriq, in Northwestern Iran in the province of
Azarbaijan, and continues to state that “for a time His Holiness
Zoroaster also travelled and sojourned in those regions [i.e.,
Azarbaijan]. And Mount Qaf, which hath been mentioned in
Narrations and Traditions, is none other then Qafqaz [the
Caucasus], and it is the belief of Iranians [i.e., Zoroastrians]
that it is the nest of the Símurgh, and the dwelling place of the
‘Anqa’ of the East.”180 Here, in a unique linguistic turn, ‘Abdu’l-
Bahá equates Mount Qaf with the Qaf in the name of Qafqaz
or the Caucasus in the Azarbaijan region of Iran. Indeed,
another profound homologue may be found in the mystical and

visionary treatises of Suhrawardi, particularly the Persian
treatise, ‘The Símurgh’s Shrill Cry’ (Safír-i Símurgh):

> This treatise… is called ‘The Simurgh’s Shrill Cry.’ It
> would not be detrimental to recall, by way of an
> introductory preface, something of this bird’s
> conditions and place of habitation. Those who have
> been illuminated have shown that every hoopoe that
> abandons his nest in springtime and plucks his feathers
> with his beak and sets off for Mount Qaf will fall
> under the shadow of Mount Qaf within the span of a
> thousand years of [the time referred to in the text],
> ‘one day with thus Lord is as thousand years, of those
> which ye compute [Koran, 22:47]. These thousand years,
> in the calendar of the People of Reality, are but one
> dawning ray from the orient of the Divine Realm
> [Mashriq-i Lahut-i Azam]. During this the hoopoe
> becomes a Simurgh whose shrill cry awakens those who
> are asleep. The Simurgh’s nest is on Mount Qaf. His cry
> reaches everyone, but he has few listeners; everyone is
> with him, but most are without him.181

Indeed, the description of the Símurgh by Suhrawardi is
consonant with the Bahá’í concept of hiero-history or
“progressive revelation,” in which once about every thousand
years or so, a Manifestation of God (mazhar iláhí), symbolized
here as the Símurgh, appears and inaugurates a new religious
dispensation or spiritual cycle. Now it is also noteworthy that
the last sentence in which Bahá’u’lláh states, “I unfold the
drooping wings of every broken bird and start it on its
flight”(see above), recalls the great mystical epic of Faríd ud-
Dín ‘Attár (c. 1142 — c. 1220) the Conference of the Birds
(Manteq aṭ-Ṭayr), in which the Hoopoe (hudhud)182 leads the
birds upon a spiritual voyage towards the King of the birds, the
Símurgh, where through perhaps one of the greatest mystical
puns in Persian poetics, only thirty birds remain, literally sí
(thirty) morgh (bird[s]), who thereby see themselves mirrored in
the Símurgh. Here the sī-murgh (thirty birds) encounters its own
heavenly double, its twin, in the Sīmurgh. In this precise sense,
the symbolism of ‘Attár’s poetics may be read not as a union of
the soul with the Divine per se (which is a characteristic reading

of the dramatic dénouement of the epic), but rather as a subtle
gesture towards the Mazdean motif of the soul’s encounter with
its heavenly twin.

Now just as we have seen with the divine Fire (atar), the
Khvarnah or the Light of Glory, is also endowed with
cosmogonic and eschatological functions in the Zoroastrian
scriptures. In Yasht 19:10 it is written that Ahura Mazda
possesses the Khvarnah in order to “create all the creatures.”183
Corbin refers to the sublime and luminous entity of the
Khvarnah, as an “Energy,” which has been “operative from the
initial instant of the formation of the world until the final act
announced and forecast in the technical term Frsahkart, which
designates the transfiguration to be accomplished at the end of
the Aeon by the Saoshyants or Saviors…” Indeed, in Yasht 19 it
states that it is through the Khvarnah, that “Ahura Mazda has
created the many and good … beautiful, marvelous … creatures,
full of life, resplendent.”184 Thus, it is in such texts as Yasht 19,
dedicated to the Khvarnah, that the cosmogonic function of
this divine Fire of Glory is explicitly confirmed.

Although, the Khvarnah is often related to the sacral
authority of kings and of spiritual and temporal sovereignty, it
is not exclusive to prophets and kings. Human beings are also
endowed with the Khvarnah, and “at the final, eschatological
renovation (frasha), this supernatural light [khvarnah] will
adorn all of them: “the great light appearing as coming forth
from the body will shine continually over the earth… and this
light will be their garment, resplendent, immortal, exempt from
old age.”185 Indeed, according to Bahá’í mystical hermeneutics,
these beings of light, who will accompany the Saoshyant, and
will radiate the Khvarnah or the Light of Glory, are the people
of Baha’ (ahl-i baha), who are the beings of Light, which is
precisely the etymological meaning of Bahá’í: namely the
followers of the Light/Glory or beings of Light/Glory. As
‘Abdu’l-Bahá’ states:

> The Lord of Hosts [i.e., Bahá’u’lláh] hath descended
> with the army of lights and angels of heaven [i.e.,
> Bahá’ís] and depressed the armies of darkness! He sent
> His angels to all directions, with a call of the trumpet
> of realities and meanings, instructions and teachings!

> Therefore, O people of the earth, appreciate the
> opportunity, in this new century, wherein the lights
> have been revealed by the Glorious Lord!”186

Note here the profound Zoroastrian motifs of Light and
Darkness, and the association of the faithful, namely Bahá’ís,
with angelic beings and the army of light. It is these faithful
who are created from the “earth of Light,” namely the earth of
Baha’, and whose being is the ontological co-incidence of their
outer (zahir) and inner (batin) being. This spiritual creation, at
once new and primordial, are the creatures of light foretold in
the Mazdean scriptures, as Corbin sums up a portion of Yasht
19, “the creatures who are to come from the world of light and,
in the form of Saoshyants, renew earthly existence, making it an
existence with the nature of Fire, when all creatures will possess
an incorruptible body of luminous Fire.”187 It is they who are
referred to in the verse by Bahá’u’lláh, “Some know Us and bear
witness, while the majority bear witness, yet know Us not” [TB
13]. This gnosis (‘irfán) of Baha is what distinguishes the faithful
of love, the people of Baha, from the rest who bear witness
outwardly, yet inwardly do not know, for they lack the gnostic
vision bestowed by the “eyes of fire”. Thus it is they who are
created from the radiance of the supernal Light, and from “the
form of Fire made visible” on the plain of history, namely
Bahá’u’lláh, the divine Light of Glory, the embodiment of the
Mazdean Fire and of Khvarnah. In the spiritual hermeneutics of
the Bahá’í textual universe, these beings of light as Saoshyants,
then become symbolized as the people of Baha’, who along with
the savior Saoshyant (i.e., Bahá’u’lláh), will bring about the
spiritual transfiguration and renovation of the cosmos, the
making-brilliant or wonderful of creation (frashegird), which
may be symbolically identified with the Order of Bahá’u’lláh
(nazm-i Baha) and his Wondrous New Order (nazm-i Badi’).

Thus as we have seen throughout this study, the mystico-
messianic hermeneutics of Bahá’u’lláh find their correspondence
and analogue in the conceptual coordinates of the celestial Fire
(atar, adar, atash) in Mazdean scriptures, from the Gathas to the
Palavi texts. The Mazdean heavenly Fire is not only equated
with Truth/Order (asha), but forms with it a syzygy or
dualitude, a bi-unity; and who is therefore represented in the

Zoroastrian mytho-logic as a ‘person,’ a ‘being,’ albeit a meta-
physical and meta-temporal being, who is at once the cause of
the existentiation of the cosmos, and who will become
“embodied” or made resplendent in the world as a ‘person,’ and
who is expected to appear at “the end of the millennium” as the
Saoshyant, to make brilliant (frashegird) and radiant all of
creation, precisely through the light and luminosity of his divine
and primordial Fire — a Fire which is intimately and
simultaneously connected to the sublime concept of Khvarnah
or the divine Light of Glory, the Victorial Fire, and with the
person and name of Baha’ (Allah).

> Theologie–Gesellschaftsbezug (Stuttgart: Kohlhammer Verlag, 2009) 119.

> influenced by Manichaeism early on.
> The term often used for Manicheans in Arabic sources is al-Zindiq’ or

> Bahá’u’lláh, Abdu’l-Bahá and Shoghi Effendi during their lives, it would be
> curious that no one would have asked about Manicheaism and its founder
> Mani. However, in an early anti-Bahá’i polemic one of the charges
> brought against Bahá’u’lláh was that his religion bore a close resemblence
> to that of Mani’s. In Mirza Abu’l Fazl’s monumental apology called al-

\[81\] This philosophical narrative will not be developed here, as a separate study

\[82\] Another hermeneutical register in this passage is the motif of the “heat of
> the love of God.” Bahá’u’lláh similarly writes regarding the Prophet
> Zarathustra/Zoroaster: “O Bahram! Thou didst ask concerning His
> Holiness Zoroaster. Indeed, He came from the presence of God, and He
> was responsible for the guidance of the people. The fire of love is set
> ablaze by His hand through the Fire of Divine Love, and His Book came
> [down] bearing Divine Commandments and Ordinances...” Provisional
> translation from Bahá’u’lláh, Yarani Parsi, 54. Bahá’u’lláh is stating that
> this primal fire of divine love has again appeared in the world through his
> manifestation “with a new radiance and with immeasurable heat.” Here
> Bahá’u’lláh’s spiritual hermeneutics (ta’wil) of Zoroaster as the purveyor
> of the fire of love through the fire of divine love, has a long heritage in
> Persian classical poetry and the so-called ‘Religion of Love’ (mazhab-e
> ‘ishq). Henry Corbin writes, “This religion of love was and remained the
> religion of all the minstrels of Iran and inspired them with the magnificent
> ta’wil [spiritual hermeneutics] which supplies a link between the spiritual
> Iran of the Sufis and Zoroastrian Iran, for according to this ta’wil the
> Prophet of Islam in person proclaims Zarathustra to be the prophet of the
> Lord of love; the altar of Fire becomes the symbol of the Living Flame in
