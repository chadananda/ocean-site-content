            The Language of the Heart:
Parallels between Chinese and
Baha'i Approaches to the Spiritual Self

Sim Tze Hong

INTRODUCTION

The Chinese use the language of the heart to describe things relating to
human nature. For example, "open heart" means happy, "close heart"
means concern, and "use heart" means to concentrate. The Chinese use
the heart to "think" and to express feelings.

Both Chinese and BaháT teachings recognise the nobility of a human
spirit that is created to reflect divine attributes. The "heart" is the part of
human nature bestowed by the creator to be pure, kind and radiant. Man
needs to go through the process of transformation and development. The
teachings of the Manifestations of God1 and saints raise human
consciousness about the spiritual self. When a man follows the teachings
of the Manifestation of God, he is enlightened and gains true knowledge
about the spiritual self. An enlightened man has unity within him, is
motivated to serve, and brings unity among people. When a man lives his
life with pure and goodly deeds, he contributes to the advancement of
civilization.

The Chinese recognise the true self as a man having a divine mandate
rather than a man having a covenant with God as in other religions. As
cultures interact, it becomes more important to find the common ground
between them. This paper focuses on the parallels between the Chinese,
especially Confucian teachings, and the BaháT teachings about the

\[1\] "Manifestation of God" is terminology used in the Baha'i Faith for a Divine Teacher or
Prophet. The concept is like God being the Sun and the Manifestations of God being the
mirrors, who perfectly reflect the attributes of God.

spiritual self. The discussion of this paper talks about the nature of the
heart, the pathway to perfection, and the knowledge of oneself.

THE NATURE OF THE HEART

Chinese traditions and Baha'i teachings have profound and similar
concepts about the nature of the heart. The Chinese concept of the heart
refers to human nature that is created Cheng; Ren and Ming. The Baha'i
concept of the heart refers to human nature that is created "pure, kindly
and radiant." Cheng is similar to "pure," Ren is similar to "kindly" and
Ming is similar to "radiant."

The Chinese Concept of the Heart

A Heart that is Cheng
Cheng can mean a heart that is pure, sincere and truthful. In the
Confucian classic, The Doctrine of the Mean, it says: "What Tian
(Heaven) has conferred is called the Nature"2 and "Cheng is the Way of
Tian, to be Cheng is the way of men."3 Tian is the Creator/ The Chinese
knowledge of Tian includes the fear of Gui Sheng (ghost and God).
Confucius says that Gui Sheng cannot be seen or heard, yet they manifest
in all things and "all things cannot exist without them." They cause the
people of the world to worship them. Confucius says: "The arrival of
Sheng is unpredictable, how can one's heart be unpure? Its essence is
mysterious, but it manifests everywhere. So manifest, so Cheng (truthful)
that it cannot be veiled."5

Human beings understand Tian by being Cheng. Cheng is the foundation
for all relationships. In The Doctrine of the Mean, it mentions that the
pre-requisite for a man to be trusted by the ruler is to be trusted by his
friends. The pre-requisite to be trusted by a friend is to be trusted by
parents. The pre-requisite to be trusted by parents is to be Cheng, to be

\[2\] The Four Books, The Doctrine of the Mean. p. 24.

The Chinese concept of Tian is the Creator of all things. Tian is lower than Dao. Dao
is the essence and the power of existence and is unknowable. Dao is similar to the Baha'i
concept of God and Tian is similar to one of the Names of God- Creator.
The Four Books, The Doctrine of the Mean, p. 36.

sincere in one's act. In order to be Cheng, one needs to know what is
Shang (the Supreme Good). Without knowing Shang, it is impossible to
be Cheng6 Since "Cheng is the Way of Tian," to know Shang is to know
Tian. Since "to be Cheng is the way of man" and "what Tian has
conferred is called the Nature," to know Tian is human nature and to
follow the way of Tian becomes the first duty of man.

The Doctrine of the Mean describes the process to be Cheng and to
know. Firstly, through human nature, it says: "to be Ming (to know) by
being Cheng is called nature (human)." Secondly, through education, it
says: "to be Cheng through knowing is called Jiao (education)."7 The
concept of Jiao or education is defined as follows:

"What Tian has conferred is called Nature, to follow Nature is called
Dao8 (the Way), Siu Dao is called Jiao (to learn and to live by Dao is
called education)."9

The Chinese word Jiao means both religion and education. From the
above definition, religion and education are not separated from each
other. To live by Dao needs Cheng or truthfulness. Confucius says,
"Dao cannot be left for an instant. If it could be left, it would not be
Dao. Therefore a Jun Zi (superior man) is cautious when he is not
watched, fearful (fear Dao) when he is not heard (in privacy). There is
nothing that is most hidden and most minute that does not manifest." 10
The relationship between a man and Dao is like a fish and the ocean. The
fish may not be aware of the sea and may not see the sea. Nevertheless,
the fish is dependent on the sea and cannot leave it. Confucius points out
the need to apply truthfulness in society. He says if he were to rule, he
would ensure that abuses of the legal system do not arise. People would
fear the righteousness of the rulers. If people do not have sufficient
grounds for their case, they would feel shameful and not take their
disputes to court. This is called "knowing the root," and "knowing the

root is called the perfection of knowledge."11 This is the concept of
Cheng and its application.

Referring to Cheng, Mengcius says: "A great man is he who does not
lose his childhood heart"(maintaining a pure heart).12 The level of purity
or Cheng that man can achieve varies. Only a saint can achieve the level
of perfect Cheng. In The Doctrine of the Mean, it says:

"Only the perfect Cheng of the world can adjust the great invariable
relations of mankind, establish the great fundamental virtues of
humanity, and know the transforming and nurturing operation of Heaven
and Earth. What enables him to do so? It is because his Cheng has
reached the stage of Ren, his knowledge is perfect and profound, just as
the sky that is vast and has no limit."13

In another passage from the same book, it reads:

"Only the perfect Cheng of the world can perfectly develop his nature.
Able to perfectly develop his own nature he can develop others' nature.
Able to develop others' nature he can develop the nature of all things.
Able to develop the nature of all things he can assist the transforming
and nurturing power of Heaven and Earth. Able to assist the
transforming and nurturing power of Heaven and Earth he can stand
parallel to Heaven and Earth"14

An ordinary man cannot be compared to a saint who is able to "perfectly
develop his nature." Nevertheless, Confucius says that a man can strive
to be Cheng by "choosing Shang (Supreme Good) and firmly holding to
it," "studying it extensively," "inquiring into it thoroughly,"
"differentiating it clearly," and "practicing it earnestly."15 Confucius
continues that an ordinary man is "second" to the saint (and cannot know
everything), so he should focus on investigating the reality of certain
fields of study.16 In another passage, Confucius says:

"Cheng, is the act to perfect one's own nature. Dao (the Divine Way), is
the way to perfect one's own way. Cheng is the beginning and the end of
all things...Cheng perfects not only oneself, but it also perfects all
things. Perfecting oneself is being Ren (benevolence); perfecting all
things is knowledge. All these are the virtues of (human) nature, the
unity of the inward and outward Dao"11

In sum, Cheng perfects a man inwardly, and perfects all things
outwardly. Since Ren is the outcome of being Cheng, it is necessary to
elaborate the Confucian concept of Ren.

A Heart that is Ren
Ren can mean a heart that is benevolent and kind, or a heart that fully
expresses human nature. It is the perfection of Cheng. Mengcius says:
"Ren is the human heart; Yi (justice) is the human path."18 In another
passage, he says, "Ren is the distinguishing characteristic of man. As
embodied in man's conduct, it is called Dao (the Way)."19 That means a
man having the quality of Ren is in harmony with the heavenly way.
Mengcius says that Ren is the "little difference" that distinguishes a
human being from an animal."20 Confucius elaborates Ren in many
ways. Kong Jiang (the 72th descendent of Confucius) says that Ren is the
way men "know each other, love each other and associate with each
other."21 From this perspective, it is easier to understand Ren in the ways
a man exercises his powers to know, to love, and to will.

Ren and Knowing
At the level of knowing, to be Ren is to recognise the nobility of oneself.
Mengcius says the business of a Jun Zi (superior man) is to have "noble
aims." To have "noble aims" is to "practice Ren and Yi." To kill an
innocent man is "not Ren," to take things not belonging to oneself is "not
Yi." The intention and action of a man should be guided by these
principles. Mengcius says: "intention is based on Ren and action is based
on Yi. Then the business of a great man is completed."22 Zhengcius says

that a Si (scholar) has a "heavy responsibility " and a "long way." To set
Ren as a personal responsibility is "heavy" and to stop only at death is
"long." Thus a Si has to persevere and be steadfast.23

Regarding the ways to be Ren, Zi Xia says if one "learns intensively,
fixes his aim, inquires earnestly, and reflects over current matters, then
he encompasses Ren."24 Learning needs discipline and requires one to
make the right choice. Confucius says "to discipline oneself and to
observe Li (propriety) is Ren," to do so, one "sees not contrary to Li,
listens not contrary to Li, speaks not contrary to Li, acts not contrary to
Li"25 Ren begins with oneself. Confucius says "if the aim is fixed upon
Ren, there will be no practice of wickedness." He says that a man with
Ren is "able to like men (the righteous) and to hate men (the wicked)."26

Ren and Loving
At the level of loving, to practice Ren is to avoid conflict, to create
harmony and unity. Confucius suggests the golden rule can avoid
conflict, he says: "not to do to others as you would not wish done to
yourself. To have no murmuring against you in your country, and none
in the family." 27 Mengcius suggests an active way to create harmony
and unity, he says: "All men have some things that they cannot bear,
extend that feeling to what they can bear, then it is Ren. All men have
some things that they will not do, extend that feeling to what they will
do, then it is Yi (justice)."28 What a man can rightfully bear and will
rightfully do should be in line with Ren and Yi. Mengcius explains with
the following example:

"All men have a heart that cannot bear the suffering of others... If a man
suddenly sees a child who is about to fall into a well, he will be alarmed
and have sympathy. Such a feeling does not come from the intention to
befriend the child's parents, nor from the intention to be praised by

neighbours, nor from trying to avoid the irritating noise of the crying
child."29

Mengcius says a man should possess a few kinds of heart, he states:

"A man without a sympathetic heart is not a man; without a heart of
shame he is not a man; without a heart of modesty and complaisance
(gentleness, willingness to please others) he is not a man; without a heart
to differentiate between good and evil he is not a man. A sympathetic
heart is the beginning of Ren (benevolence), a heart of shame is the
beginning of Yi (justice), a heart of modesty and complaisance is the
beginning of Li (propriety), and a heart to differentiate good and evil is
the beginning of Zi (wisdom). All men have these four beginnings
(inherited qualities), just as they have four limbs."30

A man needs to develop his four limbs so that he can grow and remain
active physically. Similarly, a man needs to develop his "four
beginnings" of Ren, Yi, Li, Zi so that he can grow and remain active
morally and spiritually. Ren creates a society that is caring and forgiving.
Yi creates a society that is truthful and righteous. Li creates an orderly
and courteous society. Zi creates a society free from unseemly
influences. The result is harmony and unity in society, which leads to a
morally and spiritually advanced civilization..

Ren and Willing
At the level of willing, a man begins the practice of Ren with his family.
Mengcius says: "The essence of Ren (benevolence) is service to one's
parents. The essence of Yi (justice) is obedience to one's elder brother.
The essence of knowledge is to understand both {Ren and Yi) and
persevere in them. The essence of Li (propriety) is to regulate and to
refine both. The essence of Yue (music; happiness) is to rejoice from
having both."31 At the social level, a man reflects his quality of Ren
through associating with others. Confucius says:

\[29\] Ibid, p. 320.

\[30\] Ibid.

\[31\] Ibid, p. 406.
76            THE SINGAPORE BAHA' I STUDIES REVIEW

"Establish for others as you wish to be established yourself, achieve for
others as you wish to be achieved yourself. To take a matter around you
as an example and extend it to others is the method of practicing Ren. "32

Therefore, action is most important because it is the tangible product of
one's nature and the result of one's will. In human relationships and
actions, Mengcius points out that a great difference exists between "not
being able" and "not being willing." "Not being able" refers to things
beyond a man's capacity. "Not being willing" refers to things within a
man's capacity but things a man refuses to do. However, men always use
the reason of "not being able" as an excuse to refuse things that they
should do but are not willing to do. Mengcius explains with the
following example. If a man was asked to carry a mountain or jump
across the ocean, he can refuse, and say that he is not able to do so
because it is beyond his capacity. However, if a strong man is asked to
make a walking stick out of a branch for an elderly man, he should not
refuse by giving the excuse that he is not able to do so, because in this
case, the request lies within his capacity to accomplish the task. 33
Besides, to be kind and helpful to the elderly is a social responsibility.
Man needs goodwill in all human relationships and to have an attitude of
service to others. A human heart with Ren will naturally associate with
others in a spirit of good will. A heart that is Cheng and Ren will be
Ming.

A Heart that is Ming
Ming means radiant. A person with truthful words and deeds is like the
sun that is radiant and cannot be veiled. In The Doctrine of the Mean, it
mentions the process and outcomes of being Cheng. It says: "Being
Cheng becomes apparent. Being apparent becomes manifest. Being
manifest becomes Ming (radiant). Being Ming moves (others' hearts).
Being moved, things (old habits and bad customs) are changed. Being
changed, things (society) are transformed."34 In other words, if a heart is
truthful, a man's words and deeds will be truthful and manifest. His
words and deeds exert influence on others and can transform society. He
will be like a lamp that provides guidance to others. The degree that a

The Language of the Heart                    77

heart is Ming is in proportion to his degree of Cheng and the services a
man is willing to perform.

In sum, the Chinese concept of human nature is based on Cheng, Ren
and Ming. Human nature is bestowed by Heaven, created to be pure,
sincere and truthful. A pure heart knows Heaven; it perfects oneself
inwardly, and perfects others outwardly. Man is also created to be kind,
truth-seeking and noble. Man has the duty to create unity and harmony in
society. A man who has these qualities will be spiritually radiant and
contributes to the advancement of society.

The BaháT Concept of the Heart

The BaháT concept of the heart is similar to the Chinese one. In The
Hidden Words, Baha'uTlah, the prophet founder of the BaháT Faith
mentions that man is "created" by God to be "rich" and "noble" and
should not seek "enlightenment" from anyone besides God.35 He says
that all things "in heaven and earth" have been "ordained" for men
"except the human heart," which God has "made the habitation" of His
"beauty and glory."36 Man has no ownership of the heart. Man is the
trustee of the heart and has the obligation to care for the heart. By doing
so, a man can fulfil in his life, God's trust. Referring to the heart,
Baha'uTlah says:

"My first counsel is this: Possess a pure, kindly and radiant heart, that
thine may be a sovereignity ancient, imperishable and everlasting."

A "pure, kindly and radiant heart" is the spiritual basis of human nature
and is the pre-requisite for all human development.

A Pure Heart
A pure heart is similar to the Confucian concept of Cheng - pure, truthful
and able to recognise Shang (the Supreme Good). Mengcius says that a
great man has a "childhood heart." Similarly 'Abdu'1-Bahá, the son of
Baha'uTlah once held a child close to him and said that "the true Baha'i

\[35\] Baha'u'llah, The Hidden Words, 1:13, p. 8.

\[36\] Ibid, 2:27, p. 32.

\[37\] Ibid, 1:1, p. 5.
78             THE SINGAPORE BAHÁ' Í STUDIES REVIEW

loves children, because Jesus says they are of the Kingdom of heaven. A
simple pure heart is near to God; a child has no worldly ambitions."38 In
another passage, 'Abdu'1-Bahá says: "Whosoever has a pure heart and
renders good deeds is nearer to God and the object of His favor."39 Purity
and truthfulness are inseparable. Just as the Chinese say that to be Cheng
is to recognise Shang, to have a pure heart is to recognise God and to be
"near to God." To have a truthful heart is to obey God and to "render
good deeds."

When one observes the sun, he will notice that to give light is the
characteristic and the necessity of the sun. Similarly, the nature of a
mirror has the characteristic and the necessity to reflect light. 'Abdu'l-
Bahá says that a "pure heart" becomes the "mirror of the beauty of
truth" to "manifest" (divine) "Light." 'Abdu'1-Bahá exalts "purity from
every defeat" as "the first perfection" for a man. He adds: "In all
...actions and conduct there must first be purity."40 A man with a pure
heart manifests his perfect nature, like a spotless mirror, he reflects
perfectly the light of God. This is similar to the Chinese saying that to
know by being Cheng is called "nature" (human).

A man gains true knowledge by reflecting the knowledge of God. The
Chinese say that "to be Cheng through knowing is called education" and
education is to live by the way of Dao. Similarly, Bahá'is recognise that
following the teachings of the Manifestation of God is the beginning of
all learning. Baha'u'llah says: "The source of all learning is the
knowledge of God, ... and this cannot be attained save through the
knowledge of His divine Manifestation."41 The "perfect Cheng of the
world" who knows the "operation of Heaven and Earth" mentioned by
the Chinese can be compared to the Manifestation of God. The Chinese
recognise the supreme "Good" through their Saints and Bahá'is
recognise God through the Manifestation of God. Throughout the history
of China, there has not been a figure commonly known as a "prophet"
who establishes a religion as in other major world religions. The Chinese
recognition of the "Good" is a profound act of self knowledge and an
awareness of a divine mandate. The Baha'i recognition of God is a

covenant and an act of obedience to the Teachings of their prophet
founders.

In the Kitab'i-Aqdas-tht Most Holy Book Baha'uTlah says the
recognition of the Manifestation of God is "the first duty prescribed by
God for His servants." He adds: "Whoso achieveth this duty hath
attained unto all good; and whoso is deprived thereof hath gone astray,
though he be the author of every righteous deed."42 'Abdu'1-Bahá
explains that "actions alone are not sufficient; they are a body of the
greatest loveliness, but without spirit." He adds: "that which is the cause
of everlasting life, eternal honor, universal enlightenment, real salvation
and prosperity is, first of all, the knowledge of God."43 This is similar to
the Confucian concept of Cheng being the foundation of all
relationships. Without knowing the "Supreme Good," it is impossible to
be Cheng; without Cheng, it is impossible to be trusted by others.

The recognition of God is coupled with the love of God. When man
loves God and lives in God, man can receive love from God. This is a
reciprocal process. Referring to this relationship, Baha'uTlah says:
"Love Me that I may love thee. If thou loveth Me not, My love can in no
wise reach thee."44 A fish leaving the ocean cannot enjoy the bounty of
the ocean. 'AbduT-Bahá further explains: "the love of God enables man
to purify his innermost heart.45 Love has to be coupled with obedience.
Baha'uTlah says that whoso recognises God has reached a "most
sublime station" and has to observe "every ordinance" of God. These are
"twin duties" which are "inseparable" and "neither is acceptable without
the other."46 Observing the ordinances of God needs truthfulness.
Truthfulness, as 'Abdu'1-Bahá says, is "the foundation of all human
virtues." He added: "Without truthfulness progress and success, in all the
worlds of God, are impossible for any soul. When this holy attribute is
established in man, all the divine qualities will also be acquired." This
is similar to the Confucius saying that to be truthful is "knowing the
root."

80             THE SINGAPORE BAHÁ'Í STUDIES REVIEW

The knowledge of God motivates man to focus his attention on noble
spiritual goals in life, and not to be attached to material goals. Spiritual
goals are eternal, and material goals are transient. The spirit of man is
everlasting, and the body of man is mortal. Purification of the heart
develops the spirit of man. For this Baha'u'llah says: "Abandon not for
that which perisheth an everlasting dominion, and cast not away celestial
sovereignty for a worldly desire." 8 To have a pure heart, a man needs to
detach himself from all things except God. Baha'u'llah says:

"Blind thine eyes, that is, to all save My beauty; stop thine ears to all
save My word; empty thyself of all learning save the knowledge of Me;
that with a clear vision, a pure heart and an attentive ear thou mayest
enter the court of My holiness."49

To be detached from all things except God is similar to the condition
described in the Chinese saying of "firmly holding" to "Good, " to study
it extensively and to practise it earnestly.

In sum, the first duty for man is to recognise God. Purity of heart enables
a man to recognise God through the Manifestation of God. This
recognition is coupled with love, which in turn purifies one's heart. This
love is coupled to obedience. Recognizing God and observing God's
ordinances are twin duties that cannot be separated. Observing God's
ordinances needs truthfulness, and truthfulness is the foundation of all
human virtues. A pure heart is the spiritual basis of human nature and the
pre-requisite of all noble human conduct and action. In order to purify
his heart, a man needs to detach himself from all things except God.

A Kindly Heart
A kindly heart is similar to Ren. To be kind implies the need to associate
with others. It is also easier to understand a kindly heart from the way a
man exercises his powers to know, to love and to will. 'Abdu'1-Bahá
says that the difference between man and animal is their degrees of
consciousness. Referring to an animal, he says: "It has no consideration
or consciousness of good and evil. It simply follows its natural instinct
and inclination."50 While the Chinese practice Ren as an act of self-

\[48\] Baha'u'llah, The Hidden Words. 2:31, p.35.

\[49\] Ibid, 2:11, p. 26.
'Abdu'1-Bahá, The Promulgation of Universal Peace, p. 40.

consciousness, Baha'is practice kindness as an act of following the
teachings of the Prophets. 'Abdu'1-Bahá says:

" The Prophets of God have come to show man the way of righteousness
in order that he may not follow his own natural impulse but govern his
action by the light of Their precept and example. According to Their
teachings he should do that which is found to be praiseworthy by the
standard of reason and judgment of intellect, even though it be opposed
to his natural human inclination; and he should not do that which is
found to be unworthy by that same standard, even though it be in the
direction of his natural impulse and desire.51

From this perspective, to have a kindly heart, a man may need to act in
opposition to his "natural human inclination" and "natural impulse and
desire." A man is able to do so because he has "consciousness of good
and evil" and is able to reason by his intellect. To have a kindly heart
does not mean to do good action alone. 'AbduT-Bahá says that "good
action" alone, though "praiseworthy," is not enough. In order for a
righteous action to be "perfect and complete," three "virtues of
humanity" are needed, namely: the "knowledge of God", the "love of
God" and "goodwill".52 From this perspective, a kindly heart knows
through the "knowledge of God," loves through the "love of God," and
wills through "goodwill."

Knowledge of God
The knowledge of God, according to 'Abdu'1-Bahá, is "the cause of
spiritual progress and attraction, and through it the perception of truth,
the exaltation of humanity, divine civilization, lightness of morals and
illumination are obtained."53 The knowledge of God is the cause of
nobility of a man and the exaltation of humanity. Baha'u'llah says man
is created "noble." He uses the example of a phoenix to describe the need
of a man to transcend his body, to "burst" the bodily "cage asunder"54
and "on the wings" of his soul, to soar "to the realm of the infinite."5 A
phoenix soars high in the kingdom above and will not be content with

the earth below. Similarly, a man with noble aims seeks the exalted
knowledge of God, and will not be content with material knowledge of
the world.

Similar to the Chinese way of a Jun Zi who has "noble aims" and
observes Ren and Yi (justice), Baha'uTlah makes justice a requirement
for a man who wishes to win His confidence. He says: "The best beloved
of all things in My sight is Justice" and "justice is My gift to thee and the
sign of My loving-kindness." He adds that by justice, "thou shalt see
with thine own eyes and not through the eyes of others, and shalt know
of thine own knowledge and not through the knowledge of thy
neighbour."56 To see and to know by oneself means to independently
investigate truth. This echoes the saying of Zi Xia that if one "learns
intensively, fixes his aim, inquires earnestly, and reflects over current
matters, then he encompasses Ren."

Similar to the Confucian teaching on the way to observe Li (propriety),
Baha'uTlah says:

"Hear no evil, and see no evil, abase not thyself, neither sigh and weep.
Speak no evil, that thou mayest not hear it spoken unto thee." In
addition, one should always have his "heart unsullied," his "thoughts
pure," and his "nature sanctified."57

Baha'uTlah says one should know how to differentiate between good
and evil, to "treasure the companionship of the righteous and eschew all
fellowship with the ungodly." 8

Knowledge of God is truth. Through the knowledge of God, a man can
obtain "spiritual progress" and can contribute to the "exaltation of
humanity" and the advancement of "divine civilization."

Love of God
There are different degrees of love: love of self, love of friends, love of
God and love of human beings for one another. 'Abdu'1-Bahá explains
the differences between these bonds of love. He says that self-love "is a

\[56\] Ibid, 1:2, pp. 5-6.

\[57\] Baha'u'llah, The Hidden Words, 2:44, p. 37.

\[58\] Ibid, 2:3, p. 24.

strange trait and the means of the destruction of many important souls in
the world. If man be imbued with all good qualities but he be selfish, all
the other virtues will fade or pass away and eventually he will grow
worse."59 Love between friends is not true love, because it is "originated
by the accidental conditions of life," "subject to transmutation," "subject
to change," and is merely "fascination" and " acquaintanceship." The
love of God is the "real and great love," it purifies a man's heart and
enlightens his soul. 'Abdu'1-Bahá says:

"The spiritual love of God maketh man pure and holy and clotheth him
with the garment of virtue and purity... This love is not physical... it is
absolutely spiritual... The souls whose consciences are enlightened
through the light of the love of God, they are like unto shining lights and
resemble stars of holiness in the heaven of purity...The real and great
love is the love of God. That is holy above the imaginations and thoughts
of men."60

In addition, 'Abdu'1-Bahá says that the love of God, is "the fruit of
human existence," "the spirit of life, and the eternal bounty" and the
"greatest power in the human world." Without the love of God, "the
contingent world would be in darkness... the hearts of men would be
dead, and deprived of the sensations of existence; ... spiritual union
would be lost... the light of unity would not illuminate humanity."61
The love of human beings for one another is similar to Ren. This is
universal love. Mengcius says that to be Ren is to extend what one "can
bear" and "will do" to others, according to Ren (benevolence) and Yi
(justice). Similarly, Baha'i teachings encourage people to have a kindly
heart towards others. However, very few can achieve this, since
profound self-knowledge is needed. From the Baha'i point of view, the
love of man for man has a spiritual foundation and is only possible
through the love of God. 'Abdu'1-Bahá says the love of man for man is
"prompted by the ideal of the unity of spirits." He says:

"This love (love of man for man) is attained through the knowledge of
God, so that men see the Divine Love reflected in the heart. Each sees in
the other the Beauty of God reflected in the soul, and finding this point

61   'Abdu'1-Bahá, Some Answered Questions, p. 301.

of similarity, they are attracted to one another in love... This love will
bring the realization of true accord, the foundation of real unity." 6'

The love of God therefore is the foundation of all human love. The love
of God motivates a man to transcend his self love and his love for his
friends, and enables him to have true love for others, to have universal
love.

The tangible action of loving God is to love man. Similar to the golden
rule of Confucius not to do to others as you would not wish done to
yourself, Baha'u'llah says: "Ascribe not to any soul that which thou
wouldst not have ascribed to thee, and say not that which thou doest
not."63 In addition, He says: "Magnify not the faults of others that thine
own faults may not appear great; and wish not the abasement of anyone,
that thine own abasement be not exposed." M To avoid conflict and the
abasement of man, Baha'u'llah prohibits backbiting and idle talk. He
says:

"The tongue is for mentioning what is good, defile it not with unseemly
talk... everyone should utter that which is meet and seemly, and should
refrain from slander, abuse and whatever causeth sadness in men."65

Avoiding conflict by disciplining the tongue is not enough. A man needs
to actively carry forward deeds of kindliness, to create unity and
harmony. 'Abdu'1-Bahásays:

"Knowledge is not enough; we hope by the Love of God we shall put it
into practice. We know that to help the poor and to be merciful is good
and pleases God, but knowledge alone does not feed the starving man,
nor can the poor be warmed by knowledge or words in the bitter winter;
we must give the practical help of Loving-kindness."66

Similar to the saying of Mengcius that a man has a "sympathetic heart"
and should extend this feeling to "what a man can bear," Baha'u'llah

says: "Bestow My wealth upon My poor, that in heaven thou mayest
draw from stores of unfading splendor and treasures of imperishable
glory." 7 While to care for the needy and to be generous is praiseworthy,
to offer up one's soul is more pleasing to God. BaháVlláh says: "To
offer up thy soul is a more glorious thing couldst thou but see with Mine

eye.
Goodwill
Goodwill is the third virtue of humanity. 'Abdu'1-Bahá defines goodwill
as "absolute light" and the "basis of good actions." He says that goodwill
is "purified and sanctified from the impurities of selfishness, of enmity,
of deception." He explains goodwill with the following example:

"Now it may be that a man performs an action which in appearance is
righteous, but which is dictated by covetousness. For example, a butcher
rears a sheep and protects it; but this righteous action of the butcher is
dictated by desire to derive profit, and the result of this care is the
slaughter of the poor sheep. How many righteous actions are dictated by
covetousness! But goodwill is sanctified from such impurities."69

Mengcius says: "the essence of Ren is service to one's parents."
Similarly, Baha'is regard services to one's parents as "sacred duties."
'Abdu'1-Bahá says: "The (children's) prosperity in this world and the
Kingdom depends upon the good pleasure of parents, and without this
they will be in manifest loss." 70 Goodwill begins from one's family. To
extend it is to practice goodwill towards others. In this regard,
Baha'uTlah says: "no man should enter the house of his friend save at
his friend's pleasure, nor lay hands upon his treasures nor prefer his own
will to his friend's, and in no wise seek an advantage over him."77 In
another passage, He says that one should "show forbearance and
benevolence and love to one another," converse with a person with "a
spirit of extreme kindliness and goodwill" to help him "see and
recognize the truth," without esteeming oneself to be superior to others.

86              THE SINGAPORE BAHA’I STUDIES REVIEW

Similar to the Confucian teaching of treating others as one would want to
be treated, Bahá’u’lláh says: “He should not wish for others that which
he does not wish for himself, nor promise that which he does not
fulfil.” 73

Goodwill prevents enmity and hatred. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá says: “We should
manifest the spirit of justness and goodwill toward each other.” If we do
otherwise, such as “cerisure and pronounce anathema, praising ourselves
and condemning all others,” then “nothing but enmity and hatred,
injustice and inhumanity can possibly result.” 74 The Bahá’í standard of
exercising goodwill can be seen in the following passage of ‘Abdu’l-
Bahá:

“Should other peoples and nations be unfaithful to you show your
fidelity unto them, should they be unjust toward you show justice
towards them, should they keep aloof from you attract them to yourself,
should they show their enmity be friendly towards them, should they
poison your lives sweeten their souls, should they inflict a wound upon
you be a salve to their sores. Such are the attributes of the sincere!
Such are the attributes of the truthful.” 75

Goodwill not only prevents “enmity and hatred,” but it also brings unity.
If we consider enmity and hatred, injustice and inhumanity to be like
darkness in the world, justness and goodwill are like light in the world.
To eliminate darkness, light is needed. A man needs to utilize his
spiritual potential. Bahá’u’lláh says: “Were man to appreciate the
greatness of his station and the loftiness of his destiny he would manifest
naught save goodly character, pure deeds, and a seemly and praiseworthy
conduct. If the learned and wise men of goodwill were to impart
guidance unto the people, the whole earth would be regarded as one
country.” 76 In another passage, He says: “So powerful is the light of
unity that it can illuminate the whole earth.” 77 This metaphor of light can
further be illustrated by having a radiant heart.

77   Bahá'u'lláh, Gleanings from the Writings o f Bahá’u’lláh, p. 288.

A Radiant Heart
It is easier to understand a radiant heart with the metaphor of light in the
context of a “light of unity.” Man is like a lamp that potentially bears the
light of God. Bahá’u’lláh says:

“Thou art My lamp and My light is in thee. Get thou from it thy radiance
and seek none other than Me. For I have created thee rich and have
bountifully shed My favor upon thee.” 78

The lamp cannot be lit by itself and it needs the light of God. The
teaching of the new Manifestation of God lights the lamp of the heart.
Bahá’u’lláh says the coming of a new Manifestation of God represents
the “Godhead” of the age.79 Turning towards the Manifestation of God is
equivalent to turning towards the light of God, which provides the
guidance, vision and direction for man. When a man polishes the mirror
of his heart, he can reflect the light of God. Bahá’u’lláh says:

“My claim on thee is great, it cannot be forgotten. My grace to thee is
plenteous, it cannot be veiled. My love has made in thee its home, it
cannot be concealed. My light is manifest to thee, it cannot be
obscured.” 80

A man enlightened by the teaching of God will “manifest” the light of
his knowledge and wisdom. This light “cannot be obscured” and a man
will be radiant. This is similar to the Confucian saying that a pure heart
can understand all things, able to reflect outwardly and become radiant.

As already mentioned, the human heart belongs to God, it is the “home”
for the love of God and God has a “great claim” on man. It is man’s duty
to lay his life in the path of God. Service to God is service to humanity.
One way for a man to manifest God’s command is to live his life
according to divine teachings, to proclaim divine principles to the world.
To walk the path of God, a man needs to willingly accept tests and trials.
Bahá’u’lláh says: “My calamity is My providence, outwardly it is fire

78 Bahá’u’lláh,                 TheHidden Words. 1:11, p. 8.

80 Bahá’u’lláh, The Hidden Words, 1:20, p. 10.

and vengeance, but inwardly it is light and mercy. Hasten thereunto that
thou mayest become an eternal light and an immortal spirit."81

A man who lives as a shining lamp through his deeds can illuminate the
path for others with his light. A man who proclaims the Word of God is
as a brilliant star that provides guidance and direction to the people of
the world. When the light of God enlightens the people of the world,
unity is manifested, and the "light of unity" will "illuminate the whole
earth." This idea echoes the saying of Mengcius that a heart being
Cheng becomes manifest and it can move hearts and transform society.
Parallel to the Chinese saying that a heart that "fully develops its nature"
can "stand parallel to Heaven and Earth," Baha'uTlah says: "Make
mention of Me on My earth, that in My heaven I may remember thee,
thus shall Mine eyes and thine be solaced."82

In sum, both the Confucian and the BaháT concepts of the heart talk
about human nature being bestowed by the Creator and entrusted by the
Creator. The Human heart has the potential to be pure, kind and radiant.
It is man's duty to fulfil this divine trust and to optimize his potential
through words and deeds. If a man fully develops the potential of his
heart, a man will be worthy to return and to meet his Creator. A man
who develops his heart is on the pathway to perfection. This pathway
requires man to go through a process of transformation, to overcome
obstacles, to find the lost heart and to cultivate it.

PATHWAY TO PERFECTION

Obstacles to Human Transformation

Perhaps the chief obstacle to human transformation is self-love or self-
centeredness. Confucians consider a self-centered man as Xiao Ren and
an other-centered man as Jun Zi. Xiao Ren, which literally means small
man, is a man who loves the small self (to be self-centered) rather than
the big self (to be other-centered). A Jun Zi is righteous and a Xiao Ren
is just the opposite. These differences are described in the Confucian
classic, The Four Books. A Jun Zi is "harmonious but not partisan with

\[81\] Ibid, 1:50-51, p. 16.

\[82\] Ibid, 1:43, p. 15.

people;" a Xiao Ren is "partisan but not harmonious with people."83 A
Jun Zi "thinks of virtue" and "the sanctions of law;" a Xiao Ren "thinks
of comfort" and "favour."84 A Jun Zi is "conversant with Yi (justice); a
Xiao Ren is "conversant with gain."85 A Jun Zi is "satisfied and
composed;" a Xiao Ren is "always full of distress."86 A Jun Zi "enables
others to accomplish good things, but does not enable others to
accomplish bad things;" a Xiao Ren "does the opposite."87 A Jun Zi is
"affable, but not adulatory;" a Xiao Ren is "adulatory, but not affable."88
A Jun Zi "has a dignified ease without pride;" a Xiao Ren has pride
without a dignified ease."89 A Jun Zi "has (high) expectation in himself;"
a Xiao Ren "has (high) expectation in others." As a result of the
different personalities of a Jun Zi and a Xiao Ren, a Jun Zi "progresses
upwards" and a Xiao Ren "declines downwards."91

Xiao Ren therefore represents a man with low consciousness and who
fails to develop his potential. Jun Zi represents a man with high
consciousness and who is progressing towards perfection. A man can
never be totally freed from self and ego and from imperfection.
Confucian himself said that he was far from being a saint. Nevertheless,
a man should constantly strive to be a Jun Zi.

Baha'is consider the heart as "a divine trust." 'Abdu'1-Bahá says the
heart should be cleaned "from the stain of self-love" and should be
adorned "with the coronal of pure intent."92 As mentioned before, self-
love causes the destruction of a soul and selfishness causes all the virtues
in man to fade. 'Abdu'1-Bahá says that self-love is a trait within man
called the "natal self" or the "ego." It is the inner voice that tells oneself:
"I am a little better than the others," and "I am more important."93 Baha'i
teachings also recognise that a man can never be free from self and ego,

but he should strive to master the ego. Shoghi Effendi, the successor of
'Abdu'1-Bahá says:

"The only people who are truly free of the "dross of self are the
Prophets, for to be free of one's ego is a hall-mark of perfection. We
humans are never going to become perfect, for perfection belongs to a
realm we are not destined to enter. However, we must constantly mount
higher, seek to be more perfect. The ego is the animal in us, the heritage
of the flesh which is full of selfish desires. By obeying the laws of God,
seeking to live the life laid down in our teachings, and prayer and
struggle, we can subdue our egos. We call people "saints" who have
achieved the highest degree of mastery over their egos."94

Therefore, human transformation is a process of overcoming and
mastering the ego. This can be achieved through striving to obey the
laws of God in one's life. The pathway towards perfection is endless. In
the pathway, a man needs to search for the lost heart and to cultivate it.

Searching for the Lost Heart

According to Mengcius, it is important to learn extensively. He says:
"Learn extensively and discuss minutely what is learned; the object is to
go back and set forth in brief what is essential."95 He adds: "The way of
learning is none other than seeking the lost heart."
The lost heart refers to a man who is not conscious about Ren
(benevolence) and Yi (justice). Mengcius says:

"Ren is the heart of man; Yi is the path of man. Alas indeed, to abandon
the path (Yi) and not pursue it, to lose the heart and not know to seek for
it. When men's fowls and dogs are lost, they know to seek for them
again, but when they lose their hearts, they do not know to seek for
them."96

\[94\] Shoghi Effendi, Unfolding Destiny, p. 453.

The Four Book, The Works of Mengcius, p. 414.

\[96\] Ibid, p. 484.

To avoid losing the heart, a man needs to nourish his heart. The way to
nourish the heart, according to Mengcius, is to make "the desires few."
He says:

"As a man who makes the desires few, though the heart may be lost, but
rarely. As a man with many desires, though the heart may be kept, but
rarely."97

Men should be conscious about the divine mandate bestowed by Heaven.
Mengcius says:

"Heaven's plan to create mankind is this: that those who first apprehend
should instruct those who are slower to apprehend; those who are first to
be conscious should instruct those who are later to be conscious."98

Mengcius regards himself as one who is "first to be conscious" and has
the duty to instruct others. Mengcius is conscious about the ways of the
two Moral Kings, Yao and Shun. Yao and Shun practiced Dao (Divine
principles) and Yi (justice) during their ministries.
Confucius says that men are created with different degrees of
consciousness. He says:

"Those who are born with apprehension are the highest class of men.
Those who learn and apprehend are second; those who have difficulties
but they learn are the next class. As to those who have difficulties and
yet do not learn, they are the lowest of men."99

Confucius regards the recognition of Dao (the Divine Way) as the
ultimate goal of learning. He says: "Hearing (recognising) Dao in the
morning, one can die in the evening (without regrets).100 Similarly,
Baha'is regard the knowledge of God as "the source of all knowledge."
Referring to the ignorance of man, ' AbduT-Bahá says:

"Is it not astonishing that although man has been created for the
knowledge and love of God, for the virtues of the human world, for

\[97\] Ibid, p. 550.

\[98\] Ibid, p. 444.

\[99\] The Confucian Analects, p. 220.

\[100\] The Four Books, The Confucian Analects, p. 90.
92             THE SINGAPORE BAHAT STUDIES REVIEW

spirituality, heavenly illumination and life eternal, nevertheless he
continues ignorant and negligent of all this? Consider how he seeks
knowledge of everything except knowledge of God."101

'Abdu'1-Bahá continues with an example of God being the father and
man being the son and says:

"It is as if a kind and loving father had provided a library of wonderful
books for his son in order that he might be informed of the mysteries of
creation; at the same time surrounding him with every means of comfort
and enjoyment; but the son amuses himself with pebbles and playthings,
neglectful of all his father's gifts and provision."10

The knowledge of God encompasses Ren (benevolence) and Yi (justice)
mentioned by Mengcius. Mengcius says that making "the desires few" is
the way to prevent losing the heart. Similarly, the BaháT Faith
recognizes material attachment as the chief factor that leads man to be
ignorant of the knowledge of God. Shoghi Effendi says:

"Indeed the chief reason for the evils now rampant in society is the lack
of spirituality. The materialistic civilization of our age has so much
absorbed the energy and interest of mankind that people in general do no
longer feel the necessity of raising themselves above the forces and
conditions of their daily material existence."103

A man needs to transcend his material life. This does not mean to
abandon all material possessions. The Baha'i Faith recognizes wealth as
a means and not as an end in life. BaháVlláh says:

"Well is it then with him, who, being rich, is not hindered by his riches
from the eternal kingdom, nor deprived by them of imperishable
dominion... The splendor of such a wealthy man shall illuminate the
dwellers of heaven even as the sun enlightens the people of the earth!"104

\[101\] 'Abdu'1-Bahá, Foundation of World Unity, p. 64.

\[102\] Ibid.

\[103\] Shoghi Effendi, Directives from the Guardian, p. 86.

\[104\] BaháVlláh, The Hidden Words, 2:53, p. 41.

Instead of being attached to material life, a man should strive to excel in
all fields of learning. 'Abdu'1-Bahá says: "carry forward the various
branches of knowledge, be active and progressive in the field of
inventions and the arts. Endeavour to rectify the conduct of men, and
seek to excel the whole world in moral character."105 In this way, a man
not only preserves his heart, but he also develops his heart.

Cultivating the Heart

A man having found his heart can cultivate the growth of his heart. To
cultivate the heart, it is necessary to clear the blockage of the heart and
not violate the law of growth. In addition, a man needs to plant the seeds
of divine knowledge and wisdom.

Clearing the Blockage of the Heart
Mengcius encourages men to cultivate the heart constantly. He criticizes
the ignorance of men and says that men who plant trees "know to
nourish them." In the case of their own persons, men "do not know to
nourish them." The reason is not that people love their trees more than
their hearts, but it is because people fail to reflect about themselves.106 A
tree that has an outer form and shape is easy to perceive. The heart, an
inner faculty, can only be realized through reflection. In order to nourish
the heart, it is necessary to clear the path of the heart. Mengcius cites the
example of a path in the hill. He says: "A path in a hill, if constantly
being used, will become a road. If it is not being used, it will be blocked
by wild grass."107 As mentioned before, "heart" refers to human nature
being Ren (benevolent) and the "path" refers to Yi (justice). The "wild
grass" refers to desires that have to be kept "few."

Similarly, BaháTs use the metaphor of clearing the soil of the heart.
'Abdu'1-Bahá says that if seeds are sown in soil "full of useless plants,
weeds and rubbish," the seeds are "wasted." If seeds are sown in "pure,
sweet and fertile soil," they may "vegetate," become "fresh and verdant
and form into heaps of harvest." In the same passage, 'Abdu'1-Bahá
says:

\[105\] 'Abdu'1-Bahá, Baha í Education, Compilation, p. 21.

The Four Books, The Works of Mengcius, p. 484.

\[107\] Ibid, p. 544.

"If the health and well-being of the body be expended in the path of the
Kingdom, this is very acceptable and praiseworthy; and if it is expended
to the benefit of the human world in general ~ even though it be to their
material (or bodily) benefit and be a means of doing good - that is also
acceptable. But if the health and welfare of man be spent in sensual
desires, in a life on the animal plane, and in devilish pursuits - then
disease is better than such health; nay, death itself is preferable to such a
life."108

A soil full of "useless plants, weeds and rubbish" refers to "sensual
desires," living a life "on the animal plane," and "in devilish pursuits."
These attachments do not befit a man's true station and should be cleared
from the heart. In addition, Baha'uTlah warns men not to be beguiled by
the world but that they walk the way of righteousness and truth. He says:

"Take heed lest the world beguile you as it beguiled the people who went
before you! Observe ye the statutes and precepts of your Lord, and walk
ye in this Way which hath been laid out before you in righteousness and
truth. They who eschew iniquity and error, who adhere to virtue, are, in
the sight of the one true God, among the choicest of His creatures."109

Not Violating the Law of Growth
The process of cultivating the heart is similar to cultivating crops. Each
crop has its own pace of growth and men cannot violate this law of
nature. Men have to labour with patience during the process of growth.
Referring to this principle, Mengcius tells a story of a farmer who was
impatient to wait for the growth of his crops. Feeling frustrated with the
slow progress in his field, the farmer decided to labour in the field one
day and he pulled each stalk higher from the ground. He then returned
home to share the news that the stalks had grown double in height. His
son was curious about the news and went to the field to investigate the
next day. Not surprisingly, all the stalks died. Mengcius adds: "There are
few in the world, who do not 'help' their crops to grow... what they do is
not only of no benefit, but harmful."110

\[108\] 'Abdu'1-Bahá, Tablets of 'Abdu'1-Bahá, p. 207.

\[109\] Baha'u'llah, The Kitab-i-Aqdas. p. 45.
The Four Books, The Works of Mengcius, p. 312.

Nurturing a man's spiritual welfare is similar to nurturing the crops. The
difference between men is that each man is at a different stage of
development. In guiding a heedless soul to the knowledge of truth
'Abdu'1-Bahá says one should be patient and do it "little by little." One
should conduct himself with "absolute rectitude," treat the soul "with the
utmost kindness," and to exemplify with "divine instructions...good
qualities and behaviour patterns." By doing so, one will succeed in
awakening a "previously heedless individual," and will change his
"ignorance to knowledge of the truth."111

Planting the Seeds of Divine Knowledge and Wisdom
The metaphor of the heart being a "garden"112 with "pure soil" and the
"sacred city" is used by Baha'u'llah. In this "garden," a man should
"sow the seeds of divine wisdom and knowledge" in its "pure soil." It is
astonishing that Baha'u'llah repeats three times113 the above phrase with
almost identical words in The Hidden Words, a book that contains the
essence of His teachings. One of these phrases is:

"Sow the seeds of My divine wisdom in the pure soil of thy heart, and
water them with the water of certitude, that the hyacinths of My
knowledge and wisdom may spring up fresh and green in the sacred city
of thy heart."114

By repeating these phrases three times in The Hidden Words, it would
seem to indicate that the cultivation of the heart is the primary duty for
men. It is so fundamental, so difficult to sustain, so easy to forget that
Baha'u'llah has to remind us again and again. Cultivating the heart is a
slow process that needs patience. Before the "hyacinths" spring up, their
beauty and their potential are hidden within seeds. Referring back to The
Hidden Words, the seeds to be sown in the heart refers to the
"delightsome words," the "mystic holiness,"115 the "divine mystery" and
"divine utterance"116 revealed by Baha'u'llah in His station as a
Manifestation of God for mankind today. 'Abdu'1-Bahá says that God

has sown seeds in the "soil of existence" and has irrigated it through
"His spiritual bounties." This soil will surely bring forward "good plants
of divine gifts," leaves of "love and union," stems of the "teachings of
the True One and His supreme laws," and the "grain" of "heavenly
blessings which giveth life to the souls."117 In another passage, He says:
"Unless the seed is sown, the bounty and blessing will not be attained;
until the tree be planted, the fresh fruit will not be produced."118

It is not enough to sow divine seeds only in one's heart. A man has to
avoid sowing the seeds of doubt, suspicion and dissension in the minds
of other people and not lead them away from truth. Baha'u'llah warns
people not to become the cause of disunity. He says: "Fear ye God and
sow not the seeds of dissension amongst men."119 On the other hand, a
man should actively nourish the hearts of other people. 'Abdu'1-Bahá
says:

"Use thy utmost power to sow and cast those pure seeds, the divine
teachings, in the hearts which move and cheer by the fragrance of
God."12?

The revealed teachings of the Manifestation of "God contain divine
knowledge and wisdom. By turning towards such teachings, the heart
can reflect divine knowledge and wisdom. The outcome of cultivating
the heart is spiritual growth and development. Spiritual growth enables a
man to gain a true knowledge of himself.

KNOWLEDGE OF ONESELF

Knowledge of oneself is the precondition for all spiritual progress. This
comes from the knowledge of the Manifestation of God. A man needs to
know that the purpose of his creation is to bear spiritual fruits for
humanity. A man's true nature is his spirit, which is immortal.

Knowledge of the Manifestation of God

Throughout history, it is the Manifestations of God, saints and
philosophers who awaken human consciousness, and refresh hearts and
souls. Referring to the purpose of the Manifestations of God, 'Abdu'l-
Bahá says:

"The divine prophets have revealed and founded religion. They have laid
down certain laws and heavenly principles for the guidance of mankind.
They have taught and promulgated the knowledge of God, established
praiseworthy ethical ideals and inculcated the highest standards of
virtues in the human world."121

In another passage, 'AbduT-Bahá says that the fundamental principles of
the Religion of God are "morals and conduct, with the knowledge of
divine mysteries" and the "light of the virtues of the world of humanity"
is the result of "the love and knowledge of God."122

The Manifestation of God is the bridge that connects this world to the
world of God. The coming of a new Manifestation of God inspires the
people of the world, purifies old traditions and offers new lights of
guidance to the people of His time. Man needs to renew consciousness
individually and to renew civilization collectively. Baha'uTlah is the
latest Manifestation of God. Referring to the social principles of
Baha'uTlah, 'Abdu'1-Bahá says: "Without these teachings progress and
advancement for mankind are in no wise possible. Every community in
the world findeth in these Divine Teachings the realization of its highest
aspirations."123 Baha'uTlah states:

"Consider, how can he that faileth in the day of God's Revelation to
attain unto the grace of the "Divine Presence" and to recognize His
Manifestation, be justly called learned, though he may have spent aeons
in the pursuit of knowledge, and acquired all the limited and material
learning of men? It is surely evident that he can in no wise be regarded
as possessed of true knowledge. Whereas, the most unlettered of all men,
if he be honoured with this supreme distinction, he verily is accounted as

one of those divinely-learned men whose knowledge is of God; for such
a man hath attained the acme of knowledge, and hath reached the
furthermost summit of learning."124

In a statement of the Baha'i International Community, it says:

"The Baha'i teachings espouse the fundamental unity of mankind and the
need for this reality to be manifested through the actions and attitudes of
all peoples, based on a common spiritual commitment. On this basis,
Baha'is see it as a basic objective both individually and collectively to
carry forward an ever advancing civilization."125

As mentioned, the "basic objective" for a man is to "carry forward an
ever advancing civilization," and without the social principles of
Baha'uTlah, "progress and advancement for mankind are in no wise
possible." A man cannot perfect the knowledge of his true self if he does
not know his "basic objective." In addition, a man cannot achieve his
"basic objective" if he does not know the social principles of the latest
Manifestation of God—Baha'u'llah. Baha'u'llah says that the recognition
of Manifestations of God and obedience to their teachings are "twin
duties" that cannot be separated.126 To obey God is to serve God; to
serve God is to serve mankind. Man must perform services and to bear
spiritual fruits for humanity.

Man Must Bear Spiritual Fruits

Mengcius says: "He who has optimized his heart knows his nature.
Knowing his nature, he knows Tian (Heaven). Preserving one's heart,
nourishing one's nature, is the way to serve Tian. Short life or long life
should not cause a man any double mindedness. Cultivate character and
wait (for Heaven's command). This is the way to establish Ming
(destiny)."127 All men are born with a destiny. A man must fulfil his
destiny by optimizing his heart's capacity to serve Tian. To serve Tian is

to serve humanity with a heart that practices Ren (benevolence) and Yi
(justice).

A man is like a fruit tree in the garden of mankind. A man who occupies
himself fully with material pursuits and does not distinguish himself with
goodly deeds is like a tree that yields no fruit. A fruit tree that yields no
fruit is useless. The Chinese describe a useless man as a "moving-corpse
and walking-flesh." This is the most despised of all men. A man's value
in life is to bear fruits that benefit both himself and others. Using the
metaphor of a tree, Baha'uTlah says:

"The Prophets and Chosen Ones have all been commissioned by the One
True God... to nurture the trees of human existence with the living
waters of uprightness and understanding, that there may appear from
them that which God hath deposited within their inmost selves. As may
be readily observed, each tree yieldeth a certain fruit, and a barren tree is
but fit for fire. The purpose of these Educators, in all they said and
taught, was to preserve man's exalted station... The fruits that best befit
the tree of human life are trustworthiness and godliness, truthfulness and
sincerity; but greater than all, after recognition of the unity of God... is
regard for the rights that are due to one's parents."128

The fruits of "trustworthiness and godliness, truthfulness and sincerity"
are meant for service to humanity. Service to humanity begins from
serving one's parents, because the family is the foundation of society.
This echoes the Chinese saying already mentioned that "the pre-requisite
to be trusted by friends is to be trusted by parents" and "the essence of
Ren (benevolence) is service to one's parents."

•A man who serves humanity optimizes his heart's capacity. Referring

> back to the first counsel of Baha'uTlah, such a man will possess "a pure,
> kindly and radiant heart" and his heart will be "a sovereignty ancient,
> imperishable and everlasting." He will come to recognise the immortality
> of his heart and will be characterized by spiritual attributes.

Immortality of the Heart

The reality of a man is his heart. The heart can also be called the soul,
and the soul is immortal. One way to understand the immortality of the
soul is through the attainment of spiritual attributes or virtues. Loacius
says that long life is not measured by how long a man lives. Long life is
measured by how long people remember a man's virtues and deeds. He
says: "Those who die but not perish (forgotten) have long life."129 The
immortality of the soul can be observed through its good effects.

Confucius says that man can observe the sign of the existence of God
through acts of worship offered by people of the world.130 Similarly, man
can observe the sign of the immortality of the soul through burial
ceremonies and ancestor worship. The recognition of the immortality of
the soul motivates a man to focus his attention beyond this transient
world of existence. Just as a baby in the womb needs to prepare for his
physical development for the world after birth, a man needs to prepare
for his spiritual development for the world after this life.

'Abdu'1-Bahá says: "Spiritual attributes are needed in the next world but
must be attained in this world." Spiritual attributes are the outcome of a
man who maximizes his heart's capacity. A spiritually enlightened man
gains his "virtues or perfection" through seven ways. According to
'Abdu'1-Bahá, these are: "knowledge of God," "love of God," "faith,"
"philanthropic deeds," "self sacrifice," "severance from this world,"
"sanctity and holiness." 'Abdu'1-Bahá added, "Unless he acquires these
forces and attains to these requirements he will surely be deprived of the
life that is eternal." On the other hand, if a man possesses "the
knowledge of God" and "the love of God," lives in "utmost state of
sanctity and holiness," and "becomes the cause of love among mankind,"
he shall surely attain to a "second birth" and enjoy "everlasting
existence."131

In another passage, 'Abdu'1-Bahá says: "The purpose of man's creation
is...unity and harmony."132 The knowledge of God enables a man to

know the source of his creation. The love of God motivates a man to
obey the teachings of God and to love mankind. When a man becomes
the cause of unity among men, he truly fulfils his heart's capacity and the
purpose of his creation.

CONCLUSION

Chinese culture and Baha'i teachings use the language of the heart to
describe human nature and spiritual reality. They both consider the heart
to be a divine trust and stress the need to optimize the potential of the
heart. The Chinese concept of the heart is human nature that is created to
be Cheng, Ren and Ming. The Baha'i concept of the heart is human
nature that is created to be "pure, kindly and radiant." They both say that
purity of heart is required to recognize God and that being pure is the
pre-requisite of all spiritual actions. They both say that the difference
between man and animal lies in a different degree of consciousness, and
that man has the capacity to know, to love, and to will. Man has the
capacity to know his nobility, to love others, to extend goodwill to others
and to create unity. The Chinese consider the way a man knows, loves
and wills to be founded on self knowledge. Baha'is consider the way a
man knows, loves and wills as the result of the knowledge of God, the
love of God and goodwill.

Both Chinese culture and Baha'i teachings talk about the golden rule of
treating others as one would wanted to be treated. They both talk about
an active way of extending help and being of service to others. In
addition, Baha'i teachings exalt the offering of one's soul in the path of
service, and describe it to be a "more glorious thing".

A man who optimizes the potential of his heart is radiant and he becomes
the light of guidance to others. He is on the pathway to perfection. Both
Chinese culture and Baha'i teachings talk about the need to overcome
the obstacles of self-centredness, to be detached from desires and
material possessions. They both emphasize the need to cultivate human
hearts with patience, and to nurture hearts with divine principles, divine
knowledge and wisdom.

The Chinese regard saints as those who have perfect Cheng and are able
to establish a code of morals and conduct. Baha'is regard the

102         THE SINGAPORE BAHÁ'Í STUDIES REVIEW

Manifestations of God as perfect souls who reveal divine laws and
principles for the guidance of man. They see the Manifestation of God as
the source of all knowledge, the source of human progress and the
advancement of civilization.

A man who recognizes the Manifestation of God gains true knowledge
of himself. Both Chinese culture and BaháT teachings recognise that the
objective of man is to provide service to humanity. They both say that
service to humanity begins with one's family. Through good words and
good deeds, a man obtains spiritual attributes. Both teachings recognise
the immortality of spiritual attributes and consider that the purpose of
man's creation is unity and harmony.
