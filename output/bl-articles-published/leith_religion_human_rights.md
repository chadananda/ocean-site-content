> In this chapter, John Barnabas Leith elaborates the clear theological foundations and commitment of the Bahá’í Faith to universal human-rights values. He draws on both the Bahá’í sacred writings and the practice of the Bahá’í International Community, a UN non-governmental organisation, in support of his position. Bahá’í sacred writings are centrally concerned with questions of good governance and judicial, social and economic justice. This is rooted, at least in part, in the concern that all individuals should be allowed to develop their qualities and capacities for their own good and the good of society as a whole. It is further developed, Leith argues, in the principle of the oneness of humankind which lies at the core of Bahá’í teachings. This has wide-ranging implications for societal justice, from the abandonment of prejudice to the embracing of diversity. Each and every human being, in Bahá’í perspective, is worthy of moral protection and the holder of inalienable human rights; each human being is a trust of the whole of humankind. These principles are explored further in relation to the freedom of all individuals to investigate reality for themselves, the freedom of religion and belief, human dignity, and in the development of a peaceful and united global civilisation. These principles are then examined in relation to a number of Bahá’í human rights activities – particularly the defence of the human rights of the Bahá’ís in Iran.

A More Constructive Encounter: A Bahá’í
View of Religion and Human Rights

John Barnabas Leith

The rise of human rights as a system of values and ethics commanding
respect and motivating action with quasi-religious force was a notable
feature of the twentieth century, which was also a time of increasing
secularisation and ‘privatisation’ of religion. The tension between human
rights values and religious values has led some to wonder if religion and
human rights are compatible. This tension has been reinforced by the
emergence in the late twentieth century and early twenty-first century
of an increasingly aggressive form of religious extremism which is clearly
contemptuous of human rights.

This chapter will explore the relationship between religion and human
rights from a Bahá’í perspective and will examine the work of the Bahá’í
community in wholeheartedly supporting the theory and practice of uni--
versal human rights.

introduction
Human rights discourse has a compelling quality at a time when reli--
gion no longer holds the centre of the public square. The value placed
on human rights and human rights as values seem to have a transcend--
ent quality that compels respect with, in some cases, a quasi-religious
force.

In this paper I want to give an example of a religion that has emerged
in modern times, which clearly and directly addresses modern concerns
and which is wholeheartedly committed to universal human rights. The
Bahá’í Faith, which has grown from its initial milieu in the Middle East
of the mid and late nineteenth century into a religion with a following
in all parts of the world, has very clear theological foundations for its
commitment to universal human rights and has long worked to promote

Ultimate Values in a New World Order’, ijms, 1/1 (1999), 3–20.

the values that underpin human rights. This paper will adduce evidence
from the Bahá’í sacred writings and other sources to demonstrate this
commitment and will examine work done by the Bahá’í International
Community (bic) in support of the human rights of the Bahá’ís in Iran
and of human rights more generally.

theological underpinnings
Bahá’u’lláh (1817–1892), founder of the Bahá’í Faith, ﬁrmly places religion
in the public sphere. In his extensive writings (which form a major part
of the Bahá’í scriptures) he addresses questions of good governance, of
judicial, social, and economic justice, of the environment, of the relation--
ship between science and religion, of social and familial relations, and,
importantly in the present context, of the relationship between the indi--
vidual and society. He envisages a future global society based on a deeply
rooted understanding of human oneness in which principles of justice
and equity are central to the form of government. This vision is expressed
epigrammatically in the emblematic quotation from Bahá’u’lláh’s writ--
ings: ‘The earth is but one country and mankind its citizens’.

There is a close relationship between Bahá’u’lláh’s political vision and
his teachings about the nature of the individual. Bahá’u’lláh holds that
every individual has qualities and capacities that must be released and
developed for the good of the individual and, indeed, for the good of
society as a whole. The job of government is, amongst other things, to
establish conditions under which these capacities can be developed and
put to use. This is a key point in understanding the Bahá’í position on
human rights.

Human beings are seen as being fundamentally spiritual in nature.

Much is said in the Bahá’í scriptures of the importance of developing
the intangible, but nonetheless eﬀective, qualities and capacities that are
deemed to be spiritual: the virtues, such as truthfulness, trustworthiness
and generosity; rationality and the enquiring mind; the capacity to know
and love God. Since these qualities and capacities are to be found in each
and every individual, and since, according to Bahá’u’lláh, God intends
these capacities to be developed, it follows that everyone has the right to
a life that will allow this development to take place.

The principle of the oneness of humankind is the core of Bahá’u’lláh’s
teachings and is seen as foundational to everything else Bahá’u’lláh
wanted his followers to accomplish in the public realm. As a result, the
oneness of humankind features centrally in Bahá’í statements and actions
on human rights.

The language of rights is to be found in the Bahá’í scriptures from a
relatively early date. Writing in the last quarter of the nineteenth century,
Bahá’u’lláh warned the rulers of the world: ‘They that perpetrate tyranny
in the world have usurped the rights of the peoples and kindreds of the
earth and are sedulously pursuing their selﬁsh inclinations.’ The fol--
lowing exhortation by Bahá’u’lláh to his followers does not use the word
‘rights’, but clearly foreshadows an important part of what the framers of
the Universal Declaration of Human Rights set out to achieve:

> Thou must show forth that which will ensure the peace and the
> well-being of the miserable and the down-trodden. Gird up the
> loins of thine endeavour, that perchance thou mayest release
> the captive from his chains, and enable him to attain unto true
> liberty.
> In addressing the requirements of just governance, Bahá’u’lláh again
uses language that human rights workers would recognise, although he
goes beyond the normal range of human rights discourse by calling on
the ruler (referring to all those with leading roles in government)

> to weigh his own being every day in the balance of equity and
> justice and then to judge between men and counsel them to do
> that which would direct their steps unto the path of wisdom and
> understanding. This is the cornerstone of statesmanship . . . From
> these words every enlightened man of wisdom will readily per--

> ceive that which will foster such aims as the welfare, security and
> protection of mankind and the safety of human lives.
> In addition to addressing human rights in general terms, Bahá’u’lláh
forbids speciﬁc abuses such as slavery and clearly enjoins practices such
as freedom of religion and the equality of women and men. He strongly
censures two great European powers for persecuting their Jewish popu--
lations, and in so doing approves, by implication, the principle of external
intervention into the aﬀairs of a sovereign state.

Similar rights and rights-related language is also to be found in the
writings of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, eldest son and successor of Bahá’u’lláh as head
of the Bahá’í community. For example, in 1912, while on a prolonged visit
to North America, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá spoke of a day when ‘there shall be an
equality of rights and prerogatives for all mankind’. In other talks and
writings he refers to the rights of labour, equal rights for women, and
indeed equal rights for all.

The concept of human rights is, therefore, not at all problematic for
the Bahá’í Faith. The values that underpin our modern understanding of
human rights are strongly advocated, and Bahá’u’lláh constantly exhorts
his readers to practise these values in their daily lives. He even goes so
far as to prescribe to those in government that they should daily examine
their consciences before presuming to advise or make judgements about
or between others.

As stated above, the core spiritual principle in the writings of
Bahá’u’lláh and ‘Abdu’l-Bahá is summed up in the phrase ‘the oneness
of humankind’. The Bahá’í account of human rights starts from and
expresses this principle. However, the focus on this principle would
seem to require some examination.

We may be inclined, in the early twenty-ﬁrst century, to regard the
notion that all human beings are part of one human race as too obvious
to be worthy of attention. That Bahá’ís and their institutions take this
as the foundation of their work may not be seen as particularly signiﬁ--
cant or radical. And yet throughout the years when Bahá’u’lláh, ‘Abdu’l-
Bahá and Shoghi Eﬀendi, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s successor as head of the Bahá’í

community, were working and writing, theories of racial superiority and
extreme forms of nationalism were rampant. Bahá’u’lláh’s commitment
to human oneness is without qualiﬁcation. He explicitly removes notions
of the ‘saved’ and the ‘unsaved’ from his frame of discourse and directs his
(and our) attention to the needs of the whole of humankind of whatever
ethnic, religious or national background, male and female alike, whether
young or old, saint or sinner.

The implications are wide-ranging. Realisation of this principle as
the foundation for the Bahá’í conception of a future global order based
on justice requires that we abandon all our prejudices and that we fully
embrace diversity as the essential complement to oneness – the other
side, so to speak, of the oneness ‘coin’. This ‘unity paradigm’ stops diver--
sity being threatening and renders it something to be welcomed as
enriching human life. Bahá’ís are particularly fond of a metaphor to be
found in the Bahá’í scriptures that compares humankind to the ﬂowers
in a garden. The ﬂowers are diverse in kind and character, but the gar--
den is one single place. Diversity is actually essential to unity. Without
diversity, unity descends into uniformity – and uniformity, whether in
the biosphere or the sociosphere, is a kind of death. But diversity outside
the framework of unity leads to division. Unity and diversity are, in the
Bahá’í understanding, inextricably linked.

The source of human unity, in Bahá’í theological terms, is the one
creator God, whose divine qualities are reﬂected in the inner reality; it is
the capacity of all humans, of whatever race, religion or national origin,
to reﬂect these divine qualities that renders them deserving of moral
protection. As Matthew Weinberg writes:

> A Loving Creator exists Who is the Source of all that is. It is not
> simply because human beings have the capacity for rational choice
> that they deserve moral protection, as modern philosophic liber--
> alism would claim, but that they are spiritual beings who have the
> capacity to reﬂect Divine attributes such as love, creativity, and
> charity.

Bahá’ís of the United States to the ﬁrst session of the UN Commission
on Human Rights in February 1947 also makes this point:

> The source of human rights is the endowment of qualities, virtues
> and powers which God has bestowed upon mankind without dis--
> crimination of sex, race, creed or nation. To fulﬁl the possibilities
of this divine endowment is the purpose of human existence.

And here we come to the heart of the matter. The Bahá’í picture of
human nature is founded on notions of the divine origin of what con--
stitutes humanity at its very core – although it should be said that the
Bahá’í teachings on the relationship of divinity and creation are not sim--
ple and are beyond the scope of this paper. Suﬃce it to say that the Bahá’í
scriptures teach that each individual has ‘the image of God’ ‘engraved’ on
them as the essence of their being:

> O son of man! Veiled in My immemorial being and in the ancient
> eternity of My essence, I knew My love for thee; therefore I cre--
> ated thee, have engraved on thee Mine image and revealed to thee
> My beauty.
> It is this heritage that makes each human being worthy of moral
protection and the subject of inalienable human rights. Furthermore,
because humankind is one, each and every human being is a trust of the
whole:

> From this basic principle of the unity of the human family is
> derived virtually all other concepts concerning human rights
> and freedoms. If the human race is one, any notion that a par--

> Inextricably linked to these conceptions – of the divine origin of what
is fundamentally human, of the necessity that divinely conferred talents
and capacities must be discovered, trained and brought to bear in meet--
ing human needs, and of human oneness – is the principle that everyone
has the capacity, the right and the obligation to investigate reality for
themselves. Human beings must be free to discover and know God. In so
doing, they discover their own reality. This process of spiritual discovery
– of God and of oneself – is of the essence of life:

> For Bahá’ís, the most fundamental of human rights is the right of
> each individual to investigate reality for himself or herself, and to
> beneﬁt from the results of this exploration.
> The primary task of the soul will always be to investigate reality, to
> live in accordance with the truths of which it becomes persuaded
> and to accord full respect to the eﬀorts of others to do the same.
> Clearly the right to follow one’s conscience in matters of religion
and belief and the right to education are closely connected, and other
rights are necessary to make the fulﬁlment of this right in everyone’s
lives possible.

However, it may not be at all obvious in a secular frame of refer--
ence why the right to investigate reality for oneself assumes such central
importance in the Bahá’í universe of discourse. One might well ask, ‘Isn’t
the right to life prior to the right to investigate reality for oneself (and
all that follows from that right)?’ Clearly Bahá’ís would never deny the
importance of the right to life, physical safety, wellbeing and so on. But
the Bahá’í frame of reference includes what is considered in Bahá’í the--
ology to be transcendent and intangible; in a word, eternity. At stake is

not just what happens to humans in life ante-mortem but what happens,
according to Bahá’í beliefs, post mortem. The relationship of the soul to
its God can, under certain circumstances, assume greater importance
for an individual than physical life itself – and the readiness of Bahá’ís at
diﬀerent times in the history of the community to lose their lives rather
than deny their faith bears witness to the importance of the eternal in
Bahá’í life and thought. This strong belief has had particular force for the
Bahá’ís in Iran and has helped shape the response of the Iranian Bahá’ís
to sustained persecution.

A written comment submitted by the Bahá’í International Community
to the ﬁftieth session of the Commission on Human Rights highlights the
importance of dignity and the fulﬁlment of individual potential:

> Recognition of the oneness of humanity gives rise to an elevated
> concept of human rights, one that includes the assurance of dig--
> nity for each person and the realization of each individual’s innate
> potential. This view diﬀers markedly from an approach to human
> rights that is limited to preventing interference with the individu--
> al’s freedom of action.
> To live a life that is fully human, that allows the individual, regard--
less of gender, ethnic origin, religion or belief and so on, to develop their
capacities and to put them to use for their own beneﬁt and in service of
society requires that the individual be free to investigate reality them--
selves, to follow their conscience, to be educated, to have the necessary
physical and psychological well-being, to experiment with their aesthetic
and intellectual capacities, and to struggle to cultivate moral and spir--
itual insights. All of these are inextricably linked. We have God-given
capacities, the argument goes; God requires us to develop those capaci--
ties, and governments and individuals alike have the duty of ensuring
that it is possible to do this.

Human dignity is also a key concept in human rights discourse and,
indeed, in the Bahá’í approach to human rights. It is another of those
intangible but eﬀective qualities of human life. Societies give a high value
to the preservation of dignity, particularly for high status individuals. Loss
of dignity can have serious negative psychological and social repercus--
sions for individuals, and deliberate deprivation of dignity is one of the
more powerful sanctions that can be applied to persons who are deemed
to have transgressed. Preservation of the dignity of the vulnerable, nota--
bly of the elderly, is a matter of great concern in many societies.

In the Bahá’í view, dignity stems from what Quakers refer to as
‘that of God in everyone’. It is the divine in the human that deserves
respect, regardless of the person’s outer appearance and circumstances.
Protection and promotion of human dignity is the responsibility not just
of governments but also of individuals and of society in toto:

The Bahá’í view, then, is that ‘human rights are not arbitrary in nature
because they are grounded in the universal realities of human experi--
ence and embody values presupposed by a wide range of cultures.’ The
humanness that underlies local cultures is a universal and ‘includes a set
of potentialities, not wholly determinable, that are actualized diﬀerently
by every human being.’

lives.

This link between human rights and the creation of a social order
that allows individuals to fulﬁl the potentials that the Bahá’í teachings
say they have is crucial and motivates what the Bahá’í community does
to promote human rights.

bahá’í human rights activities
Having set out the theological underpinnings of the Bahá’í approach to
human rights, I now propose to examine some of the activities under--
taken by the Bahá’í community in relation to human rights. These activi--
ties fall into two broad areas: promotion of universal human rights in
general, and work to protect the human rights of Bahá’í communities that
suﬀer human rights abuses or are deprived of their human rights.

The latter area has focussed largely on the situation of the Bahá’ís in
Iran and it is this that I shall consider ﬁrst. I shall do this from the per--
spective of one who is part of an international team of Bahá’ís involved in
defending the human rights of Bahá’ís in Iran and who takes the lead in
work with the British government and parliament. I shall brieﬂy outline
the history and present situation of the persecution of the Bahá’ís there
and then look at how the Bahá’í International Community and leading
national Bahá’í communities work to defend the Bahá’ís in Iran.

and Practice (Ithaca, NY: Cornell University Press, 1989).

defence of the human rights of the bahá’ís in iran
Spickard considers that ‘the call for human rights has achieved what
amounts to near universal veneration. It has become a cultural icon . . .’
But, he says, ‘There is, of course, a counter-trend’:

> The growth of rights-discourse has occurred despite the opposi--
> tion of some non-Western regimes, who argue that rights lan--
> guage stems from Western philosophic principles and is thus not
> applicable to other civilisations. For example, Iran has announced
> that Islamic law requires an interconnection between religion and
> the state; so Iran represses Bahá’ís, whom it accuses of heresy.
> The Bahá’í community in Iran, founded in 1844, has suﬀered per--
secution at the hands of both the religious and the civil authorities of
that country from very early in its history. Around twenty thousand
Bahá’ís are estimated to have died as a result of pogroms in the nine--
teenth century. The community has continued to be persecuted periodi--
cally throughout the twentieth and twenty-ﬁrst centuries. From time to
time oppression of the Bahá’í community has been part of oﬃcial policy
under both the Pahlavi and the Khomeinist regimes.

Under the Islamic government of Ayatollah Khomeini it quickly
became clear that the intention of the new Islamic regime was to extirpate
the Bahá’í community from its country of origin. Even before Khomeini
returned to Tehran he had condemned the Bahá’ís as a political faction:

> In an interview given by the Ayatollah Khomeini to Professor James
> Cockcroft of Rutgers University in December 1978, the Ayatollah
> was asked: ‘Will there be either religious or political freedom for
> the Bahá’ís under an Islamic government?’ His answer: ‘They are
> a political faction; they are harmful. They will not be accepted.’
> Professor Cockcroft then asked: ‘How about their freedom of reli--
> gion – religious practice?’ The Ayatollah answered: ‘No.’
> 21 Ibid. 6.

22 A useful summary of the persecution of the Bahá’ís is to be found in The
Bahá’í Question: Iran’s Secret Blueprint for the Destruction of a Religious Community. An
Examination of the Persecution of the Bahá’ís of Iran (New York: Bahá’í International
Community, 1999).
23 Ibid. 20.
Once Khomeini had returned to Iran, the Bahá’í community was
rapidly engulfed in a ﬂood of attacks by government agencies and the
increasingly powerful Shi’ite clergy.

The holiest Bahá’í shrine in Iran was destroyed in 1979. In 1980 the
increasingly powerful Shi’ite clergy began to destroy the leadership of the
community, presuming that the ordinary Bahá’ís would quickly give way
to social pressure to recant their faith.

The Bahá’í International Community and Bahá’í communities across
the world moved to protest to the UN and to their national governments
about the treatment of the Bahá’ís in Iran. But despite the growing
international outcry, ever larger numbers of Bahá’ís were executed.

Bahá’ís arrested in the 1980s, particularly those who had been mem--
bers of the elected Bahá’í councils, were systematically tortured, and
some were subjected to mock executions or made to witness the torture
of friends or family members. The purpose of the torture was almost
always to try to force Bahá’ís to recant their faith or to confess to sup--
posed crimes or action against state security.

Perhaps the most notorious of the Bahá’í executions was the hanging
of ten Bahá’í women in Shiraz on 18 June 1983. The youngest of the ten
was only 17; her ‘crime’ had been teaching Bahá’í children’s classes.

In addition to the more ﬂorid examples of human rights abuses, the
authorities in Iran have consistently attempted to undermine the sur--
vival of the entire Bahá’í community. In the wake of the 1979 revolution,
Bahá’ís were refused access to primary, secondary and tertiary education;
Bahá’ís were dismissed from their jobs, and the pensions of retired Bahá’í
civil servants were terminated. The government expropriated as many of
the assets of individual Bahá’ís as it could: homes and personal posses--
sions were conﬁscated, life-savings swept away, community properties
transferred to the state, the assets of Bahá’í welfare agencies conﬁscated.
Bahá’í holy places were desecrated and destroyed, and Bahá’í cemeteries
razed. Bahá’ís were forced to bury their dead in barren pieces of land
without any of the necessary funerary facilities.

In 2004, two signiﬁcant pieces of Bahá’í heritage were destroyed,

ties; and properties belonging to Bahá’ís continue to be conﬁscated.
Most seriously, Iranian Bahá’í youth are still deprived of access to higher
education, unless they deny their faith.

Given the importance placed upon education by the Bahá’í Faith, this
deprivation of access to higher education for its most able young people
is extremely serious. It is demoralising for the young people concerned
and leads to the increasing impoverishment of the Iranian Bahá’í com--
munity. The authorities in Iran have also made a number of attempts
to close down the Bahá’í Institute for Higher Education, established by
the Bahá’ís in Iran in 1987 as a way of harnessing their own resources to
educate Bahá’í youth at university level.

The eﬀorts made by the Iranian authorities to prevent young Bahá’ís
from receiving education are instances of a long-standing policy of the
Islamic Republic of Iran to suppress the development of the Bahá’í com--
munity. In his 1993 report to the UN Commission on Human Rights,
Reynaldo Galindo Pohl, special representative on Iran, revealed the exist--
ence of a secret memorandum drawn up by the Supreme Revolutionary
Council in 1991 on ‘the Bahá’í question’. The memorandum makes it
clear that the Supreme Revolutionary Council considered the Baha’i
question at the express instructions of the supreme leader, Ali Khamenei,
and it recommends steps to stiﬂe the development of the Bahá’í com--
munity in Iran.

The memorandum was approved by Khamenei’s own signature. It has
never been disavowed, and the policy it sets out remains in force.

To understand why the government of the Islamic Republic of Iran
would wish to suppress the Bahá’í community, which made important

1 July 2004, that the latter was an important piece of Islamic architectural heritage.

contributions to the social and economic development of the country
in the ﬁrst half of the twentieth century, one has to pay attention to the
theological position of the Shi’ite clerical hierarchy. Friedrich Aﬀolter
explains that

> In a country with already low religious diversity, a post-Islamic
> religion such as the Bahá’í Faith (while in itself a tool for making
> sense of a society in change) was perceived not only as a contra--
> diction of Islamic logic; it also was perceived as a threat to the
> legitimacy of Khomeinism. It went counter to the interests and
> emotional needs of the Iranian mullas and their followers. Hence,
> Bahá’ís were declared heretics, deviants and destructive ideolo--
> gists who ought to be exterminated. Doing so did not only help to
> get rid of a perceived threat; in addition, it also strengthened and
> consolidated ‘ties of closeness’ within the Shí’i faith community.
> Aﬀolter goes on to explain that the current Iranian regime, although
‘seeking to create a system . . . capable of enhancing the spiritual and
socio-economic liberation of the oppressed’, is propagating an authori--
tarian political culture:

> This time, however, it is based on an assertion of divine legiti--
> macy for an Iranian Shí’i population socialized into subjugation to
> authority, communal identity, and acceptance of the clergy’s claim
> of the divine right to lead. In this context, scapegoating anything
> that is perceived as a threat to the clergy’s legitimacy becomes a
> political imperative.
If Aﬀolter’s analysis is correct, the persecution of the Bahá’ís is based
partly in theology and partly in power politics.

Ghanea’s analysis would seem to add weight to this perspective. She
considers that her extensive study of the treatment of the Bahá’ís in Iran,
which she sees as a test case for the UN’s human rights system, has
implications for the relationship between religion and the State and for
the relationship between religion and human rights.

clergy, religiously heterodox and ineluctably in conﬂict with the tradi--
tional understanding that there can be no prophet after Muhammad.
Religious and civil authorities, whose legitimacy is based on an Islamist
ideology, cannot countenance the survival of a community which they
see as challenging everything they stand for.

Article 13 of the Iranian Constitution makes it clear that Iranian Zoro-
astrians, Jews and Christians are the only recognised minority religious
groups free to practise their religions within the limits of the law. It fol--
lows, therefore, that Bahá’ís are not free so to do, and long experience
shows that the Iranian authorities hold the Bahá’ís to be ‘unprotected
inﬁdels’.

Representatives of the Iranian government have repeatedly and pub--
licly denied that the Bahá’í community is a religious minority at all, let
alone the largest religious minority in Iran, a claim made by the Bahá’í
International Community and backed by references in a range of UN
documents. They have also subjected the Bahá’ís to a range of wholly

unsustainable accusations: that they were supporters of the Pahlavi
regime; that they are agents of Zionism; that they are involved with
prostitution, adultery and immorality; and that they are heretics or ene--
mies of Islam. All these accusations have been consistently and eﬀec--
tively refuted by those involved in the defence of the human rights of
the Iranian Bahá’ís.

Defence of the rights of the Bahá’ís in Iran has been co-ordinated
over many years by the United Nations Oﬃces of the Bahá’í International
Community (bic) in New York and Geneva, with the aim of seeking the
full emancipation of the Bahá’í community in Iran to practise their reli--
gion freely and publicly.

The whole strategy of the Bahá’í International Community and of
Bahá’í National Spiritual Assemblies in support of the bic is based on
arguing from international human rights norms that the abusive treat--
ment of the Bahá’ís in Iran is egregious and that the justiﬁcations put
forward by the Iranian government for its treatment of the Bahá’í minor--
ity are wholly fallacious. Iran as a State Party to all the relevant UN
Covenants must protect the human and civil rights of all its citizens. As
Professor Abdelfattah Amor, Special Rapporteur on religious intolerance
to the 1996 Commission on Human Rights, stated in his report to the
Commission:

> The Special Rapporteur deems it important that Iran . . . should

34 The affairs of the Bahá’í community throughout the world are governed by
elected councils or assemblies at local and national levels. The world governing council
of the Bahá’í community is also an elected body and is called the Universal House of
Justice. The Bahá’í International Community is an international ngo with consultative
rights at ecosoc; every National Spiritual Assembly or national Bahá’í governing
council is an affiliate of the Bahá’í International Community.

> and obligations, to be worthy of respect and attention and to have
the right to consideration and protection.

It should be noted that the second sentence of the paragraph cited
above is wholly consistent with the principles underpinning the Bahá’í
approach to human rights in general, as set out in the ﬁrst section of this
paper.

The full emancipation of the Bahá’í community will be considered by
the bic as achieved once the Iranian government has fully implemented
a series of recommendations concerning the situation of the Bahá’ís in
Iran made by the Special Rapporteur, who calls on the government of
Iran to allow Bahá’ís access to education and employment, the right to
citizenship, freedom to bury and honour their dead, freedom of move--
ment, security of the person, re-establishment of the Bahá’í institutions,
non-discrimination on grounds of religion and belief, return of commu--
nity properties, and legal and human-rights training for the judiciary.

It should also be noted that the Bahá’ís do not seek to become a ‘rec--
ognised’ religion under the Iranian Constitution, but seek, rather, ‘the
right to freedom of thought, conscience and religion’ and the ‘freedom,
either individually or in community with others and in public or private,
to manifest [their] religion or belief in worship, observance, practice and
teaching’, as set out in the International Covenant on Civil and Political
Rights (Article 18), an instrument to which Iran is a State Party.

In other words, the Bahá’í community does not in any way seek
exceptional treatment, but works, as a matter of principle fully within
the international human rights framework, to win for the Bahá’ís in Iran
what should be theirs by right.

promotion of universal human rights
In addition to defending the human rights of the Bahá’ís in Iran (and in
other countries when necessary), the Bahá’í community nationally and
internationally does a lot of work to promote universal human rights. As

35 Doc.E/cn.4/1996/95/Add.2. bic has set these recommendations out as a series
of benchmarks which can be used to measure progress in the phased implementation
of the Special Rapporteur’s recommendations. The Special Rapporteur on Religious
Intolerance is now known as the Special Rapporteur on Freedom of Religion and
explained towards the beginning of this paper, Bahá’í religious principles
are such that the community is bound to make its views known in rel--
evant forums and do what work it can in promoting the principles and
practices of human rights.

However, to grasp the nature of the work that the Bahá’í community
does in this ﬁeld it is essential also to understand that any aspect of
the Bahá’í teachings must be seen in the context of the whole corpus of
Bahá’í scripture. Certain themes appear again and again in Bahá’u’lláh’s
writings. As already mentioned, unity is an overarching theme in the
Bahá’í universe of discourse – everything else is seen in the light of unity.
Justice is another, related, central theme – and for Bahá’u’lláh, justice is
something that starts with the individual’s own investigation of reality
and goes on to embrace not only judicial applications of justice, but social
and economic justice as well.

The implication for Bahá’í practice is that every element of life is
interconnected with every other element. In a particularly powerful
passage in his writings, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá reminds the Bahá’ís of a saying of
Bahá’u’lláh, ‘Ye are all the fruits of one tree, the leaves of one branch.’
‘Abdu’l-Bahá continues:

> Thus hath He likened this world of being to a single tree, and all
> its peoples to the leaves thereof, and the blossoms and fruits. It
> is needful for the bough to blossom, and leaf and fruit to ﬂour--
> ish, and upon the interconnection of all parts of the world-tree,
> dependeth the ﬂourishing of leaf and blossom, and the sweetness
> of the fruit.
> For this reason must all human beings powerfully sustain one
> another . . . Let them at all times concern themselves with doing a
> kindly thing for one of their fellows, oﬀering to someone love, con--
> sideration, thoughtful help. Let them see no one as their enemy,
> or as wishing them ill, but think of all humankind as their friends;
> regarding the alien as an intimate, the stranger as a companion,
> staying free of prejudice, drawing no lines.

The moral imperative in these lines is one that ‘Abdu’l-Bahá lived by;

Belief. The current Special Rapporteur is Mrs Asma Jahangir.

it connects very strongly with how Bahá’ís strive to live and how Bahá’í
individuals and institutions work to make human rights a reality.

These themes of human oneness, of equality of treatment for all, of
justice in all its forms, are ones that run through the many statements
made by the Bahá’í International Community to the UN since 1947. A
quick survey of issues addressed by these statements indicates both the
range of concerns that the Bahá’í community believes require attention
and the way in which the above-mentioned central Bahá’í principles
are applied to ﬁnding solutions to the world’s problems. Issues include
human rights, the advancement of women, global prosperity (includ--
ing care for the environment) and moral development. Much is being
done by the Bahá’í community on international, national and local lev--
els, through public statements and practical projects, to develop and
promote good practice in all of these areas. The Bahá’í International
Community has addressed statements to all the major UN conferences,
to the General Assembly and to a wide range of UN commissions and
agencies. A small and fairly random sample of statements (in no particu--
lar order) includes:
• A Bahá’í Declaration of Human Obligations and Rights – statement by

> the National Spiritual Assembly of the Bahá’ís of the United States to
> the ﬁrst session of the UN Commission on Human Rights, February
> 1947.
• Human Rights and Extreme Poverty – statement to the UN Sub-

> Commission on the Prevention of Discrimination and Protection of
> Minorities, August 1994.
• Responsibility to Promote Human Rights – written comment on the

> Draft Declaration on the Right and Responsibility of Individuals,
> Groups and Organs of Society to Promote and Protect Universally
> Recognised Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms, December
> 1993.
• Development, Democracy and Human Rights – statement to the UN

World Conference on Human Rights, June 1993.
• Protection of Minorities – written statement presented to the 55th

session of the UN Commission on Human Rights.
• Promoting Religious Tolerance – statement to the UN Commission
on Human Rights, January 1995.
• The Role of Religion in Promoting the Advancement of Women –

> written statement to the UN Fourth World Conference on Women,
> Beijing, September 1995.
• The Right to Education – written statement to the 56th session of the

UN Commission on Human Rights, March 2000.
• United Nations Decade on Human Rights Education – written state--

> ment to the 53rd session of the UN Commission on Human Rights,
March 1997.

In making these and many other statements, the Bahá’í International
Community believes that it can help shape the thinking of governments
and inﬂuential groups and individuals about the principles and practices
of human rights. The statements always address the headline issue from a
foundation of the central Bahá’í principles outlined above and others that
derive from them. They do not – and could not, given the Bahá’í stance
on non-involvement in partisan politics – suggest political solutions to
these issues, but rather show how the Bahá’í spiritual principles, thought--
fully applied, will create a foundation for a new social order in which the
abuses under consideration would no longer happen. For example, the
statement on Human Rights and Extreme Poverty shows how the appli--
cation of spiritual principles will change the nature of society:

> The Baha’i approach to the problem of extreme poverty is based
> on the application of spiritual principles. The economic relation--
> ships of a society reﬂect the values of its members. Therefore,
> to transform those relationships, man’s character must be trans--
> formed. Until justice is valued over greed, the gap between the
> rich and the poor will continue to widen, and the dream of sus--
> tainable economic growth, peace and prosperity will elude our
> grasp. Sensitizing mankind to the vital role of spiritual values in
> solving economic problems will, we are convinced, create a new
> impetus for change.
> The emphasis is always on the need for transformation of individuals
and society, and the inextricable connection between the two is shown.

36 Bahá’í International Community, Human Rights and Extreme Poverty, statement
to the UN Sub-Commission on the Prevention of Discrimination and Protection of
Minorities, Geneva, August 1994.

And, while legal protections for human rights are understood to be nec--
essary, they are clearly not suﬃcient. We have a collective and pressing
responsibility for ensuring that the human rights of every individual are
protected and fostered:

> it is impossible to implement human ‘rights’ without a sense of
> collective responsibility. Indeed, if the whole of humanity is one
> interconnected body, then an injury to any member is an injury to
> the body as a whole. Thus it behooves every individual member of
> the human family to take action whenever and wherever human
rights violations occur.

An examination of the meaning of the concept of ‘responsibility’ takes
us right back to our starting point:

> Yet in the Bahá’í perspective, the concept of ‘responsibility’ in the
> context of human rights encompasses the responsibility devolving
> upon every person, as a divinely-created being, to recognize the
> essential oneness of the human race and to promote the human
rights of others with this motivation.

Bahá’í communities around the world also undertake a wide range of
projects to learn in practice how the Bahá’í principles can be applied to
human rights (broadly understood) and other concerns. In some coun--
tries the Bahá’í community has encouraged governments to introduce
human rights education as an essential part of the curriculum:

> As we educate our children to accept diversity as part of the human
> condition and to extend respect and full human rights to the en--
> tire human family, civilization will beneﬁt from an unimaginable
> wealth of contributions.

In that respect, human rights education could be considered basic
education for life in the modern world.

Even the work done by Bahá’ís in many countries to educate and train

children, youth, women and men in a wide range of knowledge and skills,
from basic literacy to agriculture and village banking, can be understood
as a major contribution to human rights by empowering the individuals
and communities concerned with a new sense of purpose and dignity to
manage their own lives and to interact on a more equal footing with gov--
ernments and large organisations and businesses. As ‘Abdu’l-Bahá com--
mented in Secret of Divine Civilization, his seminal work on the creation
of well-developed society:

> And the honour and distinction of the individual consist in this,
> that he among all the world’s multitudes should become a source
> of social good. Is any larger bounty conceivable than this, that an
> individual, looking within himself, should ﬁnd that by the conﬁrm--
> ing grace of God he has become the cause of peace and well-being,
> of happiness and advantage to his fellow men? No, by the one true
> God, there is no greater bliss, no more complete delight.

conclusion
From the foregoing it becomes apparent that, far from being in con--
ﬂict with modern human rights norms, the Bahá’í Faith’s foundational
principles – to be found in the writings of its founder, Bahá’u’lláh, and
of his eldest son and successor as head of the community, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá
– are entirely congruent with the principles of human rights as found in
the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and successive UN human
rights covenants. The Bahá’í International Community has consistently
and openly supported, through statements and through involvement in
the UN human rights system, the development and implementation of
international human rights law. National Bahá’í communities and their
governing councils have, within the limitations of their resources, rein--
forced the work of the bic, working with their respective governments
and with partner human rights ngos to build a culture of human rights
across the world.

Regrettably the Bahá’ís have also had to defend the human rights of
their co-religionists in Iran (and in some other countries) over a number
of years. Working with national governments and with the UN human

40 ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, Secret of Divine Civilization, 2–3.

rights system, the Bahá’í community has developed a considerable level
of expertise as an international human rights ngo; its work is widely
respected by diplomats and by other human rights ngos. It has been
eﬀective, without resort to violence or to partisan political manoeuvring,
in persuading governments to help stay the hand of the oppressor, but
this aspect of its work is far from over. Much remains to be done before
the Bahá’ís in Iran can be said to be fully emancipated, to be free to mani--
fest their faith in accordance with international law.

The motivating vision of the Bahá’í community is the development of
a peaceful and united global civilisation. Promotion of universal human
rights is integral to the rest of the work the community does to help make
this vision a reality.
