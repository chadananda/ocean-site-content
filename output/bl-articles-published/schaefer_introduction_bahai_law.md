AN INTRODUCTION TO BAHA’I LAW:

DOCTRINAL FOUNDATIONS, PRINCIPLES AND
STRUCTURES*

Udo Schaefer†

INTRODUCTION
While the last and most recent of the revealed religions is generally
considered to be Islam, religious scholars are gradually recognizing that
a religion founded later in the modern era, the Baha-’i- Faith, displays all
the characteristics of a universal religion.1 Whereas scholars working in
the field of Islamic Studies tended in the past to treat this religion under
the sub-heading “Islamic sects,” and Religious Studies scholars for
many years paid little attention to it, more recent research counts the
Baha-’i- Faith as one of the world religions.2

The present study aims to provide an overview of the revealed law3

† Udo Schaefer, born 1926, studied law at the Ruperto Carola University in Heidelberg.

After receiving his degree (doctor iuris utriusque) in the discipline of church law he worked for
thirty years in the German judiciary, first as a judge, and later as chief attorney at the State Court
of Heidelberg. He served for fifteen years as a member of the National Spiritual Assembly of the
Baha-’i-s in Germany and is the author of numerous articles and books in the field of Religious
Studies, with works translated into seven languages.

of the Baha-’i- Faith, which is of interest for students of both legal history
and religious studies. We are entering virgin territory here, as no attempt
has yet been made at a systematic jurisprudence, nor has a tradition of
Baha-’i- jurisprudence been established that might compare with the
Islamic Us.u-lu’l-fiqh. Since the foundations and principles of this law
can be understood only within their theological context, and knowledge
of this context is rare outside the Baha-’i- community, some basic
background information about the faith will be provided first.

I.    THE BAHA- ’-I FAITH: ITS HISTORY AND DOCTRINES
Baha-’i-s believe that around the same time as philosophers4 were
announcing the “death of God,” a new Epiphany took place in which
“the God of Abraham, and of Isaac, and of Jacob”5 once again revealed
Himself to humanity. The cradle of the Baha-’i- Faith was nineteenth-
century Iran. This religion, whose relationship to Shi-‘a Islam is
comparable to the relationship of Christianity to Judaism, sees itself as
the fulfilment of Islamic eschatology, and also as the fulfilment of the
promise found in all religions concerning the coming of a World
Reformer at the “end of time.”6

What we encounter in Baha-’ism is an archetype of religious
history: an announcement by a forerunner and herald (the Ba-b)7

systematic compilations (Ishra-q Khavari-, Abdu’l H.amid, Ganji-nih-yi-H.udu-d wa Ah.ka-m (New
Delhi 1980) and Fa-d.il-i Ma-zindara-ni-, Amr wa Khalq. vols. 1-4 (Tehran 1965-1974)) could not be
taken into consideration here, as they have not yet been translated. Two doctoral theses
concerning the order of the community and its organs have so far been produced, one in the field
of law and one in that of the social sciences: Schaefer, Die Grundlagen der Gemeindeordnung der
Baha-’i- (Heidelberg 1957) (downloadedable at <www.udoschaefer.com>); Kent Beveridge, Die
gesellschaftspolitische Rolle der Baha-’i--Verwaltungsordnung innerhalb der Gemeinschaft der
Baha-’i-, unter besonderer Betrachtung der zwei leitenden Institutionen (Vienna 1977). A doctoral
thesis in the field of political science (Ulrich Gollmer, Gottesreich und Weltgestaltung.
Grundlegung einer politischen Theologie im Baha-’i-tum) has, unfortunately, not been published. It
is remarkable that, apart from Waldbridge’s overview and Roshan Danesh’s article, (Beyond
Integration and Separation. The Dynamic Nature of Baha-’i- Law <http://www.telosplanet>), this
subject has not yet been taken up in the generally much more abundant literature published in
English. Concerning the references to literature, it should be pointed out that while it is usually
regarded as undesirable to quote frequently from one’s own publications, I have done so for the
simple reason that other relevant academic literature on this subject scarcely exists.

founder (Baha-’u’lla-h)8 of a new religion. Baha-’i-s regard him as the
announcer of the Will of God for a new age, who has established a new
divine Covenant with mankind, which is “the Ark of Salvation.”9 His
mission is to establish the Kingdom of God on earth, through the
unification of mankind in one global family. Baha-’i-’s allegorical
exegesis of eschatological signs in the Bible and Qur’a-n,10 and the claim
to a post-Qur’a-nic divine revelation,11 especially the abrogation of the
Shari-‘a,12 are regarded by Islamic orthodoxy as heresy and apostasy, a
skandalon that led to the public execution of the Ba-b,13 to bloody
massacres among the early community of believers, and to the
imprisonment and banishment of Baha-’u’lla-h throughout the forty years
of his ministry. Baghda-d, Istanbul, Edirne and ‘Akka-14 in the Holy Land
were the stations of his exile. The conflict which continues to this day
has resulted in the persecution of the Iranian Baha-’i-s under the regime of
the Ayatollahs.15

Baha-’u’lla-h’s Message16 is universal in scope: its central theme is

history is dynamic: He reveals Himself to mankind not “once for ever”20
in a single, final drama of salvation, but in a progressive, cyclically
recurring process. Like all living things, religion is subject to the
process of deterioration over time. It is therefore in need of renewal.21
The new revelation at the “time of the harvest”22 is the divine
Reformation,23 through which “the one and indivisible religion of God”24
is creatively adapted to the needs of a new age and the dwindling vitality
of faith in God25 is restored.

The doctrine of “progressive revelation”26 opens up a new
theological paradigm: religious truth is absolute in its claim to truth for
mankind, but is relative in its dependence on man’s capacity and
understanding and in its cultural and historical limitations.27 All
revealed religions are “facets”28 of a single ultimate truth and are part of
heilsgeschichte—the divine plan for the salvation of mankind. All of
them “have proceeded from one Source and are the rays of one Light.”29
Salvation is therefore a continuous, never-ending process that is open to
the future; its goal the progressive divine education of the human race.30

The Baha-’i- Faith sees itself not only as a doctrine of salvation, but
also as a concrete prescription for living. For Baha-’i-s, Baha-’u’lla-h is
redemptor31 and legislator.32 A major constitutive element of Baha-’i-

they have the qualities of pre-existence and innate, existential knowledge (cf. ‘Abdu’l-Baha-, Some
Answered Questions 40: 6). On the subject of Baha-’i- prophetology, see Schaefer, Beyond the
Clash 123-135.

32. Shoghi Effendi calls him “the Judge, the Lawgiver and Redeemer of all mankind” (God
theology is Baha-’u’lla-h’s doctrine of the Covenant,33 which God has
concluded with humanity through each of his Prophets. The Covenant,
which expresses man’s dependence on divine direction, guidance, and
mercy, is the basis for the twin obligations of the individual: recognition
(‘irfa-n) of the Manifestation of God and compliance with the divine
commandments.34

For Baha-’i-s, salvation for humanity arises out of the Covenant, the
core of which is the Law. The commandments and statutes of God are
not, as some Protestant theologians assert, an “obstacle,” “blocking” the
path to God,35 but are instead “the breath of life unto all created
things,”36 “the keys of My mercy for My creatures.”37 At the same time,
however, they constitute “the means of order” and “the instrument of
union.”38 They maintain “order in the world” and guarantee “the
security of its peoples.”39

Hence, in addition to its “vertical” dimension relating to the
salvation of the individual, salvation also has a “horizontal,” intrinsically
political40 dimension: the entire human race is to be guided to salvation
and released from moribund social and political structures. The worldly
goal, as foreseen by the Jewish prophets,41 is the establishment of world

passes by 93).

33. ‘ahd, mitha-q. The concept of the Covenant, the insight that man is dependent on the
divine guidance and mercy provided by the revelation, is a recurring motif in the scripture (cf.
Kita-b-i Aqdas 1; Tablets 10: 4; 5: 11 and others).

> 34. Baha-’u’lla-h, Kita-b-i Aqdas 1.

> 36. Kita- b-i Aqdas 2.

37. Kita-b-i Aqdas 3. It is from the Law that man recognizes his obligations towards God,
since it is through his obedience that he is associated with God in the Covenant. Although belief
(i.e., recognition of the Manifestation of God) is the foundation—”Whoso is deprived thereof hath
gone astray, though he be the author of every righteous deed” (Kita-b-i Aqdas 1)—divine grace is
granted not sola fide, but through belief and righteous deeds: “These twin duties are inseparable.
Neither is acceptable without the other” (id.). Thus, outward legality is not sufficient; what is
demanded is inner devotion: “Observe My commandments, for the love of My beauty” (Kita-b-i
Aqdas 4; The Hidden Words, Arabic 38). Since righteous deeds are dependent upon “acceptance”
by God (cf. Kita-b-i Aqdas 161; Prayers and Meditations 46: 3; Gleanings 94: 4; 135: 5), the
individual does not have an automatic claim to salvation even if he fulfils all the commandments
of God (on the concept of divine law, see Schaefer, Imperishable Dominion 188-190). This
amounts to a rejection of the antinomist positions that exist in Protestant theology. (On this
subject, cf. Schaefer, Imperishable Dominion 180ff.; Schaefer, Towfigh, Gollmer, Making the
Crooked Straight 218f.) and in Sufism (cf. Saiedi, Logos and Civilisation 216-224). On Baha-’-

II.   THE THEOLOGICAL FOUNDATION OF THE LAW

A.     Religion and Society43
The political dimension of religion44 and its indispensable function
in ensuring the stability of the state and society is a central theme in the
scripture of Baha-’u’lla-h. The offer of divine salvation is addressed to
the state and society, to the entire human race. All the Prophets of God
are described in the scripture as divine “physicians” who, in their
infallible wisdom, prescribe the “remedy” required to cure mankind of
its manifold ailments.45

All the religions have had a lasting influence on the order of the
world and taught man what it is that holds society together at the deepest
level: values and ideals that are rooted in faith and are therefore
unquestionable, awareness of absolute obligations and metaphysical
responsibility, willingness to practice solidarity, loyalty to the state and
obedience to the law. The religions have instilled virtues that are
indispensable for life in human society and for the stability of the
community, and have instructed mankind as to the highest motivation46
for moral behavior:

> Universal benefits derive from the grace of the Divine religions,
> for they lead their true followers to sincerity of intent, to high
> purpose, to purity and spotless honour, to surpassing kindness and
> compassion, to the keeping of their covenants when they have
> covenanted, to concern for the rights of others, to liberality, to
> justice in every aspect of life, to humanity and philanthropy, to
> valour and to unflagging efforts in the service of mankind. It is
> religion, to sum up, which produces all human virtues, and it is
these virtues which are the bright candles of civilization.47

Because in religion, moral values are rooted in and legitimized by
faith, and the hierarchy of values is passed on through education from
generation to generation to keep it alive in society’s consciousness, it is

44. On this subject, as a whole, see Gollmer, in Schaefer, Towfigh, Gollmer, Making the
Crooked Straight, pp. 418-477; Ariane Sabet-Sobhani, Die politischen Botschaften des
Religionsgründers Baha-’u’lla-h (Diss.) (Bamberg 2000).

47. ‘Abdu’l-Baha-, Secret of Divine Civilization 98.
faith that is the ultimate foundation of social order and of the state. This
idea, which is by no means new,48 is expressed repeatedly in the
scripture of Baha-’u’lla-h: “Religion is a radiant light and an impregnable
stronghold for the protection and welfare of the peoples of the world, for
the fear of God impelleth man to hold fast to that which is good, and
shun all evil.”49

The frequently cited crisis of religion,50 the decline in the practice
of religion as a way of life, demonstrates the connection between
religion and morality more clearly than ever.51 Sociologists and
economic experts are gradually coming to realize that man’s “limited
rationality”52 is unable to cope with the complexity of our high-tech
world, that the spirit of democracy “survives on the remnants of pre-
modern values”53 and that the secular state is dependent on religion for
the provision of meaning and values.54 No society can be kept under
control by laws alone: Quid leges sine moribus vanae proficiunt?55

48. The idea can be found in the works of Cicero (De officiis) and John Locke (Political
Essays). Francis Bacon formulated it thus: Religio praecipuum humanae societatis vinculum
(Essays, “Of Unity in Religion” 6). Jakob Burckhardt called religion “the main bond of human
society” (Reflections on History 93).

> 49. Tablets 8: 53; see Kita-b-i Aqdas 2; Tablets 5: 12; 6: 19.

50. Eighty years ago the philosopher Karl Jaspers spoke of “the twilight of the gods”, which
is advancing “into nothingness with a radicality hitherto unknown” (Die geistige Situation der Zeit
16). Pope John Paul II perceives a deep “crisis of modern Catholic moral theology” (Veritatis
Splendor 1993, nos. 5, 29, 32, 84, 90, 93). He formulated this as follows: “Dechristianization,
which weighs heavily upon entire peoples and communities once rich in faith and Christian life,
involves not only the loss of faith or in any event its becoming irrelevant for everyday life, but
also, and of necessity, a decline or obscuring of the moral sense” (id. no. 106). On the whole
subject see Heiner Barz, Postmoderne Religion am Beispiel der jungen Generation in den Alten
Bundesländern, Opladen 1992; Friedrich Kardinal Wetter, Zur Glaubenssituation in Deutschland,
in: zur debatte 2ff (Jan./Feb. 1989).

51. Half a century ago the Catholic theologian Romano Guardini prophesied that the future
will “bring a frightful yet salutary preciseness” illuminating the relationship between religion,
culture and the social order: “As the benefits of Revelation disappear even more from the coming
world, man will truly learn what it means to be cut off from Revelation.” (The End of the Modern
World 123).

55. Horace, Carmina 3, 24, 55. [“What is the use of laws without morals?”]. The Harvard
sociologist Daniel Bell observes that religion offers protection against the anarchic impulses of
man. He refers to Jean-Jacques Rousseau’s statement that “every society is held together either by
force (the army, militia and police) or by moral laws” (The Cultural Contracitions of Capitalism
157, 154). In her study of the much-discussed concept of “civil society,” Wendy Heller writes:

> When religion is consciously ejected from political life at the front gate, it inevitably
> comes in again through a backdoor as what has been called ‘civil religion’ simply
> because no structure of political order can exist without some kind of moral architecture,
> in other words some set of transcendent beliefs and values that constitute its organized
> principles.
(The Religious Foundations of Civil Society 33).

The decline of religion has inevitable consequences for society:
values are losing their religious legitimation and, hence, their absolutely
binding nature. The growing relativity of values is causing human
society gradually to lose its orientation and its cohesion; conflicts, and
the tendency to seek violent solutions to them, are increasing, resulting
in a greater need for social regulation.56 The control systems that
precede those of penal law, such as the family, school, and
neighborhood ties, with their stabilizing function in important spheres of
life, are less and less effective. The community is losing its stability and
is increasingly subject to disruption. Baha-’u’lla-h has described the
relationship between these developments as follows:

> Should the lamp of religion be obscured, chaos and confusion will
> ensue, and the lights of fairness and justice, of tranquillity and
> peace cease to shine . . . .57 The greater the decline of religion, the
> more grievous the waywardness of the ungodly. This cannot but
lead in the end to chaos and confusion.58

Thus, for Baha-’i-s religion plays a critical role in maintaining social
life.

B. The Concept of the State
Baha’u’llah’s texts convey a positive image of the state. Worldly
power, which also implies the state’s right to avenge punishable
offenses, is legitimatised by express reference to the New Testament59
and the Qur’a-n,60 which insist that all power is “from God” and the kings
and rulers should be “the emblems of justice:”61 “God hath committed
into your hands the reins of the government of the people, that ye may
rule with justice over them, safeguard the rights of the downtrodden, and
punish the wrong-doers.”62

Should the governors fail in this duty, they will “be called upon to
answer” before God.63 There is little that comes in for greater or more
insistent condemnation by Baha-’u’lla-h than the autocratic systems of
government of his own era, the tyranny and arbitrary rule of those in
power, the oppression and exploitation of the people and the lack of

56. Baha-’u’lla-h alludes to this situation: “Were men to strictly observe that which the Pen of
the Most High hath revealed in the Crimson Book, they could then well afford to dispense with
the regulations which prevail in the world.” (Tablets 7: 24).

legal rights for the ordinary subjects.64 His scripture frequently takes up
the theme of the structural elements of a just system of government,65
gives legitimation to democratic rule66 and emphasizes obedience to the
law and the state as a religious duty.67

C.Justice in the Revelation of Baha-’u’lla-h
The norms of law (fiqh),68 ethics (akhla-q)69 and rituals (‘iba-da-t)
emanate from the justice of God, their source is divine revelation. God’s
laws and ordinances (h.udu-d, ah.ka-m) are contingent expressions of His
sovereign, unfathomable Will and are therefore “the essence of justice
and the source thereof.”70 The revealer of God’s purpose, who is His
“representative and mouthpiece,”71 “incarnate[s] the highest, the
infallible standard of justice [‘adl] unto all creation.”72 That is why
Baha-’u’lla-h calls his Book of Laws, the Kita-b-i Aqdas, “the unerring
balance (qist.a-su’l-h.aqq)73 established among men.”74 To the Baha-’i-s it
is the standard against which truth is distinguished from error, good
from evil.

Law and justice are closely related terms. The rank of law in the
revelation of Baha-’u’lla-h is evident from the status assigned to justice
(al-’adlu wa’l-ins.a-f)75 in his system of values, for the goal of justice

and in my forthcoming Introduction to Baha-’i- Ethics (forthcoming George Ronald Publisher

(‘adl) is the rule of law. Justice (the sign of the Messiah76 and the
Mahdi)77 is the highest value in the world of order (‘adl),78 and at the
personal level of individual virtue (ins.a-f). It is—as in the philosophical
tradition79—“the most fundamental among human virtues.”80 When
Baha-’u’lla-h announces for the new age “the reign of justice . . . amongst
the children of men” so “that the light of justice may shine upon the
world,”81 he refers specifically to the establishment of a global rule of
law in a “new World Order,”82 “a system in which Force is made the
servant of Justice.”83 The establishment of state structures based on the
rule of law throughout the world means overcoming totalitarian systems
of rule and all forms of despotism and oppression.

Law is immanent in the revelation of Baha-’u’lla-h because this
revelation aims to reform the material world and its systems of order:
“The progress of the world, the development of nations, the tranquillity
of peoples, and the peace of all who dwell on earth are among the
principles [us.u-l] and ordinances [ah.ka-m] of God.”84 This immanence is
also evident in that revelation itself sets out law and also provides a
basis for the further development of law, as well as giving the
community its legal form,85 whose validity is therefore absolute.

III. THE SOURCES OF LAW86
The Baha-’i- community is in the possession of a revealed Law, a ius
divinum, whose source is the entire body of sacred texts emanating from
the pen of Baha-’u’lla-h, which together constitute the “Book” (al-kita-b).
The central text setting out legal norms is Baha-’u’lla-h’s Kita-b-i Aqdas,
which as the “Book of Laws” holds a special rank among the texts,87 but

> 76. Isa 11: 5; 26: 9; 32: 17. On this subject, see Cohen, Religion of Reason 429ff.

77. He will “fill the world with equity and justice” after finding the world “full of evil and
ungodliness” (H.adi-th, cf. SEI, key word “al-Mahdi” 1230-1238, vol. V). The Baha-’i-s consider
these eschatological figures to be the Ba-b and Baha-’u’lla-h.

78. ‘Adl is institutional justice. It is manifested in the principle of “reward and punishment,”
the two “pillars” on which “the canopy of world order is upraised.” (Tablets 8: 55; 3: 25; 6: 25; 8:
61). As to justice in the context of penal law and its relation to love and mercy, I refer to my
elucidations below, in the text accompanying notes 173-208.

87. This is immediately evident from its title as Ummu’l-Kita-b, the “mother book.” On this

there is no numerus clausus: legal norms (like moral instructions) are
scattered throughout the revealed scripture. They do not form a
consistent system;88 instead, they constitute supreme norms (as in the
case of legal provisions in the Qur’a-n) that require systematization and
specification. This is done not, as in Islam, by means of the
interpretation of the sacred texts but through supplementary legislation.89

In the canon of the normative prescriptions set out in the Kita-b-i
Aqdas a clear distinction between law and morality is perceivable, a
difference that was emphasized by Immanuel Kant.90 Nevertheless,
these two types of norms are mutually related,91 as both are facing the
same philosophical problems as to right action.92 Divine law must
always be seen and interpreted in the light of the moral instructions and
demands set out in the scripture. As Baha-’u’lla-h emphasizes (possibly
with regard to the Sufi’s disdain for law), the Kita-b-i Aqdas is not “a
mere code of laws [ah.ka-m]93,” not a dry codex, but is—on account of its
unprecedented dogmatic rooting,94—the unshakeable foundation of a
Baha-’i- legal system which will develop in the fullness of time. Ius
divinum is contained also in the testament of ‘Abdu’l-Baha-,95 which

term see Qur’a-n 43: 3; 13: 41; 85: 22.

88. A systematic set of norms is only partially evident. However, it should not be judged by
the strictly rational criteria of state legislation. The sacred as the “mysterium tremendum” (Rudolf
Otto, The Holy 12ff (1931)) is beyond rationality and its categories; it has its own logic.
Revelation is eruptive in nature, and its precipitation in the sacred texts has the character of
ancient rock. For detailed discussion of the character of divine legislation, see Schaefer, Towfigh,
Gollmer, Making the Crooked Straight 338ff.; Saiedi, Logos and Civilization 235ff.

90. Cf. Metaphysics of Morals, Doctrine of Right; Bielefeldt, Kants Symbolik 107ff; Welzel,
Recht und Sittlichkeit 45ff. This insight leads to the recognition that moral norms cannot be
simply turned into legal norms or legal criteria. Selflessness, one of the highest virtues—to take
but one example—cannot be decreed or made into a legal obligation. Impartiality is a high moral
duty (cf. ‘Abdu’l-Baha-, Selections 138: 1; 225: 2; Paris Talks 47: 4), an element of justice and a
pre-condition for all jurisdiction. In a legal system it can only be achieved through its
institutionalisation. Conflicts are to be removed by means of objective, procedural precautions
(i.e., specific provisions regarding such conflicts of interest) as expressed in the Roman legal
principle “Nemo iudex in sua causa” (Cod. Just. 3, 5).

91. Such as the virtue of chastity as an individual moral value and the prohibition in penal
law of extramarital intercourse (zina-’, Kita-b-i Aqdas 49). The penal norm covers only a small
area of possible violations of the obligations regarding sexual ethics.

92. Both spheres of norms were subjects of the philosophical reflections on natural law over
the millennia.

93. “Think not that We have revealed unto you a mere code of laws. Nay, rather, We have
unsealed the choice Wine (al-rah.-i q al-makhtu-m) with the fingers of might and power.” (Kita-b-i
Aqdas 5). “Sealed wine” is a Qur’a-nic metaphor for the delight of those who are close to God on
the Day of Judgement (cf. Qur’a-n 83: 25). This passage is “a rejection of the traditional Islamic-
jurisprudential approach to law. However, it is equally a rejection of the Sufi approach to law.
Both those approaches regarded the law as a “mere code.” (Saiedi, Logos and Civilization 217; see
id. 216–224).

> 94. Schaefer, Towfigh, Gollner, Making the Crooked Straight 396ff.

95. In the Kita-b-i Aqdas (121, 174) and in the Kita-b-i ‘Ahd (Tablets 15: 1-14), Baha-’u’lla-h

supplements and puts into concrete terms96 the constitutional order of the
community, the outlines of which had already been drawn up by Baha-’-
u’lla-h, and described in the Tablets of ‘Abdu’l-Baha- relating to the
principle of consultation.97

Further sources of law are the numerous letters98 written by Shoghi
Effendi, in which he formulated the principles and structures of the law
relating to the community. Shoghi Effendi did not have legislative
power;99 but until the establishment of the supreme legislative body
endowed with this power,100 he had to provide the community with at
least some basic legal guidance for the organizational process that began
in the 1920s. The legal principles that he established, on the basis of the
spirit and principles of the Faith, concerning the constitution of the
community and the functioning of its organs,101 which were integrated
into the statutes of these bodies,102 were made subject to approval by the
Universal House of Justice.103

Finally, the Baha-’i- community has a supplementary divine law that
is also in the category of ius divinum positivum, namely the legislation
made by the Universal House of Justice, the supreme administrative
body, which is democratically elected by the world community.104 The
published laws established by this body are therefore also sources of
law.105 Thus, the Baha-’i- divine law is a ius divinum positivum106 with

appointed his eldest son ‘Abdu’l-Baha- (1844-1921) the “Centre of the Covenant” and entrusted
him with the leadership of the community following his own death. ‘Abdu’l-Baha- was, as he
designated himself, the “mubayyin” (=Explainer), auctoritas interpretativa. However, in addition
to interpretation, he had a certain, albeit limited, degree of legislative competence (on this subject
cf. Schaefer, Towfigh, Gollmer, Making the Crooked Straight 349f., 684ff.), enabling him to draw
up details of the institutional structure of the community, which Baha-’u’lla-h had revealed only in
outline, and thus to assist in the implementation of the ratio legis divinae. See § VI, 3b below, as
well as footnote 130. On the life and works of ‘Abdu’l-Baha- see Shoghi Effendi, God passes by

sources of faith and an authoritative and integral component of
doctrine,109 but the legislation set out by the Ba-b in the Baya-n110 (which
repealed the Islamic Shari-‘a) was abrogated by Baha-’u’lla-h’s Kita-b-i
Aqdas;111

b) oral tradition. The revelation of Baha-’u’lla-h is attested by the
authentic texts that have been preserved in writing. Oral reports about
the sayings and actions of the Prophet (sunna) do not possess any
authority and are therefore a source for neither belief nor law. Hence,
the Baha-’i- Faith is exclusively a “religion of the book;” and the
Reformation principle sola scriptura112 is consistently put into practice;

c) natural law.113 The ultimate foundation of law and ethics is the
sovereign will of God, who manifests Himself in the divine revelation.

his doings,”115 express the Baha-’i- Faith’s voluntarist view of God:116

> 114. Qur’a-n 2: 254.

115. Id. 21: 34. This idea, which is a recurring leitmotif throughout the scripture, especially in
the Kita-b-i Aqdas (cf. verses 7, 47, 157), has been raised by Baha-’u’lla-h to the status of a
touchstone of faith: id. verses 161-163. Qur’a-n 21: 34 also provides the verdict on the question of
theodicy: the justification of God’s doings by reason is an expression of human presumptuousness
before God (see Rom 9: 20ff.).

116. This strain of thought can also be found in Christian theology, where it can be traced back
to St. Paul and St. Augustine. The Franciscan monk John Duns Scotus (1270-1303) formulated
categorically “Omne aliud ad Deo est bonum, quia a Deo volitum, et non converso . . . . quia est
bonum, ideo acceptatum (Oxoniense IIId, 19qu. 1a.7). William Ockham (1285-1350) followed
his path as did Luther and Calvin, who both saw the origin of all morals and all law in God’s
unfathomable will. In his treatise De servo arbitrio, Luther testifies to the unlimited sovereignty
of God: “Deus est, cuius voluntatis nulla est causa nec ratio, quae illi ceu regula vel mensura
praescribatur, cum nihil sit illi aequale aut superius, sed ipsa est regula omnium” (WA 712, vol.
18). And elsewhere: “His Will is His spirit-level, measure and weight” (id., vol. 16, Sermons on
the Book of Leviticus 148). Calvin formulated no less categorically: “A Deo enim summa est
iustitiae regula Dei voluntas, ut quidquid eo ipso quod vult iustum habendum est” (Institutio III,

God has “no associate in His judgment nor any helper in His
sovereignty,”117 He is “the Lord of all things and is the vassal of
none”118—not even (in the sense of Plato’s theory of ideas) of the truth
of eternal ideas. There is no superior law above Him to which He might
be subject,119 His will is the creator of all law and all values. Thus,
normative authority or the source of law is not ordered nature, not a
rational concept of the human nature defining for all eternity the idea of
good, nor a rationally recognizable “nature of things” (natura rerum),
but rather the decisions of God’s arbitrary will embodied in the sacred
scripture. Hence, the Baha-’i- Faith does not support the concept of a
natural law (ius divinum naturale), i.e., of pre-existent eternal values, of
an innate moral law that God has inscribed in the human heart120 that can
be discerned through reason. Humans have, as ‘Abdu’l-Baha- stated, no
“innate sense of human dignity” that prevents them from committing
evil actions: “This very sense of honor and dignity is itself one of the
bounties arising from the instructions of the Prophets of God.”121

Natural law, which in Catholic doctrine is part of the divine law
(ius divinum naturale) is based on the idea that the fundamental
principles of law and ethics are eternal verities of everlasting validity.
Classical natural law is in its essentials (prima principia) universal,
unchangeable, ahistoric and static. In contrast to this, in Baha-’ism the
divine law is exclusively a ius divinum positivum. The Baha-’i-s consider all
law122 that has been revealed by the prophets of the past and by Baha-’u’lla-h
(in the Pentateuch, the Qur’a-n and the Kita-b-i Aqdas) as historic
embodiments of God’s sovereign will in accordance with the
requirements of the specific age, and liable to abrogation in a new
revelation.123

23, 2 [“The supreme rule of justice is the will of God, and everything that He wills must be
accepted as just because He wills it”]. The predominant doctrine in classical Sunni Islam (Sha-fi’i,
Ibn H.anbal, Al-Ash’ari-), too, was that of voluntarism (cf. George F. Hourani, Reason and
Tradition 17).

117. Tablets 8: 19. The existence of a moral order binding upon God would be a limitation on
his sovereignty.

> 118. Prayers and Meditations 4: 1.

119. This is in contrast to Plato who in his early dialogue Euthyphro (marginal no. 10) raised
the decisive question: “Is the good loved by the gods because it is good, or is it good because it is
loved by the gods?”, which he clearly answered in the first sense: The gods are bound to the
eternal verities.

> 120. Cf. Rom 2: 15.
> 121. Selections 97.
> 122. The same is true for the norms of rituals (‘iba-da-t).

123. According to the paradigm of “progressive revelation” (cf. Schaefer, Beyond the Clash
121ff.) the revealed law belongs to the horizontal dimension of the revelation, whereas the norms
of morality are part of the vertical dimension, of the “changeless Faith of God, eternal in the past,
eternal in the future” (Kita-b-i Aqdas 182). This moral law belongs to the essentially unchanging
heart of religion that does not change nor alter and which will never be abrogated (‘Abdu’l-Baha-,

Because of their claim to truth, the revealed laws in relation to
humankind have always been absolute; because of their historic nature,
however, they are relative in character. As all prophets who are
“Manifestations of God” are endowed with the “knowledge of being”
(‘ilmu’l-wuju-d),124 and are aware of the necessary relations arising from
the nature of things,125 the laws they reveal are absolutely adequate to
the needs and exigencies of the human world in a specific age and are
expressions of these necessary relations.

IV. FORMAL ENACTION OF LEGAL NORMS AND THEIR DEVELOPMENT

A peculiar feature of Baha-’ism is that most norms of the revealed
law (including the ordinances of ritual)126 do not come into force ipso
iure upon their promulgation, but have to be formally enacted by
introductory acts of the supreme legislative body with global responsibility,
the “Universal House of Justice” (Baytu’l ‘adl al-a’z.am).127 This gradual
process of bringing laws into force128 derives from the founder of the
religion himself,129 who did not want the break with the customary order
of life to be too abrupt; instead, it should be fitted to the capacity of
people to accept it.130 Moreover, the socially relevant legal norms,
especially the regulations concerning criminal justice, presume the
existence of a society already shaped by the revelation, a “society

Some Answered Questions 11: 9). In each of the different cycles the eternal values have been
confirmed and renewed, because human virtues wane, and “only the husk subsists” (id. 11: 10).
In every new outpouring of the divine will in history these values are purified from their
incrustations, deformations, misinterpretations and shifts in emphasis, and are provided with new
semantic raiment, new sense, new emphasis and new force. On the concept of the “vertical and
horizontal dimensions,” see Schaefer, Beyond the Clash 141-144.

> 124. ‘Abdu’l-Baha-, Some Answered Questions 40.
> 125. Id. 40: 7.

126. Forms of worship (‘iba-da-t), cf. Tablets 3: 25. A further development of ritual norms has
been excluded by Baha-’u’lla-h himself. The catalogue of ceremonial ordinances constitutes a
numerus clausus that may not be increased: “Acts of worship [‘iba-da-t] must be observed
according to that which God hath revealed in His Book.” (Tablets 3: 25).

> 127. For further detail, see below §VII, 3.

128. This was due to the historical conditions of the religion, which differed from those of
Judaism and Islam, in which the people of God were also the “people of the state” and the Law of
God determined the structures of the new order from the very beginning. Throughout his
prophetic ministry, Baha-’u’lla-h was a prisoner and exile. The Baha-‘i- communities are a diaspora
in a completely different world.

> 129. Cf. Kita-b-i Aqdas, Introduction 5-6, Notes 126.

130. An example of the gradual introduction of the law is monogamy. The text (Kita-b-i Aqdas
63) limits the number of wives to two, but makes it clear that monogamy is intended. The early
believers were originally Muslims and were often married to several wives. Once a new
generation had grown up, ‘Abdu’l-Baha- made monogamy binding, in accordance with the ratio
legis (cf. Kita-b-i Aqdas, Notes 89; Schaefer, Towfigh, Gollmer, Making the Crooked Straight
346ff.).

destined to emerge from the chaotic conditions that prevail today.”131 A
further reason for the need for formal enactment of the revealed laws is
that they are valid for a period of at least one thousand years.132 As
social conditions on earth are subject to constant change, legal norms
that regulate specific details once and for all are in danger of leading to
rigid legal casuistry and to the petrification of the law. Baha-’u’lla-h has
eliminated this danger by providing the legal system “with an essential
element of flexibility:”133 The divine law regulates only “matters of
major importance.”134 Moreover, the legal norms have been revealed at
a high level of abstraction. They are so general and leave so much
unregulated that they need to be specified and adapted to the conditions
of the time. They are in need of detailed sub-regulations. In the Baha-’i-
community these sub-regulations—the development of the legal
system—do not result from authoritative interpretation by the religious
scholars, “the learned ones”135 (as the Rabbis in Judaism and the ‘ulama-‘
in Islam), but from supplementary legislation. The institution of a
supreme legislature that has been “freed from all error”136 allows for
constant adaptation of the law to changing social conditions, since this
legislature can amend137 its own laws, though ius divinum,138 and thus
take account of altered circumstances.139

Certain legal norms were (at least for the eastern Baha-’i-s)
considered binding from the start,140 others were declared universally
valid by ‘Abdu’l-Baha-, and later by Shoghi Effendi and eventually by
the Universal House of Justice.141 As far as the institutions and
structures of community order are concerned, implementation of law
began during the office of ‘Abdu’l-Baha-.142 It is self-evident that
revealed legal norms are effective in the community as ethical guidelines

even before they come into force.

V.      THE PERIOD OF VALIDITY OF THE IUS DIVINUM143
The claim raised by each of the three monotheistic religions to the
finality of their respective revelation inevitably leads to the claim that
the revealed law is of eternal validity.144 According to Baha-’u’lla-h’s
new paradigm of salvation,145 i.e., that of “progressive revelation,”146 in
which all claims to finality are rejected and future divine revelations are
promised,147 divine law can be valid only until such time as God
confirms or repeals the law He had previously promulgated—which man
is not authorized to change—through a new revelation.148 Since Baha-’-
u’lla-h has excluded the possibility that such a revelation will take place
before the passing of a thousand years,149 the ius divinum of the Baha-’i-s
is valid for at least one millennium.150

VI. SPECIFIC SPHERES OF LAW
Compared with the other world religions, the Baha-’i- Faith is still at
an early stage in its development, being currently only in its second
century. Hence, any information about such a complex sphere as law
must necessarily remain preliminary and fragmentary—it cannot hope to
be more than an initial attempt at analysis, inasmuch as not all of the
sacred texts have so far been translated into western languages.

The Law revealed by Baha-’u’lla-h (like all revealed law) is not a
consistent legal system, let alone a systematic code. It is rudimentary,

> 143. Cf. Schaefer, Grundlagen 57ff.

144. The law is “not in heaven” (Bab. Talmud, Baba Mezia 59b (353)). The eternal validity of
the laws given on Sinai was formulated by Maimonides in the ninth of the thirteen Jewish articles
of faith (see Friedländer, The Jewish Religion 139ff, 168ff). Belief in the finality of the revelation
of Muh. ammad is deduced from Qur’a-n 33: 40, 3: 20, 3: 85, 5: 3. According to orthodox Islamic
doctrine, the Qur’a-n is the eternal Word of God, Islam is the eternally valid religion and the Shari-‘a
the eternally valid Law (Mawdu-di-, Towards Understanding Islam 116).

the Clash 45ff, 149ff.

150. That the Universal House of Justice (cf. §VII,3a), which can repeal or amend its own
laws, is bound by the divine Law, is self-evident: “This body can supplement what Baha-’u’lla-h
has already formulated, but it cannot declare it invalid or modify it in any way.” (Shoghi Effendi,
Letter of 11 August 1935, in Helen Hornby, Lights of Guidance No. 1145). This also follows
from the justification given in the testament of ‘Abdu’l-Baha- for the competence of the Universal
House of Justice to repeal its own laws: “This it can do because that law formeth no part of the
Divine Explicit Text. The House of Justice is both the Initiator and the Abrogator of its own
laws.” (2: 8).

calculated for further development. The Kita-b-i Aqdas (like the Qur’a-n)
only regulates certain aspects of law, such as matters concerning
personal status (e.g. family law and inheritance law) and penal law. The
latter includes only a few norms which, in combination with statements
on the theology of law and on the purpose of punishment, are intended
to form the basis of a future criminal code. The Kita-b-i Aqdas and the
Testament of ‘Abdu’l-Baha- comprise the constitutional law of the
community.

Many aspects are still in need of clarification. Some provisions are
clearly identifiable as legal norms,151 while in the case of many
normative scriptural passages relating to society,152 clarification is still
required about whether they constitute legal norms or are rather guiding
principles, social and ethical guidelines for future legislation. The
following explanation will be limited to the provisions of penal law, the
laws relating to the family, marriage and inheritance, and, in the final
section, the community’s constitutional law.

A. Penal Law
-
The Kitab-i Aqdas contains some provisions of penal law, but these
are expressed in a very general and abstract way, allowing for the later
specification of offenses. There is no legal definition of elements of an
offense. The details of penal laws were not specified by Baha-’u’lla-h.
Referring to the death penalty153 in cases of murder, homicide and arson,
the Universal House of Justice elucidated in a note to the Kita-b-i Aqdas:

> The various details of the law, such as degrees of offense, whether
> extenuating circumstances are to be taken into account, and which
> of the two prescribed punishments is to be the norm are left to the
> Universal House of Justice to decide in the light of prevailing
conditions when the law is to be in operation.154

Thus, given the rather abstract nature of the holy text, a certain
vagueness is undoubtedly intentional and serves the flexibility of divine
law.

The provisions of the Kita-b-i Aqdas are fundamental norms for a
future system of penal law, but are also parameters for moral order. It
goes without saying that the “Book of God” establishes a value system

151. An example of such a clear norm is the permission to take interest (vgl. Tablets 8: 74, 77-
78) in contrast to Mosaic and Qur’a-nic law (cf. Exod 25: 36-37; Deut 23: 20ff; Qur’a-n 3: 130; 2:
275ff; 30: 39).

152. This is discussed in my forthcoming Introduction to Baha-’i- Ethics (forthcoming George
Ronald Publisher 2005).

> 153. In these cases “life-imprisonment [ . . .] would be permissible” (Kita-b-i-Aqdas 62).
154. Note 85.

of its own155—“God doth not tread in their ways”156—which “is not
limited by the standards of the people”157 and constitutes, as the Baha-’i-s
believe, the critical norm of all human law. This fundamental truth has
been repeatedly and insistently expressed in the scripture:

> Great is the blessedness of him who hath in this Day cast away the
> things current amongst men and hath clung unto that which is
> ordained by God158 . . . . Cast away the things current amongst
> men and take fast hold on that whereunto ye are bidden by virtue
of the Will of the Ordainer, the Ancient of Days159 . . . .

Hence Baha-’u’lla-h’s admonition:
> Weigh not the Book of God with such standards and sciences as
> are current amongst you, for the Book itself is the unerring
> Balance established amongst men. In this most perfect Balance
> whatsoever the peoples and kindreds of the earth possess must be
> weighed, while the measure of its weight should be tested
> according to its own standard, did ye but know it.160

The book contains the divine law for the whole of humanity. In some
respects, it therefore conflicts with the moral values currently dominant
in Europe: it is less individualistic161 and more concerned with the
common good. This is most clearly evident in positions relating to
sexual and to legal ethics. Thus, the idea that the individual can
determine his own sexual orientation is incompatible with Baha-’u’lla-h’s
normative image of the human being. Sexual intercourse is reserved for
(heterosexual!) marriage. Sexual activity before or outside marriage is a
violation of the virtue of chastity,162 pre-marital and extra-marital sex is
(as in Islam) zina-’;163 it is stigmatized as immoral and legally penalized.
Homosexual practices (liwa-t., sih.a-q) are condemned by Baha-’u’lla-h as

161. The limits to individual freedom are not determined only by the rights of others but also
by the divine Law, which protects the individual from self-abasement, “depravity and
wickedness.” (Kita-b-i Aqdas 123). Even Art. 2 of the German Constitution (Grundgesetz
=Constitution, Basic Law) refers not only to the rights of others and adherence to the
constitutional order as limits to freedom, but also to the “moral law.” Whereas this was intended
by the composers of the Constitution as a given, objective entity and was also interpreted as such
in the past by the Supreme Federal Court (cf. BGHSt 6, 46ff), it is understood today to mean only
“the moral consciousness of people in general,” and this is something relative, because it is in
constant flux (Dreier (ed.), Grundgesetz. Kommentar, art. 2 I, marg. no. 44). On this subject as a
whole, see Schaefer, Die Freiheit 25ff.

163. Kita-b-i Aqdas 19, 49, Note 77.

immoral, even “satanic.”164 Pederasty is regarded as particularly
contemptible.165 The concept that “ethical minorities” might be placed
under legal protection, such as providing for de facto equality between
long-term homosexual partnerships and marriage, is incompatible with
these positions.

Values that differ from those that are currently dominant are also
evident in the penal law: the idea of retaliation as one of the purposes of
punishment and the legitimization of the death penalty in cases of
murder and serious cases of arson166 usually meet with disapproval and
suspicion in Europe, where this purpose of punishment is denounced as
an expression of subliminal feelings of hatred and revenge, and where
the death penalty is regarded as a barbaric relic of pre-modern times and
its abolition celebrated as a milestone on the path to the progressive
humanization of society.167

164. Quoted in a letter from the Universal House of Justice to the National Spiritual Assembly
of the Baha-’i-s in the United States, dated 11th Sept. 1995.

> 165. Kita-b-i Aqdas 107.
> 166. See below in the text accompanying notes 193-227.

167. This raises the question of the Baha-’i-’s attitude to the European Enlightenment, which
can be answered as follows: Baha-’u’lla-h’s sexual ethics correspond to the basic tenets of the other
Abrahamic religions, and also of Buddhism, though it avoids the extreme positions represented by
zealots who regard the physical body as an enemy to be vanquished and suppressed, and who
therefore see the state of voluntary celibacy and virginity as superior to that of marriage (such as
Cyprian, Tertullian, Hieronymus, Augustine and others, with reference to I Cor 7: 1ff). Chastity
does not amount to a defamation of human sexuality, its aim is not the suppression of the sexual
urge, but the disciplined use and control of the reproductive force and the human ability to express
love. (for further detail, see Schaefer, Imperishable Dominion, 175ff).

Neither can the foundation of the penal law in the metaphysical principle of justice, as a
reaffirmation of the idea of expiation and retribution (Punitur quia peccatum est), be described as
a return to a pre-Enlightenment position. While it is true that most Enlightenment philosophers
emphasized the idea of crime prevention (Punitur ne peccetur) and demanded the abolition of
both torture and the death penalty (the great Italian jurist Cesare Beccaria, 1738-1794, was the
first who made this demand in his work Dei delitti e delle pene, 1764), Kant, who marked the
epitome of the European Enlightenment (and subsequently Hegel, too, Philosophy of Right, §§97-
102), were the most radical advocates of the principle of retribution. Kant mocked Beccaria’s
“sophistry and pettifoggry” and legitimatised the death penalty (Metaphysics of Morals. Doctrine
of Right, §49). This was also the position upheld by Catholic and Protestant theology until the
early 1960s (in LThK 1986, vol. 9, col. 1097, with reference to the dictum Punitur quia peccatum
est). Even the Catechism of the Catholic Church published in 1993 (no. 2266) justifies the death
penalty under certain circumstances.

Furthermore, the message of Baha-’u’lla-h can certainly be described as compatible with
“Enlightenment values” with regard to many of its principles and demands, such as the
unconditional dignity of every individual and the equality of all before the law, freedom of
conscience, thought and speech (cf. ‘Abdu’l-Baha-, Promulgation 197), the abolition of the clergy,
the democratic structure of the community, the preference for democratic forms of rule, the
rejection of absolutism, the tyranny of rulers, imperialism, colonialism, exploitation and religious
fanaticism, as well as the protection of religious, political and ethnic minorities. These are all
positions upheld by Enlightenment thinkers. The vision of a federal world commonwealth in a
peaceful global order corresponds to Kant’s conviction “that at last . . . the highest purpose of
nature, a universal cosmopolitan existence, will be realised as the matrix within which all the
original capacities of the human race may develop” (Idea for a Universal History with a

The Baha-’i- position derives from the basic political concept
according to which the common good and the security of the public has
to be balanced against the rights of the individual.168 Thus, strong
emphasis is placed on the “security and protection of men,”169 the
“common weal”170 and the “prosperity, wealth and tranquillity of the
people.”171 This different emphasis is also reflected in the provisions of
penal law, which are based on the metaphysical principle of justice:
“The structure of world stability and order hath been reared upon . . .
the twin pillars of reward and punishment.”172

Justice (‘adl) is the cardinal value of temporal power,173 justice, law
and order are the foundations on which Baha-’u’lla-h’s world order is
built. In his hierarchy of virtues justice (al-‘adlu wa’l-ins.a-f) is the
highest of worldly virtues.174 Although tension exists between justice on
the one hand, and love, mercy and compassion on the other hand, there
is no essential conflict between them: God is not only a God of love and
mercy (His mercy “hath preceded all creation”175 and “embraceth all
things”),176 but also a “God of justice”177 and of “wrath”178 who chastens,
punishes and revenges.179 As I formulated elsewhere: “In God the

Cosmopolitan Purpose, 1784, eighth proposition, p. 51), and that “the perpetual peace is no empty
idea but a task” that “comes steadily closer to its goal” (Perpetual Peace 391 (1795)). Kant’s
definition of the Enlightenment as “man’s emergence from his self-incurred immaturity” and his
maxim “sapere aude” (Horace)—”Have courage to use your own understanding!” (“An Answer
to the Question: ‘What is Enlightenment?’” 54)—is remarkably similar to Baha-’u’lla-h’s
commandment to seek the truth independently. He admonishes people “to see with their own eyes
and to hear with their own ears” (Kita-b-Iqa-n 176) and “know of thine own knowledge and not
through the knowledge of thy neighbour.” (Hidden Words, Arabic 2). That this is a fundamental
principle is evident from the many warnings against “vain imitation” (cf. Gleanings 75: 1; 84: 2;
Tablets 10: 23 etc.) and the implicit rejection of the Islamic principle of Taqli-d (SEI 562ff.; Halm,
Der schiitische Islam 118ff, 133ff; Momen, Shi’ih Islam 175). The “coming of age of the human
race” is a recurring theme in the revealed scripture (cf. Kita-b-i Aqdas 189; Gleanings 33: 2; Lawh.-
i Salma-n; ‘Abdu’l-Baha-, Selections 16: 5; Shoghi Effendi, World Order 165, 166f, 202, 205. On
this subject, see Saiedi, Logos and Civilization 311-313, 338-345, 356-360).

tension between love and justice is superseded in a paradoxical unity.”180

‘Abdu’l-Baha- discussed the two spheres (justice and love) at length,181

making clear that love, mercy and forgiveness belong to the realm of
interpersonal relationship and should determine the conduct of
individuals with one another, whereas justice (‘adl=iustitia legis et
distributiva) belongs to the realm of the social order. ‘Abdu’l-Baha-
objected to those who put—referring to the Sermon on the Mount and
God’s mercy—a one-sided emphasis on loving forgiveness: “As
forgiveness is one of the attributes of the Merciful One, so also justice is
one of the attributes of the Lord . . . . The tent of existence is upheld
upon the pillar of justice, and not upon forgiveness.”182

He leaves no doubt that society has the inalienable right “of self-
defence and of self-protection,”183 whereas the individual is morally
obliged to forgive the one who has committed an injustice against him
and to “return good for evil.”184 Love which is not simultaneously “just”
when applied in the social order, has degenerated, as the Swiss
theologian Emil Brunner aptly expressed, into “sentimentality” and has
been turned into “the poison, the solvent which destroys all just
institutions.”185 Perhaps nothing endangers the social order more than
this one-sided shift in emphasis to the secular value of “humaneness”
which has absorbed the Christian values love, mercy and compassion
and has been put into effect in the wrong place, namely in the
institutions of social order.186 The commandments of the Sermon on the
Mount are not directives for political action187 but are a radicalized ethic
for observance by the individual. It is as Thomas Aquinas put it: Justice
without love turns “into cruelty,” love devoid of justice is “the mother of
disintegration,”188 leading eventually to the breakdown of order. St
Augustine put it that way: “Remota itaque iustitia quid sunt regna nisi
magna latrocinia?”189

punishment for murder, homicide and arson: “Take ye hold of the
precepts of God with all your strength and power, and abandon the ways
of the ignorant.”190

And in the context with the punishment of theft, he warns
emphatically: “Beware lest, through compassion, ye neglect to carry out
the statutes of the religion of God; do that which hath been bidden you
by Him Who is compassionate and merciful.”191

This reference to the All-Merciful is an admonition against man’s
hubris in thinking himself more merciful than the God Himself of whom
it is said: “Of those who show forth mercy Thou art in truth the Most
Merciful.”192

The primary purposes of punishment are expiation and
retaliation,193 general deterrence and the protection of society; additional
aims are utilitarian purposes such as the reformation of the offender.194
Retributory punishment, or retaliation, is by no means, as often imputed,
vengeance, the expression of subliminal feelings of hatred and
aggression; rather, it is the essence and the demand of justice. The one-
sided orientation of western countries to the secular value of
humaneness (with the inherent attitudes of mercy and compassion) is not
shared.

The Kita-b-i Aqdas specifies the following as prohibited offenses:
premeditated killing (al-qatl=murder and homicide),195 pre-marital and
extramarital intercourse (zina-‘),196 theft (sariqa),197 arson,198 slave
trading,199 backbiting (al-ghayba), and calumny (al-iftira-),200 causing
bodily harm,201 unlawful entry,202 the carrying of weapons,203

190. Kita-b-i Aqdas 62. The “ignorant” (jahilu-n) are those who live in the ja-hili-yya, the “time
of ignorance,” those who are ignorant of God’s revelation. Ja-hili-yya is the name given to the state
of things in Arabia before the promulgation of Islam (see SEI, “Dja-hili-ya” 82). As to the “time of
ignorance” see Acts 17: 30.

191. Kita-b-i Aqdas 45. A similar admonition appears in the Qur’a-n (24:2) in connection with
the punishment of the adulterers: “And let not compassion keep you from carrying out the
sentence of God.”

10\. The tallionic character of criminal law in the Kita-b-i Aqdas is simply evident in the fact that
the law prescribes the death penalty for murder and arson.

194. The doctrine current in western societies, that the only acceptable legitimation for
punishment consists in the resocialization of the criminal, is not in accordance with the scripture.

mendicancy,204 cruelty to animals,205 consumption of intoxicating

gambling (maysir).208

The only offenses for which a punishment is specified are murder
and homicide, theft, pre-marital and extramarital intercourse and arson.
Murder and homicide, and also arson, are punishable by death or life
imprisonment.209 This penalty reflects the unique nature of every
individual as the image of God, the sanctity and inviolability of every
person’s life, as is expressed elsewhere: “What! Would ye kill him
whom God hath quickened . . . . Fear God, and lift not the hand of
injustice and oppression to destroy what He hath Himself raised up.”210

The destruction of life created in the image of God is not only the
worst possible violation of a legal good, but an offense against God’s
majesty and order. Therefore, the perpetrator must expiate his crime by
losing his life. This assessment of the value of human life is part of the
tradition of the Abrahamic religions: “One soul is equal in value to the
whole world,” says the Talmud,211 and the Qur’a-n states that:

> Therefore we prescribed for the Children of Israel that whoso slays
> a soul not to retaliate for a soul slain, nor for corruption done in
> the land, shall be as if he had slain mankind altogether; and whoso
> gives life to a soul shall be as if he had given life to mankind
altogether.212

prohibition with certain exceptions. The police and military services are certainly not bound by it,
nor does it apply to hunting or certain sports. The right to self-defense in emergencies is
recognized. The international peacekeeping force that is to be formed in the worldwide state must
also, of course, be armed (see Kita-b-i Aqdas Note 173).

212. 5: 35; see Mishna Sanhedr. IV, 5. Furthermore, it should be pointed out that the death
penalty on earth is also regarded in the Qur’a-n as having a metaphysical effect: “In retaliation
there is life for you, men possessed of minds.” (2: 175). The expiatory effect of the punishment
consists in the promise that in the after-life—provided the person who has been executed is
repentant—God “will impose no second penalty upon him, for divine justice would not allow
this.” (‘Abdu’l-Baha-, Selections 152). This amounts to a kind of transcendental Ne bis in idem
principle, as was also expressed in a traditional saying of the Prophet Muh. ammad according to
which God will not impose a second punishment on him who “has committed a sin and been
punished in this world” (this H.adi-th is listed in the traditional collection of Tirmi-dhi, Nawa-dir’ul
Us.u-l 138 (Constantinople n.d., reprinted by Dar S.adir publishers, Beirut n.d.).

should be repeated.213 The determination of the penalty for adultery
which is part of zina-’ rests with the House of Justice.214 In the case of
theft “exile and imprisonment are decreed for the thief” and “on the third
offence” his stigmatization is ordered: a mark shall be placed “upon his
brow so that identified he may not be accepted in the cities of God and
his countries.”215 All details such as the legal elements of theft and its
various degrees, the definition of the “third offence,” the nature of the
mark, how long it must be worn, on what conditions it may be removed,
as well as for which cases of qatl or arson the death penalty is to be
applied and for which cases life imprisonment, must be determined by
the supplementary legislation of the Universal House of Justice.216

Causing death through negligence (unintentional killing) does not
constitute a criminal offense, but creates an obligation to pay a sum of
money (diyya=blood money)217 to the family of the victim. Baha-’u’lla-h
has forbidden his people to engage in quarreling, rebellion and all forms
of violence.218 He abolished “the rule of the sword” (jiha-d for the
community’s own defense) on the first day of his prophetic ministry,219
for “it is better to be killed than kill.”220 The use of force is also
expressly forbidden in the proclamation of the Faith.221

The fact that backbiting, slander and calumny are mentioned in the
same verse directly alongside murder and homicide shows the high
value attached to personal honor as an object of legal protection. This
seems surprising in view of the way such offenses are dealt with in
modern penal law, as for instance in the German code of penal
procedure,222 where such offenses are matters of private prosecution.
Parallels to this legal and ethical judgment, which appears again
elsewhere in the scripture,223 can be found in Mosaic legal thought.224

apostasy is not a punishable offense. The loss of religious faith affects
the spiritual development of the individual in this world and the world to
come, but the believer is free to sever his connections with the faith and
withdraw from the community without stigma.227

B.     Family Law

1\.) Gender Equality

The whole of family law is based on the fundamental legal
principle that all human beings, without exception, are equal before the
law228 and that men and women have equal rights.229 The equal value of
both sexes before God was emphatically and repeatedly expressed in the
Qur’a-n,230 but in the historic religions equal rights for women as well as
men were promulgated for the first time in the Baha-’i- revelation.231

The equal status of both sexes before the law has been declared a
cardinal hermeneutic principle, and it is always applicable unless the
context explicitly states otherwise. It is a matter of principle that all
rights granted to men are, mutatis mutandis, valid for women, too.232
Equality is, however, not radically implemented. There are exceptions
to this principle, such as the special status of the first-born son in respect
of the inheritance law233 or the restriction of membership of the
Universal House of Justice to “men.”234 It should be stressed, however,

226. Ridda, literally “relapse” (into unbelief) is condemned in several places in the Qur’a-n (2:
109; 217; 3: 86-90, 100-101; 149: 47: 25), but punishment is left entirely to the judgment of God.
However, the Shari-‘a of all legal schools commands the death penalty (cf. the key word
“Murtadd” in EI).

subject as a whole cf. Schaefer, Glaubenswelt Islam 105ff.

> 231. On the subject of “Women and Baha-’i- Law,” see Walbridge, Sacred Acts 255ff.

232. For a more detailed treatment, see Schaefer, Towfigh, Gollmer, Making the Crooked
Straight 373ff. For example, there is a prohibition on a man marrying his step-mother (Kita-b-i
Aqdas 107) just as it is forbidden for a woman to marry her stepfather.

233. Cf. Kita-b-i Aqdas 25; Notes no. 44. In accordance with this provision, the residence
passes to the eldest son, who also bears responsibility for caring for his mother. This provision
reflects the ancient principle of primogeniture. On the apparent discrimination against female
heirs in the inheritance laws, see below §VI, 3 (last paragraph).

234. In the sacred texts, mention is made of the “men (rija-l) of God’s House of Justice”
(Tablets 3: 24; 6: 34; Kita-b-i Aqdas 52). In the execution of their teaching office, ‘Abdu’l-Baha-
and Shoghi Effendi have interpreted the term rija-l literally (cf. Selections 38: 3, 4). Exegetic
attempts to avoid this consequence are therefore doomed to fail. No reasons are given for
excluding women. For discussion of why this might be, see Khan, Advancement of Women 128ff.

that women have access to all other positions of office, whether elected
or appointed. There are, on the other hand, exceptions to the principle of
gender equality that are to the benefit of women, such as the dowry,
which the bridegroom is obliged to present to the bride prior to
marriage,235 or the educational privilege granted to girls: if a family
cannot afford to educate all the children then “daughters receive
preference over sons as mothers are the first educators of the next
generation.”236 This is a principle that has far-reaching implications and
is nothing short of revolutionary.

2\.) Marriage

Monogamous marriage237 (nika-h.) is a “divine creation”238 for men
and women. Matrimony—“a fortress for well-being and salvation”239—
has been “prescribed:”240 “God hath prescribed matrimony unto you

. . . . Enter into wedlock, o people, that ye may bring forth one who will
make mention of Me amid My servants.”241

The primary, although certainly not the only purpose of marriage,
then, is procreation: the production of offspring to secure the continuity
of the generations. The procreation of offspring serves man’s cultural
mission on earth: “All men have been created to carry forward an ever-
advancing civilisation.”242 From this, and from the explicit mention of
man and woman, it is clear that marriage is only intended as a bond
between heterosexual partners.243 The law prescribing marriage is,
however, not binding,244 so that it is neither a commandment with the

Referring to the fact that a number of women have been appointed to the highest-ranking position
of “Hand of the Cause of God” (see below §VII, 3b), the Universal House of Justice has
emphasized that this rule is not to be regarded as expressing any essential superiority of men over
women. That the principle of gender equality is adhered to in the elections to the national bodies
is illustrated by the current composition of the National Spiritual Assembly of the Baha-’i-s in
Germany, of whose nine members three at present are women, including the chairperson. At each
of the last three International Congresses for the election of the Universal House of Justice (1988,
1993, 1998) the Congress was chaired by a woman.

Meditations 181: 1).

force of law nor a moral obligation. It is the sovereign choice of each
individual whether to marry or not.245 The “prescription” of wedlock,
which is in fact only a recommendation, makes it emphatically clear that
marriage is a divinely favored institution and is desirable. The advice
set out in the form of a law is an extremely emphatic admonition against
the anti-marriage tendencies of the past,246 a unambiguous clarification
of the fact that marriage is not a concession to the sinfulness of the
flesh,247 nor a place of refuge from “fornication”248 and is therefore not a
“hospital for the infirm,”249 and no “remedium peccati.” Voluntary
celibacy and virginity do not have a superior moral status in Baha-’i-
ethics.250

The legal basis of marriage is the mutual consent of the marriage
partners; it is a civil-law contract that comes into being through “the
consent of both parties.”251 It is based on the pre-condition that the
marriage partners have reached marriageable age, which is the case upon
reaching the age of fifteen.252 The choice of partner is thus exclusively a
matter for the couple themselves, but consent must be given by all living
parents,253 regardless of whether they are still married or whether they
are Baha-’i-s. Whereas most of the laws of Baha-’u’lla-h are apodictic, in
this case a ratio legis is given: this pre-condition is intended to
strengthen family bonds, promote “love, unity and harmony” and banish
“enmity and rancour.”254 There are, however, limits to the parental right
of consent, such as in cases of parental incapacity.255

250. Monasticism and asceticism (al-riyad.a-tu’sh-sha-qqa)—“Practices as are sprung from the
loins of idle fancy or are begotten of the womb of superstition”—have been forbidden by
Baha-’u’lla-h (Tablets 6: 37; Kita-b-i Aqdas 36; Note 61). The “pious deeds of the monks and
priests” will be remembered in the presence of God, but they should give up their life of seclusion
and “enter into wedlock, that they may bring forth one who will make mention of God.” (Tablets
3: 13; Epistle to the Son of the Wolf 84). For further detail, see Schaefer, The Imperishable
Dominion 176ff.).

255. These limits to the consent rule have not yet been regulated in law. However, the
Universal House of Justice has formulated a number of legal principles that are to be applied for
the present: consent is not required in cases of legal incapacity on the part of a parent, in cases of
excommunication as a Covenant breaker (see n. 416), or in cases where this right to grant consent
has been forfeited owing to incest or other sexual abuse (cf. letter from the Universal House of
Justice to a National Spiritual Assembly dated 26 Sept. 2000). The immanent limits of norms are
dealt with in a forthcoming publication by Gilan Tober, Ein ‘eindeutiger’ Wortlaut als

No legal impediment to marriage or marriage prohibition may
stand in the way of marriage. The only explicit prohibition in the divine
law is marriage to one’s stepmother256 or stepfather. Other prohibitions
against marrying relatives or impediments to marriage are left to be dealt
with in supplementary legislation.257 In Baha-’i- law there is no
impedimentum mixtae religionis, so that difference of religion is not an
impediment to marriage.258

The marriage cannot take place until the dowry (mahr)259 has been
presented to the bride by the groom. The marriage is concluded by
means of a formal act, the declaration of the will to marry at the
wedding.260 This declaration consists of the phrase, “We will all, verily,
abide by the Will of God,” which is spoken by each partner in turn. This
recourse to the divine will gives the conclusion of the contract its
religious dimension. The wedding ceremony is conducted by a person
appointed by the Spiritual Assembly concerned261 in the presence of two
witnesses.262 These individuals provide only “passive assistance”263 in
the conduct of the marriage ceremony. The marriage is valid for life,
subject to the right to divorce. There is no provision in Baha-’i- law for
the institution of temporary marriage (mut’a)264 permitted in Shi-‘ite law.

If one of the marriage partners is an adherent of another religion, it
is permissible to conduct a wedding ceremony according to the rites of

259. Mahr or dowry is an ancient legal institution found in many cultures and in many forms;
its purpose is to ensure the wife’s financial security. In old German law, it was understood to be a
pretium virginitatis. In the western legal systems, it has been abolished, but it is strongly rooted in
Islamic law. (cf. Qur’a-n 4: 4). Baha-’u’lla-h has altered this institution and subjected it to clear
limitations. Since the dowry has to be paid by the groom to the bride and not to her parents, it is
not a “bride price”; since it is not paid by the bride’s parents to the groom, it is not a “dowry” in
the traditional sense either. The sum to be paid is 19 Mithqa-l (=approx. 69,192 grams) of pure
gold or silver (depending on whether the groom lives in a city or in a village). The maximum
permissible sum is 95 Mithqa-l, and the recommended minimum sum is 19 Mithqa-l of silver (Kita-b-i
Aqdas Questions 26. See id. Notes 93-95, 78). Given this case, the dowry is hardly of any
relevance as far as maintenance is concerned; rather, it has the character of a symbolic act. On the
Middle Eastern unit of weight of Mithqa-l, see Kita-b-i Aqdas, glossary. The rule about the dowry
is not yet in force worldwide.

260. Thus, there are analogies to Islamic law (see Bergsträsser, Grundzüge 82) and to Catholic
matrimonial law: “Matrimonium facit partium consensus inter personas iure habiles legitime
manifestatus, qui nulla humana potestate suppleri valet” (can. 1057, §1 CIC).

263. That is, the marriage comes into being solely through the declared consent of both
partners—the recital of the marriage vow in front of representatives of the Spiritual Assembly—
not through any action performed by the latter.

that religion as well, but both weddings must take place on the same
day.265 Such a wedding must not involve a vow to bring up any children
resulting from the marriage in the other religion.266

3\.) Divorce

Marriage is intended as an eternal bond, a relationship of
“everlasting unity throughout all the worlds of God;”267 nevertheless,
divorce (at.-t.ala-q) is permissible, although it is strongly disapproved
of.268 The grounds for divorce must be “resentment or antipathy” (kurh
wa kudu-ra)269 between the marriage partners. Both partners270 can seek
divorce, but not until a “year of patience” (sanatu’l is.t.iba-r)271 has been
completed, that is, a year of separation during which husband and wife
live apart and sexual intercourse is not permitted.272 During this year
“the husband is obliged to provide for the financial support of his wife
and children, and the couple is urged to strive to reconcile their
differences.”273 If in the course of the year of patience a reconciliation
takes place between the husband and wife, but they subsequently
separate again, the year of patience must begin again.274 The
consummation of the marriage is only of legal relevance insofar as the
requirement regarding the year of patience need not be adhered to if a
request for divorce is made after the recitation of the marriage formula
and the payment of the dowry but “before the consummation of the
marriage.”275 In this case, the dowry need not be paid back.276 If the

266. “There is no objection to a Baha-’i- participating in a religious ceremony of the non-Baha-’i-
partner provided that the Baha-’i- does not undertake a vow contrary to Baha-’i- law, as, for
example, a vow to raise the children of the marriage in the Catholic faith. Furthermore, there must
be a Baha-’i- ceremony which may be performed before or after the other religious ceremony, but
on the same day.” (Universal House of Justice, letter to an individual believer, 9 Oct. 1975, in:

is divorce.” (quoted in Maulana Muh.ammad ‘Ali-, A Manual of H.adi-th 284, no. 1).

> 269. Kita-b-i Aqdas 68.

270. Verse 68, which regulates divorce, mentions only the desire of the husband for a divorce.

The principles discussed here, however, have always applied equally to the wife, if she was the
partner seeking divorce. (see Kita-b-i Aqdas, Note 100; on this subject, see Schaefer, Towfigh,
Gollmer, Making the Crooked Straight 373ff).

husband finds out after paying the dowry that his wife was not virgo
intacta, he can demand repayment of the dowry and the reimbursement
of costs.277 If virginity was an express condition of the marriage
agreement, non-fulfillment of this condition means that the marriage
contract is invalid, but it is regarded as especially commendable if the
husband chooses “to conceal and forgive the matter.”278 According to
the mutatis mutandis principle, this condition applies also to the
husband, if his claim to pre-marital chastity turns out to be untrue.279

The divorce is deemed valid eo ipso upon completion of the year of
patience: “When the period is ended divorce is effective.”280 The start
and end of this period must be officially certified. The duties of those
appointed to witness the couple’s adherence to the conditions of the year
of patience, who are mentioned in the text,281 are the responsibility of the
Spiritual Assemblies.282 If divorce is sought by the husband on the
grounds of proven adultery by the wife, she loses her entitlement to
maintenance during the year of patience.283 Again, this provision applies
equally to the husband.

In countries where a civil marriage ceremony is compulsory, Baha-’i-
law has only subsidiary validity. The year of patience must be observed
before the petition for divorce is submitted to the civil court. Thus, in
this case, the period of the year of patience is not a constituent part of
the divorce proceedings, but is instead only a pre-condition for the
divorce, which is effected by civil court decree.

In addition, the Kita-b-i Aqdas contains a number of regulations
whereby in certain cases a marriage is deemed to have ended ipso iure
after a period of waiting (tarabbus) if the husband does not return from a
journey and remains missing.284           As regards the institution of
engagement, the only regulations provide that it is forbidden before both
partners have reached marriageable age and that the period of
engagement must not exceed 95 days.285

texts286 and is confirmed in the recognition of the right to inherit
property. In contrast to Islamic law,287 the inheritance law set out in the
Kita-b-i Aqdas is based on the principle of unlimited freedom for the
testator.288 In cases of intestacy, inheritance rights are regulated in
accordance with a legal line of succession.

Arranging for the inheritance of one’s property is not only a
believer’s right; it is also a religious duty: “Unto everyone hath been
enjoined the writing of a will.”289 In the will, the believer should first
bear witness to his faith:

> The testator should head this document with the adornment of the
> Most Great Name [al-ism al-a’z.am],290 bear witness therein unto
> the oneness of God in the Dayspring of His Revelation, and make
> mention, as he may wish, of that which is praiseworthy, so that it
> may be a testimony for him in the kingdoms of Revelation and
> Creation and a treasure with his Lord, the Supreme Protector, the
Faithful.291

The testator can dispose of his possessions “as he may wish;”292 he
has “full jurisdiction over his property.”293 The decedent’s estate must be
used first to cover the funeral costs,294 then to settle any debts and finally to
pay H.uqu-qu’lla-h,295 provided the decedent has clearly expressed in his will
that he wants to pay them.296

286. “Beware lest ye encroach upon the substance of your neighbour.” (Gleanings 128: 9; 91:
3; 137: 3; see Kita-b-i Aqdas 47, Questions 17). Emphasis is placed on the social responsibility
that arises with ownership of property. People are called upon to donate their wealth to the poor,
but they should do so voluntarily and not as a result of legal obligation. Leveling by legal means
is rejected (‘Abdu’l-Baha-, Selections 227: 19), but the extremes of wealth and poverty should be
overcome through socially just legislation. (‘Abdu’l-Baha-, Promulgation 107, 181ff, 216ff,
238ff).

295. This is the plural of H.aqqu’lla-h (“the right of God”), a voluntary payment made
according to the conscience of the individual of nineteen per cent of any increase in wealth after
deduction of expenses. (cf. Kita-b-i Aqdas 97, 28; Questions 8, 9, 42, 44, 45, 69, 80, 90, 95, 102;
Note 125). The H.uqu-qu’lla-h payments to be made to the Universal House of Justice serve to
promote the Faith of God and to support humanitarian work. (Kita-b-i Aqdas Note 125; ‘Abdu’l-
Baha-, Will and Testament 1:27). Texts by Baha-’u’lla-h on this institution are to be found in
H.uqu-qu’lla-h: The Right of God, compiled by the Research Department of the Universal House of
Justice, Oakham, United Kingdom 1986. On this subject as a whole, cf. Schaefer, Towfigh,
Gollmer, Making the Crooked Straight 379ff.

296. This opinion is at variance with an opinion, published in H.uqu-qu’lla-h Newsletter no. 35.
The payment of the H.uqu-qu’lla-h is absolutely voluntary and, like prayer and fasting, a purely

The very detailed legal line of succession297 is intended for cases of
intestacy, so that it is only subsidiary and, it would seem, undesirable.
Since the writing of a will is obligatory, the sphere of application of the
legal succession is obviously not very wide.298 It can perhaps be
regarded as a model for the division of property in a will, insofar as

> a Baha-’i- is morally and conscientiously bound to always bear in
> mind, while writing his will, the necessity of upholding the
> principle of Baha-’u’lla-h regarding the social function of wealth,
> and the consequent necessity of avoiding its over-accumulation
> and concentration in a few individuals or groups of individuals.299

This is also indicated in the right of inheritance by the “Houses of
Justice”300 if there are no legal heirs.301

Legal succession is based on quotas or shares (as is also the case in
the estate laws of Islam).302 The decedent’s estate (al-mawa-ri-th) is

personal obligation of every believer. It is up to the individual to meet his obligation “in
accordance with his conscience.” There can be no substitution where the fulfillment of spiritual
obligations is concerned. This is obvious in the case of prayer and fasting, but the same principle
applies to the payment of H.uqu-qu’lla-h: “One believer cannot discharge the obligation of another
to pay the H.uqu-qu’lla-h” (Compilation, Supplement 10.1). For that reason, the Kita-b-i Aqdas
presupposes H.uqu-qu’lla-h to be due only if the deceased has expressed his wish—either in his
testament or in a private oral statement—that H.uqu-qu’lla-h should be paid. This result cannot be
escaped by recourse to verse 28 of the Kita-b-i Aqdas, which provides for the division of the estate
and makes sure that all legal obligations of the deceased (debts, expenses for funeral, burial, H.uqu-
qu’lla-h) have been settled before the estate is divided. Verse 38 is not the cause in law of
the H.uqu-qu’lla-h, nor is it the cause in law of the debts or of other expenses. If the deceased has
not left any debts, no debts have to be settled. If no legally claimable H.uqu-qu’lla-h exist, they need
not to be paid. If a Baha-’i- has made provisions regarding the H.uqu-qu’lla-h in his will by virtue of
his testamentary disposition, a legal claim arises upon his death. If, however, a Baha-’i- has not
made any provisions regarding the H.uqu-qu’lla-h, or explicitly stated that he does not want to pay
them, this has to be respected. Juristically, it is unimaginable that at the moment of death a
believer’s spiritual obligation (part of ‘iba-da-t) quasi ex nihilo transubstantiates into a legal claim
that can be demanded, as it has been suggested.

> 297. Kita-b-i Aqdas 20-29.

298. For this reason, Fazel has discussed the question of whether the legal line of succession
should be interpreted historically as only an ephemeral regulation for believers in Islamic states,
now that the Islamic inheritance law is no longer valid following the abrogation of the Islamic
Shari-‘a (Inheritance 71-75). Saiedi, by contrast, has presented considerable evidence that the
significance of the legal line of succession lies primarily in its religious symbolism. The
mathematical relations stemming from the Arabic Baya-n of the Ba-b easily permit it to be
interpreted as a coded, numerological reference to Baha-’u’lla-h as the bringer of salvation foretold
by the Ba-b (Logos and Civilization 271-274, 384-385). A passage in the texts in which ‘Abdu’l-
Baha- places strong emphasis on the individual’s obligation to make his own will would seem to
lend support to this interpretation: “The wisdom of this perspicuous and most mighty ordinances
is that no one should draw breath without a will . . . . The will . . . is the settler of every dispute,
and the course of ease for all, for in it the testator disposeth of his property in whatsoever manner
he desireth and how agreeable it is for the estate in its entirety to be disposed of in accordance
with the testator’s will and pleasure!” (quoted from Saiedi, id., 385).

divided into two thousand five hundred and twenty303 parts and shared
among seven categories of heirs,304 namely the children, spouse, father,
mother, brothers, sisters and teachers of the deceased.305 Persons who
are not Baha-’i-s are excluded from the legal line of succession.306 If the
decedent’s estate contains a residence,307 this passes exclusively to male
offspring, not female,308 namely to the eldest son.309 If there is no male
offspring, one third of the residence passes to the House of Justice.310

The separation of the residence from the rest of the decedent’s
estate and its allocation to the male offspring (and only secondarily to
female offspring)311 is—as already mentioned—an exception to the
principle of gender equality. With regard to the staggered allocation of
shares, the question arises as to whether the clearly disadvantaged

the numbers from one to nine. Nine is the numerical value of Baha-’.

305. The children receive one thousand and eighty parts of the heritage, the husband or wife
three hundred and ninety parts, the father three hundred and thirty parts, the mother two hundred
seventy parts, the brothers two hundred and ten parts, the sisters one hundred and fifty parts, the
teacher or teachers ninety parts (id. 20; Note 38; cf. the Synopsis, id., 153ff). If there are no
children, their share falls to the House of Justice for spending “on the orphaned and widowed, and
on whatsoever will bring benefit to the generality of the people.” (Kita-b-i Aqdas 21). If the
testator leaves children but heirs from the other categories do not exist, the children receive two
thirds of the heritage, and the rest falls to the House of Justice. (id. 22). If there are no heirs in any
of the categories, two thirds of the heritage goes to nephews and nieces of the testator; if there are
none, the same proportion goes to his uncles and aunts; if there are none of these either, then it is
transferred to their sons and daughters. (id. 23). The remaining third goes to the House of Justice.
(id.). If the testator leaves none of the above heirs, the entire heritage falls to the House of Justice.
(id. 24). For further details on the distribution of the heritage, see Kita-b-i Aqdas Questions 6. If
the son of the testator has died during the testator’s life, his share of the heritage goes to his
children (Kita-b-i Aqdas 26). If his daughter has already died, her share of the heritage is divided
among the seven categories of heirs. (id. Questions 54, Note 45). As regards the share due to the
“teacher,” this share is to be divided among the teachers, if there is more than one. If the teacher
has died, two thirds of his share goes to the children of the testator, the rest to the House of
Justice. (id. Questions 33). The inclusion of the “teacher” among the heirs is an expression of the
exceptional importance attached in Baha-’i- doctrine to education and thus also to the education
system. This provision is in need of legal specification. In view of the very complex nature of
urban society, the term “teacher” is probably to be interpreted as a synonym for the education
system.

306. Kita-b-i Aqdas Questions 34. For the probable reasons, see Saiedi, Logos and Civilization

310. As will be explained below, Baha-’u’lla-h has ordained two “Houses of Justice” in the Kita-b-i
Aqdas, the local (Kita-b-i Aqdas 30) and the international (“Universal House of Justice;” for
details, see below § VII, 3a). The specific type of this institution, which is generally referred to in
the texts only as the “House of Justice,” is usually evident from the context. According to
‘Abdu’l-Baha-, the passages in the Kita-b-i Aqdas concerning heritage law refer to the local
institution. (Kita-b-i Aqdas, Questions 42).

position of female relatives (mother and sisters) in comparison with their
male counterparts (father and brothers)312 is also an exception to the
principle of equality. If one assumes that the legal line of succession
applicable to the man is also to be applied to the woman according to the
mutatis mutandis principle, then it would appear feasible that, as
McGlinn has rather convincingly argued, the distribution of shares to
parents and siblings from the inheritance of a woman should be the
mirror image of that applicable to a man,313 resulting more or less in
“symmetrical equality between the sexes.”314

VII. THE CONSTITUTION OF THE COMMUNITY315

A. Spirit and Law
The Baha’i community is not a purely spiritual, charismatically
governed community; it has the character of a legally constituted
organism. The believers are united not only by a bond of faith and love,
but also by law. Thus, the community of faith is also a community of
law. In unambiguously documented form,316 Baha-’u’lla-h has given his
community its unchangeable legal form which is valid per se,317 while
‘Abdu’l-Baha- has merely set out this form in detail in his testament.
The institutionalization of the community, its organs and legal structures
is part of the “Lesser Covenant” that Baha-’u’lla-h has concluded with the
believers, which is therefore an integral component of the religion.318
This covenant revolves around ‘Abdu’l-Baha-, who is known as “the
Centre of the Covenant.”319 Hence, the process of the community’s legal
institutionalization which began during the life-time of ‘Abdu’l-Baha- is

> 312. Cf. id. 20; see Questions 54.

313. Thus, the mother would receive three hundred and thirty, the father two hundred and
seventy, the sisters two hundred and ten, and the brothers one hundred and fifty shares.

> 314. Some Considerations Relating to the Inheritance Laws of the Kita-b-i Aqdas 41.

315. This overview can provide no more than an outline of the order of the community.

Detailed discussion can be found in my 1957 doctoral thesis, Grundlagen, and in Schaefer, The
Imperishable Dominion 239-251. A fundamental work is Shoghi Effendi, World Order 140-157.

316. The Kita-b-i Aqdas and ‘Abdu’l-Baha-’s Will and Testament are “inseparable parts of one
complete unit” (Shoghi Effendi, World Order 4) and form the constitutional charter of the
community, so to speak. Referring to this, Shoghi Effendi states that for the first time in religious
history the law of the community has not been left in human hands but is an explicit component of
the revelation. (id., 19ff, 146ff).

> 317. Schaefer, Grundlagen 99ff.

318. This is the “mighty stronghold” (‘Abdu’l-Baha-, Will and Testament 1: 17), a “fortified
fortress of the Cause of God and the firm pillar of the religion of God.” (‘Abdu’l-Baha-, Tablets of
the Divine Plan 49). Faithfulness to the Covenant, obedience to God and the revealers of his
Word, corresponds in the “Lesser Covenant” to obedience to the divinely ordained order and its
institutions. (cf. below Section § VII, 4).

319. Cf. Kita-b-i Aqdas 121, 174; Tablets 15: 9; Shoghi Effendi, World Order 132.

“not an innovation imposed arbitrarily upon the Baha-’i-s of the world,”320
nor a “surrogate replacing the Holy Spirit,”321 but the expression of the
divine will to create order.322

The purpose of the order of the community is the protection of the
community from schism and sectarianism,323 the preservation of the
identity and integrity of the faith324 and the continued provision of divine
guidance.325 At the same time, the institutions are intended as
“channels”326 for this divine guidance.327 The founder’s binding of the
divine spirit to objective institutions328 excludes the possibility of any
kind of charismatic trends329 in the community: no one is permitted to
claim authority on the basis of apparent gifts of grace or pseudo-
prophetic inspiration. This does not mean that the divine spirit is not
capable of directly inspiring individuals. Prayer and meditation are of
great importance in community life. However, personal inspiration is no

Crooked Straight 762ff.

321. As Rudolf Sohm denoted the legally constituted Catholic church in his sensational work
(at that time) on church law (Kirchenrecht, vol. I,1). On this subject see my elucidations in
Schaefer, Towfigh, Gollmer, Making the Crooked Straight 145ff.

322. Nevertheless, there was protest against the introduction of legally constituted organs and
structures after the death of ‘Abdu’l-Baha- (1921). A small group of German dissidents, who
regarded ‘Abdu’l-Baha-’s testament as a forgery, rejected the legal incorporation of the community
and broke away from it (cf. Peter Smith, The Ba-bi- and Baha-’i- Religions 183ff). These events
were nothing more than a footnote in the history of the Faith (for details see Gollmer in Schaefer,
Towfigh, Gollmer, Making the Crooked Straight 674-776), but they were blown out of proportion
by church critics (Kurt Hutten, Seher, Grübler, Enthusiasten 305ff; Rainer Flasche, key word
“Baha-’i--Religion”, in Lexikon für Theologie und Kirche 1993) and by a renegade (F. Ficicchia,
Der Baha-’ismus—Religion der Zukunft? Geschichte, Lehre and Organisation in kritischer
Anfrage (Stuttgart 1981)) and were exploited in polemical fashion. Hutten, himself a
representative of a legally constituted church, saw the handful of dissidents who rejected the
institutions as the “true heirs” and regarded the legally constituted community as amounting to
renunciation of “the spiritual legacy of the Prophet,” as the start of what he called
“churchification.” (id. at 319). The picture of the community painted by Ficicchia is a mere
caricature. These arguments have been subjected to critical analysis. (Schaefer, Towfigh,
Gollmer, Making the Crooked Straight) and can now be regarded as outdated.

328. Rudolf Sohm’s hypothesis of the alleged incompatibility of spirit and law (“The spirit
‘bloweth where it listeth’” (John 3: 8; Kirchenrecht X, vol. 1) which is based on a spiritualist-
charismatic concept of religion and a purely positivist understanding of the concept of law, found
approval with the Swiss theologist Emil Brunner (Das Mißverständnis der Kirche (Stuttgart
1952)) and was later echoed in the sociology of religion (Gustav Mensching, Soziologie der
Religion 186 (Bonn 1949)). As far as the study of church law is concerned, this hypothesis can
now be considered outdated. In any case, with regard to the foundations of Baha-’i- law, it is
irrelevant (see Schaefer, Grundlagen 59f; Schaefer, Towfigh, Gollmer, Making the Crooked
Straight 142-149.)
329. Cf. Schaefer, Grundlagen 92ff.

basis for any claim to general validity because “we cannot clearly
distinguish between personal desire and [divine] guidance.”330 The
community is not a “pneumatic anarchy”331 or “pneumocracy.”332 These
principles find practical application in Baha-’i- law regarding community
structures, membership exclusion, and governing bodies.

B.     The “People of Baha-’”
The world community regards itself as the new people of God, “the
people of Baha-.’” It is not an amorphous mass, but rather a living
organism with a legally constituted hierarchical structure. The local and
national communities are not a formless assemblage of autonomous
associations, but divisional sections of a world community. This
accounts for the vertical structure of the elected institutions:

> The internal organisation of the community—in particular, the
> hierarchical integration of the individual communities in the
> overall world-wide community—ensures the unity of that world
> community and guarantees identity of doctrine and ethics, and the
> identity and continuity of the Law.333

However, it is important to understand that the legally structured form of
the Baha-’i- community does not embrace the traditional concept of a
priesthood.

1\.) Governing Structures

The “people of Baha-’” is a societas aequalis334 insofar as there is
no division of believers into clergy and lay people. There is neither a
priesthood (sacerdotium) nor are there ministers. All believers have the
same rights, and no one has authority over anyone else. Binding
authority is the exclusive prerogative of the elected organs. This
abolition of the clergy335 correlates with the prohibition of pulpits336 and

331. Sohm, Wesen und Ursprung des Katholizismus 61. These are the terms he uses for the
early church, which was not guided by legally constituted organs and structures, but by the Holy
Spirit alone. The word “pneumatic,” which is frequently used in this paper, is a theological term
derived from the Greek pneuma (lat. spiritus), spirit, i.e., the Holy Ghost. It occurs frequently in
the New Testament especially in the gospels of St. Luke and in the letters of St. Paul (cf.
“Pneuma”, in LThK 8: 568-576).

name, there am I in the midst of them” (Matt 18: 20) and “The wind bloweth where it listesth”

hence also of preaching in the Houses of Worship, as well as the
forbidding of the kissing of hands, prostration before other people, and
similar forms of behavior as signs of reverence and submission to
religious authority.337

Since there is no administration of sacraments in the Baha-’i- Faith,
and thus no objectification of grace, the community of the faithful have
no need of a special rank of believers with authority338 to confer divine
grace ex opere operato. Baha-’u’lla-h has expressly forbidden the
confession of sins before human beings.339 Therefore, there is also no
forum internum sacramentale: the sphere of conscience is an
unlegislated area.340 Because there is nobody with authority to confer
divine grace, the community cannot be described as a “sacramental
steward of grace”341 and its character is not that of a “church.”342
Moreover, Baha-’u’lla-h has rejected claims to authority resulting from
alleged esoteric knowledge:343 “. . . he who layeth claim to inner
knowledge, and still deeper knowledge concealed within this
knowledge. What thou dost possess is naught but husks which We have
left to thee as bones are left to dogs.”344

Neither is proclamation of the doctrines of the Faith (tabli-gh) reserved
for a specific rank of believers. The entire community is a lay apostolate;
every believer is called upon to pass on the message of Baha-’u’lla-h.345
Everyone is free to teach the Faith,346 and the believer has an inviolable
right to his own understanding of the scripture, provided the scripture
remains the binding frame of reference for all interpretation. Since a

342. The community lacks one of the two constitutive elements of all churches. In terms of
church law, there is “administration of the Word” but no “administration of sacraments.” For
details, see Schaefer, Grundlagen 114-120; id.; The Baha-’i- Faith: Sect or Religion? 10ff.
Moreover, I regard it as terminologically incorrect to speak of a “Baha-’i- church” or to call the
legal incorporation of the community as prescribed by the founder “churchification.” (see
Schaefer, Grundlagen 84ff).

truth accounted among the heathen.”

345. Some of the many passages referring to this are Gleanings 128: 10; 154: 2; 157: 1-2; 158;
161: 2; Tablets 2: 12; 3: 26; 6: 3; 5: 17; 6: 3; 7: 5; 13: 5.

monopoly on authoritative interpretation was invested in the teaching
office (‘Abdu’l-Baha- and Shoghi Effendi), no believer is entitled to
claim authority for his opinions on matters of doctrine.

Finally, the development of the law is also not entrusted to a
specific rank of believers.347 It is true that the “learned in Baha-’” (al-
’ulama-‘ fi’l-Baha-’) are praised in the Kita-b-i Aqdas. These scholars
certainly play an important role in the analytical and systematic study of
the theological and philosophical aspects of doctrine, as well as in the
development of Baha-’i- jurisprudence,348 and hence also in the
proclamation of the Faith. However, this does not make them a kind of
“clergy,” because—unlike in Islam—their deductions are not
authoritative.349 The same applies to the members of the Continental
Boards of Counsellors,350 whose function, as the name implies, is
entirely advisory.

2\.) Membership

As one might expect given this democratic concept of a religious
community, conferred membership is based on human volition. One
becomes a Baha-’i- through accepting the message of Baha-’u’lla-h,
whether this occurs as a consequence of a personally motivated search
or of parental education. Baha-’i-s are not born into the community,
rather it is every person’s free decision to apply for membership. One
becomes a member of the community of Baha-’u’lla-h voluntarily,
through personal choice. The principle of individual, independent
search for truth by itself rules out coerced membership.

There is neither an initiation nor a ritual (as baptism in
Christianity) to which an initiate is subjected, nor is there an
examination (examen rigorosum)351 of his or her morality. The Baha-’i-
community does not see itself as an elitist group. It is expected that
every believer will live according to the teachings and commandments

347. An example are the Mujtahidu-n in Shi-‘a Islam. The Us.u-li- school divides the community
into the Mujtahidu-n and the Muqallidu-n. The Mujtahidu-n are the small circle of scholars who are
appointed to determine what is legal (ijtiha-d), whereas the rest of the community is obliged to
exercise taqli-d, that is, to follow a Mujtahid (cf. Halm, Der schiitische Islam 113-120; Momen,
Shi‘ih Islam 175ff, 185ff, 223ff).

348. Without their work, a systematic legislative procedure would be impossible. This is
probably what is meant when ‘Abdu’l-Baha- says that “the focal centre . . . of the legislative is the
learned [‘a-lim]” (Secret of Divine Civilization 37). The “learned” means those skilled in Baha-’i-
jurisprudence.

349. This interpretation excludes the possibility of the model of “rule by experts in religious
law” (Wila-yat al-faqi-h, see Halm, Der schiitische Islam 153ff), as set out in the Constitution of the
Islamic Republic of Iran.

of Baha-’u’lla-h, adopt spiritual qualities and virtues and strive for
perfection; but no one is regarded to give account for his prior life, no
one other than God has the right to pass judgment on the morality of
another one.

As the membership of a Baha-’i- is based on volition and not as
church membership on a sacramental act,352 every believer who has lost
his faith has the right to leave the community without any form of
stigmatization, for God does not compel the soul to become spiritual; the
exercise of the free human will is necessary.353 Man has liberty also
before God: “Whosoever desireth, let him turn aside from this counsel,
and whosoever desireth, let him choose the path to his Lord”354—a
concept that runs as a leitmotif throughout Baha-’u’lla-h’s work.355 Thus,
anyone who renounces “falls into the same category as any nonbeliever
and incures no blame.”356

3\.) The Law of Excommunication357

Even though involved choice is key to the Baha-’i- Faith, it is
possible for a member to be excluded from the community against his
will in limited circumstances. Wherever people join together and form
an association, rules are adopted to prevent constant damage being
inflicted by disloyal members. This practice is not different with
religious communities, where the danger of factional divisions and false
claims to authority is greater than elsewhere. As pointed out
elsewhere,358 the order of the community is an integral part of the
Covenant of God established between Baha-’u’lla-h and the believers.
Acknowledgement of this order is an indispensable element of Baha-’i-
doctrine.     The Covenant serves to preserve the unity of the
community,359 and is therefore “the mightiest stronghold,”360 the “firm

359. In the holy scriptures of Christianity and Islam the believers are admonished as well to
preserve the unity of the community. Jesus prayed in the “Pontifical prayer” for his disciples “that
they may be one” (John 17: 1, 21). In the Qur’a-n, where preservation of the unity of the
community and the danger posed by the “hypocrites” (al-muna-fiqu-n) to the existence of the umma
is a frequently recurring motif (cf. 2: 9; 3: 25; 33: 60; Su-ra 63 etc.), the believers are exhorted to
“Observe this faith, and be not divided into sects!” (42: 11; 3: 100). According to the Buddhist
canon the Buddha said, “a disturber of the Order burneth for an aeon in punishment and
perdition.” (Iti-Vuttaka §18).
360. ‘Abdu’l-Baha-, Will and Testament 1: 17.

pillar of the religion of God.”361 A loss of the unity would mean
religious division, which would inevitably lead to the splintering of the
creative power immanent in the divine revelation. Hence Baha-’u’lla-h
warns his followers: “Let not the means of order362 be made the cause of
confusion and the instrument of union an occasion for discord.”363 The
community would be at the mercy of human arbitrariness without certain
precautions against subversive attacks from within that threaten the
faith’s doctrinal unity and the unity of its adherents.

The protection against division and sectarianism in the Baha-’i-
community is the expulsion of a community member who threatens the
Covenant by attacking the divinely ordained order and its institutions.
Excommunication under Baha-’i- law differs from that in ecclesiastical
law, with regard to both its preconditions and to its effects. It is
applicable only in cases of covenant-breaking. The divine law does not
contain a legal definition of this offense, but from the scriptural
passages, it is clear that only exponents of subversion and sedition are
covenant-breakers (na-qid.u’l-mitha-q):364 they who “sow the seeds of
doubt in the hearts of men”365 and promote “discord” and bring about
“division.”366 ‘Abdu’l-Baha- calls them “mischief-makers” who are
“seeking leadership.”367 Because they do not declare their evil intentions
openly but instead “they secretly sow the seeds of suspicion”368—“sweet
in words, . . . but at heart a deadly poison”369—they are also referred
to as “hypocrites” (al-muna-fiqu-n).370 As the covenant-breaker has
struck with his axe at “the root of the Blessed Tree”371 the divine law
provides that covenant-breakers, along with all who continue to
associate with them, be cast out from the congregation of the people of
Baha-’. The believer who has been excommunicated is no longer a
member of the Baha-’i- community.372

372. According to Catholic theology baptism imparts a character indelebilis, an indestructible
spiritual quality by virtue of which a Christian is incorporated irrevocably into the organisation of
the church (which is the corpus Christi, cf. Eph 1: 28; 4: 12); with the result that, according to
church law, a Christian can never resign from the Church nor can his membership be totally

Covenant breaking is an offense sui generis, its closest similarity in
canon law being the concept of schism:373 only divisive activities,
sectarianism, and attacks on the authority of the institutions constitute
this offense. Expulsion from the community is a constitutive act by
means of a declaration; it cannot, by contrast to canon law, take place
automatically (ipso iure). Excommunication, an act of self-purification
on the part of the community, implies that contact is not permitted
between the believers and the covenant-breaker. A covenant-breaker is
to be avoided.374 Someone who has been excommunicated can be
readmitted to the community, and this has indeed occurred “whenever
the sincerity of the intensions were proven.”375

As with rules regarding membership and exclusion, Baha-’i- values
can be seen in the way in which the governance structures of the Baha-’i-
community were developed. The transfer of institutional legitimacy in
Baha-’ism came about through the establishment of the “twin
institutions,”377 the Universal House of Justice and the Guardianship,
and the subordinate institutions. The order of the community is thus
based on two pillars: the elected bodies (Buyu-tu’l-‘adl, “Houses of
Justice”) and those who hold positions of office through heredity or by
appointment.

1\.) Elected Bodies

Of the elected institutions, the local “House of Justice” (Baytu’l-
‘adl) and the international body responsible for the entire globe
(Baytu’l-‘adl-i a’z.am) are both ordained in the Kita-b-i Aqdas. As to the
local body verse 30 reads:

The Lord hath ordained that in every city a House of Justice be

rescinded: Semel christianus, semper christianus [“Once a Christian, forever a Christian”].
Therefore, according to Canon law, even after his excommunication, he remains a member of the
church. He loses his active rights, but his obligations (i.e., to pay church-tax) continue to exist.
Thus, the coercive nature of infant baptism is obvious. Resignation from the church became
possible through the secular state (cf. LThK, 6: 197-198). For a discussion of the differences
between Baha-’i- law and Canon law concerning the law of excommunication see my doctoral
thesis (Schaefer, Grundlagen 36ff).

The international body, the Universal House of Justice is not named in
the scripture of Baha-’u’lla-h and can only be deduced by reference to the
functions ascribed to it.379 The name “Universal House of Justice”
derives from ‘Abdu’l-Baha-.380

The intermediate body, the “subordinate” or “national” House of
Justice (Baytu’l ‘adl-i khus.u-s.-i or Baytu’l ‘adl-i milli-)381 was ordained by
‘Abdu’l-Baha-.382 In order to express the embryonic character of the
local and national “Houses,” they are at present called “Spiritual
Assemblies.”383 This is, as Shoghi Effendi indicated, a “temporary
appellation,” which “as the positions and aims of the Baha-’i- Faith are
better understood and more fully recognized, will gradually be
superseded by the permanent and appropriate designation of ‘House of
Justice.’”384

A Baha-’i- community can be established in any locality where at
least nine adult Baha-’i-s reside. On the first day of the festival of Rid.va-n385
they elect from among their number a “Spiritual Assembly” consisting
of nine persons, and this body then leads the community and represents
it in the outside world. The National Spiritual Assembly is elected
annually by delegates who have been elected in special regional
elections.386 The Universal House of Justice, which has its seat at the

value of the letters B and H) is nine.

respective countries. In Germany there are currently 57 delegates, in the United Kingdom 95, in

slopes of Mount Carmel in Haifa, is “universally elected”387 every five
years, i.e., by the assemblage of all the National Spiritual Assemblies,388
which represents the entire world community, the electors being not the
corporate bodies but the individual members of the assemblies.389 The
relationship between the leadership bodies at these three levels is
hierarchical, with the spheres of responsibility of each laid down in the
statutes.390

The world community has the same legal structures everywhere.

However, national statutes differ in their formulation in compliance with
the respective law of the country in question, insofar as this does not
conflict with the inalterable Law of God. Thus, for example, since the
German Baha-’i- community is not yet a public law corporation, its
institutions are currently organized in accordance with the law of
associations in compliance with the German civil code. Structural
problems that have arisen due to conflict between the divine law and the
principle of the autonomy of associations laid down in the German civil
code have been solved by the Supreme Federal Constitutional Court in
favor of the primacy of religious freedom.391

2\.) Hereditary and Appointed Bodies

The second pillar is also established in the Kita-b-i Aqdas as a result
of the designation of ‘Abdu’l-Baha- as Baha-’u’lla-h’s successor and as
head of the community.392 The office held by ‘Abdu’l-Baha-393 was
unique in the history of religion, in particular because he has a unique
role for believers: he is regarded as the “perfect Exemplar” and

persons.

National Spiritual Assembly of the Baha-’i-s in Germany of 1 July, 1997 and the Statutes of
Spiritual Assemblies, published in Schaefer (ed.), Die Verfassung der Baha-‘i--Gemeinde. The
Statutes of the Austrian Baha-‘i- community with an introduction by Anja Dustdar have been
published in Österreichisches Archiv für Recht and Religion 468-518, Issue 3 (1999).

391. In its decision of 4 Feb., 1991 (BVerfGN 83, 341 ff=NJW 1991, 2623) this court held that
in so far as the legal structures of the Baha-‘i- community are viewed as ius divinum, this has
priority over the laws on association in the German Civil Code (BGB), in accordance with the
constitutionally guaranteed right of “freedom of faith and conscience” (art. 4 of the German
Constitution). This applies, in particular, to the hierarchical structure of the community. Despite
the right of intervention on the part of super ordinate institutions, the local community has—
according to the Federal Constitutional Court—a sufficient degree of “self-determination and
independence.” On this subject as a whole cf. the review by Bernd Jean d’Heure, Ius divinum
oder Eintragung von Religionsgemeinschaften in das Vereinsregister?, in: JuS 830ff, Issue 10
(1992).

“stainless Mirror of His light,” as “the incarnation of every Baha-’i-
virtue.”394 His function as an infallible interpreter of the holy writ, i.e.,
his teaching authority as “Mubayyin” (=explainer) was institutionalized
and perpetuated by his testamentary appointment of Shoghi Effendi as
“Guardian of the Cause of God:”395 “He is the sign of God, the chosen
branch, the guardian of the Cause of God [Wali-u Amri’lla-h], . . . the
expounder of the word of God [Mubayyin-i Kita-b].”396 The function of
“perfect exemplar”, as Shoghi Effendi emphasizes,397 was not
transferred to the Guardianship, and the Guardian is not regarded sinless.

The office of Guardian398 was conceived in ‘Abdu’l-Baha-’s
testament as an ongoing institution. The hereditary principle and the
principle of lineal primogeniture determined the order of succession:
“. . . . and after him will succeed the first-born of his lineal
descendents.”399

However, since Shoghi Effendi died without issue in 1957, the
office of Guardian is now permanently vacant. The Universal House of
Justice has not perceived any possibility of appointing a successor.400
Owing to the permanent vacancy of the Guardianship, the community no
longer has an authoritative teaching office. Binding interpretation of the
scripture therefore ended with the death of Shoghi Effendi. Since the
“Hands of the Cause of God” (Aya-di- i-amru’lla-h)401—who, according to
the testament of ‘Abdu’l-Baha- were to have been subordinate to the
Guardian—could no longer be appointed and guided by him, the
Universal House of Justice created new institutions to fulfill most of the
functions of the “Hands” in 1968, these functions being primarily the
protection and proclamation of the Faith. These institutions are the

D.    Separation of Powers, Authority and Pneumatic403 Guidance
All jurisdictional powers invested in the elected bodies, whose
major functions are outlined in the Constitution of the Universal House
of Justice and those of the national and local Spiritual Assemblies. It is
evident from the functions ascribed to these institutions that the power
of jurisdiction covers the classical powers of the legislature, judiciary
and the executive.404 In this field, there is a distinction of powers, but
not a complete functional separation of the individual powers.405
Teaching authority,406 which embraces the authoritative interpretation of
the scripture and the protection of the faith, was invested in the
Guardian, who was also the head of the Faith. Thus, jurisdictional
power and teaching authority were separated.407 This principle of the
separation of powers (which in no wise implies the concept of “checks
and balances”)408 is strongly emphasized:

> The interpretation of the Guardian, functioning within his own
> sphere, is as authoritative and binding as the enactments of the
> International House of Justice, whose exclusive right and
> prerogative is to pronounce upon and deliver the final judgment on
> such laws and ordinances as Baha-’u’lla-h has not expressly
> revealed. Neither can, nor will ever, infringe upon the sacred and
> prescribed domain of the other. Neither will seek to curtail the
> specific and undoubted authority with which both have been
> divinely invested.409

Two Treatises on Government, 1690).

409. Shoghi Effendi, World Order 150; see Schaefer, Grundlagen 110ff. Since the office of
Guardian did not possess power of jurisdiction, the assertion that the testament provided him with
“dictatorial power” (Hutten, Seher, Grübler, Enthusiasten 318f (12th ed.)), or that he practiced a
“one-man dictatorship” (Flasche, Die Baha-’i--Religion 95) is false. On this subject as a whole, see
Schaefer, Towfigh, Gollmer, Making the Crooked Straight 154ff.

This principle is not altered by the fact that the office of Guardian
is vacant.410 Only the function of the Guardian as head of the world
community has been transferred to the Universal House of Justice.411

The two supreme institutions of the Baha-’i- community, the office
of the Guardian and of the Universal House of Justice are invested with
the highest degree of legal authority. Obedience to these institutions is
obligatory upon believers, and this obligation is strongly impressed upon
them: disobedience toward the Guardian or the Universal House of
Justice is disobedience toward God:

> Whoso obeyeth him not, neither obeyeth them, hath not obeyed
> God; whoso rebelleth against him and against them hath rebelled
> against God; whoso opposeth him hath opposed God; whoso
> contendeth with them hath contended with God; . . . whoso
> disputeth with him hath disputed with God; whoso denieth him
> hath denied God; whoso disbelieveth in him hath disbelieved in
> God; whoso deviateth, separateth himself and turneth aside from
> him hath in truth deviated, separated himself and turned aside from
God.412

Emphatic warnings are issued against rebellion and schism.413

Anyone who rebels against the divinely ordained order and attempts to
divide the community is warned, “the wrath of God and His vengeance
will be upon him . . . for he will have caused a breach in the true Faith
of God.”414 The unity of the community is ensured by means of the law
on excommunication previously described.415 Excommunication of a
believer is highly exceptional, applicable as previously noted only in
cases of “covenant-breaking.”416 It is a singular procedure which (in
contrast to canon law) never takes place ipso iure.

In addition to their legal authority, the two supreme decision-
making bodies, the Guardian and the Universal House of Justice, are
also invested with the charisma of infallibility (‘is.ma).417 Divine

410. Meinhold’s (Religionen 35) and Ficicchia’s (Baha-’ismus 363) statement that teaching
authority has been transferred to the Universal House of Justice is incorrect. On this subject cf.

417. For details on this term, see Schaefer, Towfigh, Gollmer, Making the Crooked Straight
166-194; Schaefer, Infallible Institutions?. ‘Abdu’l-Baha- distinguishes between essential
infallibility (al-‘is. matu’l-dha- tiya), which is an essential characteristic of the station of

guidance (huda-) did not cease at the end of the revelation (wah.y). It
continues in the guidance given to the community through the teaching
office of ‘Abdu’l-Baha- and the Guardian, and through the legislation of
the Universal House of Justice. This article of faith is not the result of
exegetic deductions but an explicit component of the sacred texts. The
scripture states regarding both institutions, that: “Whatsoever they418
decide is of God.”419

Of the Universal House of Justice, scripture states that:
> God will verily inspire them420 with whatsoever He willeth,421 . . .
> for he has ordained it as the source of all good and freed from all
> error422 . . . . That which this body, whether unanimously or by a
> majority doth carry, that is verily the Truth and the Purpose of God
> himself.423

By virtue of this charisma, the two supreme institutions are the
conveyors of divine salvation,424 but the charisma has internal
limitations. The Guardian425 is only infallible in the conduct of his
teaching office, i.e., in the interpretation of the scripture and revealed
doctrine, and in questions relating to the protection of the Faith.426 The
charisma is invested in the office, not in the person holding it. The
decisions427 on matters of doctrine and morals428 of the Guardian have
binding authority and, together with the writings of ‘Abdu’l-Baha-, they
are in a broad sense a depository of the Faith.

It has not yet been finally established where the pneumatic

Prophet (Baha- ’u’lla-h calls it the “Most Great Infallibility” (al-‘is.matu’l-kubra-, cf. Kita-b-i Aqdas

Answered Questions 45 4). Essential infallibility means immunity to error and sin, whereas
conferred infallibility means immunity to error, but not sinlessness.

427. These decisions are without doubt frequently dogmatic in character, but are not dogmatic
formulae defining what is to be believed, nor decrees ordering belief. Hence, they are not dogmas
in the narrow sense of canon law (cf. Schaefer, Grundlagen 133ff), nor are they scholarly
commentaries comparable with the Islamic tafa-si-r. Instead, they have the character of
explanations and clarifications of the revealed text.

guidance of the Universal House of Justice ends and which of its
functions it embraces—academic discourse on these questions has just
begun.429 Important reasons point to a restrictive interpretation,
suggesting that only legislative acts are covered by this charisma.430 The
Universal House of Justice is intended as a legislative body responsible
for supplementary legislation and thus for the further development of the
Baha-’i- legal system, whereas the ordinances concerning rituals (‘iba-da-t)431
are definitely regulated in the “Book;”432 the House cannot issue any
prescriptions concerning rituals or morals.433 The relevant passages in
the scripture434 where this charisma is mentioned constantly appeal to
the sacred text. The supreme “House of Justice” is obliged to regulate
that which has remained unregulated in the “Book;” it must issue
“ordinances and regulations that are not to be found in the explicit Holy
Text.”435 Hence, its primary task is that of legislation, i.e., the
establishment of universal abstract legal norms that—like the “Book”—
are binding upon the entire world community.

It is clear from this that the system intended by Baha-’u’lla-h is to
develop along a different path436 from that of the Halacha and Shari-‘a.
The Law of God, the ius divinum conveyed by Baha-’u’lla-h, is valid for a
long period of time (until the next divine revelation) and requires
supplementation and specification. As already discussed,437 the further
development of the law takes place not on the basis of casuistry, as in
Judaism and Islam, i.e., through authoritative interpretation of the sacred
texts, but rather by means of pneumatically guided legislation that is
capable of taking into account the conditions of a constantly changing
world. When the scripture provides that “Whatsoever they438 decide has

433. The norms of morality are scattered throughout Baha-’u’lla-h’s scripture. They are subject
to authoritative interpretation by the Guardian, but not to supplementary legislation. The moral
values constitute the eternal law, “revealed to the prophets of old” (Baha-’u’lla-h, The Hidden
Words, Preamble) that “does not change nor alter” (‘Abdu’l-Baha-, Some Answered Questions 11:
9). Baha-’u’lla-h’s reference to “the needs and requirements of the time” (Tablets 8:61) that have to
be solved by supplementary legislation of the Universal House of Justice clearly focuses on the
conditions of society which are in constant flux, whereas the human nature, the conditio humana,
is timeless and not influenced by external conditions. The realm of moral virtues is therefore
beyond supplementary legislation.

the same effect as the Text itself,”439 this equating of “decisions” of the
Universal House of Justice to the sacred text makes sense only if these
decisions do not relate to specific cases, but to the establishment of
general, abstract norms that, like the text, claim universal validity.

What is the point of “infallible” legislation,440 for which there is no
model in the history of religion?441 Owing to the pneumatic guidance
given to the legislator, established law—which would normally be ius
humanum—is raised to the rank of ius divinum and becomes ius divinum
supplementum,442 so to speak. Both categories taken together constitute
sacred law, which is complemented by profane law (ius humanum)
when the subordinate “Houses of Justice” subsequently carry out their
legislative functions.

As an emanation of the divine Will, the supplementary law would
be as unalterable as the divine law if ‘Abdu’l-Baha-’s testament did not
contain the clause stating that this type of law can be repealed and
amended “according to the exigencies of the time.”443 Since this process
enables social change to be taken into account, the sacred law is
protected from the danger of gradual petrification.444 So far, there have
been only sporadic legislative acts by the Universal House of Justice,
which was established in 1963.445             Time is not yet ripe for
supplementary legislation.

By contrast, the other decision-making institutions, the local and

440. When one refers to the making of laws, the term “infallible” has a different quality than
when one is referring to authoritative interpretation. A law that has been made in an “infallible”
way is not “true” but an outpouring of divine justice and thus absolutely appropriate to the social
conditions and requirements, and absolutely just. (see Schaefer, Grundlagen 174).

444. This problem of static law has become a problem in Islam. Antes speaks of the
“petrification of Islamic jurisprudence at the medieval stage.” (Ethik und Politik im Islam 65),
because since the third century the “gate of free research” (ba-b al-ijtiha-d) has been closed (cf.
Nagel, Die Festung des Glaubens 9). Thus, law fell into complete dependence on the authority of
medieval legal scholars, whose texts have been “declared primary texts and have been endowed
with a sacred status that is in many cases not lower than that of the primary text.” (Nasr Hamid
Abu Zaid, Islam und Politik 30). Any Muslim who rejects the interpretative monopoly of Islamic
orthodoxy is declared a heretic (takfi-r), as demonstrated by the Egyptian professor Nasr Hamid
Abu Zaid, who has found asylum in the Netherlands after having been forcibly divorced from his
wife and after professors of the Al-Azhar-University had published a resolution demanding his
execution as an apostate (murtadd) and heretic (ka-fi-r). On the whole subject, see Schaefer,

national “Houses of Justice,” do not share in the charisma of
infallibility.446 They are promised divine guidance, but only under
certain, legally unverifiable circumstances that have been defined by
‘Abdu’l-Baha-447 that cannot be legally verified: that the process of
consultation among the members be conducted in a spirit of absolute
purity, selflessness, detachment and devotion, love and harmony; and
that the assemblies must have opened themselves to the divine spirit and
“reflect the perfections of the Heavenly Kingdom.”448 Such high moral
demands, requiring an exceedingly high degree of self-discipline on the
part of each member of the consultative body, are not only difficult to
fulfill but also impossible to demonstrate. Thus, two categories of
divine guidance are observable in the scripture:

1.) A general divine guidance that is promised to all elected bodies
which is a relative one, because it depends on certain preconditions,
“prime-requisites for them that take counsel together”449 and

2.) The specific divine guidance conferred on the twin-pillars that is
an absolute one, because it is not made dependent on preconditions.
This absolute divine guidance is infallibility.

E.   Principles of the Electoral Law, Consultation and the Conduct of

Holders of Office
Because of the unique and important function of Baha-’i- legislation,
the method for selection of legislators is of utmost concern in Baha-’i-
law. The Kita-b-i Aqdas does not contain any provisions as to how the
“Houses of Justice” are to be “established.” However, the testament of
‘Abdu’l-Baha- grants the believers “universal suffrage”450 and prescribes
indirect elections to the Universal House of Justice. This body is elected
by all the national “Houses of Justice.”451 Taken together, they represent
the entire world community. Express passages suggest that these
elections should be held “after the manner of the customary elections in
Western countries such as those of England.”452 Hence, the Baha-’i-
institutions are elected democratically, i.e., by universal, equal, free and

446. This is already evident from the fact that their statutes and the Constitution of the
international “House of Justice” include stages of appeal by which wrong decisions of the local
and national bodies can be corrected. Ficicchia’s assertion to the contrary (Baha-’ismus 28, 161,
290, 371, 372, 374, 393, 413, 429) is erroneous (cf. Schaefer, Towfigh, Gollmer, Making the
Crooked Straight 166ff).

secret ballot. The system of electing the National Spiritual Assemblies
(election by delegates) was instituted by Shoghi Effendi.453

The Baha-’i- elections are to be conducted in a spirit of prayer. Each
elector is called upon to beseech the assistance and guidance of God and
“without the least trace of passion and prejudice, and irrespective of any
material consideration,”454 he should choose only those “whom prayer
and reflection have inspired him to uphold”455 and who have the
qualities of “unquestioned loyalty, of selfless devotion, of a well-trained
mind, of recognized ability and mature experience.”456 The result of the
election should be a manifestation of God’s guidance. This theocratic
element is safeguarded by the prohibition of the selection or proposal of
candidates, election agreements, electoral groups and any form of
campaigning or electioneering. Thus, it is intended that demagogic
practices, populism, competition, personal ambition and material
interests, which have always endangered the democratic system and
occasionally corrupt it,457 should be avoided.458

Baha-’i- consultation (mashwirat),459 is of outstanding importance
because Baha-’u’lla-h has raised it to the status of a fundamental principle
of human social interaction:

> The heaven of divine wisdom is illumined with the two luminaries
> of consultation and compassion. Take ye counsel together in all
> matters, inasmuch as consultation is the lamp of guidance which
> leadeth the way, and is the bestower of understanding460 . . . . Be
united in counsel, be one in thought.461

Baha-’i- consultation is a new type of discourse, qualitatively
different from all other forms of consultation (particularly that of
parliamentary debate) in both its method and the spirit in which it is
conducted. Saiedi points out that

> Baha-’i- consultation is selfless devotion to truth, to the universal
> interests of humanity, and to the will of God . . . . The centrality

Schaefer, Towfigh, Gollmer, Making the Crooked Straight 472 ff.

459. The Persian term is related to the Qur’a-nic term shu-ra- (cf. 42: 38), which has not been
endowed with a specific form in the Islamic legal system. It was only discovered in the political
sphere in the 19th century and has hardly been made use of for the development of democratic
structures (cf. EI, key word “shu-ra-“).

> 460. Tablets 11: 16; 7: 29.
461. Id. 9: 4.

> of its spiritual dimension becomes clear when we observe that in
> one tablet Baha-’u’lla-h has identified consultation as the means of
> the advent of reason [khirad] and defines reason as a heaven
whose sun and moon are forbearance and fear of God.462

In the administrative bodies of the Baha-’i- Faith, in particular,
consultation is not a mere technique, it has rather a religious, spiritual
and moral dimension.463 It should be characterized by “detachment from
all else save God”464 and be conducted in a spirit of “servitude to His
exalted Threshold.”465 Those engaged in it should practice the virtues of
moderation and courtesy, be open with regard to the result, and follow
the principle of freedom of opinion.466 A variety of opinions in the
community are, as already expressed in a H.adi-th467 attributed to the
Prophet Muh.ammad, a “blessing,” for the “shining spark of truth cometh
forth only after the clash of differing opinions”.468 Seen in this light,
consultation is the employment of collective reason. The use of
obstructive tactics, and the formation of factions and interest groups are
incompatible with this type of consultation and are therefore not
allowed.469

Over the years, Shoghi Effendi also gave a large number of
instructions and recommendations to guide the work of the Spiritual
Assemblies. Many of these set out fundamental principles of practice,
and some have been included in the statutes of the Spiritual Assemblies,
as for instance in Germany.470 Among these are warnings concerning
the dangers of centralism, and the equal dangers of excessive
decentralization,471 cautions against dictatorial behavior, the arbitrary
exercise of power, the spirit of secrecy, tendencies towards self-
glorification and presumptuousness, prejudice and passion. There are
also admonitions to observe humility, tolerance, courtesy, unity and
justice. The Assembly members should be like “shepherds:” “The
trusted ones of the Merciful among men.”472

F.  The Community’s Basic Structural Elements
Both Baha’u’lla-h and ‘Abdu’l-Baha- express a concept of the
community as an evolving organism. As it grows, its legal form will
continue to develop. The structural elements outlined here are, of
course, constitutive. An outstanding feature is the fact that, for the first
time in religious history, the development of a clergy is legally
prohibited in the sacred texts themselves. Baha-’i-s see this truly
revolutionary precaution as an expression of the “stage of maturity” into
which mankind has now advanced.473

According to Shoghi Effendi, the order of the community combines
elements “which are to be found in each of the three recognized forms of
secular government.”474 The monarchical element is no longer effective,
owing to the vacancy of the office of Guardian. The basic structure is
democratic, since all power of jurisdiction rests with the elected bodies
and because the principles of self-government, collegiality and
consultation are brought to bear.

However, the system is not a purely democratic one, because its
legitimacy derives not from the sovereignty of the community of
believers, the “people,” but ultimately from the sovereignty of God, and
because it contains a number of theocratic elements.475 The legally
constituted Baha-’i- community regards itself as a kind of “theocracy”476
in so far as God governs His people through the laws sent down by him,
and through the legal organs He has appointed and to whom He has
promised the assistance of the Holy Spirit in a certain defined sphere.
The theocratic element is also evident in Baha-’i- elections and in Baha-’i-
consultation. Through the combination of democratic and theocratic
elements and the absence of priestly functions and official bearers of
clerical office, a system has been created for which there is no historical
precedent and which, Baha-’i-s believe, is safeguarded against the danger
of autocratic developments.

476. Nota bene: this is not to be understood as a form of rule in which the state and religion are
united in the sense of the fundamentalist Islamic idea of H.akimiat Allah, but as one structural
element of the community among others.
