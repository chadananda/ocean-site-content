> **Abstract:** As Shoghi Effendi pointed out, "the Prophets of God do not teach the arts," which are "an expression of the people." However, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, Who Himself wrote a few poems in Persian and in Turkish, has left good guidance on the issue of poetry, and any aspiring poet or reader of poetry would benefit from becoming familiar with His words. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá mentions at least seven aspects of poetry: inspiration, beauty, eloquence, a versified language, novelty, expressivity, depth and loftiness of meanings. He moreover sets forth clear concepts on the purposes of poetry. The authors examine ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s words in the light of verses from His poems in Persian language.
