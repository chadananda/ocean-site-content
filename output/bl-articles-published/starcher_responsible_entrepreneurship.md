Responsible Entrepreneurship

Introduction
The explosive growth of interest in the role of business in society has focused on large companies
and multinationals. In so doing, entrepreneurs have been largely ignored. But this is beginning
to change. At its Lisbon Summit in March 2000, the European Union heads of state adopted the
strategic goal of becoming by 2010, ‘the most competitive and dynamic knowledge-based economy
in the world, capable of sustained economic growth with more and better jobs and greater social
cohesion.’ In July 2002, the European Commission presented a strategy to promote CSR entitled
Corporate Social Responsibility: A business contribution to sustainable development. One of the
principles in this strategy is attention to the needs and characteristics of SMEs. In other words, the
CSR concept, practices and instruments should be adapted to suit the specific situation of SMEs.
This is the context in which this paper has been developed. At the World Summit on Sustainable
Development in Johannesburg, it was noted that environmental and social performance of SMEs
is one of the major challenges in achieving progress towards sustainable development. As a result
the theme of Responsible Entrepreneurship is being increasingly promoted in recognition of the
potential for engaging more SMEs in socially and environmentally responsible business practices.

These notes summarize the conclusions of some research carried out by the European Bahaʼi Business
Forum (EBBF) on this theme. The first section defines ʻEntrepreneurshipʼ and ʻResponsibilityʼ, two
terms which are subject to varying interpretations and whose meaning tends to be elusive. At the
same time it emphasizes the values which underlie these two concepts. The second section discusses
SMEs and some significant segments which tend to be more responsible and thus probably more
responsive to actions intended to engage them further. Then a number of cases of responsible
practices are presented and some of the ways in which SMEs are being engaged in social and
environmental business practices are discussed. The fourth section presents a compelling business
case for responsible entrepreneurship. Section five discusses some of the ways that SMEs are being
engaged in responsible practices. Finally, some conclusions are drawn.

1\. DEFINING RESPONSIBLE ENTREPRENEURSHIP

In this first chapter, the two core themes of this paper, Entrepreneurship and Responsible, are
defined.

What is Entrepreneurship?

The term entrepreneurship is often associated with new start-ups. The term is also used loosely,
and in the author’s judgment wrongly, to cover all small and medium sized enterprises. Also,
entrepreneurs are often seen as solely motivated by profit. Such common beliefs ignore the essence
and real meaning of entrepreneurship. A brief history may help to clarify this misunderstanding.

The term “entrepreneur” originated in French economics as early as the 17th and 18th centuries1. In
French, it means someone who undertakes a significant project or activity. The French economist
most commonly credited with giving the term this particular meaning is Jean Baptiste Say who,
around the turn of the 19th century, put it this way, “The entrepreneur shifts economic resources
out of an area of lower and into an area of higher productivity and greater yield.” In other words,
entrepreneurs create value, and in this case economic value.

In the 20th century, it was Joseph Schumpeter who highlighted the importance of entrepreneurship
as innovation which drives the creative-destructive process of capitalism. Entrepreneurs became the
change agents in the economy by serving new markets or creating new ways of doing things.

Peter Drucker developed this focus on entrepreneurs as change agents2 “the entrepreneur always
searches for change, responds to it, and exploits it as an opportunity.” He found that starting a
business is neither necessary nor sufficient for entrepreneurship, nor does it require the profit
motive. Howard Stevenson, a leading theorist of entrepreneurship at the Harvard Business School,
added the role of mobilizer of resources and defined the heart of entrepreneurial management as ‘the
pursuit of opportunity without regard to resources currently controlled.”

All of these definitions support the conclusion that entrepreneurship is essentially about the creation
of either economic or social value or both. This distinction becomes clearer as we look at what the
entrepreneurial process involves:

> ÿ   Innovation, which is the heart of the process
> ÿ   Creation of economic and/or social value and wealth
> ÿ   The taking of uninsurable risks
> ÿ   The gathering of resources (human, financial and other)
> ÿ   Being market-driven

And the characteristics of an entrepreneur include:

> ÿ   Visionary
> ÿ   Intense personal commitment in pursuit of this vision
> ÿ   Hard worker
ÿ   Able to live with and cope with uncertainty and disappointments

> ÿ     Seeks excellence
> ÿ     Accepts and learns from failures
> ÿ     Pragmatic and action oriented, not perfectionist
> ÿ     Intolerant of authority
> ÿ     Believes strongly in himself or herself
> ÿ     Moral integrity and trustworthy, able to develop enduring relationships

Charles Handy, based on in-depth interviews with 29 entrepreneurs, underscored the defining
characteristic of entrepreneurs as passion: they were all passionate about their businesses. He
went on to say that profit is the by-product of success in the market place, not the reason for the
passion.3

What does “Responsible” mean?

Much of the research on SMEs seems to agree that “CSR” is not a meaningful term to use with
owner/managers of SMEs and entrepreneurs. The word “Corporate” turns them off immediately,
as does “ Social Responsibility.” Further the term “voluntary” which is an essential part of the
European Commission definition of CSR, is confusing in the context of SMEs, many of whose
managers are not even aware of many regulations and cannot distinguish between mandatory and
voluntary, especially for environmental regulations. They resist standards and formal codes, but
they care about their employees and communities and are quite customer and market-oriented.

Inevitably, SMEs display different levels of consciousness concerning social and environmental
responsibility. According to Peter Rosen, Commercial Director of Bovine, a medium sized printing
firm in the UK, “Rather than looking at it as a costly exercise, people should view ʻresponsibilityʼ
more as a path and begin by implementing a few simple, internal practices and broaden the
programme progressively.”

So one possible working definition of Responsible Entrepreneurship is:

“Responsible Entrepreneurship is a concept and a process whereby entrepreneurial
enterprises integrate social and environmental concerns in their business operations and in
their interactions with their stakeholders.”

So what drives entrepreneurs to act responsibly? There are five major drivers:

> ÿ The values of the owner/manager
> ÿ Cost savings (e.g. eco-efficiency)
ÿ Supply chain engagement and business customers’ requirements to reduce their own

reputational risks (codes, monitoring)
> ÿ Potential to increase revenue and attract new business/customers
> ÿ Attracting/retaining/motivating employees

Values

Values are the inspiration and underpinning of any discussion of social and environmental
responsibility. But which values? The Institute of Global Ethics (www.globalethics.org) has been
conducting focus groups around the world asking people to list the five values that they would like
to see over the door to a new school in their community. As David Grayson has written4 these five
values are remarkably similar across continents and cultures and are quite relevant as drivers of

behaviour of responsible entrepreneurs.

ÿ HONESTY: operating with transparency and integrity in all business dealings, trustworthy.

ÿ FAIRNESS: treating employees and suppliers as one would like to be treated, including

concern for providing meaningful work and good workplace practices and conditions.

ÿ RESPECT: respecting individuals, their human rights, and their contributions irrespective of

gender, race, faith, disability, age or sexual orientation.

ÿ RESPONSIBILITY: recognizing the need for sustainable development and acting

accordingly.

ÿ COMPASSION: sharing success with those less fortunate both internally within the company

and externally through involvement in the community.

These company values are rarely formalized by SMEs in written codes of conduct. Rather they are
living values practiced by owner-managers and/or founders.

Reputation

The extent to which these values are practiced has a very direct effect on a company’s reputation,
which can be defined as the overall esteem in which stakeholders hold a company. A company’s
reputation represents an emotional reaction – good or bad, weak or strong – of customers, employees,
investors, and the general public to its name. For example, The Body Shop, Ben & Jerry’s, Danone
and Johnson & Johnson might be said to have an excellent reputation whereas Enron now has a bad
reputation. There are many important benefits of having a good reputation: premium prices for its
products and services, lower prices from suppliers, ease in attracting the best talent, greater loyalty
from customers and employees, to name a few.

2\. SMALL AND MEDIUM SIZED ENTERPRISES (SMEs)

More often than not, entrepreneurs end up creating one or more small or medium sized enterprises
through which they exercise these characteristics and achieve their goals. Thus while executives
in larger organizations, whether private or public, may act as entrepreneurs, these notes focus on
SMEs.

SMEs are of overwhelming importance to the economy and employment. For example, in the
European Union countries, they number over 20 million; they represent 99% of all enterprises; they
provide 65 million jobs, or 66% of the total employment in the private sector, and perhaps 80% of
new jobs being created.

SMEs are a terribly diverse and heterogeneous group. Stereotypes of those who succeed in setting
up new businesses are extremely popular. In reality, certain generalities do apply in so far as the
motivation of entrepreneurs is concerned, e.g. they tend to be achievement oriented. But experience
shows that they come in all sorts of shapes, sizes, ages, levels of education, and the like. They do not
fit any standard mold and have very different goals.

While difficult, it is important to segment this very diverse universe. If we take size as a criteria,
they vary widely by size and range from the single proprietorship without any employees to micro
entrepreneurs, small and medium sized companies.

The European Union has defined SMEs by size groups as follows:

> Criteria                       Micro-enterprise               Small                           Medium
> Number of employees            < 10                           < 50                            < 250
Annual turnover                <€2m                           < ¤ 10 m                        <¤ 50 m

or
> Total balance sheet            <€ 2 m                         < ¤ 10 m                        < ¤ 43 m
> Independence                   ---                                             *                            *
* No more than 25% of the capital or voting rights held by one or more enterprises which are not themselves SMEs.

Another approach to segmentation is to identify categories of SMEs that tend to be more responsible
and that can be reached and engaged through various professional associations specific to each
sector. These companies are thought to be more responsive to appeals for further engagement. They
include:

> ÿ Women entrepreneurs: manage differently, growth may not be a primary goal.
ÿ Youth entrepreneurs: emerging with distinct social values, more environmentally

conscious.
ÿ Family-owned businesses: family values; employees all-important, family legacy often

shapes goals; driven by founder’s values.
ÿ Social entrepreneurs: almost by definition this segment is closely identified with responsible

entrepreneurship.

> ÿ Cooperatives: have a long tradition of social responsibility.
ÿ Part of a value chain (large customers may impose codes of conduct, suppliers may be

closely monitored)
> ÿ Micro entrepreneurs: of great significance for social and economic development.

ÿ Growth-oriented and fast growth enterprises: represent no more than 5 to 10% of SMEs;

> since seed capital and reputation are important, they adopt responsible practices more
> rapidly to enhance their reputation.

Several other important segments demonstrate values, cultures and management styles that are more
conducive to responsible business practices. For example, some research shows that businesses in
consumer-oriented industries, like retail, services, finance, real estate and insurance, show higher
levels of social responsibility (Lerner and Frycell, 1988).

Women Entrepreneurs

According to Global Entrepreneurship Monitor, women represent about one-third of entrepreneurs in
the twenty-nine countries they monitor. (www.gemconsortium.org) Are women entrepreneurs more
responsible than their male counterparts? Research is showing that feminine ways of managing are
different from those of men and lend themselves particularly well to start-ups and managing service
and knowledge based businesses. As we analyse female ways of managing we may also surmise that
they tend to be more responsible.

As developed in the EBBF publication, Women Entrepreneurs: Catalysts for Transformation
by Diane Chamberlin (www.ebbf.org), there is a considerable difference between male and
female owner-managers in the way they manage their businesses, in terms of managerial style,
in organizational structure and in the degree of delegation within the organizations. Do men and
women entrepreneurs think about and manage their enterprises differently? According to one study,
male and female entrepreneurs think similarly but their leadership styles differ. Entrepreneurs,
whether men or women, emphasize conceptual thinking in acquiring information.

Where gender differences do show up is in decision-making: men strongly emphasize logic or left-
brain thinking; women tend to balance logic with right brain thinking – that is, feelings, intuition,
relationships, sensitivity, and values.

Clear differences emerged also in management and leadership styles. The characteristics of their
styles reflect important differences in adult male and female development. Distinguishing traits of
male development are autonomy, independence, and competition; those of women are relations,
interdependence, and cooperation.

Particularly significant are women’s skills in and approach to negotiation. Men and women differ in
negotiating styles and objectives. Having been conditioned to compete and win in games and sports,
men approach negotiations with the objective of coming out best, that is, winning. Some believe that
male developmental characteristics and the male objective of winning lie at the root of many of the
problems in business and the world in general. Women, on the other hand, approach negotiations
with long-term, mutually beneficial and collaborative relationships in mind. They seek mutually
satisfactory, win-win outcomes that make for lasting relationships.

So, one might ask, how do women deal differently with various stakeholders? Are they more
“responsible?” And are they more successful than male entrepreneurs?

•   With employees: Do they offer more meaningful work? Do their enterprises have

> lower turnover, higher motivation, more creativity and innovation, greater loyalty,
> better quality?

> •   With suppliers: do they have longer relationships? Better service?
> •   With customers: greater customer satisfaction? Loyalty?
•   On the environment: are women more caring and ‘greener’? More open to eco-

efficiency measures? Lower costs?
•   In local communities: more active involvement? Encourage employees to

volunteer?
•   Owners and shareholders: better information? More dialogue?

There is very little research on these questions about the extent to which different characteristics
of women as leaders actually translate into different and better management of relationships with
stakeholders and, if so, whether they really make a difference. Ethical Corporation reports that in
one study, women owned businesses are more likely to emphasize social responsibility because they
tend to focus attention on education and the community.

In her handbook, The Seed Handbook: the feminine way to create business, Lynne Franks builds
upon some of the above characteristics and goes much further in encouraging a ‘feminine spirit in
business’. Just read some of the elements of the SEED manifesto:

> •     Constantly plant seeds as well as pick the blooms.
> •     Put values, including integrity, compassion, and love at the centre of the enterprise.
•     Remember the three R’s: respect for self, respect for others, responsibility for all my

actions.

> •     Keep humour and laughter as vital ingredients of the business plan.
> •     Welcome in mentors and mentor others in return.
> •     Give people more than they expect.

•     Listen as well as talk.

Looking ahead, it is quite likely that male entrepreneurs, especially in the services and knowledge-
based sectors, will adopt more feminine leadership styles and fewer command-and-control
approaches to management.

Youth Entrepreneurs

There are currently over 300 million unemployed and underemployed young people aged 18 to 30
years around the world. At least 20 per cent of these young people have the potential to become
entrepreneurs, yet less than 5 percent do. A number of organizations are involved in encouraging
and promoting youth entrepreneurship: Shell LiveWire, Youth Business International, The National
Foundation for Teaching Entrepreneurship (NFTE), Junior Achievement, International Youth
Foundation, International Reward Scheme, International Organization of Employers, and the
United Nations.

> Shell LiveWIRE: For the past 20 years this programme has been encouraging young people to start and develop their
> own business. It has enabled over 400,000 young people to consider becoming entrepreneurs. Following its success
> in the UK, similar schemes have been set up in twenty other countries with similar results. Of great importance
> for this article, it has been the first youth enterprise service to work with young people to introduce sustainable

> development to all aspects of their business planning and operation.

(www.shell-livewire.org/about/)

> Youth Business International: YBI is working in over twenty countries and has assisted over 50,000 young people
> in starting a business through a range of outreach services, including business mentoring, provision of start-up
> capital and the exchange of best practice among young entrepreneurs. The objective of YBI is to mobilize the global
> business community to help young people unable to find help elsewhere to become entrepreneurs and set up their
> own businesses. In the UK, YBI is helping 4,500 new start ups each year with its 7,700 mentors. Over 60% of YBI
> start ups in the UK survive into the third year compared with only 32% which borrow from banks in the UK. The
> distinguishing features of their approach are:

> •     Outreach - helping young people to prepare for self-employment
•     Business mentoring - mobilizing volunteer businesspeople to help young people through the first few years of their

new business
> •     Business support networks - providing specialized help and advice through a business support network
> •     Information and communication technology
> •     Flexible access to finance - ensuring start-up finance is accessible
•     Quality - exchange of best practice and performance criteria

(www.youth-business.org)

> The National Foundation for Teaching Entrepreneurship (NFTE) NFTE is an international, non-profit
> organization founded in 1987, with headquarters in New York. It has offices in the U.K., Belgium and Austria. It is an
> academic and life skills curriculum that teaches young people business start-up skills. The programme is supported
> by a full range of teacher and student materials, including a new internet based self-teaching programme, Biz Tech,
> developed and sponsored by Microsoft exclusively for the NFTE. NFTE places particular emphasis on reintegrating
> socially excluded and disaffected young people.

All of this activity to reduce youth unemployment is of course of great social significance.
Corporations and executives contributing time and financial support are clearly demonstrating
social responsibility. But, and this is a big but, it is not clear what, if anything, is being done in these
and other programmes to engage young entrepreneurs themselves in communities and in socially
and environmentally responsible actions?

Family owned businesses

Family-owned businesses (FOBs) are the foundation of the economies of many nations. The numbers
are large. According to one study, 75% of all firms worldwide are FOBs. There are 194,000 FOBs in
the Netherlands, or 55% of the total number of enterprises. Also, in numbers of employees, Dutch
FOBs employed 2.1 million or 45 percent. In Germany, 70% of all firms with over €1 million sales
are FOBs. In 80% of these, families own 100% of the companies. In Canada alone, FOBs generate
45% of the GNP, employ 50% of the labour force, and account for between 70 and 85% of the new
jobs created (Café, 2000). Turning to Italy, 45% of enterprises are controlled by families. Fiscal and
social laws seem to make it easier for family businesses to succeed in Italy, as do the habits and
culture. Two relevant quotes: “77% of Italians visit their mother at least twice a week” and “One
never knows in Italy where enterprise begins and family ends”.

A key issue is maintaining an appropriate balance in responsibility to the family and to the business.
“Founder centrality” is a common phenomenon: the founder often determines the managerial
mindset, motives, values, goals and attitudes that are central to the organization. The culture
of the enterprise is inexorably influenced by the personality, values, attitudes about people and
beliefs of the founding generation. He or she is thus the dominant influence concerning social and
environmental responsibility.

FOBs are companies in which there is both significant family ownership and significant family
involvement in management. Also a family business anticipates that leadership and control will be
passed to future generations. Significant ownership implies that a family owns all or a controlling

portion of the business and plays an active role in setting strategy and in operating the business on
a day-to-day basis. Family firms differ from non-family firms with respect to patterns of influence,
organizational climate, and organizational processes. Managers of FOBs use a more personal
approach, trust their employees more, and rely less on formal written policies. Also, family firms
are more stable and have a more conservative attitude towards the business, show slower growth
and participate less in global markets, and tend to have a longer-term commitment horizon. Some
research shows also that FOBs tend to stick to the values, visions and missions laid down by their
founders. Family values affect resource allocation priorities.

FOBs are often more conscious of survival, family harmony, and family employment opportunities
than they are of maximizing profitability and market position. Research has shown that a key
element of a strong family culture is a commitment to achieving some higher purpose. Family
members’ concerns about continuous involvement and leadership in local community affairs or
the family’s positive local community/societal visibility may be judged by some as important as
financial performance.

Founder centrality exists when members of top management always seek advice or approval from
the founder before making decisions of strategic importance. Identifying founders’ value systems is
very relevant to understanding the founders’ influence on their businesses. Values tend to be different
if there is a founder team rather than a single founder. In cases where there were several founders, or
a team, there is a prevalence of values that express a business orientation. In cases where there was
a single founder, family orientation and hard work are found to be dominant values.

Stable ownership is one of the advantages of FOBs, while restricted access to capital markets is
a disadvantage. In recent years, younger founders tend to aspire to build capital for their owners
(including themselves) more quickly than in the past, rather than building the traditional “family”
business to hand on to the next generation. This creates an erosion in family values and even
threatens the disappearance of traditional FOBs.

Family businesses enjoy several distinct advantages in the current climate of corporate mistrust:

1\. Stakeholders are increasingly focusing on trust and integrity. These advantages of FOBs include

reputation, organizational efficiency, greater trust, and longevity.

2\. Reputation: this advantage stems from generally better quality of life and environment in the

> workplace, stronger ethical rules and more social responsibility (Neubauer & Lank, 1998; Vries,
> 1996). In part this changed perception is a result of the perceived decline in integrity in publicly
> owned corporations.

3\. Longevity and pride: FOBs tend to have a longer-term focus due to their longer CEO tenure,

ownership, interests of board members, and compensation arrangements.

4\. Organizational efficiency: Family businesses have been shown to outperform non-family owned

> firms on a variety of financial measures (Brokaw, 1992; McConaugh, 1994). Also, in large
> companies, the recent ethical and legal failures are likely to add greater complexity, inefficiency,
> and bureaucracy to corporate governance.

5\. FOBs have a unique capacity for developing and sustaining trust among stakeholders. There are

> four unique perspectives: customers, business partners, employees, and shareholders and other
> suppliers of capital. Customers tend to believe that family businesses are more concerned with

> longevity than with immediate financial returns and focus more on issues of product quality,
> customer satisfaction, and service. Key customers may be likely to feel more confident dealing
> with family managers bearing the name of the business (Brokaw, 1992) Relationships that
> family businesses cultivate with suppliers, distributors and other partners tend to be stronger,
> more value laden, and have greater longevity (Lyman, 1991). Employees are also likely to trust
> family businesses to a greater extent than they are non-family firms. Family businesses are
> shown to pay higher wages to employees. (Goffee & Scase, 1985)

Social Entrepreneurs

The segment which is most closely aligned to the concepts of responsible entrepreneurship is that
of social entrepreneurship. Well-known social entrepreneurs such as Muhammed Yunus (Grameen
Bank), Anita Roddick (The Body Shop) and Bill Drayton (Ashoka) share the characteristics that
typify entrepreneurs in all walks of life. They excel at spotting unmet needs and mobilizing under-
utilised resources to meet these needs; they are driven and determined, ambitious and charismatic,
driven by a social mission rather than by the pursuit of profit or shareholder value. And they are very
innovative in developing new services and creating new organizations.

At the same time, they are social in several senses. Their output is social: they promote health,
welfare and well-being. Their core assets are forms of social capital: relationships, networks, trust
and co-operation, which in turn give them access to physical and financial capital. The organisations
they found are social, in the sense that they are usually not owned by shareholders and do not pursue
profit as their main objective.

The designation “social entrepreneurship” is relatively new and implies a blurring of boundaries
among the public, private and voluntary sectors5. In addition to innovative not-for-profit ventures,
social entrepreneurship can include business ventures with a dominant social mission, such as for-
profit community development banks, and hybrid organizations mixing not-for-profit and for-profit
elements, such as homeless shelters that start businesses to train and employ their residents.

Social entrepreneurs are one species in the genus entrepreneur. They are entrepreneurs with a social
mission, which means that adding social value is of greater importance than adding economic value
and creating wealth. The social mission is central and explicit. It is difficult to define as precisely as
business entrepreneurship, where market discipline helps to define the efficiency and effectiveness
with which resources are being utilized. The following definition emphasizes the crucial role social
entrepreneurs play as change agents in the social sector:

> ÿ     Adopt a mission to create and sustain social value (not just private value)
> ÿ     Recognize and relentlessly pursue new opportunities to serve that mission
> ÿ     Engage in a process of continuous innovation, adaptation, and learning
> ÿ     Act boldly without being limited by resources currently in hand
ÿ     Exhibit a heightened sense of accountability to the constituencies served and for the

outcomes created.

This is clearly an idealized definition, and social entrepreneurs will exemplify these characteristics
in different ways and to different degrees. A few examples will help to clarify this definition:

> Furniture Resource Centre in Liverpool is a hybrid which employs 150 people, often written off by other employers,
> to restore and resell second-hand furniture. The business sells a product and uses commercial practices but, in so
doing, creates a social good: better-trained, more confident and capable people.

> Centrica: a company which has developed an innovative and viable work placement scheme for disadvantaged people
> (disabled, long-term unemployed, lone parents). This is a partnership in the UK of business, charity and the public
> sector.

> GrameenPhone is a nationwide cellular network in Bangladesh to provide telephone access to all, including the
> rural poor, by adding cellular telephony to village-based micro-enterprise organized by the Grameen Bank. It is an
> initiative of a consortium of the Grameen Bank, Telenor, Marubeni Corporation and Genofone.

There are other definitions. A more restrictive one is “a viable business model with a social
purpose”.

Social enterprise is capturing the hearts of a new generation of MBA students both in Europe and in
North America. Several years ago, only one top graduate of INSEAD, the leading business school in
Europe, was interested in working in a social enterprise. This year, with trust and benevolence scarce
in the market place, more MBA students aim higher. Net Impact, a San Francisco based NGO which
arranges internships for MBA students in socially responsible companies, received 2,500 applicants
for 75 positions. Harvard Business School, the cradle for traditional business practices, now has a
distinct faculty department for Social Enterprise and teaches a number of courses in both the MBA
and executive education programs. The Social Enterprise Club is the largest and most active club
on the HBS campus; it arranged more than 50 internships last year, and special scholarships were
offered to students accepting full time employment with substantially lower salaries.

Social entrepreneurship can be expected to grow along with the increasing social needs and the
shifting in the boundaries between business, government and non profit organizations. Government
funds for public services are diminishing, businesses are recognizing that social and community
involvement make increasingly good business sense, and purely voluntary organizations are turning
more and more to for-profit services and products to finance their growth. It is not surprising then
that one finds an increasing number of partnerships among players of the different sectors and a need
for a common language and common approaches in order to seize the opportunities opening up.

Cooperatives

Cooperatives, mutuals and associations, being membership-led organisations, have a long tradition
in combining economic viability and social responsibility. The cooperative movement is quite large
and widespread. It consists of about 750,000 enterprises which employ nearly 800 million people,.
It is particularly active in the following sectors: agriculture, funeral homes, small merchants, florists,
pharmacies, consumer goods retailers. Cooperatives tend to add value in several areas: in marketing,
in purchasing, and in lobbying.

The very nature of the cooperative movement and the rationale for its existence would indicate
that member companies are favourably disposed to both socially and environmentally responsible
practices and more so than most SMEs. The movement began in 1844 in the UK with weavers who
sought to create more fair and just enterprises. They were and are very ethically based and exhibit a
high degree of cooperation. From the beginning they adopted sound environmental practices. Another
strong driver has always been the codes of conduct and the twenty-nine basic coop principles which
are followed worldwide. Coops tend to promote enlightened human resource policies and practices
such as employee ownership and profit sharing. They exhibit distinct customer orientation built
on trustworthiness, truth in advertising and promotion, quality and reliability, and service. Brand
reputation is all important among coops and this leads members to build trust within the cooperative
and with customers and communities. Community involvement is also strongly encouraged.

The reason for the above segmentation and descriptions of selected categories of entrepreneurs is to
encourage thinking about how they might become more engaged in social and environment practices
and which organizations specific to each segment might play a more active role in convincing them
to do this.

3\. RESPONSIBLE PRACTICES

Practically speaking, what are entrepreneurs doing to put these values into practice and to integrate
social and environmental concerns in their business operations? The following examples first
focus on the primary stakeholders for entrepreneurs: employees and customers and are followed by
examples of involvement in their communities and reducing environmental impact.

In the Workplace.

Responsible entrepreneurs are first and foremost good employers. They recognize the importance of
employee commitment and loyalty. Further, the fact that nearly one-half of SMEs are family-owned
businesses leads to treating all employees often as family members with great concern for retention
and reluctance to lay off employees. Numerous cases exist to illustrate what companies are doing to
improve the quality of life in the workplace and the business benefits of doing so.

> In a small factory making kettles in Tanzania, the investment of US$100 to install fans and enlarge windows so
> improved working conditions that production increased from 450 to 650 kettles a day. Daily profits increased by over
> $200.

Some of the practices are: improving the work/life balance, fostering the health and well-being of
employees, flexible time sharing, doing everything possible to avoid having to lay off employees,
and increasing diversity. A recent book6, describes practices in twelve specific companies that
enhance “spirit” in the workplace. These practices include the following:

ÿ Practicing servant-leadership; listening, lack of strong egos, balance between male and

female characteristics and ways of managing.

ÿ Applying the Golden Rule: “Do unto others as you would have them do unto you.” Showing

> respect for and caring for people whether they be employees, customers, distributors,
> suppliers or others. One notes a high degree of well-being and happiness and at the same
> time high levels of excellence and quality in all areas.

ÿ Having a greater purpose over and above short term profit and shareholder value, bringing out

virtues of generosity, compassion, doing the right thing, caring about the wider community.

ÿ Treating employees as assets to be developed, not costs to be reduced. Demonstrating a

commitment to ongoing growth and development of employees.

ÿ Valuing highly the development and maintenance of relationships.

ÿ Recognizing interdependence, practicing teamwork, encouraging collaboration.

ÿ Doing everything to avoid firing when business turns down, showing compassion for others

in the event of downsizing and layoffs.

ÿ Recognizing the importance of profit, educating employees on firm finances and business

plans and practicing profit sharing,

ÿ Not tolerating backbiting, gossip or blaming others. Admitting mistakes and learning from

them.

ÿ Sacred space – creating a work environment that impacts people’s well-being and

effectiveness. Appreciating beauty.

ÿ Taking measures to counter ‘workaholism’ and practicing work-life balance by recruiting

> people with breadth of interests, encouraging community involvement, setting a good
> example, flex-time and family friendly policies.

ÿ Creating a sense of family or community within the enterprise, having long standing strong

relationships internally and externally.

ÿ Showing appreciation of people’s individuality, building on strengths, positive

encouragement.

ÿ Welcoming diversity in the workforce, recognizing its importance for innovation.

> Happy Computers, a London based consultancy, has grown 20% during the past two years in a declining market.

In the Marketplace.

Building and maintaining reputation is all-important to business success in many small businesses
just as in larger companies. Responsible business practices are important for building and
maintaining reputation. Reliability in respecting commitments, honesty in advertising and labelling;
fairness in pricing; quality and safety in products and services, are all basic to developing and
maintaining customer loyalty.

One way to build better relationships with customers is through “cause-related marketing”. This can
enhance customer appreciation of the product or service while raising awareness of important social
issues.

> back to the community. The company also said that the initiative boosted staff morale. In 1999 they were awarded a
Business in the Community award for Community Excellence.

Involvement in the Community.

It is no longer enough to say that businesses contribute to communities primarily by producing
goods and services and thereby creating jobs and wealth. Many entrepreneurs feel an obligation to
pay back something to the communities in which they work. In more cases than not, these activities
or contributions are not motivated by direct business benefits. Furthermore they tend to be local
in scope, occasional in nature and unrelated to business strategy. One survey of 7,662 European
SMEs, the ENSR Enterprise Survey 2001, indicated that almost one-half of European SMEs are
involved in some form of external socially responsible activities. This ratio ranges from 48%
amongst very small enterprises (0 to 9 employees) to 65% and 70% of small (10-49 employees) and
medium sized enterprises (50-250 employees).The most frequent types of social activity included
support to sporting, cultural and welfare activities. Encouraging employees to engage voluntarily
in community activities and projects often has very positive effects on morale and can contribute to
development of skills that can be transferred to the workplace.

Respect for the Environment.

Our research has shown that there is a lack of reliable and quantitative data on the environmental
impacts of SMEs in Europe. There is a consensus however that many SMEs, particularly micro and
small enterprises, lack environmental awareness, motivation and time to develop and implement
sound environmental practices. A recent report carried out for the European Commission concluded
that “The existing evidence suggests that SMEs’ environmental management activities remain low,
especially in comparison with their larger counterparts.8” As a result, SMEs are believed to pollute
disproportunately. In the UK, according to UNIDO, SMEs generate about 60% of commercial
waste and are responsible for 80% of industrial pollution incidents. Their level of awareness of their
impact is said to be low, and few have environmental management systems in place or are aware of
relevant environmental legislation.

There are reasons for this neglect. By necessity management attention in small companies is directed
particularly to primary processes of production and selling and to short-term issues. Environmental
problems – and opportunities – tend to be viewed as long term. As a result potential opportunities for
cost savings and the development of new products and markets receive low priority and attention.
These smaller manufacturing companies do not usually have the dedicated staff with the knowledge
and expertise to address environmental problems. Regulation does not seem to have much impact
since there exists little contact with regulators.

Yet several factors are increasing SME awareness of environmental opportunities. First,
entrepreneurs are learning from their peers that it makes good business sense to reduce costs
by reducing consumption of raw materials, energy and water; by recycling; and by reducing
pollution and waste. Second, the integration by large companies of environmental management
into their business strategies and their adoption of Environmental Management Systems is having
a cascade effect in their value chain. Third, in the public sector, governments are developing
“green” purchasing policies. Some countries, such as Denmark, have defined a national strategy
for environmental supplier requirements. As a result, an increasing number are adopting formal
environmental management systems (e.g. EMAS, ISO 1400), eco-labelling, life cycle assessments,
and cleaner production.

4\. THE BUSINESS CASE
FOR RESPONSIBLE ENTREPRENEURSHIP
Doing good can be good for business. There is a wealth of studies and examples of the business
benefits of socially and environmentally responsible business practices. These can be found in
environmental management, social and environmental reporting, human resource management,
human rights and community involvement as well as other areas. But most of these studies have
been carried out with large companies. What is more important is to develop a business case that is
relevant to SMEs and covers activities frequently carried out by entrepreneurs. The benefits of this
business case include:

ÿ Operational cost savings. Investment in environmental efficiency measures such as the

> reduction in consumption of energy and raw materials, waste reduction, and recycling often
> yield significant savings. Reductions in absenteeism and staff turnover and reduced health-
> care costs as a result of responsible and enlightened workplace and personnel practices also
> are reflected rapidly on the bottom line.

ÿ Increased revenue. Responsible entrepreneurship can help companies strengthen loyalty

> with existing customers and gain new customers and contracts with large companies
> provided they are competitive on price, product quality and service. New markets which are
> accessible to SMEs include eco-tourism, organic farming, “green” wood products, and eco-
> services. There are also opportunities to take more ecological approaches to product design
> and even to market services such as floor covering rather than simply selling rugs.

ÿ New partnership opportunities. SMEs can establish new or closer links with large

> companies with which they share values and/or for which they respect codes of conduct,
> purchasing standards of performance or certification requirements.

ÿ Increased ability to recruit, develop and retain staff. These benefits can be direct effects

> of introducing ‘family friendly’ policies and using volunteering programmes to develop
> skills. They may also have indirect effects such as improved morale and loyalty towards
> company that employees feel proud to be part of. Further, employee loyalty, which can
> also be enhanced when their workplace has ethical practices, often translates into customer
> loyalty and thereby increased sales and profits.

ÿ Improvements in productivity and quality. Greater efficiency and better management,

> supported by responsible practices, can help improve the quality and productivity of output
> as well as customer satisfaction.

ÿ Learning and innovation. Implementation of responsible practices can help companies find

new ways to work, develop skills, manage risks, seize opportunities and solve problems.

A number of studies of large company CSR practices show a positive correlation with profitability,
and we can assume similar results would be shown from a study of SMEs. However, sceptics reply
that good CSR practices are generally synonymous with good management, that is, companies with
good management are more responsible, and that it is the overall good management practices that
produces the better financial results. In other words, correlation yes, but causality is often difficult
to prove.

However, studies of specific practices under controlled conditions have shown that these practices
can reduce costs, enhance employee loyalty and productivity, reduce absenteeism and turnover,
and improve quality - all of which should increase profitability. For example, eco-efficiency is a
term invented by the World Business Council for Sustainable Development in 1992. It is defined as
being “achieved by the delivery of competitively priced goods and services that satisfy human needs
and bring quality of life, while progressively reducing ecological impacts and resource intensity
throughout the life cycle, to a level at least in line with the Earth’s estimated carrying capacity.” It
involves such actions as reducing material intensity, reducing energy intensity, reducing dispersion
of toxic substances, enhancing recycleability, maximizing use of renewables, extending product
durability, and increasing service intensity. Inevitably such actions have a positive and immediate
impact on financial results.

Various studies have shown that such management practices as creating a high performance work
place (see EBBF publication9), improving the work-life balance, introducing more family-friendly
practices, and programmes for volunteering in the local community can affect results both directly
and indirectly. Some recent studies by the International Labour Office in India, Vietnam and Sri
Lanka have demonstrated that improving job and workplace quality and adhering to ILO labour
standards can substantially improve productivity and product quality, sales, and profits of SMEs
producing products ranging from bronze household articles to textiles.

In the UK, the Corporate Survey II, The Ultimate Win-Win and the Game Plan Consumer Research
carried out by Business in the Community (UK) showed that:

ÿ 86% of consumers have a more positive image of a company they see doing something to make

the world a better place, and

ÿ 66% of consumers agree they would switch from one brand to another, price and quality being

equal.

Another part of the business case is that SMEs are more deeply imbedded in the local community:
they depend on people who live there, whose children go to school there, who are more likely to
understand the problems in the local community. They are more dependent on the economic health
of the area and on the human capital, physical infrastructure and environment.

5\. ENGAGING SMEs
It is of course obvious that there is no such thing as a “totally” responsible entrepreneur or a totally
irresponsible SME. It is safe to say that all SMEs are doing something which would fit some
elements of our definition of being responsible, and moreover few of them recognize such actions
as being socially or environmentally “responsible”. They often act naturally in a more intuitive way
without formal policies or codes. So there is a real need to publicly recognize what owner-managers
of SMEs are already doing and have been doing internally and externally.

One of the things which distinguishes SMEs is that the personal values and priorities of the owner-
manager determine the involvement of their companies in socially and environmentally responsible
practices. For many, the quality of relations with employees is among their major concerns. Care
for health, welfare and maintaining employment far exceed that shown by most large companies.
Contributions to charity and support to the local community are said to be much more significant as
a percentage of sales or profits than large companies. Furthermore, the direct involvement of owner-
managers makes them far more responsive to the changing needs of important customers.

Having said this, a great deal remains to be done to engage SMEs which, to remind the reader,
represent over 99 percent of enterprises, over half the working population, and a disproportionate
share of industrial pollution in the world. There are a number of pressures on SMEs to adopt
responsible business practices; in fact we might view it as a galaxy of stakeholders that impact
SMEs in some way and contribute to engaging them. Foremost among these ‘planets’ in the galaxy
are large companies, which will be the focus of this section. In addition, we will mention the roles
played by financial institutions, governments and inter-governmental organizations, partnerships
and multistakeholder initiatives, civil society and non-governmental organizations, and education.

LARGE COMPANIES

Large companies represent the most direct and probably significant influence on SMEs through
their business relationships as customers, suppliers, and mentors of SMEs. These relationships
can be direct business linkages with SMEs, through the management of value and supply chains,
through responsible restructuring initiatives, and through professional associations, partnerships
and multistakeholder initiatives.

Direct business linkages:

Large companies often develop business relationships with SMEs that involve the transfer of
business knowledge, skills and technology. These relationships may result in such responsible
benefits as local community development, capacity building, improved workplace conditions, and
eco-efficiencies. The motivations for large companies are numerous: to enhance reputation and the
company’s licence to operate, to demonstrate local community commitment; to create new markets
and supply sources; to strengthen distributor networks, to name a few. Two other motivations are
discussed separately below: responsible restructuring and strengthening supply chain performance.
Also the actions involved vary widely: outsourcing support, capacity building, workplace
reorganisation, transfer of skills and technology, loans, and new business start up assistance. The
important conclusions of a study carried out by the International Business Leaders Forum10 are that
there are many examples of successful business linkages that had positive
impacts on local stakeholders; that large companies involved benefited in
many ways (business case clear), and that rarely do these actions get noted
by those that oppose TNCs and globalisation.
BP Poland initiated a partnership program, Clean Business, with the Polish Environmental Partnership Foundation and Groundwork.
The program focuses on ways for SMEs to improve their business and environmental performance and allow them access to other
large companies operating in Poland.. It operates in more than 60 areas in Poland, responding to requests for help from around 12,500
businesses, offering more than 35 workshops on business, environment and regulatory topics. (Source: IBLF)

Value and Supply Chain Management

The value chain describes the full range of activities which are required to bring a product or service
from conception, through the different phases of production (involving a combination of physical
transformation and inputs of various producer services), delivery to and use by final consumers,
and final disposal. Production per se is only one of a number of value added links, and often not the
most important. Large companies that are serious about sustainability know that they must not only
change their own practices, but must also change those of their business partners as wel. They can
expect increased legislation to this effect.

There are a number of examples of companies providing various forms of training assistance to their
customers, distributors and franchisees. This is also an opportunity to communicate company policy
with respect to social and environmental practices.

> solution is a good example of how smart business and environmental practices go hand-in-hand” says Mike Kerr, UPS
> environmental affairs manager.

One of the most significant ways that SMEs become “engaged” is the pressure from large customers,
subcontractors and buyers to respect certain standards as conditions for purchasing or distributing
as in the case of distributors and franchisees. Compliance by SMEs can be both a burden and a
source of competitive advantage for those who embrace the responsible social and/or environmental
performance criteria.

A recent study in Italy11 indicated that 24% of SMEs systematically required their suppliers to have
a “social correctness certificate” from their own suppliers and another 10% required suppliers to
do so in some cases. One-third of SMEs themselves say they must produce certification always or
sometimes. This social certification within supply chains is said to be a very recent requirement and
to be growing.

Increasingly suppliers, often SMEs, are being required to comply with a variety of different
requirements relating to labour rights and conditions, human rights, health and safety, and
environment. Also, the growth of NGOs and popular movements targeting global producers is
leading to increasing demands for more transparency and triple bottom line reporting and the
need to achieve minimum environmental and social objectives. This has led to the development
of standardized business processes and the use of process-packages such as ISO quality and
environmental standards (ISO 9000 - quality and 14000 - environmental), SA 8000 (labour) and
industry-specific standards. Multinationals are increasingly integrating global production systems
with compatible processes and procedures through the global chains.

In this increasingly competitive global market, innovation and the capacity to upgrade are important
for survival. It is an important incentive to adopt more responsible practices in human resource
management (diversity, communications, work-life balance), workplace conditions, community
involvement, eco-efficiency, and customer relations.

> It was buyers’ specifications from European supermarkets that drove the adoption of integrated pest management (IPM) in
> South Africa’s renowned citrus industry. IPM not only reduced pesticide consumption but also radically improved worker
health and environmental quality and distinguished their fruit from competitors.

Codes of Conduct: According to the BSR Issue Brief “Codes of Conduct”, the goal of a code of
conduct is to motivate one’s business partners, whether suppliers, distributors or franchisees, to
commit to uphold the same or a similar standard as oneself. Often a signed agreement of compliance
is requested from suppliers and may be a condition for continuation of their business relationship.
Most commonly, these codes address high visibility issues such as child labour, forced labour,
harassment, discrimination, freedom of association, right to bargain collectively, wages and benefits,
health and safety, work hours and the environment. It will set a minimum compliance level that the
supplier must uphold in each of these areas. The choice of words in such codes is very important
and should permit measuring compliance. Most codes stick to “safe” discrimination statements,
which are broad in nature, such as “discrimination for reasons of sex, race, skin colour, religion,
political conviction or social background is prohibited.” ILO standards have universal recognition
and many countries have ratified ILO conventions on standards concerning child labour, forced
labour, minimum wages, health and safety, etc.

Putting environmental and social issues into big companies’ tendering requirements may seem
like an “easy win” but it may backfire if the small firm supplier sees this as yet more bureaucratic
regulation. Good practice suggests that if big businesses are going to introduce these issues through
their supply chain, they need to explain carefully to their SME suppliers why they are doing so
– and offer training and advice in how to comply in ways that will benefit the small firm too. One
UK research found that in the preceding 122 months, 60% of SMEs had been asked by big business
customers about their safety policies and practices; 43% had been asked about environmental
policies and practices; and 17% about social and community issues.

According to one recent report, over half of UK retailers have codes of conduct for their suppliers
(Ethical Performance, July 2003). The best performers audited suppliers against a published code,
reported the results and had a fair trade scheme for some products.

> Nike International was one of the first companies to introduce a Code of Conduct as early as the mid 1990’s covering labour
> standards (Source: www.nike.com):

> •    The manufacturer does not use forced labour in any form.
•    The manufacturer does not employ any person below the age of 18 to produce footwear or below 16 for apparel,

accessories or equipment.
•    The manufacturer provides each employee with a statutory minimum wage or the prevailing industry wage,

whichever is higher.

> •    The manufacturer provides each employee all legally mandated benefits
> •    The manufacturer complies with legally mandated work practices
> •    Management of Environment, Safety and Health (MESH) codes are in place.
•    The manufacturer maintains on file all documentation needed to demonstrate compliance with this Code of

Conduct.

Yet, many NGOs and government officials remain skeptical about the real impact of these actions.
For one thing they say that not enough is being done to implement and monitor compliance with
these codes. For another, they say that even if it is true that 500 or 1,000 companies have formal
codes of conduct, this is a small percentage of the more than 63,000 transnational corporations
(TNCs) in the world. Over one half of these companies are headquartered in EU countries and most,
yes most, are SMEs themselves.12

The result of these codes can be dramatic and very positive, particularly for SME suppliers and
subcontractors in developing countries. Supply chain pressures are proving to be a more powerful
force for social and environmental change than local regulation.

> Proctor and Gamble has over 100,000 suppliers. It has sent 10,000 of these which they consider to be ‘mission critical
> suppliers’ a booklet containing its CSR guidelines. It has also modified contract language to require compliance with local

labour law. The company has programmes for internal monitoring and corrective actions.

Monitoring supply chains: Monitoring involves performing four types of activities: (1) visually
inspecting workplaces (and dormitory facilities where applicable) primarily for health and safety
and visually noticeable violations; (2) interviewing management to understand workplace policies
and practices; (3) reviewing wage, hours, age, health, safety and other records for completeness and
accuracy; and (4) interviewing workers to determine if workplace policies and practices are being
complied with and to detect potential areas of discrimination, harassment, and other less visually
identifiable violations. (See BSR Issue Brief “Monitoring of Global Supply Chain Practices)

> short. Chiquita also relies on independent monitors to certify its plantations for the Better Banana Project, which calls

safety of workers.

.

But external monitoring and audits have their limits both in terms of cost and effectiveness. As
one person asked, “Who audits the auditors?” More effective are correction action, education and
training efforts

Training: Good supply chain management also encompasses training and mentoring of SME
suppliers. Many large companies are finding that simply having formal codes and monitoring
systems is not enough and, in fact, perhaps less important in the long run than training suppliers to
incorporate more sustainable practices and acting as mentors.

In summary, some of the specific actions that large companies might initiate to move this agenda
forward include:

ÿ Introduce clear policies and practices on integrating social and environmental considerations

into business strategy and supply chain management.

ÿ Review internal performance management and reward systems for buyers to properly take

> into consideration not only price, quality, and delivery reliability but also actions to improve
> the social and environmental performance of their suppliers.

ÿ Train and coach suppliers on how to meet the social and environmental requirements and

policies of their customer(s).

ÿ Introduce reward sharing – a business model in which customer and supplier share financial

benefits to reduce consumption of raw materials, energy, water and waste.

ÿ Organize supplier fairs. These open days for suppliers allow them to learn about the

> company’s policy, codes, goals, and future trends in supplier policy. They also allow
> suppliers and customers to network and build closer relationships.

Responsible Restructuring

There are numerous cases of large companies engaging SMEs in the process of enterprise

restructuring. As described in a Joint Working Paper of the ILO and EBBF on “Socially Responsible
Enterprise Restructuring”, these responsible large companies seek to minimize the impact of plant
closings or staff reductions on stakeholders through such actions as job creation, training, assistance
to departing employees in new enterprise start ups, attracting new businesses to the area, and site
regeneration. For example, outsourcing activities to SMEs offers opportunities to communicate the
business case for responsible practices.

> The restructuring policy of the Group Danone is to ensure that all employees affected find suitable employment, that an equal
> number of new jobs is created to maintain employment in the community, and every effort is made to find alternative uses
> for the plant.

International Business Associations

A number of international business associations, primarily of large companies, are at the forefront
of initiatives to engage SMEs through their influence with their adherents. Among them are CSR
Europe, the International (Prince of Wales) Business Leaders Forum (IBLF), Business in the
Community (BitC), the World Business Council for Sustainable Development (WBCSD), and
Business for Social Responsibility (BSR). Their actions are often amplified through independent
national partner organizations.

ÿ The SME Key campaign led by CSREurope has resulted in the development, translation and

> adaptation of a self-diagnostic tool in a number of countries (www.csreurope.org). However
> even simplified versions are considered too complex or time consuming for some SMEs.

ÿ BSR has collaborated in studies of supply chain management and in training for

sustainability.

ÿ BitC has carried out a study of SME engagement in the UK and coordinates an SME

Consortium sponsored by CSREurope.

ÿ WBCSD works directly with its 170 member companies and partner organizations to

> exchange codes of conduct, green procurement practices, greening supply chains, and
> community involvement. It is also creating learning modules on climate and energy, eco-
> efficiency, CSR and sustainable livelihoods.

Professional Trade Associations

Several studies have indicated that owner/managers of SMEs are more influenced by their peers in
and through professional trade associations than by other institutions. This is certainly also true in
seeking ways to engage SMEs.

> Tour Operators Initiative for Sustainable Tourism. In collaboration with UNEP, ILO, and Conservation International, this
> professional association developed a 24 page “Practical Guide to Good Practice: Managing Environmental and Social Issues
> in the Accommodations Sector” which describes how tour operators, many of whom are SMEs, can manage their supply
> chain and improve performance in the ten key environmental and social issue areas critical to long-term success of the
> accommodations sector. For each issue, for example energy management, it defines the issue, why it is important, what the
> owner/manager can do, where there is more information, and examples of good practice. For example, a hotel in Jamaica
> uses low-flush toilets and urinals which use only 5.7 liters of water per flush, aerators and low-flow devices on faucets, water-
> saving showerheads and ground care water-saving techniques to reduce water consumption by 28.6 percent.

> The Chemical Industries Association (UK) has decided to set social and environmental goals for its 180 member companies,
> which include SMEs. They are expected to include targets on human rights and workplace conditions as well as improved

> Ireland. In Spain, the Fundacion Entorno has adapted Project Acorn’s staged approach to ISO 14000 for SMEs in Spain and

> Future, and Accountability. It aims to provide clear, practical advice to organizations promoting sustainable development. It
> has developed a set of Guiding Principles, a Management Framework, and a Toolkit consisting of guides and case studies.

Partnerships

Partnerships and Multistakeholder Initiatives (MSIs) are considered to be an increasingly important
form of “civil regulation” and represent a recent attempt to fill a large gap in regulatory or governing
structures. During the past decade, a number of MSIs have been created. They include such
organizations as the Global Compact, the Global Reporting Initiative, the Ethical Trading Initiative,
the Forest Stewardship Council, the Clean Clothes Campaign, the Fair Labor Association, AA1000,
ISO 14001, the International Cocoa Initiative, and the Worldwide Responsible Apparel Production.
One of the objectives of these MSIs has been to improve the quality of codes of conduct, standard
setting, reporting, auditing, monitoring and certification. They have also sought to harmonize
codes of conduct and to fill some of the gaps in self-regulatory codes related to labour rights, the
responsibilities of suppliers, and provisions for independent monitoring.

> The recently created International Cocoa Initiative brings together the major manufacturers of chocolate products, industry
> associations, labour unions, and NGOs to work towards elimination of the worst forms of child and forced labour in
> growing and processing cocoa beans and their derivative products.

Critics of MSIs in general note that these efforts of a few hundred or thousand companies remain
insignificant in relation to the 64,000 TNCs in the world with more than 800,000 affiliates and
millions of suppliers (Global Inc. estimates). In response, since 1,000 largest TNCs account for 80%
of the world’s industrial production, many of the regulatory and voluntary measures mentioned in
this paper could have a significant impact on their tens of thousands of affiliates and suppliers as
well. These same critics point out also that the mechanisms for ensuring compliance are weak at
best and that this permits a certain degree of “green washing” and “blue washing”; that is companies
may adhere largely to enhance their image and reputation. Another observation is that some major
stakeholders are often not included in their governance structures such as labour, NGOs, and
suppliers in the Third World. (Utting, 2002)

OTHER PLANETS IN THE GALAXY

There are many other planets (stakeholders) in this vast galaxy of institutions that can contribute
to engaging SMEs in more responsible practices. They include financial institutions, government,
intergovernmental organisations, civil society organizations, business development services, and
schools.
Financial Institutions

There are many opportunities for financial institutions to play a much more active and positive
role in engaging SMEs. Whether it be banks, insurance companies, investment firms, microfinance
institutions (MFIs), SRI rating agencies, pension funds, or institutional investors, all can and should
promote more responsible practices in their normal business relationships with large companies as
well as directly with SMEs. The integration of sustainability criteria into lending and credit policies
and in their investment decisions and advisory services seems evident, but are used too rarely.

Further, all financial institutions could use their own purchasing policies and procedures to engage
their suppliers more frequently.

A set of new criteria is being proposed by FTSE4Good to exclude companies in selected sectors
(household goods, textiles and food) from its family of ethical indices unless they have public
policies covering supply chain labour standards backed by management systems to handle policy
breaches and regular progress reports (Ethical Performance vol 5 issue 8)

Some “traditional” commercial banks have positioned themselves strategically and have built brand
images and reputations based on responsible and ethical policies and practices. Examples include
the Cooperative Bank in the UK, the Vancouver City Savings Credit Union in Canada, and Banco
Ethica in Italy.

> The Cooperative Bank in the UK is well known for its ethical policies and practises. Around one-third of its potential new
> customers are turned down each year because of conflicts with the bank’s social and ecological policies. For example, one
> SME was turned down because it sourced raw materials from rain forests in an ‘unsustainable fashion’. The bank’s decisions
> on selection of its 400 suppliers are similarly linked to ethical criteria. Contract tenders request social and environmental
> information from suppliers. Many suppliers now report benefits from increased awareness of these policies and from
> economies from more recycling and reduced consumption of raw materials, energy and water.

> The Brazilian affiliate of ABN AMRO has integrated social and environmental considerations and criteria into the lending
> and credit risk assessment process as well as purchasing. All branch managers have gone through training on how to integrate
> these criteria into their own operations.

> Vancouver City Savings Credit Union, a Canadian financial services business seeks to ensure all its suppliers conform to
> its ethical policy. Each year VanCity places around US$70 million of business with 1500 suppliers. It has begun training
> employees to apply the policy which commits it to actively seek suppliers that practice progressive employee relations,
> contribute to the well being of their communities, and respect the environment.

> Barclayʼs Bank is helping credit unions in the UK to improve their growth prospects in advance of regulation that will make
> it easier for the financially excluded to gain access to low-cost finance. The work is part of its wider support for those who
> have difficulty accessing financial services. (IBE: EP Best Practices)

Insurance and investment firms are increasingly offering clients socially responsible investment products.

> Storebrand, the Norwegian insurance and investment company, claims that nearly 50 percent of its equity holdings are now
> subject to SRI criteria. The firm says now that it “will promote CSR as an integral part of the groupʼs fundamental valuesʼ
> with a focus on employees, customers, shareholders and suppliers.

> Rabobank, a Dutch cooperative, was founded as an alternative solution for entrepreneurs with little access to traditional
> financial markets. They provide special services and products geared toward the needs of SMEs, and favour ones with
> strong sustainable development principles.

Business angel networks also give SMEs access to new sources of finance. These former
entrepreneurs invest in start-up companies and provide advice based on their own experience.

In addition, there are social or ethical banks or community-based economy financial instruments
created primarily to promote community development and to finance social enterprises. Crédit
Alternatif in Belgium; Merkur in Denmark; Ecos Capital Riesgo in Spain; and South Shore Bank
of Chicago are examples.

Pension Funds are another channel for engaging SMEs. BusinessWeek says U.S. labour unions with
their collective $350 billion in pension funds are increasingly using their power as shareholders to
effect change within U.S. companies regarding labour issues such as employee healthcare benefits
and job outsourcing. The article cites the shareholder activism example of the Service Employees
International Union, which has convinced about 12 public pension funds to adopt “responsible
contractor’ policies and invest only in real estate where janitorial staff is allowed to unionise or

offered ‘fair’ wages and benefits.” (BusinessWeek, November 24, 2003)

Government

Governments play a vital role with respect to the engagement of SMEs. Whether international,
national, regional or local, these bodies can serve to encourage more responsible and sustainable
business practices, provide appropriate incentives, pass laws, define standards and monitor and
enforce them. At the international level, the recent actions of the European Commission (EC)
highlight the importance being given to encouraging the development of responsible practices in
SMEs.

> The European Commission plans to establish a Tourism Sustainability Group composed of corporate, governmental and civil
> society groups to develop and monitor sustainability guidelines for tourism and holiday companies.

> The EC Directorate General – Enterprise recently published and disseminated a portfolio of SME good practice cases and
> their direct business benefits13. CSR Europe and the UK Small Business Consortium are also preparing publications on good
> practices.

In countries like the United Kingdom, Denmark and Spain a great deal has been done by government
authorities at all levels. These and other countries finance bilateral agencies that sponsor SME
programmes (e.g. USAID, Canadian International Development Agency, Swedish International
Development Cooperation Agency.) At the same time, several recent studies have highlighted
the fact that many regulations are not respected and are not enforced by authorities. One study
concluded that local governments need to take more responsibility for enforcing existing standards
and regulations in such areas as pollution and workplace practices and that this would be by far the
most effective way to engage SMEs.

A noteworthy initiative of the Department of Trade & Industry in the U.K. was the Acorn Project,
now British Standard 8555. This project aimed specifically at SMEs provides high quality modular
training and support for a six stage model for improving environmental performance. Large
companies play a mentoring role for SMEs in their supply chain. SMEs obtain certification at each
stage and work towards ISO 14001 or EMAS. It has been extended to other countries through the
support and encouragement of the EC. (www.theacornproject.org)

Intergovernmental Organizations

A number of the agencies of the United Nations (UN) are studying and carrying out programmes
aimed at more responsible entrepreneurship. They have also been involved directly in a number
of recently created multistakeholder initiatives. An example is the recent initiative of Kofi Annan,
Director General of the UN, to create the Global Compact with corporations which adhere to nine
basic principles. It now involves more than 1,000 companies. A Global Compact Policy Dialogue
on Supply Chain Management and Partnerships was held at UN Headquarters on 12-13 June 2003
which discussed ways of improving supply chain management.

The International Labour Office (ILO) actively promotes its regulations covering labour and
human rights in the workplace and conducts research and training sessions on the business case
for responsible practices such as job quality and healthy work places. Most of these initiatives
are in developing economies. Other UN agencies including UNDP, UNEP, UNIDO, UNECE and
UNRISD are involved in various ways in promoting responsible practices in SMEs and in the
management of supply chains. UNIDO, for example, through its Business Partnership Programme,
aims to build multi-sector partnerships and strategic knowledge alliances with TNCs, SMEs,

business associations, and other organizations in order to integrate SMEs into value chains. UNEP
and UNDP manage a network of National Cleaner Production Centres, which serve mainly SMEs in
developing countries in improving environmental practices. UNRISD has carried out a great deal of
research in the areas of supply chain management and multistakeholder initiatives.

Both the World Bank Group and the OECD are actively involved in promoting responsible practices
in ways that affect SMEs. The World Bank has been active in multistakeholder initiatives such as
the Global Alliance for Workers and Communities in which it worked with companies like Nike and
Gap in improving workplace initiatives throughout their supply chains. A recent report sponsored by
the World Bank and Business for Social Responsibility (BSR) highlighted the importance of supply
chain management in encouraging SMEs to be responsible. The World Bank has established an SME
Linkage Program, which aims to develop viable local financial and non-financial intermediaries
to support SMEs. Its affiliate, the International Finance Corporation (IFC), is heavily engaged in
promoting SME activities in member countries. The OECD promotes SME development and shows
an ongoing interest in supply chain management as one of the mechanisms for implementing the
OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises14.

Civil Society Organizations take many forms, including NGOs, trade unions, and civic
organizations such as Rotary and Lions. Some NGOs have shown real leadership in bringing buyers
and suppliers together in respecting more responsible practices.

> The Forest Stewardship Council’s (FSC) forest certification scheme is one of the longest-running and most widely
> implemented ethical sourcing schemes in the world. It has been most successful in the Do-It-Yourself sector.

Some NGOs represent vital partners in efforts to engage SMEs both directly and indirectly through
other stakeholder groups. They are active in many of the multistakeholder initiatives and partnerships
discussed above.

> The International Network for Environmental Management (INEM) is a non-profit federation of national associations and
> clean production centres for environmental management and sustainable development. INEM offers various services to help
> SMEs improve their environmental and economic performance including good practice cases, publications, a tool kit with
> guides and check lists.(www.inem.org)

We can also expect more activism from unions and their pension fund managers on companies in
which their funds are invested.

Business Development Services (BDS): perform a wide variety of non- financial services such as
labour and management training; consultancy and counselling; marketing and information services;
and technology development. These services form an important part of the “market support
structure” that contributes to SME competitiveness.

The feedback on the overall effectiveness of various forms of BDSs is mixed. Some find that
accountants, consultants, incubators, and other providers of services to SMEs, when demand driven,
are quite credible and listened to by owner/managers of SMEs. Other studies signal that BDSs that
are highly subsidized and whose services thus tend to be very general and supply-driven are less
relevant and not very effective compared with those that are demand-driven. In both cases, however,
there is little evidence that BDSs promote responsible practices. Perhaps they too should be better
informed of the business case for sustainability.

Education: Business schools and vocational training schools should be integrating social and
environmental considerations into their curriculum. But to date few business schools seem to

integrate these concepts into courses on strategy, entrepreneurship, human resource management,
supply chain management, logistics, and marketing, nor do they promote concepts of life-span
responsibility for products and services for larger companies. As consumers become more vocal
about their concerns for how goods and services are produced (i.e. workplace practices, respect
for labour and human rights, child labour, and the environment), students themselves may bring
pressures on schools to integrate these concerns into their courses.

6\. SUMMING UP
The preceding chapters have highlighted both the importance of engaging SMEs in more socially
and environmentally responsible business practices and the complexity of the problem. SMEs are
large in number, extremely heterogeneous, constantly coping with other challenges, and often on the
brink of bankruptcy. There are many actors and a large number of initiatives to engage these SMEs,
some more successful than others. So, what general conclusions and observations can we draw from
this labyrinth?

First, large companies are the most important single influence for more responsible behaviour by
SMEs through their normal business practices and relationships. There is convincing evidence that
efforts to engage SMEs both directly and indirectly through the management of value chains can
contribute importantly to economic as well as social and environmental sustainability. But efforts
to date have only scratched the surface. The vast majority of large companies ignore these issues;
internal management practices rarely reward managers for their contributions; and often stakeholder
relations are adversarial rather than collaborative.

Pioneer large companies in CSR can play an important role through their leadership in international
business associations, professional trade associations, and multistakeholder initiatives. They can
recognize social and environmental problems in their value chains and cooperate with NGOs,
unions, and host and home governments in finding enduring solutions. Yet another thing large
companies can do is to comply with laws wherever they operate. While legal standards in some
developing countries are not necessarily low (Chinese labour laws are said to be as high as those in
OECD countries), they are often not enforced.

Yet another way in which large companies can engage SMEs is to favour longer term relationships
with their suppliers and business partners and apply sustainability criteria as well as price, quality
and reliability in selecting suppliers and in evaluating and compensating purchasers.

Second, financial institutions represent a largely untapped source of engagement for SMEs. Greater
consideration of sustainability criteria and practices in lending to and investing in both SMEs and
large companies could have a significant impact on the engagement of SMEs. One should not
minimize the impact which microfinance institutions can have on millions of microentrepreneurs if
they apply social and environmental criteria in their lending practices.

Third, another potentially very important contributor in engaging SMEs is trade associations in
which SMEs are members. These bodies, in frequent contact with their members, can promote and
increase awareness of ‘good practice’ and the business case. They can also promote and facilitate
certification schemes.

Fourth, partnerships between business, government, international agencies and civil society
organizations are increasingly vital to engaging SMEs particularly in developing countries.
Through these partnerships large companies can enhance their reputations and competitiveness
and contribute to human rights, labour standards, and social and economic development. Also
partnerships among companies in the same sector can bring much greater pressure on suppliers for
responsible practices.

Fifth, governments must assume their responsibility as the primary regulators and legal enforcers.
According to the Business and Industry Advisory Committee of the OECD, “the primary means

for promoting environmental and social protections is the implementation and enforcement of
national laws and regulations.” According to some experts, better enforcement of these regulations
and encouragement and assistance to SMEs represent the most immediate opportunities especially
in third world countries. An equally important area for engaging SMEs is through more ethical
procurement policies for government agencies and intergovernmental organizations which should
specify standards for labour and human rights as well as environmental issues. In parallel various
forms of capacity building and awareness building programs could facilitate adherence to such
standards.

Concerted action by and through these major stakeholder groups: large companies, financial
institutions, trade associations, and governments, and through partnerships, can go a long way
toward engaging SMEs. At the same time, similar actions can be envisaged by the many other
stakeholder groups discussed in this paper as well as through local, national and international
organizations representing selected segments such as women entrepreneurs, youth entrepreneurs,
owner/managers of family-owned businesses, social entrepreneurs and cooperatives.

Annex A

List of the main global standards being developed

The Global Reporting Initiative: a long-term multi-stakeholder, international undertaking whose
mission is to develop and disseminate globally applicable sustainability reporting guidelines for
voluntary use by organizations reporting on the economic, environmental and social dimensions of
their activities, products and services.

Social Accountability 8000: Social Accountability International developed a standard for workplace
conditions and a system for independently verifying factoriesʼ compliance. This standard (SA8000),
and its verification system draw from established business strategies for ensuring quality (such as
those used by the international standards organization for ISO 9000) and add several elements that
international human rights experts have identified as essential to social auditing.

Ethical Trading Initiative Base Code: a global standard on employment and working conditions,
linked directly to ILO Conventions and the UN Declaration of Human Rights and Rights of the
Child. The Code is a partnership consisting of companies, unions and NGOs. Members of ETI are
expected to sign up to the code.

AA1000: an accountability standard developed by the Institute of Social and Ethical AccountAbility,
focused on securing the quality of social and ethical accounting, auditing and reporting. It is a
foundation standard, and as such can be used in two ways: a) as a common currency to underpin the
quality of specialized accountability standards, existing and emergent; b) as a stand alone system
and process for managing and communicating social and ethical accountability performance.

ISO (esp 14000 and 9000): The International Organisation for Standardization (ISO) is a world-
wide federation of national standards bodies from 130 countries. ISO administers over 11,000
standards covering 97 categories (one of which covers management). The ISO standards mainly
focus on customers, staff and suppliers in the delivery of quality systems for product (ISO9000) and
environmental (ISO14000) management.

The OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises: are recommendations addressed by
governments to multinational enterprises. They provide voluntary principles and standards for
responsible business conduct consistent with applicable laws. The Guidelines aim to ensure that
the operations of these enterprises are in harmony with government policies, to strengthen relations
between enterprises and relevant societies, to help improve the foreign investment climate and to
enhance their contribution to sustainable development.

What is the European Bahá’í Business Forum (EBBF)?

EBBF is a network of nearly 350 business people residing in 50 countries throughout the world.
EBBF is drawing increasing attention in Europe through its promotion of responsible and ethical
business practices, its collaboration with other networks with similar values, with various United
Nations agencies, and its active involvement with business schools and international student
associations like AIESEC.

History. EBBF began in 1990 as an informal network of men and women in business and
management. In 1993, EBBF was registered in Paris, France as a non-profit association. Its
membership is open to men and women of all faiths and all nationalities who have a legitimate
interest in business and who recognize the importance of socially responsible and ethical practices
in management.

Vision and Mission. Members of EBBF have endorsed the following statement of vision and
mission:

Vision: to enhance the well-being and prosperity of humankind.

> Mission: to promote ethical values, personal virtues and moral leadership in business as well
> as in organizations of social change.

To carry out this mission, EBBF:

ÿ Provides a forum for business leaders to explore ways and means of applying ethical and moral

values in their daily professional lives.

ÿ Seeks to be a constructive force for change and innovation in management practices, with a

focus on relating moral and ethical principles to business success.

ÿ Initiates and publishes scholarly works in the field of management.

ÿ Organizes and participates in seminars and conferences on subjects relating to its core values.

ÿ Focuses many of its efforts on tomorrow’s leaders (students of management and economics)

through its partnership with AIESEC and lectures in various business schools.

Core Values. EBBF seeks to promote seven concepts described in its publication, Emerging Values
for a Global Economy. These core values or principles are:

1\.   Business ethics
2\.   Corporate social responsibility
3\.   Sustainable development
4\.   Partnership of women and men
5\.   A new paradigm of work
6\.   Consultation in decision making
7\.   Value based leadership

Membership. EBBF members represent nearly all countries in Western Europe and many of the
emerging democracies in Eastern and Central Europe. EBBF members also reside in the Americas,

Asia and several African countries. This diversity is enhanced by the members’ varied professional
fields and interests. While the focus of membership development has been on decision makers,
ranging from entrepreneurs to top executives in large companies, present members also include
consultants and academics as well as students of business and economics.
