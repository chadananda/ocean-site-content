  Freud’s Transference and the Four States of

Bahá’u’lláh

Wolfgang A. Klebel

As in several previous contribution of this writer in the
“Lights of ‘Irfán,” the understanding of a central Verse from
the “Valley of Unity” of Bahá’u’lláh’s Seven Valleys is at the
core of this article. In this verse Bahá’u’lláh talked about
something that is fundamentally True of Thyself and developed
a structure that was called tetrarchic by this writer. (Emphasis
and sentence structure was added by this writer)

And thus
firstness and lastness, outwardness and inwardness
are, in the sense referred to,

true of thyself,
that in these four states conferred upon thee
thou shouldst comprehend the four divine states

[SVFV 27, emphasis by this writer]

These four states have been called tetrarchic, which is a term
that was coined to describe this structure and was modeled
from an originally Greek word used in a new sense. It can be
organized in this structure and the Wilberian concepts of ‘I’,
‘We’, ‘It’ and ‘Its’ can be put in the respective places and the
opposites of Spirit versus Body and Unity versus Diversity can
be added.

The four journeys in the pathway of love have been added in
these four areas as well as many other structures from the
Bahá’í Writings fit this tetrarchic form.

> The journeys in the pathway of love are reckoned as
> four: From the creatures to the True One; from the True
> One to the creatures; from the creatures to the
> creatures; from the True One to the True One. [SVFV 25]

Tetrarchic Understanding of Reality

Considering that answers reaching into the depth of being
are complex, are transcending simple logic or straight forward
thinking, the process of thinking about such answers needs to
be explored as well. With this thought, we come to the special
aspect of this study, the fact we talk about a tetrarchic
structure.

Freud’s Transference                                              29

Tetrarchy is a Greek word from history, “tetras” meaning
four and “arche” meaning beginning, principle, prince or ruler.
The meaning of arche, which is found in words like archeology
or archaic, is described in the Wikipedia:

> Arche (Ancient Greek: ἀρχή) is a Greek word with
> primary senses ‘beginning’, ‘origin’ or ‘first cause’.
> Later, ‘power’, ‘sovereignty’, ‘domination’ were also
> accepted as extended meanings. ... In the language of the
> archaic period (8th-6th century BC) arche (or archai)
> designates the source, origin or root of things that exist.
> In ancient Greek Philosophy, Aristotle foregrounded the
> meaning of arche as the element or principle of a thing,
> which although indemonstrable and intangible in itself,
> provides the conditions of the possibility of that thing.

In this article the word tetrarchy — or consisting of four
principles, modes or causes — is mostly used in the meaning of
the Greek word “Arche” ascribed to Aristotle, as presented
above, “as the element or principle of a thing, which although
indemonstrable and intangible in itself, provides the conditions
of the possibility of that thing.” The four principles of the
tetrarchy have to be understood in this way, they are the
elements or modes of reality, they are the condition of the
possibility of reality and the condition of every reality, while
reality is always seen as what actually and concretely exists.
They explain how to understand concrete reality. In their unity
reality becomes understandable in its diversity. This is similar as
in traditional Aristotelian philosophy; reality or being was
described as the true, the good, and the beautiful.

There are several important and new ideas combined in this
tetrarchic idea. The most important are based on the concept of
Complementarily in Niels Bohr’s quantum mechanics, of Polar
Opposites in Romano Guardini’s “Gegensatz” philosophy, and
the Four Quadrants in Ken Wilber’s Integral Psychology, all of
which have been presented in previous articles of this author in
the “Lights of ‘Irfán.” Here the connection between the

30                                            Lights of Irfán vol. 16

complementary and polar concepts, as well as the connection
between the four quadrants or the four principles in the
tetrarchic system will be addressed.

These connections will be further explained by including the
Freudian concept of transference into the understanding of
reality. Reality is then understood as a process to indicate the
underlying unity in the polar and fourfold tetrarchies of being,
of reality, and of the self. Finally this study will give us some
insight into the way God is represented in the mind according
to psychoanalytic understanding. This correlation of a Freudian
concept with the Bahá’í Writings is unexpected to say the least.
Additionally, this fact can give a psychological explanation of
how the child acquires the first idea about God which is another
benefit of this approach.

First the Freudian transference concept will be presented
here and it will be shown that it has an intrinsic tetrarchic
structure that was not described directly by Freud.
Nevertheless, it can be inferred from his writings, because what
Freud said about transference and its aspects leads towards this
conclusion, which Freud could not make because of his
“scientific” prejudices and his methodological reductionism.
The difference between what Freud found in his analytic
treatment of his patients and what he could systematically
describe in his meta-psychology is quite significant and was
described by this author in his dissertation,1 more than 30 years
before he developed the concept of tetrarchies as a way of
understanding reality. The following is quoted from this
dissertation on transference and culture, illuminating this
question.

> What has been called the cultural aspect of transference
> has its origin in the social aspect of man. The very fact
> that transference is the transference of early childhood
> experiences with significant others makes this clear. The
> instinctual aspect of transference becomes clear when
> transference is seen as repetition compulsion; and when

> The interaction between the child and his mother (or

> an objectively tangible fact, but it was present in what
> is usually called culture, that is, the human interrelation.

> This needed to be stated here in order to indicate the far
> reaching implications of Freud’s new understanding that
> transference is a universal aspect of the human mind.

[Klebel 1976, 110-111]

Freud developed the transference concept in his paper of the
Dora Case2 and his definition includes the following aspects:

> Transferences are new editions of impulses or fantasies
> of the past, which are experienced as present and as
> related to the analyst.

> According to psychoanalytic theory and practical
> experience in psychoanalysis, transferences cannot be
> avoided.

> Transferences are not created by analysis; they are only
> brought to light by it.
32                                             Lights of Irfán vol. 16

> In the beginning, transferences seemed to be a great
> obstacle to treatment, yet, if handled properly, they are
> the most effective vehicle of change in therapy and lead
> to the understanding of the neuroses and of the analytic
> process.” [Klebel 1976, 47]

The universality of transference in every human relationship,
as stated by Freud is of importance in order to understand how
transference and culture are related. Freud clearly and
frequently stated this fact, for example in his Autobiographical
Study:

> It must not be supposed, however, that transference is
> created by analysis and does not occur apart from it.
> Transference is merely uncovered and isolated by
> analysis. It is a universal phenomenon of the human
> mind, it decides the success of all medical influence, and
> in fact dominates the whole of each person’s relations to
> this human environment. [Freud 1925, 20, 42]

Here it is clearly stated that transference not only happens in
any human relationship, but that every relationship is
dominated by transference, in other words, transference is
essential to every relationship. On the other hand in Freud’s
definition of culture, or civilization (Freud uses these terms
interchangeable), two aspects are stressed, one that culture
allows man to control the forces of nature, but most important
in this context is the statement that culture regulates all
relations of men to one another.

> Human Civilization (or Culture) ... “includes on the one
> hand all the knowledge and capacity that men have
> acquired in order to control the forces of nature. ...

> on the other hand, all the regulations necessary in order
> to adjust the relations of men to one another and
> especially the distribution of the available wealth.”
> [Freud 1927, 21, 5-6]
Freud’s Transference                                              33

Freud defined culture as regulating all human relationships
and defines transferences as dominating all human relationships
but never mentions these two concepts together in his many
papers on culture and in his papers on transference. This fact
was one of the most important finding of this author’s
dissertation. The reasons for this are explored in the
dissertation; it is mainly the fact that Freud sees culture from
the instinctual side in an almost Darwinian perspective, even
places the origin of culture into the guilt of the original human
tribe over the original patricide he projects must have happened
in the beginning. In his book “Moses and Monotheism“ (1937)
Freud describes this story and concluded that in a reaction
formation this was the origin of monotheism.

After analyzing in the dissertation the Freudian transference
concept and its relation to therapy, repetition compulsion, love
and human relations in general, four theses on transference
were presented in the author’s dissertation, which will be
quoted below:

> If transference is a universal aspect of every human
> relation, it follows consequently that there is no stage in
> life without transference as long as there is relationship
> with other people.

> Whatever occurs between two persons, as long as it can
> be called a human relation, will include transference as a
> basic function of this relationship.

> Transference as a basic function of human relationships
> is not limited to two persons relating to each other; it is
> a characteristic of all human relationships including the
> relations between an individual and a group, and
> between groups themselves.

> If culture is defined as that encompassing concept
> integrating all forms of human relationships, then the

> transference concept will be of utmost importance for
> the understanding of culture. [Klebel, 1976, 150-151]

When this understanding of transference is related to culture
a fourfold structure appears, which was originally described by
this writer in the following way:

> Transference is part of every relationship as stated by
> Freud. During this investigation it has become
> increasingly apparent that transference has to be seen as
> the transference of two aspects of every relationship.
> The two aspects have been described as the instinctual
> and cultural aspects of man. The function of
> transference is to connect these two aspects into a whole.

> This connection can be described in two different areas
> which are interrelated; the first is the binding together
> of the instinctual and the cultural aspect in the
> individual. The other area is the tradition of this
> combination from one generation to the other. [Klebel
> 1976 191]

When the instinctual is understood as the biological and
outside of man and the cultural as the inside or spirituality of
man, then we can easily place transference into the Wilberian
scheme of the four quadrants or can see transference as the idea
that connects the four aspects of the tetrarchy together. Even
when this author wrote his dissertation the importance of this
finding was noted as essential to a new understanding of the
human nature, when it was stated:

> The understanding of the cultural function of
> transference is expected not only to be a contribution
> to psychoanalytic meta-psychology; it also opens up the
> psychological approach to the question of the nature of
> man. [Klebel 1976, 193]
Freud’s Transference                                           35

After this introduction it needs to be demonstrated how this
understanding of transference can be called tetrarchic and how
this spreads a new light on both, on the concept of tetrarchies
and of transference. Transference has two functions; it is
bridging as a concept — and as a psychoanalytic experience —
the area of the instinct with the area of personal relationships
and it is further bridging one generation to the next, i.e.,
bridging the area of the collective and the individual, or, in
other words, the area of the whole and its parts.

Transference as a Bridge between the Cultural and the
Instinctual

It needs to be noted that instincts are the interpretation of
the biological desires and needs of humans, and the importance
of transference is in the fact that transference enables the
person to elevate or sublimate these instincts into the cultural
or spiritual realm, so they can find satisfaction in the area of
the cultural or spiritual. In the normal maturing process this is
happening to every human being. In the analytic treatment of a
person, who could not do this appropriately and suffers from
neuroses, this process is renewed in treatment and hopefully
brought to a mature solution. In other words, when the
biological needs of the child are either not properly taken care
of or are not elevated in the growing up process, to find their
satisfaction in cultural and mature relations with others, mental
illness appears and therapy or analysis is needed to learn what
was missed before.

In this context maturity of the human self can be measured
by the ability to sublimate the instinctual to the cultural, Freud
would state “where Id was Ego shall be.” It could well be stated,
that maturity is achieved when physical sexuality is replaced or
better elevated by mutual love, so that the instinctual is more
than the animalistic “nature” and is integrated and elevated into
the spiritual, into love. Pure Sexuality becomes erotized
through elevation in mutual love. The same is true for all other

36                                               Lights of Irfán vol. 16

instinctual need of the child. So intake of food becomes a
festive celebration of a community and this process of
sublimation can be carried forward into many rituals of
different Religion, as for example the breaking of bread in the
Christian Eucharist is a symbol for the presence of Christ in the
community of believers.

The biological and physical constitution of a person might
make this maturing process more difficult or impossible. The
cultural factors of parenting and child rearing also influence
this process. In most cases both of these causes are combined,
so that the influence of nurture and nature can never be
separated in the individual. We are dealing here with a polarity,
a “Gegensatz,” between the instinctual and the cultural,
between the physical and the spiritual, or between the body and
the mind, which is connected and united through the process of
transference, because already in the child parents transfer their
cultural understanding to the newborn (or even the expected)
child; the child then continues to transfer this experience later
in life, in a mature or in a neurotic, or mentally ill fashion to all
other relationships the child will develop during her life,
especially to the relationship she will have with her children.

Transference as a bridge between the individual and
collective

The other aspect is the fact that transference bridges the
internal dynamic from the individual towards the other, i.e., the
other as individual or as a group, the other even as presented in
different group structures such as family, state or other
organizations like interest groupings or churches and finally all
of humankind. This idea of culture, which is transferred from
one generation to the next, is usually understood as including
all social and spiritual ideas that determine humanity.

This aspect of transference — especially developed in the
Object Relation Theory — was studied by Fairbairn, Winnicott
and others in England.3 In this theory, contrary to classical

psychoanalysis, where the emphasis is in the instinctual dynamic
interaction, the need of the child to relate is the driving force
of development. The fact that a child is born into a culture,
into a family, and develops his ‘self’ in relation to the ‘other’, is
underlying human development. One could say, the polarity
between individual and collective is the dynamic force that
causes the development of the child.

In this process the young child develops the reorientation of
the other and of the self in his understanding of reality. This
process is usually concluded when the child reaches the age of
four and the understanding of myself as “I” and the other as
“you” is the achievement of this early development. The fact
that in this process the God Representation is also developed
has been shown recently in a psychoanalytic study.

Transference and the “God Representation”

As a matter of fact even the concept of God, as it develops
in the child and matures in the adult falls into this
developmental category, as has been described by Ana-Maria
Rizzuto, M.D., in her book The Birth of the Living God,4 where
she follows the psychoanalytic thoughts of Freud and extends
and surpasses his idea about the concept formation of God in
the child and adult, coming basically to similar conclusions as
this author. She wrote in the epilogue of her book:

> In the end I had to disagree with Freud — but not
> totally: only with one Freud, the one of science,
> intellect, and reality, the Freud who said; “No, our
> science is no illusion, but an illusion it would be to
> suppose that what science cannot give us we can get
> elsewhere.”

> The Freud who believes that man lives on the bread of
> knowledge alone, I have to disagree with.
38                                              Lights of Irfán vol. 16

> However, I follow the other Freud, the Freud of object
> relations, the Oedipus complex, family relations, until
> through my research I arrive at one of his own
> conclusions about some individuals in the Western
> Word:

> “The idea of a single great god — an idea which must be
> recognized as a completely justified memory, ... has a
compulsive character: it must be believed.” [Freud 23, 130,

italics in the original]

In a final corollary to the dissertation of this writer a similar
statement was made about transference and religion. Developed
over many decades this idea is now coming to the conclusion
that the transference concept is essentially connected to the
tetrarchic understanding of man.

The transference concept as a bridge between the individual
and collective aspect of man is the other side of the idea of this
concept as bridging the instinctual with cultural, which has

been developed in the tetrarchic description of man. When we
combine these two polarities, between the instinctual and
cultural, between the individual and collective, we find
ourselves on familiar ground and can simply translate these into
the words of Ken Wilber, who talks about the inner and outer,
the individual and collective structure of man and of the world
in what he called the four quadrants as described before. The
four causes of Aristotle fit into this schema as well and are
included here in the picture.

Psychoanalysis has most intensively studied this relationship
between people, between the “I” and the “Thou”, between the
“Self” and the “Other”, and it was this relationship that has
been investigated by the Heidegger6 student and psychoanalyst
Hans Loewald, who made the following conclusion:

> Our object, being what it is, is the other in ourselves
> and our self in the other. To discover truth about the
> patient is always discovering it with him and for him as
> well as for ourselves and about ourselves. And it is
> discovering truth between each other, as the truth of
> human beings is revealed in their interrelatedness. While
> this may sound unfamiliar and perhaps too fanciful, it is
> only an elaboration, in nontechnical terms, of Freud’s
> deepest thoughts about the transference neurosis and its
> significance in analysis.7

This relationship between the individual and the collective,
between the self and the other was especially developed in the
psychoanalytic Object Relations Theory, which theory is
described by Otto Kernberg,8

> Internalization of object relations refers to the concept
> that, in all interactions of the infant and child with the
> parental figures, what the infant internalizes is not an
> image or representation of the other (“the object”), but
> the relationship between the self and the other, in the
40                                             Lights of Irfán vol. 16

> form of a self-image or self-representation interacting
> with an object-image or object-representation.

> This internal structure replicates in the intrapsychic
> world of both real and fantasized relationships with
> significant others.

What needs to be stressed in this definition are two aspects
of this theory. First, what the infant internalizes is a psychic,
inner representation of the other and secondly that not the
other as a person, such as a father or mother, is represented,
but the relationship of the child to this person is what is
represented. It is the relationship, something not tangible,
something one could call spiritual, what is represented.

Consequently, in this relationship many other objects can be
included, such as the safety blanket, or a Teddy bear, which is
usually called a transitional object. Therefore, the child can
after this development, replace a real relationship with this
imaginary relationship. When the child at first relates to the
security blanket, it uses this learned introject to substitute for
the absent mother, and reduces anxiety that way. What below
will be stated about the God representation needs to be
understood in this special way.

In Birth of the Living God, Rizzuto describes in this context
the God representation and demonstrates it on four cases from
her psychoanalytic practice. She comes to the following
conclusions

> The first elaboration of a God representation which we
> can trace begins with eye contact between mother and
> child ... between the ages of two and three. [Rizzuto 178]

She clearly understands this relation in the frame of the Object
Relations Theory when she says:

> God is a special type of object representation created by
> the child in that psychic space where transitional objects

> ... are provided with their powerfully real illusory lives.

[Rizzuto 177]

Rizzuto demonstrated in her paper that the idea of the God
representation develops throughout the life of the patient.
Usually it matures and is improved, but in the special cases she
presented, she shows how the childish experience of the
relationship with the parents still influences the adult
understanding of God.

> The psychic process of creating and finding God — this
> personalized representational transitional object —
> never ceases in the course of human life. [Rizzuto 179]

This original understanding of God is developed throughout
life, especially in all life crises, and it must change to be able to
support a mature believe in God.

> God, as a transitional representation needs to be
> recreated in each ... crisis to be found relevant for
> lasting belief. [R. 208]

What Rizutto demonstrates and documents based on her
case material, is an important aspect of transference and its
sublimation. From the internal representation of the self and
the other, as postulated in the Object relation Theory, the
representation of God is derived. That really means that when
the child develops and understands him/herself in the polar
opposite to the other — the adult — the child develops at the
same time and in the same process the representation of
God, of a Transcendent and Ultimate Reality. This reality is
usually called God, but in an antireligious culture, or during its
further development even in a religious culture, other ideas can
be placed in this position. Such ideas are in a nationalistic
milieu the Nation or the Race, in a communistic ideology it is
the Proletariat. Leaders of totalitarian states are placed in the
same position like the Führer, Stalin or the Chairman Mao, all
of them were regarded as godlike persons and a godlike cult was

42                                              Lights of Irfán vol. 16

developed around them. In the same way, people who believe
that science is the answer to all questions will place scientific
progress into this position of absolute reality. All of these ideas
or personalities can take on the mantel of a religion, which
explains how these ideas can become attractive to people who
believe these ideologies.

The need to find an ultimate entity which is developed in
early childhood, when human relations are first established
between the self and the other, appears to be universal. It will
be transferred to all other future relationships, only its
application is varied. This was stated by the physicist Walker.

> Everyone worships reality. Each person looks about
> him, listens a moment — listens as long as life will let him
> pause to listen — and then he falls down and worships
> whatever it is that looks like this is what it is all about.

[p. 372]

Concluding it can be said: Transferences are the basis of all
human relationships and are the spiritual aspect of every
communication. Transference bridges the instinctual with the
spiritual in the individual and further explains the tradition of
this bridge of these polar opposite concepts of inwardness
(spirituality) and outwardness (materiality) from one generation
to the next and from one person to the other, as well as
between groups and individuals and between groups as well.

In this process one more element is developed, the need to
find an ultimate explanation, a transcendent idea or entity, or
even a personal reality which is traditionally called God. On the
other hand, individuals or even groups or cultures can utilize
any other idea that is transcending the concrete reality, any
other ideology to replace this representation, such as the
transcendent idea of State, of Nation, of Masses, and often of
Science replacing this original representation. In a more
primitive culture any totem, animal, the sun or even imaginary
entities that are connected to the natural processes, like ocean

and heaven etc. can be used as this ultimate representation,
which would be called different gods in polytheistic cultures.

The psychological and sociological aspect of Religion can be
studied from this point of view and would certainly be able to
explain modern religiosity and irreligiosity from a new point of
view. All what is stated in the Bahá’í Writings about the need to
educate children describes the need to develop the original
perception of God and assure that the child is helped to develop
the original idea into a rational and informed idea of God and
not develop other substitute ideas, which replace the true
understanding and lead the growing up child in the wrong
direction.

Monotheistic religions will concentrate this development
onto their idea of the One God, but that does not exclude the
possibility of alternatives replacing this idea as substitutes,
which will be any other unifying idea of some highest reality,
like State, or Nation, or Race, or the Masses, which has
developed in modern societies. Even the regression of modern
man into the old polytheistic religions is possible today in Neo-
paganism. The psychological and sociological aspect of Religion
can be studied from this point of view and would certainly be
able to explain modern religiosity from a new point of view.

This introduction of the Freudian transference concept into
the philosophical and theological interpretation of the Bahá’í
Writings is surprising and unexpected. Nevertheless, it seems to
fit and it is even valuable and advantageous for the
understanding of the Bahá’í Writings, shedding new light at the
truth of the Revelation. What was found by Freud in his
analysis of people in mental trouble, and what he made to the
cornerstone of his therapeutic effort becomes through this
correlation with the Bahá’í Scriptures a valuable contribution
to both, to the understanding of the self of man and to the
better understanding of the very Writings which were
correlated with this Freudian concept.

44                                              Lights of Irfán vol. 16

This conclusion about the value of correlation as presented
by Shoghi Effendi was described in McLean’s book is the fact
of the mutual benefit of correlation to both, to the
understanding of the Bahá’í Writings on the one hand and the
writings of philosophical and scientific thinkers on the other.

> The method of correlation assumes that any truth
> statement found outside the Bahá’í corpus illuminates
> or augments truth statements found in the Bahá’í
> teachings, just as the Bahá’í sacred writings illuminate or
> augment the findings of other thinkers or systems of
> truth.9

There is another issue that needs to be mentioned here, even
though a deeper study of this issue is still outstanding. It is the
question of where in the psychic apparatus as described by
Freud this transitional space is located. It is important to raise
this question, especially if this is the space where the God
representation in the human mind is located. Strictly following
the Bahá’í Writings the answer is not difficult when considering
these word of Bahá’u’lláh.

59. O SON OF BEING!

> Thy heart is My home; sanctify it for My descent. Thy
> spirit is My place of revelation; cleanse it for My
> manifestation. [AHW 59]

> But, O my brother, when a true seeker determineth to
> take the step of search in the path leading to the
> knowledge of the Ancient of Days, he must, before all
> else, cleanse and purify his heart, which is the seat of the
> revelation of the inner mysteries of God, from the
> obscuring dust of all acquired knowledge, and the
> allusions of the embodiments of satanic fancy. [KI 192]

> Unlock, O people, the gates of the hearts of men with
> the keys of the remembrance of Him Who is the

> Remembrance of God and the Source of wisdom
> amongst you. He hath chosen out of the whole world
> the hearts of His servants, and made them each a seat
> for the revelation of His glory. [GWB 296]

It is the human heart that is the place of the God
Representation, this starts in the little child and needs to be
developed throughout life. That the heart is much more than a
medical blood pump has been demonstrated by the fact that in
heart transplants some basic, as well as, traumatic memories are
transplanted and can appear in the dreams of the new owner of
the heart. The new science of neurocardiology has proven
additionally that the heart has what has been called “the little
brain of the heart” as has been presented by this author in
Lights of Irfan before where the following quote was presented.

> In the last twenty years, evidence has accumulated for
> the presence of a functional heart brain — first
> described as the “little brain of the heart.” From a
> neuroscience perspective, the nervous system within the
> heart, that is intrinsic to the heart, is made up of
> populations of neurons capable of processing
> information independent of extra cardiac neurons.

> This collection of neurons can sense alterations in the
> mechanical and chemical milieu of various regions
> throughout the heart. With every beat of the heart,
> changes in heart rate and regional dynamic changes are
> detected and transduced into neuronal impulses that are
> processed internally. Such information is also sent to
> neurons in the base of the brain via afferent axons in
> the vagus nerve and to the spinal column neurons via
> afferent axons in sympathetic nerves. This information
> is returned via efferent neurons controlling the heart.
> Furthermore, circulating hormones influence the
> behavior of the little brain of the heart.10

That the heart has abilities that are different but parallel to
the abilities of the brain has been scientifically established.

> Recent work in the relatively new field of
> Neurocardiology has firmly established that the heart is
> a sensory organ and a sophisticated information
> encoding and processing center. Its circuitry enables it
> to learn, remember, and make functional decisions
> independent of the cranial brain.11

From this evidence it can be concluded that what is revealed
in the Bahá’í Writings about the heart can be correlated with
findings of the science of neurocardiology, especially if we
consider two facts. One is that the heart does not have
consciousness, so what is going on in the heart is known only if
it becomes conscious in the brain. Another things is what we
know from our dreams, there is a different language in the
heart which has to be translated when what is in the heart gets
to be known by the brain.

This means that the God representation or the personal
knowledge about God is not an immediate fact of awareness,
and it has to be translated into the brain if it needs to become
known. Additionally, following again the Bahá’í Writings, the
heart must be pure and kind in order that the Revelation of
God is able to be recognized there.

> For the life of the flesh is common to both men and
> animals, whereas the life of the spirit is possessed only
> by the pure in heart who have quaffed from the ocean of
> faith and partaken of the fruit of certitude ... [KI 120]

Therefore this is the first advice given in the Writings of
Bahá’u’lláh:

1. O SON OF SPIRIT!

> My first counsel is this: Possess a pure, kindly and
> radiant heart, that thine may be a sovereignty ancient,
> imperishable and everlasting. [AHW 1]

Placing the transference of Freud and the transitional place
of Winnicott into the heart opens up a new understanding of
psychology and the remarkable feature is the fact that heart and
brain work together, are united in many ways but have
oppositional characteristics, which become obvious under
different questions. Additionally in the heart is no awareness,
so all what we know about it directly is communicated by the
awareness of the brain, that functions like an interpreter
translating the language of the heart into the language of the
brain. These two languages are quite different. All the logical
conditions, contradictions etc. which are part of the language
of the brain cannot be expressed in the heart, as we know from
our dreams, where the rule of contradiction does not apply, and
contradictions can only be expressed in contradicting pictures
placed next to each other.

Considering all of these ideas, which are at this point only
speculative and are at best extensions and augmentation of
known facts, much work has to be done until these ideas can be
fully worked out. What can be said at this point without
exaggeration is that the understanding of psychology is at its
beginning and psychology is a scientific enterprise that has not
reached full understanding today. Since these new
understanding of the self and of the function of the heart were
first expressed in the Bahá’í Writings, such a psychology could
justifiably called a “Bahá’í Psychology.”
