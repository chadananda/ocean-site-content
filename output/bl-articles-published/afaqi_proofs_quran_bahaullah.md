Preface
The advent of a Manifestation of God is a very significant
event in history. It is a milestone in the evolutionary progress of
the human society. In fact, the Manifestation of God is a spiritual
Sun which gives spiritual life to mankind. He revives the foundation
of Faith and belief in God. He bestows new capacities and explores
new potentialities of men, and thus, actually, He creates a new
race of man.

The physical sun is a proof of its own self and does not
require any outside proof for its validity. Even those who cannot
see the sun can, at least, perceive it by its heat. Likewise, the
Spiritual Sun does not require any outside evidence to prove its
validity. No one else but a Manifestation of God Himself is able
to show the quality of life, character and influence required of
such a high station.

Apart from the evidences shown through His life and
teachings there is another proof of His validity which is equally
important for Him to show—proofs from the Books of the past
Manifestations. Thus He has to satisfy the hearts as well as the
minds.

Bahá’u’lláh has satisfied both of the above-mentioned
requirements. Thousands of Muslims, Christians, Jews,
Zoroastrians, Hindus, Buddhists and Sikhs have recognised
Bahá’u’lláh as the one promised in their respective Holy Books
and Scriptures. On the other hand, those who did not believe in any
religion are also entering the fold of Bahá’u’lláh by accepting
Him as a Manifestation of God and Redeemer of mankind.

The Dispensation of Bahá’u’lláh has followed the period of
Islám and most of its early adherents and martyrs were from a
Muslim background and they have written many books in oriental
languages, regarding the validity of His claim according to the
Qur’án and the traditions of various sects of Islám.

ix
Since these works are scattered in various volumes and very
few of them are accessible to English readers, I felt that a book
containing the Quranic proofs regarding the advent of Bahá’u’lláh
was much needed in English—both for the deepening of the
knowledge of the friends and as a preparation for anticipated
mass-scale teaching among the Muslims. So in 1985, I wrote
about this idea to Dr. Peter Khán. He liked it very much and
encouraged me to work on this project. I had an opportunity of
meeting him in New Delhi in 1986 and sharing with him my ideas
regarding this work. He again encouraged me and guided me to
use the English translation of the Holy Qur’án made by ‘Abdu’lláh
Yúsuf ‘Alí, because he is an authentic translator and there is no
dispute regarding His translation. In the meanwhile, I received the
following words from the beloved International Teaching Centre:

“… regarding your plan to prepare a compilation of Quranic
> proofs to assist with teaching the Faith among the Muslims in
> Asia and Africa. This is an excellent idea and we look forward
to receiving a copy.”                             (21 August 1986)

Charged with these loving appreciations and encouragements
I set on my task. I decided to limit myself only to Quranic proofs
for two reasons. Firstly, because there are many traditions and all
the Muslims do not accept all the traditions. Secondly, because
there are ample proofs in the Qur’án itself regarding, not only the
advent of Bahá’u’lláh, but also regarding the appearance of the
Báb, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá and Shoghi Effendi and these will suffice to
satisfy any ardent Muslim seeker. I have included nine verses
from the Holy Qur’án in this book which stress that investigation
of truth is incumbent upon every one. I have also included a
compilation from Bahá’u’lláh’s Writings regarding His own station
and several articles to clarify some terminologies used in religious
scriptures and to remove their misunderstandings.

I feel it necessary to express my deep and loving thanks to
my dear daughter, Ṭáhirih, who has helped me a lot in collecting
relevant verses from the Qur’án and arranging other materials.
Also I must express my loving appreciation for my dear co-
worker, Shamshír ‘Alí, Auxiliary Board member, who has helped

x
me in writing and typing of the manuscript. Also I would like to
thank all those individuals and institutions who have helped me
in materialising my dream. My deepest thanks are to the beloved
International Teaching Centre and to Dr. Peter Khán for the
guidance which they have shown me in the compilation of this
book. I am also highly indebted to Dr. Peter Smith who has
reviewed the manuscript.

Proofs from the Holy Qur’án
Dr. Ṣábir Áfáqí’s scholarly study of the connection between
the prophetic statement of the Qur’án and the Bahá’í Faith is a
valuable contribution to an important subject. It will be of interest
to all who are interested in the relationship of the various great
religions of the world, and most especially to those who regard
the Qur’án as divine revelation and who approach the Bahá’í
Faith in a spirit of inquiry and with a mind unfettered by prejudice
and preconceived ideas.

This book leads its reader to a more profound study of the
Qur’án, and to a deeper appreciation of its limitless wisdom. It
casts new light on the intimate and indissoluble relationship
between the Qur’án and the Bahá’í Revelation, and resolves any
misconceptions which might exist about the attitude which Bahá’ís
hold toward Islám.

Much of the material presented in this book had previously
been inaccessible in the English language. This volume is enhanced
by the systematic approach that Dr. Áfáqí has adopted, and by
the breadth of learning with which he is able to illuminate the
wide range of subjects treated therein.

The Qur’án
The Qur’án is full of symbolic materials, contrary to what
is thought by those Sunní interpreters who consider all mutashábih
verses in the Qur’án as temptation. For instance, in Qur’án 7:53:
“Do they just wait for its (the Qur’án’s) interpretation (ta’víl)?
But on the day in which the interpretation will come, they … will
say …”

Thus, according to the scripture, at the end of the world
there will occur that symbolic interpretation of the Qur’án, the
end of the time of Muḥammad.

Every end of the world is tied to a holy Book. In Qur’án
13:38, is said: “We did send apostles before thee, and appointed
for them wives and children, and it was never the part of an
apostle to bring a Sign except as God permitted. For each end of
a period there is a Book (li-kulli ajalin kitábun).”

Those who refuse to accept here ajal (in the sense of the end
of a period, end of a prophetic cycle, fixed term in the life, or end
of an umma, a sense clearly indicated by parallel passages) are
compelled to declare this passage incomprehensible or to force
the obvious sense of ajal. In reality, the only explanation is that
Muḥammad felt the coming of the Prophet at a period of the end
of the preceding umma, to be a judgement on this umma.

The Holy Qur’án says
“And when Our clear verses are recited to them those who
have no hope of meeting with us say: bring a Qur’án other than
this or change it …”                               (Qur’án, 10:15)

“Surely this Qur’án guides to that which is most upright and
gives the glad tiding to the believers who work deeds of right
courses, that they shall have a magnificent reward.”

(Qur’án, 17:9)
“And We have explained to man, in this Qur’án, every kind
of similitude: yet the greater part of men refuse (to receive it)
except with ingratitude!”                             (Qur’án, 17:89)

“Say: whether ye believe in it or not, it is what those who
were given knowledge beforehand, when it is recited to them,
fall down on their faces in humble prostration, and say; glory
to our Lord, truly the promise of our Lord was to be fulfilled!”

(Qur’án, 17:107–108)
“Then the Apostle will say; O my Lord truly my people treat
this Qur’án as a forsaken thing …”                (Qur’án, 25:30)

“Those who, when they are admonished with the Revelations
of their Lord, droop not down at them as if they were deaf or
blind:”                                            (Qur’án, 25:73)

“Alláh faileth not His promise, but most of mankind know
not.”                                               (Qur’án, 30:6)

“Those who listen to the Word, and follow the best (meaning)
in it: those are the ones whom Alláh has guided, and those are the
ones endued with understanding.”                   (Qur’án, 39:18)

“These are the verses of Alláh which we recite to thee with
truth. In what announcement will they then believe after Alláh
and His signs.”                                      (Qur’án, 45:6)

From the Writings of Bahá’u’lláh
O followers of the Bayán! Fear ye the All-Merciful. This is
> the One Who hath been glorified by Muḥammad, the Apostle of
> God, and before Him by the Spirit (Jesus) and yet before Him by
> the One Who discoursed with God (Moses). This is the Point of
> the Bayán calling aloud before the Throne, saying: By the
> righteousness of God, ye have been created to glorify this Most
> Great Announcement, this Perfect Way which lay hid within the
> souls of the Prophets, which was treasured in the hearts of the
chosen ones of God and was written down by the glorious Pen of

*
your Lord, the Possessor of Names.                 (WOB, p. 221).

I am the one, O Lord, whose heart and soul, whose limbs,
> whose inner and outer tongue testify to Thy unity and Thy oneness,
> and bear witness that Thou art God and that there is no God but
> Thee. Thou didst bring mankind into being to know Thee and to
> serve Thy Cause, that their station might thereby be elevated
> upon Thine earth and their souls be uplifted by virtue of the
> things Thou hast revealed in Thy Scriptures, Thy Books and Thy
Tablets.                                             (WOB, p. 225)

O Lord! The tongue of my tongue and the heart of my heart
> and the spirit of my spirit and my outward and inmost beings
> bear witness to Thy unity and Thy oneness, Thy power and Thine
> omnipotence, Thy grandeur and Thy sovereignty, and attest Thy
> glory, loftiness and authority. I testify that Thou art God and that
> there is none other God besides Thee. From everlasting Thou hast
> been a treasure hidden from the sight and minds of men and shalt
> continue to remain the same for ever and ever. The powers of
> earth can never frustrate Thee, nor can the might of the nations
> alarm Thee. Thou art the one who hath unlocked the door of
> knowledge before the faces of Thy servants that they may recognize
> Him Who is the Day-Star of Thy Revelation, the Dawning-Place
> of Thy signs, the Heaven of Thy manifestation and the Sun of
> Thy divine beauty.                                     (WOB, p. 227)

> Writings of Bahá’u’lláh—a compilation, published by Bahá’í Publishing Trust,
India.

Vain imaginings have withheld them from Him Who is the
Self-Subsisting. They speak as prompted by their own caprices,
and understand not. Among them are those who have said: ‘Have
the verses been sent down?’ Say ‘Yea, by Him Who is the Lord
of the heavens!’ ‘Hath the Hour come?’ ‘Nay, more; it hath
passed, by Him Who is the Revealer of clear tokens! Verily, the
Inevitable is come, and He, the True One, hath appeared with
proof and testimony. The Plain is disclosed, and mankind is sore
vexed and fearful. Earth-quakes have broken loose, and the tribes
have lamented, for fear of God, the Lord of Strength, the All-
Compelling.’ Say: ‘The stunning trumpet-blast hath been loudly
raised, and the Day is God’s, the One, the Unconstrained.’ And
they say:’ Hath the Catastrophe come to pass?’ Say: ‘Yea, by the
Lord of Lords!’ ‘Is the Resurrection come?’ ‘Nay, more; He Who
is the Self-Subsisting hath appeared with the Kingdom of His
signs.’ ‘Seest thou men laid low?’ ‘Yea, by my Lord, the Most
High, the Most Glorious!’ ‘Have the tree-stumps been uprooted?’
‘Yea, more; the mountains have been scattered in dust; by Him
the Lord of attributes!’ They say: ‘Where is Paradise, and where
is Hell?’ Say: ‘The one is reunion with Me; the other thine own
self, O thou who dost associate a partner with God and doubtest.’
They say: ‘We see not the Balance.’ Say: ‘Surely, by my Lord,
the God of Mercy! None can see it except such as are endued
with insight.’ They say: ‘Have the stars fallen?’ Say: ‘Yea, when
He Who is the Self-Subsisting dwelt in the Land of Mystery
(Adrianople). Take heed, ye who are endued with discernment!’
‘All the signs appeared when we drew forth the Hand of Power
from the bosom of majesty and might. Verily, the Crier hath cried
out, when the promised time came, and they that have recognized
the splendours of Sinai have swooned away in the wilderness of
hesitation, before the awful majesty of thy Lord, the Lord of
creation. The trumpet asketh: ‘Hath the Bugle been sounded?’
Say: ‘Yea, by the King of Revelation! when He mounted the
throne of His Name, the All-Merciful.’ Darkness hath been chased
away by the dawning light of the mercy of thy Lord, the Source
of all light. The breeze of the All-Merciful hath wafted, and the
souls have been quickened in the tombs of their bodies. Thus hath
the decree been fulfilled by God, the Mighty, the Beneficent.

(WOB, p. 229)

In response to thy request the Pen of Glory hath graciously
described the stations and grades of the Most Great Infallibility.
The purpose is that all should know of a certainty that the Seal
of the Prophets (Muḥammad)—may the souls of all else but Him
be offered up for His Sake—is without likeness, peer or partner
in His Own station. The Holy Ones (The Imáms)—may the
blessings of God be upon them were created through the potency
of His Word, and after Him they were the most learned and the
most distinguished among the people and abide in the utmost
station of servitude. The divine Essence, sanctified from every
comparison and likeness, is established in the Prophet, and God’s
inmost Reality, exalted above any peer or partner, is manifest in
Him. This is the station of true unity and veritable singleness.

(WOB, p. 232)
Blessing and peace be upon Him (Muḥammad) through
Whose advent Baṭḥá (Mecca) is wreathed in smiles, and the sweet
savours of Whose raiment have shed fragrance upon all mankind
—He Who came to protect men from that which would harm them
into the world below. Exalted, immensely exalted is His station
above the glorification of all beings and sanctified from the praise
of the entire creation. Through His advent the tabernacle of stability
and order was raised throughout the world and the ensign of
knowledge hoisted among the nations. May blessings rest also
upon His kindred and His companions through whom the standard
of the unity of God and of His singleness was uplifted and the
banners of celestial triumph were unfurled. Through them the
religion of God was firmly established among His creatures and
His Name magnified amidst His servants. I entreat Him—exalted
is He—to shield His Faith from the mischief of His enemies who
tore away the veils, rent them asunder and finally caused the
banner of Islám to be reversed amongst all peoples.

Thy letter from which the fragrance of reunion was inhaled
hath been received. Praised be God that following the firm decree
of separation, the breeze of nearness and communion hath been
stirred and the soil of the heart is refreshed with the waters of joy
and gladness. We offer thanksgiving unto God in all circumstances
and cherish the hope that He—exalted be His glory—may

through His gracious providence guide all who dwell on earth
towards that which is acceptable and pleasing unto Him.

(WOB, p. 251)
Say, God is my witness! The Promised One Himself hath
come down from heaven, seated upon the crimson cloud with the
hosts of revelation on His right, and the angels of inspiration on
His left, and the Decree hath been fulfilled at the behest of God,
the Omnipotent, the Almighty. Thereupon the footsteps of everyone
have slipped except such as God hath protected through His
tender mercy and numbered with those who have recognized Him
through His Own Self and detached themselves from all that
pertaineth to the world.                              (WOB, p. 262)

Know thou moreover that in the Day of His Manifestation
all created things besides God shall be brought forth and placed
equally, irrespective of their rank being high or low. The Day of
Return is inscrutable unto all men until after the divine Revelation
hath been fulfilled. He is in truth the One Who ordaineth
whatsoever He willeth. When the Word of God is revealed unto
all created things whoso then giveth ear and heedeth the Call is,
indeed, reckoned among the most distinguished souls, though he
be a carrier of ashes. And he who turneth away is accounted as
the lowliest of His servants, though he be a ruler amongst men
and the possessor of all the books that are in the heavens and on
earth.                                                 (WOB, p. 264)

O Shaykh! I swear by the Sun of Truth Which hath risen
and shineth above the horizon of this Prison! The betterment of
the world hath been the sole aim of this Wronged one. Unto this
beareth witness every man of judgement, of discernment, of insight
and understanding. Whilst afflicted with trials, He held fast unto
the cord of patience and fortitude, and was satisfied with the
things which have befallen Him at the hands of His enemies, and
was crying out: ‘I have renounced My desire for Thy desire, O
my God, and My will for the revelation of Thy Will. By Thy
glory! I desire neither Myself nor My life except for the purpose
of serving Thy Cause, and I love not My being save I may
sacrifice it in Thy path’.                            (WOB, p. 320)

O, King of Paris! Tell the priest to ring the bells no longer.

By God, the True One! The Most Mighty Bell hath appeared in
the form of Him Who is the Most Great Name, and the fingers
of the will of Thy Lord, the Most Exalted, the Most High, toll it
out in the heaven of Immortality, in His name, the All-Glorious.
Thus have the mighty verses of Thy Lord been again sent down
unto thee, that thou mayest arise to remember God, the Creator
of earth and heaven in these days when all the tribes of the earth
have mourned, and the foundations of the cities have trembled,
and the dust of irreligion hath enwrapped all men, except such as
God, the All-knowing, the All-Wise, was pleased to spare. Say:
He Who is the Unconditioned is come, in the clouds of light, that
He may quicken all created things with the breezes of His Name,
the Most Merciful, and unify the world, and gather all men around
this Table which hath been sent down from heaven. Beware that
ye deny not the favour of God after it hath been sent down unto
you. Better is this for you than that which ye possess; for that
which is yours perisheth, whilst that which is with God endureth.
He, in truth, ordaineth what He pleaseth. Verily, the breezes of
forgiveness have been wafted from the direction of your Lord, the
God of Mercy; whoso turneth thereunto, shall be cleansed of his
sins, and of all pain and sickness. Happy the man that hath
turned towards them, and woe betide him that hath turned aside.

(WOB, pp. 324–25)
“O Czar of Russia! Incline thine ear unto the voice of God,
the King, the Holy, and turn thou unto Paradise, the Spot wherein
abideth He Who, among the Concourse on high, beareth the most
excellent titles and Who, in the kingdom of creation, is called by
the name of God, the Effulgent, the All-Glorious. Beware that
nothing deter thee from setting thy face towards thy Lord, the
Compassionate, the Most Merciful.                    (WOB, p. 329)

O Shaykh! Every time God the True One—exalted be his
glory revealed Himself in the person of His Manifestation, He
came unto men with the standard of “He doeth what He willeth,
and ordaineth what He pleaseth.” None hath the right to ask why
or wherefore, and he that doth so, hath indeed turned aside from
God, the Lord of Lords.                              (WOB, p. 334)

O Shaykh! Peruse that which Isaiah hath spoken in His

> Book. He saith: “Get thee up into the high mountain, O Zion, that
> bringest good tidings; lift up Thy Voice with strength, O Jerusalem,
> that bringest good tidings. Lift it up, be not afraid; say unto the
> cities of Judah: ‘Behold your God! Behold the Lord God will
> come with strong hand, and His arm shall rule for Him.’ This
> Day all the signs have appeared. A Great City hath descended
> from heaven, and Zion trembleth and exulteth with joy at the
> Revelation of God, for it hath heard the Voice of God on every
> side. This Day Jerusalem hath attained unto a new Evangel, for
> in the stead of the sycamore standeth the cedar. Jerusalem is the
> place of pilgrimage for all the peoples of the world, and hath been
> named the Holy City. Together with Zion and Palestine, they are
> all included within these regions. Wherefore, hath it been said:
“Blessed is the man that hath migrated to ‘Akká.”

Amos saith: “The Lord will roar from Zion, and utter His
> Voice from Jerusalem, and the habitations of the shepherds shall
> mourn, and the top of Carmel shall wither.” Carmel, in the Book
> of God, hath been designated as the Hill of God, and His Vineyard.
> It is here that, by the grace of the Lord of Revelation, the
> Tabernacle of Glory hath been raised. Happy are they that attain
> thereunto; happy they that set their faces towards it. And likewise
He saith: “Our God will come, and He will not be silent.”

O Shaykh! Reflect upon these words addressed by Him Who
> is the Desire of the world to Amos. He saith: “Prepare to meet
> thy God, O Israel, for, lo, He that formeth the mountains and
> createth the wind, and declareth unto man what is his thought,
> that maketh the morning darkness, and treadeth upon the high
> places of the earth, the Lord, the God of Hosts, is His name.” He
> saith that He maketh the morning darkness. By this is meant that
> if, at the time of the Manifestation of Him Who conversed on
> Sinai anyone were to regard himself as the true morn, he will,
> through the might and power of God, be turned into darkness. He
> truly is the false dawn though believing himself to be the true
> one. Woe unto him, and woe unto such as follow him without a
> clear token from God, the Lord of the worlds.

Isaiah saith: “The Lord alone shall be exalted in that Day.”
Concerning the greatness of the Revelation He saith: “Enter into
the rock, and hide thee in the dust, for fear of the Lord, and for
the glory of His majesty.” And in another connection He saith:
“The wilderness and the solitary place shall be glad for them; and
the desert shall rejoice, and blossom as the rose. It shall blossom
abundantly, and rejoice even with joy and singing: the glory of
Lebanon shall be given unto it, the splendour of Carmel and
Sharon, they shall see the glory of the Lord, and the splendour of
our God.”                                              (WOB, p. 368)

The Revelation which, from time immemorial, hath been
acclaimed as the Purpose and Promise of all the Prophets of God,
and the most cherished Desire of His Messengers, hath now, by
virtue of the pervasive Will of the Almighty and at His irresistible
bidding, been revealed unto men. The advent of such a Revelation
hath been heralded in all the sacred Scriptures. Behold how,
notwithstanding such an announcement, mankind hath strayed
from its path and shut out itself from its glory. (WOB, p. 388)

This is the Day in which God’s most excellent favours have
been poured out upon men, the Day in which His most mighty
grace hath been infused into all created things. It is incumbent
upon all the peoples of the world to reconcile their differences,
and with perfect unity and peace, abide beneath the shadow of the
Tree of His care and loving-kindness.                  (WOB, p. 388)

This is the Day whereon the Ocean of God’s mercy hath
been manifested unto men, the Day in which the Day-Star of His
loving kindness hath shed its radiance upon them, the Day in
which the clouds of His bountiful favour have overshadowed the
whole of mankind. Now is the time to cheer and refresh the
down-cast through the invigorating breeze of love and fellowship,
and the living waters of friendliness and charity.  (WOB, p. 389)

Behold, how the divers peoples and kindreds of the earth
have been waiting for the coming of the Promised One. No sooner
had He, Who is the Sun of Truth, been made manifest, than, lo,

all turned away from Him, except them whom God was pleased
to guide. We dare not, in this Day, lift the veil that concealeth the
exalted station which every true believer can attain, for the joy
which such a revelation must provoke might well cause a few to
faint away and die.                                     (WOB, p. 390)

Verily I say, this is the Day in which mankind can behold
the Face, and hear the Voice, of the Promised One. The Call of
God hath been raised, and the light of His countenance hath been
lifted up upon men. It behoveth every man to blot out the trace
of every idle word from the tablet of his heart, and to gaze, with
an open and unbiased mind, on the signs of His Revelation, the
proofs of His Mission, and the tokens of His glory.

Great indeed is this Day! The allusions made to it in all the
sacred Scriptures as the Day of God attest its greatness. The soul
of every Prophet of God, of every Divine Messenger, hath thirsted
for this wondrous Day. All the divers kindreds of the earth have,
likewise, yearned to attain it. No sooner, however, had the Day-
Star of His Revelation manifested itself in the heaven of God’s
Will, than all, except those whom the Almighty was pleased to
guide, were found dumbfounded and heedless. (WOB, p. 390)

O Ḥusayn! Consider the eagerness with which certain peoples
and nations have anticipated the return of Imám-Ḥusayn whose
coming, after the appearance of the Qá’im, hath been prophesied,
in days past, by the chosen ones of God, exalted be His glory.
These holy ones have, moreover, announced that when He Who
is the Dayspring of the manifold grace of God manifesteth Himself,
all the Prophets and Messengers, including the Qá’im, will gather
together beneath the shadow of the sacred Standard which the
Promised One will raise. That hour is now come. The world is
illumined with the effulgent glory of His countenance.

(WOB, p. 391)
The time fore-ordained unto the peoples and kindreds of the
earth is now come. The promises of God, as recorded in the holy
Scriptures, have all been fulfilled. Out of Zion hath gone forth the
Law of God, and Jerusalem, and the hills and land thereof, are

filled with the glory of His Revelation. Happy is the man that
pondereth in his heart that which hath been revealed in the Books
of God, the Help in Peril, the Self-Subsisting. Meditate upon this,
O ye beloved of God, and let your ears be attentive unto His
Word, so that ye may, by His grace and mercy, drink your fill
from the crystal waters of constancy, and become as steadfast
and immovable as the mountain in His Cause. (WOB, p. 391)

All glory be to this Day, the Day in which the fragrances of
mercy have been wafted over all created things, a Day so blest
that past ages and centuries can never hope to rival it, a Day in
which the countenance of the Ancient of Days hath turned towards
His holy seat. Thereupon the voices of all created things, and
beyond them those of the Concourse on high, were heard calling
aloud: “Haste thee, O Carmel, for lo, the light of the countenance
of God, the Ruler of the Kingdom of Names and Fashioner of
heavens, hath been lifted upon thee.”                 (WOB, p. 392)

Bestir yourselves, O people, in anticipation of the days of
Divine justice, for the promised hour is now come. Beware lest
ye fail to apprehend its import and be accounted among the erring.

Consider the past. How many, both high and low, have, at
all times yearningly awaited the advent of the Manifestations of
God in the sanctified persons of His chosen Ones. How often
have they expected His coming, how frequently have they prayed
that the breeze of Divine mercy might blow, and the promised
Beauty step forth from behind the veil of concealment, and be
made manifest to all the world. And whensoever the portals of
grace did open, and the clouds of divine bounty did rain upon
mankind, and the light of the Unseen did shine above the horizon
of celestial might, they all denied Him, and turned away from His
face—the face of God Himself …                       (WOB, p. 393)

By Him Who is the Great Announcement! The All-Merciful
is come invested with undoubted sovereignty. The Balance hath
been appointed, and all them that dwell on earth have been gathered
together. The Trumpet hath been blown, and lo, all eyes have

stared up with terror, and the hearts of all who are in the heavens
and on the earth have trembled, except them whom the breath of
the verses of God hath quickened, and who have detached
themselves from all things.

This is the Day whereon the earth shall tell out her tidings.

The workers of iniquity are her burdens, could ye but perceive it.
The moon of idle fancy hath been cleft, and the heaven hath given
out a palpable smoke. We see the people laid low, awed with the
dread of thy Lord, the Almighty, the Most Powerful. The Crier
hath cried out, and men have been torn away, so great hath been
the fury of His wrath. The people of the left hand sigh and
bemoan. The people of the right abide in noble habitations: they
quaff the Wine that is life indeed, from the hands of the All-
Merciful, and are, verily, the blissful.

The earth hath been shaken, and the mountains have passed
away, and the angels have appeared, rank on rank, before us.
Most of the people are bewildered in their drunkenness and wear
on their faces the evidences of anger. Thus have We gathered
together the workers of iniquity. We see them rushing on towards
their idol. Say: None shall be secure this Day from the decree of
God. This indeed is a grievous Day. We point out to them those
that led them astray. They see them, and yet recognize them not.
Their eyes are drunken; they are indeed a blind people. Their
proofs are the calumnies they uttered; condemned are their
calumnies by God, the Help in Peril, the Self-Subsisting. The
Evil One hath stirred up mischief in their hearts, and they are
afflicted with a torment that none can avert. They hasten to the
wicked, bearing the register of the workers of iniquity. Such are
their doings.

Say: The heavens have been folded together, and the earth
is held within His grasp, and the corrupt-doers have been held by
their forelock, and still they understand not. They drink of the
tainted water, and know it not. Say: The shout hath been raised,
and the people have come forth from their graves, and arising, are
gazing around them. Some have made haste to attain the court of
the God of Mercy, others have fallen down on their faces in the

fire of Hell, while still others are lost in bewilderment. The verses
of God have been revealed, and yet they have turned away from
them. His proof hath been manifested, and yet they are unaware
of it. And when they behold the face of the All-Merciful, their
own faces are saddened, while they are disporting themselves.
They hasten forward to Hell Fire, and mistake it for light. Far
from God be what they fondly imagine! Say: Whether ye rejoice
or whether ye burst for fury, the heavens are cleft asunder, and
God hath come down, invested with radiant sovereignty. All created
things are heard exclaiming: “The Kingdom is God’s, the Almighty,
the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.”                   (WOB, pp. 403–404)

The thing that must come hath come suddenly; behold how
they flee from it! The inevitable hath come to pass; witness how
they have cast it behind their backs! This is the Day whereon
every man will fly from himself, how much more from his kindred,
could ye but perceive it. Say: By God! The blast hath been blown
on the trumpet, and lo, mankind hath swooned away before us!
The Herald hath cried out, and the Summoner raised His voice
saying: “The Kingdom is God’s, the Most Powerful, the Help in
Peril, the Self-Subsisting.”

This is the Day on which all eyes shall stare up with terror,
the Day in which the hearts of them that dwell on earth shall
tremble, save them whom thy Lord, the All-Knowing, the All-
Wise, pleaseth to deliver. All faces have turned black except
those to whom the God of Mercy hath vouchsafed a radiant heart.
Drunken are the eyes of those men that have openly refused to
behold the face of God, the All-Glorious, the All-Praised.

Say: Perused ye not the Qur’án? Read it, that haply ye may
find the Truth, for this Book is verily the Straight Path. This is
the Way of God unto all who are in the heavens and all who are
on the earth. If ye have been careless of the Qur’án, the Bayán
cannot be regarded to be remote from you. Behold it open before
your eyes. Read ye its verses, that perchance ye desist from
committing that which will cause the Messengers of God to mourn
and lament.

Speed out of your sepulchres. How long will ye sleep? The
second blast hath been blown on the trumpet. On whom are ye
gazing? This is your Lord, the God of Mercy. Witness how ye
gainsay His signs! The earth hath quaked with a great quaking,
and cast forth her burdens. Will ye not admit it? Say: Will ye not
recognize how the mountains have become like flocks of wool,
how the people are sore vexed at the awful majesty of the Cause
of God? Witness how their houses are empty ruins, and they
themselves a drowned host.                          (WOB, p. 405)

Know thou of a certainty that the Unseen can in no wise
incarnate His Essence and reveal it unto men. He is, and hath
ever been, immensely exalted beyond all that scan either be
recounted or perceived. From His retreat of glory His voice is
ever proclaiming: “Verily, I am God; there is none other God
besides Me, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise. I have manifested
myself unto men and have sent down Him Who is the Dayspring
of the signs of My Revelation. Through Him I have caused all
creation to testify that there is none other God except Him, the
Incomparable, the All-Informed, the All-Wise.” He Who is
everlastingly hidden from the eyes of men can never be known
except through His Manifestation, and His Manifestation can
adduce no greater proof of the truth of His Mission than the
proof of His own person.                              (WOB, p. 407)

The Bearers of the Trust of God are made manifest unto the
peoples of the earth as the Exponents of a new Cause and
the Revealers of a new Message. In as much as these Birds
of the celestial Throne are all sent down from the heaven of
the Will of God, and as they all arise to proclaim His
irresistible Faith, they, therefore, are regarded as one soul
and the same person. For they all drink from the one Cup of the
love of God, and all partake of the fruit of the same Tree of
Oneness.                                                (WOB, p. 408)

It is evident that every age in which a Manifestation of God
hath lived is divinely ordained, and may, in a sense, be
characterized as God’s appointed Day. This Day, however, is
unique, and is to be distinguished from those that have preceded

it. The designation “Seal of the Prophets” fully revealeth its high
station. The Prophetic Cycle hath, verily, ended. The Eternal
Truth is now come. He hath lifted up the Ensign of Power, and
is now shedding upon the world the unclouded splendour of His
Revelation.                                          (WOB, p. 412)

The purpose of God in creating man hath been, and will ever
be, to enable him to know his Creator and to attain His Presence.
To this most excellent aim, this supreme objective, all the heavenly
Books and the divinely-revealed and weighty Scriptures
unequivocally bear witness. Whoso hath recognized the Dayspring
of Divine guidance and entered His holy court hath drawn nigh
unto God and attained His Presence, a Presence which is the real
Paradise, and of which the loftiest mansions of heaven are but a
symbol. Such a man hath attained the knowledge of the station of
Him Who is “at the distance of two bows,” Who standeth beyond
the Sadratu’l-Muntahá. Whoso hath failed to recognize Him will
have condemned himself to the misery of remoteness, a remoteness
which is naught but utter nothingness and the essence of the
nethermost fire. Such will be his fate, though to outward seeming
he may occupy the earth’s loftiest seats and be established upon
its most exalted throne.                             (WOB, p. 417)

O Jews! If ye be intent on crucifying once again Jesus, the
Spirit of God, put Me to death, for He hath once more, in My
person, been made manifest unto you. Deal with Me as ye wish,
for I have vowed to lay down My life in the path of God. I will
fear no one, though the powers of earth and heaven be leagued
against Me. Followers of the Gospel! If ye cherish the desire to
slay Muḥammad, the Apostle of God, seize Me and put an end
to My life, for I am He, and My Self is His Self. Do unto Me
as you like, for the deepest longing of Mine heart is to attain the
presence of My Best-Beloved in His Kingdom of Glory, Such is
the Divine decree, if ye know it.                     (WOB, p. 430)

Say: This is the Day when every ear must needs be attentive
to His voice. Hearken ye to the Call of this wronged One, and
magnify ye the name of the one true God, and adorn yourselves
with the ornament of His remembrance, and illumine your hearts

with the light of His love. This is the key that unlocketh the
hearts of men, the burnish that shall cleanse the souls of all
beings. He that is careless of what hath poured out from the
finger of the Will of God liveth in manifest error.

(WOB, p. 476–477)
O kings of the earth! He Who is the sovereign Lord of all
is come. The Kingdom is God’s, the omnipotent Protector, the
Self-Subsisting. Worship none but God, and, with radiant hearts,
lift up your faces unto your Lord, the Lord of all names. This is
a Revelation to which whatever ye possess can never be compared,
could ye but know it.                                (WOB, p. 479)

This is the Day in which He Who held converse with God
hath attained the light of the Ancient of Days, and quaffed the
pure waters of reunion from this Cup that hath caused the seas
to swell. Say: By the one true God! Sinai is circling round the
Dayspring of Revelation, while from the heights of the Kingdom
the Voice of the Spirit of God is heard proclaiming: “Bestir
yourselves, ye proud ones of the earth, and hasten ye unto Him.”
Carmel hath, in this Day, hastened in longing adoration to attain
His court, whilst from the heart of Zion there cometh the cry:
“The promise is fulfilled. That which had been announced in the
holy Writ of God, the most Exalted, the Almighty, the Best-
Beloved, is made manifest.”                          (WOB, p. 479)

Ye are but vassals, O kings of the earth! He Who is the
King of Kings hath appeared, arrayed in His most wondrous
glory, and is summoning you unto Himself, the Help in Peril, the
Self-Subsisting. Take heed lest pride deter you from recognizing
the Source of Revelation, lest the things of this world shut you
out as by a veil from Him Who is the Creator of heaven. Arise,
and serve Him Who is the Desire of all nations, Who hath created
you through a word from Him, and ordained you to be, for all
time, the emblems of His sovereignty.                 (WOB, p. 479)

The All-Knowing Physician hath His finger on the pulse of
mankind. He perceiveth the disease, and prescribeth, in His
unerring wisdom, the remedy. Every age hath its own problem,

and every soul its particular aspiration. The remedy the world
needeth in its present-day afflictions can never be the same as
that which a subsequent age may require. Be anxiously concerned
with the needs of the age ye live in, and centre your deliberations
on its exigencies and requirements.                   (WOB, p. 480)

The Great Being saith: O ye children of men! The
fundamental purpose animating the Faith of God and His Religion
is to safeguard the interests and promote the unity of the human
race, and to foster the spirit of love and fellowship amongst men.
Suffer it not to become a source of dissension and discord, of
hate and enmity. This is the straight Path, the fixed and immovable
foundation. Whatsoever is raised on this foundation, the changes
and chances of the world can never impair its strength, nor will
the revolution of countless centuries undermine its structure.

I am but a servant of God Who hath believed in Him and
in His signs, and in His Prophets and in His angels. My tongue,
and My heart, and My inner and My outer being testify that there
is no God but Him, that all others have been created by His
behest, and been fashioned through the operation of His Will.
There is none other God but Him, the Creator, the Raiser from
the dead, the Quickener, the Slayer. I am He that telleth abroad
the favours with which God hath, through His bounty, favoured
Me. If this be My transgression, then I am truly the first of the
transgressors.                                 (WOB, pp. 486–487)

O Dhabíḥ! The Tongue of Grandeur saith: By Myself that
speaketh the truth! In this most mighty Revelation all the
Dispensations of the past have attained their highest and final
consummation. Whoso layeth claim to a Revelation after Him,
such a man is assuredly a lying imposter. We pray God that He
may graciously assist him to retract and repudiate such claim.
Should he repent, God will no doubt forgive him. If, however, he
persisteth in his error, God will assuredly send down one who
will deal mercilessly with him. He, verily, is the Almighty, the
Most Powerful.                                        (WOB, p. 494)

O Kings of Christendom! Heard ye not the saying of Jesus,
the Spirit of God, “I go away, and come again unto you”?
Wherefore, then, did ye fail, when He did come again unto you
in the clouds of heaven, to draw nigh unto Him, that ye might
behold His face, and be of them that attained His Presence? In
another passage He saith: “When He, the Spirit of Truth, is
come, He will guide you into all truth.” And yet, behold how,
when He did bring the truth, ye refused to turn your faces towards
Him, and persisted in disporting yourselves with your pastimes
and fancies. Ye welcomed Him not, neither did ye seek His
Presence, that ye might hear the verses of God from His own
mouth, and partake of the manifold wisdom of the Almighty, the
All-Glorious, the All-Wise. Ye have, by reason of your failure,
hindered the breath of God from being wafted over you, and have
withheld from your souls the sweetness of its fragrance. Ye continue
roving with delight in the valley of your corrupt desires. Ye, and
all ye possess, shall pass away. Ye shall, most certainly, return
to God, and shall be called to account for your doings in the
presence of Him Who shall gather together the entire creation.

O ye rulers of the earth! Wherefore have ye clouded the
radiance of the Sun, and caused it to cease from shining? Hearken
unto the counsel given you by the Pen of the Most High, that
haply both ye and the poor may attain unto tranquillity and peace.
We beseech God to assist the kings of the earth to establish peace
on earth. He, verily, doth what He willeth.          (WOB, p. 498)

The first duty prescribed by God for His servants is the
recognition of Him Who is the Day spring of His Revelation and
the Fountain of His laws, Who representeth the Godhead in both
the Kingdom of His Cause and the world of creation. Whoso
achieveth this duty hath attained unto all good; and whoso is
deprived thereof, hath gone astray, though he be the author of
every righteous deed.                                (WOB, p. 532)

This is the Day, O my Lord, which Thou didst announce
unto all mankind as the Day whereon Thou wouldst reveal Thy
Self, and shed Thy radiance, and shine brightly over all Thy

creatures. Thou hast, moreover, entered into a covenant with
them, in Thy Books, and Thy Scriptures, and Thy Scrolls, and
Thy Tablets, concerning Him Who is the Dayspring of Thy
Revelation, and hast appointed the Bayán to be the Herald of this
Most Great and all-glorious Manifestation, and this most
resplendent and most sublime Appearance.            (WOB, p. 663)

Progressive Revelation
Human society is progressive. So is the religion of God and
His Revelation. The progressive revelation of God has been, and
will ever remain to be, the most effective tool for the guidance of
society.

The Almighty God has mentioned in the Holy Qur’án, His
irrevocable Law, that when an ‘ummah’ (nation) refuses and
rejects a Messenger of God and indulges in sin, cruelty and
injustice, a new ‘ummah’ is raised to replace it. One may ask that
how this changeover was effected in the past. How an ‘ummah’
was destroyed? It looks that it had never been a total annihilation
of a people from the surface of the earth. Rather they were caught
by disunity, passiveness and indulgence which gradually crept
into the ranks and files of that ‘ummah’

The Holy Qur’án narrates many types of divine chastisements
which befell the rebellious ‘ummah’. Some of them were disunity,
the formation of sects, war and fighting, ignorance, mistrust,
misunderstanding between people, fear of each other, rejection of
God’s Messengers, pride and cruelty, lust and greed, murder,
plundering, materialism, prejudice, revenge, superstition, hypocrisy,
and blind imitation.

No one who has had even a cursory glance of the present-
day Muslim society can deny the fact that each one of the signs
of divine chastis[]ments mentioned above, nay even more than those
signs, can be seen in it. What an irony that none of the Muslims
will accept that these are divine chastisements. He will say that
when the divine chastis[]ment fell upon the past nations the faces
of the people were mutilated, lightning fell upon them all of a
sudden, they sank into the earth or they were turned into monkeys.
Then they will say that we are the followers of Muḥammad,
therefore no such atrocity can befall us. Thus they claim an
exception for themselves. However it is not at all reasonable and
fair according to the Holy Qur’án. In fact, neither the past nations
suffered from any unnatural devastation, nor are the Muslims

exempted from a similar fate to that of the past nations when they
fell from the Straight Path. The Holy Qur’án answers very clearly
such questions: Why the past nations were cursed by God. How
the Divine chastisement befell them. And how they met their doom.
The Qur’án declares that an ‘ummah’ faces divine
chastisement when:
1\.    It, instead of establishing of a just economic order, indulges
in luxury, laxity and immorality;

“… but We destroyed those who transgressed beyond
bounds.”                                         (Qur’án, 21:9)
2\.    It rejects a Manifestation of God and disregards the bounty;

“As to those who reject faith, I will punish them with
terrible agony …”                                     (Qur’án, 3:56)
3\.    It indulges in hypocrisy;

“That Alláh may reward the men of truth for their truth
and punish the hypocrites if that be His Will.”

(Qur’án, 33:24)
4\.    It turns back from the Divine Call;

“… And he who turns back, (Alláh) will punish him with
a grievous penalty.”                              (Qur’án, 48:17)
5\.    It shows arrogance;

“But those who are disdainful and arrogant, He will punish
(them) with a grievous penalty.”                   (Qur’án, 4:173)
6\.    It transgresses the limits;

“After this whoever exceeds the limits shall be in grave
penalty.”                                           (Qur’án, 2:178)
7\.    Its people become wrong-doers;

“How many populations have We destroyed, which were
given to wrong doing! They tumbled down on their roofs.”

(Qur’án, 22:45)

“Such were the populations We destroyed when they
committed iniquities; …”                       (Qur’án, 18:59)
8\.    It indulges in vice and sins;

“See they not how many of those before them did We
destroy? … for their sins We destroyed them,..”

(Qur’án, 6:6)
9\.    It rejects the new Manifestation of God;

“So they rejected him (Húd), and We destroyed them.
Verily in this is a sign; but most of them do not believe.”
10\. It commonly commits crimes;

“And those who were before them, We destroyed them
because they were guilty and sinners …”        (Qur’án, 44:37)
11\. It creates sects and differences;

“Be not like those who are divided amongst themselves
> and fall into disputations after receiving Clear Signs: for them
> is a dreadful penalty.”                              (Qur’án, 3:105)
12\. It loses hope in the mercy of God;

“Those who reject the signs of Alláh and the meeting
> with Him, it is they who shall despair of My mercy: it is they
> who will (suffer) a most grievous penalty.” (Qur’án, 29:33)
13\. It commits terrorism and violence;

“The blame is only against those who oppress men with
> wrong-doing and insolently transgress beyond bounds through
> the land, defying right and justice: for (those) such there will
> be a penalty grievous.”                               (Qur’án, 42:42)
> In the light of above-quoted verses, it is easy to decide whether
or not all the above-mentioned signs are present in the present-
day Muslim society. Undoubtedly they are present. Then how is
it that this society is not being subjected to the same infamy and
chastisement as was inflicted upon the past nations under similar
conditions? As a matter of fact, they are engulfed from head to

> toe in the above-mentioned chastisements. But they have lost the
sense of realisation and think that everything is all right and that
they are immune of atrocities, beloved of God and will remain
such for ever:

“The Jews and the Christians say: ‘we are sons of Alláh
> and his beloved.’ Say: ‘Why then Both He punish you for
your sins?’”                                       (Qur’án, 5:20)

In the past ages God has ruined and annihilated many nations.

People think that a sudden lightning fell upon them and all the
people vanished. It is not correct, however. By ‘annihilation’ is
meant that a nation becomes spiritually dead and morally bankrupt.
Then a new nation, which is better than the previous one—in
respect of knowledge, practices, and struggle of life—takes its
place. The Holy Qur’án calls this process ‘Istikhláf’, (Law of
Succession of Prophets). It began, according to the Holy Qur’án,
with the advent of Adam and has continued ever since. None of
the nations is an exception in this regard. If a Muslim exempts
himself from this law, he actually rejects the Holy Qur’án:

“… or have ye covenants with Us on oath, reaching to the
day of judgement that ye shall have whatever ye shall demand?”
Another term for ‘Istikhláf’ is ‘Al-Qiyámah’ (resurrection).

When a nation attains to its spiritual death and becomes the
recipient of divine chastisement, God bestows His mercy on some
of the people from the same nation and from other nations. They
are guided to believe in His new Manifestation and thus become
better and pious. It is in this way that a new creation is brought
into being and a new nation is raised. Thus when a nation
completes its period and reaches its end—a new one begins to
take shape. The following verses of the Holy Qur’án explain this
phenomenon very clearly:

“And for their sins We destroyed them, and raised in
their wake fresh generation (to succeed them) …”

“We did reveal to Moses the Book after We had destroyed
the earlier generations …”                       (Qur’án, 28:43)

And what a clear warning is served to the Muslims that God
will bring a new nation in its (Muslims’) place whenever He will
like:

“Thy Lord is Self-sufficient, full of Mercy: if it were His
> Will, He could destroy you, and in your place appoint whom
> He will as your successors, even as He raised you up from the
posterity of other people.”                          (Qur’án, 6:133)

The Muslims normally argue that by ‘rising up’ is meant
that the dead bodies will be raised up from their graves at the
time of resurrection. However, this meaning contradicts the
following verse of the Holy Qur’án:

“… He (Ṣáliḥ) said: ‘O people! worship Alláh: ye have
> no other God but Him. It is He Who hath produced (raised)
you from the earth and settled you therein: …”

(Qur’án 11:61)
It is obvious that the people of ‘Thamúd’ were not raised
(produced) from the earth as the plants. In another verse of the
Holy Qur’án it is thus mentioned:

“… He knows you well when He brings you out of the
earth, and when ye are hidden in your mother’s wombs …”
Here, as well, by raising out of the earth is meant a new
birth in a Dispensation and after the advent of a new Manifestation
of God. As the earth becomes fresh and green after coming of
spring season, so is the case with the hearts and minds of men in
the day of the advent of a Manifestation of God. The earth of the
heart and spirit of man becomes fertilized and joyful. Therefore
the Holy Qur’án compares the latter with the former and says
that God is He Who brings men out of the earth:

“And Alláh has produced you from the earth, growing …”
Literarily speaking, God has never raised or produced any
people out of the earth like vegetables. Hence the meaning of
‘raising up’ (Khurúj) is the same as stated above. Every ‘ummah’
has gone through its resurrection which was brought about through
the advent of a new Revelation from God. The Muslims have also
experienced similar resurrection and they are aware of it:

“And ye know already the first form of creation: why
then do ye not celebrate His praises? …”          (Qur’án, 56:62)

If it was meant, as the exponents of Qur’án claim, raising
out of earth like vegetable, then God would have never said that
‘you know it.’

There have been two situations in which divine chastisement
has befallen any nation. One is when they commit minor mistakes
and sins and seek forgiveness of God, as soon as they realise it.
God forgives such shortcomings out of His mercy:

“We did deliver aforetime the children of Israel from
humiliating punishment …”                           (Qur’án, 44:30)

“He was not going to send it (punishment) whilst they
could ask for pardon.”                             (Qur’án, 8:33)

The second situation being that when the whole nation,
collectively, indulges in such atrocities and crimes that invite the
wrath of God. Among such grave sins is that the nation jokes and
mocks at the new Messenger of God and rejects His Proclamation,
teases Him and declares Him a false One. This is an unforgivable
sin. When a nation commits such a sin, God takes away from it
the leadership of people and replaces it with a new people. The
greatest of the chastisements of God is that a nation be deprived
of their leadership of the nations and lose the trust of God.

When humanity forgets its creator and the purpose of life in

this world and indulges in materialism, God sends, out of His
mercy, a Manifestation to awaken it and to provide it with a
chance to return to God. The people who accept the Manifestation
of God and correct themselves receive salvation and those who
reject Him and insist on their own ideas, become engulfed in
hardships and are punished severely. This is but evident divine
justice. If they were punished without warning, given by a
Manifestation of God, they would say that if God had warned us
we would have corrected ourselves:

“And if We had inflicted on them a penalty before this
> (warning), they would have said, ‘our Lord! if only Thou
> hadst sent us an Apostle, we should certainly have followed
Thy signs before we were humbled and put to shame’ …”
Therefore God, the Lord of all the worlds, has chosen that
> unless He sends a Messenger, He does not send chastisement:
> “… nor would We visit with Our wrath until We had sent
an apostle …”                                       (Qur’án, 17:15)

Thus coming of divine chastisement is conditioned with the
advent of a Messenger of God. Hence when the people asked
Prophet Muḥammad that when the divine chastisement will befall
i.e. when a new Messenger of God will make appearance. God
replied that it will come in one day which is, according to the
Islamic calendar, equal to one thousand years:

“… yet they ask thee to hasten on the punishment! But
> Alláh will not fail in His promise. Verily a Day in the sight of
thy Lord is like a thousand years of your reckoning …”
The history bears witness that just following the advent of
Bahá’u’lláh, during the mid nineteenth century and the following
century, the nations of the world have been afflicted with divine
chastisements one after another. They have seen the devastations
of two world wars, during the same period. Still the nations of the

world are engulfed in various types of hatred, disunity, wars,
terrorism, lawlessness, conspiracy, famine, poverty, deprivation,
ignorance, illiteracy, agitations, prostitutions of all types, luxury,
laxity, materialism and lust for power and many more of such
chastisements and wrath of God. They will remain prey to these
atrocities until they rise to the Divine Call of the Saviour of the
world, Bahá’u’lláh, and adjust their lives according to His
Teachings, Laws and Ordinances.

We conclude from the above arguments and verses of the
Holy Qur’án that the only way of salvation of all the peoples and
nations is to follow the Teachings of Bahá’u’lláh.

Some clarifications
Bahá’u’lláh is the Promised One of all Scriptures including
the Holy Qur’án. When this glad-tiding is shared with the Muslims,
they make many objections. These objections are, of course, not
new. Muḥammad had also to face many similar questions from
the people.

In this chapter we have attempted to clarify some of the
main objections raised by the Muslims. We will explain them in
the light of the Quranic teachings, point by point:
1\. Protection of Al-Dhikr (Qur’án)

“We have, without doubt, sent down the Message (Al-
Dhikr) and we will assuredly guard it.”          (Qur’án, 15:9)

In the light of the above verse the Muslims say that when
God has Himself promised to protect the Holy Qur’án, it is safe
for all times. No new Book is then needed. However a sincere
study of the Holy Qur’án reveals that the Book of Moses has also
been called ‘Al-Dhikr’:

“In the past We granted Moses and Aaron, the criterion
> (Furqán) and a light (Ḍíyá) and a Message (Al-Dhikr) for
those who would do right.”                        (Qur’án, 21:48)

The above verse makes it clear that the term ‘Message’ or
‘Al-Dhikr’ is not an exclusive term for the Qur’án only. Moreover
it says that the Book of Moses was criterion, light and Al-Dhikr.
But another Book was revealed by Christ after that of Moses. By
what logic the same God cannot reveal another Book after the
Qur’án?

God is Almighty and All-Powerful. No one can frustrate His
Will. He can reveal a Book even if there is no prophecy at all.
But He has shown mercy to His creatures. Out of this mercy He
has given many promises in all the revealed Books that He will

reveal, in the future, Books to guide the human society. He has
fulfilled this promise by revealing the Kitáb-i-Aqdas through
Bahá’u’lláh.

God Himself declares in the Holy Qur’án that the revealing
of Books has been a practice of God (Sunnat’u’lláh) and that He
does not change His practice:

“(Such has been) the practice of Alláh already in the
> past; no change wilt thou find in the practice of Alláh”.

The question arises as to whether, by the revelation of a new
Book, the promise of protection is dishonoured? The answer is,
simply, not at all. To grasp the full significance of this answer we
will have to keep two points in mind. Firstly both the old as well
as the new Book is a work of God Himself. None of them is a
man-made idea. Therefore they are basically complementary to
each other and do not oppose each other. Thus the promise of
God that He will protect His Book is fulfilled by revelation of a
new Book, according to the need of the time, by Himself. Thus
we witness that during the thirteen centuries since the revelation
of Qur’án, no one could change even a single verse of that Book.
Neither the great kings, scholars, divines, priests, mujtahids and
Imáms could dare to bring even a sentence to have similar influence
and power as that of the Qur’án. Nor is it ever possible. None of
them were authorised to bring any change in the Quranic Laws
because God Himself had promised to guard them. However at
the appointed time, God Himself revealed, through Bahá’u’lláh,
new Laws and Ordinances. Therefore, the promise of God that no
one can change His Book and that He Himself will guard it was
fulfilled.

Secondly all the Manifestations of God, from Adam to
Bahá’u’lláh, are one. They come from the same source, they
represent the same God, they reveal the truth of the same Almighty.
Therefore, there is no strangeness, animosity or rivalry between
them. There is complete harmony, similarity and amity in their
revealed Books. This is why it has been said regarding the Qur’án

that it was in the Books of Moses and Abraham:
“And this is in the Books of the earliest (Revelations)”

(Qur’án, 87:18–19)
If we consider, the above-mentioned verse in the light of the
realities of time and space—it is quite unimaginable. But we can
understand it by the example of a seed. When a seed grows into
a mighty tree—it is its progress. It does not vanish. Rather it
attains its zenith and glory in the tree, flowers and fruits. Similarly
a student learns a certain fact in a class. When he moves over
into a new class it is not that whatever he has learnt is spoiled.
Rather new knowledge will be now added to his basic one acquired
in the previous class. Is not God a protector of each one of us and
all the things—known and unknown? Does it imply that things
will not die or things do not change? God protects all things till
an appointed hour:
“There is no soul but has Protector over it.”
2\. Perfection

The Muslims say: Islám, the religion of God, has been
completed by God. The Holy Qur’án is complete code of life and
we do not need any new Law from God:

“This day have I perfected your religion for you,
> completed my favour upon you, and have chosen for you Islám
as your religion.”                                    (Qur’án, 5:4)

The Bahá’ís believe that every religion, every Book and each
Law of God is perfect and complete. Each of them were a complete
code of life for the people of their respective ages and places.
Islám was also complete for its day, and for today the Bahá’í
Faith is complete too.

As God is Perfect, none of His deeds, acts, words or laws
can ever be imagined imperfect. Before the revelation of the Laws

and Ordinances of the Holy Qur’án, the non-believers used to
taunt the Muslims that your religion is not perfect. They used to
say that in the Books of the past more details, regarding ‘Ḥalál’
and ‘Ḥarám’, were found. However in the verses just preceding
the above-quoted verse, God revealed the name of eleven things
which were forbidden. Thus the Arabs became hopeless. Therefore
God said that today these people (who make objections) have
become hopeless.

In the verse under reference two terms are used which are
worth pondering upon. One refers to ‘perfection’ and the other to
‘completion’. By perfection (Takmíl), is meant that the objectives
underlying the revelation of Islám were fulfilled. However it does
not mean God will never change the Islamic Laws.

According to the changes in the society its requirements also
change. God changes His Laws according to the new needs of the
society. Let us consider this example. A ten-year-old boy receives
a perfect and complete set of clothes from his parents. He is told,
“These are your ‘perfect’ clothes and fit you well. They are
complete for you.” What does it mean? Does it imply that the boy
will wear these clothes for ever? That he will not grow bigger in
the future and that these perfect and complete clothes of his today
will also satisfy the needs of his grown-up body of the future?
Certainly not. He will need another perfect and complete set of
clothes according to the needs of his grown-up body. The same
is the case of Islám. It was tailored for a ‘yum’ (One day) of
1,260 years.

The law of God revealed through the Qur’án was perfect
and complete for that particular period of human evolution. When
the society advanced further, new Laws of God were needed and
the Bahá’í Revelation has fulfilled that need.

Now what is ‘Ni‘mat’ (favour of God)? It is according to
the Qur’án, a revelation, a law of God, love, the truth, victory
etc. For example the Qur’án says:

“He was no more than a servant: We granted Our favour

to him, and We made him an example to the children of Israel.”
In this verse the term ‘favour’ is used to represent ‘revelation’
and ‘truth’.

The terms ‘Takmíl-i-Dín’ (perfection of religion) and ‘Itmám-
i-Ni‘mat’ (completion of favour) give the same meaning. Of
course these terms have been used for Islám but it does not imply
that the revelations of God, before Islám, were not complete or
they were imperfect. Neither does it mean that God has not
bestowed His favours on the past nations. Those who cherish
such ideas and beliefs act against the teachings of the Holy Qur’án.
The following examples from the Qur’án will clarify how the
people in the past were also the recipients of perfect and complete
religions:

God had revealed, in the Tablets of Moses, every detail of
the Laws and Ordinances and had completed His religion:

“And We ordained Laws for him in the Tablets in all
matters, both commanding and explaining all things.”
The Qur’án refers to the Book of Moses as a complete One
having details of all things and all favours:

“Moreover, We gave Moses the Book, completing (Our
> favour) to those who would do right, and explaining all things
in detail, and as a guide and a mercy.”            (Qur’án, 6:154)

Similarly God had completed His favours on Joseph, on the
children of Jacob, on Abraham and on Isaac:

“and perfect his favour to thee and to the posterity of
> Jacob—even as He perfected it to their fathers Abraham and
Isaac aforetime.”                                      (Qur’án, 12:6)

Likewise God has completed His favour upon the children of
Israel as a reward for their patience:

“The fair promise of thy Lord was fulfilled for the children
> of Israel.”                                          (Qur’án, 7:137)
> Is not the claim, that only the Muslims have received complete
code of life from God nullified as baseless in the light of the
above-quoted verses!?
3\. The better people (Khairu’l-Ummah)
The Qur’án calls the Muslims as ‘the better people’:
“Ye are the best of peoples, evolved for mankind.”
In the above verse the Arabic term ‘Khairu’l-Ummah has
been translated as ‘the best of peoples’. This translation is not
correct. The word ‘Khair’ is not a superlative word. It simply
means peace, good deeds, wealth, well-being. Hence the Muslim
interpretation of this verse that they are the best of all the nations
of the past and those of the present is superficial. Rather this
verse gives the understanding that the Muslims are also a good
nation like those of the past. On the other hand God had called
other nations in even higher and superior terms. For example He
had bestowed upon the children of Israel a station superior to that
of all the worlds:

“O children of Israel! call to mind the (special) favour
> which I bestowed upon you, and that I preferred (you) to all
others.”                                              (Qur’án, 2:47)

Thence why this ummah, the children of Israel, did not remain
for ever and why Prophets after Prophet had been coming after
Moses. Why the revelation of God and formation of new nations
did not stop after Him. Therefore it is established that if a nation
is given preference or is called better, it does not mean that no
other nation will be raised by God and that God will not reveal
Laws according to the needs of changed circumstances. As regards
the superiority of the children of Israel let’ s study the following
verses also:

“O Children of Israel! Call to mind the special favour
> which I bestowed upon you, and that I preferred you to all
worlds.”                                            (Qur’án, 2:122)

Also God says, in the following verses, that He had preferred
and bestowed superiority to Ismá‘íl, Elisha, Jonas and Lot over
all the world:

“And Ismá‘íl, and Elisha, and Jonas, and Lot: and to all
We gave favour above the nations;”                   (Qur’án, 6:86)
Therefore the verse under review proves only that the
Muslims were a better Ummah and no more. Then how can the
claim be justified that there will be no more revelation after the
Muslims?

The Muslims give another reason to support their claim that
they are the best of the peoples. They say that God has
commissioned us to call the people to righteousness (Ma‘rúf) and
stop them from wrong-doing (Munkir). Therefore whenever a
wrong is done or will be done in the future, our religious scholars
and reformers will guide the people by rectifying and correcting
the wrongs. Hence no new Messenger of God is needed any more.
This point is also invalid and does not prove that the Laws of
Islám are everlasting. The Qur’án itself says that at the time of
its revelation a group of pious and active people was present
amongst the Jews and Christians. They believed in God, recited
His verses and prayers during the nights, recognised the Day of
judgement, called the people to the right path and stopped them
from doing wrong and did pious deeds:

“Not all of them are alike; of the people of the Book are
> a portion that stand; they rehearse the verses of Alláh all
night long and they prostrate themselves in adoration.”
Nevertheless, God, the Almighty, sent Prophet Muḥammad
to the earth. In the light of the above verse even if there are
present amongst the Muslims one or several religious or political

groups of such peoples, what is the difference? How will their
presence stop a Manifestation of God from coming?
4\. Alteration (Taḥríf) in sacred text

The Muslims reject Bahá’u’lláh by saying that God had sent
Prophet Muḥammad because the people of the past had altered
the words of the Holy Books. The Qur’án is not susceptible to
any such change or alteration till the Day of Judgement
(Qiyámah). Therefore there is no need for any new revelation from
God till that Day.

The Muslims have developed this idea for apparently two
reasons, both of them major misunderstandings. One is that they
think that the past Scriptures are the changed Ones. The second
misunderstanding is that a new Book is revealed by God only if
the Previous One was changed by the people.

The question is whether the texts of the previous Holy
Scriptures were actually changed? There are four verses in the
Qur’án which deal with the subject of ‘Change in the Books’
(i.e. Taḥríf). It can not be proved by any of these verses that
the people had changed the actual text of their Scripture. Rather
they point out that the people used to misinterpret the Holy
Texts:

“Can ye entertain the hope that they will believe in you?

> Seeing that a party of them heard the Word of Alláh, and
perverted it knowingly after they understand.”
The Muslims are warned in this verse against a group of the
people who listened the Word of God, the Holy Qur’án, understood
it and then interpreted it according to their own wishes and thus
changed the original meaning of the Book. Those who interpreted
knew well that the original meaning of the verses was something
else. Are not the Muslims still engaged in similar acts of
misinterpreting the Word of God (i.e. the Qur’án) according to
their own desires? Otherwise why are so many thousands of

interpretations of the Holy Qur’án? Another verse is this:

“Of the Jews there are those who displace words from
their (right) places, and say: ‘We heard and we disobey.”‘
The meaning of this verse is clear, namely, that there were
only some Jews, not all of them, who used to change the meaning
of the words and to use them out of context. It is also clear that
those who were guilty did not change the whole Book, but only
displaced words from their contexts. This was done in the time
of Prophet Muḥammad, as the present tense has been used in the
Qur’án to describe this fact. Now how can the Muslims validate
their objection that the whole Book was altered? The Muslims’
claim, that the people changed their Books at the time of the
advent of Muḥammad so that His claims could not be proved by
their Holy Texts, is also not valid. The Qur’án says that they
‘displace words’ in the present time, i.e. in the time of the advent
of Muḥammad when the Qur’án was being revealed. The point to
ponder here is what could they have gained by this alteration in
the Texts of their Holy Books? The other point is where is the
original Text which has been changed? Can the Muslims produce
even a single version of the original Text of the Books which
were changed? No. Then how can they prove their claim? The
Bible was, after all, a Book which was not confined in the Arab
towns of Mecca and Medina. It was spread all over the continents
in thousands. How was it possible to change the text of it in all
of its copies throughout the world? Therefore it is proved that the
Qur’án does not say that the Bible’s Text was altered but it refers
to the wrong interpretations of some of its verses. The Muslim
clergy have also engaged in such interpretation of their Book
since the very early age of Islám. They are even doing this today.
The third verse in this context is also very clear and does not
say that the Text of Book was changed:

“But because of their breach of their Covenant, We cursed
> them and made their hearts grow hard; they change the Words
> from their (right) places and forget all good part of the Message

that was sent them.”                                   (Qur’án, 5:14)
The fourth verse is this:

“As (they) come to thee, they change the Words from
> their (right) times and places: they say; ‘If ye are given this
take it’ but if not, beware.”                           (Qur’án, 5:44)

In this verse only this much is said that the Jews listen to the
vain talks very attentively but do not seek guidance from the
Prophet Muḥammad Himself. Neither did they investigate the
truth. They used to change the Words from their right places and
context. That is to say that they misinterpreted the verses.

Thus in the light of the above four verses it has been proved
that the Muslim belief regarding change of the Text of the past
Books is not valid.

Of course there may be some contradictions found in different
versions of some revealed Books. It is not the Words of God
which contradict each other, but the statements of the people who
record them which sometimes contradict. The Words of God are
of course different from those of the recording persons.
5\. Blasphemy

The Muslims say that Bahá’u’lláh was neither appointed by
God nor did He receive any Revelation from God. Therefore His
Words were not the Words of God. On the contrary the Qur’án
proclaims:

> “Who can be more wicked than one who inventeth a lie
> against Alláh, or saith, ‘I have received inspiration’, When he
> hath received none, or (again) who saith, ‘I can reveal the like
> of what Alláh revealed.”                                (Qur’án, 6:93)
> It is clear that such a person is an imposter. Now let us see
what is the punishment, ordained by God, for an imposter? God
hath ordained for him an eternal wrath, a great loss and misfortune:

“At length will be said to the wrong-doers: ‘taste ye
> enduring punishment! ye get but the recompense of what ye
earned!”‘                                           (Qur’án, 10:52)

“And We shall say to the wrong-doers, ‘taste ye the
penalty of the fire.’”                            (Qur’án, 34:42)

“And whoever among you does wrong, him shall We
> cause to taste of a grievous penalty.”       (Qur’án, 25:19)
> Revelation of a Book and Promulgation of a code of Laws
of God is not an ordinary event. God Himself warns that even if
a Messenger of God add a single word, of Himself, in the Holy
Text—the word will not show any influence and will not prosper.
On the contrary, God has promised to catch hold of such a liar
and to cut off his vein of life:

“And if the apostle were to invent any sayings in Our
> name, We should certainly seize him by his right hand, and
> We should certainly then cut off the artery of his heart; nor
could any of you withhold him (from Our wrath)”.

(Qur’án, 69:44–47)
An imposter has never succeeded in his designs in the past
nor will any succeed in the future. One of the proofs of the
validity of a true. Manifestation of God is that whenever He
appears He is severely opposed from all quarters. But God dispels
all the oppressors and renders His manifestation triumphant:

“Never did We send an apostle or a prophet before thee,
> but, when he framed a desire, Satan threw some (vanity) in
his desire.”                                      (Qur’án, 22:52)

God has given an example. When the rain falls on the ground
a layer of scum collects on the earth. But soon the scum disappears.
The water sinks deep into the soil and causes the tree and
vegetation to grow. In this example the water represents the
Truth, the new revelation and the new laws and ordinances of
God. On the other hand, the scum represents the falsehood, the

evil and man’s own thoughts and words. A society is never formed
by such scum:

“For the scum disappears like froth cast out; while that
which is for the good of mankind remains on the earth.”
When the Bahá’í Message is shared with a Muslim he argues
that ‘Islám’ is the only religion in the sight of God. He quotes this
verse from the Qur’án:

“The religion before Alláh is Islám (submission to His
Will)”                                              (Qur’án, 3:19)

The literary meaning of the word ‘Islám’ is to obey and to
bow down in obedience. Each and every creature in the universe
is under the biddings of the One True God—the Omnipotent.
Therefore the religion of every thing in all the kingdoms of God
is Islám. All the religions, from Adam to Bahá’u’lláh, were revealed
by God. Therefore each one of them is ‘Islám’. The Holy Qur’án,
itself, refers to the religions revealed by Moses, Abraham and
Jesus as Islám:

“He has named you Muslims, both before and in this
> (Revelation) that the apostle may be a witness for you, and ye
be witness for mankind.”                            (Qur’án, 22:78)

God has chosen this very religion for mankind and
commanded it to follow this very path. In fact the Bahá’í Faith
is objected to by those people who think that it is a religion other
than Islám. The Bahá’ís believe that there is only One God. It is
only He Who sends His Messengers and reveals Books through
Them. The One True God has guided people throughout the ages
and in all lands by sending His Messengers.

Moreover, all the Manifestations of God are also one in
Their station. There is no estrangement or differences between
Them or Their Holy Books. All of Them represent the same God
—the Supreme Law-Giver. The Laws of God are always in

conformity. There is no other power or God but the God. Therefore
we can not justify calling some of the religions as Islám and
others something else.

Bahá’ís believe that Bahá’u’lláh did not utter a single word
from Himself and that did not promulgate a single Law but through
the Will of God. Therefore, in the true sense, the religion brought
by Bahá’u’lláh is also ‘Islám’. However, just as the Laws and
Ordinances of Islám, revealed by Muḥammad, differed from those
of the past, the Laws and Ordinances of the Bahá’í Faith also
differ from those of the Holy Qur’án. Like many religions of the
past, which were called after the names of their Great Founders,
the Bahá’í Faith also derives its name from the Name of its
Founder—Bahá’u’lláh. It is worth clarifying that when a Muslim
becomes a Bahá’í, he is not required to give up his faith in the
Unity of God, in the validity of the station of Muḥammad, the
Prophet of God, or in the Holy Qur’án. On the other hand, today
many thousands of people from all religious backgrounds are
accepting Bahá’u’lláh. All those who believe in Bahá’u’lláh also
confess their faith in Prophet Muḥammad, His Book and His
Faith. Thus it may be said that in a way the progress of the
Bahá’í Faith is the progress of Islám Itself. People, who did not
recognise Prophet Muḥammad and His Faith before becoming
Bahá’ís, start proclaiming His truth just after their conversion to
the Bahá’í Faith. As the Bahá’ís believe in the validity of all the
Prophets of God, in fact, the triumph of this Faith is the triumph
of all the religions and the fulfilment of the dreams of all the
Prophets of God. Thus Moses, while giving the glad tiding of this
age, had foretold that His commandments will rule; Lord Krishna
had prophesied that ‘Ram Raaj’ (Kingdom of God) will be
established; Buddha had announced that the Laws given by ‘Amit-
Bha’ will be obeyed; Zoroaster had promised that ‘Dín-i-Bahí’
will envelop the whole earth; Jesus had said that the Laws and
Ordinances of the Bible will be implemented and Muḥammad had
declared that Islám will become the Universal religion. As an
Arabic proverb goes:

“Our words differ, but your beauty is one.”

All the Prophets of God have foretold the advent of
Bahá’u’lláh.
7\. Ijtihád

Another obstacle in the way of our Muslim friends is the so-
called provision for ‘Ijtihád’ in Islám. They think that by using
the provision of ‘Ijtihád’ they can solve all their problems
until the Day of Resurrection. We have explained, elsewhere in
this book, that the Day of Resurrection is the Day of the Advent
of a Manifestation of God. Before the advent of Bahá’u’lláh the
Muslims could have benefited from this provision. And they
have done so. But now a new Revelation and new Laws and
Ordinances of God have come. Therefore the provision of ‘Ijtihád’
will benefit them no more. Only a Manifestation of God is
authorised by God to proclaim such basic changes and pronounce
a new code of life.

God has solved all our present-day problems through
Bahá’u’lláh. He has guided us in all our steps. Therefore why
should we reject His infallible guidance and be in a doubtful
condition due to the ‘ijtihád’ of some fallible ‘mujtahids’
and learned men.
8\. A Messiah without new laws and
ordinances

The Promised One Who was to come in the Last Day to
establish unity of mankind, justice and peace is called by different
names in different religious Scriptures. In the Book of Zoroaster
He is named as ‘Sháh Bahrám’; Lord Krishna mentions His name
as ‘Kaki Avatara’; He has been mentioned in the Old Testament
as the ‘Lord of the Hosts’; in the New Testament, He is called
‘the Son of Man’, Lord Buddha calls Him as ‘Amit-Bha’ and
in the Holy Qur’án He is referred to as the ‘Greatest News’
(Naba’-i-‘Aẓím).

In the Islamic Holy Traditions (Ḥadíth) the Promised One is
called the ‘Messiah’. Although our intention is to discuss, in this

book, only the Quranic prophecies, we will also discuss some of
the traditions (Ḥadíth) regarding the advent of the ‘Messiah’.
The Bahá’ís believe that the advent of Bahá’u’lláh has been
referred to in the Holy Traditions of Islám as the advent of the
‘Messiah’. The Muslims reject this belief by saying that the same
Jesus the Christ, who was crucified by the Jews, will return from
the sky.

The Bahá’ís believe that Jesus the Christ lived His natural
life and died. The belief that He was taken into the sky and that
He will return from there is not acceptable to any one of reason.
Firstly because of the fact that the sky is not a material thing and
no one can live on an imaginary sky. Secondly, there seem to be
no reason behind keeping anyone alive for such a long time in the
sky. What is the wisdom behind it? Therefore the advent of
Bahá’u’lláh is the second coming of Christ. It means another
person with Christ-like personality, greatness, qualities and station
has appeared in the Person of Bahá’u’lláh. His Mission is the
same as that of the Christ.

Another argument of the Muslims in rejecting Bahá’u’lláh
as the second coming of Christ, is that Christ will return as one
of the followers of Prophet Muḥammad. Hence, He will neither
receive any new Revelation nor will He bring any new Book of
God. And He will not promulgate a new Law for the people.
However, in His first advent, Christ was a full-fledged Messenger
of God. He received a Revelation from God, He revealed a Book
and promulgated new Laws and Ordinances for men. He thus
raised a nation of His followers and finally sacrificed His life in
the path of the good-pleasure of God. Why then should He now
be degraded from His disposition and station in His second advent
to a mere follower of Prophet Muḥammad? Can it be proved
from the past history of the Prophets of God that a Prophet of
God was ever demoted to the position of a mere follower of any
Prophet? Is it a reward? If yes, what a surprise! If this be a
punishment, why?

On the other hand the Muslims cite quotations from the

Traditions (Ḥadíth) that the Promised Messiah will change some
of the Islamic Laws. For example it is said that He will abolish
the Law of ‘Holy War’ (Jihád), gather the five obligatory prayers
together, abandon the religious taxes like ‘Kharáj’ and ‘Jizyah’
(taxes realised by non-Muslim governments and citizens
respectively for their protection). Is it possible that a man without
any authority can change such major Laws of the Holy Qur’án?
The Muslims have no satisfactory answers to these questions.
Moreover, the question arises that if the Promised Christ,
according to the general belief of Muslims, will not receive any
revelation from God then whether He will speak His own words
through His own will? If so, what influence will it have on the
people? Are not the Muslim clergy busy, every moment, in writing
such words—devoid of any influence? If the Promised Christ is
also an ordinary Muslim, then are not the Muslim clergy and
scholars in a better position to guide the nation? Then what is the
necessity of the second coming of Christ?

Due to the passage of time and progress in the fields of
science and technology, society has undergone a dramatic change.
It is a new era and it requires new code of life revealed by God.
The old religions have no answer to the current problems. Today
a Christ is needed. A Christ Who can solve the problems of this
age, Who can speak with the authority of God and can reveal the
Will of God to mankind. Bahá’u’lláh has answered this cry and
fulfilled this need. He has done so not as an ordinary man but as
a full-fledged Manifestation of God.

It is worth mentioning that in all the authentic Traditions of
Islám details regarding the appearance of the Promised One are
given. It is recorded in these prophecies that He will bear a white-
rosy complexion, He will be of medium stature, His hair will be
so shining that it will look always wet—as if water is dropping
from it, etc. Bahá’u’lláh showed all these signs. The Islamic
Traditions foretell that the Promised Christ will accomplish eleven
major tasks. Let us review all of them one by one:

i.    He will bring justice and order

Bahá’u’lláh appeared as a judge to settle the disputes between
the nations and as a ‘Ḥakam’ to maintain order in the society. He
called upon all the rulers of the world and all the nations to adopt
justice. He established justice and equity among His followers
and ordained to establish Houses of Justice at local, national and
inter national levels.
ii.   He will break the cross

When a Christian embraces the Cause of Bahá’u’lláh he no
longer uses the sign of cross as a religious symbol. Thus
Bahá’u’lláh has broken the cross and has established the Oneness
of God and His creatures.
iii. Abolition of Jihád (holy war)

Bahá’u’lláh has forbidden all sorts of war. He taught
disarmament and has exhorted human beings to relinquish all
prejudices and to establish peace.
iv. He will gather the five obligatory

prayers together
Bahá’u’lláh has ordained three obligatory prayers and thus
He has gathered together the obligatory prayers.
v.    He will abrogate the laws of ‘Jizyah’

and ‘Kharáj’
Under the Islamic Laws a non-Muslim citizen has to pay a
special tax to the government called ‘Jizyah’. This assures his
protection in the Islamic Society. Likewise, non-Muslim
Governments are required to pay ‘Kharáj’ to the Muslim
Government and get their protection. Bahá’u’lláh has abolished
this Law. Similarly Bahá’u’lláh has also abolished the terms like
‘káfir’ or ‘dhimmí” and has proclaimed the Oneness of mankind.
No clergy or learned could ever have dared to do this.

vi. He will promote Islám and reject all

> other religions
> As has been explained elsewhere in this chapter, taking the
literary meaning of Islám, the Bahá’í Faith is Islám today.
Therefore the Bahá’í Faith is uniting all the diverse religions and
their followers into one universal religion—into one Faith. Thus
a new nation is being created.
vii. He will be alive for forty years:

Bahá’u’lláh received His revelation in the Síyáh-Chál, of
Ṭihrán, in 1852. Since then He was banished from Ṭihrán, to
Baghdád and from there to different places in Turkey and finally
to ‘Akká—the penal colony of the Ottoman Empire. He died in
1892\. Thus His Ministry was for forty years. He remained alive
for forty years after the declaration of His Mission.
viii. He will kill the ‘Dajjál’

The embodiments of vice and deceit, the opposers of the
Truth e.g. Náṣiri’d-Dín Sháh, Mírzá Áqásí and Yaḥyá Azal were
the ‘Dajját’ of this age.

Yaḥyá Azal, the treacherous half-brother of Bahá’u’lláh,
was the one who followed Bahá’u’lláh from Ṭihrán to Adrianople,
tried several times to poison Him, instigated the people and the
government officials against Bahá’u’lláh and at last was sent to
Cyprus—called the Island of Satan. In this Island of Satan he
died a shameful death. The treachery of Yaḥyá Azal could not
reach beyond the last town of Syria called ‘Afeeq’ and thus
virtually he got entrapped in the town ‘Afeeq’ and was defeated
there. The Holy Traditions say that the ‘Dajjál’ will be defeated
in ‘Afeeq’.
ix. He will descend near the white minaret

at the gate facing Damascus
Bahá’u’lláh was brought, as an exile from Adrianople to

‘Akká, on a ship. He was disembarked from the ship at the city’ s
gate. This gate is called ‘Damashqí Gate’ (Gate facing Damascus).
This gate is situated near a mosque, in ‘Akká, which has a white
minaret. Bahá’u’lláh had entered the city of ‘Akká through that
very gate facing Damascus near the white minaret.
x.   He will defeat the ‘Dajjál’ at the door

of the place called ‘Lúd’
Bahá’u’lláh has passed through this place called ‘Lúd’ while
He was being taken from Alexandria through Jaffá. He had
reached ‘Akká with all glory and triumph. All His enemies were
defeated. Even the king of Írán and Sulṭán of Turkey could not
defeat His purpose or cause Him any harm.
xi. There will be a single Kalima (word) for

> whole world:
> The Bahá’ís throughout the world have a single goal and
mission i.e. the establishment of the oneness of mankind. ‘Abdu’l-
Bahá Himself testifies that if there was a ‘Kalima’ for the Bahá’ís
it would be, “consort with people of all religions in utmost
spirituality and unity.”

It is so clear, from the above examples, that the prophecies
given by Prophet Muḥammad, regarding the Promised Christ,
have been totally realised. In the presence of all these proofs who
can deny the validity of the claims of the Promised One of all the
religions—Bahá’u’lláh?

Qiyámah—The Day of Resurrection
The Arabic term ‘Qiyámah’ means “to arise”. It is
resurrection or revival of a people through a Manifestation of
God. It is mentioned in the Holy Books that the Words of God
are revealed at the time of Qiyámah. The period, during which
the Manifestation of God reveals His Laws and gathers the people
to arise as a new nation is called the day of Qiyámah. Thus on
the day of Qiyámah, a new Book is revealed, a new nation is
raised and a new Manifestation of God settles all the disputes
between the nations. The nations receive their rewards or
punishments in accordance with their collective deeds and the
judgement of the new Manifestation.

Therefore the advent of each of the Manifestations of God
in the past was a day of Qiyámah. According to the Qur’án there
are three types of Qiyámah. The Lesser Qiyámah is the separation
of the soul from the human temple i.e. the material death of a
person. With this death his material progress comes to an end.
The body decomposes and its constituent elements join similar
elements in the nature. The soul which is released due to this
separation never returns to this body. Nor does it go to any other
material temple. It remains as an individual soul and faces its
rewards or punishments according to the deeds of the person in
this material world. It receives its reward or punishment
immediately after its separation from the body and does not have
to wait for a day of judgement, as normally believed by the
Muslims.

The second type of Qiyámah is called the medium one. It is
the end of an Era and termination of the period appointed for a
particular people. The people hand over the reign of the Cause of
God to incompetent persons. These worldly persons lead the people
away from the truth and the nation meets its spiritual death—the
medium Qiyámah.

The third type of Qiyámah is referred to as the Major
Qiyámah. The people believe that, “that will be the day of

judgement and reward and punishment in the next world”. They
say it is the end of the world. However, this concept of major
Qiyámah is not reasonable or valid. Every soul receives its reward
or punishment right on the day when it is separated from its body,
i.e. on the day of Lesser Qiyámah.

Another term used for the Major Qiyámah is ‘Al-Sá‘a’ i.e.

the appointed hour. The appointed hour strikes with the advent of
a new Manifestation of God. It will come all of a sudden and
without the knowledge of anyone. The Major Qiyámah is also
referred to in the Qur’án as ‘the last day’. It is a very simple fact
that each of the Manifestations of God is the Last one as compared
to His Predecessors and His Day or Age is, similarly, the last
Day. Hence to believe in the last Day means to believe in the
Manifestation of God for that Day. All the past Manifestations of
God have foretold that an Age of great revolutions and
immeasurable changes is sure to come. When that Age is Come
—it is the time of Major Qiyámah.

In this connection the Bahá’í Writings explain two very basic
facts. One is that whenever a Manifestation of God has appeared
in this world it was a Qiyámah (resurrection). Hence the advent
of all the Messengers of God, like Adam, Moses, Christ,
Muḥammad, Krishna, Buddha, etc., was a Qiyámah for their
respective ages. And the Qiyámah promised by all the Holy Books
of the past has come to pass with the advent of Bahá’u’lláh.

The second thing is that, like all other religions, Bahá’ís also
believe in judgement, reward and punishment, heaven and hell,
etc. Then why do the Muslim scholars not agree with the Bahá’í
explanation of the term ‘Qiyámah’? This question requires a sincere
and earnest investigation.

In fact the Holy Qur’án can be divided into three sections
according to its text. In the first part we find the stories of the
past. How a people progressed after accepting a Messenger of
God or became the recipients of the wrath of God by rejecting
One. In the second part we can gather such verses of God which
proclaim, according to the need of the age, laws and exhortations.

In these two sections, consisting of the history and laws, everything
is very clear and cannot be misunderstood. In the Quranic
terminology these sections together consist of verses which are
‘Muḥkamát’ i.e. established truths. The third part of the Quranic
subjects deal with future events and consists of verses called in
the Qur’án, ‘Mutashábihát’, i.e. allegories. God, in His divine
wisdom, has sealed the meanings of such verses and asked the
people to refrain from pondering upon them and explaining them
till the next advent. Without the knowledge of the next
Manifestation of God no one could understand the true meaning
of such verses—the Mutashábihát.

The verses relating to the questions like; “What is Qiyámah?”
or “what are its signs and effects?” fall into the category of
allegories. The Qur’án instructs its followers to read them and
have belief in them, but not to indulge in elaboration and
explanation of these verses. It promises that these verses will be
explained by a divine Manifestation of God.

All the divine Scriptures contain such allegories which have
been kept sealed for a specific period:

“Go your way, Daniel, for the words are shut up and
> sealed until the time of the end. Many shall purify themselves,
> and make themselves white, and be refined; but the wicked
> shall do wickedly; and none of the wicked shall understand;
but the wise shall understand.”                   (Daniel, 12:9–10)

The people present in the time of a Manifestation of God
cannot grasp the full significance of an event which is yet to
come after a long time in the future. This is why that the meaning
of the term “Qiyámah” has remained hidden to the expounders of
the Holy Qur’án. Today the twin Manifestations of God—the
Báb and Bahá’u’lláh—have explained the true meaning of these
verses. Now new vistas of meanings and knowledge have opened
themselves to the people and a new world of understanding has
been unveiled.

The Holy Qur’án warns us regarding ‘Muḥkamát’ and
‘Mutashábihát’ in these words:

“He it is Who has sent down to thee the Book; in it are
> verses basic or fundamental (of established meanings), they
> are the foundation of the Book; others are allegorical. But
> those in whose hearts is perversity follow the part thereof that
> is allegorical, seeking discord, and searching for its meanings,
> but no one knows its hidden meanings except Alláh, and those
> who are firmly grounded in knowledge. Say, ‘we believe in
> the Book; the whole of it is from our Lord’ and none will
grasp the Message except men of understanding.”
The above-quoted verse proves it, beyond any doubt, that no
one had the authority to explain the allegorical statements.
Therefore, whoever has tried to do so has erred in this deed. The
knowledge of the learned and even the best of the priests is not
all-embracing. They can not comprehend the future events and
developments. Hence Alláh warns the Muslims:

“Nay, they charge with falsehood that whose knowledge
> they cannot compass, even before the elucidation thereof
> hath reached them; thus did those before them make
> charges of falsehood; but see what was end of those who did
wrong.”                                            (Qur’án, 10:39)

It seems that, at the time of the revelation of the Qur’án, the
people were asking Muḥammad to explain the allegorical statements
therefore God had taught Muḥammad not to make haste in this
matter. The Muslims were instructed to recite the Holy Verses
and wait for the explanation from God:

“Move not thy tongue concerning the (Qur’án) to make
> haste therewith. It is for Us to collect it and to promulgate it;
> but when We have promulgated it, follow thou its recital. Nay
more, it is for Us to explain it.”                  (Qur’án, 75:16–19)

Now, when the appointed hour is come, God has revealed,
through His Manifestations for this age, the real meanings and
explanations of the allegorical passages of the Qur’án. It is for
us to pay heed to these explanations and attain the good pleasure

of our creator. Let us study some of the elucidations and
explanations of these Quranic allegories as given by the Báb and
Bahá’u’lláh in their revealed Books ‘The Bayán’ and the ‘Íqán’
respectively, as well as in many other Tablets.
Qiyámah, life and death

The Muslims say that the Qiyámah will entail a complete
destruction of the earth and heaven and all the things pertaining
to them. However this complete annihilation cannot be proved by
any verses concerning Qiyámah. Qiyámah means a new stage in
the evolutionary history of mankind, the beginning of a new era
of scientific and technological developments:

“One day the earth will be changed to a different earth,
> and so will be the heavens, and (men) will be marshalled
forth, before Alláh, the One, the Irresistible.”
It should be remembered that just like the physical life and
death there is also a spiritual life and death. In the religious
Scriptures when the term life or death is used they stand for
spiritual life and spiritual death. Love of God, obedience towards
Him, righteousness, faithfulness, etc. are the life of the spirit.
When these qualities fade away, death occurs to the spirit of
Faith. This spiritual death comes to both the individuals and
collectively to the nations. In the Qur’án wherever the death of a
people or nation is referred to—it is the spiritual death; likewise
life stands for spiritual life. Let’s meditate upon this verse:

“Can he who was dead, to whom We gave life, and a
> light whereby he can walk amongst men be like him who is in
> the depths of darkness.”                         (Qur’án, 6:122)
What is ‘Adháb-i-Qabr (chastisement in the

> grave)?

The term ‘Qabr’ i.e. ‘grave’ means the state of heedlessness,
ignorance and disobedience to God. In this state the human temple

becomes the grave of a dead soul. When the Bahá’í teachers meet
such people and ask them, ‘Who is your Lord? What is your
religion, what do you say about the Messenger of God for this
Age?’, those who are bereft of the spirit of faith reply’ ‘we do not
accept these words.’ However those who become alert and rise up
from the grave of heedlessness and recognise the advent of the
Truth reply, ‘verily this Advent is true’. In this way those who
refuse are caught by the wrath of God and those who believe
receive His bounties.
What is Pul-i-Ṣiráṭ (The Bridge on the
Path)?

The Laws and Ordinances revealed by the new Manifestation
of God is the ‘bridge’. The believer attains to the paradise of the
good-pleasure of God by crossing it. However the ones who reject
it fall down in the fire of the wrath of God. For those who are
deprived of the spiritual insight the new Laws of God are sharper
than a sword. Some, wonderstruck, stay off the bridge and many
fall down. The Jews have been blocked at the bridge of the Old
Testament for several thousand years, the Christians are stopped
at the bridge of the New Testament and likewise the Muslims are
standing at the bridge of the Qur’án—Awestruck.
What is Mízán (The Balance)?

The Word of God is, actually, the Balance of justice which
is set on the Day of Qiyámah. The acts which conform to the
Word of God become the cause of salvation. The deeds which are
not according to that Word invite punishments.
What is Liqá-i-Rabb (Visitation of God)?

God is sanctified from all material existence and He can
never be seen by the material eyes. By the promise that the people
will see and meet God on the Day of Qiyámah it is meant that
they will see and meet a Manifestation of God. A Manifestation
of God represents the Godhead and the pure-hearted people see
in Him the effulgence of God. Through their inner eyes of wisdom

and perception they see, in His beauty the Beauty of God and feel
in His presence the Presence of God. Thus meeting with a
Manifestation of God is like meeting God Himself. However the
wicked and evil-minded people deprive themselves of this bounty.
The Muslims have been told that they will be sure to meet Him
on the Day of Judgement (Qiyámah):

“For those whose hopes are in the meeting with Alláh,
> for the Term by Alláh is surely coming; and He hears and
> knows.”                                             (Qur’án, 29:5)
> This promise of God has been fulfilled, at the appointed
hour, by the Advent of Bahá’u’lláh.
What is Khalq-i-Jadíd (Rebirth)?

Khalq-i-jadíd means a spiritual rebirth, i.e. to be made
spiritually alive. A Messenger of God is raised up to guide peoples
and nations. Similarly the people are raised up, through the
Messenger, for a new spiritual revolution. This is also called
revival. It has occurred in the past and has been prophesied for the
future. For example, it was said to the children of Israel that they
were made alive after their death:

“Then we raised you up after your death; ye had chance
to be grateful.”                                    (Qur’án, 2:56)

The Holy Qur’án states, very clearly, that those who will
await destruction of the earth and the heaven will not believe in
the new Advent in the day of qiyámah. However those who are
endowed with faith and blessed with certitude and divine knowledge
will inform others that this very day is the day of rebirth and
rising up. On the day of the Advent, the faithful and believers will
say to the Muslims that they have lived in the age of Qur’án till
the day of rebirth but they did not know it:

“On the day that the Hour will be established, the
> transgressors will swear that they tarried not but an hour!

Thus were they used to being deluded! But those endued with

knowledge and faith will say, indeed ye did tarry, within Alláh’s
> decree, to the day of resurrection, and this is the day of
resurrection; but ye were not aware!” (Qur’án, 30:55–56)

Thus it is clear from these verses that the day of the Advent
of Bahá’u’lláh is the day of spiritual rebirth i.e. spiritual and
intellectual revolutions and progress. But only the faithful can
perceive it.
What is Yum-i-Ṭaláq (Day of Separation)?

Yum-i-ṭaláq is the day of separation or parting of the truth
from the error through a Manifestation of God. Another term
used for this term is ‘the day of judgement’. As stated earlier, on
the day of judgement, a Manifestation of God appears and settles
the disputes of the nations and unites them. Thus the believers are
separated from the non-believers. All the Messengers of God,
including Muḥammad, have accomplished this. Muḥammad
Himself caused a resurrection and had judged between the people:

“But Alláh judges between them on the Day of Judgement
as to their differences.”                       (Qur’án, 16:124)

“Why they are summoned to Alláh and His Apostle, in
> order that He may judge between them, behold some of them
decline.”                                       (Qur’án, 24:48)

“If thou judge, judge in equity between them; for Alláh
loveth those who judge in equity.”                   (Qur’án, 5:5)
What is Yum-id-Dín (Day of Religion)?

When a new Manifestation of God proclaims a new religion,
the Kingdom of God is established on the earth. That very day is
called ‘yum-id-dín’ or the day of religion. The Manifestation of
God is the Lord of that day of religion. Those who bow down and
accept these facts are included among the chosen ones of God.
But those who reject are cursed and punished by God. The Qur’án
promises that the coming of a new religion will occur:

“Verily that which ye are promised is true; and verily
justice (Al-Dín i.e. religion) must indeed come to pass.”

(Qur’án, 51:5–6)
Accordingly a new religion has been promulgated through
Bahá’u’lláh in this day which is the ‘yum-id-dín’.
What is Yumu’l-Ákhirah (The Last Day)?

Literarily speaking, compared to the past Messengers of God,
the day of the latest Manifestation of God will be called the last
day. All the peoples, including the Muslims, were taught to have
faith in God and in the last day. Belief in the last day is really
the belief in the continuity of the history. It is to believe and
accept the consequences of one’s own deeds and to have faith in
the future.
What is Yumu’l-Ḥashr (The Day of
Gathering)?

Yumu’l-ḥashr means the day on which the people will be
gathered together. People get divided into many groups, sects and
ideologies. The Manifestation of God removes all
misunderstandings from among them and paves the ways for their
unification. He collects them under one tent of unity through His
spiritual powers and the influence of the Words of God. That
very day is called the day of gathering:

“It is He Who got out the unbelievers among the people
of the Book from their homes at the first gathering (Ḥashir).”
Thus it is clear that Muḥammad’s Advent was a day of
gathering (Ḥashr) in this world. The term ‘Qiyámah’ and ‘Ḥashr’
are the same. It is mentioned in the Qur’án that one should fear
God and have faith that he will be gathered unto God:

“… fear God, and know that ye will surely be gathered
unto Him.”                                        (Qur’án, 2:203)

What Is Yumu’l-Khurúj (The Day of Exodus)?

The day of the Advent of a Manifestation of God is also
called the day of exodus. Hence it is mentioned:

> “And listen for the Day when the Caller will call out
> from a place quite near,—The Day when they will hear a
> (mighty) blast in (very) truth; that will be the day of
resurrection (Yumu’l-Khurúj).”                     (Qur’án, 50:41–42)

How clear it is from the above verses that Yumu’l-Khurúj
is the day on which a divine call will be raised from a nearby
place and the people will listen to that call of truth. On that day,
the spiritually dead will come out of the graves of their ignorance
and heedlessness and arise to revivify the world and establish
peace on earth. As has already been explained elsewhere in this
book, the physical body of man starts decomposing right from the
day of its death. However the reality of man is his spirit which
takes its flight into its eternal realms towards the kingdom on
high. Therefore the belief that physical bodies will come out of
their physical graves is neither logical nor can be proved by the
verses of the Qur’án. On the contrary the Qur’án proclaims that
all the physical things—the earth, the sun, the moon, the stars,
animals, vegetation and men—will remain safe on the day of
Qiyámah. They will not face annihilation. Rather a Manifestation
of God will raise His Call from this very earth and that will be
the Yumu’l-Khurúj:

“And among His signs is this, that heaven and earth
> stand by His command; then when He calls you, by a single
call, from the earth, behold, ye come forth.”
What is Nafkha’i-Ṣúr (Blowing of the

> Trumpet)?

This term refers to the blowing of a trumpet, proclamation,
making widely known. It has been a traditional custom in the
army that a trumpet is blown to gather the troops. This term has

also frequently been used in the Old and New Testaments. The
blowing of the trumpet is mentioned at several places. It simply
means the Advent of Bahá’u’lláh.

A Manifestation of God is His Announcer. His call is the
call of God and His voice is God’s voice. When the Prophet
Muḥammad raised the call of the Oneness of God, it was in fact
blowing of a trumpet. By its influence the spiritually dead became
alive. Likewise when Bahá’u’lláh sounded the trumpet, the most
great resurrection came to pass and a new revival engulfed the
whole world.
What are Arḍ wa Samá’ ( earth and
heaven)?

In the context of resurrection, whenever the terms ‘earth’
and ‘heaven’ are used in the Holy Books they represent different
meanings. ‘Earth’ means the earth of knowledge and understanding,
the earth of new insight etc. ‘Heaven’ represents the heaven of
new teachings and religion. By the shattering of the heaven (sky)
on the day of resurrection, it is meant that the heaven of old
religion is removed and a new one is raised through the Advent
of a new Manifestation of God and the earth of recognition of
God is decorated with Faith.
What are Shams wa Qamar (sun and
moon)?

By ‘sun’ and ‘moon’, when used in context of Qiyámah, is
meant the sun and moon of the religious order and system. The
sun symbolizes the person of the Manifestation of God who rises
from the horizon of the Will of God. The successors and deputies
of the Manifestation are called the moons of His dispensation.
The priests and scholars of a particular dispensation are the stars
of the heaven of that religion. These stars of the heaven of religion
no longer give light, due to their rejection of the new Manifestation
of God, and fall off the sky of religion. With the Advent of a new
Manifestation of God a new heaven is raised, a new earth is

spread, and new moons and stars are made to manifest—actually
a new era starts.
What is Yumu’l-Ḥaqq (the day of truth)?

On the day of the advent of the Spirit of Truth i.e. a
Messenger of God the holy souls arise in unison. This day is
called ‘the day of truth’:

“The day that the spirit and the angels will stand forth
> in rank, none shall speak except who is permitted by (Alláh)
> Most Gracious. That day will be the sure reality (yumu’l-
Ḥaqq.”                                                (Qur’án, 78:39)

The day of truth is also called ‘the Day of Happening
(Váqi‘ih) whose occurrence cannot be denied by anyone. The same
day of truth (Yumu’l-Ḥaqq) is called ‘Sat-Yug’ in Hindi. Kalki
Avatara was to inaugurate the ‘Sat-yug’. Thus Bahá’u’lláh, who,
according to the Hindus is Kalki Avatara, has inaugurated the
‘Sat-yug’ or the ‘yumu’l-Ḥaqq’. The day of Qiyámah is also
termed as the day of advent, the day of separation, the day of
assemblage, the day of threatening, the day of sorrowfulness, the
day of resurrection, the day of judgement, etc. The Qur’án
calls all of these days as THE DAY OF GOD’ Yumu’lláh.

We conclude the above explanations by noting that the Holy
Qur’án is full of prophecies regarding the Advent of Bahá’u’lláh.
It is also clear that the Day of Qiyámah is not the day of destruction
and annihilation. Rather it is a Day of a new Manifestation of
God, a day of revival of faith. Those imbued with faith will
believe in the New Manifestation of God on the Day of Qiyámah
and enter the good-pleasure of God. Those who will reject the
New Day will have to face the wrath of God which is the real
doom.

God has established Qiyámah, in this new era, through the
Advent of Bahá’u’lláh.

Why did they deny?
The pages of the Holy Qur’án bear witness that all the
Manifestations of God, right from Adam to Muḥammad were
rejected by the majority of the people. They also describe that the
people always made plots to undo Their Missions by using different
excuses and tricks:

“Never did We send an apostle or a prophet before thee,
> but when he framed a desire, Satan threw some (vanity) into
> his desires; but Alláh will cancel anything (vain) that Satan
throws in”.                                          (Qur’án, 22:52)

These episodes have been recorded in the Holy Qur’án as a
warning lest the Muslims follow the footsteps of the past nations
and reject their Promised Manifestation—Bahá’u’lláh. Otherwise
there is no point in mentioning these tales.

Why did they (the people) deny their Messenger? The
following are some of the reasons that we have gleaned from the
Qur’án:
1\. Selfish desires

People always keep some self-made standard for recognizing
a Manifestation of God. They fix their minds upon certain rituals
and dogmas as well as a certain set of laws and ordinances given
in a particular age. They expect that God will always conform to
their desires and satisfy their standards.

However, God does things in His own ways. He never
consults His creatures nor does He care for the selfish desires of
the people. He does what He wills and He ordains whatever He
desires. Ours is the duty to forsake all that pertains to our own
desires, standards and rituals, and surrender our wills to the Will
of God. He abhors the refusal of His Manifestation due to selfish
desires:

“Is it that whenever there comes to you an Apostle with
> what ye yourselves desire not, ye are puffed up with pride?
> Some ye called Imposters, and others ye slay.”

“For Alláh guideth not those who reject faith.”
2\. Blind imitation

Another trait of the people is that they become so much
attached to their fore-fathers and imitate them so blindly that
when they see that the Manifestation of God is teaching new
things they simply refuse to accept Him. This blind imitation of
the ancestors is very much discouraged in the Holy Qur’án. It
teaches that when a new Manifestation makes this appearance,
the people should investigate His claims and at no cost should
they reject Him only for the reason that He teaches something
that contradicts their past beliefs or rituals:

“when it is said to them: ‘Come to what Alláh hath
> revealed: come to the Apostle’: they say: ‘enough for us are
> the ways we found our fathers following!’ even though their
fathers were void of knowledge and guidance.”
“When it is said to them, ‘Follow what Alláh hath
> revealed’, they say, ‘Nay! we shall follow the ways of our
> fathers’.”                                         (Qur’án, 2:170)
3\. Jealousy

Jealousy was another reason that a people denied its
Manifestation of God. They simply said why should there be a
new Messenger while we have already got a Prophet of our own
and we follow Him: We have His Book and Laws which are
sufficient for us. Why should we be taught a new book? They
considered that if they will accept a new Messenger it would go
against their established religion, pride and honour. A few of

them showed humbleness before God and accepted His
Manifestation, but those blessed souls became the target for the
darts of hatred and jealousy of the non-believers. Due to this
jealousy they invited the divine wrath:

“… or do they envy mankind for what Alláh hath given
> them of His bounty? But We had already given the people of
> Abraham the Book and wisdom and conferred upon them a
> great kingdom.”                                   (Qur’án, 4:54)
4\. Heedlessness

Heedlessness of the people has been another reason for their
denial. Due to it they fail to pay any serious attention to the Call
of the Manifestation of God. They do not ponder upon His
teachings, and make no effort to accept Him and enter into the
struggle of life:

“Ah! Alas for (My) servants! There comes not an apostle
> to them but they mock him! See they not how many generations
> before them We destroyed? Not to them will they return.”
5\. Priests and anchorites

The people become so much attached and faithful to their
religious guides (Aḥbár) and spiritual leaders (Ruhbán) that with
the passage of time, they raise them to the status of deity. Hence
they refuse to accept the Messenger of God because these leaders
do not accept Him.

In the time of Prophet Muḥammad this was one of the reasons
that people rejected Him. Likewise in this age, again, the priests
have rejected Bahá’u’lláh. The people have followed their example.
According to the Holy Qur’án, this is the worst type of “Shirk”,
i.e. making partners with God:

“They took their priests and their anchorites to be their
lords in derogation of Alláh.”                         (Qur’án, 9:31)

6. New Revelation

Following into the footsteps of the past nations, the Muslims
have also developed the belief that their religion, their Book, their
Laws and Ordinances are the final ones and that there will come
no new Manifestation of God as they have accepted the last of the
Manifestations. Hence when Bahá’u’lláh appeared, with all the
signs and according to all the prophecies given in the past
Scriptures, the followers of the Holy Qur’án but a very few
rejected Him.

We should ponder upon these verses in order to understand
the divine guidance:

“Never comes to them of a renewed Message from their
Lord, but they listen to it as in jest.”        (Qur’án, 21:2)

“And there comes not to them a newly revealed Message
from (Alláh) Most Gracious, but they turn away therefrom.”
7\. Blasphemy

Another plea that the people took when rejecting Manifestation
of God has been that neither is this man from God nor has he
revealed any new book or law of God. The people would say that
this man is an imposter, he has made false claims, he is an agent
of some other nation and is commissioned for propagating their
ideas amongst us, etc. Such blasphemy was heaped upon
Moses, Jesus, Muḥammad—in fact upon all the past Messengers.
The Holy Qur’án rejects such blaming, by stating a golden rule
that no pretender can ever dare to stand in this position. Neither
will a blasphemer ever succeed:

“But the misbelievers say, ‘naught is this but a lie which
He (Apostle) has forged, and others have helped Him at it’.”

8. Pride and arrogance

Many people have showed arrogance towards the
Manifestations of God and had been proud of their own worldly
possessions, leadership, authority, accomplishments and
knowledge, etc. Due to this they have rejected the Word of God
revealed by the Manifestation. The Holy Qur’án stops its adherents
from such deeds:

“Woe to each sinful dealer in falsehoods: he hears the
> verses of Alláh rehearsed to him, yet is obstinate and lofty, as
> if he had not heard them. Then announce to him a penalty
grievous!”                                          (Qur’án, 45:7–8)

Unfortunately the people of this age have also generally
followed the footsteps of the former people in this regard.
9\. Misunderstanding

Another shortcoming of the peoples had been that they
misunderstood the divine station of a Manifestation of God and
treated Him as an ordinary man. Therefore they remained ignorant
of the majesty, influence, glory and mystery of His revealed Word.
They even claimed that they themselves can write such words:

“When Our verses are rehearsed to them, they say, ‘we
> have heard this (before). If we wished, we could say (Words)
like these, these are nothing but tales of the ancients.”
In spite of this clear warning, the Muslims have repeated the
same mistake and have treated Bahá’u’lláh as an ordinary man.
Thus most of them have remained ignorant of the miraculous
eloquence and the penetrating influence of His Words.
10\. Renewal of religion

The people have always disliked the idea of the renewal of
religion, even by the Manifestation of God, hence they have rejected

Him. The Pharaoh rejected Moses for the same reason:

“Said Pharaoh, ‘leave me to slay Moses; and let Him call
> on His Lord! What I fear is lest He should change your
> religion, or lest He should cause mischief to appear in the
land.’”                                             (Qur’án, 40:26)

Bahá’u’lláh has been rejected by the Muslims on the same
ground. The majority of the learned Muslims are ready to accept
Bahá’u’lláh as a great reformer, scholar and a saint. However
they say that He should not have changed the Laws of Islám and
renewed the religion. It is not surprising that the people who
rejected the Manifestations of God in the past and the people who
are now rejecting Bahá’u’lláh are using the same excuse. However,
the Qur’án asserts that a Manifestation of God is fully authorised
to renew the Laws of God:

“What! have they partners (in Godhead) who have
> established for them some religion without the permission of
Alláh?”                                            (Qur’án, 42:21)

No liar has as yet been able to establish a religion nor is it
possible in the future. Hence God declares that if someone claims
that he has revealed a Book of Law which is from God and some
people accept Him, there can be no doubt in His truth:

“But those who dispute concerning Alláh after He has
> been accepted, futile is their dispute in the sight of their Lord;
on them is wrath, and for them will be a penalty terrible.”
Bahá’u’lláh questions the Muslims, referring to the renewal
of religion, that if they like the old laws then why did they leave
the Laws of the Old and the New Testaments … and if they
considered this (renewal of Laws) an offense committed by
Bahá’u’lláh then Muḥammad, the Prophet of God had preceded
Him in this offense and even before Muḥammad—Jesus and
Moses have also committed similar crimes.

11. Acquisition of power

One of the reasons behind the denial of the people was that
they thought that the Manifestation of God was hungry for worldly
power and that He will seize their authority, honour and kingdom:

“Said Pharaoh, ‘leave me to slay Moses; and let Him call
> on His Lord! What I fear is lest He should change your
> religion, or lest He should cause mischief to appear in the
land.”                                              (Qur’án, 40:26)

Bahá’u’lláh was also subjected to similar accusations.

However He clearly rejected it. He was a son of a minister of
Írán. He could have got His father’s rank and position very
easily. In fact, He was offered His father’s post after his death.
Bahá’u’lláh refused to accept it.
12\. Denial of prophecies

Each of the Manifestations of God has taken a pledge from
His followers that they will accept and aid the next Manifestation
who will testify to the validity of all the past dispensations.
However, in spite of all these pledges and prophecies, the
people have always rejected their Promised One. They flatly denied
the validity of the prophecies and branded the Manifestations as
charmers and magicians. Thus it happened at the time of the
appearance of Moses:

“When Moses came to them with Our clear signs, they
> said, ‘this is nothing but sorcery faked up; never did we hear
the like among our fathers of old!’”                  (Qur’án, 28:36)

Yet in another place it is mentioned that those who refused
to accept the Promised One of their Book said that they were the
‘last Ummah’ and that they have never heard that any other
prophet will appear after theirs. Therefore the new claim is a
wishful statement:

“We never heard (the like) of this among the people of
> these latter days; this is nothing but a made-up tale! What!
Has the message been sent to him (Muḥammad) among us?”
Are not the above statements identical to what the Muslims
utter in this age—while denying Bahá’u’lláh? God says, about
the people of the Book who preceded the Muslim, these Words:

“And when came to them an Apostle from Alláh,
> confirming what was with them, a party of the people of the
> Book threw away the Book of Alláh behind their backs, as if
they did not know.”                               (Qur’án, 2:101)

Similar is the condition of the followers of Qur’án in this
age. They have rejected the Promised One of their Book by saying
that no such promise was ever given in the Qur’án.
13\. Wrapping of the heart

In the past, whenever a Messenger of God has appeared, the
people have rejected Him due to their own self-made ideas, rituals,
arrogance, ignorance and prejudices etc. They boasted about these
wrong traits and rejected the Messenger of God:

“They said, ‘our hearts are the wrappings (which preserve
> Alláh’s Word. We need no more)’ Nay, Alláh’s curse is on
them for their blasphemy.”                          (Qur’án, 2:88)

The above-quoted verse particularly refers to the Jews and
the Christians. The priests of these religions used to say that their
hearts were in wrappings and that nothing could come out of it
nor could anything new enter therein. Thus they justified their
rejection of the new teachings.

God mentions four crimes of the Jews in the Holy Qur’án
and says that due to their own rejection He had stamped their
hearts:

“(The Jews incurred Alláh’s displeasure) In that they
> broke their Covenant; that they rejected the signs of Alláh;
> that they slew the Messengers in defiance of right; that they
> said, ‘our hearts are the wrappings’ Alláh hath set the seal on
their hearts for their blasphemy and little is it they believe.”
Do not the Muslims say the same thing today that they
neither need to accept any new thing nor are ready to give up the
old? Alas! due to such misunderstandings most of the peoples
have failed to recognise the Promised One of all Ages—
Bahá’u’lláh.

Why another Manifestation of God?
When the people are invited to accept the Advent of
Bahá’u’lláh, the Muslims as well as the followers of all other
religions respond in the similar way. They say, “our religion is
complete, Its laws are sufficient. Why should we accept a new
Manifestation of God?” As we are addressing the Muslims in this
book, let’s see what the Holy Qur’án has to say about the need
for the coming of a Messenger of God and whether such a need
actually exists in this age or not.

Even a very cursory reading of the Qur’án will reveal that God
has sent, in the past, His Messengers for the following sixteen reasons:
1\. To confer life

God has always sent a Messenger whenever a previous nation
had met its spiritual death and moral decay. The Messenger of
God revives the dead nation and instils a new life into it. The
Qur’án proclaims that God gives life to the dead in this manner
and shows the people His signs that they may comprehend:

“Thus Alláh bringeth the dead to life and showeth you
His signs: perchance ye may understand.” (Qur’án, 2:73)
In another place the Holy Qur’án says that it is He (God)
who gives life and death:

“It is He that giveth both life and death.”

The Qur’án uses the present tense whenever it mentions the
giving of life or death. It says that the teachings of Islám are life-
giving:

“O ye who believe! give your response to Alláh and His
Apostle when He calleth you to that which will give you life.”

And it (Qur’án) informs Muḥammad that He could not make
those who had turned their backs on Him understand, as they
were deaf and dead. Here the term ‘dead’ has been used to
symbolize the ones who rejected Muḥammad.

Are not the peoples of the world in a state of spiritual death in
this time? Is not a Manifestation of God needed to revive them?

“Truly thou canst not cause the dead to listen, nor canst
> thou cause the deaf to hear the Call, when they turn back in
> retreat.”                                            (Qur’án, 27:80)
2\. To judge

Another reason that God sends a Manifestation is to judge
between the peoples and resolve their disputes and make justice
between them. The Messenger of God appears as an Order (Amr)
and a Judge:

“To every people is an Apostle; when their Apostle comes,
> the matters will be judged between them with justice, and
they will not be wronged.”                         (Qur’án, 10:47)

References have been made regarding the same judgement,
in a number of verses of the Qur’án, as the ‘final decree’ and the
‘ultimate explanation’. An ordinary man with limited knowledge,
fallible personality and devoid of the spiritual power and influence
of a Manifestation of God can never decide upon and pass
judgement in such matters.
3\. To give glad-tidings and to warn

A Manifestation of God imparts glad tidings of worldly
victories and eternal salvation to those who believe and act in
accordance with the Laws of God. He also warns the wicked and
wrong-doers of their ill-fate:

“We send the Apostles only to give good news and to
warn; so those who believe and mend (their lives) upon them

> shall be no fear, nor shall they grieve.”              (Qur’án, 6:48)
> Bahá’u’lláh has accomplished both of the above missions.

He gave the righteous and the God-fearing people the assurance
of reward and the glad tidings of success in both this world and
the world to come. At the same time, He warned the unjust and
tyrant kings and rulers of the earth of their imminent doom if they
failed to correct themselves. He advised all to take heed and
follow the Path of God.
4\. To unite man with God

A Manifestation of God unites all the people who had so far
forgotten God with their Creator and establishes a close connection
between the Creator and His creation. At first He declares His
own servitude towards God and then invites all to the servitude
of the divine threshold. No one but a Manifestation of God can
accomplish this task. No social worker or philanthropist can ever
claim this station nor do they really do this:

“O our people, hearken to the One Who invites (you) to
> Alláh, and believe in Him; He will forgive you your faults,
and deliver you from a penalty grievous.” (Qur’án, 46:31)

“And as One Who invites, to Alláh’s (grace) by His leave,
and as a Lamp spreading light.”                   (Qur’án, 33:46)

Only a Manifestation of God can call the people to the True
Religion. If someone calls the people towards something else - it
is not accepted. Only the call of the Manifestation of God prevails:

“For Him alone is the call for truth; any others that they
> call upon besides Him hear them no more than if they were
> to stretch forth their hands for water to reach their mouths
> but it reaches them not.”                              (Qur’án, 13:14)
5\. To abrogate the old laws

A Manifestation of God is authorised by God to promulgate

such Laws which are necessary for the human society in His Age
and also to abrogate such Laws of the past which are no more
needed. No one devoid of the authority from God can accomplish
this. Nay he can never even dare to produce a single verse:

“None of Our revelations do We abrogate or cause to be
forgotten but We substitute something better or similar.”
“And it was never the part of an Apostle to bring a verse
except as Alláh permitted. For each period is a Book (revealed):”
6\. To give reward and punishment

A Manifestation of God and His Book is the standard for
Justice. The righteous recognise the new Advent and are thus
rewarded for their good deeds by God. The rebellious and oblivious
fail to accept the new Messenger of God. Due to this negligence
they are punished. Without a Manifestation of God truth can not
be distinguished from error, nor will there remain any difference
between good and bad. However God, in His infinite Justice,
never treats a believer equal to a non-believer. Therefore He
establishes this standard at every appointed hour:

“Shall We treat those who believe and work deeds of
> righteousness the same as those who do mischief on earth?
> Shall We treat those who guard against evil the same as those
> who turn from the right?”                          (Qur’án, 38:28)
7\. To establish justice

A Manifestation of God appears to establish moderation,
fair-play, and justice in the society. He eliminates atrocities and
injustices by calling the people towards the Words of God:

“We sent aforetime Our Apostles with clear signs and
> sent down with Them the Book and the Balance that men may
> stand forth in Justice.”                           (Qur’án, 57:25)

Thus a Messenger of God sanctifies the society from the
defilements of lawlessness, tyranny and disbelief. No philosopher, thinker,
reformer, statesman or politician can ever accomplish this sublime
purpose.
8\. To promote love and affection

A Messenger of God is commissioned by God to promote
love and harmony between the people by eliminating all traces of
animosity, jealousy, hatred, discord and estrangements. He receives
this power from God. All the Messengers of God have
accomplished this great task. It is impossible to unite the hearts
of the people without the confirmations of the Holy Spirit. No
government, howsoever powerful, no knowledge, howsoever
profound, and no wealth, howsoever generous, can ever hope to
unite the hearts of the people. The Qur’án informs Prophet
Muḥammad that if He had spent all the wealth of the heaven and
the earth, still He would have failed to unite the people of Arabia
and to create love in the different hostile Arabian clans. However
God had accomplished this:

“And he hath put affection between their hearts; not if
> thou hadst spent all that is in the earth, couldst thou have
produced that affection but Alláh hath done it …”

(Qur’án, 8, 63)
Today Bahá’u’lláh has united, through the Words of God,
the hearts of the countless number of people from all religious
backgrounds, from all the five continents of the globe—
representing thousands of diverse ethnic origin. Who else could
have accomplished this magnificent task but a Manifestation of
God!
9\. To establish injunctions

Only a Manifestation of God is authorised to promulgate
such injunctions which are binding for all. He in His divine wisdom
and according to the need of the age, sets, with the authority

and power of God, the standard for ‘do’ and ‘do not’ (i.e. Ḥalál
and Ḥarám)

“(I have come to you) to attest the Law of Torah which
> was before me and to make lawful to you part of what was
(before) forbidden to you.”                         (Qur’án, 3:50)

“for He (Muḥammad) commands them what is just and
> forbids them what is evil; He allows them as lawful what is
good and prohibits them from what is bad.”
“They ask thee what is lawful to them, say; Lawful unto
you are things good and pure.”                      (Qur’án, 5:5)
10\. To guide

A Manifestation of God offers, on behalf of God, a code of
life and a world order:

“It is He Who hath sent His Apostle with guidance and
religion of truth.”                                 (Qur’án, 9:33)

The laws and ordinances, promulgated by the nations and
governments, are constituted under the influence of their own
selfish designs and corrupt inclinations. Hence they are always
incomplete and short-sighted. Only a Messenger of God can give
a complete and comprehensive code of life and world-embracing
Laws:

“But if they hearken not to Thee, know that they only
> follow their own lusts, and who is more astray than one who
follows his own lusts, devoid of guidance from Alláh?”
God has bestowed for this age His guidance and laws, through
Bahá’u’lláh, which can alone ensure the progress, prosperity,
security and happiness of the peoples both in this world and the
world to come.

11. To combat ‘Shirk’

When man forgets his Creator and indulges in ‘Shirk’ i.e.

seeking partners with God—a Messenger of God appears to show
him the path of the oneness of God:

“No partner hath He; thus am I commanded, and I am
the first of those who bow to His Will.”         (Qur’án, 6:163)

As the people of this age had made material things—riches
and wealth, honour and power, status and position, armies and
forces, learning and knowledge as well as all sorts of selfish
desires—their cherished goal and adoration, God has made
Bahá’u’lláh manifest to teach real values and the pure oneness of
God. To release the people from the limited sphere of material
attachments, worldly thoughts, beliefs and deeds and to make
them able to soar in the sky of unity of God is truly a miracle.
12\. To renew love

God has assigned a specific time limit for the beginning, rise
and fall of each nation. When a nation reaches its destined end,
it loses its freedom of thought, fervour of actions and the spirit
of unity. The tenderness of their hearts gives way to butchery.
They lose their love and unity and become selfish. At such a time
a Messenger of God appears to revive and recreate love, unity
and cooperation in human society:

“And that they should not become like those to whom
> was given Revelation aforetime, but long ages passed over
them and their hearts grew hard.”                 (Qur’án, 57:16)

The Muslims are no exception in this regard. They also had
a fixed period—‘an appointed hour’ in the words of Qur’án.
When that appointed hour came and their fixed period was over
their hearts became hardened like stones. The Holy Qur’án itself
confirms that in the time of the new Manifestation of God even
those who are apparently friends will actually be foes of each
other:

“Friends on that day will be foes, one to another except
> the righteous.”                                      (Qur’án, 43:67)
> Therefore, the purpose of the advent of Bahá’u’lláh was to
create love and amity in the hearts.
13\. To sanctify and educate the people

Another duty of a Manifestation of God is that He purges
the hearts of the people from all defilements of carnal desires and
cleans their minds of all lowly thoughts, and instils in them pious
desires, high ambitions and lofty feelings as well as beneficial
thoughts. This is called ‘Tazkíyyih’ i.e. sanctification:

“Alláh did confer a great favour on the believers when
> He sent among them an Apostle from among themselves,
> rehearsing unto them the signs of Alláh, sanctifying them, and
> instructing them in Scripture and wisdom, while before that
they had been in manifest error.”                    (Qur’án, 3:164)

Like a kind mother, the Manifestation of God trains, through
the Power of God and His teachings, each individual, and trains
him for the establishment of a heavenly society. He decorates the
people with the knowledge of God. He blots out from their minds
all traces of doubts, rebellious and mundane thoughts. He teaches
them the art of using the experiences gained through sanctification
and purification and education for the betterment of the society.

The process of ‘sanctification and purification’ pertains to
the inner world of man and education and training refines his
mind and the faculty of contemplation and enables him to establish
a relation, based on prudence and sanctity, between himself and
the society. Bahá’u’lláh has sanctified the souls and trained the
minds of millions of the people, throughout the world in such a
wonderful way that the world is lost in astonishment.
14\. To grant freedom

God has created man free. He wants to see him free from all

material bondage and fetters but a servant of Himself. However,
it often happens that this free-creature, man, does not use the
faculties of his own free mind and thought and becomes a prey
to the ideas of others.

Manifestations of God have been appearing to release the
people from the fetters of religious and political leaders:

“He releases them from their heavy burdens and from
the yokes that are upon them.”                    (Qur’án, 7:157)

Bahá’u’lláh has taught that no one should follow any other
person in blind faith. Every individual should independently
investigate the truth for himself and is free to choose a religion
which appeals to him. In the Bahá’í society and administration
there is mutual respect and love, but the affairs are settled through
free, frank and loving consultation aimed at investigation of truth.
15\. To remove differences

One of the duties of a Manifestation of God is to unite the
people by removing the differences between them. In fact God’s
teachings are simple, easy and practicable in their original form.
People accept them and uphold them in the face of all oppositions
and trials. However with the passage of time, the learned, in
order to gain name, fame and power, begin to explain the simple
teachings of the Messenger of God in such complicated terms
that they divide the one single nation into numerous sects and
sub-sects. This starts an endless war amongst the followers of
different sects of the same religion:

“Nor did the people of Book dissent therefrom except
> through envy of each other, after knowledge had come to
> them. But if any deny the signs of Alláh, Alláh is swift in
calling to account.”                                 (Qur’án, 3:19)

“And they became divided only after knowledge reached
> them, through selfish envy as between themselves.”

“It was only after knowledge had been granted to them
> that they fell into schisms, through insolent envy among
themselves.”                                         (Qur’án, 45:17)

One of the divine chastisements, according to the Holy
Qur’án, is that the people become divided into sects and different
sects remain scared of each other. Is not the Muslim world under
this chastisement? Are not the Muslims divided into hundreds of
religious and political sects?

Whenever such a situation prevailed, in the past, a Messenger
of God has appeared and united different peoples:

“Be not like those who are divided amongst themselves
> and fall into disputations after receiving clear signs. For them
is a dreadful penalty.”                                (Qur’án, 3:105)

Bahá’u’lláh has also done the same thing in a very wonderful
way. He has united peoples from different religious, social,
economic, political and cultural backgrounds into one Faith and
one world-embracing community. Who else but a Manifestation
of God could have accomplished it? Is not it a miracle? Albeit,
it is; because:

“… their Lord is the accomplisher of what He pleaseth.”
Referring to this very unification of the peoples of the world,
God promises:

“If thy Lord had so willed, He could have made mankind
one people.”                                      (Qur’án, 5:51)
16\. To enlighten the people

A Manifestation of God reveals a Book of God which is
LIGHT.   The understanding, knowledge, desires, ambitions,
consultations, experiences, words, writings, speeches, thoughts,
ideas, theories, nay each and every thing which pertaineth to men

alone is darkness. While the true light, guidance, salvation, bounty,
prosperity, forgiveness, security, happiness, contentment and all
other blessings come from God through His Messengers. The
Manifestation of God delivers mankind from the darkness and
leads it to light:

“He is the One Who sends to His servants manifest signs,
> that He may lead you from the depths of darkness into the
> light, and verily Alláh is to you most kind and merciful.”

In this God-given light men explore themselves, and reveal
the mystery of the universe. By the same light man witnesses the
attributes of God and recognises the station of His Manifestation.
This very light enables him to see the way of life and its ups and
downs and appreciate the beauty of goodly deeds and apprehend
the wrong. Without this light their condition would be very much
similar to those who were as if watching a movie in a hall and
suddenly the electricity was cut off.

Today God’s light for the people of the world is the Faith
revealed by Bahá’u’lláh.

The criterion
The pages of history bear witness that not a single liar who
had made a claim that he has been the recipient of a revelation
from God has ever met with success in his evil designs. Had a
liar been also successful in his claims then there would have
remained no distinction between a blasphemer and a Messenger
of God. In such a case truth and falsehood, believer and unbeliever
would have acquired the same status. This will give an impression
that God is impotent—unimaginable!

The Holy Qur’án has laid down certain universal criteria
according to which all the Messengers of God, right from Adam
to Bahá’u’lláh, may be judged and proven true. These criteria are
such that neither any blasphemer can ever hope to show it nor
any true Manifestation of God can escape them.

Some of these criteria are the following:
1\. Revelation of a new book of God

“… and is it not enough for them that We have sent down
> to thee the Book which is rehearsed to them? Verily, in it is
> mercy and reminder to those who believe …”

Albeit the philosophers, scholars and reformers have been
writing books. None of them have ever said that their book was
the word of God.
2\. Fulfilment of the prophecies of the past
holy books

The latest Manifestation of God, positively, fulfills the
prophecies of the past Scriptures:

“They say: ‘why does he not bring us a sign from his
Lord?’ Has not a clear sign come to them of all that was in

the former Books of revelation?”                     (Qur’án, 20:133)
3\. Followers of a true Manifestation
increase day by day

Whatever claims a true Manifestation of God makes, they
are widely accepted and the number of His followers increase day
by day:

“But those who dispute concerning Alláh after He has
> been accepted—futile is their dispute in the sight of their
> Lord: On them is wrath, and for them will be a penalty
terrible …”                                          (Qur’án, 42:16)

The people do not accept a Manifestation of God due to any
fear or temptation or lust, but for the sake of the love of God
only. On the contrary those who reject the new Manifestation of
God are the followers of their selfish desires:

“But if they hearken not to thee, know that they only
> follow their own lusts: and who is more astray than one who
> follows his own lusts, devoid of guidance from Alláh?”
> The Holy Qur’án outrightly rejects the idea that a false book
can be revealed in the name of Alláh:

“What! have they partners (in Godhead) who have established
for them some religion without the permission of Alláh?”
It also declares that the people cannot believe in a liar:

“For Him is call for truth: any others that they call upon
> besides Him hear them no more than if they were to stretch
> forth their hands for water to reach their mouth but it reaches
> them not.”                                            (Qur’án, 13:14)
> The, validity of the Proclamation of Bahá’u’lláh is proved

according to each of the above-mentioned criteria. He revealed a
Book of Laws called ‘Al-Aqdas’, He has fulfilled many prophecies
given in all the past Scriptures, and His Message has been widely
accepted and the number of His followers is increasing day by
day in all corners of the earth.
4\. God will render Him triumphant in the
face of all opposition

God has promised His confirmation and aid to His
Messengers and Their followers:

“And every people plotted against their apostle to seize
> him, and disputed by means of vanities, therewith to condemn
> the truth, but it was I that seized them! and how (terrible)
> was My requital!”                                      (Qur’án, 40:5)
God mentions in another place that it is only He and His
Messenger Who are triumphant:

“Alláh has declared: ‘It is I and My apostle Who must
> prevail.’ For Alláh is One full of strength, able to enforce His
> will.”                                                (Qur’án, 58:21)
And He reassures:

“Already has Our Word been passed before (this) to Our
> servants sent (by Us) that they would certainly be assisted,
> and that Our forces—they surely must conquer …”

Bahá’u’lláh spent His whole life in hardships and prisons—
He was chained, bastinadoed, exiled, tortured and wronged. His
opponents plotted against Him, spread accusations against Him,
tried to kill Him, gave Him poison in His food and did whatever
they could to disgrace and defame Him in the face of public
opinion. Among His oppressors were two powerful dynasties of
His time:- The Persian and Ottoman empires. They left no stone
unturned in order to efface Him and His influence. The learned

of His day used all their talents of speech and writing to undo the
Mission proclaimed by Bahá’u’lláh and the general public was let
loose like enraged tigers to shed the blood of His followers. More
than twenty thousand people were martyred in His Path. In spite
of all this, the Cause of Bahá’u’lláh spread throughout the world!
If this is not a miracle then what is a miracle? And if this is not
a divine confirmation then what does the term ‘confirmation’
stand for?

“Then in what exposition will they believe after (rejecting)
Alláh and His signs?”                                (Qur’án, 45:6)
5\. Non-existence of any contradiction in
the revealed words

According to the Holy Qur’án, the fifth criterion of a
Manifestation of God is that there exists no contradiction in the
Words He reveals, in the Laws He promulgates, and in the
Teachings He bestows. The presence of contradictions in the
Words (Kalám) is a sign of the fact that it is man-made. People
forget what they have said earlier, they learn new facts with
experience which are sometimes opposite to what they considered
as truths earlier and thus their statements vary and contradict
each other. Man tends to change with the changing circumstances.
Fear or temptations often effect his mood and thoughts. On the
contrary, a Manifestation of God is immune to these weaknesses.
God confirms that if the Qur’án was not from Him then there
would exist contradictions in it:

“Had it (Qur’án) been from other than Alláh, they would
surely have found therein much discrepancy.”
Bahá’u’lláh has revealed more than 100 volumes of Holy
Writings in Arabic and Persian. This He has accomplished over
a period of forty years. However, one can find no contradiction,
defect of ‘discrepancy’ in His Words, Thoughts and Laws. This
is yet another evidence of the validity of His Mission.

6. A true Manifestation of God remains
steadfast in His claims

This is the sixth criterion set forth in the Holy Qur’án that
a true Messenger of God remains steadfast in His claims. It is
rather a challenge to the followers of vain imaginings that if they
are true in their claims of Faith then they should long for death
and thus prove the validity of their words:

“Say: ‘if the last home, with Alláh, be for you specially,
> and not for anyone else, then seek ye for death, if ye are
sincere.”                                              (Qur’án, 2:94)

As already mentioned above, the followers of the Báb and
Bahá’u’lláh have always laid down their lives in the path of their
Faith. They have testified with their blood that Bahá’u’lláh is a
Manifestation of God.

Bahá’u’lláh Himself testifies to this, in one of His Tablets,
that to lay down one’s life in the path of the love for the Merciful
is a true witness. Whereas no wise man will sacrifice his life
without a proof or reason. If it is said that these people (who have
sacrificed their lives in the Path of Bahá’u’lláh) were mad then
it is far from reality. It was not a matter of one or two persons.
Rather people in great numbers and from all the strata of society,
intoxicated with the Kawthar of the knowledge of God, rushed to
the altar of martyrdom. If such souls, who had detached themselves
from all else but God and had sacrificed their worldly lives and
earthly possessions in the path of the Truth, are refuted then how
can one prove and establish the truth of any other Messenger of
God?

Moreover, the validity of the claim and the station of the
Manifestations of God can also be proved by the following logics:
i. He possesses innate knowledge

A true Manifestation of God neither receives any formal
education nor is trained in any current arts, crafts or sciences. As

the mirror of His heart is sanctified of all the defilements of
acquired knowledge, it reflects the divine Knowledge of God.
Thus no trace of any personal desire can be found in His
Utterances. His knowledge is a gift from God and His wisdom is
infinite.
ii. He appears in a time of need

A Manifestation of God always appears in a time when He
is the most needed. He promulgates such laws and principles
which are essential for the peoples and nations of the world. He
never claims any particular thought, idea or theory to be His
own, but rather attributes them to God. He declares that all of
His qualities are a bounty and gift of God.
iii. His utterance penetrates the hearts of

> men
> The Words of a Manifestation of God are so powerful and
penetrating that they attract the hearts of men and are capable of
changing them. He exerts such an influence on the people that
they foresake all their past habits and arise with His new
programme with such an eagerness, zeal and strength that they,
if they are required to do so, sacrifice all their earthly possessions
and worldly desires in His love. It is not possible for any follower
of a philosopher or thinker to make such sacrifices.
iv. He proclaims a new Faith

A Manifestation of God never introduces a new sect into any
other existing religion. He rather proclaims a new Faith, albeit
that He also confirms the past Manifestations and Their Books.
He is always sanctified from all the worldly things and means. He
never propagates His Mission through wealth or fortune, nor
does He become victorious by using governmental powers. He is
neither aided in His claims by His near and dear ones, His relatives
and friends, nor is He dependent on any worldly knowledge. Thus
a Manifestation of God is deprived of all the material means for
success i.e. wealth, governmental power, and worldly knowledge.

If the success of a Manifestation of God was made conditioned
with these material resources then any one possessing these
resources could have claimed the station of a Manifestation. But
God has made a very distinct standard. God shows He is doing
so at the present through Bahá’u’lláh.
v. He imparts new knowledge and

> enlightenment
> A Manifestation of God unseals the secrets and mysteries of
past Scriptures. He gives new knowledge of God. He opens the
doors of new capacities and learning. He blots off the darkness
of doubts and misunderstandings from among the people and
helps them increase their faith and certitude. All branches of
human knowledge, thinking and intellect are revolutionised by
His coming and the hidden potentialities of men are made manifest
by His appearance. In fact a new life is released by Him.
vi. He is bold and firm in His claims

A Manifestation of God is bold, generous and kind-hearted.

He remains steadfast in His claims throughout His life. Neither
can He be threatened or be tempted to surrender. He does not
care for any worldly possessions nor does He long for any pomp
and show.
vii. He changes the life of people

A Manifestation of God can change the hearts. He turns the
wicked into pious people and makes the wrong-doer, one who is
good and charitable. He changes and trains people and constructs
a better society. He presents solutions for all the problems of life.
He installs in the people the fear of God and teaches them how
to protect the rights and honours of mankind. He shows them the
way to worldly glory as well as the path of eternal salvation.

Thus all the criteria through which the claim of a
Manifestation of God is tested have been fulfilled by Bahá’u’lláh.

PROPHECIES FROM THE HOLY QUR’ÁN
(REGARDING THE ADVENT OF BAHÁ’U’LLÁH)

Bahá’u’lláh
The advent of Bahá’u’lláh has been very frequently
prophesied by the Holy Qur’án. In the previous chapters, we have
discussed different Quranic terminologies and explained them in
the light of the new divine knowledge brought by Bahá’u’lláh for
this glorious age. In this chapter and in those which will follow,
we will review such verses of the Holy Qur’án which guide us to
recognise this Mightiest of the advents the earth has ever witnessed.
1\. A prayer
“Show us the straight way [Ṣiráṭu’l-Mustaqím]”
Now the question arises ‘What is the straight way?’ The
Qur’án answers:

“Say: ‘Verily, my Lord hath guided me to a Way that is
straight—a religion of right—the Path (trod) by Abraham …’”
In the above-mentioned verse ‘the straight way’ is referred
to as ‘a religion of God’. Is it not clear that the Muslims are also
subject to the same situation of rise and fall which met other
nations in the past? All the nations, including the Muslims, were
given a fixed period. After that fixed period or appointed hour,
another Manifestation of God was to come to guide them.
Therefore, this prayer was revealed by God for the Muslims that
they might say it until the appointed hour and would not go
astray by rejecting the ‘straight way’ laid before them by the next
advent. No wonder that this prayer lies in the very beginning of
the Holy Qur’án.
Let’s review another verse:

“And (Jesus) shall be a sign (for the coming of) the Hour
(of judgement): therefore have no doubt about the Hour but

> follow ye Me: this is Straight Way.”                 (Qur’án, 43:61)
> In this verse the Christ has been referred to as a ‘sign’ and
‘standard’ for the ‘appointed Hour’, i.e. the time of the Advent
of Bahá’u’lláh. And this has been called as the ‘straight way’. In
the following verse, God Himself explains the nature of the
‘straight way’:

“The way of those on whom Thou halt bestowed Thy
> Grace, those whose (portion) is not wrath (Maghḍúb) and
> who go not astray, (ḍállín):”                       (Qur’án, 1:7)
> It is clear that the Muslims are made to pray for guidance
towards the ‘way’ of the people on whom God will reveal a new
Book. By the term ‘grace’ or ‘favour’, a revelation of God is
meant:

“He (Jesus) was no more than a servant; We granted
> Our favour to Him, and We made Him an example to the
Children of Israel.”                             (Qur’án, 43:59)

The Jews, who had rejected Christ, were called ‘the cursed
ones (Maghḍúb)’. And the Christians, who rejected Prophet
Muḥammad, were termed as ‘those astray (Ḍállín)’. The Muslims
have been warned in this prayer that they should not follow in the
footsteps of these people. And they should not remain deprived of
the favours from God, i.e. they should not reject Bahá’u’lláh.
2\. To believe in the new Book

“… and who believe in the revelation sent to thee, and
> sent before thy time, and (in their heart) have the assurance
of the hereafter (Ákhir).”                              (Qur’án, 2:4)

In these holy verses the qualities of the pure in heart
(Muttaqín) are enumerated. It is stated that the pure in heart are
those who believe in the past revelations and in the Qur’án as
well as in the fact that after the Qur’án a new revelation of God
will also come. Thus, according to this verse, a true Muslim is

bound to believe in all the past revelations, in the revelation
brought by Prophet Muḥammad and in the future revelations.
Hence it is incumbent upon a Muslim, in the light of this verse,
to believe in the advent of Bahá’u’lláh if he is pure in heart.
3\. New life for Muslims

“How can ye reject the Faith in Alláh? Seeing that ye
> were without life, and He gave you life. Then will He cause
> you to die, and will again bring you to life, and again to Him
will ye return.”                                       (Qur’án, 2:28)

In this verse, God addresses the people present at the time
of the revelation of the Qur’án and tells them that they can in no
way reject God, i.e. His Manifestation, because He had bestowed
upon them, through His Prophet and the Holy Qur’án, a new life
after they had become spiritually dead. God also foretells that the
Muslims will also die by becoming incredulous in Faith, slack in
deeds and divided in their collective life. However He assures that
this death will not be a final one. God will, through Bahá’u’lláh,
give new life to the Muslims and other people. Then they will
worship God and follow His guidance and become a new nation.

Two deaths and two lives have been mentioned in the above-
mentioned verse. None of them is a physical one. They are spiritual
‘life’ and ‘death’. The Muslims have met their spiritual death and
are now being given a new spiritual life through the advent of
Bahá’u’lláh. As mentioned elsewhere in this book whenever life
or death is mentioned in a Holy Book it refers to the same spiritual
life and death. Thus it has been mentioned:

“And it is He who gave you life, will cause you to die,
> and will again give you life. Truly man is a most ungrateful
> creature.”                                         (Qur’án, 22:66)
4\. New commandments

“None of Our revelations do We abrogate or cause to be
forgotten but We substitute better or similar one, knowest

thou not that Alláh hath power over all things?”
Here God has explained His eternal law of abrogation
(Tansíkh) and revelation (Tanzíl). When He abrogates His Laws
and Ordinances, or when the original meaning and purpose of
these Laws is forgotten by the age, God does not leave the people
in confusion. He reveals new Laws which may or may not resemble
those of the past revelation. Today the situation is this that the
believers have forgotten the old order, so that it has become
impossible to act according to the laws and ordinances of the
past. New laws and principles are therefore required to guide this
age. God is able to do anything He likes and reveal whatever He
wishes. No one can frustrate His designs. Hence He has given,
through Bahá’u’lláh new laws and ordinances for this age. And
has proclaimed, through Bahá’u’lláh, new principles for this era.
There is no one to question His sovereignty nor any one can give
Him any instructions.
5\. The middle nation

“Thus have We made you a middle Ummah that ye may
> be witness over the nations and the Apostle a witness over
yourselves.”                                       (Qur’án, 2:143)

In the verse, preceding the above-quoted verse the famous
incident of ‘Taḥvíl-i-Qiblih’, i.e. the change of the point of
adoration has been mentioned. The previous ummah considered
the Jerusalem as the ‘Qiblih’. The Muslims were given another
‘Qiblih’, i.e. the Ka‘bih in Mecca. The Ummah following the
Muslims, i.e. the Bahá’ís, have been given a new ‘Qiblih’. The
Muslims have been called in this verse, “the middle Ummah”,
not the last Ummah. That is to say that there were nations before
the Muslims and there will be nations after them. It is also
mentioned in this verse that just as the Muslims were made witness
over the acts of the past nations, the Apostle, ‘Al-Rasúl’ will be
a witness over them. The term ‘the Apostle’ or ‘Al-Rasúl’ is used
for Bahá’u’lláh. In Arabic when a common noun is prefixed with
‘Al’ it becomes a proper noun. Thus by ‘Al-Rasúl’ is meant that

Messenger of God whose advent has been promised to the Muslims
and whose coming they are eagerly. awaiting.
6\. Freedom of the Jews

“Behold Alláh said, ‘O Jesus I will take thee and raise
> thee to myself and clear thee (of the falsehood) of those who
> blaspheme. I will make those who follow thee above those who
> reject Faith, to the Day of Resurrection. Then shall ye all
> return unto Me. And I will judge between you of the matters
wherein ye dispute.”                                  (Qur’án, 3:55)

This verse tells that God had subjugated the Jews, due to
their rejection of Jesus, to the Christians. It foretells that this
condition will remain as it is until the Day of Resurrection. On
the Day of Resurrection, God will decide between those nations
and they will be made agreed and united. At the time of the
second coming of Christ, they will become one by accepting Him.
The term ‘resurrection’ has been discussed elsewhere in this
book. Accordingly, when resurrection took place and Bahá’u’lláh
appeared with renewed teachings He decided between the Jews
and the Christians. The Jews became independent and free of
Christian domination and established themselves as a free nation.
On the other hand, thousands of Jews and Christians have become
united under the banner of Bahá’u’lláh.
7\. The Covenant of the Prophets

“Behold Alláh took the covenant of the prophets, saying:
> ‘I give you a Book and wisdom; then comes to you an apostle
> confirming what is with you; do ye believe in him and render
> him help.’”                                         (Qur’án, 3:81)
> The period from Adam to Prophet Muḥammad is called
‘Dur-i-Nabuvvat’, i.e. the Prophetic Cycle. God has taken a
promise from each of the Prophets of that cycle that when at the
end of the Prophetic Cycle the Greatest of the Manifestations of
God appears, their nations should believe in Him. By His advent

a new Age will begin and He will confirm the Books of the past.

Thus an oath has been taken from all the Prophets to accept
Bahá’u’lláh and their followers have been commissioned to believe
in Him and teach His Cause and assist Him.
8\. Unification of nations

“Alláh there is no God but He; of a surety He will gather
> you together in the day of judgement, about which there is no
doubt and whose word can be truer than Alláh’s?”
The Arabic term ‘Qiyámah’ has been translated here as ‘the
day of judgement’. We have explained it earlier that ‘Qiyámah’
is established through the advent of a new Messenger of God. In
the past it was not possible to gather all the nations and peoples
together due to the obstacles of seas, mountains and deserts.
However God has taken an oath, in this verse, by His own Oneness
that He will, on the day of judgement, gather all the peoples of
the world into one Faith and one Mission. He says this with
added emphasis that He will surely gather them together and the
oneness of God will be witnessed in the unified nations. This
promise of God has come true by the Advent of Bahá’u’lláh.
Today people from all religious, ethnic, cultural, linguistic, racial
and social backgrounds in all parts of the world are becoming
united under the banner of the Bahá’í Faith. Such unity of the
diverse elements of the world society was never witnessed in the
past nor was it possible. In fact no one can be truer and more
faithful than God in His promise.
9\. Muslims are called to believe

“O ye who believe! Believe in Alláh and His apostle, and
> the scripture which He sent to those before (him) and who
> denieth Alláh, His angels, His books, His apostles, and the
> Day of judgement, hath gone astray.”                (Qur’án, 4:136)
> In this verse the Muslims are addressed. In the Qur’án, the

other inhabitants of Arabia who did not believe in Prophet
Muḥammad are called ‘Kuffár’, i.e. infidels. God says in this
verse that the people who have believed in Muḥammad and the
Holy Qur’án, are also advised to believe in the Books of the past
and not to deny the future revelations from God. This is because
all the Holy Books are but chapters of the One Mother Book
which is with God. God warns the Muslims that if they deny
God, His angel-like believers, His Books and His Messengers in
the day which is yet to come, i.e. the day of the Advent of
Bahá’u’lláh, then they will be of those who have gone astray.
Thus the Muslims have been called to believe in the Day of
judgement, i.e. the advent of Bahá’u’lláh.
10\. Warning of removal

“Thy Lord is self-sufficient, full of mercy, if it were His
> will, He could destroy you, and in your place appoint whom
> He Will as your successors, as He raised you up from the
> posterity of other peoples. All that hath been promised unto
you will come to pass; nor can ye frustrate it.”
In this verse God warns the Muslims that they should not
think that they are the last nation and that no other nation can
succeed them. He confirms that His material as well as spiritual
bounties and mercies have always descended upon people and
will continue to descend in the future.

God has further clarified that the promise of the raising of
a new nation is not a mere warning. He says it with emphasis
that a new nation will be raised of a certainty and it will surely
take the place of the Muslim nation just as the Muslims have
been raised from the posterity of the past nations. He also
proclaims that no one can frustrate His Will or Mission. This
irrevocable promise of God has been fulfilled by the advent of
Bahá’u’lláh.

Let us review the following verse:

“Did not ye see that God hath created heaven and the
> earth as they ought to be? If He wishes, He will take you
away and bring (in your place) a new creation.”
The law of the succession of the nations is explained here.

That God has created the earth and the heaven with a definite
purpose—for the establishment of His Kingdom. The Muslims
have been told that God will, When He wishes, bring in their
place a new creation. And thus nations will be raised after each
nation till the Kingdom of God is established on this earth. Further
explanation can be drawn from the following verse:

“If He so pleased, He could blot you out and bring in a
new creation: nor is that (at all) difficult for Alláh.”
11\. Believe in the next Manifestation

“To every people is a term appointed; when their term
> is reached, not an hour can they cause delay, nor (an hour)
> can they advance. O ye children of Adam, whenever there
> come to you apostles from amongst you, rehearsing My signs
> unto you—those who are righteous and mend (their lives) on
them shall be no fear nor shall they grieve.”
Before we study the above-quoted verses, let us look at a
few preceding verses in the same chapter:

“O Adam! dwell thou and thy wife in the garden, and
enjoy it as ye wish; but approach not this tree …”

(Qur’án 7:19)
Adam and His wife lived in the garden. However when they
approached the “forbidden tree’s” fruits, they were cast down and
God said to Them:

“(Alláh) said; Get ye down, with enmity between

> yourselves.”                                         (Qur’án, 7:24)
> After this the Children of Adam have been addressed at
several times and several instructions have been given to them.
For instance on one occasion the Children of Adam were reminded
that God had bestowed clothes upon them:

“O ye Children of Adam: We have bestowed raiment
upon you to cover your shame.”                 (Qur’án, 7:26)

On another occasion, God advised the Children of Adam
that they should guard themselves lest the Satan lead them astray;

“O Children of Adam! let not Satan seduce you, in the
> same manner as he got your parents out of the garden.”

On yet another occasion the Children of Adam were advised
to enter the mosques in good clothes;

“O Children of Adam! wear your beautiful apparel at
every mosque.”                                   (Qur’án, 7:31)

In all the above-quoted verse, the term ‘Children of Adam’
is used for the Muslims. Mosque is the house of worship for the
Muslims and they have been ordered to enter it in their beautiful
dresses. Likewise before the advent of Islám, the people of Arabia
used to circle around the Ka‘bih in Mecca in a nude condition.
Hence the Muslims have been asked to engage in worship in
beautiful clothes.

Similarly the term ‘Children of Adam’ is used in the above-
quoted verse (7:34–35), for the Muslims. There is another promise
made with Adam Himself. This should not be mixed up and
confused with the above-mentioned verses. The promise with Adam
is:

“He said, get ye down, both of you all together, from the
garden, with enmity one to another, but if, as is sure, there

comes to you guidance from Me, whosoever follows My
guidance will not lose his way, nor fall into misery.”
However, verse 34 of chapter 7 of the Holy Qur’án declares
a universal law that every nation has a beginning and an end. Its
period is preordained by God Himself. The Muslims are no
exception in this regard. In another place it is mentioned that for
every nation there is an Apostle:

“To every people is an Apostle, when their apostle comes,
> the matter will be judged between them with justice, and they
> will not be wronged.”                              (Qur’án, 10:47)
Likewise for every nation a period is preordained:

“To every people is a term appointed, when their term is
> reached, not an hour can they cause delay, nor (an hour) can
> they advance.”                                      (Qur’án, 10:49)
> Thus it is proved that God appoints for each nation a
Manifestation and a fixed period. When the appointed hour is
come and a Manifestation of God appears, He reveals a new
Book of God:

“And it was never the part of an Apostle to bring a sign
> except as Alláh permitted. For each period is a Book
(revealed).”                                        (Qur’án, 13:38)

It is not surprising that in spite of the following declaration
of the Holy Qur’án, the Muslims believe that they are the last
nation!

“O ye Children of Adam! whenever there comes to you
> Apostle from amongst you, rehearsing My signs unto you,
> those who are righteous and mend (their lives) on them shall
> be no fear, nor shall they grieve.”                  (Qur’án, 7:35)
> In this verse the Muslims are advised to accept the next

Messenger of God when He makes His appearance and reveals
new laws of God. According to Arabic literature, added emphasis
has been given to the coming of the New Messenger. It means
that the advent is a sure and certain promise.
12\. The revelation of words of God
according to human need

“And there is not a thing but its treasures are with Us,
> but We only send down thereof in due and ascertainable
measures.”                                            (Qur’án, 15:21)

In this verse it is mentioned that the source and inexhaustible
treasure of all things—all progress, inventions, discoveries,
revelation, the Word of God, the commandments of Alláh, His
laws and ordinances—is with God Himself. He gradually reveals
these things in accordance with the needs of the age and the
capacity and understanding of the people, and will continue to do
so in the future.

Accordingly, our kind Lord has revealed, through Bahá’u’lláh,
new words and laws for this age. The Mother Book of all the
divine books is still with God and it will give birth to thousands
of books in the future. What a blunder have they made who claim
that God has exhausted the stock of His Words, Revelation,
Guidance and Laws! God forbid!
13\. The vicinity of the al-Aqṣá Mosque

“Glory to (Alláh) who did take His servant for a journey
> by night from the sacred mosque (Masjid-i-Ḥarám) to the far
> off mosque (Masjid-i-Aqṣá), whose precincts we did bless”.

Bahá’u’lláh, the Promised One of all religions, was exiled to
‘Akká in 1868. He lived there till His Ascension in 1892. His
Shrine is in ‘Akká.

This region has been called in the Bible as ‘Rabavátu’l-

Quds’ i.e. ‘The Holy Mountains’ and ‘The Promised Land’. The
region of Mount Carmel and ‘Akká lie in the vicinity of the Al-
Aqṣá mosque. This vicinity has been blessed by God. God had
taken Prophet Muḥammad to the Al-Aqṣá and had shown Him
the precincts of that mosque i.e. the regions of ‘Akká and Haifa.
Thus in this verse of the Holy Qur’án, God says that how He had
shown to Prophet Muḥammad the places where Bahá’u’lláh lived
the last twenty-five years of His earthly life. The Shrine of the
Báb is also situated in this very region: on Mount Carmel. The
resting place of the Master, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, and the seat of the
Universal House of Justice and other international Bahá’í
Institutions are also situated in this very Holy Spot. The Spiritual
as well as the Administrative world centres of the promised nation
is established on Mount Carmel. Prophet Muḥammad was shown
all these signs.
14\. The advent of Universal Manifestation
of God

“One day We shall call together all human beings with
> their Messenger. Those who are given their Book in their
> right hand will read it (with pleasure) and they will not be
> dealt with unjustly in the least.”                    (Qur’án, 17:71)
> By ‘Messenger’ a Manifestation of God is meant. Another
word used for ‘Messenger’ is ‘Imám’ (leader):

“And remember that Abraham was tried by his Lord,
> with certain commands, which He fulfilled; He said; ‘I will
> make thee as Imám to the nations.’                (Qur’án, 2:124)
> In the above-quoted verse 17:71 the word Imám’ or
‘Messenger’ has been used as a common noun. This shows His
greatness, universality and uniqueness.

Today is that ‘promised day’ mentioned by God. Today God
has called all nations and peoples of the world towards one
Universal Manifestation—Bahá’u’lláh. Peoples from all corners
of the world have recognised Bahá’u’lláh as the Supreme

Manifestation of God, the Promised One of All Ages. The pure-
hearted people, were free from any blind imitations and prejudices,
received the Words of God, revealed by Bahá’u’lláh, in their
right hands and read it, as well as starting to practice it. With
such fortunate people no injustice was done.

In the past ages, the knowledge of science and technology
and means of communication was very much restricted. Hence
none of the Manifestations of God in the past could have achieved
the universality which the Message of Bahá’u’lláh has achieved
in 150 years. However, God declares:

“But those who were blind in this world, will be blind in
the hereafter, and most astray from the Path.”
It is mentioned in this verse that the people who will be
pious, do goodly deeds and possess seeing eyes during the Islamic
period will readily recognise the Promised One of all ages at the
time of His advent. However, those who will remain blind during
the period of Islám will be the same even during the Bahá’í Era.
Neither will they be able to see the truth nor can they perceive
its signs from the living things or in the universe. They will
remain far from the path of the truth. Most of the translators of
the Holy Qur’án have done a great mistake. They have translated
the singular term ‘Imám’ into a plural one i.e. ‘Imáms’. The
plural of ‘Imám’, in Arabic, is ‘A’imma’. The learned translators
did not even care to think that God could have used the plural
term if He had desired so. This is how the people change the
Holy Text to suit their own wishes and beliefs.
15\. The Qur’án will be taken away

“If it were Our Will, We could take away that which We
> have sent thee by inspiration, then wouldst thou find none to
plead the affairs in that matter as against Us.”
A Law or Ordinance is called ‘the spirit of divine laws’.

Thus it has been explained:

“They ask thee concerning the Spirit. Say; ‘The Spirit is
> by command of my Lord: of knowledge it is only a little that
is communicated to you.’”                          (Qur’án, 17:85)

In this verse it is mentioned that people asked from Prophet
Muḥammad questions regarding the soul. He replied that the soul
is the Order of My God “Amr-i-Rabbí”. He further explained to
them that as they knew not much about the ‘Order of God’ it was
of no worth that they asked questions regarding it.

There is a mistake in the translation of the above-quoted
verse 17:86 of the Holy Qur’án. It starts with ‘If it were our
will …’ The correct translation will be—‘When it were Our Will …’
The style used in this place shows that there is no doubt or
condition. Rather an added stress is given. It means that “when
the Promised Day is come and a new universal Age is begun,
then, O Muḥammad, We will lift up that which We have sent to
you (i.e. the Holy Qur’án). There is no doubt in it”. In fact when
God addresses a Prophet, He addresses Him as the representative
of His followers. Hence the last part of the verse under review
means—O Muslims! at that time you will not be in a position to
do anything against Us. It is further promised that Laws and
Ordinances have been sent by God through ‘inspiration’ (Vaḥy)
and they will continue to come. Inspiration is actually a blessing
from God.
16\. The assemblage of the Jews

“And We said thereafter to the children of Israel, dwell
> securely in the land when the second of the promises come to
pass We shall gather you together in a mingled crowd.”
The Children of Israel were twice ousted from the Holy
Land. Once they were ousted when they had rejected Christ and
His Message.

They were scattered throughout the countries in the east and

in the west. They were forced to live a life full of disgrace and
humility. This episode has been recorded by the Holy Qur’án in
the following verses:

“And We gave warning to the children of Israel in the
> Book, that twice would they do mischief on the earth and be
> elated, with mighty arrogance. When the first of the warnings
> came to pass, We sent against you Our servants given to
> terrible warfare. They entered the very inmost parts of your
> homes, and it was a warning fulfilled. Then did We grant you
> (the children of Israel) return as against them. We gave you
> increase in resources and sons, and made you the more
> numerous in man-power. If ye did evil, (ye did it) against
> yourselves. So when the second of the warnings came to pass
> (We permitted your enemies) to disfigure your faces, and to
> enter your temple as they had entered it before, and to visit
with destruction all that fell into their power.”
In these verses the Jews have been given a glad tiding that
when the second promise will come to pass (i.e. the promise of
the advent of a Messenger of God) they will be gathered in the
Land of Israel in huge numbers:

“And We said thereafter to the children of Israel ‘dwell
> securely in the land but when the second of the warnings came
to pass, We shall gather you together in a mingled crowd.’”
It is a historic fact that before 1844 no Jew could enter the
Holy Land. In the year 1844 the Turkish Government signed an
edict of toleration. According to that edict the Jews were permitted
to enter the Holy Land. Thus God changed the condition of the
Jews and started showing them mercy and finally gathered them
in the Holy Land in 1948. God’s promise of bringing the Jews to
the ‘promised land’ was thus fulfilled.

With the advent of Bahá’u’lláh—the Lord of the Hosts and
the Deliverer of the nations, the yoke of humility was taken off

the neck of the Jews—the children of Israel. Thus the prophecies
of the Qur’án and the Bible were fulfilled.
17\. The sallying forth of ‘Ya’júj wa Ma’júj’ (Gog
and Magog)

“On that day We shall leave them to surge like waves on
> one another, then the trumpet will be blown, and We shall
> collect them all together.”                         (Qur’án 18:99)
> The rebellious tribes of Russia and northern China, the Tatars
and the Mongols were called the ‘Huns’ or the ‘Gogs’ and the
‘Magogs’. They used to infiltrate the regions of Adhirbáyján and
Armenia and engage in plundering. The borders of Persia and
Turkey had become unsafe due to their attacks. King Dara I, in
order to stop their attacks, constructed a fifty miles long wall at
Darband in the province of Dághistán on the western banks of
Caspian Sea. This wall was 10 feet wide and 29 feet high. Thus
he had stopped the northern tribes of the mountains from attacking
Írán.

God has made the release of these tribes as one of the signs
of the advent of the promised Day—the Day when the trumpet
will be sounded. In the Holy Qur’án the term ‘trumpet’ has been
used to mention the advent of a Manifestation of God. Thus it is
mentioned here that when Bahá’u’lláh will appear, these tribes
will unite and attack Asia and Europe. This was a true promise
of God which came to pass in the following way:
•    Alexander I, the ruler of Russia, fought against France in

1806;
•    The Russians waged a war against Sweden in 1809;
•    The Russians attacked Turkey in 1812;
•    When Nicholas, the brother of Alexander I, came to power,

> he again made war against Turkey and this war lasted for
> three years from 1837;
•    Napoleon, the military ruler of France, attacked Russia in

> 1812 and in 1848 the Russians entered into a war against
> Hungary.

The above list can be expanded by adding to it the details
of Russian expansions in the Caucasus and its war with Írán.

Let it be remembered that the Báb blew the first trumpet, in
1844\. He was the forerunner of Bahá’u’lláh. Bahá’u’lláh Himself
blew the second trumpet in 1863 as the Deliverer of the world.
It has been mentioned in the Qur’án:

“Until the (tribes of) Gog and Magog are let through
> (their barrier) and they swiftly swarm from every hill. Then
> will the true promise draw nigh. Then behold! the eyes of the
> unbelievers will fixedly stare in horror: “Ah! woe to us! we
were indeed heedless of this; Nay we truly did wrong!”

(Qur’án, 21, 96–97)
In the above verses of the Holy Qur’án it is prophesied that
when the ‘Gog and Magog’ will be freed and they will come
down from the mountains—that will be the sign of the fact that
the promised advent has come close. And it will be announced
that this is that very Day of the advent which was promised to
you:

“But the angels will meet them (and say) ‘this is your
> Day that ye were promised.”                       (Qur’án, 21:103)
> In 1806 the Russians started their attacks on Europe and
thus the wall was removed. Just after thirty-eight years of this
happening, in 1844, the Báb announced His Mission. Thus the
promise regarding blowing of the trumpet was fulfilled in such a
short period after the removal of the wall.
18\. The words of God will not be exhausted

“Say, ‘if the ocean were ink (wherewith to write out) for
> the words of my Lord, verily would the ocean be consumed,
> before the words of my Lord were consumed, even though we
> brought the like thereof to help.’”                (Qur’án, 18:109)
> God Himself testifies that if an ocean is turned into ink and

another ocean is also added to it, this ink will become exhausted,
but the words of God will not be consumed. Similarly God says:

“And if all the trees of the world were pens and the
> Ocean (were ink), with seven oceans behind it to add to it, yet
> would the word of Alláh not be exhausted; for Alláh is Exalted
in power, full of wisdom.”                           (Qur’án, 31:27)

Hence it is proved, in the light of the above-quoted verses,
that the words of God is inexhaustible and that they will continue
to be revealed according to the needs of the time. Even if all the
trees of the world become pens and they used all the seven seas
of the world as ink, still they would be exhausted before recording
the words of God as these are inexhaustible. Someone may say
that by these verses it is meant that the words, with which we
praise God, will not be exhausted, but this is a mistake. In these
verses the term ‘words of Alláh’ is used which is quite different
from the words with which we praise Him. Our words of praises
are not the ‘Words of Alláh’ but the ‘words of His servants’.

The ‘words’ are the verses of God revealed to the
Manifestation of God through inspiration. This term is also used
for the religion of God and the divine Laws. For example:

“Then learnt Adam from His Lord words of inspiration
and His Lord turned towards Him.”                (Qur’án, 2:37)

“But Alláh wished to justify the truth according to His
words and to cut off the roots of the unbelievers.”
Here it is mentioned that God wishes to prove the truth
through His words.

The question arises that whether it is the ‘words’ revealed in
the past or those which will be revealed in the future which are
referred to in the above-quoted verse? If we collect all the revealed
Books and Words of God sent in the past, their volume is certainly
not so much that they cannot be written down by ordinary means

and we will have to make pens of all the trees and ink from seven
seas!

Hence it is proved that the above-quoted verse refers to
those words of God which are to be revealed during the coming
billions of years through the chosen Manifestations of God.

The society is subject to evolution. There is no end to this
evolution nor is there any end to problems. At every stage of the
evolutionary process, new problems will arise. God will show us
the Path through His words revealed by His Manifestation at
each of the succeeding stages. There is no end for the Words of
God and His Messengers.
19\. There will be nothing awry in his
teachings

“On that day will they follow the caller (Ad-dá‘iya), there
> is no crookedness in him, all sounds shall humble themselves
> in the presence of most gracious; nothing shalt thou hear but
the tramp of their feet.”                          (Qur’án, 20:108)

Before discussing the above verse let’s ponder upon the
following verses;

“The day when the trumpet will be sounded; that day,
> We shall gather the sinful, blear-eyed. In whispers will they
> consult each other; ‘ye tarried not longer than ten (days)’. We
> know best what they will say, when their leader most eminent
in conduct will say; ye tarried not longer than a day!”
These verses prophesy that when the trumpet will be sounded
and the sinners will be gathered, they will talk to each other that
they remained alive only for ten (centuries).

But He Who will be aware of the word of God will tell them
that they remained alive for only one day i.e. one thousand years:

“He rules all affairs (Al-Amr, means Law of God) from
> the heavens to the earth; In the end will (affairs) go up to
> Him, on a day the space whereof will be as thousand years of
your reckoning.”                                        (Qur’án, 32:5)

Thus it is clearly mentioned that after 260 years of ruling
the affairs from the heaven plus 1,000 years of going up of the
affairs, God will remove, from among the peoples and nations,
the obstacles of dictatorial and totalitarian systems and mountains
of prejudices and will make the earth as one country and there
will remain no crookedness therein.

Now let’s consider the first quotation under this section. It
prophesies that on that day people will follow such a Messenger
of God Who will give them clear instructions. There will be no
crookedness in His teachings. His teachings will conform to human
nature and answer to the needs of the time. That Messenger of
God has been called as the ‘most gracious’. It is further prophesied
that in front of the Glory and Teachings of the ‘Most Gracious’
the sounds of all the philosophers, reformers and learned will
become seized. Nobody will pay any attention to their writings
and thoughts. A caravan of a new race of men will press forward,
in dignity, peace and order, towards the goal of establishing the
oneness of mankind. Only the tramp of their feet will be heard.
This prophecy has come true and the personality of Bahá’u’lláh,
His teachings and their effects testify to its truth.
20\. The old order will be rolled up

“The Day when We shall roll up the heavens as a recorder
> rolleth up a written scroll. As We began the first creation, We
> shall repeat it, a promise We have undertaken; truly shall We
fulfill it.”                                        (Qur’án, 21:104)

The above verse prophesies the collapse of old spiritual,
religious and administrative systems. It has also been prophesied
that the day of the advent of Bahá’u’lláh will be a day of perplexity
and struggle among the peoples. But the ones who will believe in
His advent will not be at all sorrowful. They will be given the

glad tidings that this is the very day about which you were
promised. On that day the old world will be rolled up just like
scroll is being rolled up and kept aside. It is, in fact, an allegory
which means that there will be new teachings, a new sky and a
new age. New potentialities for progress will be released and new
laws and system will be given. God explains that just as He had
initiated a new creation through Muḥammad, He will again initiate
a new nation through another of His manifestations, Bahá’u’lláh.
God Himself clarifies that it was not a mere admonition either.
Rather it is a promise of God which He Himself would fulfill.
God reassures us that He will not fail but fulfill His promise of
giving new laws and proclaiming new order of life. This promise
of God has come true with the advent of Bahá’u’lláh.

“Those who believe (in the Qur’án), those who follow the
> Jewish (scriptures) and the Sabeans, Christians, Magians and
> Ploytheists—Alláh will judge between them on the day of
judgement.”                                        (Qur’án, 22:17)

The Holy Qur’án has divided the people, according to their
belief and religion, into six major categories—Muslims, Jews,
Sabeans, Christians, Zoroastrians and the Polytheists (Hindus,
Buddhists etc.). Throughout the centuries the followers of these
religions and ideologies have been fighting amongst themselves.
Their religious leaders have created and nourished such a bigotry
and narrow-mindedness that each one of them calls the others as
infidels.

God has promised that He will settle their disputes, on the
day of the advent of His next Manifestation, through His teachings
of peace, love, unity and amity. And these peoples will become
one people.

The Kind God has fulfilled His promise. He has revealed the
Bahá’í Faith. Today the people from all corners of the world and
from each of the above-mentioned categories as well as even
those who did not believe in God are becoming united, in spirit
and as a new people, after accepting the Bahá’í Faith. The followers
of Bahá’u’lláh are uniting all the peoples of the world into one

universal religion. Who could have united such a diverse people
except a Manifestation of God?
21\. The gardens of Bahjí

“Who has created the heaven and the earth, and who
> sends down rain from the sky?, then with it, We cause to grow
> well-planted orchards full of beauty and delight (Bahjah).”

This verse testifies the oneness of God and that He has got
no partners. God is the creator of the heavens and the earth. He
causes the rain to fall and the gardens to grow. However if we
take its meaning as an allegory it will mean that—It is God Who
raises up the sky of religion and creates the earth of Faith. It is
He Who sends down from the heaven of His Will the rain of His
Revelation and from it He causes the garden of the ‘Bahjí’ (Beauty
and delight) to grow.

‘Bahjí’ is the place, about three miles from ‘Akká, where
Bahá’u’lláh lived as a prisoner. His holy Soul took His eternal
flight from this very place and He is buried at this holy spot
which is now surrounded by a beautiful, enchanting and fragrant
garden. In the above-quoted verse the same garden has been
referred to and is being praised.

The atmosphere and climate of ‘Akká was so much polluted
and poisonous, before Bahá’u’lláh had arrived there, that a proverb
says: “If a bird flies over ‘Akká, it will die before it passes the
town.” But when Bahá’u’lláh arrived in ‘Akká its climate and
atmosphere got transformed. The city became alive and vibrant.
The wilderness became a paradise with beautiful flowers. The
atmosphere became fragrant and sweet.
22\. Return to the primal point

“Verily He Who ordained the Qur’án for thee, will bring
> thee back to the place of return, say: ‘my Lord knows best
> who it is that brings true guidance, and who is in manifest

> error.’”                                             (Qur’án, 28:85)
> Every nation has a point of beginning and that of an end.

The point of the end is called ‘the point of return’. This point is
also called the ‘resurrection’. The term “resurrection” has been
discussed in detail, somewhere else in this book. Briefly speaking
whoever believes in the new Word of God, at this point, is
considered as the guided one and those who reject His signs lose
the Path. In the above-quoted verse it is foretold that the Muslims
will reach their point of return. It they will accept and believe in
the Promised One they will be guided. Otherwise, they will live
as those who are in manifest error.

This same law of the beginning and the end is also explained
in this verse:

“It is Alláh Who begins creation; then repeats it; then
shall ye be brought back to Him.”                   (Qur’án, 30:11)
23\. The period of Islám-1,260 years

“He directeth the ordinances from heaven to the earth, in
> the end it ascendeth unto Him in a Day, whereof the measure
is a thousand years of your reckoning.”              (Qur’án, 32:5)

The Arabic term “Tadvín-Al’amr?’ means “directing of the
ordinances.” It refers to the Revelation of the Holy Qur’án. By
heaven is meant “the heaven of the Will of God”. The period of
directing of the ordinances from the heaven to the earth is 260
years. During this period the Holy Qur’án was revealed, its verses
collected and classified, Islamic Jurisprudence were made and the
traditions (sayings) of Prophet Muḥammad were gathered and
recorded. After that comes the period of Islám and that of the
decline of the Muslim nation which is, according to this verse,
one thousand years. Thus the total period of Islám is 1,260 years.
Siyyid ‘Alí Muḥammad’, the Báb, declared His Mission as the
Promised One, the Mihdí and the Lord of the Age, on the fifth
day of Jamádíyu’l-Avval in the year 1260 (Islamic). Thus, God
has fulfilled another of His promises.

24. Covenant from the Prophets

“And remember We took from the prophets their
> covenant, as (We did) from thee, from Noah, Abraham, Moses
> and Jesus, the son of Mary, We took from them a solemn
> covenant.”                                         (Qur’án, 33:7)
God had taken a solemn covenant from the people, through
their respective Prophets, that they should not hesitate to accept
Bahá’u’lláh. Rather they should believe in Him and arise to assist
Him. This covenant was taken, without any exception, from each
and every Prophet including Muḥammad. There cannot be any
misunderstanding regarding this covenant because the Holy Qur’án
has clearly mentioned in the above verse: ‘as (We did) from thee
(0 Muḥammad)’. This is the same covenant mentioned in another
verse of the Qur’án:

“Behold! Alláh took the covenant of the Prophets, saying:
> I give you a Book and Wisdom; then comes to you an apostle
> confirming what is with you; do ye believe in him and render
> him help. Alláh said, ‘do ye agree, and take this my covenant
> as binding on you?’ They said, ‘we agree.’ He said, ‘then bear
witness, and I am with you among the witnesses.”
25\. Muḥammad is not the last Apostle (Rasúl)

“Muḥammad is not the father of any of your men, but
> (He is) the Apostle of Alláh (Rasúl Alláh) and the seal of the
> prophets (Khátamu’n-Nabíyyín)                       (Qur’án, 33:40)
The background of the above verse is that Prophet
Muḥammad had adopted an African slave, Zaid, as His son. In
the past the son of the Prophet used to become His successor. As
the people considered Zaid as the son of Muḥammad they thought
that he will also be the successor of Him—a Prophet. God has
clarified this position in this, above-mentioned, verse that:
a.    Muḥammad is not a father of any of the men;

b.   He is an Apostle (Messenger) of God;
c.   He is the seal of the prophets.

All the Prophets of God (Nabí) have prophesied the coming
of Bahá’u’lláh. Muḥammad was the last of those Prophets. God
declares that no more ‘Nabí’ will appear after Muḥammad as He
is the ‘Seal’ of them. But now the ‘great news’ (Naba’i-‘Aẓím)
will be made manifest. Muḥammad was the last ‘Nabí’ to give
the glad tidings of ‘a Message Supreme …’:

“Say, that is a Message Supreme …”              (Qur’án, 38:67)
There is no difference of opinion, among the Muslim scholars,
that an Apostle of God (Rasúl) and a Prophet (Nabí) are two
different ranks. A ‘Rasúl’ is one Who reveals the Word of God,
gives divine Laws and Ordinances and initiates a religion. He is
always independent of any other of the Apostles. Whereas a ‘Nabí’
is always a follower of some other Apostle (Rasúl) and does not
reveal any Book of God nor He promulgates any new divine laws
and ordinances. The Muslim scholars also agree on this point that
all the prophets (Nabí) were not ‘Apostles’ (Rasúl); but an Apostle
is, generally, a prophet also. This was the case with Muḥammad.
He had two stations—one that of an Apostle and another that of
a Prophet. He revealed a new Book as well as prophesied the
coming of Bahá’u’lláh.

Now, in the verse under review, Muḥammad has been
designated with two stations:
a.   He is the Apostle of God;
b.   He is the Seal of the Prophets.

If the station of an ‘Apostle’ and that of a ‘Prophet’ was
same then God would have said either ‘the apostle and the seal
of the apostles’ or ‘prophet and the seal of the prophets’. However
God has mentioned both of the stations separately and clearly.
This proves the Bahá’í belief that Muḥammad was not the last of
the ‘Apostles’ but the last of the ‘Prophets’.

26. Blowing of the trumpet

“The trumpet will be sounded, when all that are in the
> heavens and on the earth will swoon except such as it will
> please Alláh (to exempt) then will a second one be sounded,
when behold, they will be standing and looking.”
The declaration of a Manifestation of God is called the
‘sounding of the trumpet’. By this declaration the old age comes
to an end and a new one begins. Reckoning of the nations takes
place. Through the ‘call’ (Da‘vá) of the Manifestation of God a
new world comes into being and a new civilization is born. The
Holy Qur’án describes this spiritual and intellectual revolution as
‘Qiyámah’ i.e. resurrection. The above-quoted verse prophesies
the advent of two Manifestations of God, after Muḥammad. It
says that when the first Manifestation of God will raise His call
everyone will faint but those whom God will grant faith in the
new call. Those who will accept the new Manifestation of God
will neither faint nor will they be surprised. Then the second
Manifestation of God will blow the trumpet i.e. raise His call.
The people will rise and behold the new Manifestation. They will
accept Him and will witness new teachings, new life and many
changes.

How clearly this verse foretells, that when the trumpet will
be blown, everything will remain as it is. Neither earth nor the
sky or any other of the creatures will be least effected by it. Only
the people who will not accept the new Message will faint for a
moment because they will not be expecting a new Revelation.
However some pious people, who will believe in the new
Manifestation, will not even swoon.

Accordingly the first trumpet was sounded by the Báb in the
evening of 22 May, 1844 in Shíráz. And the second trumpet was
blown on the 21st April, 1863 at Dáru’s-Salám) (Baghdád) by
Bahá’u’lláh. By the first trumpet the past beliefs and traditions
were changed. And through the second trumpet new beliefs, values,
teachings and laws were promulgated and the foundation of a

new divine world order was laid down through the revelation of
a unique administrative system. Men and women, in all the corners
of the globe, have arisen to establish that divine civilization on
the earth.

“… the whole of the earth will be but His handful, and the
heavens will be rolled up in His right hand; …”

(Qur’án 39:67)
In this verse it is told that in the time of the advent of
Bahá’u’lláh the earth will be rolled up and the sky will be folded.
Scientific inventions and modern technology have accomplished
this. Thus God has fulfilled another of His promises:

“… Praise be to Alláh, who hath fulfilled His promise
> unto us and hath made us inherit the land, sojourning in the
> garden where we will! …”                            (Qur’án, 39:74)
27\. The earth will be filled with the light
of God (Bahá’u’lláh)

“And the earth will shine with the glory of its Lord, and
> the book will be set up, and the prophets and the witnesses
> will be brought forward and a just decision pronounced
between them, and they will not be wronged.”
In this verse, the advent of Bahá’u’lláh (Glory of Lord), the
revelation of a new Book, presence of witnesses and
pronouncement of the judgement, have been foretold.

Therefore today the world is shining by the light of the
advent of Bahá’u’lláh. He has revealed more than hundred volumes
of Words of God including His Book if Laws, The Most Holy
Book—Kitáb-i-Aqdas. All the former Prophets bear witness to
the validity of the Mission of Bahá’u’lláh. He has judged between
all the nations and removed the causes of differences between
them. Today, all the nations are being gathered together under
one single tent of unity.

28. Two lives

“They will say: ‘Our Lord twice hast Thou made us
> without life, and twice hast Thou given us life. Now have we
recognised our sins, is there any way out (Of this).”
It signifies that the people were dead at the time of the
advent of Muḥammad. Islám had made them alive. When they
died again Bahá’u’lláh restored them to life, for the second time,
through His revelation. Thus they received two deaths and two
lives. This verse does not relate to physical death or life.
29\. Muḥammad is a deliverer of glad-tidings
(Mubashshir)

“We have truly sent thee as a witness, as a bringer of
> glad tidings, and as a warner in order that ye (O men) may
> believe in Alláh and His Apostle, that ye may assist and honour
Him, and celebrate His praises morning and evening.”
According to the above-quoted verse Prophet Muḥammad
was ‘A Witness’, ‘A bringer of glad-tidings’, and a ‘Warner’. He
was “a witness” for the deeds and character of His followers; “a
bringer of glad tidings” of the advent of Bahá’u’lláh, and a
“Warner” for those who will reject the Promised One of Islám.
The reason, for which He was appointed ‘a deliverer of glad-
tidings’, is explained in these verses that O Muslims you may
believe in Alláh and His Apostle (Bahá’u’lláh), assist Him, honour
Him and celebrate His praises morning and evening. In this verse
the term ‘Apostle’ is used for Bahá’u’lláh, for Muḥammad could
not have given glad tidings of His own advent, nor that of the
former Manifestations. Thus God has meant an “Apostle” other
than Muḥammad Himself.

Another proof of the fact that by the term “Apostle”,
Bahá’u’lláh is meant is this that this verse explains the meaning
of the verse regarding the covenant of the Prophets in which it is

said when an “Apostle”, confirming your Book, appears you
should believe in His Mission:

“Behold! Alláh took the covenant of the Prophets, saying;
> ‘I give you a book and wisdom; then comes to you an Apostle
> confirming what is with you; do ye believe Him and render
> Him help’. Alláh said; ‘do ye agree and take this My covenant
> as binding on you?’ They said ‘we agree.’ He said; ‘then bear
witness and I am with you among the witnesses.”
30\. Baghdád—The place of advent

“And listen for the day when the caller will call out from
> a place quite near—the day when they will hear the cry of
truth. That will be the day of coming forth.”
The Muslims have been asked to be alert and listen carefully
for the day when a Manifestation of God will raise His call from
a nearby place. On that day the people will listen to the voice of
the truth and that will be the day of rising up of the people from
the graves of ignorance and heedlessness.

The nearest, important, place to Mecca is Baghdád. Its other
names are ‘Dáru’s-Salám’ (Abode of peace) and ‘Ummu’l-‘Iráq’
(mother of Iraq). God has always chosen a central city for the
advent of His Messengers. Hence He says:

“Nor was the Lord to destroy a population until He had
sent to its centre an Apostle, rehearsing to them Our verses”.
Thus He sent Muḥammad to the mother of the cities’, Mecca:

“Thus We have Sent by inspiration to thee an Arabic
> Qur’án; that thou mayest warn the Mother of Cities and all
> around her?’                                        (Qur’án, 42:7)

Similarly God has chosen Baghdád, the ‘mother of Iraq’,
which is the central city of Arabia, Persia, Turkey and Egypt and
the metropolis of Islamic art, culture, and religion, for the advent
of Bahá’u’lláh.

In 1863 Bahá’u’lláh proclaimed His Mission in the city of
Baghdád. He claimed that He was the Promised One of all
religions. Thus 21st April, 1863 (the day of the declaration of
Bahá’u’lláh) is the day of exodus for all the nations. On that very
day Bahá’u’lláh came out of Baghdád for His journey to
Constantinople. On that very day the earth and heaven of the past
religions, beliefs and old systems were rent asunder. Since that
day new treasuries of knowledge and actions were opened and
new revolutions began to shake the earth, and resurrection of the
nations took place. The Holy Qur’án terms the life of the vegetable
kingdom as ‘spring’ and that of men as ‘Exodus’:

“And we give life therewith to land that is dead; thus will
> be the resurrection (exodus).”                       (Qur’án, 50:11)
> The Holy Qur’án uses the term ‘caller’ (Munádí) to denote
a Messenger of God:

“Our Lord! we have heard the call of one calling to faith,
believe ye in the Lord; and we have believed.”
In the following verse God says that He knows it well that
the Muslims will not understand this prophecy and they will not
accept that by this verse appearance of a new Messenger of God
is foretold. They will think that exodus is something else. God
asks His Prophet, Muḥammad, to warn the people, through the
Holy Qur’án, about the promise of God, that when Bahá’u’lláh
appears they may be able to accept Him and receive salvation
(Naját):

“Let not the strutting about of the unbelievers through
the land deceive thee;”                               (Qur’án, 3:196)

31. New religion will be revealed

“Verily that which ye are promised is true; and verily
> judgement (Al-Dín) must indeed come to pass (i.e. religion
will be revealed).”      (Qur’án, 51:5–6)

Whenever there is a suffocation in the weather, life becomes
stagnant, environment becomes heavy with sorrow and depression,
there is no rain, lush green gardens and fields become dry, and
all signs of life disappear from amongst the people,—in such a
situation God causes the winds to blow, raises up the clouds
laden with water and sends down the rain of mercy to clean the
atmosphere and enchant the minds of the people. This phenomenon
has got a counterpart also in the spiritual realms.

Hence God has assured the Muslims, by taking oath of four
qualities of the wind, that the promise of a new Manifestation of
God and a new Book will be kept because it is a true promise.
New religion will certainly be revealed. Accordingly the Bahá’í
Faith has been revealed and Bahá’u’lláh, from His throne of
justice, has taken into account the deeds of all the nations of the
world.

In the following verse it is mentioned that people ask that
when will the day of Revelation of a new Book dawn?

“They ask; when will be the day of judgement and. justice
> (Yumu’d-dín)?”                                   (Qur’án, 51:12)
In reply God says:

“(It will be) a Day when they will be tried (and tested)
over the fire!”                                      (Qur’án, 51:13)

It signifies, that the people will be thrown into the fire of
wars; that the fire of hatred will reign amongst the nations; that
the fire of animosity will increase; that the fire of prejudices will
spread; that the followers of different religions and sects will start
considering each other as impure; that the fire of differences and

discord will be ignited in the name of nationalism, sex, colour and
religion. In such a time a new revelation of peace and love,
security and amity, will be revealed by God. The conditions, in
the last half of the nineteenth century were the same as it was
foretold. In such a condition God revealed a new religion through
Bahá’u’lláh. This new religion of God is uniting all the diverse
nations of the world and its followers are working for establishment
of a lasting peace on earth.
32\. Surging sea of ‘Akká

> “By the Mount [Ṭúr] (or Revelation); By a Decree Inscribed; in a Scroll
> unfolded; By the much-frequented fane; By the Canopy Raised
> High; and by the Ocean filled with swell;—Verily, the Doom
> of thy Lord will indeed come to pass;—there is none can
avert it;—”                                      (Qur’án, 52:1–8)

In these verses by the ‘Mount of Revelation’ reference has been made
to the ‘Mount Sinai’, the ‘decree’ refers to the Old Testament; the
‘much-frequented fane’ means the ‘Solomon’s Temple’; ‘the
Canopy Raised High’ denotes Ka‘bih in Mecca and the ‘ocean’
is the Mediterranean sea. ‘Akká is situated on the banks of this
sea. Thus God swears by a Holy Mountain, a Holy Book, a Holy
Temple, a Holy Point of Adoration and a Holy Sea.

By mentioning these God has shown that there is a link and
continuity in His guidance. At the end He makes a promise on
oath by the ocean which touches ‘Akká—the spot where
Bahá’u’lláh was exiled and where He lived, as a prisoner, from
1868 to 1892.

The most holy Book of this Dispensation was revealed in
this very city—‘Akká. Following these oaths, this promise is
being made that wrath of God is sure to descend and that no one
can stop it.

The history is a witness that whenever a Messenger of God
has appeared most of the people have rejected Him. Due to this
disobedience, God had punished them. God Himself testifies to

the fact that He never punishes a people without giving a warning
through a Messenger:

“… nor would We visit with Our wrath until We had
sent an Apostle (to give warning)”.            (Qur’án, 17:15)

Therefore since the coming of Bahá’u’lláh, all the nations of
the world are being punished by God due to their rejection of His
Mission. Some of the wraths of God are terrorism, pestilence,
famine, restlessness, cruelties, and wars etc. These wraths and
many more of them have turned the world into a hell. The only
way open for coming out of these agonies is to accept Bahá’u’lláh.
33\. He will call to accept new teachings

“Therefore (O Prophet) turn away from them, the day
that the caller (Dá‘iya) will call (them) to a terrible affair.”
According to this verse the Promised Day is the day on
which a universal Manifestation of God (Dá‘iya) will call the nations
of the world towards a new and difficult task. In the preceding
verse it is said:

“There have already come to them Recitals wherein there
> is (enough) to check (them). Mature wisdom;—but
(the preaching of) Warners profits them not.”
Here it is said that the people know the event of the former
Prophets but still they do not benefit from those warnings. Then
the Muslims have been advised that at the time of the next advent
they should not be among those people who reject the Manifestation
of God. By the term ‘Caller’ (Dá‘iya) a Manifestation of God is
meant:

“O Our people! hearken to the One Who invites you to
Alláh and believe in Him.”                      (Qur’án, 46:31)

“And as One Who invites to Alláh by His leave.”
Thus by the term “Dá‘iya” (the One Who invites), in these
verses, no one else but Bahá’u’lláh is intended. He has called the
nations towards a wonderful and difficult task. The difficult task
is the establishment of world peace. In the past different peoples
and nations have been fighting on such a scale that establishment
of peace, love and harmony between them is a wonderful but
difficult task.
34\. Rise of a new nation

“We have decreed death to be your common lot, and We
> are not to be frustrated from changing your forms and creating
you in that ye know not.”                       (Qur’án, 56:60–61)

God affirms here that He has destined a time of death for
each nation. And that He revives the dead nations through the
teachings of a new Manifestation. After revival, the dead nations
turn into a new nation. God also confirms that He is never tired
of creating a new nation, and says that the Muslims know nothing
about the new creation.

Accordingly God has raised the Bahá’í nation in place of the
Muslims. The Muslims were quite unaware about this advent and
its mission. This very promise is repeated in the chapter
Muḥammad of the Holy Qur’án that, when the Muslims will turn
away from the path, God will raise another nation in their place
who will be different from them:

“… if ye turn back (from the path), He will substitute in
your stead another people; then they would not be like you!”
35\. Advent of a great tiding

“… whereof do they question one another (it is) the great
tiding”.                                          (Qur’án, 78:1–2)

It says that the people will ask each other, on that day,
questions regarding the advent of the ‘great tiding’. But soon they
will realise that the time of Manifestation is the day of recognition
and distinction. It is further explained:

“The day that the trumpet shall be sounded, and ye shall
come forth in crowds; and the heavens shall be opened …”
It says that the day of judgement is the day when the trumpet
will be sounded and people will accept it in troops. Hence the day
of separation of the believers from the unbelievers began when
Bahá’u’lláh announced His Mission and raised the Call of God
and proclaimed that He, Himself, was the ‘Great Tiding’. The
people started to believe in Him and enter His Cause in troops.

More details regarding the day of separation is found in
these verses:

“Truly hell is a place of ambush, for the transgressors a
place of destination.”                           (Qur’án, 78:21–22)

“Verily for the righteous there will be a fulfilment of
desire. Gardens enclosed and grape-vines.”
The above verses describe that the destination of the
transgressors is hell while that of the believers is the fulfilment
of their desires and gardens.
36\. The trumpet will be sounded twice

“By those who drag forth to destruction, by those who
> gently draw out, by those who glide along, by those who
> hasten, by those who arrange the commands on that day when
first trumpet soundeth and second followeth it.”
In the first five verses an oath has been taken by such explicit

and hidden powers which break stagnancy. Then a promise is
given that a day will surely dawn when a trumpet will be blown
and then the second trumpet will follow it.

Exactly according to this promise of the Holy Qur’án the
Báb blew the first trumpet, in Shíráz, in 1844. Then followed the
second trumpet, blown by Bahá’u’lláh, in accordance with the
prophecies of all the past divine Books as well as those of the
Báb. The second trumpet was sounded in Baghdád in 1863.

The believers have been promised paradise and the ones who
reject are warned by hell.
37\. Twelve signs of the Advent

“When the sun is covered; when the stars fall; when the
> mountains vanish; when the she-camels are left untended; when
> the wild beasts are herded together; when the oceans boil
> over with swell; when souls are sorted out; when the female
> buried alive, is questioned for what crime she was killed;
> when the books are spread; and when the heaven has its
> covering removed; when the blazing fire is kindled to fierce
> heat; and when the garden is brought near; …”
> In the above-quoted verses twelve signs of the Promised
Advent are given. Bahá’u’lláh has fulfilled all these conditions.
Let’s see them one by one:
i.    When the sun is covered: 19th May 1780 was
a dark day. The records of that day say: It was not due to solar
eclipse. The sun had suddenly turned dark and the moon became
red like blood. This darkness remained till one o’clock. The
people thought it was a sign of resurrection. (for details see the
book ‘Thief in the Night’ by William Sears, George Ronald
Publishers, UK).
ii. When the stars fall: 12th November 1833 was
the day when countless stars fell from the sky. The sky seemed

full of illumined lines. This fall of the stars was witnessed for the
first time in the history.

Again in 1866, when Bahá’u’lláh was imprisoned in
Adrianople, the earth faced the Leo assemblage of the meteors.
In those days fall of the stars was witnessed in abundance.
iii. When the mountains vanish: This has got
several implications. One is that the mountain-like institutions of
kingship and monarchies were vanished and democracy took their
place. Another example of this is that-due to invention of things
like dynamite, stone-crushers and cement mills the mountains are
blown away like cotton. Dynamite was invented in 1866 and the
cement mill was invented in 1824. Moreover due to the invention
of the modern communication medias like wireless, air-planes, etc.,
the obstacles of high mountains have been rent asunder. All this
has happened in this age of Bahá’u’lláh.
iv. When the she-camels are left
untended: Due to the invention and progress in the field of
transport such as trains, motor-cars, aeroplanes and buses, etc., the
camels were, quite naturally, discarded as a means of
transportation. The modern means of travelling and logistics have
changed the world. Let’s remember that the railway engine was
invented in 1892, car was invented in 1876, motorcycle was
invented in 1885 and aeroplanes in 1903.
v. When the wild beasts are herded
together: It is a prophecy fulfilled when zoological gardens
were established throughout the world. It is interesting to note
that the Zoo of London was constructed in 1826; that of Denmark
was set up in 1859; the Zoo of Paris was built in 1899; and the
zoo of Berlin was completed in 1844; the zoo of Australia was
established in 1857 and that of Calcutta was built in 1875. Not
to mention the wild-life sanctuaries which are kept in different
lands.

Another implication of this is that the savage and fighting
nations of the world will come together in unity and all the

differences, amongst them, will be removed. The tribes and people,
who have accepted Bahá’u’lláh, have become spiritually united.
On the other hand those who have not yet accepted Bahá’u’lláh
are being forced by the circumstances to recognise the importance
of peace, unity and international brotherhood-whether they like it
or not.

The Holy Qur’án has, at several occasions, prophesied that
on the appointed Day the people will be gathered together. Those
verses of God have been proved and promises of God have been
fulfilled by the Advent of Bahá’u’lláh.
vi. When the oceans boil over with a
swell: This boiling up of the sea can certainly not be due to
the heat of the sun. It is a natural phenomenon that the sun shines
over the sea as it shines over all other things. It is happening
since time immemorial. However before the invention of the steam-
ship there had never been heat of fire on the surface of the sea.
The first steamer was invented in 1802 and since then the sea
began to boil up. The first steamer which crossed the Pacific
Ocean in 1826 was named ‘CORCO’ and it was made by Spain.
Since then thousands after thousands of the steam-ships have
been floated in the oceans. All of them burn fuel causing the
ocean to boil day and night.
vii. When the souls are sorted out: This
sorting out is done by a Manifestation of God. This has happened
in all the Advents. Today the same phenomenon is being repeated
by Bahá’u’lláh. Many people—the Jews, the Buddhists, the
Zoroastrians, the Christians, the Hindus, the Muslims, and even
those who did not believe in any religion—who so far hated each
other and were divided into countless sects which considered each
other as unclean, are now being united under the Faith of
Bahá’u’lláh. Unitedly and tirelessly, the followers of Bahá’u’lláh
are working for the unification of mankind and for the
establishment of peace on this earth.
viii. When the female buried alive is

questioned:

In the past a woman was deprived of many of her very basic
rights. She was practically confined, as if buried, within the
boundaries of the house. Thus half of the human population was
made deprived of the full benefits of social life and activities.

This verse prophesies that at the time of the Advent of
Bahá’u’lláh the women folk will be granted equality of rights and
status. They will participate in all sectors of life and progress.
This prophecy has also come true. The Bahá’í Faith has
emancipated the women and has proclaimed the equality of men
and women as one of its basic laws.
ix. When books (Ṣuḥuf) are spread: The Arabic
term ‘Ṣuḥuf denotes all sorts of books—newspapers, journals,
religious and other books etc. In the past the books were hand-
written on medias like leather, etc. The paper mill was invented in
1844\. The invention of paper and printing press revolutionised
the world of knowledge. Books, of all sorts and in all languages,
began to spread in all corners of the world on an unprecedented
scale.
x. When the heaven has its covering
removed: Heaven or sky means the outer space. This verse
says that on the ‘promised day’ the secrets of the outer space and
the stars will be fathomed and made known. Accordingly, after
the advent of Bahá’u’lláh, people have started discovering the
secrets of the outer space. Man has stepped on the moon and
traversed in the space and even in the outer space. Man knew
very little about the outer space before this.
xi. When the blazing fire is kindled to
fierce heat: The Manifestation of God teaches unity, love,
harmony and amity. But most of the people, treading the old
path, do not believe in Him. Rather they arise against Him. Due
to this rebellion God punishes them with fire. Those who believe
in Him are awarded paradise. They live in peace and harmony.
This is the day of judgement or separation. This is the day when
the believers are separated from the non-believers. Otherwise before
the advent of the Manifestation of God there seems no difference

between the true and a false one, and there remains no distinction
between a believer and an unbeliever.

Today it is witnessed that the nations, heedless of the teachings
of Bahá’u’lláh, are busy in manufacturing of fire-arms and war
materials. Thus the fire of war is ignited everywhere.
xii. When the garden (jannah) is brought
near: As explained above, they who recognise the new
Manifestation of God live in peace and paradise.
The followers of Bahá’u’lláh in more than one hundred and
sixteen thousand localities, spread all over the world, are working
tirelessly for the establishment of the oneness of mankind and
world peace. They believe that this very world will become a
paradise by the will of God. The stage of the establishment of
paradise on earth is drawing nigh day by day.
Similar prophecy is recorded in the following verses:

“When the sky is cleft asunder; when the stars are
> scattered; when the oceans are suffered to burst forth; And
when the Graves are turned upside down; …”
By the excavation of the graves it is meant that the ruins
will be excavated, research will be made of the happenings of the
past and due to expansion. in cities and towns, graveyards will be
excavated and removed.

All of these events have taken place in this Day of days.
38\. Earth will show forth its treasures

“When the sky is rent asunder, and hearkens to its Lord,
> and it must needs; and when the earth is flattened out, and
> casts forth what is within it and becomes empty and hearkens
> to its Lord, and it must needs; 0 thou man, verily thou art
> ever toiling on towards thy Lord, painfully toiling-but thou

> shalt meet Him.”                                    (Qur’án, 84:1–6)
> These verses give a glad tiding that the clouds of superstitions
and doubts will disappear and the Call of God will be made to
ring in their place as it will be its need. And then the earth of
religion and knowledge of God will be spread and it will, due to
the revelation from God, bring out its secrets and treasures and
will listen to the Orders of God as it will be in need of it. Then
the people have been assured of meeting with God.

Accordingly, after the advent of Bahá’u’lláh the earth and
the heaven have become illumined by the Word of God. Those
who have believed in Him have actually seen God. Recognition
and belief in the Manifestation of God is, in fact, meeting with
God.
39\. The crookedness of the nations will be
rectified

“By the fig and the olive and the Mount Sinai, and the
> city of security, We have indeed created man in the best of
moulds.”                                           (Qur’án, 95:1–4)

These verses establish a relation, in symbolic way, between
three of the Major Manifestations of God and show the continuity
of their advent and prophesy the advent of Bahá’u’lláh. The ‘fig’
and ‘olive’ refers to Christ; Mount of Sinai is the place of the
advent of Moses; and the ‘city of security’ is the Holy City of
Mecca that was the dawning point of the rise of the
Sun of Muḥammad. They are three of the great Apostles of Semitic
lineage, Who have raised three mighty nations. In the verse four
it has been promised that, in the time of Bahá’u’lláh, the
crookedness of the nations will be banished and after that they
will progress in a moderate and balanced way. Mankind will
become good after being moulded into the mould of a new divine
world order. Due to the Bahá’í teachings of peace, unity and
consultation, the crookedness of the nations are getting diminished.
And the Bahá’ís are, after being moulded into the best of the
moulds of the Bahá’í Laws and administration, trying to establish

world peace. They do not have any crookedness of enmity, hatred,
prejudices or differences among them. Intellectually, morally and
by thought as well as actions the Bahá’ís are a new race of
people.

We have translated the fourth verse in the above-quoted
verses in future tense, instead of the past, according to the
established principle that when translating a promise, a warning,
a tiding or a habit, past tense, is generally,- changed into the
future. Let’s see the following verses for example:

“By no means, for it is indeed a message of instruction,
therefore let whoso will keep it in remembrance.”
“Then do We abase him to be) the lowest of the low.”
41\. The nations will remain separated till
the Advent

“Those who disbelieve among the people of the Book and
> among the polytheists, are not going to depart (from their
> ways) until there should come to them clear evidence—an
> Apostle from Alláh, reading purified tablets wherein are laws
right and straight.”                               (Qur’án, 98:1–3)

“Nor did the people of the Book make schisms, until after
there came to them Clear Evidence.”                (Qur’án, 98:4)

In these verses God foretells that the people, either from
among those who have received any Revelation in the past or
those who are polytheists (Hindus, Buddhists, etc.), who have
rejected the advent of Prophet Muḥammad have become such that
they will remain separated from each other till the ‘Clear Evidence’
(Al-Bayyinah) comes to them and explains to all the truth and
realities in a new way. God has also explained that the meaning
of ‘Clear Evidence’ is a new Manifestation of God who will
appear with Holy Tablets and firm Commandments.

Accordingly Bahá’u’lláh has appeared with new Tablets and
Commandments. For example one of His Commandments is the
abrogation of the old Law regarding uncleanliness of certain objects
and people. He has declared, in His Tablets, that one should
consort with all the peoples in utmost love and friendliness.
After the promulgation of this Law, people from different
backgrounds and all the nations of the world which were separated
from each other since hundreds of the centuries and have been
considering each other as unclean and untouchables, are coming
closer and are being united under the banner of the Laws and
Principles revealed by Bahá’u’lláh who is the promised ‘Al-
Bayyinah’ (Clear Evidence). In the above-quoted verse (98:4) it
is mentioned that even when the ‘Clear Evidence’ came, as
Muḥammad, the people of the Book had made differences.

It is a fact that Prophet Muḥammad had come in a tribal
age. God had wished to keep the nations separated till this time.
Now, this age is the age of the unification of mankind. God has
willed for this age that all the peoples, be they the people of the
Books or polytheists, should gather together under one faith and
religion. Hence He in His divine wisdom had announced in the
Holy Qur’án that when Bahá’u’lláh will appear, with new Tablets
and Teachings, all the people will become one. Today the Bahá’í
Teachings have united the whole earth. Praise be to God Who has
kept His promise:

“They will say ‘Praise be to Alláh, Who has truly fulfilled
His promise to us.’”                               (Qur’án, 39:74)
42\. Three signs of the Advent

“When the earth is shaken to her (utmost) and the earth
> throws up her burdens and man cries: ‘what is the matter
> with her?’ On that Day will she declare her tidings; for that
> thy Lord will have given her inspiration. (Qur’án, 99:1–5)
> It is another of the glad tidings of the advent of Bahá’u’lláh.

No one can deny Him after witnessing such clear signs fulfilled.

Similar prophecies are also found in the Holy Bible that when
these signs will be seen, the people will witness the advent of the
Son of Man.

The first of the above-quoted verses prophesies that the earth
will throb. Since the advent of Bahá’u’lláh new powers of life
and activities of the nations and new movements have virtually
shaken up the world. The other physical evidence of the fulfilment
of this prophecy is the abnormal rate of earthquakes which have
visited the earth when the time of the advent drew nigh. The
records show that although earthquakes have visited the earth,
on small scales, throughout the annals of the history but those
which shook the world in this age are unprecedented. They, in
fact, have caused the world to throb. The magnitude of these
earthquakes may be guessed from the following statistics:
•    From 1800 to 1965; 35 earth-quakes took place in regions

of the ancient Roman Empire;
•    From 1700 to 1850; 224 earth-quakes have throbbed the

> earth of Scandinavia and Iceland, 178 earth-quakes visited
> the land of Spain and Portugal, and 600 times earth-quakes
> shook the regions of France, Belgium and Holland;
•    From 1800 to 1850; 800 times the earth-quakes visited the

land of Italy and the Eastern Mediterranean sea;
•    From 1902 to 1981; hundreds of millions of people have

died during earth-quakes in the various parts of the globe.
For example:
—    In May 1902; 40,000 people died in the West-Indies
—    In December 1908; 85,000 people died in the Seychelles
—    In December 1920; 100,000 died in China;
—    In September 1923; 95,000 died in Japan;
—    In May 1935; 50,000 died in Quetta, Pakistan;
—    In January 1939; 30,000 died in Chile;
—    In December 1939; 100,000 died in Turkey;
—    In September 1962; 12,000 people died in Írán;
—    In September 1968; 18–20,000 people died in Írán;

—    In May 1970; 70,000 people died in Peru;
—    In February 1976; 23,000 people died in Guatemala;
—    In June 1976.; 8,000 people died in Indonesia;
—    In August 1976; 8,000 people died in the Philippines;
—    In September 1978; 25,000 people died in Iran;
—    In November 1980; 45,000 people died in Italy;
—    In July 1981; 8,000 people died in the earth-quake in

Írán;
Not to mention the most recent ones which have cost
thousands of lives.

The second prophecy recorded in the above-quoted verses is
that the earth will issue forth its hidden treasures. This prophecy
has also come true as most of the world’s mineral resources have
been discovered during 1800 to 1892. During the same period
such machines were also invented which made digging of the
minerals much more easier than it was in the past. Thus the earth
started issuing forth such of its wealth which were hitherto
unknown to any one. The following statistics will make this fact
very clearly understood:
•    Petroleum: The first commercial oil-well was drilled

in USA in 1859 (Encyclopædia Britannica, Vol. 17; p. 656.)
•    Gas: Gas lighting was introduced in Bristol in 1823; Gas

> companies are recorded as innumerable in 1860 (Encyclopædia
> Britannica, Vol. 10; p. 6.)
•    Mineralogy: Scientific studies of minerals had scarcely

> begun before the 19th century. (Encyclopædia Britannica, Vol.

15, p. 502.)
•    Reliable quantitative chemical analysis of mineral was begun

in about 1800. (Encyclopædia Britannica, Vol. 15, p. 502.)
•    Henry Bessemer’s process announced in 1856 for making

> of steel from pig-iron in a pneumatic converter, began the steel-
> epoch. (Encyclopædia Britannica, Vol. 12, p. 604.)

•    Gold: During the second era of intensive gold production,

> the twenty-five years following 1850, more gold was produced in
> the world than in the 350 years immediately previous. A third
> mark of increase in the world gold recovery was noted during the
> period from 1890–1915. (Encyclopædia Britannica, Vol. 10, p.

535.)
•    Coal: The US geological survey records that coal was

> first discovered near Frost Burg, Md., in 1804. (Encyclopædia
> Britannica, Vol. 5, p. 963.)
•    In 1852 or 53 the first commercial shipment of coal were

made. (Encyclopædia Britannica, Vol. 5, p. 963.)
The third prophecy in these verses is that the earth will give
news. This promise of God was fulfilled in the following manner:
•    Cable Telegraph was invented in 1853;
•    Telephone was invented in 1876;
•    Television was invented in 1926;
•    Photo-phone was invented in 1985;

All other inventions in the field of communication media
are but the signs of fulfilment of this promise of God. These
inventions have made it possible that any information can be
circulated throughout the world in, almost, no time.

However, the question arises that what is the cause of this
sudden developments? The Holy Qur’án tells us that this is due
to the opening of the doors of divine Inspiration i.e. New
Revelation.

Albeit, God has increased, through Bahá’u’lláh, all sorts of
knowledge, wisdom, understanding as well as He has released the
potentials of all created things to such an extent that knowledge
of God has now flooded the whole earth.
43\. Time of the Advent is afternoon (‘AṢR)

“By the declining day, verily man is in loss.”
The Arabic word ‘Aṣr has got two meanings—one is ‘the
declining day’ and the other is ‘age’ of an ‘era’. Both of these
meanings signify the advent of Bahá’u’lláh. The first meaning of
the ‘declining day’ is the period of afternoon till the sunset. God
has taken oath of this time. On the 21st April 1863, at the time
of declining day, Bahá’u’lláh has announced, in the Garden of
Riḍván, Baghdád, that He is the Promised One of all Ages. While
He was making this declaration a call for ‘Aṣr Prayer was raised
from a nearby mosque—God is Great, God is Great!

God takes oath of that historic ‘Aṣr (declining day), when a
wonderful happening was going to happen in the annals of the
religious history and the promise given by all the Prophets of God
was going to be fulfilled on that blessed ‘declining day’, and
makes it a witness that if man does not believe in the Manifestation
of God and fails to correct his conduct according to His Teachings
then he (man) is in loss.

As to the other meaning of ‘Aṣr—time is the greatest of the
factors and the basic cause for the progress and decline, rise and
fall, and life and death, of individuals as well as those of a nation.
God’s revealed Laws and Ordinances are always according to the
needs of the time. They always match the spirit of the era. If man
fails to derive full benefits from the time, he is, surely, the loser.
Those, who believe in the Manifestation of God for their
age, practice His teachings, call others towards the Truth, show
constancy and steadfastness in the time of opposition and withstand
tests with courage and forbearance, are the ones who conquer the
time. And those who fail to do so, become a lesson of warning
for the posterity.

Thus today those who have believed in Bahá’u’lláh have
come together. They act upon His revealed Teachings and are
steadfast in His Cause. They are patient in trials and are calling
all the nations of the world towards the Teachings of the Lord of
the Age—Bahá’u’lláh.

The Báb
Siyyid ‘Alí Muḥammad, the Báb, was the forerunner of
Bahá’u’lláh and a Manifestation of God in His own right. His
advent has also been prophesied in the Holy Qur’án. We will
discuss some of those prophecies in this chapter.
1\. The Báb is the Witness

“Can they be (like) those who accept a clear (sign) from
> their Lord and whom a witness from Himself doth teach, as
did the Book of Moses before it—a guide and a mercy?”
The meaning of the term ‘Clear Sign’ (Bayyinah) is the
verses of God, His Signs, His warnings and His Apostles. In the
verse quoted above, this term is used to describe Prophet
Muḥammad. By the term ‘a witness from himself’ (sháhidun
minhu), Siyyid ‘Alí Muḥammad, the Báb, is intended. Because
the Báb had appeared after Muḥammad and had testified that
Muḥammad was a Prophet of God. He (The Báb) was a descendant
of Muḥammad. It is further stated in the same verse that those
who will disbelieve in the promised “Witness” will find their
abode in fire. In this way God, assures the Muslims that they
should have no doubt in the advent of the ‘Witness’ as this is
preordained by God—but most of the people do not believe in
this.
2\. Appearance of “a creature from the
earth (Dábbatu’l-Arḍ)”
“And when the word shall pass against them, We shall
bring forth for them a creature from the earth (Dábbah) that
shall speak to them, for that mankind has not believed in our
revelation.”     (Qur’án, 27:82)

The Holy Qur’án has announced an appointed Day on which
the happening (Váqi‘ah)—of the advent of a Manifestation of

God, was to happen. That very day has been referred to in the
above-quoted verse as the Day of the appearance of ‘Dábbah’.
The same day has been mentioned in the following verse as the
Day when ‘the trumpet will be sounded’:

“And the Day that the trumpet will be sounded—then
> will be smitten with terror those who are on earth, except
such as Alláh will please (to exempt).”              (Qur’án, 27:87)

Ten signs of the dawning of the promised “Day” and the
approaching of the appointed “Hour” have been given in the Holy
Traditions. Different people have interpreted them in different
ways. We can explain them, according to the Bahá’í point of
view: that the sun of knowledge and civilisation will rise from the
west; the sky of religion and spirituality will be clouded by the
smoke of doubts and superstitions; the Russian nations—called
‘Gog and Magog’ will attack the countries in the low-land; the
promised Christ will appear; religious scholars, governments and
general public will arise to attack Him; the people of the west, of
the east and of the Arabian countries will sink into materialism
due to fortunes and wealth, lust and greed; and then ‘a creature
from the earth’ will appear.

Let’s see what is “a creature from the earth?” This term has
been used at several places in the Holy Qur’án. For example:

“(Behold) in the beasts of all kinds (Kull-i-Dábbah) that
He scatters through the earth; …”                   (Qur’án, 2:164)

Here the term ‘kull-i-dábbah’ denotes beasts of all kinds i.e.
all creatures.

“There is not an animal (that lives) on earth (Dábbatin-
> fil-arḍ, Nor a being that flies on its wings, but (forms part of)
> communities like you.”                                  (Qur’án, 6:38)
In the above-quoted verse ‘Dábbah’ represents animals.

“There is no moving creature (Dábbatin-fil-arḍ) on earth

but its sustenance dependeth on Alláh.”                   (Qur’án, 11:6)
In this instance the term ‘Dábbah’ signifies all living
creatures.

“There is not a moving creature (Dábbah) but He hath
> grasp of its forelock.”                          (Qur’án, 11:56)
> It is clear that in this verse the term ‘Dábbah’ is used for
a man. Because it is only man who is accountable for his deeds
and receives reward or punishment. Hence it is said here that God
has grasp of his forelock i.e. no man can escape God’s punishment.

Man is the noblest of all creatures. And the most perfect of
the men are the Manifestations of God. Therefore we understand
that the term ‘Dábbah’ represents a Messenger of God. Imám
‘Alí has said “I am the Dábbatu’l-arḍ”. It means that the name
of the promised ‘creature’ (Dábbah) will be ‘Alí. So was the name
of the Báb—‘Alí Muḥammad. The following verse of the Qur’án
is very interesting:

“Then, when We decreed (Solomon’s) death, nothing
> showed them His death except the Dábbatu’l-arḍ which was
gnawing away at his staff.”                     (Qur’án, 34:14)

In this verse it is mentioned that after the death of Solomon
his kingdom met with downfall and his nation was caught in
divine chastisement, but the common man was unaware of this
happening. At that stage the Prophet warned them of the coming
catastrophe. However, the people paid no heed. At last the complete
destruction fell upon them and they lost their kingdom and faced
humiliation. The savage nation (Jinns) became sorrowful at this
chastisement and said that only if they knew what was going to
happen they would have escaped it.

Now coming back to the verse 27:82—God says that when
the ‘word is fulfilled’ and the ‘promised day is come and the day
allocated for the Muslims is completed—a Perfect Man will be
made to appear amongst the nations, Who will address them

according to the revelation from God. This-will-happen in a time
when the people will have lost their belief in God, religion,
revelation and life after death. The nineteenth century was a century
of similar disbelief and doubtfulness. Therefore the Báb announced
His Mission. He foretold that the coming of the Promised Christ
was well nigh.
3\. Aḥsanu’l-Qaṣaṣ—The second Qur’án

“Alláh has revealed the most beautiful Message (Aḥsana’l-
> Ḥadíth) in the form of a Book, consistent with itself, repeating;
> The skins of those who fear their Lord tremble thereat, then
their skins and their hearts do soften to Alláh’s reminder.”

(Qur’án, 39–23)
In this verse a prophecy, regarding the advent of the Báb
and revelation of His Book ‘Aḥsana’l-Qaṣaṣ’ (Qayyumu’l-Asmá),
is found. Qur’án uses the term (Aḥsana’l-Ḥadíth) for the Book.
‘Ḥadíth’ and ‘Qaṣaṣ’ both have the same meaning. The Báb has
revealed a Book called ‘Aḥsana’l-Qaṣaṣ’. This Book resembles
the Qur’án in style as well as in matter. The Báb has confirmed
that this Book (Aḥsana’l-Qaṣaṣ) was the same Qur’án revealed a
second time. This verse further declares that those who fear God
and read His Book will turn towards the reminder (Al-Dhikr) of
God and they will consequently accept His Faith. “Al-Dhikr” is
one of the Titles of the Báb).
The Báb, Himself, testifies to this in these words:

“O people of the earth, verily, the ‘Dhikr’ is come to you
from God.”                                         (Aḥsanu’l-Qaṣaṣ)
4\. The Advent of ‘al-Insán’ and revelation
of ‘al-Bayán’

“(Alláh) Most Gracious!

> It is He Who has taught the Qur’án.
> He has created the Man (Al-Insán).

He has taught him speech (Al-Bayán).                  (Qur’án, 55:1–4)

In these four verses mention has been made of two advents
and two Books of God. It says that God—the Gracious and
Merciful, has always trained mankind through His Messengers
and will continue to do so. Out of His abounding grace He sent
Prophet Muḥammad and revealed the Qur’án to Him. It further
declares that, in fullness of time, He will create “that Man” (Al-
Insán) i.e. a perfect man and reveal to Him a new divine Book
“Al-Bayán”. That Man ‘Al-Insán’ is Siyyid ‘Alí Muḥammad, the
Báb, Who proclaimed His Mission in 1844. When He was
imprisoned in the fort of Máh-Kú the Book ‘Al-Bayán’ was
revealed to Him by God.
5\. The door of benevolence

“So a wall will be put up betwixt them, with a gate (Báb)
> therein, within it will be mercy throughout and without it all
alongside will be punishment.”                      (Qur’án, 57:13)

In this verse the Muslims have been asked to watch for the day
when a wall will be erected between the believers and the unbelievers
i.e. they will be separated from each other. This wall will have one
door (Báb) and inside it will be the mercy of God while outside it
will be His wrath. The Báb is the divine Title of Siyyid ‘Alí
Muḥammad Who was the door for the recognition of God and gate
for the city of divine knowledge and wisdom. One who does not
recognize the Báb cannot believe in Bahá’u’lláh either. Those who
believe in the Báb are the rightful recipients of the mercy of God
and those who have failed to do so and remained out of the door
of true knowledge are surrounded by the wrath of God.
6\. Al-Dhikr (Reminder) is a title of the Báb

“Has not the time arrived for the believers to submit to
> Alláh’s reminder Dhikr’i’lláh) and to the truth which is
> revealed.”                                          (Qur’án, 57:16)
> As already mentioned somewhere else in this chapter that
one of the Titles of the Báb was ‘Al-Dhikr’ and His seal bore this
very Title. In the Quranic terminology the term ‘Dhikr’ (reminder)

has been used to denote a Book, remembrance of God and a
Manifestation of God. The Qur’án foretells that on the day of the
advent of the Truth the unbelievers and those who reject the
Truth will not be spared and excused. But those who will have
Faith in Islám will incline their hearts towards Siyyid ‘Alí
Muḥammad—Al-Dhikr, and they will believe in the Books revealed
by Al-Dhikr.
7\. The eight pillars of the most holy spot

“And eight will that day bear the throne of thy Lord
above them.”                                        (Qur’án, 69:17)

This chapter (69) of the Qur’án begins with the mention of
the advent of a new Manifestation of God. Then the story of the
nations who have met their doom, due to their rejection of the
Prophets, is related. The Muslims have been warned that they
should take lesson from such stories and should not follow into
the footsteps of the past nations—by rejecting their Promised
One. Then it is prophesied:

“Then, when one blast is sounded on the trumpet. And
> the earth is moved, and its mountains, and they are crushed
> to powder at one stroke—on that Day shall the (great) event
come to pass …”                                 (Qur’án, 69:13–15)

Therefore, Bahá’u’lláh sounded the trumpet (announced His
Mission) in 1863 which was a great event. The earth was shaken
(due to the invention of the machines for crushing, stones and
making cement). The sky of generosity opened its doors and
poured forth, from the clouds of inspiration and revelation, such
rain that revivified and revived the dead soil of human mind and
heart. The verse (17) which is quoted above says that on such a
Day the throne of ‘Al-Rabb’—the trainer (God) will be borne by
eight. One of the Titles of the Báb is ‘Rabb-i-A‘lá (great trainer).
His Shrine, called ‘Maqám-i-A‘lá (the Most Exalted Spot) is
situated on the slopes of Mount Carmel. The crown of this Shrine
is supported by eight pillars.

Another meaning of the ‘throne of God’ is the Person of the
Manifestation of God. Thus the personalities of the Báb and
Bahá’u’lláh are supported by the pillars of eight religions—
Hinduism, Judaism, Zoroastrianism, Buddhism, Christianity, Islám,
Bábí and the Bahá’í Faith.

People from all these eight religious backgrounds have
accepted the Báb and thus the throne of God is being supported
by eight pillars. Another example is that the edifice of the Bahá’í
Faith rests upon the pillars of eight religions.
8\. The nineteen guards who will save
people from the hell

“Soon will I cast him into hell-fire! And what will explain
> to thee what hell-fire is? Naught doth it permit to endure, and
> naught doth it leave alone!—Darkening and changing the
colour of man! Over it are Nineteen.” (Qur’án, 74:26–30)

It is said in this verse that God will cast the rebellious—
those who reject the Manifestation of God, who show pride towards
Him and do not pay attention to His Words, into the hell-fire. It
further declares that God has arranged to save the people from
hell-fire by appointing nineteen upon it who will protect the nations
from the wrath of hell, i.e. destruction, warfare and hatred.
When the Báb declared His Mission eighteen enlightened
souls accepted Him at first. The Báb called them the ‘Letters of
the Living’. The eighteen letters of the living including the Báb
Himself, Who was the Nineteenth Letter, constitute the nineteen
who were, according to the Qur’án, to save the nations from
destruction. Hence it is said in the very next verse:

“And We have set none but angels as guardians of the
> fire; and We have fixed their number only as a trial for
> unbelievers,—in order that the people of the Book may arrive
> at certainty, and the believers may increase in Faith—and
> that no doubts may be left for the people of the Book and the
> believers, and that those in whose hearts is a disease and the

unbelievers may say, ‘what symbol doth Alláh intend by this?’
> Thus doth Alláh leave to stray whom He pleaseth, and guide
> whom He pleaseth: and none can know the forces of the
> Lord ….”                                          (Qur’án, 74:31)
This verse clearly says that God has fixed this number as a
test. Those who will believe in the Book will progress in Faith
and certitude and the unbelievers will be puzzled with the example
of nineteen and will receive punishment. Thus God will reward
and punish the people.
9\. The Báb is the moon

“Nay, verily: by the Moon, and by the Night as it
> retreateth, and by the Dawn as it shineth forth,—this is but
> one of the mighty (events), a warning to mankind,—to any of
you that chooses to press forward, or to follow behind.”
In the above-quoted verses God swears by three things,
namely:
i.      by the Moon: It means the Báb as metaphorically He was

the One (Moon) Who derived His light from the Sun of Bahá!
ii.     by the night as it retreateth: This is the night when the

> Báb declared His Mission to Mullá Ḥusayn of Bushrúyih, i.e. the
> night between 22nd and 23rd May 1844. This night has another
> significance—‘Abdu’l-Bahá son of Bahá’u’lláh, was born in
> that very night.
iii.    by the Dawn as it shineth forth: This is the ‘Dawn’ of

> 23rd May, 1844 when Mullá Ḥusayn, having believed in the Báb,
> returned to his companions.
The Qur’án refers to that momentous and great night as a
‘warning’ (Nadhír) for mankind. ‘Nadhír’ is a term used for
Manifestations of God. This shows the greatness of that night
which is called ‘Nadhír’. The Muslims have been told that if

they wanted to advance they should press forward by accepting
the Báb or stay back by rejecting Him.
10\. Progressive revelation

“So I do call to witness the ruddy glow of Sunset; The
> Night and its Homing (Vasaq); And the Moon in her fullness;
ye shall surely travel from stage to stage.”
Here God swears by four things and promises that the
evolution of mankind will continue for ever. Through the advent
of the Manifestations of God man will progress stage to stage
both materially and spiritually. Those four things or events are as
follows:
i.      The ruddy glow of Sunset: It is the time when Mullá

> Ḥusayn first met the Báb in Shíráz. It was about the time of
> sunset.
ii.     The Night: It is the night of 23rd May 1844 when the

Báb declared His Mission to Mullá Ḥusayn;
iii.    The Vasaq: “Vasaq” is an Arabic name of the dove

> which is trained to return home in the evening. In this case this
> term has been used for Mullá Ḥusayn who was a wayfarer of the
> path of search and who at last reached the Presence of his Best
> Beloved—the Báb.
Another meaning of ‘Vasaq’ is pregnancy and fruit. If we
consider this meaning then God swears by the Night of pregnancy
and fruit i.e. revelation of God and announcement of a religion.
That very night has, really, given birth to a new era and a child
—new laws of God.
iv.     The moon in her fullness: By Moon the Holy Person of

> the Báb is meant. He was at the zenith of His Youth at the time
> of His declaration—25 years old. These Holy verses depict that
> when the evening of the Muslims will reach, the Moon (the Báb)

will appear to guide and enlighten the world. As mentioned earlier
this Moon receives its light from the Sun of Bahá!
As the days and the nights follow each other and the caravans
of life march forward, revelations from God also follow each
other to guide the successive generations of mankind. Nations
rise and fall one after another and thus mankind marches forward
towards its destiny.
11\. Advent of witness (sháhid) and the one
who is being witnessed (mashhud)

“By the Sky, the Zodiacal Signs; By the promised Day;
> By one that witnesses, and the subject of the witness;—Woe
> to the makers of the pit.”                         (Qur’án, 85:1–4)
God promises by four things that those who will remain in
the pit of heedlessness will be punished. These four things are as
follows:
i.      The Sky, the Zodiacal Signs: As the sun changes its points

> of rising and setting—different seasons are caused. Similarly the
> Day Star of Truth also rises from different horizons but they shed
> the same light. The Sun of Moses rose from the horizon of Sinai,
> the Sun of Jesus shined forth from the horizon of Jerusalem, the
> Sun of Muḥammad rose in Fárán and today the Sun of Bahá’u’lláh
> has manifested itself in Írán.
ii.     The Promised Day: According to Qur’án and other Sacred

> Scriptures, the Promised Day is 23rd May 1844. Hence in /this
> verse oath has been taken of the Promised Day i.e. the day of the
> advent of a new Manifestation—the Báb.
iii.    The Witness: By the term ‘witness’ a Messenger of God is

> meant. Prophet Muḥammad has been addressed, in two places in
the Qur’án, as witness:

“O Prophet! Truly We have sent thee as a Witness, a
Bearer of Glad-Tidings, and a Warner—” (Qur’án, 33:45)

“We have truly sent thee as a witness, … “(Qur’án, 48:8)
> In the verse under review, the term ‘witness’ denotes the
> Báb, who gave the glad tiding of the coming of Bahá’u’lláh.
iv.     The subject of the witness: Bahá’u’lláh is the subject of

> the witness. He is the Promised One of all the Holy Books. All
> the past Scriptures bear witness to Him.
In the light of these explanations, the verses under review
(85:1–3) may be explained as in this way: in the last Day the Sun
of Truth will shine forth from a new horizon, on that appointed
Day God will send a witness (the Báb) and then He will send
Him who has been witnessed (Bahá’u’lláh). Those who will fathom
the meaning of Faith, good deeds and good thoughts and soar into
the heights of certitude will readily believe in Him. But those who
will be in the pit of petty-mindedness, blind-following, heedlessness,
ignorance and disunity, will be punished for their rejection of the
Manifestation of God. The believers will make a new nation:

“It is He Who creates from the very beginning, and He
can restore (life).”                              (Qur’án, 85:13)
12\. The prophecy of 1260 years

“By the Break of Day. By the ten Nights; and by the
Even and Odd and by the Night when it passeth away …”
i.      The Break of Day: it signifies the morning of the advent of

Islám.
ii.     The ten Nights: it means the ten centuries after the advent

of Islám;
iii.    The Even and Odd: it means three centuries (even is two

centuries and odd is one century).
iv.     The Night: it means the night of the declaration of the Báb

(23rd May 1844).

Thus by ‘ten nights and the even and odd’ is meant 1,260

years. 260 years is the period of the establishment of the Faith of
Islám and 1,000 years after that. Thus it has been mentioned in
another verse:

“He rules affairs (Amr) from the heavens to the earth: in
> the end will (affairs) go up to Him, on a Day, the space whereof
> will be a thousand years of your reckoning.”          (Qur’án, 32:5)
13\. The night which is better than a thousand
months

“We have indeed revealed this in the Night of Power
> (Laylati’l-Qadr): And what will explain to thee what the Night
> of Power is? The Night of Power is better than a thousand
> months (Alf-i-Shahr). Therein come down the angels
> (Malá’ikah) and the Spirit (Rúḥ) by Alláh’s permission, on
every errand, (Amr), Peace! … This until the rise of Morn!”
These verses are full of prophecies regarding the advent of
the Báb. However before going into explanations let’s review
some basic terms used in these verses:
i.     The Night of Power (Laylati’l-Qadr): The Arabic word

> ‘QADR’ means power, capacity, respect, value etc. This word
> has been used at seven different places in the Holy Qur’án;
ii.    A Thousand Months (Alf-i-Shahr): Let’s ponder that why

> God has used this term ‘a thousand months’. There must be some
> very special significance of ‘a thousand months’. God does not
> use a word nay even a letter without any reason or significance.
> I could not find any explanation of this in any book. Upon
> meditation on this point, I reached to a certain conclusion that
> explains the significance of this ‘one thousand months’. One
> thousand months make eighty three years and four months. It is
> the period during which Shaykh Aḥmad of Aḥsá and his successor
> Siyyid Káẓim of Rasht and his pupils were preparing the Muslims
> for the advent of the Promised One.

According to “A Basic Bahá’í Dictionary” Shaykh Aḥmad
was born in 1743 and died in 1828 at the age of 85. We deduct
the early 17 years of his age, from this 85 years, which was the
period of his childhood and that of receiving education. Thus the
Shaykh spent 68 years (1760–1828) in preparing the people for
the coming advent. After his death one of his pupils, Siyyid
Káẓim of Rasht, succeeded him.

For fifteen years Siyyid Káẓim continued, like his great
teacher, to educate the people regarding the coming advent and to
prepare them for the reception of the Promised One. During these
15 years he made a large number of his students ready for accepting
the coming Manifestation of God. Siyyid Káẓim died in 1843 (31
December). His distinguished pupil Mullá Ḥusayn, who was on
a mission to Iṣfahán, returned to Karbilá on the 22 January, 1844
and organised the pupils of the late Siyyid to scatter in all directions
in the search of the Best Beloved. Mullá Ḥusayn, himself, reached
Shíráz in the evening of 22nd May 1844. In the night between
22nd and 23rd May 1844 he became the first to believe in the
Promised One. The whole period of the ministries of Shaykh
Aḥmad, Siyyid Káẓim and Mullá Ḥusayn, before the advent,
sums up to 83 years and four months as follows:
•      The period during which Shaykh Aḥmad

prepared the people:                                                68 years.
•      The period during which Siyyid Káẓim

taught:                                                             15 years
•      The period during which the disciples of

> Siyyid Kázim travelled and searched their
> Best Beloved
> (22 January to 22 May 1844):                                        4 months
•      Total                                                83 years & 4 months

The Qur’án calls this period as Alf-i-Shahr (a thousand
months). The outcome and result of all the pains taken and efforts
rendered during those thousand months was the advent of Siyyid
‘Alí Muḥammad, The Báb, in the night of power (Laylati’l-Qadr).
iii.   Angels: Angels are unseen creatures which possess the

faculties of human thought and deeds and believe in the advent of
> the Truth—the believers.
> The descent of angels and spirit signifies the coming of a
> new Revelation and Word of God. Hence it is mentioned in the
Qur’án:

“And thus have We, by Our command, sent Inspiration
> (Rúḥ) to thee: thou knewest not what was Revelation and
> what was Faith …”                                (Qur’án, 42:52)
> Here, the term, ‘Rúḥ’ (inspiration or spirit) is used to mean
Revelation from God.

It has been mentioned in the Qur’án, regarding the advent of
Bahá’u’lláh, that on that day the angels and the spirit will stand
in rows and no one will speak a word but he who will have the
permission of God—and he will speak the truth:

“The Day that the Spirit and the angels will stand forth
> in ranks, none shall speak except any who is permitted by
Most Gracious, and he will say what is right.”
Therefore, the verses under review can be explained in this
way: God will send down His Laws in the Night of Power (Laylati’l-
Qadr). O Muslims you do not know what night of power, glory
and value is? That night of power is the result of one thousand
months. In that night will descend angels and spirit (Revelation
of God) by the order of God. This revelation from God will
continue till the dawn breaks.

It has been explained earlier, that the famous Muslim Scholar
and teacher Shaykh Aḥmad, His successor Siyyid Káẓim and his
pupil Mullá Ḥusayn taught and prepared the people, to receive
the coming Advent, for one thousand months (i.e. 83 years and
four months). Finally Mullá Ḥusayn attained the Presence of the
Bib and accepted His claim in the night of 23 May 1844—two
hours and eleven minutes after the sunset—that He was the

Promised “Mihdí” Whose advent was awaited since one thousand
years. It is the same night when the Báb received His first
Revelation and the Book ‘Aḥsana’l-Qasas’ was revealed. The
Báb continued His conversation with Mullá Ḥusayn and revealed
verses for him throughout that night. He allowed Mullá Ḥusayn
to return to his friends when the call for dawn prayer was being
raised atop a nearby mosque. One can himself judge that how
clearly the advent of the Báb has been prophesied in these verses
of Qur’án.
14\. The revelation of Qur’án in Persian

> “Had We sent this as a Qur’án (in a language) other than
> Arabic (‘Ajamí), they would have said: “Why are not Its
> verses explained in detail? What (a Book) in foreign tongue
(‘Ajamí) and Arabic?”                              (Qur’án, 41:44)

Let’s first review the translation. As in many other places
this translation is also faulty. The verse begins with these words
in Arabic: “Va lu Ja-‘alnáhu Qur’ánan ‘Ajamíyyan …” ‘Va’ means
‘and’; ‘lu’ means ‘when’; “Ja-‘alnáhu” means ‘we will make’;
“‘Ajamí” means belonging to “‘Ajam” (i.e. generally speaking
Persia). Hence the translation will be—‘And when we will make
this Qur’án (a) Persian (one) …’ The translation ‘Had We sent
this as a Qur’án (in a language) other than Arabic’ is not correct.
In this translation the Arabic Word “‘Ajamí” which means
‘Persian’ has been translated as ‘a language other than Arabic’.
Thus the sentence ‘What (a Book) in foreign tongue and Arabic’
should be read as ‘What (a Book) in Persian and Arabic (mixed)?’

How clearly God foretells that when He will make this Arabic
Qur’án a Persian one, the people will object and ask why a Book
in two languages? Therefore when God, according to His
prophecy, changed the Arabic Qur’án into Persian and named it
Al-Bayán, the same objection was made. The people raised the
objection “what kind of a Book is it, in which, Persian is also
mixed into the Arabic text?” Another objection was that why the
Báb and Bahá’u’lláh, who themselves were Persians, revealed
Arabic verses.

It is worth pondering that the verses of God, irrespective of
the place of revelation, language used or the time when they were
revealed, are one in their objective, truth and spirit. As there is
no difference between the Manifestations of God, therefore their
Revelation is also one. The Holy Qur’án itself testifies to this
fact:
“And it (the Qur’án) is in the Books of the former.”
“This (Qur’án) is that which is written in the former
> Books.”                                             (Qur’án, 87:18)
> All the Books, revealed before the commencement of the
Bahá’í Era, were revealed in only one language of a nation.
However, the Bahá’í Revelation has used the media of two
languages-Arabic and Persian. This was foretold in the verse 44 of
chapter 41 (above-quoted) of the Holy Qur’án. And the general
reaction of the people is also the same as foretold in this verse
—(a Book) in foreign tongue (Persian) and Arabic?” The
other objection is “why are not its verses explained in detail?”

As to the second objection that this new Book is not in detail
we will have to consider the style of the Books revealed by the
Báb and Bahá’u’lláh. It is worth noting that ‘Al-Bayán’ has been
revealed in both Arabic and Persian. Even in the Persian ‘Al-
Bayán there are many verses in Arabic. The people of Arabia
were not accustomed to read such bi-lingual Books and it was
hard for them to understand it.

Another reason for this objection stems from this deeply
rooted prejudice of the Arabs that no book, except that in the Arabic
language, can ever be in detail and complete. Due to this prejudice
the Arabs (and other Muslims) say that the Persian Qur’án (Al-
Bayán) is not in detail and fully explained. Otherwise the Al-
Bayán is the most elaborate and eloquent Book.

The third reason for this objection is that in the Book ‘Al-
Bayán’ and in the Tablets of Bahá’u’lláh Laws, Ordinances and

advices have been recorded in a direct way. Unlike the Qur’án
they have not been supported by past histories and episodes. For
the Arabs nothing is detailed or eloquent if it is not decorated by
stories of the past and appropriate examples. Hence they object
that the new Revelation is not detailed and explained.

Another reason for this rejection is that the style of the
Bahá’í Revelation is such that one has to pause for meditation
and think deeply to understand it. Most of the people do not like
this style. Therefore, they say that this Book is not explained and
detailed.

However, God had warned us in the Holy Qur’án that such
objections will not be entertained:

“Say: ‘It is a guide and a healing to those who believe;
> and for those who believe not, there is a deafness in their ears,
and it is blindness in their (eyes): …”              (Qur’án, 41:44)

A just reader will not fail to apprehend, from the numerous
verses quoted and explained in this chapter, that how clearly the
Qur’án foretells the coming of the Báb and the events and
phenomena that will accompany it. The Holy Qur’án tells the
name of the Promised One, time of His advent, the events preceding
it, and languages of new revelation as well as the objections of
the people. No wonder more than 20,000 people offered their
lives in such a short period of a decade, to testify to the validity
of the claims of the Báb and for preparing of the way for the
advent of Bahá’u’lláh.

‘Abdu’l-Bahá
“I swear by this city, and thou art as indweller of this
> city, and (by) the father and son … Verily we have created
man into toil and struggle.”                         (Qur’án, 90:1–4)

It has been said in the fourth verse that man is alive by his
movement and efforts. He has to work hard and struggle in order
to keep himself, both physically and spiritually, fit, active and
alive. The Manifestations of God bestow the people with new
zeal and ardour of life, and give them a purpose of life. From
Adam till Muḥammad was a Prophetic Cycle.

The holy city of Mecca had a central importance during that
Cycle because of the Ka‘bih which was a centre of all activities.
Muḥammad was the last One in the series of the Prophets in this
Cycle. Therefore oath has been taken by Mecca and by Prophet
Muḥammad.

By father, in this verse, is meant Bahá’u’lláh and ‘Abdu’l-
Bahá is referred to as ‘Son’.

Bahá’u’lláh has inaugurated a new cycle of God and opened
a new era of the history. He is the Promised One of all religions
and the One Who has been testified by all the Prophets of God.
‘Abdu’l-Bahá is the appointed Expounder and the Centre of
the Covenant of the Bahá’í Faith. Therefore the Qur’án brings
both of Them as Witnesses and promises the coming of a New
Manifestation. Thus it has been mentioned that movement, struggle
and progress is an in-built characteristic of man—his very nature.

Just as the man has traversed many stages of evolution during
the Prophetic Cycle, he will have to, similarly, go through many
stages of evolution and will have to struggle in all these material
as well as spiritual worlds till he reaches that final stage which
is the stage of the establishment of the kingdom of God on earth.

The centre and pivot of all these efforts and accomplishments
is the Covenant of God which has been established through
‘Abdu’l-Bahá. The following passage will show the station of
‘Abdu’l-Bahá to a just reader and he will readily accept that the
‘Son’ mentioned in the above-quoted verse, is this very Son of
Bahá’u’lláh:

‘Abdu’l-Bahá fulfills a function different from that of any
other figure in religious history. Bahá’u’lláh emphasised this fact
by calling him ‘The Mystery of God’, a designation that Shoghi
Effendi has said is particularly appropriate ‘to One Who, though
essentially human and holding a station radically and fundamentally
different from that occupied by Bahá’u’lláh and His Forerunner,
could still claim to be the perfect Exemplar of His Faith, to be
endowed with superhuman knowledge, and to be regarded as the
stainless mirror reflecting His light’.

‘Abdu’l-Bahá has been endowed with a contingent infallibility
that is beyond the understanding of man. All His Words, His
actions, His judgements and His interpretations are infallibly right,
but only because Bahá’u’lláh Has Willed it so. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá
revealed nothing new; He had not the direct intercourse with God
of a Divine manifestation; nevertheless, His every act reflected
the Light of God and His every word bore witness to His
superhuman knowledge.

Bahá’u’lláh praised Him in many Tablets. One ran: “We
have made Thee a shelter for all mankind, a shield unto all who
are in heaven and on earth, a stronghold for whosoever hath
believed in God, the Incomparable, the all-Knowing. God grant
that through Thee He may protect them, may enrich and sustain
them, that He may inspire Thee with that which shall be a
wellspring of wealth unto all created things, an ocean of bounty
unto all men, and the dayspring of mercy unto all peoples”.

In the Tablet of the branch, Bahá’u’lláh describes ‘Abdu’l-
Bahá’s station as follows: ‘Render thanks unto God, 0 people,
for His appearance; for verily He is the most great Favour unto
you, the most perfect bounty upon you; and through Him every

mouldering bone is quickened … Whoso turneth away from Him
hath turned away from My Beauty, hath repudiated My Proof,
and transgressed against Me. He is the Trust of God amongst
you, His charge within you, His manifestation unto you, and His
appearance among His favoured servants.”

(All Things Made New, pp. 224–225)

Shoghi Effendi
“And for him who fears the station of his lord, there will
> be two gardens—then which of the favours of your lord will
> ye deny, (these gardens) are of Afnáns.”         (Qur’án, 55:46–48)
> God has promised in these verses that He will give them,
who believe in the Báb and Bahá’u’lláh, two gardens. These
gardens will be of the Afnáns. Two springs will flow through
them and all the fruits will be of two types.

This prophecy is regarding the two Bahá’í gardens on Mount
Carmel. One of them is in the vicinity of the Shrine of the Báb
and the other is adjacent to the International Bahá’í Archives.
One of the titles of the Báb is the “Supreme Lord” and the
Bahá’ís call His Shrine by the name of ‘The Most Exalted Place’.
In the Qur’án the term ‘Place of Lord’ has been used which
means the Shrine of the Báb, His station and title.

In the Bahá’í terminology the male descendants of Bahá’u’lláh
are called the ‘Aghṣán’ and the relatives of the Báb are called as
‘Afnán’. The Guardian of the Bahá’í Faith, Shoghi Effendi, is an
‘Afnán’ because His father Mírzá Hádí Afnán was among the
kins of the Báb and His mother Ḍíyá’íyyih Khánum was the
daughter of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá.

Both the Bahá’í gardens on Mount Carmel were planned
and grown by the tireless labours of Shoghi Effendi. Therefore
the Qur’án names them as the ‘gardens of Afnáns’.

Mount Carmel is the Spiritual as well as the Administrative
World Centre of the Bahá’í Faith. This is why God says that two
springs flow from these gardens. The Holy Bible prophesies the
similar events that the divine laws and ordinances of God will
flow from here:

“It shall come to pass in the latter days that the mountain
of the house of the Lord shall be established in the highest of

the mountains, and shall be raised above the hills; and all the
nations shall flow to it.”                               (Isaiah, 2:2)

This prophecy is also regarding the establishment of the
Universal House of Justice. From this very Institution divine laws
are scattered throughout the world:

“Rejoice, for God hath in this Day established upon thee
> His throne, hath made thee the dawning-place of His signs
and the dayspring of the evidences of His revelation”

(From Tablet of Carmel, Bahá’u’lláh)
“Ere-long will God sail His Ark upon thee, and will
> manifest the people of Bahá who have been mentioned in the
book of names.”                                            (Ibid)

It has been told that another characteristic of these gardens
is this that all the fruits of these gardens are of two varieties.
Accordingly there are two shrines—the Shrines of the Báb and
that of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, in those gardens.

The resting places of one of the sons of Bahá’u’lláh, Ghuṣn-
i-Aṭhar, and His daughter, Bahíyyih Khánum, are also in these
gardens. Likewise Mount Carmel is the Spiritual as well as the
Administrative Centre of the Bahá’í Faith.

The seat of the Supreme Body of the Bahá’í Faith, the
Universal House of Justice, and the secretariat of the Hands of
the Cause of God and the International Teaching Centre is also
situated here. Thus these gardens are the Centres of both the
elected and appointed institutions of the Bahá’í Faith. Thus in
these gardens are present two varieties of each fruit.
“… The fruit of the gardens will be near.”
Accordingly, it is so. The spiritual and administrative centres
are close by. It is further stated in the same chapter of the Holy
Qur’án that there are two more gardens besides these two:

“And besides these two, there are two other gardens …
> Dark green in colour … in them will be two springs pouring
> forth water in continuous abundance … In them will be fruits
and dates and pomegranates.”                     Qur’án, 55:62–68)

By these two gardens are meant—the garden surrounding
the Mansion of Mazra‘ih which is lush green and beautiful, the
other is the Garden of Riḍván near Bahjí. In these, also two
springs of love of God and Faith do originate. These prophecies
of the Holy Qur’án, regarding the Ministry of Shoghi Effendi, the
establishment of the Universal House of Justice, and the Bahá’í
gardens in Haifa and ‘Akká, are very explicit.

Our Muslim friends may raise one objection regarding these
prophecies that ‘Afnán’ means branches. Therefore it means that
those gardens will be with branches. The answer is that which
tree or garden is without branches? Therefore this objection is not
valid.

Second objection may be this that by two gardens is meant
the gardens of paradise. Our answer is this that the word ‘paradise’
itself means ‘garden’. Therefore it can not mean any imaginary
garden. It is also worth thinking that if it be true that pious
people will get gardens after death then why only two—why not
more or less? Thus it becomes clear that the gardens of the Afnán
are the same ones raised by Shoghi Effendi the Guardian of the
Faith of Bahá’u’lláh.

In concluding we can hope that the aforementioned proofs
from the Holy Qur’án will establish beyond any doubt the validity
of the claim of Bahá’u’lláh that He is the Promised One of Islám
—the Naba’al-‘Aẓím. The points raised and clarified in this book
will surely open new vistas of spiritual conscience before a keen
reader and will create in him a fresh zeal to investigate the Holy
life and marvelous accomplishments of Bahá’u’lláh Who is “ …
the Supreme Manifestation, the Unifier and Redeemer of all
mankind, the Fountainhead of Justice, the immortal Beloved.”
Suffice it to quote:

“Whereby Alláh guideth him who seeketh His good
> pleasure unto paths of peace. He bringeth them out of darkness
unto light by His decree, and guideth them unto Straight Path.”
