      “At Dawn the Friend came to my bed”

An early fruit of the Supreme Pen1

Julio Savi

At dawn the Friend came to my bed (Sa˙ar ámad)2

He is the Provider in all circumstances

At dawn the Friend came to my bed:                                  [1]

“O fool for love, O broken heart,
O thou, who pinest for Me wherever thou art,

And wherever thou art, liest in prison for Me,
Now an asp twisted at thy foot,

Now a rutilant chain at thy neck.
O thou, who didn’t spend a night on a bed of ease, O thou,

> Who didn’t find a moment of relief from the woes of the
> world.
The heart of the world was burnt by the fire of thy wails,          [5]

> The eye of the universe was consumed by the fire of thine
> afflictions.
Now is placed in fetters thy neck, as if thou werest a rebellious

> Servant, now, bound in chains, thou art hurried to the
> bazaar.
Now thou art wronged in the hands of the oppressor,

Now thou spendest days and nights in the prison of cruelty.
274                                              Lights of Irfán vol. 16

Thy pains set on fire the hearts of the friends,

Thy groans darkened the faces of the lovers.
Thine eyes shed rubies of blood, whereby

The eye of the twilight hath turned pomegranate red.
After so many toils thou met in My path,                            [10]

Thou doest not cool down, nor bitterly regret.
Wherefore art thou restless tonight? Wherefore

Hath thy body become as thin as a thread?
In the night thou tossest and turnest on thy couch,

Thou tossest and groanest, as bitten by a snake.
Why doest thou turn and groan, now?

Why doeth thy face turn pale?”
I answered: “O Friend! O Healer of my soul!

How is it that Thou camest to this sick bed?
O Thou, by Whose Face the sun is enlightened in the sky,            [15]

O Thou, by Whose love the essence of peace is unsettled.
The sky hath filled its skirt with pearls,

That it may lay it down at the feet of Thy Majesty.
Doest Thou wonder about Thy lover’s plight?

Thou wilt discover its secrets in the pallor of his face.
My groans proclaim the secret of my heart;

My tearful eyes reveal the riddle of my soul.
In my love for Thee I received many an arrow

Of cruelty, I fell into infidel hands.
I was dragged through mountains and plains,                         [20]

I was drawn in front of the wicked.
Should I tell what I saw in my love for Thee,

At Dawn The Friend Came                                        275

My tongue would grow weary of speaking.
I don’t complain, O Friend, for Thy pitiless sword

And I cherish my pains for Thee as my own heart.
I embrace Thy decree with heart and soul,

My spirit yearns after Thy tribulations.
My soul won’t cut the lace of Thy love,

Should it be beheaded with a deadly blade.
I tied my heart to the curl of Thy tresses,                    [25]

That it may not be unloosed till the Judgement Day.
Should I be slaughtered a myriad times, with every

Moment, still I wouldn’t rebel against Thy love.
In the night season I burn in the fire of anguish,

‘Cause my head hasn’t been, O Friend, hung on the gallows.
I come with no veil before Thee to behold, O Almighty,

Thy Face beyond any mortal frame, O Unique One.
The Birds of Eternity returned to their nest,

We remained downtrodden and wretched on earth.
The time hath come for the banner to be hoisted.               [30]

O Mystery of God! Draw forth Thy hand from the Unseen,
That Thou mayest discharge the mortals from their clay,

And cleanse the mirrors of their hearts from their rust.
From the shackles of the world, O Thou,

Release all these pilgrims and companions
Attire their heads with the crown of acceptance,

Gird up their temples with the girdle of love.”
That’s enough, O Dervish! Don’t torment us any longer,

‘Cause many sparks have fallen from these words.
276                                           Lights of Irfán vol. 16

Bahá’u’lláh’s poem which begins with the verse Sa˙ar ámad
bi bistar-am Yár, “At dawn the Friend came to my bed,” is one
among eight Persian poems signed “Dervish,” and published by
the Iranian Bahá’í scholar ‘Abdu’l-Óamíd Ishráq Khávarí (1902–
1972) in his multi-volume anthology of the Writings of the
Central Figures of the Bahá’í Faith Má’idiy-i-Asmání (4:176-211).3

Literary aspects

As to the perspective of the form, this specific poem may be
defined a poem in the light of the following definition of
poetry, given by Franklin D. Lewis, an expert in Persian
Language and Literature, as to Nineteenth century Persia:
“rhymed speech (moqafâ) composed in lines (bayt / abyât)
following one of the established quantitative meters (bahr /
bohur) and arranged according to a particular form” (“Poetry as
Revelation” 102). Specifically, Sa˙ar ámad bi bistar-am Yár
conforms to the traditional Persian verse form of the qaßídih.

The qaßídih is a poem “always designed to be chanted or
sung” (Lane 7:60), born among the Arabs, of whose lyrics it was
“the primary instrument” (Bausani, “Letteratura neopersiana” 176),
and later introduced into Persia. Its name derives from the
Arabic root qaßada, that is, “he made him, or it, his object; he
aimed at him, or it: he sought, endeavored after, pursued, or
endeavored to reach or attain, or obtain, him, or it: he desired
it, or wished for it: he intended it; purposed it; or meant it”
(Lane 7:59). As Fritz Johann Heinrich Krenkow (1872–1953), a
German scholar in Arabic, Persian and Islamic Studies, and
Gérard Lecomte (1926–1997), a French scholar in Arabic and
Islamic studies, explain in the Encyclopaedia of Islam, the
primitive qaßídih “was intended to eulogize the tribe of the
poet and denigrate the opposing tribes. Later it was concerned
with the eulogy of a personality or a family from whom the
poet was soliciting help or subsidies.” Probably on the ground

At Dawn The Friend Came                                        277

of this etymology, Edward G. Browne (1862–1926), the
renowned British Orientalist, called the qaßídih “purpose-poem”
(Literary History 2:22). In Persia it came to be mainly used as “an
instrument of panegyric or philosophic and moralizing poetry”
(“Letteratura neopersiana” 176). The most important formal aspects
of Persian qaßídih, as listed in the Encyclopaedia of Islam (de
Fouchécour), the Encyclopaedia Britannica (“Qasida”), and
other sources, are as follows:

Length: “the number of its distiches exceeds 15 and does not
exceed 30” (de Fouchécour). However, according to other sources,
qaßídih may have from “60 to 100 lines” (“Qasida”). Henri
Wilberforce-Clarke (1840-1905), first translator of the Bústán
of Sa‘dí and of the Sikandar Námih by Nízamí, remarks: “This
kind of poem is read in the presence of him in whose honour it
is composed; and therefore should not be so long as to weary
him” (xv).

Rhyme: the ending of the first hemistich of the first distich
of the qaßídih “had to supply the one single rhyme for the whole
poem. The rhyme was repeated in each ∂arb, the final part of
the second hemistich of each distich, according to complex
rules” (de Fouchécour).

Metre: “virtually any metre is acceptable for the qasida
except the rajaz,4 which has lines only half the length of those
in other metres” (“Qasida”). Lewis reminds us that according to
“traditional metrics ... a poem should follow the same meter
throughout” (“Short Poem” 85).

Contents: “as a general rule, the poet must ensure that the
meaning of each bayt is independent of its neighbours”
(“Qasida”).

Three parts: all authors agree in saying that classical qaßídihs
are divided into three parts, however they differ from one
another in explaining the features of the three parts. We will
follow the model offered by the French Iranianist Charles-
Henri de Fouchécour. The first part, “the exordium, must

278                                              Lights of Irfán vol. 16

command attention by touching the hearts of the listeners, an
effect which is often achieved by a ghazal, a courtly song,5
either by describing the beauty of the beloved and the state of
the lover (nasíb), or through the amorous poet making his
listeners share in his condition (tashbíb)” (de Fouchécour). The
Italian Islamicist Alessandro Bausani (1921–1988) comments
that in the first part “the poet laments his separation from his
beloved one or describes her abandoned home or springtime.”
He also writes that at the end of this part the poet uses “some
skilful devices of one or two verses,” called gurízgáh, to pass
“into the second and most important part” (“Letteratura
neopersiana” 176). The second part (mad˙), an

> eulogy for a prince or protector, is the central portion
> of the ḳaßída; put into a sensitive frame of mind by the
> exordium ... the listener will be carried away by the
> poet’s skill; all that is required is a degree of rhythm in
> the eulogy, a strong effect of balágha (a wealth of
> meaning in a few words) but an uncontentious one, and
> the transport of the soul out of its ordinary element. (de
> Fouchécour)

The third part is “the petition: the poet must know how to
‘wrap up’ his request ... stirring the person being praised to
reward him by the charm of his poem and the renown it
engenders” (de Fouchécour).

Important verses: three distiches require particular care: the
first one, because “it opens the poem and signals all the areas of
expression”; the transitional verse between the first and the
second part, the eulogy, “which must skilfully introduce the
name of the person being eulogised”; and the final verse
(maqta‘), “which must be of a quality that redeems any
mediocrities in the work” (de Fouchécour).

The pen name of the poet (takhalluß) is included in the final
verse (maqta‘).

At Dawn The Friend Came                                        279

In this poem Bahá’u’lláh adopts a loose form of qaßidih,
introducing formal and thematic innovations and making
several exceptions to the classic model of this poetical form. As
to its length, this poem has 34 distiches (15-30 is the average
length of a classical qaßidih). As to its rhyme, it is classically
one-rhymed (in -ár). As to its metre, it seems that Bahá’u’lláh
does not use the same verse throughout His poem, although the
prosodic rules of qaßídih require the poet to follow the same
metre throughout. As to an independent meaning in each verse,
this rule has an exception in verses 30-1, which together convey
a single meaning.

The time hath come for the banner to be hoisted.
O Mystery of God! Draw forth Thy hand from the

Unseen,

That Thou mayest discharge the mortals from their clay,

And cleanse the mirrors of the hearts from their rust.

Besides, the whole poem is a kind of dialogue between the
Beloved and the Poet as a lover, and thus no verse is wholly
independent from the other ones. All verses are connected to
one another by the special form adopted by Bahá’u’lláh, as if
He intended to endow this poem with a unitary structure. He
describes a dialogue between the lover and the Beloved, Who at
dawn goes to the lover’s bedside. It is a loose form of the
rhetoric device, typical of the qaßídih and ghazal, called su’ál-u-
javáb (question and answer). There are several poems totally
written on this base. Bahá’u’lláh also uses su’ál-u javáb in two
other poems, Ishq az Sidriy-i-A‘lá ámad and But-i-má ámad bá
ba††í-u bádih. In this respect these three poems have illustrious
precursors, for example numbers 50 and 166 of the poems by
Jalalu’d-Dín Rúmí (1207–1273) translated by Arthur John
Arberry (1905–1969), the well-known British orientalist (Mystical
poems 1:44-45 and 138), and numbers 136 and 194 of the poems by
Shamsu’d-Dín Óafi.z (ca.1318–1390) translated by Wilberforce-
Clark (see Díván 280 and 366-7). Rúmí writes:

280                                              Lights of Irfán vol. 16

> He said, “Who is at the door?” I said, “Your humble
> slave.” He said, “What is your business?” I said, “Lord,
> to greet you.”

And he goes on in this vein for 12 verses. Óafi.z writes:

> To the (true Beloved), I said: “Grief for Thee, I have.”
> He said: “To the end (when union is attained), thy grief
> cometh:

And he continues in this fashion for 8 verses.

As to the three parts in which each qaßídih is usually divided,
the three parts of this poem are not so well distinguished from
one another as in a classical qaßídih, and rather follow one
another without a precise neat line. The first part comprises
verses 1-14. The second hemistich of verse 1, which mentions
the state of the lover, “fool for love” and “broken heart,”
loosely resembles a nasíb, a verse describing the beauty of the
Beloved and the state of the lover. We cannot say whether the
Poet really wants “his listeners share in his condition,” as it
usually happens in a tashbíb. Verse 14 may be loosely
considered as a gorízgáh, or passage, using “some skilful devices
of one or two verses,” to pass “into the second and most
important part.” The Poet asks the Beloved: “How is it that
Thou camest to this sick bed?” This question introduces the
second part, which comprises verses 15-29, and should be a
mad˙, that is an eulogy of the Beloved. However, only two
verses, 15 and 16, are devoted to a direct description of the
Beloved, “by Whose face the sun is enlightened in the sky” and
“by Whose love the essence of peace is unsettled.” The other
verses continue describing the Poet. This second description of
the Poet is different from that of the first part, because it
dwells on the relation between the Poet and the Beloved, and
especially the Poet’s faithfulness to His own love for the
Beloved. Obviously, when the Poet describes His own
faithfulness to the Beloved, somehow He implicitly hints to the
Beloved’s greatness, beauty and power. Could such a description

At Dawn The Friend Came                                        281

be considered as an eulogy of the Beloved? Verse 29 also seems
to meet the prerequisites of a gorízgáh, a passage. It says:

The Birds of Eternity returned to their nest,

We remained downtrodden and wretched on earth.

It describes the feelings of lover: he is “downtrodden and
wretched,” and lonely, because all His companions have offered
their lives in their love for their Beloved. This description
prepares the petition voiced in the third part, verses 30-4. The
Poet’s petition is absolutely unselfish. The Most Great Spirit is
implored, His advent is invoked, for the good of all “mortals,”
“pilgrims and companions” on the spiritual path.

As to the three important verses of this ode, the first (ma†la‘)
connotes the whole poem: “At dawn the Friend came to my
bed.” As to the transitional verse between the first and the
second part, verse 14,

I answered: “O Friend! O Healer of my soul!

How is it that Thou camest to this sick bed?”

may be loosely considered as a transitional verse (gurízgáh). The
Beloved is called: “Friend” and “Healer of my soul,” an
especially intimate description of the Most Great Spirit, to
Whom Bahá’u’lláh seems to address this poem. As to the last
verse, maqta‘, “which must be of a quality that redeems any
mediocrities in the work,” it will be commented upon later on.
As to the nom de plume (takhalluß), as has been said, Bahá’u’lláh
adopts the name of “Dervish,” and this appears in the final
verse.

Rhetorical devices

Bahá’u’lláh uses in this ode a number of rhetorical devices
typical of Persian poetry. The most important of them are as
follows.

282                                                  Lights of Irfán vol. 16

Tajnís, literally “alliteration” (Steingass 283), or jinás, literally
“play on words, pun” (Aryanpur Kashani 376), are “actual graphic
or phonetic play on words ... of various kinds which the reader
can easily imagine” (“Letteratura neopersiana” 177). Strictly
connected as it is to the phonetic feature of the language in
which the poem has been written, the alliteration cannot be
usually preserved in translations. For example Bahá’u’lláh
> “with no veil (bí-˙ijáb) ... beyond any mortal frame (bí-
> jassab)” (v.28) — the alliteration “bí-˙ijáb ... bí-jassab” is
> obviously lost in the English translation;
> “That You may discharge the mortals from their clay (Tá
> rahání khákyán-rá Tú zi khák)” (v.31) — also in this verse
> the alliteration “khákyán ... khák” is lost;
> “From the shackles of the world ... release (zi qayd-i-ín
> jahán bi-rahán)” (v.32) — the alliteration “ín jahán (the
> world) bi-rahán (release)” is lost.
> “Attire their heads with the crown of acceptance (Bar
> sar-ishán nih az táj-i-qabúl tájí)” (v.33) — the alliteration
> “táj ... tájí” is lost.

Isti‘arih is “a metaphor, like ‘the eye of the intellect will not
use any collyrium to purify its sight but the dust of thy
battles’” (“Letteratura neopersiana” 177). Sa˙ar ámad bi bistar-am
Yár is rich in such metaphors, as are all Bahá’u’lláh’s poems.
These are the most important examples:

> “bed of ease (bistar-i-rá˙at)” (v.4);
> “the heart of the world (kabid-i-‘álam) ... the eye of the
> universe (chashm-i-jahán)” (v.5);

> “the prison of cruelty (sijn-i-jafá)” (v.7);
> “an arrow | Of cruelty (tír-i-jafá)” (v.19);

> “Thy pitiless sword (tígh-i-jafá-t, lit. the sword of Your
> cruelty)” (v.22);
> “the lace of Thy love (rishtiy-i-˙ubb-i-Tú)” (v.24);
> “the fire of anguish (átash-i-gham)” (v.27);

> “Draw forth Thy hand from the Unseen (dastí az Ghayb
> bar ár)” (v.30);
> “the mirrors of their hearts (áyiniy-i-dil)” (v.31);
> “the crown of acceptance (táj-i-qabúl) ... the girdle of
> love (az ˙ubb zunnár)” (v.33).
Tashbíh, “similitude, likeness” (Steingass 302), is “our
comparison, of various, easily to guess, kinds” (“Letteratura
neopersiana” 177-8). For example Bahá’u’lláh writes:

> “thy body ... as thin as a thread (gashtih badan-at chún
> tár)” (v.11);
> “as bitten by a snake (kih gazíd-ash már)” (v.12).
Óashv, or redundancy, is the “juxtaposition of synonymous
words to reinforce a poetical concept” (“Letteratura neopersiana”
177). For example, Bahá’u’lláh writes

> “thou tossest and turnest (ghal†í-u píchí)” (v.12);
> “the secret of my heart (Sirr-i-dil) ... the riddle of my
> soul (Ramz-i-ján)” (v.18);
> “downtrodden and wretched (dhalíl-u khwár)” (v.29).
Tanásub, “relation, conformity” (Steingass 326), is the
introduction of “things naturally associated, as for example
arch and arrow, night and day, etc.” (“Letteratura neopersiana” 178).
Bahá’u’lláh associates

> “sun ... sky (shams ... samá’)” (v.15);
> “mountains and plains (kúh ... dasht)” (v.20);
284                                                 Lights of Irfán vol. 16

“Birds ... nest (a†yár ... áshyán)” (v.29).

In verse 32 He mentions “pilgrims and companions (muhájarín-
u anßár).” The association of these two words goes back to
Koran 9:101:

> As for those who led the way, the first of the
> Mohadjers, and the Ansars, and those who have
> followed their noble conduct, God is well pleased with
> them, and they with Him: He hath made ready for them
> gardens under whose trees the rivers flow: to abide
> therein for aye: this shall be the great bliss.

and to Koran 9:18:

> Now hath God turned Him unto the Prophet and unto
> the refugees (Mohadjers), and unto the helpers (Ansars),
> who followed him in the hour of distress, after that the
> hearts of a part of them had well nigh failed them. Then
> turned He unto them, for He was Kind to them,
> Merciful.

Óusn-i-ta‘líl is a “fantastic aetiology, that is ascribing
fantastic, poetical causes to real facts and things” (“Letteratura
neopersiana” 178). Bahá’u’lláh writes in this vein:

Thy pains set on fire the hearts of the friends;

Thy groans darkened the faces of the lover. (v.8)

Thine eyes shed rubies of blood, whereby

The eye of the twilight hath turned pomegranate red. (v.9)

Mubálighih, “exaggeration” (Steingass 1149), is our hyperbole,
which in Persian poetry “takes incredibly extreme forms”
(“Letteratura neopersiana” 178). Bahá’u’lláh writes in this vein:

Should I tell what I saw in my love for Thee,

My tongue would grow weary of speaking. (v.21)

I tied my heart to the curl of Thy tresses,

That it may be not be unloosed till the Judgment Day. (v.25)

Should I be slaughtered a myriad times, with every

Moment, still I wouldn’t rebel against Thy love. (v.26)

Raddu’l-‘ajiuz ‘ala’ß-ßadr “consists in using the same word in
two different parts of the verse, that which confers a sense of
rhythm to the whole” (“Letteratura neopersiana” 178). Like tajnís,
also this rhetorical device is strictly connected to the phonetic
features of the Persian language, and thus it cannot be usually
preserved in translations. For example Bahá’u’lláh writes in this
vein:

The heart of the world was burnt by the fire of Thy wails

(átash-i-áh),
The eyes of the universe was consumed by the fire (átash-

bár, lit. inflamed) of thine afflictions. (v.5)
“‘Cause my head (sar-am) hasn’t been ... hung on the gallows

(sar-i-dár)” (v.27).
Óusn-i-maq†a‘, or beautiful final verse, “consists in a skilful
request for a prize written by the poet who puts his signature in
the last verse of his qaßídè” (“Letteratura neopersiana” 178). The
poems written by Bahá’u’lláh have not a human addressee, to
whom He might ask something. Therefore this device does not
appear in this form in His poems. At most Bahá’u’lláh addresses
His “beautiful final verse” to Himself, as for example verse 34,
in which He urges Himself not to reveal Himself to the world,
because the times are not yet ripe:

That’s enough, O Dervish! Don’t torment us any longer,

‘Cause many sparks have fallen from these words.

Ta∂ádd, which Haïm translates “Contrast ... antilogy” (1:445),
but would more precisely be translated “antithesis,” is “the
rhetorical opposing or contrasting of ideas by means of

286                                             Lights of Irfán vol. 16

grammatically parallel arrangements of words, clauses, or
sentences” (Webster’s 96). Bahá’u’lláh uses this rhetorical devise
in the first hemistich of verse 15:

O Thou, by Whose love the essence of peace is unsettled.

The contents of the poem

The first person narrator is always Bahá’u’lláh, the lover.

This poem seems to describe the mystical experience of His
encounter with the Most Great Spirit, the Friend, in Teheran’s
Síyáh-Chál. The lover is sleepless, pale and thin. So faithful is he
to his Beloved that he will willingly suffer for Him to the Day
of Judgment. The Beloved, so caring that He goes to the
bedside of His lover (v.1), does not appear ironic and cruel, as it
usually does in Persian mystical poetry. He is even tender-
hearted, when He asks the lover the reasons of his sleeplessness
and faithfulness (vv.11-13):

Wherefore art thou restless tonight? Wherefore

Hath thy body become as thin as a thread?

In the night thou tossest and turnest on thy couch,

Thou tossest and groanest, as bitten by a snake.

Why doest thou turn and groan, now?

Why doeth thy face turn pale?

If we read this poem according to the classical standards of
Persian mystical poetry, we could think that the Beloved is so
cruel that He mocks His lover, because of his acceptance of the
pains he is meeting in his love for Him. An example of this kind
of scorn may be found in the following verse of a ghazal by
Rúmí:

> My idol scolds, saying, “Why have you fallen in the
> middle of the road?” (Mystical Poems 2:121, no.366, v.1)

But if we read verses 11-13 in a Bahá’í perspective, they seem
to say that the Beloved worries for His lover and sympathizes
with him. In this respect, they are reminiscent of the dialogue
between Bahá’u’lláh and the Maid of Heaven as described in
Lawh-i-Óúríyyih. In this Tablet the Maid of Heaven perceives
such a pain in Bahá’u’lláh that She lifts “Her gaze to the
heavens with grief and misery,” and looks “at the earth in
confusion and regret” (“Tablet of the Maiden,” provisional translation
by Juan R. Cole).

The figure of the Beloved is just outlined in verses 15-6. He
seems an exalted spiritual Entity, “Almighty (Kirdigár)” (v.28),
“Unique One (A˙ad)” (v.28), a “Mystery of God (Sirr-i-Khudá)”
(v.30). Later on, verse 31 describes Him as capable of relieving
“the mortals from their clay” and of cleansing “the mirrors of
the hearts from their rust.” The lover does not suffer for his
remoteness from the Beloved, because the Beloved is beside
him. He suffers because his love is exposed to the wickedness
of his fellow-beings, who oppress him in several ways. The
autobiographical reference is very clear. In His love for the
Beloved, Bahá’u’lláh has renounced whatever may interest a
common human being: home, wealth, social position,
connections, even His country. It is not the Beloved the cause
of His pain. His own faithfulness to love is the cause of his
pains.

Major themes

Of the four major themes of Persian lyrical poetry as
described by Bausani, that is “wine, love, springtime and
mystics” (“Letteratura neopersiana” 176), only wine is absent.
Springtime motifs mostly appear as nature tropes. Mystical
themes appear sometimes as theological and scriptural motifs.
They also appear as didactic themes, the early seeds of the new
mystical way that Bahá’u’lláh was opening to His lovers. Last
but not least, this poem has many autobiographical references.

Love

The whole poem is based on this uplifting theme. It may be
viewed as a passionate conversation between two lovers. Many
of the clichés of the lover language of Sufi poetry appear in
these verses. The lover is “fool for love,” broken hearted,
pining away for his Lover, sleepless, thin and pale. He suffers,
as the lovers of traditional Sufi poems. Bahá’u’lláh typically
My groans proclaim the secret of my heart;

My tearful eyes reveal the riddle of my soul. (v.18)

However, whereas the Sufi lover suffers because his Beloved
is cruel, remains far from him, and often mocks him for his
love, in this Poem the Beloved is close to His lover, and has pity
for him, and welcomes his faithfulness. As has been said, it is
the hostility of his fellow-beings, that makes the lover suffer.
Wherever the lover goes, he is a prisoner, a description
reminiscent of other words written by Bahá’u’lláh about
Himself: “At all times He was at the mercy of the wicked doers.
At one time they cast Him into prison, at another they banished
Him, and at yet another hurried Him from land to land” (Súriy-i-
Haykal: Queen Victoria 92, sec.1, para.177). He wrote moreover in the
Kitáb-i-ˆqán: “All this generation could offer Us were wounds
from its darts, and the only cup it proffered to Our lips was the
cup of its venom. On our neck We still bear the scar of chains,
and upon Our body are imprinted the evidences of an
unyielding cruelty.” [KI 190]

Springtime motifs and nature tropes

The opening verse of this ode recites: “At dawn (sa˙ar) the
Friend came to my bed.” This beginning resembles a ma†la‘, the
first verse of a ghazal. The Beloved visits the lover at dawn,
when he is still asleep. It is a common poetical device among
the Sufis. For example Rúmí wrote:

> Yesterday at dawn (sa˙arí) passing by the Beloved said to
> me, “You are distraught and unaware; how long will this
> go on?” (Mystical poems 1:110, no.130, v.1; Díván, “Ghazalyát,”
> no.1022, v.1)

Rúmí writes moreover:

One morning (sa˙arí) He whose sleep

The angels envy came and looked into my heart.

He wept and I wept, as long as the dawn arrived.
They asked: “Of the two, who is the lover?” (Díván,

“Rubá’yát,” part. 2)

Also Fátimih Zarrín-Táj Baragháni (ca.1817–1852), known as
Qurratu’l-‘Ayn, Consolation of the Eyes, or more frequently as
ˇáhirih, the Pure, famous among the Bahá’ís as one of the Báb’s
Letters of the Living, and among the Persians as a refined
poetess, writes in one of her poems:

As in sleep I lay at the dawn of day that cruel Charmer came

to me,
And in the grace of His form and face the dawn of the morn

I seemed to see. (qtd. in Browne, A Persian Anthology 70-1)
Dawn, “in the Islamic tradition, time par excellence of
ecstasy and visions” (Saccone, “Sensi e soprasensi” 41), associated as
it is to the rising sun after the nocturnal darkness, symbolizes
the return of spirit in a lifeless world. Bahá’u’lláh was born in
Teheran on 12 November 1817 at dawn and seems to have a
strong personal tie with this time of the day. Rú˙íyyih Rabbani
(1910–2000), the wife of Shoghi Effendi, the Guardian of the
Bahá’í Faith, writes in this regard:

> He had, evidently, a deep association with that hour of
> the day when the life of the world is repoured into it.
> How could He not have? Was He not the Hermit of Sar-
> Galú, where He spent many months in a lonely stone hut
290                                               Lights of Irfán vol. 16

> perched on a hilltop; the sunrise must have often found
> Him waiting and watching for its coming, His voice
> rising and falling in the melodious chants of His
> supplications and compositions. At how many dawns He
> must have heard the birds of the wilderness wake and cry
> out when the first rays of the sun flowed over the
> horizon and witnessed in all its splendor the coming
> alive of creation after the night. (Bahá’í World vol. 9, 792)

The time of dawn has deep spiritual meanings in the Writings
of Bahá’u’lláh. It is the beginning of the manifestation of the
potentialities of the new Day of God, it is the beginning of a
new, personal and collective, spiritual journey. And, since
advanced mystics “see the end and the beginning as one” (SV15),
dawn is a precious time of multi-potentiality, a special time of
communion with the Divine. Bahá’u’lláh wrote:

> For Thine ardent lovers Thou hast, according to Thy
> decree, reserved, at each daybreak (as˙ár), the cup of
> Thy remembrance, O Thou Who art the Ruler of rulers!
> These are they who have been so inebriated with the
> wine of Thy manifold wisdom that they forsake their
> couches in their longing to celebrate Thy praise and
> extol Thy virtues, and flee from sleep in their eagerness
> to approach Thy presence and partake of Thy bounty.

(PM142, sec.85, para.2; Munáját 87)

Verse 9 also is significant for its nature tropes:

Thine eyes shed rubies of blood, whereby

The eye of the twilight hath turned pomegranate red.

The tears of blood similar to rubies are part of the clichés of
Persian mystical poetry. For example Majdúd Saná’í (d.
ca.1141), the earliest Persian mystical lyric poet, writes:

When that purest pearl moves away from me,

It befits me to shed rubies from my eyes. (Díván,

“Ghazalyát,” no.241, v.7)

This distich is a play on colours: the lover sheds tears similar to
rubies and the twilight shares his pain taking on the hues of a
pomegranate. Many Persian poets use these images. For example
Óafi.z writes:

O gardener (God, the Creator)! drive me not away like the

> wind (portionless) from the door of the garden (of
> existence);
For the water (of dominion and of creation) of the rose-

> bed, like the ruddy pomegranate (gulnár), with the
(bloody) tears of mine is. (Díván 104, “Ghazalyát,” no.40,

v.6)

As to colours, in the Bahá’í Writings the adjective
“Crimson,” that is “a rich deep red colour inclining to purple”
(OED4:23), is often associated with the Manifestation of God or
with exalted spiritual realms. Bahá’u’lláh mentions the

> crimson Tree (sidratu’l-˙amrá) (Law˙-i-Siyyid-i-Mihdíy-i-
> Dahájí 196; Majmú‘ih 121, para.6);

> Crimson Pillar (rukni’l-˙amrá’) (GDM72, para.05; Jawáhir

Verse 16 recites:

The sky has filled its skirt (dámán) with pearls (gawhar),

That it may lay it down at the feet of Thy Majesty.

The skirt filled with pearls is among the clichés used by Persian
mystical poets. For example Rúmí writes:

> She filled her skirt (dámán) with pearls (gawhar) and sat
> down at his bedside. (Díván, “Ghazalyát,” no.2041, v.5)

This poetical description of the Beloved’s beauty, evoking a
nocturnal sky spangled with stars, is reminiscent of the
following words in a meditation by Bahá’u’lláh: “Every time I
lift up mine eyes unto Thy heaven, I call to mind Thy highness
and Thy loftiness, and Thine incomparable glory and greatness”
(PM271, sec.76, para.15). While writing this verse, Bahá’u’lláh may

have gone with His mind back to the clear night skies of His
adolescence, when He visited the mountain villages of Afchih
and Tákur, where His family had two Mansions, or Yálrúd, the
native town of His beloved wife Ásíyih (ca.1820–1886), known
as Navváb, located in the Alborz range.

Mystical themes

Verse 28 recites:

I come with no veil before Thee to behold, O Almighty,

Thy Face beyond any mortal frame, O Unique One.

This distich has strong mystical connotations. The Beloved is
invoked as “Unique One (A˙ad)” and “Almighty (Kirdigár).”
The lover goes “with no veil” in front of the Beloved, so that he
may behold Him “beyond any mortal frame (bí-jasad, lit.
without body).” This image also belongs to the malámatí vein,
because the Persian adjective bí-˙ijáb has a connotation of
immodesty. The German Orientalist Annemarie Schimmel
(1922–2003) remarks that Islam “strictly prohibits nudity”
(Deciphering 93). She then adds:

> As contrary as nudity is to strict Islamic prescriptions,
> it is nevertheless used as a metaphor in mystical
> language, and authors like Bahá-i Walad (d. 1231) and
> his son, Jaláluddín Rúmí, as well as Násir Muhammad
> ‘Andalíb and Siráj Awrangábádí in eighteenth-century
> India (to mention only a few), used this term to point to
> the moment when the everyday world and its objects
> have, as it were, been discarded and only God and the
> soul are left in a union attained by the absolute
> “denudation” of the soul. (Deciphering 94)

The strong mystical hues of this distich suggest that this
locution, “with no veil,” or naked, could be interpreted as
wholly detached from anything but the Beloved, “detached from

294                                                Lights of Irfán vol. 16

all else but Him” (Súriy-i-Mulúk 204, sec.5, para.47). It is reminiscent
of an aphorism of the Persian Hidden Words reciting: “Pass
beyond the baser stages of doubt and rise to the exalted heights
of certainty. Open the eye of truth, that thou mayest behold the
veilless Beauty (Jamál-i-mubín) and exclaim: Hallowed be the
Lord, the most excellent of all creators!” (no.9; Kalimát-i-Maknúnih
426). If the lover wants to behold the Beloved without veils,
first he must remove his own veils, that is detach himself from
whatever may bind him to the lower, animal, level of his
existence and separate him from his higher, spiritual, level.

Theological themes

Verse 15 says:

O Thou, by Whose Face the sun is enlightened in the sky,

O Thou, by Whose love the essence of peace is unsettled.

The description of the Beloved takes in this verse mystical
and theological connotations. When the Most Great Spirit
shows Its face, that is reveals Itself, the Sun of Reality, the
Manifestation of God, rises in the world. His light enlightens
the sun itself in the sky. The Manifestation of God is “the
central Orb of the universe, its Essence and ultimate Purpose”
(KI99-100, para.106). Because of Him “the essence of peace is
unsettled.” In the Beloved the opposites coincide. According to
the Sufis the coincidence of opposites is only realized in Being
in Itself, bringing “all opposites together in a single reality”
(Chittick 112). An aspect of this coincidence is the harmonious
balance between elements which human beings often see as
conflicting with one another, as for example love and reason,
war and peace. Rúmí writes:

> The mind cannot compass its [the pen of the Beloved]
> description, for in it is the union of opposites, a com-
> position without composition, amazing! — constrained
> yet with free will. (Mystical Poems 2:94, no.324, v.9)

Bahá’u’lláh explains that the coincidence of opposites is
realized in the Manifestation of God: “I bear witness that in
His person solidity and fluidity have been joined and
combined” (PM48, sec.38, para.3). He explains moreover in the
Kitáb-i-ˆqán:

> These Prophets and chosen Ones of God are the
> recipients and revealers of all the unchangeable
> attributes and names of God. They are the mirrors that
> truly and faithfully reflect the light of God. Whatsoever
> is applicable to them is in reality applicable to God,
> Himself, Who is both the Visible and the Invisible ...
> Through the manifold attributes of these Essences of
> Detachment, Who are both the first and the last, the
> seen and the hidden, it is made evident that He Who is
> the Sun of Truth is “the First and the Last, the Seen, and
> the Hidden.”6 (KI142-3, para.151)

He alludes to this concept in the following verse in another
Poem:

Through His wisdom, the coincidence of opposites is made

manifest,
Now Love becomes a servant, now the Intellect a porter.

(Sáqí, bi-dih ábí, verse 19)

Verse 15, however, can also have a simpler interpretation.

Such is the ardour of the lover’s love for the Beloved, that his
heart is disquieted. Bahá’u’lláh uses a similar metaphor in His
Law˙-i-Óikmat describing Apollonius of Tyana, a philosopher
and an ascetic of the first century AD, to whom He ascribes the
following words: “My heart is seized with alarm, my limbs
tremble, I have lost my reason and my mind hath failed me”
(148).

296                                            Lights of Irfán vol. 16

Scriptural themes

Bahá’u’lláh mentions “pilgrims and companions” (v.32).

Moreover He writes in verse 30:

O Mystery of God! Draw forth Thy hand from the Invisible.

As to “pilgrims and companions (muhájarín-u anßár),” it is a
reference to the followers of Muhammad, immediately after the
Hegira. Pilgrims are those followers who accompanied Him in
His relocation from Mecca to Medina. Companions are the
inhabitants of the town who supported Him.8 As has been
previously said, these two words are mentioned together in the
Koran (9:18 and 101). Bausani explains the meaning of the Hegira,

> erroneously sometimes called “flight” to Medina. The
> Arabic word hiğra, from which our vulgar hegira comes,
> mainly conveys, beside the concept of “leaving” and
> “emigrating,” the idea of “rescission of tribal ties;” in
> other words it has technical and juridical connotations.

(“Religione islamica” 376)

Distich 32 seems to imply that the effects of the Revelation
will become manifest in all those who will accompany the new
Manifestation in His new “Hegira” and will assist Him, cutting
all ties with their former tradition. This verse also conveys an
autobiographical reference. Bahá’u’lláh also has left His Mecca,
Teheran. He has been followed by a few faithful relatives, His
first wife Navváb, His nine years old son, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, His
seven years old daughter, Báhíyyih Khánum (1846–1932), His
loyal true brother, Mírzá Músa (ca.1819–1887), known as Áqáy-
i-Kalím, and His young half-brother, Mírzá Mu˙ammad-Qulí
(1837–1910), who was faithful to Bahá’u’lláh even after His
passing (see GPB108, sec.7, para.10). In Baghdad He found only a
handful of faithful companions who assisted Him. Otherwise
He was completely alone. He describes His loneliness as
follows: “Upon Our arrival in ‘Iráq We found the Cause of God
sunk in deep apathy and the breeze of divine revelation stilled.

Most of the believers were faint and dispirited, nay utterly lost
and dead” (Ishraqát 130).

As to hemistich 30, it is an allusion to the white hand
outstretched by Moses (see Savi 184-6) and it can be more easily
understood in the light of the Koranic episode to which it
refers. As in the Bible (Ex. 4:2-9), the Koran relates that, when
God assigned to Moses the mission of rescuing the Jews from
their Egyptian captivity, He vouchsafed upon Him a
thaumaturgic power as a proof of His divine mission.

“... Now, what is that in thy right hand, O Moses?”

Said he, “It is my staff on which I lean, and with which I beat

down leaves for my sheep, and I have other uses for it.”

He said, “Cast it down, O Moses!”

So he cast it down, and lo! it became a serpent that ran

along.

He said, “Lay hold on it, and fear not: to its former state will

we restore it.”

“Now place thy right hand (yad) to thy arm-pit: it shall come

forth white, but unhurt:– another sign! –

That We may shew thee the greatest of our signs

Go to Pharaoh, for he hath burst all bounds.” (20:17-24)

The Sufi masters maintained that “Whiteness signifies the First
Intellect, which is the center of the primal cloud (‘amá’). It is
the first thing that emerges from the blackness of the unseen
and is the greatest source of light within that realm, being
described as whiteness, in juxtaposition to the blackness of the
unseen” (Nurbakhsh 4:54).

Bahá’u’lláh offers a key for the explanation of the episodes
of Moses’ life in the Kitáb-i-ˆqán. He writes: “Armed with the
rod of celestial dominion, adorned with the white hand of

298                                              Lights of Irfán vol. 16

divine knowledge, and proceeding from the Párán of the love
of God, and wielding the serpent of power and everlasting
majesty, He [Moses] shone forth from the Sinai of light upon
the world” (KI11, para.12). In other Tablets Bahá’u’lláh ascribes
to Himself the sign of the White Hand: “This is Mine hand
which God hath turned white for all the worlds to behold” (qtd.
in GPB 169, sec.10, para.12).

Didactic themes

The importance of three main concepts emerges from this
poem: faithfulness, tribulations and acceptance.

As to faithfulness, the covenant of love that binds the lover
to his Beloved is eternal. The lover has tied his “heart to the curl
of Thy tresses,” so “That it may not be unloosed till the
Judgement Day” (v.25). This covenant implies for the lover to
entirely forgets his self, and to make whatever his Beloved
wishes. Historical examples of people who betrayed this
covenant of love are, in the Christian Dispensation, Judas
Iscariot and, in the Bahá’í Dispensation, Mu˙ammad ‘Alí (ca.
1853–1937), the unfaithful son of Bahá’u’lláh, who did not
accept the last will clearly set down by his Father, and rebelled
against ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, His appointed Successor. In this man the
selfish love for power, that in him took the form of a desire of
being the successor of his Father in the place of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá,
prevailed over his love for the divine Beauty of his own Father.
Bahá’u’lláh also writes:

My soul won’t cut the lace of Thy love,

Should it be beheaded with a deadly blade. (v.24)

Should I be slaughtered a myriad times,

Still I wouldn’t rebel against Thy love. (v.26)

It is another symbolic and hyperbolic description of the lover’s
faithfulness. This prerequisite is mentioned by Bahá’u’lláh in

the introduction of the Four Valleys: “Have they not told thee
that faithfulness (istiqámat) is a duty on those who follow the
mystic way, that it is the true guide to His Holy Presence?”
(FV74, Chihár Vádí 141). It is also mentioned in the Persian Hidden
Words:

> The first call of the Beloved is this: O mystic
> nightingale! Abide not but in the rose-garden of the
> spirit. O messenger of the Solomon of love! Seek thou
> no shelter except in the Sheba of the well-beloved, and
> O immortal phoenix! dwell not save on the mount of
> faithfulness. Therein is thy habitation, if on the wings
> of thy soul thou soarest to the realm of the infinite and
> seekest to attain thy goal. (HW no.1)

Rúmí writes in this vein:

> He said: “Where is calamity?” Said I: “In the
> neighborhood of thy love”

> He said: “How fare are you there?” Said I: “In
> steadfastness (istiqámat).” (Selected Poems 57, 14:11)

Reynold Alleyne Nicholson (1868–1945), the well-known
eminent English orientalist, remarks that the Sufis ascribed
many meanings to the word faithfulness (istiqámat), as for
example “Continuance, the non preference of anything to God”
(237). This meaning seems pertinent in this verse. The lover does
not put anything before God, not even His life. Óafi.z writes in
this vein:

> If desire be thine that the (true) beloved should not (by
> severing asunder attachments to thee) break the
> covenant,

> Keep (with respect) the end of the cord so that (the
> covenant) he may preserve. (Díván 294, “Ghazalyát,” no.146, v.2)
300                                              Lights of Irfán vol. 16

Óafiz. moreover ascribes the following words to the Beloved:
“respect the bond: be faithful in love, and I will not fail” (qtd. in
Nicholson 275).

As to tribulations, Bahá’u’lláh writes: “my spirit yearns after
Thy tribulations” (v.23). A Sufi cliché of the lover is that he is
willing to face every kind of pain and tribulation for his
Beloved’s sake. This concept is expressed by many Persian
mystical poets, as for example Saná’í, who wrote:

That heart which stands aloof from pain and woe
No seal or signature of Love can show. (qtd. in Browne, A

Literary History 2:322)

Bahá’u’lláh repeatedly expounded this idea in His Writings:

> But for the tribulations which are sustained in Thy path,
> how could Thy true lovers be recognized; and were it
> not for the trials which are borne for love of Thee, how
> could the station of such as yearn for Thee be revealed?
> Thy might beareth me witness! The companions of all
> who adore Thee are the tears they shed, and the
> comforters of such as seek Thee are the groans they
> utter, and the food of them who haste to meet Thee is
> the fragments of their broken hearts. (PM155, sec.92,
> para.1)

The lover accepts everything out of his love for the Beloved.

He accepts the “pitiless sword” (v.22) or as He later said:
“Behold Thou my head ready to fall before the sword (sayf) of
Thy Will, my neck prepared to bear the chains of Thy Desire,
my heart yearning to be made a target for the darts of Thy
Decree (qa∂á) ...” (PM95, sec.60, para.1; Munáját 69). He loves
suffering (dard), because He knows that “But for tribulations
(baláyá), how could the assured be distinguished from the
doubters among Thy servants? They who have been inebriated
with the wine of Thy knowledge, these, verily, hasten to meet
every manner of adversity (baláyá) in their longing to pass into

Thy presence” (PM9, sec.6, para.2; Munáját 11). The lover clings to
the decree (qadá) of God and his heart yearns “to be made a
target for the darts of ... [His] Decree (qa∂á’)” (PM95, sec.60,
para.1; Munáját 69), a decree (qa∂á’) that is “the sole hope of them
that have recognized Thy truth” (PM220, sec.133, para.1). He wants
to suffer (balá), because He is aware of the beneficial effects of
the pains of mystical love. Later on He went so far as stating:
“Perish that lover who discerneth between the pleasant and the
poisonous in his love for his beloved! Be thou satisfied with
what God hath destined (qa∂ay) for thee” (PM11, sec.8, para.2;
Munáját 13).

Submission to the Decree of God is emphasized as a sign of
love in many other Writings by Bahá’u’lláh, as for example: “O
Thou Whose tests (balá’) are a healing medicine to such as are
nigh unto Thee, Whose sword (sayf) is the ardent desire of all
them that love Thee, Whose dart is the dearest wish of those
hearts that yearn after Thee, Whose decree (qa∂á’) is the sole
hope of them that have recognized Thy truth!” (PM220-1, sec.133,
para.1; Munáját 148). In Gems of Divine Mysteries, in the City of
Love and Rapture, He writes that the lover “standeth ready to
obey whatsoever His Lord should please to decree as to his
beginning and his end” (GDM29, para.38). This verse is
reminiscent of Psalm 119:31 (KJB): “I cling to your decrees;
LORD, do not put me to shame. I have stuck unto thy
testimonies: O LORD, put me not to shame.” This Psalm is
described in the Italian Catholic Jerusalem Bible [Bibbia di
Gerusalemme] as “A Praise of the Divine Law” (1256).

As to acceptance, Bahá’u’lláh writes in verse 33:

Attire their heads with the crown of acceptance,

Gird up their temples with the girdle of love.

The word acceptance (qabúl) seems to be used in
Bahá’u’lláh’s Writings with at least three different
connotations. The most frequent meaning is God’s acceptance
of human deeds:

> the meads of the good-pleasure of God may waft upon
> us the sweet savours of divine acceptance (qabúl), and
> cause us, vanishing mortals that we are, to attain unto
> the Kingdom of everlasting glory. (KI134, para.146; KMI104)

> Occupy thyself, during these fleeting days of thy life,
> with such deeds as will diffuse the fragrance of Divine
> good pleasure, and will be adorned with the ornament of
> His acceptance (qabúl). (ESW76; Law˙-i Mubárak-i-Kha†áb 51)

The second meaning is man’s acceptance of God’s decrees:

> What is it that could have induced them to reconcile
> themselves (qabúl namúdih-and) to these grievous trials,
> and to refuse to put forth a hand to repel them? (ESW75;
> Law˙-i Mubárak-i-Kha†áb 51)

Thus this verse could mean that the Beloved will adorn all heads
with the crown of acceptance (qabúl), so that everyone “instead
of complaining,” will render “thanks unto God, and amidst the
darkness of their anguish” will reveal “naught but radiant
acquiescence to His will” (KI235, para.264).

The third meaning is the human acceptance of the
Manifestation of God:

> Hath, from the foundation of the world until the
> present day, any Light or Revelation shone forth from
> the dayspring of the will of God which the kindreds of
> the earth have accepted (qabúl namúdih), and Whose
> Cause they have acknowledged? (ESW92; Law˙-i Mubárak-i-
> Kha†áb 61)

When the Manifestation of God reveals Himself to the
world, the highest form of acceptance (qabúl) is to accept the
fact that God has decreed the beginning of a new Dispensation.

Bahá’u’lláh writes in this regard: “True belief in God and
recognition of Him cannot be complete save by acceptance
(tabaßßur) of that which He hath revealed and by observance of
whatsoever hath been decreed by Him and set down in the Book
by the Pen of Glory” (Tajallíyát 50; Majmú’ih 27, para.11).
Interestingly, in this verse acceptance is associated with love,
the central theme of the whole poem.

Autobiographical references

This poem is also rich in autobiographical references, see for
example the following verses:

Now is placed in fetters thy neck, as if thou werest a

rebellious
Servant, now, bound in chains, thou art hurried to the

bazaar.

Now thou are wronged in the hands of the oppressor,
Now thou spendest days and nights in the prison of

cruelty. (v.6-7)

I was dragged through mountains and plains (v.20)

The Birds of Eternity (A†yár-i-Baqá) returned to their nest

We remained downtrodden and wretched on earth. (v.29)

As to the words “Now is placed in fetters thy neck, as if thou
werest a rebellious Servant,” Bahá’u’lláh wrote in His Tablet to
Náßiri’d-Dín Sháh:

> For them who are endued with discernment, and whose
> eyes are fixed upon the Sublime Vision, it is no secret
> that I have been, most of the days of My life, even as a
> slave, sitting under a sword (sayfun) hanging on a thread,
> knowing not whether it would fall soon or late upon
> him. (Súriy-i-Haykal 136, sec.1, para.273; Áthár 1:87)
304                                            Lights of Irfán vol. 16

As to the sentence “now, bound in chains, thou art hurried
to the bazaar,” it is reminiscent of that terrible day, in August
1853, when Bahá’u’lláh was brought to the prison of Síyáh-
Chál, a day He Himself described as follows:

> We were in no wise connected with that evil deed, and
> Our innocence was indisputably established by the
> tribunals. Nevertheless, they apprehended Us, and from
> Níyávaran, which was then the residence of His Majesty,
> conducted Us, on foot and in chains, with bared head
> and bare feet, to the dungeon of ˇihrán. A brutal man,
> accompanying Us on horseback, snatched off Our hat,
> whilst We were being hurried along by a troop of
> executioners and officials. We were consigned for four
> months to a place foul beyond comparison. (ESW20)

The “oppressors” could be all His adversaries about whom
He wrote in those days, that “with one consent [they] have
fallen upon me” (PM234, sec.145, para.1). And the prison of cruelty
could be the Síyáh-Chál, “a place foul beyond comparison”
(ESW20). And also in later years He was imprisoned, as He wrote
about Himself: “He hath, during the greater part of His life,
been sore-tried in the clutches of His enemies. His sufferings
have now reached their culmination in this afflictive Prison,
into which His oppressors have so unjustly thrown Him”
(GWB58, sec. XXIII, para.4). As to verse 20, it is reminiscent of
Bahá’u’lláh’s travel from Teheran to Baghdad, which began in
the heart of winter (12 January 1853–8 April 1853). First He
passed through barren “plains (dasht),” but later on His caravan
crossed the Saveh Pass and then the Sháh Pass through the
Nahavand Mountains and finally Mount Zagros (see Ruhe 165-74).
In this verse Bahá’u’lláh writes that the lover is “dragged
through mountains (kúh) and plains (dasht),” a condition He
later described in the Epistle to the Son of the Wolf: “At one
time I found Myself on the heights of mountains (jibál); at
another in the depths of the prison (sijn) of ˇá (ˇihrán), in
chains and fetters” (ESW78; Law˙-i Mubárak-i-Kha†áb 53).

The lover is “drawn in front of the wicked (fujjár),” a
condition He later described as follows: “At one time they cast
Him into prison, at another they banished Him, and at yet
another hurried Him from land to land” (ESW63-4). As to verse
29, it has both mystical and historical connotations. In this
verse Bahá’u’lláh uses a locution very similar to a locution used
in the Kitáb-i-ˆqán, “Birds of Eternity (A†yár-i-Baqá ...
Óamámát-i-Azalíyat)” (KI17, para.16; KMI14; see also KI24, para.24,
KMI 19). In those contexts the locution refers to the
Manifestations of God. Perhaps in verse 29 it refers not only to
the Báb, martyred in Tabríz on 9 July 1851, but also to all those
believers who “with ... love ... devotion ... exultation and holy
rapture ... sacrificed their lives in the path of the All-Glorious”
(KI226, para.251), the Bábí martyrs. Bahá’u’lláh wrote about them:

> Their breasts were made targets for the darts of the
> enemy, and their heads adorned the spears of the infidel.
> No land remained which did not drink the blood of these
> embodiments of detachment, and no sword that did not
> bruise their necks. (KI224, para.250)

This verse seems to reflect the feelings of a Person Who,
after having seen all those companions being slaughtered in the
path of God and the following, almost immediate, decline of
the Bábí Community, perhaps wished to have gone He Himself
together with them. It seems to convey the same
discouragement described in the Fire Tablet, revealed many
years after in ‘Akká. But it is only a flash. Immediately after He
claims:

The time hath come for the banner to be hoisted.
O Mystery of God! Draw forth Thy hand from the

Unseen.

And the atmosphere of certitude and eagerness, typical of this
poem is immediately renewed.

A slow reading of the poem

The following thoughts are offered only as personal
reflections on the verses revealed by Bahá’u’lláh, whose perusal
may evoke remembrances of His own Writings as well as of
verses of earlier poets.

Huva’l-Mughní fí kull-i-shá’n9

He is the Provider in all circumstances

The poem is preceded, as often happens in the Muslim as
well as Bahá’í literature, by an invocation of a name of God. In
this case Bahá’u’lláh uses the attribute of God al-Mughní, the
Enricher, defined by the British Orientalist, translator and
lexicographer Edward William Lane (1801–1876) as “as a name
of God ... He who satisfies, or contents, whom He will, of his
servants” (Lane 6:87). It is one of the ninety-nine “Most Beautiful
Names” that Muslim theologians have discovered in the Koran,
and precisely the 89th. It is a direct acknowledgment of the
Divine Providence, which suffices to everything in any
circumstance of life and an indirect statement of submission to
the Divine Decree, as befits One Who has just received the
intimation of such a momentous Mission. Bahá’u’lláh proclaims
His submission to the Divine Will in many Writings. For
example He writes:

> Every time I hold my peace, and cease to extol Thy
> wondrous virtues, Thy Spirit impelleth me to cry out
> before all who are in Thy heaven and on Thy earth; and
> every time I am still, the breaths wafted from the right
> hand of Thy will and purpose pass over me, and stir me
> up, and I find myself to be as a leaf which lieth at the
> mercy of the winds of Thy decree, and is carried away
> whithersoever Thou dost permit or command it. Every
> man of insight who considereth what hath been revealed

> by me, will be persuaded that Thy Cause is not in my
> hands, but in Thy hands, and will recognize that the
> reins of power are held not in my grasp but in Thy
> grasp, and are subject to Thy sovereign might. (PM306-7,
> sec.79, para.10)

> Grievous as is My plight, O God, My Well-Beloved, I
> render thanks unto Thee, and My Spirit is grateful for
> whatsoever hath befallen me in the path of Thy good-
> pleasure. I am well pleased with that which Thou didst
> ordain for Me, and welcome, however calamitous, the
> pains and sorrows I am made to suffer. (Súriy-i-Damm 89-
> 90, sec. XXXIX, para.1)

The Persian-Arabic script ‫( ﻣﻐﻨﯽ‬M-gh-n-í) could also be read as
Mughanní, “A singer” (Steingass 1282). Óafiz. ascribes this
attribute to God Himself. He writes:

> Saki by the independence of profligates, (I conjure thee)
> drink wine.

> So that, thou mayst hear the song of the Singer
> (Mughanní), God, the Independent One (Huva’l-Ghaní)
> (Díván 906, “Ghazalyát,” no.557, v.6; Divan, “Ghazalyát” 494,
> no.479, v.6)

Óafiz. wrote a 44 verse Mathnaví entitled Mughanní Námih,
translated by Wilberforce-Clark “The Minstrel Rhyme” (Díván
993-6). Carlo Saccone, a refined Italian translator of Óafi.z’s
opera omnia, remarks: “The cantor (moghanni) is similar in his
meanings and functions to the cupbearer” (“Note” 218n1) in the
Sáqí Námih, that is, “the initiator into the mysteries of wine
and Love” (ibid. 216n1).

Sa˙ar ámad bi bistar-am Yár káy10

Shúrídih zi ‘ishq vay dil-afkár.
308                                              Lights of Irfán vol. 16

At dawn the Friend came to my bed:

“O fool for love, O broken heart,

The trope of dawn has been previously explained. In the
second hemistich the lover is described as shúrídih. This
adjective comes from shúr, a term described by Javad
Nurbakhsh (1926–2008), the Master of the Nimatullahi Sufi
Order, as: “shur ... frenzy ... a state which accompanies
excitement and sometimes out-of-self-ness, occurring to the
wayfarer on hearing God’s utterance or in the state of dancing”
(15:121). Francis Joseph Steingass (1825–1903), the German
linguist expert on Arabic, Persian and Sanskrit who authored
the most famous Persian–English dictionary, defines shúrídih as
“Disturbed; mixed; mad, frantic, desperately in love; faint,
dejected” (766), that is crazy of love according to the traditional
canons.

The image of the lover as a mad man is a typical motif of the
love language of Persian lyric poetry. Whoever accepts such a
painful feeling as love cannot be but insane, for he has
renounced the primacy of reason and decided to follow the
rules of the heart, which are quite different. ‘A††ár writes:

Love is the fire (átash) here; but reason is the smoke.

When love has arrived, reason quickly takes to flight.

Reason in the madness of love (sawdáy-i-‘ishq) is no expert:
Love is not the business of native wit. (Speech 300, lines 3346-

7; Conference 98)

Bahá’u’lláh repeatedly alludes to the madness of love in the
Seven Valleys. For example, He writes: “when the fire of love is
ablaze, it burneth to ashes the harvest of reason” (SV8); and also
“To merit the madness of love, man must abound in sanity; to
merit the bonds of the Friend, he must be full of spirit” (SV9).
He also writes: “The leviathan of love (nahang-i-‘ishq)
swalloweth the master of reason (adíb-i-‘aql) and destroyeth the

lord of knowledge (labíb-i-dánish)” (SV10; Haft Vádí 101). He
refers to this concept in the following quotations from Sufi
literature: the story of Majnún seeking for Laylí in the dust
(SV6; see also ‘A††ar, Speech 295, lines 3288-91) and the following
couplet by Rúmí:

Love’s a stranger to earth and heaven too;

In him are lunacies seventy-and-two. (SV10; FV54)11

He also mentions love as madness in the Four Valleys through
two quotations:

> Each moon, O my beloved, for three days I go mad;
Today’s the first of these — ‘Tis why thou seest me glad.

(Rúmí, qtd. in FV49)

> The story of Thy beauty reached the hermit’s dell;
> Crazed, he sought the Tavern where the wine they buy
> and sell.
> The love of Thee hath leveled down the fort of patience,
> The pain of Thee hath firmly barred the gate of hope as
> well. (Sa‘dí qtd. in FV55-6; Chihár Vádí 148)
More details on this subject may be found in Savi, Towards the
Summit 112-5.

The lover is also described as dil-afgár, defined by Steingass
as “heart-sore, heart-broken” (531), that is he is in that spiritual
condition about which Bahá’u’lláh writes: “the food (ghidhá) of
them who haste to meet Thee is the fragments (qa†a‘átu) of their
broken hearts (ikbádi-him)” (PM154, sec.92, para.1; Munáját 106).

Ay az13 baráy-am futádih bi-har sú’í,14

Vay dar ráh-am gashtih asír-i-har dyár.
310                                              Lights of Irfán vol. 16

O thou, who pinest for Me wherever thou art,

And wherever thou art, liest imprisoned for Me,

The lover suffers not only for the pains of his love, but also
for the hostility of his fellow-beings, perhaps an
autobiographical hint. Wherever he goes, he is a prisoner (asír),
a description reminiscent of other words written by Bahá’u’lláh
about Himself: “At all times He was at the mercy of the wicked
doers. At one time they cast Him into prison, at another they
banished Him, and at yet another hurried Him from land to
land” (Súriy-i-Haykal: Queen Victoria 92, sec.1, para.177). He wrote
moreover in the Kitáb-i-ˆqán: “All this generation could offer
Us were wounds from its darts, and the only cup it proffered to
Our lips was the cup of its venom. On our neck We still bear
the scar of chains, and upon Our body are imprinted the
evidences of an unyielding cruelty” (KI190, para.208).

Gah bar páy hamí píchídih15 af‘í,

Gah bar gardan-at zanjír-i-sharar-bár.

Now an asp twisted at thy foot,

Now a rutilant chain at thy neck.

Also in this distich the metaphors seems to suggest events of
Bahá’u’lláh’s life. The af‘í, “A large venomous serpent; viper;
asp; basilisk” (Steingass 84), that is the asp around His foot, could
be a hint at His many enemies within the Bábí Community, in
the first place His half-brother Ya˙yá, about whom ‘Abdu’l-
Bahá wrote:

> And still another of His trials was the hostility, the
> flagrant injustice, the iniquity and rebellion of Mírzá
> Ya˙yá. Although that Wronged One, that Prisoner, had
> through His loving-kindness nurtured him in His own
> bosom ever since his early years, had showered at every

> moment His tender care upon him, exalted his name,
> shielded him from every misfortune, endeared him to
> them of this world and the next, and despite the firm
> exhortations and counsels of His Holiness, the Exalted
> One (the Báb) and His clear and conclusive warning; —
> “Beware, beware, lest the Nineteen Letters of the Living
> and that which hath been revealed in the Bayan veil
> thee!” yet notwithstanding this, Mírzá Ya˙yá denied
> Him, dealt falsely with Him, believed Him not, sowed
> the seeds of doubt, closed his eyes to His manifest
> verses and turned aside therefrom. Would that he had
> been content therewith! Nay, he even attempted to shed
> the sacred blood (of Bahá’u’lláh) and then raised a great
> clamor and tumult around him, attributing unto
> Bahá’u’lláh malevolence and cruelty towards himself.
> What sedition he stirred up and what a storm of
> mischief he raised whilst in the Land of Mystery
> (Adrianople)! At last, he wrought that which caused the
> Day-Star of the world to be sent an exile to this, the
> Most Great Prison, and sorely wronged, and in the West
> of this Great Prison He did set. (WT4-5)

Bahá’u’lláh wrote moreover about his faithless relatives and
companions in one of His Tablets to Maryam: “O Maryam!
From the land of ˇá (Teheran), after countless afflictions, We
reached ‘Iráq at the bidding of the Tyrant of Persia, where,
after the fetters of Our foes, We were afflicted with the
perfidy of Our friends. God knoweth what befell Me
thereafter!” (qtd. in GPB118, sec.7, para.31). He wrote in another
passage: “I advance with My face set towards Him Who is the
Almighty, the All-Bounteous, whilst behind Me glideth the
serpent (˙ubáb)” (Lawh-i-Haykal: Náßiri’d-Dín Sháh 132, sec.1, para.265;
Áthár 1:85).

The sharar-bár, “raining sparks, scintillating” (Steingass 741),
that is rutilant chain could be a remembrance of the terrible

312                                              Lights of Irfán vol. 16

chains that were put at His neck in the Síyáh-Chál. He wrote
about them:

> Shouldst thou at some time happen to visit the dungeon
> of His Majesty the Sháh, ask the director and chief jailer
> to show thee those two chains, one of which is known as
> Qará-Guhar, and the other as Salásil. I swear by the
> Daystar of Justice that for four months this Wronged
> One was tormented and chained by one or the other of
> them. (ESW 77)

‘Abdu’l-Bahá describes Bahá’u’lláh’s sufferings in those days
as follows:

> ... in Mázindarán, the blessed feet of the Abhá Beauty
> (may my life be offered up for His loved ones) were so
> grievously scourged as to bleed and be sore wounded.
> His neck also was put into captive chains and His feet
> made fast in the stocks. In every hour, for a period of
> fifty years, a new trial and calamity befell Him and fresh
> afflictions and cares beset Him. One of them: after
> having suffered intense vicissitudes, He was made
> homeless and a wanderer and fell a victim to still new
> vexations and troubles. In ‘Iráq, the Day-Star of the
> world was so exposed to the wiles of the people of
> malice as to be eclipsed in splendour. (WT 4)

Ay na-khuftih yik shabí bar16 bistar-i-rá˙at,

Vay na-yásúdih damí az fitniy-i-rúzgár.

O thou, who didn’t spend a night on a bed of ease, O thou
Who didn’t find a moment of relief from the woes of the

world.

This description of the lover, sleepless and afflicted by the
travails of the world, beside meeting traditional poetical

criteria, seems a biographical reference to the ascetic life led by
Bahá’u’lláh in those days of isolation. He wrote about those
days: “Many a night We had no food for sustenance, and many
a day Our body found no rest” (KI250, para.278). And in one of
His Tablets to Maryam He wrote: “There was not a night during
which I rested in a safe place, not a morning in which I lifted
My head from My couch with ease” (“Law˙-i-Maryam” 357, v.6).
Finally He wrote in His Tablet to Náßiri’d-Dín Sháh: “How
many the nights which found the beasts of the field resting in
their lairs, and the birds of the air lying in their nests, while this
Youth languished in chains and fetters with none to aid or
succour Him!” (Lawh-i-Haykal: Náßiri’d-Dín Sháh 97, sec.1, para.187)

Zátash-i-áh-at17 kabid-i-‘álam súkht,

Vaz dard-at chashm-i-jahán átash-bár.

The heart of the world was burnt by the fire of thy wails,
The eye of the universe was consumed by the fire of thine

affliction.

The locution kabid-i-’álam súkht, that literally means “the
world burnt its liver out,” has been translated “the heart of the
world was burnt.” In the Islamic world liver is the seat of
passions, with love among them, whereas the heart is the seat of
mystical knowledge. Therefore the Persian kabid-liver
corresponds to the English heart (see Savi 107, Table 5, and 108). The
locution jigar súkhtan bar kasí is explained by Steingass as “to
feel pity for, to commiserate” (Steingass 366). Since jigar and
kabid are synonyms, kabid súkhtan has the same meaning as
jigar súkhtan. Therefore this locution could mean that the heart
of the world was moved to pity. The image of the universe
sympathizing with the lover for his pains of love is one of the
clichés of Persian mystical poetry. Bahá’u’lláh writes in one of
his Tablets to Maryam:

314                                              Lights of Irfán vol. 16

> I roamed the wilderness of resignation (ßa˙rá-háy-i-
> taslím), traveling in such wise that in My exile every eye
> wept sore over Me, and all created things shed tears of
> blood (khún-i-dil) because of My anguish (kurbat). The
> birds of the air were My companions and the beasts of
> the field My associates. (qtd. in GPB120, sec.7, para.35; in
> Ishráq Khávaríh, Risálih 367)

He also writes elsewhere: “Should any one incline his inner ear,
he would hear the cry and the wailing of all created things over
what hath befallen Him Whom the world hath wronged” (PM285,
sec.176, para.44).

Gah †awq bi-gardan chú ‘abdí18 ‘áßí,

Gah bá silsilih burdand hamí bar sar-i-bázár.

Now is placed in fetters thy neck, as if thou werest a

> rebellious
Servant, now, bound in chains, thou art hurried to the

bazaar,

Also the words of this distich seem a biographical reference
(see above). Bahá’u’lláh was repeatedly put in chains. He wrote:
“At one time I found Myself on the heights of mountains; at
another in the depths of the prison of ˇá (ˇihran), in chains and
fetters” (ESW78).

Gah ma.zlúm futádí tú19 bi-dast-i-.zálim

Gah dar sijn-i-jafá basí layl-u nahár.

Now thou art wronged in the hands of the oppressor,
Now thou spendest days and nights in the prison of

cruelty.

This distich has already been commented upon.

Az dard-at dil-i-dústán dar átash,

Vaz áh-at rukh-i-‘áshiqán tírih-u tár.

Thy pains set on fire the hearts of the friends,

Thy groans darkened the faces of the lovers.

This distich conveys concepts similar to those expressed in
verse 5. Likewise Bahá’u’lláh wrote in one of His Tablets to
Maryam: “Were thou to examine carefully the matter, the eyes
of might are weeping behind the Tabernacle of sinlessness and
the people of glory are moaning in the precincts of loftiness.
Unto this beareth witness the Tongue of truth and glory”
(“Law˙-i-Maryam” 357-8, v.8).

Chashm-at az khún yáqút bar-afshánad,

Zán gashtih hamí chashm-i-shafaq gulnár.

Thine eyes shed rubies of blood, whereby

The eye of the twilight hath turned pomegranate red.

This distich has already been commented upon.

Bá ín hamih mi˙nat kih bi-ráh-am dídí,

Sard na-gashtí-u na-nálídí zár.

After so many toils thou met in My path,

Thou doest not cool down, nor bitterly regret.

Bahá’u’lláh hinted very often at His unswerving love in His
Writings. He wrote for example:

316                                               Lights of Irfán vol. 16

> ... how numerous the days whereon I had to face the
> assaults of the peoples against Me! At one time I found
> Myself on the heights of mountains; at another in the
> depths of the prison of ˇa (ˇihrán), in chains and
> fetters. By the righteousness of God! I was at all times
> thankful unto Him, uttering His praise, engaged in
> remembering Him, directed towards Him, satisfied with
> His pleasure, and lowly and submissive before Him.

(ESW 78-79)

The originality of the description of the Beloved in this verse
has been previously commented upon (see above Love).

Az chíst kih imshab tú na-yásá’í,

Vaz chíst kih gashtih badan-at chún tár.

Wherefore art thou restless tonight? Wherefore

Hath thy body become as thin as a thread?

Sleeplessness and loss of weight are signs of love. As to
sleeplessness, according to the Sufi masters

> whenever the heart of God’s chosen one is stolen away
> by the beauty of the face of the Eternal and is burned by
> the fire of love, such a one cannot sleep at night, being
> overcome with a state of insomnia.

> The gnostic said, “The lover’s insomnia comes from the
> building up [accelerated alternation] of losing and
> finding.” (Nurbakhsh 12:9)

In this vein Rúmí writes:

> Love (‘ishq) took away sleep (khwáb) from me — and
> love takes away sleep, for love purchases not the soul
> and mind (ján-u khirad) for so much as half a

> barleycorn.    (Mystical   Poems   102,   no.119,   v.1;   Díván,
> “Ghazalyát,” no.919)

As to weight loss, Rúmí writes:

> I am like a chalice (sághar), my heart is bloody and my
> body emaciated. (Díván, “Ghazalyát,” no.478)

In this vein Bahá’u’lláh describes in the Seven Valleys “a
lover who had sighed for long years in separation from his
beloved, and wasted in the fire of remoteness”:

> From the rule of love, his heart was empty of patience,
> and his body weary of his spirit; he reckoned life
> without her as a mockery, and time consumed him away.
> How many a day he found no rest in longing for her;
> how many a night the pain of her kept him from sleep;
> his body was worn to a sigh, his heart’s wound had
> turned him to a cry of sorrow. (SV13)

This distich presents clear biographical references. It is
reminiscent of the following words by Bahá’u’lláh: “During the
days I lay in the prison of ˇihrán ... the galling weight of the
chains and the stench-filled air allowed Me but little sleep”
(ESW22).

Shab ghal†í-u píchí tú hamí bar bálín,

Ghal†ídan-u zárí20 kih gazíd-ash már.

In the night thou tossest and turnest on thy couch,

Thou tossest and groanest, as bitten by a snake.

The sleeplessness of the lover has already been explained
while commenting upon verse 11. Bahá’u’lláh uses the locution
“as bitten by a snake” in a later Writing:

318                                                  Lights of Irfán vol. 16

> God, O Muß†afá, beareth Me witness. Couldst thou be
> told what hath befallen the Ancient Beauty, thou
> wouldst flee into the wilderness, and weep with a great

(GWB118, sec. LXII, para.1)

Aknún zi-chih mí-píchí-u mí-nálí

Vaz chih paríd-at-rang21 hamí az rukhsár.

Why doest thou turn and moan, now?

Why doeth thy face turn pale?”

Like sleeplessness and weight loss, also paleness is a typical
cliché of Persian mystical poetry. Nurbakhsh explains: “The
‘pallid face [zard-i-rú’í]’ represents the suffering and anxiety
experienced on the Path” (2:89n1). He explains moreover:
“Yellowness is said to represent weakness in the travelling of
the Path” (4:53). Rúmí writes:

> In the hands of love (‘ishq) who is not pale (zard), weak
> (nazár) and thin (lághar)? (Díván, “Ghazalyát,” no.478)

And Óafi.z says:

The yellow (grief-stricken) face (rúy-i-zard), and the grief-

> stained sigh are
For lovers, the evidence of affliction. (Díván 827,

“Ghazalyát,” no.503, v.4; Diván 467, “Ghazalyát,” no.403, v.4)

Saná’í explains:

The sun is ashamed before Her beauty;
The yellowness of its face displays the pain of its heart.

(qtd. in Nurbakhsh 4:53)

Bahá’u’lláh also uses this image in other Writings. He wrote
in the Seven Valleys: “He hath bound a myriad victims in his
fetters, wounded a myriad wise men with his arrow. Know that
every redness in the world is from his anger, and every paleness
(zardí) in men’s cheeks (rukhsár) is from his poison” (SV10-1;
Haft Vádí 102). In this poem He writes:

Do You wonder about Your lover’s plight?
You’ll discover its secrets in the pallor of his face (zardíy-

i-rukhsár). (v.17)

Guftam: “Ay Yár, Ay ˇábíb-i-ján-am,

Chih ‘ajab kih22 ámadí bar sar-i-bímár.

I answered: “O Friend! O Healer of my soul!

How is it that Thou camest to this sick bed?

The lover, aware of his abasement in front of the Beloved, is
amazed by His morning visit. The Beloved’s visit at the bedside
of the lover has been explained while commenting upon verse
12\. In Sufi poetry, the Beloved is cruel, but He also is a †abíb,
“a physician, doctor” (Steingass 810), that is a healer. ‘A††ár
> bestow a remedy [darmán] upon him who is so
> sorrowful out of love. (“Il diletto degli amanti” 100, v.133)

Saccone remarks: “In Persian poetry the beloved is often called
“the healer” (tabib), the only one who finds the “remedy”
(darmân) for the pain or sickness of the lover” (“Il diletto degli
amanti” note 119n49). Saccone writes moreover in this regard:

320                                             Lights of Irfán vol. 16

> the poet-lover knows that the friend can hurt him, but
> he also is the only remedy that can heal the wounds of
> love. Therefore the beloved also wears the mask of the
> physician, in a verse reminiscent of the famous “love,
> that to no loved one remits his fee:”

> Who became a lover and did not see the beloved in his
> condition?
> O thou, I do not see any pain in thee, or else I would
> also see the healer
> ...
> In the name of God, ask one day to my healer
> When will this sick one have a nicer look?

> In conclusion, the beloved sung by Hâfez wields full
> power, he kills and at the same time quickens, makes the
> lover sick and heals him, is cruel and bloodthirsty, but
> he alone appeases the anguish of the lovers. (Maestro 216)

Bahá’u’lláh uses the metaphor of the Friend, God, as a Healer
in other Writings as well. For example, he writes in the Persian
Hidden Words: “The healer (†abíb) of all thine ills is
remembrance of Me” (no.32; Kalimát-i-Maknúnih 443). And He
turns to God in prayer saying: “O Thou Who art most dear to
the hearts that long for Thee, and the Healer (†abíb) of the souls
that have recognized Thee” (PM299, sec.178, para.9; Munáját 200).

Ay az rúy-at shams-i-samá’ mushriq

Vay az ‘ishq-at nafs-i-sukún bí-qarár.

O Thou, by Whose face the sun is enlightened in the sky,

O Thou, by Whose love the essence of peace is unsettled.

This verse has already been commented upon.

Ásmán dámán-i-gawhar zán girift

Tá kunad bar maqdam-i-‘izzat nithár.23

The sky has filled its skirt with pearls,

That it may lay it down at the feet of Thy Majesty.

This verse has already been commented upon.

Gar Tú az ˙ál-i-˙abíb-at pursí

Az zardíy-i-rukhsár shinú asrár.

Doest Thou wonder about Thy lover’s plight?

Thou wilt discover its secrets in the pallor of his face.

This verse continues the description of the sickness and
paleness of the lover of verse 13. Zard literally means yellow,
but, as Nicholson remarks, “yellow (zard) is the hue of paleness
in the East, as in Italy” (“Notes” 294nXXXVII.10). Rúmí writes in
the same vein:

Love has conquered the world, it has no colour.
But if it touches a body, that face turns yellow (zardí).

(Díván, “Ghazalyát,” no.544, v.6)

Sirr-i-dil báshad zi áh-am mushtahar

Ramz-i-ján z. áhir zi chashm-i-ashgbár.

My groans proclaim the secret of my heart;

My tears reveal the riddle of my soul.
322                                              Lights of Irfán vol. 16

The lover cannot be other but sorrowful. His groans reveal
his love, like his tears reveal the pains of his spirit. In this vein
Óafi.z writes:

To such a degree, I wept that every one who passed (by me),
When he beheld running the pearl of our tears, spake
saying: “This stream what is?” (Díván 79, “Ghazalyát,”

no.25, v.3)

Bahá’u’lláh writes in this vein: “My sighs, O my God, proclaim
the bitterness of mine anguish (balá’í), and the tears I shed
attest my love for Thee (˙ubbí)” (PM29, sec.26, para.1, Munáját 26).

Gar chih zi ‘ishq-at basí tír-i-jafá khúrdam

Ham gashtih24 asír-i-dast-i-kuffár.

In my love for Thee I received many an arrow

Of cruelty, I fell into infidel hands.

The lover hit by the cruel arrows (tír-i-jafá) of the Beloved is a
common image of Persian mystical poetry. For example Rúmí
Thou art the falconer of heaven. Hit my heart with Thine

> arrow (tír).
If Thou hittest me with thy cruel arrow (tír-i-jafá), I am

> defenceless as the earth. (Díván, “Ghazalyát,” no.1394,
> v.16)

O friend, each word Thou utterest with Thy harp
Hits my troubled heart with a hundred cruel arrows (tír-i-

jafá). (Díván, “Rubá’yát,” part. 15)

Bahá’u’lláh used this image in other Writings: “The arrows
(as-sahám) that transfix us in Thy path are the ornaments of our
temples, and the spears (rama˙) which pierce us in our love for

Thee are as silk unto our bodies” (PM217, sec.130, para.2; Munáját
146). He has “fallen into the hands of the infidels (kuffár),” or,
as He wrote in a prayer: “Thou seest, therefore, O Thou Beloved
of the world, Him Who is dear to Thee in the clutches of such
as have denied Thee, and beholdest Thy heart’s desire under the
swords (suyúf) of the ungodly” (PM38, sec.32, para.3; Munáját 32).
We may find also in this verse biographical references.
Bahá’u’lláh described in the Kitáb-i-ˆqán the tribulations that
befell Him in that period: “a number of people who have never
inhaled the fragrance of justice, have raised the standard of
sedition, and have leagued themselves against Us. On every side
We witness the menace of their spears, and in all directions We
recognize the shafts of their arrows” (KI249, para.277).

Gah bi-kashand-am bi-sar-i-kúh-u dar dasht25

Gah bi-barand-am dar ma˙∂ar-i-fujjár.

I was dragged through mountains and plains,

I was drawn in front of the wicked.

This distich has already been commented upon.

Gar gúyam án-chih bi-dídam az ‘ishq-at,

Al-battih zabán bi-mánad az guftár.

Should I tell what I saw in my love for There,

My tongue would grow weary of speaking.

Bahá’u’lláh used a similar language also in other Writings to say
that His trials are so dire that no one can describe them. For
example:

324                                                    Lights of Irfán vol. 16

> The pen (qalam) is powerless to depict and the tongue

> Thou seest what hath befallen this Wronged One
> (maz. lúm) at the hands of them that have not associated
> with Me, and who have arisen to harm and abase Me, in
> a manner which no pen can describe, nor tongue

> I beseech Thee by Him Who is Thy Most Great Name,
> Who hath been sorely afflicted by such of Thy creatures
> as have repudiated Thy truth, and Who hath been
> hemmed in by sorrows which no tongue can describe.

(PM5, sec.3, para.1)

> Thou beholdest my dwelling-place, and the prison into
> which I am cast, and the woes I suffer. By Thy might!
> No pen can recount them, nor can any tongue describe
> or number them. (PM10, sec.8, para.1)

And I cherish my pains for Thee as my own heart.

This distich does not meet only poetical exigencies, it also
expresses concepts that have been examined above: the lover is
ready to face every kind of pain and tribulation for his
Beloved’s sake.

Qa∂áy-at-rá chún ján gíram dar ághúsh,

Baláy-at-rá raván báshad kharídár.29

I embrace Thy decree with heart and soul,

My spirit yearns after Thy tribulations.

This verse has already been commented upon.

Ján rishtiy-i-˙ubb-i-Tú hamí na-gusilad,

Gar bi-burand-ash sar az khanjar-i-jarrár.

My soul won’t cut the lace of Thy love,

Should it be beheaded with a deadly blade.

The theme of this verse has been explained while commenting
upon verse 22.

Nah chunán bastam dil bi kham-i-gísúy-at

Kih shavad báz hamí tá Rúz-i-shumár.

I tied my heart to the curl of Thy tresses,

That it may not be unloosed till the Judgment Day.

The image of the hair of the Beloved is very common in
Persian poetry. Laleh Mehree Bakhtiar, an Iranian-American
Muslim author and clinical psychologist, writes:

> The hair symbolizes the Divine Essence in Its aspect of
> the Hidden, the Inward; it is the symbol of multiplicity
> which hides unity. Multiplicity conceals the non-
> existence of things and thereby veils the Heart; but at
> the same time as the hair veils, it attracts Divine Grace
> and Divine Gifts. Like the face, the hair is veiled because
> of the sacred power it holds within itself. (68)
326                                                 Lights of Irfán vol. 16

Persian poets describe the hair through several words. In this
poem Bahá’u’lláh uses the locution kham-i-gísú. The word gísú
means “A ringlet of hair, a forelock, a sidelock, curl” (Steingass
1109). Among the Sufis

> This metaphor symbolizes the way of search for Union
> and Oneness with Absolute Beauty and the Divine
> Visage, to which terms such as “the invisible world,”
> “the unbreakable chord” (‘orwat’ol wothqâ), and the
> “strong rope” (˙abl al-matin)” also allude. “And hold
> fast, all of you together, to the rope of God ...” (Koran,
> 111:103). (Nurbakhsh 1:111)

‘A††ár writes in this regard:

In expectation of the musk (mushk) shed from the locks

(gísú) which frame the sides of her face,

A hundred eyes looked eagerly upward,
fixing their gaze upon the lofty heavens. (qtd. in

Nurbakhsh1:111; Díván, “Qaßídih,” no.1, v.49)

As to the word kham, it means “Crooked, bent, twisted,
curled, curved; a curl, knot, ringlet ... that part of a noose
which encircles the neck” (Steingass 473). In the Sufi world the
locution kham-i-zulf, very similar to kham-i-gísú,

> represents a Divine mystery of an abstruse and
> enigmatic nature, encountered by the mystic on the
> Way, and which he succeeds in surmounting only after
> great hardship. In this instance, it is absolutely necessary
> that the traveller be guided by a Perfect Master, lest he
> go astray. (Nurbakhsh 1:79)

Óafiz. writes in this vein:

Thou spakest saying: “O Óáfi.z! Thy distraught heart is

where?

In the meshes of that curl of tresses (kham-i-gísú), (it) we

> have placed (Díván 700, “Ghazalyát,” no.413, v.14; Diván,
> “Ghazalyát” 379, no.365, v.9)

‘A††ár writes:

My heart (dil-am) on your tresses’ twists (zulf bi-kham)

Was caught, not just my heart,

My soul (ján) too, in the same crux
Became entangled. (Díván, “Ghazalyát,” no.253, v.1; qtd. in

Nurbakhsh 1:80)

Bahá’u’lláh uses the same locution kham-i-gísú in another poem:

Marvel not that the lover hath fallen into His snare

(kamand),
The necks of the Monarchs of the Spirit are caught in His
wavy locks (kham-i-gísú). (Bi-Jánán ján hamí dar-yáft rah,

verse 6, provisional translation by the author and Ms. Mardani)

The covenant of love that binds the lover to his Beloved is
eternal. The lover has tied his “heart to the curl of ... [His]
tresses (kham-i-gísú),” so “that it may not be unloosed till the
Judgment Day (rúz-i-shumár).” This covenant implies that the
lover entirely forgets his self, and yearns to make whatever his
Beloved wishes. Historical examples of people who betrayed
this covenant of love are, in the Christian Dispensation, Judas
Iscariot and, in the Bahá’í Dispensation, Mu˙ammad ‘Alí.

Man án nay-am kih pícham sar az ‘ishq-at,

Gar bi-kushand-am bi-damí sad hizár.30

Should I be slaughtered a myriad times,

Still I wouldn’t rebel against Your love.
328                                            Lights of Irfán vol. 16

This verse has already been commented upon.

Shab dar átash-i-gham zán31 mí-súzam,

Kih na-dídí sar-am, ay Dúst,32 hamí bar sar-i-dár.

In the night season I burn in the fire of anguish,

‘Cause my head hasn’t been, O Friend, hung on the gallows.

The theme of the gallows (dár), a sign of ignominy in the
Muslim world, is introduced in this verse. Bausani explains that
the wish to die on the gallows, that is ignominiously, for the
Beloved “is not the “redemption” or expiation or more or less
hypothetical sins in the Christian sense but is felt primarily as
“supreme ignominy” and therefore, in the metaphysical
capsizing of values, as supreme glory and joy” (Religion in Iran
279). This image falls within the malámatí vein of Persian
mystical poetry, which also comprises the image of wine and
drunkenness, immoral in the Islamic world that interdicts any
kind of alcoholic beverage.33 As to the wish to die for the
Beloved, it has been discussed while commenting upon verses 22
and 24.

Tá bí-jasad bi-bínam Rúy-at, ay A˙ad,

Bí-˙ijáb áyam bar-at, ay Kirdigár.34

I come with no veil before Thee to behold, O Almighty,

Thy face beyond any mortal frame, O Unique One.

This distich has been already commented upon.

This distich has already been commented upon.

Ay Sirr-i-Khudá, dastí az Ghayb bar ár.

The time hath come for the banner to be hoisted.
O Mystery of God! Draw forth Thy hand from the

Unseen,

Bahá’u’lláh’s discouragement as voiced in verse 30 has lasted
for just a verse. In distich 30 the Poet shows once again the
courage and strength that characterized Him throughout His
life. This distich also has strong mystical connotations. The
first hemistich is a call to revelation:

The time hath come for the banner (‘alam) to be hoisted.

The call continues in the second hemistich,

O Mystery of God! Draw forth Your hand from the Unseen

(Ghayb)
with its allusion to the white hand outstretched by Moses, that
has already been commented upon. As to the raising of His
standard, He wrote later on: “He it is at Whose bidding the
standard (ráyat) of the Most Exalted Word hath been lifted up
in the world of creation, and the banner of “He doeth
whatsoever He willeth” raised amidst all peoples” (ESW1; Law˙-i
Mubárak-i-kha†áb 1).

330                                                 Lights of Irfán vol. 16

That Thou mayest discharge the mortals from their clay,

And cleanse the mirrors of their hearts from their rust.

As the Beloved will manifest Himself to humankind, He will
discharge all the mortals (khákyán) from their clay, khák,
defined by Steingass as “Earth, dust, soil, mould, dirt ... the
earth as element; the grave; anything of little value, or useless”
(Steingass 440), or, as Bahá’u’lláh wrote later on: “He, in truth,
hath offered up His life as a ransom for the redemption of the
world” (GWB315, sec. CXLVI, para.1). He will “cleanse the mirrors
of their hearts (áyniy-i-dil) from their rust (zangár),” that is
from “the obscuring dust (ghubárát-i-tírih) of all acquired
knowledge, and the allusions of the embodiments of satanic
fancy” (KI192, para.213; KMI149). He will “cleanse the mirrors
(mirát) of ... [human] hearts from the dross of the world
(dunyá) and all that is therein, that they may reflect the
resplendent light of God” (Súriy-i-Mulúk 210, sec.5, para.57, Súratu’l-
Mulúk 52). The image of the human heart as a mirror may be
found in a number of poems by Rúmí who writes:

> The soul (ján) resembles a clear mirror (á’íniy-i-ßáfí); the
> body (tan) is dust (gard) upon it ... (Selected Poems
> 236nXIII.15; Díván, “Tarjí‘át,” no.21, v.8)

It may be also found in the Seven Valleys where Bahá’u’lláh

> A pure heart is as a mirror (á’ínih); cleanse it with the
> burnish of love and severance from all save God, that
> the true sun may shine within it and the eternal morning
> dawn. Then wilt thou clearly see the meaning of
> “Neither doth My earth nor My heaven contain Me, but
> the heart of My faithful servant containeth Me.” And
> thou wilt take up thy life in thine hand, and with infinite
> longing cast it before the new Beloved One. (SV21-22; Haft
> Vádí 113)

Ham Tú zi qayd-i-ín41 jahán bi-rahán,

ˆn jumlih muhájarín-u42 anßár.

From the shackles of this world, O Thou,

Release all these pilgrims and companions.

The divine Revelation delivers all men “from the narrow
confines of ... [their] prison in this gloomy plane” (GDM49,
para.67), releases “the necks of men from chains (salásil) and
fetters (a†náb),” and causes “them to turn, with sincere faces,
towards His face, Who is the Mighty, the Bounteous” (Súriy-i-
Haykal: Náßiri’d-Dín Sháh 133, sec.1, para.268; Áthár 1:85). As to “pilgrims
and companions” the locution has already been explained.

Bar sar-ishán nih az táj-i-qabúl43 tájí,

Bar haykal-ishán bar-band zi ˙ubb44 zunnár.

Attire their heads with the crown of acceptance,

Gird up their temples with the girdle of love.”

The first hemistich has already been commented upon. As to
the image of the crown in the first hemistich, the image “the
crown of acceptance (táj-i-qabúl)” falls within the symbolism
of royalty often associated with the worlds of God. The
Manifestation of God is often described as a Sovereign and all
such symbols of royalty, as the reign, the throne, the sceptre,
the crown, the ring, the treasuries, the court, etc., are
associated with Him. Bahá’u’lláh wrote in two of His prayers:
“O God, my God! Attire mine head with the crown of justice,
and my temple with the ornament of equity” (ESW12-13); and:
“Attire my head with the crown of martyrdom, even as Thou
didst attire my body with the ornament of tribulation before all
that dwell in Thy land” (PM20, sec.17, para.1). As to the locution

332                                                Lights of Irfán vol. 16

the “girdle of love (˙ubb zunnár),” the highest form of love is
one’s love for the Manifestation. Bahá’u’lláh wrote: “The
essence of love (˙ubb) is for man to turn his heart to the
Beloved One, and sever himself from all else but Him, and
desire naught save that which is the desire of his Lord” (Aßl-i-
Kullu’l-Khayr 155; Majmú’ih 92, para.6).

The motif of the zunnár is usually part of the malámatí vein.

Browne writes that the zunnár “(Zonarium), regarded by the
Muslim poets as the symbol of misbelief, represents the Kushtí,
or “Kosti,” of the Zoroastrians, the sacred thread of the
Brahmins, and presumably the cord worn round the waist by
Christian monks” (Literary History 3:342n1). Bausani explains that
the zunnár is “the mark of heresy non-Muslims wore” (Religion in
Iran 268). Óafiz

. specifically writes, in a malámatí vein, that he
wears the zunnár under his frock:

A darvish garment (dalq), I had; and it concealed a hundred

faults:
For wine (may) and the minstrel (mu†rib), the khairka

> (khirqih)45 was pawned; and the mystical cord
> (zunnár) (of a hundred faults) remained. (Díván 341,
> “Ghazalyát,” no.177, v.3; Díván 186, no.178, v.9)

However, Nurbakhsh writes: “In Sufi terminology, the
cincture indicates strength and steadfastness of service,
integrity of inner and outer being, adherence to the way of
certitude, and service to the Master. It also alludes to the
girdling of one’s loins in the service of God” (3:238). The Sufi
poet Mahmúd Shabistarí (ca.1288–ca.1339) writes in this vein in
his Garden of Mystery (Gulshan-i-Ráz): “The tying of the belt
signifies service and obedience” (158, v.881).

Bas kun, Darvíshá, zín bísh ma-zan nish46

Kuftád sharar hamí az ín47 guftár.

That’s enough, O Dervish, don’t torment us any longer,

‘Cause many sparks have fallen from these words.48

This poem, like others of His poems, ends with a call to
silence. The same formula, “enough (bas kun),” is also used by
Rúmí. For example, he ends a ghazal as follows:

> How long will you essay to describe Him? For He comes
> not within description; Make enough (bas kun), that I
> may ride over my commotion. (Mystical Poems 1:60, no.66,
> v.13; Díván, “Ghazalyát,” no.543, v.13)

He writes moreover:

Enough (bas kun), why are you so attached to words?
Love (‘ishq) has many expressions (bayán) that transcend

any utterance. (Díván, “Ghazalyát,” no.410, v.13)

This distich may hint at the fact that the time had not yet
arrived when He could announce His Divine Mission. And the
sentence “Many sparks (sharar) have fallen from your
discourse” may also mean that the words He had already written
and partly spread among His Sufi admirers, could have kindled
a premature fire, revealing His true identity as a Manifestation
of God in a time when people was not ready to receive the
revelation of His Word. As He later wrote, “a spark (jidhvih)
of the fire of Thy love (mu˙abbat) is enough to set ablaze a
whole world” (PM244, sec.153, para.1; Munáját 165).
