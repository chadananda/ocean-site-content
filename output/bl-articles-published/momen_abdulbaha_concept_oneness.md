Although wholly associated with the Bahá'í Faith today, it was a very difficult concept for Bahá'ís in earlier times to put into practice in their personal lives. As \`Abdu'l-Bahá travelled in the West in 1911 and again in 1912-13, He not only spoke extensively about this principle in numerous meetings but demonstrated its meaning in practical ways and challenged His followers to take up the fight against racism within themselves and their society. This paper looks at \`Abdu'l-Bahá's elucidation of the principle of the oneness of humankind in His talks in the West, primarily in the United States, and through His own actions

`Abdu’l-Bahá’s Elucidation of the
Concept of the Oneness of Humanity

During His Western Travels

Wendi Momen

The concept of the oneness of humanity in the
Bahá’í writings

The Bahá’í teachings centre on two interrelated and often
interchangeable concepts: the oneness of humanity and the
unity of humankind.

For the purposes of this paper, I take the ‘oneness of
humanity’ to be an expression of a fundamental truth about the
nature of humanity, while `unity of humankind’ is an aspiration
of the way human beings need to act so that civilization will
advance sustainably into the future.

The central teaching of the Bahá’í Faith is the oneness of
humankind.

> The principle of the Oneness of Mankind — the pivot
> round which all the teachings of Bahá’u’lláh revolve ...
> implies an organic change in the structure of present
> day society, a change such as the world has not yet
> experienced. [WOB 42-43]

The principle of the oneness of humanity is embedded in the
writings of Bahá’u’lláh.1 As a concept, it was not unknown: it is
also found in Islam.2 In the West, however, the idea was not
well developed at the beginning of the 20th century, even
among the Bahá’ís. It was `Abdu’l-Bahá in his role as the
interpreter of the writings of Bahá’u’lláh who explained to the
Bahá’ís and others what this concept meant and how they should

290                                    Lights of ‘Irfán Book Fourteen

apply it in their lives. His talks, public and private, during his
travels to the West in 1911-13 frequently expanded on this
primary Bahá’í teaching.

What `Abdu’l-Bahá did was to establish new definitions of
‘all’, ‘we’ and ‘us.’ There are many identifiers of the ‘other’:
strange faces, strange clothes and hats, strange practices and
customs, strange ideas and religion. In effect, `Abdu’l-Bahá
defined ‘all’, ‘we’ and ‘us’ in a more inclusive way and
overturned western ideas of ‘foreign’, ‘stranger’, ‘strangeness’,
‘other’, ‘enemy’.

`Abdu’l-Bahá in the West

`Abdu’l-Bahá was freed from 40 years of captivity in 1908 by
the Young Turk Revolution. In 1911 he left the Middle East for
the first time and travelled to Europe, visiting France and
Britain. His purpose was to bring the teachings of his father,
Bahá’u’lláh, to the West. `Abdu’l-Bahá made a longer and more
extensive visit to the West in 1912-13, spending eight months in
the United States, including a few days in Montreal, Canada, as
well as short visits to England, Scotland, Stuttgart, Vienna and
Budapest, with a stay of 22 weeks in Paris.

The themes of `Abdu’l-Bahá’s talks in the West were peace,
the oneness of humanity, one God, the equality of women and
men, the importance of education for everyone but especially
for women and children, the unity of religions, the need to rid
oneself of prejudices of all kinds, economic issues, political
topics such as good governance and the like. These themes are
interrelated and `Abdu’l-Bahá linked them in several of his talks.
These topics became known as the `principles’ of the Bahá’í
Faith (although there are many Bahá’í teachings not
incorporated into the list). That `Abdu’l-Bahá focused on the
social issues of the day rather than on the more ethereal and
mystical teachings which can be found in the writings of
Bahá’u’lláh and which he did address from time to time can be
attributed to the injunction of the Bahá’u’lláh “Be anxiously
concerned with the needs of the age ye live in, and centre your
deliberations on its exigencies and requirements” [GWB 213].

‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s Concept of Oneness                               291

Each of the countries visited by `Abdu’l-Bahá experienced
what today we would today call racism. It was part of the
institutions of government and business and was widespread
among individuals in their relationships with others. No country
provided full rights to all the people living in it; some denied
people the full rights of citizenship, others access to services,
still others the right to marry persons of their choice, etc. It was
common for people to demean members of different ethnic,
religious or class groups, to make fun of them or to treat them
as though they were invisible.

`Abdu’l-Bahá arrived in the West at a time of great social
change. The scientific and technological advances of the 19th
century were being played out at every level of society. Social
developments included the rise of middle classes; mass
transportation, including relatively inexpensive passage to
North America from Europe; the growth of the labour
movement; better health owing to better medicines, drains,
plumbing and nutrition resulting in a steady increase in
population; greater access to education; calls for the extension
of the franchise to women; and the transfer of Darwinian
concepts such as ‘survival of the fittest’ to a social context and
the rise of social Darwinism. The movement of people in the
19th and early 20th century — as refugees from pograms or
from poverty, as slaves or bonded servants, through
colonization — increased the diversity of many European
countries and particularly the United States. What did not
change so rapidly was the attitude of people towards those who
were ‘different’ in some way — ‘foreign’, dark-skinned, with a
different religion, disabled, poor, of a lower ‘class’, uneducated,
‘woman’.

Major challenges to the principle of the
oneness of humanity

The major challenges to the principle of the oneness of
humanity that `Abdu’l-Bahá encountered were anti-Semitism,
which was particularly rife in Europe and in the 19th century
had led to pogroms against the Jews; xenophobia, a suspicion of
foreigners of any description, again, particularly in Europe; and

292                                     Lights of ‘Irfán Book Fourteen

racism, particularly by whites towards blacks and Native
Americans in North America, a racism which was based on
colour and assumed that members of a particular race all had the
same characteristics, such as laziness. `Abdu’l-Bahá was acutely
aware of the dangerous racial climate in the United States and
warned that steps should be taken to change it.

> ... the stress and strain imposed on the fabric of
> American society through the fundamental and
> persistent neglect, by the governed and governors alike,
> of the supreme, the inescapable and urgent duty — so
> repeatedly and graphically represented and stressed by
> ‘Abdu’l-Bahá in His arraignment of the basic
> weaknesses in the social fabric of the nation — of
> remedying, while there is yet time, through a
> revolutionary change in the concept and attitude of the
> average white American toward his Negro fellow
> citizen, a situation which, if allowed to drift, will, in
> the words of `Abdu’l-Bahá, cause the streets of
> American cities to run with blood ... [CF 126]

In addition, nationalism and nationalist movements were
poised to change the map of Europe while colonialism changed
the map of the world. `Abdu’l-Bahá particularly noted the tense
situation in Europe, which he said was largely due to prejudice:

> Just now Europe is a battlefield of ammunition ready
> for a spark, and one spark will set aflame the whole
> world. [PUP 122]

> The causes of dispute among different nations are
> always due to one of the following classes of prejudice:
> racial, lingual, theological, personal, and prejudices of
> custom and tradition. [ABL 59]

By focusing in his public lectures and private discussions on the
central principle of the oneness of humankind, `Abdu’l-Bahá
directly challenged the entrenched social views — and, perhaps
more importantly — the racist behaviours of many people.
Further, he was a living example of how one could demonstrate
that they upheld the principle.

‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s Concept of Oneness                            293

The situation in Europe at the time of
`Abdu’l-Bahá’s visit in 1911-13

Anti-Semitism was rife across Europe at the time of `Abdu’l-
Bahá’s travels. France, for example, had only recently emerged
from the Dreyfus affair which had exposed the anti-Semitism
and ethnic nationalism prevalent there. Vienna was a centre of
religious prejudice and racism. Approximately two and a half
million Jews, mostly from central Europe, immigrated to the
United States between 1881 and 1924, contributing to a revival
of anti-Semitism there.3 Anti-Semitism in Germany rose steadily
through the early years of the 20th century, culminating in the
atrocities of the 1930s and 1940s.

At the time of `Abdu’l-Bahá’s visits to Britain the country
was preoccupied with the issue of Home Rule for Ireland — an
island divided by religious prejudice into sectarian camps. In
1912 unionists pledged to resist Home Rule, by force if
necessary. This issue, the partition of Ireland and the
subsequent ‘troubles’ that arose from it, are in the popular
media couched as having a religious basis but others have
suggested that they may also be seen as having a basis in race.
`Abdu’l-Bahá’s promotion of the concept of the oneness of
humanity countered both perceptions, seeing both divisions as
subsets of the basic set ‘humanity’.

At the same time, the women’s suffrage movement was very
active in the UK, with suffragettes turning more militant in
their efforts to win the vote. While disapproving of the use
violence to achieve the suffragettes’ ends, `Abdu’l-Bahá was a
strong advocate of the advancement of women and of their
enfranchisement. Again, in the Bahá’í teachings, women are half
of the ‘humanity’ that is one.

There are many indicators of the racism that was embedded
in British society at the time and that racism was promoted,
perhaps unwittingly — that is, without malice, since non-whites
were not considered ‘one of us’. For example, a popular
children’s book, The Adventures of Two Dutch Dolls by
Florence Kate Upton, had been published in London in 1895. It
told the story of two dolls in a toy shop who encountered
Golliwogg, ‘a horrid sight, the blackest gnome’, wearing ‘bright

294                                     Lights of ‘Irfán Book Fourteen

red trousers, a red bow tie on a high collared white shirt, and a
blue swallow-tailed coat’, a ‘caricature of American black faced
minstrels’,4 easily mocked. So popular was the Gollywogg
character that he became the central character in 14 further
books and was made into a similarly popular rag doll. At best,
use of this character was insensitive to the feelings of the non-
white population of Britain, where the character originated
(although it also became popular in other parts of Europe and in
the US and Australia). It may be that the racial epithet ‘wog’,
used by the British to denote foreigners, particularly from the
Middle or Far East, came from this character (although this may
also be an acronym for Western Oriental Gentleman, or
similar).5 It was this attitude of the white society that people of
a different race or nationality did not merit being treated with
dignity that `Abdu’l-Bahá challenged by giving a different
definition of what a human being is — not merely a physical
being with physical characteristics, which were more or less the
same — but divinely created, a noble being with the same
potential regardless of superficial physical characteristics.

Canada too had racist policies. For example a law denied
rights to the Chinese, even if they were citizens.6 Jews and
Native Americans were also targets of racism in Canada.

Racism and xenophobia were deeply embedded in Austria.

Austrians’ traditional dislike for specific groups such as Turks,
Serbs and especially Jews climaxed during the Second World
War. But it was in the United States, with its recent history of
the slavery of, primarily, black people, that `Abdu’l-Bahá
promoted most vigorously the oneness of humanity and was
able to demonstrate this teaching in the most dramatic ways.

Prevailing ideas of race in the West

Popular ideas about race and how a person’s colour or other
characteristics related to race were based on religious, legal,
scientific and traditional determinants.7 Among the most
pernicious were the biblical justification for slavery,
particularly of foreigners;8 the concept that developed during
the height of 18th and 19th century slave trade that black
people were cursed with the ‘curse of Ham’9 for their sins and

‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s Concept of Oneness                               295

deserved the punishment of slavery; and the idea, ostensibly
based on scientific principles and promoted by 19th-century
physicians, that people of ‘mixed blood’ — ‘mulattoes’ — were
more susceptible to disease than those of ‘pure’ blood and lived
shorter lives; and that their descendants, if the mixing of blood
continued into the next generations, would become
progressively less fertile.10

An influential proponent of what developed into 20th
century European racism was Joseph Arthur Comte de
Gobineau, whose “Essay on the Inequality of the Human Races”
(1853-1855) argued against mixing races (identified as black,
white, and yellow) and questioned whether the black and yellow
races belonged to the same human family as the white race. He
believed the white race, which he called the ‘Aryan’ and
identified with Germanic people, was superior to the other races
and that it was the white race that was responsible for the
progress and advance of civilization, so long as it remained free
of contamination by intermarrying with other races. Although
Gobineau was interested only in how social life operates, his
work was the inspiration for those who developed political
platforms from it, such as Hitler.

In the United States, popular notions of race based on
physical characteristics such as skin colour and facial features
were bolstered by a legal decision of Judge Henry St George
Tucker in Hudgins v. Wright (State of Virginia, 1806).11 The
case concerned a Virginia slave, Hannah Hudgins, who sought
freedom on the grounds that her mother was a Native American,
not black, and that Hannah herself was Native American, not
black. The Virginia Supreme Court upheld a decision in a lower
court on the grounds that as she looked ‘Indian’, she was Indian
and therefore was entitled to be considered a non-slave. Judge
Tucker’s decision reads, in part:

> Nature has stampt upon the African and his descendants
> two characteristic marks, besides the difference of
> complexion, which often remain visible long after the
> characteristic distinction of colour either disappears or
> becomes doubtful; a flat nose and woolly head of hair.
> The latter of these disappears the last of all; and so
> strong an ingredient in the African constitution is this
296                                    Lights of ‘Irfán Book Fourteen

> latter character, that it predominates uniformly where
> the party is in equal degree descended from parents of
> different complexions, whether white or Indians ...
> Upon these distinctions as connected with our laws, the
> burden of proof depends.12

Tucker deemed that because Hannah had long straight hair —
clearly the characteristic of a Native American — and not the
wooly hair of black Africans, she must be a Native American,
not a black African, and therefore entitled to her freedom. This
judgement embedded a concept of racial stereotyping within a
legal framework.

Situation of the American Bahá’í community
at the time of `Abdu’l-Bahá’s visit in 1912

When `Abdu’l-Bahá visited North America in 1912 there were
very few Bahá’ís at all on the continent13 and very few indeed
were of African-American heritage. Stockman says that by July
1908, 15 blacks had accepted the Faith in Washington DC,
owing to efforts of Pauline Hannen14 — there were about 70
Bahá’ís altogether in the city at the time15 — about 21.4 per cent
of the Bahá’í community, compared to the proportion in the
city of 28 per cent.16

Among the blacks in Washington DC at this time was Louis
Gregory, a ‘prominent black lawyer’, who became a Bahá’í in
1909 through the efforts of Carrie York, the Hannens, and Lua
Getsinger. He was president of the Bethel Literary and
Historical Society, the city’s oldest black organization, and was
able to bring the Faith to the attention of black intellectuals.
He promoted integration between black and white Bahá’ís,
writing to the Washington DC Bahá’ís deploring the segregation
of the Bahá’í community. As a result, in March 1910 the
Washington Bahá’ís began to hold racially integrated meetings
in what was a wholly segregated city in America’s South. In
1911 Gregory was elected to Washington’s ‘Working
Committee’, thus becoming the first black to serve on a Bahá’í
consultative body; in 1912 he was elected to the Executive
Board of Bahai Temple Unity.17

‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s Concept of Oneness                             297

The oneness of humankind was a very difficult concept for
Bahá’ís at the turn of the 20th century to put into practice in
their personal lives. In the United States, fraternization between
black and white races was not only frowned upon, it was
criminalized. The American Civil War of 1861-5 may have freed
black slaves but it did not change segregation laws. 38 of its 50
states had at some time ‘anti-miscegenation’18 laws19 — laws
banning interracial relationships and/or marriage which were
first introduced by several of the American colonies in the late
17th century and the last of which were repealed only in 1967.20

Even in many ‘northern’ states that had fought to free slaves,
blacks could not stay in the same hotels as whites, eat in the
same restaurants, or frequent the same clubs. Public transport
was available to both but seats were reserved for white people
and black people had to stand, or sit at the back. Tall buildings
had separate lifts for blacks and whites and interracial marriage
was illegal in a number of ‘northern’ states. Even though blacks
had been able to attend university since 1837,21 graduates were
not afforded the same jobs as whites and even if they achieved
professional status, they were excluded from society.

The Bible was used in the US to defend anti-miscegenation
laws well into the 20th century, using a racist interpretation of
stories such as that of Phinehas22 and the ‘Curse of Ham’.23

Even before he arrived in America `Abdu’l-Bahá was aware of
the damage race prejudice was causing to the country:

> One of the great reasons of separation is colour. Look
> how this prejudice has power in America, for instance.
> See how they hate one another! Animals do not quarrel
> because of their colour! Surely man who is so much
> higher in creation, should not be lower than the
> animals. Think over this. What ignorance exists! White
> doves do not quarrel with blue doves because of their
> colour, but white men fight with dark-coloured men.

This racial prejudice is the worst of all. [ABL 55]

`Abdu’l-Bahá’s application of the teaching of
the oneness of humanity in the West

It was into this society that `Abdu’l-Bahá came, bearing the
message of the oneness of humanity. A number of people —
black and white — agreed with the sentiment, as an intellectual
reality and a statement about human nature, but did not see that
it had anything to tell them about the way they lived their lives.
They might have been quite willing to accept that people of
different races should be free and should vote in elections,
should attend school as children and university as adults but
would not have considered them eligible to be friends or want
them as neighbours, nor would they have wished to have them
over to dinner or to marry their daughters. `Abdu’l-Bahá
challenged this complacency by deliberately bringing people of
different races and nationalities together and personally
revelling in the display of diversity, rather than hiding it away.
Thus, for example, he was very touched by the attendance of
different races at the meeting in Washington DC at which he
described the people as different gems. Balyuzi reports that
after this meeting, ‘He was wonderfully exhilarated’ as he
travelled to his next engagement.

> His voice could be heard, loud and clear, exclaiming: ‘O
> Bahá’u’lláh! What hast Thou done! O Bahá’u’lláh! May
> my life be sacrificed for Thee! O Bahá’u’lláh I May my
> soul be offered up for Thy sake! How full were Thy
> days with trials and tribulation! How severe the ordeals
> Thou didst endure! How solid the foundations Thou
> hast finally laid, and how glorious the banner Thou
> didst hoist.’24

`Abdu’l-Bahá acknowledged that there are differences in
humanity, differences of gender, colour, race, nationality, class,
thought, opinion, religion, language; and he encountered many
forms of social differentiation and discrimination on his travels
and was himself the target on some occasions. All these
differences he considered to be superficial and of negligible
importance.25 If they had any importance or significance, it was
to add to the beauty and diversity of the human race. Giving
inappropriate importance to any of these differences

undermines, he suggested, the full expression of the oneness of
humanity.

However, in his talks `Abdu’l-Bahá did not focus on the
particularities of these divisions but rather on the message of
the oneness itself as an antidote for all divisions and coolness
between people of different ethnicities and backgrounds.

He outlined some practical steps people could take to
develop the oneness of humankind as a lived reality. For
example, he said all people needed to remove all forms of
prejudice from their lives:

> We must banish prejudice. Religious, patriotic, racial
> prejudices must disappear, for they are the destroyers
> of human society. We must become the cause of the
> unity of the human race. [ADP 25]

> A new religious principle is that prejudice and
> fanaticism whether sectarian, denominational, patriotic
> or political are destructive to the foundation of human
> solidarity; therefore man should release himself from
> such bonds in order that the oneness of the world of
> humanity may become manifest. [BWF 247]

> If you meet those of different race and colour from
> yourself, do not mistrust them and withdraw yourself
> into your shell of conventionality, but rather be glad
> and show them kindness. Think of them as different
> coloured roses growing in the beautiful garden of
> humanity, and rejoice to be among them.

> Likewise, when you meet those whose opinions differ
> from your own, do not turn away your face from them.
> All are seeking truth, and there are many roads leading
> thereto. Truth has many aspects, but it remains always
> and forever one.

> Do not allow difference of opinion, or diversity of
> thought to separate you from your fellow-men, or to be
> the cause of dispute, hatred and strife in your hearts.26

In his very first public talk ever — on 10 September 1911,
City Temple, London — `Abdu’l-Bahá discussed this basic
teaching of Bahá’u’lláh:

> This is a new cycle of human power ... It is the hour of
> unity of the sons of men and of the drawing together of
> all races and all classes ... The gift of God to this
> enlightened age is the knowledge of the oneness of
> mankind and of the fundamental oneness of religion.
> War shall cease between nations, and by the will of God
> the Most Great Peace shall come; the world will be seen
> as a new world, and all men will live as brothers. [ABL
> 19-20]

It was an invitation to the Lake Mohonk Conference on
International Arbitration in May 1912 that ostensibly brought
`Abdu’l-Bahá to the United States:

> From the beginning, `Abdu’l-Bahá took keen interest in
> efforts to bring into existence a new international
> order. It is significant, for example, that His early
> public references in North America to the purpose of
> His visit there placed particular emphasis on the
> invitation of the organizing committee of the Lake
> Mohonk Peace Conference for Him to address this
> international gathering.27

As it was the Lake Mohonk Conference on International
Arbitration in May 1912 that brought `Abdu’l-Bahá to the
United States, it is significant to note that his talk on 15 May at
the conference was entitled “The Oneness of the Reality of
Humankind.” In his opening remarks he drew attention to the
situation 60 years previously, with the revolutions across
Europe in 1848 and the wars in Persia, describing the enmity
between the different religions and nationalities. It was at this
time, he said, that Bahá’u’lláh appeared, proclaiming the
‘oneness of the world of humanity and the greatest peace’.
Those who accepted Bahá’u’lláh’s teachings ‘were united and
attained the greatest amity and unity’ such that the ‘Kurd, the
Arab, the Persian and the Turk freed themselves from the
prejudice of race and were people agreed’. ‘Among those people

the utmost of love and oneness of peace now obtain, for the
great teachings of Bahá’u’lláh make for the oneness of the world
and for humanity, universal peace and arbitration,’ he stated.28

`Abdu’l-Bahá’s response to anti-Semitism and
xenophobia

`Abdu’l-Bahá specifically challenged prevailing ideas of anti-
Semitism, xenophobia and racism. For example, with regard to
anti-Semitism, he told members of the Temple Emmanu-El in
San Francisco:

> ... the foundation of the religion of God laid by Moses
> was the cause of their eternal honour and national
> prestige, the animating impulse of their advancement
> and racial supremacy and the source of that excellence
> which will always command the respect and reverence
> of those who understand their [particular] destiny and
> outcome.... [PUP 364]

He explained to New Yorkers that in 1870 Bahá’u’lláh had
written to the Shah of Persia advising him to ‘be kind to all his
subjects’, ‘dispense justice’, ‘make no distinction between the
religions’ and ‘charging him to deal equally with Jew, Christian,
Muslim and Zoroastrian’ and ‘to remove the oppression
prevailing in his country’.

> At that time [1870] the Jews were greatly oppressed in
> Persia. Bahá’u’lláh especially recommended justice for
> them, saying that all people are the servants of God, and
> in the eye of the government they should be equally
> estimated. ‘If justice is not dealt out, if these
> oppressions are not removed and if thou dost not obey
> God, the foundations of thy government will be razed,
> and thou shalt become evanescent, become as nothing.’
> [PUP 223]

`Abdu’l-Bahá understood why people were xenophobic but
asked them to overcome this by changing their behaviour
towards foreigners:

> Let not conventionality cause you to seem cold and
> unsympathetic when you meet strange people from
> other countries. Do not look at them as though you
> suspected them of being evil-doers, thieves and boors.
> You think it necessary to be very careful, not to expose
> yourselves to the risk of making acquaintance with
> such, possibly, undesirable people.

> I ask you not to think only of yourselves. Be kind to the
> strangers, whether come they from Turkey, Japan,
> Persia, Russia, China or any other country in the world.

> Help to make them feel at home; find out where they
> are staying, ask if you may render them any service; try
> to make their lives a little happier.

> In this way, even if, sometimes, what you at first
> suspected should be true, still go out of your way to be
> kind to them — this kindness will help them to become
> better. [PT 15]

`Abdu’l-Bahá’s challenge to racism

But it was racism, particularly colour prejudice in North
America, that `Abdu’l-Bahá focused on primarily in his western
travels. Using a variety of images and metaphors, he explained
the beauty in the diversity of humankind. He overturned age-
old concepts of racial superiority and inferiority, challenged
even the very concept of ‘race’. Further, more than merely
voicing the principle of the oneness of humanity, he
demonstrated it in his own actions, often causing consternation
or outrage among both Bahá’ís and the wider population.

The idea that ‘races’ are natural distinctions in humanity, that
there is a biological basis for distinguishing one group of people
from another determined by physical characteristics such as
colour, hair type, skin texture, the shape of the nose or eyes is
questioned today by scientists, forensic anthropologists and
others.29 The notion of ‘race’ as it is popular conceived is a
social construct yet human differentiation based these physical
features is still accepted today as a way to distinguish and

categorize groups of people, often to suppress them or to exert
power over them. At the time of `Abdu’l-Bahá’s travels in the
West this concept was very much embedded in the popular mind
as well as in social and political institutions and legal
frameworks.

In a talk at Howard University, an historically black
university in Washington DC, `Abdu’l-Bahá dismissed the idea
that there were ‘races’ of people, focusing rather on the idea
that there is only one race, the human race:

> There are no whites and blacks before God. All colours
> are one, and that is the colour of servitude to God.
> Scent and colour are not important. The heart is
> important. If the heart is pure, white or black or any
> colour makes no difference. God does not look at
> colours; He looks at the hearts. He whose heart is pure
> is better. He whose character is better is more pleasing
> ... white and black are the descendants of the same
> Adam; they belong to one household ... All humanity is
> descended from them. Therefore, in origin they are one.

[PUP 45]

At the same time, he used the language of `different races’
familiar to his hearers to explain the principle of the oneness of
humanity, drawing on what he saw as the superficial physical
differences among people to demonstrate his point.

How `Abdu’l-Bahá made his points

To discuss the issue of the oneness of humanity with western
audiences, `Abdu’l-Bahá focused on the physical characteristics
of human beings, selecting the one — colour — that was
immediately obvious to everyone and the one used by most
people to determine race, particularly for purposes of social
and other forms of discrimination. He also discussed
differences of religion, nationality and gender.

Use of metaphors

In many of his western talks `Abdu’l-Bahá used metaphors
from nature to describe the physical colour differences of
people. Always used to show the beauty of the diversity of
colours, the metaphors most frequently employed by `Abdu’l-
Bahá were flowers in a garden, leaves and fruits of a tree, waves
of an ocean, jewels and the human body.

The metaphor of flowers may be an extension of the
metaphor for the oneness of humanity found in the writings of
Bahá’u’lláh, trees: ‘Ye are the fruits of one tree, and the leaves
of one branch.’ [GWB 218]. The use of garden imagery for
western audiences was inspired. For Christians and Jews, the
garden evokes the Garden of Eden and its inhabitants, Adam
and Eve, and serves as a reminder that all people have a common
ancestry. Further, many of the cities to which `Abdu’l-Bahá
travelled were famed for their public gardens and parks — Paris,
Washington DC, London — gardens and flowers were
particularly loved by the English; and they were thus familiar to
his audiences. Thus when `Abdu’l-Bahá described how a garden
is enhanced by having flowers of different colours and shapes,
he was describing something people could understand and
appreciate and they immediately grasp his point:

> ... difference of race and colour is like the variegated
> beauty of flowers in a garden ... If all the flowers in a
> garden were of the same colour, the effect would be
> monotonous and wearying to the eye ... the various
> races of humankind lend a composite harmony and
> beauty of colour to the whole. Let all associate,
> therefore, in this great human garden even as flowers
> grow and blend together side by side without discord or
> disagreement between them. [PUP 67-69]

`Abdu’l-Bahá frequently reiterated Bahá’u’lláh’s own metaphor
likening humanity to a tree with different leaves, branches and
fruit:

> Bahá’u’lláh has addressed the world of humanity,
> saying, ‘Verily, ye are the fruits of one tree and the

> leaves of one branch.’ This signifies that the entire
> world of humanity is one tree. The various nations and
> peoples are the branches of that tree. Individual
> members of mankind are represented by the twigs and
> blossoms. Why should these parts of the same tree
> manifest strife and discord toward each other? [PUP 372]

and sometimes expanded it create not only a visual image but an
evocation of a pleasant springtime:

> All men are the leaves and fruit of one same tree, they
> are all branches of the tree of Adam, they all have the
> same origin. The same rain has fallen upon them all, the
> same warm sun makes them grow, they are all refreshed
> by the same breeze. [PT 129]

Another metaphor drawn from nature used by `Abdu’l-Bahá
was that of the ocean and its waves. Bahá’u’lláh had used this
metaphor to describe the immensity of his revelation,30 the
bounty and mercy of God,31 the vastness of God’s knowledge32
and many other characteristics of God and His revelation.
`Abdu’l-Bahá added to this catalogue by comparing the oneness
of humanity to the ocean. As he had recently spent many days at
sea, perhaps contemplating the ocean and its waves, this may
well have been in his mind when he drew on this imagery to
explain the principle to a western audience:

> Your souls are as waves on the sea of the spirit;
> although each individual is a distinct wave, the ocean is
> one, all are united in God.

> Every heart should radiate unity, so that the Light of
> the one Divine Source of all may shine forth bright and
> luminous. We must not consider the separate waves
> alone, but the entire sea. We should rise from the
> individual to the whole. The spirit is as one great ocean
> and the waves thereof are the souls of men. [PT 83]

> We must use these powers in establishing the oneness of
> the world of humanity, appreciate these virtues by
> accomplishing the unity of whites and blacks, devote

> this divine intelligence to the perfecting of amity and
> accord among all branches of the human family so that
> under the protection and providence of God the East
> and West may hold each other’s hands and become as
> lovers. Then will mankind be as one nation, one race
> and kind — as waves of one ocean. Although these
> waves may differ in form and shape, they are waves of
> the same sea. [PUP 51]

The jewel metaphor employed by `Abdu’l-Bahá was also
effective for western audiences. Jewels are beautiful, expensive,
rare, desirable and highly prized and using them to describe
human beings of different colour cast people in a new light:

> A meeting such as this seems like a beautiful cluster of
> precious jewels — pearls, rubies, diamonds and
> sapphires ... In the clustered jewels of the races, may the
> coloured people be as sapphires and rubies, and the
> whites as diamonds and pearls. The composite beauty of
> humanity will be witnessed in their unity and blending.33

For whites to hear blacks beings described as rubies and
sapphires was highly unusual — as no doubt it was for the blacks
themselves.

Howard Colby Ives records an incident involving a number
of street children who had been invited to meet `Abdu’l-Bahá.34
One was a black 13 year old boy who did not enter the room for
fear he was not invited. `Abdu’l-Bahá welcomed him in, saying
that here was a black rose. Later, when offering the children
chocolates, he picked out a very dark one and laid it against the
boy’s cheek. The other boys looked at their friend in a new light
and he himself thought of himself differently.

To Ives, who witnessed the encounter, `the scene brought
visions of a new world in which every soul would be recognized
and treated as a child of God.’

Another metaphor used by `Abdu’l-Bahá to demonstrate the
sort of unity possible among humans was the human body.
Again, this may be an extension of the image of unity provided
by Bahá’u’lláh: ‘Be ye as the fingers of one hand, the members

of one body’ [GWB 139]. `Abdu’l-Bahá’s description of the
differentiated organs and limbs of the body working together
provides his audience with perhaps the most easily understood
of all his metaphors, as everyone has a body and understands
how its different parts contribute to its functioning:

> This diversity [of races, etc.], this difference is like the
> naturally created dissimilarity and variety of the limbs
> and organs of the human body, for each one
> contributeth to the beauty, efficiency and perfection of
> the whole. [SWAB 290]

Joining of East and West

It was not only the bringing together of black and white that
`Abdu’l-Bahá addressed. In Europe, as well as in North America,
`Abdu’l-Bahá described the oneness of the peoples of the East
and the West.

> The most important principle of divine philosophy is
> the oneness of the world of humanity, the unity of
> mankind, the bond conjoining East and West, the tie of
> love which blends human hearts. [PUP 31]

> As the East and the West are illumined by one sun, so
> all races, nations, and creeds shall be seen as the
> servants of the One God. The whole earth is one home,
> and all peoples, did they but know it, are bathed in the
> oneness of God’s mercy. God created all. He gives
> sustenance to all. He guides and trains all under the
> shadow of his bounty. [ABL 38]

`Abdu’l-Bahá not only reiterated the basic oneness of all
people from both the East and the West but also encouraged
both to come together in unity, that is, to manifest their
essential oneness and to act as one people:

> I have come here with this mission: that through your
> endeavours, through your heavenly morals, through
> your devoted efforts a perfect bond of unity and love
> may be established between the East and the West so

> that the bestowals of God may descend upon all and
> that all may be seen to be the parts of the same tree —
> the great tree of the human family. [PUP 16]

Deeds, not words

`Abdu’l-Bahá exhorted people to do more than pay lip-service
to the principle to the oneness of humanity:

> Love ye all religions and all races with a love that is true
> and sincere and show that love through deeds and not
> through the tongue; for the latter hath no importance,
> as the majority of men are, in speech, well-wishers,
> while action is the best. [SWAB 69]

Thus although it is the primarily the words of `Abdu’l-Bahá’s
talks given on his journeys across Europe and North America
that were recorded, it was often the actions of `Abdu’l-Bahá
himself that made greatest and most lasting impression on
people. The Bahá’í Faith does not rely upon the recorded actions
of `Abdu’l-Bahá as a reliable guide to the truth of the
revelation, nevertheless, as `Abdu’l-Bahá was appointed by
Bahá’u’lláh as the Perfect Exemplar of his teachings, observing
`Abdu’l-Bahá’s deeds was an important way for Bahá’ís, and
others, to understand how Bahá’u’lláh’s teachings could be
implemented in their own lives. Hence there are several
accounts by eye-witnesses of `Abdu’l-Bahá’s demonstration of
the oneness of humankind.

Actions of `Abdu’l-Bahá

Demonstrating the oneness of race: Louis Gregory at
luncheon

Perhaps the primary example pointed to by Bahá’ís of
`Abdu’l-Bahá’s actions demonstrating the oneness of humanity,
the equality of all and the due regard that people should hold
for one another was the luncheon held in the rigidly segregated
Washington DC at the home of the Chargé d’Affaires for the
Persian Legation, Ali Kuli Khan, a Bahá’í, on 23 April 1912 at

which `Abdu’l-Bahá was the guest of honour.35 A number of
dignitaries were invited to the luncheon, which took place after
`Abdu’l-Bahá had spoken at Howard University on the ‘harmony
between blacks and whites and the unity of humankind’,36 and
diplomatic seating protocol was observed. Local Bahá’í Louis
Gregory, a black lawyer whom `Abdu’l-Bahá had met previously,
was not invited to the luncheon but `Abdu’l-Bahá had asked him
to attend at the home of Ali Kuli Khan prior to it for a
consultation. When the guests were called for luncheon,
`Abdu’l-Bahá went into the dining room but Mr Gregory stayed
behind. When everyone was seated, `Abdu’l-Bahá called for Mr
Gregory. While the host was seeking him, `Abdu’l-Bahá
rearranged the seating, placing Mr Gregory in the seat of
honour at his right,37 demonstrating `Abdu’l-Bahá’s disregard
for the convention that segregated blacks and white at such
occasions and providing a simple example of how unity of races
could be embedded in one’s personal life.

Demonstrating the oneness of rich and poor

It was not just a recognition of the oneness of races that
interested `Abdu’l-Bahá. He was also concerned that people
understand that the oneness of the human race extended to the
poor and indigent as well. A most telling example of `Abdu’l-
Bahá’s response to the poor living in a big city was his
attendance at the Bowery Mission on Manhattan’s Lower East
Side on 19 April 1912. He had only been in the United States for
a week, having arrived on the 11th.

The Bowery Mission was established in 1879 by the Rev. and
Mrs. A. G. Ruliffson as a very decidedly Christian mission with
the objective of assisting recent immigrants to New York City
who had not yet found adequate means to earn a living. Over
time it provided help, both material and spiritual, to the
homeless and impoverished in New York. It is the third oldest
gospel mission in the United States. New York was a centre of
immigration at this time and many of the people who lived there
were immigrants from Europe seeking a better life in the United
States — economic migrants, as they are known today — and by
definition were poor, as well as being on the bottom rung of
society. At the time the Bowery Mission catered for men only,

although there had been a well-established programme since
1894 of taking poor city children into the countryside for their
health and relaxation. Juliet Thompson states that many of the
men were alcoholics and came to the mission to get out of the
cold. The Bowery itself was a place of great deprivation and
poverty, known for its ‘down and outs’ well into the 1950s —
and was often called ‘skid row’.

It was the practice of the Mission to invite outside speakers
to preach to the men who came there and `Abdu’l-Bahá was
probably seen as simply another such. Juliet Thompson arranged
the visit.

`Abdu’l-Bahá’s talk was short and simple, apparently less than
800 words. He addressed the men as ‘my relatives, my
companions’, saying ‘I am your comrade’. He did not chide
them or call them to great things, ask to change their lives or to
transform themselves. He did not ask them to give up their
alcohol, to renounce their sins or change their ways. Rather he
told them that Jesus himself was poor, that he said ‘Blessed are
the poor’, not ‘Blessed are the rich’ and that he said he, too, was
poor and that the Kingdom of God is for the poor. He told
them they should be thankful to God that ‘although this world
you were indigent yet in the Kingdom of God you were
precious’. Some today might consider this to be patronizing,
telling the poor that their poverty is a good thing, and wonder
why `Abdu’l-Bahá would take this line. It is important, however,
to recall that the ethic of the time was very much that the poor
deserved to be poor because they lived ignoble lives. In the
popular view, just as in some of the tabloid press of today, the
poor were poor because they were lazy and stupid and had too
many children and drank too much — not because the social
environment failed to educate them, provided no safety net
when they were out of work, that there was little public
housing, that private rents were extortionate and
accommodation for the poor was crowded, unsafe, unhygienic
and precarious — tenement slums, in other words. `Abdu’l-Bahá
reversed this picture for the men of the Bowery, telling them
that

> The rich are mostly negligent, inattentive, steeped in
> worldliness, depending upon their means, whereas the

> poor are dependent upon God, and their reliance is
> upon Him, not upon themselves. Therefore, the poor
> are nearer the threshold of God and His throne. [PUP 33]

`Abdu’l-Bahá did not talk about the Bahá’í principle of
bridging the gap between extreme wealth and extreme poverty.
He did not talk about the history of the Bahá’í Faith or even
about Bahá’u’lláh, except to mention that Bahá’u’lláh himself
had been poor and that he had ‘admonished all that we must be
the servants of the poor, helpers of the poor, remember the
sorrows of the poor, associate with them; for thereby we may
inherit the Kingdom of heaven’ and that ‘God has not said that
there are mansions prepared for us if we pass our time
associating with the rich, but he has said there are many
mansions prepared for the servants of the poor, for the poor
are very dear to God.’ [PUP 33]

He ended his brief talk by praising the men at the Bowery
Mission:

> So, my comrades, you are following in the footsteps of
> Jesus Christ. Your lives are similar to His life; your
> attitude is like unto His; you resemble Him more than
> the rich do. Therefore, we will thank God that we have
> been so blessed with real riches.

Then he offered himself to them:

> And in conclusion, I ask you to accept `Abdu’l-Bahá as
> your servant. [PUP 34]

`Abdu’l-Bahá could have left it there and just gone away. But
he did not. He did not let the 400 to 500 destitute men who
heard him pass back into the city night to sleep in doorways, to
scavenge for food. Rather, having told them poverty is not an
ignoble state, he then proceeded to give them money, a silver
coin or two each — as many as five or six for the most
destitute.38 He did not ask them to buy food with it or to save it
or use it for noble purposes. He just gave it. How it was spent
was not a concern of `Abdu’l-Bahá. He gave, without
admonition or advice. Some accepted ungraciously, some with

grace;39 again `Abdu’l-Bahá was not concerned with their
response — he merely gave.

And he shook each hand. He actually touched the people he
spoke to. This small act is very significant. Many would not
have dared touch a person of the streets for fear of catching a
disease or worse. However, `Abdu’l-Bahá habitually shook the
hands of the people who came to hear him. The shaking of hands
with the priest as one leaves the church after a service is
characteristic of the Christian faith and may well have been
expected by those at the Bowery Mission. The shaking of hands
can be a symbol of equality and in this instance no doubt was
meant as such by `Abdu’l-Bahá — another example of the
oneness of humanity.

Demonstrating the oneness of women and men

I have discussed elsewhere `Abdu’l-Bahá’s articulation of the
Bahá’í teaching of the equality of women and men.40 Briefly, he
spoke frequently about this principle while in the West,
prompted in part by the issue of women’s suffrage, which was
politically and socially controversial and saw women taking
direct, often militant, action to force governments to legislate
for it. `Abdu’l-Bahá was in favour of women’s suffrage but
advised that they use non-violent means to achieve it. He also
exhorted men to recognize the equality of women and to
provide them with the educational, economic, political and job
opportunities that would enable them to progress.41 `Abdu’l-
Bahá included ‘women’ in the term ‘humanity’ and made few
distinctions between them and men, casting any such
differences as ‘negligible’.42

But `Abdu’l-Bahá did not merely speak about the teaching of
the equality of women and men, he showed how it could be
implemented within the Bahá’í community and, by extension,
within the community at large. For example, he gave significant
responsibilities to women for the initiation and management of
important developments within the religion.

Some ten years before `Abdu’l-Bahá’s visit to the West,
Chicago Bahá’ís, inspired by the laying of the corner stone of
House of Worship in Ishqabad in 1902, asked him whether it

would be possible to establish a Temple in Chicago. He wrote
two Tablets to the Chicago House of Spirituality giving his
approval. On 7 June 1903 he sent a third Tablet to Corinne
True, president of the Chicago Women’s Assembly of Teaching:

> I entreat God to assist the confirmed believers in
> accomplishing this great service and with entire zeal to
> rear this mighty structure which shall be renowned
> throughout the world ...

> Whosoever arises for the service of this building shall
> be assisted with a great power from His Supreme
> Kingdom and upon him spiritual and heavenly blessings
> shall descend, which shall fill his heart with wonderful
> consolation and enlighten his eyes by beholding the
> glorious and eternal God! [TAB 96-97]

True took this to be an assignment from `Abdu’l-Bahá,
writing to a friend, ‘He wrote me instructions about the Temple
to my utter astonishment that placed a great responsibility on
my shoulders.’43 Her response was to take the letter to the
Women’s Assembly of Teaching, which raised some money for
the Temple. However, not much progress was made until just
before True was to go on pilgrimage in 1907. She launched a
petition calling for the start of construction on the Temple,
writing to Bahá’ís all over the country. Almost 800 signatures
were collected, the petition sheets glued together by True’s
husband into a large scroll and the scroll taken to `Akka and
presented to `Abdu’l-Bahá. When `Abdu’l-Bahá received the
scroll, he gave True detailed instructions on the location and
design of the Temple and, much to her surprise and the
discomfiture of the men on the House of Spirituality, assigned
her a major role in the task of building the Temple. Thus
`Abdu’l-Bahá involved women in the most significant project of
the American Bahá’í community of the early 20th century.

Similarly, in 1920 `Abdu’l-Bahá assigned Agnes Parsons the
task of organizing ‘a Convention for unity of the coloured and
white races’.44 Parsons was a wealthy white socialite in
Washington DC who had become a Bahá’í around 1908 and
financially supported many of the prestigious Bahá’í activities.

Washington DC was the hub for Bahá’í teaching among the
African Americans but there is no evidence to suggest that she
was involved with this. Louis Gregory was assigned to assist her
with this controversial activity.

Parsons reached out to her circle of socially prominent
women to be patrons of the event and 19 agreed. She was able
to secure high-ranking speakers, including Senator Samuel
Shortridge of California, Congressman Martin B. Madden of
Illinois and Congressman Theodore Burton of Ohio. Assisted by
Gregory and a committee chosen by her, Parsons organized in
Washington DC from 19 to 21 May 1921 what was to become
the first in a long series of Race Amity (later Race Unity)
conferences to be held throughout the US.

These are among the many examples of `Abdu’l-Bahá
entrusting women with important tasks outside their apparent
areas of competence and experience and thus enabling both
women and men to see practical illustrations of his advice to
men, that they give women opportunities to achieve their
potential45 and that ‘When men own the equality of women
there will be no need for them to struggle for their rights!’46

The elephant in the room

`Abdu’l-Bahá gave many practical demonstrations of how
people might begin to appreciate and act upon the principle of
the oneness of humanity. Among the most telling of these was
his arrangement of the marriage of Louis Gregory to Louise
(Louisa) Mathews. a white Englishwoman. The ‘elephant in the
room’ at the time, that is, the one obvious issue that everyone
wished to ignore, was the question of intermarriage. In the
United States it was, as discussed above, actually illegal in 25 of
the 48 US states of the time and so this issue might not have
been so pressing as integration of meetings and activities.
However, `Abdu’l-Bahá responded to a correspondent who was
happy that progress had been made in that there were now
Bahá’í meetings for each race:

> You have written that there were several meetings of
> joy and happiness, one for white and another for

> coloured people. Praise be to God! ... If it be possible,
> gather together these two races, black and white, into
> one Assembly, and put such love into their hearts that
> they shall not only unite but even intermarry. Be sure
> that the result of this will abolish differences and
> disputes between black and white. Moreover, by the
> Will of God, may it be so. This is a great service to
> humanity. [BWF 358]

Thus even after all `Abdu’l-Bahá’s lectures about racial harmony
and the oneness of humanity and his expressions of how pleased
he was at interracial meetings, nevertheless the idea of
integration between blacks and white was so controversial and
so outside social mores of the time that very few Bahá’ís were
able to effect any change in their behaviour.

Gregory and Mathews had met while on pilgrimage in March
1911 and had been attracted to one other as friends. During
their pilgrimage `Abdu’l-Bahá had spoken about the importance
of race unity. `Abdu’l-Bahá encouraged the two to develop their
friendship and to consider marriage. In the course of the next
year `Abdu’l-Bahá continued to hint that he would be pleased if
they would marry and eventually they decided to do so. They
were married on 27 September 1912 in New York in a quiet
Church of England ceremony, the exchange of Bahá’í wedding
vows being said after the main ceremony. They were the first
interracial Bahá’í couple.

The Effectiveness of `Abdu’l-Bahá’s Efforts

`Abdu’l-Bahá spent a considerable in Europe, the United
States and Canada. He spoke to thousands of people, both in
public and in private. He was the subject of hundreds of
newspaper accounts. He was lauded and praised by clergy, lay
people, rich and poor. Yet the number of people who became
Bahá’ís was very small and the number of people who
understood his message and were prepared to act very limited.47

However, there are several indicators of the effectiveness of
`Abdu’l-Bahá’s efforts to embed a consciousness of the oneness
of humanity among both Bahá’ís and the wider society. First, he

gave them actions they could take, however small, such as
holding meeting where all races were welcome, including women
on Local Spiritual Assemblies48 and giving service to the poor.

He changed the discourse among Bahá’ís on the meaning of
the oneness and unity of humanity and refined ‘we’ (‘We must
banish prejudice ... We must become the cause of the unity of
the human race’ [ADP 25]), making oneness not just an
intellectual position but a change of one’s personal being so
that one’s behaviour towards others reflected the reality of
oneness. Further, `Abdu’l-Bahá clearly articulated the Bahá’í
position and eventually changed the behaviour of Bahá’ís. This
did not happen immediately. In Washington DC, for example,
the relationship between blacks and whites deteriorated after
`Abdu’l-Bahá’s visit, despite the presence of the Gregorys.49 In
time, however, the concept of the oneness of humanity became
not only an oft-quoted principle of Bahá’í discourse but a
feature of Bahá’í community life, activism and advocacy,
inspiring successive generations of Bahá’ís to embed this
principle into their personal lives such that today it is the
defining characteristic of Bahá’ís and their communities
worldwide.

> Can we apply the test of racial colour and say that man of a certain

> Creator? We must conclude that colour is not the standard and
> estimate of judgement and that it is of no importance, for colour
> is accidental in nature. The spirit and intelligence of man is

> merciful bestowals of God, the eternal life and baptism through
> the Holy Spirit. Therefore, be it known that colour or race is of no
> importance. He who is the image and likeness of God, who is the
> manifestation of the bestowals of God, is acceptable at the
> threshold of God — whether his colour be white, black or brown; it
> matters not. Man is not man simply because of bodily attributes.
> The standard of divine measure and judgement is his intelligence
> and spirit. (PUP 68)
