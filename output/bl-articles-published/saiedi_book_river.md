 Concealment and Revelation in Bahá’u’lláh’s
Book of the River

Nader Saiedi

Abstract

This article examines the thesis proposed by Juan Cole, based on his translation
and interpretation of Bahá’u’lláh’s S.ah.ífiy-i-Shat..tíyyih (Book of the River), that
Bahá’u’lláh did not consider himself a Manifestation of God until a short time
prior to his Rid.ván declaration and that his experience in the Síyáh-Chál in
Tehran in 1852 was not a divine revelation. It is argued that such a revision of
history is unwarranted. The text of the Book of the River is analyzed as well as
the date and context of its revelation, and it is argued that the tablet should be
viewed in terms of the dialectic of concealment and revelation that
characterizes Bahá’u’lláh’s early writings. Significant problems in translation
and interpretation are discussed, and evidence is cited from Bahá’u’lláh’s
writings confirming the reality of his revelation in Tehran and his selective
declaration of his station as the Promised One during the early Baghdad period.

Résumé
Cet article examine la thèse proposée par Juan Cole, qu’il fonde sur sa
traduction et son interprétation de la tablette S. ah. íf iy-i-Shat..tíyy ih (Le Livre de
la Rivière) de Bahá’u’lláh. Selon cette thèse, Bahá’u’lláh ne se considérait pas
comme une Manifestation de Dieu jusqu’à peu de temps avant sa déclaration
dans le jardin de Rid.ván, et son expérience dans le Síyáh-Chál, à Tehran en
1852, n’était pas une révélation divine. L’article fait plutôt valoir qu’il n’y pas
lieu de faire une telle révision de l’histoire. L’auteur analyse le texte du Livre
de la Rivière, de même que la période et le contexte dans lequel il a été révélé,
et explique que la tablette devrait être perçue à la lumière de la dialectique de
non-divulgation et de révélation qui caractérisait les premiers écrits de
Bahá’u’lláh. L’article traite de problèmes importants concernant la traduction
et l’interprétation de cette tablette, et cite des écrits de Bahá’u’lláh qui
confirment la réalité de sa révélation à Tehran et sa déclaration sélective, au
début de la période de Baghdad, de sa station de Promis.

Resumen
Este artículo examina la tesis propuesta por Juan Cole, basada en su
traducción e interpretación del S. ah. íf iy-i-Shat..tíyyih (Libro del Rio) de que
Bahá’u’lláh no se consideraba Manifestación de Dios hasta poco antes de su
declaración de Rid.ván y que lo que experimentó en el Síyáh-Chál en Tehran en
1852 no fue revelación divina. Se razona que tal revisión de la historia es
injustificada. Se hace análisis del texto del Libro del Rio como también la fecha

y contexto de su revelación y se razona que la tabla deberá ser comprendida de
acuerdo con la dialéctica de ocultación y revelación que caracteriza los
escritos iniciales de Bahá’u’lláh. Se discuten problemas de consideración en la

I  t is a fundamental Bahá’í belief that the Báb’s prophecy that the Promised

One would appear in “the year nine” was fulfilled by Bahá’u’lláh’s revelation
in the Síyáh-Chál of Tehran during Muh.arram 1269 A .H. (October 1852). It is
also generally accepted that, although Bahá’u’lláh disclosed his station privately
to a few individuals, he did not publicly announce that he was “Him Whom God
shall make manifest” until his declaration in the Rid.ván Garden in Baghdad in
1280 A . H . (April 1863). Recently, however, Professor Juan R. I. Cole
(“Commentary”) has proposed the thesis that Bahá’u’lláh may not have
considered himself to be a Manifestation of God during the greater part of the
Baghdad period and that Bahá’u’lláh’s experience in the Síyáh-Chál was not a
divine revelation. Clearly, any proposal for such a radical revision of Bahá’í
history should be expected to meet a high standard of evidence and logic before
it could be seriously entertained by anyone.

Cole’s basic argument rests on his reading of Bahá’u’lláh’s S. ah.í f i y - i -
Shat. t. íyyih (Book of the River) which Cole has translated. He maintains that in
this tablet Bahá’u’lláh denies having any “divine Cause” and therefore
Bahá’u’lláh’s claim to a prophetic station “probably should not be dated further
back than about 1859” (Cole, “Commentary”). Although acknowledging that
Bahá’u’lláh speaks authoritatively in the tablet and that the word .sah.ífih denotes
sacred scripture, Cole nevertheless suggests that at the time Bahá’u’lláh wrote
the tablet he may only have thought of himself as a “Babi Sufi shaykh” or one
among the Bábí leaders, but that in any case Bahá’u’lláh’s “self-conception
changed mightily between the early 1850s and the late 1850s” (“Commentary”).

The evidence against this thesis is so extensive and multifaceted that it is
difficult to cover it all in a single article. I will argue here that Cole’s translation
of the Book of the River contains significant errors, particularly in almost all the
points used to support the argument that in this tablet Bahá’u’lláh makes no
claim to any divine revelation. On the contrary, the Book of the River clearly
attests to the sublime station of Bahá’u’lláh and strongly alludes to the fact that
he is none other than the Promised One of the Bayán. I will also show that in
numerous tablets Bahá’u’lláh unambiguously identifies his Revelation as that
promised by the Báb to appear in “the year nine.” Likewise, in many of the
tablets Bahá’u’lláh revealed during the Baghdad period, he tells us explicitly
about his station as a new Manifestation of God. The familiar account of the

Concealment and Revelation                                                27

revelation in the Síyáh-C hál as the beginning of a new prophetic era, as
recorded in the Tablet to the Shah of Iran, is confirmed and supported explicitly
by numerous other writings.

The central misconception underlying the thesis is very similar to that of a
few other writers who contend that the Báb’s early works indicate no prophetic
consciousness and suggest that it was not until some four years after his 1844
Declaration that the Báb first began to consider himself the Qá’im and a new
Manifestation of God. It is also similar to some discussions of the early writings
of Bahá’u’lláh—such as the Hidden Words, the Four Valleys, and the Seven
Valleys—that understand those early works as reiterating typical Sufi ideas and
find discontinuity and inconsistency between the conceptual content of
Bahá’u’lláh’s early “mystical” writings and that of his later writings, such as the
Kitáb-i-Aqdas, which have a social, legal, or administrative orientation and an
emphasis on covenant.

Early Writings of Bahá’u’lláh
Those analyses, along with the theory which will be examined in this article,
have family resemblances and are all, in my opinion, based upon a
reductionistic logic which misconstrues the early and the later writings of both
Bahá’u’lláh and the Báb. 1 Although a full discussion of all these issues is
beyond the scope of this article, it can be demonstrated that Bahá’u’lláh’s early
texts are in perfect harmony with his later ones, including the Kitáb-i-Aqdas, as
well as with the principle of covenant and with all the diverse social, historical,
and legal aspects of the Bahá’í Faith. In addition, Bahá’u’lláh’s early texts, like
his later ones, can be seen to disclose a logic of discourse, a worldview, and a
spiritual and sociological insight that are not reducible to any Eastern or
Western system either in the past or in the present. The early writings of
Bahá’u’lláh, in fact, embody the same logic found in the Kitáb-i-Aqdas.
Bahá’u’lláh’s Four Valleys is an explication of an epistemology which is
neither solely mystical, legal, nor rational but the harmonious unity of all three
in a novel creative and historical framework. The Hidden Words, rather than
being solely mystical, is a discourse on covenant which includes an outline of
the new world order of Bahá’u’lláh (Saiedi “Kalimát-i-Maknúnih”).

Moreover, these early writings of Bahá’u’lláh clearly show that the
incomparable author of those texts claims the highest possible spiritual station
for himself. For instance, Bahá’u’lláh describes the Hidden Words as the “inner
essence” of all the divine revelations of the past. He claims that he understands
that inner essence of all that has been “uttered by the tongue of power and

1. Elsewhere (Saiedi “Tah.lílí”) I have discussed aspects of the Báb’s concept of gatehood, showing
the inadequacy of that approach with regard to the Báb’s writings.

28            THE JOURNAL OF BAHÁ’Í STUDIES                                        9.3.1999

might, and revealed unto the Prophets of old” (Hidden Words 3) so completely
as to be able to condense it into the brief form of the Hidden Words. Obviously
this is not just the account of a mystic’s temporary sense of holy ecstasy. It
implies a claim beyond any that could be made by an ordinary human being.
Not surprisingly, we find the same claim to absolute knowledge of divine truth
and mysteries in all the works of Bahá’u’lláh during the Baghdad period,
including the Kitáb-i-Íqán and the Book of the River.

In addition to the content of these early writings, both their style of
expression and their symbolic structure indicate the inception of a new divine
dispensation. For example, the Hidden Words is in the form of áyát, the mode
of revelation of verses in which God speaks directly, in the voice of God, to
human beings. It is the same form of language and address that characterizes the
Qur’án and the Báb’s Qayyúmu’l-Asmá. And Bahá’u’lláh, significantly, breaks
with the typical practice of the Bábí leaders, including Azal, who attempted to
imitate the Báb’s style in their writings. The new and unprecedented language
Bahá’u’lláh employs is itself a clear mark of his authority and station.

But even if (and this is a counterfactual assumption) all the early writings of
Bahá’u’lláh expressed only a language of utter humility and servitude and
rejected any claim to a unique spiritual station, that in itself would not constitute
evidence that Bahá’u’lláh did not at the time consider himself to be a
Manifestation of God. Bahá’u’lláh explains that during the Baghdad period he
sometimes revealed himself and sometimes concealed his station behind “veils”
and “clouds.” His Baghdad writings should be understood precisely in terms of
that dialectic of concealment and revelation. In fact, in the Book of the River
itself Bahá’u’lláh refers to the gradual revelation of truth in accordance with
human aptitude: “Every thing hath its storehouses with thy Lord, and He
sendeth them down as He pleaseth according to a measure from Him.”2 Any
statement which may appear to indicate servitude should be viewed in that
context: it might intentionally indicate no particular station. Yet at the same
time, the occasional use of the language of servitude is in no way incompatible
with the station of a Manifestation of God. As Bahá’u’lláh has explained in the
Kitáb-i-Íqán, the Manifestations of God speak in different ways because of their
multiple stations:

> Were any of the all-embracing Manifestations of God to declare: “I am God!” He
> verily speaketh the truth, and no doubt attacheth thereto. For it hath been repeatedly
> demonstrated that through their Revelation, their attributes and names, the Revelation

Date and Context of Revelation
It should be pointed out that Cole’s conclusion about the date of the
“emergence” of Bahá’u’lláh’s prophetic self-conception has changed.
Previously Cole had argued that Bahá’u’lláh did not make any claim or have
any conception of being the Promised One before 1862—that is, about a year
before the declaration in the Rid.ván Garden. But then he noted the undeniable
evidence that Bahá’u’lláh had in fact disclosed his station to certain individuals
at least four years before the Rid.ván declaration. However, Cole maintained his
basic position but pushed back the time of Bahá’u’lláh’s first prophetic
consciousness three years—to 1859 (Cole, “Commentary”).

However, that clearly shows that Bahá’u’lláh’s writings after 1859 employ
exactly the same language and express exactly the same message as his earlier
writings, a fact that is logically compatible with the generally accepted Bahá’í
view of the early Baghdad period. In that case, the Book of the River should be
read in terms of the same logic of wisdom and the dialectic of concealment and
revelation which is present in all Bahá’u’lláh’s writings of this period.

The question of the date and context of revelation of the tablet is crucial for
evaluating Cole’s commentary on the tablet. He dates the writing of the Book of
the River to 1857, around the time Bahá’u’lláh wrote the Hidden Words. But all
we really know is that in the Book of the River Bahá’u’lláh quotes one of the
Hidden Words. Cole has reasoned from this that the two works were written at
about the same time: “It quotes a Hidden Word, No. 1 of the Arabic (but with
the grammatical difference that the plural imperative is used, whereas in the text
of the Hidden Words we now have the grammar is singular). My guess is
therefore that it was written around 1857 shortly before Bahá’u’lláh put the
Hidden Words into final shape” (“Commentary”).

But in fact, Bahá’u’lláh could have written this tablet years after the Hidden
Words, anytime between 1859 and 1863—namely, during the period in which
we know that Bahá’u’lláh had already privately declared his station. The
reasoning in the above statement appears to be based on the assumption that
because Bahá’u’lláh quotes from the Hidden Words but with a slight difference
(a plural instead of a singular), therefore it must have been written around the

30            THE JOURNAL OF BAHÁ’Í STUDIES                                             9.3.1999

time he wrote the Hidden Words but before the text was fixed in “final” form.
In other words, if the tablet had been written after the text of the Hidden Words
was fixed, he would have quoted from the “final” form. But if that were true,
then Bahá’u’lláh’s tablet to Nás.iri’d-Dín Sháh, which was revealed about ten
years after the Hidden Words, should also have been revealed at the same time
as the Hidden Words. In that tablet Bahá’u’lláh also quotes from the Hidden
Words with variation in wording—once using a different beginning, another
time with a singular form instead of the plural that occurs in the “final” text
(Bahá’u’lláh, Áthár-i-Qalam-i-A‘lá 1:73). The fact is that Bahá’u’lláh does
sometimes reveal the same revelation in different forms in his writings.

Although we do not know the precise date of the Book of the River, given the
fact that Bahá’u’lláh does quote from the Hidden Words (and as we will see, he
actually indicates that it is taken from that book), it is more reasonable to infer
that the tablet was revealed after the Hidden Words, sometime between 1858
and 1861. In this way the Book of the River is similar to the Kitáb-i-Íqán, in
which Bahá’u’lláh also quotes from the Hidden Words (although without any
mention of the source), and again with slight change of expression.3 Therefore it
is likely that the Book of the River was revealed within the same period which
even Cole has acknowledged as the time of Bahá’u’lláh’s prophetic
consciousness.

Although we do not know the precise date when the tablet was written, we do
know something about the context of its revelation. In a long tablet written
around 1861 (Mázandarání, Asráru’l-Áthár 5: 312–44), Bahá’u’lláh informs
us about his relation to the Bábí community in the period between 1856 and
1861\. Based on this tablet we know that, as early as 1856, there was a serious
debate within the Bábí community concerning Bahá’u’lláh’s station. Many of
the Bábís had noted Bahá’u’lláh’s extraordinary spiritual and moral authority
and some even perceived that he was the Promised One of the Bayán. This
caused considerable envy and opposition on the part of some of Bahá’u’lláh’s
enemies, who threatened to kill his supporters and even prohibited other Bábís
from traveling to Baghdad. At this time Bahá’u’lláh’s enemies were accusing
him of rejecting the Báb, his Mirrors, 4 and the Bayán. In response to this
agitation, for a few years Bahá’u’lláh discouraged some of his Bábí followers
from making the pilgrimage to Baghdad, eventually allowing visits around
1859\.

It is in this context of confusion, rumors, accusations, and animosity that
Bahá’u’lláh wrote the Book of the River in response to the questions of a Bábí
named Javád (probably Javád-i-Káshání, who became a Bahá’í), who asks

used the translation of the passage as published in TheHidden Words (see Kitáb-i-Íqán 228).

Bahá’u’lláh about rumors of miracles that had been attributed to him and to
other prominent Bábís. From Bahá’u’lláh’s response in his tablet, it becomes
clear that Javád considers miracles extremely important as justification of
Bahá’u’lláh’s spiritual authority and even feels miracles to be a necessary
demonstration of divine power—to force the powerful and learned leaders of
humanity to recognize and submit to the Cause of God. He has trouble
understanding how divine dominion can be present when no miracles have
occurred.

The Book of the River
In the Book of the River, Bahá’u’lláh concisely and sublimely explains a
universe of complex spiritual truth. After rejecting the rumors about specific
miracles that had been attributed to him, he discusses the question of miracles in
a multidimensional way. First he emphasizes the fact that in the sacred
scriptures, particularly in the Bayán, the supreme proof and testimony of the
Manifestation of God is the revelation of verses. Consequently, the only
relevant question concerning the truth of Bahá’u’lláh’s claim involves the
revelation of verses and not the production of miracles. However, Bahá’u’lláh
immediately rejects the rationalist position on miracles as well. The rationalists
take human reason as the supreme standard of judgment and reject the
possibility of miracles by the Prophets in the past because miracles are
contradictory to reason. At this point, Bahá’u’lláh engages in a complex
metaphysical and epistemological analysis. He argues that the rationalistic
denial of the possibility of miracles is false because “human reason is not a
sufficient standard” for understanding any natural phenomenon within the
complex reality that is God’s creation. It is not only strange, unnatural displays
of power by the Prophets which are miraculous. In fact, he states, “all
phenomena, as things endowed with power, are also miracles of God.” The
miraculous nature of all reality transcends the limits of human reason. Human
reason is incapable of comprehending any phenomenon independent of
experience and observation. If it were not for that actual experience and
observation, human reason would not believe in the existence of any
phenomenon. If the rationalist argument for the rejection of miracles attributed
to the former Prophets were true, then the reality of all natural phenomena must
be rejected as well.

The rationalists’ materialistic deductions are based on their forgetting the
miraculous nature of all reality. After actual observation and experience, reason
takes for granted all the wonders of natural phenomena and reduces them to
necessary rational truths capable of deduction through rational analysis. In this
mechanistic methodology, the rationalists contrast the “irrationality” of
miracles, the existence of God, and the possibility of revelation to the “rational”
character of “ordinary” natural events. Bahá’u’lláh affirms the necessity of

32            THE JOURNAL OF BAHÁ’Í STUDIES                                 9.3.1999

empirical experience for knowledge precisely in order to emphasize the
miraculous and divine origin of all reality. All of reality testifies to the truth of
God and His Manifestations.

The implications of this analysis are indeed far-reaching. Bahá’u’lláh
emphasizes the poverty of a mechanistic conception of nature, unveils the
spiritual foundations of science, affirms the symbolic character of all reality,
and defines all beings as embodiments of the creative Word of God. This,
however, means that some of the miracles attributed to the Prophets could also
be real even if they may seem improbable to the eye of reason.

Bahá’u’lláh next rejects the rationalist argument that the miracles attributed
to the Prophets of the past could not possibly be true because life at present
seems to be without miracles. The rationalists argue that if miracles happened in
the past, they should be happening now as well. Bahá’u’lláh emphasizes the
dynamic character of life and asserts that the absence of miracles in the present
does not imply the impossibility of their occurrence in the past: “For how often
have events occurred in the past which have not occurred in the present, and
vice versa.” As a counterexample, he refers to the periodic occurrence of
epidemics:

> Consider, for instance, that every thirty years, according to the calculation and
> reckoning of men, there is an outbreak of plague in some lands. Could it be argued
> with disbelief during the delay of an outbreak of plague that no plagues have occurred
> in the past, since otherwise it must happen now? The same is true of other events that
> have occurred before but are not happening at present, and vice versa.

However, the most important point about miracles is that they are not
necessary proof of the claim of the Manifestation of God. It is the Word of God
itself which is the supreme testimony of God and conclusive demonstration of
His power. Bahá’u’lláh decides to unveil different aspects of this and many
other questions by using the analogy of the river (shat..t). Divine revelation is
like a great river which inundates the land: “When its waters swell and flood, it
rusheth forward and moveth turbulently. Whatever it doeth, it remaineth within its
own sovereignty. However much the helpless people cry out from every side—
clamoring that a great dam hath been rent asunder, or a barrier obliterated, or
houses destroyed, or a palace crushed to ruins—the river payeth them no heed.”

The mighty river is just and universalistic. It deals with all in the same way.

The divines and sovereigns are not singled out for special favors: “With the
utmost force and compulsion, power and sovereignty, it continueth to rush and
flow, touching all places equally. For instance, before the onrush of its power it
doth not matter whether a building belongeth to a prince or to a pauper; the
effect is the same, unless that building hath unique fortifications.”
Like the river’s natural cycle of ebb and flood, revelation occurs in a

Concealment and Revelation                                           33

“natural” way, according to fixed laws. The miracles desired by people would
involve an unnatural interruption in the natural course of divine revelation. If
the river’s course were artificially changed, then some dry lands would be
irrigated but many others would be destroyed and far more negative
consequences would result.

This analogy unveils the mystery of divine decree (qad.á) and destiny (qadar)
as well. The details of this issue are elaborated in other writings of the Báb,
Bahá’u’lláh, and ‘Abdu’l-Bahá.5 Human action is the product of the active
interaction of divine effulgence and human free choice and reception. The sign
of divine power becomes manifest in all things in accordance with their own
stations and aptitudes. The Word of God is the embodiment of divine justice.
Both the faith of the faithful and the rejection of the rejectors, including the
powerful and the exalted, are part of divine wisdom and God’s universal justice.
The divine river actualizes the hidden tendencies of the different beings and
radically tests all things.

Bahá’u’lláh identifies the reason for the differences in reception and
recognition in the differing capacities of the recipients:

> Each person speaketh and expresseth himself according to that which is reflected
> within him. For example, with reference to the same analogy of the flooding river,
> observe that it floweth forward in one manner and its relationship to all buildings and
> structures is the same, yet any valley that hath more capacity is able to take in more of
> it, and any dam whose foundation is weaker is less able to resist it. . . . In like manner,
> consider the rays of the Eternal Sun, which shine with the same illumination in the
> heaven of human hearts but, when reflected in the forms of mirrors, differ by reason
> of differences among the mirrors themselves. Thus it is that some abide exalted in
> their essences and high in their endeavors, while others sink into the depths of lethargy
> and degradation. All things have their rank before God, and all return unto Him.

The cycle of the river’s ebb and flood becomes a metaphorical vehicle to
describe the principle of progressive revelation as well. “[I]n every age and
century, as He desireth, the Unique Hidden One and the Eternal Essence
manifesteth that true River and real Sea and causeth it to flow, adorning it with
a new temple and a new vesture.” But whenever a new Manifestation appears,
people cling to their vain imaginations and fail to recognize the supreme Object
of their expectation. “With utmost desire and thirst they drown and perish,
lacking even the faintest awareness that they could quaff a draught thereof.”

Bahá’u’lláh warns Javád not to allow the sayings of the people to prevent him
from recognizing the Divine Beauty, refers to belief in “the Most Exalted
Countenance” and recognition of “His station as manifested after Him on the

Throne” as sufficient “above any other knowledge or deed,” adding that “His
good pleasure and faith in Him” is dependent upon “obedience unto His
command in all things,” This, he says, is the “fruit of existence.” Bahá’u’lláh
concludes the tablet by quoting the first of the Arabic Hidden Words.

Bahá’u’lláh’s Claim to a Cause
I will now analyze Cole’s translation of the Book of the River and the
deductions based on it in light of the tablet itself. In his commentary on the
tablet, he says:

This work is the clearest indication I know of Baha’u’llah’s self-conception before
> about 1859, when he appears to have begun telling people like Fitnih and Nabil-i
> Akbar that he was the Promised one. Denis MacEoin pointed out in his 1989

> point, and my rereading it now in conjunction with my translation convinces me that
Denis is right. He has no “iqbal bar amri,” is making no claim to have a divine Cause.

This work gives us a humanist Baha’u’llah, who sternly denies being able to work

> us a catechism that includes belief in God, the Bab, Quddus, and the “Living

The most important strand of the argument is based on the perception that
Bahá’u’lláh has stated in the tablet that he makes no claim to any divine cause.
This is Cole’s translation of the passage in question:

> If it were not for fear of the hidden chains in the breasts of the people, I would have
> continued to mirror forth all divine parables and subtleties of the celestial laws with
> reference to the very flowing of this physical river. But what shall I say? I make no
> claim to a Cause. (“Book of the Tigris”)

The expression used by Bahá’u’lláh here (as it appears in the version of the
tablet used by Cole) is: “ Valákin c hih gúyam kih hí c h iqbál bih amrí
nadáram.”6 Although he translates this as: “But what shall I say? I make no
claim to a Cause,” not only does Bahá’u’lláh say no such a thing here, he says
nothing remotely close to it. What Bahá’u’lláh says is:

6. Cole incorrectly quotes the original as “bar amrí” instead of “bih amrí.”The more accurate
version of the tablet has “Valákin chigúnih míshavad kih híchiqbál bih amrí nadáram.”

> Were it not for fear of the malice hidden in the hearts, I would have assuredly
> unveiled all the inmost divine analogies and all the subtleties of the heavenly
> principles with regard to the course of this outward river. Yet, alas, I am disinclined to
> approach any matter.

In other words, he has no desire to discuss the issue in question in detail. This is
no case of ambiguous meaning. Bahá’u’lláh has used a common polite Persian
idiom which indicates reluctance or disinclination to approach an issue or
engage in a task. From the text it is absolutely clear that the “issue” or “task”
(amr) in question is nothing but the act of speech, writing, and exposition of
Bahá’u’lláh’s spiritual knowledge through the metaphor of the river. It is just
before this statement, in the same paragraph, that Bahá’u’lláh makes the claim
that he is able to unveil all spiritual mysteries and all divine truths just through
the metaphor of the river! However, because of the “malice hidden in the
hearts” of the people surrounding him, he does not wish to divulge all those
mysteries. Obviously, this is indeed a clear indication of Bahá’u’lláh’s self-
conception at the time he revealed the tablet. The passage, in other words,
alludes powerfully to the fact that Bahá’u’lláh is the Manifestation of God. It is
worth noting that in his later writings, Bahá’u’lláh affirms that his ability to
unveil all spiritual truth through one single metaphor is itself an indication of
his exalted station (Iqtidárát 71).

The beginning of the phrase, “Yet, alas,” or literally, “What can I say?”
(Valákin chih gúyam), also idiomatic, is not a literal confession of having
nothing to say but an expression of reluctance to say something that one in fact
does know. It conveys disappointment and sorrow, but Bahá’u’lláh is not
expressing sorrow that he has no claim to any divine cause! Rather, he is
expressing sorrow because he cannot disclose his real station, reveal his ocean
of knowledge, and impart his inner secret because of the climate of hostility and
the low spiritual level of the people around him.7 This becomes even clearer
when we note that Bahá’u’lláh speaks of the “anguish and sorrow” that have
afflicted him “in these days.” His disinclination to complete the task of
unveiling all spiritual truth through the metaphor of the river is due to the
conditions that prevail in these days.

There is absolutely no word equivalent to “claim” or to “having a claim”
here. It is true that the word amr is also sometimes used for “cause,” but that is
only one of the possible uses of amr and not the primary meaning of the term.
But it is not even a possible meaning in the expression in question. In its
primary sense, amr (meaning any event, matter, affair, issue, task, topic, etc.) is

7. That meaning is evident in the more accurate version of the tablet, which instead of “Valákin
chih gúyam” has “Valákin chigúnih míshavad.”

36           THE JOURNAL OF BAHÁ’Í STUDIES                           9.3.1999

used by Bahá’u’lláh—that is, not as “divine cause”—in numerous cases in
his writings.

In many of Bahá’u’lláh’s later tablets, he also writes that the hatred in the
hearts of the people has prevented him from revealing tablets or unveiling all
spiritual truth in his tablets. He also frequently uses a similar phrase to express
his lack of desire to discuss particular issues. For instance, in one of his later
tablets he says that he has discussed the techniques of the alchemical elixir in
his Adrianople tablets because of his followers’ frequent requests, but that
otherwise he himself has no wish to discuss these issues. His exact words are:
“Vaillá Qalam-i-A‘lá . . . iqbál bih dhikr-i-ín umúr nadáshtih va nadárad”
(Ishráq Khávarí, Má’idiy-i-Ásmání 1:19). In this sentence, both key terms of the
statement in the Book of the River—iqbál and umúr (plural of amr)—occur.
But if we were to translate this sentence as Cole translates those terms in the
Book of the River, it would give us the self-contradiction: “otherwise the Most
Exalted Pen makes no claim to utter these divine Causes.” Clearly, Bahá’u’lláh
is simply saying that the Most Exalted Pen has no desire to discuss these issues.
There is also no doubt that the latter statement was revealed years after
Bahá’u’lláh’s public declaration of his station.

An interesting point is that, in a paragraph prior to the passage in question,
Cole treats another occurrence of the word iqbál in a completely different way.
He translates the passage as follows: “Clearly, before the mind had perceived
such a thing, it would not have accepted anyone’s description of it” (“Book of
the Tigris”). But while iqbál is translated as “a claim” in the controversial
sentence, it has been entirely omitted from the translation of this passage. And
in fact the word “claim” would make no sense there. In both sentences iqbál
means “inclination.” In the above instance Bahá’u’lláh actually has written:
“Certainly, human reason would not be inclined to accept the possibility of the
existence of such a thing by means of any rational definition or description
without actual observation and experience” (emphasis added).

In the Kitáb-i-Íqán Bahá’u’lláh uses a similar expression with iqbál to convey
the same meaning, namely that he has no inclination or desire to do something.
Discussing Karím Khán-i-Kirmání’s book, Bahá’u’lláh writes: “Har chand ín
‘abd iqbál bih muláhiz. iy-i-kalimát-i-ghiyr nadáshtih va nadáram,” meaning:
“Although we never felt disposed to peruse other people’s writings” (Kitáb-i-
Íqán 185). Siyyid Káz.im-i-Rashtí also uses such an expression frequently in his
Persian book Majma‘u’l-Asrár, saying that since he has already discussed the
topic in his previous writings, or since he is tired and ill, he has no iqbál to a
lengthy discussion of the issue. He frequently says, for example, “alán iqbál bih
dhikr-i-án nadáram,” meaning: “right now I have no wish to mention that
issue.”8 This reading of the expression as used in the Book of the River is

8. See, for example, Majma‘u’l-Asrár 44, 56, 274, 314.

confirmed by another passage at the end of the tablet, where Bahá’u’lláh writes
that he has revealed the tablet solely out of his love for Javád, “Otherwise, I
have no inclination to set forth any topic, or write a single letter thereon.”

But that expression is not the only mistranslation in the passage. It is not
“chains” that are hidden in the breasts but hatred. However, it has apparently
been assumed that the word aghlál is the plural of ghull (chain). But here aghlál
is being used as the plural of the Arabic word g hi l l (rancor, malice, or
animosity). Mug hi l l, from the same root, means a person who is spiteful,
deceitful, and bears malice and ill will. Bahá’u’lláh frequently uses the terms
ghill and mughill in his tablets to describe the state of his enemies’ hearts.9 In
this phrase Bahá’u’lláh creates two plurals not found in standard Arabic—
aghlál as the plural of ghill and as.dár as the plural of .sa d r (heart). Note that
creating new words and derivatives was one way in which the Báb declared his
supreme authority as the Manifestation of God. However, what is indisputable
is that in this context Bahá’u’lláh is not talking about chains but animosities in
the hearts. The mistranslation makes it more difficult to understand
Bahá’u’lláh’s reference to his state of disappointment and his forced silence.

With that crucial information and the correction, now when we read the entire
paragraph it becomes absolutely clear what Bahá’u’lláh is talking about in this
passage:

This is especially true if the Eastern Winds begin to blow upon the flood of this
> heavenly river, which is rushing forth from the North of divine unity. How many
> exalted souls and possessors of true understanding, how many mighty castles and firm
> lofty edifices, will be destroyed and perish. By Him Who holdeth the heavens by His
> might and moveth the oceans by His command! Were it not for fear of the malice
> hidden in the hearts, I would have assuredly unveiled all the inmost divine analogies
> and all the subtleties of the heavenly principles with regard to the course of this
> outward river. Yet, alas, I am disinclined to approach any matter. On account of the
> intensity of My anguish and sorrow, in these days I am sore tried between the Gog of
> silence and the Magog of utterance. I beseech God to send down an Alexander who
> will raise an insurmountable barrier.

Here Bahá’u’lláh is saying that although he possesses perfect knowledge of all
divine mysteries, and although he can describe all of them through a single
metaphor, he is forced to conceal these truths and practice wisdom (that is, the
principle that words must be uttered with “due regard unto the exigencies of the
occasion and the people” [Bahá’u’lláh, Tablets 172]). He is in between silence
and speech: the surging of his spiritual truth urges him to expression and

38         THE JOURNAL OF BAHÁ’Í STUDIES                           9.3.1999

effulgence, while the hostile disposition of the people around him makes him
reluctant to disclose those inner truths. In fact, this passage testifies not to
Bahá’u’lláh’s rejection of any divine claim but the exact opposite. Here he lays
claim to the same absolute knowledge as he does in the preface to the Hidden
Words. While he is making a claim to absolute divine knowledge, he is also
affirming that he is intentionally concealing it out of prudence because the
people are unready to bear it, and he offers hope that in the future, divine
assistance will pave the way for a full declaration of his station.

Alexander the Great
One additional element which should not be missed in this connection is
Bahá’u’lláh’s reference to Alexander. According to the Qur’ánic story (Súrih
19), Alexander the Great (Dhu’l-Qarnayn) was the agent of divine deliverance
from the hostile tribes of Gog and Magog. Immediately following the reference
to Alexander, Bahá’u’lláh tells us that he has just made a secret allusion to an
immensely important concealed truth: “Hidden allusions are concealed within
these verses and holy letters are treasured up within these words. Blessed is the
one who hath seized these pearls, recognized their value, and attained the
presence of their Supreme Meaning.” His secret allusion is to something
wonderful but concealed. The allusion to Alexander as the agent of deliverance
from Gog and Magog suggests the proximity of his own declaration, one which
resolves the problem of concealment and makes possible the complete
revelation of his spiritual truth.

As we have now seen, the passage that has been used to argue that
Bahá’u’lláh at that time did not think of himself as a Manifestation of God is
saying exactly the opposite. It affirms that Bahá’u’lláh possessed absolute
divine knowledge yet also was forced to be silent and withhold unveiling his
inner truth. Bahá’u’lláh’s expression of sorrow for his state of concealment
because of the immaturity of the people recalls the statement in his tablet of
visitation for Imám H.usayn in which he speaks of the forced separation between
“h” (há’) and “e” (váv) due to Imám H.usayn’s sorrow (Majmú’iy-i-Alváh. 205).
On the basis of the writings of Shaykh-Ah. mad-i-Ah.sá’í and the Báb, it may be
argued that “h” refers to the loving creative Word of God, and “e” to the
essences and receptivities of the contingent beings. The incapacity of the latter
to receive the former means the delay of spiritual creation and of the inception
of a new divine Spring. The Book of the River confirms decisively the Bahá’í
conception that the Baghdad period was one of concealed revelation, half-way
between speech and silence.

It should be noted that Cole’s translation of the tablet actually contains a
number of other problems. For instance, Bahá’u’lláh quotes the Qur’ánic verse
“Va man as.daqu mina’lláh hadíthan?” (“And whose word is more true than
God’s?”), which Cole translates: “And whose [sic] believes a word from God.”

In another place, Bahá’u’lláh’s imperative construction in “Ponder and reflect
[Fikr va tadabbur nimúdih], that haply all the hidden mysteries may be freed
from the veils of nearness and remoteness” is translated as a third-person past
tense: “It [the pen] pondered and thought about the river”—and the rest of the
sentence is given the wrong tense to make it consistent with that mistake,
obscuring the fact that Bahá’u’lláh is here urging Javád to grasp the
monumental truth just imparted to him in the parable of the river. Elsewhere,
Bahá’u’lláh’s statement: “Similarly, ponder upon the mysteries of divine decree
[qad.á] and destiny [qadar]. Whatever hath appeared or will appear is like this
river,” becomes translated as: “In the same way, consider the foreordained and
predestined mysteries—what has appeared and shall appear,” thus losing the
point that Bahá’u’lláh is speaking about the specific question of the mystery of
qadar or destiny mentioned in the Four Valleys and other writings. However,
translation errors that do not play a major role in Cole’s commentary on the
tablet will not be pursued here.

Miracles as Evidence
According to Cole’s reading of the Book of the River, Bahá’u’lláh denies being
a Prophet; instead, we are told, this tablet “gives us a humanist Baha’u’llah,
who sternly denies being able to work any miracles, who defers humbly to the
Mirrors of the Babi dispensation.” To further support this conclusion Cole adds:
“Indeed, the argument seems to be made that just as plagues no longer break out
in Iraq every 30 years as they had in past centuries . . . after the Bab’s death the
age of miracles is over with. This is in turn an announcement of a profound
secularization of sorts, isn’t it?” (“Commentary”).

However, there is absolutely nothing in Bahá’u’lláh’s tablet indicating that he
is unable to work miracles. Bahá’u’lláh begins by referring to specific rumors
that had been circulating and says that they are not true: “Of the miracles
mentioned, those which are ascribed to this humble one are fabrications
contrived by impostors” (Ánchih az z. uhúrát-i-mu‘jizát kih dhikr shud ánchih
nisbat bih ín h.aqír ast kidhbun iftaráhu’l-mukdhibún). It is obvious here that
Bahá’u’lláh is in no way saying that he has not performed any miracle, nor is he
saying that he is unable to work miracles. He is simply rejecting the rumor that
he has performed the specific miracles Javád has asked about. But purely
hypothetically, even if Bahá’u’lláh had denied performing any miracles, it does
not follow that he was denying he was able to perform miracles. The equation
of the two is invalid.

But we are offered a stronger, although also invalid, inference. Cole argues
that in the example of thirty-year cycles of plague, Bahá’u’lláh is rejecting the
possibility that miracles will occur at all after the Báb. But that inference is
unwarranted on three counts. First, the issue being discussed is not whether in
the future miracles will or will not happen, but whether the accounts of miracles

40             THE JOURNAL OF BAHÁ’Í STUDIES                                    9.3.1999

attributed to former Prophets were true or not. Bahá’u’lláh is saying that if those
same miracles are not happening right now, that does not mean that they did not
happen in the past. As we saw before, Bahá’u’lláh’s passage is a rejection of the
rationalist denial of miracles in the past. Second, in the example of thirty-year
cycles of plague, Bahá’u’lláh is not saying that plague will never break out
again. He explicitly talks about the “delay” in its occurrence. In other words,
there will be outbreaks of plague again, but not necessarily in intervals of thirty
years. Concerning miracles, therefore, Bahá’u’lláh seems to be saying that
previously miracles have indeed happened even if they are not being repeated in
the present day, and that in the future miracles can still happen, just as plague
can still break out!

But in Cole’s translation of this section, all reference to the delay of the
plague has been omitted:

Now, some argue that if the miracles attributed to past prophets are true, then they
> must appear now, as well. But this argument is unworthy of the consideration of
> illumined minds and pure hearts. It is quite frequently the case that affairs occurred in
> the past that no longer occur today, and vice versa. . . . For instance, every thirty years
> as you count and reckon, in some countries a plague epidemic used to break out. Can
> this interval be disputed? And can it be denied that no such thing has recently
> occurred? Otherwise, many other things should also occur nowadays that used to take
> place but do not, and vice versa. (“Book of the Tigris”)

Third, Bahá’u’lláh is not even talking about the non-occurence of miracles
altogether in the present. At the beginning of the tablet, he has confirmed the
truth of the—presumably recent— miracles attributed to the Bábí Mirrors.
However, even if he had spoken of a complete absence of miracles in the
present, that in no way implies there could be no miracles in the future. Again
the inference is invalid. Baha’u’llah is arguing that history is dynamic and that
we cannot deduce either the past or the future from the conditions of the
present. Therefore, Bahá’u’lláh is not talking about the inability to perform
miracles, the impossibility of present miracles, or the impossibility of future
miracles. The interpretation of the tablet as evidence that Bahá’u’lláh advocates
a humanist or secularist doctrine on the grounds that the tablet rejects the
possibility of future miracles is not supported by the text itself. Furthermore,
one has to remember Bahá’u’lláh’s acceptance of Mullá H. a s a n - i - ‘ A m ú ’ s
challenge, in the later Baghdad period, to perform a miracle provided that those
who asked for it accepted his claim afterward.10 In fact, in Bahá’u’lláh’s later
writings, his message with regard to miracles is exactly the same as his message
in the Book of the River. On the one hand he attests to his ability to perform

10. Recounted in Gleanings 131–32.

miracles (and refers to the fact that his companions have witnessed
extraordinary events in his presence), 11 while at the same time he does not wish
his followers to engage in attributing various miracles to him because his station
is higher than that of mere miracle worker. In any case, miracles are not the
standard of divine truth, and he does not wish to open a door to rumors and
misrepresentations.

Of course the word secularization is somewhat ambiguous and it is beyond
the scope of this article to discuss it. But Bahá’u’lláh’s dismissal of miracles as
evidence is not due to exclusion of the spiritual from the material realm. On the
contrary, Bahá’u’lláh intends to create a form of consciousness and civilization
in which all aspects of life are mirrors of divine attributes. Bahá’u’lláh’s tablets
and statements revealed in Baghdad, such as Panj Kanz (Five Treasures), 12
clearly show that he intends to spiritualize—not secularize—the life of the
people of the world. He dismisses the relevance of miracles precisely because
his intention is to educate humanity so that its life will reflect a systematic
integration of spiritual principles, and to direct its gaze toward the revealed
words of God. This fact is even evident in the Book of the River, where
Bahá’u’lláh rejects the rationalist arguments by emphasizing the spiritual and
miraculous nature of all reality. The fact is that Bahá’u’lláh’s vision cannot be
adequately described in terms of the current labels of secularization and non-
secularization, but that is a different topic. In Epistle to the Son of the Wolf, one
of his last tablets, Bahá’u’lláh writes:

> Mine aim hath ever been, and still is, to suppress whatever is the cause of contention
> amidst the peoples of the earth, and of separation amongst the nations, so that all men
> may be sanctified from every earthly attachment, and be set free to occupy themselves
> with their own interests. We entreat Our loved ones not to besmirch the hem of Our

> regarded as miracles and prodigies to debase Our rank and station, or to mar the purity
and sanctity of Our name.

12. Panj Kanz is not strictly a tablet but consists of statements of Bahá’u’lláh recorded by Nabíl-i-
A‘z. am. The Persian text is found in ‘Andalíb 10.40 (Fall 1991): 10–13. Excerpts in English are
quoted in Taherzadeh, Revelation of Bahá’u’lláh 4:140–43.

42         THE JOURNAL OF BAHÁ’Í STUDIES                           9.3.1999

As we can see in this passage, Bahá’u’lláh asks his followers not to attribute
rumors of miracles to him, in exactly the same way that he rejects the rumors of
miracles in the Book of the River. Indisputably, in the ‘Akká period Bahá’u’lláh
did consider himself both a Manifestation of God and capable of performing
miracles.

But in fact, in the Book of the River Bahá’u’lláh discusses miracles precisely
in order to establish that he is a Manifestation of God. If Bahá’u’lláh had
written nothing other than this tablet, it would have been sufficient evidence
that he claimed to be a Manifestation of God and the Promised One of the Báb.
But to see that point, one must note that here Bahá’u’lláh is dealing in subtle
ways with one of the ordinances of the Persian Bayán.

A Mysterious Paradox
If one reads the tablet carefully, a mysterious paradox becomes evident. On the
one hand Bahá’u’lláh denies the specific miracles rumored of him, yet he engages
in a lengthy analysis concerning the present time, the evidence and justification
of his own authority, and the irrelevance of miracles to justify his truth.

Now why does Bahá’u’lláh differentiate himself from the Báb and the
Mirrors of the Báb at the beginning—affirming the miracles attributed to them
while denying those ascribed to himself? And why does he continue to justify
his legitimacy without dependence on any miracle? If he is an independent
Manifestation of God, he must offer evidence and proof. But he is not an
ordinary Bábí leader like any of the Mirrors. Even the Mirrors could perform
miracles, but none of them could reveal verses. In the Persian Bayán the Báb
has explicitly and frequently stated that no one else except the Báb and Him
Whom God shall make manifest can reveal verses. Because verses are the only
legitimate evidence, no Bábí is allowed to report and attribute miracles to the
Manifestation (Persian Bayán, váh.id 6, ch. 8). Bahá’u’lláh distances himself
from the “miracle talk” because he is affirming in a subtle way that his own
station is far beyond that of any miracle worker. His refusal to report miracles
for himself while admitting them for the Báb and the Bábí Mirrors indirectly
indicates that he is initiating a new revelation and affirming his own authority
and station as the Manifestation of God. Since the Promised One has appeared
in his own person, it is the rumors of miracles attributed to himself that
Bahá’u’lláh rejects. Here, the appearance of humility is the secret of
Bahá’u’lláh’s sovereignty.

If we look at the other writings of Bahá’u’lláh, this issue becomes much
clearer. In the Kitáb-i-Badí‘, revealed in Adrianople, Bahá’u’lláh responds to
the objections and accusations of the Bábís against his claim to be the Promised
One of the Bayán. Repeatedly he emphasizes that his enemies among the Bábís
have always tried to insist on miracles, and not the revelation of verses, as the
proof of the Promised One. In fact they had to argue for the insufficiency of

revealing verses as proof because otherwise they would have had to accept
Bahá’u’lláh’s claim. Bahá’u’lláh, however, demonstrates that the Báb has made
it clear in all his writings that the only evidence of the Báb’s station is his
ability to reveal the verses of God, and that the same would constitute the sole
evidence of the Promised One (Kitáb-i-Badí‘ 347–50). We can now understand
the reason why Bahá’u’lláh in the Book of the River refuses to accept the
relevance or necessity of miracles, rejects the rumors of miracles about himself,
and emphasizes instead the revelation of verses as the true divine standard.

And yet, in the Book of the River, even while Bahá’u’lláh rejects the relevance of
miracles for his authority, he implicitly identifies himself as the source of all
miracles. He writes: “If anything else appeared from the mine of bounty and glory
[Bahá], that was but a token of God’s grace.” Here again, the apparent “humility”
at the beginning of the tablet is nothing less than the mysterious evidence of
his exalted station. It is in a beautiful way the fulfillment of the Imám’s
statement that “Servitude is a substance the essence of which is Divinity.”

Bahá’u’lláh’s discussion of miracles has a parallel in the Báb’s insistence that
he should not be judged in terms of the literary rules and conventions of
scholars and grammarians because his own station is far superior to the makers
of those rules and traditions. Bahá’u’lláh himself is surprisingly generous in
accepting as true all the miracles attributed to any famous Bábí, even while he
differentiates himself from all of them. He is so generous because he is really
saying that miracle making is no extraordinary feat! His gracious affirmation of
the miracles attributed to various Bábí Mirrors is most interesting. It suggests
that Bahá’u’lláh did not wish to provide a pretext for disunity and conflict
within the Bábí community by denying the miracles attributed to prominent
Bábís, even while at the same time he affirms his superior authority over all of
them.

In addition to indicating that many can perform miracles but the revelation of
divine verses is the unique ability of the Manifestations, he refers to Qur’ánic
passages to the effect that all created beings are truly the miracles of God. Since
a great number of Qur’ánic statements affirm the miraculous nature of all
things, Bahá’u’lláh very likely does not intend reference to any one specific
verse but indicates the general meaning of those numerous verses on this theme.
Of all miracles, the greatest and most amazing is the creative act of God, Whose
Word brings all reality into being—and this ability belongs only to the Primal
Will. Here, Bahá’u’lláh implicitly equates himself with God’s creative act. His
evidence and justification is the same as God’s supreme miracle: the creation of
the world and the revelation of a new spiritual reality.

To see more clearly this mysterious paradox of Bahá’u’lláh’s tablet, let us
consider these five related points.

1. In his justification of his own station, Bahá’u’lláh asserts that the same
thing that the Bábís accept as true with regard to the Báb’s Bayán applies to

44           THE JOURNAL OF BAHÁ’Í STUDIES                                         9.3.1999

Bahá’u’lláh as well. Javád has asked why God does not reveal His might so that
the Cause of God would be rendered victorious and the believers would be
uplifted and exalted. Bahá’u’lláh answers that “this is indeed true in the same
way as thou dost affirm it with regard to the Bayán” (Bimithl-i-má antum fi’l-
Bayán tant.iqún). That is, just as the Báb’s revelation disclosed an absolute
divine majesty and yet only the spiritually mature recognized it, in the same
way Bahá’u’lláh’s revelation at the present time is magnificent and most
powerful in itself, but this does not mean that all can recognize and believe in
him.

However, Cole has translated Bahá’u’lláh’s reference to the Bayán literally,
resulting in a meaningless redundancy. He renders the passage: “Indeed this is a
truth, the like of which you speak forth in utterance” (“Book of the Tigris”). But
the Bayán Bahá’u’lláh mentions here is not just any utterance; it is the Book
and Revelation of the Báb. By missing Bahá’u’lláh’s reference to the Bayán and
the Báb’s evidence—a reference establishing a clear parallel with Bahá’u’lláh’s
evidence13—the translation has made it more difficult for the reader to see
Bahá’u’lláh’s majestic language and his claim in this tablet.

The context of the phrase makes its meaning clear. Bahá’u’lláh first refers to
Javád’s argument that divine power requires a demonstration of its dominion
over all people, and then he confirms that statement by saying that this is correct
in the same way that you affirm it with regard to the Bayán. But if Cole’s
translation were accurate, then Bahá’u’lláh’s confirmation of the statement
would make no sense—because he has just explained that miracles are not
necessary proof of divine dominion. Javád’s statement is not accurate in the
way that Javád asserts it; it is only accurate when the Báb’s divine dominion
and majesty is seen as being expressed in the Bayán itself.

In the Kitáb-i-Íqán Bahá’u’lláh addresses a similar question as posed by the
maternal uncle of the Báb concerning the nature of divine sovereignty.
Bahá’u’lláh explains that “by sovereignty is meant the all-encompassing, all-
pervading power which is inherently exercised by the Qá’im whether or not He
appear to the world clothed in the majesty of earthly dominion,” his “spiritual
ascendancy which He exerciseth to the fullest degree over all that is in heaven
and on earth, and which in due time revealeth itself to the world in direct
proportion to its capacity and spiritual receptiveness” (Kitáb-i-Íqán 107–8).
That sovereignty and power is present in the divine words themselves: “Hast
thou not heard how with one single verse He hath sundered light from darkness,
the righteous from the ungodly, and the believing from the infidel? . . . So
mercilessly trenchant was this wondrous sword of God that it cleft asunder

13. Bahá’u’lláh uses the same form of expression frequently in discussing the book of the Bayán.
See for example, Gleanings 149.

every relationship! On the other hand, consider the welding power of His
word,” which “fused and blended” former enemies “through their allegiance to
this wondrous and transcendent Revelation” (Kitáb-i-Íqán 111–12).

2. Bahá’u’lláh’s river metaphor is a reference to his own divine revelation and
his own verses. His claim to be the Promised One of the Bayán is clearly visible
in the paragraph in which he speaks of the unprecedented and unusual surging
of the divine river at the present time. The flooding of the river, as Bahá’u’lláh
explicitly says in the tablet itself, is a symbol for the appearance of a new
Revelation. At this very moment, he says, the divine river is “rushing forth from
the North of divine unity” (shumál-i-ah.adíyyat), and is stirred by “the Eastern
Winds” (aryáh.-i-sharqíyyih)—terms which have multiple symbolic meanings
related to the revelation of the Primal Will.

Another subtle expression of Bahá’u’lláh’s station is his mention of the
hidden allusions concealed in his words and his praise of those who have
understood them: “Blessed is the one who hath seized these pearls, recognized
their value, and attained the presence of their Supreme Meaning.” Here, the
meaning of the word becomes the same as the being of Bahá’u’lláh himself.

3. Bahá’u’lláh’s concluding statement in the tablet is a subtle reference to his
own station as the Promised One of the Báb: “Glory be upon those who believe
in Him on the day of His meeting and who observe what He hath decreed.” The
word “glory” (Bahá) is used here in a significant way in reference to the
expectation of the Promised One. A full explication of this question is
impossible here, but in sum: in the Bayán, the Báb made it clear that “Bahá” is
the title of the Promised One. We also know that Bahá’u’lláh signed many of
his Baghdad tablets as “Bahá” and he began his Hidden Words with “Huva’l
Bahíyyu’l-Abhá” (He is the Glory of Glories). That in itself is a subtle and
concealed declaration.

4. After disclosing wondrous spiritual truths through the use of the river
metaphor, Bahá’u’lláh tells Javád to “ponder and reflect” so that the “hidden
mysteries” may become disclosed to him; to “[r]ecognize this Sea of Seas”
compared to which all others are like a drop; and to observe “how it surgeth
within the Wellspring of its own blessed Essence and the mine of its own
attributes.” Then he directs Javád to thank God for teaching him knowledge
“through the tongue of the Manifestation of Thyself and the Wellspring of
Thine Essence, He Who is the Fountainhead of Thy Cause and the Repository
of Thy Decree.” Given the fact that it was through Bahá’u’lláh that the analogy
of the river became the vehicle for all knowledge, it becomes clear that by the
“Sea of Seas” Bahá’u’lláh is referring to himself and is identifying his tablet as
the revelation of the Manifestation of God. The reference to the “Sea of Seas”
surging “within The Wellspring of its Own blessed Essence” is again probably a
reference to his concealed station.

Likewise, a most beautiful and powerful declaration of his true station is
46         THE JOURNAL OF BAHÁ’Í STUDIES                              9.3.1999

visible in the subtle equation of the river of revelation with the movement of his
Pen. After discussing the river as the symbol of divine revelation, Bahá’u’lláh
describes his unveiling of the river analogy as the onrush of the Pen. In other
words, the movement of his Pen is the same as the river that dispenses the water
of divine revelation.

5. Another implicit reference to Bahá’u’lláh’s majestic station can be found
in his quotation, in the tablet, of the first Arabic Hidden Word: “Possess a pure,
kindly and radiant heart, that thine may be a sovereignty ancient, imperishable
and everlasting.” He states that this passage is taken from the essence of the
holy Books (that is, the Hidden Words). He also expounds the special
significance of this particular command, calling it “a treasure that pertaineth to
Heaven,” “a light that shall never be extinguished, a treasure that perisheth not,
a raiment that shall never be outworn, and a revelation that will never be
concealed.” Moreover, he refers to it as the “All-Encompassing Word”
(kalimiy-i-jámi‘ih)—a clear reference to the revealed Word of God embracing
all spiritual truth. He tells Javád to “preserve” this counsel “if thou desirest to
find a path to the Lord of the Mighty Throne.”

A more subtle declaration of Bahá’u’lláh’s station is evident in the fact that
he is here using “All-Encompassing Word” to describe not only his revealed
Word in the Hidden Words, but also his own being as the Manifestation of God.
In the writings of both the Báb and Bahá’u’lláh, the title “All-Encompassing
Word” is applied to both the Manifestation and his Revelation.

The significance of mentioning this particular statement from the Hidden
Words becomes apparent through a careful comparison with the Kitáb-i-Íqán
and the Kitáb-i-Badí‘. In these texts Bahá’u’lláh outlines the preconditions of
the spiritual search to recognize the Manifestation of God for the age. He calls
upon the seeker to renounce all preconceived ideas and conditions, and to
recognize the Manifestation through the Manifestation himself. In other words,
one should not take human understandings of the previous words of God, or the
conceptions of the scholars, as the standard by which to judge the authenticity
of divine revelation. In the Book of the River, after rejecting people’s notions of
miracles as a standard for recognizing divine revelation, Bahá’u’lláh quotes this
Hidden Word, which emphasizes the principle of sincerity of heart, as a concise
epistemological principle which is the true “path” leading to recognition of the
Manifestation of God.

Bahá’u’lláh as the Living Countenance
Bahá’u’lláh’s reference in the Book of the River to the “Living Countenance”
(T.al‘at-i-H

. ayy) is a reference to none other than himself. The title has a complex
meaning and is an implicit claim to be the Promised One of the Bayán.
However, the assumption that one should consult the Bábí literature to find out
what Bahá’u’lláh means by the “Living Countenance” is a methodological

mistake. It is only in the writings of Bahá’u’lláh himself that we can find the
explanation of what he means by “Living Countenance.” In this passage he writes:

Today, every soul who believeth in the Most Exalted Countenance, and recognizeth
> with certitude His station as manifested after Him on the Throne, this shall sufficeth
> him above any other knowledge or deed. But His good pleasure and faith in Him
> cannot be realized except through obedience unto His command in all things. This is
> the greatest, most excellent, and consummate fruit of existence. There is no goal
besides God and no end save Him. . . .

[W]ith a swordlike tongue sing and chant in ringing tones, clap and drum, that there
> is no God but Him, that ‘Alí Muh.ammad is the Essence of God and His eternal Being,
> and Muh.ammad ‘Alí is the Mine of the Cause of God and His everlasting Self, that the
> Living Countenance is the Repository of God’s authority and His self-subsisting
> Identity, and the Letters of the Living are the first to have believed in God and His
> verses. We all, verily, cleave unto them.

If we examine the passage, we can see that the Báb is called “the Most
Exalted Countenance,” followed by an immediate reference to “His station as
manifested after Him on the Throne” which indicates the return of the Báb after
his martyrdom in the form of a new “Throne.” In addition, Bahá’u’lláh speaks
here of the Living Countenance as a person different from the Báb and from
Quddús. The meaning of the title “Living Countenance” becomes obvious from
the Báb’s and Bahá’u’lláh’s writings: the Living Countenance refers to the
return of the Báb (who is the Most Exalted Countenance), but after his own
martyrdom, and in a living form. This is clearly a reference to the famous
statement of the Báb: “Verily, I am He that liveth in the Abhá Realm of Glory!”
(Innany ana h. ayyun f i ’ l - u f u q i ’ l - A b h á), a statement quoted frequently by
Bahá’u’lláh. In other words, the Living Báb, or the Living Countenance, is
“Abhá” (Bahá).

A clear parallel with the statement in the Book of the River can be seen in one
of Bahá’u’lláh’s tablets in which he interprets the Qur’ánic statement “We
strengthened the two by the third.” In that tablet Bahá’u’lláh first states: “Thus
doth the Tongue of God proclaim to all beings that verily I am He that liveth in
this Horizon which hath in truth been manifested, Who among the Concourse
on high hath been named the Most Exalted ‘Alí [the Báb], and Who in the cities
of Names beareth the glorious name of Abhá [Bahá’u’lláh].” Here we can see
that Bahá’u’lláh is affirming the identity of the Báb and Bahá’u’lláh, and
defining the latter as the living manifestation of the former. After that,
Bahá’u’lláh interprets the Qur’ánic statement by saying: “Verily, the first
Whom We sent down in truth was ‘Alí. We, verily, made Him shine forth from
the horizon of Fárs [Shíráz] . . . and the other whom We sent down was also
‘Alí and We called him among the Concourse on high by our name Quddús . . .
and We strengthened both of them by this Beauty Who hath appeared, shining

48            THE JOURNAL OF BAHÁ’Í STUDIES                                           9.3.1999

above the the horizon of Command with manifest dominion” (Ishráq Khávarí,
Rah.íq-i-Makhtúm 2:104–6; provisional translation).

But the more interesting point is that Bahá’u’lláh himself in the Tablet of All
Food (Lawh.-i-Kullu’t. -T.a‘ám), revealed in the first year of Bahá’u’lláh’s arrival
in Baghdad, before the Book of the River, explicitly identifies the Living
Countenance as both Quddús and Him Whom God shall make manifest! Given
the high station of Quddús, and his being the last of the primary “Unity”
(Váh.id) of the Bábí dispensation,14 he is also the representative of the Báb in
the Báb’s lifetime. However, after the martyrdom of the Báb, the Living
Countenance can be only the next Manifestation, who will be “living in the
horizon of Abhá.” In the Tablet of All Food, Bahá’u’lláh interprets the
enigmatic verse in the Qur’án: “All food was allowed to the children of Israel.
. . .” (3:93). After interpreting it in several different ways, he tells the addressee
that were he to wish to interpret this verse from today until the day of
Mustagháth, the Day in which people arise for the new Living Countenance, he
would assuredly be able to do so by virtue of that which God has conferred
upon him by His bounty and grace. Bahá’u’lláh explains this by saying that the
Mystery of Unity has moved and the Ocean of eternity billowed and the
Countenance of Light shone forth in the Heavens of ‘Amá’ from the right side
of the Tree of Revelation in these matchless days of the Revelation of the Sun,
and yet, people do not recognize its majesty. A few paragraphs later,
Bahá’u’lláh speaks of the cruelty surrounding him and says that if Quddús, who
was the Last Point and the Living Countenance, were alive, he would be
saddened and would weep at seeing Bahá’u’lláh’s sufferings (Ishráq Khávarí,
Rah.íq-i-Makhtúm 2: 416–26).

In the Book of the River, Bahá’u’lláh is already affirming the advent of the
Báb, Quddús, and the Living Countenance. Given Bahá’u’lláh’s concept of the
Living Countenance, this can only mean that Bahá’u’lláh, emerging from the
Abhá horizon, is the Promised One of the Bayán. Interestingly, the Báb makes
the statement regarding his living in the horizon of Abhá in a tablet addressed to
Yah. yá Azal. To understand the complexity and beauty of this statement it
should be remembered that Yah.yá was one of the Mirrors. According to both
the Báb and Bahá’u’lláh, a mirror has no significance by itself. It becomes the
recipient of light only when it turns toward the sun; at that moment, all the most
excellent names and attributes of God are reflected by and thus pertain to the
mirror. However, the moment that the mirror turns away from the sun, it
becomes darkened and deprived of all those names. The Báb is telling Yah.yá
that his titles are valid as long as Yah. yá turns toward the Báb, and that

14. In this context “Unity” (Váh.id) refers to The Primal Point and his eighteen Letters of the
Living—Quddús was the last of the Letters of the Living.

afterward the Báb will continue to be manifest in the Realm of Abhá Glory.
Therefore, as long as Yah.yá is obedient to Bahá, he will retain all his titles;
otherwise he will turn into nothing. Bahá’u’lláh’s reference to the Living
Countenance in conjunction with the Báb is therefore a subtle but clear
reference to Bahá’u’lláh as the return of the Primal Point, the Sun of Truth.
Furthermore, not only is the title “Living Countenance” not a reference to
Yah.yá Azal but, on the contrary, it is an affirmation that Yah. ya’s station is
subordinate to Bahá’u’lláh.

In many of his writings, Bahá’u’lláh uses this same statement of the Báb to
prove that he is the return of the Báb in the form of Bahá. For instance in the
Kitáb-i-Badí‘ He writes: “If the people of the Bayán had the necessary insight,
the blessed verse of the Báb, ‘Verily, I am He that liveth in the Abhá Realm of
Glory!’ would have been sufficient unto them and unto all that dwell in heaven
and on earth” (227; provisional translation). He emphasizes the same idea in
other parts of that text as well (219–20, 348).

The Book of the River is not an ordinary text. As Bahá’u’lláh himself
testifies, divine mysteries and secrets are hidden in this short tablet, which is
characterized by the dialectical tension between expression and silence. The
result is a magnificent work of symbols and metaphors which affirm the exalted
station of Bahá’u’lláh in a beautiful, majestic, and yet concealed way.

Bahá’u’lláh’s Reference to His 1852 Revelation
Throughout his writings, Bahá’u’lláh frequently and explicitly affirms that he
received a revelation in the year nine in the Síyáh-Chál, and that he declared his
station as the Promised One of the Bayán to certain individuals during the early
Baghdad period. Of course, Bahá’u’lláh’s statement in the Tablet to the Shah of
Iran is a well-known and clear testimony concerning the beginning of his
Revelation in the Síyáh-Chál:

“O King! I was but a man like others, asleep upon My couch, when lo, the breezes
> of the All-Glorious were wafted over Me, and taught Me the knowledge of all that
> hath been. This thing is not from Me, but from One Who is Almighty and All-Knowing.
> And He bade me lift up My voice between earth and heaven, and for this there befell
> Me what hath caused the tears of every man of understanding to flow.” (Epistle 11)

Although this is sufficient evidence in itself, Cole insists that here Bahá’u’lláh
is simply reporting a spiritual experience calling him to reform the Bábí
community. It is curious that this most explicit statement should be termed
ambiguous. In it Bahá’u’lláh speaks of the “breezes of the All-Glorious”—a
clear mystic symbol of revelation—and he describes the experience as the
instantaneous knowledge of all that hath been! Similarly, the statement in the
Súratu’l-Haykal dealing with the same experience completely settles the

50            THE JOURNAL OF BAHÁ’Í STUDIES                                   9.3.1999

issue.15 However, Cole, in discussing his own interpretation of the Book of the
River, suggests that the tablet

> raises the most acute questions about the nature of the “intimation” Baha’u’llah is said
> to have experienced in the Siyah Chal. If one reads the account in Epistle to the Son of
> the Wolf carefully, it appears that it consisted more of ilham or inspiration than of
> wahy or revelation, and that Baha’u’llah began thinking of islah or reform of Babism
> rather than of making any claim of his own. (“Commentary”)

But in fact, Bahá’u’lláh has explicitly used the term wahy (vah.y) and not ilham
with regard to his Síyáh-Chál experience. In another tablet, Bahá’u’lláh gives
the same account of the experience in different words and adds that this is
already mentioned in the Tablet to the Shah—obviously he means the same
account of what happened in the Síyáh-Chál. However, here he uses the word
vah.y. Bahá’u’lláh says:

> By God! Verily I was asleep, when lo! the breezes of Revelation [vah.y] bestirred
> Me. I was silent, and thy Lord, the Almighty, the All-Powerful, caused Me to speak
> forth. Were it not for His behest I would not have revealed Myself. Verily, His Will
> prevailed over My will and raised Me up to establish a Cause which hath made Me
> the target of the darts of the infidels. Read what We have revealed to the kings that
> thou mayest be assured that this Servant speaketh as bidden by the All-Knowing,
> the All-Informed. (Majmú‘iy-i-Alváh. 234; provisional translation)

It should also be noted in this connection that Bahá’u’lláh uses the same
concept and same wording in the Kitáb-i-Badí‘, which was written at the end of
the Adrianople period—the same period as the revelation of the Tablet to the
Shah—to discuss his station explicitly as the Manifestation of God and the
Promised One of the Bayán. These repeated statements of Bahá’u’lláh clearly
show that the statement in the Tablet to the Shah unequivocally refers to the
inception of Bahá’u’lláh’s new Revelation. For instance, asserting that he is the
Promised One of the Bayán, Bahá’u’lláh writes the following:

> O people! I am ‘Alí Himself [the Báb] and the Beauty of Muh. ammad amongst you
> and the essence of Spirit [Jesus] between the heavens and the earth. O people, fear
> ye God! Verily, I am a servant Who truly believeth in God and in His verses. I was
> asleep upon My couch, when lo, the breezes of the All-Glorious were wafted over

> caused Me to speak His praise, should ye understand. O people! even if ye fail to

> Me to the Truth, and bade Me reveal the verses of God and His proofs, and this
> thing is not from Me, but from the All-Knowing, All-Mighty, and Beloved God.

(Kitáb-i-Badí‘ 87–88; provisional translation)

Even a cursory look at this passage resolves any doubt concerning the meaning
of the similar statement about Bahá’u’lláh’s Síyáh-Chál experience found in the
Tablet to the Shah of Iran. Bahá’u’lláh’s statements resolving in the Síyáh-Chál
to “reform” the Bábí community are themselves evidence of the abrogation of
the Bayán and the initiation of a new dispensation.

Discussing his Síyáh-Chál experience, Bahá’u’lláh writes: “One night, in a
dream, these exalted words were heard on every side: ‘Verily, We shall render
Thee victorious by Thyself and by Thy pen’” ( Epistle 21). This statement is a
categorical demonstration and declaration of the prophetic station of
Bahá’u’lláh. A detailed discussion of its implications is beyond the scope of this
paper. However, two fundamental points should be mentioned. First “by
Thyself and by Thy pen” means by his being and by his verses. Anyone familiar
with the Persian Bayán and the Kitáb-i-Íqán knows that these are both the
conclusive proof for the claim of the Manifestation of God. That reference is
sufficient to categorize the nature of the Síyáh-Chál experience. Second, the
same statement can also be seen as an implicit assertion of the annulment or
removal of the “sword”—one of the principles announced by Bahá’u’lláh on the
first day of his Rid.ván declaration, signaling the beginning of a new era and the
effective abrogation of specific laws of the Qur’án and Bayán (Mázandarání,
Asráru’l-Áthár 4:22).

In addition to these tablets, Bahá’u’lláh has made numerous other statements
affirming that he revealed himself as the Promised One of the Bayán in the year
nine and revealed his station to a few individuals in the early Baghdad years.
The following are a few examples. In Epistle to the Son of the Wolf,
Bahá’u’lláh refers to the prophecies of the Báb concerning the advent of the
Promised One in the year nine and affirms that he appeared in the year nine:

> He (the Báb) saith—glorified be His utterance—addressing his honor, ‘Az. ím:
> “This, verily, is the thing We promised thee, ere the moment We answered thy call.
> Wait thou until nine will have elapsed from the time of the Bayán. Then exclaim:
> ‘Blessed, therefore, be God, the most excellent of Makers!’ Say: This, verily, is an
> Announcement which none except God hath comprehended. Ye, however, will be
> unaware on that day.” In the year nine this Most Great Revelation arose and shone
> forth brightly above the horizon of the Will of God. None can deny it save he who
> is heedless and doubteth. (Epistle 142)

In his tablet to Kamálu’d-Dín Naráqí (the recipient of Bahá’u’lláh’s Tablet of
All Food), Bahá’u’lláh testifies that the Báb’s prophecy concerning the

52            THE JOURNAL OF BAHÁ’Í STUDIES                                     9.3.1999

appearance of the Promised One in the year nine and the experience of “all
good” in that same year has been fulfilled. He writes:

> O Kamál! Thou hast attained two great bounties. First, thou wert blessed by the
> encounter with God in the year nine, and this is what the Primal Point had promised
> all in His statement, “In the year nine ye shall attain unto the presence of God.”
> Likewise, thou wert honored to receive the Divine Word in the Qur’ánic verse
> concerning All Food, and that is the “good” which the Primal Point has promised in
> His assertion, “In the year nine ye shall attain unto all good.” (Ishráq K há v a r í ,
> Muh. ád. irát 1:192; provisional translation)

In his tablet concerning the Báb’s Tablet of Nineteen Temples, Bahá’u’lláh
writes:

> Verily, by “nineteen” He [the Báb] intended naught but this preeminent and most
> exalted Revelation. But the promise made unto you in the Book concerning “nine,”
> through His assertion “in the year nine ye shall attain unto all good” was fulfilled in
> that year when the dawning of God’s Manifestation was divulged according to a

> forth in the Bayán. At the end of that period the promise was fulfilled; the Promised
> One appeared unto all creation in His all-embracing sovereignty. (Ishráq Khávarí,
> Muh.ád.irát 1:397; provisional translation)

Note in that passage Bahá’u’lláh’s discussion of his concealed revelation in the
year nine, and the stage of nineteen years’ preparation, followed by the
complete unveiling of his station.

In the Kitáb-i-Badí‘ Bahá’u’lláh discusses the argument of Azal’s followers,
according to which the Promised One of the Bayán would not appear before the
completion and perfection of the dispensation of the Bayán. Bahá’u’lláh affirms
that, according to the Báb’s prophecies, that completion would take place in
nine years, and this was exactly fulfilled in the year nine by his own revelation.
He writes:

> Thou hast made mention of the termination of the [Báb’s] Dispensation. Hearken unto
> the utterance of the Revealer of the Bayán, may the realities of all things be a sacrifice
> unto Him, who stateth explicitly, “Ere nine will have elapsed from the inception of

> between ‘A‘z.am’ and ‘‘Az.ím.’” And in another passage He saith, “Observe the
> difference between ‘Qá’im’ and ‘Qayyúm,’ then in the year nine ye shall attain unto
all good.” Concerning this He further saith: “This, verily, is the thing We promised

> thee, ere the moment We answered thy call. Wait thou until nine will have elapsed
> from the time of the Bayán. Then exclaim: ‘Blessed, therefore, be God, the most
> excellent of Makers!’” O thou who claimest to have seeing eyes and to be an upholder

> and unambiguous reference to the difference between “Qá’im” and “Qayyúm” and
> “A‘z.am” and “‘Az.ím.” And when the period was consummated and the appointed
> time ordained by God completed, the Beauty of Nine was revealed with manifest
> dominion. (Kitáb-i-Badí‘ 114–15; provisional translation)

It should be mentioned that the numerical difference between “A‘z. am,”
meaning “the most great,” and “‘Az. ím,” meaning “the great,” is nine—the
same as the difference between “Qá’im” and “Qayyúm.” Bahá’u’lláh states that
the Beauty of Nine (namely “Bahá,” which is equal to nine) appeared in the
year nine as the fulfillment of the prophecies of the Bayán. That same point is
made in many other tablets, such as the following:

> Ponder upon this exalted word revealed by the Dayspring of the utterance of the Lord
> of Names, the Primal Point, which is truly of the essence of the Bayán. He saith: “In
> the year nine ye shall attain unto all good and in the year nine ye shall attain unto the
> presence of God.” And addressing his honor ‘Az.ím, rest upon him the glory and the
> loftiness of God, He—may He be glorified—saith: “This, verily, is the thing We
> promised thee, ere the moment We answered thy call. Wait thou until nine will have
> elapsed from the time of the Bayán. Then exclaim: ‘Blessed, therefore, be God, the
> most excellent of Makers!’” Now be fair: who is the One Who appeared in the year
> nine? (Ishráq Khávarí, Qámús-i-Tawqí‘ 2:487; provisional translation)

One of those to whom Bahá’u’lláh disclosed his station was Dayyán (Mírzá
Asadu’lláh Khu’í). In some of his writings, Bahá’u’lláh mentions that the Báb
had written of Dayyán as the third to recognize Him Whom God shall make
manifest, and Bahá’u’lláh testifies that this did in fact happen in the early
Baghdad period:

> The Primal Point has written to him, “O thou the third Letter to believe in Him Whom
> God shall make manifest,” and this is the station that supersedeth all stations, and then
> He mentioned something in this regard which implied that Dayyán would become
> blessed by the encounter with God in the next Revelation, and that the Eternal Temple
> would declare Himself to him, as in reality he attained the presence and the Tongue of
> God spoke to him . . . and the Most Glorious Beauty showered him with kindness and

Note that if Dayyán was the third to recognize Bahá’u’lláh’s station in Baghdad,
two others should have preceded him. Of Dayyán’s recognition and his
martyrdom, Bahá’u’lláh writes:

> We mention at this moment the Third Letter who believed in Me, who was
> condemned by the source of cruelty without any justification or authority. He
> journeyed to Baghdad till he reached and waited at the door and after permission
> entered and attained the presence of This Countenance and listened and said, “Praise
> be to Thee, the Lord of the invisible and the visible, and glory upon Thee, the Lord of
> Lords. I bear witness that Thou wert hidden from all eternity and that today Thou hast
> revealed Thyself. Blessed is the one who believeth in Thee and quaffeth the wine from
> Thy hand of Generosity.” (Áthár-i-Qalam-i-A‘lá 2:34; provisional translation)

In at least two tablets, Bahá’u’lláh demonstrates the fulfillment of Qur’ánic
prophecies in his Revelation by referring to the verse relating to “After Hín”
(Ba‘da Hín). He explains that “Hín” is numerically 68 and after 68 is 69—
namely, nine years after the Báb’s declaration. The same Qur’ánic passage had
been mentioned by Shaykh-Ah.mad-i-Ah.sá’í, Siyyid Káz.im-i-Rashtí, and the
Báb in regard to the Promised One. Bahá’u’lláh writes:

> Ponder upon the reference to the verse “Ye shall know of His Announcement after
> Hín.” This blessed verse has been mentioned by his honor the late Siyyid, upon him
> rest the glory of God, and likewise earlier by the Shaykh, upon him rest the most
> glorious of all glories, and again by the Primal Point, may the souls of all that dwell
> within the kingdom be a sacrifice unto Him! All of them related the verse to this Most
> Great Revelation, for it was after the completion of the year sixty-eight and the
> appearance of the nine that this Most Great, Most Wondrous, and Most Exalted Cause
> was revealed from the horizon of the Will of the Lord of People. That is why the
> Primal Point, may the life of all be a sacrifice unto Him, saith: “In the year nine ye
> shall attain unto all good” and elsewhere: “In the year nine ye shall attain unto the
> presence of God.” (Ishráq Khávarí, Rah.íq-i-Makhtúm 1:567; provisional translation)

Finally, in a long tablet revealed in 1863–64, Bahá’u’lláh describes in detail
his revelation in the name of the Báb in 1844 (twenty years before the tablet),
and the Báb’s prophecy of his return in the form of the Promised One in the
year nine, as well as his concealment during the Baghdad period until his
declaration in the Rid.ván Garden. He says that God sent His Messengers to the
people of the world solely for the sake of “this luminous, radiant, and manifest
Beauty” who appeared twenty years ago (Mázandarání, A s r á r u ’ l - Át há r
3:174–77; provisional translation). Although his Revelation was the Day of
Resurrection no one recognized him; hence in many of his books he gave the
promise of his encounter in the year nine. When God fulfilled his promise and
revealed His hidden beauty in the year nine, instead of receiving recognition,
swords were drawn against him “by those who are known by His name.”

Bahá’u’lláh goes on to tell of the people turning away from him and his retreat
to the wilderness for two years, his return from concealment, and his revelation
to them of glimmerings of his beauty from behind the veils in order to prepare
them for the encounter with him. He says that sometimes he revealed his beauty
transparently, while at other times he concealed and veiled himself “behind
seventy million veils” until the time was come and the other promise appeared
in the “second nine,” and the divine promise of the “year eighty” was
consummated. At this time, he says, the irrevocable Will of God was to reveal
himself even if no one believed in him. But when he appeared from behind the
veils and revealed the lights of his countenance even to the extent of less than
the tip of a hair, all fainted away and returned to nothingness.

These passages are just a few of the numerous statements of Bahá’u’lláh that
affirm the reality of his concealed revelation in the year nine and his subsequent
declaration of his station to certain individuals throughout the Baghdad period.
In conclusion, all the evidence in so many ways confirms that the standard
Bahá’í conception of the Síyáh- C hál and the Baghdad period as a time
characterized by both concealment and revelation is the only conception which
is faithful to the reality of all the writings of Bahá’u’lláh himself.

A Provisional Translation
He is God! There is none other God but Him, and we, verily, believe in Him

The people talk constantly about this subject, but most of them comprehend
not. Of the miracles mentioned, those which are ascribed to this humble one are
fabrications contrived by impostors. As for the miracles ascribed to the Primal
Point and the Wellspring of the First Outpouring [the Báb], and those related to
the Mirrors reflecting His glory, these are truths by which the faithful are
blessed. However, whatsoever was revealed in the Bayán from the heaven of
loving-kindness and the cloud of mercy, naught hath been ordained as a
universal testimony and a conclusive proof other than the revelation of verses.
This hath ever been and ever will be God’s testimony unto the peoples of the
earth. If anything else appeared from the mine of bounty and glory [Bahá], that
was but a token of God’s grace. Otherwise, the greatest testimony is that which
He Himself hath ordained; “And whose word is more true than God’s?”1

However, those who entirely deny the appearance of any miracle attributed to
the Prophets should not do so, for human reason is not a sufficient standard.
When viewed with the eye of insight, no phenomenon on earth could be
comprehended by any human, whether high or low, without prior observation
and experience. Observe the sun in the heavens. To the extent that it is manifest,
it giveth splendor and illumination to the entirety of the inhabitants of the earth
in the east, the west, and all other directions. Certainly, human reason would not
be inclined to accept the possibility of the existence of such a thing by means of
any rational definition or description without actual observation and experience.
It is the same with all other things in God’s creation. Reflect, so that the secret
of this question may become disclosed to thee. All things are miracles of the
Prophets; “Repeat the gaze: seest thou a single flaw?”2 In the Qur’án there are
many verses which touch upon this theme. Although We do not have in mind an
exact text, the purport of the verses is as follows. For example: “He it is Who
created you and then provided for your sustenance. Will ye not see?” “He it is
Who produced you from the earth most excellently. Will ye not believe?” “He
hath sent down the rain from heaven. Will ye not give thanks?” “He hath

created the heavens and the earth and whatever lieth between them, and made
the mountains a shelter as a token of His grace, yet few among you understand.”
Thus it becometh evident that all phenomena, as things endowed with power,
are also miracles of God. Is there any Creator besides God? Say: Praise be unto
God. No maker is there but Him, in whose name the faithful believe.

Yea, if it is said that those miracles attributed to the former Prophets are not
true unless they are revealed now, this also is not an argument worthy of
enlightened minds and understanding hearts. For how often events have
occurred in the past which have not occurred in the present, and vice versa.
Every thing hath its storehouses with thy Lord, and He sendeth them down as
He pleaseth according to a measure from Him. He is your Lord and the Lord of
your forefathers. Consider, for instance, that every thirty years, according to the
calculation and reckoning of men, there is an outbreak of plague in some lands.
Could it be argued with disbelief during the delay of an outbreak of plague that
no plagues have occurred in the past, since otherwise it must happen now? The
same is true of other events that have occurred before but are not happening at
present, and vice versa.

If it is said, Why should not a miracle reflecting God’s absolute power and
unconditioned attributes appear now in order to cause the upliftment of
sanctified spirits and the exaltation of holy souls, this is indeed true in the same
way as thou dost affirm it with regard to the Bayán. God possesseth the best of
analogies, wert thou to comprehend. Consider the course of this river, which is
visible for all to see. When its waters swell and flood, it rusheth forward and
moveth turbulently. Whatever it doeth, it remaineth within its own sovereignty.
However much the helpless people cry out from every side—clamoring that a
great dam hath been rent asunder, or a barrier obliterated, or houses destroyed,
or a palace crushed to ruins—the river payeth them no heed. With the utmost
force and compulsion, power and sovereignty, it continueth to rush and flow,
touching all places equally. For instance, before the onrush of its power it doth
not matter whether a building belongeth to a prince or to a pauper; the effect is
the same, unless that building hath unique fortifications. Thus do We create
analogies for you that haply ye may be of those who are well assured. Make thy
vision sharp and thy sight keen that the fragrances of joy and exultation may
waft upon thy heart and thou mayest be established upon the throne of
tranquility. This is the greatest of bestowals and the best of states. Would that
ye might find a path unto it.

Observe, furthermore, that were a mighty person to block this river and
control its course by means of his authority and sovereign power, as a
consequence how many homes and dwellings would be ruined and how many
people would be drowned, even though, at the same time, certain dry lands
which had long been suffering from lack of rain would be irrigated, obtain fresh
and wondrous life, and appear arrayed in a new and fabulous garment. Verily,

S. ah. í f i y - i - S h at. .t íyyih (Book of the River)          59

God createth what He pleaseth through the power of His command. No God is
there save God, the Lord of all the worlds.

Similarly, ponder upon the mysteries of divine decree and destiny. Whatever
hath appeared or will appear is like this river. Each thing moveth or reposeth in
its proper place. But if something contrary to this natural flow of events is
manifested, the order of the world becometh gravely disrupted. Couldst thou but
grasp this subtle mystery, which is more hidden than any other mystery, thou
wouldst find thyself independent of this and all other questions. It is for this
reason that, in every age and century, as He desireth, the Unique Hidden One
and the Eternal Essence manifesteth that true River and real Sea and causeth it
to flow, adorning it with a new temple and a new vesture. All those structures of
vain imaginings and palaces of the ungodly are then swept away and destroyed
in its waters. With utmost desire and thirst they drown and perish, lacking even
the faintest awareness that they could quaff a draught thereof. Thus doth God
bestow life upon whom He willeth, and taketh it away from whom He willeth,
and confirmeth whom He pleaseth, and denieth whom He pleaseth, could ye but
perceive it.

This is especially true if the Eastern Winds begin to blow upon the flood of
this heavenly river, which is rushing forth from the North of divine unity. How
many exalted souls and possessors of true understanding, how many mighty
castles and firm lofty edifices, will be destroyed and perish. By Him Who
holdeth the heavens by His might and moveth the oceans by His command!
Were it not for fear of the malice hidden in the hearts, I would have assuredly
unveiled all the inmost divine analogies and all the subtleties of the heavenly
principles with regard to the course of this outward river. Yet, alas, I am
disinclined to approach any matter. On account of the intensity of My anguish
and sorrow, in these days I am sore tried between the Gog of silence and the
Magog of utterance. I beseech God to send down an Alexander who will raise
an insurmountable barrier.

Hidden allusions are concealed within these verses and holy letters are
treasured up within these words. Blessed is the one who hath seized these
pearls, recognized their value, and attained the presence of their Supreme
Meaning. It is clear and evident that the root of differences, from the farthest
worlds of meaning to the nearest degrees of expression, is caused by the
diversity of the forms of the mirrors. Each person speaketh and expresseth
himself according to that which is reflected within him. For example, with
reference to the same analogy of the flooding river, observe that it floweth
forward in one manner and its relationship to all buildings and structures is the
same, yet any valley that hath more capacity is able to take in more of it, and
any dam whose foundation is weaker is less able to resist it. These differences,
therefore, have arisen from the diversity of recipients. In like manner, consider
the rays of the Eternal Sun, which shine with the same illumination in the

60         THE JOURNAL OF BAHÁ’Í STUDIES                             9.3.1999

heaven of human hearts but, when reflected in the forms of mirrors, differ by
reason of differences among the mirrors themselves. Thus it is that some abide
exalted in their essences and high in their endeavors, while others sink into the
depths of lethargy and degradation. All things have their rank before God, and
all return unto Him.

Those possessed of insight should make their vision as sharp as blades of
steel and their hearts as vast as existence itself that haply, while there is yet a
chance, the former may not be prevented from beholding the Divine Beauty nor
the latter remain withheld from the sweet waters of everlasting life. Thus may
they take delight in all foods and obtain their portion and no longer cleave unto
the sayings of the people or suffer their virtue to be robbed by their deeds. All
drink from the same fountain and partake of the same ocean, and all have their
ranks before thy Lord, and all move in accordance with their own state. Today,
every soul who believeth in the Most Exalted Countenance and recognizeth
with certitude His station as manifested after Him on the Throne, this shall
suffice him above any other knowledge or deed. But His good pleasure and
faith in Him cannot be realized except through obedience unto His command in
all things. This is the greatest, most excellent, and consummate fruit of
existence. There is no goal besides God and no end save Him.

All that hath been mentioned of the attributes of the river was only one
analogy which streamed forth from the Pen. Ponder and reflect, that haply all
the hidden mysteries may be freed from the veils of nearness and remoteness, of
loftiness and abasement, and unveil their beauty. Recognize this Sea of Seas
before whose grandeur all seas are but a drop, and behold how it surgeth within
the Wellspring of its own blessed Essence and the mine of its own attributes.
Say: Praise be unto God! How astonishing is Thy cause and how mighty Thy
power! How great is Thy sovereignty and how compelling Thy grandeur! We
know naught of Thee except what Thou hast taught us through the tongue of the
Manifestation of Thyself and the Wellspring of Thine Essence, He Who is the
Fountainhead of Thy Cause and the Repository of Thy Decree. Verily, Thou
knowest all that hath been and will be created. Thou, indeed, art the Truth, the
Knower of things unseen.

O Javád! We shall impart unto thee a single word which We have taken from
the essence of the Sacred Books and Scriptures as a token of Our mercy and
loving-kindness, that the water of immortality may rain from the clouds of
God’s unity upon thy reality and the realities of His servants, and that thou
mayest attain unto eternal and everlasting life. That word is this: “Possess a
pure, kindly and radiant heart, that thine may be a sovereignty ancient,
imperishable and everlasting.” This is a treasure that pertaineth to Heaven.
Were it to be quickened and to rise, it would never die or perish. This is a light
that shall never be extinguished, a treasure that perisheth not, a raiment that
shall never be outworn, and a revelation that will never be concealed. Through

S. ah. í f i y - i - S h at. .t íyyih (Book of the River)          61

it many will go astray and others will be guided. Render thanks unto God that
thou hast become the recipient of this All-Encompassing Word, this celestial
melody and heavenly song. Had I found a word more conclusive, I would have
divulged it. There is no greater counsel than this word. Preserve it if thou
desirest to find a path to the Lord of the Mighty Throne.

It is because of the love this servant holdeth for thee that this answer hath
been written. Otherwise, I have no inclination to set forth any topic or write a
single letter thereon. God is a sufficient witness unto Me, and a protector for
thee. Wherefore, rise up with legs of iron and set forth upon this path which We
have rolled out upon the snow-white earth of the spirit. With eyes of consuming
flame gaze upon its pillars and its stature, and with ruby ears hearken unto what
hath appeared therefrom in regard to thy question. With palms of gold and
fingers of power seize what is in and upon it, and with a swordlike tongue sing
and chant in ringing tones, clap and drum, that there is no God but Him, that
‘Alí Muh.ammad is the Essence of God and His eternal Being, and Muh.ammad
‘Alí is the Mine of the Cause of God and His everlasting Self, that the Living
Countenance is the Repository of God’s authority and His self-subsisting
Identity, and the Letters of the Living are the first to have believed in God and
His verses. We all, verily, cleave unto them. This is the Word by which truth
shall be distinguished from falsehood until the Day when the Hour shall strike,
when all shall present themselves before God and abide by His command. Glory
be upon those who believe in Him on the day of His meeting and who observe
what He hath decreed.
