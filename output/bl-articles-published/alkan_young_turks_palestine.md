## The Young Turks and the Bahá'ís in Palestine

The Young Turk Revolution of 1908-1909 was a turning point that opened up new prospects for Ottoman society and politics. It created a milieu in which new ideas could be shared in a relatively open manner. The case of the Baha’is in Palestine, even though they were seemingly a _quantité négligeable_ among the religious communities, is a good example for the dissemination of reformist thoughts in that period. Based on unpublished letters of the Baha’i leader ‘Abdu’l-Baha (‘Abbas Effendi, 1844-1921) in Palestine written in Ottoman Turkish, this chapter deals with the post-Revolutionary relations between him and the Young Turk elite. The chapter discusses the significance of Palestine to the development of the Baha’i community, the contributions of ‘Abdu’l-Baha to the reform discourse in the Ottoman Empire, the tense relationship between ‘Abdu’l-Baha and Sultan Abdülhamid II, ‘Abdu’l-Baha’s previously unknown connections with some leading Young Turks, and the Baha’i leader’s attempt to infuse Baha’i thoughts into the CUP \[Committee of Union and Progress\]. The chapter is rounded up with an overview of the declining relationship between the CUP and ‘Abdu’l-Baha during World War I.

> 1853 due to his leading role in the revolutionary religious Babi move-
> ment.1 With the approval of the Ottoman state, Baha’u’llah chose
> Baghdad as his place of exile. When tracing the life of Baha’u’llah
> from Baghdad – where he remained in exile for ten years and was
> given Ottoman citizenship to protect him from Iranian interference –
> to the Ottoman capital Istanbul, Edirne in Rumelia (1863–68) and
> finally to ‛Akka [Acre] in Palestine, the development of the Baha’i
> religion needs to be situated in the wider context of late Ottoman
> reformism. It was largely due the tolerant attitude of the Sublime
> Porte in general that the Baha’i religion survived and took on its
> present form as the successor to the Babi faith that was nearly eradi-
cated in Iran.2

Baha’u’llah died in Palestine as a prisoner of the Ottoman Empire.

> He was allowed to live outside the prison-city of ‛Akka for the last
> fifteen years of his life. During these rather silent years when he was
> not under the spotlight of the Ottoman government, he composed
> many of his important writings that refer to the reformation of the
> world in general and to reforms in the Ottoman Empire and Iran in
> particular. His opus magnum, al-Kitab al-Aqdas [The Most Holy
> Book], which he composed in ‛Akka, constitutes the core of his univer-
> sal reforms. In Palestine he continued writing and sending letters to
> the political and religious leaders of his day in which he called upon
> them to establish world peace. He invited them to follow his religion
> as it offered solutions to the ills of the age and would, he claimed,
usher in a ‛Golden Age’.

Baha’u’llah also entrusted his son and successor ‛Abdu’l-Baha
> with the external affairs of the community vis-à-vis the Ottoman
> authorities, and it was in this period until 1908 that ‛Abdu’l-Baha
> was increasingly in the fore. The prestige of the Baha’is in Ottoman
> Palestine was enhanced through ‛Abdu’l-Baha’s friendly relations and
> connections with some Ottoman officials such as Midhat Paşa, and
> later liberal Young Turks. These contacts opened the gates of the
> citadel to Baha’u’llah after nine years of incarceration within the city
> walls, provided a safe environment for the development of the religion
> and paved the way for ‛Abdu’l-Baha’s release from his own confinement
> in ‛Akka.

‛Abdu’l-Baha on Reforms

> The wave of reforms in the Young Turk period allowed for an exchange
> of ideas among diverse ethnic and religious groups. Education was
> regarded as the pivot of reform by the Young Turks, and this common
> feature linked them with Baha’i ideas. Baha’u’llah and ‛Abdu’l-Baha
> were in contact with Ottoman reformers from the 1870s onwards. With
> a claim to a new religious faith, in many of his writings , Baha’u’llah,
> calling himself a ‛World Reformer’,3 stressed the need for education as
> a means toward the spiritual regeneration and the material progress of
> humanity.4 ‛He repeatedly linked chiliastic concerns with democratic
> themes, showing the way in which he saw his appearance as a world
messiah to have turned the world upside down’.5

The political climate during the reform period in the Ottoman
> Empire (Tanzimat, 1839–76) and Iran, are discussed in ‛Abdu’l-Baha’s
> Risala-yi Madaniyya [Treatise on Civilization, 1875] and Risala-yi
> Siyasiyya [Treatise on Politics/the Art of Governance], 1892).6 In his
> first treatise ‛Abdu’l-Baha deplores the backwardness and decadence of
> Iran and proposes reforms in all spheres of the state, affirms the need for
> a parliament and ethical and secular education and the employment of
> able statesmen to ensure just rule.7 He calls the Risala-yi Madaniyya ‛a
> tribute’ to the ‛high endeavor’ of Nasiru’d-Din Shah (r. 1848–96), the
> incumbent Qajar ruler, to improving the conditions in Iranian society;
> ‛a brief statement on certain urgent questions’.8 The treatise was circu-
> lated anonymously and is said to have attracted wide readership among
> the Iranian intelligentsia, particularly after its printing in 1882. But
> later when it became known that its author was a Baha’i, no one would
> admit to having read it.9 His Risala-yi Siyasiyya,10 written as a response
> to the events during the Tobacco Revolt in Iran (1890–92), is a dis-
> cussion of politics and society.11 ‛Abdu’l-Baha emphasizes that man-
> made laws are not enough to enable human progress and that divine
> law or religion is indispensable to educate the people. He adds that
> the interference of religious leaders (‛ulema), especially ignorant ones,
> in political affairs is dangerous and cites the deposition of Ottoman
> Sultan Abdülaziz (r. 1861–76) as an example. In that ‛greatest object
> lesson’, students of religious schools revolted, demonstrating against

> the Bulgarian uprisings, the massacres of Muslims in the Balkans and
> the inability of the state to deal with the affair.12 In a letter written
> during the Iranian Constitutional Revolution (mashrutiyyat, 1906–11)
> ‛Abdu’l-Baha refers to his Risala-yi Siyasiyya and sums up the involve-
> ment of religious leaders and students in the fall of Abdülaziz. He says
> that in Istanbul on every corner and bazaar their cry ‛We want war!
> We want war! (harb isteriz, harb isteriz)’13 could be heard. After this
> conflict during which religion was abused for political ends and much
> blood was shed, the Ottomans lost most of their domains in Rumelia
> and Anatolia. He says that despite his advice and exhortations in the
> Risala-yi Siyasiyya, ‛the ears were deaf and the eyes blind’ and similar
violent events occurred during the Constitutional Revolution.14

In one of his unpublished Turkish letters dealing with reform in
> the Ottoman Empire and Iran, ‛Abdu’l-Baha once more advocates the
> non-involvement of ‛ulema in politics. This letter is also probably his
> only known direct reference to the Tanzimat. He speaks about Iran’s
> worsening conditions caused by ignorant ‛ulema and the country’s
> need for reform after the model of the Ottomans as inaugurated by
> Sultan Mahmud II. His emphasis is on secular reforms; clerics should
> only be concerned with spiritual and ethical matters; i.e., they should
> educate the people and guide their conduct. He furthermore com-
> mends the shah for having inaugurated reforms for the betterment of
> Iranian society.15 Here reference is made either to the reform attempts
> of Nasiru’d-Din Shah in the 1870s16 or the ‛useful reforms of the just
> government’ of Muzaffaru’d-Din Shah (1896–1906).17

‛Abdu’l-Baha and Sultan Abdülhamid II
> ‛Abdu’l-Baha actively disseminated Baha’i reformist thoughts and was
> in touch with leaders of the dissident ‛Young Ottoman’ movement
> such as Namık Kemal, Ziya Paşa and Midhat Paşa, either through
> letters or personally.18 These contacts made him a political mischief-
> maker in the eyes of Sultan Abdülhamid II. Moreover, he was accused
> by local Ottoman officials in Palestine of having harmful relations
> with foreigners and of buying land for the Zionists in Palestine in the
> 1890s. Some Arab local officials in Palestine reported false accusations

> to the sultan that the Iranian ‛Abbas Efendi, who was in exile in ‛Akka
> and able to obtain anything he wanted through his wealth and influ-
> ence, had allied himself with like-minded officials to buy land at a
> cheap price from poor people, then to sell it to Jews and foreigners for
profit.19

In addition, news of subversive religious activities in Lebanon and
> in ‛Akka in 1905 reached Istanbul. It was claimed that committees
> under the supervision of Muhammad ‛Abduh, then the grand mufti
> of Egypt, were attempting to spread the ‛Babi [Baha’i]’ and ‛Wahhabi
> [Salafi] sects’ by exploiting the laxity of Ottoman civil and military
> servants. Conservative Ottoman ‛ulema who opposed reformism made
> the Salafis and their leader Muhammad ‛Abduh appear dangerous in
> the eyes of the sultan, by insinuating that the expansion of the super-
> stitious and mischievous ideas of these ‛sects’, which contradicted the
> Islamic shari‛a, along the Syrian coast, poison the people’s minds. The
> argument went on that, foreign intrigues heightened the nefarious
> impact of the Baha’i and Salafi activities. Therefore, the propagandists
> of these heretical sects need to be monitored, their efforts in establish-
> ing committees prevented and the coastline constantly controlled; if
> necessary more troops should be sent there.20 The Hamidian regime
> had also been concerned for some time that ‛Abbas Efendi was main-
> taining good relations with Bedouin sheikhs, and this issue needed
> proper attention in order to prevent an Arab revolt.21 Later the sultan
> sent a Commission of Inquiry (1905) to investigate the matter and
> ‛Abdu’l-Baha was interrogated. As a result he was accused of mischief
and almost exiled to Fizan in the Libyan Desert.22

Earlier, in 1901, Abdülhamid had renewed ‛Abdu’l-Baha’s confine-
> ment in ‛Akka. The Ottoman authorities were observing the activities
> and development of the Baha’is inside and outside the Empire closely.
> ‛Ali Ferruh Bey, the then Ottoman ambassador to Washington D.C.,
> filed a report23 on the strong influence of the Baha’i leader on people
> and his loyalty to the Sultan, and was convinced of the ‛future power
> and importance’ of the ‛Babi sect’. He advised Abdülhamid to use
> ‛Abdu’l-Baha as a ‛spiritual weapon’ (manevi bir silah) against Iran and
> its efforts to spread Shi‛ism. This did not convince the Sultan. Neither
> was he persuaded by ‛Abdu’l-Baha’s own pledge of loyalty.

264                   Late Ottoman Palestine

In a Turkish letter to Abdülhamid – to my knowledge the only
> letter directly addressed to the Sultan – the Baha’i leader talks about
> the imperial decree ‛that has been issued recently’ concerning his con-
> finement in ‛Akka.24 ‛Abdu’l-Baha most probably wrote his letter as a
> response to the renewal of his imprisonment in 1901.25 He says that
> ‛no dishonorable condition and act contrary to the imperial will has
> manifested itself on my behalf or our community’ and assures the
> emperor that he and his followers are his loyal subjects who ‛hesitate
> to meddle in the affairs of the government (umur-i hükûmet) and the
> transactions of the people (muamelât-ı ahali)’, as required by Baha’i
principles (non-involvement in partisan politics).

The motivation for the letter was ‛Abdu’l-Baha’s contacts with
> Americans and the report that they were joining the religious commu-
> nity he headed. Here and in other Turkish letters ‛Abdu’l-Baha presents
> the Baha’i religion as a tarikat [‛way’, ‛path’ or ‛religious order’] within
> Islam, and not as a new religion. Throughout their stay in Ottoman
> domains – until the death of ‛Abdu’l-Baha in 1921 – the Baha’is
> presented themselves to outsiders in the Middle East as followers of
> Islam and as advised by Baha’u’llah and ‛Abdu’l-Baha refrained from
> attracting Ottomans to the Baha’i faith. Any other course of action
> would have been disastrous because the Baha’is would have faced
> severe persecution. ‛Abdu’l-Baha notes in his letter to Abdülhamid
> that ‛nothing has been undertaken to attract and admit even a single
> individual from among the Ottoman subjects to join our tarikat dur-
> ing our lengthy stay in ‛Akka for more than thirty years’. ‛Abdu’l-Baha
> consequently states that the Americans were guided to Islam (ihtida)
> through the teachings of Baha’u’llah. Initially, American Protestant
> missionaries in Iran engaged in religious conversations with the Baha’is
> and joined the ‛Baha’i tarikat’. The new converts returned to America,
> propagated the Baha’i teachings and won over many Americans in
> a short time. Later, some Americans who travelled to Palestine met
> ‛Abdu’l-Baha, and this resulted in their belief in the ‛manifest religion
> of Muhammad’ and they recognized ‛the unity of God, approved and
> confirmed the prophethood (nübüvvet) of His Holiness, the glory of the
> Messengers [Muhammad], and believed in the greatness (ulviyet) of my
> late father Baha’u’llah’.

These conversions prompted anger and enmity among the
> American Protestant community in Palestine, ‛they gave the affair
> a different coloring and informed his Majesty’. This resulted in the
> renewal of ‛Abdu’l-Baha’s imprisonment. Nevertheless, he expressed
> the wish that the guidance of Americans to Islam would please
> Abdülhamid and his subjects.26 He asks him to examine the
> appended Baha’i chronicles written during his father’s time and
> so witness ‛the affection (ihlas) and loyalty (sadakat)’ of Baha’u’llah
toward the Sultan.

After the Young Turk Revolution in 1908 ‛Abdu’l-Baha freely
> expressed his disapproval of Abdülhamid’s injustices toward Baha’u’llah,
> himself and the Baha’is. Before this, notwithstanding the steps taken
> by the Sublime Porte against the Baha’is in that period, ‛Abdu’l-Baha
> spoke with gratitude about Abdülhamid at that time and stressed the
> Sultan’s impartiality towards the Baha’is. Owing to the atmosphere of
> censure and the tight network of spies working to identify subversive
> activities during the Hamidian reign, ‛Abdu’l-Baha could not have
> done otherwise.27

Secret Connections and a Baha’i Paşa
> In August 1908, immediately after the Young Turk Revolution,
> ‛Abdu’l-Baha was released from imprisonment as a result of the
> amnesty for political prisoners.28 A few years later, he was able to
> leave the ‛Akka-Haifa area and travelled to Egypt, Europe and North
> America to spread the Baha’i teachings (1910–1913). Often in his talks
> he praised the CUP for releasing him and for their efforts to secure
> freedom. ‛Abdu’l-Baha expressed his appreciation for his liberation
> before it was clear that the military wing of the CUP would take over
> with a coup d’état (1913) or what that would mean. Past research was
> unable to determine how and through whom ‛Abdu’l-Baha was freed
> from imprisonment. In the light of Turkish letters that he wrote after
> his release, we know now that he had had secret contacts with the
> civilian, parliamentarian wing of the Young Turk circles in Istanbul
> and Salonica during the reign of Abdülhamid. In those letters ‛Abdu’l-
> Baha praises the CUP and supports its goals.

266                  Late Ottoman Palestine

‛Abdu’l-Baha made contact with the leading Young Turk Bursalı
> Mehmed Tahir Bey (1861–1925). He was a military man, teacher, mys-
> tic and Ottoman writer, who had been assigned to different military
> and administrative posts including Salonica and Istanbul and was del-
> egate for Bursa at the Ottoman Parliament from 1908–11.29 Tahir Bey
> was also cofounder of the secret Osmanlı Hürriyet Cemiyeti [Ottoman
> Freedom Society] in Salonica (1906). Around that time Mustafa Kemal
> (Atatürk) founded a similar organization when he was stationed in
> Syria30 and went secretly to Salonica in 1906 to make contact with the
> like-minded Mehmed Tahir, who had been his teacher at the military
> school there.31 It is possible that as a well-known reformist figure in
> the Middle East ‛Abdu’l-Baha made contact with Tahir Bey through
> reform-minded officers such as the young Mustafa Kemal during his
postings in Syria and Palestine.

What is certain is that ‛Abdu’l-Baha was in contact with Tahir Bey
> via a Baha’i in Istanbul by the name of Ahmed Şevki Efendi and
> through an Ottoman official named Bedri Paşa. The latter, Hasan
> Bedreddin (1851–1912),32 was a military commander and writer who
> had been involved in the deposition of Sultan Abdülaziz in 1876.33
> Due to the repressive atmosphere during the reign of Abdülhamid, he
> was removed from Istanbul to Syria and Palestine where he served as
> colonel.34 After the Young Turk Revolution, Bedri Paşa was governor
> general (vali) of the province of İşkodra [Shkodër, today in Albania],
> from 1909 until 1911.35 In Persian Baha’i sources he is mentioned as
> Bedri Bey (Badri Beg), who was exiled to ‛Akka before 1908, was
> translator of ‛Abdu’l-Baha into French and a Baha’i.36 The latter’s other
> contact person, Giridî Ahmed Şevki Efendi, was a soap-maker/mer-
> chant (sabuncu) from Crete. He is not mentioned in available Baha’i
> sources but appears in a photograph of Baha’is of Istanbul, taken in
April 1919.37

‛Abdu’l-Baha must have come in contact with Bedri when he was
> deputy commander in ‛Akka around 1898. Because of having been a
> Young Turk and the injustices he allegedly committed at that post, he
> was sent to another place.38 According to the letters of ‛Abdu’l-Baha,
> Bedri’s next posts were in Beirut and then Damascus.39 ‛Abdu’l-Baha’s
> more substantial letters to Bedri Paşa in terms of political matters

> were written during the latter’s governorship in İşkodra and after his
> retirement. As military governor Bedri Paşa had to face uprisings by
> Albanian insurgents against the CUP and clashes between Christians
> and Muslims. He proclaimed ‛holy war’ against Christian rebels and
> tried to suppress them.40 As the troops were insufficient, he used reli-
> gion and appealed to the Muslims to accept arms from the govern-
> ment and defend their town and faith.41 He wrote to Istanbul asking
> for permission to pursue a more aggressive policy toward the Albanian
> rebellion. Bedri wanted more control over the mountainous İşkodra
> region in the north and requested more troops. The Sublime Porte
> praised the governor for his initial reforms but encouraged him to
proceed with caution.42

‛Abdu’l-Baha refers to events in Albania during the governorship
> of Bedri Paşa and praises him for the ‛exceptional administration’ in
> view of the rebellions all over the Ottoman Balkans, particularly in
> Albania.43 He adds that it is crucial to deliver the people from igno-
> rance and inertia and bring them into the civilized world. ‛Abdu’l-
> Baha encourages Bedri to establish unity based on Baha’i core beliefs
> by abolishing division and enmity among the diverse people of the
> province. The means for this ‛foremost achievement’ was the diffusion
> of knowledge and education, making it accessible to all, and so deliv-
> ering the diverse sects from evils and foolish prejudices.44 Through
> Bedri Paşa’s ‛divine confirmation’, the people and tribes of İşkodra,
> ‛who are the most fanatical in Albania, live in comfort and peace’ and
> the province is ‛different from other provinces as regards the perfect
> safety and peace in such a time of tumult and rebellion’.45 According
> to ‛Abdu’l-Baha a practical and beneficial step to be taken for the secu-
> rity of the country would be the construction of roads everywhere in
the province.46

In another letter written after Bedri Paşa’s retirement and his stay
> in Istanbul, ‛Abdu’l-Baha states that in talks he held during his travels
> in Europe he always praised the CUP. When he was a prisoner during
> the time of Abdülhamid’s ‛despotism’, he was freed by the ‛resolute
> efforts’ of the Committee as soon as liberty was proclaimed. When
> he came across some objections in newspapers towards the ‛esteemed
> Committee’, he ‛candidly and justly defended it for the sake of seeking

> the truth’.47 Referring to the war between the Ottomans and Italy
> in Libya in 1911–12 in the same letter ‛Abdu’l-Baha warns the Turks
> against Italy’s nationalistic and imperialistic ambitions: ‛Detailed
> information about Italy’s violent breaking of treaties, its utter oppres-
> sion, injustice, and finally the harmful consequences of the sudden
> cruel and bloodthirsty attacks causing destruction, has been delivered
> with conclusive proof’. In line with Baha’i ideas, he adds though that
> ‛inasmuch as there are many traitors in Europe, there are also faith-
> ful people who think beyond national lines and promulgate universal
> peace and expect the advent of the unity of mankind’. He wrote to
> Bedri Paşa that he was willing to present the ideals of the CUP in the
> United States where he was invited by leading public figures: ‛If there
> are suitable thoughts that the esteemed Committee has and wants to
> present and promulgate there, I ask you to convey these to me through
your Excellency’.48

In yet another letter to Bedri Paşa ‛Abdu’l-Baha also talks about
> enemies and nay-sayers in the Ottoman Empire who want to cause
> chaos because of their selfish interests, and who, as part of their
> schemes, presented him as an enemy of Abdülhamid. He writes that
> ‛it is evident and known to you and to the world that my secret con-
> nections with the Young Turks in the time of Abdülhamid have been
> always the cause of hardships’. After his release he was accused of being
> a supporter of despotism so as to instigate the CUP to turn against
> him. ‛Since my conduct and manners are as manifest as the sun for
> your Excellency’, he then asks Bedri Paşa, ‛investigate the matter and
> inform the esteemed Committee of Union and Progress in Istanbul
and Salonica, especially Tahir Bey, the Bursa delegate, of the truth’.49

From Palestine ‛Abdu’l-Baha contacted Mehmed Tahir Bey through
> the Baha’i Ahmed Şevki Efendi in Istanbul, and sent two Baha’is to
> meet him.50 After the meeting, ‛Abdu’l-Baha expressed his gratitude.
> He wanted to convey to members of the CUP, especially to Mehmed
> Tahir Bey, that if the principles of ‛the Baha’i tarikat, the teachings of
> his holiness Baha’u’llah, his exhortations and counsels are understood
> properly, it is impossible not to admit that it is the source of happi-
> ness to mankind’. ‛Abdu’l-Baha thanked the CUP for having sent a

> between a person appointed by the CUP with Baha’is he dispatched
> to Istanbul.51 In still another letter to Ahmed Şevki Efendi, ‛Abdu’l-
> Baha expresses his hope of meeting and talking with a figure from
> the CUP; specifically Mehmed Tahir Bey should visit him in Egypt.52
> He then talks about the Young Turks as ‛the destroyer of the edi-
> fice of tyranny and the source of life for Turkey and Iran’ and hopes
> that the ‛righteous liberals of Iran may live long through the aid and
> grace of God’ because ‛since the day on which liberty (hürriyet) was
> proclaimed in Iran, the Baha’is live overall with joy and peace’. He
> adds that he prays that God may assist and confirm the CUP. As he
> was in prison for thirty years under Abdülhamid, after the Revolution
> the CUP ‛took the chains and fetters’ from his neck and placed them
> around the neck of the ‛tyrannical and bloodthirsty’ Abdülhamid.
> Thousands of oppressed victims were liberated from chains and fet-
> ters and from exile, and the ‛rascal (herif)’ himself was incarcerated.53
> Despite Abdülhamid’s tyranny that surpassed that of Yazid,54 foolish
> common people would still respect and love him; because they were
blind and ignorant they despised the CUP.

‛Abdu’l-Baha directed Ahmed Şevki to present his letter to Mehmed
> Tahir Bey.55 Then, in his letter to Mehmed Tahir Bey himself, ‛Abdu’l-
> Baha thanks the Committee for its ‛zeal and justice (himmet ve adalet)’
> in liberating him and adds that through the Revolution ‛the radiating
> light of the morn of liberty illumined the horizons of the country’.56
> ‛Abdu’l-Baha calls Rumelia, were the Revolution started, ‛the day-
> spring of the lights of freedom’ and ‛dawning-place of the lights of
> truth’.57

Young Turk and Baha’i Ideas
> In another letter, written in Persian, ‛Abdu’l-Baha underscores the
> similarity between the ideals and goals of the CUP those of the
> Baha’is.58 He states that the ‛Baha’is assist the Committee of Union
> and Progress with heart and soul. They are on the same path, have
> the same disposition, seek freedom and love liberty (azadi-talab va
> hurriyyat-parvar), hope for equality, are well-wishers of humanity and
> ready to sacrifice their lives to unite humanity (vahdat-i bashari)’.

Ben-Bassat_Ch13.indd 269                                                         3/25/2011 5:08:55 PM

> Despite the laudable efforts of the CUP in striving for unity among
> the various groups in the Ottoman Empire, ‛Abdu’l-Baha states that
> the aims of the CUP are only concerned with the physical world
> and those of the Baha’is are broader in that they seek the unity of
> humanity as a whole and are concerned with spiritual progress. He
> affirms that true progress comes from spiritual power, and the East
> is its source. But presently the East is the captive of the West; they
> are at war because Europe made it its policy to constantly attack
> defenseless Asia. A look at history reveals that throughout the ages
> and centuries the East has been victorious over Europe through its
> spiritual power (quvvat-i ruhani) and not through material power
> (quvvat-i jismani). There were times when troops of the East – the
> Umayyads, Tamerlane, Genghis Khan and Sultan Selim [Selim I,
> the Ottoman sultan] – were victorious over the West; however, this
> was not continuous and it was only through its spiritual powers that
> Asia subdued Europe and won immense victories. ‛Abdu’l-Baha calls
> on the East, here represented by the CUP, to use its spiritual power
> once again to oppose Europe and shake its pillars, and so reveal the
true splendor of Asia.

In line with this ‛Abdu’l-Baha cautions the CUP not to rely on
> conventional politics and refers to Baha’u’llah’s teachings which
> stress that however much human politics (siyasat-i bashariyya) shows
> progress (taraqqi), it is nothing compared to divine politics (siyasat-i
> ilahiyya), because ‛divine politics is the light of the physical world and
> an immeasurable mercy that encompasses all peoples and nations. [...]
> Therefore we need to follow divine politics, especially in this glorious
> century and this age of the progress of humanity in which nothing
> but divine politics leads to success’. By conforming to divine politics
> Baha’u’llah bestowed a new spirit (ruhi-yi jadid) on Iran that has eas-
> ily penetrated and influenced even the remotest places in America.
> ‛Now all the peoples of the East must be content and happy with this
> politics, and delighted in the pervading influence of the teachings of
> Baha’u’llah in Europe and America’. Lastly, he calls on the Baha’is
> to do everything in their power to familiarize themselves with the
> ‛benevolent aims’ (maqasid-i khayriyya) of the CUP and respond to its
> just endeavors by assisting it.

This opportunity was afforded when ‛Abdu’l-Baha visited
> Washington D.C. in April 1912 in the first week of his travels in the
> United States to present the Baha’i religion.59 There he met Yusuf Ziya
> Paşa, the Ottoman ambassador to Washington. For the Sublime Porte
> ‛Abdu’l-Baha’s presence in the American capital was a sensitive politi-
> cal issue that could upset the balance with Iran and Russia. Hence,
> initially it did not want the ambassador to be contact in with him. In
> his memorandum to Istanbul Yusuf Ziya Paşa states that considering
> ‛Abdu’l-Baha’s positive reception by eminent people in America, his
> constant praises of the CUP that displayed justice and liberated him
> and the gathering held in his honor by the Iranian embassy60 at which
> he was present, the Ottoman Embassy could not be indifferent toward
> him. Therefore ‛Abdu’l-Baha and some of his followers were honored
> at a dinner. He adds that this was received positively and his follow-
> ers (about 800) wrote and signed a letter of gratitude to be forwarded
> to the Young Turk government, hoping that the Baha’is could be of
> assistance to the CUP.61

‛Abdu’l-Baha and Cemal Paşa in Palestine
> Even though ‛Abdu’l-Baha was shown due respect initially by the
> Young Turks, the tides turned against him once more after the mili-
> tant nationalist Young Turks seized power in 1913 and Enver Paşa,
> Talat Paşa and Cemal Paşa took over as a dictatorial triumvirate.62
> The euphoria over the ‛liberty’, ‛equality’ and ‛brotherhood’ of the
> Young Turks did not last long. On the contrary, the rule of those three
> Paşas in particular proved to be me more repressive and bloodier than
> that of Abdülhamid and ended in the collapse of the Empire after
> World War I. Non-Turkish and non-Muslim minorities, especially
> Christians, suffered from the radical nationalistic ideology of the CUP
> which resulted in forced settlements, deportation and a ‛Turkification’
> policy.63 The Baha’is were not affected by this, but CUP antagonism
manifested itself otherwise.

The attitude of General Cemal Paşa (1872–1922), Military Governor
> of the Ottoman troops in Syria (1914–17), towards ‛Abdu’l-Baha was
> the opposite of the early and liberal Young Turk leaders.64 Whereas

Ben-Bassat_Ch13.indd 271                                                       3/25/2011 5:08:56 PM

> the latter approached Baha’i ideas positively, Cemal was a sworn
> enemy of ‛Abdu’l-Baha and the Baha’is. According to Baha’i sources
> due to false accusations the Paşa originally wanted to execute him.
> Later, when he met ‛Abdu’l-Baha in Palestine, his anger subsided and
> he enjoyed the Baha’i leader’s presence. Cemal Paşa, as reported by a
> Baha’i eyewitness, supposedly asked ‛Abdu’l-Baha what the cause of
> the Ottoman Empire’s weakness was and he responded, ‛the existence
> of diverse religions’. And when Cemal asked what the remedy was, the
> Baha’i leader allegedly replied, ‛that the leaders of all religions and
> denominations existing within the Ottoman Empire and Islamic lands
> gather in Constantinople and, after consultations, agree on a single and
> unifying religion’. Cemal Paşa is said to have approved these words
> and added: ‛After my return [from the Suez campaign], I will take you
> to Constantinople. There I will gather the religious leaders and force
them into unity and agreement on one religion’.65

After this positive encounter Cemal Paşa’s attitude towards ‛Abdu’l-
> Baha once again changed for the worse due to negative reports sent
> to him about ‛Abdu’l-Baha. He promised to crucify the Baha’i leader
> when he returned victorious from his military campaigns in Sinai,
> but his troops were defeated by the British army and this did not
> take place. At the beginning of World War I, ‛Abdu’l-Baha planned
> to take practical steps to intervene peacefully against belligerence. He
> intended to convene a gathering of leading Muslim and Christian lead-
> ers in Palestine where he hoped to advise them to cooperate to avoid
> disorder and chaos in the region. ‛Abdu’l-Baha was prevented by oppo-
> nents from doing so. Despite this he was occupied with local affairs
> and took over the task of providing food for the people in the region
> who suffered from the mismanagement of the Ottoman overlord.66

Conclusion
> The attitude of the Ottoman government during the reign of
> Abdülhamid II towards the Baha’i leadership was generally hostile.
> Constant efforts by opponents of ‛Abdu’l-Baha reinforced the Sultan’s
> antagonistic policy. However, ‛Abdu’l-Baha was able to ally himself
> with like-minded reformers within the Young Turk movement, and

Ben-Bassat_Ch13.indd 272                                                         3/25/2011 5:08:56 PM

> familiarize them with Baha’i reformist thoughts which resulted in his
> release. His vision of the West and modernity and his international
> ties may have been attractive and beneficial to the governors. On the
> whole, whereas the approach of the Young Turk reformers was embed-
> ded in the framework of a secular modernism and nationalism, the
> reforms of Baha’u’llah and ‛Abdu’l-Baha were beyond the proposals of
> the reformers in the Ottoman Empire in that they were universalistic
> and emphasized not only material civilization but also moral and reli-
gious values.

The first years of the Young Turk rule were crucial for the develop-
> ment of the Baha’i faith as a religion independent of Islam. ‛Abdu’l-
> Baha was free to travel outside the Ottoman domains and was given
> the opportunity to spread the Baha’i ideas in the West, which led to
> success and the positive reception he received from high and low alike
> was echoed in the Ottoman Empire. In Palestine the Baha’i religion
> was significantly consolidated by its founder and ‛Abdu’l-Baha, and
> from there he organized its expansion in numbers and disseminated
> its ideas to other regions inside and outside the Ottoman domains.
> The Baha’is were spared by the aggressive minority policies of the
> CUP. After the initial positive reception of Baha’i ideas by early Young
> Turks and the improved conditions that prevailed for six years after
> ‛Abdu’l-Baha’s release by liberal members of the CUP, he again faced
> the enmity of the Ottoman government – this time led by the mili-
> tary wing of the Young Turks who apparently tried, in vain, to use
> him for their political goals.
