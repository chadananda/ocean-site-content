Towards the end of the _Epistle to the Son of the Wolf_, Bahá'u'lláh quotes a number of Traditions of the prophet Muhammad regarding the city of Akka. I list and number these below in the order that they appear in the text and giving Shoghi Effendi's translation:  

> In this connection it hath been deemed necessary to mention such traditions as have been recorded regarding the blessed and honored city of Akka, that haply thou mayest, O Hadi, seek a path unto the Truth, and a road leading unto God.  
>   
> In the name of God, the Compassionate, the Merciful.  
>   
> The following hath been recorded concerning the merits of Akka, and of the sea, and of Aynu'l-Baqar (The Spring of the Cow) which is in Akka:  
>   
> 1\. Abdu'l-'Aziz, son of Abdu'-Salam, hath related unto us that the Prophet - may the blessings of God and His salutations be upon him - hath said: "Akka is a city in Syria to which God hath shown His special mercy."  
>   
> 2\. Ibn-i-Mas'ud - may God be pleased with him - hath stated: "The Prophet - may the blessings of God and His salutations be upon Him - hath said: 'Of all shores the best is the shore of Askelon, and Akka is, verily, better than Askelon, and the merit of Akka above that of Askelon and all other shores is as the merit of Muhammad above that of all other Prophets. I bring you tidings of a city betwixt two mountains in Syria, in the middle of a meadow, which is called Akka. Verily, he that entereth therein, longing for it and eager to visit it, God will forgive his sins, both of the past and of the future. And he that departeth from it, other than as a pilgrim, God will not bless his departure. In it is a spring called the Spring of the Cow. Whoso drinketh a draught therefrom, God will fill his heart with light, and will protect him from the most great terror on the Day of Resurrection.'"  
>   
> 3\. Anas, son of Malik - may God be pleased with him - hath said: "The Apostle of God - may the blessings of God and His salutations be upon Him - hath said: 'By the shore of the sea is a city, suspended beneath the Throne, and named Akka. He that dwelleth therein, firm and expecting a reward from God - exalted be He - God will write down for him, until the Day of Resurrection, the recompense of such as have been patient, and have stood up, and knelt down, and prostrated themselves, before Him.'"  
>   
> 4\. And He - may the blessings of God and His salutations be upon Him - hath said: "I announce unto you a city, on the shores of the sea, white, whose whiteness is pleasing unto God - exalted be He! It is called Akka. He that hath been bitten by one of its fleas is better, in the estimation of God, than he who hath received a grievous blow in the path of God. And he that raiseth therein the call to prayer, his voice will be lifted up unto Paradise. And he that remaineth therein for seven days in the face of the enemy, God will gather him with Khidr - peace be upon Him - and God will protect him from the most great terror on the Day of Resurrection."  
>   
> 5\. And He - may the blessings of God, - exalted be He - and His salutations be upon Him - hath said: "There are kings and princes in Paradise. The poor of Akka are the kings of Paradise and the princes thereof. A month in Akka is better than a thousand years elsewhere."  
>   
> 6\. The Apostle of God - may the blessings of God and His salutations be upon Him - is reported to have said: "Blessed the man that hath visited Akka, and blessed he that hath visited the visitor of Akka. Blessed the one that hath drunk from the Spring of the Cow and washed in its waters, for the black-eyed damsels quaff the camphor in Paradise, which hath come from the Spring of the Cow, and from the Spring of Salvan (Siloam), and the Well of Zamzam. Well is it with him that hath drunk from these springs, and washed in their waters, for God hath forbidden the fire of hell to touch him and his body on the Day of Resurrection."  
>   
> 7\. The Prophet - may the blessings of God and His salutations be upon Him - is stated to have said: "In Akka are works of supererogation and acts which are beneficial, which God vouchsafed specially unto whomsoever He pleaseth. And he that saith in Akka: 'Glorified be God, and praise be unto God, and there is none other God but God, and most great is God, and there is no power nor strength except in God, the Exalted, the Mighty,' God will write down for him a thousand good deeds, and blot out from him a thousand evil deeds, and will uplift him a thousand grades in Paradise, and will forgive him his transgressions. And whoso saith in Akka: 'I beg forgiveness of God,' God will forgive all his trespasses. And he that remembereth God in Akka at morn and at eventide, in the night-season and at dawn, is better in the sight of God than he who beareth swords, spears and arms in the path of God - exalted be He!"  
>   
> 8\. The Apostle of God - may the blessings of God and His salutations be upon Him - hath also said: "He that looketh upon the sea at eventide, and saith: 'God is Most Great!' at sunset, God will forgive his sins, though they be heaped as piles of sand. And he that counteth forty waves, while repeating: 'God is Most Great!' - exalted be He - God will forgive his sins, both past and future."  
>   
> 9\. The Apostle of God - may the blessings of God and His salutations be upon Him - hath said: "He that looketh upon the sea a full night is better than he who passeth two whole months betwixt the Rukn and the Maqam. And he that hath been brought up on the shores of the sea is better than he that hath been brought up elsewhere. And he that lieth on the shore is as he that standeth elsewhere."  
>   
> Verily, the Apostle of God - may the blessings of God, exalted be He, and His salutations be upon Him - hath spoken the truth. (Bahá'u'lláh: _Epistle to the Son of the Wolf_, pages 177-181)

  
  
In my book _Islam and the Bahá'í Faith,_ I have quoted a number of these Traditions which appear also in _Epistle to the Son of the Wolf_ about Akka. While I was writing the book I did a considerable amount of research to try to locate the source of these traditions. Unfortunately Muhammad 'Ali Faizi in his commentary on the _Epistle to the Son of the Wolf_ which is named _La'ali-yi Dirakhshan_ comments on the contents of these Traditions without giving ay opinion on the source of them (Tihran, 123 B.E., pp. 379-87).  
  
There were several factors indicating that the source of these Traditions was a work entitled _Fada'il a_sh_-_Sh_am wa Dima_sh_q_ by a Syrian scholar Abu'l-Hasan 'Ali ibn Muhammad ar-Ruba'i al-Maliki, known as Ibn Abi'l-Hawl, who died in 444Ah/1052AD. Ar-Ruba'i himself was a well-respected scholar resident in Damascus who had travelled to various parts of the Islamic world including Egypt and Mecca and had collected Traditions in these places. He is relied upon by many later authors including Ibn 'Asakir in his History of Damascus. The indications for this identification were as follows:  

> 1\. The Iraqi Bahá'í scholar Ahmad Hamdi Al-Muhammad (_Ad-Dalil wa'l-Ir_sh_ad_, 3rd printing, Matabi' al-Bayan, Beirut, 1966, pp. 166-9) quotes several of these Traditions and identifies the source as "Fada'il 'Akka wa Asqalan" from the book _"Fada'il a_sh_-_Sh_am wa Dimashq_ by Abu'l-Hasan ar-Ruba'i" (p. 167).  
>   
> 2\. The Iranian Bahá'í scholar Hisam Noghabai (_Bisharat Kutub Asmani_, 2nd edition, privately printed, pp. 183-6) quotes several of these Traditions and states that they are from Fada'il 'Akka wa Asqalan of Ibn Abi'l-Hawl" (p. 183).  
>   
> 3\. I made enquiries from the Bahá'í World Centre to see if they had a copy of this work by ar-Ruba'i and they sent a copy of a photocopy that they had received from Habibu'llah Derakhshani. It appears to be a manuscript or lithograph. On the first page is the title and author _Kitab Fada'il ash-Sham wa Dimashq_ compiled by Abu'l-Hasan 'Ali ibn Muhammad ibn Shuja' ar-Ruba'i al-Maliki, known as Ibn Abi'l-Hawl, from the oral transmission of Abu'l-Hasan 'Ali ibn Ahmad ibn Zuhayr al-Maliki. On the following sheets all of the Traditions that Bahá'u'lláh quotes appear (except the first) and they appear almost in the same order as in the _Epistle to the Son of the Wolf_. There are minor textual variations (see analysis of this at the end of this paper). On looking at the photocopies, however, it becomes clear that Mr Derakhshani had taken the title page and one further page from the work and then gone straight on to the pages relating to Akka which occupy pp. 3-23 and then he has added the final page. He has numbered these consecutively but it is clear they are not consecutive.  
>   
> 4\. I discovered that a manuscript of _Fada'il a_sh_-_Sh_am wa Dima_sh_q_ by ar-Ruba'i existed in the library of Nur Ahmadiyya Madrassa attached to the al-Jazzar Mosque in Akka - see 'Abdu'llah Mukhlis, "Majmu' Nadir" in _La Revue de l'Academie Arabe_, vol. 10, no. 9-10 (Sept. - Oct. 1930), pp. 577-83. This would give a means for Bahá'u'lláh to have had access to the work.

  
  
Of course the final piece of evidence that would be needed would be to locate a copy of ar-Ruba'i's _Fada'il a_sh_-_Sh_am wa Dima_sh_q_ in order to confirm that the relevant Traditions are indeed in that book. This proved difficult. The current published version of the book (4th ed., Beirut: al-Maktab al-Islami, 1405) does not have these Traditions but turns out, on closer examination, to be extracts from the _Fada'il a_sh_-_Sh_am wa Dima_sh_q_, an abbreviated version of the book by Shaykh Muhammad Nasir ad-Din al-Albani. I tried to obtain an older 1951 publication of the book which is mentioned in the introduction to the above edition, but was unable to obtain a copy despite making enquiries from book-dealers in Lebanon and elsewhere.  
  
Manuscripts of this work appeared to be equally difficult to locate. Various manuscripts that exist are of other abbreviated versions of this work. Three manuscripts in Germany are of Burhan ad-Din Ibrahim ibn Taj ad-Din 'Abd ar-Rahman al-Fazari's abridgement of this work (Brockelmann, Geschichte, p. 331 - copies in Berlin, no. 6074, Gotha, no. 54/21, Tubingen Wetzst, no. 26/2; see also W. Ahlwardt, _Verzeichniss der Arabischer Handschriften der Koniglicher Bibliotek zu Berlin_, Berlin: A. Asher & Co, 1893, vol. 15, p. 391, no. 6074). The only definite manuscripts of the work that I was able to locate were described in the following two publications:  

1.  The manuscript in the Nur Ahmadiyya Madrassa attached to the al-Jazzar Mosque in Akka - see above  
      
    
2.  A copy in the library of the Aya Sophia mosque in Istanbul, mss no. 3340/1 - described in Felix Tauer, "Geographisches aus den Stambuler Bibliotheken (Arabische Handschriften)", _Archiv Orientalni_, vol. 6 (1934), pp. 95-6.

  
  
Unfortunately, access to neither of these manuscripts was available immediately. It was at this point that I needed to come to a decision about the source of these Traditions for publication in my book, _Islam and the Bahá'í Faith_. I decided to identify the source of the Traditions as _Fada'il a_sh_-_Sh_am wa Dima_sh_q_ by ar-Ruba'i. Since the Haifa photocopies were very clearly written and there was an elaborate title page, I identified this as pages from a "an old lithographed edition of this work that does not show a date of publication and has no page numbers." This proved an unfortunate decision as even before the book was published, but too late to make any alteration in the text, I discovered that my conclusions were erroneous. A closer reading of some of the material that I had as well as some new material revealed several pieces of information that contradicted my conclusions:  

1.  I found that the photocopy document sent to Haifa by Mr Derakhshani contained two dates when the author had heard these Traditions. The writer states that he heard these Traditions from Baha ad-Din Abu Muhammad al-Qasim ibn Abu'l-Qasim 'Ali ibn al-Hasan ibn Hibatullah ibn 'Abdu'llah ash-Shafi'i in Damascus in 581 and 585. Since these dates were more than a century after the death of ar-Ruba'i in 444AH/1052AD, it would appear to rule out the latter as the author.  
      
    
2.  I was informed by Necati Alkan that a copy of a printed version of ar-Ruba'i's book was in the SOAS library. I went there and found that this was the older 1951 edition (ed. S. Munajjid, Matbu'at al-Jami' al-'Ilmi al-'Arabi bi Dimashq, Damascus) and appeared to be the complete text and did not contain a section with these Akka Traditions in it. This book gave a third location for a manuscript of this work - the Dar al-Kutub az-Zahiriyya in Damascus.  
      
    
3.  A closer reading of the above article by Felix Tauer on the Istanbul manuscript revealed that this manuscript was in a compilation manuscript with several other works. Ar-Ruba'i's _Fada'il ash-Sham wa Dimashq_ was the first item (fol. 1-83) and the seventh work in the compilation was named as _Fada'il 'Akka wa 'Asqalan_ (fol. 215-225). The opening and closing words of the volume as given by Tauer correspond exactly with the Derakhshani photocopy. Tauer gives no indication of the author of this piece and since the other items in the compilation are by various authors or anonymous, there is no contextual evidence in the compilation for authorship. The whole compilation was written out in Dhu'l Qa'da 921 AH by a certain 'Abd al-Rahman as-Salihi ibn Muhammad in the Ummayad Mosque \[in Damascus\].

  
  
This seemed sufficient evidence to be now certain that the _Fada'il 'Akka wa 'Asqalan_ was a separate work composed about 140 years after ar-Ruba'i's _Fada'il ash-Sham wa Dimashq_ and therefore certainly not by ar-Ruba'i himself. A further reading of the Derakhshani photocopies revealed that they were most likely actual copies of the Aya Sophia manuscript described by Tauer. This for the following reasons:  

1.  On the front page of the Derakhshani photocopies, there was some writing in the top left hand corner. It looks somewhat like two capital Fs followed by the Arabic numeral 40. I now realised that this was probably the number 3340, which of course is the number of the Aya Sophia manuscript described by Tauer.  
      
    
2.  Tauer describes what is written on the title page of the manuscript and it accords exactly with the Derakhshani photocopies.  
      
    
3.  Tauer describes what is written at the end of the compilation - i.e. that it was written in Dhu'l Qa'da 921 AH by a certain 'Abd al-Rahman as-Salihi ibn Muhammad in the Ummayad Mosque \[in Damascus\] - and this corresponds exactly to the last page of the Derakhshani photocopies.

  
  
Thus we may be reasonably certain that the Derakhshani photocopies are copied from the Aya Sophia mss. no. 3340. I also learned that the Derakhshani photocopies were a small booklet that had been published in Tihran, but I was unabale to discover who had published it.  
  
It was obviously now necessary to try to ascertain the authorship of the _Fada'il 'Akka wa 'Asqalan_. The opening words of the work state that these Traditions were heard from al-Hafiz Baha ad-Din Abu Muhammad al-Qasim ibn Abu'l-Qasim 'Ali ibn al-Hasan ibn Hibatullah ibn 'Abdullah ash-Shafi'i in 581 and 585 in Damascus and that he heard them from Abu al-Barakat al-Khidr ibn Shibl al-faqih.  
  
Baha ad-Din Abu Muhammad al-Qasim ibn Abu'l-Qasim 'Ali ibn al-Hasan ibn Hibatullah ibn 'Abdullah ash-Shafi'i can be identified as the son of the much more famous Ibn 'Asakir, who is described as the leading compiler of Traditions of his age ("imam ahl al-hadith fi zamanihi", 'Abd al-Qadir an-Na'imi, _ad-Darus fi Tarikh al-Madaris_, Matbu'at al-Jami' al-'Ilmi al-'Arabi bi Dimashq, vol. 1, 1367/1948, p. 100). He was the author of the very well known, _Tarikh Dimashq_ (History of Damascus), the first part of which contains a compilation of prophetic Traditions relating to Syria in general and Damascus in particular (much of which comes from ar-Ruba'i's _Fada'il ash-Sham wa Dimashq_ as noted above). Baha ad-Din al-Qasim ibn 'Asakir himself was born in 527. He was a prominent scholar of his generation and known as being reliable as a compiler of Traditions. He succeeded his father as the head of the college, Dar al-Hadith an-Nuriyya on the latter's death in 571. He gave lectures on his father's History of Damascus and himself compiled a book of Traditions relating to Jerusalem and the Masjid al-Aqsa called _al-Muqtaa fi Fada'il al-Masjid al-Aqsa_. He died in 600 AH. (Biographical information from 'Abd al-Qadir an-Na'imi, _ad-Darus fi Tarikh al-Madaris_, Matbu'at al-Jami' al-'Ilmi al-'Arabi bi Dimashq, vol. 1, 1367/1948, p. 100-3.)  
  
It would appear that the compiler of the _Fada'il 'Akka wa 'Asqalan_ was a student of Baha ad-Din al-Qasim ibn 'Asakir who heard these particular Traditions from him during the years 581 and 585 in Damascus. Interestingly, we know that Baha ad-Din al-Qasim visited 'Akka and taught some classes there in 586. This is because there is a record of one of his students Badhal ibn Abi al-Mu'ammar at-Tabrizi taking notes of his teaching his father's book in 'Akka that year (_Tarikh Madina Dimashq_, ed. Salah ad-Din al-Munjid, Matbu'at al-Jami' al-'Ilmi al-'Arabi bi Dimashq, Damascus, 1371/1951, vol. 1, p. 629).  
  
The period of time in which _Fada'il 'Akka wa 'Asqalan_ was written was a time in which there was a great deal of activity in the compiling of traditions about particular cities and regions. These compilations of prophetic Traditions were often compiled under the name "Fada'il . . .", which can be translated as "The Excellences of . . ." These volumes would consist of Traditions of the prophet Muhammad regarding that city and sometimes also material relating to shrines and sacred sites there, companions of the Prophet who are buried there and famous 'ulama who have lived there. Baha ad-Din al-Qasim ibn 'Asakir himself as we have noted compiled such a work on Jerusalem - _al-Muqtaa fi Fada'il al-Masjid al-Aqsa_. His father included such material in the first part of his History of Damascus. Several of Baha ad-Din al-Qasim ibn 'Asakir's students also compiled such works and any of these could also have been the compiler of _Fada'il 'Akka wa 'Asqalan_ (these students are based on the list given in an-Na'imi, _ad-Darus fi Tarikh al-Madaris_, vol. 1, p. 103):  

> Diya ad-Din Muhammad ibn 'Abdu'l-Wahid al-Maqdisi (d. 643) wrote _Fada'il ash-Sham_ on Damascus (Khayr ad-Din Zirikli, _al-A'lam_, 2nd ed., Cairo, 1954-9, 10 vols, vol. 7, p. 134; Brockelmann, Supplement, vol. 1, p.690)  
>   
> Abu al-Muwahhib al-Hasan ibn Hibatullah Sasri ar-Ruba'i wrote _Fada'il Bayt al-Muqaddas_ about Jerusalem (Zirikli, _al-A'lam_, vol. 2, p. 304)  
>   
> 'Abd al-Qadir ibn 'Abdullah ar-Ruhawi (d. 612) wrote a compilation of forty traditions (Zirikli, _al-A'lam_, vol. 4, p. 165)

  
  
Among others who are known to have been students of Baha ad-Din al-Qasim ibn 'Asakir and therefore possible compilers of _Fada'il 'Akka wa 'Asqalan_ are:  

> Zayn al-'Umana Abu al-Barakat al-Hasan ibn Muhammad ibn 'Asakir (d. 627), a cousin of Baha ad-Din al-Qasim and his successor as head of the Dar al-Hadith an-Nuriyya (an-Na'imi, _ad-Darus fi Tarikh al-Madaris_, vol. 1, pp. 104-5).  
>   
> Taj ad-Din 'Abd al-Wahhab ibn Zayn al-Umana (d. 660), son of the previous scholar and his successor as head of the Dar al-Hadith an-Nuriyya. (an-Na'imi, _ad-Darus fi Tarikh al-Madaris_, vol. 1, pp. 106-6. His brother 'Abdu'llah Nizam ad-Din wrote _Fada'il al-Quds_ on Jerusalem, Brockelmann _Supplement_ vol. 1, p. 568)  
>   
> Yusuf ibn Khalil ibn Qaraja (d. 648, Zirikli, _al-A'lam_, vol. 7, p. 253-4)

  
  
Indeed a listing of more than fifty names of students of Baha ad-Din al-Qasim could be compiled from the lists of those attending his lectures (see lists in Ibn 'Asakir _Tarikh Madina Dimashq_, see for example vol. 1, pp. 627-717)  
  
The following is a comparison between the Traditions given in _Epistle to the Son of the Wolf_ (illuminated ed. Hofheim-Langenhain, 1982) and the Traditions given in the Aya Sophia manuscript:  
  

| Description of the Tradition | _Epistle to the Son of the Wolf_ | Fada'il 'Akka wa 'Asqalan |

 |
| And He - may the blessings of God, - exalted be He - and His salutations be upon Him - hath said: "There are kings and princes in Paradise.

'Umar ibn al-Khattab addressed Ka'b al-Ahbar, saying to him: I bring you good news, O Abu Ishaq! When you enter Syria and meet the people of 'Akka, help them for they are the ones who will be looked to on the Day of Resurrection. O Abu Ishaq! I heard the Messenger of Allah (may the peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) say that there will be kings and princes at the Last Days, and the poor of 'Akka and Askalon will be the kings and princes of the Last Days.

The above comparison seems to me to indicate that Bahá'u'lláh was indeed quoting from this work but from another manuscript that had differences due to transcription variations. Not only the close resemblance of the text of the Traditions indicates this but also, perhaps more significantly, the fact that the Traditions are almost in exactly the same order in both texts.  
  
  
It is surprising that Bahá'u'lláh does not cite the much more well-known Tradition "Well is it with him who hath seen Akka" which is recorded in many books including the celebrated geography of Yaqut ibn 'Abdullah in his entry on Akka (_Mu'jam al-Buldan_, Matba'a as-Sa'ada, Cairo, 1324/1906, vol. 6, p. 206) and in many dictionaries such as the _Mukhtar as-Sihah_ of Muhammad ibn Abu Bakr ar-Razi in the entry under 'ayn kaf kaf (ed. Mahmud Khatir, Cairo: al-Hay'ah al-Misriyyah al-'Ammah li'l-Kitab, 1976, p. 449) and the _Lisan al-'Arab_ of Ibn Manzur, also under 'ayn kaf kaf (Beirut: Dar Sadir, 1956, vol. 10, p. 470).


        The ‘Akká Traditions in the Epistle to the Son of the Wolf
A Research Note

Moojan Momen

owards the end of the Epistle to the Son of the Wolf, Bahá’u’lláh quotes a number of

T     Traditions of the Prophet Mu˙ammad regarding the city of ‘Akká. I list and number these

below in the order that they appear in the text and giving Shoghi Effendi’s translation:
In this connection it hath been deemed necessary to mention such traditions as have been
recorded regarding the blessed and honored city of ‘Akká, that haply thou mayest, O Hadi, seek
a path unto the Truth, and a road leading unto God.

> In the name of God, the Compassionate, the Merciful.

The following hath been recorded concerning the merits of ‘Akká, and of the sea, and of
Aynu’l-Baqar (The Spring of the Cow) which is in ‘Akká:
1.   ‘Abdu’l-‘Azíz, son of Abdu’-Salam, hath related unto us that the Prophet—may the

> blessings of God and His salutations be upon him—hath said: “‘Akká is a city in Syria
> to which God hath shown His special mercy.”
2.   Ibn-i-Mas’ud—may God be pleased with him—hath stated: “The Prophet—may the

> blessings of God and His salutations be upon Him—hath said: ‘Of all shores the best
> is the shore of Askelon, and ‘Akká is, verily, better than Askelon, and the merit of
> ‘Akká above that of Askelon and all other shores is as the merit of Mu˙ammad
> above that of all other Prophets. I bring you tidings of a city betwixt two mountains
> in Syria, in the middle of a meadow, which is called ‘Akká. Verily, he that entereth
> therein, longing for it and eager to visit it, God will forgive his sins, both of the past
> and of the future. And he that departeth from it, other than as a pilgrim, God will
> not bless his departure. In it is a spring called the Spring of the Cow. Whoso drin-
> keth a draught therefrom, God will fill his heart with light, and will protect him
> from the most great terror on the Day of Resurrection.’”
3.   Anas, son of Malik—may God be pleased with him—hath said: “The Apostle of God—

> may the blessings of God and His salutations be upon Him—hath said: ‘By the shore
> of the sea is a city, suspended beneath the Throne, and named ‘Akká. He that
> dwelleth therein, firm and expecting a reward from God—exalted be He—God will
> write down for him, until the Day of Resurrection, the recompense of such as have
> been patient, and have stood up, and knelt down, and prostrated themselves, before
> Him.’”
4.   And He—may the blessings of God and His salutations be upon Him—hath said: “I

> announce unto you a city, on the shores of the sea, white, whose whiteness is pleas-
> ing unto God—exalted be He! It is called ‘Akká. He that hath been bitten by one of
> its fleas is better, in the estimation of God, than he who hath received a grievous

Lights of ‘Irfán Book Four

> blow in the path of God. And he that raiseth therein the call to prayer, his voice will
> be lifted up unto Paradise. And he that remaineth therein for seven days in the face
> of the enemy, God will gather him with Khi∂r—peace be upon Him—and God will
> protect him from the most great terror on the Day of Resurrection.”
5.   And He—may the blessings of God—exalted be He—and His salutations be upon

> Him—hath said: “There are kings and princes in Paradise. The poor of ‘Akká are the
> kings of Paradise and the princes thereof. A month in ‘Akká is better than a thou-
> sand years elsewhere.”
6.   The Apostle of God—may the blessings of God and His salutations be upon Him—

> is reported to have said: “Blessed the man that hath visited ‘Akká, and blessed he that
> hath visited the visitor of ‘Akká. Blessed the one that hath drunk from the Spring of
> the Cow and washed in its waters, for the black-eyed damsels quaff the camphor in
> Paradise, which hath come from the Spring of the Cow, and from the Spring of
> Salvan (Siloam), and the Well of Zamzam. Well is it with him that hath drunk from
> these springs, and washed in their waters, for God hath forbidden the fire of hell to
> touch him and his body on the Day of Resurrection.”
7    The Prophet—may the blessings of God and His salutations be upon Him—is stated

> to have said: “In ‘Akká are works of supererogation and acts which are beneficial,
> which God vouchsafed specially unto whomsoever He pleaseth. And he that saith in
> ‘Akká: ‘Glorified be God, and praise be unto God, and there is none other God but

> out from him a thousand evil deeds, and will uplift him a thousand grades in
> Paradise, and will forgive him his transgressions. And whoso saith in ‘Akká: ‘I beg
> forgiveness of God,’ God will forgive all his trespasses. And he that remembereth
> God in ‘Akká at morn and at eventide, in the night-season and at dawn, is better in
> the sight of God than he who beareth swords, spears and arms in the path of God—
> exalted be He!”
8.   The Apostle of God—may the blessings of God and His salutations be upon Him—

> hath also said: “He that looketh upon the sea at eventide, and saith: ‘God is Most
> Great!’ at sunset, God will forgive his sins, though they be heaped as piles of sand.
> And he that counteth forty waves, while repeating: ‘God is Most Great!’—exalted be
> He—God will forgive his sins, both past and future.”
9.   The Apostle of God—may the blessings of God and His salutations be upon Him—

> hath said: “He that looketh upon the sea a full night is better than he who passeth
> two whole months betwixt the Rukn and the Maqam. And he that hath been brought

> And he that lieth on the shore is as he that standeth elsewhere.”
> Verily, the Apostle of God—may the blessings of God, exalted be He, and His salu-
> tations be upon Him—hath spoken the truth. (Bahá’u’lláh: Epistle to the Son of the
> Wolf, pages 177-181)
In my book Islam and the Bahá’í Faith, I have quoted a number of these Traditions regard-
ing ‘Akká. While I was writing the book I did a considerable amount of research to try to locate
the source of these traditions. There were several factors indicating that the source of these
Traditions was a work entitled Fa∂á’il ash-Shám wa Dimashq by a Syrian scholar Abu’l-Óasan
‘Alí ibn Mu˙ammad ar-Ruba’í al-Málikí, known as Ibn Abi’l-Hawl, who died in

\[168\] ‘Akká Traditions in the Epistle to the Son of the Wolf

444AH/1052AD. Ar-Ruba’í himself was a well-respected scholar resident in Damascus who had
travelled to various parts of the Islamic world including Egypt and Mecca and had collected
Traditions in these places. He is relied upon by many later authors including Ibn ‘Asákir in his
History of Damascus. The indications for this identification were as follows:
1.   The Iraqi Bahá’í scholar A˙mad Hamdí al-Mu˙ammad ( Ad-Dalíl wa’l-Irshád, 3rd

> printing, Matábi’ al-Bayán, Beirut, 1966, pp. 166-9) quotes several of these
> Traditions and identifies the source as “Fa∂á’il ‘Akká wa Asqalán” from the book
> “Fa∂á’il ash-Shám wa Dimashq by Abu’l-Óasan ar-Ruba’í” (p. 167).
2.   The Iranian Bahá’í scholar Hisam Noghabai ( Bishárát Kutub Ásmání, 2nd edition,

> privately printed, pp. 183-6) quotes several of these Traditions and states that they
> are from “Fa∂á’il ‘Akká wa Asqalán of Ibn Abi’l-Hawl” (p. 183).
3.   I made enquiries from the Bahá’í World Centre to see if they had a copy of this work

> by ar-Ruba’í and they sent a copy of a photocopy that they had received from
> Habibu’llah Derakhshání that has a date on it which may be 127 (i.e. 1970). It
> appears to be a manuscript or lithograph. On the first page is the title and author
> Kitáb Fadá’il ash-Shám wa Dimashq compiled by Abu’l-Óasan ‘Alí ibn Mu˙ammad
> ibn Shujá‘ ar-Ruba’í al-Málikí, known as Ibn Abi’l-Hawl, from the oral transmission
> of Abu’l-Óasan ‘Alí ibn A˙mad ibn Zuhayr al-Málikí. On the following sheets all of
> the Traditions that Bahá’u’lláh quotes appear (except the first) and they appear
> almost in the same order as in the Epistle to the Son of the Wolf. There are minor
> textual variations (see analysis of this at the end of this paper). On looking at the
> photocopies, however, it becomes clear that the compiler of this item had taken the
> title page and one further page from the work and then gone straight on to the pages
> relating to ‘Akká which occupy pp. 3-23 and then he has added the final page. He has
> numbered these consecutively but it is clear they are not consecutive.
4.   I discovered that a manuscript of Fa∂á’il ash-Shám wa Dimashq by ar-Ruba’í exist-

> ed in the library of Núr A˙madiyya Madrassa attached to the al-Jazzár Mosque in
> ‘Akká—see ‘Abdu’lláh Mukhlis, “Majmú‘ Nádir” in La Revue de l’Academie Arabe,
> vol. 10, no. 9-10 (Sept.–Oct. 1930), pp. 577-83. This would give a means for
> Bahá’u’lláh to have had access to the work.
Of course the final piece of evidence that would be needed would be to locate a copy of ar-
Ruba’í’s Fa∂á’il ash-Shám wa Dimashq in order to confirm that the relevant Traditions are
indeed in that book. This proved difficult. The current published version of the book (4th ed.,
Beirut: al-Maktab al-Islamí, 1405) does not have these Traditions but turns out, on closer
examination, to be extracts from the Fa∂á’il ash-Shám wa Dimashq, an abbreviated version of
the book by Shaykh Mu˙ammad Násir ad-Dín al-Albání. I tried to obtain an older 1950 publi-
cation of the book which is mentioned in the introduction to the above edition, but was unable
to obtain a copy despite making enquiries from book-dealers in Lebanon and elsewhere.

Manuscripts of this work appeared to be equally difficult to locate. Various manuscripts that
exist are of other abbreviated versions of this work. Three manuscripts in Germany are of
Burhán ad-Dín Ibrahim ibn Taj ad-Dín ‘Abd ar-Ra˙mán al-Fazárí’s abridgement of this work
(Brockelmann, Geschichte, p. 331—copies in Berlin, no. 6074, Gotha, no. 54/21, Tubingen
Wetzst, no. 26/2; see also W. Ahlwardt, Verzeichniss der Arabisched Handschriften der
Konigliched Bibliohtek zu Berlin, Berlin: A. Asher & Co, 1893, vol. 15, p. 391, no. 6074). The
only definite manuscripts of the work that I was able to locate were described in the following
two publications:

Lights of ‘Irfán Book Four

1.   The manuscript in the Núr A˙madiyya Madrassa attached to the al-Jazzár Mosque in

‘Akká—see above
2.   A copy in the library of the Aya Sophia mosque in Istanbul, mss no. 3340/1—

> described in Felix Tauer, “Geographisches aus den Stambuler Bibliotheken (Arabische
> Handschriften)”, Archiv Orientalni, vol. 6 (1934), pp. 95-6.
Unfortunately, access to neither of these manuscripts was available immediately. It was at this
point that I needed to come to a decision about the source of these Traditions for publication
in my book, Islam and the Bahá’í Faith. I decided to identify the source of the Traditions as
Fa∂á’il ash-Shám wa Dimashq by ar-Ruba’í. Since the Haifa photocopies were very clearly writ-
ten and there was an elaborate title page, I identified this as pages from a “an old lithographed
edition of this work that does not show a date of publication and has no page numbers.” This
proved an unfortunate decision as even before the book was published, but too late to make
any alteration in the text, I discovered that my conclusions were erroneous. A closer reading of
some of the material that I had as well as some new material revealed several pieces of infor-
mation that contradicted my conclusions:
1.   I found that the photocopy document sent to Haifa by Mr. Derakhshani contained

> two dates when the author had heard these Traditions. The writer states that he heard
> these Traditions from Bahá ad-Dín Abu Mu˙ammad al-Qásim ibn Abu’l-Qásim ‘Alí
> ibn al-Óasan ibn Hibatulláh ibn ‘Abdu’lláh ash-Shafi’í in Damascus in 581 and 585.
> Since these dates were more than a century after the death of ar-Ruba’í in
> 444AH/1052AD, it would appear to rule out the latter as the author.
2.   I was informed by Necati Alkan that a copy of a printed version of ar-Ruba’í’s book

> was in the SOAS library. I went there and found that this was the older 1951 edition
> (ed. S. Munajjid, Matbú’át al-Jámi’ al-‘Ilmí al-‘Arabí bi Dimashq, Damascus) and
> appeared to be the complete text and did not contain a section with these ‘Akká
> Traditions in it. This book gave a third location for a manuscript of this work—the
> Dár al-Kutub az-Záhiriyya in Damascus.
3.   A closer reading of the above article by Felix Tauer on the Istanbul manuscript

> revealed that this manuscript was in a compilation manuscript with several other
> works. Ar-Ruba’í’s Fa∂á’il ash-Sham wa Dimashq was the first item (fol. 1-83) and the
> seventh work in the compilation was named as Fa∂á’il ‘Akká wa ‘Asqalán (fol. 215-
> 225). The opening and closing words of the volume as given by Tauer correspond
> exactly with the Derakhshani photocopy. Tauer gives no indication of the author of
> the piece about ‘Akká and Askelon and since the other items in the compilation are
> by various authors or anonymous, there is no contextual evidence in the compilation
> for authorship. The whole compilation was written out in Dhu’l Qa’da 921 AH by a
> certain ‘Abd al-Rahmán aß-Íáli˙í ibn Mu˙ammad in the Ummayad Mosque [in
> Damascus].
This seemed sufficient evidence to be now certain that the Fa∂á’il ‘Akká wa ‘Asqalán was a
separate work composed about 140 years after ar-Ruba’í’s Fa∂á’il ash-Sham wa Dimashq and
therefore certainly not by ar-Ruba’í himself. A further reading of the Derakhshani photocopies
revealed that they were most likely actual photographic copies of the Aya Sophia manuscript
described by Tauer. This for the following reasons:
1.   On the front page of the Derakhshani photocopies, there was some writing in the

> top left hand corner. It looks somewhat like two capital “F”s followed by the Arabic
> numeral 40. I now realised that this was probably the number 3340, which of course

\[170\] ‘Akká Traditions in the Epistle to the Son of the Wolf

is the number of the Aya Sophia manuscript described by Tauer.
2.   Tauer describes what is written on the title page of the manuscript and it accords

exactly with the Derakhshani photocopies.
3.   Tauer describes what is written at the end of the compilation—i.e. that it was writ-

> ten in Dhu’l Qa’da 921 AH by a certain ‘Abd al-Rahmán aß-Íáli˙í ibn Mu˙ammad
> in the Ummayad Mosque [in Damascus]—and this corresponds exactly to the last page
> of the Derakhshani photocopies.
Thus we may be reasonably certain that the Derakhshani photocopies are copied from the Aya
Sophia mss. no. 3340.

It was obviously now necessary to try to ascertain the authorship of the Fa∂á’il ‘Akká wa
‘Asqalán. The opening words of the work state that these Traditions were heard from al-HáfiΩ
Bahá ad-Dín Abú Mu˙ammad al-Qásim ibn Abu’l-Qásim ‘Ali ibn al-Óasan ibn Hibatullah ibn
‘Abdullah ash-Shafi’í in 581 and 585 in Damascus and that he heard them from Abu al-Barakát
al-Khi∂r ibn Shibl al-faqíh.

Bahá ad-Dín Abú Mu˙ammad al-Qásim ibn Abu’l-Qásim ‘Alí ibn al-Óasan ibn Hibatullah
ibn ‘Abdullah ash-Shafi’í can be identified as the son of the much more famous Ibn ‘Asákir, who
is described as the leading compiler of Traditions of his age (“imám ahl al-˙adith fi zamanihi ”,
‘Abd al-Qádir an-Na’ ímí, ad-Dárus fí Taríkh al-Madaris, Matbú’át al-Jámi’ al-‘Ilmí al-‘Arabí bi
Dimashq, vol. 1, 1367/1948, p. 100). He was the author of the very well known, Tarikh Dimashq
(History of Damascus), the first part of which contains a compilation of prophetic Traditions
relating to Syria in general and Damascus in particular (much of which comes from ar-Ruba’í’s
Fa∂á’il ash-Sham wa Dimashq as noted above). Bahá ad-Dín al-Qásim ibn ‘Asákir himself was
born in 527. He was a prominent scholar of his generation and known as being reliable as a
compiler of Traditions. He succeeded his father as the head of the college, Dár al-Óadíth an-
Núriyya on the latter’s death in 571. He gave lectures on his father’s History of Damascus and
himself compiled a book of Traditions relating to Jerusalem and the Masjid al-Aqßá called al-
Muqtáá fi Fadá’il al-Masjid al-Aqßá. He died in 600 AH. (Biographical information from ‘Abd
al-Qádir an-Na‘ímí, ad-Dárus fí Taríkh al-Madaris, Matbú‘át al-Jámi’ al-‘Ilmí al-‘Arabí bi
Dimashq, vol. 1, 1367/1948, p. 100-3.)

It would appear that the compiler of the Fa∂á’il ‘Akká wa ‘Asqalán was a student of Bahá
ad-Dín al-Qásim ibn ‘Asákir who heard these particular Traditions from him during the years
581 and 585 in Damascus. Interestingly, we know that Bahá ad-Dín al-Qásim visited ‘Akká and
taught some classes there in 586. This is because there is a record of one of his students Badhal
ibn Abi al-Mu’ammar at-Tabrízí taking notes of his teaching his father’s book in ‘Akká that year
( Taríkh Madína Dimashq, ed. Íala˙ ad-Dín al-Munjid, Matbú’át al-Jámi’ al-‘Ilmí al-‘Arabí bi
Dimashq, Damascus, 1371/1951, vol. 1, p. 629).

The period of time in which Fa∂á’il ‘Akká wa ‘Asqalán was written was a time in which there
was a great deal of activity in the compiling of traditions about particular cities and regions.
These compilations of prophetic Traditions were often compiled under the name “Fa∂á’il . . .”,
which can be translated as “The Excellences of . . . .” These volumes would consist of Traditions
of the prophet Muhammad regarding that city and sometimes also material relating to shrines
and sacred sites there, companions of the Prophet who are buried there and famous ‘ulamá who
have lived there. Bahá ad-Dín al-Qásim ibn ‘Asákir himself, as we have noted, compiled such a
work on Jerusalem—al-Muqta∂á fi Fadá’il al-Masjid al-Aqßá. His father included such materi-
al in the first part of his History of Damascus. Several of Bahá ad-Dín al-Qásim ibn ‘Asákir’s
students also compiled such works and any of these could also have been the compiler of

about Jerusalem (Ziriklí, al-A‘lám, vol. 2, p. 304)

‘Abd al-Qádir ibn ‘Abdulláh ar-Ruháwí (d. 612) wrote a compilation of forty traditions
(Ziriklí, al-A‘lám, vol. 4, p. 165)

Among others who are known to have been students of Bahá ad-Dín al-Qásim ibn ‘Asákir
and therefore possible compilers of Fa∂á’il ‘Akká wa ‘Asqalán are:

Zayn al-‘Umaná Abu al-Barakát al-Hasan ibn Muhammad ibn ‘Asákir (d. 627), a cousin of
Bahá ad-Dín al-Qásim and his successor as head of the Dár al-Óadíth an-Núriyya (an-Na’ímí,
ad-Dárus fí Taríkh al-Madaris, vol. 1, pp. 104-5).

Táj ad-Dín ‘Abd al-Wahháb ibn Zayn al-Umaná (d. 660), son of the previous scholar and his
successor as head of the Dár al-Óadíth an-Núriyya. (an-Na’ímí, ad-Dárus fí Taríkh al-Madaris,
vol. 1, pp. 106-6. His brother ‘Abdu’llah NiΩám ad-Dín, who probably also studied under Bahá
ad-Dín al-Qásim wrote Fa∂á’il al-Quds on Jerusalem, Brockelmann Supplement vol. 1, p. 568)

> Yusuf ibn Khalíl ibn Qarájá (d. 648, Ziriklí, al-A‘lám, vol. 7, p. 253-4)
> Indeed a listing of more than fifty names of students of Bahá ad-Dín al-Qásim could be
compiled from the lists of those attending his lectures (see lists in Ibn ‘Asákir Taríkh Madína
Dimashq, see for example vol. 1, pp. 627-717)

In considering the identity of this work, Fa∂á’il ‘Akká wa ‘Asqalán, as a source for the
Traditions quoted by Bahá’u’lláh, it is useful to compare the text and the order of these tradi-
tions as given in the manuscript of Fa∂á’il ‘Akká wa ‘Asqalán and by Bahá’u’lláh in Epistle to
the Son of the Wolf. The following is a comparison between the Traditions given in Epistle to
the Son of the Wolf (illuminated ed. Hofheim-Langenhain, 1982) and the Traditions given in
the Ayá Sophia manuscript:

\[176\] ‘Akká Traditions in the Epistle to the Son of the Wolf

The above comparison seems to me to indicate that Bahá’u’lláh was indeed quoting from this
work but from another manuscript that had differences due to transcription variations. Not
only the close resemblance of the text of the Traditions indicates this but also, perhaps more
significantly, the fact that the Traditions are in almost exactly the same order in both texts.

It is surprising that Bahá’u’lláh does not cite the much more well-known Tradition “Well is it
with him who hath seen ‘Akká” which is recorded in many books including the celebrated geog-
raphy of Yáqút ibn ‘Abdulláh in his entry on ‘Akká ( Mu‘jam al-Buldán, Ma†ba’a as-Sa’áda,
Cairo, 1324/1906, vol. 6, p. 206) and in many dictionaries such as the Mukhtár aß-Íi˙á˙ of
Muhammad ibn Abú Bakr ar-Rází in the entry under “ayn káf káf” (ed. Ma˙múd Khá†ir,
Cairo: al-Hay’Ah al-Misriyyah al-‘Ámmah li’l-Kitáb, 1976, p. 449) and the Lisán al-‘Arab of Ibn
Manzúr, also under “ayn káf káf” (Beirut: Dár Íádir, 1956, vol. 10, p. 470).

In conclusion then, the ‘Akká traditions quoted by Bahá’u’lláh at the end of Epistle to the
Son of the Wolf probably came from a work named Fa∂á’il ‘Akká wa ‘Asqalán. This work was
compiled in the late 6th century C.E. based on Traditions transmitted by Bahá ad-Dín Abú
Mu˙ammad al-Qásim, the son of the famous historian Ibn ‘Asákir, in lectures that he gave in
Damascus in 581 and 585 C.E. The compiler was one of the students of Bahá ad-Dín al-Qásim.
