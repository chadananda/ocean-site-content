## The Press as a Consultative Forum: A Contribution to Normative Press Theory

### by [Michael Karlberg](https://bahai-library.com/author/Michael+Karlberg)

published in [_Bahá'í Studies Review_](https://bahai-library.com/series/BSR), 16, pages 29-42  
Bristol, UK: Intellect, Ltd., 2010-04


> **Abstract:** The contemporary press has, in many countries, evolved into a discursive battlefield characterized by a war of words and images. Against this backdrop, some normative theorists of the press assert the need for alternative models of journalistic practice in which the press serves as a forum for more thoughtful and constructive processes of democratic deliberation. As a contribution to the field of normative press theory, this paper articulates a model of the press that derives from the teachings of the Bahá'í Faith. At the core of this model are the principles and objectives of consultation, which is a collective decision-making process that Bahá'ís employ. This paper explores elements of this normative model of the press, which are scattered throughout a wide range of primary Bahá'í texts, in order to bring the model into clearer focus. The purpose of the paper is to highlight the heuristic value of the model for press theorists and practitioners, inside and outside the Bahá'í community.

(para. 209).               consultation at the monthly feast.

Of course, the line between exploratory and advisory forms of consulta-
> tion is not clearly demarcated and some of the consultation at the monthly
> feasts and electoral conventions is relatively exploratory, as participants
> think through issues together, deepening their insights and arriving at
> greater unity of thought which, in turn, may or may not lead to the formula-
> tion of advice or recommendations for elected bodies. However, both of
> these modes of consultation are distinct from a mode that could be called
> executive consultation, in which the objective is formal decision-making
> within a body that is invested with the authority to do so. Within the Baha’i
> administrative order, the authority to make formal decisions governing the
> community resides within the locally, nationally and internationally elected
> bodies referred to above.28 These elected bodies are therefore the sites that
> would be most clearly identified, within the Baha’i community, with proc-
> esses of formal executive decision-making. However, such decision-making
> also occurs within other corporate bodies, such as the boards of Baha’i-run
> businesses and non-profit organizations, as well as in other settings, such
as between spouses within the institution of marriage.

Baha’i consultation therefore appears to embody at least three distinct,
> specific objectives, under the broad aegis of the pursuit of unity, truth and
> justice. These can be described as (1) the pursuit of insight and under-
> standing (exploratory consultation), (2) the formulation of advice (advisory
> consultation), and (3) the process of formal decision-making (executive
> consultation). Of these three objectives, the first two appear most relevant
> to the operation of the press. From a Baha’i perspective, the press, as a
> consultative forum, is more analogous to the institution of the monthly
> feast or the electoral convention than it is to an elected body. In this regard,
> the press can be envisioned as a forum that should facilitate, in an ongoing
> manner, exploratory and advisory modes of inquiry and consultation similar
> to those that occur within Baha’i communities at the monthly feasts and
> electoral conventions. In other words, within this normative framework, the
> press becomes – at least in part – an extension of these consultative proc-

As Baha’u’llah states:

> Human utterance is an essence which aspireth to exert its influence and
> needeth moderation ... Every word is endowed with a spirit ... One word may
> be likened unto fire, another unto light, and the influence which both exert
> is manifest in the world. Therefore an enlightened man of wisdom should

> The Universal House of Justice further explains that ‘phenomenal charac-
> teristics of speech’, such as ‘content, volume, style, tact, wisdom, timeli-

> Baha’is are therefore called to exert great discipline regarding these charac-
