Abstract
      he Dispensation of Bahá’u’lláh, Shoghi Effendi’s concise statement of the fundamental verities of

T     Bahá’í belief, contains a number of important keys which lead Bahá’ís to a more complete under-
      standing of Islám.
   The Dispensation makes direct reference to other Bahá’í writings that shed light on Islám, includ in g
the Kitáb-i-ˆqán (which quotes extensively from the Qur’án) and Nabíl’s Narrative. God Passes By, a later
work by Shoghi Effendi, foreshadowed in The Dispensation, traces the death-knell of the law of Islám
back to the trumpet-blast sounded by ˇáh ir ih at the conference of Badasht and predicts the universal
recognition and acceptance of Bahá’u’lláh by the Muslim world. In The Prom is ed Day is Come, the
Guardian analyzes the impact on Islám of its refusal to accept the Message of Bahá’u’lláh, including the
collapse of the Caliphate, the abolition of the Sultanate, and the annulment of Sharí‘ah canonical law.
  The Dispensation upholds Islám as an independent religion and confirms the Imáms as the legitimate
Successors of Mu˙ammad. ‘Alí’s appointment by Mu˙ammad as His Successor was made verbally, and is
not to be found in the Qur’án. The split of Islám into Sunní and Shí‘ah branches, a schism which the
Guardian has characterized as “permanent and catastrophic,” can be traced to the lack of a written doc-
ument from Mu˙ammad establishing ‘Alí as His Successor.
   Misunderstand in gs that have crept into Islám are due to two sources: misinterpretation of the Qur’án
(which is authentic) and the use of Óadíth, which are the reported say in gs of Mu˙ammad and the Imáms.
Several misunderstand in gs addressed in The Dispensation include the finality of Revelation (since
Mu˙ammad is the “Seal of the Prophets” His Revelation is final), and the non-belief in the crucifixion
of Chr is t. The Dispensation confirms that the process of Revelation is ongoing and eternal, and that
C hr ist was crucified, as attested to by Bahá’u’lláh Himself.
   The Bahá’í Faith, being the latest Revelation from God, provides for religious and adm in is t rative fea-
tures not found in earlier religions, including Islám. These include the Covenant of Bahá’u’lláh, which
establishes in written documents the Succession, the unique station of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, and the Bahá’í
Adm in is t rative Order. The Bahá’í Adm in is t rative Order includes the Guardianship, the Universal House
of Justice, a system of elected administrative bodies, a series of appointed positions, and a comprehen-
sive and authoritative body of adm in is t rative principles and guidelines laid down by Bahá’u’lláh, ‘Abdu’l-
Bahá, and Shoghi Effendi. The Qur’án, while laying down the basic laws and ord in ances of Islám, is
silent on the questions of succession and adm in is t ration. There exists no provision in Islám, such as the
Universal House of Justice, to provide for ongoing authoritative legislation.
  Finally, The Dispensation clarifies that the Bahá’í Faith seeks not to undermine Islám, but to restore
and reinvigorate it and to assist in the real iz ation of its highest aspirations. To be true to the Message
of Bahá’u’lláh, we must view Islám and the Bahá’í Faith as essentially different stages of one and the
same religion. “This is the changeless Faith of God, eternal in the past, eternal in the future.”

Introduction
  The Dispensation of Bahá’u’lláh is Shoghi Effendi’s masterful and concise statement of Bahá’í theo-
logical principles, or fundamental verities as he calls them:
      My chief concern at this challenging period of Bahá’í history is rather to call the attention of
      those who are destined to be the champion-builders of the Adm in is t rative Order of Bahá’u’lláh
      to certain fundamental verities the elucidation of which must tremendously assist them in the
      effective prosecution of their mighty enterprise.2
  One generally overlooked aspect of this wonderful letter is the way it helps us to develop a correct
understanding and perspective on Islám, the religion which gave birth to both the Bábí and Bahá’í Faiths.
This is especially important to Bahá’ís from a Western background because information on Islám is
often highly distorted, difficult to obtain, or not stated in terms that are readily comprehensible to the
Western mind. Charles Le Gai Eaton has described this problem in his thoughtful book, Islam and the
Destiny of Man:
      Most Muslim scholars seem to agree, at least in private, that there has been a singular failure to
      communicate across the cultural frontier. The actual means of communication—the way in which
      religion needs to be presented nowadays—have been forged, not out of Islamic materials, but in
      the West. The Muslim writer finds himself obliged to work with instruments which do not fit
      comfortably in his hand. Moreover, traditional Muslims, who have escaped the influence of
      ‘modern,’ that is to say, occidental education have no understanding of the occidental mind,
      which is as strange to them as it would be to a Christian of the Middle Ages….

      The traditional Muslim writes with authority and conviction, but he does not know how to
      answer the questions which dom in ate Western thought in the religious context.3
   While The Dispensation does not devote a very large percentage of its pages to Islám, and certainly
cannot be called a treatise on the subject, it does provide a number of significant keys that help Bahá’ís,
especially Western Bahá’ís, understand Islám and put it into a proper perspective. Shoghi Effendi is
uniquely qualified to this task, combining as he does the qualities of authorized interpreter and spiri-
tual successor of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, Western-trained scholar, and a singular genius for historical analysis.
However, Shoghi Effendi’s highly condensed exposition is a mix of the explicit and implicit. Some
important elements are contained in fleeting allusions. Vast theological vistas are often only briefly
h in ted at, and the reader is left wanting more than the Guardian can possibly convey in a 60-page letter.
This being the case, the “keys” to Islám contained in The Dispensation can and should be amplified by
a careful study of other Bahá’í texts, including Shoghi Effendi’s other letters and messages.
  In brief, The Dispensation provides the following “keys” to help us understand Islám from a Bahá’í
perspective. Each one of these will be explored in detail in a later section of this paper:
  1. The Dispensation makes reference to Bahá’í Scriptures and other writings, including the Kitáb-i-
ˆqán, God Passes By, The Promised Day is Come, and Nabíl’s Narrative, which together with the brief
but def in i tive passages in The Dispensation shed light on Islám and give us a fuller understanding of
the Bahá’í perspective on several fundamental questions.
  2. The Dispensation upholds Islám as an independent religion and confirms the Imáms as the legiti-
mate successors of Mu˙ammad.
   3. The Dispensation both explicitly and implicitly corrects misunderstand in gs that have crept into
Islám.
   4. The Dispensation identifies new features of the Bahá’í Dispensation for which there are no paral-
lels within Islám.
  5. The Dispensation establishes the goals of the Bahá’í Revelation in relation to Islám.

                            Keys to the Proper Understanding of Islám


Kitáb-i-ˆqán
  The Dispensation quotes extensively from the Writings of the Báb, Bahá’u’lláh, and ‘Abdu’l-Bahá. A
number of quotations are from the Kitáb-i-ˆqán, Bahá’u’lláh’s masterful treatise on the nature of religion.
The Kitáb-i-ˆqán itself makes numerous references to the Qur’án, as well as to say in gs of ‘Alí, Óusayn,
and Sádiq (first, third, and sixth Imáms, respectively). Not only is the Western reader of the ˆqán
exposed to the rhythm and tone of the Qur’ánic verses (in Shoghi Effendi’s beautiful English translation),
but a later Manifestation of God Himself (Bahá’u’lláh) uses these verses to support His religious argu-
ments in support of the Báb’s Revelation. While not offering a comprehensive study of the Qur’án,
Bahá’u’lláh’s references to the Qur’án in the ˆqán and in His other works such as ˆ provide Bahá’ís a com-
pelling and dramatic exposure to the sacred book of Islám.
  And a dramatic exposure to the Qur’án for non-Arabic speaking Westerners is no small feat, as evi-
denced by the following quotations from Muhammad, a biography by Karen Armstrong:
    In the case of the Qur’án there is also the problem of translation. …There is something about
    Arabic which is incommunicable in another idiom: even the speeches of Arab politicians sound
    stilted, artificial and alien in an English translation. If this is true of ord in ary Arabic, of mun-
    dane utterance or conventional literature, it is doubly true of the Qur’án which is written in
    highly complex, dense and allusive language….

    This does not mean that we should dismiss the Qur’án arrogantly. It is not meant to be read like
    other books. If approached in the right way, believers claim, it yields a sense of divine presence.
    This is difficult for somebody who has been brought up in the Christian tradition to understand
    because Christians do not have a sacred language, as Sanskrit, Hebrew, and Arabic are sacred to
    Hindus, Jews, and Muslims.

    …Western people tend to find the Qur’án tediously repetitive, because it seems to go over the
    same ground again and again, but the book was not designed for private perusal but for liturgi-
    cal recitation. When Muslims listen to a sura in the mosque, they are reminded of the central
    tenets of the faith in a single recitation.4
  Shoghi Effendi describes the problem facing Western Bahá’ís in this way:
    It is certainly most difficult to thoroughly grasp all the Súrihs of the Qur’án, as it requires a
    detailed knowledge of the social, religious and historical background of Arabia at the time of
    the appearance of the Prophet. …For the present, the Guardian agrees, that it would be easier and
    more helpful to study the Book according to subjects, and not verse by verse and also in the light
    of the Báb, Bahá’u’lláh and ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s interpretation which throw such floods of light on the
    whole of the Qur’án.5
   In addition to referencing the Qur’án itself, the Writings of Bahá’u’lláh, and those of the Báb and
‘Abdu’l-Bahá introduce us to and familiarize us with Islamic terminology and concepts. In fact, any
Bahá’í who makes a serious study of Islám will be amazed to find very many phrases and terms, which
he thought previously to be Bahá’í-specific, that actually originate in Islám. The beauty of this situa-
tion is that Bahá’ís who read the Writings of the Central Figures are automatically taken to the spiritu-
al heart of Islám.

God Passes By
  The Dispensation actually foreshadows later works by the Guardian in the following passage:
    It is not my purpose, as I look back upon these crowded years of heroic deeds, to attempt even
    a cursory review of the mighty events that have transpired since 1844 until the present day. Nor
    have I any intention to undertake an an al ysis of the forces that have precipitated them, or to
    evaluate their influence upon peoples and institutions in almost every continent of the globe.6




                                                                                                             137
                                              Lights of ‘Irfán


  These works are none other than God Passes By (written in 1944), and The Promised Day is Come
(written in 1941). Speaking of a future time of conversion to the Faith by Muslims, God Passes By
describes in several places a truly remarkable prophecy of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s that the “banner of Yá Bahá’u’l-
Abhá…must float from the pinnacles of the foremost seat of learning in the Islamic world.”7 The refer-
ence here is to Al-Azhar University in Cairo, the most famous Islamic university and seminary.
  In another amazing passage in this same book, the Guardian traces the extinction of Islamic law, the
decline and secul ar iz ation of Islám, and the ultimate conversion of all Muslim peoples to the Faith of
Bahá’u’lláh, to the trumpet-blast of the New Dispensation sounded by ˇáh ir ih at the Conference of
Badasht:
      A little over four years had elapsed since the birth of the Báb’s Revelation when the trumpet-
      blast announcing the formal extinction of the old, and the inauguration of the new Dispensation
      was sounded…. The arena was a tiny hamlet in the plain of Badasht on the border of
      Mázindarán. The trumpeter was a lone woman, the noblest of her sex in that Dispensation,
      whom even some of her co-religionists pronounced a heretic. The call she sounded was the death-
      knell of the twelve hundred year old law of Islám.

      Accelerated, twenty years later, by another trumpet-blast, announcing the formulation of the
      laws of yet another Dispensation, this process of disintegration, associated with the dec l in in g
      fortunes of a superannuated, though divinely revealed Law, gathered further momentum, pre-
      cipitated, in a later age, the annulment of the Sharí‘ah canonical Law in Turkey, led to the vir-
      tual abandonment of that Law in Shí‘ah Persia, has, more recently, been responsible for the dis-
      sociation of the System envisaged in the Kitáb-i-Aqdas from the Sunní ecclesiastical Law in
      Egypt, has paved the way for the recognition of that System in the Holy Land itself, and is des-
      tined to culm in ate in the secul ar iz ation of the Muslim states, and in the universal recognition
      of the Law of Bahá’u’lláh by all the nations, and its enthronement in the hearts of all the peo-
      ples, of the Muslim world.8
  This passage leaves us absolutely breathless, combining as it does prophecy, historical an al ysis
undreamt of by secular historians, and a dramatic recounting of the facts.

The Promised Day is Come
  In The Prom is ed Day is Come, Shoghi Effendi analyzes the impact of the world’s refusal to accept the
Message of Bahá’u’lláh and devotes more pages to these themes. It is beyond the scope of this paper to
adequately describe the Guardian’s analysis, but some of the topics related to Islám include the follow-
ing:
  1. The general decline of Religious Orthodoxy (pp. 76–80).
  2. The Báb and Bahá’u’lláh’s castigation of the Muslim religious divines, who have been responsible
for the people’s rejection of the New Dispensation (pp. 87–93).
  3. A description of the decline of the Shí‘ah ecclesiastical order (pp. 93–98).
  4. The collapse of the Caliphate (pp. 98–99).
  5. The abolition of the Sultanate (pp. 99–100).
  6. The annulment of the Sharí‘ah canonical Law and the promulgation of a civil code in its place (p.
101).
  7. The de-arabization and de-Islamification of Turkey (p. 101).
  Writing of the fortunes of Sunní Islám in the twentieth century, Shoghi Effendi describes the
Caliphate as an institution that “vanished like a smoke,” leaving more than 200 million Muslims with-
out a leader:
      Strange, incredibly strange, must appear the position of this most powerful branch of the
      Islamic Faith, with no outward and visible head to voice its sentiments and convictions, its unity


138
                           Keys to the Proper Understanding of Islám


    irretrievably shattered, its radiance obscured, its law undermined, its institutions thrown into
    hopeless confusion. This institution that had challenged the inalienable, divinely appointed
    rights of the Imáms of the Faith of Mu˙ammad, had, after the revolution of thirteen centuries,
    vanished like a smoke, an institution which had dealt such merciless blows to a Faith Whose
    Herald was Himself a descendant of the Imáms, the lawful successors of the Apostle of God.9
   Lest we misinterpret these harsh descriptions, dire prophesies, stern rebukes and warnings to be a gen-
eral rejection or disparagement of Mu˙ammad, the Qur’án, or Islám, the Guardian reminds us again of
the fundamental verities of our Faith:
    As to Mu˙ammad, the Apostle of God, let none among His followers who read these pages,
    think for a moment that either Islám, or its Prophet, or His Book, or His appointed Successors,
    or any of His authentic teachings, have been, or are to be in any way, or to however slight a
    degree, disparaged. The lineage of the Báb, the descendant of the Imám Óusayn; the divers and
    striking evidences, in Nabíl’s Narrative, of the attitude of the Herald of our Faith towards the
    Founder, the Imáms, and the Book of Islám; the glowing tributes paid by Bahá’u’lláh in the
    Kitáb-i-ˆqán to Mu˙ammad and His lawful Successors, and particularly to the “peerless and
    incomparable” Imám Óusayn; the arguments adduced, forcibly, fearlessly, and publicly by ‘Abdu’l-
    Bahá, in churches and synagogues, to demonstrate the validity of the Message of the Arabian
    Prophet; and last but not least the written testimonial of the Queen of Rumania, who, born in
    the Anglican faith and notwithstanding the close alliance of her government with the Greek
    Orthodox Church, the state religion of her adopted country, has, largely as a result of the perusal
    of these public discourses of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, been prompted to proclaim her recognition of the
    prophetic function of Mu˙ammad—all proclaim, in no uncertain terms, the true attitude of the
    Bahá’í Faith towards its parent religion.10

Nabíl’s Narrative
   Finally, Nabíl’s Narrative, which Shoghi Effendi translated and edited two years before he wrote The
Dispensation, offers “striking evidences” “of the attitude of the Herald of our Faith (the Báb) towards the
Founder, the Imáms, and the Book of Islám.”11 This book also serves to introduce us to the culture of
Shí‘ah Islám, as it existed in nineteenth-century Persia, and helps us to understand the ferocity of the
attacks launched against the Bábi and Bahá’í Faiths in the land of their birth. Shoghi Effendi makes sev-
eral references to Nabíl’s Narrative in The Dispensation.

Islám as an Independent Religion and the Imáms
as the Legitimate Successors of Mu˙ammad
   In discussing the Master’s explanation of an ancient Zoroastrian prophecy, Shoghi Effendi makes the
following statement in The Dispensation:
    From the text of this explicit and authoritative interpretation of so ancient a prophecy it is evi-
    dent how necessary it is for every faithful follower of the Faith to accept the divine origin and
    uphold the independent status of the Mu˙ammadan Dispensation. The validity of the Imamate
    is, moreover, implicitly recognized in these same passages—that divinely-appointed institution
    of whose most distinguished member the Báb Himself was a lineal descendant, and which con-
    tinued for a period of no less than two hundred and sixty years to be the chosen recipient of the
    guidance of the Almighty and the repository of one of the two most precious legacies of Islám.12
  This passage confirms the divine origin and independent status of Islám and upholds the validity of
the Imamate. The legitimacy of the Imáms is also upheld in the previously quoted passage from The
Promised Day is Come.
  Amazingly, some writers dispute these statements proclaiming the Imáms to be the legitimate succes-
sors of Mu˙ammad. Instead, they claim the Faith’s stance on the Imáms is part of a general “Shí‘ah bias”
that exists because the Báb and Bahá’u’lláh came out of a Shí‘ah Islamic background. In The Dispensation
Shoghi Effendi clearly refutes such a view.

                                                                                                          139
                                               Lights of ‘Irfán


  A central problem for Islám is that ‘Ali’s appointment as Mu˙ammad’s successor was not put into writ-
ing and is not contained in the Qur’án:
      Can any passage of the Qur’án, which in respect to its legal code, its adm in is t rative and devo-
      tional ord in ances marks already a notable advance over previous and more corrupted
      Revelations, be construed as placing upon an unassailable basis the undoubted authority with
      which Mu˙ammad had, verbally and on several occasions, invested His successor?13
   This statement by the Guardian confirms that ‘Alí was verbally appointed by Mu˙ammad on several
occasions, but as history reports, after Mu˙ammad’s passing he was passed over in favor of Abú-Bakr.14
‘Alí finally became the fourth Caliph after the death of ‘U t hm án, but Islám’s unity had by that time been
irreparably shattered and the seeds sown for the division into Sunní and Shí‘ah sects. After ‘Alí’s assas-
sination by His enemies, the leadership of Islám was seized by Mu‘á wí yah, the son of Mu˙ammad’s prin-
ciple Meccan enemy, Abú-Sufyán. Thus began the period of the Umayyad Caliphs. A minority of Muslims
who followed ‘Alí and his descendents, the Imáms, became known as the Shí‘ahs.
  The Shí‘ah accounts of Mu˙ammad’s last pilgrimage to Mecca describe His appointment of ‘Alí as His
successor:
      Shí‘ah tradition has it that on the way back to Medina, at urgent bidding received from God,
      Mu˙ammad made, all of a sudden, a forced halt by the pool of Khum, a most inconvenient
      place; had a pulpit raised with saddles, and from this announced ‘Alí as His successor, re qu ir in g
      the large body of Muslims who were with Him to pledge their loyalty to ‘A lí .15
   Another episode concerns Mu˙ammad’s death-bed request for writing materials in order to leave a
will—a request which was refused by ‘Umar who reportedly said: “The Book of God is sufficient unto
us.” We know this actually happened because ‘Abdu’l-Bahá describes the awful consequences of these
words in the Law˙-i-H iz ár Baytí (Tablet of One Thousand Verses). Here is Taherzadeh’s summary and
commentary on this Tablet:
      ‘Abdu’l-Bahá states that it was this very statement which caused the foundation of the religion of
      God in the Islamic Dispensation to be shattered and the ignoble worshippers of self and passion
      to rule over the righteous souls. It became a deadly weapon with which the Imám ‘Alí himself
      was martyred, which caused great divisions within the nation of Islám, and which changed the
      loving spirit of that nation to that of warriors armed with sword and weapon. As a result of this
      statement, the head of Imám Óusayn, the most illustrious of the Imáms, was decapitated on the
      plain of Karbilá, the other holy Imáms were in fl i c ted with great sufferings, imprisonment and
      death, and the blood of countless innocent souls was shed for well nigh twelve hundred years.

      ‘Abdu’l-Bahá further affirms that this statement uttered by ‘Umar was transformed into the hun-
      dreds of bullets centuries later which pierced the breast of the Báb in Tabríz, that this statement
      became the chains which were placed around the blessed neck of Bahá’u’lláh, and brought about
      the untold suffe r in gs in fl i c ted upon Him in the course of His successive exiles.16
  Much, much more can be said on this topic. However, as confirmed by the above quotations and many
others as well:
      It is a fundamental belief of the Bahá’ís that Imám ‘Alí was the lawful successor of the Prophet of
      Islám. After him his lineal male descendents known as the ‘holy Imáms’ led the Shí‘ah communi-
      ty until the year 260 AH. Bahá’u’lláh regarded the Imáms as the legitimate successors of the
      Prophet, acknowledged the value of their work in the elucidation of the Qur’án, confirmed many
      of their sayings as recorded in the books of ‘A˙ádíth’ (traditions), quoted several of these in His
      Writings, interpreted their words, extolled their station (especially that of Óusayn, the third Imám)
      in glowing terms, and referred to them as ‘those unquenchable lights of divine guidance’ and ‘those
      lamps of certitude’.17

Misunderstandings that Have Crept into Islám
Sources of Misunderstandings in Islám
   As with each religion, Islám has over time departed from the pr is tine purity of its original teachings.
Religious misunderstand in gs and erroneous interpretations have crept into the religion and are now
accepted as orthodox teaching. This process is well described in the Bahá’í Scriptures, especially in the
talks of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, and constitutes the main reason why a new Revelation is needed every thousand
years or so. The new Manifestation restates the eternal truths, brings new teac h in gs for the people of
His Day, and clears away misunderstand in gs from previous religions.
   In the case of Islám, we know the text of the Qur’án is authentic, which is an advancement over the
older Faiths:
    We cannot be sure of the authenticity, word for word, of any of the past Holy Scriptures except
    the Qur’án, as they were either not written down during the Prophet’s lifetime or have been
    changed in the course of time and the originals lost;18

    …the Qur’án which, apart from the sacred scriptures of the Bábi and Bahá’í Revelations, consti-
    tutes the only Book which can be regarded as an absolutely authenticated Repository of the Word
    of God.19
  Thus, the two main sources of religious error in Islám are misinterpretation of the Qur’án (the words
are authentic but their meaning is lost or misconstrued), and Óadíth (reported say in gs of Mu˙ammad
and the Imáms). It is interesting to note how both of these sources of error are dealt with in the Bahá’í
Faith: Bahá’u’lláh has forbidden oral tradition as a basis for His religion and misinterpretation of the
scriptures is prevented by the institution of the Covenant (see next section of this paper for a fuller dis-
cussion).
  Several Islamic misunderstand in gs are explicitly or implicitly addressed in The Dispensation:
  1. The claim of finality of Revelation (Mu˙ammad is the ‘seal of the Prophets’)
  2. The Crucifixion of Christ
Finality of Revelation
  The first issue is addressed in the following passage from The Dispensation:
    Indeed, the categorical rejection by the followers of the Faith of Bahá’u’lláh of the claim to
    f in ality which any religious system inaugurated by the Prophets of the past may advance is as
    clear and emphatic as their own refusal to claim that same finality for the Revelation with which
    they stand identified. “To believe that all revelation is ended, that the portals of Divine mercy
    are closed, that from the daysprings of eternal holiness no sun shall rise again, that the ocean
    of everlasting bounty is forever stilled, and that out of the tabernacle of ancient glory the
    Messengers of God have ceased to be made manifest” must constitute in the eyes of every fol-
    lower of the Faith a grave, an inexcusable departure from one of its most cherished and funda-
    mental principles.20
   The quotation in italics is from the Kitáb-i-ˆqán. In that same book, Bahá’u’lláh forcefully challenges
the Muslim view that since Mu˙ammad is the “Seal of the Prophets,” a later Revelation from God is not
possible.21 Not only does Bahá’u’lláh affirm the Báb’s Revelation as the next valid religious Dispensation
after Islám, but He also emphatically states that the process of Divine Revelation will continue indefi-
nitely.
Crucifixion of Christ
   The crucifixion of Christ is an important topic, since it demonstrates a clear example of a misinter-
pretation of the Qur’ánic verses. To virtually every Christian denom in ation and sect, Christ’s crucifix-
ion represents the pivotal event of His ministry in which He died on the cross to atone for the sins of
all humanity. And yet, the majority of Muslims rejects the historical fact of the Crucifixion of Chr is t:


                                                                                                        141
                                             Lights of ‘Irfán


      The Quranic teaching is that Christ was not crucified nor killed by the Jews, notwithstand in g
      certain apparent circumstances which produced that illusion in the minds of some of his ene-
      mies; that disputations, doubts, and conjectures on such matters are vain; and that he was taken
      up to God.22
   The following quotations are two different translations of the Qur’ánic verses which have led Muslims
to this conclusion (4:157–158):
      That they said (in boast),
      “We killed Christ Jesus
      The son of Mary,
      The Apostle of God”;—But they killed him not,
      Nor crucified him,
      But so it was made
      To appear to them,
      And those who differ
      Therein are full of doubts,
      With no (certain) knowledge,
      But only conjecture to follow,
      For of a surety
      They killed him not;—
      Nay, God raised him up
      Unto Himself; and God
      Is Exalted in Power, Wise;— 23

      …and for their say in g, ‘We slew the Messiah,
      Jesus son of Mary, the Messenger of God’—
      yet they did not slay him, neither crucified him,
      only a likeness of that was shown to them.
      Those who are at variance concerning him surely
      are in doubt regarding him; they have no knowledge
      of him, except the following of surmise;
      and they slew him not of a certainty—
      no indeed; God raised him up to Him; God is
      All-mighty, All-w is e.24
   Bahá’u’lláh refutes this interpretation in several places in His Writings. In The Dispensation, a prayer
of Bahá’u’lláh is quoted in which He says: “Again I was crucified for having unveiled to men’s eyes the
hidden gems of Thy glorious unity, for having revealed to them the wondrous signs of Thy sovereign and
everlasting power.” 25 In this prayer He identifies Himself with the sufferings experienced by past
Prophets and Holy Ones, including Noah, Moses, Jesus, and the Imám Óusayn.
  An even more pointed confirmation of Christ’s crucifixion is made in the following quotation from
Glean in gs:
      O Jews! If ye be intent on crucifying once again Jesus, the Spirit of God, put Me to death, for
      He hath once more, in My person, been made manifest unto you.26

                           Keys to the Proper Understanding of Islám


Other Misunderstandings Not Addressed in The Dispensation
  There are numerous other misunderstand in gs or errors that have entered Islám, such as attitudes
towards women,27 certain Óadíth that encourage the execution of apostates,28 etc. These and others are
dealt with in other places in the Bahá’í Revelation, but are not covered in the The Dispensation of
Bahá’u’lláh.
New Features of the Bahá’í Dispensation Not Found in Islám
  The Covenant of Bahá’u’lláh
  We have already discussed in Section III the lack of a written will appointing ‘Alí as Mu˙ammad’s suc-
cessor, and the resulting schism into Sunní and Shí‘ah branches—a schism which the Guardian has char-
acterized as “permanent and catastrophic.”29
   Bahá’u’lláh’s Covenant, as documented in the Kitáb-i-‘Ahd and ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s Will and Testament, has
resolutely resolved the question of succession, and has conferred the mantle of authority, interpretation,
and infallibility on both ‘Abdu’l-Bahá and Shoghi Effendi. This is unprecedented in the history of reli-
gion:
    Nowhere in the sacred scriptures of any of the world’s religious systems, nor even in the writ-
    ings of the Inaugurator of the Bábí Dispensation, do we find any provisions establishing a
    covenant or providing for an adm in is t rative order that can compare in scope and authority with
    those that lie at the very basis of the Bahá’í Dispensation. Has either Christianity or Islám, to
    take as an instance two of the most widely diffused and outstanding among the world’s recog-
    n iz ed religions, anything to offer that can measure with, or be regarded as equivalent to, either
    the Book of Bahá’u’lláh’s Covenant or to the Will and Testament of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá? Does the text
    of either the Gospel or the Qur’án confer sufficient authority upon those leaders and councils
    that have claimed the right and assumed the function of interpreting the provisions of their
    sacred scriptures and of administering the affairs of their respective communities? Could Peter,
    the admitted chief of the Apostles, or the Imám ‘Alí, the cousin and legitimate successor of the
    Prophet, produce in support of the pr im acy with which both had been invested written and
    explicit affirmations from Christ and Mu˙ammad that could have silenced those who either
    among their contemporaries or in a later age have repudiated their authority and, by their action,
    precipitated the schisms that persist until the present day?30
   Bahá’u’lláh Himself testifies to the power of His Covenant in the following words: “So firm and
mighty is this Covenant that from the beginning of time until the present day no religious Dispensation
hath produced its like.”31 One may wonder why this is true—why have past religions, including Islám, suf-
fered catastrophic schisms for lack of a firm and documented Covenant? One possible explanation has
been offered in Taherzadeh’s monumental work, The Covenant of Bahá’u’lláh:
    In past Dispensations the Prophets did not establish a firm and unequivocal Covenant with their
    followers concerning their successors, nor did they leave behind clear guidance as to how to con-
    duct the affairs of the community after their departure from this world. Consequently, religions
    became divided into many sects resulting in conflicts and disunity among the followers. But the
    non-existence of a clear Covenant and lack of guidance should not be construed as a failure on
    the part of the Founders of religions. To attribute to the Manifestations of God a lack of under-
    stand in g, of vision and knowledge, is tantamount to attributing shortcom in gs and imperfec-
    tions to God Himself…

    A careful study of the history of religions will enable us to realize that the Manifestations of
    old, those embodiments of God’s attributes, did not make an unequivocal written Covenant
    with their followers because of the immaturity of the people of the age, who could not have sus-
    ta in ed the rigours, the tests and the strict discipline which the observance of such a Covenant
    would inevitably have required.32




                                                                                                          143
                                              Lights of ‘Irfán


  The Uniqueness of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá
   As stated in The Dispensation, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá fulfills a unique function for which there is no equiva-
lent in past religions, including Islám:
      One Who, not only in the Dispensation of Bahá’u’lláh but in the entire field of religious histo-
      ry, fulfills a unique function. Though moving in a sphere of His own and holding a rank radi-
      cally different from that of the Author and the Forerunner of the Bahá’í Revelation, He, by
      virtue of the station ordained for Him through the Covenant of Bahá’u’lláh, forms together
      with them what may be termed the Three Central Figures of a Faith that stands unapproached in
      the world’s spiritual history.33
  A glimpse of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s uniqueness is offered by the Guardian’s summary description of His many
qualities and titles:
      He is, and should for all time be regarded, first and foremost, as the Center and Pivot of
      Bahá’u’lláh’s peerless and all-enfolding Covenant, His most exalted handiwork, the stainless
      Mi rror of His light, the perfect Exemplar of His teachings, the unerring Interpreter of His
      Word, the embodiment of every Bahá’í ideal, the incarnation of every Bahá’í virtue, the Most
      Mighty Branch sprung from the Ancient Root, the Limb of the Law of God, the Being “round
      Whom all names revolve,” the Mainspring of the Oneness of Humanity, the Ensign of the Most
      Great Peace, the Moon of the Central Orb of this most holy Dispensation - styles and titles that
      are implicit and find their truest, their highest and fairest expression in the magic name ‘Abdu’l-
      Bahá. He is, above and beyond these appellations, the “Mystery of God”—an expression by which
      Bahá’u’lláh Himself has chosen to designate Him, and which, while it does not by any means
      justify us to assign to Him the station of Prophethood, indicates how in the person of ‘Abdu’l-
      Bahá the incompatible characteristics of a human nature and superhuman knowledge and per-
      fection have been blended and are completely harmonized.34
   It is interesting to note that Shoghi Effendi does not claim a sim il ar uniqueness of station for the
Guardianship. In fact, in his discussion of the Guardianship in The Dispensation he mentions “the hered-
itary principle and the law of primogeniture as having been upheld by the Prophets of the past.”35 From
this, one could infer a correspondence in function between the Imáms of Islám, and the Guardian. The
Imáms, like the succession of Guardians envisioned in The Will and Testament, passed the mantle of
authority and succession from father to son. Both the Guardian and the Imáms provided interpretation
of the scriptures and spiritual leadership and guidance.36
  Administrative Order
  The Bahá’í Administrative Order, the provisions of which have been laid down in the Writings of
Bahá’u’lláh, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá and Shoghi Effendi, is absolutely unique in religious history:
      The Bahá’í Commonwealth of the future, of which this vast Adm in is t rative Order is the sole
      framework, is, both in theory and practice, not only unique in the entire history of political
      institutions, but can find no parallel in the annals of any of the world’s recognized religious sys-
      tems.37
  In rough outline, the Bahá’í Adm in is t rative Order contains the following elements:
  1. A written Covenant, which specifies succession. Bahá’u’lláh was succeeded by His eldest Son,
‘Abdu’l-Bahá, the Mystery of God, Whom He appointed in His Book of the Covenant (Kitáb-i-‘Ahd).
‘Abdu’l-Bahá fulfills a unique role in religious history as appointed successor, infallible interpreter,
Center of the Covenant, and perfect exemplar of Bahá’u’lláh’s teac h in gs. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá was succeeded by
His grandson, Shoghi Effendi, whom He appointed in His Will and Testament to be the Guardian, vest-
ed with the roles of head of the Faith and infallible interpreter.
  2. A series of elected bodies to adm in is ter the Faith (Local and National Spiritual Assemblies, and the
Universal House of Justice). The local believers elect the Local Assembly annually through plurality vote;



144
                           Keys to the Proper Understanding of Islám


the National Assembly is elected annually through a National Convention; the Universal House of
Justice is elected every five years by a plurality vote of the members of all National Assemblies. In 1998
the Universal House of Justice introduced Regional Bahá’í Councils that operate between the local and
national levels in those countries where the complexity of issues facing National Spiritual Assemblies
requires a new measure of decentral iz ation.
  3. A series of appointed positions including Hands of the Cause, Continental Counselors, Auxiliary
Board Members and their assistants. These individuals inspire and educate the believers, and focus on
activities to propagate and protect the Faith. They work hand in hand with the elected institutions, but
have no real power of their own.
   4. A series of Administrative principles and guidelines which are enshr in ed in the Writings of
Bahá’u’lláh, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, and Shoghi Effendi. These principles cover such topics as consultation, elec-
tions, community life, the spirit of Bahá’í administration, guidance on the application of Bahá’í Law, and
the qualifications for service.
  5. Explicit infallibility conveyed upon the Center of the Covenant (‘Abdu’l-Bahá), the Guardian, and
the Universal House of Justice.
  6. Explicit and exclusive right of interpretation conveyed to both the Center of the Covenant and the
Guardian.
  7. Ability for the House of Justice to legislate in areas not covered by Bahá’u’lláh’s Writings.
  8. Sphere of legislation of the Universal House of Justice def in ed by the Guardianship.
   9. A specified provision for the excommunication of those who attack the head of the Faith and
attempt to undermine the firmly established Covenant. These ind iv iduals are called “Covenant
Breakers.”
   We have seen in the previous sections of this paper that Islám lacked a written Covenant resulting in
a split into Sunní and Shí‘ah sects. The Qur’án, while providing laws and ord in ances and the basis for a
legal code, is silent on the question of how the religion is to be maintained and administered after the
Prophet’s passing. The Shí‘ah and Sunní sects took different paths as explained by this passage from
Moojan Momen’s excellent book, An Introduction to Shi’i Islam:
    The Sunni concept of leadership of the Muslim community after the death of the Prophet, the
    Caliphate, is essentially a temporal leadership. The Caliph is the first among equals, elected ide-
    ally by consensus, although later the hereditary principle became the norm. To others, the the-
    ologians and experts in jurisprudence, is given the task of expounding upon religious questions.

    To the Shi’is, however, the succession to the Prophet is a matter of the designation by the Prophet
    of an individual (‘Alí) as Imam. Each Imam designates his successor during his lifetime. The
    authority of the Imam derives from his designation by his predecessor to a spiritual station and
    is independent of his temporal stand in g, i.e. it makes no difference to the Imam’s station
    whether he is acknowledged by the generality of Muslims or not, whereas this quite clearly does
    not apply to a Sunni Caliph whose station is totally dependent on such acknowledgement.

    The Sunnis and Shi’is are basically in agreement with each other over the nature and function
    of prophethood. The two main functions of the Prophet are to reveal God’s law to men and to
    guide men towards God. Of these two functions, the Sunnis believe that both ended with the
    death of Muhammad, while the Shi’is believe that whereas legislation ended, the function of
    guiding men and preserving and explaining the Divine Law continued through the line of
    Imams.38
   In addition to the Caliphs and the Imáms, both Islamic branches developed an additional body of lit-
erature called Óadíth, which represent the reported say in gs of Mu˙ammad (Sunnís), and which for the
Shí‘ahs also include the reported say in gs of the Imáms. Each branch also developed its own form of
Islamic jurisprudence as well their own system of clergy and theological tra in in g.



                                                                                                          145
                                                     Lights of ‘Irfán


   It is important to realize that no matter how much these elements have contributed to the richness of
Islamic history, culture, and religious thought, absolutely none of it can be traced back to the explicit
text of the Qur’án, a book that is universally accepted as the Word of God by all Muslims. Thus, ‘A lí ’s
appointment as Mu˙ammad’s successor is not to be found in the Qur’án, neither is any text that might
form the justification for the Caliphate. There is disagreement among Muslims as to which Óadíth are
authentic and which are not (plus the Shí‘ahs have Óadíth for the Imáms which of course are not accept-
ed by the Sunnís). The various schools of Islamic jurisprudence and the various religious clergy have all
been developed in response to the needs of the religion to deal with questions and situations not found
in the Qur’án, to ensure tra in ing and education of the people, and to provide for the ongoing adm in is-
tration of the religion. An almost identical situation exists in Christianity: the Bible contains almost no
information about how to adm in is ter the religion after the departure of Chr is t.
  Neither Christianity nor Islám contains a mechanism for ongoing authoritative legislation, which can
be traced back to the Holy Book, such as exists with the Universal House of Justice.
  Goals of the Bahá’í Dispensation in Relation to Islám
  Bahá’u’lláh says: “This is the changeless Faith of God, eternal in the past, eternal in the future. Let
him that seeketh, attain it.”39 As a befitting close to this paper, the following quotation from The
Dispensation seeks to establish the proper relationship between Islám and the Bahá’í Revelation:
      Nor does the Bahá’í Revelation, claiming as it does to be the culm in ation of a prophetic cycle
      and the fulfillment of the promise of all ages, attempt, under any circumstances, to invalidate
      those first and everlasting principles that an im ate and underlie the religions that have preceded
      it. The God-given authority, vested in each one of them, it admits and establishes as its firmest
      and ultimate basis. It regards them in no other light except as different stages in the eternal his-
      tory and constant evolution of one religion, Divine and indivisible, of which it itself forms but
      an integral part. It neither seeks to obscure their Divine origin, nor to dwarf the admitted mag-
      nitude of their colossal achievements. It can countenance no attempt that seeks to distort their
      features or to stultify the truths which they instill. Its teachings do not deviate a hairbreadth
      from the verities they enshrine, nor does the weight of its message detract one jot or one tittle
      from the influence they exert or the loyalty they inspire. Far from a im ing at the overthrow of
      the spiritual foundation of the world’s religious systems, its avowed, its unalterable purpose is to
      widen their basis, to restate their fundamentals, to reconcile their aims, to reinvigorate their life,
      to demonstrate their oneness, to restore the pristine purity of their teachings, to coord in ate their
      functions and to assist in the real iz ation of their highest aspirations. These divinely-revealed
      religions, as a close observer has graphically expressed it, “are doomed not to die, but to be
      reborn….”40
   The Bahá’í Revelation seeks not to undermine Islám (or any other religion), but to restore and rein-
vigorate it. To be true to the truths revealed by Bahá’u’lláh, we must view Islám and the Bahá’í Faith as
essentially different stages of one and the same religion.
   The Dispensation thus protects the Bahá’í community from slipping into the “Islám-bashing” so com-
mon in the West today. The Dispensation requires that Bahá’ís, despite having suffered enormously at the
hands of Muslims, give due and just regard to Islám as a Divinely-revealed religion, revere the Prophet
Mu˙ammad and His Successors the Imáms, accept the Qur’án as the Word of God, and acknowledge the
many valuable contributions which Islám has made to the advancement of civ il iz ation. Finally, this all-
important letter of the Guardian holds out the promise of the ultimate regeneration of Islám – a regen-
eration that will be real iz ed during the Dispensation of Bahá’u’lláh.

27) For example, the relegation of women to the back of the mosque occurred over time. Women worshipped in the mosque
   side by side with men in Mu˙ammad’s day. The use of a chador or “head to toe” shroud for women is not mandated by
   Mu˙ammad or the Qur’án, other than general exhortations for modesty in dress.
28) Bukhari 88:1 states: “Whoever changes his religion, kill him.” Bukhari 87:6 also states that the life of a Muslim may be

   is one of the well-known compilations of Islamic Óadith. These traditions are not accepted by all Muslims, especially
   the more liberal. See, for example, The Religion of Islam, Maulana Muhammad Ali, S. Chand & Company, New Delhi,
   pp. 591–599, for a discussion of Apostasy. The Qur’án states: “Let there be no compulsion in religion” (2:256).

36) The line of Guardians ended with Shoghi Effendi, since he had no heirs and none of his male relatives met the qualifi-
   cations in ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s Will and Testament. This situation created a theological test for the Bahá’í community, since a
   line of Guardians is clearly in envisioned the Will and Testament, which also describes the Guardian as the permanent
   head of the Universal House of Justice, which had not yet come into existence at the time of Shoghi Effendi’s passing in
   1957. Much has been written on this topic elsewhere, and so a more detailed treatment is beyond the scope of this paper.
   Briefly, the Universal House of Justice was first elected in 1963, at the successful conclusion of Shoghi Effendi’s ten-year
   global campaign to expand the Bahá’í Faith to all parts of the world. The House of Justice, when elected, resolved the
   theological dilemma by legislating that future Guardians were not possible. The Supreme Institution did explain that the
   institution of the Guardianship continues to operate through the vast and authoritative body of writings left by Shoghi
   Effendi. Although there was only one Guardian in the person of Shoghi Effendi, the “hereditary principle” mentioned in
   The Dispensation is fulfilled in the sense that Bahá’u’lláh appointed His son, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, who in turn appointed His
   grandson, Shoghi Effendi.
