Parallels in the Ministries of Táhirih and
                   Paul

                    JoAnn M. Borovicka



   Táhirih, a woman born into the Islamic religion in the
nineteenth-century Persian Empire, is the most renowned
heroine of the earliest days of the Bahá’í Faith.1 Paul, a man
born into the Jewish religion in the first century Roman
Empire, is the most prominent apostle in the early history of
Christianity.2 Táhirih and Paul are separated by gender, religion,
nationality, culture, and eighteen hundred years. And yet, when
stories of their lives and apostolic ministries are compared,
parallels arise—the most significant of which is that both are
known for singular initiatives that helped differentiate new
Revelation from the old: Táhirih played a central role in
distinguishing the Bahá’í Revelation3 from Islam, while Paul
played a central role in distinguishing the Christian Revelation
from Judaism. This and additional parallels regarding their
conversions, the challenges they faced, and some of the
circumstances of their ministries are surprisingly harmonic. The
purpose of this paper is to point out nine parallels in the
ministries of Táhirih and Paul and to reflect on the value of this
knowledge in interfaith dialogue.

Parallel 1: A Vision of the Manifestation of God
before Conversion 4

  Both Táhirih and Paul had a vision of the Manifestation of
God prior to acceptance of the new Revelation. Táhirih’s vision
and conversion came shortly after the Báb’s Declaration while
Paul’s came years after Christ was crucified. We will look at
Táhirih’s story first.
   Táhirih (“the Pure One”) is a title given by Bahá’u’lláh to
Fátimih Baraghání5 who was born about 1817 in Qazvín, Persia,
to a family well placed in traditional Islam: her father was a
mujtahid6 and her paternal uncle was the leader of prayers in the
cathedral mosque. Although the culture in which she lived
generally denied education to girls, Táhirih’s father educated her
from childhood. She excelled in Islamic studies and literature
and was a master of Arabic and Persian. ‘Abdu’l Bahá states:
“Such was the degree of her scholarship and attainments that her
father would often express his regret, saying, ‘Would that she
had been a boy, for he would have shed illumination upon my
household, and would have succeeded me!’” [MF 188]
   As a young adult, Táhirih was inspired to investigate the
teachings of Shaykh Ahmad-i-Ahsá’í and Siyyid Kázim-i-Rashtí—
forerunners of the Báb who taught the imminent coming of the
Qá’im in the Shaykhi school of the Shi‘ah sect of Islam—even
though this greatly agitated her family [MF 189]. In 1844 she set
out on a journey to study with Siyyid Kázim in person, but he
passed away before she arrived. She continued to follow his last
instructions to his disciples to “Go forth... and seek out your
Lord” [MF 190]. It was in the course of her religious disciplines
to this end that she had a vision of the Báb in a dream. ‘Abdu’l-
Bahá relays her experience:

     In her vision a youth, a Siyyid, wearing a black cloak and
     a green turban, appeared to her in the heavens; he was
     standing in the air, reciting verses and praying with his
     hands upraised. At once, she memorized one of those
Parallels in the Ministries of Táhirih and Paul                   39


     verses, and wrote it down in her notebook when she
     awoke. After the Báb had declared His mission, and His
     first book, “The Best of Stories”7 was circulated, Táhirih
     was reading a section of the text one day, and she came
     upon that same verse, which she had noted down from
     the dream. Instantly offering thanks, she fell to her
     knees and bowed her forehead to the ground, convinced
     that the Báb’s message was truth. [MF 190]

   Táhirih sent a letter to the Báb declaring her belief. When it
was received the Báb declared her an apostle—one of His
Eighteen Letters of the Living. Táhirih was the only woman to
achieve that station.
    Paul’s mystical vision and conversion happened quite
differently. Paul, also called Saul, was born around 5 A.D. to a
Jewish family in the Hellenistic Diaspora; he describes himself
as “circumcised on the eighth day, a member of the people of
Israel, of the tribe of Benjamin, a Hebrew born of Hebrews; as
to the law, a Pharisee.”8 Nothing is known of his early
education, but New Testament scholars report that through
analysis of his letters it is evident that Paul was educated in
Greek rhetoric and philosophy as well as Hebrew and many
fields of Jewish teachings—this at a time when most people were
illiterate.9
   As a young adult, Paul believed that the Jesus-movement was
a dangerously heretical sect and he participated in the
persecution of its followers.10 Paul’s conversion, which took
place a few years after the crucifixion, is described in the Book
of Acts as a vision of and conversation with Christ that came to
him suddenly as he was travelling to Damascus—a vision so
powerful that it knocked him off his horse and blinded him for
three days.11 Whether Paul was physically or figuratively
knocked off his horse we don’t know, but according to his
Second Letter to the Corinthians (which is widely believed by
biblical scholars to be an authentic letter of Paul’s12), he did
have a vision of Christ and he was transformed.13 From a
40                                             Lights of Irfán vol. 17


persecutor of the Jesus-movement, Paul became a persecuted
follower of Jesus Christ.
   Paul’s calling as an apostle was surprising. The gospels report
that Jesus chose twelve men as apostles in His lifetime: Simon
(also called Peter), Andrew, James, John, Phillip, Bartholomew,
Thomas, Matthew, James, Thaddeus, Simon, and Judas Iscariot.
Paul never met Jesus in person and Paul was not one of these
initial twelve; but, through this and other visions, Paul believed
himself commissioned by God as an apostle of Christ and
empowered to speak with authority to individuals and
communities in the Jesus-movement.14 Was this legitimate? In a
reference to Paul ‘Abdu’l-Bahá states:

     Physical nearness or remoteness [to the Manifestation] is
     of no importance; the essential fact is the spiritual
     affinity and ideal nearness. Judas Iscariot was for a long
     time favored in the holy court of His Holiness Christ,
     yet he was entirely far and remote; while Paul, the
     apostle, was in close embrace with His Holiness. [TAB 3
     719-20]

Thus, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá seems to confirm Paul’s inspiration.
   It is interesting that Táhirih’s vision reinforced the spiritual
path that she was investigating, while Paul’s vision resulted in a
radical reorientation of his beliefs—yet both visions resulted in
conversions of prominent apostles in the new Revelations.

Parallel 2: Distinguishing New Revelation from
the Old

   The most significant parallel between Táhirih and Paul, and
the factor that sets them apart from all of the other apostles in
the Bahá’í and Christian Dispensations, is that both are
recognized for singular initiatives that contributed significantly
to distinguishing new Revelation from the old.
Parallels in the Ministries of Táhirih and Paul                   41


   In Memorials of the Faithful, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá introduces
Táhirih as a burning brand of the love of God, a lamp of His
bestowal [MF 190]. One of the functions of this “lamp” was to
be the point from which some of the most challenging features
of the Bahá’í Revelation shone the earliest and brightest. The
most famous demonstration of Táhirih’s unique role in this
regard took place at the Conference of Badasht, a meeting of
eighty-one leaders early in the Bábí movement in 1848.15 One of
the primary purposes of this conference was to address the
question of the Báb’s precise claim. This was necessary because
at that time the Báb’s spiritual station, how His teachings
related to Islam, and what the Bábí movement required on a
social level was not fully disclosed. In the early years of the
Báb’s Dispensation, many people, Muslims and Bábís alike,
understood the teachings of the Báb to be a reform movement
of Islam—part of the Shaykhi school of the Shiah sect of Islam.
At the Conference of Badasht, Bahá’u’lláh, at this time a leader
in the Cause of the Báb, revealed a new Tablet every day,
gradually educating the Báb’s followers on the distinctiveness of
the Báb’s teachings. But it was through Táhirih’s announcement,
supported and protected by Bahá’u’lláh and Quddús, that the
new Dispensation’s break with the past was unmistakably
demonstrated.16 Speaking of Táhirih’s unique role, the Guardian
states:

     It was owing to her initiative, while participating in the
     Conference of Badasht, that the most challenging
     implications of a revolutionary and as yet but dimly
     grasped Dispensation were laid bare before her fellow-
     disciples and the new Order permanently divorced from
     the laws and institutions of Islam. [GPB 74]

  Táhirih is often noted as a champion of the emancipation of
women, but here we see that her function in the Bahá’í
Revelation was much broader—Táhirih is attributed with
publicly proclaiming the emancipation of the Báb’s movement
42                                              Lights of Irfán vol. 17


from Islam and announcing the Advent of a new Day. ‘Abdu’l-
Bahá describes the happening:

     Táhirih, with her face unveiled, stepped from her garden,
     advancing to the pavilion of Bahá’u’lláh; and as she
     came, she shouted aloud these words: “The Trumpet is
     sounding! The great Trump is blown! The universal
     Advent is now proclaimed!” The believers gathered in
     that tent were panic struck, and each one asked himself,
     “How can the Law be abrogated? How is it that this
     woman stands here without her veil?” [MF 198]

   Explaining the magnitude of Táhirih’s action, the Guardian
states: On that memorable day the “Bugle” mentioned in the
Qur’án was sounded, the “stunning trumpet-blast” was loudly
raised... The call she sounded was the death-knell of the twelve
hundred year old law of Islam” [GPB 33-34]. The message is
unmistakably clear that through her initiative Táhirih
contributed significantly to establishing the distinction between
the early Bahá’í Revelation and Islám.
   Paul carried out a similar role, albeit in a different fashion, in
the early days of the Christian Revelation. At the time of Christ
there were many sects of Judaism in the Roman Empire. These
included the Pharisees, the Sadducees, the Zealots, the Essenes,
and the Jesus-movement.17 Just as the early Bábí movement was
considered a sect of Islam, so the early Jesus-movement was
considered a sect of Judaism. In today’s literature, these early
Jewish followers of Jesus are often referred to as ‘Jewish
Christians.’18 The Jewish Christians believed in Jesus as the
Messiah (the Christ), believed His teachings confirmed Judaism
and the Jewish Law (also called Mosaic Law or the Torah), and
followed the traditional Jewish rites and ceremonies of
purification such as sacrificial offerings at the Temple, dietary
laws, and the law of male circumcision.19 But the Jews were not
the only people attracted to Jesus; Gentiles were also attracted
to His teachings.
Parallels in the Ministries of Táhirih and Paul               43


   The word Gentile means clan, tribe, or nations and, as used in
the New Testament, it refers to anyone who is not Jewish.
Gentiles—the Greeks, Romans, and other nationalities of the
Near East—surrounded the Jews who had been a minority
religion in that area for several hundred years. Some Gentiles
became followers of Jesus Christ and these Gentile Christians
differed from the Jewish Christians in that they did not
necessarily follow the Jewish ritual and ceremonial laws of
purification, particularly the law of male circumcision—a
practice which the Greeks and Romans considered a
mutilation.20 Of the early followers in the Jesus-movement, the
Jewish Christian community was the great majority and many
believers within it believed that all of the followers of Christ
should follow Jewish Law. Referring to this dynamic, the
Guardian states: “How great was the obstinacy with which the
Jewish converts among the early Christians adhered to the
ceremonies of their ancestors, and how fervent their eagerness
to impose them on the Gentiles!” [WOB 57] As the Gentile
Christian    community      increased,   conflict   about     the
responsibility of the members to adhere to Jewish rites and
ceremonies also increased.21
   The question confronting the leaders in the Jesus-movement
was: Must a Gentile who wants to join a community of
followers of Christ first become a Jew? Of particular interest
was the question of male circumcision, because at that time the
traditional belief was that “Unless you are circumcised
according to the custom of Moses, you cannot be saved.”22
Paul, who had been ministering to Gentile Christian
communities for years, argued against this requirement. Paul
taught that the law of circumcision as well as other social laws
of Judaism were not obligatory for Gentile followers of the
Messiah, that Christ brought a new Covenant, and that the
disciples should be “ministers of a new Covenant.”23 Paul taught
that salvation for the Gentiles was possible by spiritual
transformation through the love of Christ and that Gentile
adherence to the law of circumcision was not necessary. As
44                                           Lights of Irfán vol. 17


stated in his Letter to the Galatians: “Neither circumcision nor
uncircumcision is anything; but a new creation is everything!”24
   Some of the leaders in the Jesus-movement disagreed with
Paul’s proactive support of Gentile members living outside of
the Jewish laws. The Book of Acts states: “Paul had no small
dissension and debate with them.”25 But eventually Paul and a
small group of Jesus-movement leaders (including Peter) met in
Jerusalem and came to the agreement that circumcision would
not be required of Gentile members, and that only a few Mosaic
Laws would be obligatory: three dietary laws and the
prohibition against sexual immorality and idolatry.26 It was
understood, however, that the Jewish members of the Jesus-
movement would continue with their traditional observance of
Jewish law.27 At this point, Paul assumed a greater leadership
role in the Gentile mission. In his Letter to the Galatians he
states that the outcome of the meeting was “I had been
entrusted with the gospel for the uncircumcised, just as Peter
had been entrusted with the gospel for the circumcised.”28
   But the matter was far from settled. There was no universal
agreement concerning the nature of the mission to the Gentiles
and contention continued in the Jesus-movement: the large
“Jewish Christian conservative wing” on one side and the small
“Gentile Christian liberal wing” on the other.29 Some of the
Jewish followers saw the Gentiles as ritually unclean, and there
was a tone of Gentile subordination. Meanwhile, Paul preached
that these two groups could exist together respectfully in one
community.30 In his Letter to the Galatians he states: “In Christ
Jesus you are all children of God through faith. There is no
longer Jew or Greek... for all of you are one in Christ Jesus.”31
   Eventually, Paul, on his own authority, abrogated the three
dietary laws that had been made obligatory for Gentile
Christians by the leadership in Jerusalem [SAQ 20:2]. He traveled
throughout the Roman Empire cultivating Jesus-movement
communities open to all, encouraging lovers of Jesus Christ to
work together in unity. Over time, the Jewish Christian sect of
Parallels in the Ministries of Táhirih and Paul               45


Judaism declined and virtually disappeared. It was the Gentile
Christian movement championed by Paul that increased to a
new, international, and separate religion—Christianity. ‘Abdu’l-
Bahá praises this outcome. He states: “Observe how numerous
were the diverse nations, races, clans, and tribes who, after the
advent of Christ, gathered through the power of the love of
God under the shadow of His Word” [SAQ 84:5]. Although the
distinction of Christianity as a separate religion did not fully
evolve until decades after Paul’s martyrdom, it is widely
acknowledged in Christian scholarship that Paul is most
responsible for this outcome because it was Paul who
championed the Gentile mission outside of the laws of the
Torah—during his thirty-year ministry as well as through several
of his letters that were preserved over centuries.32
   In Bahá’í history, Táhirih’s role as the ‘trumpet’ of the new
Advent is presented as beginning suddenly with her dramatic
announcement at the conference of Badasht. She then continued
with the same message in her personal teaching until her
martyrdom four years later. Conversely, in Christian history,
Paul’s role as the champion of the new Advent was not focused
on a specific event or dramatic announcement, but was, from
the beginning, a slow process of teaching—in various localities
over a thirty-year period and over centuries through his letters—
what he believed he had been chosen by God to declare: that
Gentiles could find salvation in Christ without adhering to
Jewish rites and ceremonies. Although achieved in different
ways, in their respective religions both Táhirih and Paul are
recognized as the apostles whose singular initiatives contributed
significantly to distinguishing the new Revelation from the old.

Parallel 3: Brilliant Communicators

  Táhirih and Paul were both brilliant communicators. Most of
Táhirih’s writings were destroyed after her martyrdom;
however, the Guardian describes the variety and influence of her
communications. He states: “Through her eloquent pleadings,
46                                            Lights of Irfán vol. 17


her fearless denunciations, her dissertations, poems and
translations, her commentaries and correspondence, she
persisted in firing the imagination, enlisting the allegiance of
Arabs and Persians alike to the new Revelation” [GPB 73].
Táhirih was so effective in her teaching that certain religious
authorities became alarmed and lodged complaints. ‘Abdu’l-
Bahá explains that when challenged by religious leaders “she
presented them with unanswerable proofs, and when one or
another appeared before her she offered him convincing
arguments” [MF 192].
   Despite Táhirih’s restricted travel and her short eight-year
ministry, some of her writings, particularly her poetry, traveled
outside of the Persian Empire. This was made possible in part by
nineteenth-century Western interest in Orientalism, new
communication technologies, and a lively culture of
international journalism. The Guardian states: “The fame of this
immortal woman was noised abroad, and traveling with
remarkable swiftness as far as the capitals of Western Europe,
aroused the enthusiastic admiration and evoked the ardent
praise of men and women of divers nationalities, callings and
cultures” [GPB 75]. Martha Root, a Bahá’í teacher who made
numerous trips around the world in the 1920s and 30s reported:
“I have seen the influence of Táhirih in all the five continents I
had visited.”33
    The proof of the effectiveness of Paul’s communications is
in the outcome of his ministry. He made numerous travel-
teaching trips throughout the Roman Empire where he
established several major centers of Christian activity. He
nurtured these communities with lengthy visits, but when
problems arose and he could not be there in person he wrote
letters to advise and encourage. Many of his letters were
preserved; seven of the Epistles in the New Testament are
considered by most scholars to be authentically Pauline; they
may also represent the earliest Christian writings in existence.34
By virtue of his letters, modern scholars describe Paul as a
literary genius, a conveyor of eternal verities, and one of the
Parallels in the Ministries of Táhirih and Paul                  47


most influential figures in the West.35 His letters, which are still
the focus of intense study, are revered as Scripture in the New
Testament of the Christian Bible—the most published as well as
the most widely distributed book in the history of civilization.

Parallel 4: Vilified from Within

   Both Táhirih and Paul were vilified from within their
respective new religious communities. Persecution from those
outside of the new Faith was a tragic reality in the Apostolic
Age of both the Bahá’í Faith and Christianity, and this was
something that Táhirih and Paul endured with most of the early
believers. But being vilified by many of one’s co-religionists is
something that sets Táhirih and Paul apart.
   Concerning the vilification that Táhirih suffered, the
Guardian states: “The trumpeter was a lone woman, the noblest
of her sex in that Dispensation, whom even some of her co-
religionists pronounced a heretic” [GPB 33-34]. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá
states that Táhirih’s outspoken teaching activities so alarmed
her more rigid fellow-believers that they complained to the Báb
that her behavior was immoral. In the Dawn-Breakers it is
reported that “The Báb, to whom these complaints had been
addressed, replied in the following terms: ‘What am I to say
regarding her whom the Tongue of Power and Glory has named
Táhirih?’” [DB 293] The Báb defended the truth of Táhirih’s
words and confirmed her station as “the Pure One.”
   Like Táhirih, Paul suffered attacks from his co-religionists.
His doctrine of a new Covenant with God through Christ
conflicted with certain Jewish Christians who infiltrated Gentile
Christian communities causing confusion and dissension and
undermining Paul’s authority.36 Biblical scholar Paul Segal notes:
“Almost no Pauline letter forgets to mention Paul’s status as an
apostle through God, underlining his constant need to establish
his credentials.”37 In 2 Corinthians Paul names many of the
dangers that he faced in his ministry including “danger from
false brothers and sisters”38—those being fellow believers early
48                                            Lights of Irfán vol. 17


in the Jesus-movement who tried to sabotage his Torah-free
Gentile mission. Acknowledging Paul’s constant struggles,
‘Abdu’l-Bahá states: “In Saint Paul’s own time no one duly
recognized him; nay, rather, he spent his days amidst difficulties
and contempt.”39 Thus, both Táhirih and Paul were persecuted
from without and vilified from within.

Parallel 5: Appeals to the Government

   Another similarity between Táhirih and Paul is that both
made successful appeals to governmental authorities. In
Memorials of the Faithful ‘Abdu’l-Bahá mentions three
occasions where Táhirih wrote to government officials with
requests. In all three cases her correspondence was heard, action
was taken, and the outcome was what she desired. First, she
wrote to the Governor of Karbilá informing him of her location
when she learned that the authorities had arrested Shamsu’d-
Duhá, believing Shams was Táhirih. In this case, Shams was
released and Táhirih was arrested as she requested [MF 191].
Second, she wrote again to the Governor of Karbilá when the
house arrest he had ordered had gone on for months with no
confirmation from higher authorities. She requested to go to
Baghdad to await an answer there—the governor gave his
consent [MF 192-194]. Third, she wrote to the Governor of
Kirmánsháh when she and her companions were assaulted and
abandoned in the desert by Kirmánsháh officials [MF 194]. The
governor commanded that their belongings be returned and they
be allowed to continue on their journey.
   Traditions recorded in the Book of Acts have Paul
successfully appealing to government authorities as well. In
Philippi, Paul and a companion, Silas, were thrown in jail
without a trial. When an earthquake mysteriously opened the
prison and the nervous magistrates ordered that the two
prisoners be quietly released, Paul refused to leave and, instead,
made a demand for an official governmental apology—which he
got.40 Second, when Paul’s teaching in Jerusalem agitated the
Parallels in the Ministries of Táhirih and Paul                 49


people and this accelerated to mob violence, he was arrested by
the Roman centurions who were going to take him to the
barracks to flog him for disturbing the peace. Paul reportedly
asked the rhetorical question: “Is it legal for you to flog a
Roman citizen who is uncondemned?”41 Consequently he was
taken to Caesarea in safety to await trial before the governor.
And third, after Paul had remained in Caesarea for some time
with no trial decision, he appealed to be tried before the
Emperor in Rome. The appeal was granted and Paul was
transported to Rome where he was able to teach from “his
house” while awaiting trial.42
   Although these stories concerning Paul relayed in the Book of
Acts may not have the historical accuracy of Táhirih’s
biography, it is noteworthy that these particular stories
withstood the test of time: there is something important about
the example of religious visionaries making direct appeals to the
government for justice.

Parallel 6: Rescued by Small Bands of Co-religionists

   In the histories of both faiths there are stories of coordinated
efforts by a few of Táhirih’s and Paul’s co-religionists to rescue
them from certain death early in their ministries.
   Táhirih was rescued in 1847 while she was under house arrest
in Qazvín under false charges of being complicit in the murder
of her uncle, Mullá Taqí. The Mullá’s heirs were demanding her
death. By Bahá’u’lláh’s direction, Táhirih left the house at night
in the company of a fellow believer, met another friend who had
horses outside of the city gates, and rode with her rescuers to
Bahá’u’lláh’s house in Tihrán. Describing this event ‘Abdu’l-
Bahá states, “They managed by a stratagem to free her from that
embroilment and got her to Tihrán in the night” [MF 197]. She
went on to teach for another five years.
   Paul’s Second Letter to the Corinthians, as well as the Book
of Acts, reports a similar situation. When Paul was teaching in
50                                            Lights of Irfán vol. 17


Damascus his co-religionists learned that the governor intended
to have him killed, and that government officials were
monitoring the city gates day and night in order to capture him.
To rescue Paul from certain death “His disciples took him by
night and let him down through an opening in the city wall,
lowering him in a basket.”43 This enabled Paul to get out of
Damascus alive and to continue in his thirty-year ministry.
   These stories of coordinated rescues speak to the prominence
of Táhirih and Paul’s positions and their importance in these
early religious communities.

Parallel 7: Never Attained the Physical Presence
of Her/His Lord

   It is surprising that neither Táhirih nor Paul attained the
physical presence of her/his Lord. Although Táhirih lived during
the time of the Báb, communicated with Him in writing, and
was one of His specially designated Letters of the Living, she
never attained the Báb’s presence in earthly form [MF 188-200].
Similarly, Paul lived during Jesus’ physical lifetime but never
met Him in person. Paul became a follower of Christ after the
crucifixion, and there is no record of His having met Jesus
before his conversion.44

Parallel 8: Contributed to the Process of
Realizing the Equality of Women and Men

   Traditionally, Táhirih and Paul would be seen as polar
opposites on the issue of gender equity. Because of Táhirih’s
investigation of truth independent from her father and
husband, her participation in religious debates, her challenges to
religious authority, her teaching of men and women alike, and
her overall courageous disregard for cultural gender
restrictions, she was the very embodiment of the promotion of
a radical gender equity for her day [MF 188-200]. By virtue of her
initiatives the Guardian states that she was “the first woman
Parallels in the Ministries of Táhirih and Paul                 51


suffrage martyr” [GPB 75]. Paul, on the other hand, is
traditionally associated with biblical verses that uphold a strict
patriarchy.45 However, modern New Testament scholarship has
discovered reasons to vindicate Paul to the degree that many
now recognize him as a visionary for gender equity.46
   One key to “liberating Paul”47 has been the application of
textual analysis48 to the thirteen Pauline Letters,49 resulting in
the discovery of what many scholars believe to be
pseudonymous letters in the Pauline collection; that is, letters
claiming Pauline authorship that were not written by Paul
himself.50,51 These pseudonymous letters include 1 Timothy,
home to this notorious verse: “Let a woman learn in silence with
full submission. I permit no woman to teach or to have
authority over a man; she is to keep silent.”52 Like this passage,
many of the patriarchal messages that were once believed to
present Paul’s teachings are found in what, now, are largely
believed to be inauthentic or disputed letters.53
   Another key to the “new Paul”54 of modern scholarship is the
identification of what many scholars believe are interpolated
verses in the authentic Pauline Letters; that is, passages added to
Paul’s letters by an unknown author or authors some time after
his death.55 One example of a suspected interpolated verse is
this passage in First Corinthians that echoes the sentiment cited
above in First Timothy: “As in all the churches of the saints,
women should be silent in the churches. For they are not
permitted to speak, but should be subordinate, as the law also
says. If there is anything they desire to know, let them ask their
husbands at home. For it is shameful for a woman to speak in
church.”56 A widespread claim, and one that is supported by
textual criticism, asserts that the above passage was added to
First Corinthians decades after Paul’s death. This and other
patriarchal teachings attributed to Paul after his martyrdom are
seen by Karen Elliott and other scholars as “sad evidence to how
quickly the Church retreated from Paul’s more egalitarian
practice” in the decades after his martyrdom.57 While in the
Bahá’í Writings there is no commentary on possible
52                                            Lights of Irfán vol. 17


interpolations in or the authenticity of any of the Pauline
Letters, it is the personal opinion of this author that the
prevailing scholarship on this topic—which supports the
identification of certain inauthentic letters as well as
interpolated verses—has great integrity. The analysis presented
in the rest of this paper is based on that premise.
   In addition to scholarship regarding inauthentic letters and
interpolations in the Pauline Letters, understanding verses in
light of Paul’s historical context has assisted in recovering what
is widely believed to be Paul’s more egalitarian original message.
For example, in 1 Corinthians Paul declares that a woman
should be veiled in meetings when she prays and prophesies,
while a man should remain bareheaded. A conventional
interpretation of this instruction is that it was an example of
Paul’s subjugation of women. However, Sara Ruden, a scholar
of ancient literature, believes that Paul’s insistence on the
veiling of women in his churches was a movement toward
egalitarianism. At that time the veil was a sign of purity, honor,
and authority58 that was legally denied less fortunate women
such as slaves, prostitutes, or those labeled ‘adulteress.’ Ruden
states:

     I think Paul’s rule aimed toward an outrageous equality.
     All Christian women were to cover their heads in church,
     without     distinction   of    beauty,     wealth,  [or]
     respectability... This had never happened in any public
     gathering before... This, I believe, was Paul’s ingenious
     combination of common sense and radical defiance for
     dealing with a very touchy set of issues.59

   It is noteworthy that the rigid roles assigned to women in the
verses proven or suspected to be inauthentic contradict Paul’s
overall egalitarian treatment of women and his authentic
teaching that: “There is no longer male and female; for all of
you are one in Christ Jesus.”60 In this verse and others like it,
Paul challenges the gender prejudice of his time.61 There is also
evidence that he backed up his teachings in action. Although
Parallels in the Ministries of Táhirih and Paul                 53


surrounded by a religious culture that denied women leadership
roles, Paul’s authenticated letters demonstrate that he supported
the leadership of women. For example, he refers to Priscilla as a
“fellow worker in Christ,”62 Euodia and Syntych are described as
“co-workers” whose names “are recorded in the book of life,”63
Phoebe is named as a “deacon,”64 and Junia is praised as an
“apostle of Christ.”65 Paul’s genuine letters abound with
appreciation for the leadership of women in the early Christian
communities. In addition, Paul taught a mutual respect for and
responsibility between husband and wife that was revolutionary
in his day. For example, he states, “In the Lord, woman is not
independent of man or man independent of woman.”66 And
“The husband should give to his wife her conjugal rights, and
likewise the wife to her husband.”67 This was radical teaching in
Paul’s Hellenistic world where women were considered property
in marriage.
    In short, the arguments supporting the identification of
inauthentic letters and interpolations, along with increased
consideration of historical context—all of which have resulted
in a paradigm shift in modern Pauline studies—present
substantial evidence that a “new perspective on Paul”68 is
justified; one that recognizes him as being progressive for his
day in the area of social justice, including gender equity. From
the point of view of studies on the “new Paul,” contributing to
the process of the realization of the equality of women and men
is something that Táhirih and Paul have in common.

Parallel 9: Martyrdom During the Time of
Wholesale Massacre of Early Believers

  If tradition faithfully carries the truth of Paul’s death, he and
Táhirih may share another parallel—martyrdom at a time of
wholesale massacre of early believers.
   Táhirih was martyred during the time of the slaughter of the
followers of the Báb after the attempt on the life of the Sháh in
August of 1852. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá explains:
54                                             Lights of Irfán vol. 17


     Thus she remained, a helpless captive. Then came the
     attempt on the life of the Sháh;69 a farman was issued;
     she was sentenced to death. Saying she was summoned to
     the Prime Minister's, they arrived to lead her away from
     the Kalantar's house. She bathed her face and hands,
     arrayed herself in a costly dress, and scented with attar
     of roses she came out of the house.

     They brought her into a garden, where the headsmen
     waited; but these wavered and then refused to end her
     life. A slave was found, far gone in drunkenness;
     besotted, vicious, black of heart. And he strangled
     Táhirih. He forced a scarf between her lips and rammed
     it down her throat. Then they lifted up her unsullied
     body and flung it in a well, there in the garden, and over
     it threw down earth and stones. But Táhirih rejoiced; she
     had heard with a light heart the tidings of her
     martyrdom; she set her eyes on the supernal Kingdom
     and offered up her life. [MF 200]

   While the circumstances of Táhirih’s martyrdom are known,
there is no official record of Paul’s passing. However, it is
traditionally believed that Paul was martyred around 64 A.D.
after the burning of Rome during the slaughter of Christians
ordered by Emperor Nero.70 A passage in 1 Clement, an early
Christian letter written from Rome to the Corinthians, suggests
that Paul was killed in Rome. The letter states:

     Through jealousy and strife, Paul showed the way to the
     prize of endurance; seven times he was in bonds, he was
     exiled, he was stoned, he was a herald both in the East
     and in the West, he gained the noble fame of his faith,
     he taught righteousness to all the world, and when he had
     reached the limits of the West he gave his testimony
     [martyrēsas, or “was martyred”] before the rulers, and
     thus passed from the world and was taken up into the
     Holy Place—the greatest example of endurance.71
Parallels in the Ministries of Táhirih and Paul               55


   Although not corroborated by numerous sources, it is a
common “historical guess” that “Paul, and presumably Peter as
well, died among those many Christians martyred by Nero in 64
A.D.”72 Both Táhirih and Paul suffered for their Cause; Táhirih
suffered martyrdom, and it is traditionally believed that Paul
suffered martyrdom as well.
   In summary, both Táhirih and Paul:
   1. Had mystical visions of the Manifestation of God before
      their conversions.
   2. Are recognized for singular initiatives that contributed
      significantly to distinguishing the new Revelation from
      the old.
   3. Were brilliant communicators.
   4. Were vilified from within their respective new religious
      communities.
   5. Made successful appeals to government authorities.
   6. Were rescued by small bands of co-religionists early in
      their ministries.
   7. Never attained the physical presence of her/his Lord.
   8. Contributed to the process of realizing the equality of
      women and men.
   9. Táhirih suffered martyrdom; tradition holds that Paul was
      also martyred.

Conclusion

A Type of Early Apostle—This Time, a Woman

   The parallels in the ministries of Táhirih and Paul paint a
picture of a type of early apostle who bears much of the burden
of distinguishing new Revelation from the old: a pure channel
with the capacity to envision a new kind of community; a
56                                            Lights of Irfán vol. 17


person of action at once valued by and threatening to his or her
co-religionists; a kind of maverick in the new religious order. It
is notable that this role—which in the Christian Dispensation
was accomplished by a man—was, in the Bahá’í Dispensation,
carried out by a woman. Táhirih’s ministry is evidence that
spiritual qualities and capacities of service know no gender
restrictions.

Knowledge Leads to Unity

   In the Persian Bayán the Báb describes the Letters of the
Living as the first to have knelt before the throne of God:

     Let there be no doubt that man’s glory is in testifying
     unto God’s unity, in recognizing Him, acknowledging
     His justice, obeying Him and seeking His good pleasure.
     It is, however, certain that these sacred souls have
     attained, before anyone else, unto that which is the
     quintessence of all excellence and glory. Further, there
     can be no doubt that they were the first Lights who
     bowed down before God, accepted the verses He hath
     revealed unto His Báb, and proclaimed them to the
     world. (Persian Bayán 1:273)

   The spiritual station of the Letters of the Living is
unimaginably glorious—they inspire love, admiration, and
humility in the Bahá’í community. It is especially interesting,
then, that the Báb continues His commentary by stating that the
Letters of the Living are the return of the spiritual qualities of
the holy souls of each Dispensation before them:

     They are the lights which in the past have eternally
     prostrated themselves and will prostrate themselves
     eternally in the future, before the celestial throne. In
     each Dispensation, they are called by different names
     amongst the people, and in each Revelation, their
     individual names are also changed. Yet, the names of
Parallels in the Ministries of Táhirih and Paul                   57


     their inmost realities, which refer unto God, are manifest
     in their hearts. [Persian Bayán 1:274]

    Although there is no direct comparison of Táhirih and Paul in
the Bahá’í Writings, the concept of the Letters of the Living as
the return of the spiritual qualities of the first believers of past
Dispensations seems to be demonstrated in their ministries. In
several ways, Táhirih and Paul carried out similar functions,
rose to similar challenges, and, in doing so, demonstrated
similar spiritual qualities. The principle of progressive
revelation recognizes every Manifestation of God as the
spiritual return of the Manifestations of the past [KI 152];
according to the above passages from the Bayán, we might also
understand the apostles in any religious history to be the
“return” of the spiritual qualities of the apostles before them.
To reflect on this point—that the beloved figures in one’s
religious history are, in a spiritual sense, the return of the
beloved figures of other religious traditions—could be a helpful
step toward unity. Because of their affinity in mission,
circumstances, and spiritual qualities, to love and revere Táhirih
is, in a sense, to love and revere Paul. In the same sense, to love
and revere Mulláh Husayn, Quddús, Vahid, and all of the
Letters of the Living is to love and revere Peter, Phillip, James,
and all of the Apostles of Christ.
   When reaching out in goodwill to those of different religious
traditions, there is, perhaps, no better strategy than to
authentically love and revere the spiritual giants of those
traditions. Bahá’u’lláh states: “Cleave unto that which draweth
you together and uniteth you” [GWB CXI]. Knowledge of the
parallels in the ministries of Táhirih and Paul is valuable because
these parallels remind us of the shared spiritual ancestry of the
Bahá’í Faith and Christianity and prompt us to hold onto that
unity.

    Describing Táhirih’s high spiritual station, the Guardian states that Táhirih
     is, along with Bahiyyih Khánum, comparable in rank to those immortal
     heroines: Sarah, Ásíyih, the Virgin Mary, [and] Fátimah. [GPB 75; MBW
     74]
2
    Paul is mentioned favorably in the Bahá’í Writings: Bahá’u’lláh refers to
     him as Saint Paul [ESW 91]; ‘Abdu’l-Bahá states, One's conduct must be
     like the conduct of Paul [SWAB 189.5]; and in a London talk ‘Abdu’l-Bahá
     refers to him as Saint Paul the Great Apostle [ABL 23]. In the opinion of
     biblical scholars John Dominic Crossan and Marcus Borg, “Paul is second
     only to Jesus as the most important person in the origins of Christianity.”2
     [Borg and Crossan, p. 1; See also Donaldson, p. 1062; Hill, p. 1083]

    “The Bahá’í community ... has its origins in the Bábí movement, a religion
     which began in Iran in 1844. Its founder, Sayyid ‘Alí Mu˙ammad Shirazi,
     who took the title the Báb (1819—1850), was executed in 1850 in the midst
     of a general persecution of the Bábís that culminated in a general massacre
     in 1852. In about 1866, Mírzá Husayn ‘Alí Nuri (1817—1892), who took
     the title Bahá’u’lláh, openly claimed to be the religious leader prophesied
     by the Báb in his writings. Since more than 90% of the surviving Bábís
     became followers of Bahá’u’lláh, Bahá’ís, at about this time, it is
     legitimate from the sociological and historical view-point to regard these
     two movements, the Bábís and the Bahá’ís, as one movement: the Bahá’í
     Faith” [Momen, p. 221].

    In this paper, by “conversion” is meant the recognition and following of
     the Manifestation of God in a new Revelation, not the denial or rejection
     of the traditional religion. (Concerning the nature of Paul’s conversion,
     see Segal, p. 117, 129-30; Gager, p. 53)

    The “Ahsánu’l-Qisás,” the Báb's commentary on the Súrih of Joseph, was

     In the Dawn-Breakers Nabíl describes Táhirih’s announcement as it
      appeared to the group: an unexpected appearance that aggravated Quddús
      who represented the more conservative of the believers. However, the
      Guardian explains that this apparent confrontation was planned by
      Bahá’u’lláh with Táhirih and Quddús in order to educate the followers of
      the Báb and still safeguard Táhirih. The Guardian states, “Quddús,
      regarded as the exponent of the conservative element within it, affected,
      in pursuance of a pre-conceived plan designed to mitigate the alarm and
      consternation which such a conference was sure to arouse, to oppose the
      seemingly extremist views advocated by the impetuous Táhirih” [GPB 31].

     It should be noted that this conflict was within the Jesus-movement itself,

     The Pauline Letters (Epistles), so named because they begin with Paul’s
     name and therefore appear to claim Pauline authorship, are, in order of
     appearance in the New Testament: Romans, 1 Corinthians, 2 Corinthians,
     Galatians, Ephesians, Philippians, Colossians, 1 Thessalonians, 2
     Thessalonians, 1 Timothy, 2 Timothy, Titus, and Philemon.
50
     There is wide agreement in New Testament scholarship that 1 Timothy, 2
     Timothy, Titus, and Ephesians are pseudonymous letters [Drury, p. 1220;
     Dunn, p. 1166], while Colossians and 2 Thessalonians are “hotly debated”
     [Murphy-O’Connor, p. 1191; Esler, p. 1213].
51
     J. D. G. Dunn and other scholars describe the pseudonymous letters as
     understandable considering the accepted tradition of the time of
     pseudonymously writing in the name of a revered teacher. However, Neil
     Elliott states that these letters are not typical pseudonymous writings, that
     is, “transparent fictions”, but are, instead, deliberate forgeries “written to
     subvert other second-century Christian communities that had preserved
     elements of Paul’s truth” [Neil Elliott, p. 31].
