An outstanding characteristic of the Bahá'í dispensation is the way in which scripture has often been cast in
the forms peculiar to established literary genres in Islamic culture. Many individual pieces of revelation
purposely utilize certain literary models as a vehicle for the Word of God. Bahá'u'lláh’s Haft Vádí (Seven
Valleys) recalls Farídu’d-Dín-i ‘Aṭṭár’s Manṭiqu’ṭ-Ṭayr (Parliament of the Birds); His “Qaṣídiy-i
Varqá’iyih” challenges in its mystical sublimity Ibnu’l-Fáriḍ’s “Naẓmu’s-Sulúk” (“Poem of the Way”); His
Tablets to the Kings evoke the “Mirrors for Princes” literature; His Kitáb-i Aqdas (The Most Holy Book) is
in its incomparable power, authority, and inimitable eloquence reminiscent of the Qur’án itself. However,
the recognition that some of Bahá'u'lláh’s writings have a complex cultural context in no sense implies a
detraction from the vigorous originality of style and thought invariably exhibited in His Tablets.1 Even those
of His works that fall within a particular genre invariably transcend it in their meaning and spiritual impact,
and it is important to note that for the most part Bahá'u'lláh chose to speak from within a highly formalized
tradition only to rely to a request from a representative of that tradition.

A further case in point is the Lawḥ-i Ḥikmat (Tablet of Wisdom), which was revealed for the eminent
Bahá'í teacher Áqá Muḥammad Nabíl-i Akbar, who was deeply versed in Islamic philosophy.2 Indeed, the
Tablet of Wisdom provides one with several literary forms: ethical maxims, a treatise on cosmogony in the
tradition of Aristotle’s De generatione et corruption (On Coming-to-be- and Passing-away), a discourse on
the relationship between philosophy an revelation, and a brief biographical treatment of some major Greek
philosophers.3 The Tablet of Wisdom is a major one and will undoubtedly give rise o its own library. But I
shall here be concerned only with the biographical section and its background in Islamic models. For unlike
the Tablets mentioned above that fall into particular genres, the section on the biographies of the

\[1\] This point is cogently made by Professor Amín Banání in his “The Writings of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá,” World Order, 6, No. 1 (Fall
> 1971), p. 68: “In their literal-minded zeal to aver the authenticity of their Holy Writ, devotees of traditional religions have often
> insisted on the divine authorship of the very lexical and syntactic form of that Writ. This view not only reduces God to the use
> of particular and different human tongues, but it also attempts to isolate religious writings from the body of the language in

> the literary traditions, conceptual methods, cultural associations — in short by denying the life of the language — they reduce
> rather than enhance comprehension and true appreciation of holy scriptures.”

philosophers contains some actual quotations from Muslim historians and biographers; this makes it
particularly interesting. Bahá'u'lláh is here writing in a tradition of Muslim biographical literature on the
Greeks, a tradition that includes Ṣá‘id al-Andalusi (1029-1070 A.D.),4 Abú’l-Fatḥ ash-Shahristání (1076-
115),5 Jamálu’d-Dín al-Qifṭí (1172-1248),6 Muwaffaqu’d-Dín ibn Abí Uṣaybi’ah (c. 1194-1270),7 and
‘Imádu’d-Dín Abú’l-Fidá’ (1273-1331).8

But before turning to a discussion of this Tablet, it will be necessary to treat the problem of sources in
relation to the study of revealed scripture. While the practice of revealing some Tablets in a form
reminiscent of previous great works in Islamic culture — and even quoting from these — lends a subtlety
and sophistication to Bahá'í scripture unparalleled in previous dispensations, it might also open Bahá'u'lláh
to charges that His profound knowledge and insight were the natural result of long years of formal study and
reading. Bahá'u'lláh Himself refers to this problem in The Seven Valleys:

> There is many an utterance of the mystic seers and doctors of former times which I have not mentioned
> here, since I mislike the copious citation from sayings of the past; for quotation from the words of others
> proveth acquired learning, not the divine bestowal. Even so much as We have quoted here is out of
> deference to the wont of men and after the manner of the friends.9
As a member of the Persian aristocracy, Bahá'u'lláh was literate but not well educated by the standards
of the Muslim intellectuals, and His only justification for speaking authoritatively on such involved subjects
as dialectical theology (kalám), ṣúfism, and philosophy (ḥikmah) was His claim to innate knowledge and
divine inspiration.

By His own testimony and that of all other reliable sources for His life, Bahá'u'lláh never pursued formal
studies at a masjid (college mosque), masjid-i jámi’ (cathedral mosque), madrasih (school specializing in
Islamic law), or takíyih (ṣúfí seminary). As He never studied the basic syllabus of Islamic thought with a
recognized master, He would hardly have been considered qualified to attend study sessions on
philosophical issues (majálís an-naẓar), which were conducted only by the most accomplished and erudite
scholars.10 In the world of Islamic learning, one could obtain credentials (ijázih) to speak with authority on a
certain subject only by studying and mastering the basic texts in this field, either with their authors or
indirectly through a line of their pupils.

Contemporary Westerners obtain a great part of their education through independent or at most directed
reading rather than through the memorization of authoritative interpretations stretching back centuries.
Indeed, they are taught to attack “authorities” unmercifully whenever the opportunity presents itself. It is
thus difficult to imagine how utterly audacious Bahá'u'lláh (in His guise of the hermit “Darvísh
Muḥammad”) must have seemed to Shaykh Ismá‘íl and his students at the Khálidíyyih Takíyih in ‘Iráq

when He dared to criticize certain ideas propounded by the celebrated ṣúfí master Muḥyu’d-Dín ibnu’l-
‘Arabí in his al-Futúḥát al-Makkiyyah, on no other authority than His own.11

In the face of this insistence on the importance of transmitted knowledge and the received tradition,
Bahá'u'lláh championed self-reliance and innovation. He attacked the blind emulation of past tradition
(taqlíd), which was so important for legalistic Muslims.12 Beyond this, He defiantly announced His own
independence of the centuries-long chain of transmission by claiming powers which, were they the property
of an ordinary human being, would be the concern of parapsychologists. For example, Bahá'u'lláh describes
in the Tablet of Wisdom how He often had visions during which He saw and was able to read passages from
books He had not previously encountered:

Thou knowest full well that We perused not the books which men possess and We acquired not the
> learning current amongst them, and yet whenever We desire to quote the saying of the learned and of the
> wise, presently there will appear before the face of thy Lord in the form of a tablet all that which hath
> appeared in the world and is revealed in the Holy Books and Scriptures. Thus do we set down in writing
> that which the eye perceiveth.13
Here Bahá'u'lláh is making a definite point of the fact that His knowledge was not acquired through
normal channels. More important for my purpose, He indicates quite clearly that He has quoted from some
of the learned and the philosophers in the course of the Lawḥ-i Ḥikmat. I shall now proceed to investigate
the sources of some of these quotations.

The knowledge the Muslims had about the biographies of the ancient Greeks came for the most part
from Hellenistic Neoplatonic and Christian writers.14 Since many early Greek texts had been lost or were
unavailable in the Near East, this knowledge was often limited and somewhat colored by its Christian
sources. Moreover, the Muslims seem to have known nothing about the Greek system of dating either by
archons or by Olympiads (the first of which occurred in 776 B.C.), and their only fairly dependable point of
reference for Greek civilization was Alexander the Great’s conquests, as known from Perso-Babylonian
chronology. Most Muslim historians were notoriously lax about the dating of events prior to the advent of
Islám, though there were notable exceptions to this generalization such as Abú-Rayḥán-i Bírúní (973-1050
A.D.) and the Syrian prince and geographer Abú’l-Fidá’.

One of the earlier and more influential Muslim accounts of the lives of the Greek philosophers is
contained in the Andalusian historian Ṣá‘id of Toledo’s Ṭa’rikhu’l-Ḥukamá’ (Biographies of the
Philosophers), as well as by many other writers, including ibn Abí Uṣaybi’ah. A similar tradition of the
biography of Greek sages is represented by Shahrastání’s celebrated al-Milal wa’n-Niḥal (Religious
Communities and Creeds), which might well be considered one of the pioneering works in the development
of the History of Religions. Finally, Abú’l-Fidá’ was able to draw on all of these authors and others as well
in his al-Mukhtaṣar fí Akhbár al-Bashar (An Abridged History of Mankind).

The most significant difference between the Ṣá‘id and Shahrastání versions lies in their categorizations
of the great philosophers. Ṣá‘id counts five great early philosophers; in chronological order they are
Empedocles, Pythagoras, Socrates, Plato, and Aristotle.15 Shahrastání, however, enumerates seven eminent

figures in early Greek philosophy: Thales, Anaxagoras, Anaximenes, Empedocles, Pythagoras, Socrates,
and Plato.16 Aristotle is not considered “early” by Shahrastání and is presented as the greatest of the later
figures. Both Ṣá‘id and Shahrastání discuss Hippocrates separately from these philosophers.

Abú’l-Fidá’ combines these two schemas.17 He treats: Thales, Empedocles, Pythagoras, Hippocrates,
Socrates, Plato, and Aristotle as the first and the most eminent of the philosophers. He then draws upon al-
Qifṭí for some notices on lesser figures, including one Múrṭas or Múrisṭus, the inventor of a remarkable
organ that could be heard sixty miles away.18 A comparison of these schemas will show that the Lawḥ-i
Ḥikmat follows Abú’l-Fidá’s ordering, even down to a mention of Múrṭas, who is not referred to by either
Ṣá‘id or Shahrastání.19 The major difference is that Bahá'u'lláh’s account leaves out Thales and begins with
Empedocles. As Thales was not quite so renowned in Islamic philosophy as the other figures, the omission
is a natural one. Bahá'u'lláh does treat one additional philosopher who was neglected by the above
biographers: Apollonius of Tyana (b. circa 4 B.C.), the neo-Pythagorean who had a major influence on the
development of Neoplatonism and thence on Islamic philosophy.20 I have so far been unable to identify the
exact source for Bahá'u'lláh’s quotations about Apollonius.
In order to substantiate my contention that Bahá'u'lláh both quoted from and paraphrased the Muslim
historians I have mentioned I shall give examples for comparison below. The texts have been translated in
such a way as to show differences in the Arabic, which is provide in transliterated form in the footnotes.
Phrases in the earlier texts that are identical to ones in the Lawḥ-i Ḥikmat have been italicized.

While the statements of Shahrastání and Bahá'u'lláh about Empedocles are similar in wording and
content, they are too brief to be evidential in themselves. I shall quote them here to give an idea of the
context of Bahá'u'lláh’s assertion of the contemporary of Empedocles and the Prophet David. Shahrastání
says of Empedocles:

> He was a contemporary of David the Prophet, peace be upon him. He went to him and received
> knowledge from him. And he studied with Luqmán the Wise and obtained wisdom from him.21
The Lawḥ-i Ḥikmat has:

Empedocles, who distinguished himself in philosophy was a contemporary of David….22

Both Ṣá‘id and Abú’l-Fidá’ make somewhat similar statements.23

Concerning Pythagoras, al-Milal wa’n-Niḥal says:
> He lived in the days of Solomon the Prophet, the son of David, peace be upon them, and acquired
> Wisdom from the treasury of prophethood. He was wise and virtuous, a possessor of sound views and a
> serene mind. He claimed that he perceived the exalted worlds with his senses and his intuition. He
> practised self-discipline until he reached the point where he heard the whispering sounds of the heavens
> and reached the station of the angels.24
The Lawḥ-i Ḥikmat has:

> while Pythagoras lived in the days of Solomon, son of David, and acquired Wisdom from the treasury of
> prophethood. It is he who claimed to have heard the whispering sound of the heavens and to have
> attained the station of the angels.25

Here the entirety of Bahá'u'lláh’s account is quoted or paraphrased from Shahrastání. Abú’l-Fidá’ has a
much shorter biography for Pythagoras than does Shahrastání and drops the phrase “and acquired Wisdom
from the treasury of Prophethood.”

But while the wording of the Tablet of Wisdom is closer to that of Shahrastání in the case of Empedocles
and Pythagoras, the section on Socrates obviously depends rather on Abú’l-Fidá’. The latter writes:

> Among them was Socrates. Shahrastání said in al-Milal wa’n-Niḥal that he was indeed wise,
> accomplished and righteous. He practised self-denial and turned away from material pleasures. He
> withdrew to the mountains where he dwelt in a cave. He forbade men to join partners with God or
> worship idols, until the rabble rose up against him. They obliged their king to kill him. So he
> imprisoned him and gave him poison to drink.26
Bahá'u'lláh writes:

> After him came Socrates who was indeed wise, accomplished and righteous. He practiced self-denial,
> repressed his appetites for selfish desires and turned away from material pleasures. He withdrew to the
> mountains where he dwelt in a cave. He dissuaded men from worshipping idols and taught them the way
> of God, the Lord of Mercy, until the ignorant rose up against him. They arrested him and put him to
> death in prison.27

While Abú’l-Fidá’ is quoting Shahrastání in this section, he introduced some slight changes into the text,
changes which also appear in the Tablet of Wisdom. This would seem to indicate that Bahá'u'lláh’s
quotations for some of these biographies were mediated through Abú’l-Fidá’. In some cases, however,
phrases present in the Shahrastání version that were dropped by Abú’l-Fidá’ show up in the Lawḥ-i Ḥikmat.
This suggests that either Bahá'u'lláh was drawing upon both Shahrastání and Abú’l-Fidá’ or that some later
compiler collated the two, and Bahá'u'lláh was quoting the later source.

One of the consistent emphases in these biographies, both in the Muslim historians and in the Tablet of
Wisdom, is the debt owed by the early Greek philosophical tradition to the wisdom of the Hebrew prophets.
Shahrastání has Empedocles study with David, and all are agreed that Pythagoras studied Solomonic
philosophy in Egypt. The possibility that the strong ethical emphasis and the tendency toward monotheism
observable in many of these Greek thinkers owes something to a cultural diffusion from Palestine of
Hebraic religious concepts cannot be discounted, though there is no direct proof for it in t Greek sources.
But the assertion that Empedocles and David, and Pythagoras and Solomon, were contemporaries stands in
direct contradiction to the dating of both ancient and modern Western scholarship and even to that of most
Muslim historians.

While David and Solomon are thought by modern historians to have lived in the tenth century B.C.,
Diogenes Laertius asserts that Pythagoras flourished in the sixtieth Olympiad (540-536 B.C.).28 Quoting
Apollodorus, the same source says that Empedocles went to Thurii just after it was founded (c. 445-444

B.C.). That is to say, our ancient Greek and Hebrew sources have Empedocles live after Pythagoras and die
a full five hundred years after the passing of Solomon. There is, then, a very great discrepancy between
these dates and those given by Ṣá‘id and Shahrastání.

One of the earlier sustained discussions of the chronological relationship of ancient Israel and Greece is
contained in the Stromateis (Miscellanies) of Clement of Alexandria (150-211/15 A.D.). Clement attempted
to show that Hebrew wisdom was far older than Greek philosophy and that the Greeks knew the Jewish
scriptures intimately, often quoting (or misquoting) them. For example, he argued that the createdness of the
world in Greek thought derived from a knowledge of the book of Genesis.30 Clement examines the
chronological traditions about Jewish and Greek figures and demonstrates that Moses lived not only before
the birth of men in the Greek system but before many of their gods came to be.31 He asserts that the
prophets Zechariah and Haggai, who prophesied at the time of Darius, lived before the oldest of the Greek
philosophers, Thales. He has Pythagoras flourish even later, in the sixty-second Olympiad (540-536 B.C.).32
Clement seems to have erred by about a hundred years in the former statement; for, if modern dating is
correct, Zechariah began his ministry in October-November 520 B.C. (Zech. 1:1), about a century later than
Clement apparently reckoned.33 But this Greek scholar, while he may have made Persian dates a century too
early, clearly insists that Pythagoras is very close to that of Diogenes Laertius.

Augustine of Hippo (354-430 A.D.) was also struck by the similarities between some of Plato’ concepts
and those of the Hebrew prophets. He wrote in his De civitate Dei (The City of God):

> Some have concluded from this that when he [Plato] went to Egypt he had heard the prophet Jeremiah,
> or, whilst travelling in the same country, he had read the prophetic scriptures, which opinion I myself
> have expressed in certain of my writings. But a careful calculation of dates, contained in chronological
> history, shows that Plato was born about a hundred years after the time in which Jeremiah prophesied.34

Augustine also notes that the Old Testament had not yet been translated into Greek in Plato’s time and
finally suggests that God’s grace rather than any direct cultural contact can explain the similarities between
the Greek philosophical and the Judeo-Christian traditions.

But while early Christian scholars like Clement and Augustine argued that the Hebrew prophetic
tradition was centuries older than the Greek philosophical tradition, by medieval times a different
chronology held sway. Even during the Renaissance many scholars believed that Pythagoras had been a
contemporary of Moses and had read the Hebrew scriptures. The Cambridge Platonist Henry More (1614-
87) wrote: “that Pythagoras drew his knowledge from the Hebrew Fountains, is what all Writers, Sacred and
Prophane, do testifie and aver.”35 The Greek biographical tradition about Pythagoras asserted that he went
to Egypt and studied with Pharaonic priests. Since Egypt was the birthplace of Mosaic Judaism, it was
natural for Jewish ad Christian authors to wonder whether Pythagoras might not also have encountered
Hebrew wisdom there. The Muslim historians’ assertions about Pythagoras and Empedocles having lived in
the time of David and Solomon may thus be seen as variation on this medieval legend.

Given that the Muslim writers assert that the founding of the Hebrew kingdom and the inception of the
pre-Socratic age in Greece were practically simultaneous, it would seem useful to attempt to relate this
relative chronology to an absolute chronology. When did the Muslims think these things occurred?

Ṣá‘id’s account has it that Pythagoras lived a while after Empedocles and that he personally taught
Socrates and Plato.36 He then says that Aristotle was Plato’s favorite pupil and that Aristotle went on to
teach Alexander the Great.37 He later mentions that Thales was one of Pythagoras’ teachers.38 Thus it is
very clear that Ṣá‘id thought Empedocles and Pythagoras to have lived just before the age of Alexander the
Great.

Shahrastání’s ordering, listing Thales, Anaximenes, Anaxagoras, Empedocles, Pythagoras, and Socrates,
also seems to indicate that he is following a chronology similar to that of Diogenes Laertius, who puts
Thales c. 624-545 B.C., and who has Pythagoras flourish just after Thales’ death. Like Ṣá‘id, Shahrastání
says that Socrates studied with Pythagoras.39

Abú’l-Wafá’ al- Mubashshir says that Empedocles and Socrates were both contemporaries of Zeno.40

This squares with the accepted dates for these figures (Empedocles: 490-430 B.C.; Socrates: 470-399; Zena:
495-430). Following al-Mubasshir, ibn Abí Uṣaybi‘ah report that Pythagoras was a young man during the
reign of Cyrus, that he was still alive when Cambyses succeeded his father.41 Cyrus reigned from 559-530

B.C., and Cambyses from 530-522, according to our ancient sources. Modern historians give Pythagoras’
dates as c. 50-500 B.C. If these dates are valid, Pythagoras would in fact still have been a young man when
Cyrus acceded to the throne in Persia and would have still been alive throughout Cambyses’ reign.

Thus all major Muslim sources without exception agree that Pythagoras and Empedocles lived sometime
in the sixth and fifth centuries B.C. Moreover, this dating generally conforms with that of our classical
sources, except for the tendency to make Empedocles Pythagoras’ older contemporary. Their assertion that
these two philosophers were contemporaries of David and Solomon clearly implies that they thought the

founders of the Hebrew kingdom to have lived after the sack of Jerusalem by Nebuchadnezzar in 586 B.C.

— the event which brought the independent Jewish kingdom to a end!43 This claim is not only preposterous
according to Western dating, but it is also at variance with what the Muslims themselves wrote about the
chronology of ancient Israel.
While Muslim historians had a great deal of difficulty with ancient dates, even they agreed that David and
Solomon had lived centuries before the birth of Nebuchadnezzar. Abú-Rayḥán al Bírúní says that between
the founding of the Temple during Solomon’s reign and its destruction by Nebuchadnezzar was 410 years.44
Moreover, he indicates that from the beginning of the reign of Nebuchadnezzar to the accession of
Alexander the Great to the Babylonian throne was 285 years.45 The modern date for the beginning of
Solomon’s reign is c. 960 B.C.; for the destruction of the Temple, 586 B.C.; for the beginning of
Nebuchadnezzar’s reign, 605 B.C.; and for Alexander’s conquest of Babylon, 331 B.C. It can thus be seen
that Bírúní’s chronology for these events differs only by a few decades from that of modern historians but
certainly not b centuries.

A slightly greater discrepancy with modern dating can be found in Abú’l-Fidá’s chronology. This
geographer and historian, whose al-Mukhtaṣar is essentially an abridgment of the al-Kámil fí’t-Ta’ríkh by
ibnu’l-Athír (1160-1233 A.D.), was keenly struck by the latter’s carelessness about dates of pre-Islamic
events. He, therefore attempted to construct a conversion table for finding equivalents of dates from the
Jewish, Perso-Babylonian, Christian, Greek, and Roman sources. He does not take into account, however,
the difference between solar and lunar calendars. For the sake of simplicity I shall treat his years as solar
years.

Since Abú’l-Fidá’ gives dates before Christ in one column of his table, it is a simple enough process to
establish his chronology for the Hebrew prophets and the Greek philosophers.46 Below is a comparative
chart with Abú’l-Fidá’s dates on one side and modern chronology on the other.

Abú’l-Fidá’ (B.C.)         Modern Dating (B.C.)
> Moses                       d. 1716                    d. 1200s
> David                       d. 1181                    d. 960
> Solomon                     d. 1141                    d. 922
> Nebuchadnezzar              r. fr. 738                 r. fr. 605
> Thales                      fl. c. 738                 624-545
> Hippocrates                 fl. 542                    460-377

Socrates                    fl. 369                    470-399

There are some interesting features in Abú’l-Fidá’s chronology. He dates Moses five hundred years
earlier than is now thought likely. He is quite correct that Thales was a contemporary of Nebuchadnezzar,
though he has placed the beginning of the latter’s reign 133 years too early.47 Since he dates Hippocrates as

having flourished 196 years after Nebuchadnezzar took power, his error puts the famous doctor’s dates off
by over a century as well. But if one subtracts the error, one has Hippocrates flourishing in c. 409, which is
a good approximation. The date he gives for Socrates, “about a thousand years before the Hijrah,” is only
some sixty years too late, if we take the years as solar years.

It is apparent that Abú’l-Fidá’ was confronted with a dilemma when he contemplated the biographical
tradition of Ṣá‘id and Shahrastání, which claimed that Pythagoras both lived in the time of Solomon and
taught Socrates. Even a medieval Muslim historian knew that many centuries separated the Hebrew sage
from the Athenian philosopher. Yet Abú’l-Fidá’ gives no indication that he seriously attempted to draw
conclusions from his assertion that Empedocles and Pythagoras lived in the time of David and Solomon. He
still follows Shahrastání’s arrangement, listing Thales first and so implying that he was the first philosopher.
But according to his own chronology Empedocles should have lived five centuries before Thales. All this is
to say that the Muslim chronology was on this point seriously flawed by an irreconcilable internal
contradiction.

Abú’l-Fidá’ himself, however, had no illusions about the accuracy of the dates he was suggesting for
ancient events. He rote in the preface to his history:

> Anyone who meditates upon ancient dates should know that there are very great differences among the
> historians concerning them. Ibnu’l-Athír said in discussing the birth Christ that he — peace be upon him
> — was born 560 years after Alexander’s victory according to the Zoroastrians but that according to the

> compounded by the distance in time, the changes of languages, as well as the antiquity of the books
> composed on this art. The verification of ancient dates is for these reasons impossible or extremely
> difficult.48
One may conclude, then, that whatever ancient dates the Muslim historians gave were approximations
and were not considered trustworthy even by themselves. Moreover, they ran into serious trouble when they
attempted to cross-date between calendars.

All this would seem to indicate that the Muslim writers’ statement that Pythagoras and Empedocles
were contemporaries of David and Solomon is an historical and factual error. However, such a conclusion
raises some difficulties for the Bahá'í scholar, insofar as this apparently inaccurate assertion was quoted by
Bahá'u'lláh in the Lawḥ-i Ḥikmat. Such an eventuality raises for Bahá'ís the same sorts of questions about
the possibility of historical error in revealed scripture as have been raised by modern biblical criticism in
Christianity.

One possible resolution might be that Bahá'u'lláh’s declaration that these figures were contemporaries
was not meant to be taken literally. The Arabic “fi zaman” would be taken to mean “in the age of” rather
than “at the same time as.”49 This suggestion, however, involves a number of difficulties. We now know
that Bahá'u'lláh was ultimately quoting from Shahrastání, sometimes through Abú’l-Fidá’, and Shahrastání
says that Empedocles actually met and studied with David. Second, the very structure of Bahá'u'lláh’s

\[48\] Abú’l-Fidá’, al-Mukhtaṣar fi Akhbár al-Bashar, pp. 3-4 (my translation).

\[49\] The Universal House of Justice has kindly informed the author that Shoghi Effendi, the Guardian of the Bahá'í Faith, seems to

statement seems to preclude it from being a general assertion that they lived in the same age. For He had
Empedocles live in the time of David and Pythagoras in the time of Solomon, indicating by the sequence
that contemporaneity is meant. Finally, an example of how this phrase was used by Arab biographers is
provided by al-Qifṭí, who says, “Wa kána Suqráṭu fi zamaní Afláṭún” (“And Socrates was in the time of
Plato”).50

Another possible resolution of the problem would be to reject the reliability of such sources as Diogenes
Laertius, the Bible, and Ptolemy for establishing ancient chronology.51 In order to advance beyond such a
general skepticism, however, it would be necessary to establish that the Muslims had access to a more
reliable chronological tradition about the ancient world, which has since been lost. However, I have shown
that Muslim historians like Abú’l-Fidá’ by and large agree with both the classical chronology of the
philosophers and the biblical chronology of the prophets. Yet they go on to contradict themselves, asserting
that Pythagoras was a contemporary of both Socrates and Solomon, while simultaneously holding that
Solomon lived centuries before Socrates. Since they do not offer a tenable alternative chronology, a modern
historian has no grounds for using their statement of the contemporaneity of these figures to criticize
currently accepted dating. Unless some evidence can be brought forward supporting their case, I can only
conclude that the Muslims were confused on this point and that their chronology is not trustworthy.

In addition, modern archeology h sent support to the general reliability of the Bible as an historical
document, insofar as events like Nebuchadnezzar’s accession to the throne can be more precisely fixed now
that the ancient language, documents, and calendars have been deciphered. It is true that much of our
chronology for ancient events depends on literary documents such as king-lists, the absolute reliability of
which is difficult to ascertain. But it seems highly unlikely, given the evidence now available to us, that
such important figures as David, Solomon, and Pythagoras have been misplaced by hundreds of years.

This it seems probable that Bahá'u'lláh quoted in the Tablet of Wisdom a statement that — however,
sound it may have been within the cultural confines of Islamic civilization — has proved to be factually
inaccurate by any standards of reasoning and historical documentation available to contemporary historians.

For an explanation of this anomaly, one must move from history to theology — or in H. Richard
Niebuhr’s terminology, from “external history” to “internal history.”52 Unfortunately, however, there is no
well-developed tradition of Bahá'í theology upon which one can draw for the resolution of such dilemmas.
No systematic theology of the Bahá'í Faith has been written, and no rigorous studies of such theological
works as ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s Some Answered Question have appeared. Ideally, a Bahá'í counterpart of
Christology and buddhology should be developed on the basis of Bahá'í scripture (we might suggest the
neologism ‘theophanology’).

In the absence of such a body of scholarship, one can only pose questions and state tentative hypotheses.

I have reached the conclusion that statements that are factually inaccurate can become embedded in divinely
revealed texts. In the Bahá'í Faith, as in other religions, however, there is a natural desire on the part of its
adherents to hold that statements contained in the Holy Writ are inerrant and infallible. But the problem of

\[52\] H. Richard Niebuhr, The Meaning of Revelation (New York: Macmillan, 1978), pp. 44-66.
“infallible statements” involves us in the question of the meaning of a statement. Professor George A.

Lindbeck, a Lutheran theologian, made this point in discussing the controversy in the early seventies in the
Roman Catholic Church over the infallibility of the Catholic teaching office. He points out that linguistic
philosophers such as Wittgenstein have made us aware of the dependence of statements upon their context
for their meaning. He adds:

> Also contributing to the problem of meaning is the immense growth of historical knowledge. This is the
> point of which Küng is especially aware. We have become much more conscious of historical relativity

> intellectual discipline is often very different from what it means in another; or conversely, what look
> like entirely dissimilar affirmations may function similarly, may have the same meaning in different
> settings.53

No modern thinker can fail to be intensely aware of the historically conditioned nature of all human
knowledge and thus of all human statements of that knowledge. Insofar as a divinely revealed text is
nevertheless communicated in a human language, employing human concepts in a particular human social
milieu, the statements therein are inevitably historically conditioned.

Lindbeck goes on to point out, however, that while all statements may be historically conditioned, the
propositions for which they serve as the vehicles can be immutably true.54 This, he argues, requires only the
adoption of two-valued logics in which a distinction is made between meaningful propositions and the
particular statement of these propositions. As an example, we might cite the damage wrought to the English
phrase “The sun rises” by the modern scientific revolution. While it is, technically speaking, inaccurate to
talk of the “rising” of the sun, we continue to do so meaningful. The statement is incorrect. But the
proposition expressed by it, that the sun becomes visible above the earth’s horizon, remains true.

In the Tablet of Wisdom the proposition being argued is that Jerusalem exercised an important spiritual
influence upon Athens. The statement that Pythagoras was Solomon’s contemporary was made as part of
that proposition and was meaningful in the context of Islamic scholarship. This particular statement is
erroneous from the wider point of view of world history. However, Bahá'u'lláh’s proposition that Greek
philosophy owed a debt to Hebrew prophecy is not thereby invalidated. The proposition can remain true in
spite of the error that has crept into the statement of it owing to the inevitable historicity of statements made
in human languages. One may thus argue that the central propositions contained in the Tablet of Wisdom
can be infallibly and eternally true, although particular statements that express or support those propositions
might prove inaccurate outside their original context.

In concentrating upon a tiny chronological inconsistency, I do not intend to draw attention away from
the more significant issues raised for the cultural history of mankind by the Lawḥ-i Ḥikmat. Chief among
these is Bahá'u'lláh’s assertion that Western philosophy and its offspring, modern science, derived their
metaphysical basis from prophetic monotheism. My aim, however, was to make a contribution to the still
embryonic “science” of Bahá'í scriptural exegesis, and science progresses through the examination of
anomalies.
