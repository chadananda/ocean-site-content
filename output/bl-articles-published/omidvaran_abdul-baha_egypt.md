     ‘His Eminence Mírzá ‘Abbás Effendi ... Has
Reached the Shores of Alexandria’ by Betsy

Omidvaran

Abstract
Century of Light, the review by the Universal House of Justice of the
key developments of the twentieth century, contains a short description of
‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s sojourn in Egypt. This paper starts form the information
contained there and follows its leads to investigate the contacts ‘Abdu’l-
Bahá had with a wide variety of influential people in Egypt, and the
impression he made on them.

Background
In the period between 1910 and 1913, when ‘Abdu’l-Bahá visited,
Egypt was at the centre of a revival in Arabic intellectual, political
and cultural life. It was nominally a part of the Ottoman Empire as
it had been for centuries, but its political situation was complicated
by two nineteenth-century developments. First, soon after the
French occupation of Egypt under Napoleon ended in the first
decade, practical control was taken by an Albanian officer in the
Ottoman army, Muhammad ‘Alí, whose descendants acquired the
title Khedive and ruled in one form or another for one hundred
and fifty years until Egypt became a Republic in 1953. Second, in
1882, the British invaded, mostly to protect European financial
interests and their path to India.

Muhammad ‘Alí began the process, which continued over
subsequent decades, of closer contact with Europe, initially in
order to learn new military techniques, but expanding to include
European literature, and social and political ideas. This combined
with and stimulated a revival of Islamic education and reformist
thought. By 1910, there was a well-established education system,
many newspapers and other publications, and a vibrant
intellectual and cultural atmosphere: as Century of Light describes
it, a ‘cosmopolitan and liberal atmosphere’, which allowed ‘frank
and searching discussions’ with ‘prominent figures in the
intellectual world of Sunni Islam, clerics, parliamentarians,
administrators and aristocrats.’1

Impressions of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá in Egypt
Abdu’l-Bahá was in Egypt for about one year and nine months
altogether, comprising three distinct periods. This was part of his
three-and-a-half year journey to Europe and North America. The
first time He left Haifa at the end of August 1910 and arrived in
Egypt in early September.2 He stopped in Port Said on his way to
Europe, but ill health led to His remaining for almost a year. After
a month he moved to Alexandria; then in May of 1911, he moved
to Cairo. On 11 August 1911, he left for Marseilles to spend four
months in Britain and France. The second period in Egypt was the
months from 2 December 1911 to 25 March 1912, before He left for
North America, where he spent nine months and crossed the
continent. Then he returned to Europe and spent six months
travelling again in Britain and France, then to Germany, Hungary
and Austria. The third period in Egypt was at the end of his trip,
when He spent the months from 17 June to 2 December 1913, first
in Port Said and then moving to Ramleh, a suburb of Alexandria
on 17 July. His grandson, Shoghi Effendi, and His sister, Bahiyyih
Khánum, joined Him on 1 August and He left for Haifa in
December.3

The description of His sojourn in Egypt contained in Century
of Light focuses on the first year: ’ ... the months that followed were
a period of great productivity whose full effects on the fortunes of
the Cause in the African continent especially, will be felt for many
years to come.’4 It explains that the first year provided the
opportunity for His first proclamation of the Faith and also
contributed to His success in Europe, as the many Europeans
resident in Egypt were able to meet Him and observe the warm
reception he received from Egyptians.

The following passage from an Egyptian newspaper is
partially quoted in Century of Light as part of its description of the
importance of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s visit to Egypt: ‘His Eminence Mírzá
‘Abbás Effendi, the learned and erudite Head of the Bahá’ís in
Akka and the Centre of authority throughout the world, has
reached the shores of Alexandria.’5 Like most of the material in
Century of Light related to ‘Abdu’l-Bahá in Egypt, this was taken
from Hasan Balyuzi’s biography of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, which gives
more of the quotation, as follows:

Whosoever has consorted with Him has seen in Him a man
> exceedingly well-informed, whose speech is captivating,
> Who attracts minds and souls, Who is dedicated to belief in
> the oneness of mankind ... His teaching and guidance
> revolve around the axis of relinquishing prejudices:
> religious, racial, patriotic.6

The article makes other statements which were common in
newspaper articles about the Faith in this period, for example, that
‘Abdu’l-Bahá was very knowledgeable on theology and the history
of Islam, and that the Bahá’í Faith had millions of followers all
over the world.

This was written by Shaykh ‘Alí-Yúsuf (1863-1915) in his
daily newspaper al-Mu’ayyad. Al-Mu’ayyad had been founded in
1889, the first major newspaper owned and edited by an Egyptian
Muslim. Before that, the Arabic language newspapers and
magazines had been mostly owned and edited by Syrian
Christians who had immigrated into Egypt. Shaykh ‘Alí-Yúsuf
was educated at the al-Azhar Mosque in Cairo, the major centre of
Islamic education, and his newspaper had been immensely
popular. By 1910, it had lost its first position, partly because he
remained intensely loyal to the Khedive of the time, ‘Abbás Hilmí
II, and partially because in the first decade of the twentieth century
many other popular newspapers arose in Egypt. According to
Balyuzi, Shaykh ‘Alí-Yúsuf had previously written derogatorily
about the Bahá’í Faith, but changed his mind when he met
‘Abdu’l-Bahá. In 1900, ‘Alí-Yúsuf had given a positive review to
one of the books by Mírzá Abu’l-Fadl, a Bahá’í, but in 1903 had
published news of persecutions of Bahá’ís in Yazd, accusing them
of slandering the prophets. This may have been the negative article
Balyuzi was referring to.

Century of Light also mentions the important role of Shaykh
Muhammad ‘Abduh (1849-1905), who had met ‘Abdu’l-Bahá,
possibly on several occasions, in Beirut in the 1880s. There have
been several articles written about this relationship. Muhammad
‘Abduh was trained at al-Azhar, where he was closely associated
with the well-known and influential Iranian activist Jamál al-Dín
al-Afghání (1839-1897), who taught at al-Azhar from 1871 and was
exiled from Egypt in 1879. Under al-Afghání’s influence, ‘Abduh

participated in the ‘Urábí revolt which was suppressed by the
British invasion in 1882. ‘Abduh was then exiled to Beirut in
January 1883. After a year in Beirut, he went to Paris, with al-
Afghání, where, for six months in 1884, they published the
influential journal al-’Urwa al-Wuthqá.

Al-Afghání is a ubiquitous figure in discussions of the
Middle East during this period. In fact, Bahá’u’lláh refers to him in
the Lawh-i-Dunyá (Tablet of the World), revealed in 1891,
translated into English and published in the Tablets of Bahá’u’lláh,
as follows:

> One wondereth why those who have been the symbols of
> highest glory should now stoop to boundless shame. What is
> become of their high resolve? Whither is gone the sense of
> dignity and honour? ... The aforesaid person [Jamál al-Dín]
> hath written such things concerning this people in the
> Egyptian press and in the Beirut Encyclopedia that the well-
> informed and the learned were astonished. He proceeded
> then to Paris where he published a newspaper entitled
> ‘Urvatu’l-Vuthqá [The Sure Handle] and sent copies thereof to
> all parts of the world. He also sent a copy to the Prison of
> ‘Akka, and by so doing he meant to show affection and to
> make amends for his past actions. In short this Wronged One
> hath observed silence in regard to him7

Shoghi Effendi also describes him in God Passes By, his review of
the first hundred years of the Bahá’í Faith, as ‘The scheming
Jamálu’d-Dín-i-Afghání, whose relentless hostility and powerful
influence had been so gravely detrimental to the progress of the
Faith in Near Eastern countries ... ’8

‘Abduh then spent the years 1885 to 1888 in Beirut, after
which he returned to Egypt. He later became a prominent reformer
in Egypt, and was Grand Muftí, the highest Islamic judicial post,
from 1899 up to his death in 1905. He was no longer alive when
‘Abdu’l-Bahá visited Egypt, but they had kept up a
correspondence and, as Century of Light points out, his admiration
for ‘Abdu’l-Bahá ‘paved the way’ to a degree for ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s
reception there.

‘Abdu’l-Bahá had been invited to Beirut by Midhat Pasha
(1822-1884), an Ottoman constitutional reformer, who, from
November 1878 to August 1880, was governor of Syria. Hasan
Balyuzi, in his book on ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, published in 1971, says the
visit was in 1878 and quotes from a letter written by Bahá’u’lláh
for the occasion.9 It begins: ‘Praise be to Him Who hath honoured
the Land of Bá [Beirut] through the Presence of Him round whom
all names revolve.’10 However, in his book on Bahá’u’lláh,
published in 1980, Balyuzi says the journey was in June 1880,
quoting from the same Tablet, which he dates 9 June 1880, and
mentions that Midhat Pasha visited Haifa in May 1880.11 Balyuzi
also says that ‘Abdu’l-Bahá met ‘Abduh during a visit to Beirut.12
However, in 1880 ‘Abduh was living in Egypt, and there is no
evidence that he travelled to Beirut before 1883, so it is more likely
that he met ‘Abdu’l-Bahá at a later date.

A great deal of the evidence for the contact between ‘Abdu’l-
Bahá and Muhammad ‘Abduh comes from the three-volume
biography of ‘Abduh written by his disciple Rashíd Ridá (1865-
1935), who had been his student in Beirut as a young man. Ridá
was a Syrian who moved to Cairo in 1897 to study with ‘Abduh,
and in 1898 he started the journal al-Manár, in which he published
several articles against the Bahá’í Faith over the years. In World
Order magazine in 1981, Juan Cole published a report of a
conversation in 1897 between ‘Abduh and Ridá about ‘Abduh’s
attitude to ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, which is reported in Ridá’s biography of
‘Abduh. In this conversation Ridá maintains that ‘Abduh had been
favourable toward the Bahá’ís and ‘Abdu’l-Bahá but that he had
not understood what the Bahá’í Faith really was. He maintains that
‘Abduh’s positive opinion changed when he found out. According
to Cole, Ridá says that when ‘Abduh was in Beirut, ‘‘Abdu’l-Bahá
more than once came to Beirut from Haifa and would make a point
of attending some of Muhammad ‘Abduh’s study sessions.’13

Ridá’s biography of ‘Abduh shows that his time in Beirut
was narrated by three sources, Ridá himself, Sayyid ‘Abd al-Básit
and Shakíb Arslán, two other students of ‘Abduh. The three
accounts are similar, describing lectures at the Sultaníya School,
dialogues with religious leaders, his secret society to reconcile the
three major monotheistic religions (Judaism, Christianity and

Islam) and the constant stream of visitors. Arslán particularly
includes descriptions of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s visits.

> None of the notables or his acquaintances journeyed to
> Beirut without coming to greet him [‘Abduh]. He honored
> and exalted each one and, even if he conflicted with him in
> belief, he did not cease to respect him. Foremost among those
> he honored was ‘Abbás Effendi al-Bahá, leader of the Bábís,
> even though the Bábí way is different from what the Shaykh
> believes and is the creed that al-Sayyid Jamál ad-Dín refuted
> so strongly. But he revered ‘Abbás Effendi’s knowledge,
> refinement, distinction, and high moral standards and
> ‘Abbás Effendi similarly honored ‘Abduh.14

The reporter quoted here, Shakíb Arslán (1869-1946), was a
member of a Druze family in Lebanon, and continued to be a close
associate of Ridá. He was later drawn into Arab nationalism and
activism for the Arabic language.15 He was a deputy in the
Ottoman Parliament 1913-18, then lived for twenty-five years in
Europe, mostly Switzerland, returning to Beirut just before his
death in 1946. In Switzerland, he published La Nation Arabe, an
influential periodical, in French. His influence declined in later
years, as he maintained a pan-Islamist tendency after other
nationalists had abandoned it.16 He spent a period in Egypt
sometime during the last decade of the nineteenth or the first
decade of the twentieth century.17

Just before he moved to Cairo, Ridá had read an article on
the Bahá’í Faith written by Mírzá Abu’l-Fadl and published in 1896
in al-Muqtataf, a scientific and literary monthly published by
Ya’qúb Sarrúf and Fáris Nimr, two Syrian immigrants. It was
founded in Beirut in 1876 and moved to Cairo in 1884 and was a
leading Arabic publication up to its closure in 1951.18 Ridá and
some of his companions in Beirut wrote a letter of protest to Abu’l-
Fadl and received a reply.19 Ridá met Abu’l-Fadl after he arrived in
Cairo in 1897, and had several discussions with him.

Mírzá Abu’l-Fadl had been sent by ‘Abdu’l-Bahá to Cairo
sometime in 1894 or 1895. He began to teach at al-Azhar, was
known as a Shí’i scholar and attracted a group of students. After
about two years he was revealed to be a Bahá’í, which he did not

deny. Following this, he was free to write articles and books about
the Faith. He published the above-mentioned article in al-Muqtataf,
and followed this with two books. He published al-Fará’id
(‘Precious Gems’) in 1898 in Cairo, whereupon some ‘ulamá issued
a declaration of takfír (unbelief) against him. His next book, al-
Durar al-bahíya,20 published in 1900, attracted favourable notices
from Mustafá Kámil (1874-1908), a popular nationalist leader, in
his newspaper al-Liwa, and from Shaykh ‘Alí-Yúsuf, as previously
mentioned, but was opposed by Ridá.21 Abu’l-Fadl lived in Cairo
until 1900, when he was sent to North America for four years until
1904, when he returned to Egypt and remained until he passed
away in Cairo on 21 January 1914.

The publishers of al-Muqtataf founded the daily newspaper
al-Muqattam in 1889, encouraged by the British, who provided
financial support. Nimr edited it, while Sarrúf ran al-Muqtataf. It
offered high quality journalism, supporting the occupation and
opposing the Sultan. Like its sister publication, it was secularist in
outlook.22 Balyuzi mentions that al-Muqattam, in its issue dated 28
November 1910, published a positive article about ‘Abdu’l-Bahá.23

Another newspaper mentioned by Balyuzi as having
published a positive report of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá was al-Ahrám, which
was founded in Alexandria in 1875 by two Greek Catholic brothers
from Beirut, Salím and Bishára Taqla. It was a weekly newspaper
until 1881, when it became daily. It included pure news reportage,
plus commercial, scientific and literary items, but avoided
controversy and ideology. After the British occupation in 1882, it
became more partisan and gained an image as a French
mouthpiece.

Balyuzi mentions another newspaper by the name of Wádí al-
Níl. A newspaper by this name was published from 1867 to 1874. It
may have been started again or this may have been a new
newspaper or there may be another explanation for Balyuzi’s
saying that it published an article during ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s visit.
Wádí al-Níl is a logical name for a newspaper in Egypt, as it means
‘valley of the Nile.’

Balyuzi discusses Jurjí (George) Zaydán (1861-1914): ‘The
eminent writer and celebrated editor of the magazine al-Hilál was
another leading figure in the public life of Egypt who visited
‘Abdu’l-Bahá.’24 Zaydán founded al-Hilál in 1892, having moved to

Cairo from Beirut in 1886. It was a direct competitor of al-Muqtataf
and is still in existence. He also held a regular salon-type gathering
in his home, described as follows by Thomas Philipp: ‘Once a
week, on Tuesdays a soirée was given at the Zaidan’s, attended by
people from the cultural elite of Cairene society: journalists,
writers, historians and sometimes even a teacher from al-Azhar.
European orientalists visiting Cairo would join.’25 Philipp says that
Zaydan’s letters to his son from 1908 to 1912 give many of the
names of those attending. This would be in the period of ‘Abdu’l-
Bahá’s visit, so he may well have attended this gathering, but I do
not have access to his letters to his son and have no actual
evidence that he did so.

Juan Cole mentions another contact of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá with the
press in Egypt long before he travelled there. It is a letter that
‘Abdu’l-Bahá wrote to al-Afghání in response to an article the
latter wrote in the newspaper Misr (‘Egypt’).26 The letter is signed
‘al-dá’í al-Bábí al-masjún fí Akká, ‘Abbás’ (‘the Bábí missionary
imprisoned in Akka, ‘Abbás’), which Cole identifies as ‘Abdu’l-
Bahá. It is not dated, but Misr was published only from 1877 to
1879\. The letter praises al-Afghání’s article and encloses a treatise
along similar lines by Midhat Pasha, but Cole does not describe the
subject of the article except to say that Misr was part of the
‘constitutionalist press.’ Misr was published weekly in Cairo and
Alexandria by Adíb Ishaq (1856-84), a Greek Catholic Syrian who
arrived in Egypt in 1876 and was deported in 1879. He was a
follower of al-Afghání.27

Salím Qub’ayn, in his book, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá wa al-Bahá’íya,
quotes two articles published in September and October 1913 by
the Egyptian ‘Abd al-Rahmán al-Barqúqí (1876-1944) in his
monthly journal al-Bayán, entitled ‘‘Abdu’l-Bahá afandi, za’im al-
Bahá’íyin’ (‘‘Abdu’l-Bahá Effendi, Leader of the Bahá’ís’):

> Among us now and before our eyes and ears is one of the
> distinguished men of the twentieth century, even one of the
> distinguished men of the whole world. Suffice it to say that
> he is the leader of a large religious faith with million of
> members, spread throughout Egypt, Iran, India, Europe and
> America, and most of the places of the inhabited world
> venerate him as they venerate prophets and messengers. The

newspapers, magazines and books in Europe and America
> devoted to him pages which praise him, spread his call,
> glorify his heroism. That one is our friend ‘Abbás Afandí
> entitled ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, leader of the Bahá’ís and the
> champion of religious reform in this age, nay chief of the
> reformers.28

In this article, al-Barqúqí also describes at length his contact
with Mírzá Abu’l-Fadl, whom he met for the first time about 1904,
presumably upon the latter’s return from America. He expresses
great admiration for him and says that he and his companions
eagerly attended audiences with him. Al-Barqúqí was educated at
al-Azhar where he studied with Shaykh Muhammad ‘Abduh and
other reformers. Al-Ziriklí says that his style of expression was
pure and beautiful, that he lost money on this journal, which was
founded in 1910, and that many of the outstanding literary men of
Egypt were contributors.29 Saláma Músá is less complimentary,
saying that the aim of al-Bayán was to revive ‘the old-fashioned
dead language’ and that it was suspended after a short period of
publication.30 Interestingly, in his article, al-Barqúqí says that, if he
were a believer in transmigration of souls, he would believe that
Mírzá Abu’l-Fadl was the reappearance of Jamál al-Dín al-Afghání,
which he intends as a compliment to Abu’l-Fadl.31

Interestingly, in his article about ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, Shaykh ‘Alí
Yúsuf compared him to al-Afghání:

... his conversation and opinions reminded us of the late
> Jamál al-Dín al-Afghání and in his grasp of subjects about
> which he spoke and his attractiveness to those with whom he
> conversed. However, his knowledge was even greater and he
> calmed those with whom he spoke and listened to them
> more than Sayyid Jamál al-Dín did.32

In addition to meeting editors of newspapers, many of whom
published articles, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá met a number of other prominent
people. One of these was Khedive ‘Abbás Hilmí II, the great-
grandson of Muhammad ‘Alí. Balyuzi reports that ‘Abbás Hilmí
met Him for the third time on 17 August 1913, but he does not
mention the first two times they met, whether they ever met again

or any more details of this meeting.33 ‘Abbás Hilmí II took office in
1892 at the age of seventeen, following the death of his father,
Khedive Tawfíq. He was educated at the Theresianum in Vienna,
where he had close contact with the Habsburg court, under the
Emperor Franz Joseph, who ruled in style for sixty-eight years
from 1848 to 1916 and was among the rulers addressed by
Bahá’u’lláh.

‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s meetings with the Khedive were organized
by ‘Uthmán Murtadá Pasha (1865-1935), the Khedive’s head
chamberlain. He was from a prominent Albanian family in Egypt
and graduated from the School of Law. He served in the public
prosecutor’s office and other legal and political positions, until
‘Abbás Hilmí II appointed him head chamberlain. At the
beginning of World War I, when the Ottomans joined the Axis
powers and ‘Abbás Hilmí II was deposed, ‘Uthmán Murtadá was
arrested by the British and exiled to Malta. He wrote articles in
newspapers and was active in the nationalist movement and in the
freemasons.34 According to Balyuzi, he was ‘devoted to ‘Abdu’l-
Bahá, and was the intermediary arranging meetings between Him
and ‘Abbás Hilmí Pasha.’ ‘Abdu’l-Bahá addressed him a Tablet in
October 1919.35

Star of the West, a Bahá’í-published magazine, of January
1930 reported an interview by American journalist and traveller
Martha Root with Prince Muhammad ‘Alí (1875-1955), the younger
brother of ‘Abbás Hilmí II, who describes his meeting with
‘Abdu’l-Bahá in New York on 22 July, 1912. The Prince said
‘Abdu’l-Bahá was

> a great friend of my brother ‘Abbás Hilmí II, the late Khedive
> ... I met your beloved Teacher first early in 1912 on my way
> to Paris ... ’Abbás Bábá has proved to Europeans and the
> entire West that great generals of the Spirit are still born in
> the East! ... I was very sad when I heard of His passing, for I
> considered Him the most important man in our century.36

The Prince called on ‘Abdu’l-Bahá in September 1913 in
Alexandria.

According to Balyuzi, Shaykh Muhammad Bakhít (1854-
1935) was another member of the clergy who called on ‘Abdu’l-

Bahá and received a call in return during ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s sojourn in
Cairo in 1911. Balyuzi says he was Muftí of Egypt, but according to
al-Ziriklí, Muhammad Bakhít was Muftí of Egypt from 1914 to
1921\. Bakhít was educated at al-Azhar, then taught there and in
about 1878 transferred to shari’a law. He was associated with
Jamál al-Dín al-Afghání and was one of the strongest supporters of
Muhammad ‘Abduh’s campaign of reform.37

‘Abdu’l-Bahá also had contact with British officials. He had
met Sir Ronald Storrs when the latter passed through Palestine in
1909 on his way to Egypt to take up the post of Oriental Secretary
to Sir Eldon Gorst (1861-1911), the British agent and consul-
general. Storrs had first gone to Egypt in 1904 as a young British
official under Lord Cromer. In The Chosen Highway, Lady
Blomfield quotes a letter from Storrs saying this, and also that
when ‘Abdu’l-Bahá visited Egypt, he catered for Him and
presented Him to Lord Herbert Kitchener (1850-1916), ‘who was
deeply impressed by his personality, as who could fail to be?’ Lord
Kitchener served as head of the British army in Egypt from 1892 to
1902, and was responsible for the British conquest of the Sudan.
Then he went to India from 1902 to 1909, but returned as successor
to Gorst in 1911, remaining until 1914. Storrs met ‘Abdu’l-Bahá
again after Lord Edmund Allenby (1861-1936) took Syria during
the First World War and appointed Storrs governor. Storrs says
‘Abdu’l-Bahá visited him in Jerusalem and that he always called
on Him when he visited Haifa.38

An integral part of the vibrant intellectual and cultural
atmosphere in Cairo were the many regular salons and gatherings.
Jurjí Zaydán’s salon was mentioned earlier. It was in its heyday
during ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s visit and may very well have been attended
by Him. There were other salons as well, that ‘Abdu’l-Bahá may
have attended, but I have no actual evidence that he did. Princess
Názlí Fádil’s salon was well-known and brought together
Egyptians with English people, including many of the people
known to have contact with ‘Abdu’l-Bahá. Storrs describes it in his
memoir, Orientations. Mayy Zíyáda (1886-1941) was a poet who
had arrived from Beirut in 1911 and held a vibrant salon in Cairo
until the late 1920s. Also, the offices of the al-Jarída newspaper
were a regular meeting-ground from 1907-1914 of a wide variety
of people. Al-Jarída published an article about the Faith in July

1910, translated from English, just before ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s arrival
and also Mrs. Jean Stannard, an English Bahá’í who knew Arabic,
gave a lecture in its offices on the subject of psychology.39

Conclusion
This paper has presented an overview of currently available
information on ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s visit to Egypt of almost two years,
concentrating on His contacts with public figures outside the
Bahá’í community, while also placing it in some kind of
perspective in relation to the times. I have expanded on the short
description given in Century of Light, to show the wide-ranging
and positive contact that ‘Abdu’l-Bahá had with leaders of thought
in Egypt during His visit, and to reveal additional paths to further
research this topic.

As we have seen, He met a wide range of people, of diverse
backgrounds, Christian and Muslim, Syrian émigrés, reforming
and more traditional, writers and publishers in the Egyptian press,
the de facto and de jure rulers and prominent Europeans. From this
basis of evidence, one can speculate that He may have met a much
wider range of people and may have attended some of the vibrant
salons and social gatherings of the time in both Cairo and
Alexandria.

In the course of exploring these contacts, I have touched on
some of His interaction with these people and how He influenced
them. Those who met Him express their admiration for His
personality and His breadth of knowledge. They were also
impressed with the wide spread of the Bahá’í Faith and had a
rather exaggerated impression of the number of Bahá’ís in the
world at that time. There was some confusion over whether it was
a new religion or a religious movement, but it was clear that it had
the goal of bringing together all religions. More research remains
to be done on this short but fascinating period of ’Abdu’l-Bahá’s
ministry. It is hoped that this paper will provide historians of the
Faith with the encouragement and the incentive to do so.
