Human Knowledge
and the Advancement of Society

Music is the one incorporeal entrance into the higher world of knowledge which compre-
hends mankind but which mankind cannot comprehend.
——Ludwig van Beethoven

Abstract
Human knowledge is the means toward realizing a global civilization as envis-
aged by Bahá’u’lláh. This paper examines the concept of knowledge and its treat-
ment in the Bahá’í texts followed by an exploration of certain themes specified
in the current Five Year Plan as brought forward and promulgated by the
Universal House of Justice. These themes focus the worldwide Bahá’í communi-
ty’s consultation, reflection, and its efforts towards actions which exercise
knowledge in constructing a better world. The paper also explores the individ-
ual’s adoption of an unassuming learning mode in response to applying acquired
spiritual and secular knowledge to the complex and enduring process of civiliza-
tion building.

Résumé
La connaissance humaine est le moyen par lequel une cilivisation mondiale, telle
qu’envisagée par Bahá’u’lláh, pourra être réalisée. L’auteur examine le concept de la
connaissance et ce qu’en disent les textes bahá’ís, puis il explore certains thèmes pré-
cisés dans le plan de cinq ans actuel établi et promulgué par la Maison Universelle
de Justice. C’est sur ces thèmes que se concentrent la consultation, la réflexion et les
efforts de la communauté mondiale baha’ie en vue d’actions qui constituent une
application de la connaissance pour établir un monde meilleur. L’auteur examine
également l’adoption par l’individu d’un mode d’apprentissage humble qui découle
de l’application des connaissances spirituelles et séculières à la démarche continue et
complexe visant l’établissement d’une civilisation nouvelle.

Resumen
El conocimiento humano es el medio para hacer realidad una civilización global
así como es previsto por Bahá’u’lláh. Este ensayo examina el concepto del
conocimiento y su trato en los textos Bahá’ís seguido por una exporación de cier-
tos temas especificados en el actual Plan de Cinco Años traído y promulgado por
la Casa Universal de Justicia. Estos temas enfocan la consulta, reflexión de la
comunidad mundial Bahá’í, y sus esfuerzos de acciones que utilizan el conocimien-
to para construir un mundo mejor. Este ensayo explora además la adopción del
individuo de un modo de aprendizaje modesto en respuesta a aplicar el
conocimiento espiritual y secular adquirido al complejo y duradero proceso de la
construcción de una civilización.

In the mid-nineteenth century, with the advent of the Báb’s
Dispensation—which paved the way for the anticipated dawn of the
Dispensation of Bahá’u’lláh—a vast profusion of knowledge beyond meas-
ure was disclosed to humankind. The knowledge imparted by Bahá’u’lláh
challenges and reorients existing perceptions of the material and spiritu-
al aspects of life and demands from individuals and social institutions
responses that are appropriate to humankind’s age of maturity.

An outcome of the vision this knowledge has imparted to humanity is
the inclusion of principles such as the organic unity of humankind in what
Shoghi Effendi characterizes as the “highest stage in the stupendous evo-
lution of man’s collective life on this planet” (World Order 163). The Bahá’í
Faith encourages an unfettered search for truth; it explains that the role
of religion is to expound and articulate “the values unfolding progressive-
ly through Divine revelation”; it views science as the “instrumentality
through which the human mind explores and is able to exert its influence
ever more precisely over the phenomenal world,” and asserts that religion
“defines goals that serve the evolutionary process,” that “science assists in
their attainment,” and that religion and science jointly constitute the dual
aspects of the ever-present goal of humankind—a “knowledge system
impelling the advance of civilization” (One Common Faith 33).

Other knowledge that has been imparted to humankind by the birth of
the Bahá’í Faith is the condemnation of all forms of superstition and prej-

Human Knowledge and the Advancement of Society                 71

udice. In 1912, in a public talk given during His travels across the United
States, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá stated the following about the blight and burden per-
petuated by all forms of prejudice: “Shall we remain steeped in our fanati-
cisms and cling to our prejudices? Is it fitting that we should still be
bound and restricted by ancient fables and superstitions of the past…?”
(Promulgation 369). Another example of the knowledge enunciated in this
Revelation is the equality of women and men, a principle which was not a
“Western construct but a universal spiritual truth—a statement about
human nature—that was promulgated by Bahá’u’lláh nearly 150 years ago
in His native Iran” (Letter to the Believers), a goal now considered obvi-
ous worldwide even though it is far from being realized.

The Bahá’í Faith was introduced to humanity as a global religion, as a
religion which from its inception addressed the peoples of the West as
well as the East and made clear that its teachings are intended for the
entire world. For over 165 years this sea of knowledge full of new ideas—
including a deep and ever-present vision of the spiritual dimension of life,
of the moral and spiritual principles and laws pertaining to the operation
of our daily life and the purpose underlying our creation—has been placed
in the hands of humanity.

This knowledge was proclaimed by the Báb and Bahá’u’lláh to the kings
and rulers of the world, and it has since been carried to virtually every
corner of the world by its adherents as well as by its well-wishers. In fact,
from the outset of the Bahá’í Revelation, the dispersion of the knowledge
contained in the teachings of Bahá’u’lláh has been openly and enthusiasti-
cally shared with the generality of humankind, wherever circumstances
permit, because this limitless knowledge belongs to all the peoples of the
world.

Acquiring knowledge and, more importantly, appreciating its applica-
tion through both individual and collective effort and actions, are at the
very heart of Bahá’u’lláh’s Revelation. In the Bahá’í texts, the attainment
of knowledge is linked to social progress and to the spiritual and materi-
al transformation of individuals and society.

Therefore, the attitude that one adopts toward knowledge is fundamen-
tal to the formation of social reality. How knowledge is understood and

72            The Journal of Bahá’í Studies 22. 1/4. 2012

how its meaning is applied and practiced are critical in shaping the kind
of society and world civilization that the teachings of Bahá’u’lláh envision.
At the center of this process of knowledge-seeking is the human mind and
consciousness which is endowed with the capacity to carve and shape this
insight into reality in the form of a new global civilization.

Among contemporary scholars there is growing concern about the pur-
suit of knowledge solely for the sake of a purely economic or political
framework, for within this context the broader and deeper culturally edi-
fying component of knowledge is lost—a component that includes such
vital elements as the civilizing, enriching, enlightening, and transforming
of culture.

A concomitant disassociation between the pursuit of knowledge and
civic responsibility permeates current discourse. What should an educat-
ed person offer in service to his or her community? One scholar raises the
question, “Is the man [or woman] of knowledge just a man [or woman]
pursuing knowledge, maybe divine, maybe scientific, for its own sake? Or
is he [or she] also connected with the life of the community?” (Eisenstadt
19).

Finally, what is the role of education in a rapidly changing globalizing
world where different societies, cultures, or civilizations encounter one
another in very close quarters and often under conditions that do not
always produce tolerance and understanding? There is growing tension in
society among the concepts of universalism (a society open to everyone),
pluralism (a society composed of several autonomous but interdependent
groups that either share power or continuously compete for power), and
more stringent forms (totalitarian and non-tolerant). Thus, we might use-
fully ponder the role of knowledge and education in relation to preparing
people to live effectively, successfully in a constantly changing world. Can
the contestations and conflicts that abound in the world gradually fade
away through sound methods of knowledge generation and application?

Therefore, let us examine human knowledge as the means toward the
realization of a world civilization as envisaged by Bahá’u’lláh starting with
a brief overview of the concept of knowledge and its treatment in the
Bahá’í texts, followed by a searching reflection of certain themes in the

Human Knowledge and the Advancement of Society                 73

current Divine Plan as brought forward and promulgated by the
Universal House of Justice. In particular, let us discuss three themes from
two of the recent letters of the Universal House of Justice: the Ridván
2010 letter and the 28 December 2010 letter addressed “To the
Conference of the Continental Boards of Counsellors.” These themes,
including knowledge, a culture of learning, and openness to the wider
society, focus the worldwide Bahá’í community’s consultation and efforts
on actions relevant to the exercise of knowledge in the construction of a
global civilization. In examining the contents of these letters, we can dis-
cern the establishment of the importance of a humble response by the
individual—a learning mode—in applying the acquired spiritual and sec-
ular knowledge to the complex and enduring process of civilization-build-
ing

An important outcome of acquiring knowledge, learning, and under-
standing relates to the influence of this process on the refinement of the
human capacity to grasp the essence of social problems in an effort to
uncover their potential solutions through actions. A cursory examination
of the concept of knowledge and its treatment in the Bahá’í texts reveals
its singular function in the social order described by Bahá’u’lláh as “a ver-
itable treasure for man, and a source of glory, of bounty, of joy, of exalta-
tion” (Epistle 27) for humankind. What emerges from a brief examination
of some selected passages from Bahá’u’lláh and ‘Abdu’l-Bahá is the fact
that true and authentic knowledge is far more than accumulation of infor-
mation and that the concept of manipulating knowledge to attain status or
power, or for personal gain, is incompatible with it.

SELECTED PASSAGES FROM BAHÁ’U’LLÁH’S WRITINGS

> Knowledge is as wings to man’s life, and a ladder for his ascent. Its
> acquisition is incumbent upon everyone. (Epistle 26)

In truth, knowledge is a veritable treasure for man, and a source of
> glory, of bounty, of joy, of exaltation, of cheer and gladness unto him.

Happy the man that cleaveth unto it. (Epistle 27)
74           The Journal of Bahá’í Studies 22. 1/4. 2012

> Forget your own selves, and turn your eyes towards your neighbour.
> Bend your energies to whatever may foster the education of men.

(Gleanings 9)

> Bend your minds and wills to the education of the peoples and kin-
> dreds of the earth, that haply the dissensions that divide it may,
> through the power of the Most Great Name, be blotted out from its
> face, and all mankind become the upholders of one Order, and the
> inhabitants of one City. (Gleanings 333–34)

SELECTED PASSAGES FROM ‘ABDU’L-BAHÁ’S WRITINGS

To promote knowledge is… an inescapable duty imposed on every
one. (Selections 126).

[H]uman knowledge is of two kinds. One is the knowledge of
> things perceptible to the senses—that is to say, things which the eye,
> or ear, or smell, or taste, or touch can perceive, which are called objec-
> tive or sensible.… The other kind of human knowledge is intellectu-
> al—that is to say, it is a reality of the intellect; it has no outward form
> and no place and is not perceptible to the senses. For example, the
> power of intellect is not sensible; none of the inner qualities of man is
> a sensible thing; on the contrary, they are intellectual realities. So love
> is a mental reality and not sensible; for this reality the ear does not
> hear, the eye does not see, the smell does not perceive, the taste does
> not discern, the touch does not feel. (Some Answered Questions 83)

> There are certain pillars which have been established as the unshake-
> able supports of the Faith of God. The mightiest of these is learn-
> ing and the use of the mind, the expansion of consciousness, and
> insight into the realities of the universe and the hidden mysteries of
Almighty God. (Selections 126)

Human Knowledge and the Advancement of Society                 75

Ye must strive with heart and soul that ye may become renowned in
character and knowledge. (Selections 117)

THE BAHÁ’Í CONCEPT OF KNOWLEDGE
AND THEAPPROACH TO RELIGIOUS TRUTHS

The knowledge, spiritual and material, that Bahá’u’lláh has imparted to
humankind is intended to be applied in every aspect of social existence. In
this process both the individual and society are to be transformed through
the revitalizing influence of the teachings and principles revealed by
Bahá’u’lláh.

In 1991, the following elucidation was given in a letter written on behalf
of the Universal House of Justice:

Bahá’ís believe that the Teachings and Order of Bahá’u’lláh are the
> solution to the current problems of mankind, they abstain complete-
> ly from ever attempting to put them into effect through political
> action. Only if people voluntarily accept them and submit themselves
> freely to this Order will it be implemented in the world. Bahá’ís
> should never attempt to impose their belief on anyone. Bahá’u’lláh has
> given certain teachings which Bahá’ís believe to be true; they offer
> these teachings to the rest of mankind.” (Messages 203–5)

In this context, Bahá’u’lláh teaches that the truths found in religion are
revealed by God to humanity through His Manifestations or Prophets.
The truths of religion may thus be discovered by human beings, but their
ultimate source is God, Whose essential reality is veiled and hidden from
human understanding. Bahá’u’lláh has explained this phenomenon, assert-
ing that “there can be no direct” interaction “to bind God with His cre-
ation” (Gleanings 60). ‘Abdu’l-Bahá explains that “Religion…is the neces-
sary connection which emanates from the reality of things; and as the
supreme Manifestations of God are aware of the mysteries of beings,
therefore, They understand this essential connection, and by this knowl-

76            The Journal of Bahá’í Studies 22. 1/4. 2012

edge establish the Law of God” (Some Answered Questions 159).

The human mind draws knowledge from religious truths, from the spir-
itual teachings revealed by the Manifestations of God. But here the notion
of human capacity plays an important role in relation to the teachings of
the Manifestation of God. Bahá’u’lláh has written, “The Revelation of
which I am the bearer is adapted to humanity’s spiritual receptiveness and
capacity… Whatever I manifest is nothing more or less than the measure
of Divine glory which God has bidden me reveal” (World Order 60).

The Prophets of God provide this measure of religious truths and spir-
itual teachings according to humanity’s capacity and spiritual openness to
grasp such truths and teachings. Thus, human limitation is the determin-
ing factor as to the degree to which truths and spiritual teachings are
revealed by God. It is heartening and reassuring “to know”—in the veiled
currents and problematic anxieties of the times in which we live— that the
knowledge which Bahá’u’lláh has imparted to humanity for this age is the
framework for the construction of a global civilization.

The challenge that scholars and all members of the Bahá’í community
face is to find creative ways to introduce Bahá’í perspectives about major
issues into public discourse. In doing so, the importance of imparting a
greater awareness about the essentially spiritual nature of human beings
is paramount. This discourse should be purposeful and focused on the
long-term goal envisaged by Bahá’u’lláh of achieving a world civilization
built on “a dynamic coherence between the material and spiritual require-
ments of life” as enunciated in the Bahá’í teachings (Letter to the Bahá’ís).

Yet, in terms of attitudes toward knowledge, it is helpful to adopt an
unassuming posture as one studies the Bahá’í teachings and explores what
a global civilization might look like. We have no precedence for such a civ-
ilization. Indeed, the whole development of human knowledge and under-
standing has led us here, to humanity’s greatest undertaking as it strives to
attain maturity. This effort makes the whole enterprise a highly complex
work in progress, and at the same time it propels humankind to new and
exciting frontiers.

The unique nature and long-range vision of this undertaking is explicat-
ed in a letter dated 13 May 1996 written on behalf of the Universal House
of Justice:

Human Knowledge and the Advancement of Society                    77

> Essentially, the Bahá’í community is “pioneering” a new approach to
> the organization of society and the individual person’s relationship to
> it, one that is based on a spiritual conception of reality. This effort fol-
> lows two parallel tracks. On the one hand, we do all we can as Bahá’ís
> to acquaint those around us, including the organizations of society,
> with the principles and concepts revealed by Bahá’u’lláh, in the hope
> that this guidance may be put to practical use in the life of humanity.
> On the other, we are slowly building a global community which
> demonstrates, beyond argument, that humanity, in all its diversity,
> can learn to live and work as a single people in a global homeland.…

We are, as you say, only a minority. But this has always been the
> case at any great turning-point in history. It is the Revelation of God
> that makes this minority a creative force in history and that brings to
> each of its active members the deepest sense of fulfilment that human
> life affords. (Messages 536)

We now come to the next section of this paper, which examines a few of
the themes as brought forth in the recent letters from the Universal
House of Justice about the current Divine Plan in which the worldwide
Bahá’í community is engaged and whose aim, over the centuries, is the
development of a world civilization.

INSIGHTS DERIVED FROM LETTERS
OF THE UNIVERSAL HOUSE OF JUSTICE

When speaking about constructing a world civilization, the Universal
House of Justice has portrayed in detail the current Divine Plan in which
the worldwide Bahá’í community is engaged. In these documents, the
House of Justice makes it clear that such an undertaking requires a level
of capacity-building greater than any endeavor humanity has ever attained
before. In order to reach such heights of individual and collective capaci-

78            The Journal of Bahá’í Studies 22. 1/4. 2012

ty-building, humankind must achieve a colossal expansion of knowledge.
It is this large development of human capacity that calls to mind Shoghi
Effendi’s use of the phrase “entry by troops,” which, to a certain extent, is
a seminal goal of the current plan engaging the Bahá’í world. This Plan
thus calls for universal participation—everyone has a part to play.

The Universal House of Justice explains, “Access to knowledge is the
right of every human being, and participation in its generation, application
and diffusion a responsibility that all must shoulder in the great enterprise
of building a prosperous world civilization—each individual according to
his or her talents and abilities” (Letter to the Bahá’ís). The approach is one
of drawing insight and inspiration from the knowledge gleaned and the
application of the laws and teachings of the Bahá’í Faith in active service
to the betterment of society. Engaging in this process over time brings
about an ever-growing and deeper-acquired understanding of the revealed
works of Bahá’u’lláh that explicate His vision and outline some of the
basic features of His New World Order. From the acquisition of knowl-
edge, our capacity-building is enhanced, understanding of more complex
meaning is unraveled, and human consciousness is expanded, all of which
lead to the advancement of social conditions.

Therefore, much more learning is required. Solid secular and religious
education is needed and must be employed in an endeavor to uplift the
human condition. In such a context, we draw on each other’s diverse
capacities in a spirit of cooperation and unity. Shoghi Effendi repeatedly
stated that the Bahá’ís should be “well equipped” (Compilation of
Compilations, Vol. I, 220), and that they should have their “intellectual as
well as spiritual side equally developed” (Compilation of Compilations, Vol.
II, 418).

Shoghi Effendi also emphasized the need for the acquisition of all kinds
of knowledge, saying: “If the Bahá’ís want to be really effective in teach-
ing the Cause they need to be much better informed and able to discuss
intelligently, intellectually, the present condition of the world and its
problems. We need Bahá’í scholars, not only people far, far more deeply
aware of what our teachings really are, but also well-read and well-educat-
ed people, capable of correlating our teachings to the current thoughts of

the leaders of society” (Compilation of Compilations, Vol. I, 230).

There is another dimension to this enterprise which involves the impor-
tance of striking a balance between spiritual and secular education and
knowledge in the development of a global civilization. Shoghi Effendi
makes this concept of balance very clear in his statement that not until
true religion is combined with true ethics can moral progress become a
possibility “and not a mere ideal.” He explains that “true religion” is reli-
gion devoid of self-opinionated, man-made dogmatism. He further
explains: “Divorced from true religion, morals lose their effectiveness and
cease to guide and control man’s individual and social life.… Not until
these two are rightly combined and brought into full action can there be
any hope for the future of the race” (Compilation of Compilations, Vol. II,
427).

The correlation of spiritual and secular knowledge and its application to
social issues require that we draw from the wealth of knowledge that is
being generated in all the fields of endeavor and invite those of good heart
and like mind to participate with us in such a critical process of social, cul-
tural and moral advancement. To be involved in the wholesome life of
society means that we should celebrate, not run away or isolate ourselves
from, what society offers in relation to sound ideas—methods and views
that are helpful and essential to understanding the human condition.

Connected to this vast effort to learn about secular knowledge is a sim-
ilar process requiring in-depth study of the major works of Bahá’u’lláh,
the Báb, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, and Shoghi Effendi in particular. Among Shoghi
Effendi’s most salient commentaries are The Advent of Divine Justice, The
World Order of Bahá’u’lláh, The Promised Day is Come, Bahá’í Administration,
and Citadel of Faith. It is in the writings of Shoghi Effendi that current and
future events are described. A clear sense of purpose for what is required
of the Bahá’í community is given, and the features and principles of the
Administrative Order are meticulously laid out. In addition, the vision for
the future world civilization is set forth, and profound wisdom, insight and
encouragement are offered. This knowledge is fundamental in under-
standing the present and the future. Without a deep penetration into these
writings, the strategic thinking and abundant effort required to move

80            The Journal of Bahá’í Studies 22. 1/4. 2012

humanity forward over the next centuries cannot be realized.

In-depth study of the writings of Shoghi Effendi prepares us to under-
stand the events that are transpiring in the contemporary world. For
example, his framework of the operation of two processes (integration and
disintegration) enables us to make sense out of the present as well as the
future. Shoghi Effendi described this two-fold process at work in present
day society as consisting, on the one hand, of a “disruptive” and “disinte-
grating” process that is “tear[ing] down with increasing violence, the
antiquated barriers that seek to block humanity’s progress towards its
destined goal.” And on the other hand, he portrays a process attributed to
the unfoldment and construction of the Bahá’í System, a unifying force
that is “essentially an integrating process…associated with the nascent
Faith of Bahá’u’lláh.” Of the destructive forces that characterize the other,
Shoghi Effendi points out that “these should be identified with a civiliza-
tion that has refused to answer to the expectation of a new age, and is con-
sequently falling into chaos and decline” (World Order 170).

The Universal House of Justice describes this process as follows: “[I]f
the Administrative Order is to serve as a pattern for future society, then
the community within which it is developing must not only acquire capac-
ity to address increasingly complex material and spiritual requirements
but also become larger and larger in size” (Letter to the Conference).

Shoghi Effendi’s writings also describe the Lesser Peace and the Most
Great Peace as stages through which humanity will evolve as it moves
toward the future Bahá’í Commonwealth. He describes the current stage
as “a gradual process,” explaining that “as Bahá’u’lláh has Himself antici-
pated,” this stage will “lead at first to the establishment of that Lesser
Peace which the nations of the earth, as yet unconscious of His Revelation
and yet unwittingly enforcing the general principles which He has enun-
ciated, will themselves establish” (Promised Day 201). He then explains
that with the establishment of the Lesser Peace, a “momentous and his-
toric step, involving the reconstruction of mankind, as the result of the
universal recognition of its oneness and wholeness, will bring in its wake
the spiritualization of the masses, consequent to the recognition of the
character, and the acknowledgement of the claims, of the Faith of

Bahá’u’lláh—the essential condition to that ultimate fusion of all races,
creeds, classes and nations which must signalize the emergence of His
New World Order” (Promised Day 201–2). These and a myriad other
examples of Shoghi Effendi’s understanding of the processes at work, and
the end result that these forces will ultimately yield, point to the vital
necessity for the study of his writings. A profound understanding of his
writings provides the indispensable means by which today’s generation is
enabled to build the strong foundation upon which every future genera-
tion will continue its contribution to the structure of a civilization that is
gradually emerging.

THE CONCEPT OF LEARNING
AS DISCUSSED BY THE UNIVERSAL HOUSE OF JUSTICE

The Bahá’í approach to growth involves support for a culture of learning.
The Bahá’í writings tell us that the most effective way to learn is by expe-
rience, by reflection, and by action. The Universal House of Justice writes
that “it is only through continued action, reflection and consultation on
their part that they will learn to read their own reality, see their own pos-
sibilities, make use of their own resources, and respond to the exigencies
of large-scale expansion” (Letter to the Bahá’ís).

Within the psychological literature on human knowledge, some have
observed that at the “knowledge level,” which consists of information that
is acquired from the environment and innate principles of induction and
problem solving, all learning is a matter of experience. Cognitive psychol-
ogy expert John R. Anderson states that “[t]he basic view of human
behaviour is one of a problem solver who has a set of operators for solv-
ing problems and a set of methods for applying these operators. Such a
system has to start out with a way of extracting operators from experi-
ence” (347).

Neuroethicist Paolo Costa in attempting to answer questions such as,
“What is a person?” and, “What is the Self ?” has made a most interesting
statement about the process of human reflection, an observation which is
relevant to this process of action, reflection and consultation. He writes,

82            The Journal of Bahá’í Studies 22. 1/4. 2012

“[R]eflection is essentially problem-oriented, driven by the need to
straighten out the conflicts that have disrupted the ordinary course of our
lives” and, for that reason it cannot “stand back from experience as a
whole.” But this is not all, the author then observes that “the reflective
stance consists of actualizing a potentiality that is implicit in every acting
being and finds its most peculiar expression in humans. We could call it
the urge to self-reliance or self-determination. This must be meant in a
very minimal sense, namely that it is up to the self to live its own life.
Nobody can live it in its stead” (124).

A culture of learning implies willingness on the part of every individ-
ual, according to her or his capacity, to participate in a systematic endeav-
or working together in service to the well-being of the community. Yet
within this focus is the development of the understanding and creation of
that important aspect of Bahá’í culture that informs us how individuals
and Bahá’í institutions operate within society—a society aspiring to reach
a level of maturity that is paramount to its success. In such a context,
learning implies flexibility in thinking and in attitude. It calls for an open-
ness of heart and mind toward new ideas, actions, and views. This envi-
ronment for learning calls for the avoidance of behavior that is oppressive
to others, wherein power on the part of one individual or group is used to
deny access to knowledge and learning on the part of others. It also calls
for the avoidance of false dichotomies and rigid, uncompromising thought.
Instead, it encourages “exercise in raising consciousness” and cautions
against the “awakening of the insistent self ” (Letter to the Conference). It
employs the necessity for consultation, not manipulation. It empowers the
reality of each person through encouragement, positive planning, and sys-
tematic action. This overall approach, writes the Universal House Justice,
is seen as a “striking contrast to the spiritually bankrupt and moribund
ways of an old social order that so often seeks to harness human energy
through domination, through greed, through guilt, or through manipula-
tion” (Letter to the Bahá’ís).

Learning requires understanding of those matters that may be subject
to change and of those that cannot be altered. Many areas are open to
change, but others fall under spiritual laws and principles that cannot be

compromised. For example, world unity is an unchanging principle. The
elimination of all forms of prejudice is an unchanging principle. The har-
mony between science and religion is an unchanging principle. But others
concepts are subject to change under the constant guidance of the
Universal House of Justice. This distinction helps us understand why a
culture of learning is a never-ending and life-long process.

OPENNESS TO THE WIDER SOCIETY
AS ELUCIDATED BY THE UNIVERSAL HOUSE OF JUSTICE

The Universal House of Justice states: “Indeed, the civilization that beck-
ons humanity will not be attained through the efforts of the Bahá’í com-
munity alone. Numerous groups and organizations, animated by the spir-
it of world solidarity that is an indirect manifestation of Bahá’u’lláh’s con-
ception of the principle of the oneness of humankind, will contribute to
the civilization destined to emerge out of the welter and chaos of present-
day society” (Letter to the Bahá’ís).

The knowledge and learning that is being generated in the wider soci-
ety is essential in constructing a world civilization. The challenge is to be
able to distinguish useful and quality knowledge from thoughts or con-
cepts that are frivolous, groundless, and even harmful. In relation to this
distinction, it is helpful to recall ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s guidance that “[i]t is
impossible for religion to be contrary to science, even though some intel-
lects are too weak or too immature to understand truth… religion and sci-
ence [are] to be the measure… of our understanding” (Paris Talks 145).
Of course, there is also good and bad science, and we all must be ever
watchful as we develop our capacity to distinguish the difference between
the two.

Not enough can be said about the importance of the creation of a confi-
dent community that is comfortable and at ease with the wider society and
the many advantageous elements that such a community has to offer to all
aspects of human learning. The Universal House of Justice urges Bahá’ís
“to become increasingly involved in the life of society, benefiting from its
educational programmes, excelling in its trades and professions, learning

to employ well its tools, and applying themselves to the advancement of
its arts and sciences” (Letter to the Conference).

Social action and discourses with society, two elements discussed in the
messages of the Universal House of Justice, will gradually evolve as
knowledge, learning, and involvement in the wider society become com-
monplace in the life of the individual and the community.

CONCLUSION

Never before in human history has there been an opportunity such as the
one available to all today, wherein every individual is able to fully partici-
pate in the dissemination of spiritual and secular knowledge toward the
establishment of a global civilization. Having explored and reviewed the
place of knowledge in civilization-building, we can better realize the
potential for a sea change in transforming habits of thought in every
aspect of human existence. This observation brings to mind what cogni-
tive neurobiologist Paul M. Churchland has said about the process of
moral learning. He describes moral learning as taking time—in his words,
“large amounts of time” (154). He then observes that “[t]he very real
problems posed by moral and political diversity are simply the price that
humanity pays for growing up” (169).

Another insight that has been offered by neuroethicists Adriana Gini
and James Giordano is in relation to human knowledge and the evolution-
ary neuroscience of the human brain. They point out that “humans show
a trend toward not merely surviving, but flourishing” and then proceed to
explain that “human history is punctuated by our attempts to break the
bonds of biological restrictions, and ‘be more than we are’” (343).

For this reason we need more knowledge, a far greater expansion of
learning both spiritual and secular. Here ‘Abdu’l-Bahá raises the level of
human consciousness regarding the potential for our civilizing influence
to improve our social environment when He states:

How long shall we drift on the wings of passion and vain desire;
> how long shall we spend our days like barbarians in the depths of
ignorance and abomination? God has given us eyes, that we may look

> about us at the world, and lay hold of whatsoever will further civiliza-
> tion and the arts of living. He has given us ears, that we may hear and
> profit by the wisdom of scholars and philosophers and arise to pro-
> mote and practice it. Senses and faculties have been bestowed upon us,
> to be devoted to the service of the general good; so that we, distin-
> guished above all other forms of life for perceptiveness and reason,
> should labor at all times and along all lines, whether the occasion be
> great or small, ordinary or extraordinary, until all mankind are safe-
> ly gathered into the impregnable stronghold of knowledge. We
> should continually be establishing new bases for human happiness
> and creating and promoting new instrumentalities toward this end.
> How excellent, how honorable is man if he arises to fulfil his respon-
> sibilities; how wretched and contemptible, if he shuts his eyes to the
> welfare of society and wastes his precious life in pursuing his own
> selfish interests and personal advantages. Supreme happiness is
> man’s, and he beholds the signs of God in the world and in the human
> soul, if he urges on the steed of high endeavor in the arena of civiliza-
> tion and justice.” (Secret 3–4)

The station of knowledge and the generating impulse that knowledge
conveys must needs be acknowledged and extended. Application of knowl-
edge in resolving the multifaceted challenges facing humanity is a long-
term endeavor. Together we are to cooperate and assist each other in this
venture. Through systematic, sustained, and coherent action on the part
of individuals, communities, and institutions, humankind will steadily
progress throughout the future decades as a global civilization unfolds.
