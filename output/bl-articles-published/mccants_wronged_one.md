> **Abstract:**  
>   
> Most Bahá'ís know of only one Tablet of Visitation for the Báb, which is comprised of several brief selections from Bahá'u'lláh's writings compiled by Nabíl at the request of 'Abdu'l-Bahá. In a well-known volume of Persian and Arabic Tablets, however, there exists a hitherto untranslated Tablet of Visitation revealed by Bahá'u'lláh for the Báb. The Tablet is important not only for its devotional content, but also as a eulogy of the Báb written by one who so closely identified Himself with His Forerunner's mission and as a creedal statement pertaining to the station of the Báb and His metaphysical relationship with Bahá'u'lláh.  
>   
> In this paper, an English translation of the Tablet will be presented, preceded by a brief discussion of the practice of zíyára in Islam, particularly in the Shi'i community. The performance of the zíyára for the Báb will be discussed and the Tablet will be compared with other Tablets of Visitation written by Bahá'u'lláh. Finally, the various motifs present in the Tablet will be examined.

The Wronged One: Shí‘í Narrative Structure in Bahá’u’lláh’s Tablet of Visitation
for Mullá Husayn

by William McCants

o understand the significance of the martyrdom of Husayn for the Shí‘í community and the religious lit-

T       erature it occasioned, one must look at the accounts of his pitiful death following his betrayal by his sup-

porters in Kufah; his decision born of indomitable will to stand alone and unaided, save for a small band
of followers, against an army of 5,000; the thirst which afflicted his family; their subsequent slaughter at the
hands of his enemies; the pathetic scene of Husayn clutching his murdered son in his arms; and his final death
and humiliation at the hands of Shamir, who placed his head on a pike and carried it to Yazíd, the Umayyad
Caliph. It was a gruesome parade, the marching dirge of which was crafted from the wails of the few women
left to mourn the dead.

Some historians might question the carefully constructed narrative of the events and cast suspicion upon the
act of memory colored by more sectarian concerns . This, thankfully, is not the province of our inquiry. Rather,
it is precisely the s tructure of this account that demands our attention, as it is the basis of later devotional activ-
ities. Indeed, the account itself may be seen as a devotional acts, a sacralizing narrative played out again and
again in commemorations of Husayn’s martyrdom in the Shí‘í world and in private visitations to his grave.

The central position of Husayn’s martyrdom in the formation of Shí‘í identity can find no greater parallel in
religious writing than the Pas sion of Jesus of Nazareth. Both men, as portrayed in later accounts, were betrayed
by their followers. Both were left to die alone and abandoned, pierced with wounds and mourned by a few
pious women. Death, however, was merely a vehicle for victory in both narratives, granting lasting influence
to the men who had offered up their lives for Truth and thereby demonstrated the falsity of their persecutors’
acts. This core narrative of betrayal, abandonment, suffering, martyrdom, and victory forms the emotional cen-
ter of both Christianity and Shí‘í Islam.

These observations, of course, are not original and have been explicitly expounded by contemporary schol-
ars of religion. What has not been heretofore discerned, however, is the important role that these topoi play in
the narrative structure of the works of Bahá’u’lláh. One may even argue that they are the defining structure
underlying most of His epistles and homilies. Proving such an assertion, however, is not possible in a single
article. Therefore, I have chosen to begin the s tudy of this narrative structure in Bahá’u’lláh’s Tablets by focus-
ing on a single devotional text, a Tablet of Visitation for Mullá Husayn, and its Shí‘í antecedents. After a com-
parative analysis, I will offer some tentative observations about the importance of this narrative structure in the
Writings of Bahá’u’lláh.

To unders tand the kinship between Bahá’u’lláh’s Writings and Shí‘í narratives of the martyred Imám, we
must first examine the structure of devotional texts used during visitations of Husayn’s grave. As will be seen,
these devotions parallel the structure of the narrative of his martyrdom. Although some elements of the narra-
tive may be more pronounced in one text, or absent in another, all of these texts generally conform to the fol-
lowing outline (the elements of which will be indicated in the text, following, in <angle brackets>):

List of Elements:
1. Praise and greetings for previous Prophets, Muhammad and finally his primogeny, particularly the

Imáms.

> 2. The virtues and station of Husayn or the other Imáms
> 3. The struggling (mujáhada) of Husayn in the path of God
> 4. The patience of Husayn during his afflictions
5. Loneliness of Husayn

> a. The abandonment of Husayn and the lack of supporters
> b. Promise of God’s aid and assistance, which will lead to ultimate victory
> c. Promise of revenge on Husayn’s enemies

Lights of ‘Irfán

> 6      The suffering of Husayn
> 7      The weeping of his followers, the heavens and the angels at his martyrdom
> 8      The recognition of Husayn’s spiritual authority or authority of the Imáms (wiláya)
> 9.     The recognition of the purity of the Imám
> 10.    The supplicant asks to be numbered among Husayn’s companions
> 11.    The supplicant asks to be counted among those that were martyred with Husayn
> 12.    The supplicant asks to be accounted among the faithful
> 13.    The cursing (la‘n) of Husayn’s enemies
14.    A final prayer (du‘á’) to Husayn which consists of:

> a. Asking Husayn for intercession (shifá‘a)
> b. Asking for blessings and forgiveness for supplicant and for the supplicant’s parents and family
Intermingled with the prayers of visitation are a series of genuflections that are composed of the recital of
“Alláh-u-Akbar” (takbír), the raising of the hands in supplication (qunút), bending at the waist and placing the
hands upon the knees (rak‘a), prostration (sajda), and, in some texts, the recitation of Qur’ánic vers es. These
genuflections indicate that the recital of the prayers of visitation are not only an inner, spiritual act, but also a
performance, or a series of movements that embody and reinforce the narrative of the text and highlight the
renewal of the covenant between the supplicant and the martyred Imám.

In order to substantialize this adumbration of the various prayers of visitation for Husayn, I have further
summarized two basic Shí‘í devotional texts below. I have chosen these texts because they are different enough
to illustrate the provisional nature of the outline I have provided above, but they also contain the basic themes
common to most devotional texts of the genre. Further, they are fairly far apart in time and differ in authorship
so as to give an indication of the maintenance of these themes throughout Shí‘í history.

The first sample is from a fourth-century (AH) text recorded in the Kámil az-Ziyárát by Ja ‘far b.

Muhammad b. Qulawayya al-Qummí, a Shí‘í Muslim who died in 368 AH. The text, which is purported to be
related from the sixth Imám, J a ‘ far as-Sádiq, begins with a salám (greetings and blessings) upon Husayn, the
angels , who are i dentified as “they who are drawing nigh unto God” (a l - m u q a rr i b ú n), and the
Muslims.<Element 1, above> The supplicant then affirms that Husayn was righteous in his beliefs and is God’s
blood-ransom among humanity (thár alláh).<Element 2> This ransom can only be redeemed through belief in
the Imáms (awliyá’).<8> The supplicant then asks to be endeared to the Imáms both in this world and the next.

At this point, the supplicant walks a little, says “Alláh-u-Akbar” seven times, and stands before the grave
of Husayn. He then praises God and asks to be counted among Husayn’s party (wafd).<Element 10> After this,
the supplicant beseeches God to curse (la‘ana) the enemies of Husayn.<13> The supplicant then asks to be
counted among the faithful,<12> after which he says “Alláh-u-Akbar” five times and walks a little.

Again, the supplicant asks to be numbered among the faithful and to be counted among those who were with
Husayn and martyred with him.<10,11,12> At this point, the supplicant says “Alláh-u-Akbar” three times and
then puts both of his hands on the grave. The supplicant then calls to mind the purity of Husayn and his s tatus
as the ransom of God.<2> After this, he puts both cheeks on the Imám’s grave and then seats himself and men-
tions to God that which he desires. After this, the supplicant returns to his previous position and puts both
hands on his legs, whereupon he praises the Imám and acknowledges that God will kill those who killed
him.<5c>

The supplicant then turns to Husayn’s son, ‘Alí, and mentions whatsoever he desires. The supplicant then
stands facing the graves of the martyrs and gives them greetings (salám) and recognizes them as the most exalt-
ed of all martyrs.<1,2> After this, the supplicant places the grave between his hands and prays for that which
is seemly for him. The supplicant then says that he is approaching God through Husayn, after which he says
“Alláh-u-Akbar” eleven times without pause, walks a short way and then stands facing the Qibla.<14a> The
supplicant then praises God and calls to mind Husayn’s martyrdom and speaks directly to Husayn of God’s
promise to assist him and testifies before Husayn that God has been faithful to His pledge and destroyed his
enemies.<5b/c>

After this, the supplicant says “Alláh-u-Akbar” seven times, walks a little, and then faces the grave of
Husayn. The supplicant then testifies that Husayn was obedient to God’s commands and struggled (jáhada) in

\[84\] The Wronged One

His path (sabíl).<3> After this, he recounts God’s cursing of those who forsook Husayn and those who killed
him.<13> Finally, the supplicant testifies to God’s wiláya as passed down through the Imáms and beseeches
God to curse those who disobeyed Husayn and spilled the blood of the Imáms.<8,13> 1

The structure of the prayer of visitation closely resembles that of the narrative arrangement of the story of
the Imám’s martyrdom, and is, in fact, a symbolic recons truction of those events so that the supplicant might
identify himself with the s uffering of the martyred Imám and reaffirm his ultimate redemption in the hearts of
the faithful. Further, the text also demonstrates the centrality of the wiláyá of the Imám and his liminal posi-
tion as a gateway of divine forgiveness and pardon.

These elements are even more strikingly apparent in a prayer of visitation attributed to the twelfth Imám and
recorded in Majlísí’s voluminous Bihár al-Anwár. The text of the prayer begins with a salám upon the prophets
mentioned in the Qur’án, both major and minor, and upon the Holy Family (i.e. Muhammad, ‘Alí, Fátima,
Husayn and Hasan).<1> Greetings and blessings are also given to the angels that weep for Husayn and cir-
cumambulate his grave and to the signs of physical grief expressed on Husayn’s behalf.<1> In a particularly
moving passage, the supplicant states in the cadence of beautiful rhymed prose (saj‘):

> Peace be upon thee [Husayn] from he who is aware of thy sanctity [hurmatika] and is faithful to thine
> authority [wiláyatika] and is drawing nigh unto God through thy love and is free of (the sins) of thine ene-
> mies.<1,8> Greetings from his heart, lacerated through thy wounds, and from his tears shed at mention
> of thee. It is the greeting of the distraught, afflicted one who, if he had been with thee in Karbila, would
> have shielded thee with his own self from the blades of the swords and expended his last life breath for
> you, and struggled by thy side [jáhada bayn yadayka] and assisted thee [nasaraka] against whomsoever
> oppressed thee.<3> He would have offered up his spirit and his body, his kin and his possessions, as a
> ransom for thee. Verily, his spirit is a sacrifice [fidá’] for thy spirit and his family is (offered up as) a
shield for thy family.<10,11>

> However, the passage of time hath hindered me and that which hath been destined hath prevented me from
> aiding thee and I was unable to fight [muhárib] against whomsoever fought against thee and displayed
> enmity towards thee. Therefore, I lament (thy passing) morning and eve and weep for thee, exchanging
> tears for blood in sorrow over thee and regret for that which hath befallen thee, grieving until I die through
> the anguish of the wounded one . . . <5a> 2

The supplicant then recounts the virtues of Husayn, stating that he was an observant Muslim and struggled
in God’s path.<2,3> Further, his relationship to the Holy Family is detailed and the supplicant testifies that he
faithfully carried out God’s trust.<2> The patience of Husayn during his afflictions is then described and the
supplicant bears witness that he assisted the religion of God and made it victorious through his efforts.<4, 5b>
At this point the supplicant praises the station of the Imám and recounts his s uffering at the hands of his ene-
mies, reemphasizing his fortitude and solitude in the midst of adversity.<2,4,6> The wailing of the women in
Husayn’s party after his death is recounted, as his head is raised aloft upon the point of a spear.<6,7> The sup-
plicant then states that the suffering of Islam and Muhammad are due to Hus ayn’s murder, which brought about
the weeping of the heavens and the angels.<7>

After testifying to Husayn’s sufferings, the du‘á’ portion of the prayer of visitation begins. The supplicant
first asks for entrance to paradise through the intercession (shifá‘a) of Muhammad and his family and implores
them for favor and bounties, blessings and forgiveness.<14a> At this point in the prayer, there are a series of
genuflections, consisting of two rak‘as accompanied by a specified Qur’ánic Súra. The first part of the shahá -
da (the Mus lim creedal statement of belief) is then recited: “There is no god but God.” The supplicant then
affirms his belief in God and His prophets and asks Him to bless the Holy Family and the Twelve Imáms. After
this, he asks for blessings through the Imám Husayn, beseeching God for aid and assistance.<14a> The sup-
plicant then affirms his weakness and God’s power and acknowledges his personal waywardness. This
acknowledgement is followed by a supplication to God through Husayn to grant forgiveness to the supplicant,
his parents and all the believers, both living and dead.<14a/b>

At the end of the prayer, there are further genuflections, after which God is asked for blessings. The sup-
plicant then prostrates upon the tomb and gives a final salám to Husayn. Once he has done this, the supplicant
may then say a private prayer for himself, his parents and for whatsoever else he may desire.<14b>3

Lights of ‘Irfán

Raised as a Twelver Shí‘í Muslim, Bahá’u’lláh would have had knowledge of the various prayers for visi-
tation of the Imáms and been familiar with the general outlines of Husayn’s martyrdom as performed during
‘ Áshúrá reenactments commemorating his death. Therefore, it is not surprising that this reverence for the
Imám Husayn is present in the writings of Bahá’u’lláh. What is surprising is the extent to which the narrative
structure of Husayn’s death, as embodied in histories and devotional texts associated with it, permeates the
Writings and the identity of Bahá’u’lláh. For Him, the narrative of Husayn’s suffering was made flesh and
reenacted in His Person.

To illustrate this point, we will focus on a single text that neatly captures the narrative structure of the vis-
itation prayers for the Imám Husayn and ties together a number of common elements found throughout
Bahá’u’lláh’s writings. The text is a Tablet of Visitation written by Bahá’u’lláh for Mullá Husayn, the first per-
son to believe in the miss ion of Sayyid ‘Alí Muhammad, the Báb.

Throughout His prophetic career, the Báb wrote a number of Tablets of Visitation (ziyáratnáma) for the
Imáms and his followers. In the early days of His ministry, He wrote a Tablet of Visitation for the Imám ‘ Alí
and later wrote one for all of the Imáms known as the “Ziyára jámi‘a al-kabíra.” The Báb also wrote a num-
ber of ziyarátnámas for the martyrs of Tabarsí and one for Fátima. 4 In the Persian Bayán, the Báb limited tomb
visitation (ziyára) to Hims elf and the 18 Letters of the Living, whom He regarded as the return of Muhammad,
Fátima, the twelve Imáms and the four gates (with Himself as the “Primal Point”). 5 In Bahá’u’lláh’s Tablet of
Visitation for Mullá Husayn, we find a confluence of all of these trends: a ziyáratnáma for one of the martyrs
of Tabarsí who was regarded as the return of Muhammad.

The recipient of the Tablet, Varaqatu’l-Firdaws (“The Leaf of Paradise”), was the sister of Mullá Husayn
and distinguished in her own right as an early believer in the Báb and as a learned companion of Táhirih, as
evinced in the following account by her husband, the scholar Skaykh Abú Turáb of Qazvín:

> “I married her three years ago in Kerbelá. She was then but an indifferent scholar even in Persian, but now
> she can expound texts from the Kur’án and explain the most difficult questions and most subtle points of
> the doctrine of the Divine Unity in such wise that I have never seen a man who was her equal in this time,
> or in readiness of apprehension. These gifts she has obtained by the blessing of His Holiness the Supreme
> and through converse with Her Holiness the Pure [Táhirih] (upon whom be the splendour of God!). I have
> seen in her a patience and resignation rare even in the most self-denying men, for during these years,
> though I have no sent her a single diínár for her expenses, and she has supported herself only with the
> greatest difficulty, she has never uttered a word; and now that she has come to Teherán she refrains alto-
> gether from speaking of the past, and though, in accordance with the wishes of Jenáb-i-Bábu’l-Báb, she
> now desires to proceed to Khurásán, and has literally nothing to put on save the one well-worn dress which
> she wears, she never asks for clothes or traveling-money, but ever seeks reasonable excuses wherewith to
> set me at my east and prevent me from feeling ashamed. Her purity, chastity, and virtue are boundless, and
during all this while no unprivileged person hath so much as heard her voice.” 6

> Ishráq Khávarí adds a few more details to our scanty knowledge of Varaqatu’l-Firdaws’ life:
> The young, respected sister [bíbí kúchak-i-hamshírih] of Jináb-i-Mullá Husayn, the Báb al-Báb, who was
> surnamed “The Leaf of Paradise” [varaqat al-firdaws]. She accompanied her brother and mother to
> Karbila, where she married the well-known Shaykh Abú Turáb. After the raising of the call [the declara-
> tion of the Báb], she became a believer in the blessed Cause and was among the companions of Táhirih.
> She accompanied Táhirih to Iran, and, after a brief stay in Qazvín and Tehran, she went to Khorásán and
> stayed in Mashhad. After hearing of the martyrdom of her brother at Fort Tabarsí, she left Mashhad with
> her mother for Bashrúíyih, where she provided service and resided in great difficulty. After a short period
> of time, she set out for ‘Ishqábád to offer (her) customary services until the time of her death. 7

The key to understanding Bahá’u’lláh’s Tablet of Visitation for Mullá Husayn is the multivalent persona of
“Husayn” who is explicitly or obliquely referred to throughout the text. On one level, it is an allusion to Mullá
Husayn, the first person to believe in the Báb. On another, it evokes the image of the Imám Husayn. On yet
another, the persona refers to Bahá’u’lláh Himself, Mírzá Hus ayn ‘Alí. The two latter personae are particular-
ly significant, as Bahá’u’lláh’s spiritual affinity for and identification with His namesake, which He often men-
tions in a number of Tablets, is beyond dispute. 8 He may have also obliquely identified Hims elf with the Imám

\[86\] The Wronged One

in many Tablets by referring to Himself as “the Wronged One” (al-mathlúm), an allusion to Husayn as the
Wronged M artyr (al-mathlúm ash-shahíd). Bahá’u’lláh seems to allude to this equivalence in the opening pas-
sage of the Tablet:

> This is a Book by the Wronged One, Who hath been named “the Glorious” [al-bahá’] in the kingdom of
> eternity [malakút al-baqá’], and “the Exalted, the Most High” [al-‘ Alíy al-a ‘lá] in the dominion of lofti-
> ness [jabarút al- ‘Alá’]. In the Unseen World [láhút al-‘ amá’] He is known by all of the beautiful Names
> of God and in the world below [ard al-anshá’] He is known as Husayn, yet most of the people are wrapped
> in veils and idle fancies [wahm ‘ athím].9

As in the Shí‘í prayers of visitation for the Imám Husayn, Bahá’u’lláh begins the Tablet by mentioning the
prophets and holy ones of old. However, He breaks with tradition by not only identifying Himself with their
suffering, but by identifying Himself as their return.

Tellingly, the blur of the shifting identities in the Tablet is mirrored grammatically with the shift from third
person singular, to second person s ingular, to first person singular, and finally to first person plural, all within
the space of five lines:

> Again He was slain as one oppressed upon the plain of Karbila and with Him they martyred those whom
> God hath related unto His Own sanctified and radiant Self, until such time that they cut off His head and
> banished His family [ahlahu] and paraded them throughout the land [dárúhum fí al-balád]. Likewise the
> hosts of the evil ones condemned Him and once again suspended Him in the air and He was martyred in
> the path of God, the Help in Peril, the All-Powerful, the Omnipotent. Once again Thou wert imprisoned
> in the land of Tá for four months, as is well-known, and the Pen of the Worlds [qalam al-‘álamín] is
> unable to recount that which befell Thee. After that they removed Me from the prison and exiled Me,
> along with my family, from the lands (of my birth) [al-awtán] until We entered Iraq and abided therein.

The next portion of the Tablet even more strongly echoes the visitation texts for the Imám Husayn.

Bahá’u’lláh begins by recounting His suffering at the hands of the oppressors, even though He was solely occu-
pied with spreading the glad-tidings amongst the people. Only God protected Him from their machinations and
granted Him victory over His enemies, even though He was alone and unaided. In response to His loneliness
and suffering, the inmates of heaven weep and the maids of heaven mourn his plight.

Like the visitation texts for the Imám Husayn, Bahá’u’lláh also dwells upon the spiritual station of Mullá
Husayn. Here, there are parallels in tone as well as structure, as Mullá Husayn is praised in terms that were
reserved for the Imáms in Shí‘í Islam. At this juncture, Bahá’u’lláh refers to the station of the first believer in
the Báb by his name, Husayn:

> [T]hrough which the standards of ascendancy hath been manifested and the Sun of grace hath shone forth
> and the moon of bounty hath shed its splendor and the Ancient Beauty hath been established upon the
> Throne of His Name, the Exalted, the Most Great. Through it the Kingdom of Names hath been raised up
> and the Embodiments [hayákil] of the Divine Attributes and the Temple [haykal] of holiness hath been
> adorned with the ornament of His Name, the Most Ancient. Through it the Lord of Command [sultán al-
> amr] hath encompassed all created things and the Sun of bounty hath shone forth upon all beings. By
> means of this Name the two great rivers have flowed through the Twin Exalted Names [al-ismayn al-
> a‘íyayn]. [304]
Surprisingly, Bahá’u’lláh characterizes Mullá Husayn in terms that closely mirror his descriptions of
Manifestations of God that are found in other Tablets:

> Visit Him before (thou visiteth) Me inasmuch as He was sent down [nuzzila] at that time from the domin-
ion of God [jabarút alláh], the Holy, the Most Exalted, the All-Wise, the Omniscient. [305]

Mullá Husayn is also referred to as “the Dayspring of Names and their Fountain-Head and the Dawning-
place of the Divine Attributes and their Depository” (305), and his resting place is called the “Court of
Paradise, the place where the First Name (ism al-awwal) is buried, which God hath made the tomb (mashhad)
of His Temple, the Most Holy, the All-Powerful, the Luminous” (305). As witnessed in the Tablets of Visitation
by the Báb for the Letters of the Living, we have here one of the few ins tances in the Writings of Baha'u'llah
of the expansion of the theophany to include notable believers.

Lights of ‘Irfán

After prais ing Mullá Husayn’s station, Bahá’u’lláh informs Varaqatu’l-Firdaws of the various genuflections
and repetitions of the names of God that are part of the vis itation ritual. Like the visitation texts for the Imáms,
these genuflections and repetitions are integral parts of the communion with the Imám and a means of obtain-
ing divine grace, as evinced in the following passage:

> Praise God, thy Lord [say “ Alláh-u-Akbar”], nineteen times and at each instance of praise, God shall open
> one of the doors of Rizvan upon thy face and waft the sweet savors of the All-Glorified [as-subhán] unto
> thee from the direction of Paradise. (305)
> Finally, Bahá’u’lláh ends the Tablet with a prayer (du‘á’) to be said by the supplicant. The prayer begins
with a testament to the power and authority of the Báb, and then again enumerates the lofty station of Mullá
Husayn. Since the Tablet has been translated in full, I will not quote the passages glorifying the station of the
first believer in the Báb.

After testifying to the station of Mullá Husayn, the supplicant then bears witness to his suffering and his
struggle (mujáhada) in the path of God. Paralleling both the visitation prayers for the Imám Husayn and
Bahá’u’lláh’s own words about himself at the beginning of the Tablet, the supplicant asserts that through God’s
aid, Mullá Husayn helped bring about the manifestation of “the testimony of God and His proof, the power of
God and His omnipotence, the majes ty of God and His grandeur, and His sovereignty over all created things .
. . .” (307) In language identical to that of the visitation prayers for the Imám Husayn, the supplicant bless es
those who have fought with (muháraba) Mullá Husayn against the enemies of God (presumably at Fort Shaykh
Tabarsí) and recognizes his authority (wiláya). Further, the companions of Mullá Husayn are called the Party
of God (hizbu’lláh), just as the companions of Imám Husayn are called the wafd’u’lláh (party, or group of
God). Similarly, the trials and tribulations of Mullá Hus ayn are recounted, which are accompanied by the
weeping of the denizens of heaven. Finally, in a most stunning parallel with the Shí’í visitation texts, the curse
(la‘na) of God is invoked against Mullá Husayn’s enemies.

As in most of the Shí‘í prayers found in the visitation texts, the s upplicant ends by asking God for the for-
giveness of s ins through “Husayn,” but in this case it is Mullá Husayn. The believer also asks Mullá Husayn
and the martyrs of Fort Shaykh Tabarsí for intercession [istishfá‘] with God.

When we compare the elements of this Tablet of Visitation with the outline of the structure of Shí‘í devo-
tional texts detailed above, we find that it clearly shares a formal pattern with the Imámí Shí‘í prayers of vis-
itation for the Imám Husayn. Not only is the flow of the narrative structure the same, but also the precise lan-
guage used to describe Husayn’s martyrdom and ultimate triumph is appropriated by Bahá’u’lláh.

Significantly, this Tablet was not composed in the early days of Bahá’u’lláh’s ministry, where we could
expect to find many of these structural elements which would be familiar to his immediate Shí‘í/Bábí audi-
ence. However, the Tablet was written during Bahá’u’lláh’s exile in ‘Akká. So why would Bahá’u’lláh employ
such a clearly Shí‘í form in this devotional text so late in his minis try?

I believe it is due to the central importance of the narrative of Husayn’s martyrdom in the self-conception
of Bahá’u’lláh. The suffering and loneliness of Husayn is the narrative that Bahá’u’lláh most strongly identi-
fied with throughout His life, going so far as to claim to be the return of the Imám Husayn in physical retelling
of the Shí‘í narrative of the Imám’s martyrdom. Further, these topoi, as arranged in the narrative structure of
Shí’í histories and prayers associated with Husayn’s death, form the underlying pattern of many of
Bahá’u’lláh’s Tablets to believers. Frequently, Bahá’u’lláh recounts in a s ingle Tablet His patience during His
afflictions at the hands of His enemies, relying solely upon God. The heavens weep and the angels sigh at His
suffering, which He bore alone for the redemption of the world. Finally, ultimate victory is promised through
the aid of God and the believers. Bahá’u’lláh will then write a prayer to be recited by the believers, beseech-
ing God through Him for forgiveness and pardon, and asking to be accounted among the faithful.

The assertion that the Shí‘í narrative of the martyrdom of Husayn is the master structure through which
Bahá’u’lláh views His own life and patterns His writings is a broad one and to fully demonstrate the validity
of this argument would require an entire monograph. I hope, however, that this paper will serve as a catalyst
for a more detailed examination of one of the principle structural elements in the Writings of Bahá’u’lláh and
its antecedents in Shí‘í Islam.

\[88\] The Wronged One

Tablet of Visitation for Mullá Husayn*

[p. 301] This Súra of Visitation [súrat az-ziyára] hath been sent down from the dominion of grace [jabarút
al-fadl] on behalf of the First Name of God [li-ism alláh al-awwal] in order that the adoring one [qánitat al-
kubra] and they who have believed in God and His verses may visit him by its means. They, verily, are of those
who have attained.

> He is the Powerful, the All-Mighty, the Exalted [al-‘Alíy], the All-Glorious [al-abhá]!

This is a Book by the Wronged One, Who hath been named “the Glorious” [al-bahá’] in the kingdom of
eternity [malakút al-baqá’], and “the Exalted, the Most High” [ al-‘Alíy al-a‘á] in the dominion of loftiness
[jabarút al-‘Alá’]. In the Unseen World [láhút al-‘amá’ ] He is known by all of the beautiful Names of God
and in the world below [ard al-anshá’] He is known as Husayn, yet most of the people are wrapped in veils
and idle fancies [wahm ‘athím]. None can recount that which hath befallen Him save God, the King, the
Exalted, the Great. At one time He was brutally afflicted by Cain and was slain in the path of God and ascend-
ed unto Him as one oppressed. Such was the state of affairs in days gone by, as God hath known and born wit-
ness. At another time He was sorely tried at the hands of Nimrod and thrown into the fire. God made the fire
as a light and mercy for Him and He, verily, doth protect His servants who have drawn nigh unto Him. Once
again He was persecuted by Pharaoh and that which befell Him hath caused the hearts of the devoted ones to
burn. Again, He was s uspended upon the cross and ascended unto God, the Mighty, the Beautiful. Once more
He was afflicted by Abu Jahl and by them who rose up against Him in dissension from among the people of
hypocrisy. They inflicted upon Him that which He hath not mentioned in the Qur’án [má lá yadhkuru bi-bayán]
and the Self of the Merciful was a witness thereunto and knew that which befell Him. Again He was slain as
one oppressed upon the plain of Karbila and with Him they martyred those whom God hath related unto His
Own sanctified and radiant Self, until such time that they cut off His head and [p. 302] banished His family
[ahlahu] and paraded them throughout the land [dár úhum fí al-balád]. Likewise the hosts of the evil ones con-
demned Him and once again sus pended Him in t he air and He was mart yred in the path of
God, the Help in Peril, the All-Powerful, the Omnipotent. Once again Thou wert imprisoned in the land of Tá
for four months, as is well-known, and the Pen of the Worlds [qalam al-‘álamín] is unable to recount that
which befell Thee. After that they removed Me from the prison and exiled Me, along with my family, from the
lands (of my birth) [al-awtán] until We entered Iraq and abided therein. None can recount that which befell us
in that land at the hands of them who were created by My command. At every moment the shafts of the sedi-
tious were hurled [ramy an-nifáq], even though We concealed [satarná] the Cause and announced the glad-tid-
ings [mubashshir] amidst the servants, calling them unto God, the All-Mighty, the Beautiful, until all of the
religious communities [kull al-milal] rose up against Me with all of (their) might [kull al-hayl]. Truly, I was
alone and betook myself to confront the enemies [muqábilat al-a‘dá’] and My Lord caused Me to triumph inas-
much as I was obedient unto Him [kuntu mustatí‘an ‘alayhi] until He established [haqqaqa] the Cause of God
through His Words and thwarted the designs of those who join partners with God. Through that the fire of
hatred was kindled in the breasts of those who profess faith in the Point of the Bayán. Likewise they allowed
their s ouls to be seduced and Satan extolled their deeds [zayyana lahum ash-shaytán ‘a‘málahum] and they
were among the heedless. I swear by God! There hath befallen me from those (people) that which hath befall-
en no one else. Wherefore the eyes of the helpless [al-qásirát] wept over me in the chambers (of heaven) and
the hearts of the sincere ones cried out and behind them wept the eye of God, the Sovereign, the Omnipotent,
the Exalted, the Wise. The ears of Him Whom God hath made victorious heareth the clamor of all created
things and their lamentation in these days on account of that which befell Us at the hands of those who
acknowledged God in His First Manifestation then disbelieved in Him after He came unto them in the Latter
Beauty [jamál ukhrá], the Sovereign, the Most Manifest. Verily, We (dwelt) among them and among those who
disbelieved among the religious communities of previous times, until [p. 303] the Sun of tribulation shone
forth from the horizon of the Divine Decree and the judgment of exile came to pas s according to that which
hath been set down in the holy and preserved Tablets.

Lights of ‘Irfán

By the one true God! I arose to confront [muqábila] the enemies during the days when the hearts of the mys-
tic knowers were perturbed and the pillars of every s oul quaked, and those who were among us and those who
professed Thy onenes s quivered in fright [iqsha‘arra julúd], until the hos ts of aid and assistance descended
from the dominion of God [jabarút alláh], the Help in Peril, the Mighty, the Great. He protected Me through
the Truth and assisted Me with the angels of heaven and earth and the invisible hosts of (all) the worlds. We
left the city with the ornament of Him (by) whom the wisdom of the wise and the hearts of the mystic know-
ers become bewildered. In every city the Ancient Beauty pass ed, the necks of they who glorify God [al-mutak -
abbirín] were bowed in submission in the presence of His Manifestation. In every spot He came to, the necks
of those who profess the unity of God and they who join partners with Him were (both) bowed low, until we
came to this prison. God is aware of that which we endured at the hands of them who cherished ill-will in their
hearts against this Youth, as if they lay in ambush upon a place of malice [marsad al-ghill li-min al-
muntathirín]. Not a moment hath passed save that the calumnies of the darts of discord were hurled by the
hosts of the perfidious. I swear by God! At all times I am slain by the swords of hatred, as the tongue of God,
the Exalted, the Most High, hath born witnes s. The people are wrapped [kunnina] in great heedlessness and
dissension. If the people will sanctify their ears, they, verily, shall hear at this time that which their Lord, the
All-Glorious [al-abhá] is crying out in the realms above and shall be of those who harken. However, they are
veiled [ihtajaba] from that which the Tongue of the Ancient of Days is saying in the dominion of utmost sor-
row [jabarút al-aghmam] and they are of those who are heedless. They rose up against us in such wise that
they have condemned Me to death without clear proof [bayyina] from God and a great Book. Verily, the hosts
of (divine) aid and assistance were sent down again and again and God protected Me through them and made
Me to speak forth with His remembrance and made Me manifest through His sovereignty and made Me to shine
forth with the lights [p. 304] of the holiness of His grandeur and speak with the praise of His Own Self, the
Exalted, the Most Great. Such is that which hath been decreed for us and we have recounted it truthfully that
perchance the people might be numbered amongs t those that have apprehended the truth.

O leaf of Paradise [waraqat al-firdaws]! When this radiant and resplendent Tablet hath reached thee, rise
from thy seat and take it with the hand of submission [yad al-khudú‘], then inhale from it the fragrance of God,
thy Lord and the Lord of all the worlds. Call to mind, then, my misfortunes which have been revealed in it that
thou mayest be (numbered) among those women in the Tablets who make mention of God, the Help in Peril,
the All-Mighty, the Omnipotent. Teach, then, the Cause of thy Lord among those women who are in thy com-
pany and among those men who are guided by the guidance of the Spirit [hidáyat ar-rúh] and accounted among
the well-ass ured.

Drink with healthy relis h, O leaf of Paradise, inasmuch as the breezes of the Spirit have wafted unto thee
and attracted thee unto the Egypt of the Divine Presence, the spot of the recognition [‘irfán] of thy Lord, the
Almighty, the Peerless. Thou hast drunk from the chalice of the mercy of thy Lord and attained unto that which
none in all the worlds have attained. Therefore, render thanks unto thy Lord, then raise thy hands in supplica-
tion [uqnutí], and then bend down with thy hands resting on thy knees [irka‘í], and take hold of the Book of
God through His power. Verily, it is a mighty Book [kitáb ‘athím].

Well is it with thee inasmuch as God hath related thee unto his [Mullá Husayn’s] name through which the
standards of ascendancy have been manifested and the Sun of grace hath shone forth and the moon of bounty
hath shed its splendor and the Ancient Beauty hath been established upon the Throne of His Name, the Exalted,
the Most Great. Through it the Kingdom of Names hath been raised up and the Embodiments [hayákil] of the
Divine Attributes and the Temple [haykal] of holiness have been adorned with the ornament of His Name, the
Most Ancient. Through it the Lord of Command [sultán al-amr] hath encompassed all created things and the
Sun of bounty hath shone forth upon all beings . By means of this name the two great rivers have flowed
through the Twin Exalted Names [al-ismayn al-a‘íyayn]. None have drunk from them save those whom God
hath singled out for His Cause, those whom He hath enraptured among His servants and they whom He hath
purified among His creatures and made the dawning-places [p. 305] of His Beautiful Names and the manifes-
tations of His exalted Attributes. He hath numbered them among those who have attained unto the Presence of
Him Who is the Inaccessible, Incomparable, the Omnipotent.

O leaf of Paradise! Visit Him before (thou visiteth) Me, inasmuch as he was sent down [nuzzila] at that time
from the dominion of God [jabarút alláh], the Holy, the Most Exalted, the All-Wise, the Omniscient. When

\[90\] The Wronged One

thou dost desire to begin thy visit to the Dayspring of Names and their Fountain-Head and the Dawning-place
of the Divine Attributes and their Depository, arise and turn thy face unto the Court of Paradise, the place
where the First Name [ism al-awwal] is buried, which God hath made the tomb [mashhad] of His Temple, the
Most Holy, the All-Powerful, the Luminous . When thou hast turned (thy face), stand still and praise God [kab -
birí alláh, i.e. say “Alláh’u-Akbar” ], thy Lord, nineteen times and at each instance of praise, God shall open
one of the doors of Ridván upon thy face and waft the s weet savors of the All-Glorified [as-subhán] unto thee
from the direction of Paradise. In such wise hath the Command been decreed from the presence of the
Almighty, the All-Wise. Repeat “Alláh’u-Abhá” [tubahhá] nine times with certitude in His Cause and
acknowledgement of His sovereignty while glorifying His Own Self and submitting to His manifestation and
drawing nigh unto the face of Him who is the Most Holy, the Most Resplendent [at-Táli‘], the Most Manifest,
the Effulgent [al-báhir], the Luminous [al-lámih], the Radiant, the Refulgent. Then say: “I bear witness by my
very soul and my ess ence, my being and my tongue, and by my heart and the limbs of my body, that there is
none other God but Him and that the Point of the Bayán is, verily, His manifes tation and His revelation [burúz]
and His glory [‘izzuhu] and His honor [sharafuhu] and His grandeur for all who are in the Concourse on High.
Moreover, He is His majesty and His might and His power [iqtidáruhu] among all that are in the heavens and
on earth. Verily, He who hath been manifested through Truth is His sovereign over all who are in the heavens
and on earth and His glory [bahá’uhu] over all who are in the dominion of Command and the world of cre-
ation [jabarút al-amr wa al-khalq].”

Say, then: “Upon Thee, O secret of the Divine Decree, be the firs t Spirit, made manifest from the reposito-
ry of grandeur [makman al-kibriyá’], and the first mercy, which descended from the heaven of holiness from
the right side of the throne, the seat of our Lord, the Exalted, the Most High, and the Temple of the irrevoca-
ble Purpose [haykal al-amdá’] and the Word of the M ost Perfect in the dominion of eternity [jabarút al-baqá’]
and the Most Great Name in the Kingdom of created things!

I bear witness by my own essence, [p. 306] and by my soul and my tongue, that Thou art the one through
whom the Beauty of the Most Praised was established upon the Throne of His Name, the Most Merciful, and
through whom the Primal Will hath been made manifest unto the people of the earth [ahl al-akwán] and
through whom the melody of Paradise hath been sent down from the heaven of grace from the presence of Thy
Lord, the Almighty, the Beneficent, and through whom the Cause of God, the Help in Peril, the Omnipotent,
the Powerful, the Ordainer, hath been made manifest. I bear witness that Thou art the first light manifested
from the Beauty of Oneness [jamál al-ahadiyya] and the first sun which shone forth from the horizon of
Divinity [ufuq al-iláhiyya]. But for thee, the Beauty of the Divine Identity [al-huwwiya] would not have been
manifest and the secrets of eternity [as-Samadiyya] would not have been revealed. I bear witness that through
thee the birds of the hearts of them that long for thee have soared unto the atmosphere of nearness and reunion
and the hearts of the lovers have tasted the sweetness of intimate communion and the beauty of the radiance
of the sun of the Face of Thy Lord, the Majestic [al-jalál], the Glorious [al-ajlál]. But for thee, none would
have known the Self of God and His Beauty nor would any soul have attained unto the shores of His nearness
and His Presence. Contingent being would not have quaffed the water of his bounty and loving-kindness, and
all created things would not have slaked their thirst through the wine of His grace and generosity. Through thee
the veils of all existent things have been rent asunder and the Kingdom of Names and Attributes hath been
made manifest. Through thee every soul hath been guided unto the shores of holiness and grandeur and through
thee the Mystic Dove hath warbled upon the twigs [afnán] of eternity and the Bird of the Throne hath sung
upon the branches [aghsán] of the Sadrah of Bahá. Through thee the Beauty of the invisible world [al-ghayb]
hath been made manifest through His Name, the Exalted, the M ost High and through thee all Good [kull khayr]
hath been sent down from the dominion of the Divine Essence [jabarút al-‘amá’] unto the kingdom of creation
[malakút al-badá’] and every grace which the finger of God hath traced upon the Tablet of the Divine Decree.
Through thee all created things have been encompass ed by the mercy of God, the Mighty, the All-Knowing,
the M ost Great. But for thee, heaven would not have been upraised nor the earth inhabited. The oceans would
not have appeared, nor the trees born fruit and the leaves would have remained bereft of verdure [p. 307] and
the sun of grace would not have shone forth from the horizon of holiness and radiance. Through thee the
breezes of forgiveness have been wafted upon all who are in the heavens and on earth. Through thee the gates
of Paradise were flung open unto all people, and the hearts of them that have believed in God, the Almighty,
the Most Powerful, the Generous, have been enraptured. Thou art the Word through which God hath decided

between all created things and dis tinguished the joyous [as-sa‘íd] from the miserable [ash-shaqá] and the light
from the darkness and the believer from him who hath joined partners with God, from that day to this, in which
heaven hath been rent asunder. God hath come upon clouds [thulal] from (the world of) Command and around
Him are a company of His chosen angels. When the veils are torn asunder and the Face cometh from behind
the coverings with the hosts of power and glory [ribwát ‘izz ‘athím] and they who render thanks unto God, (the
people) shall flee on the right and on the left and drunkenness shall seize all who are in the heavens and on
earth save a few letters [‘iddat ahruf] (belonging to) the face of thy Lord, the Merciful, the Compassionate.

I testify that thou hast born the trust of Thy Lord, the All-Merciful and hath known the Beauty of the All-
Glorified [jamál as-subhán] before all existent things were created and that thou hast attained unto the pres-
ence of God in the day which none knew of save thee. This is due to a grace from God Who created thee
through it before the creation of the heavens and the earth. I bear witness to thy remembrance through which
the tongues of all created things were loosed in praise of their Lord, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise, and to thy
praise of He who is thy Maker. All things have arisen [qáma ‘alá] in praise of Him and to this beareth witness
all of existence [kull al-wujúd] in both the visible [ash-s huhúd] and invisible [al-ghayb] worlds and beyond
them God Himself knoweth and testifieth to the truth of My words. I bear witness that thou hast assisted the
religion of God and made manifest His Cause and struggled [jáhadta] in His path inasmuch as Thou wert obe-
dient unto Him. Through thine aid the testimony of God and His proof, the power of God and His omnipo-
tence, the majesty of God and His grandeur, and His sovereignty over all created things were made manifest.
Blessed be they [p. 308] who struggled with thee and battled agains t [hárabú ma‘] the enemies of God by thy
command and circled round thee and entered the shelter of thine authority [waláyatuka] and drank from the
living waters of thy love and suffered martyrdom before thy face and were laid to rest [ruqidú]10 within the
precincts of Thy court. They, verily, are of those who rest peacefully [ar-ráqidín]. I testify that they are the
helpers [ansár] of God upon His earth and His trustees in His lands and the people of God [hiz b alláh] amongst
His creatures and the hosts of God amongst His creation and the pure ones of God betwixt the heavens and the
earth.

I bear witness to the great tests and overwhelming adversities which befell thee in the path of thy Lord and
the tribulations which compassed thee on every side. Nothing prevented thee from the path of thy Creator and
thou didst exert thyself [jáhadta bi-nafsika] until thou wert slain as a martyr in His way. Thou didst offer up
thy spirit, soul, and body out of love for thy Master, the Ancient of Days. I testify that all things between heav-
en and earth and the eyes of those who have drawn nigh unto God behind the Tabernacle of manifest glory
wept over thy suffering. The mystic maidens [al-húriyyát] bared their heads in the celestial chambers [al-ghur -
fát] and beat upon them with wondrous and holy fingers. They pros trated their faces upon the dust and sat upon
the ashes and cried out at that time in the luminous, crimson11 chambers. I testify that through Thy misfortune
[fí musíbatika] all created things have been clothed with the robe of black and the faces of the sincere ones
have paled. The pillars of those who profess the unity of God have been shaken and the eye of might and
grandeur hath wept in the exalted and holy dominion [jabarút]. I bear witness at this time, O my master, in my
present state that thou hast not fallen short in thy duty towards thy Lord nor hast thou tarried out of love for
thy Master. Thou hast proclaimed His Cause in both the East and the West until thou dids t sacrifice thyself as
a martyr in His path. [p. 309]

May God curs e [la‘an alláh] those people who have oppressed thee and rebelled against thee and attacked
thy soul and caviled at thy face and denied thy testimony and failed in their duty towards thee and turned away
disdainfully from submis sion to thee [al-khadú‘ bayn yadayka]. Verily, they were among those who join part-
ners with God. Therefore, I beseech God by thee and by them who are in thy presence to grant me forgiveness
and pardon my sins and sanctify me from the defilement of the earth and make me of those who are pure. Grant
that I may attain His Presence during these days in which all are heedless of Him and are shut out as by a veil
(from Him). Enable me to stand firm with Him and obedient to His cause and to have certitude in His Own
Self and steadfastness in His verses and enter into His shade, and be established within the court of His mercy,
martyred [ash-shaháda] in His path and repentant unto His Self, the Exalted, the Mos t Great. Though thee we
beseech God to debar us not, in these days, from the splendors of the lights of His Face nor deprive us of the
wonders of His grace nor shatter our hopes in His mercy which hath encompassed all the worlds . We ask God
to make us firm in His love and steadfast in His Cause in such wise that our feet shall always remain upon His

\[92\] The Wronged One

Path [sirát], which hath been made manifest through the power of Truth among the heavens and the earth.

Mercy, praise and glory [al-bahá’] be upon you, O pure ones [asfiyá’] of God amongst the servants, and his
trusted ones [umana’] in the lands , and upon your bodies [ajsád] and your selves [ajsám] and your spirits, and
your firs tness [awwalikum] and your lastness, and your inner and outer beings, and upon them who have abid-
ed in your midst [hallú jawárakum] and circumambulated you and attained unto the door of your mercy and
stood before the manifestation of the lights of your forgiveness and entered the threshold of your nearness and
drew nigh unto God though you and sought intercession [istafsha‘ú] from God through your souls and visited
your sanctuary and sought to be blessed by your grave [turba] and sought guidance by your guidance. They,
verily, are of those who are turning unto your holy, sanctified, illumined, and radiant faces.

Therefore, O my God and my Master! I beseech Thee by him and by them who have been laid to rest
[r uqidú] [p. 310] in his midst [fí hawlihi] to number us among those who have s oared in the atmosphere of Thy
mercy and quaffed the wine of Thy favor and bounty and attained unto the pinnacle of graciousness through
Thy generosity and Thy tender mercies and tasted the sweetness of Thy remembrance and scaled the loftiest
heights and the highest stations through Thy grace and manifold favors and are detached from all things and
travel swiftly unto the court of Thy gracious favors. The breezes of the glory of Thy tender mercies and the
fragrances of Thine eternal holiness have seized them. Verily, Thou art the Omnipotent, the All-Powerful, the
All-Wise.

O our God and our Beloved! Forgive us and our parents and they who are close to us among those who
believe in Thee and in Thy verses and in Him Who hath been manifested through Thy Sovereignty. Make us
then, O my God, powerful in this world through Thy might and grant that we may attain unto Thy presence in
the next world. Debar us not from that which Thou dost possess nor shatter our hopes in all of that which
beseemeth Thee. Verily, Thou art the Bounteous, the Most Excellent, the Benevolent and, verily, Thou art our
Lord, the All-Merciful and our God, Whose help is implored by all men and upon Whom we rely [‘álayka at-
tuklán]. None other God is there but Thee, the Ever-Forgiving, the Generous, the All-Merciful.”

Thus have we set forth this Tablet for thee, O leaf of Paradise, and made mention of thee in order that thou
mayest follow that which thou hast been enjoined to follow and be among those who adore (God) in the holy
and luminous Tablets.
