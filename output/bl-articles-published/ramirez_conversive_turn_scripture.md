The Conversive Turn in Bahá’í
Scripture: An Intersubjective
Communications Model for
Bridging Global Diversity
SUSAN BERRY BRILL DE RAMIREZ

Abstract
The Bahá’í writings offer extensive scriptural directives regarding the processes
of conversive communications and their necessity for unifying a divided planet.
Conversive communications manifest equality of participants, a spiritualized un-
derstanding through both mind and heart, and integrative consequences for in-
dividual and interpersonal coherence. The conversative aspect is an essentially
collaborative, intersubjective, and relational, co-creative articulation that brings
diverse persons and elements of the world together. The conversion aspect sig-
nifies the transformative capacity of language to transform persons and worlds
through the unifying power of deep interpersonal connections. Bahá’í consultation
is one form of conversive communications.

Resumen
Los escritos bahá’ís ofrecen directivas extensas en sus textos religiosos refer-
ente a los procesos de comunicaciones conversivas y su necesidad para unificar
un planeta dividido. Las comunicaciones conversivas expresan igualdad de los
participantes, una comprensión espiritualizada tanto mental como de corazón
y consecuencias integradoras para la coherencia individual e interpersonal. El
aspecto conversador es una articulación co-creadora esencialmente colaborativa,
supuesta a sujeción entre si y relacional, juntando personas y elementos diversos
del mundo. El aspecto de conversión significa la capacidad transformadora del
idioma para transformar personas y mundos mediante el poder unificador de
conexiones profundas entre personas. El proceso consultivo bahá’í es una forma
de comunicaciones conversivas.

Introduction
As the most contemporary of the world’s religions, the guidance given
in Bahá’í scripture is distinctively relevant to the complexities of today’s
emerging global community. While the spiritual verities that underlie
the world’s diverse religious faiths are strikingly similar, the specific laws
and institutions established by each religion diverge insofar as the needs
of their respective times and cultures require. As ‘Abdu’l-Bahá explains,
“Present exigencies demand new methods of solution; world problems are
without precedent. . . . Ancient laws and archaic ethical systems will not
meet the requirements of modern conditions.” (Promulgation of Universal
Peace 140). One area in which the development of the Bahá’í Faith diverges
substantially from its religious predecessors regards its rhetorical orien-
tation, presentation, and emphasis. Regardless of geography, century, or
cultural tradition, all of the religions of the world, prior to the Bahá’í Faith,
emerged within the context of vibrant oral traditions and a concomitant
illiteracy (even where writing was extant but not yet widespread, as in the
cases of Judaism, Christianity, and Zoroastrianism).

The Conversive Turn in Bahá’í Scripture                   29

Originating in an increasingly literate and textually oriented world,
whose respective oral traditions have been variously receding into distant
memory, the Bahá’í Faith emphasizes the crucial role of sacred orality for
the relational harmonics that bring persons together. The Bahá’í writ-
ings offer extensive scriptural directives and explanations regarding the
processes of conversive communications and their necessity for a divided
planet whose nations, regions, communities and families are sorely riven
by discord, horrific violence, and socioeconomic deprivations. Briefly, what
distinguishes conversive communications (conversative and conversional)
from other forms of communications is the constitutive conjunction of (1)
co-equal, intersubjective relationality (the equality of participants), (2) a
deep epistemological use of mind and heart (spiritualized understanding),
and (3) the integrative consequences of individual and interpersonal co-
herence (a resultant unity of persons or groups).

Whereas most communications modes involve the use of persons for lin-
guistic and rhetorical ends of expression, information, argument, and per-
suasion (persons serving linguistic and logical ends), the opposite is true
for conversive communications, where language and reason are the means
towards larger ends of interpersonal and intergroup unity (language and
reason serving as unifying means to real world cohesion). Bahá’u’lláh’s
tablets and prayers exemplify the power of conversive articulation for the
integrating and unifying capacities that adhere in spite of and, more im-
portantly, because of the rich diversity of humankind.1 After a brief pre-
liminary historical and religious review of the shifts from oral to textual
cultures, the section “The Linguistic Turn to the Conversive” (36–41)
provides a more developed explication of conversive communications, de-
lineating and explaining fundamental differences between discursive and
conversive communications, including etymological clarification.

To approach the conversive, it is necessary to begin with its gradually
diminishing presence over the course of time and cultural shift. The tran-
sitions to increasing global literacy and the development of textually in-
formed cultures, which albeit still do not reach the majority of the world’s
impoverished and undereducated masses, have brought tremendous ben-
efits to the world in the arenas of the arts, science, technology, and commu-
nications. While global telecommunications and electronic networks span

30             The Journal of Bahá’í Studies 17. 1/4. 2007

the planet, facilitating international and regional connections previously
impossible, one of the profound ironies of the turn to the text (whether
written, video and film, other performative, or electronic) has been the
almost universal turn away from the conversive. Contemporary discourse,
whether in the public or private arenas, largely privileges the discursive
utterance: the language and its denotative and connotative significance,
the argument and its reasoning and validity, and the specific discursive
content—all of which can be delivered orally, textually, or electronically.
Even though it is the case that conversive communications are more the
norm within traditionally oral cultures, it is crucial to note that the conver-
sive can also be manifested in written and electronic form.2 As mentioned
above, the significant distinction lies in the inverse functioning of means
and ends with discourse using persons as the means towards informational
and argumentative ends versus conversive communications using language
and reason (ratiocinative and empathic) as the means towards relationally
unifying ends.3 An overview of the historical evolution towards the text
demonstrates the transitions from the inclusive wholeness of conversive
orality to the increasing textual divides and hierarchies of cartographic
imperial exclusion.4

The story of the great shift towards the Western, and now globalized,
traditions of secular learning begins with the development of alphabeti-
cally based writing and the technological advances that furthered the
widespread reliance on the printed word. While these innovations made
possible tremendous societal progress as knowledge became more objec-
tive, objectified, and distanced from the knower, they also facilitated a
radical break as learning gradually became more secularized and textual-
ized into information that could be frozen in time (and on the page) and
thereby easily categorized and defined and dissected as an object of study.
There is a power and an immediacy to orality that is much more difficult
to achieve through the mediation of the text (whether written or elec-
tronic). Of course, it is one thing to use writing for the record keeping
of accounts and legislation; it is quite another to have personal engage-
ments with the Word of God mediated by textual limits. Perhaps the most
successful convergence of oral and written traditions can be found in the
Hebrew people’s capacity to maintain the vibrancy of sacred stories even

The Conversive Turn in Bahá’í Scripture                   31

when preserved by textual means (Applbaum 3–12; Tannen, “Oral/Liter-
ate” 15). For example, the complexly metaphoric and richly connotative
creation stories of the Hebrew people articulate a people’s spiritual and
creative origins, including their tribal geographies of belonging and an-
cestral homelands, their moral responsibilities to God and each other, and
the consequences of disobedience. These stories are richly fleshed out in
diverse ways when conversively brought to storytelling life, as in the Pass-
over Seder; but when they are dissected and decontextualized from their
tribal, cultural, regional, ancestral, and sacred origins, then the interpre-
tive possibilities surrounding creative metaphors are attenuated into literal
facticity, complex symbols are reduced to fixed archetypes, and rich story-
telling traditions become lost behind the superficiality of the text (Goody,
“Alternative Paths” 211–2). Alan Dundes explains this process in Holy Writ
as Oral Writ, in which he notes that the processes of textualization permit-
ted the realm of the sacred to become inscribed within the bounds of a
secular analytic that defined it in logocentric terms as mythology (2). This
can be seen more broadly in the Eurocentric readings of modernity that
reduced sacred orality to the point of absence as origin, genesis, emergence
stories were misinterpreted as little more than mythic fables.5 As Talal
Asad points out, “[T]he rereading of the scriptures through the grid of
myth has not only separated the sacred from the secular, it has helped to
constitute the secular as the epistemological domain” (43).

In a critical distinction from the past religions and various oral sacred
traditions of the world, the Bahá’í Faith is the first to emerge within the
condition of a prevailing global literacy. The complex history of the transi-
tions to increasing literacy is inextricably interwoven with the trajectories
of Manifest Destiny and global empire-building agendas. Even though the
majority of the world’s people during the nineteenth century were illiterate
and the powers of empire explicitly worked to occlude the colonized and
marginalized populations within their domains, an ironic consequence of
the turn to the text is that one of the key tools of control was to encourage
literacy, but in the languages of conquest. Shifts towards westernized edu-
cation served the ideologies of empire building as colonized peoples were
taught the diminishment and devaluation of their own cultures, traditions,
histories, and beliefs.6 Whereas the history of literacy among the Jewish

32            The Journal of Bahá’í Studies 17. 1/4. 2007

and Muslim populations was religiously driven, by the nineteenth century,
the movements towards literacy were intertwined with the geopolitics of
the time. Regardless of the specific historical channels that have produced
their respective literate demographics, today most Jews and Christians and
many Muslims are able to read their sacred texts, a sharp contrast from the
situations of their predecessors, who had to rely on literate intermediaries
who would orally transmit the guidance of scripture to the masses—the
most educated often being members of the clergy. The various textual cul-
tures of modernity, ranging from the early developments of writing and
its performative forms (such as drama, poetry, and chant) to more recent
media (video, electronic, and contemporary technological performance
modes) present a categorically different demographic within which to have
a religion of God originate and develop. This signifies new parameters
of interpretive mediation that complicate direct conversive engagements
with the Word for the majority of the world’s inhabitants in ways that in
the past challenged only the few.

Textual Turns to the Conversive Sacred
One religious effect of the change to an increasingly textually oriented
world is that certain oral communication proclivities of the human ex-
perience with the divine, which traditionally have been familiar to people
living within oral cultures, have become more foreign to participants of
cultures that are more heavily mediated by the text. Over time, the un-
derstandings and practices of sacred song, chant, prayer, and meditation
as intercessionary “conversations with God” have largely become lost and
forgotten behind the layers of ritualized and textualized utterance that
often becomes attenuated to little more than disengaged rote recitations.7
The revelation of Bahá’u’lláh provides an extensive remedial primer that
delineates conversive relationality to a modern audience increasingly dis-
tanced from its oral traditions. The orally informed methods of conver-
sive communications (what French Caribbean theorist and writer Édouard
Glissant terms “Poetics of Relation”), which are implicit in the scriptures
and practices of the world’s earlier faiths, are renewed and made explicit in
the tablets and prayers of Bahá’í scripture. For an audience whose lives are

The Conversive Turn in Bahá’í Scripture                    33

more textually mediated, Bahá’u’lláh articulates the Word of God in the
form of the Book8 while insuring the immediacy and power of the conver-
sively revealed Word.

The rhetorical turn in Bahá’í scripture towards the conversive evidences
a significance far beyond the more limited scope of its surface textuality,
for the realm of the conversive is inherently relational with the text of the
Book serving the larger spiritual ends of an interpersonal ingathering. This
scriptural shift manifests, clarifies, and requires fundamental transforma-
tions in contemporary human communications that encompass the inter-
woven domains of linguistics, psychology, epistemology, and the practice
of interpersonal human relations. Bahá’u’lláh makes it very clear that all
the sacred traditions of the world throughout time have advocated deeply
relational and transforming communications, but that, today, not only do
the majority of people not communicate conversively, but that many have
even forgotten how to do so, instead communicating in the more efficient,
yet superficial, manner of discourse in which communications stay at the
levels of ratiocinative thought, personal opinion, and emotional response.
It is important to remember that the central distinction between discourse
and converse is directional regarding means and ends: whether the per-
sons are the means towards the ends of the argument, in the former, or
the language and thought are the means towards the ends of interper-
sonal relationality (unity). In traditionally slower-paced oral cultures, it
was easier for individuals to consider another’s words at the deeper levels
of reflection and concentration (“ponder this in thy heart,” as Bahá’u’lláh
writes in one of the Hidden Words). The global primacy of discourse and
the text today is such that as Walter Ong asserts in Orality and Literacy:
The Technologizing of the Word, “We—readers of books such as this—are
so literate that it is very difficult for us to conceive of an oral universe of
communication or thought except as a variant of a literate universe” (2).
Bahá’u’lláh makes it very clear that a turn to the conversive is crucial for
the well-being of all of our lives today. In this way, empathically engaged
communications can serve the larger ends of familial, community, regional,
and global needs. Attention to conversive communications as articulated
and advocated by Bahá’u’lláh is presented as requisite to the resolutions of
the world’s problems, both big and small.

34            The Journal of Bahá’í Studies 17. 1/4. 2007

The significance of this shift cannot be overstated, for Bahá’u’lláh states
that human utterance is the most powerful means for human transfor-
mation. Abrogating the Islamic law of jihad for the Bahá’ís, Bahá’u’lláh
states that now, true conversion to the Faith of God must focus on people’s
hearts, and that such a transformation cannot be achieved by means of
force, but rather by means of the Word of God as communicated in rela-
tionally intersubjective and heartfelt human speech: “Arise for the triumph
of My Cause, and, through the power of thine utterance subdue the hearts
of men. . . . Indeed through the power of good words, the righteous have
always succeeded in winning command over the meads of the hearts of
men. Say, O ye loved ones! Do not forsake prudence. . . . and beware lest
your hands or tongues cause harm unto anyone among mankind” (Tablets
84–85). In a post-9/11 world imploding under the burdens and legacies of
empire building and regional and global colonizations, the importance of
such guidance is patently clear.

Bahá’u’lláh proclaims that the central problem in the world today is the
fact that humans have forgotten how to communicate conversively, with
God and His Prophets, with each other, and with nonhuman members of
creation (e.g., animals, plants, the Earth, stars).9 As expressed in Bahá’í
scripture, the most powerful and effective remedy for the world’s problems
is not to be found within the arenas of politics or economics, but rather
within the realm of communications. In the Lawh-i-Maqsúd, Bahá’u’lláh
delineates that solutions to the world’s troubles require the knowledge and
understanding that can only be reached through the specific conversive
communications process of consultation: “The heaven of divine wisdom is
illumined with the two luminaries of consultation and compassion. Take
ye counsel together in all matters, inasmuch as consultation is the lamp
of guidance which leadeth the way, and is the bestower of understanding”
(Tablets 168). Within the framework of cultures in which most forms of
communication are elicited and responded to fairly quickly at the levels
of minds and passions, the much slower-paced and contemplative mode of
conversive consultation, common among past cultures, is now distanced
from our view and eludes our conceptual grasp. Bahá’u’lláh repeatedly
urges his readers to “ponder” in conjunctive thought that involves both
mind and heart, thereby avoiding the divides that result in the extremes

The Conversive Turn in Bahá’í Scripture                   35

of unfeeling reason or uncontrolled emotion. This process that, for a liter-
ate world, Bahá’u’lláh and ‘Abdu’l-Bahá need to declare and reiterate and
explain again and again was part of the fabric of everyday life in oral cul-
tures.10

Bahá’í scripture advocates an interwoven process of deep thinking and
reflective feeling—emphasizing that conversively informed thought and
communications lead to spiritualized words and actions. Prior religious
traditions mention this process of deep thinking, but it is not given the
rhetorical and epistemological tutorial emphasis that it has in the Bahá’í
writings. In one of the Psalms when King David speaks to God, he says,
“[M]y heart standeth in awe of thy word” (119:161). The rightful place
for thought is identified as a person’s heart in Islam. One of the hadiths of
Islam, as recorded in the Bukhari translation and initially related by Abu
Huraira, affirms that “the Prophet said, ‘Allah said, “I have prepared for
My righteous slaves (such excellent things) as no eye has ever seen, nor an
ear has ever heard nor a human heart can ever think of ”’” (9.93.589). From
the earlier Zoroastrian tradition in Persia, the Book of Common Prayer
(known as the Khorda Avesta) of the Zend-Avesta contrasts the spiritual-
ized knowledge that is informed by a faithful and enlightened heart versus
the heart that is unenlightened and limited by one’s passions: “The man
without glory, led astray from the right way, grieves in his heart; the man
without glory thinks thus in himself: . . . But I think thus in my heart”
(105–6). In Christian scripture, the Gospel according to Matthew relates
that Jesus criticized those whose hearts do not think good thoughts: “Je-
sus knowing their thoughts said, Wherefore think ye evil in your hearts?”
(9:4). Delineating the epistemological emphasis the Báb placed on a per-
son’s heart, in his appropriately titled volume Gate of the Heart, Nader Saie-
di affirms that the heart is “the supreme seat of spiritual truth, the abode
of divine revelation” (102).

‘Abdu’l-Bahá states explicitly that the “spirit” of communications (oral
or written) is determined by the condition and focus of the speaker’s heart:
“Man’s speech is the revealer of his heart. In whatever world the heart trav-
els, man’s conversation will revolve around that center. From his words you
can understand in what world he is traveling” (qtd. in Hornby 339). Then
referencing the Imám ‘Ali of the Shi‘ah Islamic tradition, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá em-

36            The Journal of Bahá’í Studies 17. 1/4. 2007

phasizes that a person’s articulated words are informed by and, thereby,
reflect her or his spiritual condition: “For this reason His Holiness ‘Ali
says: ‘Man is hidden behind his tongue. Out of the abundance of his heart
does man speak’” (qtd. in Hornby 339).11 Perhaps more important than
any other prescription in the Bahá’í writings is Bahá’u’lláh’s oft-repeated
guidance for people’s communications to become increasingly conversive
and, accordingly, respiritualized. Bahá’u’lláh states that the lack of such
spiritually informed communications has produced “men . . . whose words
are the pride of the world, and whose deeds are the shame of the nations”
(Tablets 61). He points to “expositions and discourses . . . [that] cause the
spirits to be chilled” (Tablets 142). Bahá’u’lláh declares that by clinging
to a superficial textuality, deep meaning is lost: “[B]y holding fast unto
names, they deprive themselves of the inner reality,” of “the ocean of inner
meanings,” and of the “spirit” with which “every word is endowed” (Tab-
lets 58, 167, 172). Even more intriguing is Bahá’u’lláh’s affirmation that “a
kindly tongue . . . clotheth the words with meaning, it is the fountain of the
light of wisdom and understanding” (Epistle to the Son of the Wolf 15). This
concept of heartfelt significance will be clarified by investigations into the
linguistic subtleties of conversive relationality.

The Linguistic Turn to the Conversive
To approach the conversive turn advocated in Bahá’í scripture, it is neces-
sary to delineate the subtle, yet categoric, differences between conversive
and discursive communications. The importance of this nominal change
cannot be overstated, for as Wittgenstein reminds us, “A new word is like
a fresh seed sewn on the ground of the discussion” (Culture and Value 2e).
As already noted, the realm of the conversive reflects the dual aspects of
conversation and conversion. The conversative aspect is an essentially
collaborative, intersubjective, and relational co-creative articulation that
brings diverse persons and elements of the world together. The conver-
sion aspect signifies the transformative capacity of language to transform
persons (human and nonhuman) and worlds through the unifying power
of deep interpersonal connections: what John Attinasi and Paul Friedrich
refer to as “life-changing” or “conversion conversations” (43). Attinasi and

Friedrich note the importance of the conversive for scholars where such
relationally based and mutually transforming “conversion conversations”
push us beyond “the limits of conventional social science and suggest new
standards and goals” (43, 49) for scholarship that transcends “the relentless
dominance of textuality in the scholarly mind” (Ong, Orality 10). Whereas
scholars have tended to focus on the divide between orality and literacy
(Ong, Orality and Literacy), parole and langue (de Saussure), and speech and
writing (Derrida), an analysis of the etymology and processes of conver-
sive and discursive communications delineates foundational differences
that prove to be more significant than the more superficial dissimilarities
of orality and textuality.

Webster’s unabridged dictionary explains the Latinate etymology of the
word “discourse” as “a running to and fro” (745). This word can be divided
into its prefix dis- and its root currere to run. The dictionary defines dis- as
follows: “A prefix denoting: 1. Separation or parting from, . . . 2. Reversal,
undoing, negation, or depriving” (Webster’s 740, italics in original). The first
definition of the prefix is the one that refers to its predominant usage in
discourse; however, as we shall see, the second meaning’s sense of negation
also bears interesting and profound implications that apply—notably the
extent to which discourse invariably impedes, and possibly even negates,
the collaborative process of interpersonal communications. The concept
and practice of discourse presume a separation that is bridged by language
and logic. Regarding the dialogic form of discourse, Anton L. Becker points
out that “a dialogic stance . . . [involves] negotiating a ground between us”
(239): the interstices that Bruce Mannheim and Dennis Tedlock refer to
as “the economics of verbal exchange” (4, 8) and that Mikhail Bakhtin de-
scribes as the linguistic “borderline between oneself and the other” (293).

At the underlying grammatical levels of its language game (using the
Wittgensteinian sense of language use with its attendant rules of play),
discourse occurs when there is reasoned communication that proceeds in
a logical and necessarily consecutive sequence. Of course, in its dysfunc-
tional and discordant forms, the logic and language are disjunctive and
productive of interpersonal alienation and disunity. In its functional forms,
discourse is reasoned, logical, and formulated with emphasis placed on
the sense or signification that is discursively conveyed through language,

38             The Journal of Bahá’í Studies 17. 1/4. 2007

whether in oral or written form. The participating individuals (the dis-
coursers) are relevant as the transmitters and receivers of the presented
argument, but it is the argument that takes precedence in this ostensibly
objective mode of communication. The words, the text of the arguments,
the rhetorical presentation, and the logical thinking take primacy over the
speaking or writing subjects and listening or reading audience whose dis-
cursive significance is primarily as vehicles for the ends of the articula-
tion. This being said, it is important to point out that the logical sense of
discourse is not purely bounded by strict ratiocinative limits of deductive
argumentation.

Discourse can take many different forms, ranging from the more con-
flictual and confrontational (which further distances the discoursers from
each other) to a more collegial expression of views (which, even so, main-
tains the positional divides). Whether delivered in either monologic or
dialogic forms, the difference here lies primarily in the number of persons
participating in the discourse, one in the case of a monologue or two or
more in the case of a dialogue. Regardless of the number of participants,
in any form of discourse, at the center of the communication lies the in-
terstitial text, words, argument, logic. The primary roles for the partici-
pants consist in the thinking and transmitting of that which is being ut-
tered (orally, textually, or electronically). It is crucial to reiterate that even
though discourse can take on a dialogic form with multiple persons, largely
peripheral to the notion and practice of discourse is the relevance of the
relationship between the participants (Ong, Interfaces 53–81). The multiple
voices of dialogic discourse provide the opportunity for diverse subjects
to present their views while at the same time positionally asserting their
subjectivities and positions at the expense of their respective listeners’ rel-
egation to an objective status (even though the positions of sender and
receiver may shift back and forth over the course of the dialogue). In other
words, the person in the subjective position or role of speaker displaces the
“others” to the grammatical positions of passive listening objects. Once
another speaks, in dialogue, the prior speaker is displaced from speaking
subject to listening object position. Regardless of any speaker’s subjectiv-
ity in discourse, persons are subservient to the language and logic which
hold primacy at the expense of interpersonal relations.

As Bakhtin clearly states, dialogism is an inherently positional and op-
positional process: “one point of view opposed to another, one evaluation
opposed to another, one accent opposed to another” (314). Discourse de-
centers, minimizes, and in some cases actually causes to disappear alto-
gether the participating persons behind their constructed roles as discur-
sive instruments. Becker and Ong point out that such privileging of the
logos invariably marginalizes the speaking/writing subject and audience,
resulting in an essentially “autonomous” and “voiceless” discourse (Becker
249; Ong, Orality 78–81). While the multiplicity and possible heteroglos-
sia12 (diverse tongues) of dialogic communication may give the appearance
of a conversation or conversive relationship, it is crucial to recognize that,
in many cases, this is the appearance, not the reality, of an intersubjective
conversivity.

Conversive communications give primacy to the developing intersubjec-
tive relationship that is being developed or strengthened among its mutu-
ally co-creative participants: here language and reason are subservient to
relational ends. The linguistic manifestations of hierarchized power differ-
entials evidenced in the various discursive modes of communications are
absent within conversively informed communications where, conversely,
we find a centering relationality that is co-creative and mutually empower-
ing of all involved. This is evident in the word’s very constructions (e.g.,
conversive, conversant, conversation, converse, and conversion) where the
prefix “con-” signifies “with, together” and the Latin vertere has the sense of
“to turn, to change, to translate” (Webster’s 555, 2834). The word comes
from the Latin conversatio which has the senses of “frequent abode in a
place, intercourse, manner of life”: intercourse as opposed to discourse
(Webster’s 582). As Deborah Tannen points out, “In narration and conver-
sation, the particular enables listeners (or readers) to provide a subjective-
ly real understanding”—their co-creative “participation in sense-making”
(“Waiting” 215), what Angela Hildyard and David R. Olson recognize as
a “‘speaker’s meaning’ . . . preserved in the mind of the listener” (20), what
Claude Lévi-Strauss has described as “a kind of continuous reconstruction
taking place in the mind of the listener” (49), and what Karl Kroeber refers
to, within a storytelling framework, as “a social transaction in which the
audience ‘participates’ as actively as the teller” (8). As R. P. McDermott

40            The Journal of Bahá’í Studies 17. 1/4. 2007

and Henry Tylbor affirm, “Collusion is necessary for any conversation”
(219).

In conversive communications, words and moments of silence both facil-
itate deeply resonating interpersonal connections and understanding that
are personally and interpersonally transforming, thereby contributing to
lived unity in the world. The realm of the conversive is that of coming
together, of ingathering, of changing through relationship, of interperson-
al transformations. “Changing with” is like a dance in which each person
maintains her or his individuality, subjectivity, and value while interact-
ing intersubjectively and co-creatively with fellow person(s)—a coming
together in “unity in diversity” (Shoghi Effendi, World Order 41). Whereas
discourse is a means of division, separation, distinction, and differentiation
followed by a ratiocinative and logocentric bridging of distances which,
more often than not, serves to perpetuate and/or accentuate the divides,
conversive processes recognize and affirm the diversity and subjectivities
that are manifested throughout creation as diverse persons (human and
nonhuman) enter into relationships that interweave the fabric of creation
in continually unfolding worlds and lives. In this fashion, the more deep-
ly rooted connective links that are otherwise obscured behind the more
superficial veils of difference and appearance are, in turn, affirmed and
strengthened—hence the fact that conversive knowledge emerges within
the framework of the relationship between the knower and that which she
or he is learning.

There is a fluidity to conversive communications that elides the posi-
tionality of discourse. Since each participant is a co-equal and co-creative
subject throughout conversively informed engagements, each person’s sub-
jective status as an active participant is affirmed both in one’s own speech
and actions and, more importantly, in the speech and behaviors of the fel-
low participants. Hierarchies of power and binary divides are the stuff of
discourse. Conversive communication is definitionally relational and in-
tersubjective. As Iranian Bahá’í novelist and scholar Bahíyyih Nakhjávaní
tells us, “There is a language lying all about us that we have not learned
to read. There is a syntax of the spirit that we hunger for. But, accustomed
to the narrow roads of grey assumption and the fierce possessive drive for
resolution, it is hard for us, this desperate generation, to turn aside from

the highway . . . and consider what we’ve missed. . . . The road, its teeth
clenched in grammatical assertion, has forgotten what it chased” (6–7).
The parameters of the conversive yield integral change in individuals and
relationships that result from the deeply intersubjective, communicative
intercourse demonstrated linguistically in spiritualized, empathic, and ex-
periential relationship.

Conversive Transformations
Verbal and/or experiential communications that are conversive can provide
important means towards intersubjective knowing and interpersonal trans-
formations or conversions (Anderson 211–34). The therapeutic qualities of
interpersonal communications have been widely accepted across cultures
and times. In classical Greece, Aristotle noted the cathartic healing effects
of group storytelling and drama. Indigenous communities worldwide have
long observed healing ceremonies dependent on specific verbal articu-
lations (e.g., consultative gatherings with elders, chants, songs, prayers,
recitations, storytelling). Additionally, the methodology of conversation
has been at the center of psychological and psychiatric therapeutic pro-
cess for over a century with a variety of theoretical and methodological
approaches, each of which manifest varying degrees of conversivity and
discursivity (largely determined by theoretical approach and practitioner
skill). Recently, scholarship has begun to consider explicitly the potentially
transformative effects that conversations and oral storytelling offer in per-
sons’ lives, even in everyday interactions. As Harlene Anderson explains
in Conversation, Language, and Possibilities: A Postmodern Approach to Ther-
apy, “One of the most important features of life is conversation. We are
in continuous conversation with each other and with ourselves. Through
conversation we form and reform our life experiences and events; we cre-
ate and recreate our meanings and understandings; and we construct and
reconstruct our realities and our selves” (xvii).

In their essay “Maps and Meaning in Life and Healing,” consultant clini-
cal psychologist Peter Harper and play therapist Mary Gray affirm that
within more orally informed cultures, personal healing and change invari-
ably occurred within relationally conversive settings, especially noting the

42             The Journal of Bahá’í Studies 17. 1/4. 2007

“therapeutic” power of the storytelling event: “The creation and telling of
stories has been used universally by cultures, communities and individuals
to provide hope, meaning, purpose and understanding in life” (42, 51–61).
Echoing Anderson’s emphasis on the concrete transformative capacities of
conversation, Kedar Nath Dwivedi and Damian Gardner affirm that this
is true in “the stories that we have about ourselves” which they claim “are
constitutive or shaping of our lives” (32). Folklorist Karl Kroeber goes even
further, suggesting that conversive communication in the form of “story-
telling is perhaps humanity’s primary tool for changing reality” (13).

The central role that conversive communication has played in people’s
lives and communities throughout time is perhaps most poignantly dem-
onstrated in its telling absences. Harper and Gray emphasize the psychic
and social loss that accrues due to the lack of conversive relations and sto-
rytelling in persons’, families’, and communities’ collective lives. With the
“increasingly individualistic orientation [of] twentieth-century Western
society . . . [and the] significant decline in the oral tradition, . . . successive
generations appear to have developed an increasingly egocentric focus”
(42). Play therapist Sonia Compton points to the transformative healing
in children that comes from told stories, noting that storytelling permits
the listener to engage with the story at the deeper level of “the uncon-
scious mind, therefore giving the opportunity for unconscious thinking
and behavior to come into the conscious mind . . . [often with] resolutions
to conflicts and different coping strategies” (169–70). This is the transfor-
mative knowing that combines mind (the conscious level of linguistic and
reasoned thought) and heart (the unconscious level of insight and inspira-
tion).

Insofar as religious communications are concerned, at the heart of all of
the world’s religions and sacred oral traditions is the emphasis on persons’
and communities’ spiritual transformations as elicited through the power
of the Word of God—which Bahá’u’lláh affirms as “the supreme animating
power for the advancement of the world and the exaltation of its peoples”
(Tablets 86). Bahá’u’lláh qualifies this process later on in this same tablet,
stating that the transforming capacity of scripture requires the individual
to come into a conversive relationship with the sacred so that one’s heart
can be transformed by that Word: “The Word of God may be likened unto

a sapling, whose roots have been implanted in the hearts of men. It is in-
cumbent upon you to foster its growth through the living waters of wis-
dom, of sanctified and holy words, so that its root may become firmly fixed
and its branches may spread out as high as the heavens and beyond” (94).
Here and elsewhere, Bahá’u’lláh emphatically affirms the centrality of con-
versively transformative communications, stating that the growth of the
Word of God in the world is contingent upon humans’ increasingly sanc-
tified words and wisdom that reflect the successful implantation of that
Word in their hearts. This process is underscored further in Bahá’u’lláh’s
categoric avowal of its role in spiritually informed interpersonal communi-
cations: “They who are the beloved of God, in whatever place they gather
and whomsoever they may meet, must evince, in their attitude towards
God, and in the manner of their celebration of His praise and glory, such
humility and submissiveness that every atom of the dust beneath their feet
may attest the depth of their devotion. The conversation carried by these
holy souls should be informed with such power that these same atoms of
dust will be thrilled by its influence” (Gleanings 7). The transformative
power of conversive communications lies less in the specificity of its words,
reasoning, and facts, and more in the articulative relationship that one en-
ters into through the engagement of “holy souls.” This is not to say that
spoken and heard words are unimportant. They are indeed a crucial part of
effective communications, but in conversive communications, there is the
deeper relational element of the sacred that makes those words enlighten-
ing, ennobling, and deeply transforming. In its most powerful form, con-
versive communications are evidenced in the revelatory Word of God as
presented by the founders of the world’s religions and the prophets of the
world’s oral sacred traditions.

A core teaching of the Bahá’í Faith is the principle of progressive rev-
elation that posits that God has always made His Word available to all
people since the beginning of time and that every human person has al-
ways had the opportunity to come into relationship with the sacred. As
‘Abdu’l-Bahá explains, “As you have observed, at the time of the appear-
ance of each Manifestation of God [e.g., Moses, Buddha, Zoroaster, Jesus
Christ, Muhammad, Bahá’u’lláh] extraordinary progress has occurred in
the world of minds, thoughts and spirits” (Some Answered Questions 163).

44            The Journal of Bahá’í Studies 17. 1/4. 2007

Such transformations of human lives and cultures, Bahá’u’lláh makes clear,
are dependent upon the crucial power of sacred communications between
people and the divine, and also spiritualized and loving communications
among persons—a fact that Bahá’u’lláh states has been the case through-
out human existence. In His tablet Lawh-i-Maqsúd, Bahá’u’lláh conveys
that “Moreover He [God] hath in every age and cycle, in conformity with
His transcendent wisdom, sent forth a divine Messenger to revive the
dispirited and despondent souls with the living waters of His utterance”
(Tablets 161).

Even beyond people’s individual engagements with religious scripture,
Bahá’u’lláh calls for a broad application of conversive communications
and conversive ways of knowing. He laments the global crises that come
from people’s incapacity to orient their thought processes through God’s
Word: “The world is in great turmoil, and the minds of its people are in a
state of utter confusion” (Tablets 94). Bahá’u’lláh states over and over again
that human understanding must be deepened, that wisdom is desperately
needed to guide the world’s peoples. A conversive response engages with
scripture, human expression, and the natural world at the deeper levels of
heart and spirit, considering what has been heard, read, or otherwise expe-
rienced in contemplative and meditative ways that open the person to em-
pathic and spiritualized understanding. Key to this process are moments
and periods of silence during which external inputs (what is read, seen, ex-
perienced) and internal thoughts and feeling are given deep consideration
at the level of heart. The person’s receptivity to the higher susceptibilities
opens in such deepened prayer and meditation, enabling the understand-
ing that comes from inspiration and insight. Many indigenous writers and
thinkers have affirmed that this part of the process is inherently relational
as persons’ hearts come together through love and affection (Tapahonso;
Silko 54–57). Reflecting on the Bahá’í teachings, John E. Esslemont writes,
“Heart alone can communicate to heart the state of the knower” (89).

Conversive Relations Across Worlds—Prayer and Meditation
Within all frameworks of the sacred (whether the more formal institu-
tionalized religions or oral sacred traditions), there is the profound sense

that conversive communications are possible across worlds, as a human
person comes into relationship with those beyond this world. Upon be-
ing asked whether “a departed soul [can] converse with someone still on
earth,” ‘Abdu’l-Bahá affirms that interactively conversive communications
occur across worlds, but that their form is different from conversations
expressed orally or textually in human language: “A conversation can be
held, but not as our conversation. There is no doubt that the forces of the
higher worlds interplay with the forces of this plane. The heart of man is
open to inspiration; this is spiritual communication. As in a dream one talks
with a friend while the mouth is silent, so is it in the conversation of the
spirit” (Paris Talks 178). Bahá’u’lláh urges his followers and all who peruse
his Tablets to enter into their own relationships with the divine—the most
powerful means of doing this being prayer, which ‘Abdu’l-Bahá defines as
“conversation with God” (qtd. in Esslemont 88). Bahá’u’lláh further points
out that the founders of the world’s religions conversed with God: “Thus
in moments in which these Essences of Being were deep immersed beneath
the oceans of ancient and everlasting holiness, or when they soared to the
loftiest summits of Divine mysteries, they claimed their utterances to be
the Voice of Divinity, the Call of God Himself ” (Gleanings 54).13

Such sacred communications are not reserved only for mystics and the
prophets of God, for all sacred traditions specify the importance of prayer,
song, chant, meditation, or other forms of sacred conversive communica-
tions for their adherents. In prayer, the supplicant speaks to the divine
and, during moments of silence, perhaps hears a response. In meditation
upon scripture, the reverse communications process occurs, for during
the reading, chanting, singing, or other recitation of scripture, one listens
to the Word of God, while the silent moments are when the individual
conversively responds to the divine. Also, during those deep moments of
reflection, contemplation, and meditation, the individual’s heart opens to
the influx of the Holy Spirit and the love of the divine. John E. Esslemont
explained this process using ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s words to the early followers of
the Bahá’í Faith in the West:

> In order that God may make known His Mind and Will to men, He
> must speak to them in a language which they can understand, and this
46            The Journal of Bahá’í Studies 17. 1/4. 2007

> He does by the mouths of His Holy Prophets. While these Prophets are
> alive in the body They speak with men face to face and convey to them
> the Message of God, and after Their death Their message continues to
> reach men’s minds through Their recorded sayings and writings. But
> this is not the only way in which God can commune with and inspire
> those whose hearts are seeking after truth, wherever they are, and what-
> ever their native race or tongue. . . . ‘Abdu’l-Bahá speaks much of this
spiritual language. He says, for instance:—

“We should speak in the language of heaven—in the language of the
> spirit—for there is a language of the spirit and heart. It is as different
> from our language as our own language is different from that of the ani-
mals, who express themselves only by cries and sounds.

“It is the language of the spirit which speaks to God. When, in prayer,
> we are freed from all outward things and turn to God, then it is as if
> in our hearts we hear the voice of God. Without words we speak, we
> communicate, we converse with God and hear the answer.” (Esslemont
> 88–89)

The deep receptivity of successful spiritualized communications requires
that persons engage their hearts and spirits in addition to their minds and
senses in the conversive processes as interactive speakers and listeners. Re-
gardless of whether conversive communications are manifested orally, tex-
tually, or electronically, such communications are definitionally relational
and intersubjective and reliant upon the practice of silence for mutual con-
templation and response.

In 1993, a letter written on behalf of the Universal House of Justice to
an individual Bahá’í spoke to the contemporary challenges to and require-
ments for deep interactions with scripture: “But, in addition to needing
the proper spirit, it requires concentration and meditation to unravel the
meanings which lie enshrined in the Revealed Word. Nowadays, however,
the lives of most people are busy and crowded with distractions, so it re-
quires great discipline to devote the time, attention and care necessary to
study the Teachings in the way they deserve. Deepening is like a skill or
art which must be acquired through effort.” To assist such efforts, Bahá’í
scripture embeds such time and silences in the very texts of Bahá’u’lláh’s

tablets and prayers. In many of the original Arabic and Persian texts, there
are line breaks (similar to poetic formats) that invite the reader as a con-
versive listener-reader to pause, consider, and respond.14 These line breaks
represent the emphatic, empathic, and meaningful pauses that are heard in
an oral presentation—demonstrating the speech and silence of a speaker
engaged in a conversation.15

Especially in light of the religious strife that today is so endemic glob-
ally, it is important to underscore the fact that evidence of conversive
communications across worlds is exemplified in the diverse religious and
sacred traditions of the world. As Zulkiple Abd. Ghani affirms about Is-
lamic teaching and belief, “human communication does not only function
horizontally with fellow beings, but also vertically with God” (39). This
is the very conversive process that Bahá’u’lláh explicitly asserts is lack-
ing in the world today and which is desperately needed to re-spiritualize
people’s lives, thoughts, and actions. In his tablet Kalímát-i-Firdawsíyyih,
Bahá’u’lláh cites the nineteenth century Iranian philosopher Hájí Mullá
Hádí Sabzivárí: “Alas! Attentive ears are lacking, otherwise the whisper-
ings of the Sinaic Bush could be heard from every tree” (qtd. in Tablets
61). Within the textual cultures of much of the world today, often those
prayerful vertical communications become formalized and textualized into
monologues or dialogic litanies which are categorically different acts from
that of conversively informed prayer, meditation, and knowledge. In light
of the increasing pace of many people’s lives today, what once were the
deep, slow, and considered conversive prayers of an earlier era have, all too
often, turned into monologic recitations without time even being taken at
the end for reflection and response.

In the study materials devised by the Ruhi Institute for Bahá’í study
circles, Book 1, Reflections on the Life of the Spirit, laments that “Unfortu-
nately, humanity is steadily losing its understanding of how to pray, sub-
stituting empty and meaningless rituals for indispensable inner conditions.
Therefore, the study groups should consult a great deal on the sections of
the unit which refer to the attitudes of heart and mind that help one enter
the state of prayer, and to the conditions that should be created in one’s
surroundings at the time of prayer” (3). Bahá’u’lláh’s explicit instructions
regarding the conversive process of prayer provide the needed tutorial for

48            The Journal of Bahá’í Studies 17. 1/4. 2007

followers of all religious and sacred traditions whose prayers and medita-
tions have become increasingly formalized and textualized.

The Ruhi methodology and program, developed by Bahá’ís in Columbia,
consists of a structured program of study circles that assist individuals in
learning how to engage conversively with the Word of God in prayer and
meditation and, also, how to apply those lessons in communication with
one’s fellow persons in the world. The passages from scripture included
in the first Ruhi workbook focus on speech (prayerful, truthful, loving)
and deeds (“pure and goodly,” unifying, and contributory to the peace and
“betterment of the world”). As a primer for learning conversive speech
and listening, abbreviated scriptural passages are used so that study circle
participants can practice the effective application of deepening silence. One
short selection and its use demonstrate this program in which conversive
communications are taught and practiced: “When a thought of war comes,
oppose it by a stronger thought of peace. A thought of hatred must be
destroyed by a more powerful thought of love” (‘Abdu’l-Bahá, Paris Talks
29; Reflections 14).16 A conversive engagement might have a person read or
hear the beginning clause, “When a thought of war comes,” and during the
brief comma pause, a conversive reading or listening would elicit a brief
silent response. Perhaps it might be a heartfelt consideration of the seem-
ingly ever-present thoughts and actions of war today or the daily news me-
dia reports or perhaps a momentary reflection of one’s own all too many
thoughts, discussions, debates, and arguments regarding war.

After the momentary consideration of pervasive “thoughts of war,”
‘Abdu’l-Bahá says that we must “oppose” any thought of war “by a stronger
thought of peace.” At the longer period pause, the listener-reader might
consider the idea that “thoughts of peace” can be strong and potentially
stronger than thoughts of war. Perhaps the listener-reader might feel the
very strength of peace in his or her breast, perhaps the unifying power
of prayer and visions of persons coming together in unity. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá
continues, bringing his words about war down to the level of every in-
dividual person, saying that “A thought of hatred must be destroyed by
a more powerful thought of love.” Not solely the arena of international
governmental and military concern, the elimination of war is offered to
each of his listener-readers as an integrally personal responsibility. Hatred

leads to war; peace comes from love. The pause at the end of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s
sentence regarding the capacity of “powerful thoughts of love” to “destroy”
thoughts of hatred invites each listener-reader to consider where in his or
her own life hateful, angry, and otherwise unloving thoughts occur and
which must needs be “destroyed by a more powerful thought of love.” As
demonstrated in these two paragraphs, conversive interactions require a
spiritually (or, at the very least, an empathically) strategic use of time and
silence whether this is during the silent moments of prayer when the sup-
plicant listens for reply or during periods of meditation upon scriptural
passages with silence reflective of the individual’s deeply felt responses
to the Word of God. For prayer and meditation to literally become such
“conversations with God,” exertion of time is essential, as Shoghi Effendi
makes explicit in his reminder, “For conversation is after all a slow pro-
cess” (Compilation of Compilations 270).

Epistemology and Conversive Ways of Knowing
The post-Platonic and post-Cartesian West has focused the study of epis-
temology and human ways of knowing predominantly in the capacities
of the individual person and individual mind as articulated in Descartes’
famous dictum “Je pense dois je suis” (“I think therefore I am”). Bahá’u’lláh
categorically affirms the importance of the individual and the human mind,
revealing the following in His tablet Kalímát-i-Firdawsíyyih: “the greatest
gift and the most wondrous blessing hath ever been and will continue to
be Wisdom”—here signifying the deep conversive knowledge that comes
from the conjunctive processes of mind, heart, spirit, and experience (Tab-
lets 66). In one of his Paris talks, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá offers a parallel assertion,
stating that “God’s greatest gift to man is that of intellect, or understand-
ing” (41). Emphasizing the highest respect that the Bahá’í teachings give
to knowledge and understanding, in a tablet addressed to the early Bahá’í
Mírzá Maqsúd (Lawh-i-Maqsúd), Bahá’u’lláh declares, “The man of con-
summate learning and the sage endowed with penetrating wisdom are the
two eyes to the body of mankind. God willing, the earth shall never be
deprived of these two greatest gifts” (Tablets 171). It is crucial to note that
the Bahá’í affirmation of the importance of mind in no wise gives primacy

50            The Journal of Bahá’í Studies 17. 1/4. 2007

nor centrality to this means of knowing. While the valuation of mind is un-
questioned, there are two areas in which Bahá’í scriptural guidance seeks
to redirect contemporary thinking and knowledge production and our
understandings of those processes: one is the primacy given to deepened
thought; the second is the recognition and appreciation of the relational
function of conversive knowledge creation.

Throughout Bahá’í scripture, Bahá’u’lláh articulates that the processes
of knowledge and understanding are neither bounded by nor rooted in the
domain of ratiocinative intellection—instead the sacred is reoriented to its
centripetal center with reason, words, and logic displaced from any sense
of logocentric primacy and relocated as tools of knowing. The dangers of
such logocentrism for scholarship is made explicit in the Lawh-i-Maqsud,
where Bahá’u’lláh writes, “Such academic pursuits as begin and end in
words alone have never been and will never be of any worth” (Tablets 169).
Bahá’u’lláh calls his followers and the world to an epistemological model in
which the seat of knowing is the heart (not the mind); the process of know-
ing is fundamentally relational (not individualistic); all knowledge that is
meaningful is rooted in the sacred (not secular)17; the primary method of
knowing utilizes reason in conjunction with love and inspiration; the mode
of scholarship is conversive (not discursive); and the ends of learning are
“the knowledge of the Ancient of Days,” the spiritual growth of the know-
er, and real world benefits to human (and nonhuman) prosperity and the
advancement of civilizations (Gleanings 263, 215).

Specifically regarding the domain of scriptural interpretation, Bahá’u’lláh
writes, “The understanding of His words and the comprehension of the
utterances of the Birds of Heaven are in no wise dependent upon human
learning. They depend solely upon purity of heart, chastity of soul, and
freedom of spirit” (Kitáb-i-Íqán 211). He even goes further, noting that
knowledge per se (not just knowledge of religious or spiritual matters) is
housed in the heart and that such knowledge comes from God: “Knowl-
edge is a light which God sheddeth into the heart of whomsoever He wil-
leth” (Kitáb-i-Íqán 184). Indeed, Saiedi, as noted above, references the Báb’s
Commentary on the Verse of Light II (Tafsír-i-‘Ayiy-i-Núr) in which the
Báb distinguishes the revelatory and epistemological roles of heart, spirit,
soul and body, noting the distinctive capacity of heart as the seat of rev-

elation, inspiration, and knowing (102–4). It is this deepening stage that
moves the knowing process into a communications model where knowing
is an intersubjective process in contradistinction to the more objective and
objectifying ratiocinative methods of secular study. As ‘Abdu’l-Bahá pithily
asserted almost a century ago, “Knowledge is love” (qtd. in The Ocean of
My Words 20).

It is here that the Bahá’í turn to the conversive is its most revolutionary,
for Bahá’u’lláh teaches that the process of deep knowing is a fundamentally
relational process between the knower, fellow/sister knowers, the divine,
and whatever it is that one seeks to know. The Bahá’í emphasis on the im-
portance of consultation and conversive deep knowing clarifies that under-
standing is an essentially communicative act that needs to be understood
in relational, empathic, and spiritual terms with applied consequences that
benefit the world. This is akin to what Anderson confirms regarding con-
versive communication: “conversation . . . [with] its transformational na-
ture . . . is the most important vehicle for the construction of meaning”
(108, 109). Intersubjective communications and relationships that are ex-
plicitly or implicitly grounded in the sacred may be the primary distinction
between conversive ways of knowing and a more discursive epistemology:
the former reflecting a process in which one knows something by being in
relation to it, by being a part of its reality and world, and by bringing it
into one’s own world; the latter consisting of knowledge (or information)
that comes from being outside and separated from the object that one ob-
serves and analyzes. These are the processes that Dennis Tedlock differen-
tiates as “the participating eye and the objectifying eye” (Spoken Word 15).

Scholars in a number of diverse fields (philosophy, psychology, literary
theory, anthropology, and indigenous studies, among others) have begun
to interrogate the long held Platonic bias in favor of ratiocinative reason.
Karen J. Warren critiques the tendency towards “an exaggerated empha-
sis on reason and rationality, and the attendant ‘hyperseparation’ of rea-
son from emotion,” explaining that “research in emotional intelligence .
. . shows that the rationalist philosophical tradition that separates reason
from emotion, elevates reason to a higher status than emotion, and predi-
cates ethics, ethical knowledge, and ethical action on dictates of reason un-
encumbered by emotion is mistaken” (50, 111). Daniel Goleman points out

52             The Journal of Bahá’í Studies 17. 1/4. 2007

that the conjunction of mind and heart “turns the old understanding of the
tension between reason and feeling on its head. . . . The old paradigm held
an ideal of reason freed of the pull of emotion. The new paradigm urges us
to harmonize head and heart” (28–29).

Opening up new directions in the study of care ethics, Nel Noddings
advocates the shift in human understanding and interaction that combines
mind and heart: “At times we must suspend [rational-objective thinking]
in favor of subjective thinking and reflection, allowing time and space for
seeing and feeling” (26). Feminist philosophers have continued this critique,
arguing the androcentrism of the primacy of the mind and the dangers of
cold science that Mary Shelley warned us of in her novel Frankenstein: “The
enlarged sense of objectivity that took hold in the nineteenth century, em-
bracing not only freedom from theoretical bias but also a complete elimina-
tion of the personal and of the emotional” led to the problematic applica-
tion of “the methodological and epistemological criteria of the physical
sciences” towards other arenas of understanding in a mimesis that was, at
best, strictly limited by its ratiocinative boundaries and, at worse, alto-
gether spurious in its reasoning and conclusions (Daston 58; Code 31).

Bahá’u’lláh states that this process of sacred conversive communications
is especially important for artists and scholars: “The source of crafts, sci-
ences and arts is the power of reflection. Make ye every effort that out of
this ideal mine there may gleam forth such pearls of wisdom and utter-
ance as will promote the well-being and harmony of all the kindreds of
the earth” (Tablets 72). Louis J. Bourgeois, the architect who designed the
Bahá’í House of Worship near Chicago, confirms the Bahá’í teachings on
spiritual inspiration, stating that “musicians, artists, poets receive their in-
spiration from another realm” (qtd. in Shoghi Effendi, God Passes By 351).
Goody refers to this as “spiritual knowledge . . . that comes from beyond
the human universe, directly from spiritual agencies” (“Alternative Paths”
204, 208). In an earlier era or within more conversively attuned cultures,
such statements would have been understood as emblematic of the knowl-
edge of prophets, poets, and wise elders, but now within the constraints
of our more fast paced and increasingly superficial textual cultures, the
very process of conversive relations and their role in the well-being of per-
sons, families, communities, and the world as a whole need to be affirmed,

explained, modeled, and advanced. Communications methods that would
have been much more familiar and, often, implicit common knowledge for
religious adherents of those earlier dispensations emergent within oral tra-
ditions are foreign to those epistemologies bounded by ratiocinative logic.

Bahá’í Consultation
Beyond the personal and communal applications of conversive communi-
cations within the sacred practices of prayer and meditation, Bahá’u’lláh
specifies, explains, and advocates a particular form of conversive commu-
nications for group deliberations. As delineated in the Bahá’í teachings,
consultation is a spiritualized means of collaborative communications that
is designed to produce distinctively strong solutions18 for situations and
problems. As demonstrated in the process of brainstorming, multiple ideas
are generated. As evidenced in dialogue, multiple voices are heard. As in-
tended in committee, project team, and task force meetings, individuals
work together towards specific organization ends. However, what the pro-
cess of Bahá’í consultation can offer each of these communications pro-
cesses is that it is neither limited by logically ratiocinative, op/positionally
heteroglossic, nor discursively logocentric bounds. Rigorous informational
inquiry and logical reasoning are presumed, but Bahá’í consultation goes
further, being defined in terms of its egalitarian and respectful intersubjec-
tivity that establishes a sense of community and collaboration and which
values the diversity of its viewpoints, a prayerful openness of heart and
mind that enables the consideration of diverse possibilities, and deep em-
pathic thought that combines the use of mind and heart.

Centered in the guiding force of the sacred, Bahá’í consultation unites all
participants as coequal participants (like the points of a circle). Individu-
als are to speak from their hearts with thoughtfully considered ideas that
they offer to the group. Personal subjectivity, egocentric positioning, and
dialogic opposition are absent in this process, for each lets go of his or her
ideas once they are articulated for the group’s deliberations. As ‘Abdul-Bahá
explained in a talk given in 1912 in Chicago, a diversity of views is to be
welcomed, but “He who expresses an opinion should not voice it as correct
and right but set it forth as a contribution to the consensus of opinion, for

54             The Journal of Bahá’í Studies 17. 1/4. 2007

the light of reality becomes apparent when two opinions coincide. A spark
is produced when flint and steel come together. Man should weigh his
opinions with the utmost serenity, calmness and composure” (Promulgation
72). What is intended is a clash of diverse ideas, not a clash of persons;
once shared with others, an idea is no longer one’s own, but a given part
of the group’s consultative process. Each person’s articulated offering is
presented as a gift to the others who, when not speaking, are to receive that
gift graciously by listening deeply, utilizing periods of silent meditation
to engage the offered ideas both thoughtfully and empathically: “Before
expressing his own views he should carefully consider the views already
advanced by others. If he finds that a previously expressed opinion is more
true and worthy, he should accept it immediately and not willfully hold to
an opinion of his own” (Promulgation 72). In contrast to argument, debate,
or even dialogue, the Bahá’í concept of consultation requires a spiritualized
sharing of ideas in which each articulation is received as a gift, with respect
and appreciative consideration (‘Abdu’l-Bahá, Bahá’í World Faith 406–7).

Crucial to the consultative process is communication that is informed by
the sacred, infused with a conversive depth, and aimed towards real world
benefits: “Moreover words and utterances should be both impressive and
penetrating. However, no word will be infused with these two qualities
unless it be uttered wholly for the sake of God and with due regard unto
the exigencies of the occasion and the people” (Tablets 172). Bahá’u’lláh
reiterates this theme in the Lawh-i-Siyyid-i-Mihdíy-i-Dahají, emphasiz-
ing that “Utterance must needs possess penetrating power” (Tablets 198).
Individuals are to speak from their hearts with language and thoughts
informed by both mind and heart; listeners, too, are to be active listeners,
listening deeply, empathically, wisely. The guidance of prayer and scripture
is interwoven in the consultative process to continually reorient the de-
liberations through their sacred center: “spiritual conference and not the
mere voicing of personal views is intended” (‘Abdu’l-Bahá, Promulgation
72). ‘Abdul-Bahá makes it very clear that what is most important for Bahá’í
consultation is to achieve a sense of harmony and unity among those who
consult together. The extent to which they can come together in commu-
nity is the extent to which the deliberations will be successful: “Therefore
true consultation is spiritual conference in the attitude and atmosphere of

love. Members must love each other in the spirit of fellowship in order that
good results may be forthcoming. Love and fellowship are the foundation”
(Promulgation 72–73).

This is not a new communications process for humankind; aspects of
consultation, as advocated and described by Bahá’u’lláh and ‘Abdul-Bahá,
have been evidenced throughout time by the various peoples of the world.
As this essay notes, the sacred scriptures of the diverse religions of the
world have prescribed communications processes that place the sacred
at the center of human interactions whether verbal or behavioral. Many
of the indigenous peoples and tribes and national parliaments and sen-
ates still practice vestiges of this time honored practice of the consultative
gathering, albeit the predominantly divisive and combative discourse that
infuses so much of governmental, community, and business meetings these
days is seemingly all-pervasive. What makes the Bahá’í mandated practice
of consultation fundamentally new are its conjunctive emphasis on com-
munal unity that preserves its integral diversity, its broader orientation
that imbues an ecosystemic world mindedness as definitially interwoven
with the well-being of its smaller units (e.g., regions, nations, organiza-
tions, institutions, families, and persons), the rhetorical changes evidenced
in the societal conditions of a textualized planet, and the concomitant ne-
cessity for the consultative process to be not only explicitly advocated but
expressly delineated and explained.

Today, in an age defined in terms of the widespread electronic dissemina-
tion of information combined with powerful attempts to mediate and con-
trol its access,19 the Bahá’í writings provide extensive and repeated guidance
regarding the principles and practice of consultation, noting its importance
for all meetings (regardless of constitutive level or size) in which resolu-
tions and remedies are sought. Indeed, in documents submitted as a non-
governmental organization represented at the United Nations, the Bahá’í
International Community has emphasized consultation as a crucial tool
towards addressing the range of problems befalling the world, including
the global issues of disarmament, racism, women’s rights, minority rights,
education, religious tolerance, poverty, conservation, health care, economic
and social justice, development, sustainable communities, spirituality, and
peace.20 Whereas various forms of consultation have been commonly known

56             The Journal of Bahá’í Studies 17. 1/4. 2007

and used throughout the world and across time (although often delimited
in terms of gender, age, or status), Bahá’u’lláh makes it very clear that such
communications are not to be limited according to any preconceived bias or
prejudice regarding individual persons or groups. Each person who is im-
pacted by a decision needs to have some reasonable means of contributing
to the consultation, either through representatives or directly. In light of
the twenty-first century’s socioeconomic “violence of absolute destitution”
which Glissant notes “is spreading with such lightning speed over half the
planet” (145), changes at all levels of human existence are desperately need-
ed. Bahá’u’lláh states that this will require a fundamental transformation
in human perceptions, understandings, interactions, and expression—all of
which are to be reoriented by a turn to the conversive and its inherently
relational and transformative protocol.

Conclusion
Insofar as human understanding and perception are concerned, Bahá’í
scripture advocates a progressive yet ancient heuristic that is fundamen-
tally rooted in interpersonal communications that are intersubjective and
conversive and whose explicit purpose is the strengthening of “the bonds
of affection and unity between the sons of men” (Bahá’u’lláh, qtd. in Es-
slemont 39). Throughout the Bahá’í writings, we are reminded that lan-
guage is an essential means for the coming together of peoples (in families,
villages, tribes, nations, regions, and now planetary community), but such
communications are encouraged to take the form of conversive relations
centered in thoughtful, heartfelt, spiritualized interpersonal interactions.
Recent scholarship confirms the vital role played by such communications.
As Anderson affirms, “Conversation is more than simply talking. In its full-
est sense it can be thought of as the very essence of our existence” (111).

Even though the religions of the world are largely text-based in their
religious scriptures, the Bahá’í writings and the other sacred scriptures
manifest the very process in their literary structures which evince conver-
sive signs for reader engagement. Literary strategies that are conversively
crafted give these texts their co-creative capacities: for example, voice shifts
to an inclusive first person plural “we” or to a second person direct address,

interactive interrogatives, line and text breaks that simulate oral silence
for response, episodic and associational structures with meaningfulness
requisite upon listener-reader effort. In fact, the distinctions between the
written and the oral, the discursive and the conversive have always been
more of a continuum with elements of the one often interwoven with the
other. As Goody asserts, “The interface between the oral and the written
is always a complex matter” (Power 12). Referencing the sacred scriptures
of both western and eastern religious traditions, Goody further notes that
“there is a constant dialectic between written and oral activities” (Inter-
face xiv). In the religious dispensation of Islam, the Prophet Muhammad
called on his followers to read;21 today Bahá’u’lláh calls on the people of
the world to chant, sing, recite, speak and pray out loud, “Say! . . .”22 For a
world increasingly structured within and mediated by its textual bounds,
Bahá’u’lláh offers us extensive guidance for transforming our prayers and
meditations into “conversations with God” and our everyday interpersonal
communications into spiritualized and deeply transforming interactions
(qtd. in Esslemont 88).

Coming into global community is now far from a luxury or choice but a
crucial necessity for the well-being of all. Conversive communications, as
delineated in the Bahá’í writings, offer integrative means for interweaving
the torn fabric of a planet whose peoples suffer under the centuries’ old
weight of empire building divides. The historical legacies of conquest and
distrust have disempowered and disenfranchised the many through colo-
nialist alterities of indigeneity, economic hierarchies of power, geographic
demographies of diaspora, and the unequal accessibility to information
technology, traditional communication networks and the production of
knowledge. The connective and restorative powers of the conversive have
been part of sacred and religious traditions throughout time with conver-
sive communications at their sacred oral centers. Bahá’u’lláh articulates
this process for our contemporary discursive and textual worlds, calling
on us all to remember conversive relations in our individual, familial, trib-
al, regional, and global communications. Intersubjective relations across
worlds, the transforming power of conversive utterance, diverse ways of
knowing, reason, mindfulness, silence, contemplation, heartfelt thought,
inspiration, understanding, listening and responding, conversation with

58              The Journal of Bahá’í Studies 17. 1/4. 2007

God, love, unity, empathy, community, and ever-advancing human civili-
zations and cultures—all this is what conversive communication is about
and what it has been throughout the history of human existence (both
in its presence and in its all too palpable absences). Commenting specifi-
cally on its implications for anthropology and other social science meth-
odology, Attinasi and Mannheim state that such “life-changing dialogue
[which] makes us go beyond the conventional parameters, paradigms, and
perimeters of social science, could lead us to valuable truths about human
interrelations” (51). Insofar as attention to conversive relations provides
the language and lens for new directions in scriptural analysis and en-
gagement, the conversive turn in Bahá’í scripture guides our way beyond
the discursive oral/textual divide and towards conversive investigations
and conversive communications: communications that are intersubjective,
personally transforming, rooted within the sacred, and constitutive of the
globally restorative and integrally unifying directions for an evolving and
diverse world civilization.

Notes
1. For an earlier introduction to conversive communications—specifically as it
relates to Bahá’í scholarship, please see my prior essay “Conversive Relationality
in Bahá’í Scholarship: Centering the Sacred and Decentering the Self.” The Journal
of Bahá’í Studies 7.2 (1995): 1–28.

2. Much written literature demonstrates conversive literary forms, especially in
the more oral genres of poetry and drama. For a more complete analysis of con-
versive literary structures, see my 1998 volume Contemporary American Indian Lit-
eratures and the Oral Tradition (Tucson: University of Arizona Press, 1999). Also,
Native writer Leslie Marmon Silko’s remarkable collection Storyteller includes
many oral stories presented on paper in ways that exemplify aspects of the stories’
conversive orality. This can also be seen in Simon J. Ortiz’s volume A Good Journey
in which he, too, expressly strove to convey in his writing the conversive orality
of his Acoma Pueblo people.

3. Regardless of its mode of delivery, the conversive can be understood through
the geometric heuristic of a circle where centripetal relations are manifested in the
inclusive integrity of the whole and the egalitarian nature of the equivalent, yet

differentiable points on the circle; in contrast, discursive relations can be visual-
ized geometrically in the endpoints that define a line segment by their distance,
primacy, and op/positionality. The center of the circle defines the extent of the
circle’s inclusive range: where that center is fixed in the sacred, the circle is wholly
inclusive of creation.

4. Although the larger divides of empire-building agendas as manifested in
geographic conquest demonstrate the exclusionary directionality of communica-
tions, analogous divides are evident in the hierarchies of race, class, gender, age,
continent, hemisphere, etc. Cartographic lines divide geographies; discursive lines
divide people linguistically, informationally, epistemologically, educationally, eco-
nomically, medically, and relationally.

5. Indeed, Bahá’u’lláh affirms the validity of sacred oral traditions regardless
of their absence of religious scripture or other written documentation: “And now
regarding thy question, ‘How is it that no records are to be found concerning the
Prophets that have preceded Adam, the Father of Mankind, or of the kings that
lived in the days of those Prophets?’ Know thou that the absence of any reference
to them is no proof that they did not actually exist. That no records concerning
them are now available, should be attributed to their extreme remoteness, as well
as to the vast changes which the earth hath undergone since their time” (Gleanings
172).

6. For extensive documentation of “the relationship between the institutional-
ization of English . . . and the exercise of colonial power, between the processes of
curricular selection and the impulse to dominate and control,” see Gauri Viswana-
than’s powerful volume Masks of Conquest: Literary Study in British Rule (New York:
Columbia University Press, 1989).

7. French Caribbean theorist and writer Édouard Glissant laments the divi-
siveness of the contemporary world where the bonds of relationship are shifting
and tenuous, noting those ties of earlier eras that are insufficient to bring people
together in equal and harmonious relations. He advocates a “Poetics of Relation,
in which each and every identity is extended through a relationship with the
Other” so that no one remains as a distanced, marginalized, or devalued “other”
(11). Looking back at the classic stories of antiquity, “the great founding books of
communities, the Old Testament, the Iliad, the Odyssey, the Chanson de Geste, the
Icelandic Sagas, the Aeneid, or the African epics,” Glissant says that these “collec-
tive books concerning the sacred and the notion of history” for their respective

60              The Journal of Bahá’í Studies 17. 1/4. 2007

cultures and times exemplify what is needed today—namely “a similar dialectics of
rerouting . . . a modern form of the sacred . . . a Poetics of Relation” (15, 16).

8. Here, the term “Book” refers to the sacred scripture as a whole, to the Word
of God as manifested in writing. The Book of God here is used more broadly than
the denotation of one specific text of Revelation such as the Bible or the Qur’án.
Whereas the revelation of the Bahá’í Faith is in written form, the sacred scripture
of the Bahá’í Faith encompasses a vast number of sacred Books, Tablets, Letters,
and Laws.

9. For developed discussions of the intersubjective relationality that is possible
in interspecies communications, see James R. Holmes’ essay “The Status of Per-
sons or Who Was that Masked Metaphor” (Advances in Descriptive Psychology 6
[1991]: 15–35) and my volume American Indian Literatures and the Oral Tradition.
Descriptive psychologist Holmes points out that “paradigmatically, a person is an
individual whose history is a history of deliberate action. . . . Up to the present
time, we have recognized as persons only those individuals who have the embodi-
ment of homo sapiens, namely human beings. There is however, nothing about
the concept of a person that requires persons to be human beings” (29–30). Not-
ing indigenous traditions regarding human and nonhuman relationality, Rodney
Frey writes that among the Crow Indian people, “natural phenomena are animated
with volition, addressed with kinship terms. . . . The human, natural, and spiritual
worlds are intimately linked, interdependent each with the other” (131). Laguna
Pueblo writer Leslie Marmon Silko confirms this in her own tribe’s beliefs and
experience: “A rock has being or spirit, although we may not understand it. The
spirit may differ from the spirit we know in animals or plants or in ourselves. In
the end we all originate from the depths of the earth. Perhaps this is how all beings
share in the spirit of the Creator.” (“Landscape” 84).

10. Whereas the conversive process has been part of all cultures, its manifesta-
tions have varied as cultures become more or less diverse, more or less secular,
more or less literate. As the geographies of communication broaden to encompass
the global village, the method of the conversive can no longer depend upon com-
monalities such as tradition, language, religion, ethnicity, culture, or gender. The
challenges of integrative communications are therefore that much more challeng-
ing and that much more needed.

11. From a recently translated passage from the Báb’s Tafsír-i-Hadíth-i-Man
‘Arafa Nafsah faqad ‘Arafa Rabbah, the relationship between a person’s tongue and

heart is given great weight: “for verily utterance is a manifestation of the reality
of the one who uttereth, and a mirror that reflecteth that which is in his heart”
(qtd. in Saiedi 63).

12. The term “heteroglossia” refers to those communications where there is a
diversity of voices or tongues. Used primarily in the fields of cultural studies in the
humanities and social sciences, the term emphasizes the diversity of groups and
persons as manifested in speech, writing, and other forms of articulation.

13. In Saiedi’s volume on the writings of the Báb, he provides a very helpful
presentation of the “modes of revelation” as delineated by the Báb. The sacred
conversations between God and His Prophets are evident in the two modes of
“divine verses (áyát)” where God speaks directly to His Emissaries and, thereby,
to humankind and, conversely, the “prayers and supplications (munáját, ad’íyih)”
where the Báb speaks to the divine (Saiedi 40–45).

14. Within the realm of Native American literatures, Leslie Marmon Silko’s col-
lection Storyteller and Dennis Tedlock’s volume The Spoken Word and the Work of
Interpretation provide valuable models for the effective textual layout of such orally
informed texts; also Brill de Ramírez (1999).

15. The textual mediation of orally informed religious texts can be an impedi-
ment for readers’ conversive engagements with scripture when the words are laid
out in a prose paragraph format without sufficient punctuation, line breaks, page
breaks, and font changes needed to convey the conversivity of the original.

16. The larger context in which this passage occurs can be seen in a larger por-
tion of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s talk, which includes the following:

The highest of created beings fighting to obtain the lowest form of matter,
> earth! Land belongs not to one people, but to all people. This earth is not man’s
home, but his tomb. It is for their tombs these men are fighting. . . .

But war is made for the satisfaction of men’s ambition; for the sake of worldly
> gain to the few, terrible misery is brought to numberless homes, breaking the
> hearts of hundreds of men and women! How many widows mourn their hus-
> bands, how many stories of savage cruelty do we hear! How many little or-
> phaned children are crying for their dead fathers, how many women are weep-
> ing for their slain sons! There is nothing so heart-breaking and terrible as an
outburst of human savagery!

I charge you all that each one of you concentrate all the thoughts of your
heart on love and unity. When a thought of war comes, oppose it by a stronger
62              The Journal of Bahá’í Studies 17. 1/4. 2007

> thought of peace. A thought of hatred must be destroyed by a more powerful
> thought of love. . . . Do not think the peace of the world an ideal impossible to
> attain! Nothing is impossible to the Divine Benevolence of God. If you desire
> with all your heart, friendship with every race on earth, your thought, spiritual
> and positive, will spread; it will become the desire of others, growing stronger
> and stronger, until it reaches the minds of all men. (Paris Talks 28–30)
> 17. Knowledge that is accordingly rooted in the sacred is not limited to the
domain of religious study. Spiritualized knowledge can be directed in temporal
directions as in the case of ethically informed scientific study or towards explic-
itly religious ends in interpersonally transformative interpretations of scripture.
Also, the study of religion can take a strictly ratiocinative approach that is largely
(or even wholly) uninformed by the sacred depths of spiritualized intersubjective
relations. The orientation of knowledge production (whether explicitly secular or
religious) is a categorically different determination from the extent to which that
study is informed in more or less spiritual or worldly degrees. Insofar as science is
concerned, in no wise is the Bahá’í mandate for spiritualized knowledge a deroga-
tion of scientific study, rather it is a call for its spiritualized reorientation.

18. The concept of strong solutions here conveys the sense of particularly effec-
tive and efficacious solutions that arise from the conversive process of consultative
deliberations. While not necessarily the ideal solutions, strong solutions are rooted
in the exigencies of the situation and offer distinctively empathic options that take
into account the larger consequents (e.g., all who are necessarily or potentially af-
fected, including both the human and the larger environmental effects, as well as
current and future outcomes). The strength of strong solutions lies in their narrow
and broad, short-term and long-term benefits to persons, communities and the
world as a whole.

19. See Rampton and Sheldon for a critical exposé of the excesses in the control
and bias of knowledge production as evidenced in twentieth and early twenty-first
century news media.
