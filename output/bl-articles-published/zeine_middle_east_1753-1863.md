       T h e B ahá’í Faith in th e A r a bic
Speaking Middl e East
P a r t 1 ( 1 7 5 3- 1 8 6 3 )

by Ramsey Zeine

Introduction

The population of Arab1 countries extending from the Gulf
States to the Atlantic Ocean is about 280 million people2. The few
among them who have heard about the Bahá’í Faith tend to have a
distorted view characterized by misconceptions3. In the current
environment of acrimonious accelerated change, growing open-
mindedness, interest in knowing about “the other”, and as human-
rights take on a more meaningful application, opportunities will
eventually enable Bahá’ís to publicly present a true picture of the
history and teachings of the Faith4.

Upon learning about the existence of the Bahá’í Faith, religious
communities around the world normally express an interest related
to specific issues. They want to know something about its history
and teachings. Understandably, they also tend to question the
relationship between selected verses in their own scriptures, such as
those related to finality of revelation and prophecy, with the
Revelation of Bahá’u’lláh.

In the predominantly Persian Moslem Shí’ah environment, these
issues have been addressed by the Bahá’í community which gradually
came into being about 150 years ago in Iran. As a result of the
ongoing dialogue between Bahá’ís and their Shí’ah compatriots a
considerable body of Bahá’í literature developed addressing certain
verses in the Holy Qur’án and Shí’ah traditions. Over the years a
growing segment of the Iranian population heard about the Faith
from authorities and clergy, albeit in a heavily distorted manner,
often as a result of widely publicized waves of persecution. As a
result, one of the major challenges facing Persian Bahá’ís is to
simultaneously correct widely spread misconceptions and to present a
comprehensive true picture of the teachings and history of the
Bahá’í Faith.

In the predominantly Arab Moslem Sunni environment, the same
challenges related to certain verses of the Qur’án and tradition
exist, but in some instances they need to be addressed from a Sunni
perspective. A body of Bahá’í literature in Arabic developed over

262        The Báb and Bahá’u’lláh

the years    for this purpose5. However in Arab lands additional
challenges   may well face those who would set out to provide a true
picture of   the Cause and to correct misconceptions. One of these
challenges   could be an incorrect perception of the identity of the
Faith.

Occasionally, during dialogue, Moslems of Arab culture question
the origin of the Bahá’í Faith. It is understandable that Moslems in
general, especially those of Arabic culture, have a great love for the
Arabic Language, the fact that the Qur'án is in Arabic and that the
Prophet Mu˙ammad (peace be upon him) was an Arab6. With its
origins in the Bábí religion in Persia, the Bahá’í Faith may be
misconstrued from an Arab perspective as being a ‘foreign Persian'
religion. This would constitutes for some a divide between the Arabs
and the Bahá’í Faith. It is therefore a formidable challenge to be
addressed.

In an effort to address this possible misconception and generate
an environment where constructive dialogue prevails, this paper
proposes presenting the history of the Faith with the intent of
identifying commonalities that are of interest to Arabs. The premise
of this paper suggests that by highlighting certain historical facts,
the Faith will be seen in a light which is neither foreign nor distant
from that which is of value to people of Arabic culture.

The focus of this paper on matters of interest to people of Arab
culture may create an impression of bias towards giving the Bahá’í
Faith some level of Arab identity. To avoid this impression, it is
important to keep in mind the points mentioned below concerning
the supra-national identity of world religions, as well as the
contributions of peoples amongst whom they first appeared.
1\. Bahá’u’lláh identifies the Faith He heralds as “. . . the

> changeless Faith of God, eternal in the past, eternal in the
> future.” (GWB 136) Sacred texts of other religions also affirm
> the changeless eternal aspect of the Cause of God.7 Therefore
> identities of origin, whenever mentioned, should be seen
> simply as pointers to a launching stage in the unfolding
> destiny of the “changeless Faith of God ”. In its essence,
> religion transcends the identity of geography, nationality and
> people. The fact that God reveals the various stages of His
> Changeless Faith through chosen Individuals, at certain times,
> in certain geographical locations, amongst certain people,
> does not imply that a religion belongs to — is owned by -
> those people and is limited to its geographical location. Thus
> for example, Islam, born in Arabia, is not an Arab religion; It
is universal.

2\. During His lifetime and multiple exiles, Bahá’u’lláh dwelt

> amongst Persians, Arabs, Kurds and Turks, and interacted
> with peoples of Zoroastrian, Jewish, Christian and Moslem
> religions. A comprehensive balanced history of the Faith
> would need to highlight matters of importance related to the
> interactions of Bahá’u’lláh with these ethnic identities and
> religions.
3\. In the same way that early Christian believers arose from the

> shores of Galilee, and early Moslem believers arose from the
> tribe of Quraysh, early Bahá’í believers arose from Iran.
> Common factors shared between such early believers include
> the fact that they had to simultaneously face the brunt of
> persecution while striving to spread their new Faiths. The
> sacrificial contribution of the Persian Bahá’ís is unequaled in
> Bahá’í history. The tribulations, often blood-drenched, they
> suffered have not abated since the inception of the Faith
> over a century and a half ago. Among the accolades of
> distinction born by the Persian Bahá’í community are the
> following:
•   With all due admiration and respect for pioneers from a

> number of countries, during the first Bahá’í century, the
> Bahá’ís of Iran were by far the ones who left their country
> in relatively considerable numbers to spread the Message
> of Bahá’u’lláh in many lands. As such, they have a most
> outstanding record of pioneering around the world.
•   They continue to be the most developed Bahá’í

community despite the continuous challenges they face.8
Nevertheless, neither the Persian Bahá’ís, nor their fellow
believers, nor in fact any serious student of religion can, in the light
of the teachings of the Faith and Its world-wide spread, consider It
as either belonging to Iran, or of being a Persian religion. Similarly,
facts of interest to Arabs, or to any of the several other cultures
within which the Faith grew, are not in any way intended to give any
identity to the changeless Faith of God. Rather, such facts, as they
gradually come to light through research, serve to reinforce the
concept that from the very beginning, the Bahá’í Faith had a broad
multi-national, multi-cultural foundation.

With this understanding, we return to the focus of this paper
which touches briefly on a few occurrences within a limited early
period of history (1753-1863), and which are of interest to people
of Arab culture. More research is needed across a longer period9 to
uncover important milestones of the Cause in the Arabic speaking
Middle East. Consequently, this paper puts out an appeal to scholars
who understand the needs of this critical time of upheaval and

264         The Báb and Bahá’u’lláh

change, and who are far more professionally qualified than the
author, to arise and shoulder the responsibility of uncovering
milestones of bonding value between Arabs and the Revelation of
Bahá’u’lláh.

Subjects of interest to Arabs are outlined under the following
main headings: Matters of Identity; Early Arab believers; Bahá’u’lláh
- Milestones in Arab Lands, and Surat Al-A‘ráb,10 a Tablet revealed
by Bahá’u’lláh in the prison of ‘Akká, addressed to Arab believers in
Baghdad and its surroundings. It is with sincere appreciation that I
offer my gratitude to a distinguished Persian Bahá’í friend, who
pointed out the importance of researching matters relating the
Bahá’í Faith to peoples of Arab culture, and inspired this humble
research effort.

Matters of Identity
Shaykh Ahmad-i-Ahsá’í

Shaykh Ahmad-i-Ahsá’í (1753-1831) is identified in the Kitáb-i-
Aqdas as the one “ ...who was the founder of the Shaykhi School and
the first of the ‘twin luminaries that heralded the advent of the
Faith of the Báb.’” (KA Note 171, p. 239)

Shoghi Effendi11, quoting A.L.M. Nicolas, lists the genealogy of
Shaykh Ahmad-i-Ahsá’í. It consists of a series of Arab names.

> His genealogy, according to his son Shaykh Abdu’lláh, is
> the following: “Shaykh Ahmad-ibn-i-Zaynu'd-Din-ibn-i-
> Ibrahim-ibn-i-Sakhr-ibn-i-Ibrahim-ibn-i-Zahir-ibn-i-
> Ramadan-ibn-i-Rashid-ibn-i-Dahim-ibn-i-Shimrukh-ibn-i-
> Sulih.” (Essai sur le Shaykhisme, p. 1)
In another note from the same source, we have the birthplace of
Shaykh Ahmad, as well as the origin of his religious persuasion.
“Born Rajab, 1166 A.H., 24th of April-24th of May, 1753, in (the)
town of Ahsa in district of Ahsa, northeast of Arabian peninsula.”
(Essai sur le Shaykhisme 1) “Born a Shi’ah, though his ancestors were
Sunnis.” (Ibid., 2)
Hand of the Cause of God Óasan Balyuzi, identifies the Arab tribe
of Sheikh Ahmad.

> Shaykh Ahmad-i-Ahsá’í . . . the founder of the Shaykhi
> school, belonged to the ancient tribe of Banu-Sakhr, and
> his family originated from the region of Ahsa on the
> Arabian mainland. His father's name was Shaykh Zayni'd-
Din, and Bahrayn had been their home.12

Lights of ‘Irfán Book Seven        265

In other words, Shaykh Ahmad-i-Ahsá’í, the first individual to
herald the dawn of the new Revelation, was an Arab from the
ancient Arab tribe of Banu-Sakhr, as can be further observe from his
name, Ahsá’í. He arose from Al-Ahsa’ Northeast of the Arabian
Peninsula, an Arab territory within the Ottoman Empire, and
proceeded to commence his mission in another Arab part of the
Empire, Najaf and Karbala13 in Iraq.

The Báb
Historic identity by descent

The Báb was born in Shiraz and therefore had a Persian identity
by birth. However, Mr. Balyuzi informs us of His historic identity.

> Siyyid (or Mírzá) 'Alí-Mu˙ammad, known to history as the
> Báb, was the son of Siyyid (or Mir) Mu˙ammad-Rida, a
> mercer of Shiraz. He was born on October 20th 1819
> (Muharram 1st, 1235 A.H.). Through both His father and
> His mother He was descended from Imam Óusayn the third
> Imam.14 Thus He stood in direct line of descent from the
> Prophet Mu˙ammad.15

“This Arabian Youth”

The Báb mentions His historic identity in His Writings by
referring to Himself on occasion as “This Arabian Youth”. For
example:

> O peoples of the earth! Give ear unto God's holy Voice
> proclaimed by this Arabian Youth Whom the Almighty
> hath graciously chosen for His Own Self. He is indeed
> none other than the True One, Whom God hath entrusted
> with this Mission from the midst of the Burning Bush.

(SWB 50)
It should be noted that the Báb also referred to Himself as Persian
Youth. In an epistle sent to Mu˙ammad Shah from Bushihr, the Báb
wrote (provisional translation) “Know thou O King that I am a
Persian Youth (Fata A’jamii) from the merchant class ...” 16

First Action — Pilgrimage to Mecca

The first formal action the Báb undertook after declaring His
mission and receiving a letter from Mullá Óusayn, was a pilgrimage
to Mecca17. There, in the heartland of both Islam and the Arab
world, He, in an Epistle conveyed by Quddus, called upon the Sherif
of Mecca to embrace the truth of the new Revelation.

266         The Báb and Bahá’u’lláh

Writings in Arabic

The first Tablet revealed by the Báb on the eve of His
declaration to Mullá Óusayn, the Súrih of Muluk, was in Arabic. It
is the first chapter of “the Qayyum-i-Asma', His celebrated
commentary on the Surih of Joseph, revealed in the first year of His
Mission, and characterized by Bahá'u'lláh as ‘the first, the greatest,
and mightiest of all books’ in the Bábí Dispensation . . . ” (PDC 27) A
considerable volume of the Writings of the Báb is in Arabic,
including another major work known as the “Arabic Bayán”.

In brief, the Báb, a Manifestation of God and forerunner of
Bahá’u’lláh, was of Persian origin by birth and of Arab historic
origin by descent from the House of the Prophet Mu˙ammad, peace
be upon Him. His revealed Word was both in the Persian and Arabic
languages, and He, in some Tablets, referred to Himself as “This
Arabian Youth”. The first mission He undertook was to Mecca, the
heartland of Islam and the Arab world.

Early Arab Believers
Fruits of the Steadfastness of Mullá Alí Bastámí

After the Báb declared His Revelation to the Letters of the
Living, and instructed Mullá Óusayn to proceed on a mission which
eventually brought him into indirect contact with Bahá’u’lláh, Nabil,
in his “The Dawn-Breakers”, informs us that:

> The Báb then summoned to His presence Mullá Alíy-i-
> Bastámí, and addressed to him words of cheer and loving-
> kindness. He instructed him to proceed directly to Najaf
> and Karbila, alluded to the severe trials and afflictions that
> would befall him, and enjoined him to be steadfast till the
> end. "Your faith," He told him, "must be immovable as the
> rock, must weather every storm and survive every calamity.
> Suffer not the denunciations of the foolish and the
> calumnies of the clergy to afflict you, or to turn you from
> your purpose. For you are called to partake of the celestial
> banquet prepared for you in the immortal Realm. You are
> the first to leave the House of God, and to suffer for His
> sake. If you be slain in His path, remember that great will
> be your reward, and goodly the gift which will be bestowed
> upon you. (DB 85)
After a series of further developments, we read,

> Mullá Alíy-i-Bastámí, though the first to fall a victim to
> the relentless hate of the enemy, underwent his persecution
in Iraq, which lay beyond the confines of Persia. (DB 146)

Lights of ‘Irfán Book Seven        267

Shaykh Mu˙ammad-i-Shibl

When Mullá Alíy-i-Bastámí was imprisoned in Baghdad, the
governor appointed a number of clergy to study his case. One of
them was an Arab named Shaykh Mu˙ammad Shibl. Hand of the
Cause Mr. Óasan Balyuzi provides two outstanding facts, one
relating Mu˙ammad Shibl to the Shaykhi movement through Siyyid
Kazim-i-Rashti the successor of Shaykh Ahmad Ahsá’í. The other is
about Mu˙ammad Shibl himself, embracing the Faith of Mullá
'Alíy-i-Bastámí, the investigated. Balyuzi wrote:

> . . . Shaykh Mu˙ammad Shibl, was a distinguished follower
> of the Shaykhi leader, Siyyid Kazim-i-Rashti, and was
> indeed his personal representative in Baghdad . . . When
> Mullá 'Alíy-i-Bastámí, the Letter of the Living, was
> brought to Baghdad and imprisoned, Shaykh Mu˙ammad
> Shibl visited him in prison, learnt of the claim of the Báb
> and became a believer.18
A fourth generation descendent of Shaykh Mu˙ammad Shibl,
Dr. Kamran Ekbal, provides this interesting insight which puts a
time scale on the period of investigation.

> Shaykh Mu˙ammad Shibl was among the group of Ulama
> who, in accordance with an order issued by Najeeb Pasha,
> the Vali of Baghdad, were present during the three month
> period of the trial of Mullá ‘Alíy-i-Bastámí. 19

Shaykh Mu˙ammad Shibl was therefore either the first, or amongst
the first, Arabs to believe in the Báb. He served the Faith with
devotion and fortitude. Dr. Ekbal provides a comment of historic
importance to women’s liberation, involving the cooperation of a
Persian believer with an Arab believer. He writes

> At the home of Shaykh Mu˙ammad Shibl in Baghdad, long
> before the conference of Badasht, Qurrat Al-‘Ain used to
> appear without a veil and address her students. Some of the
> students complained to the Báb. The Báb, in one of His
> Tablets, gave her the title of ˇahirih.20

Mírzá Mu˙ammad Mustafa Baghdadi

Mírzá Mu˙ammad Mustafa Baghdadi was the son of Shaykh
Mu˙ammad Shibl. Mr. Balyuzi provides us with a synopsis of his
life:

> . . . Mírzá Mustafa, who was born in Baghdad in about
> 1837. During the period that Bahá'u'lláh was in Baghdad,
> Mírzá Mustafa became devoted to Him, although, of
course, Bahá'u'lláh had not put forward a claim at this

268          The Báb and Bahá’u’lláh

> time. In 1874 Mírzá Mustafa was arrested along with many
> others of the Bahá'ís of Baghdad, and after this he
> travelled to 'Akká and sought permission from Bahá'u'lláh
> to live in the vicinity of that city. Bahá'u'lláh instructed
> him to take up his residence in Beirut where he was
> frequently of service to those Bahá'ís travelling to 'Akká.
> After the ascension of Bahá'u'lláh, he moved to
> Alexandretta (Iskandarun), where he died in 1910.21
The love of Bahá’u’lláh and ‘Abdu’l-Bahá for Mírzá Mu˙ammad
Mustafa Baghdadi, and the magnitude of his services to the Faith
can be appreciated by the fact that, as Dr Ekbal explains, he “was
the recipient of more than 150 Tablets revealed for him by
Bahá’u’lláh, and 250 Tablets revealed by ‘Abdu’l-Bahá.”22 Dr. Ekbal
believes that “ . . . Mu˙ammad Mustafa was probably the recipient of
the highest number of Tablets, both from Bahá’u’lláh and ‘Abdu’l-
Bahá.”

It is therefore no wonder that ‘Abdu’l-Bahá immortalized
Mu˙ammad Mustafa in His “Memorials of the Faithful”. (MF 130)
He described him as being a “Blazing Light ...The hostile were afraid
to attack him”. He “attended upon Bahá’u’lláh after His return
from Kurdistan .. . he was the leader among the friends in Iraq.”23 He
“became a believer prior to the declaration of Bahá’u’lláh”.

After the ascension of Bahá’u’lláh, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá continues,
Mu˙ammad Mustafa “stood so firm against the waverers that they
dared not draw a breath. He was like a shooting star . . . Not one of
the violators so much as dared pass through the street where he lived
...” (MF 130)
Dr. Zia Baghdadi

Mr. Balyuzi mentions two of the descendants of Mohammad
Mustafa:

> Throughout his life Aqa Mu˙ammad-Mustafa served the
> Faith which he had embraced, with zeal and distinction. He
> spent many years in Beirut where he attended to the needs
> and requirements of pilgrims. His son, Aqa Óusayn Iqbal,
> did the same in subsequent years, with great devotion.
> Another son, Dr. Zia Bagdadi (Dr. Diya Baghdadi) resided
> in the United States, where his services were inestimable.24

The Gold Trowel

During the course of laying the corner stone for the House of
Worship in Wilmette,

Lights of ‘Irfán Book Seven        269

> Irene Holmes handed ‘Abdu’l-Bahá a small, gold trowel
> which she had ordered for this very purpose, and He dug
> the earth to lay the corner-stone, having chosen for this a
> fragment of rock brought by Mrs. Nettie Tobin as her
> offering. Having done so, He invited the delegates of
> various American communities to do likewise. Following
> them, 'Abdu'l-Bahá asked a number of oriental Bahá'ís

> represented Arab Bahá'ís, and Ghodsieh (Qudsiyyih)
> Khanum-i-Ashraf the Bahá’í women of the Orient. Then
> the corner-stone was laid in place.25

Sheikh Ja’afar Al-Tahhan

One of the most enduring services Sheikh Mohammad Mustafa
Baghdadi rendered to present day Lebanon26 was laying the
foundation for the establishment of a Bahá’í community in the
village of Mashghará, South of the Beka’ valley, about 80 Km
South East of Beirut. Mr. Sami Al-Tahhan, of the Bahá’ís of
Mashghará, kindly provided the author with a hand-written note on
which the following account is based:

> Sometime in the late 1880’s Sheikh Mohammad Mustafa
> Baghdadi taught the Faith to Sheikh Ja’afar Al-Tahhan in
> the town of Saida (Sidon), about 40 KM South of Beirut,
> probably giving him the distinction of being the first
> person to become a Bahá’í in what later became known as
> Lebanon. Sheikh Ja’afar, was born in 1843 to a prominent
> Shí‘ah family. He came from Iraq in 1881 and settled in
> the predominantly Shí‘ah village of Mashghará. His
> profound knowledge enabled him to become the Imam of
> Mashghará, a responsibility he carried for sometime after
> becoming a Bahá’í.
> Through Mustafa Baghdadi, Sheikh Ja’afar attained the
> presence of Bahá’u’lláh and later attained the presence of
> ‘Abdu’l-Bahá twice in Egypt.
> The strong faith of Sheikh Ja’afar enabled him to
> withstand the considerable persecution of the villagers
> who, once his Faith became known, treated him with
> hostility. His steadfastness was passed on to his three boys
> who embraced the Faith and to the fourth boy who was a
> close friend of the Faith. The children of all four boys and
their grandchildren embraced the Faith. When their

> daughters married Shi’as, their husbands also embraced the
> faith. Thus a fully Lebanese Bahá’í community gradually
> came into being. Their Spiritual Assembly was formed in
> 1967. They have their own Bahá’í cemetery. The fortitude
> of this community in withstanding abuse and boycott is a
> shining example highly admired by all who know them.
> Sheikh Ja’afar passed away in 1924 and was buried in the
> Moslem cemetery of the village. In the 1970’s, his remains,
> with the approval of the Universal House of Justice, were
> moved to the Bahá’í cemetery of Mashghará.
These few sketchy glimpses, taken as a whole, weave an Arabian-
Persian spiritual thread, arising from the desert of Arabia, flowering
in Persia, mystically unfolding across more than a century of Bahá’í
history, linking Shaykh Ahmad Ahsá’í, by the steadfastness of Mullá
Alíy-i-Bastámí, through the descendants of Mu˙ammad Shibl to a
golden trowel in the hand of Dr. Zia Baghdadi laying the foundation
stone of the Mother Temple of the West at the feet of ‘Abdu’l-
Bahá. This thread shines with the brightness of emancipation as it
touches on the impact of ˇahirih addressing an audience without a
veil in the home of Mu˙ammad Shibl. And finally, it also links
Shaykh Ahmad to the formation of a Bahá’í community in Lebanon.
Clearly far more remains to be uncovered that will acknowledge not
only the contribution of early Arab believers to the growth of the
Faith, but the fruits of the cooperation between Arab and Persian
believers.

Bahá’u’lláh - Milestones In Arab Lands
Significant Dates

Bahá’u’lláh was born in Iran to a noble Persian family with long
Persian ancestry27. However, during the whole period of His
Ministry, He was an exile and a prisoner in the Ottoman Empire.
These are some significant dates:
1817-1892        75 years. Lifetime of Bahá’u’lláh

1853-1892        39 years. The whole period of the Ministry on

> Bahá’u’lláh was outside Iran, in the Ottoman
> Empire (GPB 85)
1853-1863 10 years in Iraq, 8 of them among the predominantly

> Arabic speaking population of Baghdad29, and two
> of them among the Kurds30 in Sulaymányyih
1863-1868 5 years in Istanbul-Adrianople

1868-1892 24 years among the predominantly Arab population

of Palestine
Bahá’u’lláh spent the longest period of His Ministry in the Arabic
speaking territories of the Ottoman Empire.

The Declaration of Bahá’u’lláh - Location, First
Tablet and Its Language.

On a Wednesday afternoon, April 22, 1863, in Baghdad, an
ancient city of Arabic culture and history, when “The muezzin had
just raised the afternoon call to prayer, . . . Bahá'u'lláh entered the
Najibiyyih Garden, where He tarried twelve days before His final
departure from the city.” (GPB 148-52) “That historic day,” Shoghi
Effendi informs us, is “forever after designated as the first day of
the Ridvan Festival.” About the significance of this occasion he
writes,

> The arrival of Bahá'u'lláh in the Najibiyyih Garden,
> subsequently designated by His followers the Garden of
> Ridvan, signalizes the commencement of what has come to
> be recognized as the holiest and most significant of all
> Bahá'í festivals, the festival commemorating the
> Declaration of His Mission to His companions.

Furthermore Shoghi Effendi adds: “Of the exact circumstances
attending that epoch-making Declaration we, alas, are but scantily
informed.” He goes on to inform us that, “The ‘Suriy-i-Sabr’ (Surih
of Patience) (was) revealed on the first day of Ridvan.” The Suriy-i-
Sabr is in Arabic.

Bahá’u’lláh and the Arabic Language

The greater part of the revelation of Bahá’u’lláh is in the Arabic
Language. The introduction to the Arabic edition of the Kitáb-i-
Aqdas highlights certain implications related to choice of language
(provisional translation):

> The Kitáb-i-Aqdas was revealed completely in the Arabic
> language. The reader will not miss the implication of the
> choice of Bahá’u’lláh for Arabic to be the Language of the
> Obligatory Prayers, the language of the Mother Book of
> His Revelation, the language through which He set forth
> the foundations of the forthcoming world civilization,
> even though it was not the language of His people . . .
> Furthermore, He expressed a preference for the choice of
> Arabic as a world language to be spoken by all mankind. 31

In the introduction to the English edition of the Kitáb-i-Aqdas, we
are told that:

> Bahá’u’lláh enjoyed a superb mastery of Arabic, and
> preferred to use it in those Tablets and other Writings
> where its precision of meaning was particularly appropriate
> to the exposition of basic principle. Beyond the choice of
> language itself, however, the style employed is of an
> exalted and emotive character, immensely compelling,
> particularly to those familiar with the great literary
> tradition out of which it arose. (KA intro, p. 10)
Bahá’u’lláh expressed His preference for the Arabic language by
writing (provisional translation):

> That which is preferable to the Throne is that the entire
> world speaks the Arabic language because it is the greatest
> of all languages in its expansiveness. If the people were to
> inform themselves about the expanse of this language, they
> would undoubtedly select it. Although the Farsi language is
> very sweet, it does not have the expanse of the Arabic
> language. All languages in the world are limited in
> comparison with the Arabic Language. This is its
> distinction and the reason we have mentioned it.32
Bahá’u’lláh — “This Arabian Youth”

In several Tablets, Bahá’u’lláh refers to Himself as “ . . . this
Arabian Youth”. For example in a Tablet known as Súrih Al-Damm,
addressed to “Mu˙ammad”33, (this is a reference to the famous
chronicler and poet34, Nabil-i-Zarandi, author of the Dawn
Breakers), Bahá’u’lláh writes, (provisional translation):

> Go to Ismulláh-Há, and inform him what the Spirit of God
> hath revealed unto thee . .. Say O servant, We have revealed
> for thee Tablets and Epistles unknown to anyone except
> God. In them is that which will enable thee to be
> independent of all that was created in the realm of
> creation, and all that is in the heavens and the earth. But
> We did not send them to thee because We did not inhale
> from thee the fragrance of Those on High wafting from
> this Arabian Youth.35

A testimony of Bahá’u’lláh concerning Arabs in
Baghdad

In a Tablet addressed to Hadrat Afnan Jinab-i- Aqa Mírzá Aqa36

Bahá’u’lláh outlines several instances that highlight the level of
affection, love and respect that the population of Baghdad,
including prominent Sunni Arabs, had for Him before he left. He
wrote that when He was in Baghdad, all people including the ‘ulamá,
the ‘urfá (those with mystic knowledge), and others in Baghdad and

within its environs all the way to Basra, openly expressed the utmost
humility and submission towards him.

Bahá’u’lláh said that one day Jinab-e-Siyyed Daoud37, the mufti
of Basra, attained the honor of coming into His presence with a
group of others among them the famous Ibn-Alusi.38 They sat
outside until they received permission to come into His presence.
The Mufti told those present that the reputation of Hadrat-e-Ishan39
(a respectful reference to Bahá’u’lláh) has spread far and wide in
those regions “To the extent,” The mufti said, “that I do not think
They40 are aware how far it has gone”.

Bahá’u’lláh wrote that the Cause had reached such a station (of
respect and prominence) that whenever He would leave the house,
Arabs who saw Him would utter words (of praise) that surpassed
their description of their own leaders.

After enumerating several such instances, Bahá’u’lláh continues
His account by referring to the highly emotional time of His
departure when “crowds upon crowds of people came from the city,
including the ‘Ulama and others. All said they were confident that
He would always remain with them . . . but now suddenly He was
leaving . . . The Arabs, like the clouds of Spring, were crying and
lamenting”. (GPB 34)

Bahá’u’lláh further describes, in His Tablet to the Afnán, the
relationship He had with all types of people.

> During the period of my stay in Iraq, the Ulama, the Urafa
> and the common people of all religious denominations
> would come to us and We would answer whatever question
> they asked.

Surat Al-A‘ráb 41 — A Tablet from Bahá’u’lláh to the
Arabs

In this momentous Tablet, Surat Al-A‘ráb, addressed by
Bahá’u’lláh to the Arabs, He identifies those He is addressing by
certain criteria, calls upon them to adhere to specific injunctions,
guides them to thank God for certain reasons, exhorts them to
steadfastness as He warns them about severe tests, explains why God
chose them for Himself, informs them why they should “take pride
upon all the peoples of the Earth”, and admonishes them to acquire
a number of divine attributes. Towards the end He warns them of
dangers facing them, and describes His sufferings. Several times
throughout the Tablet, which is about 6 pages in the Arabic script,
He addresses them in such in words as, “O My Arabs!”, “O friends
of God from the Arabs”, “O Pen of the Ancient, remind Our friends
from the Arabs, whom God has chosen for Thyself ...”.

Significantly, Bahá’u’lláh follows every major statement He
makes with an explanation of its purpose and/or provides the
reasons for which He made it. It is also to be noted that the
expressions of loftiness and praise Bahá’u’lláh lavishes on the Arabs
in a sequence of phrases (here broken up into separate paragraphs),
are then tempered by conditions they need to fulfill and by his
expectation of them to acquire specific spiritual attributes. The
following provisionally translated passages constitute the first two
and a half pages of the Tablet, followed by a summary of the
remaining three pages. Subtitles and comments have been added,
and the text has been arranged and occasionally itemized for
emphasis.

Opening Words:

In the opening words of the Tablet, Bahá’u’lláh announces that it
is addressed to the Arabs.

> This is Súrih A‘ráb (the Súrih of the Arabs) which hath
> been revealed from the Ancient Revealer.
Criteria defining the Arabs addressed by Bahá’u’lláh

The source of the Tablet is mentioned in the following verses
which also makes it clear that Bahá’u’lláh is addressing Arabs who
have fulfilled certain criteria.

> These are the verses of God revealed in truth from the
> Heaven of Glory. He hath made them to be a proof from
> Himself for all the world, and in them He mentions those
> who
> • knew God in Himself and
• were not veiled by the barking of those who seek

partnership with God
> • who entered beneath the shade of his care and
> • resided in proximity to His mercy.
• Those are them upon whom the Concourse on High and

the Angels of Nearness pray.
• They are the ones who, when the Sun of Eternity shone

> upon them another time, prostrated themselves before
> God the Almighty the Omnipotent.
Calling the Arabs to Embrace His Cause:

Having identified the recipients of Súrih A‘ráb, Bahá’u’lláh calls
upon them to embrace His Cause in a series of injunctions starting

with Words such as: “Listen to the call of God . . . make haste to the
Tree of God . . . Seek ye shelter in Its shade . . . Turn ye unto It” and
“nourish yourselves from Its fruits”. He Wrote:

> O friends of God from the Arabs
• Listen to the call of God from this Tree that arose in

> truth, which every one of Its leaves declares upon all
> things, ‘Verily I am God, no God is there but Him the
> Most Holy, the Precious the Kind.’
> • O people, make haste to the Tree of God
• Seek ye shelter in Its shade. By God, were ye to search the

> heavens and the earth ye wouldst not find safety except
> under the shade of this Tree that has arisen above
> mankind and from which wafts the gentle breeze that
> infuses life into every smoldering bone.

> • Turn ye unto It and
• Nourish yourselves from Its fruits that your hearts may be

purified from the signs of every notorious beguiler.
Reasons for thanking God

Calling upon the Arabs to thank God, Bahá’u’lláh lists a number
of reasons for doing so.

> Thank ye God for
• having protected you from the wilderness of self and

passion,
• and saved you from the vain imaginings and blindness in

> the Day whence God brought the Kingdom of His might
> upon all who are in heavens and on earth,
> • and made Himself known unto you
> • and revealed to you His beauty
> • and spoke with you visibly as witnessed
> • and made you of His servants who have knowledge.

A Warning and Call to Steadfastness

Bahá’u’lláh warns His Arab friends that a grave danger is already
facing them, and exhorts them to be steadfast.

> Be ye steadfast in this Cause because Satan hath appeared
> with his soldiers and orders you in every instance to deny
God Who created you and made you of the victorious.

A Profound Pronouncement

Bahá’u’lláh then makes a profound pronouncement to the Arabs
which has overtones reverberating throughout religious history.
“God,” He says, has “chosen you for Himself”, and follows up
immediately with reasons in support of this pronouncement.

> Praise God for having chosen you for Himself, whereas
•   when the Ancient Sun set upon Its land, It rose from the

> horizon of Iraq — your land42 — this is naught but of His
> Grace upon you with which nothing in the heavens or
> upon the Earth can compare
•   and the Face of God was shining brightly amongst you

without a veil
•   reciting upon you the verses of God for many months and

years
•   and the Ancient Beauty walked amongst you with the

reverence and dignity of God
> •   revealing Himself upon you yet another time
•   thus fulfilling the grace of God upon you that ye may be

of those who are thankful.
Consequences of the Pronouncement

Emphasizing the significance of His pronouncement, Bahá’u’lláh
then instructs the Arabs to take pride upon all the tribes of the
world and explains why they should do so.

> It behooveth you to take pride upon all the tribes of the
> world inasmuch as none other than you have attained what
> ye have attained, if ye be of them who have knowledge.
Spiritual attributes

If we were to stop perusing Surat Al-A‘ráb at this point, we
might misunderstand the essence of the message of Bahá’u’lláh to
the Arabs. All that has come before can only be correctly understood
in terms of the Arabs arising to scale the spiritual pinnacles to which
Bahá’u’lláh has set before them. That is, He has clearly held out a
glorious station for the Arabs, but they can only achieve it by
fulfilling the following conditions:

> Therefore it behooveth you to
• acquire the manners of God

• that from your hearts holy fragrances will burst upon all

beings
• and from you the signs of the All-merciful God will

appear.

> • As God has chosen you from amongst his people,
• make ye an effort that from you may appear that which

> hath not appeared from others, that your being chosen by
> God will be proved amongst the people of the world.
• Be ye as the stars amongst the people of the world that

> through you those who have been veiled from the
> knowledge of God, and are of the ignorant, may be
> guided.
• Be ye trustworthy to yourselves and to the people, and

> their money, verily this is an attribute beloved by God
> before the creation of Adam from water and clay.
• But if you are not the trustworthy ones on earth, you will

> not trust your own selves neither will the people trust
> you, thus hath God advised you in the tongue of His
> Manifestation as an injunction for you and for all his
> creation.
• Purify your hearts from envy and hatred, and yourselves

from inequity and mundane desires
• Obey ye the commandments of God verily He hath not

> commanded His servants except that which is better for
> them than the treasures of heavens and earth
• Beware lest ye contend about anything created on earth

> with anyone. Leave it to its people that your souls may
> find peace and ye be entirely devoted to the face of your
> Lord the Almighty the Great.
In the remainder of the Tablet Bahá’u’lláh repeatedly addresses
His audience in such terms as, “O People . . . O My Arabs”
emphasizing some of the points already mentioned. He reiterates
themes covered in other Tablets such as God entrusts the world to
kings and wants only the hearts of His loved ones. (TB 220) He calls
upon His “friends from the Arabs”:

> O people, imbue yourselves with the attributes of God and
> shun the attributes of those who enjoin partnership with
> Him. God commands you to be chaste and pure. Hold unto
> the religion of God and do not commit inequity and vice.
> Be ye of those from whose faces the light of God is
revealed, and from whose actions the signs of God and His

> Dignity appear. Thus it beseemeth you to behave, O people
> of Bahá, in these days of great tribulation. ...

Dwelling upon His sorrows, Bahá’u’lláh provides a graphic
description of their effect upon His Body.

> O my Arabs! If you were to behold Me you would not
> know Me. From repeated tribulations My Hair has waxed
> white from Its black essence. From the onrush of adversity
> the ‘Alef’ 43 of this Cause has appeared in the shape of
> ‘Dal’ 44, and this Radiant Rosy Face has yellowed.
In closing this Tablet, Bahá’u’lláh calls upon the Arabs not to
forget Him and laments the tribulations brought upon Him by the
animosity of His half brother.

Thus it can be seen in general that Bahá’u’lláh declared His
mission and established the holiest and most significant of all Bahá'í
festivals in Baghdad an Arab territory of the Ottoman Empire, that
the first Tablet He revealed on the first day of that momentous
occasion was in Arabic, that He spent most of His Ministry in Arabic
speaking territories of the Ottoman Empire, that the largest body of
His Writings was in Arabic.

People of Arabic culture need to be invited to reflect on the
implications of the fact that “the language through which He
(Bahá’u’lláh) set forth the foundations of the forthcoming world
civilization”, was Arabic, and of His statement that “If the people
were to inform themselves about the expanse of this language, they
would undoubtedly select it.” Moreover Bahá’u’lláh’s reference to
Himself as This Arabian Youth could have several meanings, one of
them would undoubtedly be His high respect and affinity with the
Arab heritage.

All these facts combined with His own warm recollections of the
times He spent with Arabs in Iraq, the tender praiseworthy tone with
which He addressed them, and the expectations He has of them, are
bound to enkindle an understanding of a deep spiritual connection,
far more significant than cordial closeness, between Bahá’u’lláh and
the Arabs.

Closing Remarks

This paper makes a preliminary attempt to correct a distorted
view about an unfounded divide between the Bahá’í Faith and
people of Arab heritage. By focusing on matters of identity,
contributions of early Arab believers, milestones of interaction
between Bahá’u’lláh with Arabs, and a Tablet to the Arabs, it seeks

to demonstrate not only the absence of any boundaries between the
Faith and Arabs, but an intermingling of a considerable magnitude.

The need for further research covering the whole period of the
Ministries of Bahá’u’lláh and ‘Abdu’l-Bahá cannot be over
emphasized. Its aim will be to uncover a comprehensive picture of
interactions between the Faith and Arabs. Such a picture, will
undoubtedly contribute towards mitigating their misgivings about
the Faith, and will lay foundations for a greater respect and a sense
of closeness towards the Founder and His Mission. However, in
keeping with the concept of the changeless faith of God touched
upon in the Introduction, such research needs to be seen in at least
three levels.

At one level, Arabs with penetrating insight into the implication
of these milestones, will realize that they have been called to a
privileged destiny in shouldering the world-wide responsibilities of
the Bahá’í Faith.

At a higher level, Arabs and Persians may wish to reflect on their
common destiny in view of certain statements by Bahá’u’lláh, such
as those in the following quotation from a Tablet addressed to
Zaynu’l-Muqarribín, where He states:

> Convey greetings on behalf of God upon the faces of
> those Arabs and Persians who lived around His House, that
> they may rejoice in the glad tidings of the All-Merciful and
> be of those who are steadfast. Say, O friends, thank God
> for having enabled you to meet Him, and brought you nigh
> unto Himself, and informed you of that from which most
> of His servants remained veiled, and destined for you that
> which cannot be known by all of creation.45
As a footnote to the grand panorama of history, is there any
mystical significance in the fact that the first Persian believer46 to
suffer for his Faith did so on Arab land, and the first Arab believer47
to suffer for his Faith was martyred on Persian soil?

At the third and highest level, which is the essence of the true
spirit of the Faith, every believer, no matter what privilege his
culture may have received in the Bahá’í Writings, realizes that a
prime objective in Bahá’í life is to unequivocally demonstrate the
truth of the injunction of Bahá’u’lláh, “Ye are all fruits of one tree,
the leaves of one branch, the flowers of one garden.”48
