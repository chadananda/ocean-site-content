> **Abstract:**  
>   
> This paper aims to trace some of the analogies and essential differences between the concept of the "Perfect Man" (Pole) in Sufism and the Bahá'í notion of the Manifestation of God based on the Bahá'í Writings and the works of prominent Sufi scholars-theologians: At-Tirmidhí, Ibn al-'Arabí, Dáwud-al-Qaysarí, Haydar Amulí etc. What underlies both these notions is the idea that at all times the Divine Will manifests Itself to humanity through or in a certain Person, whose purpose is to be a shepherd, guardian and educator of humankind, directing it towards the good and keeping it from what is wrong.  
>   
> This idea is expressed in Sufism by the teaching about the "Muhammadan Essence" or "Muhammadan Light" (analogous to the "Logos" of Neoplatonians and the "Word" of the Christians), the first emanation from God, also going by the name of the Primal Intellect. This is the Image of God in its undifferentiated (undivided) unity, by Whom and from Whom all things were created and Which preexisted all things in creation (not in time but as a cause to the effect). This "Muhammadan Essence" is realized successively in Adam, the Prophets and the Poles each of whom is "The Perfect Man of the age." The philosophic development of this issue in the form of a doctrine is associated with the name of the great Sufi philosopher from Andalousia (Southern Spain) Ibn al-'Arabí (11651240), though clear allusions to the same idea can be traced in the work of an earlier Sufi writer—at-Tirmidhí (IX c.).  
>   
> In the Bahá'í teaching there is also a notion of the Divine Will making Itself manifest at certain intervals in a special Person, divinely preordained for this Mission. The similarity of the characteristics applied to the "Perfect Man" in Sufism and the Manifestation of God in the Bahá'í teaching is obvious. However, in spite of these remarkable analogies there are also striking differences between the Sufi and the Bahá'í notions. What is implied by the Divine Manifestations in the Bahá'í Faith is a special category of created Beings who are sent down to humanity with a new Revelation from God at more or less definite intervals. These are the Great Prophet-Founders of' the Religions. In contrast to this the Sufi concept reflects the predominant Moslem view that Prophethood was terminated in the Prophet Muhammad, consequently there can be no prophet after Him. From this point in history the "Muhammadan Essence" is realized in the "saints," specially chosen by God, who are called "Wali." The latter act on behalf and within the teaching of the Prophet Muhammad.

                                          The Human Intellect

The Human Intellect: A Bahá’í-inspired Perspective

by Adrian John Davis

“Through this faculty man enters into the very Kingdom of God.”1

Introduction

he term intellect has been used very loosely in psychology, from being equivalent to eve ry t h in g

T      rational to being a generic term covering cognitive processes as a whole. Even in everyday language

we hear the term used in a loose cognitive way to denote people who are intelligent, such as, “He
has a fine intellect.” In this article, however, I wish to show that the term intellect denotes two facul-
ties of the human being. For instance, in the Bahá’í writings, while the term intellect is also used in con-
nection with the rational power of Man, it also denotes a spiritual faculty, which transcends such men-
tal faculties. Thus, in general usage, the term has two different mean in gs although unfortunately they are
frequently interchanged, with the second denotation being subsumed and lost under the first mean in g,
causing a blurring and veiling of the Intellect’s higher exalted nature.

In this article then, after an historical account of references to Intellect2 in Greek, Jewish, and Islamic
philosophy and theology, together with an explanation of the link between Intellect and the prophetic
ability of the Manifestations of God, I shall present an account of Intellect from a Bahá’í perspective,
and from that conclude that there are two sources of knowledge. I shall then explain what the purpose
of having such a faculty should be, and outline the two essential conditions for its use. Finally, I shall
try to indicate how the Intellect is to be used via meditation and the employment of the imagination in
guided imagery.

Intellect as Reason and as a Spiritual Faculty
There are many descriptions of Man’s intellect as equivalent to reason, such as that found in the fol-
lowing passage by Bahá’u’lláh where intellect is grouped with comprehension, “We beg them not to
depend upon their intellect, their comprehension and lear n in g, nor to contend with the Revealer of
celestial and infinite knowledge.”3 However, the origin of this type of intellect is also acknowledged and
described as having a spiritual cause, making it a supernatural or metaphysical phenomenon rather than
a physical one, as ‘Abdu’l-Bahá states, “…without the Holy Spirit he would have no intellect.…”4 and “All
the powers and attributes of man are human and hereditary in origin—outcomes of nature’s processes—
except the intellect, which is supernatural.”5 And in a remarkable passage, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá gives us further
insight into the spiritual reality of Intellect where he talks of three realities in the human being, name-
ly, physical, rational, and spiritual, the physical reality being in common with an im als, the rational real-
ity being responsible for observing the mysteries of science, and the third reality of Man being inspired
by the Holy Spirit and allowing vision across time to occur, as well as being that which bestows eternal
life, “Man is endowed with an outer or physical reality. It belongs to the material realm, the animal king-
dom, because it has sprung from the material world. This an im al is tic reality of man he shares in com-
mon with the an im al s. The human body is like an im als subject to nature’s laws. But man is endowed with

a second reality, the rational or intellectual reality; and the intellectual reality of man predom in ates over
nature. All these sciences which we enjoy were the hidden and recondite secrets of nature, unknowable
to nature, but man was enabled to discover these mysteries, and out of the plane of the unseen he
brought them into the plane of the seen. Yet there is a third reality in man, the spiritual reality. Through
its medium one discovers spiritual revelations, a celestial faculty which is infinite as regards the intel-
lectual as well as physical realms. That power is conferred upon man through the breath of the Holy
Spirit. It is an eternal reality, an indestructible reality, a reality belonging to the divine, supernatural
kingdom; a reality whereby the world is illum in ed, a reality which grants unto man eternal life. This
third, spiritual reality it is which discovers past events and looks along the vistas of the future. It is the
ray of the Sun of Reality. The spiritual world is enlightened through it, the whole of the Kingdom is
being illum in ed by it. It enjoys the world of beatitude, a world which had not beginning and which shall
have no end.”6 It is this third spiritual reality of Man which refers to the second use of Intellect above.

The History of Intellect

In the history of philosophy, the doctrine of intellect has a distinguished pedigree. In chapter 5 of
Book III of the De Anima (1986), Aristotle (384–322 BC) drew a two-tier distinction between active and
passive intellect, of which the commentator Lawson-Tancred says, “…the passive intellect seems to
embrace those aspects of thinking which…seem most connected with mortality and the active intellect
to embrace the remainder” (p. 93). Of this latter division, Aristotle described it as “intellect from with-
out” and “self-creating thinking” (ibid, p. 95), and that to participate in this God-like activity, Lawson-
Tancred observes, was “to somehow come to participate in its immortality” (ibid, p. 96). Indeed, in Book
Lambda of the “Metaphysics,” Aristotle says that the noblest activity is contemplation, an activity of
intellect, which God is doing continuously, while in the “Nichomachean Ethics,” Aristotle argues that
the highest happiness for Man is this contemplative life.7

The Jewish scholar Moses Maimonides (1135–1204) devotes several chapters of his Guide for the
Perplexed to an exam in ation of the faculty of Intellect. He describes such a faculty as unique to Man,
distinguishing him from the an im als by giving him access to a source of knowledge beyond the senses
and making him akin to God, “As man’s distinction consists in a property which no other creature on
earth possesses, viz., intellectual perception, in the exercise of which he does not employ his senses, nor
move his hand or his foot, this perception has been compared…to the Divine perception, which requires
no corporeal organ. On this account…he is said to have been made in the form and likeness of the
Almighty…” (Ch. 1, p.14). This property is not a physical one, “…it is not a power inherent in the body,
but a power which is absolutely separate from the body, and is from without brought into contact with
the body” (Ch. 72, p.119). Furthermore, it is this divine inf luence “…which enables us to think, and gives
us the various degrees of intelligence” (Ch. 37, p. 227). For instance, in a person in whom the div in e
influence reaches their the logical but not the imaginative faculty one sees “the condition of wise men
or philosophers”; if it reaches both the logical and imaginative faculties then “this is the case with
prophets”; and if it reaches the imaginative but not the rational faculty then one has “statesman, law-
givers…” (ibid, p. 228).

Muslim scholars such as Al-Farabi (878–950 AD) and Avicenna (Ibn-Sinna, 980–1037 AD) also wrote of
Intellect. In an illum in ating book by Rahman (1958), we learn that Al-Farabi also described Man as pos-
sessing a two-tier intellectual structure, namely, the human intellect and the active intelligence. The
first of these is divided into potential intellect which can become actual intellect when the knowledge
of Forms (as taught by Plato) has started to actualize (p. 11) in it, and acquired intellect, when the actu-
al intellect contemplates itself as a Form (p. 12); the second division comprises the Holy Ghost, and the
transcendental intelligence (p. 14). Of this second division Al-Farabi, like Maimonides, also said that
Intellect “comes into us from outside and is not a part of our mind” (p. 13).

As for Avicenna, he regards the Intellect as a faculty “which is already ‘informed’ with the forms of
actual universal intelligibles…” (p. 33); he also sees it as a “self-knowledge” of the soul (p. 15). Like Al-
Farabi, Avicenna also regards the beginning of intellect as potential intellect, which is “an immaterial
and immortal substance” and that its ac t u al iz ation also occurs when “man conceives the pr im ary gener-

\[46\] The Human Intellect

al truths” (p. 14). Avicenna believes that this process marks the beginning of actual intellect (p. 15),
although unlike Al-Farabi’s view, this conceiving is not an abstraction but a result of the direct emana-
tions of the Active Intelligence (p. 15). Now when the potential intellect is able to operate fully without
any sensory input we then have the acquired intellect (pp. 14–15). Avicenna also describes the acquired
intellect as a creative faculty, which is a manifestation of the Active Intelligence (p. 19). After acquired
intellect the prophetic intellect is reached, which is directly informed by the Active Intelligence (p. 20).
The Active Intellect of the Prophet

Maimonides has contributed significantly to the elucidation of the relationship of intellect to the
occurrence of prophecy. He, like Avicenna, describes prophecy as an “emanation” from God via the
medium of the Active Intellect, “in the first instance to man’s rational faculty, and then to his imagina-
tive faculty; it is the highest degree and greatest perfection man can attain; it consists in the most per-
fect development of the imaginative faculty” (Ch. 36, p. 225).

Regarding this prophetic intellect, which ord in ary mortals do not possess, Rahman says of the
prophet that He is “… a person of extraord in ary intellectual endowment such that, by means of it, he is
able to know all things by himself without help of instruction by an external source” (p. 30). ‘Abdu’l-
Bahá also tells us that the Manifestations of God permanently possess a higher faculty in addition to the
rational soul: this faculty is a “universal divine mind,” which is “a conscious power, not a power of inves-
tigation and of research,” and that such a power “is the special attribute of the Holy Manifestations and
of the Dawning-Places of Prophethood; a ray of this light falls upon the mirrors of the hearts of the
righteous.”8 Thus, we as ord in ary human beings, although not Manifestations of God, are capable of
receiving rays of this divine light and being illum in ated with knowledge of a higher degree, given cer-
tain conditions (see below), although for most people most of the time consciousness is “receptive, not
creative” (Rahman, p. 35).

The Bahá’í View of Intellect

The Bahá’í writings view the human being as an essentially rational rather than physical being, this
fact making him superior to the physical creation, “The reality of man is his thought, not his material
body. The thought force and the an im al force are partners. Although man is part of the animal creation,
he possesses a power of thought superior to all other created beings.”9 In the Bahá’í writings this
“power” of thought is the mind, which is regarded as a composite of four powers viz. imagination,
thought, comprehension, and memory: “Man has…spiritual powers: imagination, which conceives things;
thought, which reflects upon realities; comprehension, which comprehends realities; memory, which
retains whatever man imagines, thinks and comprehends.”10 Of these, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá says that, “God’s
greatest gift to man is that of intellect, or understand in g.” 11

But Man possesses more than mind—he also has the latent capacity of intellect, the third reality given
above. Let us look at this capacity more closely. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá says of this third reality, “This is a power
which encompasses all things, comprehends their realities, discovers all the hidden mysteries of beings,
and through this knowledge controls them: it even perceives things which do not exist outwardly; that is
to say, intellectual realities which are not sensible, and which have no outward existence, because they
are invisible; so it comprehends the mind, the spirit, the qualities, the characters, the love and sorrow
of man, which are intellectual realities.”12 ‘Abdu’l-Bahá also continues that the capacity of the mind for
scientific, artistic, legal, and inventive endeavours all ultimately derive from this third reality:
“Moreover, these existing sciences, arts, laws, and endless inventions of man at one time were invisible,
mysterious, and hidden secrets; it is only the all-encompassing human power which has discovered and
brought them out from the plane of the invisible to the plane of the visible.”13 This Intellect is thus a
kind of “inner perception or insight”14 providing “intuitive knowledge”15 including a “knowledge of
being,”16 that is, God “…has given us…inner vision by which we may perceive the glory of God...and the
inner hearing wherewith we may hear the voice of our Creator.”17

Two Sources of Knowledge

The possibility of “inner perception” or “intuitive knowledge” means that two sources of knowledge
are ava il able to Man, that is, it is possible for the mind to know and understand things both with and
without the help of the senses, as in dreams, “…this immortal human soul is endowed with two means of
perception: One is effected through instrumentality; the other, independently. For instance, the soul sees
through the instrumentality of the eye, hears with the ear, smells through the nostrils and grasps objects
with the hands. These are the actions or operations of the soul through instruments. But in the world of
dreams the soul sees when the eyes are closed. The man is seemingly dead, lies there as dead; the ears do
not hear, yet he hears. The body lies there, but he—that is, the soul—travels, sees, observes. All the
instruments of the body are inactive, all the functions seemingly useless. Notwithstanding this, there is
an immediate and vivid perception by the soul. Exhilaration is experienced. The soul journeys, per-
ceives, senses.”18 Thus the soul knows things in two ways, “through instruments and organs” and with-
out them.19 These instruments are on the one hand the senses and the brain, that is, “sense perception,”
and “reasonable perception” or “intellection,” respectively,20 while on the other hand the non-instru-
mental way of knowing is by “insight, the power of inner perception,”21 or “intuitive knowledge.”22 I
believe that the second reality of Intellect explains the existence of the source of knowledge without
instruments and organs.

The Purpose of Intellect
What is the purpose of the Intellect? Why should Man possess such a faculty? There are two related
reasons for the bestowal of this capacity to Man:

> (a) for the “awakening of the conscious soul of man to perceive the reality of Divinity”23 and
> (b) the means to “the attainment unto His unfailing guidance.”24
‘Abdu’l-Bahá has given us a clear historical example of the use of the Intellect with regard to the above
purposes, that is, of providing evidence both for the “reality of Divinity” and “unfailing guidance,”
which I shall quote in full since it is so fascinating: “About one thousand years ago a society was formed
in Persia called the Society of the Friends, who gathered together for silent communion with the
Almighty. They divided Divine philosophy into two parts: one kind is that of which the knowledge can
be acquired through lectures and study in schools and colleges. The second kind of philosophy was that
of the Illum in ati, or followers of the inner light. The schools of this philosophy were held in silence.
Meditating, and turning their faces to the Source of Light, from that central Light the mysteries of the
Kingdom were reflected in the hearts of these people. All the Divine problems were solved by this power
of illum in ation. This Society of Friends increased greatly in Persia, and up to the present time their soci-
eties exist. Many books and epistles were written by their leaders. When they assemble in their meeting-
house they sit silently and contemplate; their leader opens with a certain proposition, and says to the
assembly ‘You must meditate on this problem.’ Then, freeing their minds from everything else, they sit
and reflect, and before long the answer is revealed to them. Many abstruse divine questions are solved
by this illum in ation. Some of the great questions unfolding from the rays of the Sun of Reality upon the
mind of man are: the problem of the reality of the spirit of man; of the birth of the spirit; of its birth
from this world into the world of God; the question of the inner life of the spirit and of its fate after its
ascension from the body. They also meditate upon the scientific questions of the day, and these are like-
wise solved. These people, who are called ‘Followers of the inner light,’ attain to a superlative degree of
power, and are entirely freed from blind dogmas and imitations. Men rely on the statements of these
people: by themselves—within themselves—they solve all mysteries. If they find a solution with the assis-
tance of the inner light, they accept it, and afterwards they declare it: otherwise they would consider it
a matter of blind imitation. They go so far as to reflect upon the essential nature of the Divinity, of the
Divine revelation, of the manifestation of the Deity in this world. All the divine and scientific questions
are solved by them through the power of the spirit.”25

Conditions for the Use of Intellect

Two essential conditions are necessary when wishing to employ the Intellect:

\[48\] The Human Intellect

(i) “Purity of heart,” which then leads to knowledge and understand in g, as ‘Abdu’l-Bahá makes clear, “The

> understanding of His words and the comprehension of the utterances of the Birds of Heaven are in no
> wise dependent upon human learning. They depend solely upon purity of heart, chastity of soul, and
> freedom of spirit.”26 Indeed, the spiritual path has always required purity of heart so that further
> progress in knowledge and understanding may occur.
(ii) Faith in God’s Manifestation in order to receive “the breaths of the Holy Spirit”27 with which to pol-

> ish the mirror of the heart, “…the human spirit, unless assisted by the spirit of faith, does not become
> acquainted with divine secrets and the heavenly realities. It is like a mirror which, although clear, pol-
> ished and brilliant, is still in need of light. Until a ray of the sun reflects upon it, it cannot discover
> the heavenly secrets.28 ‘Abdu’l-Bahá explains the reason for this tendency of Man to be avaricious and
> gives hope that there is a means to overcome it, “Man possesses two kinds of susceptibilities: the nat-
> ural emotions, which are like dust upon the mirror, and spiritual susceptibilities, which are merciful
> and heavenly characteristics. There is a power which purifies the mirror from dust and transforms its
> reflection into intense brilliancy and radiance so that spiritual susceptibilities may chasten the hearts
> and heavenly bestowals sanctify them. What is the dust which obscures the mirror? It is attachment
> to the world, avarice, envy, love of luxury and comfort, haughtiness and self-desire; this is the dust
> which prevents reflection of the rays of the Sun of Reality in the mirror. The natural emotions are
> blameworthy and are like rust which deprives the heart of the bounties of God.” 29
Now since “By faith is meant, first, conscious knowledge, and second, the practice of good deeds,”30

to acquire faith one must know and believe in the Manifestation of God.31 Therefore, one must know
that Bahá’u’lláh is that Manifestation for this time and is therefore essential for accessing the Intellect,
Who is “the Source of Light” at this time in human history.

Meditation and Intellect

Now how does one practice using the Intellect? The answer is meditation, as ‘Abdu’l-Bahá explained
above, and here, “Through the faculty of meditation man attains to eternal life; through it he receives
the breath of the Holy Spirit—the bestowal of the Spirit is given in reflection and meditation. The spir-
it of man is itself informed and strengthened during meditation; through it affairs of which man knew
nothing are unfolded before his view. Through it he receives Divine inspiration, through it he receives
heavenly food. Meditation is the key for opening the doors of mysteries.”32

But how should one meditate? Shoghi Effendi has said, “As to meditation: This also is a field in which
the individual is free. There are no set forms of meditation prescribed in the teac h in gs, no plan as such,
for inner development…the manner of doing the latter is left entirely to the ind iv idu al ,”33 although he
also said, “…they should guard against superstitions or foolish ideas creeping into it.”34

However, from what ‘Abdu’l-Bahá has said, we can give some guidelines on how to meditate effective-
ly. At the outset we must be clear that as the Intellect and mind are both different and so they cannot
both function simultaneously, “…the sign of the intellect is contemplation and the sign of contemplation
is silence, because it is impossible for a man to do two things at one time—he cannot both speak and
meditate. It is an axiomatic fact that while you meditate you are speaking with your own spirit.”35 In this
regard, a person who meditates must abstract himself from the outside world, “In that state man abstracts
himself: in that state man withdraws himself from all outside objects; in that subjective mood he is
immersed in the ocean of spiritual life and can unfold the secrets of things-in-themselves. To illustrate
this, think of man as endowed with two kinds of sight; when the power of insight is being used the out-
ward power of vision does not see. This faculty of meditation frees man from the an im al nature, dis-
cerns the reality of things, puts man in touch with God.”36

Furthermore, knowing that ‘Abdu’l-Bahá says “…every great Cause in this world of existence findeth
visible expression through three means: first, intention; second, confirmation; third, action,”37 when
embarking upon the use of Intellect one must first check one’s motives. This is because one’s motives
will influence what one endeavors to investigate, with the heart reflecting accordingly what one is inter-
ested in, “… if the faculty of meditation is bathed in the inner light and characterized with divine attributes,

Lights of ‘Irfán

the results will be confirmed. The meditative faculty is akin to the mirror; if you put it before earthly
objects it will reflect them. Therefore if the spirit of man is contemplating earthly subjects he will be
informed of these. But if you turn the mirror of your spirits heavenwards, the heavenly constellations
and the rays of the Sun of Reality will be reflected in your hearts, and the virtues of the Kingdom will
be obtained. Therefore let us keep this faculty rightly directed—turning it to the heavenly Sun and not
to earthly objects—so that we may discover the secrets of the Kingdom, and comprehend the allegories
of the Bible and the mysteries of the spirit. May we indeed become mirrors reflecting the heavenly real-
ities, and may we become so pure as to reflect the stars of heaven.”38

Secondly, one should begin (and end) with the “confirmation” of a prayer, which ensures one’s guidance
and protection. In this regard, one must connect with the living Manifestation of God in the living reli-
gion, which in this day is Bahá’u’lláh, as Shoghi Effendi indicated, “Through meditation doors of deep-
er knowledge and inspiration may be opened. Naturally, if one meditates as a Bahá’í he is connected with
the Source....”39 Thus one should use the prayers of Bahá’u’lláh.

And thirdly, one should put into action what one has learned from one’s inner insight if one wants to
achieve anything, for as ‘Abdu’l-Bahá says, “The attainment of any object is conditioned upon knowl-
edge, volition and action.”4 0

Finally, I believe that to use the Intellect we must employ one of the powers of the mind, namely, the
faculty of imagination, as a vehicle, so to speak, to travel to the spiritual world.41 Bahá’u’lláh tells us
that, “…keenness of understanding is due to keenness of vision,”42 that is, to develop one’s power of
vision is the same as developing one’s power of imagination. My justification for this is illustrated by
Rahman’s (op. cit.) research on the process of revelation which showed that “The central principle on
which the Muslim philosophers found their explanation of the inner, psychological processes of tec hn i-
cal revelation is that the imaginative faculty represents in the form of particular, sensible images and
verbal modes, the universal simple truth grasped by the prophet’s i ntellect” (p. 36). Rahman also cites
Avicenna who said that the Intellect functions in terms of symbols, “It is not impossible that when a
man’s imaginative power reaches extreme perfection so that he receives in his waking life from the Active
Intelligence a knowledge of present and future facts or of their sensible symbols and also receives the
symbols of immaterial intelligibles and of the higher material existents and, indeed, sees all these—it is
not impossible that he becomes a prophet giving news of the Divine Realm, thanks to the intelligibles
he has received. This is the highest degree of perfection a man can reach with his imaginative powers”
(pp. 37–38).

Indeed, Aristotle in Book III of De Anima compares the use of Intellect to that of perception, with
images playing “the part of percepts” (Ch. 7), and that “whenever one is contemplating, it is some image
that one is contemplating; for the images are like the sense data without matter” (ibid., Ch. 8)43 Thus
Maimonides (op. cit.) said that while “Part of the functions of the imaginative faculty is…to retain impres-
sions by the senses…. The principal and highest function is performed when the senses are at rest…for
then it receives, to some extent, divine inspiration in the measure it is predisposed for this influ-
ence…such a person will undoubtedly perceive nothing but things very extraord in ary and divine, and see
nothing but God and His angels. His knowledge will only include that which is real knowledge, and his
thought will only be directed to such general principles as would tend to improve the social relations
between man and man” (Ch. 36, pp. 225–226).

Thus, if the prophet has to use the imaginative faculty to bring spiritual truths to this world, then we
can reverse the process and use the same imaginative faculty to return to the spiritual world. Now how
does the imagi native faculty work in practice? This is to be achieved through guided imagery, which
works by using meditative scripts and appropriate symbols which visu al ize journeys to the inner world
where answers are found to questions that are put to the Inte ll ect, as the members of the Illum in ati did
as related above, that is, “In that state of mind you put certain questions to your spirit and the spirit
answers: the light breaks forth and the reality is revealed.”44 The results are evidently very powerful, as
Avicenna indicates, “Verily! God has overwhelming majesty and greatness; what I have witnessed is
something wonderful not to be found in the entire range of existence” (Rahman, p. 37).

\[50\] The Human Intellect

Conclusion

In this article I have tried to demonstrate that in addition to a logical employment, the concept of
Intellect admits of a nobler endeavor, namely spiritual perception. I have tried to prove this by reference
to several distinguished historical sources and by arguments found in the newest of the world’s faiths,
the Bahá’í religion. Furthermore, this intellectual perception is to be used to perceive divinity and
receive guidance—the highest expression of this being prophecy—the conditions for such use being an
exalted standard of personal morality and faith in God’s Manifestation. Finally, I have introduced the
reader to some pre l im in ary remarks about the tec hn iques of meditation and guided imagery when using
the noble faculty of the Intellect.

31) Bahá’u’lláh has told us that the knowledge of God is identical with the knowledge of the Manifestation, “The essence of

> belief in divine unity consisteth in regarding Him Who is the Manifestation of God and Him Who is the invisible, the
> inaccessible, the unknowable Essence as one and the same.” Glean in gs from the Writings of Bahá’u’lláh, CXXXIX, p.
> 303; hear also II, p. 5, the Kitáb-i-Aqdas, p. 142, Tablets of Bahá’u’lláh, p. 156, Selections from the Writings of the Báb,
> p. 77, pp. 82–83, p. 86, pp. 88–89, and p. 158, and Some Answered Questions, p. 222.
32) Paris Talks, p. 175. In the same passage it is also said that “You cannot apply the name ‘man’ to any being void of this

> faculty of meditation; without it he would be a mere an im al, lower than the beasts…. Furthermore, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá says of
> the benefits of meditation, “This faculty brings forth from the invisible plane the sciences and arts. Through the medi-
> tative faculty inventions are made possible, colossal undertakings are carried out; through it governments can run
> smoothly. Through this faculty man enters into the very Kingdom of God.” Paris Talks, p. 175.

found in Phaedrus, 276, and Protagoras, 323.
39) Directives from the Guardian, p. 47. An interesting procedure for the use of prayer for solving problems is given in A
