Tafsīr as Experience in an Early Work by the Bāb*

Todd Lawson

> It is of some significance that the first major work by ʿAlī Muḥammad
> Shīrāzī (d. 1850), known to history as The Bāb, founder of the influen-
> tial yet short-lived Iranian Bābī religion, is a commentary on the first
> two chapters of the Qurʾān—the short al-Fātiḥa (the Opening) and the
> longest sura of the Qurʾān, al-Baqara (the Cow). It is, however, known
> as the Tafsīr sūrat al-baqara. The sura al-Baqara is sometimes regarded
> by exegetes as “the Qurʾān in miniature” because in it are found most of
> the same concerns, ordinances, conceits and images found throughout
> the Book. A commentary on this sura by any given author would there-
> fore tend to reveal the way he would approach the entire Qurʾān. It may
> be also that the Bāb had intended to produce a commentary on the whole
> Qurʾān at the time he wrote this commentary in early 1259–60/1844. After
> all, he is said to have later produced no less than nine complete tafāsīr
> during his incarceration in Azerbaijan during the last months of his
> life. Why he would have suspended such a project at this earlier date is
> open to speculation. We do know, however, that it was shortly after the
> completion of this commentary on the first part ( juzʾ) of the Qurʾān that
> Mullā Ḥusayn Bushrūʾī made his visit to Shīrāz, and the Bābī “movement”
> may be said to have been born. It was during this visit that the Bāb laid
> claim to a new revelation, an apocalyptic event very much in line with
> the expectations of Twelver Shīʿism inasmuch as it was now a thousand
> years since the last or 12th Imām had gone into occultation. The medium
> for this apocalypse was an unusual commentary on the sura of Joseph
> (Yūsuf )—the 12th sura of the Qurʾān that was in fact written in the form
> of a Qurʾān: divided into suras and ayas with disconnected letters appear-
> ing at the beginning of the suras. The message to the Shīʿa was: this is the
> true Qurʾān that had been in hiding with the 12th Imām until now and

* This chapter and the chapter by Omid Ghaemmaghami in this volume were made
> possible by a generous grant to me from the Social Sciences and Humanities Research
> Council of Canada (SSHRC) to study the problem of apocalypse and related literary
> dynamics in the Qurʾān and Qurʾān commentary.

> its appearance also entails the appearance or return of the hidden Imām.
> This second much more famous work, the Tafsīr sūrat Yūsuf, also known
> as the Qayyūm al-asmāʾ or the Aḥsan al-qaṣaṣ, appears to be the first
> work written after the commentary on al-Baqara. Its contents—which
> include in the course of things, a kind of commentary on most of the
> Qurʾān—suggest that the Bāb’s desire to comment on the entire Qurʾān
> might have been expressed in it and it therefore became unnecessary to
> compose an actual commentary in the more traditional style of the Tafsīr
> sūrat al-baqara.1 Further, such dramatic events as unfolded in the wake of
> the new apocalypse possibly had the effect of diverting the Bāb’s attention
> from such a very traditional, purely literary project to concentrate upon
newer and more important developments.

Whatever the case may be, the Tafsīr sūrat al-baqara—with which we
> are solely concerned in what follows—provides invaluable information
> about the nature of the Bāb’s earliest religious ideas. There has been a ten-
> dency to regard the Tafsīr sūrat Yūsuf as the first work of any significance
> written by the Bāb.2 Beginning with the invaluable research of Denis
> MacEoin on the sources for Bābī doctrine and history, it has become pro-
> gressively more clear that the Bāb’s Tafsīr sūrat al-baqara enjoys a unique
> and heretofore unappreciated significance for a study of the Bābī religion.3
> Insofar as this first major work was also a tafsīr, its interest goes beyond
> the confines of a study of a specific “heresy” to engage with the greater
> Islamic tradition itself on the common ground of the Qurʾān.4 Of the sev-
> eral topics and themes discussed in the Bāb’s commentary on al-Baqara,
> four emerge as the most characteristic: divine self-manifestation—tajallī;
> the hierarchization of being and existence; eschatology—khurūj, qiyāma,

> 1 See Lawson, Gnostic Apocalypse 21–45 for a fuller description of this later work.
> 2 Amanat, Resurrection and Renewal 172–73.

3 Furthermore, because it was written during the earliest period of the Bāb’s literary
> activity, MacEoin thinks that it is much less likely to have been corrupted by partisans of
the later Bahāʾī/Azalī dispute. MacEoin, The Sources for Early Bābī Doctrine 41.

4 Several manuscripts of the Tafsīr sūrat al-baqara are known to exist. The interested
> reader is referred to MacEoin’s book for details where 15 are listed with, in some cases,
> the name of the scribe and the date of transcription. MacEoin, The Sources for Early Bābī
> Doctrine 201; see also his comments on the work, 33, 37, 46–7 and 74. One should add to
> MacEoin’s list the Leiden manuscript that was mistakenly thought to contain only a com-
> mentary on a few verses, MacEoin, The Sources for Early Bābī Doctrine 33: “verses 70–94
> only”. and a manuscript of the work, as yet uncatalogued, in the Princeton “Bābī Collection”.
> This last item bears a provisional shelf number 268 and is dated 1328 [1910]. It is bound in
> one volume with another manuscript entitled Kitāb al-jazā’ min nuqṭat al-bā’.

> ẓuhūr; and “religious” authority—walāya. Here, we are concerned only
> with this fourth topic.5

Walāya

> The heart of all Shīʿism centers on the strong veneration of the first Imām,
> ʿAlī ibn Abī Ṭālib (d. 40/661) as the guardian, protector, and true friend
> of those who have acknowledged his station as the immediate successor
> of the Prophet Muḥammad. For this reason he is known as walī, and the
> quality of his authority is called walāya. Indeed, as indicated in an earlier
> study of the Bāb’s work, walāya may also be understood as a synonym for
> covenant itself.6 There is in Shīʿism no notion more fundamental than
> this. The study of this commentary by the Bāb must begin, therefore, with
> an examination of the way in which the subject of walāya is treated. It will
> be seen, perhaps not surprisingly, that the idea was just as central to the
> Bāb’s thought, as it is to Shīʿism in general. Also, it will be seen that belief
> or faith (īmān) is conditioned by the degree to which one accepts the
> walāya of ʿAlī, and after him the Imāms, to the extent that a deed, no mat-
> ter how meritorious, is unacceptable unless it has been performed by one
> who has fully confessed the truth of this walāya. Moreover, this walāya
> has existed from eternity, much like the so-called “Muḥammadan light,”
> and numbers among those who have recognized it the prophets Abraham,
> Moses, and Jesus. As an eternal principle, it remains an imperative for all
> would-be believers at all times; through acceptance or rejection of this
spiritual authority, one determines the fate of one’s soul.7

The radical interpretation of several passages in the Sūrat al-baqara
> as speaking directly to the subject of walāya is not an innovation of the
> Bāb’s, but has characterized a strong tendency in Shīʿī exegesis from the
> earliest times. Of interest here is that such a commentary was written
> by one who was not a member of the ʿulamāʾ class, but rather a young
> merchant. The nature of the commentary shows that there was a need

> century Iran and we may conclude that it has something to do with the
> conceptual contiguity of the two categories, religious authority (walāya)
> and apocalypse (ẓuhūr, kashf ) a contiguity which was mirrored by the
> temporal contiguity of the date of the Shīʿī eschaton and the literary activ-
> ity of the Bāb. The following description will illustrate the degree to which
> this need was felt, and the consequences it had for the interpretation of
> scripture.

Absolute Walāya

> The subject of walāya is introduced very early in the tafsīr where reference
> is made to the Absolute Walāya (walāyatuhu al-muṭlaqa) of ʿAlī, although
> the statement is not free of ambiguity. It comes in the course of the Bāb’s
> commentary on the second verse of the Fātiḥa: Praise be to God, the
> Lord of the Worlds. The verse is said to be the book (kitāb) of ʿAlī,
> in which God has placed all the principles (aḥkām) of Absolute Walāya
> pertaining to it. It is called here, the Paradise of the Inclusive Unity ( jan-
> nat al-wāḥidiyya), whose protection has been reserved for all those who
affirm ʿAlī’s walāya.8

In this very brief statement certain important terms are introduced,
which play a key role throughout the rest of the tafsīr. Apart from the

8 Baqara 8 and I 156: qad jaʿalahā Allāhu ẓillahā li-man aqarra bi-walāyatihi; cf. 2b: qad
> jaʿala Allāhu . . . Repeated reference throughout this commentary to the ideas of aḥadiyya,
> wāḥidiyya, raḥmāniyya, and so on, constitutes one of its more distinguishing characteris-
> tics. The terminology comes originally from Ibn ʿArabi (d. 638/1240) and its use here by
> the Bāb offers yet another example of how the work, if not the thought, of one of history’s
> greatest mystics had thoroughly permeated Iranian Shīʿī spiritual discourse (ʿirfān) by this
> time. For a study of these terms as they were received by Ibn ʿArabi’s student Qunāwī
> and others, see Chittick, The Five Divine Presences. (See also the important critique of
> this article by Landolt.) Briefly, the term aḥadiyya represents the highest aspect of the
> Absolute about which man can notion (if one may use a noun as a verb), but does not,
> of course, define the Absolute which must always be beyond whatever occurs about It in
> the mind of man. The term wāḥidiyya refers to the next highest aspect of the Absolute,
> the aspect which involves the “appearance” of the divine names and attributes. See also
> ʿAbd al-Razzāq al-Kāshānī, Iṣtilāḥāt al-ṣūfiyya 25 and 47. The proper understanding of this
> technical terminology has been a subject of scholarly debate in Iran for centuries. One
> form of the argument is analyzed in Landolt, Der Briefweschel esp. 41–63.

> word walāya (guardianship, friendship), the designation wāḥidiyya recurs
> over and over again throughout the work. It appears to be descriptive of
> one of the degrees of divinity that constitute the whole hierarchical meta-
> physical structure of the world. It is the degree immediately inferior to the
> divine Exclusive Unity (aḥadiyya). Such terminology betrays the influence
> of the so-called waḥdat al-wujūd school associated with Ibn ʿArabi. Suffice
> it here to say that the Absolute Walāya represents a theoretical position,
at least one remove from the Ultimate.9

The choice of the word “principles” (aḥkām) has several connotations. In
> his short introductory sentence to the tafsīr on the Fātiḥa, the Bāb charac-
> terizes this opening chapter of the Qurʾān as containing seven clear verses
> (ayāt muḥkamāt). The hermeneutic polarities of mutashābihāt/muḥkamāt
> represent one of the oldest concerns of tafsīr in general, and have been
> the cause of much speculation on the part of exegetes of all schools and
> attitudes. The primary idea is that the Qurʾān contains both ambiguous
> and unambiguous verses. At the most basic level these are thought to be
> divided between straightforward legal prescriptions and the rest of the
Book. The terminology here is taken from Q 3:7:

> It is He who sent down upon thee the Book, wherein are verses
> clear [muḥkamāt] that are the Essence of the Book [umm al-kitāb],
> and others ambiguous [mutashābihāt]. As for those in whose hearts
> is swerving, they follow the ambiguous part, desiring dissension,
> and desiring its interpretation [ta‌ʾwīlihi]; and none knows its inter-
> pretation [ta‌ʾwīl], save only God. And those firmly rooted in knowl-
> edge say, ‘We believe in it; all is from our Lord’; yet none remembers,
> but men possessed of minds.10

> With this verse comes one of the more fundamental disagreements
> between the Sunnī and Shīʿī exegetes who differ as to the sentence struc-
> ture of this verse. The above translation represents the “Sunnī” reading. A
> Shīʿī reading would be: and none knows its interpretation save God
> and those firmly rooted in knowledge (al-rāsikhūn fi-l-ʾilm). These
> rāsikhūn are of course the Imāms, in the first place, and in the second
> place, at least amongst the Uṣūlīs, the mujtahids.11 So understood, the

> designation of the verses of the Fātiḥa as unambiguous strongly suggests
> that the Bāb read them as having a positive and binding relationship with
> a true understanding of the Book. Seen in this light, his statement that
> verse 2 ordains belief in the Absolute Walāya of ʿAlī must be taken as divine
> law, binding upon the believer in the same way as legal prescriptions for
the terms of inheritance, or even prayer and fasting, are obligatory.12

At verse 3 of Sūrat al-baqara, the subject of Absolute Walāya is once
> again encountered. Here the Qurʾānic statement those who perform
> the prayer is said by the Bāb to imply general obedience (al-idhʿān) to
> Muḥammad and his Trustees (awṣiyāʾ) and his daughter (bintihi) through
> the Most Great Absolute Walāya (al-walāyat al-muṭlaqa al-kubrā).13 While
> in the previous statement this Absolute Walāya was linked with ʿAlī alone,
> here it includes all of the Imāms. In the same section walāya is identified
> with tawḥīd, the affirmation of the divine unity. The Bāb says that the act
> of prayer “from beginning to end” is the “form of affirming divine unique-
> ness” (sūrat al-tafrīd), the “temple (haykal) of tawḥīd,” and the “shadow
> (shabaḥ) of walāya.”14 This being the case, only the actual bearers15 of
> walāya are able to perform it properly because it is the foremost (awwal)
> station of distinction between Beloved (maḥbūb, i.e., God) and the lover
> (ḥabīb, in this case Muḥammad and the Imāms). The Family of God (āl
> Allāh = Muḥammad, Fāṭima and the 12 Imāms) are the true bearers of the
> meaning of the divine love mentioned in the famous ḥadīth qudsī: “I was
> a hidden treasure and desired to be known, therefore I created [hu]man-
> kind in order to be known.” This love (maḥabba) was manifested (tajallā)
> by God to them by means of their own selves (la-hum bi-him), to such a

> statement of method in which various points of view are mentioned. For a discussion of
> the issue within a tradition more akin to the one in which the Bāb wrote, see Mullā Ṣadrā,
Mutashābihāt al-Qurʾān.

12 Al-Ṣādiq is said to have glossed al-muḥkamāt hunna umm al-kitāb as “the Commander
> of the Faithful and the Imāms” and al-mutashābihāt as “fulān wa fulān,” e.g., Abū Bakr and
ʿUmar. See al-ʿĀmilī al-Iṣfahānī, Tafsīr mir’āt al-anwār 132.

13 Baqara 25. This ms. and others have nabtihi which may be an error. The passage
needs to be checked against all available mss. before a critical edition may be prepared.

14 On shabaḥ (pl. ashbāḥ), often encountered with a companion word ẓill (pl. aẓilla) see
> Amir-Moezzi, The Divine Guide 32, 33 and 40 where the translation of ashbāḥ nūr is given
> as “silhouettes of light”. These “silhouettes of light” represent the “ontological modalities
of the Imams themselves during the “time” of pre-existence.

15 Maẓāhir (sing. maẓhar) lit: “the place where walāya appears or is manifest”. It may
> be translated directly as manifestations as long as it is remembered that the manifesta-
> tions themselves are not the agents or manifestors, but the vehicles by means of which the
> manifestation takes place as a result of God’s manifesting activity.

> degree of exclusivity that this divine love subsists only through them, and
pure servitude appears only in them.16

The Bāb continues to say that the Family of God (āl Allāh) are the loci
> (maḥāll) of all servitude and all lordship (ʿubūdiyyāt and rubūbiyyāt), imply-
> ing that it is through their act of servitude that they have been invested
> with the rank of lordship in relation to others. Whoever, then, confesses
> the truth of their walāya in the “area of servitude” (ṣuqʿ al-ʿubūdiyya), has
> in fact performed the prayer according to all the stations of the Merciful
> One. And he who performs the prayer and “lifts the ‘veils of glory’ and
> enters the glorious house (bayt al-jalāl), such a one will dwell under the
protection, relief and comfort (ẓill) of their walāya.”17

At Q 2:24, one of the taḥaddī or “challenge” verses, Absolute Walāya
> is explained negatively, as not being acknowledged by those who were
> challenged to bring a sura comparable to those in the Qurʾān.18 In short,
> those guilty of kufr (disbelief), are all those who have failed to recognize
> the Absolute Walāya of ʿAlī. Inasmuch as these unbelievers are said to
> be those who have been given the love of Abū Bakr (maḥabbat al-awwal)
> that is in fact a Fire,19 it seems here that “absolute” refers not first of all
> to any philosophical or metaphysical absoluteness, but rather to exclusiv-
> ity. That is, true walāya cannot be shared during a given period of time.
> In this connection, it may be added that there appears to be no difference
> in the quality of the walāya born by any of the Imāms. At verse 60 of Sūrat
> al-baqara, for example, the water which gushed forth from the rock
> at twelve different places after Moses struck it with his staff, is said
> to represent the walāya of all the Imāms. The Bab says that although the
> water issued from these various places, it was in fact the same water.

Walāya of God

> A cognate notion of Absolute Walāya is the Walāya of God, walāyat

> of God to the angels: Bow yourselves to Adam!, the Bāb says that the
> esoteric interpretation (tafsīr al-bāṭin) understands the speaker of the
> command to be not God but Muḥammad, while the angels are the seeds
> of all created things (dharr al-ashyāʾ fī mashhad al-ūlā), a reference to the
Qurʾānic Day of the Covenant ( yawm al-mīthāq) mentioned at Q 7:172:20

> when thy Lord drew forth from the Children of Adam, from their
> loins—their descendants [dhurriyatahum], and made them testify
> concerning themselves (saying): “Am I not your Lord (who cher-
> ishes you and sustains you)?”—They said: “Yea verily! We do testify!”
> (This), lest ye should say on the day of judgement: “Of this we were

> The act of prostration is the confession of servitude to the walāya of God,
which is equated with allegiance to ʿAlī, and the disavowal of all else.

Adam, furthermore, is none other than ʿAlī, and Iblīs is none other than
> Abū Bakr. At this level the walāya is also characterized as the walāya of
> the Exclusive Unity belonging to ʿAlī (walāyat al-aḥadiyya li-ʿAlī). The
> entire drama, it should be emphasized, occurs before “creation.” Thus Abū
> Bakr (almost always referred to as Abū al-Dawāhī “Father of Iniquities”)
> is the symbol of primordial infidelity and ignorance—kufr, just as ʿAlī is
> the symbol of primordial faith and knowledge—īmān. The angels, as
> mentioned above, are taken as the seeds or potential of all created things
> destined to develop into actuality. They are also referred to as pre-existent
forms (ashbāḥ) and shadows (aẓilla).

The primordial drama had its historical re-enactment or analogue on
> the day of al-Ghadīr, 18 Dhu-l-Ḥijja 10/16 March 632 when Muḥammad
> appointed ʿAlī as his successor. At that time the angels were Salmān, al-
> Jundab and Miqdād, the early stalwart supporters of ʿAlī.21 It is important
> to note however, that here we use the word “re-enactment” rather inap-
> propriately. It is obvious that for the author of this commentary it is the
> event of al-Ghadīr which gives meaning to the primordial drama described
> in Q 7:172, so from this point of view it is actually prior in spiritual value.
> Al-Ghadīr will shortly be re-enacted in the revelation of the Tafsīr sūrat
> Yūsuf. This would seem to be a perfect, if rather distinctive, instance of

20 Baqara 131. The term mashhad al-ūlā is determined by the fact that al-ūlā (“pre-

In the commentary on Q 2:62, the term Absolute Walāya is associated
> with the entire Family of God, because they are sanctified servants who
do nothing of their own wills, but rather the will of God.

> Surely they that believe, and those of Jewry, and the Christians,
> and those Sabaeans, whoso believes in God and the Last Day, and
> works righteousness—their reward awaits them with their Lord,
> and no fear shall be on them, neither shall they sorrow.

> The works of righteousness mentioned in this verse therefore are
> described as being all included in the act of recognizing (iʿtirāf ) their
> Absolute Walāya, and their reward awaits them with ʿAlī. In the con-
> text of the verse itself, the suggestion is that even non-Muslims are impli-
> cated in the responsibility of recognizing ʿAlī. This may offer a further
> indication of the way in which “absolute” (muṭlaqa) is to be understood.
> It should be noted that the last phrase of the above verse is repeated at
> Q 10:62, where it is specifically the friends of God (awliyāʾ Allāh) who
> will neither grieve nor sorrow.22 Such cross-references and correspon-
> dences are quite likely not accidental, particularly in this case where
> the later verse corroborates by its vocabulary (awliyāʾ plural of walī) the
theme of walāya.
At verse 83, the term Universal Walāya occurs:

> And when We took compact with the Children of Israel: ‘You shall
> not serve any save God; and to be good to parents, and the near
> kinsman, and to orphans, and to the needy; and speak good to men,
> and perform the prayer, and pay the alms.’ then you turned away,
> all but a few of you, swerving aside.

> The Bāb says that God is speaking here about His taking compact with
> all created things “in the eight paradises,” to recognize the walāya of ʿAlī.23
> The first of these paradises is the Depth of Unity (lujjat al-waḥda), and
> is characterized by the command: You shall not serve any save God

> “[and this] without reference [to anything else].”24 In the second paradise
> the compact was taken by means of recognizing the Universal Walāya
> (al-walāyat al-kulliyya) of the parents, i.e., Muḥammad and ʿAlī who are
> respectively, the symbols of universal fatherhood and motherhood. Such
> recognition, the Bāb says, is in reality the good mentioned in the verse,
> because to do good means to do good to all according to what each merits.
> The good which these particular parents deserve has only been hinted
> at, because were the Bāb to openly (bi-l-taṣrīḥ) describe it, the prattling
enemies (mubṭilūn) would cavil at it.25

Throughout the tafsīr there are numerous statements indicating that
> Absolute Walāya is in fact the same as walāya per se. The following pres-
> ents the various aspects of this all-important notion and includes material
> related to the ideas of Prophethood (nubuwwa), Messengership (risāla),
> Trusteeship (waṣiyya) and Leadership (imāma).

False Walāya

> The idea that walāya can be either true or false may be traced to the
> Qurʾān itself. In such verses as Q 8:73, for example, reference is made to
> the unbelievers who are friends (awliyāʾ) of one another, or Q 62:6
> where the Jews are criticized for their claim to be the friends of God,
> apart from other men. The two opposing groups, ḥizb Allāh and ḥizb
> al-Shayṭān mentioned respectively in Q 5:56 and 58:19, represent a basic
> division which provides at least theoretical support for the ideas presented
> in this tafsīr. This distinction between two fundamentally opposed groups
> is most evident in Medinese suras and has been seen to be related to the

24 Bi-lā ishāra, an allusion to the Ḥadīth Kumayl. The distinctive term lujja deserves
> some attention. As hapax legomenon (Q 27:44) it raises questions of meaning, even though
> it occurs here along with the important marker of apocalypse kashf. Avicenna’s use of it in
> the last book of the Ishārāt (viz. lujjat al-wuṣūl: “depth or sea of re-union”) further domes-
> ticates the mysterious and poetic Qurʾānic usage for the gnostic and mystical lexicon of
> Islam (Ibn Sina, Kitāb al-ishārat wa-l-tanbihāt, vol. 4, namaṭ 9, bāb 20, 98–9; see also the
> recent excellent translation of this important book of the Ishārāt by Keven Brown, listed
> below in the bibliography). It is one of several “hydrological” images used frequently in
> this work, others are yamm, ṭamṭām, taṭanjayn in addition to the words denoting bodies
> of water found in Sūrat al-baqara or elsewhere in the Qurʾān and ḥadīth. For a study of
> the poetic and gnoseological role of water in the Qurʾān, see Lawson, Divine Wrath and
Mercy.

> different concerns that faced the Prophet after his departure from Mecca,
where walāya was purely God-oriented.26

The figure of ʿAlī is presented as the bearer, par excellence, of this True
> Walāya, although it has already been emphasized that the quality of this
> walāya is not changed, regardless of who its (rightful) bearer might be.
> As we have seen, True Walāya, or the Walāya of God (walāyat al-ḥaqq),
> had its beginning in pre-eternity, or pre-existence when the sub-atomic
> existential potential identities or dharr, of all things were commanded to
> acknowledge the authority of ʿAlī. It was also at this time that its opposite,
> the Walāya of the False One (walāyat al-bāṭil) and Falsehood acquired
> potential existence. Just as ʿAlī is the bearer of True Walāya, Abū Bakr is
designated as the bearer of False Walāya.

Such a statement is of course indicative of the milieu in which the Bāb
> was writing. It is remarkable that this kind of denigration of important
> Sunnī personalities is absent from the Bāb’s Tafsīr sūrat Yūsuf, written
> shortly after this commentary. The theme is an old and definitive one in
> Shīʿī literature, and should be viewed as a standard element of religious
> vocabulary, and one which lends concrete and immediate meaning to
> various passages in the Qurʾān read in this Shīʿī milieu. Akhbārī Qurʾān
> interpretation took for granted the perfidy of the first three Caliphs, as did
other schools of Shīʿī exegesis.
One of the earliest occurrences of the idea of False Walāya is at verse 58:

> And when We said, ‘Enter this township, and eat easefully of it
> wherever you will, and enter in at the gate, prostrating, and
> say, “Unburden us”; We will forgive you your transgressions, and
> increase the good-doers.’ [Q 2:58]
> Because the commentary on this verse contains several typical and signifi-
> cant elements, and because it is relatively concise, it is reproduced here
in its entirety.27

> That which is intended (wa-l-murād) by township is the depth of the
> Exclusive Unity (lujjat al-aḥadiyya) and the gate (bāb) is ʿAlī, upon him
> be peace.28

> (maʿrifa) of the secrets (asrār) of ʿAlī, upon him be peace, . . . for those
> who do good (al-muḥsinīn). The [true] muslim is the one who submits,
> with his whole being (bi-kullihi), to him (ʿAlī).
> God has put in all created things a sign (āya) pertaining to His own self (ʿan

> He (God or Muḥammad?) fashioned the form of ʿAlī, upon him be peace,
> with His own hand at (ʿalā) the gate of the city. And He commanded those
> who attain [the gate] to prostrate to him (li-nafsihi = ʿAlī) through “the
> rending of veils and allusions (bi-kashf al-subuḥāt wa-l-ishārāt)” and to enter
> through this gate by renouncing all but him (ʿAlī or God).
> He who obeys his Lord according to these suggestions (ishārāt) is the one
> who truly says, “Unburden us” [in the way the Qurʾān intends it]. And ver-

> symbol or personification of the otherwise abstract idea of misdirected
belief.

The next specific mention of the False Walāya appears in the Bāb’s
> commentary on Q 2:61. This long verse is one of the few that the Bāb
> quotes in sections. The commentary in question occurs at the third and
final section:

> Go back in shame to Egypt; you shall have there what you demanded.’
> And abasement and poverty were pitched upon them, and they were
> laden with the burden of God’s anger; that, because they had disbe-
> lieved the signs of God and slain the prophets unrightfully; that,
> because they disobeyed, and were transgressors.
> When the people of the depth of the Inclusive Unity accepted that which
> was meaner than the most exalted land (balad al-aʿlā), God cast them
> down [var. on Get you down] from the depth of the walāya to the Egypt
> of contingency.
> And the abasement of allusions (ishārāt) and the poverty of limitations
> (ḥudūdāt) were pitched upon them. They merited [only] the False Walāya
> (walāya bāṭila) [at the time of] the Origination (bi-ibdāʾ) of the walāya of
> truth because they disbelieved in the walāya of ʿAlī, the Origin of all signs.
> Whoever disbelieves in his walāya, disbelieves in the signs of the Exclusive
> Unity and the tokens of the Inclusive Unity and the stations of nubuwwa. It
> is because of this disbelief that they killed the prophets wrongfully.
> Because God made all the Prophets as rays of the sign of His walī, he who

> first three caliphs suffer so much derision, to a metaphysical register quite
> beyond, though not necessarily excluding, the concerns of communalism.
> The “historical location” of the events referred to in Q 2:61 is meaningful
> for the Bāb insofar as it permits him to speak about more fundamental
> spiritual issues. By use of the term Inclusive Unity, it would appear that
> False Walāya here does not represent pure unalloyed evil; rather, it is

> (or Restricted) Unity” themselves desired a lower station, that they were
> cast out by God from the true walāya into the “Egypt of the contingent
> world” (miṣr al-imkān). Thus, they brought upon themselves those afflic-
tions mentioned in the verse.

False Walāya is further indicated at verse 67, which the Bāb has divided
> in two for the purposes of his commentary. Here the Qurʾān tells the story
> of Moses leading the Children of Israel through the wilderness. In par-
> ticular, it tells of the rebelliousness of those who were given certain com-
> mandments by God through Moses. The specific command is to sacrifice
> a cow, and the episode itself is the subject of several successive verses. An
excerpt from this commentary follows the citation of the entire verse:

> And when Moses said to his people, ‘God commands you to sacrifice
> a cow.’ They said, ‘Dost thou take us in mockery?’ He said, ‘I take ref-
> uge with God, lest I should be one of the ignorant.’ [Q 2:67]
> When God commanded Muḥammad to communicate to the people of the
> contingent world [the order to] sacrifice the concerns and affairs of the
> self (al-shuʾūnāt wa-l-aṭwār al-nafsāniyya) and to turn their backs (idbār) to
> the False Walāya which is the cow, he communicated [it] on the eighteenth
> day of the month of pilgrimage that which he was commanded to [com-
> municate] by his Lord.36

> The Bāb then cites a portion of the Farewell Pilgrimage sermon, which
> represents for him, it seems, not only a re-articulation of the basic theme
> of the verse but more importantly, the true type of covenant-taking by
> which all others must be measured, including the so-called primordial
> event described at Q 7:172.37 The implication here is that while the verse
> in one of its intentions actually refers to the history of Moses, its more

on which see now K. Crow, Islam and Reason.

37 The association of the walāya of ʿAlī with the primordial covenant is a reading com-
> mon to Akhbārī tafsīr: al-Baḥrānī, Kitāb al-burhān 2, 46–51 ad 7:172: And when the Lord

> same meta-temporal ground. The point is made through the incessant
> use of typological figuration. The celebrated passage from the Farewell
Pilgrimage is:

> Whoever I am the master of [The Bāb adds here: ‘in the worlds of unity
> (ʿawālim al-waḥda)’] then this man ʿAlī is his master (mawlāhu). O God,
> befriend him who befriends him and be an enemy to him who is enemy to
> him. Assist to victory whoever assists him to victory, and abandon (khad-
> hala) him whoever abandons him.38

> Both Sunnī and Shīʿī sources cite this tradition (and several variants) as a
> sound report. It has, however, been subject to various interpretations due,
> mainly, to the wide semantic range of the word mawlā. However, because
> of its status as a widely attested report (mutawātir) this passage has been
cited by the Shīʿa from the earliest times as a proof-text for their claims.39

Walāya is that by which a human’s distinctive (if not sacred) faculty of
> choice (ikhtiyār) is exercised. In this respect, all human beings, it would
> appear, are created equal. Several verses are interpreted by the Bāb as
upholding this principle, for example his commentary on the following:

> So woe to those who write the Book with their hands, then say,
> ‘This is from God,’ that they may sell it for a little price; so woe to
> them for what their hands have written, and woe to them for their
> earnings. [Q 2:79]
> Here the Bāb says that all created things were writing “the excellence
> ( faḍl) of ʿAlī with their hands “by means of what they chose for them-
> selves.” At some point, however, certain ones abandoned the Exclusive
> Unity of the walāya of ʿAlī and brought woe upon themselves by writing
> his “excellence” ( faḍl) with their own hands. That is, they distorted his
> excellence by ascribing it to someone else. The walāya of ʿAlī, for having
> been acknowledged but rejected by them, will destroy them. This is the
> meaning of selling for a little price. On the other hand, those who

> testify . . .; cf. also al-Baḥrānī, Kitāb al-burhān 1, 463–7 ad 5:3: Today I have perfected

> Here it is clear that False Walāya is not restricted to one personality, but
> like Absolute Walāya, it represents an enduring perhaps ontic principle.
> The following passages present the same “dangerous” aspects of the walāya
of ʿAlī. In the first example it is characterized as a punishment:

> And they say, ‘The Fire shall not touch us save a number of days.’
> [Q 2:80]

> This refers to the duplicity of those who accepted the Prophet’s nomina-
> tion of ʿAlī at Ghadīr Khumm, only to renege later. Among them, accord-
ing to Shīʿī tradition, was the arch villain ʿUmar himself:

> Among those who were profuse in their congratulations on his position was
> ʿUmar b. al-Khaṭṭāb. He gave a public appearance of great joy at it, saying:
> “Bravo, bravo, ʿAlī, you have become my master and the master of every
> believing man and woman.”42
The subject arises again in the commentary on the following verse:

> When there has come to them a Messenger from God confirming
> what was with them, a party of them that were given the Book
> reject the Book of God behind their backs, as though they knew
> not. [Q 2:101]
> This verse is interpreted as referring to Muḥammad’s bringing the impera-
> tive of “servitude to his self ” (bi-l-ʿubūdiyya li-nafsihi) in the realm of time-
> less Origination, which confirms not only that which is with you, but
> “that which came before and that which will come after you.” However,

represents a “corruption” of the word walī.

> following the walāya of ʿAlī,” reject the Book of his walāya behind the
False Walāya.43

At verse 102, the Bāb makes a series of comments relevant to the fre-
> quently encountered notions of Exclusive and Inclusive Unity. Here the
> terms are seen to refer to True and False Walāya respectively. It is inter-
esting that in this way, even False Walāya has some positive aspects:

> Solomon disbelieved not, but the Satans disbelieved, teaching the
> people sorcery, and that which was sent down upon Babylon’s two
> angels, Harut and Marut; they taught not any man, without they
> said, ‘We are but a temptation; do not disbelieve.’ From them they
> learned how they might divide a man and his wife, yet they did not
> hurt any man thereby, save by the leave of God, and they learned
> what hurt them, and did not profit them, knowing well that whoso
> buys it shall have no share in the world to come; evil then was that
> which they sold themselves for, if they had but known. [Q 2:102]
> And that which was sent down upon Babylon’s two angels, Harut
> and Marut; they learned, from the two, how they might divide a
> man and his wife, is an allusion to the one who abides in the land of the
> Two Gulfs44 because it is he who understands [the relationship between]
> the Exclusively Unitary Lordship and the servitude of the self.45 Yet they,
> i.e., the people of the Inclusive Unity, did no harm in the place (mashʿar)

> And he who follows the walāya of the False One, has indeed learned
> what hurt him, from hating the Truth47 and [that the only thing which]
> profits him (i.e., the only thing he gains) is Hell and the deprivation
> (ḥirmān) of the meeting with God.48

Walāya of the First, Second, and Third

> In the above discussion of False Walāya, the term Walāya of the First
> (walāyat al-awwal) was encountered. As mentioned above, this designa-
> tion has a double reference. On the historical level, it alludes to the fact
> of Abū Bakr’s acceptance of the caliphate upon the death of Muḥammad,
> becoming thereby the first successor to the Prophet. In what Corbin calls
> the metahistorical dimension, we have already seen that this primacy also
> refers to the first act of disobedience at the time of the creation of Adam,
> when God commanded the angels to prostrate themselves before the first
> man. Taken in this sense, the figure of Abū Bakr acquires the features of
> the symbol of a cosmic principle of rebelliousness to God’s command,
> which puts him quite beyond the concerns of simple sectarian polemic.50
> In addition to these two aspects of the designation “First,” the term carries
> with it a certain element of irony in that as a theological term, it is one of
> the recognized names (asmāʾ) of God.51 Furthermore, in normal discourse,
> it is used as a positive adjective of primacy in the sense of “foremost” or
> “most important.” Is this another case of apocalyptic reversal at the level
> of semantics/rhetoric? The word is used frequently in this last sense in
> the tafsīr, as for example at verse 3, in the Bāb’s discussion of the ritual
> prayer (ṣalāt), where the Bāb says that ṣalāt is the first or foremost station
> of distinction between God and the lover.52

By way of further clarification, the Bāb discusses the Qurʾānic al-ākhira,
> which may be thought of as the opposite of al-awwal. At verse 4, the Bāb
> says of the word Hereafter that it is in fact a designation of ʿAlī. His
> walāya is the thing that was revealed to Muḥammad, and God has raised
> no prophet, nor revealed any book or command, except through the
> walāya of ʿAlī.53 Thus it would appear to carry the idea of “I am the alpha
and the omega” with the emphasis here on omega.

One of the earliest allusions to the walāya of the First is found in the
> Bāb’s commentary at verse 24. This is one of the so-called taḥaddī verses
> in which those who doubt the divine source of Muḥammad’s revelation
are challenged to produce something comparable:

> If you do not—and you will not—then fear the Fire, whose fuel is
> men and stones, prepared for unbelievers. [Q 2:24]
> Interestingly, the Bāb shifts the reference away from the Qurʾānic chal-
lenge, and discusses the verse in the following terms:

> God [here] provides information [akhbara] about their kufr [and His state-
> ment may be phrased this way]: “If you do not accept the depth of the
> Exclusive Unity in the contingent aspect of your beings (imkānikum) then
> you will never recognize the absolute walāya of ʿAlī in the actualized
> aspect of your beings (akwānikum). Then fear [heed > ittaqū] the Fire of
> the call (daʿwa) of Ḥusayn on the Day of Ashura. And if you do not heed,
> God will make this retreat (idbār) the Fire of the love of the First (maḥabbat
> al-awwal), [and] whose fuel, is the Second (ʿUmar) and stones [will be]
> the Third (ʿUthmān). God has prepared the love (ḥubb) of these three for
> unbelievers.54

> Although the word walāya is not used here, a substitute or related term
> “love” (maḥabba, i.e., of the First), is clearly opposed to the idea of the
> Absolute Walāya of ʿAlī. The commentary on this verse also carries one of
> the earliest references to the related negative designations of the “Second”
> and the “Third,” and illustrates one of the more frequent exegetical tech-
> niques used by the Bāb, who many times exploits a series of substantives
> in order to more fully elaborate his theme. Here the Qurʾānic Fire, fuel,
> and stones are each considered separately. Through the sin of ingratitude
> (kufr), love is transformed into an infernal flame. It is not clear whether
> the equating of ʿUmar with fuel, while ʿUthmān is associated with
> stones, represents a significant gradation. One of the more important

> aspects of this section of the Bāb’s commentary is the equivalence walāya/
> maḥabba. Either term can be positive or negative, as in the case here of
> wrongly-directed love, which ultimately becomes Fire. Love as a synonym
> for walāya is of course not new with the Bāb,55 but it is important that
> this aspect of walāya be constantly kept in mind as a means of holding
> the other connotations of the term, such as “authority” and “power” in
> perspective.56 It is this equivalence that led Corbin to state that Shīʿism
> is pre-eminently a religion of love.57 This is, of course, a very large asser-
> tion and one that must be considered in the somewhat rarified context of
> Corbin’s key sources. However, insofar as devotion to the walāya of the
> Imām represents, in essence, an act of love, the assertion stands. In the
> commentary immediately preceding this section, the idea of primal evil
is also brought out:

> And if you are in doubt concerning what We have sent down on Our
> servant, then bring a sura like it, and call your witnesses, apart
> from God, if you are truthful. [Q 2:23]
> Doubt (rayb), we are told, is the quality of the First (ṣifat al-awwal) and
his followers.58 The verse is then paraphrased:

> O those of you who are in doubt and non-recognition59 concerning
> that which was sent down upon Our servant Muḥammad touching the
> walāya of ʿAlī! [If you are in doubt] then search through all the contingent
> worlds. Is it possible that there is anyone equal to ʿAlī in the matter of the
> caliphate? If it is possible, then prove it through your witnesses ( fa-ʿtarifū
> bi-shuhadāʾi-kum) from among those you have set up as signs of your Lord
> (āyāt rabbikum) aside from ʿAlī, if you are truthful.60

55 E.g., the discussion of walāya in al-ʿĀmilī al-Iṣfahāni, Tafsīr mir’āt al-anwār 337–8.

> The author also says that wilāya means “assistance” (al-nuṣra), and walāya means “sover-
> eignty” (al-imāra, al-sulṭān). On maḥabba as descriptive of the dynamic which binds the
believer to his Imām, whether true or false, see Shaykh Aḥmad al-Aḥsāʾī, Ziyāra 190.

56 “Love” corresponds to allegiance, i.e., tawallin, or “following”; it goes from the lower
> to the higher. “Authority” proceeds from the higher to the lower. On the several intentions
of walāya, see Landolt, Walāyah.

who refused to acknowledge ʿAlī.

At this commentary “love” is also associated with walāya. The Bāb says:

> None can attain to the Depth of the Exclusive Divine Unity (lujjat al-aḥadiyya)
> except by means of his (ʿAlī’s) walāya. It is the goal (maqṣūd) of your exis-
> tence (wujūdi-kum), because God has made you for the sake of this love
> (maḥabba). And He has put His life (ḥayātuhu) and His glory (ʿizzuhu) in
> it, to the extent that such is possible in the contingent world—if only you
> were truthful—(meaning) if only you knew.61

> At verse 27, the First is identified as the one who first broke the covenant
> of God (not in historical time but in primordial time), and as such has
> significance for the above-mentioned metahistorical dimension of sacred
history:

> Such as break the covenant of God after its solemn binding, and
> such as cut what God has commanded should be joined, and such as
> do corruption in the land—they shall be the losers. [Q 2:27]
> The Bāb says that the phrase: those who broke the covenant refers
> to the covenant (ʿahd) of Muḥammad, about the signs of ʿAlī and was
instituted in the world of al-ghayb:

> These signs were placed within ( fī) the atoms (dharr) of the hearts [which
> represents] the station (maqām) of tawḥīd, and [in] the atoms of the intel-
> lects [which represents] the level (rutba) of nubuwwa, and [in] the atoms
> of souls [which represents] the abode of imāma, and [in] the atoms of the
> bodies [which represents] the place (maḥall) of the love of the Shīʿa after
> God imposed this solemn binding upon all created things [which is] faith
> in Muḥammad, ʿAlī, Ḥasan, Ḥusayn, Jaʿfar, Mūsā, and Fāṭima. They shall
> be the disbelievers (kāfirūn instead of khāsirūn, all mss.).62
> The first who broke the covenant of God in the contingent world in all of
> its stations, from the sign of tawḥīd to the last limit of multiplicity was Abū
> al-Dawāhī, may God curse him. He broke the covenant of God concerning
> His friends in the worlds of al-ghayb and cut the walāya of ʿAlī in his visi-

> With this commentary we encounter another designation of Abū Bakr—
> Abū al-Dawāhī. The Bāb refers to the first Caliph this way throughout
> the commentary, just as ʿUmar is often called Abū al-Shurūr (“Father of

Bāb, although I have not found them elsewhere.64

At verse 34, in one of the several brief citations of the famous Khuṭbat
> al-shiqshiqiyya that appear in the tafsīr, the khuṭba is quoted in connec-
> tion with the Divine command to the angels to prostrate before Adam. All
> of the angels bowed except Iblīs, “that is the First, and he is the one about
> whom ʿAlī said: ‘Verily Ibn Abī Quḥāfa,’—and he is Abū al-Dawāhī—
> ‘assumed the mantle (la-qad taqammaṣahā)’ [i.e., of the caliphate].”65 This
> Khuṭba is found in the canonical Nahj al-balāgha and is referred to often
by Shīʿī writers. It begins as follows:

> By God! that man snatched the caliphate as if it were a garment which could
> be put on by him, while all the while he knew that my station was like that
> of the pivot (quṭb) of the grinding stone.66

> Although no name, apart from fulān (“so-and-so”) is mentioned here, the
> statement is universally understood as referring to Abū Bakr, as ʿAbduh
> himself points out.67 The Khuṭba continues to explain how the next two
> Caliphs wrongfully usurped ʿAlī’s position and the reasons for which
> this was tolerated by the Imām. The title of the sermon is derived in the
> following way. ʿAlī’s condemnation and lament was interrupted by the
> arrival of a messenger with a letter which ʿAlī then read, breaking off
> the address. After ʿAlī had read the letter, Ibn ʿAbbās asked him to resume
> his theme to which the Imām replied: “In no way, in no way. It was like
> the foam on the camel’s mouth (shiqshiqa) as it opens its mouth to bellow
and then falls silent.”68

The next mention of the First occurs at verses 41 and 42, which are
> separated in the text by their respective commentaries, but are presented
> together here for convenience:

64 The first three Caliphs are frequently called fulān in the Akhbārī literature which
> has been published. Whether the manuscript sources of this literature contain other less
neutral names, is something that can only be speculated upon.

70 It is important to bear in mind the two meanings of āya: sign or verse. The statement

“explicit” confirmations of ʿAlī’s appointment by Muḥammad, e.g., Q 5:55.

> The act of regarding anything else, insofar as anything else is incapable of satisfying spiri-
tual need, is a trifling recompense. N.b. cf. 63b: bi-āyati nafsihi.

78 The Bāb adapts the grammar of the Qurʾān to mean that price is now the thing
> acquired. Baqara 170. These terms have been dealt with elsewhere, except for perhaps
> aṭwār, plural of ṭawr. On this word in ʿAyn al-Quḍāt see T. Izutsu, Creation and the
> Timeless Order of Things 126; cf. Isfarāyinī, Le Rélévateur des mystères, q.v. index “coeur,
sphères du, adwār-i dil”.

79 The term ʿamā has a rich and complex history. As this word is frequently encoun-
> tered in the writings of the Bab, Bahāʾullāh, and other Bahāʾī authors, some reference to
this history is in order. The word figures in a ḥadīth ascribed to the Prophet:

> He was asked: “Where was our Lord before He created creation?” The Prophet
> answered: “In al-ʿamā having no air above or beneath it.”
> A part of this tradition is quoted by Ibn ʿArabi (Fuṣūṣ 1, 111) and al-Kāshānī, who cites it in
> a shorter form (the editor of al-Iṣṭilāḥāt gives a variant: “. . . having air above it and beneath
it.”) in the above form, comments as follows:

> al-ʿamā is the level (ḥaḍra) of the Exclusive Unity, according to us. . . . It is said that
> it is the level of the Inclusive Unity which is the place where the divine names and
> attributes appear, because al-ʿamā is a thin cloud (al-ghaim al-raqīq), and this cloud
> is a screen between heaven and earth. Therefore this level is a screen between the
> heaven of the Exclusive Unity and the earth of creaturely multiplicity, about which
> not even the [above] ḥadīth from the Prophet is very helpful. (al-Kāshānī, al-Iṣṭilāḥāt
> 131–2.)
> Izutsu’s translation, “abysmal darkness” (Sufism and Taoism 119) and Austin’s “The Dark
> Cloud” (The Bezels of Wisdom 134) do not convey the diaphanous quality which al-Kāshānī
> emphasizes, suggesting a thin cloud at such a high altitude that it seems to appear and
> disappear from one moment to the next. A recent discussion of the use of the term in Bābī
> and Bahā’ī literature is Lambden, An Early Poem of Mirza Husayn ʿAli Bahāʾuʼllāh.

> Another mention of the First, in connection with the topic of walāya, is
at verse 51:

> And when We appointed with Moses forty nights, then you took to
> yourselves the Calf after him and you were evildoers. [Q 2:51]
> Here Moses means Muḥammad and the forty nights represent ʿAlī, who
> lived for “thirty years after the death of Muḥammad” plus the ten “Proofs”
> (ḥujaj) who were his progeny and successors. Together these eleven Imāms
> represent the period when “their glory was concealed by the darkness of

> al-Dawāhī. Finally, this darkness of disbelief will be relieved by the advent
> (ẓuhūr) of the Day of the Qāʾim. “When God causes his Cause (amr) to
come forth, what I have only hinted at will clearly appear.”81

Similar comments may be found throughout the tafsīr, notably at
> Q 2:58, where the transgressions which God promises to forgive are
> precisely those resulting from the walāyat al-bāṭil. Here walāya would

> Bāb also invokes the Shīʿī taḥrīf al-Qurʾān tradition:

80 Baqara 170–1. The complete verse is: That then is God, your Lord, the True;
> what is there, after truth, but error? Then how are you turned about? The allu-
> sion is particularly deft because of the obvious similarity in terminology, obvious only
> to those who “swim in the sea of the Qurʾān,” because the first part of the verse is not
mentioned!

81 A possible reference to the Bāb’s future claims. Baqara 183–4. On the connotations
> of Ẓuhūr see al-ʿĀmilī al-Iṣfahānī, Tafsīr mir’āt al-anwār 227, where in addition to the ideas
> of “appearance” and “advent,” are mentioned “dispensation” and “victory” and where its
ta’wīl is related to al-bāb.

82 Baqara 190. See below, however, where the Bāb says that disbelief in the walāya of
ʿAlī will never be forgiven.

our hands is not the whole Qurʾān.”86

The commentary on verse 79 identifies the three separate mentions of
> woe (al-wayl) with the first three caliphs.87 Elsewhere we are told that the
> refusal to recognize (inkār) the walāya of ʿAlī is accounted by God as “all
> transgressions.” He who, in verse 81 is described as being encompassed
> by his transgression is in this condition because he earned “the walāya
> of the First.” Similarly, the Fire of Hell is the subsequent “walāya of the
> Second.”88 To explain further this verse, the Bāb quotes a ḥadīth from an
anonymous Imām:

> When they disputed the Imāmate of the Commander of the Faithful those
> were the inhabitants of the Fire, there they shall dwell forever.89

al-Qummī, Tafsīr al-Qummī 25, speaks of Jews and Christians as the fāsiqīn intended

the walāya of Muḥammad and ʿAlī, and their descendents.

The Bāb then says:

> And the secret of the thing I will now explain. It is that the Garden which
> the Merciful promised to His servants, to all others equally, [including] the
> Family of God, is the shadow of the body of Ḥusayn.
> And the seven hells are similarly for the First and his manifestation (maẓhar).
> Verily God created them from the kufr of the body of al-Yazīd90 (sic) may he
> be accursed and chastised.91
> He who confesses to the walāya of ʿAlī will have entered the [paradise of
> the] good pleasure [of God] (al-riḍwān), and he who rejects will have
> entered the Fires [of Hell] (al-nīrān). And that is the order of things firmly
> established (taqdīr maḥtūm) by one Mighty, Wise.92
At the commentary on verse 85, we find another mention of these three:

> Then there you are killing one another, and expelling a party of
> you from their habitations, conspiring against them in sin and
> enmity; and if they come to you as captives, you ransom them; yet
> their expulsion was forbidden you. What, do you believe in part
> of the Book, and disbelieve in part? What shall be the recompense
> of those of you who do that, but degradation in the present life,
> and on the Day of Resurrection to be returned unto the most terri-
> ble of chastisement? And God is not heedless of the things you do.
> [Q 2:85]
> And the addressee (al-mukhāṭab) is the First and his companions [with the
> meaning]: you killed the sign of ʿAlī, despite what God placed in your-
> selves (anfusi-kum) after the Messenger of God had already taught you,
> “who of you knows best his self, is he who knows best his Lord”93
> . . . But, you were conspiring against them with the polytheists by means
> of the walāya of sin and enmity. And sin is the Second and enmity is the
> Third.
> And if they come to you as captives—namely the people who do not
> know the Imām—you ransom them with the walāya of yourselves. And
> in the estimation of God, this has been forbidden (muḥarram) to you.

Thus you expelled them from the walāya of ʿAlī, after you had acquainted

Conclusion

> Enough examples have now been examined to support the following
> conclusions.

> (1) Walāya is one of the major themes of the commentary.
(2)    The radical interpretation of Qurʾānic passages as speaking directly

to the subject of walāya has its roots in traditional Shīʿī literature.
(3)	The nature of the commentary on this theme exhibits certain features

> in common with the so-called ghulāt. In this regard the following
> summary from the Kitāb al-irjāʾ, written by the former leader of the
> Mukhtāriyya, al-Ḥasan b. Muḥammad ibn al-Ḥanafiyya (99/717) is per-
> tinent. Although the term ghulāt is not used, the group is condemned
> for holding the following views:
1.	The belief that religion meant allegiance to the house of ʿAlī, so

> that people ought to be loved or hated inasmuch as they were loyal
> or disloyal to that house. To this could be added the excommuni-
> cation (barāʾa) of the opponents of ʿAlī among the Companions
> (ṣaḥāba), especially the first three caliphs;
2.	The belief that the Prophet hid (katama) nine tenths of the Qurʾān

> and that they were guided to a new revelation (i.e., the claim that
> prophecy was possible after Muḥammad);
3.	The hope for a state that would be established in their favor in the

future, in a general resurrection preceding the Day of Judgment.105

> While the second item is never stated in these terms in the Bāb’s tafsīr, the
> several references to the corruption of the Qurʾān, i.e., as when the Bāb
> quotes a tradition that says “Gabriel came down with this verse thus,” would
> seem to offer a functional parallel. The last, number 3, figures in the even-
> tual claims of the Bāb, but we have seen, particularly in the commentary
> on Q 2:51, that the establishment of the “sovereignty” (salṭana) of the Qāʾim
> is one of the themes of the commentary, as it is in so-called “orthodox”

The Shaykhīs themselves were of course accused of ghuluww by their

> Aḥmad (d. 1241/1826) takes pains to disassociate his teaching on the sub-
> ject of walāya from what the “hyperbolistes” ( ghulāt) say.108 That the Bāb
> himself was sensitive to such accusations may be seen in his citation of a
ḥadīth from Bāqir, the fifth Imām, which runs as follows:

> O company of the Shīʿa! Be a middle position (al-numruqat al-wusṭā) so that
> the one who has gone beyond (al-ghālī) might return to you and the one
> who has lagged behind (al-tālī) might catch up with you.109

> That such beliefs as those described above (and which inform much of
> Akhbārī Qurʾān commentary) were susceptible of being demonized as
> “extremist” is supported by the long section in the Mirʾāt al-anwār (a late
> Safavid glossary of Qurʾānic vocabulary in the key of Akhbārīsm) in which
> the charges of tafwīḍ and ghuluww (which might otherwise be leveled
> against the work) are discussed and explained.110 Here the author says
> that those who occupy a “middle position” (al-numruqat al-wusṭā) are
> those who are able to appreciate the subtleties (daqāʾiq) of his doctrine

> abstruse (ṣaʿb mustaṣʿab). No one understands or believes them except
> those angels who have been brought near (al-muqarrabūn), a sent (or
> true) Prophet (al-nabī al-mursal), or a servant whose heart has been tested

not be absent from the discourse.

More pertinent to this study however, are the methods by which the

> of typology as a method of reading scripture appears to have implica-

> logical interpretation of the New Testament as the fulfillment of the Old
> Testament, the argument may be applied, with a few structural consider-
> ations, to general Akhbārī Shīʿī interpretation of the Qurʾān. At bottom,
> the argument in Shīʿī tafsīr is the vindication of the claim of the Shīʿa
> against the Sunnīs, whereas in the case of the Bible, a similar argument
> was put forth by the authors of the New Testament against the Jews. The
point to be made however would appear to be applicable in both cases:

> Typology is a figure of speech that moves in time: the type exists in the past
> and the antitype in the present, or the type exists in the present and the
> antitype in the future. What typology really is as a mode of thought, what
> it both assumes and leads to, is a theory of history, or more accurately of
> historical process: an assumption that there is some meaning and point to
> history, and that sooner or later some event or events will occur which will
> indicate what that meaning or point is, and so become an antitype of what
> has happened previously.116

> We have seen for example, how the Bāb interpreted the events of the
> primordial Day of the Covenant, to support the central belief of orthodox
> Shīʿism, namely that ʿAlī’s rightful position was usurped by Abū Bakr. In
> this and many other contexts, it might be argued that the Qurʾān fulfills

> Imāms represents the New Testament as “fulfillment.” This analogy is of
> course not perfect because of the many important differences between
> the respective elements. Given however, the course which future Bābism
> was to take as a result of acknowledging the return of the Qāʾim in the
person of the Bāb, Frye’s argument seems even more compelling:

> Typology points to future events that are often thought of as transcending
> time, so that they contain a vertical lift as well as a horizontal move for-
> ward. The metaphorical kernel of this is the experience of waking up from
> a dream . . . When we wake up from sleep, one world is simply abolished
> and replaced by another. This suggests a clue to the origin of typology: it is
> essentially a revolutionary form of thought and rhetoric. We have revolu-
> tionary thought whenever the feeling “life is a dream” becomes geared to an
> impulse to waken from it.117

> The similarities between the themes described above in the Bāb’s tafsīr,
> with those ascribed to the members of the Mukhtariyya or Kaysaniyya
> would support Frye’s insight. In addition, because the figure of the Qāʾim
> is sometimes interpreted by the Bāb as an esoteric principle or reality,
> Frye’s allusion to a “vertical” dimension of typological exegesis is also
apposite.

With this survey of the use of the term walāya in the Bāb’s commen-
> tary on the first juzʾ of the Qurʾān, it is possible to identify the Bāb’s
> thinking on this subject only partly with the teachings of Shaykh Aḥmad
> and Sayyid Kāẓim, which in turn may be thought to represent a kind of
> Akhbārī synthesis of several intellectual and spiritual tendencies.118 But it
> is certainly not possible to say that the Bāb depended upon Shaykhī works
> for the main thrust of his argument, which would appear to be as old as
> Islam itself. It would be interesting to compare this view of walāya with
> that of Shaykh Aḥmad’s older Persian contemporary, Nūr ʿAlī-Shāh, whose
> writings on the subject seems to be much less “Shīʿī” than the former’s,
> although there are certain common features shared between the two.119
> Such a comparison would probably further explain Shaykh Aḥmad’s great
popularity in Iran.

The term walī may mean friend, helper, protector, superior or guardian;
in basic legal theory it designates the primary heir. We see all of these

> the other Imāms. The legal idea of primary heir is one of the more inter-
> esting in this regard, and may be seen reflected not only in statements
> made by the Bāb, but also in the ḥadīth literature itself. One of the more
> striking features of the above material is the delineating of False Walāya
> as a polar opposite of the True Walāya. As has been noted, this idea is not
> a creation of the Bāb and may be traced to the earliest ḥadīth collections
> and the Qurʾān itself (e.g., Q 4:76) where the world is divided into two
> major groups: those who do battle in the way of God, and those who do
> battle in the way or for the sake of Idols (sabīl al-tāghūt), the friends of
Satan (awliyāʾ al-Shayṭān).120

The position of walī as a kind of “intercessor” for those too weak to
> act on their own behalf in matters of inheritance, and presumably other
> legal matters,121 is one which is also reflected in those traditions quoted
> by the Bāb in which, for example, Paradise is the reward of those whose
walī is ʿAlī.

Walāya was the central fact of meaning in the Bāb’s universe, which
> was of course, a religious one. It is because of, or by means of walāya,
> that God communicates with creation, if not that principle because of
> which and by means of which creation is “creation.” Throughout this tafsīr
> it is clear that it is this same walāya that circulates as spiritual energy
> through all the various hierarchies of being and existence uniting them
> and “enchanting” them. In this work it is also walāya that is central to
> divine self-manifestation—tajallī and that is also the central fact of the
> Shīʿī eschaton. Thus, it is without doubt the most important fact, idea and
> reality of the Bāb’s universe. For Shīʿism, walāya provides a means for fac-
> ing the otherwise imponderable problem: transcendence or immanence.
> In short the answer is “both.” But it is not a “mere” metaphysical accom-
> plishment. Recent historical events have shown us the profound and pow-
> erful place of walāya/wilāya/vilāyat in the Iranian soul. Khomeini rose to
> popularity as the leader of one of the most surprisingly successful revolu-
> tions in history on the appeal of a religious work entitled Vilāyat al-faqīh,
> a title which triggered many of the associations and historical-religious
> themes encountered above. Through the Bāb’s prolonged contemplation
> of this most powerful of all spiritual realities it is as if he himself was
