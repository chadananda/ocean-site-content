   pn.MACEOIN •s   'PitOBLF.MS OF SCHOLARSHIP •• t:   SOl~E   TilOUGfITS.

Dr.Denis MacE?in is well known in Baha'i circles as an academic v.isses3ed
of a very considerable knowledge of the Babi-Baha 1 i l!IOVe~er.ts.Without a
doubt much can be l•iarned from his writings in this area w!1ether or not cne
agrees with his conclusions.His sometimes controversial views should r.rcir.pt
Baha'i intellectuals,whether engaeed in Baha'i studies fro~ n.~ acadc:tic or
theological standpoint,to think deeply about ir.et.hodologlcal,hbtorical,coct-
-rinal and other issues.Having resigned .from the Baha'i move~eni a few years
ago his writings are naturally coloured- as he himself admits--by a re,lection
or Baha'i perspectives and institutions as he ha3 understood and experienced
them.At times his languagei!forceful and his orientation decidedly non-eir.path-
-etic. Various readers of nis •Problems or scholarship•• ' will probably dis:rl.as
his views as extreme or coloured by a 'released from the watch-tower' bias
despite his attempt to be objective.However his response to the Yerrinbool
report be evaluated from a faith standpoint, the fact 'remains that he raises
issues which Ba.~a'is who aspire to academic integrity cannot a.ford to pass
over in eilence,It might in fact be said that Babi-Baha'i studies will not

'°°gue with cl'itica and to diaouss problems or Baha'i scholarship has undoubtedly
contributed to the withdrawal from Baha'i membership of a growing number or
Baha'i intellectuals.

The time will surely come when critical acaderr.ic evaluations of tho Babi-
Baha'i movements will be read by intellectuals and others who wish to know
what the Babi-Baha'i movements are and what they teach or have to offer.If
Baha'i intellectuals continue to ignore problematic issues they will prove
unable to respond to academic critics.They will be seen to be out of to•1ch
and unable to engage in informed and meaningful dialogue.Baha'is,in other
words, will be forced to respond to academic Wld critical presentatior.s o!
their raith and be ill prepared to respond apologetically or in aTJY other "'31"
unless it is realized that there are many issues in need of honest and open-
-minded debate. The development of an informed and honest Baha'i apologetic is
essential.Apologetic it lllight be added here,can only be taken seriously toda;y
if it is honest,sincere and academically informed.

In one of his letters Shoghi Effendi predicted that "Baha'i scholars" would
appear who would lend a "unique support" to their Faith. Thia "unique su;:port"
may well be in the field of npologetic.But where are the Baha'i apologists
who are ready to grepplo with controversial issues?

Baha'i intellectuals toda;y race issues which did not confront religious
apologists or the ·past who lived in an aee when historico-critical ~~tho1olog1es
were unknown.They will have to grapple with problellf"s unknown to such learned
Baha'i apologists as Mirza Abu al-Fadl Gulpaygani(lBI.4-1914) who knew nothing
or the difficulties raised by the IT.odern scholarly analysis of religion or or
the application or critical tools to the study or the Bible,Qur'an and Bibi-
Baha'i writings.Whether or not Baha'is admit the validity or such modern
scholarly methodologies and the findingsresulting from their application, the
fact is that they will be compelled to respond to them.Baha'i apologetic or
the near' future will need to be academically informed in order to we an
effective response to contemporary scholarly critics.For this reason alone
the fostering or •Baha '1 scholarship' is of great importance.
