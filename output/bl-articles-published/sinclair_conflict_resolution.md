Mediation, Transformation and Consultation
A Comparative Analysis of Conflict Resolution Models

Guy Sinclair
Auckland, Independent Scholar

Transformative models of mediation begin from a belief that mediation
offers not merely an opportunity for conflicting parties to satisfactorily
resolve their problems, but a medium through which transformation of
individuals, and by extension society, can take place. While the precise
nature of that transformation may not be agreed upon by all writers on the
subject, nevertheless something more than mere “conflict resolution” is
envisaged. Moral development, the awakening of latent capacities of self-
awareness and compassion and the emergence of a society of peacemakers -
all are goals which are either explicit or implicit in the various models of
transformative mediation.

This paper begins by examining the best-known theory and model of
transformative mediation - that proposed by Folger and Bush in their book,
The Promise of Mediation1 and related articles2. Specifically, we will
analyse their philosophy of transformation, its implications for individuals
as well as society, and the particular mediator practices they propose.

Critics of Bush and Folger‟s work have, among other things, expressed
dissatisfaction with their sharply-drawn but simplistic taxonomy of
mediation models, pointed out shortcomings in the political theory which
underlies their mediation model, and suggested that they marginalize a
number of relevant cultural practices. In addressing these criticisms, we will
draw attention in particular to alternative models of transformative
mediation such as those proposed and practiced by Mark Umbreit and
various religious groups. We will suggest that any theory of transformative
mediation must of necessity take into consideration the moral beliefs, faith
and religious practices of diverse peoples, so that the reality of conflict in a
pluralist society can be adequately addressed.

In the remainder of this paper, we turn to a model of communication drawn
from the Baha‟i Writings, and practiced in communities of that Faith all
over the world. These teachings identify specific goals for transformation,
including the spiritualization of individual lives and the appearance of unity

in human society. One of the practical methods which, if implemented, will
promote both individual and societal transformation is consultation. We
suggest that this practise, while having much in common with the models of
mediation proposed by Bush and Folger, Umbreit and others, offers
additional insights into human reality and relationships.

Bush and Folger’s Model of Transformative Mediation

The name of transformative mediation is most commonly associated with
the publications of Joseph Folger and Robert Bush. This section examines
two broad aspects of their theory: the goals and the practices of
transformative mediation.

The Goal of Transformation

Underlying all models and practices of mediation, Bush and Folger argue,
are certain basic assumptions about human nature3 particular conceptions of
conflict4 and ideas of what constitutes a „good‟ society5): ultimately, every
mediation rests on an ideological foundation. They note a move away from
the mediation movement‟s origins as an idealistic, non-institutional and
informal dispute resolution process and towards a more institutional, formal
practice which clearly exhibits a „problem-solving‟ orientation to conflict.
This orientation, argue Bush and Folger, reflects and is driven by an
ideology of Individualism, which they define as a view of “the human world
as made of radically individual beings, of equal worth but with different
desires. . . whose nature is to seek satisfaction of those. . . desires”6
Individualism dominates Western thought and culture, underlies its notions
of democracy and motivates its political institutions. Unavoidably and
almost unnoticed, Individualism shapes the goals and practices of
mediation. As a result, mediators habitually employ “oppressive” 7 strategies
- by making global assessments of parties‟ circumstances in terms of
identifiable „problems‟, disregarding aspects of the conflict (such as
emotions and feelings) which cannot be treated as problems, and orienting
their efforts towards facilitating acceptable settlements8

In contrast, Bush and Folger advocate a Relational framework which
distinguishes itself from Individualism in that it “sees the world as
containing *both* the plurality of individual selves and the (potential) unity
made up of the network of their relationships”9 Bush and Folger distinguish
two human capabilities in particular which contribute to this latter aspect of
the Relational ideology, and they call these “empowerment” and

“recognition”. In brief, the empowerment entails greater awareness of one‟s
own goals, options, abilities, resources and ability to make conscious
decisions for one‟s self10 Recognition, conversely, involves the exercise of a
complementary appreciation of the other‟s situation: it is the realization of
the capacity and will to consider, reflect on and acknowledge, in words and
actions, that other‟s point of view

Bush and Folger argue that the development of these two capabilities of
empowerment and recognition is what constitutes true moral growth - it is in
fact the essence of individual transformation. Ideally, neither one of these
aspects should be developed in isolation from the other. Together and
integrated with each other, they constitute “compassionate strength”, which
the authors identify with the highest mode of human behaviour11

Moreover, Bush and Folger relate individual transformation to a larger goal:
the transformation of society itself. Whereas other types of mediation seek
to change the situations people find themselves in, transformative
mediation12

> involves changing. . . people themselves, and thus the society as a
> whole. It aims at creating „a better world,‟ not just in the sense of a
> more smoothly or fairly working version of what now exists but in
> the sense of a different kind of world altogether.

The Practice of Mediation

To summarize Bush and Folger‟s thought, we may say that mediation
practice reflects and proceeds from an orientation to conflict, which
ultimately rests on an ideological foundation. The ideology which most
completely and truly reflects the human world is called the Relational
framework; the orientation which rests upon it believes that the purpose of
conflict is individual transformation. What remains to be seen is the
particular discursive practices which follow from such an orientation.

From a practice perspective, Bush and Folger assert that “third-party
influence [is] inevitable”13 the form which that influence takes is what
distinguishes a transformative mediation from any other. Starting from the
belief that people‟s concerns and conflicts represent “opportunities for
human growth and transformation”14, that is, for the exercise and
development of empowerment and recognition, Bush and Folger propose a
set of specific mediator moves which they argue will facilitate this process.

Bush and Folger advocate a number of third-party interventions - the
“hallmarks of transformative practice”15 - which can be grouped under three
headings. The first of these is the “micro assessment of parties moves” 16.
They suggest, for example, that parties should be encouraged to explore
their feelings, as well as any confusion or uncertainty about what the
conflict is about or what they want17, since these are all opportunities for
empowerment and recognition. Mediators are encouraged to see that “the
action is in the room”, that the here and now is what matters most and that a
conflict unfolds in mediation; and this furthermore encourages discussions
of the past as they affect the present18 Moreover, mediators must
consciously suspend judgment on the motives and intentions of the parties,
being aware of their own relative ignorance of the „full picture‟19 Bush and
Folger suggest that a close and clear focus on the specific statements of
parties will yield opportunities for transformation which a more future-
oriented, global vision of the conflict will not: this means that the mediator
will adopt a “responsive posture”20

The second “key element” of transformative mediation practice is
“encouraging parties‟ deliberation and choice-making”21 This is manifested
in a variety of ways - in the mediator‟s opening statement, which will
emphasis this as a goal of the mediation22, as well as in particular instances
when the mediator will call the parties‟ attention to an opportunity for
empowerment or recognition and leave it to the parties to decide whether or
not they will take it up23 Finally, the third element of transformative
mediation sees mediators encouraging parties to consider each others‟
perspectives24 again this will appear as a goal in the opening statement, as
well as being a constant feature of third party interventions throughout the
mediation whenever emotions, confusion, disagreement occur.

Aside from these practical guidelines, Folger and Bush emphasize that
transformative mediation must be the genuine outcome of a Relational
ideology and approach to conflict. The mediator will therefore be
consistently optimistic about the parties‟ motives, competence and ability to
“deal with their own situation on their own terms”25 Equally importantly,
success, however small, must be registered in both the mediator‟s and the
parties‟ minds, since this will encourage commitment to the process of
transformation26

Transformative Mediation: A Critical View

Transformative mediation, as presented by Bush and Folger, has been
greeted with both excitement and dismay. This section summarizes and
evaluates the main objections to their work, and considers some alternative
visions of transformation in mediation by way of response.

Criticism of Bush and Folger

Criticisms of Bush and Folger‟s model of transformative mediation address
both the theory and practice of mediation. Dealing with the practical first,
several critics have disputed Bush and Folger‟s view that the goal of
transformation requires entirely eschewing the problem-solving aspect of
mediation. Carrie Menkel-Meadow objects to “the kinds of simplistic
taxonomies that academic critics ... love to create that simply do not ring
true for many practitioners”27. Michael Williams concludes from his own
experience that it is possible “for a skilled mediator to discuss the issues, try
to find solutions to specific problems, and at the same time try to help his
clients toward Transformation”28 Alison Taylor, writing on neutrality, also
suggests that while there are “two distinct ends of the ethical practice of
mediation ... *strict neutrality* [and] *expanded neutrality*”29,
“[p]ractitioners are seldom unidimensional, and we need not make forced
choices as if there were only two ways of mediating” 30 The extreme position
adopted by Bush and Folger against a solution-oriented approach thus
appears impractical and even dangerous from the perspective of practicing
mediators.

These critics have also expressed alarm at the kinds of third-party
interventions transformative mediation appears to require. Whereas Bush
and Folger assume the inevitability of mediator participation in the
unfolding conflict31, and attempt to limit the directiveness of the mediator
accordingly, some commentators find their suggested interventions just as
oppressive as those in „problem-solving‟ mediation - or more so. Menkel-
Meadow finds Bush and Folger “remarkably judgmental and conclusionary
about . . . other models of mediation”32, although they “have created a
model which simply relocates the directiveness of mediators”33. And
Williams suggest that contractual and ethical principles require that

Sara Cobb, among others, agrees, cf. Cobb S, “A Narrative Perspective on Mediation” in Folger JP &
Jones TS (eds) New Directions in Mediation (1994) London, Sage Publications, p.52

Op. Cit. p.237

Ibid: 238
mediators respect the parties‟ choice: “if clients seek a practical, down-to-
earth agreement on specific issues, we should help them to attain it”34.

Last among practical considerations is a question of proof: have Bush and
Folger adequately demonstrated that transformative mediation works, even
within its own terms of reference? Neal Milner answers in the negative, and
finds the examples of transformative mediation in The Promise of Mediation
unsatisfactory and disappointing35. Williams argues that a drive towards
transformative mediation by the mediator is self-defeating in that it
disempowers the parties36. Menkel-Meadow similarly asks how parties can
be empowered when no solution to their problems is found37, and finds it
“astonishing” that Bush and Folger suggest that, in her own words, “people
are easier to change than situations”38

Fewer critics address the theory behind transformative mediation; this is
probably partly because the natural focus of practitioners is practice and
partly because the goals of empowerment and recognition feature in many
kinds of mediation, and the difference is to some extent one of degree.
Nevertheless, there are some telling points made even here. Finding fault
with the political analysis which underlies Bush and Folger‟s work, for
example, Milner refutes their assertion that a Relational ideology is
emergent; rather, he adduces evidence to demonstrate the continued vitality
of Individualism39.

More importantly, both Milner and Menkel-Meadow find Bush and Folger‟s
vision culturally limited. Menkel-Meadow expresses this aptly:

> ... mediation is deeply contextual and, when situated in different
> environments and institutions, it will perform different social tasks.
> Bush and Folger attempt a meta-level explanation for mediation that
> simply will not work. Transformative mediation is a concept that is
> both vague and, at the same time, presumptuous; it is insensitive to
> social conditions and - dare I say? - too ethnocentric to reach all
> mediations.40

Milner is more particular about his criticism on this point. He begins by
arguing that transformative mediation is as inextricably bound up in the
North American mediation culture as the problem-solving approach it
opposes41 He notes, for example, that the mediator is assumed to be a

stranger to the parties. This is much less likely in other cultures, he states,
where conflict resolution is also “often more fluid, less linear, less directly
concerned with staying on point, and more likely to be handled by someone
who is familiar to the conflicting parties”42.

Moreover, Milner suggests that Bush and Folger have overlooked important
evidence which would support the transformative vision‟s claims to
universal application, but which would also make explicit its spiritual
debt43. Intentional or not, it is true that the authors have neglected
consideration of “some religiously based arguments for peacemaking that
support the idea that joint work on a conflict heightens moral capacities and
fosters both a sense of self and a regard for others”44. It is to these
alternative models of transformative mediation that we now turn.

Response: Alternative Visions of Transformative Mediation

Notwithstanding criticism of Bush and Folger‟s particular formulation of
transformative mediation, the idea that conflict represents an opportunity for
moral growth is popular and pervasive. It is not uncommon to find reference
in mediation literature to concepts of empowerment, respect and faith in
parties‟ ability to resolve their disputes45. Mediators such as Albie Davis
refer to the “„transformative‟ power of mediation”46. Kolb and Kressel name
a significant number of prominent mediators among those who “define their
work in transformative terms”47, where this means “empower[ing]
community members, further[ing] the goal of citizen participation, and
set[ting] standards for responding to the current world challenge of ethnic,
tribal, and cultural disputes”.48

Clearly, Bush and Folger do not have a monopoly on the definition of
transformative mediation. We now consider some alternative visions which
address some of the criticisms outlined above.

Mark Umbreit’s ‘Humanistic’ Mediation

Mark Umbreit begins his presentation of „humanistic‟ mediation from a
premise similar to Bush and Folger‟s - that mediation can offer something
more than mere settlement:

Idem. It is worth noting here that Kolb and Kressel express skepticism about claims about the
transformative power of mediation

> Mediation can move toward a higher level of practice which can
> intentionally and more consistently tap into its transformative and
> healing powers. These healing powers are intrinsic to the process of
> mediating conflict between individuals but need to be consciously
> drawn out and utilized.49

Umbreit sees potential in mediation for “a genuine transformative journey
of peacemaking that is grounded in compassion, strength, and our common
humanity”50. Here then is a model whose aspirations to universal application
are explicit. Although Umbreit clearly excludes certain kinds of disputes
from its ambit, he nevertheless considers the majority of conflicts to be
susceptible to a process based on “an opening of the heart through genuine
dialogue, empowerment, and a recognition of each party‟s humanity despite
the conflict”51 Umbreit‟s approach is distinct in grounding itself in both the
insights of Western cultural models of mediation, as well as the “skills and .
. . life perspective”52 of non-Western, indigenous cultures (It is of interest
here that Umbreit has been influenced by the New Zealand Family Group
Conference model of restorative justice, among other things). He thus
avoids the temptation to privilege any one form of mediation practice over
another.

Indeed, Umbreit acknowledges a debt to Bush and Folger53. While he avoids
specifically criticizing their contributions, however, he clearly moves
beyond their model to present a less rigid yet practical model of mediation.
Like them, he identifies power in the parties and sees value in feelings and
emotions54. Rather than providing a detailed political framework for his
model, he begins from a set of values which are fundamental to humanistic
mediation: in fact, these values suggest a rich metaphysical tradition and
belief system such as is found in many indigenous societies. They include,
for example, a “belief in the connectedness of all things”; in “the desire of
most people to live peacefully . . . to draw upon inner reservoirs of strength
to overcome adversity . . . [and] to grow through life experiences”; and in
“the inherent dignity and self-determination that arise from embracing
conflict directly”55. Addressing the issue of third-party intervention,
Umbreit acknowledges “the importance of the mediator‟s presence and
connectedness with the involved parties”. Umbreit thus embraces a
“paradigm of healing” that rests on “a profound recognition of the precious
gift of human existence, relationships, community, and the deeper spiritual

connectedness among all of us in our collective journey through this life,
regardless of our many religious, cultural, political, and lifestyle
differences”56

Flowing from this framework of „healing‟, Umbreit suggests a number of
practice implications; for the purposes of this essay, it will be necessary to
mention only a few of these. Foremost among his suggestions are those
which focus on the role of the mediator, and here Umbreit‟s model reveals
its underlying spiritual concerns. He writes, for example, that

> ..[p]rior to initiating contact between people in conflict, the
> mediator(s) is encouraged to take a few moments of silence, through
> reflection, meditation, or prayer, to reflect on the deeper meaning of
> his or her peacemaking work and the needs of the people in
> conflict.57

This process of “centering” should continue throughout the mediation,
reminding the mediator of the spiritual connectedness of all people58. The
mediator concentrates her efforts on helping the parties to “understand and
respect their differences and to arrive at a mutually acceptable way to deal
with those differences”59 (Idem), and will deliberately remove herself at
times from the dialogue between the parties60 (Idem). She will moreover
take steps to “connect” with the parties. This in turn requires “congruence”
on the part of the mediator, which is defined as “a condition of being
emotionally honest with yourself in which there is consistency in your
words, feelings, body and facial expressions, and your actions”61. Such an
approach engenders a feeling of trust in the parties, which careful coaching
on communication skills as well as a nondirective style of mediation
reinforce62. Once again, Umbreit suggests that mediation can become a
spiritual tool connecting people with themselves, with each other and with
their beliefs63

Summing Up: Religion and Transformation

In his critique of Bush and Folger, Neal Milner suggests that certain
affinities exist between their work and the mediation practice of a number of
religious groups. In particular, he mentions the Quakers and Mennonites as
examples of traditions “so strong, so much on point, so thoroughly based on
practice, and already so much a part of the secular mediation community . . .

that they [deserve] some attention”64. The Mennonite Conciliation Service,
for example, describes its own activities as nurturing “the transformation of
conflicts and the people involved in them by developing and promoting
resources, providing referral and direct mediation and consultation services,
holding training and educational events, and developing networks”65 .

While noting that Bush and Folger have unhappily failed to note non-secular
transformative mediation practices, Neal Milner suggests that this approach
has certain advantages66 He refers for example to the contentiousness of the
religion and morality debate, and infers that they avoid such controversy in
order to widen their audience base67. Nevertheless, he judges their omission
of religiously-based arguments for transformative mediation a serious flaw,
and we would have to agree.

On a global scale, moreover, there are even more compelling reasons to take
into account religious models of mediation. If we are to take the
„peacemaking‟ claims of mediation seriously, it should be broadly
applicable. Menkel-Meadow is correct in saying that “mediation is deeply
contextual and, when situated in different environments and institutions, it
will perform different social tasks”, and she is right to fault Bush and
Folger‟s model with being too restrictive and ethnocentric68 Moreover, the
religious controversy Milner cites is largely restricted to the American
context: other societies, where the state-religion separation is less central to
political concerns, would see this is a non-issue. On the contrary, the large
majority of the world‟s peoples continue to regard some form of religion or
spirituality as central to their existence. Surely a project such as Umbreit‟s,
which seeks to wed secular concerns with religious beliefs in a common
project of „peacemaking‟, is worthy of effort. We would only add here that
an even broader basis for mediation practices must be sought among all the
major religious communities if we are to expect significant transformative
effects to follow.

The Baha’i Concept of Consultation

The Baha‟i Faith is one such religious community in which conflict-
resolution takes place within a context of individual and social
transformation69. This practice, known as consultation, aims to address

some as an obscure, tiny sect is now recognized by the Encyclopedia Britannica as the second-most widely spread
independent religion in the world, after Christianity.” http://info.bahai.org/article-1-6-0-1.html [Last accessed

conflicting perspectives within a framework of spiritual transformation. The
fundamental principles of consultation were established by Baha‟u‟llah, the
Prophet-Founder of the Baha‟i Faith (1917-1892), and have since been
elaborated, interpreted and elucidated by his eldest son `Abdu‟l-Baha (1844-
1921), his great-grandson Shoghi Effendi (1897-1957), and the Universal
House of Justice, the Supreme Baha‟i Institution (first elected 1963). The
following description of consultation has been primarily drawn from these
authoritative sources, although numerous references to the subject can be
found in Baha‟i literature of a secondary nature.70

A Programme for Transformation

According to Baha‟u‟llah, the fundamental purpose of every Revelation
from God has been “to effect a transformation in the whole character of
mankind, a transformation that shall manifest itself both outwardly and
inwardly, that shall affect both its inner life and external conditions” 71
Fundamental to Baha‟u‟llah‟s programme for the transformation of both
individuals and societies is the recognition of the oneness of humanity - an
acceptance of the principle of unity in diversity. While this principle
implies, among other things, the unity of all races and peoples, the equality
and complementarity of the sexes, and the abolition of all prejudices, Shoghi
Effendi explains its deeper implications: “It implies an organic change in the
structure of present-day society, a change such as the world has not yet
experienced. . . It represents the consummation of human evolution. . .”72

The evolutionary transformation of individuals is inseparably related to that
of society. The Baha‟i teachings state that the human beings are
fundamentally spiritual, but that this spirituality emerges as a result of effort
and education. Baha‟u‟llah thus states: “Regard man as a mine rich in gems
of inestimable value. Education can, alone, cause it to reveal its treasures”73
If these „treasures‟ are virtuous conduct and deeds, it is clear that such

The Baha‟i writings therefore supply principles which address both the
individual and social reality of humanity, each of which is inextricably tied
up in the development of the other. Moreover, a process of growth is
conceived in which the Baha‟i writings illuminate and in turn are
illuminated by the experiences of the Baha‟i commmunity: “many of the
theoretical and practical tasks are left to be accomplished by the growing
Baha‟i community through a global and constant process of consultation
and scholarly inquiry into social reality”75

These two processes of transformation - at micro and macro levels - meet in
the practice of consultation.

Consultation in Theory:Application and Purpose

The Baha‟i writings on consultation emphasize its universal application.
Whether in the work of Baha‟i administration76, commerce77, family
affairs78, or purely personal matters79, consultation is regarded as a “lamp of
guidance which leadeth the way”80. Indeed, Shoghi Effendi called “the spirit
of frank and loving consultation” the “keynote” of the Baha‟i Faith81 and the
“bedrock of this unique Order”82. It is significant to note here that the
Baha‟i Faith has no clergy, and that the administration of its affairs is
entirely conducted by elected councils at the local, national and international
level. In this system, authority is thus vested solely in consultative bodies
and individuals have no decision-making power.

The purpose of consultation is variously expressed as being the
investigation of truth83, to achieve “insight into things”84 and to produce
“the tranquillity and felicity of the people”85. Thus, although “right

solution[s]” are a clearly envisaged outcome of consultation86, agreement is
more important to the process than correctness87. Equal to, or perhaps more
important than, its problem-solving function, consultation is praised for
bestowing “greater awareness”88, and producing “good and well-being”89;
through consultation the “maturity of the gift of understanding is made
manifest”90.

Procedure of Consultation

As in both Umbreit‟s and Bush and Folger‟s models of mediation, the
succesful practice of Baha‟i consultation presupposes certain attitudes and
beliefs. In particular, the Baha‟i writings emphasize that the parties to
consultation must make efforts to detach themselves from predetermined
outcomes. The act of consultation is itself sacred and sanctified; by
preparing for it through prayer and through concentrating their efforts to
manifest spiritual qualities, dialogue is facilitated and confirmations from
the spiritual realm are promised:

> The prime requisites for them that take counsel together are purity of
> motive, radiance of spirit, detachment from all else save God,
> attraction to His Divine Fragrances, humility. . . amongst His loved
> ones, patience and long-suffering. . . and servitude. . . Should they be
> graciously aided to acquire these attributes, victory from the unseen
> Kingdom of Baha [glory] shall be vouchsafed to them.91

An important aspect of consultation is the emphasis placed on the decision-
making power of the collective or group. The group should welcome the
views of all, including “the most lowly, untutored and inexperienced”92.
Individuals are encouraged to express their opinions openly “without being
afraid of displeasing or alienating”93 anyone; differing viewpoints are
encouraged, since “[t]hrough the clash of personal opinions. . . the spark of
truth is often ignited”94. But this frankness must be tempered with “the
utmost devotion, courtesy, dignity, care and moderation”95. Moreover, each
should offer her opinion to the group as a gift, and “not insist. . . for
stubbornness and persistence in one‟s views will lead ultimately to discord
and wrangling and the truth will remain hidden”96. Thus the parties in
consultation are called upon to focus on the issues, and not on personalities.

„Abdu‟l-Bahá, in ibid. p.95

In certain kinds of consultation, a decision may be reached by vote, and
unanimity is preferred, though not essential. The practice of Baha‟i
consultation therefore nurtures a new social outlook which emphasizes unity
- albeit while preserving a diversity of viewpoints, opinions and approaches.

Consultation likewise affects individuals in a transformative manner. The
Baha‟i writings acknowledge the numerous complications and difficulties in
frank consultation that arise out of the need to:

> …”reconcile the principles of mercy and justice, of freedom and
> submission, of the sanctity of the right of the individual and of self-
> surrender, of vigilance, discretion and prudence on the one hand and
> fellowship, candour and courage on the other.”97

In a way, these are the real dilemmas facing every individual involved in
conflict. The process of consultation thus requires a constant examination of
one‟s motives and conscious adjustment of one‟s behaviour in conformity
with principle. Whereas most models of mediation envisage the intervention
of a third party, consultation assumes that each party is engaged in a
personal process of reflection and self-examination in light of the Baha‟i
writings. Over time, this endeavour will gradually induce a spiritual
transformation of character.

Finally, the Baha‟i concept of consultation recognizes that a perfect decision
may not be a practical possibility in every case98, and that the act of
consultation is not separable from the context of relationships and society as
a whole. Therefore, the form of each consultation, the parties concerned,
and the advice of experts are all matters in respect of which “rigidity should
be avoided”99.

Consultation in Practice

To understand how consultation might apply to real situations, we take as an
example from Columbia an initially small Baha‟i community which
experienced rapid and sudden growth in numbers in the 1970s. The authors
of a study of this development write that reactions to the growth were
mixed. Whereas some Baha‟is were exhilarated by the sudden growth and
wanted to „push on‟, others felt that the expansion should be put on hold
indefinitely until the new believers had been consolidated. There thus
existed conflicting views of which the Baha‟i principle of unity required a
resolution. Nevertheless, the authors of the study do not indicate a pre-
determined „right‟ or „wrong‟ answer: rather, they indicate that the solution
was left to be „discovered‟ through consultation:

Shoghi Effendi in ibid, p.101

`Abdu‟l-Baha, in ibid., p.96

Universal House of Justice, in ibid., p. 109

> Regular meetings of consultation were called to explore the diverse
> elements of a more unified vision of teaching. Every effort was made
> to prevent these consultations from being reduced to mere expression
> of differing opinions and tiring analysis of abstractions. The
> community was constantly reminded that it was viewing the very
> complex process of the growth of the Faith in an entire country, and
> that any one of them would only be able to see a few aspects of this
> process the lens of their own understanding and experience. But
> limited understanding could not persist in the form of personal
> opinions once the process had been viewed through different lenses;
> sooner or later, a new and more complete vision, to be shared by all,
> had to be formulated and adopted.100

Interpreted, this passage suggests that the process of consultation enabled all
parties to transcend their individual perspectives; not one of the viewpoints
was complete and correct. There is evidence here of effort to move beyond
empty debate; of acknowledgment of the importance of bringing different
understandings and experiences to shed light on the matter; and of the
ultimate goal of achieving a new, more holistic vision. The authors suggest
that: “As the believers in Columbia matured in their ability to consult, they
began to advance rapidly towards the unity of thought and vision they so
ardently desired”101.

This narrative of events in Columbia further describes how this process of
consultation was continued “in unshakable unity and with a spirit of utmost
humility”102, always aiming at “the objective analysis of possible courses of
action and the evaluation of methods and results, all carried out in light of
the Writings of the Faith” (Idem). In this manner the community, although
consisting of diverse individuals with differing points of view, was able to
reach a workable degree of unity on such matters as the role of the Baha‟i
„teacher‟ in the expansion of the Faith103, the content of the first message
that was to be presented104, and the structure and substance of educational
programmes designed to deepen the knowledge of the new Baha‟is105.

Clearly this case-study has not provided analysis the particular „moves‟ of
third-party interveners, nor suggested practical steps to take in every
situation. Indeed, the nature of consultation is such that it is adaptable to
diverse situations. The detailing of such specifics would tend to establish a
set of standard „techniques‟, which would undermine the inherent flexibility
of consultation - as well as, according to Umbreit, to „humanistic‟

mediation106. Nor does the above narrative suggest that the same process
would or does take place in the same way in every community. Clearly,
cultural differences in and across individuals, institutions and communities
necessitate a „unity in diversity‟ of approaches to the application of the
principles of consultation.

Conclusions: Mediating Approaches to Transformation

This essay has surveyed two representative types of transformative
mediation which have received some notice in the mediation community.
The first - and by far the best-known - of these is the model discussed and
advocated by Bush and Folger in their various publications. Central to their
work is the idea that transformation of individuals can take place by
developing their capacities for recognition and empowerment, and that
mediation provides an excellent opportunity for this. Their work has
received criticism, however, for its narrowness on two counts: on the one
hand, practitioners argue that their model has limited application and
disregards too many legitimate goals and practices in mediation; on the
other hand, their political theory has been criticized as unsupported at best
and culturally biased at worst. Despite this, we support their central intuition
that mediation offers more than mere problem-solving.

Mark Umbreit‟s model of „humanistic mediation‟ is less well-known - or
less notorious. His important contribution is recognize that there are non-
secular forces at play in communication, and especially in the conflict
resolution practices of traditional and indigenous societies. His model
therefore acknowledges the fundamental connectedness of all people, and
assigns a more spiritual role to mediation practice.

Finally, the Baha‟i practice of consultation goes one step further in affirming
the spiritual realities affecting conflict resolution. Certainly, consultation
may be criticized by some as too vague and insubstantial, unsupported by
political or social theory and unsuited to, for example, American society,
where faith is viewed with suspicion and ethnic and religious differences are
highly politicized.

Nevertheless, the Baha‟i framework certainly defines a goal for
transformation that affirms the connectedness of all people without
disregarding the importance of the individual, and which is less vague than
others we have considered. Consultation provides a context and framework
for the practical application of spiritual principles, and thus encourages the
manifestation of virtuous behaviour by individuals and groups. Moreover, it
establishes a process based on principle, is therefore not rigid and is widely
applied in the Baha‟i world. The fact that the same model *is* used in
Baha‟i communities in over 200 countries indicates this flexibility and may

Umbreit op.cit., p.202

give pause to consider what insights may be gained from a deeper
investigation into its premises and application.

For mediation to remain a vital and expanding field , it will be necessary to
conduct much more inquiry into the various extant models of
communication that share with it either conceptual or practical affinities. In
particular, mediation has often been thought of as a secular practice, and
perhaps this is due to the origins of the modern mediation movement in
North America in the 1960s and 1970s. Studies into the conflict resolution
behaviour of Jewish, Buddhist, Hindu, Islamic and other religious groups
would surely shed light on mediation practices. Certainly, a dialogue
between all these groups and „secular‟ mediation would be mutually
illuminating. We hope that by comparing transformative mediation models
with Baha‟i consultation we have suggested how such a dialogue might
begin.
