## Church and State: A Postmodern Theology, Book One

> **About** (from [kalimat.com](http://www.kalimat.com/churchandstate.html)): This is a political theology for the Bahá'í Faith, but it is also a philosophy for living in our globalized, post-modern society. The author investigates the Bahá'í teachings concerning the separation of "Church" and State.
> 
> Government, religion, commerce, art, education, and science are increasingly independent, have different social functions, relate differently to one another, and have different meanings for us today. This functional differentiation also drives the pluralism, relativism, and global scope of our post-modern society. In a society such as ours, in which religious ritual is the mirror of individual distinctiveness, not of collective identity, in which permanent pluralism means that no one religion can provide common norms and values, and in which the values of one sphere of life are not transferred to other spheres, religion must find a new role in society.
> 
> The twentieth century has taught us that economic affairs cannot be governed by political ideologies, that science must be free of doctrine, that the dignity and autonomy of the individual must be respected, and that church and state must be separated.
> 
> This is a political theology for the Bahá'í Faith, but it is also a philosophy for living in our globalized, post-modern society. The author investigates the Bahá'í teachings concerning the separation of "Church" and State. This is an exhaustive review of Bahá'í literature on the subject, but the book also inquires into the scriptures of both Christianity and Islam to find that the separations of state from religion is a universal ideal.

É
Foreword
This book presents my own understanding of the Bahai1 teachings on some issues that
are now critically important to the Bahai community and its relations with the world.
My approach has been enriched by my Christian background and education, my
studies of theology and church history at Knox Theological Hall and Holy Cross
Seminary in Dunedin, New Zealand, and studies of Persian and Islamic Studies at
Leiden University, in the Netherlands.

I should declare at the outset that my stance is not that of a historian or
academic scholar of the science of religion, but of a Bahai theologian, writing from
and for a religious community, and I speak as if the reader shares the concerns of that
community. As a Bahai theologian, I seek to criticize, clarify, purify and strengthen
the ideas of the Bahai community, to enable Bahais to understand their relatively new
faith and to see what it can offer the world. The approach is not value-free. I would
be delighted if the Bahai Faith proved to have a synergy with post-modernity, if it
prospered in the coming decades and had an influence on the world. The reader who
is used to academic studies of religion that avoid such value judgements will have to
make the necessary adjustments here and there. I do not however write as an
apologist: the goal is a serious study that can aid the Bahai community and others to
discover the potential for contemporary religious life which lies within the Bahai
scriptures, rather than simply to repackage the Bahai Faith in a palatable form for
present needs.

I should also say that I place myself somewhere towards the progressive end
of the contemporary Bahai spectrum, in other words, that I feel quite at home in a
differentiated, pluralistic, individualistic and globally integrating world, and I hope
and expect to see post-modern society prosper. At the other end of the spectrum, there
is a very different Bahai discourse which regards a postmodern society as a
non-viable option since – according to traditionalist ideas of a ‘what society is’ –
differentiation and individualism are symptoms of the disintegration of society.
Rather than looking forward to an unpredictable synergy with postmodernism, a
really new world order, the conservative Bahai discourse hopes to re-establish a
society in the traditional sense, once the progressive disintegration of society, as they
perceive it, has run its course. The reader should be aware, then, that this is only one
among the competing discourses within the contemporary western Bahai community.

Since this book is a reexamination of the Bahai teachings that are relevant to

the art of politics in its broadest sense, I presume some knowledge of previous
interpretations of the Bahai writings, of the central figures of the Bahai Faith, and the
institutions of the Bahai community. A list of introductory and reference works on the
Bahai Faith is provided at the end of the book.

As a theologian rather than a political scientist I am interested in principles
rather than political mechanisms or history, and particularly in how those principles
relate to the nature of the Kingdom and ultimately to the nature of God. Topical
applications of these principles are a separate question. The theological principles
will undoubtedly need to be supplemented from both practical experience and
detailed historical research. It is to be hoped that my intellectual and spiritual debts,
and my leaning towards theological rather than historical analysis, have been the
source of selective enrichment, rather than bias. The reader is, at any rate, forewarned.

The views offered here are not an authoritative view of the Bahai teachings, nor
a definitive statement of my own views on these topics. These are samples from a
work in progress, born out of an ongoing argument with myself. It is published now
rather than at some other time partly because I have achieved a degree of certainty
that at least the broad lines of these ideas do accurately represent the Bahai teachings,
but chiefly because the issues dealt with here have become so pressing for the well-
being of the Bahai communities in the west, and offer such potential for fruitful
dialogue with the Jewish, Christian and Muslim traditions, that a start must be made.

The present volume has been self-published as part of the requirements for a
Master’s degree, and would in several respects be different if it was a more formal
and market-oriented publication. The extensive literature review in the fifth chapter
is de rigeur for a dissertation, but can hardly be made thrilling reading. The general
reference system for the Bahai scriptures and the writings of Shoghi Effendi, using
paragraph numbers rather than page numbers, was being introduced during the
writing, but has not been used, although it is desirable that it should be speedily
adopted for all academic work. The editions of Bahai scriptures cited are those I
happen to have, not the first or most recent or most widely used. Primary sources in
translation have generally been checked against the originals, but not in every case,
and not at all in the case of the Bible. Time has not allowed a proper treatment of the
church-state relationship in the late Ottoman empire, which is probably as relevant as
the relationship in Shiah (Sh§ ca) Iran, an adequate treatment of Jewish or Christian
political theologies, or a proper comparison with the ideas of contemporary Islamic
modernists.

The title ‘church and state’ will appear strange to most Bahai readers, since the
Bahai faith is an independent religion born from Shiah Islam, not a church. However

F OREWORD 3

‘church and state studies’ is the accepted name of a field of study which is not
confined to Christianity. There is, for example, a Journal of Church and State, and
research schools on the topic. These deal with the general issue of the relationship
between organised religion and the institutional part of political life, while placing
both of these within the vague field of less organised life (religiosity and civil
society) and relating them to other disciples such as law and sociology. As we will
see, much of what Baha’u’llah (Bah~’u’ll~h) and Abdu’l-Baha (cAbdu’l-Bah~ ) teach
on the issue is not specific to the Bahai Faith, but refers to the role of religion,
religions, or leaders of religion in general. So ‘church and state’ is the best term
available, just because it has become universalised. It is also Effendi’s choice, when
observing Shiah Iran:

> ... in the slow and hidden process of secularization ... a discerning eye
> can easily discover the symptoms that augur well for a future that is sure
> to witness the formal and complete separation of Church and State.2

A second reason for using the term ‘church’ is that there is no ready word available
for the Bahai equivalent of ‘church,’ because Bahais, unlike Christians, have multiple
religious institutions that are specialised to different functions. If I use the term
‘House of Justice’ I have left out the appointed institutions, if I talk of the
‘Administrative Order’ I have still left out the Mashriqu’l-Adhkar (Mashriqu’l-
Adhk~r), and by doing so I might overlook important questions. Does the interface
between the religious order and the political order in the Bahai model of society pass
primarily through the House of Justice, or the Administrative Order including the
appointed institutions? Or through the Mashriqu’l-Adhkar and its dependencies? Or
all of these? The use of the admittedly inapplicable word ‘church’ for all of the
structures of the Bahai community leaves these questions open.

of some of the chapters have been published (see the bibliography) and to the

Introduction
Transitions and translations
In the first and most astonishing of the transitions which mark its history, the cool and
universal rationality of the Bahai Faith arose out of the messianic fervour of the Babi
(B~b§ ) movement, in 19th-century Iran, like Venus on the foam. At a time of
tyrannical, arbitrary and authoritarian governments, its founder, Baha’u’llah (1817-
1892), and his son Abdu’l-Baha (1844-1921) preached the virtues of constitutional
government, the rule of law, democracy and the separation of organised religion from
the institutions of the state. In a climate of cultural and religious obscurantism which,
in reaction to the impact of the west, sought to turn Iran’s back to the world, they
combined a readiness to accept the best from any culture or civilization with a
consciousness of their own heritage in the ancient and rich culture of Iran. At a time
when the battles of the lately rediscovered clash of religious civilizations were
already raging around them, they preached the peace of transcendence rather than of
conquest.

Although they sought to keep some distance from the immediate political
action, the political relevance of their message was not lost on their contemporaries.
They were exiled from place to place, as prisoners of the Shah (Sh~h) and then of the
Ottoman Sultan, ultimately reaching the prison city of Akka (cAkk~ ) in Palestine.
When Baha’u’llah died near the city in 1892 he was still technically a prisoner and
an exile.

Abdu’l-Baha, who was just 9 years old when he first went into exile with his
father, was not free to travel until the Young Turk rebellion of 1908 overthrew the
Sultanate. When he was free, he travelled to Europe and North America. With these
travels, the Bahai Faith made the second of its major transitions. In the East, where
Iran had been going through a period of unrest culminating in its Constitutional
Revolution, Abdu’l-Baha had written on the virtues of constitutional government and
the need to moderate the power of the monarchy and the clergy. In the West, he spoke
against cultural parochialism in France, met the suffragettes and free thinkers of the
United Kingdom, opposed the nascent ideology of fascism in Europe, and in the
United States spoke extensively on liberty, economic justice, the equality of men and
women, and the abolition of racial prejudices. His gift to the Bahai community of his
time was a set of clearly enunciated principles relevant to current social and political
issues, for North America too was making a painful transition, into the industrialized
age. The West was wrestling with the question of how much of the bright vision of
the Enlightenment it could bring with it through that historical divide, and how it
could be applied in the changed circumstances of a modern society. Abdu’l-Baha

6 INTRODUCTION

could not be said to present a political programme, but the political understanding he
offered was certainly current.

For the next several decades, the shape and destiny of the Bahai Faith lay
largely in the hands of the English-speaking, particularly North American, believers.
They had the freedom to travel, the means, the international vision and the
organizational culture to build up some of the religious institutions that Baha’u’llah
had envisioned, and to scatter outposts of the Bahai community around the globe.
During this period the Bahai teachings were recast, with the emphasis on those
elements which were of vital importance to the unity and health of the rapidly-
growing community. The questions which will be particularly addressed in this book
were then of lesser importance, and were neglected entirely or were treated in ways
which, in the light of the questions facing human society in the new millennium, are
now inadequate. For it is my contention that the Bahai Faith and the global society
of which it is part are passing through another transition, and one which requires that
the Bahai teachings should again be recast to focus on questions about the nature of
liberty, of good governance and the civil society, of human rights and social
responsibilities, of the place of religion in this society and in our lives. The functional
differentiation of society, which is the dynamic underlying the pluralism, global scope
and individualisation of society, is producing a society which is different in kind to
anything the world has seen before. We cannot simply take an old model of ‘what a
society is,’ whether taken from Greek philosophy, The City of God, or Durkheim’s
sociology, and insert the Bahai Faith into the now empty socket where religion
‘belongs,’ because that position no longer exists in a society in which religious ritual
is the mirror of individual distinctiveness, not of collective identity, in which lasting
pluralism means that no religion can attain the position of arbiter of common norms
and values, and above all, in a society that has painfully learned, over the course of
the 20th century, to see the wholesale transferal of norms from one sphere of life to
another as the source of all evil. Economic affairs cannot be governed by political
ideologies, science must be free of doctrine and political agendas, and politics should
not be allowed to shelter under the umbrella of religion.

It seems undeniable to me that Bahai theology has to be reformulated in the
present situation, if the Bahai Faith is to remain meaningful. However the aim of this
book is not simply defensive. The purpose of producing a post-modern Bahai political
theology is not to show that it can be done, to prove that the Bahai Faith or religion
in general might outlive the secularisation thesis, but rather pastoral. A post-modern
political theology should actually help people to function in the post-modern world.
I believe that the Bahai writings, because they are not formulated in terms of the pre-

INTRODUCTION 7

modern model of a stratified but theoretically monist society, offer a variety of
religious repertories that can help to make sense of the predicaments people face in
a contemporary differentiated society. They allow us to reinterpret the differentiation
of our experience into life-worlds, and the diversity that we experience in the cultural
and religious spheres, not as signs of something wrong in the universe, but rather as
the way things are meant to be. Differentiation and diversity in the human microcosm
can be felt as a reflection of the differentiation and diversity of the cosmos, for unicity
and singleness are to be found only in another realm which we can never enter, in the
Godhead itself. All the worlds below – including the world of religion – are the
realms of multiplicity, and therefore of ambiguity and doubt, and this is as it should
be.

There is a large measure of continuity in the Bahai Faith, in as much as it is a
Faith focussed on, and defined by, the persons and writings of Baha’u’llah and
Abdu’l-Baha. But there is also a continual need for reformulation, refocusing, and
translation into the terminology of a changing world. This book is intended to be
another step in that process. While I argue against most previous formulations of the
Bahai teachings on church and state, I do not deny the debt that we owe to earlier
generations of Bahais.

About this book
This book has been limited to the relationship between church and state, because it
is written within the framework of a Master’s course in Islamic studies which allows
only one year for writing the dissertation. It is intended to be the first volume in a
larger work, including other aspects of Bahai political theology such as the
institutions and principles of the religious community (the equivalent of
ecclesiology), the relationship between the individual and the collective, and the
nature of religious law in the Bahai system. The common thread for this political
theology is the theme of organic unity, a metaphor so often misused that it must
immediately be defended.

Society has been presented as something analogous to a body, and as an
organic unity, since the Babylonian empire and perhaps earlier. This metaphor has
supported the power of the powerful, the subordination of the weak, the extension of
the ruler’s power to every aspect of life, and the secondary importance of individuals.
The body of society has been pictured as having one heart (or in modern times, one
brain), with all the parts existing only to serve the will of the centre. The organs and
limbs should therefore work in harmony, under direction. This is a fascist model of
society, by which I intend not mere name-calling, but a literal reference to that

8 INTRODUCTION

political philosophy that is embodied in the image of the fasces bound together, and
the motto ‘strength in unity.’

I would like to reclaim the metaphor of society as a body for a new purpose,
in the first place by inviting the reader to conduct a thought experiment: let your brain
instruct your heart to cease operations for a moment. The least reflection shows that
the fascist interpretation of the ‘body politic’ is based on pure fiction. Our bodies
function without one organ commanding. The brain may not know of, let alone
understand and control, the operations of other organs. Our bodies, the very model
of organic unity, consist of distinct organs, each functioning autonomously according
to its own internal logic, each affecting the others, and each needing the others to be
fully itself. The liver, for instance, cannot do its alchemy of purification without the
flow of blood from the heart; the heart cannot pump unless the blood is both purified
and oxygenated. The harmony of the parts cannot be attributed to the command of any
one organ: it derives from a transcendent and indefinable property, ‘being a being,’
a quality that cannot be located, but cannot be denied. Reinterpreted in this way, the
metaphor of organic unity becomes a model of the postmodern society. It can also be
applied to the institutions which make up the Bahai religious community, and to the
metaphysical realities that Bahais refer to as the names and attributes of God, and it
has obvious implications for the relationship between the individual and collective.
This is too much to address in one volume. What can be presented here, the theology
of church and state, is therefore no more than the first chapters of what would be a
postmodern Bahai political theology on the theme of organic unity. These terms too
require some explanation.

First, this is the first part of a political theology. Where political philosophy
asks ‘What would utopia be like?’ and ‘how should social life be organised,’ a
political theology asks ‘what should we believe about the Kingdom of God, about the
ideal organisation of social life, the life of the faith community, and its relation to the
world?’ A political theology does not simply describe or prescribe the institutions of
social life (which would be political science), rather it asks, ‘what is the point’ of the
institutions and rules of political and religious life, from the point of view of religion?

The difference between a political theology and a systematic theology is not
just that a systematic theology is broader, including topics such as proofs of the
existence of God, the nature of the prophets, reason and revelation and ethics, which
will not be dealt with here, but also that in systematic theology ‘the world’ appears
as one topic within the realm of religion, while political theology reverses this. In
political theology, our religion is treated as part of our world-view, and ecclesiology
as one aspect of the religious meaning of society.

INTRODUCTION 9

This is also a Bahai theology, in the sense that I write primarily for the Bahais,
and therefore use Bahai scriptural and historical sources. But a Bahai theology can
hardly be exclusive, since Bahai scriptural resources include the Bible and the Quran
(Qur’~n). Moreover, any political theology is in one sense at least universal, since it
begins with the world. People of all faiths and none live within one world: pluralist
and fragmented, but paradoxically the same world.

This is a theology, which is to say, not just a set of religious teachings, but a
systematic discourse centred around God. A political theology examines the
inferences of the political language used in religion. All language about how God acts
in the world is analogous. We say for instance that God is the “Helper of the needy,
the Deliverer of the captives, the Abaser of the oppressors, the Destroyer of the
wrong-doers, the God of all men, the Lord of all created things.” The fact that such
names are used in scripture entitles us to suppose that there is some sort of analogy
between God’s acting as Lord and Deliverer and the human projects of lordship and
liberation, and vice versa. There is nothing which would act, like a diode in an
electrical circuit, to prevent the analogy working both ways, so the freeing of the
slaves, for instance, is analogous to God the Deliverer leading his people out of
bondage in Egypt. Therefore language about God is inescapably language about
human beings, and political language used about God’s acting in the world
inescapably speaks about human political relationships. What then does it mean to say
that God is ‘the King,’ or that ‘sovereignty belongs to God’?

This is also a postmodern theology, which follows in fact from its being
political, from the fact that it begins with the world and society. One cannot write
political theology today as if society was still the same sort of thing as it was for
Plato, al-Farabi (al-F~r~b§ ) or Augustine. By postmodern here, I refer to the
sociological fact, and not to current literary and philosophical theories about
postmodernity. I regard these postmodernisms as various attempts to construct a
theory that corresponds to the experience of living in society after the modern age,
for a particular field such as literary criticism or philosophy. I will attempt to provide
a Bahai theology which starts from the same social fact, and may either parallel or
diverge from the postmodernisms proposed in other fields (but will in any case avoid
the postcondestutterist style which has marred many postmodernisms). Thus the
postmodern here refers to the world we live in, or that we feel we are coming to live
in, and not to any particular school or author. My understanding of the dynamics and
structure of a postmodern society is explained in more detail below.

Since I hold that our religious views are part of our world-view, and that the
view of society contained in postmodernism is fundamentally different to the social

model of the ‘modern’ age (the age of the centralised and rationalised nation-state),
it follows that while much of this Bahai theology should make sense to Islamic,
Jewish, Christian or non-religious postmodern readers, it will be at best strange to
Bahais who think not of ‘society’ but of ‘a’ society: an organisational unit having
borders roughly congruent with those of a state (or more recently, of ‘Europe’ or ‘the
West’) and a value system that is roughly congruent with a cultural tradition informed
by one religion. As we will see in the review of church and state in the Bahai
secondary literature, some Bahais have nursed a nostalgia for an even older model,
in which society is an expansion of the family or a global confederation based on
“tribal communities.”4 Some may still be expecting an end to “our dreadful western
civilization” which divides life into separate compartments (to quote one of the more
influential Bahai authors)5 and a return to the golden past. They are forewarned that
they will find little common ground between such nostalgic hopes and the role of the
Bahai Faith in a postmodern society as presented here.

The yawning gulf between the conservative and postmodern views is an
indicator of the high ambition that motivates this first attempt at a postmodern Bahai
theology, and an opportunity to give a preliminary answer to those who ask what a
theologian, or a theology, could be good for, anyway. What is needed is not simply
to recast Bahai thought in contemporary terms, or to hold the theological thinking of
the Bahais up for critical examination in the light of Bahai scripture (both useful
functions of theologians), but rather to drag Bahai thinking bodily from one world-
view into the next. We can scarcely understand, now, the extent to which the
Christians of the second and third centuries saw their religion in terms set by the
shape of Roman society and the Roman state. If we do focus on that, we also see the
magnitude of the transition initiated by Augustine’s theology, in disentangling the
Christian religion from outdated suppositions about society. In the same way, the
Bahai secondary literature, including statements issued by the official bodies of the
Bahai community, show how deeply the thinking of the Bahai community is –
unconsciously – committed to an old world-view. Assumptions about the nature of
religion, the shape of society and of religious community, and the relation of the
individual to these collectives are taken over from a pre-modern world-view, and are

assumed to be self-evident, or are explicitly labelled as ‘the Bahai teachings,’
although they have no possible anchor in the Bahai scriptures. We cannot hope to
entirely extricate the Bahai faith from all such assumptions and see it ‘as it really is,’
for our religions are part of our world-views, and none of us can live without
organising our thought and perceptions in terms of one or more world-views. We can
however try to see the Bahai Faith within another world-view, as one part of the
global polysystem of post-modern society, and I believe that we will see that it makes
eminent sense when viewed in that way.

While the project is ambitious, no-one would imagine that such a wholesale
transition can be achieved completely, and for everyone, by one author. There are no
patent rights on the construction of the Bahai postmodern theology. I am also aware
that the criticisms of those opposed to such a wholesale rethinking of Bahai teachings
will themselves contribute to a healthy dialectic process which will take some
generations. At the same time, the need for a Bahai theology closely related to the
post-modern world is so pressing that we must put on seven-league boots, and attempt
to cover as much of the distance as possible, now.

The dynamics of globalisation
Something must also be said about what I mean by ‘globalisation’ and ‘post-modern’
in the sociological sense. I understand globalisation as the whole process by which
we move from the societies of the centralised nation-states of the ‘modern’ period to
something which is structurally different. The two words are one semantic unit:
‘globalisation’ is the present process, and ‘post-modern’ is the result. Postmodern
means ‘that which will have been globalized,’ as we imagine it.

Globalisation is not just a matter of extending existing social structures to a
global level: the extension requires and reinforces deep changes in social structures,
which in turn demand changes in our world-view: the result is a new kind of society
as well as a globally extended society.

The key dynamic of globalisation is the progressive differentiation of different
spheres of social life. Functional differentiation begins at the dawn of history, and is
self-accelerating, in a process analogous to the curve of differentiation of the means
of production. The division of labour increases productivity which yields surplus, and
it also yields more specific expertise and thus more differentiated individual
identities. The roles of the smith, the fisherman, the herdsman, the religious specialist
and the ruler represent both distinct functions in society and opportunities for
individuals to differentiate themselves from others. The greater expertise and surplus
produced can be used for further progress, while competition between societies

ensures that there are penalties if differentiation does not progress. At first this
differentiation could be partially accommodated by social stratification, for instance
between the strata of rulers, warriors, scribes, artisans and peasants.

Although the process of differentiation goes back to prehistory, two significant
steps can be noted. The first is the emergence of religions of transcendence in the
axial age: in such religions the social order is not simply a part of the cosmic order,
rather, the transcendent has a certain relation to social order, as something external
and higher. Parts of the social order may relate more intimately with the cosmic order
than others, so the transcendent creates the not-transcendent, and the possibility of
having ‘worldly’ and ‘spiritual’ aspects of life. Kingship may still be divine, and
supported by the religious order, but it is not self-evidently so. The divine king is a
charioteer, harnessing two horses but not making them the same thing. They are
institutionalised in two orders (priests and courtiers), and there is always the risk of
them pulling in different directions. The voices of transcendence may demand one
thing, and reasons of state something else. At a very early date, political philosophy
emerges as distinct from theology, providing a non-religious justification for the
existence of the state based on the necessity of punishment (and perhaps reward) to
create social order and ensure prosperity.6

The second great step in the functional differentiation of society dates from
about the 14th century, particularly in Europe, with a sharp acceleration in ‘modern’
times. Distinct institutions of politics, economics, religion and science already
existed, but their degree of autonomy has increased and, for the first time, we see
theoretical claims that they ought to be autonomous. The shift from a monist but
stratified society to an organic and differentiated society gave the western societies
in which it first occurred a tremendous competitive advantage, which is why
globalisation is sometimes confused with westernization. In reality, a glance at
western history shows that modernity was experienced there as something that
‘happened to’ western societies, and that it required deep and painful rethinking and
great changes to Western social institutions. We see the establishment of the ‘free
university,’ called so because it was intended to be free from religious control.
Theories of national churches are advanced, intended to free the political sphere from
religious control (and, if possible, to turn the tables). From the Hanseatic League

Arjomand gives an example in the Hindu political philosophy of Kautilya, dating from
> 300 BC (Arjomand, ‘Religion and the Diversity of Normative Orders,’ 44-5. For
> discussions of the differentiation of the religious and political in the axial age see
Arjomand, Political Dimensions, chapter 1 (S.N. Eisenstadt) and chapter 2.

onwards, we see the realization that trade prospers best where the state interferes
least. Within the sphere of politics, the theory of the separation of the judicial,
legislative and executive powers is worked out. From the toleration of dissent,
arguments for disestablishment are developed, and churches are constitutionally
disestablished or withdraw from politics in the narrow sense (but in neither case from
public life: one should not confuse institutional differentiation with the privatization
of religion). These different institutions also became distinct life-worlds: not only is
the church distinct from the state and the academy, but the way we reason and relate
to one another is different when we are sharing a Christian mass, arguing politics and
setting up a trading company. It is accepted that we behave according to different
logics in different spheres.

The concept of different ‘logics’ that apply in different life-worlds can be
compared to the idea of a core business in business studies. This does not entail that
a business, or the institutions in a particular sphere, should concentrate exclusively
on one task, but rather that they understand clearly what their nature and primary
goals are, and the implications of this for the way they relate to others. It requires that
they should align their internal life and structures in accordance with the requirements
of their ‘core business.’ The idea of internal logics has also been admirably expressed
in the subtitle of a work by S.T. Coleridge: The Constitution of Church and State,
according to the idea of each, where the word ‘idea’ has its full platonic value. The
institutions of politics and of organised religion are justified by their own missions,
which each seeks to fulfil in the world.

The core business of government is coercion, and a state’s sovereignty consists
of its monopoly on coercion. However, in any society beyond that of a slave
plantation, coercion does not operate purely as an imposition. Coercion is a service
provided by the business of government, as an integral part of its two prime functions,
the provision of security and enabling effective collective action. I, of course, pay my
taxes and obey the laws willingly, and would do so even if I were not coerced.
However I would not do so willingly if my neighbours were not coerced. They might
not pay their taxes, or their businesses might undercut mine by ignoring
environmental laws. That is, some people might take a free ride on the backs of more
conscientious citizens. My neighbours of course reason in the same way about me.
Thus the coercion provided by government is necessary to enable the members of a
society to freely support social action: coercion is the essential instrument of
government to which Baha’u’llah refers:

> The instruments which are essential to the immediate protection, the
> security and assurance of the human race have been entrusted to the

> hands, and lie in the grasp, of the governors of human society. This is
> the wish of God and His decree.... 7

No-one would suppose that the good society could be one based solely on coercion:
the point illustrates the general rule that a clear understanding of the nature of one
organ immediately highlights its relationship to other organs. If government’s core
business is coercion, it follows that government is not everything: it should aspire
only to a limited role in relation to other human projects. “Penalties” may be “an
effective instrument for the security and protection of men,” but “dread of the
penalties maketh people desist only outwardly from committing vile and contemptible
deeds, while that which guardeth and restraineth man both outwardly and inwardly
hath been and still is the fear of God.”8 Baha’u’llah says that “The weakening of the
pillars of religion hath strengthened the foolish and emboldened them and made them
more arrogant ... The greater the decline of religion, the more grievous the
waywardness of the ungodly. This cannot but lead in the end to chaos and
confusion.”9 The issue here has both individual and structural dimensions. First,
religion can motivate individuals and teach norms and values (but so can non-
religious forms of commitment). Second, the absence or ineffectiveness of
institutional religion in society creates a vacuum which, in the time since Baha’u’llah
wrote this, has tempted governments to seek to fill what is seen as a necessary social
function. But government has no legitimate means of inspiring altruism, because
altruism and coercion cannot share the same pillow. In the twentieth century the
projects of nationalism, fascism and communism have sought to invest the state with
an aura of ultimate authenticity which would inspire altruistic behaviour, and the
result in every case has been not only a great deal of suffering but also the exposure
of the ideology as a mask for power. More recently, the communitarian philosophy
has provided a justification for state support for a hegemony of one culture as a means

of fostering the common norms and values that communitarians believe to be
necessary. If (God forbid) it were to be as successful as previous forms of
collectivism, its results would no doubt be as horrifying.

However high-minded their rhetoric, governments cannot surrender their core
business of coercion, which means that government cannot itself be the source of
altruism (though government service is a sphere for altruistic action). This in turn
means that good government must allow the free operation of other human projects,
such as religion and culture, which can supply what government lacks. Religion on
the other hand can elicit altruism, but it undermines its own credibility when the
religious institutions take control of the instruments of coercion, as in contemporary
Iranian theocracy. The Law of religion can only operate on the basis of the fear of
God, its disciplines voluntarily accepted by people who may freely leave and so
exempt themselves from religious law. This would not be a very plausible way of
running a state.

The difference between the logics of religion and of government means that
they deal with individual members differently, as believers and as citizens
respectively. Beliefs are not relevant to citizenship status, and civil status should be
irrelevant to membership of the religious community. Citizenship and its duties
cannot be adopted and renounced at will, while membership of the religious
community can be. The differentiation of the two spheres therefore arises from the
fundamental nature of each. Particular thinkers and traditions, and historical accident,
have enabled this distinction to be embodied earlier or more clearly in some societies,
and most clearly in the last two centuries in western societies, but the principle itself
is not Western or Christian but logical and essential. Abdu’l-Baha considered the
clear awareness of the autonomy of the religious sphere to be one of the causes of
Europe’s greater progress:

> when [Europeans] removed these differences, persecution, and bigotries
> out of their midst, and proclaimed the equal rights of all subjects and the
> liberty of men’s consciences, the lights of glory and power arose and
> shone from the horizons of that kingdom ... These are effectual and
> sufficient proofs that the conscience of man is sacred and to be
> respected; and that liberty thereof produces widening of ideas,
> amendment of morals, improvement of conduct, disclosure of the secrets
> of creation, and manifestation of the hidden verities of the contingent
> world. ... Convictions and ideas are within the scope of the
> comprehension of the King of kings, not of kings; ... ‘The ways unto
> God are as the number of the breaths of [His] creatures’ is a mysterious

> truth, and ‘To every [people] We have appointed a [separate] rite’ is one
> of the subtleties of the Quran.10

Equally, those countries in which the autonomy of the economic sphere has been
recognised have prospered, while those that subordinate economic activities to
national interest or political ideology trail behind. Likewise, the liberation of the
scientific and educational sphere from any religious a priori has accelerated scientific
and technological progress. We can generalise these processes by saying that the
functional differentiation of society is the motor behind the creation of successful
contemporary societies, and that this differentiation entails not just the separation of
institutions, but also the differentiation of the individual’s roles as citizen, fellow-
believer, scientist and economic agent.

Although the transcendent concept of the cosmos contained in the religions of
revelation underlies the differentiation of the religious from the worldly, the religions
of revelation have not in general wholeheartedly endorsed the “de facto pluralism of
normative orders”11 which they spawned. The sense that this pluralism is wrong
seems to have been deep-seated. In the 20th century, communism and fascism have
sought to re-establish a monist normative order, with the result, as George Orwell
foresaw, that truth was no longer something distinct from political expedience. The
distance created by dual normative orders is also the space required for ethical
critique. The task for a contemporary political theology is to elevate this normative
pluralism into an explicit religious principle, by justifying not only the existence of
the order of politics, but the existence of plural orders per se.

The differentiation of the political as just one aspect of life entails another sort
of differentiation, between the state and society, with the result that elements of the
religious order can choose to relate primarily to the state or to the people. The
question of ‘church and state’ is in fact a ménage à trois, in which religion may serve
to domesticate the people on behalf of the political order, or mobilise them against
it, and in which the state may coerce the people on behalf of the religious order,
restrict their appeal to it, or protect them from religious coercion. The religious order
and the political may compete for popular legitimation, and the actual shape of
church-state relations is determined not only by the institutionalisation of each order
and the constitutional rules applying between them, but also by the social dynamics

that distribute legitimation to one or both.

The multiple roles of the individual as citizen, fellow-believer, scientist and
economic agent in the different life-worlds brings us to the second dynamic of
globalisation: individualisation. When society shifted
from a unitary but stratified structure to a functionally
differentiated structure, the principle of individual
identity changed absolutely. We can picture this with
two diagrams. The first is a triangle representing an
individual in a unitary stratified society, where the
strata represent primarily status and power, and only
secondarily specific social functions. The second
shows the profile of one individual in a functionally
differentiated society, in which the vertical areas
represent economic life, religious life and political life.
In the first diagram, the individual has one identity: he
might be a ‘gentleman’ in commerce, religion and
politics. But in a differentiated society the person is smeared across the life-worlds:
we have profiles rather than individual identities. Each person comes to act in distinct
ways in the different spheres, and maintains a distinct status in each sphere. The poor
cobbler may be a respected leader in the Methodist circle, the magistrate may be
excluded from communion: we are different ‘selves’ in different contexts. That also
means that individuals have more freedom in constructing their own identities, and
are dealt with in each sphere as individuals and not as members of a family, group or
class.

Coupled with this individualisation comes the possibility and concept of
individual freedoms, and the claims of classes, ethnic minorities and women to share
in them as individuals. I regard feminism as an aspect of individualisation, because
individualisation entails that society recognises that its basic unit is the individual,
and not the family, class, production unit or religious or ethnic community. The
effects are so remarkable that feminisation could be considered among the most
important dynamics of globalization, but the various issues concerning the status of
women according to the Bahai teachings are postponed here, to be dealt with in later
volumes.

Individualism as a political philosophy, which is to say, the recognition that the
individual is the basis and justification for collective life and not vice versa, is
certainly the most important value of postmodern societies and, coupled with
structural differentiation, the key to their astonishing success. Individualism is the

prerequisite of a society governed by law, of democracy as a technique of
government, and of the concept of human rights, and also provides a climate for
innovation in science and effort in commerce. The high valuation of the individual
and the recognition of rights to sufficiency and self-development also underlie the
welfare state and modern mass education.

In a functionally differentiated, religiously pluralistic and individualised
society, religions cannot play the public role of providing social cohesion for society
as a whole, and they must seek new roles. One strategy is to develop individual
religious identity as a counterpoint to social identity, so that being Muslim,
Methodist, or Mormon becomes an element in identity that differentiates one
individual from another and assures each of their individuality. This entails the
individualisation of religion, creating a private sphere within which religious values
and world-view provide a sense that the old society – the pre-differentiated society
and the singular identity it offered to the individual – still exists, although it plainly
does not exist outside the home and the religious community. The second strategy,
pursued here, is for a religion to re-invent itself in terms of globalisation, to offer
itself as a means of giving meaning to post-modern society.

Rotating the axes of society and smearing individual identity across multiple
worlds causes a good deal of stress – the experience is analogous to what happens in
Star Trek when something goes wrong with “Beam me up, Scotty,” and the individual
ceases to be located in any particular place. How much stress is involved depends in
part on how rapidly world-views change to accommodate the new situation. Any
substantial lag is experienced as moral chaos or a ‘wrongness’ in the world, and in the
self. The intra-personal tension may be externalised by identifying ‘enemies’ who are
responsible for the chaos, or the individual may retreat into fantasies such as
survivalism, or may seek a leader who promises a high power difference, thus
providing a definitely located identity for the individual. All of these responses to
individual stress have potential social and political effects that should concern us. The
Bahai Faith tells its followers that a radically different way of ordering the world (a
new ‘World Order’) is not to be feared, and the Bahai teachings anticipate the key
dynamics of globalisation. These teachings could well alleviate some of the tension
by supporting a world-view in which the differentiated and individualised society is
not a threat but rather the way things are meant to be.

Another effect of functional differentiation has been that geographic
boundaries belonging to one sphere are not transferred to another. Trade is not
confined by the boundaries of the state or the religious community, and religious
communities cross political boundaries. Global integration is the process in which

commerce, having become an autonomous sphere functioning according to its own
logic, then discovers that neither national nor religious boundaries are relevant to it,
and so becomes a world economic system. Where trade leads, technologies of
transport and communication follow, and this makes it possible for science, politics
and religion to be integrated globally.

The development of global subsystems is not inevitable, or at least not
predictable, since the dynamics of global integration appear to differ in the different
spheres. Politics is driven to global integration, by common problems, by the
globalization of the economy, the freeloader problem, tax competition and so on.
States find they need a rule of law and institutions of implementation, and they are
deliberately constructing them. Science however is a naturally global system, where
barriers of external control, language and communication do not intervene. Economic,
political and scientific global systems are thus forming, but in different ways. None
of this necessarily applies to religion or to religions, especially if we think of religions
acting primarily at the local level through face to face interactions such as religious
rituals. Perhaps religion will not become the next global sub-system, but rather one
of the local and particular components of a global society. In sociology, this is the
question of ‘religion as a global system,’ which is intriguing but seems to have no
clear answer yet. In the context of a Bahai systematic theology, it is the question of
the relationship between religion as such, “The changeless Faith of God, eternal in
the past, eternal in the future,”12 and particular historical revelations of which
Baha’u’llah’s is one. Can one religion become a global religious system in itself, or
can religions in the plural form such a system? But this would take us from political
theology to prophetology, and we must leave the question for now.

The last dynamic of globalization I would like to mention is pluralism and
relativism, due to intensified intercultural and interreligious contacts and migration,
which in turn are due to the global integration of the political and economic systems.
When we speak of postmodernism in philosophy and the fine arts, we are referring
mainly to this aspect of globalisation. The implications of relativism in philosophy
and theology have been far-reaching, and it is tempting to explore them further, since
Shoghi Effendi has said that the “fundamental verity underlying the Bahai Faith [is]
that religious truth is not absolute but relative,” 13 but we are concerned here primarily
with the effects of cultural and religious pluralism in societies.

Baha’u’llah, Kitab-e Aqdas, paragraph 182.

Baha’i Administration 185; see also World Order of Baha’u’llah 58, 115.

As intercultural and interreligious contacts and migration relativize truth claims
and social norms, it becomes harder to find ideological support for social structures.
The family, we now know, is not a given: it is made by people, in many different
ways. The class system is not part of the divine order. Ideologies have proven
untenable, and ideology itself has been asked to turn around for inspection – and we
can see at the very least that the emperor’s new clothes have a large hole in the rear.
Ideologies too are seen to be manufactured, their doctrines designed to support
interests. Political theories that supposed that shared ideologies and values are the
basis of social unity have given way to a model of society that is united, despite
differences, by our needs for one another. States that still possess a state ideology,
such as Iran and Turkey, are now anachronisms.

For completeness’ sake, I should also mention the dynamic of technological
progress and the convergence of material cultures. This is a major contributor to
globalisation, although I do not intend to deal with it further.

The limits of theology
In this view, society is a polysystem, that is, a system containing areas or entire
subsystems in which the laws governing the behaviour of other parts of the system
do not apply, or different laws do apply. Arithmetic, for instance, is a system but
mathematics is a polysystem. All the functions of arithmetic can in principle be
reduced to possible manipulations of discrete like objects such as coins, counting
stones or abacus beads. But there are fields of mathematics that bear no possible
relationship to physical objects – the use of square roots of negative numbers for
instance. There are other fields with laws that are additional to arithmetic laws, such
as set theory. Sets are not like objects, and one set may intersect or subsume another.
I call society a polysystem in part because it is highly complex and can be broken
down for analytic purposes into functionally differentiated subsystems, but especially
to draw attention to the fact that the ‘logics’ of the various parts differ. The idea of
different logics implies that no explanation of the whole system – whether that be a
theological explanation of society (a political theology) or a sociological or economic
model – can claim to provide an overall theoretical framework that is also valid in
models of society derived from other disciplines.

The economy, to take one example, functions in accordance with the rational
maximization of utility, and its behaviour can be predicted from this behavioural
‘law’ and others. Nobody would imagine that behaviour in the arts or religion could
be usefully explained or predicted by the same law. Yet economics, art, government

and religion are not hermetically sealed spheres. An economic model of society
should include submodels for the arts, education, religion, science and government,
because these aspects of society have economic effects and are affected by economic
life. The economic model of society may translate the behaviour of these other
‘projects’ using para-economic concepts such as social capital, social goods, symbol
production and symbolic consumption, psychological utility and so forth. Although
such an economic model might incorporate economic descriptions of the whole of
society, it would still be an economic model, and not a comprehensive social model
(whatever its practitioners might imagine!). It would be a model of the whole in terms
defined by one subsystem, the project of economic life. No-one should imagine that
such a model describes the inherent dynamics of artistic appreciation or creation, the
attraction and awe that the holy exercises on the mystic, the solidarity of the family
or the curiosity of science – at least, not in ways the correspond to the experience and
motivations of the participants. Similarly, science has models of religion, within
disciplines such as the ‘history of religions,’ the psychology of religion, and the
sociology of religion, but these are not religion as religion understands itself.

Religion too has something to say about science and technology: that all
knowledge is a path to God since truth is one, that humans are in this world as
stewards of creation, and that human knowing is a manifestation of the name of God
‘The All-Knowing.’ Clearly these are not the concerns that drive the scientist as a
scientist: it would be difficult to derive the norms of falsifiability and replicability
from them. A scientist as a believer might understand what a theology says about the
project of science, but would be perfectly capable of doing science without any
knowledge of religion, and will do science best if he, or she, does it according to the
logic of science without regard for theology.

The same limitation applies to religious models of society, or ‘political
theologies.’ Religion is just one of the human projects that make up society, so
political theology cannot assume that religion should provide normative explanations
for all of the projects in society. A political theology should describe the other
projects in religious terms, but this does not imply that religion exercises a hegemony
of value over other projects. A political theology can at most say what other projects
can mean for religion, it cannot claim to describe how they ought to appear in their
own lights. The theorists of Islamic integrism14 have often said that Islam embraces

See Jansen, Dual Nature, chapter 2, and the sources cited there. The term integrist is
> preferred to ‘fundamentalist’ or ‘Islamist’ throughout, because it seems more precisely
to pinpoint the approach to religion and to society which is common to those who have

the whole of society (and there is the danger that the same could be said of the Bahai
Faith, in that virtually every aspect of life is at least mentioned somewhere in the
Bahai scriptures). In practice, however, the factor ‘Islam’ does not adequately explain
all that is going on in an Islamic society. Nor should it, according to the organic
social model employed here. Religion is not everything, although it may speak of
everything. The integrists’ claim that religion has a hegemony is untrue in practice,
and wrong in principle.

If we have economic, religious and political models of society, each seeing the
whole in its own terms, the question arises, are there no universal categories, no
possibility of a model of society as a whole? I can only venture an answer,
acknowledging that it comes primarily from the project of religion and the point of
view of a believer. I suggest that the only model adequate to the polysystem of society
as a whole is the category of the person, by which I mean both the human person and
the person of God. But this does not help us much, since the person is a mystery – a
holy mystery. How is it that we each do science according to the rules of science,
believe as believers, are citizens of the state and explore the arts and – by and large
– pass from one life-world to the other without dropping a stitch? We know that an
excess of faith in art makes for bad art, that the ethics of the state are not the same as
those of an individual, that the truths of revelation and of science are drinks better
taken unmixed. How do we know this, and how do we maintain this equilibrium?

Every logical system contains axioms that cannot be proved within that system.

In this system, which is my political theology for the Bahai Faith, this must simply
be stated as an axiom – that the person, human and divine, is a mystery; that the
person harmonises incommensurate qualities and is the highest possible category.
This means that the individual – any individual – is prior to any collective. Society
as a polysystem, with its diverse organs functioning according to different laws, can
at its harmonious best be somewhat like a single person, but the individual already
is that. Society also derives its value from the individual, and not vice versa. This
theology, as a postmodern theology, is axiomatically individualistic.

Of church and state
One motive for writing this book now rather than in some indefinite future when my
knowledge may be more adequate, is that the issue of church and state has moved to
the top of the agenda. This is a burning question in several respects: universally in
human societies, and in contemporary world politics as an emblem of wider
disagreements concerning the application of enlightenment values in a post-
enlightenment world; in Bahai apologetics because of the publication of works about
the Bahai Faith, some critical and some meant to be objective, which claim that the
Bahai Faith has as its goal the institution of a global theocratic state; and finally
because the increasing social engagement of Bahai communities means that we now
need to understand this issue ourselves, because it affects not only what will happen
in the far future but also what we are becoming now, but the way it is treated in the
secondary Bahai literature is particularly inadequate.

To begin with the first of these: the relationship between the religious and
political institutions of society is one of the oldest questions in human society, going
back perhaps to prehistoric rivalries between medicine men or women and tribal
chiefs. The issue has taken particular and pressing forms in recent years, with divisive
and even violent church-state conflicts in a variety of countries from Tibet to Algeria,
Poland to Afghanistan. The issue is not simply constitutional and political, but also
cultural, because religions have been central to the symbolisation of social order in
most cultures, but in most contemporary cultures that is no longer tenable. In recent
years the rise of political Islam in many countries has brought with it a questioning
of whether the state, as a thing in itself, has any right to exist apart from the religious
community and its laws. The assertion that the separation of church and state has no
justification in Islam might be likened to a flag planted by Islamic integrists to mark
out the field on which the clash of civilizations will be fought – and also as an
assertion by Orientalists that the object of their study is utterly foreign. Few other

doctrines can awaken such unanimous rejection among the heirs of the western liberal
tradition, in east and west. In the west there is a common horror of rule by clerics, a
horror in which more or less uninformed western images of Islam, and particularly
of Iran, are mixed with images drawn from our own western history, from Protestant
portrayals of the Inquisition, through the anti-clerical tradition of the French
revolution, to the anti-religious rhetoric of the ‘battle between science and religion’
of the early 20th century.15 Rule by religion has had a singularly bad press. The
Islamic revival has given the West the opportunity to focus this abhorrence on an
external other: Islam stands identified with clerical rule (if we conveniently forget
that the great majority of Islamic countries, throughout history, have been monarchies
rather than theocracies, and that some are now, more or less, democracies), and on
this issue at least we in the West know where we stand and why. Moreover, the
extremes of the Islamic Brotherhood in Egypt, the Iranian revolution and al-Qaida
have provided the West with new negative images which can conveniently be applied
to Islam as a whole. It would be difficult indeed to rouse any enthusiasm in the
secularized and desacralised west for a religious defence of the West European
version of the Christian faith and heritage against the rising tide of Islam. But no
effort is required to achieve a consensus that any force seeking to turn back the clock,
in the direction of theocracy, must be resisted.

The separation of church and state thus becomes a slogan, an emblem for
deeper anxieties and wider hopes. It is not a technical question for the constitutional
lawyers, but a touchstone for how we see ourselves and the world. Having separated
church and state, how do societies live with religion and politics, and how do
individuals combine their religious practice with social, and therefore political,
participation? The solution which I have found in the Bahai writings may be of
interest to societies and individuals, of whatever faith. For I think it shows that
adherence to fundamental values which are derived from religion and faith does not
necessarily entail a denial, or even relativization, of the just rights and prerogatives
of the state, or of the dignity of statecraft. It is indeed possible to be a citizen of the

city of God and of an earthly country, providing one can establish that God so wills
it.

The issue of church and state is not only a marker for the front line in the battle
of civilizations, but also the occasion of domestic unease of various kinds in the
West. The Protestant countries of the West are watching the growth of a politically
active and influential expression of Christian integrism with argus eyes, unable to
dispense with religion, whose power to motivate altruism has been recognized, but
equally unwilling to allow that the integrists’ claims to possess the revealed truth
can have any place in the political process. An article in Time magazine cites one
of the ‘Promise Keeper’ pledges, which includes the verse “... go, and make
disciples of all nations ... teaching them to obey everything I have commanded you.”16
Time comments, “On the small scale of Lawton’s First Assembly of God church, the
inspiration is palpable, touching, poignant. But in the grander scheme, the Bible verse
raises other questions: Who on earth will command? And who must obey?”17 Recent
elections in the United States have shown the continuing political power of organized
religion – although it is ‘organized’ in the case of these Protestant movements outside
of the established and orthodox churches, and by self-appointed evangelists rather
than by the clergy.

Similarly, the post-communist Roman Catholic countries of Eastern Europe are
feeling the renewal of direct political influence from the clergy, and are suffering a
degree of dissonance in the process. Clearly most of the churches, particularly the
Catholic church in Poland, have contributed a great deal to keeping more humane
values alive through the decades of official materialism, under a ruling culture
dependent on omnipresent informants and large-scale official lies. A considerable
debt of thanks and respect is due to them. In many cases the same churches served as
rallying-points in the anti-communist revolutions that enabled these countries to
move out of the isolation and stagnation in which they had sunk. However it is
equally clear that the forward movement that they have aided cannot continue without
an acceptance of the separation of church and state, as a universally recognized
prerequisite for the foundation of a modern state. The churches that have stood as
parents in the birth of the post-communist states must now let their offspring go out
into the world on their own – accepting the irony that the exclusion of the church

Time, Vol. 150 No. 15, Atlantic edition, October 13 1997, 40.

from direct participation in political life was one of the doctrines of the communist
movement which they have helped to overthrow.

In England, church establishment appears more untenable every year, as
religious pluralism, unchurched religion, and irreligion steadily reduce the proportion
of the population who support Anglican institutions. In Italy, Spain and Ireland,
where the Roman Catholic church is established, the question of what this means in
terms of legislation on abortion and divorce has been given in referenda into the
hands of the citizen-believers. In these countries, where the faithful and the citizenry
are almost co-extensive, the debates have shown that this is not primarily a struggle
between parties with differing visions of the nation and its future, but rather a
struggle within individuals for an understanding wide enough to embrace these two
aspects of the human person.

My second reason why church and state is an urgent issue referred to the
attacks the Bahai Faith has suffered on this point in recent years. Some of these will
be referred to in the survey of secondary literature, and en passant where relevant
points are touched on in the text. The polemic focus on this point is understandable.
The characteristic theological doctrine of the Bahai Faith is ‘progressive revelation,’18
and its characteristic social teaching is the unity of the human race, a unity which
should find expression in a reign of universal peace upheld by a world government.
The Bahai Writings mandate a world super-state, with an elected world legislature,
a world executive and judiciary. The same scriptures mandate, and give quite detailed
prescriptions for, the Bahai administrative order, containing elected, appointed and
hereditary elements, which culminates in the twin institutions of the Guardianship and
the Universal House of Justice who are empowered respectively to interpret the Bahai
Writings and to legislate for matters not contained in those Writings. This
administrative system is presented as a pattern and model for the organization of the
world. Since the Bahai Faith has no clergy, its well-organized administrative
machinery, consisting of elected ‘Assemblies’ at local and national levels and the
‘Universal House of Justice’ at the international level, has been critically important
in coordinating its activities and maintaining its unity. A large part of Bahai energies

In fact this doctrine is shared by both Islamic and Christian theologies, both of which

over the last several generations, in those countries where they are free to do so, has
been devoted to building up these administrative institutions.

The question which naturally arises is what the relationship may be between
the elected administrative machinery which the Bahais have devoted so much of their
collective energies to erecting and the institutions of the world government which
they proclaim as necessary and inevitable. The suspicion that they might be one and
the same thing is natural, and not all the writers who have taken this view have done
so perversely, to attack the Bahai programme. But some have used the issue
deliberately to present the Bahais in a way calculated to arouse fear or contempt in
modern audiences.

The most sustained and perverse of these is Ficicchia’s Der Baha’ismus –
Religion der Zukunft?19 (1981), according to which the Bahai Faith is not only
totalitarian intolerant and anti-pluralist20 in its internal structure, it seeks to make that
structure the government of a theokratischen Weltherrschaft,21 a theocratic world
dominion, which would be centralized22 rather than federal, and would include a
centrally-planned economy. Indications to the contrary are dismissed as opportunistic
tactics and taqiyya (taq§ yya, the dissimulation of beliefs),23 that is, as a mask that will
be abandoned when the true goal of world dominion becomes attainable. It is a
monstrous vision that Ficicchia conjures up, and it has had an effect on the public
perception of the Faith in German-speaking countries. In 1988 the Bahai community
was refused permission to place an information stand in a public place in Berlin on
the grounds that the Bahai material “contains things that are contrary to the free
democratic constitution of Germany.”24

In Ficicchia’s case I cannot believe that such criticisms are anything but
deliberate distortions, but in other cases there are genuine concerns arising, on the

one hand, from the very confused articulation in the Bahai secondary literature on this
point, and on the other hand as a byproduct of anxieties about other threats to post-
enlightenment society from other directions: Islamic and Christian integrism on the
one hand, and the historic reluctance of Catholic and Orthodox churches to embrace
a modernity which, to be fair, was less than willing to embrace them in return. A
western intellectual culture that is drawing itself up to defend the achievements of the
Enlightenment cannot afford to admit within its ranks anyone whose commitment to
enlightenment values is questionable. I hope not only to show that the Bahai
teachings are in accordance with enlightenment values, in the sense that these values
can be regarded as a previous manifestation of the same transformation which was
later to be embodied in the Bahai teachings, but also to show a way in which the
fortress may be unnecessary. For if I have understood them correctly, the Bahai
teachings not only provide a theological justification for the separate existence of the
state but also some indications of how church and state, once securely separated, are
to be reconciled.

Thus Church and state is a critical issue for human societies in general, for the
antagonists in the clash between eastern and western cultures (or religious and
modernist visions of society) at the present juncture, and for the Bahai Faith now that
it is receiving more attention as a community and model of governance warranting
serious consideration. It is self-evident that it is worthwhile for Bahais and Bahai
scholars to try to articulate the Bahai teachings on education, the abolition of racism,
the equality of men and women, the harmony of religions and fellowship between
religions, and so on. If the issue of church and state is as fundamental to human
societies and present anxieties as I have said, and if the Bahai teachings on this
question have the potential for healing these anxieties which I think I have uncovered,
then it should be equally self-evident that the Bahais need now to focus on this topic
in study and public information programmes. This is not an issue to be postponed to
the far future.

The third reason why church and state is an important question for the Bahai
Faith at this time is that our attitudes to the state will shape our own development as
a religious community. What is at stake is our stance towards our social environment.
The attitude we find in the Bahai Writings to the physical environment – to the good
things of the world and the enjoyment of the senses – is very positive. This will, in
the long term, shape the Bahai community into forms very different to those taken by
religious communities that have a deep distrust of material creation and physical
enjoyments. Our relation to our social environment, of which the state is an important
part, can be expected to have analogous effects. If we begin with the idea that the

state and the whole project of human governance is illegitimate, as in the more
extreme forms of Islamic integrism, or at best a necessary evil, as in much of
Christian political theology, then one would expect the Bahai community to develop
a conception of itself as apart from and in some sense more pure than the world
around it. On the other hand, the belief that statecraft and government are projects
that have been endorsed and commanded by God (as have science and the arts) would
appear to be a positive foundation for a working relationship between Bahai
communities and the structures of governance in the broadest sense. Whatever
attitude we take to the world and its governments, we are inevitably required by our
involvement in the world and concern for the well-being of its peoples to work with
governments and politicians where possible. There are now a number of countries in
which the Bahai community represents a small but significant portion of the
population, and the question of what the Bahais intend eventually to create in those
countries and in the world will be asked. And in other countries, where the Bahai
communities are a very small minority, our understanding of this issue will have an
immediate effect as we seek to “attract people of capacity,” and as the community is
“drawn more deeply into dealing with world issues.”25 If we harbour the idea that
statecraft is illegitimate, politics dirty, and that the whole structure would, in an ideal
world, be swept away, then our relationships to the politicians and institutions we
deal with can hardly be whole-hearted and sincere. Political actors in turn can hardly
be expected to sincerely respect the Bahai institutions and what they stand for. A
negative assessment of the value of the state and statecraft in the divine scheme of
things would make a charade of our efforts to contribute to the United Nations and
other organs of global governance by presenting Baha’u’llah’s teachings on world
federalism. Why would we be devoting such efforts, for instance to UN charter
revisions, if the perfection of that body with its recognition of the Order of
Baha’u’llah would mean that it recognize its own illegitimacy? Shall we baptise the
state, or the global state, only to abolish it? Since we are engaged in efforts to aid the
progressive perfection of human government at all levels, we have an immediate need
for solid foundations for a sincere and wholehearted relationship to government per
se.

Baha’u’llah’s solution to this ancient and topical question lies between the two
poles of theocracy on the one hand and a wall of separation between church and state
on the other, but it cannot be adequately described as a compromise within this
polarity because two new elements have been injected in the equation: Baha’u’llah

provides a theological justification and divine charter for the institution of the state
and a new interpretation of the metaphor of ‘organic unity’ as a model of society. But
Baha’u’llah’s solution is certainly not difficult to understand: it might be
characterized as the harmony of permanently differentiated organs of equal dignity,
within an organic body politic which is understood in terms of the interdependence
of the parts rather than their subordination to a single rationale.

This solution could also bridge a gap that exists in the theological systems of
Judaism, Christianity and Islam, between systematic theologies and theologies of the
state. The religious communities of the Western traditions all have models of ideal
‘social’ structures, on various levels. They have, for example, ultimate eschatological
models of the Kingdom of God and the reign of justice. This is an ideal society to be
created by divine intervention at the end of time. There are also metaphysical models
in which entities such as angels, prophets, the Hidden Imam and the souls of the
departed relate to the world and to one another. This is the realm of saints and angels,
but also of unverifiable dynamics such as ‘love conquers all’ and reward and
retribution. These models show a spiritual reality under and beyond material reality,
and present pictures of the life after death. Then there are ‘ecclesiological’ models,
that is, models of the religious community’s own ideal existence as a commonwealth,
whether it is expressed in terms of the church as the body of Christ, the community
of the Islamic faithful reflecting the primitive community of Medina, or the house of
Israel as a people chosen in service to God. Clearly there are connections between the
models of the ideal Kingdom at the end of time, the life with God in the next world,
the spiritual realities and dynamics which are already active, and the community of
the faithful. One could speak of a single model projected into three dimensions: the
millennial future, the metaphysical, and the community itself.

These religious communities also have immediate goals and activities, in
societies that are governed by state institutions. They therefore have at least implicit
theologies of the state. These serve as models by which they picture what ‘the state’
should be doing, how it comes to exist at all, and what they as religious communities
are doing as they are relating to the state. While there is broad congruence between
pictures of the Kingdom of God throughout the Western religious traditions, there is
a radical divergence in the theologies of the state. The difference exists not primarily
between Jewish, Christian and Islamic theologies, but within each tradition. Even
among groups that are theologically closely related, one finds some world-rejecting
groups that are hostile to the state as irretrievably worldly, while others try to seize
the state from secular control and return it to the hands of faith. Some churches have
moved from one stance to another within a matter of generations. These differences

in theologies of the state are possible because the state is absent from the relatively
stable theological models of the Kingdom of God and (excluding some short-lived
theocratic states) is by definition external to the religious community’s ecclesiological
model. The state may be seen as evil, as an evil wisely ordained for a wicked time,
or as the secular arm performing the will of the church by other means; it may be
baptised, reformed or overturned, but it cannot be truly good, because in the
eschatological, metaphysical and ecclesiological models of the truly good society,
there is no state. The Kingdom to come is pictured as a non-political society.
Christian, Islamic and Jewish theologies of the state are at best loosely related to
these communities’ systematic theologies and are therefore highly variable. And
because states also know that there is no room for a state in the Kingdom, the
relationships between churches and states cannot be more than tactical. Where true
acceptance is withheld on one side, trust cannot be given on the other.

For these reasons, and given the importance that church-state theories have
assumed in Islamic integrists’ rhetoric vis-a-vis the West, the model of church-state
relationships in the Bahai scriptures is exceptionally interesting. Coming from the
Islamic world itself, the Bahai Faith presents a justification of the separation of
church and state going far beyond those produced in the West. Millennialist in
origin26 and still occupying a peripheral position in most countries, its scriptures
nevertheless present stronger arguments for the rights of the state than can be found
even in the theologies of established churches. From the position that the Messiah has
come and the eschaton has been initiated in the life of Baha’u’llah, the Bahai Faith
presents an eschatological model in which the state is not rendered redundant by the
coming of the Messiah, but rather has been blessed and guided by that Coming.

In this version of the Kingdom of God there is a state within the Kingdom of
God, and principles governing its relationship with the religious order. Social
institutions manifest metaphysical realities, and the principles governing church-state
relationships are believed to reflect “the necessary relations inherent in the realities
of things,” 27 which in turn reflect the nature of God. The platonic reality that the state
exists to manifest is part of the Kingdom in Heaven. Moreover the relationship of

organic unity between differentiated institutions of church and state corresponds to
the differentiated organic structure of the ideal Bahai community, so the theology of
the state is matched by a parallel ecclesiology. Finally, the same pattern is found in
the integration of diverse attributes and multiple citizenships in the human person.
Thus the differentiation of church and state in Bahai political theology is related to
metaphysics, eschatology, ecclesiology and anthropology, as variations on one theme,
and this theme in itself has a clear relationship to the kerygma of the Bahai teachings,
which is unity. An additional reason for interest is that this teaching is argued, and
not simply revealed as the divine fiat, and it is argued in neoplatonic terms which are
a common language for Christianity, Islam and Judaism. Perhaps the argument will
prove transferable.
