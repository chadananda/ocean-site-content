 Postm odernism and th e B ahá'í Writing s

Part One

Ian Kluge

1\. Introduction

Postmodernism is a general name given to an extraordinarily
influential intellectual and artistic movement which in its
philosophical form, originated in France – though its
foundations are largely in the work of German philosophers
such as Kant, Nietzsche and Heidegger1 – and successfully took
root and flourished in North American intellectual culture.
Over the last forty years, postmodernism’s influence has been
felt in a wide variety of subjects; however this paper will focus
on its philosophic aspects and leave aside its manifestations in
art, photography, theatre, architecture and creative literature.
Wherever postmodernism has appeared, the depth and breadth
of postmodernism’s impact is astounding. Some subjects, such
as literary studies, have been radically transformed by the
encounter to the point where ‘theory’ to swamp the subject of
literature itself. Philosophy has felt its very legitimacy and
usefulness as a subject challenged2 not to mention basic
concepts such as knowledge, rationality and truth as well as the
whole notion of metaphysics.3 History has been touched by,
among other things, the struggle over the whole notion of grand
narratives versus small or local narratives,4 the knowability of
the past, as well as the uses of history.5 Women’s Studies,
though not in themselves part of postmodernism, have been
affected by the entire deconstructionist project, by
postmodernism’s analysis of power relations and, more
controversially, by its antipathy to essentialism. Psychology
feels the influence of postmodern thinking in its handling of
gender and political science in discussions of marginalization
and the workings of power.6 Cultural Studies have opened new
vistas for exploration through the study of simulations and
simulacra.7 Postmodernism has also re-shaped and revised
Freudian psychoanalysis.8

The breadth and depth of postmodern philosophy’s influence
makes it necessary to examine the nature of its relationship to
the Bahá'í Writings in order to assess whether or not there are
points of agreement, their extent, and whether or not they are
superficial or fundamental.

The movement is so important and, in many respects, so
radical that thought systems and/or religions cannot avoid
taking a position in regards to its ideas. Such is the project
undertaken by this paper which will examine the major
philosophical issues covered by postmodern philosophy in
epistemology and the quest for knowledge especially in
literature, philosophy, history and cultural studies; in ontology;
in philosophical anthropology (theory of man) and in ethics.
This paper shall compare and contrast the positions taken by
major postmodern philosophers with those that are given
directly or implicitly in the Bahá'í Writings.

This inevitably leads to the question ‘Can a Bahá'í adhere to
some form of philosophical postmodernist without losing
intellectual consistency, and if so, in what way?’ This paper
concludes that the Bahá'í Writings and postmodernism share a
variety of ideas but on fundamental issues of ontology,
epistemology, philosophical anthropology (theory of man),
ethics and cultural theory, they are incompatible. Generally
speaking, postmodernism and the Bahá'í Writings do not share
the same or even a similar “Denkweg,”9 or way of thinking. This
is not to say there are no similarities between the two but that
the similarities are relatively superficial or accidental whereas
the differences are deep and foundational.

The plan of this paper is simple: in Part I, we shall survey the
major postmodern writers - in particular Nietzsche, Derrida,
Foucault, Lyotard, Rorty and Baudrillard who are “the major
philosophical figures in the post modern turn in philosophy.”10
In Part II, we shall compare what these philosophers say with
the Bahá'í Writings.

2\. Th e Nature of Phil osophical Postmodernism

In its broadest sense, philosophical postmodernism is a
movement that challenges the most fundamental premises that
have guided the development of Western philosophy since the
time of Plato, and most particularly, the philosophical
foundations of the Enlightenment. Indeed, this theme of
opposition to the Enlightenment is so strong, some scholars see
postmodernism as a continuation of the “Counter-

Lights of ‘Irfán Book Nine                                     63

Enlightenment”11 that began in Germany and France in the 18th
Century and found its most influential voice in Nietzsche. The
Counter-Enlightenment      opposed      the    Enlightenment’s
proclamation of the autonomy of reason and the methods of the
natural sciences based on observation as the sole reliable
method of knowledge and the consequent rejection of the
authority of revelation, sacred writings and their accepted
interpreters tradition, prescription and every form of
nonrational and transcendent sources of knowledge ...12

Thus we can see that the central feature of the “Counter-
Enlightenment” was to question and undermine the supremacy
of reason and empiricism in the quest for knowledge and to
make room for intuition and instinct, which we deemed to be
more natural and spiritual. This feature is clearly evident in the
following characterization of postmodernism distinguished by

> an anti-(or post) epistemological standpoint; anti-
> essentialism;    anti-foundationalism;    opposition       to
> transcendental arguments and transcendental standpoints;
> rejection of the picture of knowledge as accurate
> representation; rejection of truth as correspondence to
> reality; rejection of the very idea of canonical
> descriptions’ rejection of final vocabularies, i.e. rejection
> of principles, distinctions, and descriptions that are
> thought to be unconditionally binding for all times,
> persons, and places; and a suspicion of grand narratives,
> metanarratives of the sort perhaps best illustrated by
> dialectical materialism.13

The specific meaning of this statement will become more
clear as we proceed through this paper. Postmodernism also
notably rejects the concept of reason, the rational subject, the
idea of progress, “epistemic certainty”14 and ‘truth,’ and all
manner of binary oppositions such as good and evil, nature and
culture, true and false and perhaps most surprisingly, writing
and speech.15 Steven Best and Douglas Kellner, two of the best
known scholars on postmodernism write, that in addition to
rejecting representation, i.e. the belief that theories reflect
reality, it also

> Rejects modern assumptions of social coherence and
> notions of causality in favour of multiplicity, plurality,
> fragmentation    and indeterminancy. In addition,

> socially and linguistically decentered and fragmented

subject.16
Many (though not all) of these attributes can be encapsulated
by saying that postmodernism rejects the 18th Century European
Enlightenment and its intellectual culture of seeking certain
truth and “clear and distinct comprehension”17 that could not be
doubted. This goal received its most powerful early formulation
in the work of Descartes whose famous method led him to
reject anything which could possibly de doubted.18 In the last
analysis, he discovers, what cannot be doubted is his own
existence – to doubt it, he must exist! – and the power of reason
to deliver the truth if we reason correctly.19 Thus he established
on a firm philosophical basis, the primacy of the subject in the
quest for knowledge and the primacy of reason. These ideas
became foundational to Enlightenment, i.e. ‘modernist’
thinking which built on them and applied them to the
exploration of reality.

One of the most comprehensive summaries of Enlightenment
thought is presented by Jane Flax. Despite its length, it is worth
quoting in full.
1. The existence of a stable, coherent self. Distinctive

Directly or indirectly, Flax’s summary touches on almost all
of the Enlightenment beliefs against which the postmodernists
rebelled in their various ways, thereby revealing the “deep
irrationalism at the heart of postmodernism”21 This opposition
to the Enlightenment is also why postmodern philosophy is so
heavily indebted to Nietzsche and Heidegger, who were both
scathing critics of Enlightenment thought.

What postmodernism primarily offers in return for these
wide-ranging rejections is more room for heterogeneity, for
difference and the different, for the marginalized, for the
colonized, the silenced and the outcast, be they subversive ideas
or interpretations hidden in a text, a social class or group, the
conquered, dominated, suppressed, rejected and demeaned. It

66                             Postmodernism and the Bahá’í Writings

also offers a new way to experience ourselves as subjects and a
new way of relating to reality which is regarded as a man-made
social construction. Finally, it offers freedom from being
enslaved to metanarratives or “grand narratives”22 which
threaten the independence and freedom of our lives. Thus, we
can see that postmodernism is, or sees itself, as an intellectual
liberation movement working for the freedom of oppressed
peoples and ideas. It is, therefore, at least to some extent
involved in the politics of knowledge, which means it
formulates theories with an eye to their usefulness and
suitability for its liberationist goals. It is not simply trying to
find truth but truth that makes free.

This oppositional attribute of postmodernism has been
observed by such scholars as Lloyd Spencer whose article bears
the telling title of “Postmodernism, Modernity and the
Tradition of Dissent”. Spencer writes, “postmodernism can be
seen as an extension of the critical, sceptical, dissenting – even
nihilistic – impulse of modernity.”23 This oppositional nature
fits in well with postmodernism’s liberationist agenda.

To the charge that this reduces it from a philosophy with a
disinterested quest for truth, to an ideology which seeks truth
that are useful to a particular end, the postmodern reply is that
whether conscious of it or not, all philosophy is ideology and is
working in the interests of someone or some group. A
disinterested quest for truth is a fiction to deceive others and
ourselves.

3\. Th e Founda tion s of Postm oder nism: Kant

Whereas Descartes may be seen as the initiator of the
Enlightenment or modernism in philosophy, Kant (1724 – 1804)
is generally regarded as its towering philosophical intellect.
However, Kant’s role is ambiguous, because he may also be
understood as also having laid the basis for postmodernism.
Without question, Kant gave primacy to reason in the quest for
knowledge; indeed, rationality is our most important attribute
as human beings.24 At the same time, however, Kant put
limitations on reason, restricting its effective scope to the
phenomenal world of our daily experience. “I shall show that
neither on the one path, the empirical, nor on the other, the
transcendental, can reason achieve anything, and that it
stretches its wings in vain, if it tries to soar beyond the world
of sense by the mere power of speculation.”25 Therefore, he
rejects the belief that God, Who is obviously transcendental to

Lights of ‘Irfán Book Nine                                    67

this phenomenal world, can be proved cosmologically, i.e. from
the contingent existence of phenomenal reality, we cannot
deduce the existence of a necessary and non-contingent being.26
The final result of Kant’s view is that human reason and
knowledge are confined to the phenomenal world; there is no
possibility of reasoning or obtaining knowledge about whatever
is transcendental.

According to Kant, the limitations of reason were also
demonstrated by the antinomies, that is, the equally possible but
rationally contradictory results which show “discord and
confusion produced by the conflict of the laws (antinomy) of
pure reason.”27 In other words, on some subjects – the
limitation of the universe in space and time; the concept of a
whole cosmos made of indivisible atoms; the problem of
freedom and causality; the existence of a necessarily existing
being – reason can come to opposite but equally rational
conclusions. There is simply no way to break the deadlock.
Thus, “reason makes us both believers and doubters at once”28
leaving us with grounds to believe and disbelieve in God and in
reason itself.

Kant’s third contribution to the development of the
postmodern outlook is the theory of categories. In Kant’s view,
our perceptions of the world did not arrive in the form in which
we actually experience them. Rather they arrive as ‘raw data’
which the mind processes and shapes by means of the categories
which are the conditions on which having an experience
depends. “These categories therefore are also fundamental
concepts by which we think objects in general for the
phenomena, and have therefore a priori objective validity”29
These categories, which include organizing raw data according
to time, space, causality, necessity, contingency, subsistence and
accidence among other things, constitute, that is, create our
experience of the phenomenal world. Thus, our mind shapes the
raw data of our perceptions into a coherent world which
becomes the object of our experience. In Kant’s view, we have
no way of knowing what the raw data was like before it was
shaped into the phenomenal world by the categories of the
mind; that noumenal realm must remain forever beyond our
grasp and there is no point in speculating about this terra
incognita. It is also follows clearly from Kant’s views, that to
one extent or another, the perceiving subject cannot be taken as
a mirror reflecting a pre-existing reality, which is to say, the
subject cannot access reality and deliver accurate reports about
it. Indeed, the subject is “an obstacle to cognition”30 and cannot

68                            Postmodernism and the Bahá’í Writings

be trusted.

Kant’s views laid the foundations for postmodern
constructivism, which asserts that our knowledge of reality, be
it natural, social or personal is constructed, not discovered.
Discovery is really construction as Kant’s theory of the data
organizing categories makes clear. We make the world or reality
we experience. As we shall see later, in postmodern theory, the
function of the categories is taken over by language and
culture. This means that there can be no objective knowledge or
representation of reality and that all we have are various
constructions or stories none of which is privileged over others
in terms of its truth value. (How, after all, could truth be
determined if we only have constructions and nothing to
compare our constructions against.?) Not only is external reality
hidden beneath our constructions, so is our individual self or
identity which becomes just another construction or story
among the rest. This is a profoundly different way of
experiencing oneself than the belief in an immortal soul
forming our essence. Indeed, in this view, things such as cats,
stars, species or individuals do not naturally have essences;
rather these so-called essences are constructed for our
convenience by selecting, more or less arbitrarily, a certain
number and/or kind of traits. Postmodernism as we shall see
drew the obvious lesson from Kant’s view: if reality, the world,
and the self can be constructed in one way, they can also be
constructed in another. The world and reality may be changed
by reconstructing it along new lines.

Kant also influenced postmodern thought by providing an
idea to react against, namely, the sharp division between the
perceiving (and organizing) subject and the object, the data
being organized. (Hegel, among others, already sought to
overcome this division in his philosophy) The postmodernists
want to see the subject and object as one di-polar complex, as a
self-in-the-world, as irrevocably embedded in a specific life-
situation with its unique perspective. Self and world are like
two sides of a coin, distinct but not separable from one
another.

Kant’s influence may also be felt in another area important
to postmodern thinking, namely, its rejection of metaphysical
investigation or speculation. According to Kant, it is impossible
for us to gain knowledge about anything that is not part of the
phenomenal world constituted by our mental categories. In
other words, we cannot know anything that is not organised in
accordance with the categories of time, space, causality,

Lights of ‘Irfán Book Nine                                   69

necessity, subsistence and accidence among other things. The
nature of the raw data or reality – the noumenon – before it is
perceived and shaped by the categories is forever unknowable.
Human knowledge is limited to the phenomenal realm, i.e. that
which is shaped by the categories. For this reason, cosmological
proofs of God are impossible: they attempt to reason from the
nature of phenomena to the nature of an entity – God – Who is
beyond the phenomenal. We cannot apply reason – based on our
understanding of the phenomenal world shaped by the
categories – to that which has not been shaped by the categories.
Consequently, all metaphysical speculation about non-
phenomenal reality is pointless.

Finally, Allan Megill points out another area in which Kant’s
philosophy, perhaps inadvertently, influenced postmodern
thought, namely aesthetics. If nature, in Kant’s view, was the
realm of law and our actions were the realm of the good (we
always try and achieve what appears as a good to us) then
aesthetics may be seen as a realm of freedom from these
constraints, a realm in which beauty, pleasure and satisfaction
are the goals. Kant, was read as asserting that there was “an
autonomous realm of the aesthetic”31 In other words, there is a
realm where man is free to construct however he chooses, where
man is completely free. Moreover,

Kant’s insistence on the autonomy of aesthetic judgment
leads him to deny that art has ‘truth value ... At the same time,
however, some of his statements in the Critique of Judgment
can be read as contradicting this view. For he does hint that
while art cannot supply us with knowledge in any logical sense,
it can pout us into contact with something that cannot be fully
presented in experience or grasped through concepts. 32

The lesson to be drawn from this is that only through art and
through art-making or constructing can humankind ever attain
its full measure of freedom and learn whatever ‘truth’ it is able
to learn. Art, the aesthetic, has become the model and ideal of
existence.

4\. The Foundations of Postmodernism: Nietzsche

Frederich Nietzsche (1844 – 1900) had such an enormous
influence on postmodern thought that one might well consider
him to be the first postmodernist. According to Best and
Kellner, Nietzsche’s “assault on Western rationalism profoundly
influenced Heidegger, Derrida, Deleuze, Foucault, Lyotard and
other postmodern theorists.”33 According to Clayton Koelb,

“Nietzsche initiated many of the basic concepts which stand
behind the broad concept of postmodernism.”34

Many, if not all, postmodern themes are taken up in his
various works, from the early The Birth of Tragedy to his final,
posthumously collected notes in The Will to Power. Of these,
the distrust, indeed, dislike, for reason is clearly evident in one
of his earliest and most widely read works, The Birth of
Tragedy. Nietzsche relentlessly criticizes modern culture and its
(for him) archetypal character, Socrates.

Our whole modern world is entangled in the net of
Alexandrian culture. It proposes as its ideal the theoretical man
equipped with the greatest forces of knowledge, and laboring in
the service of science, whose archetype and progenitor is Socrates.35

The “theoretical man” was Socrates, the champion of reason
and thought as the best means of discovering the truth about
ourselves and reality. In a similar vein, he writes in Twilight of
the Idols:

> Today, conversely, precisely insofar as the prejudice of
> reason forces us to posit unity, identity, permanence,
> substance, cause, thinghood, being, we see ourselves
> somehow caught in error, necessitated into error36

Socrates, the “theoretical man” has fallen prey to a profound
illusion... [an] unshakable faith that thought, using the thread
of logic, can penetrate the deepest abysses of being, and that
thought is capable not only of knowing being but even of
correcting it. This sublime metaphysical illusion accompanies
science as an instinct and leads science again and again to its
limits at which it must turn into art: which is really the aim of
this mechanism.37

Nietzsche calls Socrates a “mystagogue of science”38 with
whom originated “the spirit of science... the faith in the
explicability of nature and in knowledge as a panacea.”39
Despite claims to be seeking the truth, the mission of science is
really to comfort humankind by making existence appear
comprehensible and thus justified; and if reasons do not suffice,
myth had to come to their aid in the end—myth which I have
just called the necessary consequence, indeed the purpose, of
science40

Therefore, the mission of science – and the quest for
knowledge in general – is to provide comforting illusions such
as the notion that the universe is an orderly place and/or a place

we can understand. To do this, science has “first spread a
common net of thought [“myth”] over the whole globe, actually
holding out the prospect of the lawfulness of an entire solar
system.”41 However, Nietzsche is not hopeful that this strategy
will be successful: “But science, spurred by its powerful illusion,
speeds irresistibly towards its limits where its optimism,
concealed in the essence of logic, suffers shipwreck.”42

These passages explicitly and implicitly point to other
Nietzschean themes in addition to scepticism about knowledge
and science, logic and reason. For example, Nietzsche’s
scepticism about truth is plainly evident when he says, “Truth is
the kind of error without which a certain species of life could
not live. The value of life is ultimately decisive.”43 What is
essential about truth is not that it is true but that it serves life:
“[t]he criterion of truth resides in the enhancement of the
feeling of power.”44 In other words, truth is not which is
actually the case but that which meets our needs in the struggles
of life – a view of truth that is highly subjective and which
allows there to be as many truths as there are individuals with
needs. When we think in existential terms, such might indeed be
the case – we all have our own personal truths – but it is
difficult to see how this could meaningfully apply to
mathematics, medicine, science or history. Elsewhere he says
that truth is “Inertia; that hypothesis which gives rise to
contentment; smallest expenditure of spiritual force.”45 In a
similar vein, he writes, “The biggest fable of all is the fable of
knowledge,”46 thereby expressing his doubts about the existence
of knowledge, something he had already done in The Birth of
Tragedy by calling science a myth.

Nietzsche also strikes several postmodern notes when he
writes:

> Will to truth is a making firm, a making true and durable,
> an abolition of the false character of things, a
> reinterpretation of it into beings. “Truth” is therefore not
> something there, that might be found or discovered – but
> something that must be created and that gives a name to a
> process, or rather to a will to overcome that has in itself
> no end – introducing truth as a processus in infinitum, and
> active determining – not a becoming conscious of
> something that is itself firm and determined. It is a word
> for the “will to power”.47

Nietzsche tells us that the “will to truth” is seen in acts of
will, in “making” things “true and durable;” it is an “active

determining.” Thus he identifies the “will to truth” with the
“will to power,” which implicitly rejects the notion that truth is
simply our discovery of what is the case. Indeed, he it clear that
truth is something we make, or create by an act of will, and that
this willing process goes on forever. Final truth is, in the last
analysis, unattainable. It is also a product of human creativity:

> What, then, is truth? A mobile army of metaphors,
> metonyms, and anthropomorphisms—in short, a sum of
> human relations which have been enhanced, transposed,
> and embellished poetically and rhetorically, and which
> after long use seem firm, canonical, and obligatory to a
> people: truths are illusions about which one has forgotten
> that this is what they are; metaphors which are worn out
> and without sensuous power; coins which have lost their
> pictures and now matter only as metal, no longer as
> coins.48
Truth, we might say, is an artistic human creation, a
convenient fiction.

This position has at least six consequences that bore fruit
among postmodern thinkers. First, if truth is man-made, then
humankind has no access to reality, only its own fabrications – a
theme we already saw in Kant’s division between the accessible
phenomenal world and the inaccessible noumenal realm. This
aesthetic theory of knowledge rules out any form of the
correspondence theory of truth. Second, we observe the clear
identification of the “will to truth” and the “will to power.” If
these two are the same, then it is hard to avoid the conclusion
that any claim to possessing truth is also a claim to power, i.e.
those who claim to have truth are really advancing power claims
over others. Third, truth is subjective insofar as it reflects what
we need and desire, and what we project or impose on ‘reality.’
It is obvious, of course, that in this situation it is difficult to
speak of reality at all, since there can be no one thing to which
that term refers. Fourth, since truths are artistic creations – “are
illusions” – there is no objective external standard by which to
judge among truth claims and we can embrace them all as
equally true or reject them all as equally false. In other words,
this view exemplifies a thorough-going relativism (if we accept
them all as somehow true) and scepticism (if we reject them all
as doubtful.) Fifth, is the aesthetizing of reality, i.e. presenting
it as a work of art, an idea that will later bear fruit with
postmodern thinkers treating the world like a text or, as in
Baudrillard’s case, quite literally as an artistic work. Sixth, the
Nietzschean concept of truth as an artistic creation makes it

clear that the concept of an ‘objective’, disinterested quest for
or contemplation of the truth is “conceptual nonsense.”49
Because the quest for knowledge is a manifestation of the will
to power, all truth is ‘interested’ truth, i.e. truth with an
agenda.50 This is also true because all truth is perspectival: “The
only seeing we have is seeing from a perspective; the only
knowledge we have is knowledge from a perspective,”51 a
position sometimes referred to as perspectivism.

According to Nietzsche’s perspectivism, all statements of any
kind represent only one particular and limited perspective
embedded in the concrete realities of a specific human existence
which has no more legitimate claim to being true than any other.
There is no neutral, ‘Archimedean point’ from which reality can
be ‘objectively observed.’ Speaking of philosophers, Nietzsche
writes,

> Every one of them pretends that he has discovered and
> reached his opinions through the self-development of cold,
> pure, divinely untroubled dialectic ... whereas at bottom a
> pre-conceived dogma, an “institution” or mostly a heart’s
> desire made abstract and refined is defended by them with
> arguments sought after the fact. hey are all lawyers ... and
> for the most part quite sly defenders of their prejudices
> which they christen “truths”... 52

The unbiased, objective quest for truth as such is a willow-
the-wisp; every claim to know truth is an expression of personal
interest, of the will-to-power. This claim has obvious logical
problem with self-reference: since it applies to Nietzsche’s view
as well, any universal truth value of his statement dissolves
itself – and we find ourselves trapped in the midst of an infinite
number of competing perspectives. Postmodernist philosophers,
however, have simply brushed this problem aside and adopted
Nietzsche’s perspectivism.

From this we can naturally draw the conclusion that what we
call ‘truth’ is only an interpretation; indeed, Nietzsche says,
“facts is precisely what there is not, only interpretations. We
cannot establish any fact "in itself": perhaps it is folly to want
to do such a thing.”53 Nor do things have an essential nature
apart from our constructions and interpretations.54 Perhaps the
following quote may be used to sum up Nietzsche’s prevailing
attitude and beliefs: “There exists neither "spirit," nor reason,
nor thinking, nor consciousness, nor soul, nor will, nor truth:
all are fictions that are of no use.”55

To the suggestion that truth is more valuable than lies or
fictions no matter how convenient they are, Nietzsche answers:
“It is no more than a moral prejudice that truth is worth more
than semblance”56 and then asks, “Why couldn’t the world which
matters to us be a fiction?”57 Why not, indeed, since “the will to
know [is based on] the foundation of a much more forceful
will, namely the will to not-know, to uncertainty, to un-
truth!”58 Humankind wants – needs – its deceptions, and
therefore one should not struggle too much for truth since “it
stupefies, bestializes and brutalizes you.”59 The ‘truth-game’ is
not worth the candle:

> The world with which you are concerned is false, i.e. it is
> not a fact but a fable and `approximation on the basis of a
> meagre sum of observations.; it is “in flux,” as something
> in a state of becoming, as a falsehood always changing but
> never getting near the truth: for – there is no “truth.”60
Obviously, therefore, no eternal or absolute truths exist, and
that being the case, no so-called truths can serve as the
foundations of any system of metaphysics, ethics, philosophical
systems or, what postmodernism refers to as “grand
narratives.”61 Nietzsche’s rejection of truth is matched by his
equally firm rejection of God. Zarathustra tells his listeners,
“God is a conjecture; but I desire that your conjectures should
not reach beyond your creative will. Could you create a god?
Then do not speak to me of any gods.”62 In other words,
Zarathustra-Nietzsche rejects transcendence, i.e. anything that
is beyond the powers of the human will to create just as Kant
rejects anything beyond the power of the human mind to know.
Rather than wasting time with God, Zarathustra advises people
to turn their energies into overcoming their humanity, and thus
making way for the greater-than-man, the “overman” or
superman” as he is sometimes called: “But you could well create
the overman.”63 Later, Zarathustra says that “man is something
that must be overcome – that man is a bridge and no end.”64 We
should try to surpass our humanity and become something
greater, or, if we cannot, at least help clear the way for
something greater. In postmodernism this idea resurfaces as the
theme of the ‘death of man,’ which plays an especially
important role in the work of Michel Foucault.

5\. The Foundations of Postmodernism: Heidegger

Though he is a highly controversial figure because of his one-
time open support of the Nazi party, Martin Heidegger (1990 –

1976), perhaps the pre-eminent, most quoted philosopher of the
20th Century, is second only to Nietzsche in terms of influence
on postmodern thought. Heidegger influenced postmodernism
in six main ways. First, he rejects the metaphysics of the entire
western     philosophical    tradition   with the       exception
Anaximander, one of the pre-Socratics. The western tradition’s
metaphysics and the resulting subject/object epistemology leads
to a utilitarian-scientific-technological world view that
impoverishes our lives. Second, he rejects calculative, utilitarian
view of reason as the sole source of legitimate knowledge and
the rejection of the correspondence theory of truth. Therefore,
the concept of ‘truth’ cannot be limited to rationalized
propositions about beings but must include knowledge of the
Being of beings. Third, he sees truth as aletheia, the disclosure
of the Being of beings; truth is not discovered by us but rather
discloses or reveals itself. He also recognises the fundamental
ambiguity of all knowledge. Fourth, he dismisses the notion of
absolute final truth. Fifth, he doubts the ability of verbal
propositions to mirror or reflect reality. Sixth, he sees the task
of art and especially poetry as the disclosure of the Being of
beings. Finally, in Heidegger’s view, language is not a
transparent medium and helps constitute our being-in-the-world
and our life-world.

For reasons uniquely his own, Heidegger, like Kant and
Nietzsche seeks to avoid or rather, “overcome”65 metaphysics
whereby he reinforces the anti-metaphysical trend already
evident in 20th Century philosophy. Postmodern philosophy as
we shall see is a part of this trend. Metaphysics – defined as “the
philosophical investigation of the nature, constitution and
structure of reality,”66 – has, according to Heidegger, gone
askew since the time of Anaximander and continuously
“misconstrues being”67 insofar as it forgets the “question of
Being”68 and replaces it with concern for particular beings.
Thus, Being, which is everywhere manifested in all things. and
which transcends all things, is falsely described as “the most
universal and the emptiest of concepts”69 and is ignored; it
ceases to be a subject of investigation in itself. No western
philosopher since Plato has sought to describe the nature of
Being as such. Instead, Being is replaced by interest in individual
beings.

Metaphysics does indeed represent beings in their being, and
so it also thinks the being of beings. But it does not think being
as such, does not think the difference between being and
beings70.

Being and beings are confused with one another. Elsewhere,
Heidegger says, Metaphysics, insofar as it always represents
only beings as beings, does not recall Being itself. Philosophy
does not concentrate on its ground.71

According to Heidegger, this failure to deal with the Being of
beings, leads to metaphysics and science both of which depend
on a diminished understanding of truth: “ To metaphysics the
nature of truth always appears only in derivative form of the
truth of propositions. which formulate our knowledge.”72 In
short, we know a lot about things and stuff but have forgotten
Being itself.

To illustrate what he means, Heidegger compares Being to
color and to the Earth in statements that recall Wordsworth’s
passionate assertion,

> Our meddling intellect
> Mishapes the beauteous forms of things;
> - We murder to dissect.73
In a similar vein, Heidegger writes,

> Color shines and wants only to shine. When we analyse it
> in rational terms by measuring its wavelengths, it is gone.
> It shows itself only when it remains undisclosed and
> unexplained. Earth thus shatters every attempt to
> penetrate into it. it causes every merely calculating
> importunity to turn to a destruction ... The earth appears
> only cleared and as itself when it is perceived and
> preserved as that which is by nature undisclosable ....”74
Our propositional knowledge and calculative or
technological reason tell us nothing about color as it makes
itself present (“presences” as a verb in Heidegger’s language) to
us, just as our knowledge of earth-science and technology
cannot makes us aware of the Being of the Earth. Technology
concerns itself not with the Being of things but “the imposition
of man’s will upon the world,”75 upon individual beings. It does
not care if it really knows a thing with which it co-dwells in the
world but only that it achieves mastery and dominion over it To
know the Being of the thing, we must open ourselves to its
Being just as we need to open ourselves to the experience of
color. In effect, we need what Wordsworth calls “a heart/ That
watches and receives.”76

Heidegger’s analysis and the conclusions he draws from it

have deeply influenced postmodern (and ecological) philosophy.
Immediately noticeable is that rational and scientific knowledge
(measurement) are limited in what they can tell us and do not
exhaust what can be known about a particular being. They are
merely one kind of knowledge from one particular perspective,
one interpretation about a thing and not knowledge per se; it is
quite possible for other thinkers or cultures with different
perspectives to have developed different kinds of equally valid
knowledge of specific beings. Therefore it is impossible to
claim that any one kind of knowledge of beings is privileged or
has priority over any other. No propositional knowledge is
absolute; it is all relative. As Heidegger says, “There is no
absolute truth across the incommensurable understandings of
being or world-disclosures.”77

This, inevitably, brings us to the question of the meaning of
‘truth’. According to Heidegger, the usual definition of truth
involves the idea of something or a state of affairs being
“actual,”78 of being “the correspondence of knowledge to the
matter,”79 or the correspondence of something “with the “
‘rational’ concept of its essence.”80 However, he disagrees with
this view: “Thus truth has by no means the structure of an
agreement between knowing and the object in the sense of a
likening of one entity (the subject) to another (the Object).”81
In taking this position, Heidegger implicitly throws into
question the subject/object distinction and relationship that has
been the bedrock of western epistemology. If truth is not a
correspondence between subject and object of perception, what
could it be? In Heidegger’s view, the correspondence theory of
truth is also inadequate because it ignores our relationship to
Being, the interpretation or understanding of which influences
our self-understanding as human and thus our relationship to
the specific beings we encounter. Our usual propositions about
specific beings are made as though they were products of an
intellect that is independent of any relation to and
interpretation of Being.82

This, of course is false because conscious of it or not, all
beings have a relationship to Being. For this reason, “the
traditional assignment of truth exclusively to statements as the
sole essential locus of truth falls away. Truth does not originally
reside in the proposition.”83 It is important to note that truth
does nor arise “originally” in propositions, i.e. that there is a
deeper, more primordial original truth which manifests itself in
specific beings. Thus Heidegger does not think propositional
truth is fully adequate to reality.

Furthermore, he also has doubts about the possibility of a
meaningful relation between propositions and things, which is
to say, he doubts that mere verbal propositions lacking proper
grounding in a relationship to Being can ever satisfactorily
correspond to real specific beings. In Being and Time, he asks,
“In what way is this relation [of correspondence] possible as a
relation between intellectus [mind/intellect] and res
[thing/object]?”84 From this question,

> it becomes plain that to clarify the structure of a truth it
> is not enough simply to presuppose this relational totality
> [of complete correspondence between mind and object]
> but we must go back and inquire into the context of Being
> which provides the support for this totality as such.85
These passages also point out that our awareness of and
attitude towards Being i.e. our “comportment”86 towards Being
influences our self-understanding as human beings which in turn
influences our relationship to specific beings. We, may for
example, ignore Being, and ourselves as a place where Being
reveals itself, and see ourselves strictly as things whose existence
is limited to the superficial daily aspects being – purely
utilitarian considerations, getting, spending, dominating and
being dominated – and, as a consequence, develop a purely
calculative rational approach towards ourselves and the things
of this world. We may reduce things in our surroundings to
mere objects for use or domination, a fate from which artists
and especially poets must rescue them.87 Such objectifying leads
to the dominance of technology in our lives and relationship to
others and nature. Furthermore, Heidegger suggests that reason
is not independent of other factors in our lives which is to say,
is not transcendent i.e. objective or uninfluenced by our lives
and therefore cannot provide a transcending and universal
overview of reality that is uniform for all human viewpoints.
“[A]ll truth is relative to Dasein’s [man’s] Being.”88

According to Heidegger, truth is more than the mere
propositions of calculative reason or a correspondence between
a subject and object: truth, in the primary sense, is aletheia,
unconcealing or “disclosedness”89 of Being and the Being of
beings, of letting Being be, of having, as Wordsworth says, “a
heart/ That watches and receives.” Thus, for Heidegger,
existential truth is prior to propositional truth which implies
that the disclosure of Being depends on our comportment or
demeanour towards Being and the Being of beings including
ourselves. The willingness to let Being be, to let the Being of
things unconceal itself to us is man’s original way of knowing

and only later does he ‘fall’ into forgetfulness of Being to
satisfy himself with superficial, calculative, utilitarian reason
and metaphysical propositions.

However, there is a fundamental ambiguity to aletheia for
every unconcealing is also a concealing of Being and the Being
of beings. “The disclosure of beings as such is simultaneously
and intrinsically the concealing of being as a whole”90 because

> [i]n the simultaneity of disclosure and concealing errancy
> holds sway. Errancy and the concealing of what is
> concealed belong to the primordial essence of truth.91
> Thus, Being is always simultaneously disclosed and
> undisclosed, because these two conditions, like truth and
> untruth are not distinct absolutes but are correlates.

Precisely because letting be always lets beings be in a particular
comportment [mood,

> stance, attitude] which relates to them and thus discloses
> them, it conceals beings as a whole. 92

Because truth is always the truth of a particular being with a
particular comportment to Being as well as existing in a
particular situation, the whole of Being can never disclose itself
to us at any one time. Our availability to Being is always partial,
and therefore, the unconcealing of Being is also a concealing.
We are always faced with a ‘hidden dimension’ in our
encounters with all beings. Because of this, our knowledge of
the Being of things is unlimited; indeed, it is infinite, and for
that reason there can be no limit to our knowledge of the Being
of beings. This idea bore particular fruit in the work of Derrida,
whose deconstructionism posited that no one approach to or
reading of a text could possibly disclose the entirety of its
meaning. There was undisclosed discord between what was
revealed and what was concealed and this discord enable
virtually an endless number of readings just as artists and poets
could disclose endless aspects of the Being of beings. A final
disclosure or reading is an impossibility.

In Heidegger’s view, the arts, above all poetry and painting
disclose the Being of beings; the artist “speaks ... in a
nonsubjective, Being-attuned voice.”93 Art, has a deep
epistemological function, it “puts us in touch ... with a truth
that we cannot attain otherwise than through art.”94

> The Greeks called the unconcealedness of beings aletheia.

We say “truth” and think little enough in using this word.

> If there occurs in the work a disclosure of a particular
> being, disclosing what and how it is, then there is here an
> occurring, a happening of truth at work .. Some particular
> entity ... comes in the work to stand in the light of its
> being. The being of the being comes into the steadiness of
> its shining.95
Thus, the artist rather than the scientist is in a unique
position to lead us to the truth of Being. S/he is the one who
can “get men to think about the involvement of Being in human
nature.”96

However, it is difficult to avoid the conclusion that the poet
has primary status for Heidegger because of the role that
language plays in constituting man (Dasein): “discourse is
constitutive for Dasein’s existence”97 Language is not just a
clear medium for representing things or ideas. Rather,

> [l]anguage is a totality of words – a totality in which
> discourse has a ‘worldly’ Being of its own; and as an entity
> within-the-world, this totality thus becomes something
> which we may come across ready-to-hand.98
Because language is encountered like other beings in the
world, it has a “ ‘worldly’ Being of its own”, it can act on us and
shape i.e. ‘constitute’ our existence in a variety of ways.
Fulfilling this function makes it impossible that language is
merely representational of things or ideas, which in turn means
that language, as a medium with a character of its own, cannot
point us to any transcendental, absolute truths somehow apart
from this world. Here we can already observe the first rejection
of what postmodernists call “representationalism.” Failure to
appreciate this aspect of language leads to a “metaphysics of
presence” i.e. the belief that through the clear medium of
language we can attain and perceive the presence of thins as
they really are.

6\. Jean -Fran cois Lyotar d

Jean-Francois Lyotard (1924 – 1998), one of the premier
philosophers of the postmodern movement, is best known for
his book The Postmodern Condition which first brought the
term ‘postmodern’ into common usage. This book, containing
in seminal form most of the later developments of his thought,
provides on of the most frequently quoted definitions of
postmodernism: “I define postmodern as incredulity toward
metanarratives.”99 By “metanarratives,” (also called “grand

narrative[s]”100), Lyotard means those ‘stories’ or intellectual
frameworks by which we interpret the world and our activities
and thereby provide meaning for the whole and give certain data
the status of being facts, truths or real knowledge. For example,
Marxism supplied revolutionaries around the world with a
metanarrative encompassing the behavior of matter i.e.
dialectical materialism, as well as the nature, direction and
future outcome of human history, i.e. historical materialism.
The Enlightenment metanarrative concerned the gradual
triumph of reason over irrationality and the progress of
humankind not only in scientific knowledge but also in the
progress towards rational freedom and a tolerant society. The
Christian metanarrative tells the story of humankind’s fall from
grace and its redemption by Christ Whose word must be spread
throughout the world.

All of these metanarratives offer a complete or total vision
by which all possible human action may be interpreted and/or
judged and for this reason Lyotard describes them as a “project
of totalization.”101 The connotation of ‘totalitarian’ is fully
intended by Lyotard who even describes metanarratives as
“terrorist”102 because they can be used to “eliminate[] or
threaten[] to eliminate, a player [point of view, culture] from
the language game one shares with them.”103 From another
perspective we might say that one of the tasks of a
metanarrative is the “legitimation of knowledge,”104 which is to
say that the metanarrative provides the foundational principles
by which to distinguish ‘real knowledge’ from error, folklore,
myth or the babblings of the insane. Thus, the metanarrative
becomes the gatekeeper of knowledge – and, by extension, the
guardian of crucial binary oppositions necessary for a system of
thought or social system to maintain itself. Examples of such
binary oppositions are order / disorder; sane / insane; noumenal
/ phenomenal; true / untrue; competent / incompetent;
knowledge / superstition; rational / irrational and primitive /
civilized. By means of these oppositions, metanarratives take on
a prescriptive function not only for individuals but for entire
societies who must conduct themselves personally and/or
collectively to its standards which are enforced not just by
institutions but by all those who accept the metanarrative.
Lyotard (like Foucault) of course believes this prescriptive
function imprisons us and the “incredulity toward
metanarratives”105 is a means of freeing ourselves from their
rule. For Lyotard, this means freeing ourselves from modernity
which “is identified with modern reason, Enlightenment,
totalizing thought and philosophies of history.”106 Lyotard

“rejects notions of universalist and foundational theory as well
as claims that one method or set of concepts has privileged
status.”107

In The Post Modern Condition Lyotard also explains his
views in terms of “language games”108 i.e. systems of discourse
or utterance working on the basis of certain rules that “are the
objects of a contract, explicit or not, between the players.”109
Without these rules (which may have been inherited) there is no
game. In the language game every utterance is a “move.”110 Each
metanarrative, each culture and subculture plays its own
language game; indeed, “language games are the minimum
relation required for society to exist”111 – a statement indicating
that societies and language games are absolute correlatives.
Concepts and statements only have meaning within the context
of a particular game and each game must “privilege certain
classes of statements ... whose predominance characterizes the
discourse of the particular institution.”112 The postmodern
“incredulity towards metanarrative” in favour of the “little
narrative [petit recit]”113 i.e. the limited narrative without
universal claims or implications, leads inevitably to the
fragmentation of language games and the elimination of
metanarratives. In the words of critic and philosopher Terry
Eagleton, “Postmodernism, then, is wary of History but
enthusiastic on the whole about history.”114

Lyotard takes particular aim at the metanarrative of science
which he portrays as one language game among others without
any special or privileged status in the quest for knowledge:
“[t]he game of science is ... put on par with the others.”115 In his
view, both science and “non-scientific (narrative) knowledge”116
i.e. rationality and narrative operate on the basis of different
rules, and what is a good “move” in one game is not necessarily
“good” in the other. Consequently

> [i]t is therefore impossible to judge the existence or
> validity of narrative knowledge. On the basis of scientific
> knowledge and vice versa: the relevant criteria are
> different. All we can do is gaze in wonderment at the
> diversity of discursive species ... 117
Elsewhere he says, “science plays its own game; it is incapable
of legitimating other language games”118; indeed, it cannot even
legitimate itself since like any other language game it cannot
demonstrate the truth of its own ground rules which are simply
“the object of consensus.”119 The rules are accepted not because
they are true but because we happen to agree on them. Very

clearly, Lyotard does not privilege rationality in the quest for
knowledge.

7\. Jacq ues Derrida

Jacques Derrida (1930 – 2004) is the originator of
deconstructionism, perhaps the most influential version of
postmodernist philosophy developed so far. According to
Jonathan Culler, one of deconstruction’s foremost expositors

> To deconstruct a discourse [text] is to show how it
> undermines the philosophy it asserts, or the hierarchical
> oppositions on which it relies by identifying in the text the
> rhetorical operations that produce the supposed ground of
> argument, the key concept or premise.120

In other words, in some way, every text undermines or
subverts itself and thus destabilises any attempt to find in it a
final, fixed, permanent meaning It is important to note that this
subversion occurs from within. As Derrida says,

> The movements of deconstruction do not destroy
> structures from the outside. They are not possible and
> effective nor can they take accurate aim except by
> inhabiting those structures ... Operating necessarily from
> the inside, borrowing all the strategic and economic
> resources of subversion from the old structure ... 121

The text subverts or works against itself through its choice
of words and phrases, the ambiguity of some words and phrases,
rhetorical devices and/or imagery. Perhaps the best known
example of this procedure is “Plato’s Pharmacy,” in which
Derrida explores Plato’s “”Phaedrus”:

> The word pharmakon [remedy] is caught in a chain of
> significations. The play of that chain seems systematic.
> But the system here is not, simply, that of the intentions
> of an author who goes by the name of Plato.122

However, as Derrida points out, pharmakon means not only
‘remedy’ but also ‘poison’ not to mention ‘spell’ or ‘drug’ (as in
hallucinogen) and this “chain of significations” serves to
destabilise any simplistic interpretation of the text. Writing,
which Thoth had introduced as a remedy for humankind’s poor
memory, is also a ‘poison’ that weakens memory, and may cast a
‘spell’ over us by making us think we have understood an idea
when we have not.

> If the pharmakon is “ambivalent,” it is because it
> constitutes the medium in which opposites are opposed,
> the movement and the play that links them among
> themselves, reverses them or makes one side cross over
> into the other (body/soul, good/evil, inside/outside,
> memory/forgetfulness,     speech/writing, etc)...  The
> pharmakon is the movement, the locus and the play: (the
> production of) difference.123
Each reading of ‘pharmacy’ evokes another, often contrary
meaning; we recognize the difference between ‘remedy’ and
‘poison’ and in choosing one, even if only for a moment, we
‘defer’ the other meanings which, despite being deferred, help
complete our understanding of the text. These other meanings
are referred to as ‘supplements,’ (Derrida who is very inventive
in coining new terms for his concepts and often has several
terms for identical concepts.) This process of recognizing
difference and deferring Derrida calls “difference” (note the
spelling) and in his view every text is an endless play of
‘differance’ as we defer, or temporarily push into the
background, the meanings of various words. Each of these
deferred meanings helps complete the full meaning of a word
and for that reason, “The play of the supplement is
indefinite.”124 Derrida makes the same point by stating that
“writing structurally carries within itself (counts-discounts) the
process of its own erasure and annulation...”125 By “erasure”
Derrida does not mean that one meaning of a word is absolutely
excluded but rather that we read a word with awareness of all its
other potential meanings instead of privileging one, usually
conventional, meaning over all the others. We read the word
with all of its meanings, aware of the ambiguity this causes in
our understanding of the text itself.

To the objection that such supplementation is simply an
arbitrary and extraneous addition to what is clearly the author’s
intention, Derrida replies

> Certain forces of association unite – at diverse distances,
> with different strengths and according to disparate paths –
> the words “actually present” in a discourse with all the
> other words in the lexical system whether or not they
> appears as “words ...126
This claim is based on Derrida’s belief – derived from
Saussure – that meanings of words are not given by
“transcendental”, i.e. extra-linguistic reference to the outside
world but only by their relationship to other words. The

signifier does not receive its meaning from the external or
‘transcendental’ signified; there is no longer a direct relationship
between them and we can no longer claim that signifier = the
signified. Instead of referring to an external, ‘transcendental’
signified, the signifier refers us – endlessly as it turns out – to
other words in the linguistic system. Thus, language, statements,
propositions are not reflections of an external or transcendental
reality but only reflect the various “plays” of meaning within a
linguistic system. After all, each word is, ultimately related to
every other word and its meaning depends on the “play of
differences within that system.”127 The meaning of each word is
“inter-textualized”128 with all the others so that each bears a
“trace” of all other words. For that reason there is no inside our
outside of a text: “We do not believe that there exists, in all
rigor, a Platonic text closed upon itself complete with its inside
and its outside.”129 Simply using words that are part of a
language system ensures that the text is in some way influenced
by all these other meanings and that these other meanings may
play some role in the understanding of the text. This presence
yet simultaneous absence of these other meanings is called the
“trace”. The scope of these traces is endless, for which reason
Derrida says, “There is nothing outside of the text”130

> beyond and behind what one believes can be circumscribed
> as [a] text, there has never been anything but writing;
> there have never been anything but supplements,
> substitutive significations, which could only come forth in
> a chain of differential references, the “real” supervening,
> and being added only while taking on meaning from the
> trace and from an invocation of the supplement etc. And
> thus to infinity.”131

Derrida also approaches the subject of endless
supplementation from the perspective of “play” by which he
means a word’s ‘give’ or tolerance for variation of meanings
and suggestions: “Play is always the play of absence and
presence”132 of all possible traces (of other meanings) which he
also describes as a “field of infinite substitutions.”133 In
addition, Derrida defines play as “the absence of the
transcendental signified as limitlessness of play, that is to say, as
the destruction of ontotheology and the metaphysics of
presence.”134 This simply means that there is no pre-existing
essential meaning in a text i.e. no “transcendental signified”,
that waits us to perceive and understand it, that exists before us
and even without us, and that becomes ‘present’ to us when we
think     ‘correctly.’    This     pre-existing,     unconstructed

“transcendental signified” can also be referred to as “an
invariable presence – eidos, arche, telos, energia, ousia (essence,
existence, substance, subject) aletheia [disclosure, revelation of
truth], transcendentality, consciousness, God, man and so
forth.”135 The “metaphysics of presence” and “ontotheology” are
the product of thinking in terms of such pre-existent, invariable
and self-sufficient essences. Such thinking is deceptive because
it fails to take into account the ambiguities of meaning revealed
by the “play” of substitutions, supplements and traces which
makes the existence of such independent and self-sufficient
meanings (and entities) a chimera. It leads to the dangerous
delusion that some of us actually know the complete and final
truth about something, have privileged knowledge, are
privileged knowers or have privileged methods of accessing
certain knowledge. This, in turn, leads us to marginalise,
disregard or even oppress other kinds of knowledge and other
ways of knowing. Such is already the case with western
philosophy vis-à-vis non-western philosophy.136 Finally, it
should be noted that in this view, a text has no meaning before
anyone has interpreted it.137 There is no truth outside of or
transcendental to, the interpretation and telling.

Another important aspect of Derrida’s deconstructionism is
what he calls “logocentrism,”138 a complex word rooted in the
Greek ‘logos’ which means not only ‘word’ but also ‘truth’ or
‘reason.’ According to Derrida, all philosophy since the time of
Plato has been the “epoch of the logos”139 and one project of
deconstruction is to undermine the domination of logocentrism
in western thought. In its simplest terms, logocentrism assumes
that at the centre of any concept is a meaning or essence that
exists before the construction of its meaning and is
undeconstructible in itself. This unconstructed and
undeconstructible essence, is ‘transcendent’ to its embodiment
in language, i.e. is not dependent on its linguistic embodiment
for its meaning, i.e. is self-sufficient and complete in what it
means. Our understanding of a concept is true insofar as it
corresponds to this “transcendental signified” which “in and of
itself, in its essence, would refer to no signifier [word in the
linguistic system], would exceed the chain of signs and would
no longer as itself function as a signifier.”140 This
“transcendental signified” also serves as a guarantee for the
fixed meanings of the words we employ. Derrida states that he
has “identified logocentrism and the metaphysics of presence as
the exigent, powerful, systematic, and irrepressible desire for
such a signified.”141 The “metaphysics presence” is that
philosophical thinking which is interested in defining the

ultimate self-sufficient meanings of terms such as God, Reality,
Truth, Matter, Mind, Consciousness, Time and Self and resists
the conclusion that these, like all other words, are undecidable.
These, like the Biblical “Logos”142 precede any human perception
of their meaning, and the aim of the metaphysics of presence is
to make their true meaning present to us through language.
However, for deconstructionism this is a hopeless quest because
the meaning of these words is undecidable: “meaning cannot be
held in any individual sign since it is always deferred due to the
fact that every sign is a signifier whose signified is another
signifier.”143 As Derrida puts it, “The play of differences
supposes, in effect, syntheses and referrals which forbid at any
moment or in any sense that a simple element [meaning] be
present in and of itself, referring only to itself.”144

Derrida also rejects logocentrism and the metaphysics of
presence for their dependence on oppositional binaries which
privilege one side over the other. Examples of such oppositional
binaries are God/creation; Truth/untruth; Good/evil;
Justice/injustice;    rational/irrational;   Being/nothingness;
Mind/matter and Self/not-self.145 Since the meanings of these
binaries are, in the last analysis, undecidable, there is no
justification for privileging one of the pair and marginalising
the other.

Derrida maintains that logocentrism and the metaphysics of
presence have an enormously negative impact on culture and
human behavior. Nowhere is this made more clear than in his
essay “Violence and Metaphysics: An Essay on the Thought of
Emmanuel Levinas.”

Although ostensibly about Levinas’ philosophy, the essay also
serves to outline Derrida’s views about problems with
phenomenology146 and ontology147 both of which are largely
concerned with the essences of things, that is, those necessary
qualities which a thing must have to be the kind of thing it is.
Thus, they focus on kinds more than on individuals, for which
reason Derrida says, Incapable of respecting the Being and
meaning of the other, phenomenology and ontology would be
philosophies of violence. Through them, the entire philosophical
tradition, in its meaning and at bottom, would make common
cause with oppression and with the totalitarianism of the
same.148

In short, metaphysics does not respect the other as other but
seeks to incorporate or appropriate it in some way, forgetting
that “[t]he infinitely-other cannot be bound by a concept.”149

The other can never be reduced to common denominators or
subsumed by a general concept of ‘essence’: “the other is the
other only if his alterity is absolutely irreducible.”150 Reducing
the other to a common essence is a form of violence that
inevitably breeds a violent frame of mind and violent discourse
and finally physical violence.

8\. Michel Foucault

Like Jacques Derrida, Michel Foucault (1926-1984) has been
enormously influential in fields outside of his specialities of
philosophy and social history. His writings cover such diverse
topics as the social construction of madness151 and sexuality152,
methods in historiography153, penology154, the nature of power
and discourse. He has had an incalculable effect on cultural
studies, political theory, feminism and sociology.155 It should be
noted that there is a certain amount of debate over whether or
not Foucault is a postmodernist but it is our view that he shares
so many relevant fundamental characteristics with Kant,
Nietzsche, Heidegger, Lyotard and Derrida, that his own refusal
of the label notwithstanding, he is a part of this movement.156

Like Lyotard, Foucault rejects the concept of “grand
narratives”, i.e. he does not believe that it is possible to write
generalized histories that covers all aspects of a particular
civilization. He spells this out clearly in The Archaeology of
Knowledge:

> the theme and possibility of a total history begins to
> disappear ... The project of a total history is one that seeks
> to reconstitute the overall form of a civilization, the
> principle – material or spiritual – of a society, the
> significance common to all the phenomena of a period, the
> law that accounts for their cohesion ...157
Rather, he proposes what he calls “the new history”158 which
pays more attention to “discontinuity”159, to the “series,
divisions, limits, differences of level, shifts, chronological
specificities, particular forms of rehandling, possible types of
relation.”160 Just as Derrida proclaims the necessity of
subverting any authoritative reading of a text, Foucault believes
that “the tranquility with which they [the usual historical
narratives driven by grand themes] are received must be
disturbed”161 by renounc[ing] all those themes whose function is
to ensure infinite continuity of discourse.”162 Historical
discourse must be broken up into what Lyotard calls “little
narratives” or petits recits because only when previously glossed

over differences become apparent will new fields of research be
visible and available for investigation. We will become aware of
discrepancies and differences that have been covered up by large
sweeping unifying concepts and no longer lose sight of subtle
but important shifts in meaning and usage. Each concept,
person and event must be understood in terms of its exact
specificity in time, place and culture.

Thus, Foucault’s historiography not only stresses breaks and
discontinuities rather than grand similarities, changes in ideas
and practices rather than extended homogeneities, but also what
he calls the “epistemes” in which knowledge, envisaged apart
from all criteria having reference to its rational value or to its
objective forms grounds its positivity , and thereby manifests a
history which is not that of its growing perfection, but rather
that of its conditions of possibility ... such an enterprise is not
so much a history, in the traditional meaning of the word, as an
‘archaeology.’163

In other words, the episteme is the ‘soil’ from which
‘vegetation’ of ideas, behaviors, experiences, customs and
beliefs grows; it makes all these things possible and, at the same
time, establishes their character and limitations. Epistemes are
“the fundamental codes of a culture.”164 According to Foucault,
an episteme

> in a given period delimits in the totality of the experience
> a field of knowledge, defines the mode of being of the
> objects that appear in the field, provides man’s everyday
> perception with theoretical powers, and defines the
> conditions in which he can sustain a discourse about things
that is recognised to be true.165

Thus, an episteme determines truth, meaning, identity, value
and reality at a specific time and place. People need not even be
consciously aware of the episteme or its power in their lives
even though it creates the environment or context in which
individuals think, feel, evaluate, behave and speak; it controls
what can be said and understood as meaningful. Great social,
cultural and intellectual changes are the result of changes in the
underlying episteme. Archaeologies study these epistemes
strictly for themselves but cannot draw any universal
conclusions about ‘humankind’ or other epistemes from such
examinations. This limitation is necessary because there is a
sharp break or caesura between epistemes, i.e. “caeseuralism.”

\[166\] That is why, according to Foucault, archaeologies are more
accurate accounts of studying the past: they are not “not

seduced by the mythology of a prevailing narrative”167 or “grand
narrative” that purports to provide a single overview of
developments across several epistemes. Nor do archaeologies
assume there are bridges of influence between epistemes, which
is why, according to Foucault, “Archaeology does not seek to
rediscover the continuous, insensible transition that relates
discourses [epistemes].”168 This view also makes any notion of
progress impossible because there is no universal standard by
which to measure such ‘progress.’ If epistemes and their
products are not comparable, we can only say that one episteme
is different from another, but not more advanced. Foucault
makes this rejection of progress clear when he writes, “The
history of sciences is not the history of the true, of its slow
epiphany; it cannot hope to recount the gradual discovery of a
truth.”169

Changes in an episteme or changes from one episteme to
another result in a revolution in perception and understanding:
“ ‘things simply cease, all of a sudden, to be ‘perceived,
described, expressed, characterised, classified and known in the
same way as before.’ ”170 It is as if we were transplanted into a
wholly new world which bears no significant comparison to the
old. This why there are no bridges between epistemes.171 To
highlight the revolutionary and world-altering changes between
epistemes, Foucault often makes such startling statements as
“man is only a recent invention”172 and

> [b]efore the end of the eighteenth century, man did not
> exist ... He is a quite recent creature, which the demiurge
> of knowledge fabricated with its own hands less than two
> hundred years ago: but he has grown so quickly that it has
> been only too easy to imagine that he has been waiting for
> thousands of years in the darkness for that moment in
> which he would be known.173
What he means is that the way ‘man’ or humankind is
conceived of in the modern episteme is not the same as the
conception of man in the ancient Greek or Renaissance or
Classical (Enlightenment) episteme. Each of these epistemes
constituted ‘man’ in its own way. In Foucault’s view, ‘man’
appears only at the beginning of the nineteenth century (at the
end of the Classical age) with the full realization of human
finitude in its physical and contingent existence, as well as the
realization that ‘man’ is part of an episteme in which the
primary category is dynamic history and development rather
than static order.174 Modernity discovers “man’ in his
finitude,”175 which is to say,

> Modernity begins when the human being begins to exist
> within his organism, inside the shell of his head, the
> armature of his limbs,, and the whole structure of his
> physiology; when he begins to exist at the centre of a
> labour by whose principles he is governed ...176

What is obvious here is that the transcendent dimension has
been stripped from life in modernity and this throws an
ominous light on man’s discovery of his “finitude.” He finds
himself “dominated by life, history and language”177 instead of
by transcendents like God, spirit, immortality and eternity, as
was the case with Renaissance humanism and Classical
rationalism. Enclosed in worldly existence, and more forcefully
than ever before, man becomes aware of “the threatening
rumble of his non-existence”178 and discovers both within and
outside himself “an element of darkness,”179 as a kind of Other,
the “unthought”180 that is an inescapable twin to his being.

> To know man boiled down to grasping the determinations
> of concrete human existence in the facts of life, labour
> and language, all of which mould man even before his
> birth as an individual.181

Furthermore, this immersion in the empirical and material
had a problem, namely that it was impossible to have empirical
knowledge without recognising that reason is, at least to a
certain degree, transcendent to the empirical facts. If it were
not, how could it serve as a standard to supply and apply
criteria of judgment, distinguish truth from error and the
rational from the irrational? Thus, modern man appears divided
between the empirical and the transcendent i.e. is an “empirico-
transcendent doublet.”182 This is why man in the modern
episteme is subject to deep self-misunderstanding, always torn
between two poles of his being.

In addition to the archaeology of knowledge which concerned
itself with systems of discourse, Foucault also developed a
method called “genealogy” whose purpose was to explain how
changes occurred within an episteme and how one episteme
changed into another. However, while archaeology focussed on
the ruling or dominant episteme, the genealogy also looked to
marginalised knowledge or knowledge about marginalised
subjects that were often in conflict with the ruling episteme.
Genealogies up-set (or as Derrida says, “subvert”) the
established hierarchies and show how this marginalised or
subjugated knowledge interacts with and influences the ruling
episteme. It also pays special attention to the accidents,

coincidences, tricks, mistakes, unforeseen “eruptions” and
arbitrary actions that have effected the history of an idea or
episteme in order to show that development is never simply a
smooth, orderly development:

> The forces operating in history do not obey destiny or
> regulative mechanism, but the luck of the battle.
> [Nietzsche, Genealogy of Morals, II, 12] They do not
> manifest the successive forms of a primordial intention
> and their attention is not always that of a conclusion, for
> they always appear through the singular randomness of
> events ... the world of effective history knows only one
> kingdom, without providence or final cause where there is
> only “the iron hand of necessity shaking the dice-box of
> chance” ... Effective history, on the other hand shortens
> its vision to those things nearest to it – the body, the
> nervous system, nutrition, digestion, and energies; it
> unearths decadence ... [history] should become a
> differential knowledge of energies, failings, heights and
> degenerations, poisons and antidotes.... The final trait of
> effective history is its affirmation of perspectival
> knowledge ...183
This quotation makes four things clear. First, Foucault does
not believe that there is any dominant pattern, intentionality
(divine or otherwise), plan, “final cause,” order or logic to
history. Second, chance and the “randomness of events” are the
‘reasons’ various historical developments take place. This makes
the whole notion of progress problematical.184 Indeed, as already
indicated, Foucault does not believe in progress from one
episteme to another but only in their succession. Third,
Foucault sees history as influenced by seemingly insignificant or
even ‘shameful’ actions and events, by our physiological
attributes which is to say by the ‘marginal’, shunted aside as
unworthy. Fourth, our knowledge of history is perspectival, i.e.
always based on our own position in our own native episteme;
this means that an ‘objective’ view is unattainable.

A fundamental question about Foucault’s epistemes is
whether or not they can admit the actual existence of ‘things’
prior to discourse in an episteme? In terms we have already used
for Derrida, can things be external to or transcendental to the
episteme in which they are constituted?

Is there a ‘God’, or a ‘soul’ that exists prior to and
independently of a word/concept with a place in an episteme or
are all these things human constructions? In Kantian terms,

which readily spring to mind here, are there noumena which our
epistemes (or transcendental egos) constitute as phenomenal
reality? According to Darren Hynes, “For Foucault, any word-
referent has no concreteness, nor is there a reality which
precedes discourse and reveals itself to discursive
perception.”185 Here, too, Foucault agrees with Derrida. Indeed,
how could Foucault concern himself with anything which exists
prior to its place in the discursive structure of an episteme?
How would one be able to speak about it? Furthermore, if such
transcendent entities existed, they would threaten one of the
fundamental principles of archaeological and genealogical
analysis, namely, that no episteme, no viewpoint is privileged
over any other. If there is a transcendent reference – be it God,
or an a-historical essence which is endures through successive
epistemes – then it follows that the signifiers of some epistemes
will correspond more accurately in some way than others to the
original, transcendent signified. Not only would this violate his
goal of providing a non-hierarchical view of different
epistemes, but it would also violate the principle that
comparisons across epistemes are not possible. As well, it means
that there exists, even if only in principle, an ‘Archimedean
standpoint’ – for example God’s viewpoint as revealed through
His Manifestations - outside of the various epistemes from
which we can obtain objective knowledge, i.e. knowledge free
of all epistemes. In a word, the existence of things before their
‘naming’ in an episteme would be a revival of essentialism – a
belief in independently existing (transcendental) entities with
unchanging, historically unconditioned essences – a concept
impossible for Foucault’s archaeologies and genealogies to
accommodate.

> Any attempt to write or speak about the nature [essence]
> of things is made from within a rule-governed linguistic
> framework, an ‘episteme’ that pre-determines what kinds
> of statements are true or meaningful ... There is no
> absolute, unconditioned, transcendental stance from
> which to grasp what is good, right or true. Foucault
> refuses to specify what is true because there are no
> objective grounds for knowledge ... 186

Foucault’s suspicion of the concept of an inherent nature or
essence is also evident when he says history teaches us that
“behind things [there is] not a timeless essential secret but the
secret that they have no essence.”187 This is emphasised by his
statement that he is “suspicious of the notion of liberation”188
because “it runs the risk of falling back on the idea that there

exists a human nature”189 which somehow exists ‘apart’ from us
and which we can rediscover and regain. He rejects the existence
of any such essence or nature. For Foucault, it makes no sense
to talk of anything outside of or ‘underneath’ or transcendent
to an episteme, which is to say that until a thing is constituted
by human beings, it makes no sense to talk of it as ‘existing.’
Indeed, his goal is

> [t]o define these objects without reference to the ground,
> the foundation of things, but by relating them to the body
> of rules that enable them to form objects of discourse and
> thus constitute the conditions of their historical
> appearance.”190
Elsewhere he says that the object “does not pre-exist
itself,”191 which is to say, it does not exist before discourse. This
even applies to the human subject who does not transcend the
episteme in which s/he dwells; s/he is a product of the episteme
as much as anything else.

The radical nature of this rejection of natures or essences
prior to being constituted becomes apparent when applied to
gender, race, health, sanity or even human life.192 All essentialist
definitions of these terms are pure historical constructs valid
for a particular episteme but have no universal validity. In the
field of gender this means that there is no universal definition
of what constitutes a woman or man and all such definitions
should be resisted as unjustly imprisoning us. This rejection of a
‘human nature’ or essence extends to the ‘self.’ According to
Foucault’s philosophy, what we mean by ‘self’ or ‘subject’
varies from one episteme to another, which is to say that the
‘self’ is historically contingent product and no one analysis of
the self can lead to universal conclusions. In other words, all
concepts of self are context-bound and there simply is no
stable, universal ‘core’ or essence constituting the self. Like
everything else, the self is merely “a passing historical
invention”193 and is no more stable than concepts of male and
female, justice, race, rationality or beauty. In the words of
Danaher, Schirato and Webb,

Rather than being the free and active organisers of society,
we are the products of discourses and power relations, and take
on different characteristics according to the range of subject
positions that are possible in our socio-historical context.194

We are products of the “games of truth”195 that constitute
any given episteme also compose the self and from this it

follows that the self cannot pre-exist the episteme or society of
which it is a part. For this reason, the self “is not a substance. It
is a form and this form is not primarily or always identical to
itself.”196 This statement makes two noteworthy points. First,
that the self is not a substance means that there is no persisting
essence to which the concept refers and which it can reflect.
Second, even within itself, the self constantly changes in regards
to itself as it engages in different activities and relationships. As
a “political subject”197 at a meeting or in the voting booth we
relate to ourselves in a different form than we do as a caring
spouse or parent. One might well describe this self as ‘de-
centered’ because there does not seem to be anything – no
essence, no substance, no transcendent soul – to focus the
various relationships and holding them together other than the
contingencies of time and place. At most it is “a form” but
what such a form that is not even “identical to itself” is
supposed to be is not at all clear.

From this it is clear that Foucault’s concept of the self is not
the single, unitary self that we find in the philosophy of
Descartes or in Kant’s transcendental subject of unity of
apperception which is the basis of our personal consciousness,
that which allows us to say ‘I’. One might also say that Foucault
rejects the “idea of the self-governing subject”198 since the self
is constituted and controlled by the varying discourses and
“games of truth” making up the episteme it inhabits. “We are
the products of discourses and power relations, and take on
different characteristics according to the range of subject
positions that are possible in our socio-historical context.”199
Obviously there is no special need for consistency in such a
concept of self. Best and Kellner sum up this aspect of
Foucault’s thought by saying that “Foucault rejects the active
subject and welcomes the emerging postmodern era as a positive
event where the denuding of agency occurs and new forms of
thought can emerge.”200

Another consequence of Foucault’s archaeology and
genealogy is epistemological relativism which follows from his
belief that epistemes are compartmentalized and that we cannot
make evaluations and judgments across differing epistemes.
Their discourse is too different; appearances of similarity
notwithstanding, there are inevitably important breaks and
dislocations of meaning that cannot simply be glossed over. We
have no way of asserting the universal validity of any so-called
truth because there is no universal standard by which to make
any judgments about the truth or untruth of propositions

found in various epistemes. How could such a standard exist
when all such standards are themselves bound to some particular
episteme? All we can do instead of making judgments is to note
differences and changes, and express our own preferences or
even try to enforce them. In this situation, there cannot, as
already noted, be any notion of progress through a succession
of epistemes. Nor can there be any question of a universally
valid hierarchy of ethical actions with some being preferable to
others since there can be no universal standard by which to
make such decisions.

Foucault’s epistemological relativism is reinforced by his
suspicion of the Enlightenment and reason. According to
Foucault, his ethos “implies, first, the refusal of what I like to
call the ‘blackmail’ of the Enlightenment.”201 As Best and
Kellner inform us, “Foucault draws upon an anti-Enlightenment
tradition that rejects the equation of reason, emancipation, and
progress.”202 Reason cannot be taken as a guide to universal
knowledge because reason itself is simply one particular kind of
discourse with a particular – western – episteme; it is an
invention like all the others and no more or less reliable than
any other.

> I do not believe in a kind of founding act whereby reason,
> in its essence, was discovered or established ... I think, in
> fact, that reason is self-created, which is why I have tried
> to analyse forms of rationality: different foundations, dif-
> ferent creations, different modifications in which rational-
> ities engender one another, oppose and pursue one another203
In short, reason is thoroughly historical:

> What reason perceives as its necessity or, rather, what
> different forms of rationality offer as necessary being can
> perfectly well be shown to have a history; and the network
> of contingencies from which it emerges can be traced.204

That is why “no given form of rationality is actually reason.”205
From this view it follows that reason cannot provide universally
valid knowledge. One might argue that it is difficult even to
know what the words ‘reason’ or ‘knowledge’ can mean in
Foucault’s philosophy since both refer only to what the
episteme has constituted or constructed, and thus, could
conceivably mean anything at all. Foucault mitigates this
argument somewhat by stating that their meaning is based on
human practice throughout history – but he does admit “that
since these things have been made, they can be unmade as long

as we know how it was they were made.”206 In other words, in
the last analysis, there are few limits on the future development
of the concept of reason showing that the original critique has
some force.

For Foucault, the analysis of reason is closely tied to the
subjects of truth or knowledge and power. Truth may differ
from one episteme to another, but within each episteme each
truth is part of a system of power:

> [T]ruth isn’t outside power or lacking power ... truth isn’t
> the reward of free spirits, the child of protracted solitude
> ... Truth is a thing of this world: it is produced only by
> virtue of multiple forms of constraint ... Each society has
> its regime of truth, its “general politics” of truth – that is,
> the types of discourse it accepts and makes function as
> true; the mechanisms and instances that enable one to
> distinguish true and false statements; the means by which
> each is sanctioned; the techniques and procedures accorded
> value in the acquisition of truth; the status of those who
are charged with saying what counts as true.207

This quotation, which encapsulates much of Foucault’s
thought on this subject, shows that truth is closely linked to the
power to control the discourse of a particular episteme by
distinguishing true from false, acceptable from unacceptable
evidence, high status from low status and legitimate from
illegitimate methods of gathering truth. This makes it clear that
all concepts of truth are exclusionary and marginalising, and
violent by nature because they can dominate other versions of
truth under a particular “regime of truth.” In other words, truth
is a matter of cultural and epistemological politics not merely a
matter of objective discovery and rational evaluation.
Moreover, because the social status of those who determine
truth is high, truth tends to become the property of a particular
class and can be manipulated to serve its interests.

Another important aspect of truth or knowledge is that they
are linked to the will-to-power, i.e. and the will-to-truth and the
will-to-power are closely correlated which is why Foucault says
that we cannot liberate truth from systems of power: “truth is
already power.”208 As J.G. Merquior writes, for Foucault, “all
will to truth is already a will-to-power.”209 This is because for a
claim to be recognised as ‘true’ means that it has already
triumphed over its rivals and excluded them or marginalised
them as ‘untrue’ or ‘mythology’ or ‘superstition’. Foucault
himself states the matter even more sharply:

> The historical analysis of this rancorous will to knowledge
> [vouleur-savior] reveals that all knowledge [connaissance]
> rests upon injustice (that there is no right, not even in the
> act of knowing truth, to truth or a foundation for truth.),
> and the instinct for knowledge malicious ( something
> murderous, opposed to the happiness of mankind).210
Elsewhere he even claims that knowledge “creates a
progressive enslavement to its instinctive violence.”211
Foucault’s beliefs lead to the conclusion that the claim to know
the truth is also, in effect, a claim to power, i.e. a claim to
domination over others and competing truth claims. Best and
Kellner summarise Foucault’s beliefs by writing,

> Against modern theories that see knowledge as neutral and
> objective (positivism) or emancipatory (Marxism),
> Foucault emphasizes that knowledge is in dissociable from
> from     regimes    of   power.     His     concept     of
> ‘power/knowledge’ is symptomatic of the postmodern
> suspicion of reason and the emancipatory schemes
> advanced in its name.212
Foucault believes that knowledge “has the power to make
itself true”213 insofar as it constrains and regulates our thoughts,
feelings, actions and even laws. What is certainly clear is that
for Foucault the notion of a disinterested, objective, neutral
and pure truth is at best a naïve fiction but more likely a ruse to
trick one’s rivals into quitting the contest for power.

9\. Richard R orty (1931 - 2007)

Although he prefers to call himself a pragmatist,214 the
American philosopher (or ‘anti-philosopher’ as he is sometimes
called) Richard Rorty is generally regarded as having developed
an American version of postmodernist philosophy.215 Reading
his work leaves little doubt that he shares many of
postmodernism’s principles and beliefs: the rejection of
representationalism, of realism, of “grand narratives,” and of
‘truth, rationality, essentialism, objectivity, foundationalism
and metaphysics. He would replace what is usually called
‘philosophy’ with an edifying216 conversation and an exchange
of descriptions of the world among those whose only goal is to
keep the conversation going.217 The purpose of the edifying
conversation is certainly not to find truth or rational
justification of truth since Rorty’s goal is to “radically
undermine the very basis of the dominant rationalist
approach.”218

Rorty’s undermining of the rationalist tradition based on
Socrates and Plato begins with his rejection of the principle that
the human mind and language are mirrors whose task is to
accurately reflect or represent a pre-existent reality. The goal of
rational inquirers is to make their representations as objective
as possible, i.e. to make them correspond to reality. In this way,
we would find or discover the truth about the real world. Rorty
unambiguously rejects this referential thinking as well as its
consequences. For example, he writes,

> My suggestion that the desire for objectivity is in part a
> disguised form of the fear of death echoes Nietzsche’s
> charge that the philosophical tradition which stems from
> Plato is an attempt to avoid facing up to contingency, to
> escape from time and chance.219

He sees no value in objectivity which he dismisses as wanting a
“sky-hook provided by some contemporary yet-to-be-developed
science”220 to free us from the biases of being culture-bound
because he does not think we can ever escape being imprisoned
in our cultures. Therefore,

> [t]hose who wish to reduce objectivity to solidarity – call
> them “pragmatists” – do not require either a metaphysics
> or an epistemology. They view truths as, in William James’
> phrase, what is good for us to believe. So they do not need
> an account of a relation between beliefs and objects called
> ‘correspondence’ nor an account of human cognitive
> abilities which ensures that our species is capable of
> entering into that relation ...For     pragmatists,     the
> desire for objectivity is not the desire to escape the
> limitations of one’s community but simply the desire to
> for as much intersubjective agreement as possible 221

In other words, Rorty has given up the quest for scientific
objectivity which he regards as an impossible effort to
transcend our cultural boundaries and settles for a ‘political’
goal, i.e. solidarity, i.e. he lets epistemology go for the politics
of knowledge. That is why he can say we do not “require either a
metaphysics or an epistemology.” Elsewhere he claims that the
positivists were right in seeking to “extirpate metaphysics when
‘metaphysics’ means the attempt to give knowledge of what
science cannot know,”222 i.e. knowledge that transcends
particular scientific facts – although these latter are also thrown
into question by Rorty’s views about the incommensurability of
different vocabularies or “truth games” and the need for
solidarity. The latter is also why he gives up on the

correspondence theory of knowledge which leads to arguments
because it maintains that some knowledge is natural “and not
merely local”223 and that some methods of justification are
natural and not merely social or cultural. Thus, it is impossible
for him to say that some knowledge is truer or reflects reality
better than other. “We must get the visual and in particular the
mirroring metaphors out of our speech altogether.”224 Making
this rejection of correspondence even more clear, he insists that
we admit that sentences are only “connected with other
sentences rather than with the world.”225 That being the case, it
follows that his pragmatism “views knowledge not as a relation
between mind and object but, roughly, as the ability to get
agreement by using persuasion rather than force.”226 If we
cannot appeal to the facts of reality for support, and if, as we
shall see, reason is only another “platitude,” then, unless we
wish to use force, we have only persuasion left.

Rorty describes himself as an “ironist”227 which is to say, he
doubts that his own particular language or vocabulary can
adequately attain truth and objectivity; he recognises that his
current philosophical language cannot resolve these doubts. He
does not think his language is closer to the truth or reality than
anyone else’s. For this reason, ironists repudiate the whole
concept of representationalism, i.e. the concept that our verbal
or mathematical descriptions of reality really represent what is
‘out there.’ Furthermore, because they realise that their
descriptions of reality are limited in descriptive capacity,
contingent and subject to constant change and or more in touch
with reality than others, ironists are “never quite able to take
themselves seriously.”228 Ironists are also people who “do not
hope to have their doubts about their final vocabularies settled
by something larger than themselves.”229 They do not look to
God or revelation nor to a supposedly universal reason or logic
nor a grand narrative to resolve their doubts. Instead, they
possess a great deal of what the poet John Keats called
“negative capability, that is, when a man is capable of being in
uncertainties, mysteries, doubts, without any irritable reaching
after fact and reason.”230 As well, ironists are nominalists, they
think “nothing has an intrinsic nature, a real essence,”231 that is
what it is independently of human observation and
attribution.232 All alleged attributes are human constructions,
the products of our cultural and historical positioning and the
discourse we employ and for that reason there are no universal
characteristics of anything including human nature.233 There is
simply no way to transcend our language and culture and
compare it with ‘reality’ from some ‘Archimedean point’ to

obtain a ‘God’s eye view’ on the world. We should simply
recognise that we cannot “come up with a single set of criteria
which everybody in all times and places can accept, invent a
single language game which can somehow take over all jobs
previously done by all the language-games ever played.”234
Rather, our particular culture and language construct what we
appear to perceive and we are locked into these constructions, a
view which was already pre-figured by Kant. Hence any
attempts to use so-called essential attributes as the basis of
universal statements are doomed; knowing this, ironists do

> not take the point of discursive thought to be knowing, in
> any sense that can be explicated by notions like “reality,”
> “real essence,” “objective point of view,” and the
> “correspondence of language of [sic] reality.” They do not
> think its point is to find a vocabulary which accurately
> represents something, a transparent meaning.235

At this point it comes as no surprise that Rorty describes
reason as a faculty that “can now be dispensed with – and should
be dispensed with”236 because for ironists criteria of reason, like
other criteria used for judging among descriptions of the world
“are never more than platitudes which contextually define the
terms of the final vocabulary in use.”237 These criteria are valid,
if at all, only within the language or language game in which
they are being used. Indeed, philosophy is so language and
culture dependent that according to Rorty there is no legitimate
use of the distinction “between logic and rhetoric, or between
philosophy and literature, or between rational and nonrational
methods of changing other people’s minds.”238 In this vein,
Rorty writes, On a pragmatist view, rationality is not the
exercise of a faculty called ‘reason’ – a faculty which stands in
some determinate relationship to reality, Nor is the use of a
method. It is simply a matter of being open and curious and
relying on persuasion rather than force.239

In short, ‘rational’ only means ‘persuasive.’ It is time to
realize that the Enlightenment has been “discredited.”240 There
are no necessary ‘logical’ or reasonable connections between
sentences or propositions that can require us to admit anything
we prefer not to.

On Rorty’s view, philosophy cannot be a quest for ‘truth’ or
‘true understanding’ since the most we can do is redescribe
things to our individual and/or collective liking and discuss our
various descriptions. In other words, the purpose of philosophy
is to be edifying: “I shall is ‘edification’ to stand for this project

of finding new, better, more interesting more fruitful ways of
speaking.”241 Edifying philosophy “takes its point of departure
from suspicion about the pretensions of epistemology,”242
which is to say that edifying philosophy is not longer interested
in attaining truth.243 Thus, rather than take part in an inquiry
for the ‘knowledge,’ “we just might be saying something”244
simply in order to “keep the conversation going rather than to
find objective truth.”245 This, for Rorty is “a sufficient aim of
philosophy.”246 At most we can strive for solidarity for in the
post-Auschwitz age: “What can there be except human
solidarity, our recognition of one another’s common
humanity.”?247 (It is, of course highly ironic that Rorty appeals
to our “common humanity” after having repudiated ‘essences’
and the possibility of cross-cultural universal statements.)
Given Rorty’s views, it is difficult to avoid the conclusion that
philosophy is just pleasant talk, in itself of no great
consequence and remember that we can always change the
subject with no great harm done.248

Rorty emphatically rejects the notion of a “core self,”249 i.e.

the rejection of the claim that there is a human essence either
for the individual or for the species. In his view, “there is no
self distinct from this self-reweaving web”250 of muscles,
movements, beliefs and states of mind. In reflecting on these
weaving and reweaving patterns, we must

> avoid taking common speech as committing one to the
> view that there is, after all, such a thing as a “True Self,”
> the inner core of one’s being which remains what it is
> independent of changes in one’s beliefs and desires. There
is no more a center to the self than there is to the brain.251

We must not let our ordinary usage of pronouns such as ‘I’
or ‘me’ fool us into thinking there is any substantive entity that
actually corresponds to these words. All thoughts about a ‘True
Self’ or soul are delusional. We should “avoid the self-deception
of thinking that we possess a deep, hidden, metaphysically
significant nature which makes us ‘irreducibly’ different from
inkwells or atoms.”252

10\. Baudrillar d (1929 – 2007)

Jean Baudrillard, who has attained “guru status throughout
the English-speaking world “as a high priest of the new
epoch,”253 is in some respects the most controversial of the five
contemporary postmodernists we shall examine. Baudrillard
embodied his postmodern philosophy in socio-cultural,

economic and political analyses that were distinguished not only
by his challenging insights but also by his flair for startling
turns of phrase and outrageous assertions. For example, in The
Gulf War Did Not Take Place he claims that the 2001 Gulf War
was more a matter of events on TV and radar screens than a real
war in the traditional sense, that it was more a virtual war than
anything else. Elsewhere he writes, “Disneyland is there to
conceal the fact that it is the ‘real’ country, all of ‘real’
America, which is Disneyland.”254 When we look into or beneath
Baudrillard’s multifarious analyses, we find that he shares many
if not all of the same themes and views as the postmodernists we
have examined previously.

The keys to Baudrillard’s thought are the twin concepts of
simulations and simulacra. In Simulations, Baudrillard briefly
retells a Borges story of a map that is so detailed in every
respect that it covers the entire territory it is supposed to
represent and is indistinguishable from it. The map and the
territory have become one, the distinction between ‘real’ and
‘unreal’ has been blurred as has the distinction between original
and copy, natural and artificial and signifier and signified.
What, if anything, we may ask, does the map represent? And
which is the map and which is the territory when “[s]imulation is
no longer that of a territory, a referential being or a
substance.”?255 Obviously, the whole notion of representation is
no longer tenable. We must also recognise that “simulation
threatens the difference between ‘true’ and ‘false’, between
‘real’ and ‘imaginary’.”256 How could one distinguish between
them?     Other     threatened     binaries    are     cause/effect,
active/passive, subject/object and ends/means.257 The essential
natures of these categories no longer exist because they have all
been melded into one another. They have, to use Derrida’s term,
been deconstructed, i.e. it has been shown that the old notion
of distinct and stable essences making up the binary oppositions
of signifier/signified, map/territory, real/imaginary, true/false,
original/copy,     appearance/reality,     the     ideal/real   and
essential/nonessential are no longer functional with each part of
the pair blending into the other. Furthermore, if all these
essential differences no longer exist, it is impossible to be
rational since rationality depends on clear and distinct
oppositional binaries or categories of thought that allow us to
attain clear and decisive answers.

Metaphysics is also impossible according to Baudrillard. In
the first place, “truth, reference and objective causes have
ceased to exist.”258 If these three are not clearly identifiable,

metaphysics, which requires clearly identified causal
relationships in its study of the structure and nature of reality,
become impossible. Secondly, if our propositions are no longer
referential and do not refer to reality, we cannot discuss reality
at all let alone decide which propositions are true; as Baudrillard
puts it: “All the referentials intermingle their discourses in a
circular Moebian compulsion259 and thus deprive reason of the
“clear and distinct ideas”260 it needs. Consequently, we can no
longer distinguish real from unreal, or appearance from reality
and with this situation

> goes all of metaphysics. No more mirror of being and
> appearances, of the real and its concept ... It [the real] no
> longer has to be rational, since it is no longer measured
> against some ideal or negative instance. It is nothing more
> than operational. In fact, since it is no longer enveloped
> by an imaginary [ideal], it is no longer real at all. It is
> hyperreal, the product of an irradiating synthesis of
combinatory in a hyperspace without atmosphere.261

Finally, without reason or logic metaphysics is also
impossible because reason provides the rules by means of which
our propositions about reality lead to conclusions. Eventually,
Baudrillard replaced metaphysics with the satirical ‘pataphysics,’
a term borrowed from the surrealist movement, to illustrate
what happens to thought when distinctions among categories
disappear. This is why “for pataphysics all phenomena are
absolutely gaseous.”262

According to Baudrillard, the “blurring of distinctions
between the real and the unreal”263 is the “hyperreal,” which is “a
condition whereby the models replace the real, as exemplified in
such phenomena as the ideal home in women’s or lifestyle
magazines, ideal sex ... ideal fashion.”264 In each of these, the
model, the simulation determines what is regarded as real and
thus, ultimately, the simulations constitute reality. For that
reason, the power relationship between the real and unreal
simulation has been reversed, with the unreal now so much in
control that we can say that real understood in the traditional,
i.e. pre-postmodern sense no longer exists: “there is no real.”265
Because we live in such a hyperreality where the simulation
constitutes reality, Baudrillard is able to say that Disneyland is
the real America and that the 2001 Gulf War never happened
except as a television event. To our usual way of thinking this
makes no sense because the original ‘real thing’ always has
ontological priority over the any simulation but as Baudrillard
tells us, “The contradictory process of true and false, of real

and the imaginary is abolished in this hyperreal logic of
montage.”266 By the “logic of montage” he means the ‘logic’ of
concepts or realities which overlap and impinge on and melt
into one another, losing thereby their distinct boundaries and
with that loss, their usual rules of combination or exclusion.
Oppositional binaries such as original/copy, prior/secondary
and this/that no longer hold. “The hyperreal represents a much
more advanced phase [than modernist realism] in the sense that
even this contradiction between the real world and the
imaginary is effaced.”267 Baudrillard calls this development “the
collapse of reality into hyperrealism.”268 This development
changes our relationship to reality because “it is reality itself
that disappears utterly in the game of reality.”269 Reality
disappears in its simulations because similitude is ultimately
equivalent to the murder of the original, a nullification of
original’s unique ontological status as prior in the order of time
and logic.270

The dominance of the hyperreal has the effect of collapsing
the difference between art and reality and thus mingling the two
so that reality itself becomes a work of art:

> And so art is everywhere, since artifice is at the very heart
> of reality. And so art is dead, not only because its critical
> transcendence [difference from reality] is gone but
> because reality itself, entirely impregnated by an aesthetic
> which is inseparable from its own structure, has been
> confused with its own image.271
From this it follows that the binary opposition of work/play
has also been dissolved. Indeed, because of the collapse of all
binary differences, the postmodern condition “is for Baudrillard
a play with all forms of sexuality, art, and politics, combining
and recombining forms and possibilities, moving into the ‘the
time of transvestism.’ ”272 This “combining and recombining” of
concepts, categories, styles and content liberates things from
their former limits and hyperbolizes existence, for which reason
he also refers to the “post-orgy state of things.”273

 Postm odernism and th e B ahá'í Writing s

Part Two

Ian Kluge

In this portion of the paper, we shall compare the ideas
presented by the forerunners of postmodernism and their most
important successors and the Bahá'í Writings in order to
demonstrate that surface similarities notwithstanding, the
foundational ideas of postmodernism and the Writings are
incompatible.

11\. The Counter -Enl ightenmen t a nd the Bahá'í
Writings

In regards to reason, the Writings adopt a position that is
neither in agreement with the Enlightenment’s unquestioning
faith in reason nor with the scepticism and even rejection of
reason by the Counter-Enlightenment and its post-modern
protégés. To be precise, the Writings exemplify a position that
may be described as “moderate rationalism”, according to which
reason can give us some but not all knowledge; there are kinds
of knowledge – such as the knowledge available to the heart1 -
which are not obtainable by reason alone but are, so-to-speak,
‘trans-rational.’ (We say ‘trans-rational’ rather than ‘irrational’
because this knowledge is not opposed to reason per se but goes
beyond it making use, for example, of revelation.) Therefore,
we must remember that “the human spirit, unless assisted by the
spirit of faith, does not become acquainted with the divine
secrets and the heavenly realities.”2 In other words, there are
truths which cannot be discovered by unassisted or natural
reason and which must be attained by other means, i.e.
revelation and the development of “spiritual susceptibilities.”3
`Abdu'l-Bahá states,

> If he [man] attains rebirth while in the world of nature, he
> will become informed of the divine world. He will observe
> that another and a higher world exists.4
116                            Postmodernism and the Bahá’í Writings

Reason expands or transcends its limits if those employing it
become spiritualized. In a further note regarding the limits of
reason and knowledge, `Abdu'l-Bahá says,

> Know that there are two kinds of knowledge: the
> knowledge of the essence of a thing and the knowledge of
> its qualities. The essence of a thing is known through its
qualities; otherwise, it is unknown and hidden.5

Here `Abdu'l-Bahá makes it clear that rational knowledge is
limited to qualities and that essences must be known by way of
qualities; they cannot be known by direct insight or intuition
but must be known indirectly through the mediation of qualities
or attributes. This statement guides, i.e. limits our use of reason
and our inquiry by saying not only that whatever we know
about things and their essences, must come by way of qualities
but also that whatever we know is limited to what qualities can
tell us. The essences of things may have many other aspects
which are not observable by us in our current state of being,
and, therefore, must remain ‘mysterious.’ This has enormous
ontological consequences not the least of which is that it safe-
guards the ontological integrity of all created things and
provides a rational foundation for a belief in ‘mysteries.’ (God,
for example is a ‘mystery’ insofar as He is beyond the
comprehension of human reason.6) . In short, reason can tell us
a great deal but not everything we need to know and live well.

In addition to limitations of scope and applicability, reason
has the limit of fallibility. `Abdu'l-Bahá tells us that “the circle
of this [rational] knowledge is very limited because it depends
upon effort and attainment.”7 Anything depending on human
action is subject to errors of all kinds; thus, by itself, it has
limited reliability and therefore, does not always lead us to the
truth.8 According to `Abdu'l-Bahá, the conflicting opinions
among the philosophers clearly demonstrate that “the method of
reason is not perfect.”9

However, unlike the Counter-Enlightenment and its
postmodern successors, the Bahá'í Writings do not reject reason
altogether, but, quite to the contrary, encourage us to use it
while keeping its limitations in mind. The Writings not only
inform us of the limitations of reason but also, at the same
time, endorse reason and its role in our lives. Such an
endorsement of reason is clear when `Abdu'l-Bahá, says “in this
age the peoples of the world need the arguments of reason.”10
and

Lights of ‘Irfán Book Nine                                    117

> [God] has bestowed upon [man] the power of intellect so
> that through the attribute of reason, when fortified by the
> Holy Spirit, he may penetrate and discover ideal realities
> and become informed of the mysteries of the world of
> significances. As this power to penetrate the ideal
> knowledge is superhuman, supernatural, man becomes the
> collective center of spiritual as well as material forces so
> that the divine spirit may manifest itself in his being ...11

Through reason “fortified by the Holy Spirit,” we may obtain
knowledge of the “ideal realities” i.e. the supernatural or
spiritual realities of creation insofar as such knowledge is
compatible with our human nature. Hence this knowledge is
“superhuman.” This assurance that reason is able to attain
genuine knowledge is important because that is precisely
something denied by the Counter-Enlightenment and its
postmodern successors. Both reject the ‘privileged’ status that
reason has over ‘other ways of knowing’ and in particular its
‘privileged’ connection to truth. The link between rationality
and truth has been severed.

The enormous positive importance of reason in the Writings
is also seen in that the essential feature that distinguishes
humankind from animals, the differentia, is the “rational
soul.”12

> The human spirit which distinguishes man from the animal
> is the rational soul, and these two names--the human spirit
> and the rational soul--designate one thing. This spirit,
> which in the terminology of the philosophers is the
> rational soul, embraces all beings, and as far as human
> ability permits discovers the realities of things and
> becomes cognizant of their peculiarities and effects, and
> of the qualities and properties of beings. But the human
> spirit, unless assisted by the spirit of faith, does not
> become acquainted with the divine secrets and the
> heavenly realities.13

Here we observe not only identification of our essential
identifying feature with the rational soul but also, again,
emphasis on the rational soul’s ability to attain genuine
knowledge in the world, and, with the assistance of the “spirit
of faith” or “Holy Spirit”, knowledge of “heavenly realities.”
Once more, `Abdu'l-Bahá draws our attention to the intimate
connection between rationality and obtaining knowledge or
discovering truth. Elsewhere `Abdu'l-Bahá says that the rational
soul or “the human spirit consists of the rational, or logical,

118                            Postmodernism and the Bahá’í Writings

reasoning faculty, which apprehends general ideas and things
intelligible and perceptible.”14 Through the power of reason we
can discover the “realities of things.”15

Furthermore, there is continuous emphasis in the Writings on
the use of reason to reconcile science and religion and to
ground faith: “if a question be found contrary to reason, faith
and belief in it are impossible, and there is no outcome but
wavering and vacillation.”16

> For God has endowed us with faculties by which we may
> comprehend the realities of things, contemplate reality
> itself. If religion is opposed to reason and science, faith is
> impossible; and when faith and confidence in the divine
> religion are not manifest in the heart, there can be no
spiritual attainment.17

There are two matters of interest in these quotes. First, is the
assurance that through the use of reason and other faculties, we
are capable of discovering truths about the “realities of things,”
i.e. the way things really are. Second, it is clear that reason and
“spiritual attainment” are intimately connected i.e. reason is
necessary to genuine spiritual life and faith. In addition, we are
told that “religion must be in conformity with science and
reason, so that it may influence the hearts of men.”18 Here, too,
we observe that reason is not only necessary for genuine
spirituality through its influence on the heart, and through it,
faith.

> Religion must be reasonable. If it does not square with
> reason, it is superstition and without foundation. It is like
> a mirage, which deceives man by leading him to think it is
> a body of water. God has endowed man with reason that
> he may perceive what is true. If we insist that such and
> such a subject is not to be reasoned out and tested
> according to the established logical modes of the intellect,
what is the use of the reason which God has given man?19

In a similar vein, `Abdu'l-Bahá informs us that “true science
is reason and reality, and religion is essentially reality and pure
reason; therefore, the two must correspond.”20 Yet again we
observe that reason, religion, science and reality are all
intimately, i.e. indissolubly connected and are not necessarily in
conflict.

Finally, it should be noted that notwithstanding the
possibility of error, reason can also provide us with knowledge
of the truth, something that is denied by all postmodernists

Lights of ‘Irfán Book Nine                                   119

from Nietzsche on; indeed, as we have seen, Nietzsche and his
postmodern successors deny that there is such a thing as ‘truth’
to be found. Rather truth is something we make or construct.
`Abdu'l-Bahá states,

> God has created man in order that he may perceive the
> verity of existence and endowed him with mind or reason
> to discover truth. Therefore, scientific knowledge and
> religious belief must be conformable to the analysis of this
> divine faculty in man.21

Elsewhere he says, “God has created man and endowed him
with the power of reason whereby he may arrive at valid
conclusions.”22 In other words, in spite of the possibility of
error, reason is one way of attaining truth.

From the foregoing discussion, we may conclude that unlike
the Counter-Enlightenment, Nietzsche and his postmodern
protégés for whom there are no truths but only interpretation,23
the Writings maintain that reason does, indeed, provide us with
genuine knowledge of the truth despite the fact that we may use
it incorrectly. It must be used carefully, preferably under the
guidance of the Holy Spirit as we have seen in a number of
previous quotations.24 In other words, one of the conditions for
ensuring that reason works correctly is divine assistance.
Another such condition is given in the following quote:

> Consequently, it has become evident that the four criteria
> or standards of judgment by which the human mind
> reaches its conclusions are faulty and inaccurate. All of
> them are liable to mistake and error in conclusions. But a
> statement presented to the mind accompanied by proofs
> which the senses can perceive to be correct, which the
> faculty of reason can accept, which is in accord with
> traditional authority and sanctioned by the promptings of
> the heart, can be adjudged and relied upon as perfectly
> correct, for it has been proved and tested by all the
> standards of judgment and found to be complete When we
> apply but one test, there are possibilities of mistake. This
> is self-evident and manifest.”25

When we view these quotations together, in addition to the
warnings about the fallibility of human reason, we find it
difficult to avoid the conclusion that the Writings exemplify
not only ‘moderate rationalism’ but also a position known as
“reliabilism.” According to the Oxford Companion to
Philosophy, reliabilism is “the position that “a belief can be

120                            Postmodernism and the Bahá’í Writings

justified if formed as the result of a reliable process even if the
believer is unaware of what makes it justified.”26 In other
words, reliabilism demands that belief be “the result of some
reliable process of belief-formation.”27 The Writings tells us
that a “reliable process of belief formation” involves, ideally,
the Holy Spirit, but at the very least, the congruence of several
tests among which `Abdu'l-Bahá lists empirical sense knowledge,
reason, tradition and the “promptings of the heart” which we
interpret as the promptings of the Holy Spirit. Of course, the
Writings do not go into all the technical details of reliabilism,
but they do, quite clearly adumbrate this position which is for
us to work out within the guidelines provided.

The inescapable conclusion to which we are led is that while
the Writings do not accept the Enlightenment’s unquestioning
trust in reason, neither do they accept the categorical rejection
of reason exemplified by the Counter-Enlightenment and its
postmodern successors. Indeed, in their emphasis on the
importance of reason in science and religion, as well as in the
identification of humankind’s essence as a “rational soul,” the
Writings demonstrate strong leanings in favour of the
Enlightenment. Philosophically, they may be seen as a
continuation of the Enlightenment albeit it in an amended and
corrected form.

12\. The Bahá'í Writin gs an d Kan t

In regards to Kant, the Bahá'í Writings, cannot accept his
rejection of metaphysics tout court since they do not accept the
idea that under any and all circumstances, reason is necessarily
confined to the phenomenal realm. According to Kant, we
cannot correctly reason from the phenomenal to the noumenal
or transcendent because the laws and conditions of reasoning do
not apply to the noumenal world. These laws and conditions –
for example time, space, causality, quantity, relation, quality
and modality – are imposed by the human mind on the ‘raw’
data from the noumenal realm and, thereby, make thinking and
reasoning possible.28 However, the categories are not inherently
part of the transcendent noumenal realm, from which it follows
that reason does not apply to this realm of which we have no
experience as it is in itself, i.e. unshaped by us. Because God is
transcendent to the phenomenal realm, we cannot devise proofs
of His existence by way of the phenomenal world.

As we shall see below, the Bahá'í Writings do not agree that
the existence of God cannot be proven from the phenomenal

Lights of ‘Irfán Book Nine                                     121

realm. This is made evident, for example, by `Abdu'l-Bahá’s
proof of God as the First Cause.

> Such process of causation goes on, and to maintain that
> this process goes on indefinitely is manifestly absurd. Thus
> such a chain of causation must of necessity lead eventually
> to Him who is the Ever-Living, the All-Powerful, who is
> Self-Dependent and the Ultimate Cause. This Universal
> Reality cannot be sensed, it cannot be seen. It must be so
> of necessity, for it is All-Embracing, not circumscribed,
> and such attributes qualify the effect and not the cause.29

In `Abdu'l-Bahá’s view, a First Cause is necessary because no
actually real chain of causation can go on infinitely. He does
not say why, nor is it important for us at this point, to know
why he reached this conclusion. What is germane to our
discussion is that he clearly accepts the possibility of reasoning
our way to an “Ultimate Cause” and “Universal Reality [that]
cannot be sensed” i.e. is beyond the phenomenal realm.
Moreover, he does so on the basis of causality, which he regards
as a real feature of the universe and not merely an imposition by
the human mind on raw noumenal data. Since causality is
ontologically real, and infinite causal chains are “manifestly
absurd,” we must eventually find a First Cause to set the chain
of causes into motion.

For the reasons given above, Kant would not accept as
legitimate `Abdu'l-Bahá’s statement that “all beings and all
existences are the centers from which the glory of God is
reflected – that is to say, the signs of the Divinity of God are
apparent in the realities of things and of creatures.”30 If this
statement were accepted, then we would be able to use the signs
of God to reason our way from the phenomenal to the
noumenal and transcendent Source. Similarly, Kant is bound to
reject the claim that “the smallest created thing proves that
there is a creator. For instance, this piece of bread proves that it
has a maker.”31 Here, in this compressed version of Intelligent
Design, we observe reasoning from the created to the Creator
which is precisely what Kant forbids.

It might be argued that the Writings could agree with Kant as
far as the limits of natural reason, i.e. reason unassisted by the
Holy Spirit are concerned. Without such assistance, individuals
will not develop their “spiritual susceptibilities,”32 and their
thinking, therefore, remains confined to the phenomenal realm.
However, the Writings do not take such a position. For
example, the argument to the First Cause cited above needs

122                           Postmodernism and the Bahá’í Writings

nothing other than natural reason to make its point; indeed, the
same argument was already used by Aristotle and other
philosophers. No divine inspiration is needed to see why an
initial Cause is necessary. Furthermore, `Abdu'l-Bahá’s other
argument from the contingency and dependency of creation and
humankind to the transcendent non-contingent Source is also
available to natural reason without divine assistance, as is his
argument from the imperfections of all created things to the
existence of a perfect Being.33 In light of these arguments it is
more accurate to say that according to the Writings, natural
reason is sufficient for some kinds and levels of knowledge but
not for others which require the assistance of the Holy Spirit.

Nor do the Writings endorse Kant’s belief that the
phenomenal world in which we live is entirely a human
construction, i.e. the way the categories of the mind organise
data from the noumenal realm according to time, space and
causality for example. Nature – which is what we must interpret
and work with – is made by God Who provides its various
inherent qualities, essences, potentialities and laws. This nature
pre-exists us and therefore does not depend on us for its
existence and/or attributes. It is given to us, with all things
having their natural attributes and behaving according to pre-
existing natural laws decreed by God from which no being
except man may deviate.34 In other words, unlike the philosophy
of Kant, the Bahá'í Writings do not teach that humankind has
any part in the process of constituting natural reality, i.e. the
phenomenal realm in which we live. One could argue that
making such a claim is, in effect, setting oneself up as a kind of
second god and co-creator, or ‘partner’.

> And now concerning thy reference to the existence of two
> Gods. Beware, beware, lest thou be led to join partners
> with the Lord, thy God. He is, and hath from everlasting
> been, one and alone, without peer or equal ... He hath
> assigned no associate unto Himself in His Kingdom, no
> counsellor to counsel Him ... To this every atom of the
> universe beareth witness, and beyond it the inmates of the
realms on high ... 35

These words suggest that humankind has no part in this
process of constituting natural reality, i.e. no part in
constituting the phenomenal realm in which we live. We may, of
course, interpret the divinely constituted reality in various
ways, and, of course, we may invent and construct all sorts of
things – machines, laws, social codes, art and so on – using first
nature, but these interpretations and constructions are not

Lights of ‘Irfán Book Nine                                     123

prior to and should not be confused with the divinely created
reality itself. In other words, reality as created and constituted
by God, i.e. ‘first nature,’ should not be confused with what
humankind makes from ‘first nature’ i.e. an artificial ‘second
nature’, a society and civilization which we create and
constitute according to our wills guided by revelation. To some
extent, our wills can constitute the second nature but only to
the limits allowed by the attributes inherent in the things that
God has created. Fire is inherently hot36 and will not serve as ice.

Thus, the Bahá'í Writings clearly recognise a distinction
between first and second nature, something which is highly
problematical with Kant. We might consider the noumenal to
be the first nature and the phenomenal the second nature, but
this is dubious at best since the phenomenal, for Kant, includes
everything that is shaped by such categories as causality,
quantity, existence and relation, i.e. the entire natural world.
According to the Writings, however, this phenomenal realm is
precisely the nature that is created by God and which
humankind interprets and uses to build second nature, i.e.
societies, laws, conventions, art and science within the limits
defined by the divinely established first nature. The natural
tendency of Kant’s philosophy is to deny the distinction
between the two natures and, thereby, set the stage for the
postmodernist rejection of this distinction.

13\. The Bahá'í Writin gs an d Nietzsche

Although one may find individual ideas wherein Nietzsche
and the Bahá'í Writings agree, a survey of his work makes it
abundantly clear that the disagreements are fundamental and
wide-spread. Let us begin with their sharply divergent
assessments of Socrates and the use of reason in scientific
discovery. The Writings praise Socrates as one of the
philosophers who recognised the reality of the spiritual

> The philosophers of Greece--such as Aristotle, Socrates,
> Plato and others--were devoted to the investigation of
> both natural and spiritual phenomena. In their schools of
> teaching they discoursed upon the world of nature as well
> as the supernatural world ... Because they were interested
> in both natural and divine philosophy, furthering the
> development of the physical world of mankind as well as
> the intellectual, they rendered praiseworthy service to
> humanity. This was the reason of the triumph and survival
> of their teachings and principles.37

Nietzsche, as we have already seen, disparaged Socrates as the
“theoretical man”38 and “mystagogue of science”39 who foolishly
believed that reason could explain and tell us the truth about
reality.40Instead, Nietzsche wants to escape beyond “the eternal
reason-spider and reason cobweb”41 so that we may be free to
live with our fullest passionate capacity of our will-to-power.

Unlike Nietzsche, the Writings hold that recognising the
supernatural, the transcendent or divine is an important
contribution to our existence. Furthermore, as we have seen in
the previous section on the Enlightenment, the Writings also
disagree with Nietzsche’s decisively negative assessment of
reason. After all, of course, they identify humankind’s
distinguishing characteristic, its differentia, as the “rational
soul.”42 They do not, of course, uncritically accept reason as the
final authority on all issues, but, in their moderate rationalism
and reliabilism they accept reason as a legitimate source of real
knowledge. In other words, the Writings accept reason as a
means of discovering truth about reality, and could not accept
Nietzsche’s belief that “ ‘Truth’ is therefore not something
there, that might be found or discovered – but something that
must be created.”43 Nor can they accept his sweeping statement
that truth is no more than

> [a] mobile army of metaphors, metonyms, and
> anthropomorphisms—in short, a sum of human relations
> which have been enhanced, transposed, and embellished
> poetically and rhetorically, and which after long use seem
> firm, canonical, and obligatory to a people: truths are
> illusions about which one has forgotten that this is what
they are.44

The Bahá'í Writings recognise that what Nietzsche describes
may sometimes be the case – as in the gradual degeneration of
religious teachings to the point when a new Manifestation is
needed – but they do not hold that this is what truth-claims
always and necessarily are. Some truth-claims such as ‘God
exists’ are simply correct and others are plainly wrong: the earth
is not a flat disk but a sphere. Distinguishing between real truth
and man-made fictions is the very basis of progress i.e. addition
and improvement of knowledge, both in the sciences and in
progressive revelation. Both of these involve the overcoming of
error and superstition which the Writings also recognise as real
– but which are problematic for Nietzsche. If truth is invented
fiction, then how can we tell a ‘true fiction’ from a ‘false one’?
How can we ever progress from ‘false’ to ‘true’? Indeed, in a
statement that exemplifies an extreme sceptical attitude

towards truth, Nietzsche writes, “Truth is the kind of error
without which a certain species of life could not live. The value
of life is ultimately decisive.”45 What is essential about truth is
not that it is true but that it serves life or our life purposes:
“[t]he criterion of truth resides in the enhancement of the
feeling of power.”46 In other words, truth is not which is
actually the case but that which meets our needs in the struggles
of life – a view of truth that is highly subjective and which
allows there to be as many truths as there are individuals with
needs.

The Writings, for their part, maintain that truths are
discovered, not invented and show no sign of accepting
Nietzsche’s extremely subjective characterization of truth.

> God has created man in order that he may perceive the
> verity of existence and endowed him with mind or reason
> to discover truth. Therefore, scientific knowledge and
> religious belief must be conformable to the analysis of this
> divine faculty in man.47
Elsewhere `Abdu'l-Bahá states,

> Man is able to resist and to oppose Nature because he
> discovers the constitution of things, and through this he
> commands the forces of Nature; all the inventions he has
> made are due to his discovery of the constitution of
> things.48
He also states,

> The mind and the thought of man sometimes discover
> truths, and from this thought and discovery signs and
> results are produced. This thought has a foundation. But
> many things come to the mind of man which are like the
> waves of the sea of imaginations; they have no fruit, and
no result comes from them.49

Thus, we may conclude that although they the Writings
recognise the inherent limitations of unaided reason, they do
not share Nietzsche’s extreme scepticism about discovering
knowledge. Therefore, they place a high value on science as a
means of discovering truth and not as a provider of comforting
illusions50 as does Nietzsche. Finally, there is no evidence that
the Bahá'í Writings would accept Nietzsche’s reduction of
‘truth’ to the will-to-power without any genuine
epistemological content or truth value; “It [truth] is a word for
the ‘will-to-power.’” 51. This, and his claim that truth is created,

i.e. an aesthetic theory of truth, is incompatible with Bahá'í
epistemology which holds to a correspondence theory of truth
in which truth is discovered.52 The correspondence theory of
truth, i.e. the theory that we attain truth when our conceptions
correspond with reality is illustrated in the following:

> for the connection which exists between the reality of
> things, whether they be spiritual or material, requires that
> when the mirror is clear and faces the sun, the light of the
sun must become apparent in it.53

“The mirror of the reality of man”54 reflects realities
“whether they be spiritual or material” and, through this process
of reflection, learns about them and if its concepts adequately
represent the various realities. If they do, then they correspond
to one degree or another to reality; and if they do not, we shall
(hopefully) discover we are in error. This theory is also an
example of ‘representationalism’ insofar as our concepts
represent reality in our minds. For Nietzsche (as for all
postmodernist philosophers), this is problematical because this
not only undermines the theory that truth is created or
constructed but also implies that language is capable of putting
us into touch with reality. This would limit human creativity
and freedom in the construction of reality.

In regards to the “will-to-power”, it should also be noted that
it should not be understood as simply the actualization of our
inherent potentials. Even the most cursory survey of
Nietzsche’s statements on the will-to-power make it clear that
he thinks of it in terms of overcoming and dominating others,
or being unrestrained by normal moral codes. That is why he
mocks Christian and other religious moralities as “slave
morality”55 because they have given up this goal. is emphasized
by his use of the word “Macht” instead of “Kraft” or energy for
power. “Macht” in German implies domination, overcoming and
power over others and we must never lose sight of the fact that
Nietzsche wrote of a “Wille-zur-Macht” not a “Wille-zur-
Kraft.” This is important because the term “will-to-power” is
central in Nietzsche’s philosophy and sets a tone that is
fundamentally out of harmony with the Writings which
emphasize love.

Nietzsche’s doctrine of the “eternal return.”56 is also
profoundly out of harmony with the Writings for two main
reasons. First, it denies the existence of a transcendent
dimension to reality, pre-figuring thereby, postmodernism’s
rejection of any form of transcendence whether it be an

ontological denial of realms beyond the material or an
epistemological denial of a ‘real’ world that transcends or is
external to our constructions. The Bahá'í teachings about the
reality of an absolutely transcendent God, the immortality of
the soul and its advance into “spiritual heavenly worlds,”57 or
the “spiritual worlds that can neither be expressed in words nor
intimated by allusion,”58 or the Concourse of High, demonstrate
that any rejection of ontological transcendence is not
compatible with the Writings. Furthermore, in his startling and
flamboyant claim that “God is dead”59 Nietzsche does not
merely reject an outmoded vision of the Christian God, but also
expresses his opposition to recognition of any transcendent
being or realm of being because those would detract from
valuing earth and life on earth.. Acceptance of the transcendent
will make us ‘naysayers” to the value of earthly, phenomenal,
material life. The epistemological denial of a real world that
transcends or is outside our constructions is also problematical.
The correspondence theory of truth to which the Writings
adhere requires there be a real world to which we can refer our
constructions, and if need be correct them.

The second reason Nietzsche’s “eternal return” clashes with
the Writings is because this doctrine runs counter to nature.
According to Nietzsche,

> all things eternally return, and ourselves with them, and
> that we have already existed times without number, and all
> things with us ... But the plexus of causes returneth in
> which I am intertwined,--it will again create me! I myself
> pertain to the causes of the eternal return. I come again
> with this sun, with this earth, with this eagle, with this
> serpent--NOT to a new life, or a better life, or a similar
> life: I come again eternally to this identical and selfsame
> life, in its greatest and its smallest, to teach again the
> eternal return of all things60

Nietzsche sees the eternal return as a sign of hope and a call
to live heroically, but the Writings clearly reject it for the same
reasons they reject incarnation. First,

> reincarnation, which is the repeated appearance of the
> same spirit with its former essence and condition in this
> same world of appearance, is impossible and
> unrealizable.61

The repetition in the eternal return and reincarnation is of the
same kind, a return of the same soul to the same conditions

without end. According to `Abdu'l-Bahá this cannot take place
because human existence is not confined to material creation:

> The idea that existence is restricted to this perishable
> world, and the denial of the existence of divine worlds,
> originally proceeded from the imaginations of certain
> believers in reincarnation; but the divine worlds are
> infinite. If the divine worlds culminated in this material
world, creation would be futile:62

Nietzsche’s eternal return denies the transcendent, non-
material, dimension of existence and requires that we live in
only one world, the world of physical creation within which we
shall be eternally re-cycled without undergoing any evolutionary
process and progress in other realms. In this statement `Abdu'l-
Bahá makes it clear that without such transcendent realms,
creation itself would have no purpose or meaning if it were
limited to material existence. Furthermore, he challenges
Nietzsche’s idea that the eternal return is a glorious and
inspiring vision by calling such a vision of life limited to the
material plane “futile.”
The eternal return is also contrary to nature, for, as `Abdu'l-
Bahá says,

> The point of the compass in describing a circle makes no
> retrograde motion, for this would be contrary to the
> natural movement and the divine order ... and a movement
> contrary to the system and law of nature is the cause of
> nonexistence. The return of the soul after death is
> contrary to the natural movement, and opposed to the
divine system.63

These statements make it clear that Nietzsche’s doctrine of
the eternal return which is so central to his philosophy, is
fundamentally incompatible with the Bahá'í Writings because
such a return violates the naturally progressive essence of the
soul. `Abdu'l-Bahá tells us that “with the human soul, there is no
decline. Its only movement is towards perfection; growth and
progress alone constitute the motion of the soul.”64 To return
to this current material state is simply unnatural.

There are also serious difficulties in reconciling the Writings
with Nietzsche’s perspectivism. A superficial examination of
the Writings might lead us to conclude that they support
Nietzsche’s perspectivism but this is a mirage. Nietzsche’s
perspectivism (and the perspectivism adopted by the
postmodernists) does not recognise that there does in fact exist

a privileged point of view, an objective ‘Archimedean point,’ a
transcendental vantage point from which to judge and evaluate
our various individual perspectives and interpretations. This, of
course, is the viewpoint of the Manifestation of God and His
appointed      interpreters.     Whatever       perspectives    and
interpretations we espouse must not reject or, at the very least,
not contradict what the Manifestation teaches and what His
specifically    appointed     successors      decree.   Nietzsche’s
philosophy, is incapable of recognizing the existence of such a
Being, Whose “Book itself is the "Unerring Balance" established
amongst men”65 by which all other views and perspectives are to
be judged. In reflecting on this we should not make the mistake
of confusing Nietzsche’s ‘Super-man’ or ‘Ueber-mensch’ with a
Manifestation. The ‘Super-man’ is a thoroughly human entity
whereas the Manifestation occupies a unique ontological
position in which He has “the station of essential unity ... [and]
the station of distinction”66 which is limited to the created
world. Moreover, the Manifestation in one station has an
ontological position transcendent to the material world –
something that Nietzsche’s philosophy is bound to reject as an
example of hostility to this life in this particular world. Nothing
in Nietzsche’s doctrine of the ‘Super-man’ provides him with
any remotely similar ontological attributes.

14\. Commen tary on the Bah á'í Wr itings an d
Heidegger

As we recall, Heidegger thought that metaphysics – “the
philosophical investigation of the nature, constitution and
structure of reality,”67 – had gone astray, and lost the “question
of Being,”68 replacing it with concern for particular beings. In
other words, metaphysics or, more precisely, western
metaphysics, replaced a concern for Being with a concern for
particular entities or instantiations of being. In his introduction
to Being and Time, he says, “ ‘Being’ cannot indeed be
conceived as an entity ... nor can ‘Being’ be derived from higher
concepts by definition, not can it be presented through lower
ones.”69 It is also impossible to define Being in the manner of
“traditional logic.”70 For Heidegger,

> Metaphysics thinks about beings as beings. Wherever the
> question is asked what beings are, beings as such are in
> sight. Metaphysical representation owes this sight to the
> light of Being. The light itself, i.e., that which such
> thinking experiences as light, does not come within the
> range of metaphysical thinking; for- metaphysics always

represents beings only as beings.71

To continue Heidegger’s metaphor, we may say that
metaphysics no longer looks at the light (of Being) by which we
see all things but only at what the light reveals and, therefore,
comes to forget Being. “Metaphysics, insofar as it always
represents only beings as beings, does not recall Being itself.
Philosophy does not concentrate on its ground.”72 In other
words, metaphysics concentrates on the surface phenomena and
forgets that which makes the surface phenomena possible, the
condition of their being-there [Da-sein].

In our view, the Writings do not agree with Heidegger that
the concern for “beings as beings,” i.e. for specific entities,
necessarily leads to a forgetfulness of Being. It may do so, but
such a result is not necessary. To understand how this can be so,
we must come to grips with the fact that the Bahá'í Writings
abound with metaphysical statements and analysis about the
nature and structure of reality including that of all kinds of
beings. The Writings make wide-spread and consistent use of
the Aristotelian method, terminology and arguments in their
analysis of reality. In the Aristotelian analysis of reality, there
are substances73 which have essential and non-essential
attributes; there are essences with necessary and accidental
attributes; there are potentials in each entity; things are
contingent or necessary, there are four causes (material, final,
formal and efficient) and all materially existing things are
composites of matter and form, and subject to corruption.
There is also a First Mover or God Who is “the object of
desire”74 for all things and towards Whom all things are
attracted. All of these concepts are found and used in the
Writings. 75 In addition, metaphysical arguments of various
kinds – for immortality, against re-incarnation, against
materialism, pantheism and the belief that the world is an
illusion – are also employed.

This leads to an important question: given their wealth of
metaphysical analysis, do the Bahá'í Writings ‘forget’ Being?
Does Heidegger’s statement that “It [metaphysics] refers to
Being and means beings as beings76” also apply to the Writings?
In our view, the answer is negative because the Bahá'í doctrine
of the essential unknowability of God’s Essence:

> Far be it from His glory that human tongue should
> adequately recount His praise, or that human heart
> comprehend His fathomless mystery. He is, and hath ever
> been, veiled in the ancient eternity of His Essence, and

> will remain in His Reality everlastingly hidden from the
> sight of men. "No vision taketh in Him, but He taketh in
> all vision; He is the Subtile, the All-Perceiving."77

Precisely because God cannot be known in His Essence – a
belief which is emphasized throughout the Bahá'í Writings – we
cannot make God into another particular being subject to
definitions and “traditional logic.”78 All the specific images of
God as an entity are no more than products of our own
individual and/or collective imaginations, or heuristic images
provided by Manifestations for a particular time and place.
These images are not real although they serve a heuristic
purpose that both facilitates and limits our thoughts and
feelings at the same time. If understood correctly, they draw
attention to the utterly transcendent which does not exist as a
being ‘like any other’ and prevent us from forgetting Being
completely.

In other words, if we keep God’s unknowability foremost in
mind, we shall not mistake a being for Being. Since God’s
Essence is unknowable, we can only observe the “signs of God”
(presence of God.) in all created things.79 To use Heidegger’s
metaphor, since we cannot look at the sun, we can still become
aware of the light and how that light is received by individual
beings. Through reflective prayer guided by the Manifestation,
we can still be aware of the light by which we see and its Source:
“No thing have I perceived, except that I perceived God within
it, God before it, or God after it.”80 It is precisely Bahá'u'lláh’s
revelation with its emphasis on the unknowability of God that
ensures we do not forget That which is the very condition for
our being and knowing.

Because the Bahá'í Writings avoid the metaphysical trap of
mistaking Being for ‘a being’ and, forgetting Being, Bahá'ís can
agree with Heidegger’s analogy between Being and colour:

> Color shines and wants only to shine. When we analyse it
> in rational terms by measuring its wavelengths, it is gone.
> It shows itself only when it remains undisclosed and
> unexplained. Earth thus shatters every attempt to
> penetrate into it. it causes every merely calculating
> importunity to turn to a destruction ... The earth appears
> only cleared and as itself when it is perceived and
> preserved as that which is by nature undisclosable ....”81

Here we see the ineluctability of God or Being, the
“generous,”82 Who “wants only to shine” and on Whom all

beings depend for their existence. However, as with colour, the
moment we begin analysis we lose the very thing we seek to
analyse; propositional knowledge and calculative and
technological reasoning is of no use in understanding Being.
Indeed, the truest thing we can say about God or Being is that it
is utterly transcendent and “undisclosable.”

Our conclusion is that on the fundamental issue, the Bahá'í
Writings both agree and disagree. They agree with Heidegger
insofar as Being or God is absolutely beyond human conception
and that all our concepts are deficient in this regard. However,
the Writings also show that the doctrine of the unknowability
of God’s Essence is the antidote needed to prevent metaphysics
from diminishing God into a being ‘like the others.’ This
disagreement is fundamental insofar as there is no way to bridge
Heidegger’s rejection of metaphysics and the Writings’ use of
them.

At this point an extremely thorny problem intrudes. Is there
any correspondence between the Bahá'í concept of God and
Heidegger’s concept of Being? Heidegger’s views varied over his
career. In his first major work, Being and Time, we observe
“little interest in the idea that being [Being] is the ground of
beings.”83 “Later, being [Being] is the ground of being ... ‘being
offers us no ground and basis on which we build and in which
we dwell – as do the beings to which we turn. Being is the nay-
saying [Ab-sage] to the role of such grounding...’ “84 Not
surprisingly, there has been considerable discussion of
Heidegger’s alleged atheism – but this has not hindered theistic
views of his work from appearing in large numbers. We are in
no position to engage in this highly complex debate here.
However, we must not overlook the fact that Heidegger’s lack
of clarity on this issue contrasts sharply with the Writings which
see the recognition of God has the first and most essential duty
of humankind: “I bear witness O my God, that Thou has created
me to know Thee and to worship Thee...” Any vacillation or
lack of absolute clarity on this issue is in conflict with the
Bahá'í Writings.

Another area of serious disagreement between Heidegger and
the Writings is his unqualified rejection of the correspondence
theory of truth: “truth has by no means the structure of an
agreement between knowing and the object in the sense of a
likening of one entity (the subject) to another (the Object).”85
He also writes, “In what way is this relation [of
correspondence] possible as a relation between intellectus
[mind/intellect] and res [thing/object]?”86 Heidegger has no

confidence in the mind’s ability to form concepts that
correspond to or are adequate to reality.

According to the Bahá'í Writings, the correspondence theory
of truth is valid insofar as it can provide genuine and adequate
knowledge in its appropriate sphere of action. It cannot, for
example, apply to ‘knowledge’ of God Who is unknowable in
his essence; not can it apply to the direct or immediate
knowledge of the essence of things. The appropriate sphere of
human knowledge is whatever can be known by the qualities or
attributes of a thing.87 Thus, the Writings disagree with
Heidegger’s complete rejection of the correspondence theory of
truth. On this issue, `Abdu'l-Bahá writes,

> Reflect that man's power of thought consists of two
> kinds. One kind is true, when it agrees with a determined
> truth. Such conceptions find realization in the exterior
> world; such are accurate opinions, correct theories,
> scientific discoveries and inventions.
> The other kind of conceptions is made up of vain thoughts
> and useless ideas which yield neither fruit nor result, and
> which have no reality. No, they surge like the waves of the
> sea of imaginations, and they pass away like idle dreams.88

He says a thought or concept is true “when it agrees with a
determined truth,” and describes “conceptions [that] find their
realization in the exterior world” as “accurate opinions, correct
theories, scientific discoveries and inventions.” Clearly these are
references to correspondence between our ideas and reality. On
the other hand, “useless ideas” or concepts which “have no
reality” and therefore produce no results obviously do not
correspond to reality. Moreover, the action of overcoming and
correcting mistakes and learning to which the Writings refer
obviously require bringing our conceptions into correspondence
with reality. Finally, the Writings clearly believe in scientific
progress, and that, in turn, depends on ever-improving
correspondence between our concepts and the things we study;
our knowledge gains in accuracy, scope, explanatory and
predictive power and opens hidden aspects of reality that allow
us to make new discoveries and inventions. If our knowledge
did not correspond to reality, this would not be possible.
Conversely, the Writings assert the existence of error,
ignorance and superstition. In other words, there are beliefs
that do not correspond to reality, and these must be corrected.

Heidegger      also   doubts   the   ability   of   language,     or

propositions to convey the whole truth about things: “the
traditional assignment of truth exclusively to statements as the
sole essential locus of truth falls away. Truth does not originally
reside in the proposition.”89 In other words, there are truths
about things that cannot be adequately conveyed in language.
Heidegger doubts that mere verbal propositions lacking proper
grounding in a relationship to Being can ever satisfactorily
correspond to real specific beings. The Bahá'í Writings agree
with him on this point, albeit it with serious qualifications. We
observe the boundaries of what words can say, for example
when `Abdu'l-Bahá tells us that the full meaning of first chapter
of John in the Bible (“In the beginning ... “) is “beyond the
power of books or words to contain and express.”90 Obviously,
there are limits to humankind’s powers of comprehension and
explanation. However, while language and propositions have
their limitations, they are not as incapable of reflecting reality
as Heidegger seems to think. There is no absolute disconnect
between language and all aspects of reality. If there were, the
Writings would not be able to endorse the concept of progress
i.e. improvements in accuracy, scope, explanatory and
predictive power, in scientific understanding or in many other
human endeavours. For progress to occur, true propositions
about reality must reflect reality with some degree of accuracy.

Nonetheless, the Writings agree with Heidegger insofar as a
proper relationship to and understanding of Being is necessary
to acquire a fully adequate knowledge of particular beings.
Heidegger writes,

> it becomes plain that to clarify the structure of a truth it
> is not enough simply to presuppose this relational totality
> [of complete correspondence between mind and object]
> but we must go back and inquire into the context of Being
which provides the support for this totality as such.91

In terms of the Bahá'í Writings, this means that to have the
fullest possible understanding of specific beings, we also need
to take Being or God into consideration, since God provides the
ground for the very possibility of specific beings even coming
into existence. Being or God is the condition for the existence
of all things. Without a proper relationship to Being, we might,
for example, degrade things to merely material objects without
seeing the “signs of God” in them and think that their existence
is entirely for our use. Such understanding of things would be
unsatisfactory and easily leads to error. This situation is
precisely why science and its propositional knowledge and
religion, and its relationship to Being, must work together to

attain appropriate knowledge of things.

For the Writings, the correspondence theory of truth is valid
not just of material reality but also of spiritual realities, though
to comprehend these higher realities requires assistance of the
Holy Spirit to develop our “spiritual susceptibilities.”92 When
these are developed, we can correct our ignorance of “divine
religion”93 and think “beyond the range of the senses”94 and
attain the “conscious pathway to the Kingdom of God.”95
`Abdu'l-Bahá tells us that a person who “possesses no spiritual
susceptibilities [] is uninformed of the heavenly world”96; this is
another statement which implicitly posits a correspondence
between our thoughts and reality. That the correspondence
theory also applies to spiritual realities is seen by the close
association between wisdom and the heart:

> Sow the seeds of My divine wisdom in the pure soil of thy
> heart, and water them with the water of certitude, that the
> hyacinths of My knowledge and wisdom may spring up
> fresh and green in the sacred city of thy heart.97

Not only does the heart attain knowledge of spiritual
realities, but it is also capable of ‘thinking’ albeit it in its own
way and attaining understanding: “Ponder this in thine heart,
that thou mayest comprehend its meaning,”98 Such exhortations
to ponder things in our hearts are frequent throughout
Bahá'u'lláh’s Writings and indicate that the heart is capable of
acquiring knowledge and understanding. However, this does not
mean the knowledge attained by the heart is incompatible with
the knowledge attained by reason and other ways:

> If thou wishest the divine knowledge and recognition,
> purify thy heart from all beside God, be wholly attracted
> to the ideal, beloved One; search for and choose Him and
> apply thyself to rational and authoritative arguments. For
> arguments are a guide to the path and by this the heart will
> be turned unto the Sun of Truth. And when the heart is
> turned unto the Sun, then the eye will be opened and will
> recognize the Sun through the Sun itself. Then (man) will
> be in no need of arguments (or proofs), for the Sun is
> altogether independent, and absolute independence is in
> need of nothing, and proofs are one of the things (of
> which absolute independence has no need).99

In other words, arguments can clear the way for the heart’s
direct perception of the truth after which point, such arguments
will no longer be needed. When the heart is turned to the sun,

we will understand, but we will understand in a way not
mediated by propositions.

Heidegger agrees with the Writings on the issue of truth
simply making itself known, through “disclosedness”100 of Being
and the Being of beings. Letting the Being of beings and Being
itself or God unconceal itself is a higher, or more profound kind
of knowledge than can be stated in propositions. This does not
mean propositional knowledge is unimportant; as we see in
`Abdu'l-Bahá’s words above, propositional knowledge plays an
essential part in the development of the heart - but it is not the
ultimate knowledge we have. However, there are limits to this
agreement between the Writings and Heidegger. The Writings
cannot agree that the knowledge revealed by the assistance of
the Holy Spirit not only reveals but also, in its inherent nature,
conceals and, thereby, leads us into error. This knowledge is
“infallible and indubitable ... and this is the condition in which
certainty alone can be attained.” 101 In contrast, Heidegger says,
“The disclosure of beings as such is simultaneously and
intrinsically the concealing of being as a whole”102 because “[i]n
the simultaneity of disclosure and concealing errancy holds
sway. Errancy and the concealing of what is concealed belong to
the primordial essence of truth.103 The Bahá'í Writings nowhere
suggest that error or “errancy” is an intrinsic part of truth
itself. Our knowledge of the truth may be a mixture of truth
and error but this fact does not extend to the truth in itself, i.e.
“the primordial essence of truth.” Indeed, separating light
“from darkness, , truth from falsehood, right from wrong,
guidance from error”104 is one of the reasons for the
Manifestation’s appearance.

15\. Lyotar d an d the Bahá'í Writin gs

The Bahá'í Writings and Lyotard’s postmodernism are in
conflict on all fundamental points. It is impossible to embrace
them both without losing logical consistency and thereby
becoming hamstrung both in thought and action. One cannot
both reject metanarratives and accept only small, local
narratives [petits recits], and at the same time accept
progressive revelation as the paradigm for humankind’s spiritual
history and global unity as the goal of earthly evolution without
completely undermining one’s own position intellectually and
thereby making consistent thought and action impossible. As a
metanarrative of humankind’s religious and even non-religious
history, progressive revelation is integral to the identity of the
Bahá'í Faith. It is the foundation on which belief in the essential

unity of all religions and of humankind is built. Any philosophy
which rejects metanarratives is, for that reason alone,
fundamentally at odds with the Bahá'í teachings. On the issue of
metanarratives at least, the Bahá'í Writings are in the same
company as Hegel, Marx, Toynbee and Sorokin to name only a
few of the best-known examples of metanarratives of human
history.

It is also clear that the Bahá'í Writings privilege the
metanarrative revealed by the Manifestations over all other
metanarratives. For our time, Bahá'u'lláh is described as the
“true Physician”105 Whose Book is the “infallible remedy”106 that
provides the vision for understanding our world as well as
previous dispensations. Obviously, for the Writings, not all
remedies - or metanarratives - are equally effective or true.
Some are more true, or appropriate or effective than others and
those presented by the Manifestations are supreme. From this it
is also evident that the Bahá'í Writings reject the relativism
inherent in Lyotard’s thought. If all metanarratives are on par,
and there is no external ‘Archimedian standpoint’ from which to
judge among them, it becomes impossible to distinguish
knowledge from superstition, scientific fact from fiction,
divine revelation from imagination and, of course, good from
evil. All differences are justified as differences of viewpoint. If
no viewpoint, or, metanarrative is privileged over any other,
then they are all equally valid, and this leaves us with an
epistemological and moral relativism according to which we can
make no objective or universal judgments about any
statements.

This relativism inherent in Lyotard’s philosophy is
problematic for the Writings because they do not maintain that
all moral positions are equal – they clearly privilege love and
peace over hatred and war – nor do they assert that superstition
is equal to true knowledge or that all putative physicians for
mankind’s ills are of equal skill. They also uphold objective and
universal truths such as progressive revelation, the inability to
know essences directly, the “rational soul” as humankind’s
distinguishing characteristic, and most importantly, the absolute
existence of God. Nowhere do they suggest that contrary views
on these and many other issues are equally valid as relativism is
bound to maintain. The Writings are full of references to those
who deny the teachings of the Manifestation as “ignorant”, in
“‘error,” subject to “superstition,” “mistaken” and even
“absurd.” By such means the Writings actively oppose the idea
that all viewpoints are equally valid and that none is privileged

over any other. However, we hasten to add that the recognition
that the Manifestation’s teachings are privileged, does not
justify a feeling or attitude of personal superiority to the other
as a fellow human being. The other’s view may be mistaken but
s/he is still a creation of God and must be treated as such:

> Necessarily there will be some who are defective amongst
> men, but it is our duty to enable them by kind methods of
> guidance and teaching to become perfected. Some will be
> found who are morally sick; they should be treated in
> order that they may be healed. Others are immature and
> like children; they must be trained and educated so that
> they may become wise and mature. Those who are asleep
> must be awakened; the indifferent must become mindful
> and attentive. But all this must be accomplished in the
> spirit of kindness and love and not by strife, antagonism
> nor in a spirit of hostility and hatred, for this is contrary
> to the good pleasure of God.107

Another      serious    conflict    between     Lyotard    (and
postmodernism in general) and the Writings is that the Writings
accept various binary oppositions rejected by Lyotard as
“terrorist,”108 because they can be used to “eliminate[] or
threaten[] to eliminate, a player [point of view, culture] from
the language game [or metanarrative] one shares with them.”109
As we have already seen in previous sections, the Writings
accept the binary opposition of ‘rational’ and ‘irrational’, and
privilege the rational by stating that humankind is distinguished
from animals by the “rational soul.” Another such binary
opposition is ‘civilized’ and ‘uncivilized’, with the former being
clearly privileged as the desirable state for man. For example, in
Paris Talks, ‘Abdu'l-Bahá makes it clear that Mohammed raised
the Arabs who were “a people as savage and uncivilized as the
wild beasts”110 to a higher, more civilized state. The Writings
also make use of the oppositional binary ‘knowledge’ and
‘superstition’ and unhesitatingly privilege the former.
‘Superstition’ is always a term of opprobrium and
condemnation as seen in the following statement: “It is,
therefore, clear that in order to make any progress in the search
after truth we must relinquish superstition.”111 This theme is
constantly repeated in the numerous references to science and
religion: “If religion does not agree with science, it is
superstition and ignorance.”112 Quite patently, `Abdu'l-Bahá is
condemning superstition, and, in the second quote, privileging
science. He wants us to overcome error, i.e. to leave behind and
marginalise erroneous beliefs instead of succumbing to them.

This, of course, is not to say that the Writings accept any and
all binary oppositions; oppositional binaries based on race,
nationality and wealth for, example, are not acceptable and
must be overcome.113 We may reject and marginalise ideas but
we must not marginalise individual human beings. However, the
fact that the Writings accept oppositional binaries in any
situation puts them in profound conflict with Lyotard’s
theories.

The Bahá'í Writings can only accept some aspects of
Lyotard’s language game theory. Language game theory, as we
recall, is a development of his theory of metanarrative. Very
briefly, a language game is a particular use of language,
according to particular rules, and these rules vary from game to
game. Science is a language game; so are religion, philosophy,
literature. Every society is/has a language game. For the
Writings, there is no difficulty with the idea that various
cultures and subcultures have different language games and that
a language game is necessary for the existence of society.
However, the Writings cannot accept the claim that a universal
metalanguage114 cannot exist, since the revelation brought by
the Manifestations may be seen as being exactly that, a universal
language game or metanarrative applicable to all cultures and all
human beings. The unification of humankind requires that we
all agree to at least one, universal language game. This is
possible because the Writings maintain that all human beings
share the same human nature which is specifically characterized
by the possession of a “rational soul.”115 The universal
possession of a “rational soul” is the foundation of Bahá'í
anthropology or theory of man as well as the foundation for all
hopes for the unity of humankind; without a common,
universal, essential human nature such unity would have nothing
to build on.

According to Lyotard, language games are water-tight
compartments that prohibit any critical inter-action since they
use language according to different rules. There is really no
possibility of sensible criticism and debate. How could the rules
of tennis be used to critique the rules of soccer? Thus, unlike
the Writings, Lyotard’s theory, resurrected by Stephen J
Gould’s concept of “non-overlapping magisteria”116 sees no
possibility or even need for a dialogue, consensus and harmony
between science and religion since they are playing different
language games. From this point of view, science and religion
are confined in “two solitudes”117 and the goal of harmonizing
them is a willow-the-wisp; they are not competitors and,

therefore, do not need harmonizing. Of course, such a view is
philosophically untenable. Whether or not science and religion
are two disparate language games, the fact is that at least some
scientific discoveries have implications for religion and some
religious teachings have implications for science. The “two
solitudes” are not totally isolated and do, indeed, interact, and
for that reason may be in conflict that requires harmonizing.
This is further emphasised by the Bahá'í teaching that “truth is
one, although its manifestations may be very different.”118 Since
that is the case, it follows logically that we should “earnestly
endeavour to be the means of uniting religion and science.”119

`Abdu'l-Bahá advocates more than “two solitudes” that do
not conflict by virtue of not communicating with each other,
rather, he wants that “Religion and science walk hand in
hand.”120

Lyotard rejects the possibility or need for critical interaction
among language games and metanarratives because he is
concerned about preserving heterogeneity or diversity. This
cannot be achieved if one metanarrative or language game
becomes dominant and arrogantly identifies their views with
reality itself and, thereby, turns “terrorist”121 by excluding or
otherwise silencing conflicting views.

> His ‘war on totality’ rejects totalizing theories which he
> describes as master narratives [metanarratives] that are
> somehow reductionistic , simplistic and even ‘terroristic’
> by providing legitimations for totalitarian terror and
suppressing differences in unifying schemes.122

Instead, Lyotard wants us to recognise “the heteromorphous
nature of language games,”123 in order to preserve the diversity
of games and metanarratives. Even freely arrived at consensus is
rejected124 because that is simply another way for a majority to
pressure and oppress a minority and requires the surrender of
the very attributes that provide a unique identity and mode of
existence. Instead Lyotard “champions dissensus over
consensus, diversity and dissent over conformity and consensus
and heterogeneity and the incommensurable over homogeneity
and universality.”125 This position, held in some form by all
postmodernist philosophers, makes them suspicious of anything
that seems likely to diminish heterogeneity by attempting to
subsume differences – even if this is presented as a freely
arrived at consensus – within a single, all-encompassing i.e.
‘totalizing’ metanarrative and language game. Because of this
“irreducible pluralism”126 there can be at best temporary local

arrangements (but no permanent institutions) “in the
professional, emotional, sexual, cultural, family and
international domains”127 that can be dissolved at any time at
the behest of the ‘players.’ From this point of view, the Bahá'í
teaching of “unity in diversity”128 could very easily be seen as
operating to suppress diversity for the sake of unity, and
thereby become a recipe for “terrorism.” The concept of a
‘totalizing’ metareligion trying to unify all other religions into
one by concentrating on the essential “oneness of religion”129 is,
from the postmodernist viewpoint, a threat to the independent
existence of all other metanarratives and language games, as is
the desire to establish world unity through some form of global
commonwealth. Such a project inevitably requires the
establishment of permanent global institutions and would
thereby diminish heterogeneity in customs of governance. All
would have to submit to and find their place in the
metanarrative of the development of global unity. Furthermore,
despite the fact that all Bahá'ís have the right and duty to
investigate the truth for himself and to speak their minds freely,
postmodernists like Lyotard see this principle as severely
compromised and undermined by the enormous emphasis put on
unity in Bahá'í community life and LSA decisions. At the
personal level, the use of standardized prayer books as distinct
from extemporaneous individual prayer, is a further example of
control over the language game as is the existence of authorized
and infallible interpreters of the Manifestation’s Word. Rather
than embrace the unity provided by such limitations of the
language game and metanarrative, Lyotard prefers to celebrate
endless pluralities and heterogeneities for no other reason than
their differences. According to him, most people have lost their
interest in grand narratives.130 Finally, with his emphasis on
“dissensus” Lyotard is bound to be highly suspicious of the
entire consultation process because it can be seen as a way to
minimize diversity in the quest for consensus.

It is difficult to avoid the conclusion that Lyotard and the
Bahá'í Writings are in deep conflict. As noted at the outset of
this paper, there may be some areas of minor or superficial
agreement between them, but on the essential and foundational
issues there is none.

16\. The Bahá'í Writin gs an d Derrida

As with Lyotard, the Bahá'í Writings have a considerable
number of foundational differences with the philosophy of
Jacques Derrida. These would preclude harmony on anything

but superficialities and incidentals. The first of these
foundational differences concerns Derrida’s rejection of
‘privilege’ in regards to knowers and knowledge.

Unlike Derrida, the Bahá'í Writings recognise the existence
of privileged knowers, the Manifestations of God, Who possess
“essential infallibility,”131 or the “Most Great Infallibility”132
which makes it impossible for them to err in Their teaching.
They are “endowed with divine knowledge, not dependent upon
learning acquired in schools”133 and are distinguished above all
others of mankind in every aspect and qualification in order
that He may be able to train effectively the human body politic,
eliminate the darkness enshrouding the human world, uplift
humanity from a lower to a higher kingdom.134

The knowledge of these “infallible Physician[s]”135 is not just
another point of view or interpretation in an endless series of
such, but rather, is the standard by which all other knowledge
must be assessed: “Weigh not the Book of God with such
standards and sciences as are current amongst you, for the Book
itself is the unerring Balance established amongst men.” 136
Obviously, this Book which can only measured by its own
standard137 is privileged above all other human knowledge, and,
in effect, is a transcendental or Archimedean standpoint from
which all other viewpoints may be evaluated. Furthermore, in
the Bahá'í Dispensation there are `Abdu'l-Bahá, an infallible
interpreter of Bahá'u'lláh’s Word, as well as the Guardian whose
interpretations of Bahá'u'lláh’s teachings are also infallible.138 In
addition, the Bahá'í Faith also recognises that the Universal
House of Justice is “under the unerring guidance of God”139 in
its appointed sphere of operations.

The existence of these privileged knowers and interpreters is
fatal to the deconstructive project because they establish an
outside, transcendental privileged Archimedean standpoint
from which to judge human viewpoints and, thereby, impose
limits on       the    endless “play,”     self-subversion   and
supplementation of texts that is crucial to deconstruction. They
also place boundaries within which the Writings may be
understood. The problem is that such parameters deprive the
deconstructionist project of its very reason for being and its
modus operandi. An instructive example of how the presence of
privileged interpreters sets constraints on our understanding of
the Writings is the issue of homosexuality. Bahá'u'lláh’s
statements about “boys”140 has been interpreted by Shoghi
Effendi to mean a prohibition of homosexual behavior and
relationships.141 For Bahá'ís, the Guardian’s understanding ends

the “play” of words, of self-subversion and of supplementarities
and imposes a final and authoritative meaning on what
Bahá'u'lláh means. To emphasise its denial of any privileged
interpreters of texts, deconstructionism rejects even the notion
that the author has any privileged insight into his own creation.

In regards to the rejection of privilege, it should be noted
that in distinction to Derrida, the Writings privilege one
member of certain oppositional binaries such as good and evil,
rational and irrational, truth and untruth, God and creation
and, as we shall see, signifier and signified. In ontology they also
accept such binary oppositions as substance and attribute,
essential and incidental (accidental), contingent and necessary all
of which deconstructionism rejects. For example, `Abdu'l-Bahá
writes,

> Some think that the body is the substance and exists by
> itself, and that the spirit is accidental and depends upon
> the substance of the body, although, on the contrary, the
> rational soul is the substance, and the body depends upon
> it. If the accident--that is to say, the body--be destroyed,
> the substance, the spirit, remains.142

Very obviously, substance is completely different from
attribute and is superior to it insofar as the accident or
attribute depends on the substance. In the case of the human
soul, the substance does not need the accidental or contingent
human body to exist. In this sense, the rational soul, as
substance, is privileged over the accidental, or, to put it another
way, the essence is privileged over the accident.

Without privileging the substance over the accident `Abdu'l-
Bahá would not be able to establish his proof of the immortality
of the soul – a key Bahá'í doctrine. And what would be the point
of having a Manifestation’s guidance, if we were not willing to
privilege good over evil, the rational over the irrational, truth
over untruth? Who would we need any guidance at all? The
Writings, however, clearly state that humankind needs this
guidance for its material and spiritual evolution, and, therefore,
privilege good over evil, love over hatred, knowledge over
ignorance, truth over lies143 and, as we shall see below, the
rational over the irrational. There is no question for them of
reversing this order by invoking Derrida’s “aporias” i.e. by
invoking explanations that lie outside the standard rules of
reasoning and logic.144 For the Writings, there is simply no need
to puzzle ourselves over the superiority of truth over ignorance
and superstition and the need to overcome the latter. The same

case holds for religion. If we are not willing to privilege God
over creation, by recognising God’s ontological independence
and primacy, then there is no possibility of having religion at all
since religion requires the recognition of some original or
foundational Source however it be envisioned.

Although we have already done so in our discussion of the
Bahá'í Writings and the Counter-enlightenment, it is necessary
to draw attention again to the privileging of reason precisely
because this is so contradictory to Derrida’s deconstructionism,
its rejection of binary oppositions and its “aporias.” It may, of
course, be argued that these “aporias” represent moments of
higher insight beyond the merely rational and for that reason
find some resonance in the Writing’s concepts of trans-rational,
intuitive, ‘mystical’ insight gained with the aid of the Holy
Spirit. The Bahá'í Faith certainly recognises these, but the
situation with Derrida’s “aporias” is different. Derrida’s
“aporias” overturn various binary oppositions in order to
destabilise and un-privilege them whereas the moments of
inspiration    and     transcendental   insight    confirm    the
Manifestation’s teachings and the binary oppositions He
establishes, such as, for example, the precedence of knowledge
over ignorance, and love over hatred and God over creation.
That said, let us turn our attention to the privileging of reason
by the Bahá'í Writings.

The Bahá'í Writings, of course, do not regard human reason
as infallible but they clearly privilege reason and the rational
even in religion. Reason is necessary for humankind’s spiritual
evolution but it is not, by itself, sufficient for our spiritual
development. It must be guided by the Manifestations and
“fortified by the Holy Spirit”145 in order to become informed of
the mysteries of the world of significances”146 that constitute
the world of creation. Reason is privileged in Bahá'í
anthropology or theory of humankind. According to `Abdu'l-
Bahá, “[t]he human spirit which distinguishes man from the
animal is the rational soul, and these two names--the human
spirit and the rational soul - designate one thing. 147 The fact
that reason is the essential, and universal feature distinguishing
man from animal is significant because this means that all
human beings share this capacity and have a common, inherent
nature or essence regardless of historical period, place or
culture. Reason already unifies humankind in essence and can,
therefore, be the foundational capacity for manifesting the
unity of humankind in the phenomenal world. It can also be the
basis of recognizing the essential oneness of all religions and

progressive revelation.

Reason is also necessary to faith and spiritual development,
for as `Abdu'l-Bahá says, “If a question be found contrary to
reason, faith and belief in it are impossible, and there is no
outcome but wavering and vacillation”148 and “If religion is
opposed to reason and science, faith is impossible; and when
faith and confidence in the divine religion are not manifest in
the heart, there can be no spiritual attainment.”149 This is an
example of where the Manifestation and His appointed
interpreter have dissolved a binary opposition – faith and
reason – but this should not be interpreted as a blanket
rejection of all such oppositions.

Privileging reason or the rational soul obviously limits our
ability to fully engage in deconstructive “play” with relevant
passages because we now have a privileged viewpoint or
perspective from which to judge and possibly deny the validity
of other ideas. We can now at least begin the process of
distinguishing knowledge from superstition, rationality from
irrationality, truth from error or deceptions. Once again we
observe how the position adopted by the Writings undermines
and effectively negates the entire deconstructive project.

The Bahá'í Writings also privilege through the agency of
humankind insofar as man, whose unique identifying feature is
“the rational soul” is “the highest creature of the phenomenal
world.”150 Creation itself would have no purpose without man:
“This world is also in the condition of a fruit tree, and man is
like the fruit; without fruit the tree would be useless.”151 Thus
we can see that reason is also privileged ontologically in regards
to the make-up or nature of reality by characterizing it as the
distinguishing feature of God’s highest creation.

Deconstruction programmatically rejects all privileging
because it limits the “play” of words, subversions and
supplementarities. We might say that deconstructionism rejects
these binaries for ‘political’ reasons, insofar as privileging one
term arbitrarily imposes it on the other, it imposes an order of
value and importance, thereby marginalising one of them. To
use Lyotard’s term, privileging is “terroristic” since this
imposed, authoritarian order, limits our freedom to follow the
“play” of concepts. The rejection of privilege accords with
deconstruction’s refusal to subsume things under universal
concepts such as ‘human,’ ‘human nature’ or ‘species,’ i.e. the
refusal to recognise essences. Such universal concepts152 are a
form of violence and totalitarianism against the heterogeneity

of the individual. Deconstruction is supposed to free us from
such conceptual oppression.

There are still other problems between Derrida and the Bahá'í
Writings. To understand one of the most important, it is worth
while recalling Jonathan Culler’s remark that “[t]o deconstruct
a discourse [text] is to show how it undermines the philosophy
it asserts, or the hierarchical oppositions on which it relies…”153
Given the infinite play of traces and infinite supplementarity,
we can never know what a text of any kind really means. There
can be no authoritative, final self-sufficient interpretation of a
text because the concept of infinite supplementation means that
“meaning is always deferred.”154 Meaning is something that
simultaneously is and is not, something that never is and is
always to be. It cannot be definitively established for two
reasons. First, any interpretation of a text is itself subject to
the “play” of traces, supplements and substitutions and thus at
least as ambiguous as the original text itself. Second, the self-
sufficient, essential and privileged meaning cannot be
established by logical or rational means because reason depends
on the principle of identity and non-contradiction: “A = A” and
“A thing cannot be A and not-A in the same respect at the same
time.” The “play” of supplements prevents precisely that simple
identification of “A” with itself; it is always “A and not-quite-
A” because of the traces and supplements originating in links to
the whole linguistic system. Christopher Norris’ comment about
literary critics is apropos to anyone reading a text by Derrida’s
deconstructionist method:

> if interpretation is always caught up in a chain of
> proliferating sense which it can neither halt nor fully
> comprehend, then the critic [or any reader] is effectively
> absolved of all responsibility for limiting the play of his
own imagination.155

Indeed, if the traces and supplements can ultimately extend
through the entire linguistic system there is no reason to
arbitrarily call a halt to interpretation. Derrida’s position leads
to the unavoidable conclusion no one can ever really know what
a text is about since both the text and all its interpretations are
constantly undermining themselves. In more general terms,
there can be no knowledge at all because all knowledge is
embodied in texts written or spoken and is, therefore, subject
to the “play” of traces and supplements.

Derrida’s position is extremely problematical for all religious
texts. Why would any religious revelation endorse an

undertaking which is guaranteed to create additional and
needless ambiguity to texts meant to provide guidance for
human thought and action? Why would a Manifestation speak in
such a way as to undermine or subvert His own meaning? Doing
so would sow needless confusion and contention among people
and thereby defeat the very purpose of religion which is “to
establish unity and concord amongst the peoples of the world;
make it not the cause of dissension and strife.”156 The
prevention of such confusion and contention is the very reason
for appointing `Abdu'l-Bahá and Shoghi Effendi as infallible
interpreters. Indeed, if we take the deconstructionist project to
its logical conclusion, we could never know, not even in
principle, what any particular text (revealed or not) actually says
since an infinite number of supplementations could lead to an
infinite number of interpretations at least some of which would
be in direct conflict. This may sound fine in theory but in
practice it is unworkable for a religion trying to unify
humankind, to explicate its teachings clearly and to engage in
meaningful inter-faith dialogue.

It is difficult if not impossible to avoid concluding that
Derrida’s position leads to a profound and corrosive scepticism
about humankind’s ability to obtain and articulate knowledge.
In fact, the whole concept of knowledge distinguishable from
fiction, lies, pretence, error and mythology is thrown into
question. Problems begin with Derrida’s refusal to recognise the
signifier/signified distinction. If at least some propositions and
statements, i.e. signifiers do not refer to some entity or state of
affairs external or transcendental to the signifier but only to the
play of differences in a language system, then how can these
propositions provide knowledge of the world? Derrida’s theory
leads to a profound disconnect between human discourse and
reality, a disconnect so fundamental that it effectively denies
our ability to get knowledge and communicate about the world.
This position is known as scepticism. All we have, in the last
analysis, are different stories, interpretations, perspectives or
texts, each as valid as the next in its own way (see Lyotard’s
position on the validity of each language game), with none
privileged over any other. Furthermore, there is no possible way
to choose between accounts or texts, since there is no way for
humans to attain a transcendental viewpoint, i.e. a viewpoint
outside of all texts from which to make a judgment. Not only
does this conflict with the Writings’ acceptance of privileged
knowers, but also throws into question the whole concept of
progress i.e. overcoming error in favour of more accurate views
in science or any other area of study. psychology or history.

Progress in science and knowledge of reality in general is an
integral part of progressive revelation. Such deep scepticism
also conflicts with the Writings because it undermines the
concept of reason as a means of achieving progress: reason
itself becomes just another perspective or method of acquiring
‘knowledge’ without having any privileged status. In addition,
Derrida’s view undermines ethics insofar as we can no longer
distinguish the liar from the truthful person: if there is no
independent, i.e. transcendental truth about any situation, all
we have left is confused and conflicting welter of perspectives,
interpretations, claims and counter-claims all of equal validity.

The Writings do not accept Derrida’s view that words do not
refer to a “transcendental” of some kind, i.e. to an object,
person, situation, process or phenomenon that is external to a
particular language. Words, according to Derrida, refer only to
other words in a language and not to something else; to put it
another way, there is no external, transcendental signified
beyond the signifier. In the Bahá'í view, this is untenable. What
would become of the word “God”? If it did not refer to an
‘other’ outside of language, the whole purpose of religion would
be negated, as would the concept of a Manifestation of God,
not to mention God’s Will, or the Names of God. Religion
would literally be reduced to a ‘word-game’ in which each word
simply refers to another in an endless web of cross-references.
Prayer, especially petitionary prayer would lose their rationale
and purpose, as, for example, the Noonday prayer with its daily
rededication of ourselves to “know [God] and to worship
[Him].”157 What be the point of testifying to “[our] powerless
and Thy might”158 if there was nothing external and
transcendental to us Whose power we are recognising? The same
would be true of the Writings’ ontological statements such as
the following: “The essence of a thing is known through its
qualities; otherwise, it is unknown and hidden.”159 What could
this mean if the word ‘essence’ were not a reference to
something outside of language and did not direct us to
something in the object we are studying?

Derrida’s belief that the signifiers do not refer to an external,
transcendental signified undermines all concepts of knowledge
since our statements do not ultimately refer to the world (of
“transcendental” others) but to the linguistic system we inhabit.
Inevitably, this concept undermines the concept of progress in
scientific knowledge.160 How could we measure progress if all
propositions are only about the language system? How could we
know what is or is not true if there is a fundamental disconnect

between our statements and reality? The Bahá'í Writings, of
course cannot accept the existence of such a disconnect, as
made clear by the transcendental references in the frequent
allusions to the discovery of truths or realities in the world
around us. If language cannot tell us anything about reality, i.e.
reflect reality with some degree of accuracy, why would we
bother with Bahá'u'lláh’s and `Abdu'l-Bahá ‘s statements about
the current condition of the world, about the necessary
remedies, about the nature of the soul, the structure of creation
and so on? If these statements do not refer to reality but only to
other words, they are pointless.

Because Derrida posits a disconnect between the signifier and
the signified, between words and what they refer to, i.e. he
rejects the belief that “properties, kinds, relations,
propositions, sets and states of affairs are taken to be primitive
[fundamental and real] and irreducible.”161 In other words,
Derrida is a nominalist, holding that humans construct the
concepts referring to            “properties, kinds, relations,
propositions, sets and states of affairs” and that these
constructions do not necessarily reflect reality. Our ideas
represented by words do not exist outside our minds. General
terms, or universals, such as ‘chair’ or ‘red’ refer to nothing that
the objects of reference actually possess in common but are,
rather, an arbitrary selection that ignores or marginalises some
attributes by privileging others. Only individuals in their full
heterogeneity are real. Hence,“[d]econstruction is opposed to
anything that claims to gather up, to unite, to bring together as
one,”162 i.e. any concept that ‘violates’ individuality by lumping
many individuals under a single category or thought – or
organization. There is, for example, no human nature or essence
– something which, as we have seen, the Bahá'í Writings flatly
assert just as they assert the existence of a plant and animal
nature or essence.163. It is precisely because essences are real that
`Abdu'l-Bahá can tell us that we cannot know them directly but
only by means of their qualities. In other words, the Writings
do not think there is necessarily a disconnect between our
statements and reality, though, of course, there might be in
some specific instances of error.

Accepting that the signifier refers to an exterior,
transcendental signified, means that in Derrida’s view, the
Bahá'í Writings exemplify a metaphysics of presence. Such a
metaphysics holds not only that our truth-claims are supported
and guaranteed by an external, transcendental (or in Kantian
terms, noumenal) object, situation, relationship or process but

also that language can make such truth present to us. The desire
to have language make the truth present to us he calls
“logocentrism” which requires that language be an unsullied or
neutral way of reflecting reality and truth. In Derrida’s view, no
such language exists or can exist. On the basis of various
discussions in different sections of the second part of this
paper, it is virtually self-evident that the Bahá'í Writings
exemplify a metaphysics of presence and logocentrism. Here is
an example of the metaphysics of presence and logocentrism at
work:

> Above all, we expressed our conviction that the time has
> come when religious leadership must face honestly and
> without further evasion the implications of the truth that
> God is one and that, beyond all diversity of cultural
> expression and human interpretation, religion is likewise
one. 164

Implicit in this statement is the idea that there is one external
transcendental religion – which we can know through the words
of Bahá’u’lláh – ‘behind’ the enormous “diversity of cultural
expressions” that characterise world religion. To know more
about this one religion, we must rely on words, the Writings’ to
report accurately about this aspect of human affairs.

As shown above, there is no indication that the Bahá'í
Writings accept Derrida’s arguments that metaphysics of any
kind and logocentrism are forms of violence because they
recognise that human beings, in addition to being unique
individuals, also share a common essence, i.e. a “rational soul.”
`Abdu'l-Bahá recognises that we are all members of a species,165
i.e. share certain heritable characteristics that distinguish us
from other kinds of beings, i.e. an essence. The concept of an
‘species,’ ‘kind’ or “degree of existence” is also at work in the
following statement by `Abdu'l-Bahá:

> As the degrees of existence are different and various, some
> beings are higher in the scale than others ... some creatures
> are chosen for the highest degree, as man, and some others
> are placed in the middle degree, as the vegetable, and some
are left in the lowest degree, like the mineral.”166

No doubt, deconstructionists would see such a hierarchy as
an example of privileging and seek to apply their methods to
destabilize and subvert an allegedly oppressive ontology. From a
Bahá'í perspective, `Abdu'l-Bahá’s statement simply recognises
the way God has created the phenomenal world which has been

given to us and must be accepted as such. Furthermore, from
the viewpoint of the Writings, Derrida’s doctrine about the
supposedly oppressive nature of logocentrism and the
metaphysics of presence goes too far in privileging difference,
heterogeneity and the individual i.e. is excessively ‘antinomian’,
i.e. too willing to allow each thing to be sui generis, a kind and
law unto itself. This is not to say that the Writings downplay
heterogeneity and difference:

> As the proof of uniqueness exists in all things, and the
> Oneness and Unity of God is apparent in the reality of all
> things, the repetition of the same appearance is absolutely
> impossible.167

Differences are real, but so are commonalities or essences: our
goal is not to privilege one or the other but to apply them
appropriately and in a balanced manner. In social/political
terms we must maintain a middle course between a potentially
anarchic antinomianism and an oppressive totalitarianism that
fails to recognise individual difference.

17\. Foucault an d the Bahá'í Writings

Foucault’s rejection of “grand narratives” i.e. “the theme and
possibility of a total history”168 puts him seriously at odds with
the Bahá'í Writings in which the concept of progressive
revelation is foundational. We have dealt with this before and
need not discuss it again in detail. Let it suffice to point out
that because revelation is progressive from one dispensation to
the next, there is also some continuity between dispensations,
or, to use Foucault’s term, between ‘epistemes.’ This is clear in
Shoghi Effendi’s statement that in each new dispensation, the
Manifestation “restates the eternal verities they [the preceding
dispensations] enshrine,”169 i.e. “restates their fundamentals”170
in order to ensure continuity of between different
dispensations. Elsewhere he says, the different dispensations are
“identical in their aims ...[and] continuous in their purpose,”171
thereby re-emphasising the theme of continuity between
dispensations of epistemes. Such emphasis is wholly in conflict
with Foucault’s “caesuralism,” his focus on “discontinuity,”172
between historical epistemes, on the “divisions, limits,
differences of level, shifts”173 from one to the other. In
Foucault’s view, we must “renounce all those themes whose
function is to ensure infinite continuity of discourse.”174

The Bahá'í Writings recognition of historical continuities
between dispensations of epistemes undermines Foucault’s

project of emphasising the ‘caesuras’ or breaks in order to
ensure that each is treated as a completely unique and
heterogeneous. Like Lyotard and Derrida, he sees grand
universal themes and continuities (or grand all encompassing
universal concepts) as threats to individuality and diversity.

The Bahá'í Writings reject this unbalanced, one-sided view of
history and accept the presence of both continuities and
discontinuities as humankind evolves. Re-iterating the
fundamentals ensures continuity and the emphasis on progress
ensures change, discontinuity and new developments. As Shoghi
Effendi says,

> in accordance with the principle of progressive revelation
> every Manifestation of God must needs vouchsafe to the
> peoples of His day a measure of divine guidance ampler
> than any which a preceding and less receptive age could
have received or appreciated.175

Thus, we have a gradual building process or progress as we
evolve through various conditions and various dispensations or
epistemes. Our progress and knowledge is accumulative across
differing epistemes thereby improving our understanding of
ourselves and the world. Foucault, of course, sees no progress
from one episteme to another, but only succession. His one-
sided view of history, his rejection of continuity and progress
brings him into conflict with the Bahá'í belief that human
history shows and erratic but persistent evolution towards the
unification of humankind into a global commonwealth as seen
in `Abdu'l-Bahá’s talk about unity in the “political realm ...
unity of thought in world undertakings ... unity in freedom
....unity in religion ... unity of nations ....unity of races ....[and]
unity of language.”176 This means that the Bahá'í Writings see
history as teleological or goal-oriented, shaped by a final cause,
whereas Foucault, by virtue of his emphasis on discontinuity
and his denial of progress does not.

The Bahá'í Writings have other difficulties with Foucault’s
views on history. First, it bears pointing out specifically that
the progressive nature of science through various epistemes is
regarded as highly problematical for Foucault’s theory.177
Second, while the Writings do not deny that chance and human
failings play a role in history – which is what Foucault wants to
stress – these factors are not able to derail material and spiritual
progress that marks human evolution. Third, the Bahá'í
Writings can agree that historical knowledge is perspectival, but
must do so with serious qualifications. Most obvious is the fact

that the perspective of the Manifestation, His appointed
successors and interpreters and the Universal House of Justice
have a privileged perspective on history and this provides us
with an Archimedean point from which to evaluate and judge
other perspectives by their degree of harmony with Bahá'u'lláh’s
revelation. Thus, many viewpoints are possible but whatever
one we choose, must harmonize with or at least not conflict
with what the Writings state. Finally, the Writings disagree with
Foucault’s tendency to explain cultural and historical events
exclusively in terms of the lowest common denominator, i.e. in
terms of what the Writings call man’s “animal nature.”178
Recognising the importance of our animal propensities, as well
as the importance of seemingly insignificant events is not, in
itself at odds with the Bahá'í Writings. Indeed, the Báb’s prayer
that “All are His servants and all abide by His Bidding”179 can be
understood in this context to mean that insignificant, shameful
or even hostile acts will ultimately work for the goal of history,
the eventual unification of humankind. However, such
explanations too easily become reductionistic insofar as they
ignore or denigrate humankind’s higher motives and “spiritual
susceptibilities”180 which also have their role in the unfolding of
history. In other words, whereas the Writings do not deny that
people sometimes act on the basis of their “animal nature,” they
disagree that human beings can be accurately presented solely in
that light.

This last issue is important because it sheds light on a
significant difference between the philosophical anthropology
or theory of man found in the Bahá'í Writings and in Foucault.
In the Bahá'í view, humankind has a dual nature, being both
animal and spiritual: “man is dual in aspect: as an animal he is
subject to nature, but in his spiritual or conscious being he
transcends the world of material existence.”181 Through this
spiritual nature we are able to recognise the existence of
transcendental realities like God and the soul and orient our
lives towards them while our animal nature remains imprisoned
in the material world. Furthermore, man’s true vocation, his
destiny is to transcend the physical world, to seek more than
material knowledge182 and pursue his evolution in the spiritual
plane after his material demise. However, Foucault shows no
awareness of man’s spiritual aspect; it plays no role in his
archaeological and genealogical analyses and explanations of
history or human nature other than as a man-made construct in
a particular episteme. The reason for this is programmatic
unwillingness to probe ‘beneath’ the images generated by our
epistemes in order to identify their transcendental objects.

He writes, “We shall not return to the state anterior to
discourse,”183 meaning that he will not look beyond the
discourse of signifiers generated by an episteme to some
external or transcendental signified.

By refusing to return to “state anterior to discourse,” i.e. to
an external, transcendental object, Foucault, like Derrida,
conflates epistemology and ontology; he refuses to recognize a
transcendental signifier beyond the signifier. Things
ontologically are as we know them, no more and no less; what
we ‘see’ is what there is, and nothing more The Writings, of
course, disagree:

> There was a time when they [the realities of things] were
> unknown, preserved mysteries and hidden secrets; the
> rational soul gradually discovered them and brought them
> out from the plane of the invisible and the hidden into the
realm of the visible.184

Admitting that things have “hidden secrets” and unknown
natures means that the signified is not identical to the signifier,
that what a thing is – its ontology – is not limited to what we
know about it – our epistemology. In other words, there is an
external, transcendental signified separate from the discourse
we use about things. This also implies that the subjective
knower is distinct from what is known, i.e. the object of
knowledge and, thereby, reinforces the subject-object
distinction. In addition, the object is not dependent on the
subjective knower. For Foucault this is problematic. As James
Williams says, “Foucault is critical of this ambiguous
transcendence of subject and the system, where the subject is
both outside the causality and totality of the system, yet
capable of acting within it.”185 Given this transcendence, the
knower is able to evaluate his or her own knowledge in regards
to accuracy and adequacy to the object and refine and modify
her ideas or even overthrow them completely. That is how
progress occurs. For Foucault, however, this is not possible
since the knower constitutes the object and, therefore, has
nothing – no anterior nature or essence – to compare it against.

For the Bahá'í Writings, Foucault’s position is especially
unacceptable that God, the “Self-Subsistent” is in any
whatsoever dependent on human perception and construction.
Certainly, people and societies form images of God in their own
minds, but these do not constitute God Himself or God’s
Essence in any way. These images or idols have absolutely no
affect on God’s ontological nature. In contrast, Foucault’s

position involves a strange reversal: if God’s nature is
constituted by man, then, because of the conflation between
epistemology and ontology, we could say that, in effect, man is
the creator of God. This, of course, would reverse the
relationship between the dependent and the independent,
between the contingent and the necessary, between the
immanent (us) and the transcendent (God) and the time-bound
and the timeless. Finally, we note that the rejection of
transcendence in all its forms, leads to a ‘one-dimensional’
world picture, a ‘flatland’ in which only the immanent is real.
This is unacceptable to the Writings because man’s essence is his
spiritual not his immanent material nature.

It is self-evident that Foucault’s position on epistemes leads
to relativism. Each episteme is completely independent of all
others, and, whatever beliefs and values it has, cannot be judged
by others. However, as we have already seen in previous
discussions, the belief in the discovery of truth, in progressive
accumulation and improvement of knowledge as well as belief
in a universal human nature make such relativism unacceptable
to the Writings. It might, of course, be argued that the Bahá'í
Writings themselves adopt an epistemological relativism, as
Shoghi Effendi seems to do when he says that “religious truth is
not absolute but relative.”186 However, to understand what
Shoghi Effendi means we must look at the entire context of this
quote, namely the subject of progressive revelation in which the
essential “eternal verities”187 remain while the man-made
doctrines and errors are removed and/or changed.

> He [Bahá'u'lláh] insists on the unqualified recognition of
> the unity of their purpose, restates the eternal verities they
> enshrine, coordinates their functions, distinguishes the
> essential and the authentic from the nonessential and
> spurious in their teachings, separates the God-given truths
> from the priest-prompted superstitions.188

It is the man-made additions and doctrines that are relative
and change not the “eternal verities” which are continuous
through successive dispensations and universally valid for all
human beings. Moreover, we must not forget that according to
the Wrings, the Manifestation and His authorized interpreters
provide the absolute standard, the Archimendean standpoint
from which all other views may be evaluated and judged.
Perspectives are to be judged by their degree of harmonization
with what the Manifestation reveals. As we have seen before,
the Manifestation provides us with the means to distinguish
truth from error, science from superstition, moral from

immoral and fact from fiction. From this it becomes clear that
Foucault’s relativism is incompatible with the Bahá'í Writings
on the issue of relativism.

The Bahá'í Writings contradict Foucault’s view of reason
insofar as they believe that reason can actually provide
objectively and universally true knowledge. Foucault, of course,
does not trust reason to deliver true knowledge. According to
Best and Kellner, “His concept of ‘power/knowledge’ is
symptomatic of the postmodern suspicion of reason and the
emancipatory schemes advanced in its name.”189 The following
quote from `Abdu'l-Bahá makes clear the great difference
between Foucault’s views and the Writings’: “God has created
man in order that he may perceive the verity of existence and
endowed him with mind or reason to discover truth.”190 This
does, not, of course, mean that in the Bahá'í view reason as a
perfect and flawless instrument for, as we have seen, it is not;
however, it is good enough to be made a criterion for
evaluating both religion and science as evident in the following
quotation:

> true science is reason and reality, and religion is essentially
> reality and pure reason; therefore, the two must
> correspond. Religious teaching which is at variance with
> science and reason is human invention and imagination
> unworthy of acceptance.191

At the very least, reason can bring us closer to the truth of
things and, since truth is one,192 this truth is, at least potentially,
universal, i.e. valid across all epistemes. For Foucault the idea of
universal truths is untenable because each episteme has its own
rules about reason and truth and, therefore, judgments across
differing epistemes are not allowable.

In regards to the subject of truth and power, the difference
between Foucault and the Writings is that Writings do not
agree that any and all truth claims are necessarily expressions of
the will-to-power and part of a “regime[] of power”193 seeking
to dominate its rivals merely for the sake of power. As Foucault
says, knowledge “creates a progressive enslavement to its
instinctive violence.”194 Like Derrida, Foucault thinks that
knowledge is innately violent because it subordinates individual
heterogeneity to generalizations and universal concepts, and
because each truth-claim is actually a power-claim advanced
against all other truth/power claims. This free-for-all struggle
for domination among truth-claims is inevitable because there is
no standard by which to evaluate and judge them. This inability

to distinguish true from false or partially true is, of course, an
unavoidable consequence of relativism which lacks a
transcendental Archimedean standpoint from which to judge
competing truth-claims. Truth-claims thus become mere
assertions of preference and/or will. In short, epistemology is
reduced to power-politics. However, the Bahá'í Writings do not
envisage such a reduction because the quest for truth and
knowledge is not seen as being inherently political in nature but
rather as quest to know and to understand God’s creation. This
attitude is made clear by `Abdu'l-Bahá:

> All blessings are divine in origin, but none can be
> compared with this power of intellectual investigation and
> research, which is an eternal gift producing fruits of
> unending delight ... In fact, science may be likened to a
> mirror wherein the infinite forms and images of existing
> things are revealed and reflected. It is the very foundation
> of all individual and national development ... Therefore,
> seek with diligent endeavor the knowledge and attainment
> of all that lies within the power of this wonderful
> bestowal.195

It bears a passing note that this passage contains `Abdu'l-
Bahá’s picture of science as a mirror, reflecting the world,
which is to say, that knowledge is not or at least not entirely a
man-made construction with no reference to anything beyond
the language system. Knowledge, in the Bahá'í view is not simply
immanent to the episteme; it has transcendental references, just
as a mirror refers beyond itself. More immediate to our purpose
is `Abdu'l-Bahá’s portrayal of knowledge as fulfilling
humankind’s “divine purpose” in our “individual and national
development.” In other words, knowledge and truth are not
centered on the acquisition and/or maintenance of power but
instead are centered on fulfilling our divinely mandated destiny,
on personal and/or collective self-actualization. The Writings
do not deny that knowledge is very useful, or that it can be mis-
used for political/power purposes; however, they do not accept
Foucault’s contention that the quest for power is an inevitable
and inherent part of seeking and conveying knowledge.

Another obvious difficulty with Foucault’s philosophy is that
it leaves the self, the human subject, more or less passive, a
helpless object of action the various “truth games” and
discourses that constitute any given episteme. What room can
there be for free action or ethical behavior under such
circumstances? As Danaher, Schirato and Webb point out,
Foucault himself became more sensitive to this problem towards

the end of his career and tried to argue that the subject can, in
fact, shape itself like a work of art or a novel.196 However, this
change does not seem to be consistent with the philosophy he
outlined in the majority of his important works in which he
successfully undercut the whole notion of the self or subject as
an agent in its own life.

The Bahá'í Writings, of course, do not agree that the self, or
subject, or soul is not a substance as Foucault claims. `Abdu'l-
Bahá’ says quite pointedly on this issue,

> Some think that the body is the substance and exists by
> itself, and that the spirit is accidental and depends upon
> the substance of the body, although, on the contrary, the
> rational soul is the substance, and the body depends upon
> it. If the accident--that is to say, the body--be destroyed,
the substance, the spirit, remains.197

Here we have the clearest possible indication that according
to the Writings, the self or subject or soul is a substance that
persists through its accidental changes and is precisely the kind
of single, unitary, independent and consistent entity posited by
Descartes and Kant. Indeed, the soul is not only a substance,
but it also possesses inherent personality from the outset, and,
therefore is not simply a construction based on an episteme.

> The personality of the rational soul is from its beginning;
> it is not due to the instrumentality of the body, but the
> state and the personality of the rational soul may be
> strengthened in this world; it will make progress and will
> attain to the degrees of perfection, or it will remain in the
> lowest abyss of ignorance, veiled and deprived from
beholding the signs of God.198

The personality is essentially transcendent to the episteme,
although the episteme can influence its future development,
strengthening some features, weakening others. Nevertheless,
we must always bear in mind that despite these changes, the
soul’s essential, universal attributes remain the same: it is, as we
have already seen, rational, it has “spiritual susceptibilities,” it
is immortal, it has free will in matters of morality, it is not
bound by time and space, it has powers of infinite growth, it
can discover the ‘realities’ of things, and it has powers that
make it superior to phenomenal nature. Thus, the Bahá'í
Writings do not deny that the self is influenced by its socio-
historical surroundings, but they preserve the free agency of the
self by drawing attention to its power to choose the better way.

Nor do they deny that the self can relate to itself in different
ways while performing different actions, but the essential
nature of the self underneath these changes remains constant.
Such constancy is incompatible with Foucault’s concept of the
self.

18\. Richar d Rorty and the Bahá'í Writings

When we examine Rorty’s postmodernism, we find that it has
virtually nothing in common with the Bahá'í Writings on any
major issues. In the first place, the Writings clearly accept
representationalism       whereas      Rorty      rejects     it.199
Representationalism, as we recall, is the belief that language
does not just refer to itself but also makes verifiable statements
about an external reality. In other words, language involves a
signifier referring to an external signified, or, is like a mirror
reflecting a transcendental signified beyond itself. Adherence to
representationalism is clearly evident in `Abdu'l-Bahá’s
statements that “Science may be likened to a mirror wherein the
images of the mysteries of outer phenomena are reflected,”200
and that “science may be likened to a mirror wherein the infinite
forms and images of existing things are revealed and
reflected.”201

If language did not allow us to reflect reality adequately, we
could not form theories or scientific propositions that inform
us about reality with some degree of accuracy and, therefore,
could not speak of the “progress science and knowledge have
made.”202 We could not speak of such “progress” because our
theories and/or propositions would not tell us anything about
reality, and therefore, we could not know if we had made any
progress by improving theories, i.e. making theories more
accurate reflections of reality. We could not even discard false
theories, because knowing that a theory is false implies that we
already have a better way of understanding reality. In addition,
if we reject representationalism we also find ourselves
perpetually trapped in a prison of language and linguistic
constructs that makes reality – if it even exists – inaccessible.
Just as in Kant’s philosophy, we are permanently enclosed in the
phenomenal      realm,    so     in   Rorty’s     rejection    of
representationalism, we are perpetually confined within
conversations that refer to nothing other than themselves:
sentences, he says, are only “connected with other sentences
rather than with the world.”203 He is satisfied with this
situation.

An idea closely associated with representationalism is that,
that reason can provide us genuine knowledge about reality. By
means of reason we can develop theories and propositions that
are capable of discovering truths, i.e. reflecting reality: “He
[God] has endowed him [man] with mind, or the faculty of
reasoning, by the exercise of which he is to investigate and
discover the truth, and that which he finds real and true he must
accept.”204 The very purpose of reason is the discovery of truth:
“God has created man in order that he may perceive the verity
of existence and endowed him with mind or reason to discover
truth.”205 Reason, if properly applied, can reflect the truth
about reality, or put otherwise, can correspond to reality. For
his part, Rorty thinks that reason is a faculty that “can now be
dispensed with – and should be dispensed with”206 because it
cannot tell us anything about the real world since sentences are
only connected to other sentences. This is not something to
which the Writings can agree. Nor can they agree to Rorty’s
proposal that instead of pursing knowledge, “we just might be
saying something”207 simply in order to “keep the conversation
going rather than to find objective truth.”208 This, for Rorty is
“a sufficient aim of philosophy.”209 In effect, for Rorty,
philosophy and science are no longer interested in attaining
truth.210 This is completely incompatible with `Abdu'l-Bahá’s
statement that “It is, therefore, clear that in order to make any
progress in the search after truth we must relinquish
superstition.”211 From Rorty’s viewpoint, we might want to
cling to the superstition simply because it keeps the
conversation alive.

One additional consequence of representationalism is that
the Writings, unlike Rorty, accept realism, the belief that reality
is what it is independent of human observation. At this point a
clarification is in order: the Writings espouse realism in regards
to original or ‘first nature’, the universe as created by God, the
universe which depends for its inherent essence and attributes
on God, not humankind. Of course, the Writings recognise that
human creations like societies, laws and customs traditionally
known as ‘second nature,’ depend on us, at least to a certain
extent. However, the arguments surrounding philosophical
‘realism’ are focussed on the issue of whether or not original
nature depends on us in any way, as for example Kant says it
does. The Bahá'í Writings clearly do not accept the Kantian
notion – or postmodern variations of it – that humankind
constitutes original nature and its laws. These natural laws are
discovered and not constituted by us.212

Since, for Rorty, sentences can only refer to other sentences
and not to reality, it follows that he is incapable of recognising
the existence of essences. On his premises, how could we
possibly know about them since our sentences or propositions
cannot mirror reality? Therefore, they must be linguistic
constructs of some kind, products of conversation. The
Writings, of course, assert the reality of essences of things, and
even of God213 and even provide guidance in we can and cannot
come to know essences:

> Know that there are two kinds of knowledge: the
> knowledge of the essence of a thing and the knowledge of
> its qualities. The essence of a thing is known through its
qualities; otherwise, it is unknown and hidden.214

Just as Rorty denies the existence of essences, Rorty
emphatically rejects the notion of a “core self,”215 an essential
self, a ‘true’ self that somehow endures which remains what it is
independent of changes in one’s beliefs and desires.216 This so-
called ‘self’ is a fiction created by language.217 He tells us that
““there is no self distinct from this self-reweaving web”218 of
muscles, movements, beliefs and states of mind, i.e. no core
substantial independently existing entity. Rorty adds that we
should “avoid the self-deception of thinking that we possess a
deep, hidden, metaphysically significant nature which makes us
‘irreducibly’ different from inkwells or atoms,”219 meaning that
the self is a natural product like anything else. The Writings, of
course reject this view and assert that the “rational soul is the
substance and the body depends on it”220 and, unlike all other
things, can exist independently of the body after death. This
idea of the soul’s existence as an independently existing
substance is re-enforced when `Abdu'l-Bahá says that “the
personality of the rational soul is from its beginning; it is not
due to the instrumentality of the body.”221 If the personality is
“from its beginning”, it is obviously not dependent on our
physical self-construction or ‘reweaving’ to use Rorty’s term,
and, therefore, exists as a real entity.

In contradiction to Rorty and the postmodernists, the Bahá'í
Writings advocate foundationalism, i.e. the belief that there are
certain propositions, principles and/or knowledge and truths
which are non-inferential i.e. not dependent on other
justifications and are self-evident, i.e. cannot be denied without
falling into self-contradiction or into denying self-evident
empirical experience. For example, `Abdu'l-Bahá recognises that
God is “the self-evident Reality”222 and expresses shock that
educated academics cannot see this. Moreover, “[i]t is a self-

evident truth that all humanity is the creation of God. All are
His servants and under His protection. All are recipients of His
bestowals,223 and “[I]t is a self-evident fact that phenomenal
existence can never grasp nor comprehend the ancient and
essential Reality.”224 A final example of truths that are
foundational in the Writings:

> It is self-evident that the human spirit is simple, single and
> not composed in order that it may come to immortality,
> and it is a philosophical axiom that the individual or
indivisible atom is indestructible.225

The Writings probably accept foundationalism because all
thinking – including anti-foundationalism – requires certain
premises, assumptions and axioms to work. The notion that
anyone’s thinking let alone a philosophical position can be
genuinely anti-foundational is a self-contradictory willow-the-
wisp. At the very least it would require the assumption that
there exist foundational arguments since if no such arguments
existed, anti-foundationalism would lose its reason for being. In
addition to being foundational, the Writings also endorse
metaphysics, i.e. “the investigation of the nature, constitution,
and structure of reality”226 and are replete with examples of
metaphysical analysis:

> Nature is that condition, that reality, which in appearance
> consists in life and death, or, in other words, in the
> composition and decomposition of all things.
> This Nature is subjected to an absolute organization, to
> determined laws, to a complete order and a finished design
> from which it will never depart ... But when you look at
Nature itself, you see that it has no intelligence, no will.227

These are patently assertions about how nature actually is, its
mode of existing and its limitations i.e. they deal with the
nature and structure of reality. In Rorty’s view, such statements
are impossible and, therefore, patent nonsense.

Another significant difference between Rorty and the Bahá'í
Writings is Rorty’s adherence to relativism, as illustrated by his
remark that ironists like himself “do not hope to have their
doubts about their final vocabularies settled by something
larger than themselves.”228 In other words, he does not look to a
God – or a transcendental, Archimedean standpoint to resolve
his philosophical issues and conflicts. Rejecting one or both of
these makes Rorty – his strenuous denials notwithstanding – a
relativist since that leaves no way of adjudicating among

conflicting viewpoints. To prove that he does not think all
views are equally good, he asserts that a pragmatist like himself
“thinks his views are better than the ‘realists,’ but he does not
think his views correspond to the nature of things.”229 Basically,
he thinks his views are better because he is a “liberal” and,
therefore, “more afraid of being cruel than anything else.”230 It
is difficult to take his claim that he is not a relativist at face
value. Given his belief that statements cannot correspond to
reality (and, therefore cannot be tested by reality), that
rationality is simply a local cultural bias without general validity
and that truth itself is a chimera, on what ground other than
sheer dogmatic assertion can he claim that his philosophy is
better? (Unless of course he relies on revelation which he does
not.) If language games are incommensurable, if there is no
rational or empirical way of ‘proving’ one view or another, then
the alleged superiority of one view comes down to a dogmatic
assertion of preference, i.e. of Nietzsche’s will-to-power. In the
last analysis Rorty’s liberalism has nothing more than his
preference to recommend it. Ironically, it is precisely such
dogmatic assertion that his much recommended edifying
conversation is supposed to replace. Judged by his own
standards, Rorty’s views exemplify a thorough-going, i.e.
radical relativism both in epistemology and ethics. The Bahá'í
Writings, will certainly agree about the value of avoiding
cruelty, but they cannot agree that the desire to avoid cruelty is
based on nothing more than personal whim and preference;
instead, they see such a desire grounded in our common human
nature and the essential one-ness of humankind and the
commandments of God.

The foregoing discussion makes it clear that on virtually all
substantive and fundamental issues, the Bahá'í Writings and
Rorty’s philosophy differ. Even Rorty’s advocacy of
“solidarity” and “edifying conversation” do not really bridge the
gap between the two because the Bahá'í Dispensation wants to
achieve solidarity through the recognition of certain
foundational truths such as the existence of God or the essential
one-ness of humankind. It does not think solidarity can be built
on mere ‘political considerations’ in the politics of knowledge
or by temporarily edifying conversations. Rorty’s goals cannot
be relied upon to be the foundation for a social order because
they are merely ‘political’ and not spiritual in nature and
according to the Writings such unity does not last.231 Thus, here
too, as with other postmodern philosophers, we are forced to
conclude that despite superficial or accidental similarities, the
differences between Rorty and the Bahá'í Writings are essential

and substantial.

19\. Baudrillar d an d the Bahá'í Writings

For the most part, the Bahá'í Writings have the same kind of
difficulties with Baudrillard as they have with the other
postmodernists. There may well be agreement on individual
points, but the Writings cannot accept the fundamental
ontological and epistemological premises of Baudrillard’s work.
Given such foundational disagreement, we can only conclude
that whatever specific concurrences we may discover are
accidental and, therefore, superficial, and not essential.

Even if we choose to read Baudrillard as a sociologist
describing postmodern social phenomena and not, like the other
postmodernists we have examined, as a philosopher promoting a
certain philosophic programme we shall still have difficulty with
his analysis from a Bahá'í perspective.

The difficulties between Baudrillard and the Bahá'í Writings
begin with the conclusions he draws from the Borges short-
story, “On Exactitude in Science.” According to Baudrillard,
this story shows the implosion of intellectual categories so that
the usually accepted and clearly defined terms of our thought
cease to be distinct and meld into one another. (This is not
unlike Derrida’s subversion in which a term – such as
pharmakon or medicine – may turn into its opposite, poison.) If
the map in the story is really as large as the territory, what does
the map represent? The represented and that which represents
have become one. What is the distinction between the signified
and the signifier, between “a referential being or a
substance”?232 Other threatened binaries are cause and effect,
active and passive, subject and object and ends and means,233 as
well as true and false, real and imaginary. 234 Other untenable
distinctions include real and ideal, original and copy,
appearance and reality, and essential and nonessential.

The Bahá'í Writings do not agree that these terms are
meaningless and/or outmoded in our analysis of reality and the
human situation. Because we have touched on this subject
before, only a brief review of some of the evidence will be
necessary. They clearly distinguish between true and false as
when Bahá'u'lláh says that “the divine Purpose hath decreed that
the true should be known from the false, and the sun from the
shadow.”235 Indeed, without these distinctions, there would no
basis for an ethical teachings. As we have seen previously, the
Writings clearly accept the distinction between cause and

effect,236 real and imaginary,237 essential and accidental
(nonessential),238 signified and signifier as in the word ‘God’ and
the actual God, substance and accident,239 and subject and
object as in the perceiver and what is perceived.240 In other
words, the Writings accept as useful analytical tools precisely
those binary concepts that Baudrillard no longer finds
serviceable in his analysis of reality and postmodern society.
Quite obviously, Bahá'u'lláh and `Abdu'l-Bahá find these
concepts applicable and build on them a significant portions of
their analysis of reality, the general condition of humankind and
the condition of the contemporary world.

Furthermore, if all these essential differences simply meld, it
is impossible to be rational since rationality depends on clear
and distinct categories of thought that allow us to attain clear
and decisive answers. According to Baudrillard, “All the
referentials intermingle their discourses in a circular Moebian
compulsion,241 i.e. go around endlessly from one opposite to
another, and, thereby prevent reason from functioning. In other
words, the efficacy of reason as a way of understanding reality
is short-circuited, leaving us no further ahead than we were
without it. The Bahá'í Writings, as we have seen, do not share
this pessimistic view of the ability of reason to discover truth
about reality. According to Baudrillard, however, “truth,
reference and objective causes have ceased to exist.”242

Since “truth, reference and objective causes have ceased to
exist,” it is clear that metaphysics (which he satirizes as
“pataphysics” 243 ) is impossible. After all, metaphysics untenable
since metaphysics requires clearly identified causal relationships
in its study of the structure and nature of reality. Furthermore,
if our propositions are no longer referential and do not refer to
reality, we cannot discuss reality at all let alone decide which
propositions are true. This, too, makes metaphysics impossible
as does the view that we can no longer distinguish real from
unreal, or appearance from reality; with this situation “goes all
of metaphysics. No more mirror of being and appearance, of
the real and its concept ...” 244 However, the Writings do not
accept this view, as is quite evident from the numerous passages
of metaphysics in the Bahá'í Writings. Bahá'u'lláh and `Abdu'l-
Bahá obviously think that metaphysics is not only possible but
also, that some metaphysical understanding is necessary for our
well-being and spiritual evolution. Without some understanding
of metaphysics, how can we understand and appreciate our
spiritual nature in this world and our super-natural destiny in
the next?

Let us examine another example. The Writings do not agree
with Baudrillard’s claim that in the postmodern world “there is
no real,”245 that we live in a hyperreal world in which the
simulation constitutes reality. This is why, in his view,
Disneyland is America. While the Bahá'í Writings may accept
that for some this might be true insofar as it describes a rather
unfortunate state of mind, it is certainly not an accurate
description of how things actually are. In other words, they
question the melding of reality and simulation into a
hyperreality, and the denial of any difference between them is
simply inadequate metaphysical analysis of reality. The
materially and spiritually poor are not simulations experiencing
simulated poverty and hunger, for example, their deprivations
are very real and cannot be cured with a simulated sandwich.
The distinction between reality and the difference between it
and “vain imaginings”246 is as operative in the postmodern world
as much as it is at any other time in human history.

20\. Concl usion

As we have already noted, it is difficult to escape the general
conclusion that as far as the major exponents of post
modernism are concerned, i.e. Nietzsche, Lyotard, Derrida,
Foucault, Rorty and Baudrillard, the disagreements with the
Bahá'í Writings are foundational. There are, of course,
individual similarities and agreements, but in light of the
foundational differences we have observed in epistemology,
ontology, ethics, philosophical anthropology (theory of man)
and cultural studies, such concurrences cannot reasonably be
regarded as more than accidental and fortuitous. In our view,
this means that we cannot adhere to both the postmodern
philosophy articulated by these thinkers and to the philosophical
positions explicitly and implicitly held by the Bahá'í Writings
without losing consistency and coherence of view-point, and
without falling into difficult logical contradictions.

Given this situation, can Bahá'í scholars make use of
postmodern techniques and views in studying or creatively
interpreting the Writings? In our view, the answer is generally
negative because the foundational differences are too great to
be bridged. How, for example, can we overcome the
diametrically opposed positions on grand narratives, privileged
authors, interpreters and viewpoints, or external, transcendental
objects of signification and knowledge? The postmodern
insistence on immanence, its ‘immanentism’ (inherited from
Nietzsche) is also at odds with the Bahá'í insistence on

transcendentalism, on the reality of God, the soul and the
supernatural.247 These positions are logically reconcilable. How
could a Bahá'í scholar use Derrida in a study of the Writings
when, according to Derrida, any reading of any text can be
endlessly shown to subvert its own meaning and thereby
forestall any final reading or interpretation. Insofar as there is
no authoritative or final reading, all readings become equal.
How far can deconstruction, subversion and destabilizing texts
go? Can it go so far as to show that, Bahá'u'lláh’s statement,
“Let your vision be world-embracing, rather than confined to
your own self”248 also means its opposite, ‘Let your vision
become narrow and focussed on your own country and your
own self’? Can we apply such endless subversion to the messages
from the Universal House of Justice? Little reflection is
required to see what insurmountable difficulties this would raise
for teaching the Bahá'í Faith, explicating its teachings and
principles, defending it against critics and engaging in
meaningful inter-faith dialogue. Who, if we applied such
methods, would or could really know what the Bahá'í Faith
stood for? Consequently, this paper suggests that Bahá'í scholars
make very cautious use even of the accidental similarities with
postmodernism and ensure they do not entangle themselves in
philosophical positions that create difficulties with the
Writings.

There are two possible partial exceptions to this, Heidegger
and Baudrillard. Heidegger’s philosophy of Being has been given
theological interpretations249 that in many respects are in
harmony with the Writings. There is certainly no problem in
regards to Heidegger’s refusal to confuse Being with beings, or,
in Bahá'í terms, God with creations, either natural or our own
man-made idols. Nor is there any inherent difficulty or
insurmountable difficulty with Heidegger’s theory of truth as
aletheia, the disclosure of the Being of individual beings, or the
task of art and especially poetry as the disclosure of the Being
of beings.250

If we read Baudrillard’s work as a sociological diagnosis of
the corrupt condition of society and culture, i.e. as a
sociological description of a world in which entire societies
have been “deluded by a mere phantom which the vain
imaginations of its peoples have conceived,”251 then one might
be favourably inclined towards his analyses of the postmodern
condition. His assertion that boundaries have blurred between
the real and artificial or imaginary, true and false, cause and
effect, subject and object is not inherently opposed to the

Bahá'í Writings if we read it as an analysis of individual and
social pathology. However, if we read Baudrillard’s work as we
read Lyotard’s, Derrida’s, Foucault’s or Rorty’s i.e. as a
program that is being suggested for the analysis and exploration
of the postmodern world, then we have the same problems we
have with these other philosophers: the Bahá'í Writings accept
and make use of the numerous metaphysical categories that
Baudrillard rejects outright. In our view, the latter reading is
more justified than the former because Baudrillard nowhere
gives any sign of recognising that the postmodern view of
reality he describes is a distortion and misrepresentation of
reality as it really is, i.e. reality as described by the Bahá'í
Writings. That is why he is included in this study.
