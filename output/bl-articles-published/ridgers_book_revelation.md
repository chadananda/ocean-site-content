## The Book of Revelation Revealed in Glory: A Summary of Glorious Revelation

> **Abstract:**  
>   
> The presently titled "The Book of Revelation Revealed in Glory" interprets the Book of Revelation through a Bahá’í lens in the tradition of Ruth Moffett's _Keys to the Book of Revelation_ and Robert Riggs' _The Apocalypse Unsealed,_ and writings of Sears, Motlagh, Sours, and Tai-Seale. Its main revealed source of symbols is Bahá’u’lláh’s _Book of Certitude,_ and 'Abdu'l-Bahá's _Some Answered Questions_ and Shoghi Effendi's _God Passes By_ provide most of its specific verse interpretations of some 26% of Revelation's 393 verses at last search.  
>   
> This Bahá’í-inspired reading applies millennialist historicism and its year-day principle to interpret the Book of Revelation's prophesy of Christianity, Islam, and the Bahá’í Faith from 96 A.D. onwards. It follows the history of the progressive Faith of God over the last 1,900 years and in Jesus' native Middle East. As the last book of the New Testament it joins Christianity with Islam and the Bahá’í Faiths, as the Koran's Surat Yusuf linked Islam with the Bábí Faith in its way.  
>   
> Islam and the Bahá’í Faith both teach that prophecies have multiple meanings. Nonetheless, this particular interpretation has a format that commits writer and reader to a single best interpretation. This appears on each right page opposite a serious translation of the Greek on each left facing page. The recto page interprets every verse against the matching verso original, and provides a unique perspective of reading. The timing, meaning the verb tenses, is set to the present end of the twentieth century.  
>   
> Most important, I submit specific problems of presentation for discussion in requesting critical input. Evidently the Book of Revelation's message is meant for Christians who learn it in church and hear it in the Messiah. Therefore, while seeking Bahá’í readership, my prime pursuit is the wider goal of Christian readership. This millennial timing is good, when even Armageddon, surprisingly, seems almost over.  
>   
> Either way, how much Bahá’í matter to write remains the core presentation issue. How much Bahá’í material should explicitly appear in the introductory Prologue or concluding Epilogue, in the title and names for Bahá’u’lláh and the Báb, and in even the book title? Should ultimately two versions, one Bahá’í, one Christian, exist? Specifically, should the Greek "arnion" translate as Lamb or as Ram, and "thura" as Door or as Gate? Each version of each is legitimate, yet one speaks louder to Christians and the other is heard better by Bahá’ís. Are Glory of God and Faith of Glory adequate, since the basic Arabic-appearing Bahá’í words, in today's sensitive geopolitical climate, will likely hurt potential Christian readership in the USA? Hopefully question time can address these tricky presentation problems.

The Book of Revelation Revealed in Glory:
A Summary of Glorious Revelation

William Ridgers

man once asked God, “How long is a million years?” God replied, “By my tim in g, a minute.” Then

A      the man asked, “God, how much is a million dollars?” God replied, “For me, a penny.” Next, the

man said, “Please God, give me a penny.” So God replied, “In a minute!”
In the same way, the Book of Revelation measures days as years and years as millennia. In the 1950s,
time itself was in question where I grew up in England’s East Anglia under the shadow of the
Armageddon. Nuclear holocaust ever loomed large, with England a lot closer than the USA to the USSR!
There, I grew up under two sets of shields connected with the Book of Revelation. The first set of
heraldic school chapel shields, showing its four Living Beings, was mundane enough. But the second set
was nuclear. At Polebrook village, three miles from school, some hundred rockets planted in a field
pointed eastwards. Their direction varied with the latest cold war crisis—sometimes Moscow, sometimes
Odessa or Leningrad, we guessed. Later I studied medicine at Cambridge University only fourteen miles
from the USAF-RAF Alconbury base that housed the planet’s biggest arsenal of nuclear bombs, with
plans and planes to deliver them.

Today, however, the Book of Revelation marks a millennial end to this bloody century and ushers in a
warless Millennium. Swift, awesome, material progress, which flew warplanes and a im ed missiles in our
own lifetimes, can now conquer causes of war and stop it wasting lives and resources. History will cele-
brate how human awareness awoke from this unique twentieth century of both discovery and warfare, and
converted swords into plowshares. Therefore, this millennial moment of the end of the twentieth centu-
ry is timely for revisiting St. John’s vision of global unity. Glorious Revelation grasps 2000 AD as a con-
venient cusp of history for its accurate interpretation of the Book of Revelation of St. John. Glorious
Revelation pr im ar ily sets out to bring its moving meaning to readers to a broadly traditional Christian
readership. While Glorious Revelation is based as fully as possible on the revealed Bahá’í sources, its
intent, nonetheless, is mainly to benefit the non-converted, rather than preach to the converted.

These Bahá’í sources credibly interpret the two main time prophecies of the Book of Revelation. This
is to their credit, for timing is the key to prophecy. The first time prophecy, 391 years, interprets as the
period running from 1453 AD through 1844 AD, and the second time prophecy of 1,260 years interprets
to end in 1844 AD as well. These specific dates form the time base of interpretation for all the events
coursing through the palace of the Book of Revelation. St. John’s compelling tale of an evolving Law (or
Religion) of God echoes though the rooms and passages of “Revelation palace,” playing out from 95 AD
to unite the Faiths. Glorious Revelation turns its prophetic pages to reveal it as a pre-h is tory of the Faiths
advancing the Law of God, the Religion of God, since 95 AD. Nor is it by chance that the Book of
Revelation is the Bible’s most united book. As the highway bridges of US-1 link the Florida Keys, so the
Book of Revelation connects monotheistic faiths, and focuses specifically on the three most recent. The
first faith was Christianity, while the next two faiths came into being after the time of St. John.

The Bahá’í sources reveal, in piecemeal fashion, both many symbols of the Book of Revelation, and
of its 394 verse total, an additional core 15% that repetition expands to 30%. The good news is that the
long-awaited golden Millennium of the Book of Revelation coincides closely with our new millennium.
In particular, the events prophesied by Chapters 1–16 are over. They already took place from 95 AD
through 2000 AD. This includes the afflictions of Chapters 15 and 16 and even the last worst affliction

of Armageddon that began in the nineteenth century, next exploded in 1914 AD, then continued as war-
fare and cold war across the globe throughout the now ended twentieth century. You can hear the pass-
ing of Armageddon in Chapter 16, watch the collapse and recovery of the Greatest Depression in
Chapters 17–19, and relish the blossoming golden Millennium in Chapters 20–2 2.

Inspired by these newly-revealed interpretations, I began writing Glorious Revelation in 1995 as a per-
sonal retirement plan for a year at most. After all, the readily accessible newly-revealed writings insert
the patches of color and edge-pieces of the jigsaw puzzle of the mosaic floor of “Revelation palace.” All
I had to do was identify the best version of the Book of Revelation ava il able—many translations exist—
and complete a parallel interpretation based on these revealed interpretations. But this was not to be.
Ultimately, the very power of the interpretations themselves clarified translation of many tough, tricky
Greek words and phrases too effectively to be ignored. So I had to learn Koine Greek and translate the
Greek of the Book of Revelation myself. Fortunately its Koine street Greek lies somewhere between my
proficient school Latin of five years and my fluent Hebrew from living eight years in Israel. Both my
translation and interpretation strictly honored the warning against change of the Book of Revelation’s
verses 22:18–19.

As a result, the challenge of Glorious Revelation steadily grew to keep me fascinated, continually
clicking at the keyboard into the early hours. Translating and interpreting formed a continual, creative,
instructive feedback loop. The actual interpretation I began by first faithfully inserting the newly
revealed symbols and verses. Thus the landscape of Glorious Revelation’s jigsaw puzzle shines its sym-
bols in the leafy greens of forests, the rippling blues of lakes, and the masonry browns of build in gs, and
its 30% revealed verses as edge-pieces and bridges between its landscaped regions. Subsequently, stead il y
pursuing the clues cast by St. John like lines and hooks throughout the crossword of his Book of
Revelation, and applying sensitive logic connected interpretive jigsaw pieces and the closed gaps, step by
step. Here and there, a rare flash of personal inspiration helped interpretation too. Now Glorious
Revelation’s mosaic jigsaw puzzle extends as the floor of the palace of Revelation through all of its twen-
ty-two chapter rooms.

St. John has kept readers of his Book of Revelation guessing for two millennia and has safeguarded its
prophetic events. Its light of cloaked truth has continued to burn through spiritually dark ages. The
Bahá’í sources name St. John as the author of the Book of Revelation, presumably as the apostle who
wrote the Gospel in rather different Greek. It was he who, as bishop at Ephesus, was deported to Patmos
Island as late as 95 AD at the age of ninety years, accompanied by his young disciple Prochorus. They
lived in a particular cave across whose mouth the vision of St. John appeared, and from whose wall its
voices spoke.

The different Greek of St. John’s Gospel and Book of Revelation can be medically explained by his
brain aging in the interim, and by their very different subject matters. He published his Gospel as a log-
ical young man to record the life and teachings of Jesus. In contrast, he dictated his Book of Revelation
about the sights and sounds of his out-of-body vision at the age of ninety years. His brain surface pro-
cessing language and logic had almost certainly shrunken, while more resilient deeper nerve cells and
fibers could still formulate the emotive language for the sights, sounds, and feelings of his vision. Such
change in his brain would mean his thinking language had probably regressed back to his native Aramaic
and religious Hebrew. This would explain his quick-speak condensed Semitic Greek in the Book of
Revelation. Perhaps he dictated the sights and sounds of his vision real-time to Prochorus in Aramaic or
Hebrew, and he wrote it down in Koine Greek as fast as he could, joining 74% of its phrases with “and,”
the ubiquitous conjunction Kai.

Shrewd St. John would relish the result—a Semitic stew cooked in a spicy pot of street Greek—as use-
ful fate that keep his readers fascinated and guessing. Just translating, not even interpreting, lets him
laugh you along and challenge you with his odd riddles, peppery puns, tantalizing tenses, and discern-
ing word order. You discover his literary crossword codes that he cast as lines and hooks to connect twen-
ty-two chapters in a web of discovery. In the process, your taste for this old wise prophet grows and deep-
ening rapport with him helps you tease out his methods, mean in gs, and messages.

In childhood I always had to know the truth, however pa in ful, which probably helped me study med-
icine, garner degrees, and pursue a fulfilling career in intensive care. Yet over the years I needed to find
higher spiritual truths to balance the logic and art of medicine. In this regard, religious prophecies ful-
filled over millennia, or even just centuries, held me in awe. Then, learning about its new interpreta-
tions, the Book of Revelation, this mother of prophecy, drew me along its spiritual path. These Bahá’í
sources open its palace gate and introduce its Angel messenger of the first chapter room. He greets and
escorts us through the rest of “Revelation palace,” through his seven Faiths of Chapters 2 and 3, his
throne-room of Chapter 4 with its courtiers, and into his library of Chapter 5 to meet the Ram. Next,
we read histories and hear heralds in its East wing of Chapters 6 through 10. Then we reach its great cen-
tral hall of Chapter 11, from where the brilliant seven-fold light of 1844 AD illum in ates its whole palace.
There we witness a fresh execution of the Ram of Jesus. Subsequently, we pass on through troubled
Muslim histories and afflictions, including Armageddon, in its West wing of Chapters 12 through 16.
The seal histories, trumpet herald angels, and bowl afflictions act out in sets of seven in Chapters 6, 10,
and 15, and recall the riddle of St. Ives: “As I was going to St. Ives, I met a man with seven wives. Each
wife had seven sacks, each sack had seven cats, and each cat had seven kittens. How many were going to
St. Ives?” The answer “One” is the poser of the riddle, here is the Angel of the Glory of God of Chapter
1 who reappears in many guises through the remaining Chapters.

Brevity is blessed, and to this end the direct parallel layout of Glorious Revelation presents a concise
best interpretation as its single united agenda. Verso (left-side) pages first secure the translation of the
original Book of Revelation of St. John, then the facing recto (right-side) pages display its matching inter-
pretation. This parallel recto interpretation matches St. John’s verso original—paragraph by paragraph,
verse by verse, phrase by phrase, conjunction by conjunction, and even comma by comma. The inter-
pretation’s length and phrase order remain close to the original. It is written to be read from recto page
to recto page, with the facing verso original opposite and ready as the authoritative source reference,
even for readers who know the Book of Revelation. Further, this layout creates a built-in glossary of sym-
bols accessible via the Index. Of necessity, chapters start unconventionally on verso pages. In addition,
the interpretation tenses are set to 1995 and stagger time across the nineteen centuries of the Book of
Revelation from its 95 AD publication year to its nineteenth centennial year, 1995 AD. This literary device
drives the interpretation in vivid real time, distinguishes the interpretation even more from the origi-
nal, and generates useful dialectic tension that catalyzed interpretation.

This translation of the original Book of Revelation diligently reviewed, compared, and revised previ-
ous translations based on Majority, Receptus and Critical Texts.1,2,3,4,5,6,7 The most exhaustive, Aune’s three-
volume work,8 was invaluable, as was the concise Barclay Newman dictionary listing mean in gs by fre-
quency of usage.9 The limited vocabulary of the Book of Revelation’s street (Koine or Common) Greek
is like both quick-speak blunt Cockney English and the first Basic English vocabulary of the minimum
of eight hundred words needed to define all words in a standard Oxford dictionary, that even renders
Shakespeare quite well. The very limited vocabulary of street Greek has inherent inspirational depth. In
addition, the act of translation strives for harmonious loyalty to both the Greek original and modern
English meaning. For example, the literal “his voice was like a sound of many waters” renders as “his
voice rushed like a waterfall.” Certain liberties kept a few sentences brief, for example, by changing a
mid-sentence “say in g” to an opening “They said,” or a “so that” to a “So....” And that wonderful wild-
card conjunction, Kai, opening 74% of the Book of Revelation’s verses, generated a wealth of legitimate
mean in g. For Kai may stand as an introductory And, or simply breathe silence ahead of a new sentence,
or translate from a wide range of English conjunctions.8≤ Regardless of all this, the notorious street
Koine Greek of the Book of Revelation is tough to translate. Indeed, one eminent translator privately
admits that even he has often wavered over a word.

Inevitably, translations of the Book of Revelation are biased, usually conspicuously. Certainly,
Glorious Revelation is. But its bias derives from source interpretations that prove themselves by marked-
ly easing the translation of its fifty-odd tough, tricky Greek words and phrases that have tested transla-
tors and translations for nineteen centuries. Extensive footnotes detail many of them. The resulting
translation is far closer to the original Greek than others. This very easing of translation boosts the cred-

ibility of the Bahá’í sources guiding it. A te ll ing example is the phrase found in verse 10:7, “God pro-
claimed his servant prophets,” indicating that God’s proclamation was his prophet Manifestations them-
selves. But check any Bible and you will read, “God proclaimed to his servant prophets,” inserting a
notional “to” before the word “prophets.” Yet creating this non-existent dative case proves inaccurate and
unnecessary.

Mean in gs of prophecy vary, yet its song sings eternal. For the main purpose of prophecy is spiritual—
which should be no surprise. Spiritual writings agree: “We speak one word and by it intend one and sev-
enty meanings,”10 and “This is one of the mean in gs of the biblical story...reflect until you discover the
others.”11 You can thus interpret the single spiritual principle of a prophetic vision as separate valid his-
tories recurring in different times and diverse places, all with the same spiritual purpose.12 This concept
transforms the popular notion that you can interpret prophecy “any way you want” to another pl an e.
Indeed, over nineteen centuries, the multiple interpretations of the quintessential Book of Revelation
have generated a whole classification of prophetic interpretation into historicist, preterist, fut ur is t, spir-
itual, and now revealed categories. Glorious Revelation falls into, nay defines, the revealed category of
interpretation by the Bahá’í sources, yet still projects its interpretations through historicist and futurist
lenses.

Thus the beast of the Book of Revelation spiritually symbolizes beastly rulers and regimes. Through
their own prophetic lens, Christians tend to view this beast as the Roman Empire persecuting
Christianity. While though the lens of the later Faiths of Glorious Revelation, this same beast looms as
the Umayyad Empire. Just as the Roman Empire once plagued Christianity, so, six centuries later, the
Umayyad Empire plagued initially virtuous Islam. Lens by lens, prophecy’s spiritual telescope focuses on
various valid interpretations. Its red lens may portray first-century Rome while its green lens displays
seventh-century Arabia. Its beast dons period costumes from two eras and areas, one Roman marching
uniform, the other Umayyad cavalry colors. Functionally, the dining room of “Revelation palace” lets you
meet as well as eat, and its library lets you daydream as well as read. In this same context, Christians
typically interpret the seven congregations of Chapters 1, 2, and 3 as specific congregations where they
were and also as the whole Church in general. These two harmonious layers of interpretations are free
of contradiction. Here, adding a third harmonious layer that interprets for and welcomes these congre-
gations also as the religious faiths that they are, remains free of contradiction.

Yet, in spite of the validity of multiple mean in gs, Glorious Revelation’s layout deliberately commits to
a single, concise, united, best interpretation. It shelves many sound, but less-preferred, alternatives and
is especially influenced by the Middle East setting of the Book of Revelation. After all, St. John’s home
turf was the Middle East—not only the central Holy Land home of monotheism but also the surround-
ing broader region. Further, the newly-revealed interpretations set the Book of Revelation firmly in the
monotheistic Middle East. It was this same Middle East that saw the evolution of Christianity and two
more monotheistic Faiths after 95 AD . The first was Islam in all its forms, for both better and worse,
and it should be no surprise that this major Middle East faith, Islam, should prominently feature in the
Book of Revelation.

For St. John in 95 AD, Islam was more than a twinkle in the eye, but still a fetal Faith, whose due date
was 622 AD , five centuries later. Islam’s thunderous fast descent across the Middle East was important
prophetic news about which St. John indeed prophesied. Indeed, his Book of Revelation prophesies Islam
as one successor of the faith of Christianity, sheds fascinating insight into the spiritual and warrior char-
acter of Islam, and provides natural closure for the New Testament. Some historicist interpreters did dis-
cover warrior Islam in Chapter 9,1 catching sight of its Umayyad locust cavalries swarming across the
Middle East and Mediterranean world after 633 AD . They heard its cannons conquer Constantinople in
1453 AD. But they still stayed blind to the appearance of Mu˙ammad in the Book of Revelation, since
they were deaf to his Islam. Nor did they identify Islam as the “beast trying to change times and laws
for three and a half times” in Daniel 7:25, or realize that the recurring 1,260-day time prophecy of the
Book of Revelation ran on the Muslim calendar.

Continuing with multiple Middle East meanings, Jerusalem and Babylon represent spiritually noble and
destructive ideologies in any area or era. Jerusalem, once Christianity, here shines as a new Faith of Glory.

\[98\] Lights of ‘Irfán

Babylon, once Rome, is here interpreted as cancerous materialism, while an alternative interpretation would
also see Babylon as the general loss of spirituality by humanity itself. Likewise, “the image of the beast”
in verses 13:11–16 portrays any ruler or regime duplicating a bestial predecessor’s systematic tax extortion
and discrimination against mi norities. Here, writ large for Empires dominating the Middle East, the bes-
tial Ottoman Empire of 1299 th rough 1918 AD succeeds the Umayyad of 661 th rough 749 AD. Yet in St.
John’s era the bestial Roman Emperor Domitian (82–96 AD also followed Nero (54–68 ad), and ruling the
Middle East, the bestial Umayyad Empire also succeeded the Roman. Then just within Islam, Caliph Yazid
poisoned his father Mu’awiyeh in 680 ad, the Abbasids overthrew the Umayyads in 749 ad (which means the
second beast of verse 13:11 has a serious alternative to the Ottoman regime in this Abbasid regime), and in
addition, the nineteenth century Persian Qajar regime imitated the Ottoman regime.

On a smaller scale, verse 9:4’s grass, plants, and trees of the territories occupied by the seventh cen-
tury Umayyads portrayed both the benevolent standing orders reining in their cavalries to limit how
much they hurt people and property, and also the Sabaean, Jewish, Zoroastrian, and Christian congre-
gations, houses of worship, and clergies under their occupation. Likewise, verse 13:1’s ocean of the
Umayyads displayed both their Arabian seacoast of origin, and also the heretical ocean of their collec-
tive mind. In a sim il ar vein, listings of people and subjects may assume other valid sequences. Thus
Chapters 2 and 3’s Pergamos, Thyatira, and Sardis can be Zoroastrianism, Hinduism, and Buddhism in
another credible order. Verses 6:2–3’s calf and human Living Beings or Pr im ary Figures can be reversed
as the Servant of Glory and the Door to Glory. Likewise, verses 14:6–11’s three herald messengers, vers-
es 14:14 and 14:17’s two judges, and verse 21:2’s fifth and sixth Commandments, can be acceptably
reordered—for, regardless of sequence, the guiding spiritual concept of each list remains true.

Glorious Revelation relies upon revealed year dates for time prophecies in the Book of Revelation. The
Bahá’í sources use the tested year-for-a-day biblical principle of Numbers 14:34 and Ezekiel 4:6.
Expand in g, a month (defined as 30 days by Genesis 7:11, 24, and 8:3–4) represents 30 years, and a year
represents 360 years. The two time prophecies already mentioned ring in 1844 AD and toll the knell of
Islam. Verse 9:15 sounds the first 391-day time prophecy (a day, a month, and a year) echoing amidst can-
nons booming Ottoman conquest of Constantinople in the 1453 AD. Count these 391 days as years from
1453 AD, and you reach 1844 AD. Chapters 11 and 12 broadcast the second 1,260-day time prophecy loud
and clear, four ways, seven times, amid proclamations of spiritual and military Islam and its successor
faith. Count these 1,260 days as Islamic years from the first Islamic year of 1 AH (Anno Hijirah), or 622
AD, and you obtain 1260 AH, that was 1844 AD.

H is torically, the prophetic year 1844 AD signaled the taking of effect of 1839 AD’s Ottoman Tanzimat
reforms in Palestine. These general reforms attempted a revival of the Ottoman Empire, but too late and
too little. Yet the freedoms they brought improved the lot of Palestinian Jews and Christians. Thus 1844
AD was the spiritual conception of the State of Israel, which sparked Jewish settlement of Palestine over
a complicated century-long gestation before Israel’s birth in 1948 CE.

Many time prophecies outside the Book of Revelation identify 1844 AD, too. Counting the “2,300 days
to the end of desolation” of Daniel 8:14 as years from the decree of Artaxerxes of 457 BC that fin al iz ed
the consecration of the rebuilt Jerusalem Temple renders 1844 AD (no 0 AD/BC year existed). This decree
was the most important of four—the first of Cyrus of 536 BC (Ezra 1), the second of Darius of 519 BC
(Ezra 6), the third of Artaxerxes of 457 BC (Ezra 7) and the fourth of Artaxerxes of 444 BC (Nehemiah
2). An entirely Muslim time prophecy predicted the return of the Shi’i Twelfth Imam a thousand years
after his disappearance in 260 AH (873 AD), namely in 1260 AH, that is, 1844 AD. Even more time prophe-
cies for 1844 AD appear in Judaism, Zoroastrianism, and Islam.

Such remarkable inter-Faith agreement prophesying 1844 AD supports a compelling case for both inter-
Faith unity and also prophecy13 in general. Further, the timing of Glorious Revelation is ahead of many
other interpretations because 1844 AD guides it. Specifically, prophetic events up to the end of Chapter
16 have already been fulfilled, including the last, the Battle of Armageddon.

The word Armageddon transliterates as Har Megiddo, which is Hebrew for Mount Megiddo. Megiddo
alone, once a military settlement stabling war horses, is now just a ten-acre tel, an uninhabited archeo-

logical 200-foot hillock. In Hebrew, tel is a small hill, usually man-made, a giva’ is a hill, and har is a
real mountain. Any map shows Mount Carmel is the sole mountain above Megiddo, and for this and
other reasons Glorious Revelation identifies Mount Carmel as Mount Megiddo or Armageddon. Chapter
16 develops its sequential “Armageddon series” of historically connected interpretations, all symbolized
by the spiritual spot of Mount Carmel. Verse 14 narrates the “warfare of the greatest day of God,” then
verse 16 names “Armageddon,” but ahead of verses 17–21 that actually explode its warfare.

The first history in this Armageddon series was spiritual warfare when the Persian clergy and govern-
ment tried to extinguish the Faith of Glory after 1844 AD, martyring 20,000 followers, and continu in g
persecutions through the twentieth century. Eighteen centuries earlier, Christianity underwent sim il ar
persecutions. The second Armageddon, around 1870 AD, was the Proclamation to the Kings from the
region of Mount Carmel, an extensive systematic correspondence methodically urging world leaders to
make peace, but they chose war. The outcome was the third Armageddon of the Balkans, where World War
I started in 1914 AD. The fourth Armageddon was the decisive final battle ending World War I in 1918 AD,
literally at Mount Carmel and Megiddo. British General Allenby decisively routed the army of the
Ottoman Empire that was also enemy to the Faith of Glory. [Earlier in Jerusalem, my great uncle had been
shot down from a balloon and my aunt and uncle-in-law-to-be were Jerusalem children presenting flow-
ers to victorious Allenby.] Finally, the fifth most massive Armageddon, writ large in Glorious Revelation,
was manifest as this whole twentieth century of worldwide warfare and cold war since 1914 AD.

In summary, Mount Carmel, for the Faith of Glory, symbolizes an Armageddon battle series that start-
ed as Middle East inter-Faith persecution, continued through appeals for peace, then opened as World
War I in the Balkans, included the British defeat of the Ottoman Empire, and ultimately became the
global war lasting this whole twentieth century. Now, at century and millennium end, increasingly effec-
tive global initiatives against warfare augur enough global wisdom, power, and hope for a new charter
of nations to extinguish warfare and guide humanity towards its millennium of peace.

However, 2000 AD only puts us at the start of Chapters 17–19 that bode a pending Greatest Depression
first. Chapter 17 identifies Babylon as systematic cancerous materialism, narrating how empire after
empire have thereby abused humanity for three millennia. Cancerous materialism controlled, in partic-
ular, a series of ancient Empires: Egypt, Assyria, Babylonia, Persia, Greece, Rome and Byzantium. These
seven were ethically the biggest and worst, the most imposing ones that dom in ated the Middle East
before, dur in g, and after St. John’s time. Aptly, Chapter 17 also explains prophetic interpretation, using
the whore, waters, beast, and city as its examples in the context of cancerous materialism. Next, Chapter
18 describes a Greatest Depression, worse than the 1930s, that destroys cancerous materialism, and spir-
itually corrects the Dow-Jones and sim il ar indices, ringing and wringing out cancerous materialism to
stop it persuasively and obsessively putting things before people. Verses 11–13 indicate sequential mar-
ket crashes—gold early, goods next, transport later, and labor last (giving workers some respite). This is
an unpopular subject to broach at a relatively prosperous time in the West, and its exact timing cannot
be known. Suffice it to say that according to this interpretation of Glorious Revelation, it will start sud-
denly and surprise everybody, and lasts a full chapter! Then Chapter 19 describes its outcome of spiri-
tual awakening and sharing of God’s material bounty. Later, spiritual economics features as one positive
new commandment of Chapter 21’s Twelve Commandments of the advancing Law of God. Last, the gold-
en Millennial light of Chapters 20–22 dawns as the glorious garden of “Revelation palace,” blossoming
in unity and peace.

We have already seen how the time prophecies of the Book of Revelation synchronize with those of
other faiths. Indeed, the influence of the Book of Revelation extends far beyond its strictly Christian
origin. Its central sacrificial figure, the Ram, leads the way. This arnion, the diminutive of arnen, mean-
ing sheep, appears in verse 5:6 and translates as “young Ram.” The traditional translation, “Lamb,” is a
misnomer, since right from verse 5:6 the arnion possesses horns and is angry in verses 6:16–7—both typ-
ical of a ram, not a lamb. Rams were also sacrificial an im als just like lambs. This Ram, the Door of
Jesus, was his prophesied Second Com in g, not his First. For this Ram prophesying Jesus in hindsight has
little point. In any case, Jesus is named simply Jesus in many verses. Instead, this Ram is the Door of
Jesus who was his also-sacrificed Second Com in g.

This Door or Ram of Jesus was a Persian Manifestation of God in Persia named the Báb He was born
in 1819 AD, proclaimed in 1844 AD, and was executed in 1850 AD. His name, the Báb, translates as
“Door” or “Gate” as interchangeably thura does in Greek. This name lets Glorious Revelation interpret
the thura or Door of verses 3:8, 3:20, and 4:1 as him. In 1850 AD it was Persian rulers and Muslim cler-
gy executing him by firing squad. But his followers and Western observers reported that the 750 bullets
of the first firing squad missed him. He vanished but was found miraculously unscathed in his cell com-
pleting his last, previously interrupted, dictation. Then the 750 bullets from the Muslim squad, replac-
ing the first now-deserted Armenian squad, killed him. Bullets pierced this Second Coming of the Ram
as crucifixion nails pierced his First Coming as the Lamb of Jesus. In 1899 AD the Báb’s hidden remains
were taken to Mount Carmel for burial, entombing him as another Elijah beside the tomb of the first
Elijah. (In Christianity John the Baptist had fulfilled this same role).

Yet, in 1844 AD, Millennialists,15 who had tracked down biblical prophecies in order to greet the
Second Coming of Jesus, missed him. They got the time right, but neither his place nor identity. For they
assumed that, somehow, Jesus would simply appear, miraculously, with the clouds, in the sky, for every-
one, no matter where, to see. Such literal Christian expectations for the Second Coming of Jesus were
not met by the Báb, any more than sim il ar literal Jewish Messianic expectations had been met by Jesus
eighteen centuries before. For orthodox religion insists that prophecies be fulfilled literally,16 thereby
hiding the sequential dawning of Messiahs and Second Com in gs. As a result, the Messiah who comes is
never the one expected!

Therefore the Book of Revelation is a unique pre-history, describing the evolving Law or Religion of
God that its temple represents, advancing since its publication as event advancing in Christianity, Islam,
and now the latest Bahá’í Faith, which together form the Law of God. In Glorious Revelation the Bahá’í
Faith, which reveals its symbols and verses,1 2,17,18,19 is named the “Faith of Glory.” In this context, the Book
of Revelation recognizes the earlier monotheistic Faiths of Sabaean is m, Judaism, Zarathustrianism,
Hindu is m, and Buddhism.

This latest Bahá’í Faith was born when the Báb proclaimed in 1844 AD, its first calendar year, 1 BE
(Bahá’í Era). In Persian its name derives from bahá, meaning “glory,” and the Faith’s foremost
Manifestation of God is named Bahá’u’lláh, meaning “Glory of God.” Further, the grand global birth cry
of the Bahá’í Faith announces two Manifestations of God instead of just one, and twenty-four found in g
disciples instead of just the twelve sons of Israel, disciples of Jesus, or Imams of Mu˙ammad. The Bahá’í
Faith declares that the Báb and Bahá’u’lláh are the twin Manifestations whom God has promised to every
Faith—not least Christianity and Islam. The Báb preceded, and opened his Door, to his greater successor
Manifestation of God, Bahá’u’lláh, who was a contemporary Teheran nobleman born in 1817 AD.20 The
Báb and Bahá’u’lláh are the most recent of a series of Manifestations of God including Adam, Noah,
Abraham, Moses, Zarathustra, Krishna, Buddha, Jesus, and Mu˙ammad, who, from age to age, have suc-
cessively taught our species the Law of God now advancing to global status. Today, its latest Bahá’í Faith
stands historically where Christianity stood around 156 AD.

Bahá’u’lláh proclaimed himself in 1863 AD and led the Bahá’í Faith forward in spite of being in prison
most of his life. In 1892 AD he died and was buried in Ottoman Palestine, now Israel. Bahá’u’lláh was the
Angel of the exalted Jesus in Chapter 1 of the Book of Revelation, with white hair, flaming eyes, and a
radiant face. These descriptions in verses 14–16 accurately reflect his physical features. Further, his
known genealogy fits both lineages, the “root” and “offspring of David,” of verses 5:5 and 22:16. The
Book of Revelation’s title “Father” also applies to Bahá’u’lláh.21,22,23,24 For this title only once applied to
Jesus,25 whom the title “Son” suits best.

Another Book of Revelation title, Christos, equivalent to the Hebrew Mashiach, has the exact literal
meaning “anointed” and derives from ceremonial anointing of kings and prophets by Jews, and of polit-
ical and religious leaders by Greeks. Yet, writ large, the title Anointed describes all the Manifestations
of God passing through the millennia, includ in g, but not limited to, Jesus. Christos is Jesus Christ for
Christians, Mashiach is the awaited Messiah for Jews, and Bahá’u’lláh is this era’s Millennial Messiah for
Bahá’ís, with Jesus and Muhammad Messiahs of previous cycles of the Law of God. Glorious Revelation
therefore applies context to translate Chr is tos as either “C hr is t” or “Messiah.” Again, the cluster of titles

“First and Last,” “Beginning and End,” “Alpha and Omega”20,26,27,28 defines Manifestations of God as first
beginners and final enders of the religious cycles that steadily advance the Law of God through the mil-
lennia. These titles first describe God in verse 1:8, next introduce the 95 AD Angel of the exalted Jesus
in verses 1:11 and 17, then proclaim him as the exalted Bahá’u’lláh eighteen centuries later in verses 21:6
and 22:13.

The writings of altogether four Bahá’í pr im ary figures are authoritative. The foremost are Bahá’u’lláh
and the Báb, and the others, the Faith’s Servant of Glory, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, and its Guardian, Shoghi Effendi.
Other interpretations of the Book of Revelation based on the Bahá’í sources,29,30,31,32,33,34 like Glorious
Revelation, are simply regarded as opinion. Such strictness boosts the very authority of the interpreta-
tions that the primary figures reveal. The Epilogue lists their ava il able interpretations for the Book of
Revelation, verse by verse, on pages 145–48.35 Bahá’u’lláh’s 1862 AD Book of Certitude [Kitáb-i-ˆqán]
reveals symbols in the Book of Revelation in extensive detail.35 Subsequently ‘Abdu’l-Bahá interprets the
core 15% of its 394 verses; that repetition expands to 30%.17,35,≥ He writes further, “The Book of
Revelation produces wonderful effects in minds, and causes hearts to be attracted.”36 Then the Guardian
expands the interpretations for key verses.18,19,35 All their relevant writings are scattered piecemeal across
a century in sacred publications. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá has also interpreted other prophecies piecemeal: Daniel,
but only verses 8:13–17, 9:24–26, and 12:6–7, 11–12;37 and Isaiah, but only verses 9:6-9, 11:1–10, 43:1,
48:12, and 55:12.38 Bahá’í revealed writings do not interpret the Book of Revelation from beginning to
end. For its interpretation has helped teach this Bahá’í Faith, but has not been an end in itself. Instead,
the interpreted symbols and verses have helped people like Moffett,29 Riggs,30 Sears,31 Motlagh,32 Sours,33
Tai-Seale,34 and me fill the gaps. Glorious Revelation, for its part, faithfully incorporates revealed sym-
bols and verses as cornerstones from which to build its interpretation of the rest. Bahá’í “pilgrim
notes,” also exist as hearsay reports, and the few that interpret the Book of Revelation were written by
western Bahá’ís who met ‘Abdu’l-Bahá or Shoghi Effendi.

One such report by Ruth Moffett identifies the Angel of Jesus of Chapters 1 as Bahá’u’lláh, and the con-
gregations as faiths. Fortunately a letter that Shoghi Effendi wrote to her supports her, in that it states, “He
is the Father and all previous dispensations led up to him.”39 She further quotes him unsubstantiated, say-
ing, “The Book of Revelation is the Master Bridge revealed by Christ for the followers of all religions, lead-
ing to the Kingdom of God upon the earth; and Bahá’u’lláh holds the seven in his right hand....”40

Then, Shoghi Effendi writes for Chapter 4 that the twenty-four Elders around the throne in verse 4:4

were the twenty-four founders [sic] of the Bahá’í Faith of whom at least nineteen were known as the
Letters of the Liv in g.41 The odd but accurate Greek def in ing the throne positions helps considerably.
Verse 4:6 places the four Living Beings both upon and also around the throne. Not to be outdone, verse
5:6 places the Lamb or Ram simultaneously both at the center of the throne and Living Beings and also
among the Elders. Then verse 7:17 has the Ram partly sharing the throne. In fact, these three verses spell
out a Bahá’í Who’s Who for the overlap of the Persons Enthroned, the Living Beings, and the Elders of
Chapter 4. When read in the light of the interpretation, the odd Greek wording is seen to be accurate
and becomes clear. For the four Living Beings are the pr im ary Bahá’í figures and also four of the twen-
ty-four Elders. Verses 4:2–3’s and 5:6’s God’s two Manifestations on the throne are Bahá’u’lláh and the
Báb, who are also two of the four Living Beings. Seen in reverse, the twenty-four Founders include the
four pr im ary Bahá’í figures and another twenty founders, and the four primary Bahá’í figures include
Bahá’u’lláh and the Báb as well as ‘Abdu’l-Bahá and Shoghi Effendi.

The patches of color and edge pieces of Glorious Revelation’s jigsaw mosaic of the Book of Revelation,
namely the revealed symbols and verses, join other verses in its crossword puzzle and decode their mean-
ings, too. Repetition already expands the revealed core 15% of the 394 verse total to 30%. For example,
two of the three revealed “Woes” of verse 11:14 also appear in verses 8:13 and 9:12. Then St. John’s
extensive crossword clues, the literary lines and hooks he cast throughout his Book of Revelation, are
trigger-phases and link-words like the ones Friedman discovered in Genesis,42 and they connect the other
70% of verses in various ways. Date prophecies join together mathematically, small differences in repeat-
ing phrases become leads, symbols reveal mean in gs at both spiritual and material levels, and Hebraisms
make new sense.

For example, the “mighty” angel appearing in verses 5:2, 10:1, and 18:21, simply interprets as one per-
son, Bahá’u’lláh. Four horses that neigh differently in verses 6:1–8, 14:20, and 19:18, still gallop through-
out true to character as corrupt theology, widespread warfare, economic injustice, and wanton death,
wherever they are. The 391-year prophetic period of verse 9:15 ends exactly in the 1844 AD of Chapters
11 and 12. Clouds double as glory and opposition, horses as harmful spiritual and military forces, and
earthquakes as doubts and warfare. The Hebraism, “curse of war” of verse 22:3 reveals meaning for the
otherwise solitary bare word “curse”—thanks to Aune. St. John’s literary lines and hooks join his hither-
to concealed 70% of verses in a web of discovery of Glorious Revelation’s single united agenda. Once
you recognize and catch your first line, grasping the others comes more easily....

In summary, Glorious Revelation turns the prophetic pages of the Book of Revelation and reveals it
as a pre-history of Christianity, Islam, and the Bahá’í Faith of Glory serially advancing one Law of God,
the Religion of God, since 95 AD. I take sole responsibility for Glorious Revelation. It was conceived,
incubated, hatched, and nurtured to fly on balanced wings of scholarship and spirituality as an inde-
pendent investigation of truth. Encouragement and help from friends, well-wishers, and fellow truth
seekers in all Faiths made it possible.
