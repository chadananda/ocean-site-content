             Sapiential The¢sis: A New Reading of
Ephrem the Syrian’s Hymns on Paradise

Christopher Buck

Précis: A fresh reading of the Hymns on Paradise discloses how
Ephrem the Syrian, who was quite possibly the greatest Christian poet of
Late Antiquity, reworked soteriological presuppositions and thought-
forms current in fourth-century Syria to effect a transformation of the
doctrine of the¢sis (deification), freeing it from its substantive categories,
to lay emphasis on divinization at the sapiential level. While the form of
the doctrine with its anthropological considerations was kept intact, the
manner of Ephrem’s affirmation of the¢sis was tantamount to its sophis-
tication, in what amounted to a reformulation of the doctrine itself. In
Ephrem’s eschatological scheme—which exalts form                  over   sub-
stance—body, soul and spirit are rarefied beyond physicality, while cor-
poreality is maintained. Even the argument for the body’s afterlife exis-
tence—the instrumentality of the senses being required for the soul’s
ability to perceive—is effectively undermined by the obviation or pre-
cluding of the senses in the soul’s immediate cognition of the delights of
Paradise. This innovation lent Ephrem’s doctrine of the¢sis a greater po-
tential for realization, in which eschatological Paradise came to enjoy a
more edifying immediacy among the faithful. Ephrem’s poetic articula-
tion of sapiential the¢sis struck a balance between the Bardaißanite rejec-

tion of corporeal resurrection and the more earth-bound, Irano -Semitic
notions of disgorgement of the dead and the pairing of bodies with disin-
carnate souls for requital at the eschaton. At the same time, Ephrem’s
symbolic transformation of Paradise reflexively served as an allegory for
the Church. An unanticipated consequence for modern Christianity, ac-
cording to Brock, is that “precisely because he locates Paradise outside

geographical space,” Ephrem’s “views are left unaffected by modern ad-

vances in scientific knowledge.”
Introduction: Called “the greatest poet of the patristic era” and “a

privileged witness of the tradition of the primitive church of Persia,”

Ephrem the Syrian (c. 306–373 C.E.) composed the Hymns on Paradise

in his native Nisibis (pre-363) before his twilight years in Edessa. These
hymns, considered by Mathews to have been “perhaps Ephrem’s most

beautiful hymns,” are of the genre called madr¡åê, composed in syllabic
metres. Clearly, as the name implies, such odes often performed
midrash, or commentary, on scripture, for the edification of the faithful.
An original and imaginative commentary on the account of Eden in the
Book of Genesis (Chapters 2 and 3), the Hymns on Paradise is a liturgical
cycle of fifteen hymns, depicting the primordial Paradise of Adam to be
the future (and possibly the present, with respect to an ante-Paradise)
abode of the righteous. Documenting Ephrem’s cosmogony, anthropology
and soteriology, these hymns penetrate deep within the ethos of early

Syriac Christianity. Ephrem has painted a visiona ry landscape from a

palette of symbols of immanent transcendence. That the Paradise de-
picted in the Hymns is clothed in metaphor, as Ephrem tells us, raises
some questions as to how transcendent these symbols are and how im-
manent they may be at the same time. In other words, if Paradise is de-
scribed in metaphor, could Paradise itself be a metaphor?

Ephrem’s poetry was not recited, but sung. Choirs of virgins intoned
these hymns in melodies already familiar to the congregation. Under
such circumstances, we could easily picture how these lyrics, drawing on
the Genesis narrative, could be so effective in performing exegesis for the
benefit of lay Christians. This liturgical medium did not diminish or
detract from the subtlety and allusive depth of Ephrem’s interpretations,
but some metaphorical competence on the part of the listener was surely
required to follow such a hymn in all its interpretive details. Perhaps
some of the finer points of Ephrem’s exegesis might have been lost on the
listener, but his hymns were popular just the same, having gained a
reputation throughout the non-Assyrian Christian world as well, a
growing acclaim that evidently began within Ephrem’s own lifetime. Far
more effective than any tome of theology, the Hymns had a formative
impact in structuring the religious consciousness of those singing and of
those who listened. The scriptures were expounded in a most memorable
way. These hymns are rich and vivid; they must have inspired contempla-
tion. The Hymns on Paradise must have captured the imagination of
Ephrem’s congregation, whom he served as deacon. The theme of Para-
dise must have been of especial interest.

Visionary texts purport to give us a glimpse of the afterworld, of
Heaven and Hell, and of intermediate states, if any, in between. Ephrem
tells us that in a vision, induced while reading scripture, he was suddenly
transported to Paradise, a place which he begins to describe in some

detail. Typically, in apocalyptic texts, such a mystic transport or rapture
involves a “heavenly journey”—usually made possible by the assistance
of a celestial being. Not so in the case of Ephrem, who hardly exceeds
scripture in his own portrayal of Paradise. This seems to be the case with
other Syriac Christian texts as well, in that “no Syriac apocalypse belongs
to the type identified […as…] apocalypses with a heavenly journey (with
or without interest in history). The heavenly journey motif seems to be

foreign to Syriac apocalyptic.” Not through a purely mystical vision, but
rather on the basis of scripture enhanced by poetic license, the heavenly
scenes Ephrem paints are for pastoral purposes.

The Hymns on Paradise are edifying in their dramatization and vivi-
fying of details disclosed or implied by scripture. Though the Hymns os-
tensibly focus on the afterlife (both prior to and after Resurrection),
much of the imagery idealizes Christian life and community here on
earth. The moral truths of these hymns are not merely couched in the
metaphorical “lie” for poetic effect. There was something real about
Paradise that Ephrem had to explain in a surreal way. Could Ephrem’s
portrayal of Paradise have served as an allegory for a realized eschatol-
ogy here on earth? In reading Ephrem, we must bear in mind that Syriac
Christianity expressed its truths in a symbolic rather than philosophical

fashion. Ephrem’s hymns are not systematic expositions. Despite mod-
ern literary notions of the authorial fallacy, Ephrem’s intentions are not
difficult to divine. In composing the Hymns, Ephrem had Christians in
mind. When the hymns were sung, thoughts turned heavenward. In his
own Church, Paradise was the mirror on the intellectual ceiling. It re-
flected back.

The poet was poetically transported to Paradise, so that Paradise
might be transported to the reader. This study will argue that Ephrem
has inverted worlds of correspondences. In an arc of descent, Paradise is

a metaphor for the ideal Christian community. The “victorious” martyrs,
for instance, are said to sometimes reside in this world: “From their
abodes / the children of light descend, / they rejoice in the midst of the
world / where they had been persecuted; / … Blessed is he who has seen /
together with them, his beloved ones, / below in their bands of disciples,

and on high in their bridal chambers.”         Which means, for Ephrem’s lis-
teners, that the souls of the beloved martyrs descend to local Nisibis;
and, also, to Edessa. One might argue that the martyrs, as depicted here,
descend to an eschatological earth, the inheritance of the leonine meek.
But Ephrem does not exclude the present time frame, and so this event
has a potential immediacy.

It is as if the souls of the martyrs themselves, from the realm of
sacred time to the sundial shadows of Roman and Persian Syria, had a
charismatic role to play in this world as well. If read in this light, such a
stanza must certainly have inspired and consolidated the emerging
Palu†ian congregation in which Ephrem ministered as deacon. In an arc
of ascent, Paradise is the symbol of a reality to which the faithful aspire
and in which reality of which they already mystically participate. Here,
the active principle of mystical experience is divinization at the level of
sacrament, and good works at the level of praxis.
The Hymns on Paradise as Liturgy: The manuscript tradition of

Ephrem’s hymns has been conveniently summarized by Kronholm.                 The
Hymns on Paradise are genuinely Ephremic, of uncontested authenticity.
Ephrem’s hymns were orders of public worship. As mentioned earlier, the
hymns were performed liturgically. They were sung by choirs of virgins,

affectionately known as the “Daughters of the Covenant” (bnat qy¡mâ),

according to a Syriac Life of Ephrem.               As madr¡åê, the Hymns on
Paradise were meant to be sung, as distinct from the m™mrê, poetic homi-
lies composed in verses of seven syllables, intended for reading. The
Hymns consist of unrhymed stanzas comprised by a stanzaic pattern of
syllables in the following pattern: 5 + 5 / 5 + 5 / 5 + 5 / 7 / 5 + 5 / 5 + 5.

contemplation beneath the angelic galaxy of the fourth-century Christian
Syria. In Christian domain, accessible to the illiterate, not restricted to
the intellectual elite, these Hymns valorized religious truths and so be-
came a shaping influence on local Christians. For the modern study of
early Christianity, these hymns tell us much about the form and content
of popular and not just of official religiosity, where the act of praise be-
came part of the text. In any study of fourth-century Christian Syria, lit-
urgy cannot be marginalized. Of Ephrem’s hymns, as liturgical rites, it
could rightly be said: “A demand is made on actors enacting the rite to
preserve a tacit management of paradox and ambiguity to realize its

theological basis in a credible manner.”

Were the Hymns on Paradise meant to induce a realized eschatology?

This is a question of the relationship between content and intent. Just
what was being realized, if anything, in the Hymns on Paradise, and
what were the probability structures that could sustain such a realiza-
tion? This much may be hazarded: the Hymns on Paradise, as mirror of
the holy, were rites of contemplative passage into Paradise, mystic trans-
ports to the empyrean realms on high, visions of the celestial to inspire
those on earth treading the spiritual path leading to heaven.
In a realized state, Paradise is where the heart is: “In the bridal

chamber of such a person’s heart, the Creator resides.”            According to
Semitic anthropology, the heart is the seat of the intellect as well as that

of the emotions.       Of the immanence of Paradise in this world, Ephrem
assures: “The breath that wafts / from some blessed corner of Paradise /
gives sweetness / to the bitterness of this region, / it tempers the curse /

on this earth of ours.”        Paradise is a presence, a fragrance that wafts
from the realm above to the sanctuary below. But can it be realized? To
approach such a question, Ephrem begins by teaching the Christian what

Paradise is not. In Ephrem’s Hymns, Paradise is real, but not always lit-
erally so.

The Mirror of Scripture: Ephrem’s Letter to Publius may be said to be
the prosaic counterpart of Hymns on Paradise, the former attesting the
eschatology of the latter in several important respects. Ephrem states

that, in scripture, “there Paradise is visible.”                In his Letter, Ephrem
speaks of the Gospel as “a figure” for the beauty of the Kingdom of

Heaven.             Through the Gospel looking-glass, this realm is visible to “the
luminous eye.” “There,” Ephrem writes, “Paradise is visible, joyous with

its flowers.”             “The Scriptures are placed there like a mirror,” the poet
explains, “and he whose eye is luminous beholds there the image of real-

ity.”

Ephrem uses a metaphorical                 visionary form to express an eschato-
logical reality. Gazing into “the mirror of the Gospel,” Ephrem writes: “I
saw there beautiful people, and I was desirous of their beauty; and I saw
the place of the good where they were standing, and I was eager for their
position. I saw their bridal chamber, which no one who has not a lamp
may enter; I saw their joy, and I myself sat down in mourning, not pos-
sessing works worthy of that bridal chamber. I saw them clothed with the
‘robe of light,’ and I was grieved that I had prepared no virtuous rai-

ment.”

Metaphors of the Incomparable: As the title of this paper suggests,
there exists tension between metaphorical and realized descriptions of
Paradise. It is an unusual move for a poet to explicate his own poetry, but
Ephrem took preceptive measures against any temptation on the part of
audience to take his metaphors literally. Ephrem is quite clear about the
figurative nature of his descriptions: “If someone concentrates his atten-
tion solely / on the metaphors used of God’s majesty, / he abuses and mis-
represents that majesty / and thus errs / by means of those metaphors … /
Do not let your intellect/ be disturbed by mere names, / for Paradise has

simply clothed itself / in terms that are akin to you …”.              Brock charac-
terizes Ephrem’s idea of God’s “putting on metaphors” as a virtual real-

ity, a second form of incarnation.        In fact, Ephrem uses several technical
terms to highlight divine metaphoricity in Scripture and in Nature as
well: symbol (râzâ); metaphor (dm∞tâ); allegory (pel™tâ); and type (†upsâ),
are among some of them.

The Anthropology of the Hymns on Paradise: Ephrem plays on the
ambiguity of metaphor and exploits the polyvalence of symbol so as to
present Paradise in ecclesial as well as in otherworldly terms. In this
sense, the hymns, once intoned, may be considered conceptually theurgic,

in what Brock terms an “engagement”               with the metaphors. In this ten-
sion between the metaphoric and the realized, realization is achieved
through accepting some of Ephrem’s metaphorical correspondences be-
tween Paradise and parish. Brock resolves the tension through making a
crucial distinction between “historical” and “sacred” time. He writes: “Be-
cause the paradisiacal life of the eschaton belongs to sacred time, it is
possible for it to be experienced, in varying degrees, by individuals al-

ready in historical time on earth.”        If Paradise may be partly realized on
earth, how is it experienced in heaven? With physical or spiritual senses?

With body or mind, or both? To understand the modality of being a
dweller in Paradise, a description of Ephrem’s anthropology is required.

Trichotomy vs. Dichotomy: One must beware of relying too heavily on
any single analysis of Ephrem’s thought. A case in point surrounds the
issue of anthropological trichotomy vs. dichotomy. In his effort to situate
Ephrem within the School of Antioch, Khoury opted for the latter:
“Ephrem, typically Antiochene, espouses a dichotomous idea of man as
the only created being capable of reconciling that old dualistic pair, mat-

ter and spirit.”      This association suggests, in the present writer’s opin-
ion, an urban Ephrem tinged with Hellenism, though this is incommen-

surable with the fact that Syrians rarely spoke Greek.                   For Brock,

Murray and Kronholm, Ephrem is more Semitic than he is Antiochene.

Spirit, according to Khoury, is not problematic for maintaining an
Ephremic body-soul duality. Spirit (r∞˙â) is “the spiritual principle of the

body” which Ephrem describes as grains on a stalk of wheat.                   Unfortu-
nately, Khoury does not elaborate on the relationship of spirit to soul, or
whether the two are synonymous or not. Kronholm reminds us that
Ephrem’s views on the soul, as with his anthropology in general, are not
uniform. “It is, however, indisputable” concludes Kronholm, “that

Ephrem’s anthropological conception is fundamentally trichotomic.”

Yousif feels that trichotomy is “perhaps too strong a term.”                  Notwith-
standing, Ephrem’s triune conception of man is explicitly set forth in the
Hymns: “Far more glorious than the body (g∞åmâ) / is the soul (n¡fåâ), /
and more glorious (åeb£˙) still than the soul / is the spirit (tar<£®â), / but

more hidden than the spirit / is the Godhead.”
“Man,” states Ephrem, “is perfected as triune: spirit, and soul, and

the body as the third.”            Technical terms for this trichotomy greatly

vary.      “The three Names are sown in three ways,” states Ephrem in an-
other hymn, “in the spirit, the soul, and the body, mysteriously.” Further:
“If the spirit suffers, it is entirely imprinted by the Father; / if the soul
suffers, it is wholly mingled with the Son; / and if the body is burnt in

martyrdom, / then its communion with the Holy Spirit is complete.”                   The

“imprinted” spirit refers to its being divinized.          It is in the nature of the
spirit to be imprinted, that is, to take on the nature of that to which it
aspires. In this passage is seen a total divinization of the complete, tri-
adic person. In a distinction maintained to this day by Persian

Christians,        “spirit” refers to the spiritual principle in man, just as the

\[39\] For instance, the 21 March 1992 broadcast of the evangelical program

“body” represents the physical being. The spirit can incline either way, in
recrudescence to a feral state or in heliotropic inclination towards the
spiritual sky.

The uniquely individual “soul” is mediate; it exists in both “worlds”.

Like the Father, one’s own “spirit” transcends the physical world which it
is crudely said to inhabit. Like the Son, one’s “soul” is spirit incarnate, so
to speak. Like the Holy Spirit, one’s “body” is the locus on earth of the
divinizing effects of the Holy Spirit. (The latter had scarcely crystallized
in Ephrem’s writings as a divine Person until the Arian crisis, which
prompted the beleagured poet to compose his Hymns on Faith, when Ari-

anism had insinuated itself in Edessa.)           Since the spiritual realm corre-
sponds only to the physical realm in form if not then in metaphor, the
internal logic of such a view would dictate that, at some eschatological
point, the body must transcend its own physicality in order to “live” in the
spiritual realm of Paradise. According to Kronholm, Khoury is “mistaken

in regarding the dichotomy as fundamental.”                Yet Kronholm does not
state what role the spirit plays in Ephrem. It is clear from the passage
above, however, that the spirit is more instinct with power, more rarefied,
more subtle than the soul.

Scripture may have been determinative of these categories. St. Paul
speaks of the Christian’s “spirit, soul, and body” (1 Thess 5:25). According

to Åpidl£k, this trichotomic formula became traditional in the East.
Ephrem drew an explicit analogy between the Trinity and the constituent
elements in man. The analogy is more than poetic—it is noetic. The spirit
links man to God through the Holy Spirit. There is a sympathetic con-
nexion between the Holy Spirit and the human spirit. This charismatism
is crucial to salvation, the transcendence of the animal condition, the
transition from feral anarchism to true freedom. The vehicle of the spirit

is the soul, just as the vehicle of the soul is the body. Without soul, the
body is lifeless; without spirit, the soul is lifeless. As intermediary, the
soul can incline either way.

The Dichotomy of Trichotomy: The substances of man are two: spirit
and matter. What really matters is the “gray matter,” so to speak, in be-
tween! The soul can incline in either direction. This much has been said:
if the soul gravitates towards the mundane, it becomes carnal, taking on
the amoral properties of carnality in the moral sense. It may also be that
the soul, in so doing, retains, as it were, the physicality of carnality itself,
in plastic commensurability with the low estate of its consciousness. The
soul that turns towards spirit, becomes spiritual not only in a moral
sense, but takes on the properties of the spirit, and is physically trans-
lated in the process. The soul, nonetheless, stands in need of a vehicle,
according to all formulas of the¢sis.

The resurrection body is not the body of the Fall. The resurrection
body is the primordial body in which the potential for immortality
resided. The earthly body must be therefore be transformed into a
resurrection body adapted to a spiritual state. After death, the earthly
body does not persist in substance at least in its original density, but
rather in form and function. One thing is for certain: in the body/soul

dualism, the soul has preëminence.           In forcing Ephrem’s texts to con-
form to an Antiochene body/soul paradigm, Khoury appeals to Hymns on
Paradise IX.20 to assert the priority of the soul over the body, yet makes

no reference whatsoever to the priority of the spirit over the soul!

Spirit: The immortality of the soul depends on the spirit, the divine
principle in the soul. The soul was not born by choice; it is reborn by
choice. Its rebirth consists of its union with a spiritual family of Father
(God), Mother (the Holy Spirit), and Brother (Christ), the latter identifi-

cation conceptually implicit in the idea of adoptive sonship.              Explicit

You so that You might save all.”             Jacob of Serug is more forthright in
asserting: “Baptism makes us children so that we become brothers of the

Only-Begotten.”

This assimilation of divinity was considered re-creative. Immortality
is one thing; level of consciousness quite another. Even the wicked had an
afterlife. Consciousness-bound to carnality, such souls could scarcely be
said to have “eternal” life in the strict etymological sense of the word: life
“outside of time.” The spirit in them is part of their essential
anthropology; its dormancy is death in a relative sense. Even in

primordial time there was what Ephrem refers to as a “hidden death.”

The Soul: The soul is “invisible.” Ephrem is careful to distinguish the
soul from the body’s shadow, though idea of soul and shade seem to be
antitypically analogous. The soul, moreover, is “great and perfect,” yet is

“altogether dependent on the Body.”               Ephrem describes the soul, Syriac

n¡fåâ, as the “bride of man.”          The soul is likewise the bride of Christ:
“The soul is Your bride, the body Your bridal chamber. / Your guests are
the senses and the thoughts. / And if a single body is a wedding feast for

The soul has three qualities: reason, (potential) immortality, and

invisibility.         Though invisible, the works of the soul are quite visible and
indicate its spiritual state. Though death is necessarily the separation of
the soul from the body, it seems that the body physically dies but not the
soul. The soul of course can be spiritually “dead”, that is, carnal and thus
inert. It can, so to speak, “die”—through spiritual insensitivity—prior to
physical death. Though the soul is not existentially dead in the afterlife,
it is not fully alive. The soul in some sense is self-existent, but when de-
prived of the instrumentality of the bodily senses, “it lacks true exis-

tence.”        It seems that Ephrem’s teachings on the soul stand midway be-
tween Tatian’s categorical denial of the immortality of the (unsaved) soul
(Oratio ad Graecos XIII.1) and Bardaißan’s affirmation to the contrary.

The “Soul of our Soul”: As reflexive evidence, an expression found in
a post-Ephremic Syriac writer might prove illustrative. In his homily on
the indwelling of the Holy Spirit, Philoxenus speaks of the Holy Spirit

whom we receive from God” at baptism as “the soul of our soul.”                Unless
purely metaphorical or an innovative post-Ephremic development, such
an expression might suggest that, as the soul gives life to the body, the
Spirit gives life to the soul. The Holy Spirit, in the first order of the
trichotomic mingling, energizes the human spirit through the spirit of
faith. The spirit is intimately bound up with the soul, more intimately
than the soul is bound up with the body. As there is no separation imagi-
nable in the spirit/soul fusion, the soteriological challenge is to escha-
tologically place the head back on the fabled headless horseman. It ap-
pears that, for Ephrem, the soul can subsist without the body, but it can-
not subsist without the spirit. It is as if the relationship of spirit to soul
to body is like that of a spark to flame to wick.

The Body as Vehicle for the Soul: Ephrem’s world is a hierarchy of
mirrors within a kaleidoscope of symbols. Even if Khoury were right in

\[54\] Cited by S. Brock, The Holy Spirit in the Syrian Baptismal Tradition. The

holding Ephrem to a body-soul dichotomy, it would still be truer to speak

in terms of a body-soul unity, for “they are a mirror of one another.”         For
Ephrem, the body is personalized, of value to the soul. The body is the
soul’s organ of perception and expression. The wholeness of a human
being is predicated on it. Death, by definition, is the separation of body
and soul. Life, conversely, is the uniting of body and soul. They need to
be, as it were, remarried. But the conditions of their remarriage should
be looked at very closely, as use of the word “body” may prove more con-
text-dependent than a surface reading of Ephrem might otherwise sug-
gest.

Christ, in overcoming death, brings life. The death of the righteous is
overcome by the divinization effected through uncompromised salvation.
The dying process is reversed, as the body is reunited with the soul at the
Last Judgment. During the interval between, Syriac Christianity paints a

picture of the soul as a sleeping ghost,        though Ephrem limns out a more
positive picture in that the righteous wait their rewards in mansions re-
served for them in the foothills just outside the Paradise (Hymns on
Paradise VIII.11). No gnostic liberation from the body is conceived by
Ephrem, although the body of the righteous in Paradise will be liberated
from the disease of mortality.

Rather than the soul being a spark of light trapped in the darkness of
materiality, the soul is a spark of light shining in a lamp. The body is the
lamp. At death, the lamp is broken. At the eschaton, the lamp is not
merely reassembled; rather, it is recreated. Its once-opaque glass is re-
cast as pure crystal.

There is some evidence to suggest that an individual is not in all
respects materially equatable with his/her physical body. Were this to be
so, the body would be resurrected in its gross state. We know that
Ephrem held the resurrection body to be of a different, higher order than
the material body. The former is incorruptible, the latter is not. Paradise

is comprised of a spiritual substance, as Kronholm points out: “The
Paradisiacal world is to him [Ephrem] neither earthly/ corporeally
material, nor spiritually immaterial, but of a particular spiritual

substance.”       If the substance of Paradise is spiritual, so must be the
substance of the glorified body. For purposes of edification, it should be
noted, this distinction was not pressed very hard. Otherwise, Ephrem
would have to have accounted more for the discontinuity rather than the
continuity envisaged in the somatic moment of the eschaton.

Ostensibly, the purpose of salvation in the fourth century was a
purity worthy of immortality. This statement is perhaps too wooden, but
it does broadly reflect a contemporary Christian yearning. Augustine
himself goes so far as to say that “there was no other reason for the

coming of Christ” apart from the resurrection of the body.            This goal of
immortality is effected by an alchemy of the body, soul and spirit into a
new alloy, with the divinity of Christ as the elixir or potency.

Not viewed as the origin of sin, the body is rather the victim of sin.

The mystery of the Eucharist is that a transubstantiation of body and
soul is effected through a special immanence of the divine. Through the
sacraments, divinity is said to “mingle” (mzag) with the believer’s physi-
cal being in a kind of transformative fusion. Sanctification of the
body—and not just of the soul—is the work of a divine Physician, ad-
ministering the medicines of salvation, sacramentally communicated in

the “wheat, olive and grape.”         Flesh, however, is not coterminous with
the body, as examination of the following anthropological terms will bear
out:

<⁄frâ: “Dust” here is used in a purely earthly context, in regard to the
material composition of the body. Qauma, or qaumta: “Height” or “size” in
the sense of “stature” can refer to the human form and the humanness

predicated of its upright posture. Besrâ: “Flesh” can signify a human be-
ing, composed of flesh and blood. Some sense of “sinfulness” is attached
to its Christian usage. As in the Hebrew, besrâ can also mean “anyone” or

“everyone.”           Pagrâ: There is a conflict among leading scholars of Syriac

over the Greek equivalent of this term. Beck equates pagrâ with s¢ma,
while Khoury holds that the term generally corresponds to the Pauline

usage of sarx.             Used as an anatomical term or for any corporate entity,
pagrâ anthropologically means “body” in contradistinction to the mind.
G∞åm¡: It is evident that pagrâ and guåmâ are synonyms, as Ephrem
suggests in this parallelism: “Glory to that Voice (q¡lâ) that became a
body (guåmâ) / and to the lofty Word (melltâ) that became flesh

(pagrâ).”        According to Khoury, the former is generally considered to be
the Syriac counterpart to the Pauline concept of s¢ma. The term guåmâ
indeed refers to a corporeal “body”, but “emphasizes its role as the vessel
of the soul.” Matter, in this sense, is that which has been formed by the

spirit. The spirit, in turn, is informed by the senses.

Asceticism and the Transformation of the Body: The importance of as-
ceticism in early Syriac Christianity cannot be overrated. Passion for the
ascetic ideal was part and parcel of a peculiarly Syrian “order of rap-

ture.”      “The searing lava of mortification…,” writes Vööbus, “virtually

scalds the works in which such accounts are recorded.”                   There is no

Ephremic Asceticon, as it were. Rather, the “monastic witness” of Ephrem

himself is “one of a pre-monastic life of evangelical chastity.”

In the absence of contemporary sources, a document from the school
of Ephrem may have some reflexive value in reconstructing the ascetical
dimension of Ephrem’s teachings in terms of principles though not of

practices. Though Vööbus is incorrect             as to its authenticity, the first

part      of pseudo-Ephrem’s “Letter to the Mountaineers”                is a valuable
post-Ephremic source for our knowledge of Syrian asceticism in Late An-
tiquity. This document describes monasticism in its primitive form, which

Vööbus terms “eremitism”—a kind of pre-monasticism.

The “mountaineers” (†∞r¡yê) are ascetics of whom pseudo-Ephrem
speaks highly: “You see, my brothers, how great an army (lies) on the

mountain.”        Also spoken of as p¡r∞åâ (“prudent”)— employed in the mo-
nastic meaning of “separated ones”—pseudo-Ephrem addresses these an-

chorites with veneration as “brother mountaineers”                  situating them
thereby on the mountains of either Nisibis or Edessa or both.

Suffering (>∞lß¡nâ/˙aåâ), according to pseudo-Ephrem, is the force
that transforms the spiritual being. It is the hallmark of the ascetic
ideal. Through mortification, the body is crucified. It is for this purpose
Christ came, as an exemplar, that mendicants might experience his pas-
sion and its transformative effects: “Jesus died to the world in order that

no one should walk sensuously by it. He died to our world in his body in
order that he might make (us) alive by his body to his world. And he mor-
tified the life of the body in order that we may not live carnally by the
flesh. He was made the master, a teacher not in tribulations of others but
by his own suffering. And he himself first tasted bitterness and (thereby)
showed us that no one could become his disciple by name but only

through suffering.

In this context, pseudo-Ephrem expresses the teleology of asceticism
in a new way: ascetics, in the context of their contests of faith against the
beasts of instinct urged on by the gladiators of demonic temptation, are

represented as true martyrs, “martyrs of hiddenness.”                    This is akin to

Origen’s “martyrdom of conscience” (Exhortation to Martyrdom XXI).

Asceticism, generally speaking, may be regarded as a movement
which grew up in the aftermath of martyrdom. From this vantage,
asceticism may be regarded as a continuation of the martyr tradition.
Certain key terms used to describe martyrs, such as “athlete”, “contest”
and the like, are transferred to ascetics, and as such a strong indicators

of affinities with the martyr ideal.          Very likely this represents the phe-
nomenon of non-sanguinary renunciation under new historical circum-
stances, when persecutions ceased. Ascetics, although they may be shun-
ners of society, play an important role in society, according to pseudo-
Ephrem. Their intercessory prayer sustains the rest of the world, a idea

which Vööbus depicts as “a favorite thought of ’Aphr™m.”

Of relevance to the present study is the concept of the gradual the¢sis
of the body of the ascetic, in which is exemplified a theology of activity.
Suffering, in the Letter to the Mountaineers, transforms the physical be-

ing into that of an angel and produces God’s image in man.                   Have an-
gels, then, bodies? Earth angels in the Syrian desert did. Ascetics came to
be regarded as incarnating, so to speak, an angelicos bios. The difference
is of course subtle.

Paradise Lost: The story of the Fall is so familiar that its retelling
may seem superfluous. There are, however, certain elements and motifs
in Syriac lore that are not Occidental commonplaces. One might think of
the Paradise narrative in its Syriac reading as something like the fable of
the Emperor’s new clothes. Pre-Fall Adam was King of Paradise. Both in
the fable and in the Genesis account, the King is robed in splendor, but
through vanity (in Adam’s case, the wish to become a god) both ended up
shamefully naked. Ephrem symbolically condensed the primordial epi-
sode of the Fall in the idea of the stole of glory, the “robe of light”. This
garment is the golden fleece of Syriac Christian soteriology. Its recovery
was the odyssey of Christ. Its investiture was the cherished hope of every
Christian. Indeed, the very idea of clothing is the most frequently recur-

ring imagery found throughout the various hymn cycles.

As in early Zoroastrianism, the key concept in Ephrem’s anthropology
is choice. In the interplay between free will and the will of God, Adam’s
Fall was the result of his own volition and miscalculation. The serpent is
not to blame, but is culpable as an accomplice. Adam mirrors forth the
human predicament. His free will is the crux of spiritual capacity. Its
optative exercise alone is determinative. As such, God predetermined
neither Adam’s mortality or immortality.

With Adam’s disobedience of God came the loss of godliness, one
aspect of which is immortality. Adam was stripped of his radiance, the
“Robe of Glory,” less frequently referred to as his “Robe of Light”. The
Bible intimately links sin with death. It was to be expected that Ephrem
understood Paradise Lost in the very same terms. Salvation makes it
possible for the Fall to be reversed. It is up to every true Christian to
reverse the Fall.

\[79\] Vööbus, History of Asceticism in the Syrian Orient III, 45.

\[80\] Cf. Brock, The Luminous Eye, 25.

The pre-Fall figure of Adam serves as an inverse eschatological
paradigm of what it is possible for the righteous to become. Adam’s

investiture as King of Paradise, Priest, and Prophet              (the so-called tria
munera which becomes the triple office of Christ)—heightens the extent
of the Fall and sharpens the contrast between saved and unsaved. It was
Christ, strictly speaking, as the agent of creation, who fashioned Adam of
dust, breathed into Adam his soul (is the soul therefore the breath of
God?), and invested him with glory (åwb˙). The “Glory” of the Robe may
have something to do with the charisma of God’s presence, the Hebrew
notion of kabod ha-shem, the “Glory of God” which Ezekiel beheld, but
this must remain only a suggestion as a review of the literature discloses
very little in this connection. In any event, Adam was in every respect the
“image of God”, and it is this original-image relation that Christ restored.
The vaunted “Robe of Glory”—invisible to the naked eye—may be re-

stored through baptism.

Paradise Regained —Baptism as Re-Entry into Paradise: To reca-
pitulate Ephrem’s conception of salvation history, the Robe of Glory is
lost but may be won back once more. The mythology surrounding the
Robe rationalizes the efficacy of the Sacraments according to the follow-
ing soteriological drama:

Paradise, Adam and Eve were clothed in “Robes of Glory” or “Robes of
Light.” Act Two: Disrobed in disgrace: After the Fall, Adam and Eve were

stripped of their “robes of glory/light.” Act Three: Christ places Robe in
Jordan: God “puts on Adam” or “a body” in order to “reclothe mankind in
the robe of glory.” In the course of his descent into the waters of the Jor-
dan at baptism, Christ deposits the “robe of glory/ light” into the water,
sanctifying for all time all baptismal water. Act Four: Robe regained at
Baptism: The invocation of the Holy Spirit at baptism consecrates the
baptismal font, effectively transforming it, in sacred time and space, into
the waters of the Jordan. The “robe of glory” which Adam lost in the Fall

is recovered by the Christian at baptism.

Paradise to Come: In Nisibene Hymns XXXVI.7, Death is personified.

In one of its speeches, Death confesses: “There are two men—I must not
deceive—whose names are missing for me in Sheol: Enoch and Elijah did
not come to me; … they might have entered Paradise and escaped [from

Sheol] …”.        The figure of unsaved Eve provided a typological exemplar.

Eve resides not in Paradise but in Sheol.               This picture of all deceased
humanity in Sheol partly conflicts with another scenario described by
Ephrem in Hymns on Paradise, that of the resting-place for the right-
eous, awaiting the Resurrection. Furthermore, Paradise “is full of spiri-

tual beings”        who banquet, in what appears to be a reference to the pre-
sent and not to future bliss: “There, manifest and fair / to the eye of the
mind, / are coveted banquets of the just / who summon us / to be their

companions and brothers …”.
The bones of the righteous remain in Sheol while the souls of the

righteous tarry in the outskirts or environs of Paradise.               As in the pas-
sage above, Ephrem drops some hints to the effect that the souls of the

righteous are not really asleep after all. Apart from the Semitic question
of the bones, Ephrem depicts a resort for the righteous deceased until the
time of the Resurrection: “Thus in the delightful mansions / on the bor-
ders of Paradise / do the souls of the just / and righteous reside, / await-

ing there / the bodies they love …”
This ante-Paradise is definitely not Sheol. The problem is that,

though the soul is self-existent,       the disincarnate righteous are in a state

of deficient sensation and consciousness             since the body is instrumental

to perception, without which the soul “lacks true existence.”               The soul
cannot die at death; for otherwise the sacraments would be devoid of effi-
cacy. Nor does its preservation seem to be entirely insentient. Ephrem
speaks of death, but not of the death of souls in terms of subsistence.

At death, the soul takes flight (Hymns on Paradise IX.16). The body
remains interred until trumpets summon. The Resurrection, however
conceived, is a definite event in the writings of Ephrem. This climax of
salvation history cannot be spiritualized away. It is open to conceptual
reconsideration. Elsewhere, Ephrem does speak of the disgorgement of

the dead by Sheol at Christ’s harrowing,            though whether or not this was
understood at a purely literal level is perhaps open to question.

Paradise Realized: Heaven on Earth: According to Brock, though
Ephrem is “at a considerable remove from his contemporaries St. Atha-
nasius, St. Basil and the two Sts. Gregory” in thought pattern and ex-
pression, yet they are “essentially at one” in their conceptions of the mys-

tery of the Trinity and the Incarnation.              “The Syriac Fathers, no less

than the Greek,” concludes Brock, “see the the¢sis or divinization of man

as the end purpose of the inhominization of God.”

Earthly Body and the Resurrected Body: There is a fundamental prob-
lem of identity and difference between the earthly body and the resur-
rected body. There had been a long-standing debate within and without
early Christianity over the vexed question of the resurrection of the body.
The pagan philosopher Porphyry (d. c. 301) had attacked Christianity for
its monstrous and ridiculous belief in physical resurrection. Around the
year 177 C.E., Celsus summarized pagan objections to Christianity, call-
ing it “the hope of worms.” After all, who in his right mind would desire a
body that had rotted? “The resurrection is both revolting and impossible,”

Celsus concluded.        This problem will repay a moment’s consideration.

Virginity and the Angelic Life: For Ephrem, true to the Christian Ori-
ent and East alike, the goal of existence is full and perfect deification,
the life of lived dogma, the translation of body and soul into the realm of
the spirit. Does teleology condition views of salvation or does the reverse?
Towards this end, the life of the ascetics was considered exemplary, use-
ful to the soul. As a church within a church, the ascetics enriched a sense
of spirituality generally, like a spiritual leaven. Virgins were the jewel or
“beryl” of the Church. Taken together, the solitaries and virgins could be

seen as “a peacock of the spirit.”        The deeds of solitaries were to be ap-
preciated but not always to be imitated. The lay life was also holy. Celi-
bacy was not a precondition for baptism in Ephrem’s churches, even
though it optimized “single-mindedness.” The ascetic ideal notwith-
standing, that school of love called marriage was considered lawful and
holy, in the context of praxis and contemplation.
“The Angels,” wrote Ephrem, “have received the gift of virginity

without effort but you on the contrary on the basis of battle.”            The idea

here, to put it crudely, is that since there was no sex in primordial Para-
dise nor is there marriage in heaven, angels are virgins in a world in
which sex has no place. Angels are undifferentiated as to gender. In a
world in which sex is instinct with power to tempt, virginity represents

the ascetic ideal to become angelic.            In the process, one has the poten-
tial to become superior to angels.

Realized Paradise: The Robe of Glory originates in primordial time. It
is reinvested in eschatological time. It is acquired in historical time, in its
coincidence with what Brock calls “sacred time,” drawing the inevitable
conclusion: “The life of the baptized Christian should accordingly be that

of a realized eschatology …”.           In a hymn attributed to Ephrem, but of
doubtful authenticity, the “eschatology is certainly ‘realized’,” according
to Murray:

See, you are reclining at the wedding–feast

which is the Holy Church,
and you are eating the living body

and drinking His pure blood.

The Problem of Post-Baptismal Sin: Salvation notwithstanding, it is
possible to forfeit’s one’s lot in Paradise: “Sins before baptism / by simple
work are able to be atoned. / And if the imprint of scars sullies [the
Christian], / baptism whitens and wipes them clean. / But sins after bap-

tism / with double works are able to be overturned.”               Does this indicate

loss of immortality at the substantial level or at the sapiential level?
Here, soteriology stands or falls on its supporting anthropology.

The Substances of Man’s Creation: The Syriac term for “substance” is
qn∞mâ, which varies according to the nature (ky¡nâ) of a thing. Ephrem
states that the Creator “infused into the powdered dust a manifold

spring.”        This spring, a metaphor for the soul, gives life to the dust.
Conversely, in Paradise, “springs of wisdom” are said to burst forth from

the mouths of its dwellers.            This indicates that the substance of Para-
dise is considerably different from that of earth; the constitution of
Paradise is of a separate order altogether. In both earthly and celestial
realms the soul is said to abide. The body, however, will have to undergo
such transformation at the eschaton that the differences in many re-
spects likely outweigh the similarities.
The Substance of Paradise: Paradise, in Ephrem’s vision of it, is, to a

great extent, informed by Jewish concepts.                 But it is not wholly in-
formed by them. Paradise is mountain, towering above all earthly moun-

tains, its underside said to be circular, overarching land and sea              like a
dome. Paradise is, above all, a cosmic mountain, a non-physical yet none-
theless a sarcous environ, at a metaphorical level at least. One of the
challenges of reading Ephrem is having the metaphorical competence to
decode Ephrem wherever this may be warranted, and to accept the rest at
face value.

Kronholm notes on the basis of Beck’s analysis that “Paradise in
Ephrem’s view is not ‘eine rein geistige Grösse’ … nor is it corporeally/

terrestrially material, as is seen in Hymns on Paradise XI.                Elsewhere,
the Swedish scholar states categorically: “The Paradisiacal world is nei-
ther corporeally material, nor spiritually immaterial, but it is constituted

of a spiritual substance, in Ephrem’s view.”              This is obvious from
Hymns on Paradise XI.4: “Let not this description of it [Paradise] / be
judged by one who hears it, / for descriptions of it / are not at all subject
to judgment, / since, even though it might appear terrestrial / because of
the terms used, / it is in reality / spiritual and pure. / Even though the
name of “spirit” / is applied to two kinds of beings, / yet the unclean spirit

is quite separate / from the one that is sanctified.”           This passage is in-
teresting in that it is quite clear that some kind of translation of the
physical being must take place, for Paradise is too rarefied for gross mat-
ter. Elsewhere, Ephrem likens Paradise to the wind, which has “no outer

array or substance at all.”

What is the Robe of Glory and its Substance? Mary, in effect, was the
first to be baptized by Christ, to receive the transforming touch of
divinity: “The Son of the Most High came and dwelt in me, / and I became
His mother. As I gave birth to Him/ —His second birth—so too He gave
birth to me / a second time. He put on His mother’s robe / — His body; I

put on His glory.”          What is “glory”? Of what substance is it? Glory is
light; this is a metaphorical tautology of course. The Robe of Glory is of-
ten called the Robe of Light. Both are references to divinity. Glory and
light represent the Holy Spirit. Hence: “John whitened the stain of sins
with ordinary water, so that the bodies might be rendered suitable for the
robe of the Spirit that is given through our Lord. Because the Spirit was
with the Son, the Son came to John in order to receive baptism from him,

so that He [Jesus] might mix with the visible water the Spirit who cannot
be seen, so that those whose bodies perceive the wetness of the water

might perceive in their minds the gift of the Holy Spirit.”            The Robe of
Glory thus is bestowed in the waters of baptism. It is the equivalent of

the Pauline metaphor of “putting on Christ.”            What effects, then, does
this Robe of Glory have?

Problems inherent in Ephrem’s Soteriology: Often compared to Atha-
nasius’s formula that God became man that man might become God (On
the Incarnation LIV.3), Ephrem gives an epitome of salvation in Hymns
on the Nativity I.97, 99): “The Lord of natures today was transformed
contrary to His nature; / … Today the Deity imprinted Itself on human-

ity, / so that humanity might also be cut into the seal of Deity.”             Patris-
tic doctrines of the¢sis taken together, Wiles explains that when speaking
in terms of divinization, “the Fathers did not intend the parallelism to be
taken with full seriousness.” “The Word,” moreover, “who was fully God,
did not become fully man that he might make us full men becoming fully
God. In speaking of man’s divinization the Fathers intended to convey
that men should become gods only in a secondary sense—‘gods by grace’
(Jeoi kata carin) … ; it was never believed that they would become what

the Word was—namely, ‘God by nature’ (theos kata phusin).”                           C.
Strange states that Wiles has “questioned the need for a fully divine
saviour when the salvation men receive is of grace and not of nature. As
he observed, men become gods only in a secondary sense; they do not be-
come what the Word is. Why should the saviour have to possess a divinity

any different from the one he bestows?”

Wiles’ criticism does not seem to have occurred to the ancient critics
of Christianity, such as Celsus and Porphyry, as the question is Christian

and not pagan. Wiles may be right, but this does not make Ephrem
among the fraternity of Fathers and solitaries wrong. There may be a
soteriological loophole here, the eye of a theological needle through which
the camel of a bedouin Muslim can enter. As to Paradise, perhaps only
Christians populated this once Zoroastrian concept. Paradise, a loan word
from the Persian, relegated Sheol to temporality. But persecution of
Christians at the hands of a Zoroastrian state effectively rendered
irrelevant any question over the fate of a good Zoroastrian non-Christian.

In any event, the Eucharist is an elixir performing an alchemy of
body and soul. The wafer is, as it were, the alchemist’s “orange egg” and
immortality is won. In the ancient concept of the soul being handicapped
if left, literally, senseless, the spiritualization of the inner man was co-
terminous with that of the outer man through a spiritual agency. If spirit
has the power to form matter, by the very same logic, spirit has the power
to transform matter.

In this respect, the transformation is complete. Matter is no longer
matter, for Matter no longer matters. As Ephrem states: “And if these
things which are to come are more subtle than the Body in accordance
with the places (in which they are), so it (i.e., the Body) will undergo
change. For that Will which made it gross for the gross purpose which is

here present, made it for that Spiritual abode which is yonder.”                  At
best, its form and functions persist, and even that may in some sense be
metaphorical, bound by the constraints of our language to explain the
ineffable. The following examples will suffice to show that Ephrem, con-
trary to his assertion that the soul’s perceptions are tied to the instru-
mentality of the body, is able to speak of its relative irrelevance:

Obviating Taste: The Hymns on Paradise possess their own “grammar
of images”, so to speak, with gridded ambiguities of images that inter-

lock, giving rise to different levels of interpretation.          In Paradise, for

Livingstone (Berlin: Akademie-Verlag, 1985): 342–346 [343].

instance, the body has no other function than to act as an instrument of
perception, as the locus of the senses. Even so, we can eliminate taste
from the necessary instruments of perception, as the rarefied body in
Paradise does not eat: “but yonder it is souls, instead of bodies, that crave

food.”         Rather, the soul is sustained by “joy” (Hymns on Paradise IX.23).
One of the senses, therefore, is no longer needed: that of taste. In Para-
dise, there is neither material food nor drink (IX.9), as the repast, of an
utterly different order, is spiritual and sapiential. “The teeth do not

weary,”          presumably because they do not chew! Of Paradise, Ephrem
states that “the senses were no longer able / to contain its treasures / so

magnificent they were— / or to discern its savors.”

Obviating the Olfactory Sense: What, then, of the sense of smell?
Paradise is perfumed with fragrances, to be sure, “its scents most won-

derful.”         It may be that it is “adapted” to perceive “wisdom”: “That Gar-

den is / the life-breath / of this diseased world.”           Like Divinity perhaps,
Paradise is both transcendent and immanent. Paradise transcends the
senses, but its vivifying breezes waft into the congregations of the faith-
ful here on earth. By simple elimination, if the sense of smell cannot per-
ceive these breezes, a spiritual organ is the only faculty of perception
that can.

Obviating Physical Sight: To achieve beatific vision, physical sight is
not necessary. Not sight per se, but insight is required. Hence Ephrem
says: “With the eye of my mind (b-<aynâ d-re<y¡nâ) / I gazed upon Para-

dise.”         And, further: “… the sight of Paradise / is far removed, / and the

eye’s range / cannot attain to it.”         The pre-millennial denizens of Sheol,
who presumably live in a discarnate state, are able to gaze on Paradise
from across the “Abyss” (Hymns on Paradise II.12), as was the case with
the rich man and Lazarus at Luke 16:26, as Ephrem is careful to point
out. Presumably this visual acuity has nothing to do with a carnal cornea
and retina, as this state is prior to the Resurrection. At best, the organs
of the senses may be transformed into organs of the soul at the eschaton.

There are doubts about even this, if we take into consideration the
various descriptions of perception in the afterworld that Ephrem paints.
Physical organs of perception, certainly, cannot enjoy the beatitude of

Paradise, as there “carnal desires no longer exist”              not due to resistance
to temptation but rather to its irrelevance to a non-physical domain of
satiety. “For what mind,” avers Ephrem, gazing on Paradise from with-

out, “has …the faculties to explore it?”               “For feeble eyes,” continues
Ephrem in the same vein, “cannot gaze upon / the dazzling sight / of its

celestial beauties.”         And yet, it was with the mind’s eye, and not the
physical eye, that Ephrem was able to gaze on Paradise, in the wake of
his mystic transport while reading Scripture: “The eye and the mind /
traveled over the lines / as over a bridge, and entered together / the story
of Paradise. / The eye as it read / transported the mind; / in return the
mind, too, / gave the eye rest / from its reading, / for when the book had

been read / the eye had rest, / but the mind was engaged.”                     Ephrem’s
rationale for the resurrection of the body is that the soul depends upon
the body, as the locus of the senses, for perception. Yet the physical
senses of ocular vision, taste and smell are, as demonstrated above, es-
chatologically obviated. The eschatological relevance of the senses, on the
one hand, is affirmed by Ephrem but, on the other hand, such senses are

circumscribed: “My eye indeed remained outside, but my mind entered

within.”

One does not see in Ephrem any dependence upon his elder
contemporary Aphraha†. Otherwise, we might have seen in Ephrem a
more pronounced concept of what the Persian Sage variously referred to,
in the chart below, as:

Aphraha†, in Demonstration XIV, in describing the wonders of cre a-
tion, speaks of what can be accepted as the Syriac counterpart to the
Greek idea of the spiritual senses: “The wings of understanding are
spread out, / and the wings of thought are unfolded, / and the senses of
the intellect are exploring, / and the eyes of the conscience are contem-
plating / and the pupils [of its eyes] roam to and fro / so that the investi-
gation may be known to sight and to knowledge / while not comprehend-

ing their limits.”         This concept contextualizes the Syriac Liber Graduum
when it speaks of the “organs within” or talks of the “organs of the soul”
(vide supra), and thus we find Ephrem speaking of the “inner senses of

thoughts” in Hymns on Faith IV.6.               If Ephrem concedes the existence
and functionality of such senses, why not their relative autonomy? This

is a problem that arises in any attempt to systematize Ephrem’s anthro-
pology and the eschatology upon which it is predicated. The present study
proposes one solution: The Hymns on Paradise are crafted in such a way
as to appeal to the more mundane conceptions of afterlife requital more
readily accessible to the common lay Christian, whereas, at a more ab-
stract level of reading, the Hymns may be read as professedly metaphori-
cal, both in terms of Paradise itself and in its allegorical inversion to de-
scribe the status and profundity of the Christian communal life on earth.
It should come as no surprise therefore when Kronholm concludes

that Ephrem’s views on the soul “are not uniform.”              The soul, in contra-
distinction to the beast, is endowed with speech (Carmina Nisibena
XLIV.1). The soul, moreover, has the ability, through the agency of

speech, “to express wisdom.”          It is this sapiential ability that is of such
anthropological importance in the process of the¢sis.

Bodily, Not Physical, Resurrection: Hymn VIII of the Paradise cycle
makes it abundantly clear that the soul cannot function adequately with-
out its companion, the body. Ephrem’s Paradise is not incorporeal. (That
may, however, be immaterial.) There is reason to believe, however, that
the resurrection body and its disports in Paradise are rather of a differ-
ent order altogether. One clue is the nature of Paradise itself. Assuming
the resurrection body will be adapted to its celestial environs, we may
infer that it would not differ fundamentally from the constitution of the
leaves of Paradise. The leaves of Paradise, we are told, “are spiritual” yet

“have taken on bodily form.”            This indicates that the Resurrection is
corporeal in form, but not so in terms of flesh.

If this is an inaccurate assessment, it could at least be said that the
bodily resurrection that Ephrem envisions is substantially different from
physical resurrection. Not only is the sight of Paradise achieved by
insight, the mind’s eye, but the entire resurrection body itself is likened
by Ephrem to the mind: “A hundred times finer / and more subtle / are
the bodies of the righteous / when they are risen, at the Resurrection: /

they resemble the mind …”.             The rarefication of which Ephrem speaks

is of such subtlety that the “spiritual beings” (r∞˙¡nê)             are described as

“so refined in substance that even thoughts cannot touch them!”                   Else-
where Ephrem relates: “Bodies, / with their flow of blood, / receive re-
finement there / after the manner of souls; / the soul that is heavy / has
its wings refined/ so that they resemble/ resplendent thought …. / For
bodies shall be raised / to the level of souls, / and the soul / to that of the

spirit, / while the spirit will be raised / to the height of God’s majesty.”

The Resurrection, therefore, in Ephrem’s conception of it, is not
simply an “arising” in the sense of revivification. It is an “arising” in the
sense of a spiritual ascent, in which the whole tripartite being of man is
“raised” to new life and to new heights. In what manner may we conceive
of this? In this present life, in what really amounts to a realized

eschatology for Ephrem, “the mind … is spiritual”             and it is the mind in
mystic transport, and, at the eschaton, something like the mind into
which the resurrection body is transformed, that can attain the environs
of Paradise and, by the blessing of its Creator, enter into its Garden.
There is in fact the suggestion that the metaphors Ephrem employs for
his portrayal of Paradise may be decoded. From Hymns on Paradise VI.6
and elsewhere, we may thus infer:

As¢mata, Eidic Vision, and “Mixing”: Evidently, Ephrem’s anthropol-
ogy shares certain features with that of Bardaißan, the “Aramaic philoso-

pher” as Ephrem calls him.              In one respect, there may be this affinity:
body and soul are separable, but not soul and spirit, which is hidden in

the soul.         The following table represents the topography of Paradise,

The levels of Paradise correspond with degrees of spiritual
development and perfection. There, the human encounter with things
divine is vivid and immediate. One gets the impression, inter alia, that
although the necessity of the body is formally recognized by Ephrem, in
practice the body is an appendage that must be radically rehabilitated to
adapt itself to the clime of the sublime. In the heights of Paradise, the
soul is sustained, as it were, intravenously. Its apprehension is direct, in
what can best be metaphorically understood as an implicit, Origenistic
duplication of the external senses to describe the operation of faculties of
cognition in the inner recesses of the soul. These faculties may be ar-
rested in an aborted embryonic state in the unsaved person. With no debt
to Origen intended, Ephrem’s eschatological anthropology may be de-
scribed as eidetic and transfigural.
“The assembly of saints,” writes Ephrem, “bears resemblance to

Paradise.”          Of greater moment, by contrast, is the resemblance of Para-
dise to the Church, where the metaphors of Paradise are inverted, serv-
ing as an allegory for the Church. Ecclesiastically, the zigguratic ascents
of the cosmic Mountain refer primarily not to the terraced levels the
Paradise itself, but rather to the Church: “The mystery of the levels / of
that Garden of Life / He prefigured in the Ark / and at Mount Sinai. /
Symbols of Paradise / and its disposition he has depicted for us; / estab-
lished, fair and desirable in every way, / in its height and its beauty, / in
its fragrance and variety. / It is the haven of all riches; / in it the Church

is symbolized.”

Conclusions: The Hymns on Paradise purport to give an other-worldly
glimpse into the afterlife. Theses hymns, however, belong more properly
to exegesis than to the genre of apocalypse. No supernatural agency for
this vision served as intermediary. Rather, Ephrem was mystically
“transported” to Paradise during his reading of Scripture.

Nature, of course, everywhere spoke to Ephrem of the hidden God,
the revealed Christ, and of the sanctifying Spirit; but Scripture informed
him of eschatological matters more directly. Ephrem’s Paradise is in-
formed by his views on human nature, and this is where anthropology
may be seen to structure eschatology. The edifying intent of the hymns is
quite apart from these concerns. Rather, it is Ephrem’s ecclesiological
vision that the Hymns on Paradise was meant to inspire.

The trichotomy fundamental to Ephrem’s anthropology allowed for
Syriac mysticism to speak of progress along somatic, psychic and

pneumatic stages.           The doctrine of the¢sis may be seen as a controlling
principle here. Indeed, this soteriology—so prevalent in the fourth cen-
tury—clearly structures, but does not control, Ephrem’s teachings on the
work of Christ.

Deification was effected through chrism, baptism and the Eucharist.

The poet wrote extensively on the efficacy of these mysteries. But
salvation was no guarantor of spirituality. For this, free will took
precedence, as it was possible to forfeit one’s place in Paradise as a
consequence of post-baptismal sin. The eschatological wedding garment
stood in danger of being stained. It was ethical vigilance that maintained
eschatological preparedness.

As we would expect, Christ’s divinity did not minimize his humanity
in Ephrem’s view. This is an important consideration in conserving the
ethical teachings which came to characterize Ephrem’s system which was
in ethical competition with that of Bardaißan. To do so would be so
weaken the effective basis of the divine “economy”— the effective means
of salvation.

It was the purpose of this paper to argue for a shift in emphasis in
Ephrem’s Hymns on Paradise from the belief in physical resurrection to a

\[147\] Vööbus, History of Asceticism in the Syrian Orient III, 329.

doctrine of what might be termed sapiential the¢sis. The argument pre-
sented in this study was difficult and methodologically involved, and had
to be unpacked in a cumulative way. The concept of sapiential the¢sis is
not an attempt to split cumin seeds, as the Romans would say, but rather
an effort to demonstrate the subtle ways in which Ephrem speaks in a
traditionally Semitic vein, yet innovates on the tradition of “the sleep of
the soul” in which the body and soul repose in Sheol until the Resurrec-
tion Day. Ephrem pays lip service to this doctrine, but does not consis-
tently support it.

Ephrem departs from the Syriac tradition of the Sleep of the Soul in
two significant respects: In the hymns, Ephrem indulges in speculation in
which the righteous, awaiting the Resurrection, reside in mansions
outside the environs of Paradise (Hymns on Paradise VIII.11; cf. V.15). A
further innovation by Ephrem is the idea that sinners (presumably, those
who are repentant) may receive chastisement and forgiveness in a kind of
purgatory situate between the Fire and the Garden (Hymns on Paradise
X.14; cf. I.16–17).

Controversy over the immortality of the soul impacts on the
soteriology of the¢sis. If it is conceded that the soul is immortal, there is
then no need for divinization. The power of baptism and the sacraments
to confer immortality is seriously undermined if divested of their elixiric
effect in the alchemy of body and soul. But it seems that Ephrem’s sote-
riology was not entirely predicated on the¢sis. He does not set out to
prove it, nor is he at pains to defend it, though he refers to it frequently.
In so doing, Ephrem simply elaborates on its eschatological consequences.

Divinization in terms of “substance” is one thing, but becoming godly
is quite another. The doctrine of the¢sis was a fourth-century given. For
Ephrem, immortality was not so much at issue. Christ had assured the
rewards of Paradise. Ephrem was concerned to present Paradise in a
homiletic light. Rather than drawing on Nature as a point of departure
for homily, as so often happens in medieval preaching, Paradise serves as
the natural setting of matters spiritual, upon which a homily may be con-
structed. Aphraha†’s description of the wise man, in Demonstrations 14,
the realized eschatology of which is patent, could easily fit the scheme of
Ephrem’s Hymns on Paradise: “He is a great palace for his Maker: / the

King of the heights comes and dwells in him, / raises his mind to the
heights / and makes his thoughts soar to the sanctuary, / revealing to him
treasures of all kinds …. / The Watchers hasten to serve him / and the
Seraphs cry ‘holy’ to his glory, / flying with their swift wings, / their gar-
ments white and resplendent, / veiling their faces from his splendour, /
rushing swifter than the wind …. / His form and appearance are on earth
/ but his mental senses are above and below. / His thought is swifter than
the sun, / his insights flash faster than the wind, / swift as on wings in

every direction.”          On this passage, Murray concludes that Aphraha†
“does not spell out what his words imply” and that “it is only towards the
end of the passage that its relevance becomes clear”: to wit, “Aphraha† is

holding up cosmic order as a model for order in the Church.”               The same
thing may be said of Ephrem’s intent in the Hymns on Paradise.

Ephrem’s teachings on the afterlife stands midway between the
underdeveloped Jewish concept of Sheol and Bardaißan’s refutation of
bodily resurrection. Against Gavin’s dichotomous picture of soul-sleep
and resurrection with only suspended animation in between, Ephrem has
created a hiatus in eschatological time where in the souls of the righteous
enjoy proximity to Paradise and are, evidently, conscious. (As said before,

this appears to be an Ephremic innovation.)              External witness for this
concept may be found in Theodoret of Cyrrhus, in his description of the
ascetic who was a namesake of Aphraha†: “May I enjoy it even now, since
I believe him to be alive, to belong to the choir of angels, and to possess
familiar access to God even more than before; … now that he has shed

the burden of the passions, he enjoys, as a victorious athlete, familiar

access to the Umpire.”

To free this single witness from its splendid isolation, the testimony
of the pilgrim Egeria may also be adduced. During her pilgrimage (c.
381–384?) just a few years after Ephrem gave up the body, Egeria visited
Edessa in the course of her itinerary, and was shown a portrait of King

Abgar (a mosaic portrait of whom has recently been discovered).                   Of
this monarch who embraced the Christian faith, the bishop of Edessa is
recorded by Egeria as saying: “The look on Abgar’s face showed me, as I
looked straight at it, what a wise and noble man he had been, and the
holy bishop told me, ‘That is King Abgar. Before he saw the Lord, he be-

lieved in him as the true Son of God’.”           If this statement accurately re-
flects the Christian Orient in the fourth century, we see that between
soul-sleep and body-rising is the conscious spirit enjoying beatific vision.

The consequences of this testimony are far-reaching. Prior afterlife
concepts and Christian preoccupation with the¢sis largely determined the
form and overt content of Ephrem’s soteriology. While basically faithful
to the soul sleep/resurrection scenario, Ephrem does not deprive the
righteous of Paradise of even a single eschatological moment, be it real-
ized or actual. By means of this apparent innovation, the shift in empha-
sis in Ephrem’s towards more ethical and sapiential considerations is
seen. Christianity can then be presented as progressive sanctification
within a traditional scheme of the¢sis. The body, literally, becomes lost in
thought!

Ephrem is conditioned but not constrained by a propositionally-
controlled system of belief. A distinction obtains between theological and
mystical formulas of faith. Church policy was established by successive
synods of bishops. To be sure, Nicea held sway over Ephrem, the Council

which he refers to as the “excellent synod” (Hymns Against Heresies

XXII).         In terms of Christology, McVey shares the observations of sev-
eral of her peers in noting that Ephrem’s language of “mixing” of divine
and human natures in Christ “would be problematic for post-Chalcedo-

nian Christology.”

Paradise shares the same role as Nature for homiletic purposes. The
Syrian poet deftly transferred Paradise imagery to earth and set up the
Church as a rival to Paradise! The comparison is explicit; conceptually,
nothing is lost in translation here: “More fitting to be told / than the
glorious account / of Paradise / are the exploits of the victorious / who
adorned themselves / with the very likeness of Paradise; / in them is
depicted / the beauty of the Garden. / Let us take leave of the trees / and
tell of the victors, / instead of the inheritance / let us celebrate the

inheritors.”          This is more than homily; it is realized eschatology.
Ephrem’s very vision of Paradise attests to its susceptibility to realiza-
tion, to which “both worlds” (refrain, Hymns on Paradise XV) are invited.
For Ephrem, the irreducible physicality of the body is not its bones, but
rather its form. Ephrem’s Paradise resurrects the form of the body but
not its gross substance, and predicates Paradise-worthiness on an ethical
advancement that would rival that of any Bardaißanite. In this respect,
Ephrem recalls Origen who, in affirming the Resurrection, states that

the “initial substratum [of the body] will not rise”            and that the conti-
nuity of the body is to be seen in its essence, considered to be its form

(eidos). The fact that “not a bone will remain in Sheol”                need not pre-
sent a problem here. Where bone turns into stone, fossilization preserves

the skeletal form. Resurrection, in Ephrem’s portrayal of it, is not com-
mitted to recalcification.
The Hymns on Paradise cycle is, in effect, a double allegory. Like the

Qur>¡n, as Beck’s earlier studies          have shown, Ephrem paints Paradise
in vivid earthly terms, where the most delectable delights of the natural
world provide all the elements for an extended metaphorical transference
to the celestial realm. In turn, the delights of Paradise are transformed
by Ephrem into an allegory for the spiritual life on earth such that the
holy life, and not Paradise itself, becomes the most cherished reward of
the saint. “Paradise,” writes Ephrem, “lauded the intellect” and “the
flowers [of Paradise] gave praise to virtuous life,” while the “fruits of the

righteous were more pleasing to the Knower of all.”              The atmosphere,
as one ascends the mountain of Paradise, becomes more and more rare-
fied, such that: “Bodies, / with their flow of blood, / receive refinement
there / after the manner of souls; / the soul that is heavy / has its wings

refined / so that they resemble / resplendent thought.”                And, further:
“… but if it be joy / which inebriates and sustains, / how greatly will the
soul be sustained / on the waves of this joy / as its faculties suck / the

breast of all wisdom.”

In the Banquet of Paradise, which is the subject of Hymn IX, the
“breast of all wisdom” sustains the “faculties of the soul”—this is
sapiential the¢sis. If “we are what we eat”—as the adage goes—when

Ephrem tells us that God shall impart “His wisdom to our tongue,”                   on
which “gift” the inhabitants of Paradise are said to “ruminate,” the whole
being is here pictured in sapiential terms. “From their mouths,” says
Ephrem of the denizens of heaven, “there burst forth … springs of wis-

dom.”        Here, in language that Ephrem in Hymn XI stresses is meta-
phorical, “springs” is the image. “Wisdom” is the reality.

In Hymn VIII, Ephrem, in no uncertain terms, reaffirms the
eschatology of Resurrection. The body is said to be necessary for the
soul’s perception. But the more Paradise is described further on in the
hymn cycle, the more it becomes clear that the body is increasingly
irrelevant, even to the point of being marginalized. The “faculties of the
soul” begin to take over, as the bodily senses are in every way obviated. It
is as if the doctrine of corporeal resurrection was itself transitional,
beyond which a higher reality obtains. Body is rarefied to the level of
soul; the body becomes sapiential. The body is, when all is said and done,
a chrysalis. The butterfly emerges in the last half of the Hymns on
Paradise.

A distinction obtains between form and reality. Consider the leaf of
Paradise, as a “bodily” object. Its essence is “spiritual” though it has
assumed “bodily form”. These celestial leaves “have been changed,”

Ephrem continues, “so that their vesture may resemble ours.”               Where
“yonder it is souls, / instead of bodies, that crave food” (IX.18), where “the
soul receives sustenance / appropriate to its needs” (IX.18), where soul
food, as it were, “is the very fragrance of Paradise” (IX.17), in which, in

any event, “bodies shall be raised / to the level of souls” (IX.21),             the
pinnacle of spiritual experience is beatific vision, imparted “with flashes
of light” for “the small” and “with rays more intense” for “the perfect”

(IX.25).       In Ephrem’s Hymns on Paradise is found a hierarchy of mi r-
rors, metaphors turned heavenward but refracting earthward. One must
be careful not to confuse the image with the reality that, in any event,
inspires a picture with a thousand edifying Syriac words.

Ecclesial Exegesis: To the extent that Ephrem's interpretation of
Paradise was directed towards the Church, the Hymns on Paradise as

exegesis seem to follow, in an unspoken way, a view if interpretation
akin to the Rules of Tyconius. The Rules of Tyconius, which was the first
hermeneutical treatise in the Latin West, Rules of Tyconius professedly
serve as “pathways of light” guiding one through “vast forest of proph-

ecy.”       This treatise impressed Augustine deeply. In adopting the Rules
of Tyconius as a model and standard for Christian interpretation,
Augustine said of the seven rules: “All of these rules except one, which is
called ‘Of Promises and Law,’ cause one thing to be understood from an-
other, a situation proper to figurative locutions (On Christian Doctrine

III.37).         Though written by a Donatist who wrote in North Africa during
the second half of the fourth century, the text stands on its own merits as
an ingenious interpretive system that kept the church at the heart of all
exegetical activity under its influence. Remarkably, the Rules of Tyconius
are not Christological. Rather, they are ecclesiological.

Ephrem’s Hymns on Paradise is a commentary on the Eden narrative
in Genesis. It was read in an ecclesial light. Soteriologically, Ephrem ex-
alts form over substance in his descriptions of the glorified, resurrected
body. Bardaißan had denied the resurrection of the body, but not of the
soul. Perhaps in response to Bardaißan, and the philosophical speculation
that he so successfully popularized, Ephrem’s Hymns on Paradise struck
a compromise between incorporeal and corporeal doctrines of resurrec-
tion. For Ephrem, the irreducible physicality of the body was not so much
its bones, but rather its form. Each in his own way, both Bardaißan and
Ephrem rejected the impurity of gross physicality. Bardaißan denied the
resurrection of the body; Ephrem transforms the resurrection body and
practically divests it of its physicality.

In treating Paradise as an allegory of the Church, Ephrem has, in
effect, created a “paratext.” The idea that, in certain cases, “exegesis

becomes part of the text itself”            lies behind the neologism, “paratext.”

Here, use of the modern formative “para-” should be fairly self-evident:
the “paratext” of exegesis is the paraphrasable interpretation mentally
read alongside or with the text. In an overarching way, in Ephrem’s medi-
tations on the Eden narrative, the major paratext of Paradise is the
Church.

Paradise and Paradigm: Images and ideas are the twin hemispheres
of the religious mind. The bicameral interaction of the imaginal and the
abstract focus the believer on the archetypes of belief. To give a more
complete description of any religious worldview, concepts should be com-
plemented by conceits. In Ephrem, the Church is imagistically conceived
of as Paradise. Since it is an extended metaphor, its imagery is extensi-
ble. Individually and collectively, paradise imagery can represent differ-
ent facets of church life and experience. The phrase from the Lord’s
Prayer—“on earth, as it is in Heaven”—perfectly expresses both imagisti-
cally and ideologically the Ephrem’s artifice at work in the Hymns on
Paradise.

Ephrem’s Paradise is at once ecclesiastical and eschatological. Its
imagery expresses a paradigm of purity. This is a purity that “cures.” It
cleanses the soul of the “disease” of mortality. It restores primordial
immortality. Life in Paradise, in both worlds, is for the pure. The pure in
heart are Christians who are sexually pure and morally stainless. On
this point, perhaps Ephrem and Bardaißan might agree. In a quote from
Theodore bar Koni, Bardaißan, in one of his lost songs, taught: “And lo,
the natures, all of them—with created things they hastened, to purify

themselves and remove what was mingled with the nature of evil.”           Al-
though Ephrem rejects Bardaißan’s creation myth, the pursuit of ethical
purity in both systems is, in non-ascetic terms, comparable. In fine,
Syriac Christianity’s response to Late Antiquity is the quest for purity, in
which chrism, baptism and the Eucharist become the ointment, fountain,
and elixir of immortality, while the imagery of Paradise ennobles the
sanctified soul.
