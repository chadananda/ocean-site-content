         The Hidden Words of BahÔ£ø‚ÄôullÔ£øh

Amin Banani

Uttered by BahÔ£ø‚ÄôullÔ£øh in 1858 while striding on the banks of the Tigris
near Baghdad and taken down by his amanuenses, The Hidden Words
(KalemÔ£øt-e MaknÔ£øne) is unique among the voluminous BahÔ£ø‚Äô¬• scrip-
tures. It is a collection of brief ethical injunctions and mystical visions:
71 in Arabic and 83 in Persian. In the minds of the early BÔ£øb¬•s, among
whom The Hidden Words circulated in manuscript form, the title con-
nected the Words with the Sh¬•¬• tradition of Mo√üÀõaf-e FÔ£ø‚Ä†eme, a collec-
tion of spiritual cantos that were supposedly whispered in the ears of
Fatima by an angel to console her upon the death of her father, the
prophet Muhammad. No text of these cantos exists today, and it is pos-
sible that it never existed. Thus the tenuous connection with Twelver
Sh¬•¬• traditions in the minds of the early BÔ£øb¬•s is a case of apocryphal
tradition of a text.

It has become customary to categorize the writings of BahÔ£ø‚ÄôullÔ£øh
during the period of his sojourn in Baghdad (1853-63) as ‚Äúmystical‚Äù. A
tacit assumption behind this oversimplified categorization is that
BahÔ£ø‚ÄôullÔ£øh underwent a mental evolution, going through a mystical
phase before becoming a visionary builder of a new world order. Upon
closer scrutiny both the categorization and the assumption it is based
upon prove to be too facile. A major work of this period, a historical-
hermeneutical treatise, The Book of Certitude (KetÔ£øb-e ¬•qÔ£øn, 1862), is
anything but mystical in its clarity of exposition and directness of style.
And The Hidden Words, for all its brevity and the inclusion of certain
allusive, mystical passages, may be seen to contain the germs of
BahÔ£ø‚ÄôullÔ£øh‚Äôs integrated spiritual-ethical, as well as social-political,
model for a future society.

In the Arabic introduction to the KalemÔ£øt-e MaknÔ£øne BahÔ£ø‚ÄôullÔ£øh pro-
vides the key to the manifold hidden facets of this work:

> ‚ÄúThis is that which hath descended from the realm of glory, uttered
> by the tongue of power and might, and revealed unto the Prophets of
> old. We have taken the essence thereof and clothed it in the garment
352                                      Religious Texts in Iranian Languages

> of brevity, as a token of grace unto the righteous, that they may stand
> faithful unto the Covenant of God, may fulfill in their lives His trust,
> and in the realm of spirit obtain the gem of divine virtue.‚Äù1

It is immediately clear that BahÔ£ø‚ÄôullÔ£øh intends to provide a link be-
tween the received wisdom of the past and the moral-ethical impera-
tives guiding modern man. What is timeless in the past is revived in the
present and built upon for the future.

Although this paper focuses primarily on the formal aspects of the
Persian verses of The Hidden Words, some introductory words on the
contents of the whole work are in order. Close analysis of the text
shows that it contains, in highly compressed form, the seeds of
BahÔ£ø‚ÄôullÔ£øh‚Äôs principles for regeneration of the individual and society as
revealed in his later texts. The mystical vision of the human soul attain-
ing its ultimate goal of transcendence is related to the precepts of social
equality, political democracy and economic justice.

Any discussion of the literal form of a sacred religious traditional
text evokes a set of familiar problems. Since the BahÔ£ø‚Äô¬• Faith developed
from the cultural matrix of Islam, one should note the precedence of
this issue in that context. Early debates about the originality of the style
of the Koran led to the concept of eJÔ£øz or the miraculous inimitability.
Taken to its logical conclusion, this concept leads to the perceptually lu-
dicrous and doctrinally untenable conclusion that God is exclusively
Arabophone, but this does not appear to have bothered most devout
Muslims. In marked contrast to this view, and perhaps to forestall any
such tendencies among his followers, BahÔ£ø‚ÄôullÔ£øh makes no claim of
eJÔ£øz for his writings. In fact, in The Hidden Words (Arabic 67) he says
clearly:

> ‚Äú‚Ä¶All that I have revealed unto thee with the tongue of power, and
> have written for thee with the pen of might, hath been in accordance
> with thy capacity and understanding, not with My state and melody
> of My voice.‚Äù2

This may be taken as a definition of revelation in BahÔ£ø‚Äô¬• doctrine as a
form of language comparable to the language of mankind and not to

that of God. It is therefore natural that it should be influenced by human
speech.

Seen in this light the formal roots of some parts of The Hidden
Words, especially those in Arabic, may be found in Islamic homiletic
traditions such as the NaÀõJ al-BalÔ£øge (attributed to Al¬•) and even more
so in the Àòad¬•s-e Qods¬•. It is more difficult generically to isolate the
Persian parts of The Hidden Words and to identify the provenance of
their formal features. While they belong entirely within the cultural do-
main of Persian literature, the overall texture of the work far surpasses
any traditional genre in its complexity, variety and originality. In some
verses of the Persian Hidden Words we can discern an affinity with the
genre of andarz-nÔ£øme (Book of Advice), which has strong precedence
in Sasanian times and may go back as far as the Parthian era; and both
the saJ (rhymed prose) style as well as the aphoristic tone of certain
passages recall the GolestÔ£øn of Sad¬•.

The very opening of the Persian part of The Hidden Words, as Pro-
fessor Frank Lewis has observed,3 reads almost like a catalogue of clas-
sical motifs:

> ‚ÄúO YE PEOPLE THAT HAVE MINDS TO KNOW AND EARS TO
> HEAR!
> The first call of the Beloved is this: O mystic nightingale! Abide not
> but in the rose-garden of the spirit. O messenger of the Solomon of
> love! Seek thou no shelter except in the Sheba of the well-beloved,
> and O immortal phoenix! dwell not save on the mount of faithful-
> ness. Therein is thy habitation, if on the wings of thy soul thou
> soarest to the realm of the infinite and seekest to attain thy goal.‚Äù4

BahÔ£ø‚ÄôullÔ£øh‚Äôs true poetic gift is evident in this passage, not just his musi-
cal handling of the familiar tropes of Persian classical literature, but
also the way in which he imbeds in the subtext of The Hidden Words mo-
tifs that have profound cultural associational resonance for any literate
Persophone. The hodhod (hoopoe) of the Solomon of love immediately
activates a chain of associations with the Conference of the Birds of A‚Ä†‚Ä†Ô£ør
and the corpus of Qe√üÔ£ø al-Anb¬•yÔ£ø‚Äô; as does the mention of anqÔ£ø‚Äô upon
the mountain of QÔ£øf, which resonates with the S¬•morg of both A‚Ä†‚Ä†Ô£ør and
Ferdows¬•. In the 7th Persian verse of The Hidden Words, which begins
with ‚ÄúO Son of Love‚Äù (Ey Pesar-e Àòobb),5 there is an even more resonant
allusion to the merÔ£øJ, the night-journey of Muhammad. Àòobb is the root
of Àòab¬•b, the sobriquet bestowed on the prophet Muhammad, and the
mention of rafraf, cushions [of clouds] evokes the highest level to which
Muhammad ascended. It ends with the startling assertion that by paying
heed to what has been revealed by the pen of BahÔ£ø‚ÄôullÔ£øh one may even go
two steps beyond the terminus of the merÔ£øJ.

> ‚ÄúO SON OF LOVE
> Thou art but one step away from the glorious heights above and
> from the celestial tree of love. Take thou one pace and with the
> next advance into the immortal realm and enter the pavilion of
> eternity. Give ear then to that which hath been revealed by the
> pen of glory.‚Äù6

What is remarkable is the variety, complexity and novelty of the fabric
of the Persian verses, woven of familiar threads. To begin with, despite
a surface similarity of style, they cannot be fitted into any one generic
mold. They range from clear and unambiguous pieces of advice (an-
darz) for living a virtuous, chaste and pious life, to mystical visions of
the human soul transcending the limitations of this life, to symbolic and
allegorical narratives that may have historical allusions, to rhapsodic
passages that are song-like in tone, to stern admonitions to the heedless

rich, the unjust ruler and the thoughtless neighbor. Some are spoken
with the voice of God, some clearly with BahÔ£ø‚ÄôullÔ£øh‚Äôs own voice and
some with an impersonal voice.

The combination of mystical exhortation and practical ethical advice,
which we find in the 3rd Persian verse of The Hidden Words, is also
characteristic of several others and defies the simplistic characterization
of the text as ‚Äúmystical‚Äù. It evokes an otherworldly vision with a sober,
worldly moderation, walking the mystic path with feet, so to speak, still
firmly planted on the ground.

> ‚ÄúO FRIEND!
> In the garden of thy heart plant naught but the rose of love, and from
> the nightingale of affection and desire loosen not thy hold. Treasure
> the companionship of the righteous and eschew all fellowship with
> the ungodly.‚Äù7

In number 5 there is a succinct rule for the cultivation of healthy human
relations.

> ‚ÄúO SON OF DUST
> Verily I say unto thee: Of all men the most negligent is he that
> disputeth idly and seeketh to advance himself over his brother.

Number 18 is one of several of the Persian verses in The Hidden Words
in which BahÔ£ø‚ÄôullÔ£øh makes a not very oblique allusion to his own sta-
tion as the Supreme Manifestation expected by the BÔ£øb¬• community.

Number 19 is an evocation of a mystic gathering and a primordial
covenant.
