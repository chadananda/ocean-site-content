By

AIy object       in the present   essay on the B?b?s      is twofold.
Firstly,    I desire to bring     to the notice of those who are

> interested     in the history of thought generally,    and Oriental
> thought     in  particular,  the results of my investigations     into
> the doctrines, history, and circumstances      of a religious body
which        appears        to me         to     constitute           one     of     the   most          remark

able                          of    the        present

phenomena                                           century.
Secondly, I wish to point out how much still remains to be
done to thoroughly      elucidate  the matter, and to emphasize
the fact that every year which passes will render it more ?and
more difficult to fill in certain important details in the

history
and chronology    of this seet.      I sincerely hope that some,
who       have      the means             and        opportunities     of assisting    in this

> task, may         be induced             to do        so while    it is still possible;   for
there      are               men                        who      can       remember              the     earliest

many                   living
events        of   the B?b?         movement,                  and could             some       of      these        be

to    contribute              accounts           of     those         occurrences               of
persuaded
which    they have reliable knowledge,        and their exact dates,
it would    doubtless    be possible     to compile   from them      ?i

accurate   and    trustworthy   history.   Believing  as
> thoroughly
> I do that B?b?ism     is destined    to leave a permanent mark in
> the world, I feel very strongly how desirable         it is that this
work        should        be accomplished                     ; and        to this     end        I shall put

forward                a chronological

as accurate                sketch of the chief events
connected        this movement

with             as I have been able to compile
from the materials    at my disposal.

I shall also state of what new sources of information            I
have been   able to avail myself,     and point out the most     im
portant  inconsistencies     in tho several accounts   of the B?bis
hitherto published      in Europe and the East.

My desire     is that the chronological     arrangement   which I

suggest may meet with the fullest criticism,    in order that it
may   be amended and corrected wherever     it can be shown to
bo    erroneous.

In the present paper I proposo      to deal mainly   with tho
history   of tho  B?b?s,  and  my personal    experiences  amongst
them in Persia     between    the autumns of tho years 1887 and

1888, leaving an account of their literature        and beliefs for
another       occasiou.

My attention was first attracted          to the subject by a perusal
of the most admirable aud clear-sighted             work of M. le Comte
de Gobineau       (former!  jr  attach?   at   the  French   Legation      in
Teher?n),    entitled       Religions    et   Phiiosoj)hics   dans    l'Asie
Centrale,"   from whose graphic          and vivid description      of the
fust beginnings       and early struggles       of tho B?b?s I derived
more pleasure       than I can describe.         Anxious    to learn more
on the subject,        I sought for other accounts, which           should

inform me of the further progress              of the sect, but to my
disapjxuntmcnt        I could find none ; the history was in no
case continued      beyond     tho year 1852, which was marked by

> the attempted    assassination     of the Shah on the part of certain
> individuals   belonging    to the B?b?     community,      and the
> terrible persecution    of the latter consequent    thereon.     All
> that I could learn was that the sect existed        in secret, and
was believed    to be increasing in numbers.     I therefore deter
mined     that should I ever have an opportunity         of visiting
Persia,    I would make the investigation        of this matter one of
my   chief   objects.

In the year 1887 this much-wished-for              opportunity  pre
sented itself.        I was elected   to a Fellowship     at Pembroke

and it was intimated    to mo that I should

do well to spend some time in travelling     in Persia to acquire
a fuller                 with   tho              which   was mv

acquaintance              language
favourite study.    In the  autumn  of  that   year, therefore,   I
proceeded,     by way of Constantinople           and Trebizonde,      and
thence overland by Erzeroum, Khiiy, and Tabriz, to Teheran,
where I arrived on November            22nd, visiting on my way the
town of Zanjan, so celebrated         in the annals of the B?b?s.
At   first I met with                  but disappointment        in my

nothing
attempts     to penetrate      the mystery       in which     the sect is
shrouded, and I was advised by my Persian                 friends, when
ever I alluded      to the subject, to abstain from                        a

mentioning
name so distasteful        to the government.         After     remaining
two months      and a half in Teher?n,         I had scarcely added to

the information     which    I already possessed       to any material
extent,    and   though    I  had  met    with   people evidently     well
disposed towards the B?b?s, I had not found one who would
avow to mo that he belonged to them, or who would

speak of
them in any but the most guarded manner.

Discouraged     at my ill-success   in this matter,     in February,
1888, I proceeded       to Isfahan, where     at length my hopes
were fulfilled,   and I obtained     the clue which        enabled me,
during   tho  remaining   seven  months   which   1   spent in Persia,
to pursue my investigations    in a manner which exceeded all
that I had hoped.

It befell in this wise.  One day two dall?is, or vendors of
curiosities, came   to show me  their wares. Having   learnt to
my    cost   that   the   inexperienced     traveller    is likely    to be

I was  not          anxious   to
imposed upon by these people,                      very                buy

and  while     we were disputing         about the price of
anything,
some articles,  one of the two men            stepped     up to me and

"    am       a Alusulm?n
whispered    in my   ear,     I      not                     that I should
desire to cheat you ; I am a B?b?."
Aly astonishment       at this frank avowal was only equalled

"

by ray delight,    and   I   replied to him,       If you are indeed a
B?b?, you may, perhaps, be able to assist me                  in obtaining
some books which will tell me about your beliefs."                  Seeing
that I was really anxious         to learn about them, he not only

promised   to do this, but also offered to take me to his house

on the following                  where    I should meet       the chief

Saturday,
B?b? in Isfahan, " for,'' said he, " he visits tho houses of all

'

of us who have believed        in this zuh?r or manifestation/        at
stated intervals, and next Saturday        it will be our turn."

It is needless     to state how gladly I accepted this offer, or
how delighted      I was when on the following          day the dallai,
according   to his   promise, brought   mo    two  B?b?   books, one of

was the Ikcin, an
which                             important work in which an attempt

is made     to prove       the truth of the new dispensation,                  or
"

manifestation,"       to   use   the  B?b?     term.     Of    the   contents
of this I shall have to speak in my next paper, in dealing
with the B?b? literature.

On    the appointed        Saturday      I was instructed          to be in
waiting    at  a  certain spot at      a  certain hour, and to follow one
who would indicate by a sign that he was to be my guide to

the rendezvous.        Acting     according     to these directions,       I was
presently     conducted        to  the   house   of   the   dallai,   and    after
partaking      of   some    tea,  and  waiting     a little while,    a  middle
aged       man,      of    grave      and                                   countenance,                 entered

prepossessing
the room, and was received    by my host with much    respect.

This,  as I soon learned, was one of the chief B?b?s, not only
in Isfahan, but in the whole of Persia ; he does not reside
for long in one place, but travels about from city to city,

> edifying   believers, making    converts   where   possible,   and
> paying an occasional visit to Acre    (lAkk?)  in Syria, which   is
> the present headquarters    of the B?b?s, and the residence of
their spiritual chief, Behd.

This was the only occasion                           on which           I saw this remarkable
man,         as    I had                      to    leave        Isfahan           a few              later         for

fch?i?z,          where     I was          anxious             to arrive          before      the Persian
Nnwrt'tz;           and                this    one       short         interview           I was

during                                                                   naturally
unable to learn much from him.
On hearing that he had been to Acre, I asked him what

"
he saw there, to which he onljr replied,   Ins?i?-r? dida?n dar

"I          saw      a    man         in      tho                             of
f.amiil'i-insdniyyaf,"                                                                      perfection

lie      promised, however,   to write                          to some           of     the principal
B?b?s         at Sh?r?z  to inform them                            of my           desire      to converse

with them, "and," ho added, "these will give you the names
of others in any of tho towns which you may subsequently
visit."

It wasfurther arranged   that I should on the following

"                    "

day   visit  the  graves of  the   Martyrs  of Isfahan     (two
Seyyids who were put to death some eight or ten years ago
for being B?b?s), which is one of the

places of pilgrimage of
their

co-religionists.
Next     day I was accordingly           taken by the dallai to the
great cemetery called          Takht-i-F?lad,"      where we were met

a         man     connected   in   some
by     poor                                   capacity with the place,
who    also proved       to be a B?b?.        After    he had read the

or form of prayer appointed                   to be
ziy?rat-n?ma,                                         by Beh?
used by those                      these graves, which    is           iu

visiting                              partly
Arabic and partly in Persian, he told me that he had become
a B?b?

by reason of a dream, wherein            he saw hosts of
pilgrims     visiting   this  place.

We     then sat down by the graves, which         are marked     only
by a low mound         of earth and bricks        (the Aluhammadans
having destroyed      the tombstones once placed there), and the
dallai proceeded    to givo me an account of the death of these
two martyrs,     known     amongst     the B?b?s      by the titles of
"                         "                                  "

Sult?nu'sh-Shuhad?         (the King   of Alartyrs), and Mahb?
bu'sh-Shuhad?"      (the Beloved    of Alartyrs).

As    this constitutes    one of the most       important  events in
the recent history of the sect, I may perhaps      be permitted

to give a somewhat   full account of it, compiled from what I
heard not only on this occasion, but also subsequently,         in
Sh?r?z, Yezd, and Kirm?n.

I will begin with the account given me by the chief B?b?,
whom I met at Sh?r?z, the fellow-worker      (and for some time
the fellow-exile  at Khartum,  in the Soudan) of him whom I
have just described as the chief of the sect at Isfahan.

He    told me that, shortly before the event we are dis
cussing, he was at Acre, intending    to start for Persia in a
few                   Beh?     was      in   a                 where     he    sometimes

and               informant,     with        two     others,    was                  before       him.

my                                                           standing
Beh?           bade   them     to be seated,            and gave        them      tea.     Then       he

said to them,       A great event will shortly      take place in
Persia."      In tho evening    one of them asked him

privately
where     it would be, and he replied, "In       the land of Sad,"
which is what the B?b?s call Isfahan.         The questioner wrote

this information    to his friends  in Persia,  and his letter is
believed to exist still, but I have not seen it.

On the arrival of my informant at K?sh?n,        on his way to
Isfahan,       news
came of the                   of the two B?b?

martyrdom
Seyyids, H?j?  Mirza  Hasan and H?j? Mirza Huseyn,        and he
at once recognized   this to be the fulfilment of the prediction.

Their death had been brought        about in this way.   They
were merchants     of considerable  wealth and great integrity,
amongst        whose      debtors      was

a mulla     of Isfahan       called
Shejkh    B?kir,         who     owed    the
them

sum  of   10,000   t?m?ns
(about ?3000).      They began     to press him for payment, and
he, anxious      to avoid   this, went      to the Imam        Jum'a of
Isfahan,   and    denounced    them    as  B?b?s,  also    laying great
stress on their wealth.       The two then went          to the Zill-i
Sult?n,   the Shah's eldest son,                who was at that time governor
of Isfahan, and represented                    their case to him.   He replied

> that he could not put them                     to death merely   on account of
> their being B?b?s, but that                    if they, as the representatives
of Islam, gave a fatv? for their execution,         he would not
hinder its being carried out.

The  two mujtahids      thereforo  collected   seventeen     other
members of tho 'ulam?, and signed the death-warrant            of the

two Seyyids,    who were cast into prison. When            this was
known,   efforts were made   by  some of   the European     residents
in Isfahan,           whom     tho                were   known   and

by                    prisoners                        respected,
> to obtain their release, and telegrams were sent to his Majesty
> the Sh?h praying him to stop tho execution     of the sentence.

> The remand was sent, but arrived too late. The two Seyyids,
having been offered their lives on condition      of renouncing

their creed, and having    refused  to do so, had their throats
> cut ; their bodies were then dragged         through   tho streets
> and bazaars of Isfahan,    and finally  cast  under  an  old mud
wall outside the city, which was then overthrown      on them.
That night, when all was quiet, an old and faithful     servant

TUE B?B?S OF PERSIA.                              491

of tho murdered men came in secret and removed the bodies
from under tho ruins of the wall, which         had so fallen as to
cover without    crushing     them.  He    then  reverently     washed
them, cleansing     the   blood   from   the  gaping wounds,        and
placed  them  in  two  ready-made    graves,  which   he  filled  in.
In the morning,   the soldiers             that they had been

discovered
moved, and tried   to  intimidate the old servant into revealing
their last resting-place, but he refused to do this, asserting
that he had buried them out in the llaz?r Derc.

Soon after this a terrible letter came from Acre      to Sheykh
B?kir,    threatening     him with God's    vengeance.      Shortly
afterwards ho got into trouble, and wa9 requested       to retire to
Kerbel?.     On his return      thence to Isfahan    he was over
whelmed     with    troubles, both domestic   and pecuniar}';     his
daughter disgraced   him ; his wife proved unfaithful        to him ;
and ho finally died miserably.

The Imam Juma had, it is said, on witnessing         some hesita
tion on the part of the executioner       in slaying     the victims,
placed  his hand  on  his neck and  said,   "If   there   be any sin,
let it be on my neck."

After  the execution    he too fell into disgrace, and retired
to Mush-had,  where he was attacked with abscesses         in the
neck, and returned     to Isfahan        to die there ; and thus

only
were     the martyrs avenged.

The     stress which I have       laid on the various predictions           or

prophecies     of Beh?     in connection       with    these   events, may     be

proof    of    their    religion.     Amongst       many     others  I may
mention,     of tho earlier ones, the prediction              of the down
fall and death of M?rz? Taki Khan,                the first Prime Minister
of the present         Shah, by whose          advice    tho Bab was put

to death at Tabriz          in July, 1850;      the former event taking
place    a  little   more      than   a   year after the latter.       This
prediction     is ascribed

by Gobineau     to some of the sufferers
of Zanjan.                                 the B?b? heroine     and

Again, Kurratu'l-'Ayn,
poetess, who  was   put    to death   in   1852,  is   said to have

told Mahm?d   Khan,    the Kal?ntar,    in whoso house she had
been confined previously      to her execution,      that he would
shortly   be  killed,   which  actually   occurred,    according   to
Kazeni   Beg,    in   18(51. This prediction     is also mentioned
by Gobineau,     and I have heard from one who was himself
acquainted    with Mahm?d       KJi?iij and who had the story
from him, that in like manner      she foretold the circumstances
of her own death      the day before its occurrence.

Amongst     later  predictions,    namely     those given by Bch?, I
may mention,     besides    those   already   referred    to, that of tho
downfall   of Napoleon        III.,   and   the   Franco-German      war,
said to have been foretold about 18G3, which a B?b? at Yezd
assured me      that ho had    read four    years   before   those   events
took place.

Besides    these, the downfall    of Sultan   'Abdu'l~*Azht          tho
death   of 'Ali P?sh?    away from his native countrjr, and             the
assassination    of the Turkish ministers     who were killed            by
Cherkez Hasan,       are all said to have been foreshadowed          by
Beh?,  and manjr of those B?b?s who                 have been much at
Acre relate instances of verbal warnings            of impending events
and dangers in their own cases.

As    instances   of the latter, the following,    which     I heard
from   one of the two B?b? missionaries         to whom     the events
occurred, may be taken as typical.

They were      returning    to Persia  from Acre,     by way of
Diy?r Bekr, Mosul,       and Rawaudiz,   carrying   with   them some

TUE BABIS OF PERSIA.                            493

B?b?       books     and

documents.     Before    starting   they received
instructions   to the effect that, so soon as they crossed the

over to
Persian  frontier,   they were at once to hand these

some trustworthy     person  to  convey   them    to Tabriz, and on
no account to           them   themselves.    Without      in the least

keep
understanding     the object of this command,   they nevertheless
obeyed it literally, and on reaching So?ch Bul?k, and learn

a certain B?b? merchant     was there, they sent a note
ing that
to him telling him that they desired to see him on important
business.   Ho understood, and came out to them, and the three
walked       away      together       in silence till they had left tho town.
Then    they         sat down               a stream,   and the missionaries,
telling   tho merchant                the orders they had received, handed
over the books and         papers    to him.     These he took, and

with   some trepidation,       to convey       them
promised,     though
to Tabriz.    Next    day   the  two  missionaries      continued     their

and stripped of everything         that they had except their shirts
and drawers.      Had the books been with them, they too would
have been          lost.

The following    is a narrative   of another event which     I
have  on   the   same              as the last, my   informant and

authority
his fellow-worker      being, as before,   the actors therein.   It
occurred about the year 1866, when Beh? was at Adrianople,
before   he was sent to Acre, and they had been visiting him
there   for a while.     On leaving,            were    instructed     to

the sect, but before starting          had   been  told  on no account

to            with         him   on   the   voyage.   As   before,

speak                                                           they   obeyed,
without     understanding,        their orders.      They      reached Cairo
safely,   and occupied      themselves     in  instructing    and   encourag
ing     their   co-religionists,       quieting      dissensions      amongst
them, and conversing             with    such Persians        and others     as
came to them to learn about their doctrines.                    The Persian
Consul tried to prevent          this, and failing      to do so, he invited

the two missionaries    to his house, saying   that ho wished     to
hear about their religion,     of which  ho had been unable to
obtain accurate accounts.                        went, suspecting

Consul   on                                                   com

religious matters.     Suddenly   the Consul
manded    his servants   to seize them, and confine them in a
room in his house.     He    then sent other servants   to search

them      or six B?b? books which
five                                  had  found   there.

Next  day he laid the matter before Isma'll P?sh?,    informing
him that these two men were

confessedly B?b?s, dangerous

Isma'?l P?sh?       had the books in question        laid before the

At   Khartum         they      remained    for   about   seven   years,   and
were    for    some   time     unable   to   communicate    with             con

Beh?,

cerning whom, indeed, vnguo rumours reached them that he
had been removed        from Adrianople       to some other place,
which    they finally learnt  from    some  Protestant   missionaries
with whom they made                     was

friends,        Acre.     By means       of
these they were further enabled to send a letter there, aud in
answer to this a letter was written                                them

by Beh?, consoling
in their exile, and telling     them that they would       shortly bo
released and rejoin him at Acre, and that thoir oppressor,

Isma'?l  P?sh?, would soon fall from power.          This letter was
brought    to Khartum   by  an  Arab  named    Jdsim, who took six
months    to reach it. At that time      the  exiles saw no hope of
release,   but, shortly   after, General     Gordon     arrived, and
findiug these Persians   imprisoned      there enquired what their
crime was.    They replied   that they did not know, as they
had never been tried or given        an                  of meeting

opportunity
their accusers.    On hearing       this, General      Gordon    tele

graphed         to Isma'?l

P?sh?,    demanding   the reason of their
and  exile, and, receiving no  satisfactory reply,
imprisonment
ordered tho B?b?s to bo released, and gave them permission
to go whorever     they pleased.    My informant and his com
panion   returned   to Acre,  and once more, as foretold,    stood

iu  the presence    of Beh?.      The other exiles preferred  to
remain   at Khartum,     where they married and settled.

The narrator of these events I met at Sh?r?z, whither         I
proceeded    on   leaving   Isfahan,  and where   I remained  for
about three weeks.    There,   thanks to the letter which    had
been written  about me from Isfahan, and another fortunate
chance, I saw a great deal of the B?b?s ; and, sometimes        iu
their bouses,   sometimes    in the beautiful  gardens    which

surround  the city, and which     alone render it worthy of all
the praises bestowed     upon  it by Hafiz    and a host of other
poots, I used  to sit with  them  for  hours, hearing  their books

to   their        anecdotes          or                      and    discuss
read,    listening                                              arguments,

ing their doctrines.

By the kindness          of these friends I obtained            two manu
scripts   of   the  utmost    value    for   further   investigation.       One
of theso was tho "Lawh-i-A/cdas,"                or "Most

Holy Tablet,"
which may bo described            as tho KurVin of the B?b?s.1              It is

a small              written     in           and
quite              volume,                  Arabic,         summing up the
doctrine     in its essentials, with regulations concerning prayer,
the fast, the division of the year, marriage,               inheritance,      the
punishment       of   crime,   and   other   matters.     I  hope     to give a
more      detailed    accouut       of     its   contents        on   a future      occasion.

1More mature consideration  has made me regret having                     used this term, owin:r
to its ambiguity, and the number of B?b? works to which                       it has been applied, as
will be pointed out in my second paper.

The  other book was a voluminous manuscript              of the earlier
history of tho sect in Persian.             The author implies that he
was not a Persian,        but a Frenchman           who was travelling          in
Persia,     and who, having witnessed          the persecutions        inflicted
on the B?b?s,        and their fortitude,          was desirous       to learn
more about them.                      succeeded       in             and     con

his investigations. None of the B?b?s, however, believe that
the author wras anything   but a Persian,      and somo of them

informed me who ho was, for he is no longer alive.          Tho
history only extends down    to  tho   events   of the year 1850,
viz. the              of the B?b    at  Tabriz,   and tho "seven

martyrdom
martyrs"    at Teher?n.    Tho important       events of 1852 are
not included in it. The author                    refers to a second

volume, which     he intended   to write     if ho lived, but un
fortunately  ho did not accomplish his purpose.

At         Sh?r?z     I    61XW some         of   the   relations         of     the   B?b,     who        aro

meaning
sion, the B?b? courier, a taciturn old man, who enjoys the
title of Sheykh.      I subsequently    learned     sonic particulars

him  which   I think  are of sufficient interest to bo
concerning
recorded.     He visits the south of Persia     (Sh?r?z, Isfahan, and
Yezd)    once  a year, going from     town   to   town collecting    the
letters which                  are to be forwarded                  to Acre,            and distributing

tions.   The north of Persia       is similarly visited   by another
courier.   The Sheykh, having        accomplished   this distribution
and collection     of letters, times his journey so as to reach
Bushire        somo few weeks before the

beginning of the month of
Z?l-llijj?,       and goes thence with   the pilgrims to Jedda and
Mecca.         From       thence he proceeds        to Acre, after the rites
of-the               are                 and       remains there about two

Hajj            accomplished,
months    ; after which he returns               by land to Mosul,    where
lives an important         personage    amongst     the B?b?s, whose
business     it is to revise carefully     all copies of the sacred
books, to see that they are accurate before they are sent out
for distribution.       There     the Sheykh    remains   for about a
month,    after   the lapse  of  which  he  returns  by way of Bagh
dad and Bushire       to Persia.     In his land journeys he always
goes on foot, carrying        his packets of letters on his back in
a sort of wallet,     after the manner      of Persian K?sids.    For
food,     a few  onions and a piece of bread suffice him.                lie
walks    generally    out  of   the  beaten   track, to avoid     meeting
people who might         recognize    him. At night        he sleeps      in

or other places outside towns and                     unless
> graveyards                                             villages,
> it be at a place where       there are B?b?s, when he sometimes
> stays with them. His fear of being recognized              is not imagi
nary.    On   one  occasion   he  was                   some     one in a

The    Sheykh  accordingly     found himself   locked up to await
the arrival of his inquisitors.    The only thing which troubled
him was that his wallet was filled with            letters from the
B?b?s to their chief at Acre.        If these were discovered    the
writers would be known, and might get into trouble.           There
was no fire, and it was impossible       to bury them, so he pro

ceeded       to   chew    them    up   and   swallow   them.   This   was    no

> light task, as they were very numerous, and amongst        them

his     task beforethe arrival of the Kcdkhud?        and his attend
ants,  and   though   these proceeded   first   to question  and then
to beat him, in order to make         him confess, he stubbornly
declined   to make any declaration,     so that they were eventu
ally compelled    to release him. On another occasion, the ship
in which he was going from Bushiro            to Basra was wrecked,
and      all    on board              were      lost

except himself   and a dervish,
who     escaped by clinging      to some  planks,  and were picked
up   after  fourteen  or fifteen hours.
At Sh?r?z also I first saw specimens of the new                 of

writing
the H?b?s.      It must not bo supposed that this is at all gen
erally used, either in their books, or letters; for it is only
known     to a very few.      I regret to say that I did not secure
any specimens       of it, neither   did I learn to read or write it.
It is written   from left to right, and the letters are separated
from one another.       Each one consists essentially     of an oblique
straight   line running     downwards     to the left, like  the down
ward strokes in copy-books.           To this are appended various

thin curved    lines and hooks which particularize          the letter.

This writing       is intended     for a time when     B?b?ism     shall
become    the state religion of some country.        It is called by th?
B?b?s    Kliatt-i-Badi',**   and there   are several varieties of it.

There are also seals with a particular           device cut in cor
nelian which are used by some members               of the sect.    This
device consists of a vertical       straight    line with a hook at
either         end        turned   to the left, which  is crossed by three
horizontal              lines, also with curves at both ends.    The upper
and       lower          of these latter have also at each end an affix

the    soft    h                              or     ha-t/i-dii-chashml).

I may  here mention     one or two other customs of the B?b?s,
though     I  only  discovered   some of them at a later date.

Firstly,     their salutation.    In mixed    society they of course
use the                                "

ordinary    Aluhammodan       es-seldmu     'alcykum'* (peace
be     upon                   to which       tho   answer          is, "ra       'aleykumn           's-scldm"

you),
(and upon               you      be peace).            But    amongst              themselves,            when

are     sure         that    no                     are                       their        salutation
they                                       strangers                 present,
is "Alldhu              ablu?** (God is most                  bright), and               tho answer               is
the same.               In the Beyan, which                    is the book               of Al?rz?               'AH

Muhammad        the B?b,    the salutation    was different       in the
cases of men and women.         The former were commanded               to
say    All?hu  Akbar"    (God   is most   great),   the   answer  being
(t               "
All?hu a'zam      (God is most mighty).         The latter were to

u
say All?hu      q/mal" (God is most beautiful),           the answer of
which was "All?hu        abh?"    (God is most bright).         The last

> of these is, as I have said, the only one used now, probably
out of respect    to the present head of the

religion, for Behd
and Abh? come from the same root.

Secondly,   their fast is not in Ramaz?n,             but during       the
nineteen days preceding         the Nawruz,     or Persian New Year's

> day, which    is the first day of the first of the nineteen months,
of nineteen    days each, of which          their year consists.       Five
intercalary days,   corresponding      to   the  five  days  called   G?t?

are placed before the month of fasting,

not at present               insisted on that the B?b?s should ob

> desired to abolish divorce, and, as far as possible, polygamy,
> as well as to allow fuller freedom to women, and grant them
admittance     into society ; but at present       these reforms have

met   with   partial success, though     I have  on rare occasions
only
met B?b? women         in general assemblies.

In Turkey     I am informed that the B?b?s may be recog
nized          their   appearance.             wear    tho   Turkish    fez,

by                           Thoy
> surrounded  by a small white  turban, and the jubb?* as a

> hair to grow below the level of their ears, discarding the

zulf generally worn by Persians.               Iu Persia,    however,          these
distinctions  arc not observed.

I have often heard       it said by thoso who were not B?b?s,
that members of this sect are able to recognize each other by
some sign. After        careful inquiry I have come to tho con
clusion     that this, like many      other statements  made   about
them, is only true to a very partial extent.

Some of them say that they can recognize one another by
"             "                             "

alfection     (maliabbat), or by the        light in their faces,"

but    the greater number agree that mutual recognition               is only
possible    by   conversation.     Of    this latter    fact   there    is no
doubt; not only have they a different manner                 of looking at

things to the Muhanimadans,          but likewise they often employ
words and phrases which are not used, or less frequently used,
by the latter. One of these is the word              zuh?r" (manifesta
tion),   which    with   them    bears   somewhat      the sense of the
word "dispensation"            in the mouths       of our theologians.
Thus they speak of the B?b? movement                as "In zuh?r"         (this
manifestation),       and similarly     they call former        revelations

> zuh?r?t-i-kab/."

The word "mazhar," which means "place of appearance,
or manifestation,"      is much used by them.             Thus     they will
s;iy, speaking    of Kurratu'l-'Ayn,         whom     they    call  Jen?b-i
T?hir?     (Her Excellency           the   Pure),   "Mazhar-i-Jcn?b-i
Fdtima-ast      (She is the place-of-manifestation          of Her Excel

lence F?thna),   while    they will    say of  one of  their  persecutors,
or    Mazhar-i-Yazhlast"                        is   the
Mazhar-i-Slnmrast,"                                                 (He

place-of-manifestation        of Shi tur or Yazid).

It is perhaps      easier for a Christian         to recognize    a B?b?
when    he meets    him    than      a

for Muhammadan;             partly  because
the B?b?s are less afraid of disclosing              their tenets in such
a case ; partly because         they are, as a rule, friendly          to the
Christians, whom they do not, like            the   strict Muhammadans,

as impure ("najis");         partly because they frequently
regard
have a xery considerable          knowledge       of the Gospels,      which

they will try     to  prove that
> they will quote, and from which
> their religion is true, and that the promised              coming         of Christ
was   fulfilled in the B?b or Bch?.

At Taft, through which        I passed on my way from Sh?r?z
to Yczd,   I recognized    a B?b? in this way.       He   first asked
me whether I were a Christian,          and,  on my replying     in the
affirmative, he questioned     me   concerning   the signs of Christ's
coming.     Then he remarked,          Perhaps He has come," and
presently    asked me,     Has    the news of this zuhur reached
you?"

At Yezd, as at Sh?r?z, I remained      three weeks, and there
too saw much     of the B?b?s.     I had been       informed    that
B?b? ism was spreading     amongst      the  Zoroastrians,   which

> seemed   very surprising,  considering     how long they hud

tion,    oppression,         and                      However,         after    much         inter

course   with   the Zoroastrians  of Yezd     and Kirm?n   for the
space of three months       and a half or more, I came to the
conclusion    that, though not a few of them were very well
disposed    towards    the B?b?s    (probably    in great measure
because the latter are not only much more toleraut of other
religions   than the Aluhammadans,      but likewise    recognize
Zoroaster as a prophet),  few if any had actually adopted the
B?b? creed.

Yezd bears the official title of "Bdru'l-'tbddat,** or "Abode
of worship,"      and it deserves     this name ; for the Aluham
madans, Zoroastrians,        and B?b?s of that ancient city are all

> characterized    by a greater degree of zeal and strictness       in

my    return   thither    on my  homeward     journey, are also very
notable   for their learning and piety.

The    Aluhammadans       often    accuse   the B?b?s                                (of whose
doctrines    they  are  usually    quite   ignorant)  of                           immorality,
communism,              and                                ;     and   several

wine-drinking                                          European
writers       have                      these     accusations.         Now       with

lax about    this matter;      certainly    at   least as much     so as the
B?b?s.

With   regard       to communism, it appears from the statements
of some writers       that this has been imagined   to be one of the

essential   features of B?b?ism,     as though   the latter were a
political rather than a religious movement.                 This might also
be inferred from 6ome of the statements                     of the Persian
historians     and others.     Thus      Air. Stack,     in his admirable

> and instructive book entitled "Six Alonths in Persia," quotes
> the following     remark made to him by a Persian gentleman                     :

Wo,     too, have our Nihilists,       and they arc called B?b?s by
us."     So also the author          of     tho Persian      history     called
Krisiklin't- Tau tinkh represents         their doctrines       as resembling

Concerning
gentleman    at Sh?r?z said to me:     "I like the B?b?s because

Their liberality   in helping   one another  is so well known that

on it, and

pretending   to be B?b?s, so as to avail themselves
of the open-handedness     of rich members    of the B?b? com
munity.
With     regard   to tho accusations        of immorality brought
against them, which,     as the  wrriter  of    the article "B?b?      in

the new Encyclopaedia      Britannica       observes,     "seem  to  be
founded solely on the misconduct          of particular members       of

the sect," they doubtless arose partly from tho false assertions
oi% the author of tho K?sifcfiu't-laudrikh         and others that, ac

> cording  to tho B?b? religion, a woman was allowed to have

new
monly observed in history to traduce and malign               religions,

the tenets of which are imperfectly      understood     owing to the
secrecy necessarily     observed   concerning     them.     It will be
remembered       that precisely  similar accusations      were made

against    the early Christians,   probably    for similar reasons.
Of course I do not mean to imply that individual members
of the sect may not be guilty of immoral actions, for amongst
those who profess any religion     some persons may always be
found whose conduct    is at variance with the essential princi
ples of morality. What      I do confidently assert is that those
who, professing   to be B?b?s, are guilty    of immorality,   are

contravening    the precepts of their religion.

I will not dwell       at greater   length    on my   experiences
amongst    the B?b?s   in Persia, of which    I hope to give a fuller
account      at   a future                           to   comment   on   a statement

date,   except
or              of Mirza  Kazem           in his lengthy    and

valuable article on B?b and the B?bts in the Journal Asiatique

> for 1806    (sixi?me s?rie, tome viii. p. 393).      He says, "Thus
> lived the B?b, for a long while         inoffensive, while    the com
munity    of   B?b?s  was   secretly organized,     being  recruited by
dreamers, mystics,       superstitious  people, who were by habit

as well as                       persons who,      under    the pretext of

evilly-disposed
B?b?ism,     hoped     to  serve   their   own   interests.    Thus there
woro formed amongst           the B?b?s three categories:        the blind
adorers of B?b, who belonged            to the low class of the people,
political  agitators who had become his disciples,      and evilly
disposed   sectaries."

Now, although        I do not altogether   agree with this state
ment,    I am nevertheless      convinced   that B?b?ism   attracts
several very different types of thinkers.

Firstly,   those who, having      been rigorous   and pious Mu
hamadans,        are   convinced              the                  adduced            the

B?b?s   from the Kur'?n   and Traditions,  that in the appearance

504                       THE BAB1S OF PERSIA.

Secondly,      those wdio desire the reform and progress of their
country,      and   behold in B?b?ism capacities for this which they
do not see in Aluhammadanism.

Sufis    and mystics,     who                         as a
lliirdly,                                     regard B?b?ism
systematized        and organized Sufiism,      essential  in its doctrines
with their own pantheistic            beliefs ; and who consider its fun
damental        teaching     to bo tho divine spark latent in man, by
the cultivation       of which he can attain to the degree of "Fend
jVlldh,** or Annihilation             in God," wherein he may cry out,

like Arans?r-i-Hall?j,         "Anal-Hakk,"       "I am the Truth,"       or
"1 am God."

Lastly,      there aro a certain number           of peoplo who are
> attracted by sheer admiration              and love for the B?b, or his
> successor Beh?.           These   stand more or less isolated from the
B?b? community;        they are satisfied with dwelling     in their
minds on the perfections       of their hero, and celebrating    his

a
praises in poems.     As     specimen of this class I will relate
briefly the stoiy told me by a young B?b? at Kirm?n           of his
conversion   to B?b?ism.     "Some     time ago," he said, "I fell

so that whenever   I beheld the object of my

quested me to give him my copy of the latter.      I replied,   'I
have no other book, and what can I do without          it?'   Ho
answered,   'I will give you instead of it a better book,' and

to read it, until at length my soul became filled with              the
love of the Eternal Beloved,     and I saw that one should con

stop and listen, and after a whilo I accosted him, and asked
him what book it was.     After    some hesitation   he informed
me that it was the              of  Mirza    'Ali  Muhammad    of

Bey?n
Sh?r?z, commonly    known    as the B?b.       I wfas desirous  to
hear more, and finally succeeded             in obtaining     a copy of the
Bey?n     for myself.     It  is thus,"   he   concluded,       that my soul
became filled with         the love of His Highness,            the Point    of
Utterance      (Hazrat'i-Niikta-i-Bey?n),           so  that   when   I   sing
poetry it is no longer addressed           to an earthly beloved, but is
uttered in His praise."

This young man declined            to ally himself      altogether with
eithor tho Beh?'?s or the Ezelis,          the two unequal parties into
which the B?b?s of to-day are divided.                The former of these
recognize Beh? not only as the Bab's        successor, but as "lie
whom God shall manifest        (Man yuz-hiruhu     'Halt) himself, of
whoso coming     tho B?b     continually   spoke, and of whom
ho declared  that   to read   ono  verse of  His was better than
to know         tho whole  Bey?n.      The     latter recognize Mirza

(called by them "Uazrat-i-Ezel,"             "His Highness      the
Yahy?
Eternal ") as tho Vicegerent           of the B?b, and consider that
"He whom God shall manifest"              has not yet appeared.      They
are     far   the  least numerous of the two parties, and indeed

by
are

hardly     to be found except         in Kirm?n      and one or two
other places, whereas       the Beh?'?s are diffused throughout          the
whole of Persia,       and are to be found in large numbers               in

and              other   countries as well.
Turkey, Syria, Egypt,               perhaps
When      asked by the Bella*is        to recognize Beh? as the one
foretold by the B?b, he would only reply,               His Highness     the
Point of Utterance       is sufficient for   me  ; yet he did not cate
gorically  deny tho claims of Beh? like the Ezelis.

I will  now conclude   this part of my Essay      with a brief
summary of the chief events in the history of the B?b?s, as I

First     I will    enumerate     the sources     of    information,     already

placed   before tho public, of which I have been ablo to avail
myself;1     then those to which I havo had access, and which,
as far as I am aware, have not hitherto been accessible, but
which will, I hope, soon be rendered so.

Of the former, the principal      ones are: M. le Comte do

"History        of Persia under the If ajar Dynasty,"  and Lady Sheil's

Diary        in Persia,** both of which are of great uso in ex
amining        critically  the chronology   of some of the chief events
connected    with the B?b? movement.       Besides     these I believe

that  treatises exist by Dr. Elbe,    and AI. Pillon,     of which, I
regret    to  say, I have  hitherto been  unable    to   avail myself.
Of all these I consider the work of AI. le Comte de Gobineau
the best, and I cannot avoid paying a tribute of respect and
admiration      to the author of this most brilliant        treatise on
Persian       thought.

of the chief events in the life of Beh? written     by Nabil,   one
of the chief B?b? poets of the present day, who resides at
Acre.    Of these, the second clearly fixes some doubtful points

is of the greatest use in determining      the chief points in the
history of the sect subsequently        to the death of the B?b
(1850),  and  before the year 1286   a.h.   (1869 a.D.).

I have said that the'most startling discrepancies     exist even
in the few authorities    at our disposal.      In no point    is this
more   evident than in the age which         they assign to the B?b,
and tho year in which        they approximately       place his birth.
It seems dcsirablo    to begin with a date about which           there is
comparativo     unanimity   of  opinion    ; I mean    the  date   of the
zuh?r,  or period  when   Al?rz?   'Ali Aluhammad      became    assured
of his divine mission.        By    the Persian     historians    this is
placed in the year 1260 a.h., corresponding  to the year 1844
of our era. Gobineau  says "about tho year 184'}," and Kazem
Beg places the second visit of the B?b to Sh?r?z, his native

town, when his doctrines   first began to be preached,   in 1814.
Now     this date is fixed with great accuracy     in the Bey?n,
than which we can surely have no better authority,          even

we were to assume, with Kazem Beg, that it was the
though
work, not of the B?b himself, but of his intimate disciple,
and continual companion, Ak?Seyyid   Iluseyn of Yezd, which
there seems no reason for supposing.  It is mentioned as fol
lows in the seventh chapter of the second V?hid    (Unity) of
the Bey?n   : avval-i-?n  (zuh?r) ba'd az du sd(at ? p?nzdah

the hijra date of his mission       as well as the date which ho

Now with         regard to the age of the B?b                 at this time,
> different    authorities       vary by at least fourteen years.            Lady
> Sheil, writing        in 1850, says: "This            celebrated    person was
> born forty years ago in Sh?r?z."                    This,    the earliest    date
given,  would place his birth in the year 1810.         Kazem Beg,
basing  his  calculations  on   certain passages   in the N?sikhu't
Taw?r?kh, which describe the B?b as being about forty years
old, fixes the year 1812.          Gobineau,    on the other hand,
begins   his  narrative   thus:     "About    the year    1843 there
existed   at Sh?r?z a young man,          not more     than nineteen
years old if so much, named Mirza          'AH Muhammad."        This
would make   1824 the year of his birth.

All  these various  statements  are apparently                              referable      to
fwo     sources        : the   assertions       of   the   Muhninmadan        historians,

Beg
followed     tho former, Gobineau              the latter.      Now     it seems,
prima facie, much more                 likely that the B?b?s, who wore
deeply     interested      in   the  matter,     should be right,       than the
Muhammadans,           who    probably cared very little about it, and
on this ground           alone I should prefer            the date given       by
Gobineau.        For      tho B?b?s are unanimous               in speaking     of
Mirza     'Ali Muhammad,              the B?b,     as having      been nineteen
years old when he commenced                    preaching      his doctrine.      I
confess that the number nineteen,                          the   sacred   number

being
of the B?b?s,          looks a little                        but at least the

suspicious,
diff?rence between          this and his actual ago cannot have been
more than two or three years, for had he

really been nearly
forty years    of   age,   such    a  tradition   could  novor     have gained
currency           amongst         his       followers      within    so

short a time    of his death.     Aloreover    they lay great stress
on his          : I have heard them                         as " bacha-i
youth                            speak of him "

" a
nuzdah sdla,**        child of nineteen    years old ; and iu the
B?b? history    it is stated that the Bab's     teacher, Haji Sevyid
K?zim    of ltesht, during     the latter days of his life, used to
speak chiefly of the approaching          advent of the If a* im, or
Absent    Imam ; and when asked for the signs whereby                  he
might be known,       indicated three :firstly,    that he would be a
Il?shim?   (by which the B?b?s understood         aSeyyid);     secondly,
that ho would      bo youthful     in years ; and thirdly, that he
would bo untaught         in tho learning of men ; and all those
signs they consider       to have been present       in the B?b.      Now
the author of this history says in one passage                that thirty
years have j)assed wherein the B?b?s have been visited with all
sorts of severities, and, writing       so soon after the events he
chronicled,    and  which     he had  from   eye-witnesses,     it appears

perfectly    incredible     that  he should   go   out   of  his   way to
state that H?j? Sey3rid K?zim mentioued             youth fulness as one
of the signs of the expected Kd'im,             if the B?b, whom         he
wishes    to prove     is the K?'im      or Imam      Alahdi, were not
actually young.
But   apart from these arguments,             two passages        in the

throw          on the matter.       The    first   occurs    in the
Bey?n              light
first chapter of tho second v?hid        and   the   translation    thereof
runs thus : Ono from whose              life twenty-four        years had

was entirely devoid of all the sciences which
passed, and who
others had studied,        and now recites verses          in this manner
without    thought    or reflection, and   writes   in   the   space of five
hours a thousand verses in prayer without              pause of the pen,
this thing is assuredly      from God."
The   other              occurs   much   further   on,   in   the   eleventh

passage

chapter    of   the sixth v?hid, and runs as follows:           "As,     in
the manifestation       of the Fur lean (i,e. the Ifttr'dn),      no one

recognized     that Sun of Truth until forty years had passed

case of) the Nukta-i-Beydn
(over him), and in (the                                         ("Point
of Utterance,"     i.e. the B?b)   (until) twenty-five  years."

Now it will be observed that in the first of these passages
the B?b speaks of himself          as being twenty-four      years old,

510                       THE BADIS OF PERSIA.

and in tho second as twenty-five.      What    are wo to understand

by this difference if not   this:  that when   the first passago was

penned the writer  was    twenty-four    years of age, and that the
second was written a year later ? The Bey?n           is a large book

(I mean, of course, the Persian Bey?n,              not either of the two
Arabic                 tho  shorter   of   which      was translated         into

Bey ans,
French     by Gobineau,     and   the  longer     of which    I  have    not  yet
been able to see), and it may well be supposed                     that a year

elapsed between         the utterance      of the two passages             above
quoted.      The only other suppositions           are?either       that  one   of
the statements       is  a               error     (which    seems     scarcely

copyist's
when  we consider that tho scribo must almost certainly
> likely,
have been a B?b?, and would                therefore hardly commit             so

an error  in   the                    of  what    he                as a
gross                       transcription                       regarded
sacred book) ; or else, which          is even more improbable,             that

the mistake was tho Bab's, and that he did not ovon know
his own age !
I will therefore         assume that tho first passage            indicates

the   age  of   the   B?b   at   the  time  it was   written.     The
truly

now arises, when was it written ? I think it is
question

to fix this date also within         certain limits.       I have
possible
references      to fourteen passages, mostly          iu the earlier part of

the book, stating explicitly          or implicitly    that the latter was
written                his   exile  in  M?k?,     near  Tabriz.      Now     we

during
know that the B?b did not leave Isfahan, whither                       he went
after his first imprisonment           at Sh?r?z, till the death of.Min?
chihr Khan, Mu'tamadu'd-Dawla,                which took place, according
to Kazem                in the year 1847, and according              to Mirza

Beg,
Biza Kul? Khan, author             of   the supplement     of   the  JRauzatu

s-Sa/?,    iu the month        of Ilab?'ul-U'l?,    which would ?x the
date as being either the latter half of February                   or the first

part of March,         1847.

Now supposing           the B?b to have left Isfahan           immediately
> after this, and to have been conveyed direct to M?k? by way
> of Teher?n,      within a short distanco of which he was brought
before his escort received orders to convey him to Tabriz and
M?k?,  he can scarcely have reached                 the   latter place before
the middle  or end of April,  1847.                 Now      he remained    at

Af?k?        for three years,

according   to tho B?b? historian,    that
is,     till his martyrdom iu July, 1850, except   for six months
out of that time, during which he was confined at Chihrik,
near                As it is implied    in the very same chapter

Urumiyy?.

from which    the first reference to his age is drawn, that this
was written  at Al?k?, it seems unlikely      that its date should
be earlier than the end of 1847 or the beginning           of 1848.
If, then, his age at that date were twenty-four    years, he must
have been born at any rate not earlier than a.d. 1824, which
agrees with Gobineau's       statement,   and the B?b? tradition,

that he was only nineteen        years old at the period of the
Zuh?r.    Putting   all these things together, I think we may
fix the birth of the B?b at about the year 1824 of our era.

The     nextpoint which I wish to discuss      is the date of the
B?b's   martyrdom    at Tabriz,  in connection   with    which I shall
have to speak of the dates of the great B?b!              insurrections
at Sheykh Tabarsi, near B?lfurush,          in Al?zandar?n,      and at

Zanjan    in the Khamsa.

all authori
With     regard to the Al?zandar?n       insurrection,
ties are agreed that it began shortly after tho death of Alu
hammad Shall (September 4th or 5th, 1818), and was finally
quelled   in July or August,    1819. But in the case of the two
other     event?,   there   is some   difference.

commence
Watson,     Piggott,              Beg all place the

and Kazem
ment   of    the siege of Zanjan    in the month      of Alay, but
whereas    the two former make the year 1850, the latter asserts

it to have been 1849. According       to the first two authorities,
an interval of about nine months      must    have elapsed between
the fall of Sheykh Tabarsi      and   the   commencement      of the
troubles at Zanjan ; while the latter states explicitly     that the
news of the former event         reached     the B?b?s, who were

defending     themselves  at Zanjan,   during    the latter part of
1849, and served to discourage     them.

ultimate
Lady Sheil records the siege of Zanjan, and the
fate thereof,    in her Diary of the events of 1850, and after

of the execution      of seven B?b?s        (" The     seven
speaking

Shuhadd-i-sab'a)   at Teher?n,    proceeds,   "In   Zanjan
martyrs,"

> . . . . the insurrection      broke out with violence."            The

balance of evidence   is therefore in favour of Alay, 1850, as tho
date of the commencement         of tho siege. Watson    says that
it lasted "all                 summer                        "

through    the            of 1850," and that    the
scene of operations   was visited     in tho month  of October by
Sir Henry Bethune."       This statement, however,   introduces a
further difficult)', for Kazem Beg makes     the siege last from
Alay till the following    January, whereus  according    toWat

son's account,   it can only have lasted from Alay till October ;
unless, indeed, we are to understand          that Sir Henry Bethune
visited the scene of operations         before the conclusion     of the
siege,  and  that   Lady  Sheil,   in  chronicling     tho events of the
year 1850, mentioned         the conclusion       of it, which did not

occur till the                 of 1851.

On the whole, I am inclined            to believe that Kazem Beg
was in error, as he certainly       is in placing    the Bab's death in

Tabriz     during the siege of Zanjan         (as is explicitly   stated by
Watson),       and in the month        of July.     Kazem     Beg himself
quotes a statement          of AI. Alochenin's     (from whose notes he
draws much of his information),            to the effect that the latter
had himself seen the B?b at Chihrik,              in June, 1850, but he
says   in  a   note at    the bottom   of  the   page,      AI. Mochenin
must be deceived          about the date;       in 1850 B?b no longer
existed.     He was put to death towards tho middlo                of July,

of   the hijra, which was the seventh year of the manifesta
tion     (zuh?r).     If this be correct, as there is every reason to
believe (since the B?b?s would surely be more interested                  than
any   one  else   in                the  exact date   of the  death  of  their

founder), we obtain July 9th, 1850, as the day on which the
B?b suffered martyrdom.             Gobineau      likewise gives Sha'b?n
27th as the date, but does not, I think, mention               the year.

We have       now    fixed  five    important dates, from which          it is
possible    approximately        to  arrange   the    remaining    events    of

before doing so, the history of the B?b?s from the date of the
Bab's death down to the year 1869, when NabiTs           poetical
chronicle     was written, must be sketched   in outline.

On    the death of the B?b, M?rz? Yahya,    who received                  the
tillo of  "ltazrat-i-Iizrl"       ("His Highness        the   Eternal"),    was
choson by general consensus              of opinion as his successor, and
appears to have left Persia              and taken up his residence              in

almost     immediately,        lie   laid no claims        to pro

secretly put to death

In August   of the  same year (Aug. 15th, 1852), the attempt
on the life of the Shall by certain B?b?s was made, and a
fierce persecution    of the sect immediately       succeeded   it ; in
which, amongst other victims,       the beautiful and accomplished
B?b? heroine and poetess, Kurratu'l-'Ayn,        as well as the Bab's
former      amanuensis          and                               Aha          Seyyid    Huseyn

actually      to have been arrested                ; but as he had just returned                     to

Teher?n,   his friends succeeded         in proving     that he could not
have   had  any complicity        in  the   attempted     assassination    of

the Sh?h, and,   after   a short    period    of imprisonment,      he  also
went to Baghdad,        where Al?rz? Yahy?                     was.     This

already
occurred, according      to Nabu,      in a.h. 1270 (Oct. 4th, 1853
Sept. 24th, 1854).

Here    he remained, with occasional periods of retirement
into solitude, for 10 years (till A.n. 1280), and during       this

a.h.       he wrote   the        or       of the truth
period (in        1278)                Tk?n,     proof
of the B?b? doctrines,     of which    I have already said some

thing.    About   tho samo time tho B?b?s at Sult?n?b?d           in

'Ir?k-i-'Ajam?     suffered a severe persecution,     of which I have
heard a very detailed         account from     one  who but narrowly

escaped     the  death   which   befell  four  of  his fellow-prisoners.
Besides     these, a B?b? woman was sent thence to Teher?n,
and there strangled        by order of tho Shah.

The Persian       Government      viewed with disfavour       the pre
sence of the B?b?s         at Baghdad,     and finally,    in a.h. 1280

on the Turkish       Government        to

They

were first taken to Constantinople,         where    they re
mained   for about four months;       thence,   in Bajab,   a.h.   1281

(December,    A.n.  1864), they wero   sent  to  Adrianoplo,    called

by the followers      of Beh?,      "Arz-i-sirr,**      "The Land     of
tho Alystery,"   because    it was     there   that  Beh?   announced
his divine mission,      and claimed        to bo      Ho whom God

"                   =

this announcement,        the   B?b?s    wero divided    into
making
two              some                 Bella's    claim,   and   others,    at

it.    These      latter  argued     that  "He  whom

> God     shall manifest"          could not come until            the religion
founded     by the B?b had obtained               currency,    and the laws

laid down in the Bey?n            had been adopted, at least by some
of the nations     of the earth.          They    asserted that it was an

impossible thing     that     one revelation      should so soon be abro

and      that  so  brief a  period should separate

texts from the Bey?n          to prove                 that more than a thousand
years,   and               either 2001                 or 1511 years (represented
probably

by the   sum    of the               letters in the words Ghiy?s
respectively
and

Mustaghcts      according     to the              abjad notation) must elapse
between      the time of the B?b                       and         the      advent    of   "Him
whom God shall manifest."

Against        these arguments          the followers    of Beh?    quoted
numerous       texts from the Bey?n to the effect that the day and
place of His         coming       were known       to God alone (Persian
Boyan,     iv.  5,  vi. \\, vii.   10) ; that  lie will  arise suddenly (vii.
[)), and is  to be  known       by Himself,   not  by  the  Bey?n (vii. llj,
for he is the fulfilment          of the verse     Ley saKe-mithlihi   shey"
(There      is none

like unto Hirn)  (v. 16) ; and that it was im
possible that any one should falsely claim to be Him (vi. 8).
They    urged, moreover,     that all through    the Bey?n   the

downfall,            and to 'Ali P?sh?,   prophesying      his death                                   in a

for kindness    shown      by            tho Russian      minister.      Of these
documents,    which,     with              some others      addressed     to other
potentates,  are collectively              known as the       Stira-i-Heykal,*9   I
shall speak more              particularly     in  treating   of  the  Literature
of the B?b?s.

It was further    decided   that a few of the Ezelis,   or fol
lowers   of Al?rz? Yahy?,    should be sent with Beh?     and his
adherents   to Acre;     and that some of the latter should be
transported   with    the majority    of the Ezelis    to Cyprus.
The         reason

of this arrangement         was    a hope     that    in
each        case

the dissentient   minority    would    strive to   hinder
Persians   and others from coming to visit cither of tho B?b?
chiefs, by giving     information   of their arrival and intention

> to the Turkish    Government.        Aluch difficulty was experi

morrhage    checked, until he received a promise that ho should
be allowed    to accompany    his master  to Acre.     Others  cast

themselves  out of the ships which  were  to separate   them from
him into the sea.

Eventually   onljr three or four of the followers of Beh?

were conveyed    to Cyprus.  One of these was tho celebrated
Mushkin-Kahim,**     who is famous among the B?b?s for his

and   who                  or   used         to             a   coffce-houso
penmanship,                           keeps,                              keep,
at,    I  think, Larnaka-Skala.        Whenever        a Persian      landed

there,  he   used   to invite  him    in,  and  offer him    tea  or  coffee
and a kaly?u ; and if, in the course of conversation,                he suc
ceeded in eliciting      from his visitor     that he had come thither
to 6ee Al?rz? Yahy?,        he tried to prevent him doing so, either
by persuasion,       or by warning         the Turkish    officials of his

intention.     Since Cyprus has become a British            possession,     I
do   not  know how the      matter   stands,   and  though   I  have   made
some inquiries, I have hitherto          been unable to learn whether

M?rz? Yahy?     is still alive or not.1 It is probable that if he be

so, he will be at Lefkosiar      and it is extremely   desirable     to
find this out, for much precious         information concerning     the
B?b could undoubtedly        be gathered    from him. His followers
soon dwindled    to a very small number, and I was informed

a B?b? who had visited him a few years ago, that he was
by

living alono in great poverty,       and, I think, deserted    by his
own sons. He is said to spend his days in lamenting               over
the death     of the B?b, and writing             poems in his praise.

With       regard      to  the    seven   Ezelis     sent to Acre, they were
massacred       one night by some of the followers of Beh?, but
without     the knowledge          of the latter, so far as we can judge.
The names of five of these unfortunate                       victims were : A'kd

This event occurred about a month             after tho arrival of
Beh?     and his followers       at Acre,    i.e. about October      or
November,     1868.     From   that timo till the present day, the
followers of Beh? have been increasing             in number and in
fluence,  and  the  followers of  Al?rz? Yahy?      decreasing, so that

I believe, but these are

only regarded, even by the Ezelis, as of
secondary    importance, while the Bch?'?s reject them entirely.

Thus at the present day nearly all the B?b?s arc Beh?'?s,

tative    as a                   of

life and belief.         It is this fact which
guide
makes       copies of the Bey?n         so   difficult    to obtain, since they
have become scarce; and moreover                    the B?b?s prefer to place
in the hands of the inquirer the writings                  of Beh?.

The      latter are very numerous,             since all the letters sent
by hi in to his followers            or others aro regarded           as inspired

writings       in  the  fullest   sense   of   the   word.     Beh?      is now 74
years    of   age,  and   still dwells    at  Acre,    where    he   is visited  by
numbers of his followers, as well as by inquirers.

According
to what I have heard, the respect

paid to him by the former
is unbounded.

They regard him as an incarnation                     of the
Deity,    and indeed commonly                      of  him   as "Halclc** (God,

speak
or the Truth), although,            as I hope to explain more

fully on
a future occasion,          they understand         his divinity      in different
ways.      He has several sons, one, already alluded to, named

places    in  Syria;    another, named Mirzd Muhammad       'AH, and
entitled     "Glinsn-i-Akbar.**     Beh?    himself is named Mirzd
Jluxcyn 'AH, and is of noble family.           He was born iu A.n.
1233,    on   Aluharrain    2nd, in Teher?n.    He never oppears in

to a dozen, at stated times. A scribe is also

present who writes
so             that  he  can  take  down   verbatim    all the utterances

of Beh?, which are                                 out  for distribution.

These audiences         of which I have spoken do not appear

long as a rule.        One of them was described           to me
minutely       by a B?b? with whom I was intimately   acquainted,
and who        visited both Acre and Cyprus   in the course of his

travels.      At the former place he remained seventy days, and
during   this time was "honoured"     ("musharraf**),  that is,
admitted   to an audience with the Beh?, twelve times.     The

placed     his  hands    on   their heads,   and   greeted     them   twice
with      the words         B?raka*U?hu      Utleykum**     ("God     hath
blessed you," or "Alay God bless you").                  Then he said,

AIo8t blessed are ye, in that ye have been honoured with
beholding me, for prophets have desired this most ardently."
He then told them to sit down, and tea was placed before

were dismissed.       Aiy informant added, that being taken ill a

littlo while after, he was sent some pil?w from Bella's       own
plate, and that on eating this he was eured. Alany of the B?b?s
strove to carry off a few grains of rice for themselves.  On
another occasion when he was admitted to an audience, Beh?
said to him, "I desire that all men may become even as I am."

Since   the arrival of Beh? at Acre,           the most     important
events  in the history of the sect are           the despatch     of the
Letters   to the various    sovereigns      of some of         the chief
countries   in Europe    and Asia,                  them    to embrace

inviting
the new religion, and the martyrdom          of Badi',    tho youthful
messenger     who carried    the letter addressed         to tho Shall
of Persia    to Teher?n,  which    probably      occurred about a.D.
1809 ; and the death of the Martyrs           of Isfahan," described
above, about A.n. ,1880 or 1881.

Tho letters were as follows :x to the Shall of Persia,             tho
hearer of which went                      on foot from Acre                       to Teher?n,          where
he su tiered a painful   death, being branded                      with               to death
hot bricks;   to Sultan   'Abdu'l-1 Aziz;     to Napoleon    III.;     to

the then reigning Emperor    of llassia;      to tho Pope;     to tho
President of the United States ; and to our own Queen Victoria.

In the latter much commendation         is bestowed on tho Queen
and the English Government.

I must here conclude this imperfect account of the history
of this interesting   and curious religion, which, although far
from being as accurate and precise as I should have wished,
contains,  I believe, matter    hitherto  not brought before the
public.  I hope       soon to be iu possession   of fuller materials,
