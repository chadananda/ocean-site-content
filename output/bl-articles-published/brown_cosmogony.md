> **Abstract:**  
>   
> One of the most significant developments in the 20th century study of religion has been the increasing attention given to the importance of myth, a term used here in its sense of "sacred narrative". As an instrument in the structuring of a coherent and foundational worldview, myth has been shown to be essential to the perception of continuity between the core message of religious traditions and the practices and communities that spring from them, and the study of myth has illuminated the congruence of the experience of spirituality as a sense of meaning and the expression of that sense in religious behavior.  
>   
> This paper will explore the dimensions of myth in the Bahá'í Faith. Drawing on a broad range of contemporary sources in the study of myth and myth theory, the elements and dynamics of myth will be outlined. This brief survey will suggest our method for what follows. The Bahá'í creation narrative will be described in some depth, followed by an analysis of Bahá'í narratives of religious history. The final section discusses the dimension of myth in contemporary Bahá'í life, particularly in relation to the Bahá'í Administrative Order. It will be maintained that an awareness of the mythic elements in the Bahá'í Faith sheds considerable light on the significance for Bahá'ís of the Administrative Order as a sacred phenomenon.

The Beginning that Hath No Beginning: Bahá’í Cosmogony1

by Vahid Brown

> Behold, O concourse of the earth, the splendours of the End, revealed in the Manifestations of
> the Beginning!                                                                 —Bahá’u’lláh

ndowed with consciousness, gifted with reason, humankind’s experience of the world is necessarily an

E      experience of meaning, collectively embodied in our worldviews and revealed in our cultures, lan-

guages, institutions, and ways of life. Myth, in the sense of the core sacred narrative of humankind’s
spiritual traditions, has for millennia been a circle enclosing all aspects of human life. At the center of this cir-
cle is the consciousness of the intimate relationship between the Absolute and the world. The fount of the
mythic consciousness is a narrative of cosmogony, a foundational, overarching story of the creation of the uni-
verse. The perception of this link between the deep core of the Bahá’í Faith’s spiritual vision of the universe
and its outermost application in its social, administrative or institutional affairs is essential to an adequate
awareness of modern Bahá’í life as sacred. The goal of this paper is to delineate several fundamental aspects
of Bahá’í cosmogony and its underlying metaphysics, aspects which are central to the mythic vision of the
world that animates Bahá’í life.

Throughout the works of the Báb, Bahá’u’lláh, and ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, creation remains an important theme,
addressed in a variety of ways in several different “codes,” 3 often alluding to aspects of the Islamic cosmogo-
nic tradition. More than any other term, symbol, or concept, however, the Will of God is at the center of the
Bahá’í notion of creation. It is the defining term of Bahá’í myth at every level, be it prophetological, episte-
mological, historical, societal, or personal.

In Bahá’u’lláh’s Lawh-i-Hikmat (Tablet of Wisdom) we find an important discussion of the Will and of cos-
mogony that provides an ideal framework for our exploration, as it brings together diverse but parallel creation
narratives found in the broader corpus of Bahá’í scripture. This paper will be structured around a detailed
exploration of four selected passages from the Tablet (paragraphs 8, 9, and 12).

The Tablet was addressed to Áqá Muhammad Qá’iní, Nabíl-i-Akbar, arguably the most learned of
Bahá’u’lláh’s early dis ciples.4 Nabíl-i-Akbar was deeply versed in virtually all fields of study available to a
man of his time and place, a fact to which ‘Abdu’l-Bahá referred when speaking of him as a man “of wide
learning, at once a mujtahid, a philosopher, a mystic, and gifted with intuitive insight, he was also an accom-
plished man of letters and an orator without a peer.”5 Such a prodigious wealth of knowledge on the part of His
audience may explain Bahá’u’lláh’s allusions in this Tablet to so many currents of cosmogonic understanding
in Islam.

> As regards thine assertions about the beginnings of creation, this is a matter on which conceptions vary by
> reason of the divergences in men’s thoughts and opinions. Wert thou to assert that it hath ever existed and
> shall continue to exist, it would be true; or wert thou to affirm the same concept as is mentioned in the
> sacred Scriptures, no doubt would there be about it, for it hath been revealed by God, the Lord of the
> worlds.6

This passage has been interpreted in a number of ways by various scholars of the Bahá’í Faith, the gamut
of which can be gauged by referring to the works of Adib Taherzadeh, Moojan Momen, and Juan Cole.

Adib Taherzadeh maintained that these sentences, along with the remainder of this paragraph, give an
unequivocal statement of the eternity of the world, and a firm rejection of the idea of a temporally originated
cosmos, of creation ex nihilo. 7 He reads the paragraph as juxtaposing two ideas of creation: (a) that “it hath
ever existed,” that it is eternal and (b) that “God was a hidden treasure and created man in order to make
Himself known,” which refers to the sentence in the Tablet immediately following those given above.8 The lat-

Lights of ‘Irfán

ter idea, to Taherzadeh, “seems to imply an interval without a creation,” i.e., the notion of temporal origina-
tion. 9 Taherzadeh is clear, however, that such an idea is implied and is only implied, and he goes on to opine
that what is really being distinguished are two ideas of eternality, “the eternity of God and the eternity of His
creation.” 10 He explains this idea by referencing talks on the matter by ‘ Abdu’l-Bahá in Some Answered
Questions, and another Tablet of Bahá’u’lláh from the ‘Akká period, the Lawh-i-‘Abdu’l-Vahháb.11

A different reading of this paragraph is presented by Moojan Momen in an article in which he argues for
cognitive relativism vis-à-vis questions of Bahá’í metaphysics. 12 In it, he describes the is sue as “that of whether
the world of creation is coeternal with God or created in time.”13 In line with the development and application
to Bahá’í metaphysics of the idea of cognitive relativism, which is the wider context in which this s tatement
occurs, the author suggests that both of these positions are equally valid, but neither of them are “true” in any-
thing like an absolute sense, for they concern realities or processes about which no intelligible concept can be
considered adequate. Momen appears to read the passage as explicitly suggesting a notion of creation in time,
which is then set in juxtaposition to the notion of eternality.

Juan Cole’s position lies s omewhere in between. In his draft entry on the Tablet of Wisdom for the Bahá’í
encyclopedia project, Cole seems, like Momen, to take for granted that Bahá’u’lláh is writing about the ques-
tion of the eternity of the world versus its creation in time, out of nothing. 14 To Cole, Bahá’u’lláh is saying that
“both the eternality of the world and the creation of the world are valid ways of talking,” a statement which he
supports by a treatment of the same distinction between essential (or ontological) pre-existence and temporal
pre-existence noted by Taherzadeh. 15 That is, the world is originated by God and is therefore contingent, and
God, as That upon which the existence of the world is contingent, is es sentially pre-existent. Yet this process
of originating the cosmos has always been going on, and there is not a time in which it began, before which
there was no world. Thus, to speak of God being before the creation is to speak of His existential rather than
temporal priority in relation to the world. These concepts are explained by ‘Abdu’l-Bahá in the text
Taherzadeh cites. 16

Both Momen and Cole are reading this passage as a clear reference to the notions of creation in time, cre-
ation from nothing, or both. If we follow Cole and accept “sacred Scriptures” to embrace the Bible and the
Qu’rán,17 we are left with the quandary that neither of these texts carry an explicit concept of creation ex nihi -
lo. In fact, there are plenty of indications that the idea of temporal creation ex nihilo didn’t arise in the
Abrahamic religions until a considerable time after the composition of their core scriptures.18 Additionally,
there have always been important figures and sects in these religious traditions promoting readings of these
texts that did not imply an ex nihilo creation, but simply a caus al relationship between God and the world. One
such group was the Shaykhí movement, with which Nabíl-i-Akbar, the immediate recipient of this Tablet, was
associated.19

Momen’s reading of the passage hints at a larger problem. Do the Bahá’í writings affirm the eternality of
the world or its creation out of nothing in time? If the answer is yes to both, how do we resolve the apparent
contradiction?

As Momen implied in his comments about the Lawh-i-Hikmat, the answer is yes on both counts. As to the
eternality of the world, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá wrote and spoke emphatically on this point. One could cite, in support
of the argument for eternity, the following:

> Know that it is one of the most abstruse spiritual truths that the world of existence—that is to say, this end-
> less universe—has no beginning. . . . If we could imagine a time when no beings existed, this imagination
> would be the denial of the Divinity of God. Moreover, absolute nonexistence cannot become existence. . .
> . Therefore, as the Essence of Unity (that is, the existence of God) is everlasting and eternal—that is to say,
> it has neither beginning nor end—it is certain that this world of existence, this endless universe, has nei-
> ther beginning nor end.20
> The Creator always had a creation; the rays have always shone and gleamed from the reality of the sun, for
> without the rays the sun would be opaque darkness. The names and attributes of God require the existence
> of beings, and the Eternal Bounty does not cease. If it were to, it would be contrary to the perfections of
> God.21

Here we see no equivocation, no room for the suggestion of temporal creation or creation ex nihilo. Such,

\[22\] The Beginni ng that Hath No Begin ni ng

according to these citations, would be contrary to God’s perfection and in denial of His divinity. The matter
would appear to be settled, if it weren’t for other instances in the writings of Bahá’u’lláh that speak of creation
from nothing. For example:

> All that is in heaven and all that is in the earth have come to exist at His bidding, and by His Will all have
> stepped out of utter nothingness into the world of being.22
> All praise to the unity of God, and all honor to Him, the sovereign Lord, the incomparable and all-glori-
> ous Ruler of the universe, Who, out of utter nothingness, hath created the reality of all things, Who, from
> naught, hath brought into being the most refined and subtle elements of His creation, and Who, rescuing
> His creatures from the abasement of remoteness and the perils of ultimate extinction, hath received them
into His kingdom of incorruptible glory.23

The apparent contradiction is resolved, however, by the interpretations of ‘ Abdu’l-Bahá and Shoghi Effendi,
both of whom state that “nothingness” in this context is not meant literally, as an absolute nonexistence which
is replaced by existence in an act of creatio ex nihilo. Writing of the second quotation from Bahá’u’lláh imme-
diately above, Shoghi Effendi stated, through his secretary:

> The statement in the “Gleanings”, pp. 64-65, “who out of utter nothingness . . .” etc., should be taken in a
> symbolic and not a literal sense. It is only to demonstrate the power and greatness of God. 24

‘Abdu’l-Bahá spoke repeatedly to this question. In one instance, He states that “existence and nonexistence
are both relative. If it be said that such a thing came into existence from nonexistence, this does not refer to
absolute nonexistence, but means that its former condition in relation to its actual condition was nothing-
n e s s . ”25

If we re-examine the passage from the Tablet of Wisdom, it is quite clear that Bahá’u’lláh is affirming the
eternity of the universe, while at the same time upholding the truth of whatever has been revealed in the sacred
Scriptures. Even if we assume that His reference to the sacred Scriptures is intended to engage in the mind of
His reader a more or less common understanding of these texts—that the universe was created in time and from
nothing—it seems clear that He is not doing so in order to affirm that unders tanding. Bahá’u’lláh juxtapos es
two truths, which many thought to be opposed to one another, and proceeds to elucidate their compatibility.
One can affirm the scriptural concept of creation since the universe is dependent on a cause, exists through
something other than itself, and is therefore contingent. This fact entails a preexistence on the part of its Cause,
but a preexistence which is ontological rather than temporal. The fact that the universe has always existed does
not confer upon it an eternity identical to the eternity of God, for the latter exists at an infinitely higher place
in the hierarchy of being.

> This same juxtaposition and resolution was offered in another place by Bahá’u’lláh, where He writes:
> As to thy question whether the physical world is subject to any limitations, know thou that the compre-
> hension of this matter dependeth upon the observer himself. In one sense, it is limited; in another, it is
> exalted beyond all limitations. The one true God hath everlastingly existed, and will everlastingly contin-
> ue to exist. His creation, likewise, hath had no beginning, and will have no end. All that is created, how-
> ever, is preceded by a cause. 26

In the Lawh-i- ‘Abdu’r-Razzáq, Bahá’u’lláh offers yet another manner of approach, one which introduces a
fundamental concept for Bahá’í cosmogony. In it, Bahá’u’lláh again addresses an individual who had posed a
“ques tion concerning the origin of creation.”27 He first answers that the beginning of creation “hath had no
beginning,” that it “hath existed from eternity, and will continue to exist forever.” 28 He then refers to a well-
known hadíth that could be understood to imply a creatio ex nihilo:

> As to those sayings, attributed to the Prophets of old, such as, “In the beginning was God; there was no
> creature to know Him,” and “The Lord was alone; with no one to adore Him,” the meaning of these and
> similar sayings is clear and evident, and should at no time be misapprehended. To this same truth bear wit-
> ness these words which He hath revealed: “God was alone; there was none else besides Him. He will
> always remain what He hath ever been. ” Every discerning eye will readily perceive that the Lord is now
> manifest, yet there is none to recognize His glory. By this is meant that the habitation wherein the Divine
> Being dwelleth is far above the reach and ken of any one besides Him. . . . He will, for ever, remain immea-

Lights of ‘Irfán

> surably exalted above any one except Himself. 29

This is similar to the resolution examined above. The sayings of the Prophets that imply a time when God
existed prior to the existence of anything els e are interpreted by Bahá’u’lláh to point to an ontological priori-
ty, not a temporal one. God can always be described as being “alone,” for His is an absolute existence, while
all else is contingent and caused, acquiring existence from the will of another.

But He continues in this Tablet to provide a unique turn on this cosmogonic issue, assimilating its cosmic
level to an historical dimension. The Manifestations of God are offered as one of the intended referents in the
scriptural passages that speak of God and His creation. The various names by which the reality with cosmic
causal significance are known in the Bahá’í writings and which are unders tood to have “created” all things—
the Will, the Word, the Command—are related to the Manifestations of God in such a way as to imbue Their
activity with cosmogonic meaning. Thus, Bahá’u’lláh offers an additional elucidation of those texts that speak
of God “before” creation in the context of the earthly mission of His M anifestations:

> Consider the hour at which the supreme Manifestation of God revealeth Himself unto men. Ere that hour
> cometh, the Ancient Being, Who is still unknown of men and hath not as yet given utterance to the Word
> of God, is Himself the All-Knower in a world devoid of any man that hath known Him. He is indeed the
> Creator without a creation. For at the very moment preceding His Revelation, each and every created thing
> shall be made to yield up its soul to God. This is indeed the Day of which it hath been written: “Whose
> shall be the Kingdom this Day?” And none can be found ready to answer!30

This plurality of cosmogonic levels is essential to the Bahá’í mythic structure, and allows the creativity of
God to be perceived in concrete moments of sacred time. By virtue of its capacity for extension to diverse lev-
els of experience and reality, cosmogonic symbolism reverberates throughout humanity’s diverse modes of life,
be they personal, cultural, historical, spiritual, or political. As will be seen, the thread that ties the cosmogony
to all aspects of the sacred in the Bahá’í worldview is the concept of the Will of God.

> The next passage from the Tablet of Wisdom reads:
> Indeed He was a hidden treasure. This is a station that can never be described nor even alluded to. And in
> the station of ‘I did wish to make Myself known,’ God was, and His creation had ever existed beneath His
> shelter from the beginning that hath no beginning, apart from its being preceded by a Firstness which can-
> not be regarded as firstness and originated by a Cause inscrutable even unto all men of learning. 31

There are two narratives embraced by this passage; one of symbol and metaphor, and one of a more ratio-
nal, philosophical discourse. Both narratives have a long heritage of development, and both are essential to
Bahá’í cosmogony. Over the next few pages we will call these, respectively, the myth of the Hidden Treasure
and the paradox of causality.

The Myth of the Hidden Treasure

The myth of the Hidden Treasure springs ultimately from a hadíth qudsí—a recorded utterance of
Muhammad, His companions or Imams, which has as part of its text an as cription of a saying to God Himself. 32
Though providing the substance of contemplation for countles s Muslim mystics over time, this particular
hadíth qudsí was generally repudiated by the hadíth scholars. 33 It is not found in any of the six canonical col-
lections of hadíth recognized by Sunnis and most Shí’ites as authentic and authoritative. Nonetheless, it is
quoted, cited, and alluded to in a great many places in the Bahá’í writings, and ‘ Abdu’l-Bahá wrote a cele-
brated commentary on it while in His teens .34

While there are a number of variants of the Hidden Treasure hadíth, the form which is cited here in the
Lawh-i-Hikmat and upon which ‘ Abdu’l-Bahá wrote His commentary can be translated as follows:

> I was a Hidden Treasure. I did wish (or love) to make Myself known, so I created the Creation that I might
> be known.

The Tablet of Wisdom distinguishes between two “s tations” (maqámát) of God or of Being in this hadíth.

The first station is that of the Hidden Treasure, so transcendent that it is beyond description or even allusion.
With reference to this station, it is impossible to ascribe existence to anything other than the divine Essence.
In His commentary on this hadíth, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá wrote:

\[24\] The Beginni ng that Hath No Begin ni ng

> And that Essence of Primal Oneness, in that most great station in which it is said: “There was God and
> there was naught else besides Him,” is called by the names: the Hidden Treasure, the Hidden Ipseity, the
> Absolute Unity, Pure Essence, Absolute Non-specificity, the Hidden of the Hidden, the Primal Mystery, the
> Absolute Unknown, the Indescribable One, the Undiscoverable One and other Names.35

The second station, of “I did wish to make Myself known,” is the station at which God can be addressed by
names and attributes, including “the Creator.” As such, He has a creation, which is contingent yet eternally
existent. These two stations are also distinguished in a prayer of Bahá’u’lláh:

> I testify that Thou wast a hidden Treasure wrapped within Thine immemorial Being and an impenetrable
> Mystery enshrined in Thine own Essence. Wishing to reveal Thyself, Thou didst call into being the Greater
> and the Lesser Worlds, and didst choose Man above all Thy creatures, and didst make Him a sign of both
of these worlds, O Thou Who art our Lord, the Most Compassionate! 36

The creative activity of the second stage can be referred to as the Word, as in this verse: “Thou didst wish
to make Thyself known unto men; therefore, Thou didst, through a word of Thy mouth, bring creation into
being and fashion the universe. ” 37 The Word of God, in turn, depends upon the agency of God’s Will (mashíyy -
at) and Purpose (irádih):

> I testify that no sooner had the First Word proceeded, through the potency of Thy will and purpose, out of
> His mouth, and the First Call gone forth from His lips than the whole creation was revolutionized, and all
> that are in the heavens and all that are on earth were stirred to the depths.38

In the myth of the Hidden Treasure, we can discern the classic cosmogonic pair of chaos and cos mos. The
station of the Hidden Treasure corresponds to chaos, for at this stage the universe is considered as nothingness ,
while God’s Essence is an impenetrable abyss, in which it is impossible to identify characteristics or structure.
At the station of “I did wish to make Myself known,” there comes the appearance of order (cosmos), a clear
relationship between Creator and creation in pursuance of a definite purpos e. The concept which mediates
between these two sides of the semantic opposition is the Will. It is the Will which brings creation “out of the
wastes of utter nothingness ” —chaos—and it is “the energies of Thy Will whereby the entire creation hath been
generated” that regulate the order—cosmos.

It should als o be noted that the human being plays a critical role in the myth of the Hidden Treasure.39 If the
desire to be known is the cause of creation, such a desire could only be fulfilled in the creation of a being with
the capacity for knowledge. This central role is expressed by Bahá’u’lláh in the following:

> Having created the world and all that liveth and moveth therein, He, through the direct operation of His
> unconstrained and sovereign Will, chose to confer upon man the unique distinction and capacity to know
> Him and to love Him—a capacity that must needs be regarded as the generating impulse and the primary
purpose underlying the whole of creation . . . 40

As with the cosmos/chaos pair, the semantic opposition of known/unknown, which, in the myth of the
Hidden Treasure is the tension behind the decision of God to create, is mediated by the Will of God. Not only
is the Will res ponsible for the creation of the capacity to know, it is the Manifestation of that Will in the
Prophets and M essengers that mediates between the latency of this capacity and its actual fulfillment. Perhaps
the clearest expression of the identity of the Will with the Prophets is this passage from the Báb: “It is this
Primal Will which appeareth res plendent in every Prophet and speaketh forth in every revealed Book.”41 That
humanity’s knowledge of God is possible only through the Manifestations is a central theme throughout the
Bahá’í writings, for it is the Manifestation of God “Who representeth the Godhead in both the Kingdom of His
Cause and the world of creation.” 42

The cosmogonic concepts of the myth of the Hidden Treasure are us ed at a variety of levels. In the Lawh-i-
Hikmat, we see them employed at the level of cosmogony proper, in terms of the creation of the universe. But
these concepts are also central to the Bahá’í view of sacred history, in which cycles of time are initiated by the
appearance of a Manifestation of the Primal Will, a Prophet who transmits God’s message to humanity and lays
the foundation for a new civilization. All of the same elements are present. The moment before the Prophet
reveals Himself, there is a “Creator without a creation,” 43 a chaos in which God is utterly hidden. The “works
and acts of each and every one of these Manifestations of God” are ass imilated to the creative activity of God,

Lights of ‘Irfán

inasmuch as they “are a reflection of His Will and Purpose.” 44 At both levels, creation is effected through the
Word. There is even a parallel in the distinction between the two stations of God described above and the two
stations of the Manifestations explained by Bahá’u’lláh in the Kitáb-i-ˆqán. At the level of God’s Oneness—
the Hidden Treasure—no attributes or names can be affirmed, since the Essence is identical only with Itself
and transcends description. Similarly, in “the station of pure abstraction and essential unity,”45 all of the
Prophets are one, and no distinctions can be made between them. In the station of wishing to be known, God
is named by definite attributes, each of which has a concomitant effect—i.e., God is the Creator and therefore
has His creation. Reflecting this, the Prophets have a “station of distinction,” in which “[e]ach one of them is
known by a different name, is characterized by a special attribute, fulfils a definite Mission, and is entrusted
with a particular Revelation.”46 Their “particular Revelation” corresponds to the creation of a new civilization
in the era in which They appear.

The Paradox of Causality

Turning to the second narrative, we find the perplexing statement that the universe, though eternal, is pre-
ceded by a “Firstness which cannot be regarded as firstness and originated by a Cause inscrutable even unto
all men of learning.” 47 Our understanding of this paradox of causality, insofar as any understanding is possi-
ble, will be facilitated by a brief look at its development in Islamic thought.

Greek philosophy, which the Islamic world studied and absorbed, contrasted two traditions of the idea of
God or the Absolute. In Aristotelian thought, God is the First Cause, the Unmoved Mover who is ultimately
responsible for all motion. From this perspective, God is the highest link in a chain of causality, and is there-
fore directly connected to His effects. The Neoplatonic tradition, on the other hand, emphasized the transcen-
dence of God or “the One.” This latter tradition—at least insofar as it is bas ed in the works of Plotinus—held
that any name for God is merely a symbol for an unknowable reality, a reality which is the ground of the chain
of being rather than its apex. For example, in the Enneads, Plotinus writes:

> The name “the one” is merely a denial of multiplicity. The Pythagoreans signified it symbolically among
> one another through the term Apollo [a-pollón: “not many”], by apophasis of the many. If the one is to be
> taken as a positing, name, and referent, we would express ourselves more clearly if we did not speak its
> name at all. We speak it so that we can begin our search with that which signifies the most simple, ending
> with the apophasis of even that. 48
> How can one say that it is a being among beings, something to which a thus can be applied? It is other than
> all things that are “thus.”49

There is certainly a hierarchy of causes in Neoplatonism—the chain of hypostases—but the link between the
two highest orders of being in this hierarchy is of a different nature than the link between the highest order of
the hierarchy and that unutterable reality that transcends yet embraces the chain of being in its totality.

The Islamic philosophical discourse on these issues can also be s chematized into two similarly contrasting
traditions. Islamic theology could be called apophatic in a general s ense, in that it could not but affirm the all-
important principle of tawhíd, divine unity, and that “there is nothing like Him.” 50 Yet there is a broad divide
between, on the one hand, such philosophers as Ibn Síná (Avicenna, d. 1037 C. E.) or al-Farábí (d. 950 C. E .), for
whom it is legitimate to represent God as the First Cause, the Necessary Being; and on the other hand, such
Shí’ite thinkers as the Ismá‘ílí Abú Ya’qúb Sijistání (tenth century) or Shaykh Ahmad al-Ahsá’í (d. 1826), for
whom the ascription to God of being a cause (‘illa) is little less than heres y.

In early Ismá‘ílí thought, the cause of causes (‘illat al-‘illal) is not God, but rather the First Intellect, which
is the first originated being. 51 God is not delimited or defined by creation because, to these thinkers, a cause is
necessarily delimited and qualified by its effect. The appearance of an effect confers the quality of causation
upon its cause. Inasmuch as an effect rises necessarily from its cause, as heat does from fire, God envisioned
as first cause would cease to be free. Rather, the first cause, the cause of all secondary causes, is said to have
been made to cause those causes by God. It is not directly caused by God, but is rather originated (abda’a) by
Him. It may seem like wordplay, but the essential point of this argument is that God is not the first cause in
the great chain of causes and effects, for if this were the case God would then be similar to those secondary
causes and their effects. Rather, God is the Origin (mubdi‘) of the First Intellect, the latter being identified with

\[26\] The Beginni ng that Hath No Begin ni ng

the Word or the Unity (wahda). 52 From this first originated being (al-mubda’ al-awwal), all things are produced
through emanation (inbi’áth or fayd). The chain of causation begins here, functioning in much the same way
as in the Neoplatonic hierarchy. 53

In the works of Shaykh Ahmad al-Ahsá’í one finds many parallels to the metaphysical doctrines of the Bábí
and Bahá’í Faiths. Like the philosophers of early Ismá‘ílism, Shaykh Ahmad drew upon the teachings of the
Shí‘í Imáms in elaborating his thought. One reported saying of the sixth Imám, Ja‘fár as-Sádiq, was particu-
larly important for the Shaykh’s understanding of creation. In this enigmatic statement, quoted abundantly by
Shaykh Ahmad, the Imám says: “God created the Will (mashiyyat) through itself (bi-nafsihá), and created all
things (al-ashyá’a) through the Will.”54

One can see from this statement how Shaykh Ahmad may have developed a notion similar to that of the early
Is má‘ílís, in which God is not seen as the direct cause of creation but as the origin of the first cause. In fact,
Shaykh Ahmad did exactly that, though not in the same terms. He took this teaching of Imám Sádiq and laid
it at the foundation of his metaphysics. For Shaykh Ahmad, the “acting” of an agent is distinct from both the
agent itself and the act for which the acting is a process of occasioning.

If the Primal Will created itself, or was created by itself, does God then have no connection with the uni-
verse? Is there not a circularity in the idea of a self-created Will? Shaykh Ahmad is emphatic in answering both
of these questions in the negative. He explains that mashiyyat is God’s acting, and an acting55 depends upon an
agent of that acting for its subsistence. 56 He defines the mode of subsistence by which the acting of an agent
has its own distinct being as “subsistence of emanation,” or “processional subsis tence” (qiyám as-Sudúrí).57
Thus, the Primal Will is contingent upon God for its being, and could be conceptualized as God’s “process of
emanating.” Yet, he insists that the Emanator, the process of emanating, and the end-result emanation are three
distinct realities, which he classifies on the cosmological scale as Real Being (al-wujúd al-haqq), Absolute
Being (al-wujúd al-mutlaq), and Delimited Being (al-wujúd al-muqayyad).58 In the case of the Primal Will, it
is dependent on God for its existence but is at the same time its own caus e. Shaykh Ahmad points out that a
process-of-willing is not coequal with the actor upon whom this process depends, nor is it the same as the
willed result. Further, the process-of-willing does not come to be through anything other than itself, for if it
did we would have to say that it came to be through another process-of-willing which in turn depended upon
a third process-of-willing, around and around in an infinite regress. 59 Thus, the Primal Will can be seen as its
own cause, while yet remaining contingent in relation to God, the Real Being.

In Bábí and Bahá’í texts, we can find both of these approaches to the affirmation of God’s transcendence.

As in early Ismá‘ílí doctrine, God is not the cause of causes but the Originator of the cause of causes; and as
with Shaykh Ahmad, the traditional statement of the Imám Ja‘fár as-Sádiq is cited in evidence of God’s inde-
pendence from receiving qualification from His effects.

These s trains are the background to the statement under discussion, that “His creation had ever existed
beneath His shelter from the beginning that hath no beginning, apart from its being preceded by a Firstness
which cannot be regarded as firstness and originated by a Cause inscrutable even unto all men of learning.” 60
From one perspective, the Firstness (awwal) is not a firstness (lá awwal) due to the fact that creation is not
“after” God in a temporal sense. But further, it is not even “after” God as an effect is “after” a cause. The
Primal Will, while it constitutes an actional quality of God, is its own cause. It is the Primal Will which in turn
is the agent of the creation of the universe. God’s “firs tness” in relation to the Primal Will is ambiguous, for
the Primal Will is the cause of the Primal Will. But on the other hand, the “firstness” of the Primal Will is not
absolute, for its very being is God’s activity.

A few pages later in the Lawh-i-Hikmat, Bahá’u’lláh seems to employ language similar to the Ismá‘ílís to
indicate these distinctions, when He says that “such men as were the source and the wellspring of Wisdom
never denied the moving Impulse [‘illa] behind these causes, nor the Creator [mubdi‘] or the Origin [mabda‘]
thereof.” 61 This language appears to mirror the Ismá‘ílí notion of the First Intellect or Primal Will as the cause
(‘illa) of causes, with God as the originator (mubdi‘) of the First Intellect. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá reiterates this princi-
ple in several places , such as in the following: “He, the invisible, the lofty and the incomprehensible, is pre-
ceded by no cause but rather is the Originator of the cause of causes.” 62

The writings of the Báb dis play a nearly identical use of terms to distinguis h the creativity of God from the

Lights of ‘Irfán

creativity of the Primal Will as first “cause.” Todd Lawson has cited pass ages from the Báb’s earliest work—
the Tafsír Súrat al-baqara—that employ the terms ibdá‘ (origination, from the same root as mubdi‘) and ikhti -
ra’ (invention) in what Lawson describes as the Báb’s “distinctive cosmogony entailing twin creative process-
es.”63 The employment of these and similar pairs of terms to make this same distinction has a rich tradition in
Is lamic philosophy, and is not confined to Ismá‘ílí cosmology. As William Chittick notes :

> For many Muslim thinkers, “innovation” [ibdá‘] is God’s creation without intermediary, whereas “cre-
> ation” (khalq) refers to his creation by means of a preexistent something. Thus one can say that God “inno-
> vated” the intellect, but he “created” everything by means of the intellect.64
As to the saying of J a‘fár as-Sádiq, this is also quoted and discussed in the Bábí and Bahá’í writings. Saiedi
has noted that in the Báb’s Sahífiy-i-‘Adlíyyih (Book of Justice), the Báb “explains that God created the
Primal Will from nothing through the causation of the Will itself without any external determination, and cre-
ated all other beings by the causation of the Will . . .” 65 In His Súriy-i-tawhíd, the Báb expounds the doctrine
at some length, explicitly citing the Imáms, and identifying the Primal Will with the First Remembrance, which
can be understood to refer to the archetypal reality of the Manifestation of God.66 This latter element of the
Báb’s treatment of this idea is expressed in another Tablet in which God addresses the Báb, as His
Manifestation, in these words:

> In truth I have created Thee through Thyself, then at My Own behest I have fashioned all things through
> the creative power of Thy Word. We are All-Powerful. I have appointed Thee to be the Beginning and the
> End, the Seen and the Hidden.67
‘Abdu’l-Bahá also quotes the tradition of Imám Ja‘fár, though in a slightly different form. This is in a com-
mentary on the very passages of the Lawh-i-Hikmat being examined here, and is cited in the course of explain-
ing the segment which is the s ubstance of the next stage of our inquiry, to which we now proceed.

> That which hath been in existence had existed before, but not in the form thou seest today. The world of
> existence came into being through the heat generated from the interaction between the active force [fá’il]
> and that which is its recipient [munfa’il]. These two are the same, yet they are different. . . . Such as com-
> municate the generating influence [fá’ilayn] and such as receive its impact [munfa’ilayn] are indeed cre-
> ated through the irresistible Word of God which is the Cause of the entire creation, while all else besides
> His Word are but the creatures and the effects thereof.68

In a Tablet to Shaykh ‘ Alí-Akbar Qúchání, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá elucidates and interprets the above paragraph
from the Lawh-i-Hikmat, as well as a later passage concerning Nature. 69 After quoting the first sentence of the
above, He writes: “From this blessed vers e it is clear and evident that the universe is evolving. In the opinion
of the philosophers and the wise this fact of the growth and evolution of the world of existence is also estab-
lished. That is to say, it is progressively transferred from state to state.” 70

> Concerning the next sentence, ‘ Abdu’l-Bahá writes:
> The world of existence came into being through the heat generated . . . that is to say: The matter [máddih]
> and primary matter [hayúlá, Greek hylé] of contingent beings is the ethereal power, which is invisible and
> known only through its effects, such as electricity, heat, and light—these are vibrations of that power, and
> this is established and proven in natural philosophy and is known as the ethereal matter [máddíyih-áthíríy-
> ih]. This ethereal matter is itself both the active force (fá’il) and the recipient (munfa’il); in other words,
> it is the sign of the Primal Will in the phenomenal world. “God created man by the Primal Will and the
> Primal Will by itself.”’ The ethereal matter is, therefore, the active force since light, heat and electricity
> appear from it. It is also the recipient, for as vibrations take place in it, they become visible.71

This verse and its commentary has brought us to the heart of Bahá’í cosmogony. This cosmogonic narra-
tive—of the creative interaction of active and passive forces—is the model for Bahá’í sacred narrative at every
level.

This narrative describes a creative unfoldment with respect to three levels of being. The firs t level is God,
and it is His acting—self-caused yet contingent—that occupies the second level. To this level can be given the
more-or-less equivalent names of the Word, the Command, or the Primal Will of God. The third level is that
of the creation, the phenomenal world. Earlier we noted that Shaykh Ahmad sets forth a similar model, giving

\[28\] The Beginni ng that Hath No Begin ni ng

the three levels the names Real Being, Absolute Being, and Delimited Being. The God-Command-Creation
scheme is emphasized by ‘ Abdu’l-Bahá in a number of places, such as in Some Answered Questions, where we
find Him saying:

> [T]he Sufis admit God and the creature, and say that God resolves Himself into the infinite forms of the
> creatures, and manifests like the sea, which appears in the infinite forms of the waves. These phenomenal
> and imperfect waves are the same thing as the Preexistent Sea, which is the sum of all the divine perfec-
> tions. The Prophets, on the contrary, believe that there is the world of God, the world of the Kingdom, and
> the world of Creation: three things.72

The Lawh-i-Hikmat describes the dynamics of the relationships between these three levels in terms of
process and semantic opposition. At the level of the world of God, there is no tension between opposites, nor
any duality. God is the coincidentia oppositorum, in Whom essence is identical with existence. All divine
attributes and names, which include polarities s uch as justice and mercy, merge into one at the level of the
Unknowable Essence, of the Hidden Treasure. This is elegantly expressed by Shaykh Ahmad in his al-Fawá’id
al-Hikmiyyah:

> With respect to His Quintessence (Glorified is He!), however, the matter is counter to that which is possi-
> ble with respect to creation. So from a single aspect He is Lofty in His Proximity, Proximate in His
> Loftiness. From a single aspect He is the Manifest in His Occulting, the Occult in His Manifesting. From
> a single aspect He is the First through His Lastness, the Last through His Firstness.73

This is an eternal and immutable state, described earlier as the station of the Hidden Treasure. The station
of God’s desire to be known can be identified with the second level, the world of Command. This second level
is God’s acting (fi’l), His Primal Will which was created through its elf. It is here that the first trace of duality
arises, a duality infinitely more subtle than the duality prevailing in the world of creation. From what is below
it, the world of Command appears as a perfect unity, but in relation to God it is nothing. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá said

> Though the ‘First Mind’ [the Primal Will] is without beginning, it does not become a sharer in the preex-
> istence of God, for the existence of the universal reality in relation to the existence of God is nothingness,
> and it has not the power to become an associate of God and like unto Him in preexistence. 74

But what exactly is this duality in the World of Command, and what, at this level, do the active and passive
forces signify? In looking for the answers in the Bahá’í writings, we find an abundance of codes employed.
These codes use symbols drawn from the Qur’án and traditions of Islamic thought, from Greek philosophy,
even from the esoteric science of alchemy. We’ll here explore several prominent “codes” relevant to the myth-
ic dimens ion at other levels of the Bahá’í teachings, and that are thus part of the experience of the sacred in
the modern-day Bahá’í community.

One code for the expression of the creative tension in the world of Command derives from the Qur’ánic cre-
ation myth. In it, a prominent theme concerns the word “Be,” by which God brings things into existence. There
are eight verses that employ the formula, one of which reads: “Verily, His Command, when He intends a thing,
is only that He says to it, “Be!” —and it is!”75

The Arabic word for “be” is kun, from the three-letter root káf (K), wáw (W, Ú), and nún (N). The impera-
tive form used in these Qur’ánic verses is written with just the two consonants káf and nún. Islamic thinkers
developed a number of symbolic interpretations of these verses, in which the káf and the nún were seen to rep-
resent primordial entities engaged instrumentally by God’s creative Command. One common interpretation
coupled this verse with the first verse of the sixty-eighth Súrih of the Qur’án: “Nún. By the Pen and that which
they write.”76 The káf was identified with the Pen, which is used symbolically in Islamic and Bahá’í texts for
the Primal Will or First Intelligence; while one of nún’s literal meanings— “inkpot” —was exploited to pro-
vide a symbol for the passive counterpart to the active Pen. 77

In an early Ismá‘ílí text by Abú Ya’qúb Sijistání (tenth century), we find a passage concerning the “signifi-
cance of ascribing the Command of God to these two letters—that is, to the káf and the nún,” in which it is
explained that

> anything having either a spiritual or a corporeal nature cannot appear except as one of a pair, [regardless
> of] whether it is sublime or mundane. Because the Command of God, the Almighty, initiates the formation

> of such pairs, it is represented by two letters so that it will be understood that God’s Command is the cause
> of everything in which duality is found to exist. . . . As joined together in this word whose very being
> derives from the Command of God, these two letters are witness on the part of every pair of creatures, each
> one being paired with its partner, just as the káf is the mate of the nún, that this condition in all cases
> derives from the Command of God, the Most High. 78

Later in the same work, Sijistání writes: “The first cause which is the oneness is called “the Word [kalima]
of God,” glorious is His majesty and it—that is, kalima—has four letters. . . . The káf [in kalima] corres ponds
to intellect, since it is the principle of existences and the origin of higher and lower substances , and in it is the
seed of corporeal and spiritual forms. This is like saying that the totality of all creatures appears with the kun
[of the divine Command kun] even before the nún.”79

These passages envision the two letters of the kun representing the principle of duality, a principle manifest
throughout contingent being, but with its source in the Command rather than in God. Sijistání states that every-
thing in exis tence is one of a pair; this perhaps derives from the many statements in the Qur’án to the effect
that all things were created in pairs. 80 Sijistání also relates the káf-nún duality to the composite nature of all
things, in which are necessarily combined matter and form. 81 He notes that the káf in kun is vowelled (muta -
harrik; a term used to signify a vowelled consonant, but lit. “in motion”), while nún in the word kun is not
vowelled (i.e., carries a sukún, which means literally “silence, repose, rest”). This is then related to the activ-
ity of káf and the passivity of nún, which are further said to be symbolic of prime matter and form, respec-
tively. 82

In the work of Shaykh Ahmad, the symbols of these two letters are treated similarly. The káf and the nún are
the active and passive forces which interact at the World of Command and thereby produce the lower realms
of existence; in his terminology, they constitute the dynamics of Absolute Being by which Delimited Being is
generated. The káf is said to symbolize the Will of God (mashíyyat), and nún, His Purpose (irádih). For Shaykh
Ahmad, in each composite thing existence is active while essence is passive. Will is responsible for the cre-
ation of the first while Purpose is res ponsible for the creation of the s econd. 83

In the Báb’s Tafsír-i-Bismilláh ar-Rahmán ar-Rahím, the same equation is made between these two letters
and the respective stages of Will and Purpose. He writes that the Will, represented by káf, is the father of all
things and is responsible for the creation of matter. Purpose, represented by nún, is the mother of all things and
is responsible for the creation of form. 84 The matter/form pair is closely related with that of existence/essence
mentioned by Shaykh Ahmad.

In the works of Bahá’u’lláh the “code” of the káf and the nún are also employed as symbols for the process
whereby cosmic creativity—through which the World of Creation issues from the World of Command by the
intrumentality of the Will of God—is assimilated to the creative power of the Manifestation of God, through
Whom human life and civilization is revolutionized and reformed. The symbol is used in the Kitáb-i-Aqdas,
paragraph 177, where it is translated as “the letters B and E.” In the notes to that text we read: “Shoghi Effendi,
in letters written on his behalf, has explained the significance of the ‘letters B and E.’ They constitute the word
‘Be,’ which, he s tates, ‘means the creative Power of God Who through His command causes all things to come
into being’ and ‘the power of the Manifestation of God, His great spiritual creative force.’” 85

As mentioned above, the káf and the nún have also been identified with three other pairs of active and pas-
sive realities: existence and essence, matter (or s ubstance) and form, and Will and Purpose. The first two pairs
can be treated together, as they revolve around similar philosophical problems. The Aristotelian concept of
hylomorphism (from hylé, prime matter, and morphé, form) holds any given thing to be composed of a poten-
tial material element and an actual formal element. The active/passive values to thes e categories, however, are
reversed in Shaykhí and Bahá’í texts, so that the active half of this pair is considered to be matter (mádda) or
substance (jawhar) rather than form (súrat). The ques tion of existence and essence embraces a history of philo-
sophical speculation distinct from the question of hylomorphism. It was of major concern and the subject of
lively debate in Islamic philosophy from the time of Ibn Síná, and can be summarized as the question of
whether a thing was primarily a mode of existence to which an essence functioned as a qualifying accident, or,
on the other hand, an es sential reality to which existence was the qualifying accident allowing it to appear in
outward manifestation.

\[30\] The Beginni ng that Hath No Begin ni ng

In the Bahá’í writings, the two questions—of hylomorphism and existence over essence—are answered in
essentially the same way. Any given thing in the universe is seen as a composite in which matter or substance
is an active element “received” by a delimiting form. In the same way, existence is the act, closely identified
with the Will, and essence is the particular reception of this act by which a thing comes to be as it is. The two
elements are simultaneous in the coming-into-being of the thing, each of them necessary. The “thingness” of
the thing lies in neither essence nor existence, but rather both of them through their interaction. However, mat-
ter or existence is higher in the hierarchy of being, as it depends solely on God’s acting, while form or essence
depends on matter/existence for its subsistence. Matter is called the “father,” form the “mother,” but both are
necessary in the “procreation” of the thing. These points are various ly express ed in the following quotations:

> For example it has been stated that all things are composed of two elements : the “receiver” [qábil] and
> the “received” [maqbúl]. By “received” is meant substance [mádda] and primary matter [huyúlá] and by
> “receiver” is meant the form [súrat] and shape which confines and limits the primary matter from its state
> of indefiniteness and freedom to the courtyard of limitation and definite form. 86
> [I]t is not possible for a thing to have an external existence and not to be formed into a shape because
> substance [mádda] and primal matter [hayúlá] in order to exist need form[súrat], while shape and form in
> order to appear need substance.87

> The sun is born from substance [máddih] and form [súrat], which can be compared to father and mother,
> and it is absolute perfection; but the darkness has neither substance nor form, neither father nor mother,
> and it is absolute imperfection.88
> Some think that the body is the substance [jawhar] and exists by itself, and that the spirit [rúh] is acci-
> dental and depends upon the substance of the body, although, on the contrary, the rational soul [nafs an-
> nátiqih] is the substance, and the body depends upon it. If the accident—that is to say, the body—be
> destroyed, the substance, the spirit, remains . . . the rational soul is the substance through which the body
> exists.89
> Certainly, that which is the substance [jawhar] is s uperior to that which is the accident, for the subs tance
> is the origin, and the accident is the consequence; the substance depends on itself, while the accident is
dependent on something else; that is to say, it needs a substance upon which to depend. 90

The inseparability of the halves of these pairs casts light on the s tatements of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá regarding the
ethereal matter quoted above. Another aspect of the unity of active and passive is that they are both manifes-
tations of the one Primal Will.

The other pair seen in the káf and the nún is that of mashíyyat and irádih, Will and Purpose. These are relat-
ed to the creative energies of the Command mentioned in the verses of the Qur’án that speak of the word kun,
such as the one already quoted:

> Verily, His Command, when He intends [iradih] a thing, is only that He says to it, “Be!” —and it is! 91
> Will is mentioned in a s imilar fashion:
> Alláh createth what He will [yashá’, same rt. as mashiyyat]. If He decreeth [qadá] a thing, He saith unto
it only: Be! [kun] and it is. 92

In the context of the Bahá’í writings, Will and Purpose are the two highest degrees of a seven-stage schema
which describes the process of the generation of all things, from the apex of the World of Command down to
their appearance in the world of creation. This schema goes back to a saying of the s ixth Imám, Ja ‘fár as-Sádiq,
which mentions the following degrees: Will (mashiyyat), Purpose (iráda), Determination (qadar), Decree
(qadá), Permission (idhn), Fixed Time (ajal), and Book (kitáb).93 Nader Saiedi has discussed this scheme in a
recent work, in which he notes that the “heart of these seven stages of creation is the union between existence
and essence.” 94

Beginning with treatment of this question in Shaykh Ahmad, the stage of Will is related to the creation of
existence, and Purpose with the creation of essence and its linking to existence.95 Returning to the Báb’s Tafsír-
i-Bismilláh ar-Rahmán ar-Rahím already referred to above, it will be remembered that He equated káf with
Will, nún with Purpose, and ascribes the creation of matter (mádda) to the former and of form (súrat) to the

latter. He states that Will is the father of all things, Purpose their mother, and then he relates this to a saying
attributed to Rahmán in which the latter is reported to have stated that he and ‘Alí were the father and moth-
er, respectively, of all Muslims.96 We begin to see from these sets of mutually implicating pairs how the dialec-
tic at the level of cosmogony can be assimilated to spiritual history.

We have already seen Bahá’u’lláh employing the concepts of Will and Purpose as interrelated counterparts
to the cosmic creation . . . “ —no sooner had the First Word proceeded, through the potency of Thy will and
purpose, out of His mouth, and the First Call gone forth from His lips than the whole creation was revolution-
ized . . .” —but He also refers to this process as the agency in the bringing into being of the laws and princi-
ples by which His community is organized: “. . . grant that Thy servants may not be kept back from this Divine
Law [sharí ‘ah] which, at Thy will [mashiyyat] and according to Thy pleasure [iráda], hath branched from Thy
most great Ocean.”97

In the following key passage from the Lawh-i-Hikmat, “Such as communicate the generating influence [fá’i -
layn] and such as receive its impact [munfa’ilayn] are indeed created through the irresis tible Word of God
which is the Cause of the entire creation, while all else besides His Word are but the creatures and the effects
thereof,” 98 the words fá’ilayn and munfa’ilayn could be literally translated as the twin agents and the twin
patients. Bahá’u’lláh has identified the fá’ilayn as fire and water and the munfa’ilayn as air and earth.99 In other
places, the Bahá’í writings engage the Graeco-Islamic tradition on this question, in which the two agents could
be defined as heat and cold, and the two patients moistness and dryness, with the four elements themselves
thus composed of active and passive natures.100 One could read this verse as saying that the Word of God is
responsible for the creation of the four Classical categories of elements and natures, which interact with each
other in the composition of all physical things . It can also be read as a reference to the dialectics of Will and
Purpose and of Determination and Decree within the World of Command.

These first four degrees of the Báb’s seven-stage schema are often treated as a distinct quaternity by both
Shaykh Ahmad and the Báb. In the Persian Bayán, the Báb dazzles the reader with over a dozen interrelated
symbolic quaternities, including (1) Will, (2) Purpose, (3) Determination, (4) Decree; and (1) fire, (2) air, (3)
water, and (4) earth. In the former, Will and Determination are the active counterparts of the passive elements
of Purpose and Decree. Thus, we can align these concepts to the verse in the Lawh-i-Hikmat, in that the fá’i -
layn, the two agents of fire and water, are equated in the Bayánic quaternal symbolism with the active cate-
gories of Will and Determination, while the munfa’ilayn, the two patients of air and earth, are equated with
Purpose and Decree. Following Shaykh Ahmad, the Bayánic quaterinities are divisions or stages of the one Act
or Acting of God, known also as the Primal Will. 101 The unity of the twin realities in the Primal Will can be
seen as identical to the unity of the four realities , but with the latter there is a greater measure of dynamic com-
plexity. 102

> Verily, the Word of God is the Cause that hath preceded the contingent world—a world which is adorned
> with the splendours of the Ancient of Days, yet is being renewed and regenerated at all times. 103
From the elements of Bahá’í cosmogony already surveyed, it is clear that creation is not a single, unique
event, from which time and creation stretch pass ively on. The activity of the divine Will is constant, and it is
upon this ceaseless activity that each existing thing depends. In the above passage from the Lawh-i-Hikmat,
an additional element to this relationship is introduced. The divine Will provides not simply a constant ground
of being for all existent things; it is responsible at every moment for the creation of the cosmos. This is entailed
by the active/passive categories in the Bahá’í writings.

There is a constant transformation of form and essence that consitutes the appearance of change and devel-
opment in the things around us. If we think of this transformation as existential motion, then the cause of such
motion will be either the forms that appear to be flitting from state to state, or it will be the substance (or exis-
tence) which these forms delimit and define into a particular thing. If the existential motion is caused by the
nature of the forms , then form is active. If it is caused by the nature of existence, then existence is active. Since
it has been seen that, in Bahá’í texts, existence is the active category while es sence or form is passive, we must
conclude that the appearance of change and development is due to the active nature of existence (or substance).

It has also been seen that existence derives from God’s acting, from His Will. It is thus fundamentally—one
could s ay literally—dynamic. As all particular things in the cosmos depend upon the Will, they are charactized

\[32\] The Beginni ng that Hath No Begin ni ng

by this dynamism in their very being, and cannot be considered to be “at rest” in any way. From one moment
to the next, all things subsist in the ground of God’s dynamic acting, being constantly regenerated and renewed.
Every instant is a cosmogonic moment, “in the beginning.”

Bahá’u’lláh is explicit about this idea of perpetual creation in the Kitáb-i-Badí‘ . Saiedi has summarized the
presentation as follows:

> Completion is simply and solely dependent on the will of God because creation is a continuous process.
> God does not create a being which then continues to exist on its own. On the contrary, everything is at
> every moment coming into existence and ceasing to exist. Bahá’u’lláh describes this as the continuous
> reflection of the different names of God, including the names of Life-Giver and Life-Taker. If nothing in
> the realm of creation is characterized by continuous existence, and everything is always created anew, then
> perfection or completion is only a matter of the divine act of creation. It is the will of God to bring into
> existence any being at any moment in any form He desires. 104
Another statement of this principle is found in Bahá’u’lláh’s Súriy-i-Vafá:

> Know thou moreover that every created thing is continually brought forth and returned at the bidding of
> thy Lord, the God of power and might.105
The idea of perpetual creation can also be considered as process, as in the following passage:

> The wonders of His bounty can never cease, and the stream of His merciful grace can never be arrested.
> The process of His creation hath had no beginning, and can have no end. 106
> The metaphors of breath and of sunlight have also been used in the Bahá’í writings to express this concept:
> I can have no doubt that should the holy breaths of Thy loving-kindness and the breeze of Thy bountiful
> favor cease, for less than the twinkling of an eye, to breathe over all created things, the entire creation
> would perish, and all that are in heaven and on earth would be reduced to utter nothingness. 107
> [A]ll the earth’s creatures require the bounty of the sun, for their very existence is dependent upon solar
> light and heat. Should they be deprived of the sun, they would be wiped out. This is the being with God,
as referred to in the Holy Books: man must be with his Lord.108

The doctrine of continuous cosmogony is of immense significance to the mythic dimension of the Bahá’í
Faith. According to this perspective, all operations of the Will of God are creative, and all events or entities
seen to represent God’s Will are endowed with the charisma of cosmogony. Likewis e, the Word of God,
whether in the sense of the primordial command “Be!” or in the sense of the scriptures brought by the Prophets
and Mess engers , is endowed with an infinite capacity to bring ever-new realities into being.

The nature of history is comprehended by Bahá’u’lláh in ways that exactly parallel the description of the
cosmogonic process. As the universe is a product of God’s Will, so is the historical process seen as a manifes-
tation of this dynamic and all-pervading reality. In the case of both cosmic unfoldment and the series of tem-
poral events, the engine that moves the process forward is depicted as a dialectic of opposing forces. Periods
of history, like the physical world, are described as springing from the Word of God, and depend upon the
ceaseless divine activity of this dialectic in order to develop. At the center of both space and time stands the
figure of the Manifestation of God, the vehicle of the Primal Will, at Whose appearance the world is recreat-
ed and time is begun anew. The two narratives—of creation and of history—employ the same stock of images
and codes, and modern Bahá’í life is, in many ways, the performance of these narratives: the same images and
codes serve to confer upon it historical meaning and world-creativity in the consciousness of those who live
it.

> rial related to Shaykh Ahmad used here. Hamíd notes, regarding the Shaykh’s unorth odox pos ition on th is question: “Here
> Shaykh Ah mad makes a philosophical commitment that is , as far as I know, unique in the history of philosophy of Muslim civ -
> ilization as well as neoplato nism in general. Reversing traditio nal hylo morphis m, Shaykh Ahmad asserts that matter is the
> active principle while form is the receptive principle. Revers e hylo morphis m is one of the fundamental prin ciples u nderlying
> Shaykh Ahmad’s entire metaphysics and cosmolog y, which is, in large part, an application of th is principle” (Metaphysics, p.

392 n 38).

> Mo men giv es “Fashion er” for qábil and “Fash ioned” for maqbúl. This rendering can b e misleadin g. The two terms come from
> the s ame root, meaning to receive, assent, comply, be willing or pas sive in relation to someth ing. From the root verb , these two

> the thing to which th e action is done (maqbúl is the th ing that is “received”). To illustrate, the verb root kataba, meanin g “to

> It is doubtless somewhat confusing to talk about th e action o f passivity, bu t “fas hioner” seems to convey the op posite of this,
