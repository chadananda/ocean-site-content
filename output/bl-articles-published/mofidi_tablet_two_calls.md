The immortal words of Marlow, the narrator in Joseph Conrad’s
enduring classic, Heart of Darkness, as he journeys deep into the
unknown, the darkness, to retrieve Kurtz, at one time civilization
personified, now the embodiment of crassness, avarice, barbarity.

Conrad’s novel, Heart of Darkness, is a rumination on the thin
line between civilization and barbarity. This relationship is also the
central theme of Abdu’l-Bahá’s Tablet of the Two Calls.
“Civilization is conjoined with barbarism,” (SWAB 297) Abdu’l-Bahá
states in the Tablet.

Arguably no subject is more apt to ponder in today’s political
(indeed politicized) and ideological climate than how thinly
civilization, a “terrible beauty,” to borrow from W.B. Yeats, cloaks
the darkness that envelops humanity. Here, we use Abdu’l-Bahá’s
civilization and barbarity construct to understand the capabilities of
humanity absent the “call of God,” “the Most Great Guidance.” We
employ the construct to also situate the geo-political and historical
events alluded to by Abdu’l-Bahá in His Tablet, events that

162 Tablet of the Two Calls

demonstrate how the boundaries between civilization and barbarity
at times overlap uncomfortably and at other times simply coexist
indistinguishably.

2\.       The Tab let’s Structure and The mes

The Tablet, known as the “Tablet of the Two Calls,” is found in
Selections From the Writings of Abdu’l Bahá , No. 225. The Tablet
is not dated. Certain references in the Tablet, though, suggest that it
was revealed circa 1907-1908.2

A brief word about the structure and themes of the Tablet. It is
divided into 32 paragraphs of varying length. A number of themes
are explored. Among these are: The two calls, namely call of
civilization and call of God; the intimate relationship between the
two, namely, that civilization (progress) is conjoined with barbarism
unless material civilization is confirmed by Divine Guidance;
happiness of mankind (happiness of the world of humanity) “lieth in
the unity of the human race, and that spiritual and material
developments are conditioned upon love and unity among all men;”
the dual nature of man; material progress being the result of
association and cooperation, while ruin the outcome of animosity
and hatred; unity in diversity; obedience, submission, and loyalty
towards one’s government.3

Here, we probe the theme of civilization and barbarity.4

3\.       Civilizing Barbarity

The Tablet begins with Abdu’l-Bahá describing, in His words,
“two calls to success and prosperity being raised from the heights of
happiness of mankind.” (SWAB 296)

One is the Call of civilization, which pertains to the world of
phenomena. It promotes the principles of material achievement;
trains the physical accomplishments of mankind; comprises the laws,
regulations, arts and sciences through which the world of humanity
has developed. The propagator and executive power of this call is
just government.5

The second call is the Call of God, whose spiritual teachings are
safeguards of the Everlasting glory, eternal happiness and
illumination of the world of humanity. It causes attributes of mercy
to be revealed in the human world and the life beyond. This Call is
founded upon the instructions and exhortations of the Lord and the
admonitions and altruistic emotions belonging to the realm of
morality which, like unto a brilliant light, brighten and illumine the

Lights of ‘Irfán Book Six 163

lamp of the realities of mankind. The penetrative power of the Call
of God is the Word of God.6

Abdu’l-Bahá then describes the relationship between these two
calls. He says that until material achievements, physical
accomplishments and human virtues are reinforced by spiritual
perfections, luminous qualities and characteristics of mercy, no fruit
or result shall issue therefrom, nor will the happiness of the world of
humanity, which is the ultimate aim, be attained.7 He cautions that
while, on the one hand, material achievements and the development
of the physical world produce prosperity, on the other hand dangers,
severe calamities and violent afflictions are imminent.8

Abdu’l-Bahá invites the reader to look at the orderly pattern of
kingdoms, cities and villages, with the attractiveness of their
adornments, the freshness of their natural resources, the refinement
of their appliances, the ease of their means of travel, the extent of
knowledge available about the world of nature, the great inventions,
the colossal enterprises, the noble discoveries and scientific
researches. He says that this vantage point compels but one
conclusion — namely, that civilization brings happiness and progress
to the human world.9

But a different vantage point warrants a different conclusion.

That vantage point is the discovery of destructive and infernal
machines, to the development of forces of demolition and the
invention of fiery implements, which uproot the tree of life. From
this perspective, it is evident that civilization is conjoined with
barbarism. Progress and barbarism go hand in hand, He says, unless
material civilization be confirmed by Divine Guidance.10

Let’s pause and reflect on this civilization-barbarity construct.

They are “conjoined,” Abdu’l-Bahá says. This means that civilization
and barbarity are separated by a very thin line. Civilization is
conceptualized in very precarious terms — a state of tension and
unyielding struggle between constructive aspirations and destructive
tendencies.

This is precisely the theme of Heart of Darkness. In this book,
Conrad attempts to come to terms with the brutal and exploitative
nature of the European colonization of Africa, using as a backdrop
the bloody history of the Congo Free State. Conrad’s narrator,
Marlow, is the commander of a riverboat looking for ivory to trade
in the Belgian Congo. Marlow travels into the heart of the Congo to
retrieve the enigmatic Mr. Kurtz, a promising young agent who has
disappeared into the bush. Along the way he learns that Kurtz has
gained supreme power over the natives of the land through the use
of extreme violence. Throughout Marlow’s harrowing journey,
Conrad maintains an unflinching focus on the crassness and avarice

164 Tablet of the Two Calls

of which human society is capable, ultimately revealing that the “the
horror” Kurtz fears lies within us all. Marlow’s encounter with the
mysterious and corrupted (and corrupting) Kurtz, who dies
proclaiming the “horror” of what he found in the Congo, is the
novel’s defining moment, when Marlow recognizes his kinship with
Kurtz’s corruption.

Joseph Conrad’s Heart of Darkness is a rumination on the
relationship between civilization and barbarity. The novel reminds us
that civility is not innate; that the values and beliefs we possess as
human beings, although passed down through countless generations
born into civilization, are not intrinsic. Furthermore, the novel
implies that, if submerged into a place of barbarity for a length of
time, a civil man might succumb, as evidently Kurtz did, to the
powers of darkness found in the human heart. Upon finding Kurtz,
Marlow fully realizes the impact of utter, enduring barbarity on the
heart of the urbane man. The values and beliefs civility had instilled
are powerless against Kurtz’s own heart of darkness as he descends
into his intrinsic, animalistic nature. Marlow recollects,

> I tried to break the spell–the heavy, mute spell of the
> wilderness–that seemed to draw him to its pitiless breast by
> the awakening of forgotten and brutal instincts, by the
> memory of gratified and monstrous passions. This alone, I
> was convinced, had driven him out to the edge of the
> forest, to the bush, towards the gleam of fires, the throb
> of drums, the drone of weird incantations; this alone had
> beguiled his unlawful soul beyond the bounds of permitted
> aspirations ... His was an impenetrable darkness.11
Kurtz has capitulated to murder, theft, and the temptation to be
god.

Heart of Darkness vividly offers insight into the capabilities of
man without restraint. We have here a terrifying and thought-
provoking look at how thinly civilization cloaks the darkness that
lives within us all.

Kurtz personifies civilization, but, after succumbing to barbarity,
is transmogrified into “a Flabby, pretending, weak-eyed devil of a
rapacious and pitiless folly.” The original Kurtz had been educated
partly in England.12 His mother was half-English, his father half-
French.13 All Europe contributed to the making of Kurtz.14 We have
an indictment of Europe here. Kurtz did poetry; spoke on love;
justice.15 And yet, despite (or perhaps in spite of) these civilizational
trappings, there was a hollowness about him. When he lived his
entire life in every detail during that supreme moment of complete
knowledge, Kurtz could only utter: “The horror!” “The horror!”16

Lights of ‘Irfán Book Six 165

Such was his pronouncement: a judgment upon the adventures of
his soul on earth. That’s his entire summation!

Conrad portrays the tense and uneasy relationship between
civilization and barbarity — the same relationship Abdu’l-Bahá
describes in the Tablet. Recall that Abdu’l-Bahá describes progress
and barbarism as going hand in hand. The barbaric tendencies can be
tempered, mitigated, if you like, only when “material civilization [is]
confirmed by Divine Guidance, by the revelations of the All-
Merciful and by godly virtues, and [is] reinforced by spiritual
conduct, by the ideals of the Kingdom and by the outpourings of
the Realm of Might.” (SWAB 297) Thus, absent spiritual
rejuvenation, growth, civilization decays and deteriorates into
barbarity. The divide between barbarity/civilization comes close to
collapsing into an area of mutual cohabitation.

Abdu’l-Bahá then illustrates just how uncomfortably civilization
and barbarity overlap:

> Consider that the most advanced and civilized countries of
> the world have been turned into arsenals of explosives, that
> the continents of the globe have been transformed into
> huge camps and battlefields, that the peoples of the world
> have formed themselves into armed nations, and that the
> governments of the world are vying with each other as to
> who will first step into the field of carnage and bloodshed,
> thus subjecting mankind to the utmost degree of
> affliction. (SWAB 297-8)
To develop a deeper appreciation of Abdu’l-Bahá’s comments,
we must take the political temperature of late 19th century-early
20th century.17 Recall that the Tablet was revealed sometime around
1907-1908.

By the late 1880s, all the desirable territories of Africa (and many
of the richest countries of the Middle East and Asia) had been
brought under European flags or had become “spheres of influence”
of the European powers. Western imperialism was continuing apace
in the first decade of 1900.

In 1907 Britain, Russia, and France formed the Triple Entente,
which now faced the Triple Alliance of Germany, Austria-Hungary,
and Italy, which had been formed in 1882. As can be expected, all
the governments claimed their intentions in forming these alliances
were purely defensive, but the sober truth was that the loose concert
of power which had existed from 1815 to 1870 had gradually been
replaced by two powerful, hostile alliances.

From 1890 to 1914, all diplomats and military officers (if not all
politicians generally) knew that the major nations of Europe were

166 Tablet of the Two Calls

engaged in an arms race and in the formation of ever tighter military
alliances. The network of painstakingly crafted and often
overlapping alliances seemed to give assurance that a general
conflagration would be avoided and regional disputes settled, as they
had been during most of the previous century.

As it turned our, appearances were deceiving. The formation of
these mighty alliances and the concomitant increases in armaments
rendered inevitable the war that began in August 1914. The
tightening bonds of the Triple Alliance and the Triple Entente
substantially increased the danger of general war in the decade
before 1914. The alliances, which were intended to maintain a
balance of power and to protect each member in case of aggression,
also meant that any serious local conflict could become general,
internationalized.

The opening years of the 20th century were marked by
turbulence and instability. In the years 1904-1905, the violent war
between Japan and Russia led to the humiliating destruction of
almost the entire Russian naval forces and its surrender of territories
it regarded as vital to its interests. This humiliation was to have
long-term domestic and international repercussions. On two
occasions during these opening years of the 20th century, war
between France and Germany over imperialist designs in North
Africa was narrowly averted. In 1911 Italian ambitions similarly
provoked a dangerous threat to international peace by the seizure
from the Ottoman empire of what is now Libya. International
instability had been further deepened when Germany, feeling
constrained by a growing web of hostile alliances, embarked on a
massive naval building program designed to eliminate the British
lead.

Percolating below these conflicts were tensions among the
subject peoples of the Romanov, Hapsburg and Ottoman empires.
Balts, Poles, Czechs, Serbs, Greeks, Albanians, Bulgars, Romanians,
Kurds, Arabs, Armenians, and a host of other nationalities all were
thirsting for their day of liberation.

Advances in science and technology were exploited for military
advantage. Military hardware triggered a massive arms race:
Machine guns, long-range cannon, “dreadnoughts”, submarines,
landmines, poison gas, and the possibility of equipping airplanes for
bombing attacks. All this weaponry would be deployed and refined
during the course of the coming war — thus cementing, as Abdu’l-
Bahá had warned, civilization and barbarity.

Abdu’l-Bahá, of course, prescribes a different combination,
fusion. “[T]his civilization and material progress,” He says, “should

Lights of ‘Irfán Book Six 167

be combined with the Most Great Guidance so that this nether world
may become the scene of the appearance of the bestowals of the
Kingdom, and physical achievements may be conjoined with the
effulgences of the Merciful.” (SWAB 298)

Now, Abdu’l-Bahá’s prescription may, at first blush, appear
commonsensical. A closer inspection, though, shows otherwise.
Indeed, Abdu’l-Bahá’s civilization and barbarity construct may be
employed to illuminate the latest, and widely acclaimed, political
study of the relationship between civilization and barbarity in the
context of 20th century Europe.18

As the title suggests, the author, an eminent historian, deals with
the political and cultural history of Europe during the past hundred
years. The author observes, as Abdu’l-Bahá did nearly a century ago,
the apparent contradiction between forces of civilization and those
of barbarity and proceeds to catalogue Europe’s achievements. She
observes that

> The ‘civilization’ of 20th century Europe has included
> many of the most revolutionary scientific advances in
> human history, the information explosion, some of the
> most original movements in art and music, and the creation
> of a “welfare state” offering greater and more varied
> opportunities to the ordinary citizen than any previous
> civilization. It has democratized both traditional
> intellectual and artistic culture, and the popular culture of
> mass media entertainment, travel, and athletics. It has
> witnessed the gradual extension of the concept of human
> rights and religious and racial toleration.19

The author then juxtaposes these achievements with Europe’s gross
and glaring failures. She says that

> But the same century has also seen the two most
> destructive wars in human history; a large number of
> authoritarian, arbitrary, and incompetent dictatorships;
> and, in the form of Nazism and Stalinism, the most vile
> and sadistic regimes of which we have any documented
> record. How can we understand the combination of such
> prodigious accomplishments and such devastating
> violence?20
The author strives to answer two basic questions: What are the
factors that produced European economic and scientific leadership?
And what are the factors that produced such horrific wars and
cultural conflict within the context of a single civilization?

She notes that understanding of any society requires a basic
comprehension of its economic foundations, its political systems,

168 Tablet of the Two Calls

and its shifting power relationships. She then explains 20th century
European barbarism in terms of deceit, military prowess, military
alliances, threats, promises, military and naval feints, financial
policies, personal traits of reigning rulers, poor decisions by players,
misperceived ambitions of the enemy, virulent nationalism.21

Abdu’l-Bahá’s Tablet suggests that these material explanations
are necessary, but not sufficient. Material explanations capture only
part of the narrative; the analysis must go deeper — and consider
civilization’s disconnect with, in Abdu’l-Bahá’s words, “the Most
Great Guidance.”

Abdu’l-Bahá explains the various dimensions of this Guidance.

He tells us that happiness of mankind lies in the unity and the
harmony of the human race, and that spiritual and material
developments are conditioned upon love and amity among all men.
He describes man as being endowed with two natures: one bent
towards moral sublimity and intellectual perfection, the other
towards imperfections: “If ye travel the countries of the globe ye
shall observe on one side the remains of ruin and destruction, while
on the other ye shall see the signs of civilization and development.
Such desolation and ruin are the result of war, strife and quarrelling,
while all development and progress are fruits of the lights of virtue,
co-operation and concord.”22

Abdu’l-Bahá offers an implicit, but no less trenchant, critique of
the perennial “survival of the fittest” mentality. He tells us that
“which is conducive to association and attraction and unity among
the sons of men is the means of the life of the world of humanity,
and whatever causeth division, repulsion and remoteness leadeth to
the death of humankind.”23 Here, Abdu’l-Bahá is making a simple,
though often overlooked, distinction between human survival and
animal survival.

As S.I. Hayakawa observed long ago, it is often taken for granted
that human nature is “selfish” and that life is a struggle in which
only the fittest may survive.24 According to this thesis, the basic law
by which man must live, in spite of his surface veneer of civilization,
is the law of the jungle. The “fittest” are those who can bring to the
struggle superior force, superior cunning, and superior ruthlessness.
Hayakawa explained the implications of this philosophy: The wide
currency of this philosophy of the “survival of the fittest” enables
those who act ruthlessly and selfishly to ease their consciences by
deluding themselves that they are merely following a “law of
nature.” Hayakawa then, inviting a hypothetically disinterested, and
arguably more honest, observer, asked whether the ruthlessness of
the tiger, the cunning of the ape, and obedience to the “law of the

Lights of ‘Irfán Book Six 169

jungle” are actually evidences of h u man fitness to survive.25 He
insightfully asked whether, if human beings are to pick up pointers
on behavior from the lower animals, there were not animals other
than beasts of prey from which one might learn lessons in survival.26

Pointing to the rabbit or the deer, Hayakawa asked whether
fitness may be defined as superior rapidity in running away from
one’s enemies. Similarly, pointing to the earthworm or the mole,
might we not define fitness as the ability to keep out of sight and
out of the way? Or, pointing to the oyster or the housefly, could
fitness not be defined as the ability to propagate one’s kind faster
than one’s enemies can eat them up? Thus, according to Hayakawa,
if we are looking to animals for models of behavior, if we simply
look to animals in order to define what we mean by “fitness to
survive,” there is no limit to the subhuman systems of behavior that
can be devised: we may emulate lobsters, dogs, sparrows, parakeets,
giraffes, skunks, or the parasitical worms, because they all obviously
survived in one way or another. We are still entitled to ask, however,
if h u man survival does not revolve around a different kind of
fitness from that exhibited by the lower animals.

Hayakawa then explained this fitness as the ability to cooperate,
to unify. Hayakawa found that cooperation within a species (and
sometimes with other species) is essential to the survival of most
living creatures, including man.

Juxtaposing Hayakawa’s insights with Abdu’l-Bahá’s utterances,
we learn that the unity called for by Hayakawa is attainable only in
the context of diversity. Abdu’l-Bahá explains that differences are
of two kinds:

> One is the cause of annihilation and is like the antipathy
> existing among warring nations and conflicting tribes who
> seek each other’s destruction, uprooting one another’s
> families, depriving one another of rest and comfort and
> unleashing carnage. The other kind which is a token of
> diversity is the essence of perfection and the cause of the
> appearance of the bestowals of the Most Glorious Lord.

(SWAB 304)
Abdu’l-Bahá illustrates this point using the example of the
flowers of a garden. He says:

> Consider the flowers of a garden: though differing in kind,
> colour, form and shape, yet, inasmuch as they are refreshed
> by the waters of one spring, revived by the breath of one
> wind, invigorated by the rays of one sun, this diversity
> increaseth their charm, and addeth unto their beauty. Thus
when that unifying force, the penetrating influence of the

> Word of God, taketh effect, the difference of customs,
> manners, habits, ideas, opinions and dispositions
> embellisheth the world of humanity. This diversity, this
> difference is like the naturally created dissimilarity and
> variety of the limbs and organs of the human body, for
> each one contributeth to the beauty, efficiency and
> perfection of the whole. When these different limbs and
> organs come under the influence of man’s sovereign soul,
> and the soul’s power pervadeth the limbs and members,
> veins and arteries of the body, then difference reinforceth
> harmony, diversity strengtheneth love, and multiplicity is
> the greatest factor for co-ordination.
> How unpleasing to the eye if all the flowers and plants, the
> leaves and blossoms, the fruits, the branches and the trees
> of that garden were all of the same shape and colour!
> Diversity of hues, form and shape, enricheth and adorneth
> the garden, and heighteneth the effect thereof. In like
> manner, when divers shades of thought, temperament and
> character, are brought together under the power and
> influence of one central agency, the beauty and glory of
> human perfection will be revealed and made manifest.
> Naught but the celestial potency of the Word of God,
> which ruleth and transcendeth the realities of all things, is
> capable of harmonizing the divergent thoughts,
> sentiments, ideas, and convictions of the children of men.
> Verily, it is the penetrating power in all things, the mover
> of souls and the binder and regulator in the world of
> humanity. (SWAB 304-5)

4\.      Conclusion

Abdu’l-Bahá’s “Tablet of the Two Calls” is at once a plea and a
promise. The plea is for unity, which, according to Abdu’l-Bahá,
trumps discord and isolation. The promise is two-pronged: unity will
result in welfare and happiness of humankind, while dissension and
discord are sure to cause hardship — human, political, economic,
intellectual.

This plea and promise, as Abdu’l-Bahá demonstrates, are amply
borne out by history. Man continues to insist on harming man. The
political and social climate that Abdu’l-Bahá alludes to in the Tablet
prevail today. Difference, disunity, and destruction continue to
marginalize unity and construction. Abdu’l-Bahá’s unity in diversity
paradigm enables us to mine the diversity inherent in humanity
without alienating the other: unity without uniformity, diversity
without fragmentation.

ground; that is to say, I will give a flavor of the overall thrust of the
Tablet and then explore one or two themes in more depth. Along the
way, I will embark on various excursions into politics, history, poetry,
and literature. These detours, especially that involving Conrad’s Heart
of Darkness, are meant to illuminate and dramatize the topic at hand.
