> **Abstract:**  
>   
> Although the New Age Movement (NAM) has been promulgated by its adherents and has been severely attacked by the Evangelical Churches during a few decades in this century, the NAM has only recently caught the attention of various scholars of religion. Some have noted that it is basically a western and perhaps postmodern phenomenon while others state that it has "surpassed" and out-dated Christianity as a worldview in the West. What is especially questionable is that some authors have identified the Bahá'í Faith as part of the New Age Movement. One possible explanation for this identification is perhaps that the NAM has been admittedly problematic to define and study. Yet, certain areas have been identified as the NAMs salient characteristics, e.g.: millennialism, holism and healing, eclecticism and syncretism, monism and pantheism, consciousness and paradigm, evolution and reincarnation.  
>   
> Although it is possible to identify a variety of similarities and differences between the NAM and the Bahá'i Faith, such comparisons or correlations do not establish any causation or historical influences. More importantly, when one compares some of the most central tenets of the NAM: its theology, cosmology, ontology, soteriology, and especially its view of reincarnation, it becomes increasingly evident that the NAM and the Bahá'í Faith stand far apart and that the latter is more akin to the ancient prophetic religions.  
>   
> However, the NAM and the Bahá'i Faith do not only differ on the theoretical levels but also in their origins and organisational structures. The NAM is loosely structured and has been defined as a "meta-network"; hence it has no common founder or established origin, no holy canon, no unifying doctrine, no common mythology or ritual. The Bahá'i Faith, on the other hand, claims a new and unique revelation from God, revealed by two prophet-founders; it has a holy canon, a unifying doctrine, and it contains relatively few myths or rituals. In this respect, the Bahá'i Faith more resembles the classical religions rather than the NAM.

The New Age Phenomenon and the Bahá’í Faith

Zaid Lundberg

he New Age phenomenon has received very little attention in the Bahá’í Faith and Bahá’í scholar-

T     ship. Udo Schaefer, the great pioneer of Bahá’í scholarship, was probably the first to address this

issue in 1992.1 Two years later, in a special volume of The Bahá’í Studies Review devoted to the
theme of Bahá’í scholarship, Stephen Lambden pointed out the need for Bahá’í scholars to study “The
Age of Aquarius,” and further said that “Such Bahá’ís as are interested in this area should become
acquainted with aspects of ‘new age’ philosophy and Bahá’í reactions to it through the study of sensible
sources.”2 Simultaneously, and equally importantly, he suggested that:

> Bahá’ís need to spell out, in light of Shoghi Effendi’s writings and other scriptural texts, our
> concept of the new age and its full realisation of the future....3
Consequently, in order to spell out “our concept of the new age” it is, on the one hand, necessary to
examine the very idea of a “new age” by studying “sensible sources” i.e., to draw upon the sources of aca-
demic scholarship. On the other hand, in order to obtain “our concept of the new age” it is crucial to
study the “new age” in the light of the Bahá’í scriptures.

Since the pioneering work of Schaefer and the scholarly advice of Lambden, the author of this paper
and Paul Dode nh off have, independently of each other,4 recognized the importance of exam in ing the
relationship between the Bahá’í Faith and the New Age phenomenon (NAP).5 Yet, the study of the rela-
tionship between the Bahá’í Faith and the NAP has barely begun, but in order to satisfy Lambden’s two
perspectives, the purpose of this paper, is to briefly introduce the NAP and the Bahá’í Faith by answer-
ing the following set of questions:

> 1) Why should the relationship between the NAP and the Bahá’í Faith be examined?
> 2) What is “New Age” and how is it defined?
> 3) What are some of the similarities and differences between the NAP and the Bahá’í Faith?

4) How may the NAP be evaluated from a Bahá’í perspective?

The Relationship Between the New Age Phenomenon and the Bahá’í Faith

First of all, some authors have associated the Bahá’í Faith with the NAP and have grouped it together
with Theosophy, neo-Hindu reform movements, and neo-Sufism.6

Although, Kyle writes that “The Bahá’í faith has more tenuous connections with the New Age” he con-
tinues to state that:

> While it [Bahá’í Faith] came out of Sufism [sic!] it has lost much of its mystical qualities. Yet
> it does teach some ideas prevalent in the New Age—oneness in world religions and the politi-
> cal order, and a coming new age.7
Secondly, it ought to be studied since some scholars of religion claim that the NAP has surpassed and
outdated Christianity as a belief-system/world-view in the West.8 Thirdly, if the above statements are
true, and if we as Bahá’ís, are to be successful in our proclamations and teachings, especially with “Entry
by troops,” it is vital to understand this “new” belief-system or world-view. These three reasons, taken
together, may suffice to persuade Bahá’í scholars to further examine the relationship between the NAP
and the Bahá’í Faith more thoroughly.9

What is “New Age” and How is it Defined?

In a very real sense, humanity is approaching not only a new century but a new millennium. Hence,
> even from a secular and temporal perspective (which, in the West, is based on the birth of Christ)
> humanity is living at the threshold of a “new age.” It is also well known that millenarian and apoca-
lyptic movements flourish at such critical turning points in history.10

Although the exact dating of the origin of the NAP is highly debated (as will be seen below), it has
> only recently caught the attention of scholars of religion. It has largely been ignored for two reasons:
> 1) it was seen as a “fadd is h” or appeared to be “shallow,” and 2) it has no clear boundaries (which will
> be discussed below),11 and therefore, historically and methodologically, it has been much easier to
> study what has been labeled “New Religious Movements” (NRMs) since they are rather well def in ed
> and therefore more accessible for social and religious research. Furthermore, some scholars maintain
> that the NAP is a large “sub-culture” and that it is part of a much greater “paradigm shift” or “cul-
> tural shift” in the West, or that it is basically a “post-modern” phenomenon, while others state that it
> has by far surpassed and out-dated Chr is ti anity as a belief-system in the West and therefore should be
> evaluated as a “post-Christian” phenomenon.12 Others still, predict that the NAP as a movement is a
> transient fad, that it is doomed, but that its ideas may continue to inf luence and transform the pre-
sent society.13

The NAP has, by a number of scholars, admittedly been problematic to define and study. For exam-
> ple, it is on the one hand seen to have ancient historical roots14 (Hellenism 300 BCE, Gnosticism
> 100–300 CE, Hermetism 1500 CE), and, on the other hand, it is described as a phenomenon that began
> in the counterculture of the [19]60s–70s. These extreme perspectives can be seen by the descriptions by
> two leading scholars in this field. For example, Robert Ellwood sees the New Age as “a modern
> revival...of a long-standing tradition of what may be called the alternative spirituality of the west,” and
> that it can be traced to “the Greco-Roman world” via “Renaissance occultism...eighteenth century
> Freemasonry, and nineteenth-century Spiritualism and Theosophy,”15 while Gordon Melton writes that
> “the New Age movement is a relatively new phenomenon. It developed in the late 1960s and emerged
as a self-conscious movement in the early 1970s.”16

The NAP has further been def in ed and/or described as:
> • a movement,17 religion,18 and quasi-religion19
> • non-occult/non-esoteric,20 wile others say that it is occult/esoteric21

• centering on the Self/narcissism,22 while others state that it is basically involved with social/global
transformation23

Moreover, the NAP has also been def in ed by its own adherents. For example, a leading New Age
author, David Spangler,24 discerns four levels of the NAP characterized as:

> 1) commercial (superficial)
> 2) glamour and popular culture (media attention)
> 3) “an image of change” (transformation/paradigm shift)
4) the birth of the sacred and a resacralizing of life on earth, the “new age is fundamentally a spiri-
tual event”

From this brief overview it is possible to conclude and stress that the term “New Age” (like most reli-
> gious terms and concepts) is multifaceted, highly ambiguous, and has many dimensions and levels, and
> therefore is rather difficult to describe and def in e.25

Sim il ar i ties and Differences Between New Age Phenomenon and the Bahá’í Faith

Despite the difficulties of def in ing the NAP, Lewis has enumerated some general characteristics of
> NRMs (as defined by Ellwood) which he also think are applicable to the New Age movement.26 It is pos-
> sible to compare these general characteristics of the NAP (in bold) to the Bahá’í Faith as follows:

\[70\] Lights of ‘Irfán

• Emphasis on Healing

Healing is not emphasized in the Bahá’í Faith although the concept of healing does occur in the Bahá’í
writings. e.g., the Manifestations of God are sometimes referred to as “Divine physicians” and the rev-
elation of Bahá’u’lláh is symbolically compared to an “Elixir.”27 It is also recognized that humans can
heal through spiritual means, especially through prayer.28
• A Desire To Be “Modern” and Use Scientific Language

The Bahá’í Faith is sometimes described as a “mo de r n” religion,29 especially suitable for this mod-
ern age, and that religion and science are seen as complementary is one of its fund am e n tal princi-
ples.30 It is the religious language, however, and not the scientific language, that dom in ates the Bahá’í
writings.31
• Eclecticism and Syncretism

The Bahá’í Faith emerged historically in the Near- and Middle East, i.e., mainly within an Islamic reli-
gious context (both Shi’i and Sunni), although a variety of religions also coexisted (and still do) within
this large area: Zoroastrianism, Judaism, Christianity, and a variety of Sufi orders. It is quite clear, judg-
ing from the Bahá’í writings, that Bahá’u’lláh was familiar with especially Islam and Christianity, but
also with Zoroastrianism and, to some extent, even Hinduism.32 It is possible to point out both eclecti-
cism and syncretism within Bahá’í, but this is also the case for other religions.33
• A Monistic and Impersonal Ontology

It is here where the Bahá’í Faith clearly differs from the NAP, since the Bahá’í Faith ontology basical-
ly is panentheistic, i.e., God permeates the cosmos, and His attributes are reflected in creation.
Bahá’u’lláh, for example, states that:

> The whole universe reflecteth His glory, while He is independent of, and transcendeth His
> creatures. This is the true meaning of Divine unity. He Who is the Eternal Truth is the one
> Power Who exerciseth undisputed sovereignty over the world of being, Whose image is reflect-
> ed in the mirror of the entire creation.34
Yet, God cannot be identified with, or reduced to, His creation since God is simultaneously seen as
“independent of, and transcendeth His creatures.” Thus, God is ultimately transcendental which is clear-
ly portrayed in another passage by Bahá’u’lláh:

> Immeasurably exalted is He [God] above the striv in gs of the human mind to grasp His Essence,
> or of human tongue to describe His mystery. No tie of direct intercourse can ever bind Him
> to the things He hath created, nor can the most abstruse and most remote allusions of His crea-
> tures do justice to His being. . . He is and hath ever been veiled in the ancient eternity of His
> own exalted and indivisible Essence, and will everlastingly continue to remain concealed in
> His inaccessible majesty and glory.35 [Emphasis mine]
Although God sometimes is described in agnostic or negative terms,36 God is also described in per-
sonal and positive terms.37 In other words, God is seen both as a deus absconditus (a hidden God) and a
deus revelatus (a revealed God) described by Bahá’u’lláh as “the Visible and the Invisible” or even “the
most manifest of the manifest and the most hidden of the hidden!”38
• Optim is m, Success Orientation, and a Tendency to Evolutionary Views

The Bahá’í Faith may in general be described in optim is tic and progressive terms but yet, there are
also notions of decline, crises and even “apocalyptic” scenarios.39 The evolutionary views are particu-
larly strong and Darwin’s theory of evolution is not denied, but rather reinterpreted in, what could be
called, a ”spiritual theory of evolution.”4 0
• Emphasis on Psychic Powers

To develop psychic powers is not only de-emphasized in Bahá’í but even strongly discouraged.41 Rather,
it is the spiritual attributes and powers that should be developed, and which, ultimately, are seen as a
reflection of the attributes and powers of God. For example, Bahá’u’lláh writes that:

> Upon the reality of man . . . He [God] hath focused the radiance of all of His names and attrib-
> utes, and made it a mirror of His own Self.42
Already here in this very brief overview and somewhat superficial comparison, it is possible to dis-
> cern that it is very difficult to ascertain whether Bahá’í matches the NAP or not. On some points it cer-
tainly does, but on others it clearly does not.43

It is also possible to compare the Bahá’í Faith to another scheme, developed by Hammer, and which
> he refers to as “An aerial view of the New Age movement.”44
• Cosmos is an Unbroken Whole

There are a few passages in the Bahá’í writings that could support such a view. For example ‘Abdu’l-
Bahá writes that:

> all parts of the creational world are of one whole...All the parts are subord in ate to the whole.
> The contingent beings are the branches of the tree of life while the Messenger of God is the
> root of that tree.45
• There is a directionality in this wholeness

This statement could be equated with a “Bahá’í teleology,” and teleological statements are readily found
in the Bahá’í writings:

> Thou didst wish to make Thyself known unto men; therefore, Thou didst, through a word of Thy
> mouth, bring creation into being and fashion the universe.46
According to these passages, God expresses a wish, or desire, from his side, to be known, and this is
> ultimately upheld as the generating impulse of creation.47 Thus, God’s desire to be known, and God’s cre-
> ation of human beings in order to be known, appear to be intimately complementary. From another per-
> spective, Bahá’u’lláh states that “The purpose all creation is the revelation of this most sublime, this
> most holy Day, the Day known as the Day of God.”48 Moreover, Bahá’u’lláh states that the existence and
> life of “the destiny of the true believer” is “to be regarded as the originating purpose of all creation.”49
> ‘Abdu’l-Bahá speaks of man as “part of the universal plan”50 and that “The purpose the creation of man
> is the attainment of the supreme virtues of humanity through descent of the heavenly bestowals.” 51
Sim il arly, Shoghi Effendi refers to:

> a greater Plan, one and ind iv isible, whose Source is God, whose author is Bahá’u’lláh, the the-
> ater of whose operations is the entire planet, and whose ultimate objectives are the unity of
> the human race and the peace of all mankind.52
• This Wholeness is Permeated by a Power or Energy Which Connects Us with the Cosmos

According to the Bahá’í view, the power or energy which permeates the cosmos is often referred to as
the Holy Spirit. For example, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá writes that:

> that both interaction and cooperation are evident and proven amongst all beings, whether large or
> small. In the case of large bodies interaction is as manifest as the sun, whilst in the case of small
> bodies, though interaction be unknown, yet the part is an indication of the whole. All these inter-
> actions therefore are connected with that all-embracing power which is their pivot, their center,
> their source and their motive power.53
Elsewhere he also says that:

> All created forms are progressive in their planes, or kingdoms of existence, under the stimulus
> of the power or spirit of life. This universal energy is dynamic. Nothing is stationary in the
> material worlds of outer phenomena or in the inner world of intellect and consciousness.54
Although it was seen above that the universe is seen as an unbroken whole, there are numerous passages
> in the Bahá’í writings which makes it clear that the cosmos also is divided in “planes” or ”kingdoms,” and
> consequently, that there exists a certain “spiritual hierarchy.”55 The most crucial difference, however, is that
> the cosmos is viewed in neither monistic nor pantheistic terms, but that it is panentheistic.

• Humanity has Mismanaged Its Own Wholeness (The Relationship Between Body—Soul)

This is not emphasized in the Bahá’í Faith. It is rather humanity’s relationship with God, the
Manifestations of God, and with the true nature of religion, that have been mismanaged.56 For example,
Bahá’u’lláh states that:

> The vitality of men’s belief in God is dying out in every land; nothing short of His wholesome
> medicine can ever restore it. The corrosion of ungodliness is eating into the vitals of human
> society; what else but the Elixir of His potent Revelation can cleanse and revive it?57
Here one may recognize the metaphor of the Manifestation of God as the “Divine Physician” who,
through his “wholesome medicine” is able to restore and revive human society from a disease, described
as the “corrosion of ungodliness.” This may be interpreted as either “atheism,” or the lack of vitality in
one’s belief, or spirituality. It is especially noteworthy that the terms “potent Revelation” is equated with
the “Elixir.” Notice also that Bahá’u’lláh is referring to the downfall of religiosity “in every land,” which
is suggestive of a global process of secul ar iz ation. It is hence possible to equate the malaise of human-
ity with the decline of religion. This would accentuate the intimate and mutual relationship between reli-
gion and humanity.58
• The Planet Earth is a Wholeness

This is clearly stated in the Bahá’í writings. The following passages by Bahá’u’lláh may exemplify such
a view:

> Regard ye the world as a man’s body, which is affected with diverse ailments, and the recovery
> of which dependeth upon the harmonizing of all of its component elements.59
> Regard the world as the human body which, though at its creation whole and perfect, hath been
> afflicted, through various causes, with grave disorders and maladies.60
> With regard to the former point, it is evident from these passages that humanity has misman-
> aged its relationship with the planet earth as well.
• Every Human Being has a Unique Place in This Wholeness
This can also be confirmed in the Bahá’í-writings. For example, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá states that:

man is but a part or member of that whereof nature is the whole.61
Continuing, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá further likens man with a drop and the universe with the ocean, and asks:

> Is it conceivable that a drop should be imbued with qualities of which the ocean is completely
> deprived? The drop is a part; the ocean is the whole.62

• Human Beings Do Not Only Live This Life, But Have Transmigrated Through a Chain of
Existences and Will Reincarnate Many More Times

Here is another crucial difference between the NAP and the Bahá’í Faith, although the latter would be
in agreement with the first two sentences in that: 1) there is life after death,63 and 2) humanity, as a
species, has transmigrated through a series of prior existences (the mineral-, vegetable-, and an im al-king-
doms), but the Bahá’í writings do not harmonize with the concept of reincarnation,64 since it is believed
that the human soul is created at the moment of conception,65 and that after this earthly existence, it
evolves into a new dimension—the spiritual kingdom.66

> • There Are Other, Perhaps Better Paths to Knowledge Than the Senses and The Rational Mind
> This is clearly confirmed in the Bahá’í writings. For example, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá speaks of “four methods
of acquiring knowledge”: 1) the senses, 2) reason, 3) tradition, and 4) the bounty of the Holy Spirit. If
the first is considered “imperfect” the last is described as “infallible and indubitable.”67

• Various Non-Christian Religions Contain Such Ideas or an Ancient Wisdom Which Can
Benefit Us Today

This is more difficult to answer since the Bahá’í Faith on the one hand upholds all religions/cultures’ spir-
itual heritage originates, ultimately, with a Manifestation of God.68 For example, Bahá’u’lláh states that:

> The light which these souls [The Prophets and Messengers of God] radiate is responsible for the
> progress of the world and the advancement of its peoples. They are like unto the leaven which
> leaveneth the world of being, and constitute the an im ating force through which the arts and
> wonders of the world are made manifest.69
Yet, on the other hand, the Bahá’í Faith also maintains that all religions/cultures decline and that they,
eventually, become obsolete and malfunctioning.70 In other words, although the various religions/cul-
tures still contain an ancient wisdom, to some degree, they are, nonetheless, seen as inadequate to solve
the world’s current spiritual and global problems. However, the Bahá’í Faith also stresses “unity in diver-
sity” and advocates the richness and preservation of the great variety of humanity’s cultural heritage.71
• Humanity Faces a Spiritual and Societal Revolution, A New Age

This is probably one of the most fundamental features of the Bahá’í Faith and the very title of
Esslemont’s book—Bahá’u’lláh and the New Era—clearly conveys this theme.72 The Bahá’í writings repeat-
edly emphasize that humanity is facing an unprecedented spiritual-, societal-, and global revolution, and
that it is at the threshold of a new age, a new world order, the lesser- and the Most Great Peace, and ulti-
mately, the Kingdom of God on Earth.73

Once again sim il ar problems of compar is on emerge as with the previous review. The Bahá’í Faith
seems to fit on a number of points, but then again, it clearly rejects such crucial categories as panthe-
ism, monism, and reincarnation.

Consequently, since: a) the definition of the New Age is highly problematic and contains a variety of
extreme positions, and b) that the Bahá’í Faith seems to both fit and not fit, it comes as no surprise that
it is possible to both identify it with, and to separate it from, the NAP.

However, although such compar is ons clearly are possible to make, they do not establish causation i.e.,
they do not clarify the problem of historical influences. For example, if one upholds that the NAP is a
relatively new phenomenon ([19]60s-70s), then the Bahá’í Faith is a considerably older phenomenon, since
it originated a century earlier (1844–63). If one states that NAP has its roots in the synthesis created by
Theosophy during the nineteenth century, one is faced with yet another problem, since the Bahá’í Faith
not only emerged several decades before the birth of the Theosophical Society (1875), but that it also
arose outside a Euro-American context. In addition, if one maintains that the NAP has “a long tradition
in the west,” with roots in Hellenism, then one comes across still another problem, since He ll e n is m
expanded not only to ancient Persia (where Zoroastrianism was a state religion at the time being), but all
the way to India (where both Hinduism, Buddhism and Ja in ism were already established). Hence, in order
to explain some of the sim il ar i ties and differences between the NAP and the Bahá’í Faith, one ought
rather to trace its influences elsewhere, especially the Bábí Faith, Shaykh is m, Shí’i Islam, Sufism, Neo-
Platonism etc.

In the comparisons between the NAP and the Bahá’í Faith some crucial “theoretical” differences were
noticed, but it should also be mentioned that there also are some “practical,” “structural,” or “organ iz a-
tional” differences. As was mentioned earlier, the NAP is a very loosely structured phenomenon.
According to Heelas, it should

> not be taken to imply that the New Age is in any sense an organ iz ed entity. Far from being cen-
> trally administered, it is compr is ed of diverse modes of operation: well-organ iz ed NRMs and com-
> munities...networks...one-to-one paths within...centers...the week-end tra in ing seminars, holiday
> homes...festivals...gatherings...shops...clubs...schools.74
Thus, the NAP is structured in what has been labeled a “meta-network” (a net-work of net-works) rather
than as a unified and hierarchical organization.75 In other words, and taken as a whole, in the NAP there is:

> •   no   founder
> •   no   holy canon
> •   no   central doctrine76

•   no   myth or ritual77

\[74\] Lights of ‘Irfán

The Bahá’í Faith, on the other hand, which claims a new and unique revelation from God, clearly rec-
ognizes and exhibits:

> •   two specific founders (Báb/Bahá’u’lláh)
> •   a holy and vast canon
> •   a unified set of doctrines78
> •   relatively few myths and rituals79
In contrast to the NAP, the Bahá’í Faith moreover consists of:

• a well-def in ed organ iz ation and adm in is t ration that is established on local-, national-, and interna-
tional levels. Nevertheless, there is no priesthood, but individual Bahá’ís elect their representatives
democratically.80

In comparing the NAP with the Bahá’í Faith, the latter resembles more the so called “classical” reli-
gions (especially Judaism, Christianity, and Islam), and, to some degree, the NRMs, although such com-
par is ons also are highly problematic. It is possible to in this context consider what Wittgenstein called
“family resemblances”81 between various themes (as we have seen in the compar is ons earlier), but such a
resemblance can be found in, and between, other religions as we ll .
The New Age Phenomenon Evaluated From a Bahá’í Perspective
Since the NAP is so highly complex and elusive, it is not very easy to evaluate it. However, the most
important points of agreements between the NAP and the Bahá’í Faith seem to be Spangler’s third and
fourth levels of the New Age: i.e., that it is “an image of change” (transformation/paradigm shift),82 and
that it may reflect the birth of the sacred and a resacralizing of life on earth and that the “new age is
fundamentally a spiritual event”. Indeed, the very idea of “transformation” is central to the Bahá’í Faith.
Thus, Bahá’u’lláh, for example, asks the following question:

> Is not the object of every Revelation to effect a transformation in the whole character of
> mankind, a transformation that shall manifest itself both outwardly and inwardly, that shall
> effect both its inner life and external conditions?83
Moreover, it is interesting that, according to Spangler, “the phrase an emerging planetary culture is
replacing the phrase an emerging new age”84 and sim il arly, that Kyle states that:

> Global unity is central to New Age political thought and will receive further attention later.
> New Agers see the world as already unified by modern transportation and communication sys-
> tems. But they also seek global political unification. There is to be a new world order charac-
> te r iz ed by internationalism.... The notion of global is basic to the New Age vision. Such a con-
> cept goes by a number of names: planetary unity, planetization, world order, planetary con-
> sciousness, and the new global society.85
Such views are in complete harmony with the Bahá’í view.86 However, a certain paradox with the NAP
can be noticed, since on one hand the Western world has, especially since the Enlightenment and the
Industrial Revolution, become gradually more secul ar iz ed, atheistic, and mate r i al is tic, and yet, on the
other hand, the NAP seems to be an indication of an opposite trend—an increasing process of spiritu-
al iz ation.

It is possible that this paradox may be solved by the same token as the concepts of “an old” and “new
world order,” and in this context, the term “order” may be seen as interchangeable with the term “age.”
In the Bahá’í writings, however, the emergence of the two orders, or ages, are not seen as mutually exclu-
sive, but are rather evaluated as two simultaneous and parallel processes. For example, according to
Shoghi Effendi:

> We stand on the threshold of an age whose convulsions proclaim alike the death-pangs of the
> old order and the birth-pangs of the new. Through the generating influence of the Faith
> announced by Baha’u’ ll ah this New World Order may be said to have been conceived. We can,
> at the present moment, experience its stir r in gs in the womb of a trava il ing age—an age wait-
> ing for the appointed hour at which it can cast its burden and yield its fairest fruit.87

This present age is seen as being on the “threshold of an age” i.e., between two world orders—the
“death-pangs of the old order” and the ”birth-pangs of the new.” A similar expression is found in the
writings of Bahá’u’lláh where he says: “Soon will the present-day order be rolled up, and a new one spread
out in its stead.”88 These and earlier passages by the Bahá’í authors indicate that the world, at present, is
in a major phase-transition between two major cycles. Indeed, Shoghi Effendi also refers to this present
age as the “Age of Transition.”89

This age is furthermore represented not only by two opposing world orders, but also by two major
concurring processes. Again, to quote from Shoghi Effendi:

> A twofold process, however, can be distinguished, each tending, in its own way and with an accel-
> erated momentum, to bring to a climax the forces that are transforming the face of our planet. The

It is interesting to note that both processes are being described as “accelerating” and that they are
reaching a climax which will be “transforming the face of our planet.” The first process is described as
“integrating” and “constructive” whereas the latter is depicted as “disruptive” and “disintegrating.”
Furthermore, the former process is associated with the “nascent Faith of Bahá’u’lláh” and the “New
World Order.” The second process, although portrayed as “destructive,” is seen in a positive light in that
it tears down the “antiquated barriers that seek to block humanity’s progress towards its destined goal.”
This barrier is hence related to a civ il iz ation which has “refused to answer to the expectation of a new
age.” This last sentence could refer to: 1) the revelation of Bahá’u’lláh in general, and/or 2) the reception
of Bahá’u’lláh’s letters, sent to various religious and political leaders in the nineteenth century.91

Thus, rather than viewing the NAP as an isolated phenomenon, as a “fadd is h”, a “sub-culture,” a
Western “post-modern” or “post-Christian” phenomenon, or even just a cultural shift or paradigm shift,
it could be viewed within a much larger context—in the Bahá’í context of the transition of the old and
new world orders, that mankind is coming of age, of religious cycles, and ultimately, within the context
of progressive revelation.92

That this age is unique in a Bahá’í perspective is clear since ‘Abdu’l-Bahá says that “This age is indeed
as a hundred other ages.”93 It is therefore appropriate to end this paper, written at the end of this centu-
ry, with a quote from ‘Abdu’l-Bahá who, at the beginning of this century, said:

> Now the new age is here and creation is reborn. Humanity hath taken on new life. The autumn
> hath gone by, and the reviving spring is here. All things are now made new.... Renewal is the
> order of the day. And all this newness hath its source in the fresh outpour in gs of wondrous
> grace and favour from the Lord of the Kingdom, which have renewed the world. The people,
> therefore, must be set completely free from their old patterns of thought, that all their atten-
> tion may be focused upon these new principles, for these are the light of this time and the very
> spirit of this age.94
