Abstract

Probably the most ancient and fundamental question of all
times on the individual’s and the collective mind is: “Is there a
God?”

The answer to this question has profound implications, and
indeed direct impact on the life of mankind and how it looks
upon the very meaning and purpose of life. It can change what
we strive for, how we look at ourselves and others, what goals
we set, and how we live.

In regards to proof of existence of God, opinions range from
“there is no god,” to “the existence of God cannot be proven or
disproven,” to “the existence of God can be proven.” Abdu’l-
Baha was of the latter mind, and this paper follows His lead.

The meaning of proof, types of proof, and conditions of the
existence of a proof are explored. A few of the classical proofs
of the existence of God are briefly examined. Some of the
modern reasons believed by some to show why God is not
needed to explain the universe are also reviewed.

The proof of existence of God is pursued on two levels,
which have been the traditional stomping grounds of those
examining this question: the phenomenal world and its
fundamental laws and properties, and the evolution of species
on earth. The approaches chosen are necessarily extra-scientific,
that is, beyond the domain of science, but not beyond the
domain of rational discourse. More specifically, it is shown that

230                                            Lights of Irfán vol. 15

“something cannot result from nothing,” or put metaphorically,
“there is no free lunch.” This pre-existence principle is applied
to the physical world itself and the properties embedded therein.

The pre-existence principle is also applied to the
phenomenon of evolution by examining information contents
at various organizational levels of living organisms. A second
approach applied to evolution is based on probabilities. A
simplified model of DNA permutation is presented and argued
that low level organizations cannot spontaneously assemble into
higher level organizations by a purely random process.

It is concluded that the ultimate source of pre-existence is
God, and that the pre-existent properties are attributes of God.
It is further suggested, as one possibility, that the DNA
molecule is endowed with pre-existent potentials and
configurations of life gradually triggered to be revealed over
the course of time under particular circumstances and stimuli,
which is outwardly observed as evolution.

Introduction

> We make mention of thee for the sake of God, and
> desire that thy name may be exalted through thy
> remembrance of God, the Creator of earth and of heaven.

He, verily, is witness unto that which I say. [ESW 60]

Far from being an esoteric question, the origins of creation,
and by some implications, the existence of God, is probably the
oldest question on the collective mind of humanity and
individuals, and the most important. Even though inquiry into
the origins of creation may not seem like a concern that affects
the daily life, but it does, in direct and indirect ways. Our world
view, the model we assume when we think what life is all about,
is clearly affected by our views of God, where He fits in that
world view, and how He is related to us and our lives.

This is a complex and multi-faceted subject matter. Many
classical arguments and counter-arguments exist for and against
the existence of God. These arguments are largely concerned
with finding an explanation for the origins and nature of the
universe we observe. More recently, however, and most notably
since the early twentieth century, the focus has become the
search of plausible scientific explanations for the origins and
nature of the universe, largely divorced from the concept of a
god. But such science-based endeavors have not been limited to
finding explanations for the origins of the universe, but also to
explain many of the phenomena within the universe, and most
notably, the evolution of species on earth.

It is important to briefly recount some of the most notable
arguments for and against the existence of God and His role in
creation. The survey of these arguments serves to lay to rest
basic classical questions and approaches that have already been
asked, discussed, answered, countered, and reasserted many
times and in many forms in the course of human history, and
open the way for new ways of looking at these questions and
consider new interpretations of aspects of some of these old
arguments.

To better understand both the old questions and their new
interpretations, basic concepts in logic, probability, and the
DNA molecule are reviewed as foundational principles needed
in this discourse. The gist of the arguments presented in this
paper is not anti-scientific, but extra-scientific, based on the
notion that science is a subset of rational discourse, and not the
other way around.

The scope of this paper is limited to exploring the origins of
existence and the meaning and requirements of proof of such
origins. This paper is not directed to the technical details of
cosmology or evolution, even though enough of the relevant
science is presented to allow a common and unambiguous
understanding of the assertions and arguments.

The proof of existence of God, or alternatively, the origins
of the universe or other major phenomena such as life, define
two areas for our exploration. These two areas of inquiry have
been the traditional stomping grounds of those examining these
questions and include the phenomenal world and its
fundamental laws and properties, and the evolution of species
on earth. Indeed, these two areas have been fertile grounds for
and subjects of many recent books about how the universe came
to be, how life began, and what drives the evolution of species
on earth. Some of these well-known books include A Brief
History of Time (1988) by Steven Hawking, The Selfish Gene
(1976) and The God Delusion (2006) by Clinton Richard
Dawkins, and The God Argument (2013) by A.C. Grayling.

Why Do We Care?

Generally, we are only curious about things which are
intriguing and interesting, but care about things that affect us
in real ways. The question of origins of creation is both
intriguing and affects us in real ways through world view,
cultural norms, artistic expressions, social interactions,
psychological disposition, political discourse, and the
establishment and operation of civil laws.

Our world view, although not an everyday concern, plays a
very important role in how we live our lives, whom we befriend,
our politics, our goals in life, and other long-term
considerations. Those who believe in God often also believe in
an afterlife and some sort of reward and punishment in that
afterlife. They also find certain meanings for life as part of a
grand cosmological plan. Conversely, those who do not believe
in God have less definitive views on life and related subjects. Of
course, none of these observations prove or disprove the
existence of God and no claims of superiority of one view over
another is intended. They merely show that it does matter
whether we believe in God or not.

Our world view in turn affects our belief system and the
cultural norms and artistic expressions we adopt or subscribe
to. For example, the art arising out of cultures with a
significant presence of religion, such as in 17th and 18th
century Europe, show this presence in their paintings,
sculptures, and music.

Our world view and belief system also affect the laws that
reflect the social and moral values of the society through the
political system. There are clear distinctions between laws
supported and promoted by political parties more closely
affiliated with a religion, than those supported by less religious
parties. Again, the point here is not to claim superiority one
way or another but to show differences.

And of course, the effects of belief or non-belief in God do
not end with culture, art, or law and carry onto almost all
aspects of our lives such as education, diet, family, and many
others.

Methodologies of Acquisition of Knowledge

How do we come to acquire new knowledge or discover a
truth about something and know that it is the truth? One way is
the rational proof, which is closely related to the scientific
method: we make some observations and hypothesize a theory.
If we can prove the theory, then we have arrived at the truth.
Although similar, but this process is not the same as the
scientific method.

The scientific method may be generally formulated as
follows:1

> 1. Make observations
> 2. Formulate a hypothesis to explain the observations
> 3. Test or prove the hypothesis using controlled experiments
234                                            Lights of Irfán vol. 15

The scientific method is an inductive process: we go from
specific observations to general conclusions. Inductive
reasoning is by nature, strictly speaking, inconclusive and
evolutionary. The conclusion is only as good as the current
collection of observations allows. The next observation may
alter the conclusion. For example, if one observes a sequence of
numbers such as 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, ..., and is then asked to
predict what the next number in the sequence would be, he may
present the hypothesis that this pattern is defined by the
sequence of even numbers, and thus the next number should be
14\. However, if the next number revealed in the observed
sequence happens to be 25, then the assumed hypothesis turns
out to be wrong and a different hypotheses will be needed. This
inductive phenomenon is well known in the history of science
and is behind all scientific progress: as new data are discovered,
scientific explanations evolve to explain the old and the new
data.

The inductive process is markedly different from the
deductive process. In contrast to the inductive process, the
deductive process, which is a main component of rational
reasoning, is conclusive and fixed. Once a truth is deductively
proven, it will never change, in contrast to scientific discoveries
and theories. That’s why ancient mathematical theories in
geometry and algebra, or other areas of mathematics, once
proven, have never been “improved.” The area of a circle, A,
represented as πr2, where r is the radius of the circle and π is a
constant (3.14...), was discovered and proven deductively, not
scientifically. They did not cut out an assortment of circular
discs and measure their areas in a laboratory to come up with
this formula. Samples or observed circles, although examined
for insight, did not play a pivotal or necessary role in proving
this formula; deductive reasoning did. As a matter of fact, this
formula for the area of a circle may be derived by dividing a
circle into an infinite number of slices, like a pizza. But since
no physical object, such as sample discs, can be divided

infinitely, the proof is abstract and purely rational, not
scientific, strictly speaking.

A closely related question is what does it mean to prove
something? How do we know we have proven what we set out
to prove? Having a “proof” generally means a valid conclusion
is reached about a statement. Mathematically, the proof of a
theorem means that the theorem, as defined, is true and that it
contains no errors. For example, a theorem in geometry may
state that the sum of internal angles of a triangle is 180º. Given
the definitions of a triangle, angle, and sum, it can be
mathematically proven that this theorem is true. Proof is based
on the deductive process. In contrast, a scientific theory is only
inductively verified, not proved, as discussed above.

The existence of a proof requires two main elements: facts
and principles. The process of deduction, also known as
reasoning, is the application of known principles or rules, which
are themselves previously proven theorems, to facts to prove a
new theorem. Thus, for a proof of the existence of God, facts
related to the origins of existence are needed that require an
explanation and principles are needed to show the new theorem
is consistent with other known principles. In his many
discourses about God, Abdul-Bahá did not shy away from
propounding rational proofs of the existence of God based on
facts and principles, some of which are briefly recounted here.

A few words are in order about what does not constitute
proof. Stories, personal experiences, conjectures, and other
similar evidence about various theorems, including the existence
of God, even if true, do not rise to the level of proof. This
assertion is not meant to belittle such evidence or aver their
invalidity, but rather to distinguish them from a logical proof.

Who is the Expert?

With the ubiquitous success of science and scientific
theories, especially over the last couple of centuries or so, many

236                                           Lights of Irfán vol. 15

people have adopted the idea that “scientific” is synonymous
with “valid,” and even further, that science is the only path to
the truth. That is, a theory is only valid if it is scientific and
anything that is not scientific is invalid. However, based on our
brief discussion of the scientific method above, science is
chiefly generated using inductive reasoning. A whole class of
rational activity based on deductive reasoning fundamentally
lies outside the domain of science. Simply put, science is a
subset of the rational faculty, not vice versa. Hence, everything
valid is not necessarily scientific and anything that is not
scientific is not necessarily invalid. Of course, scientific
discovery is a complex business involving all manners of
rational activity at different stages, including deductive
reasoning. Nevertheless, the main rational ingredient of
scientific endeavor is inductive reasoning.

The quest for origins of creation, and the question of
existence of God, is multi-faceted and necessarily involves a
good deal of every rational discipline and technique, including
science, philosophy, mathematics, inductive and deductive
reasoning, abductive reasoning, common sense, and other
rational approaches. Non-rational approaches, such as
inspiration, dream, revelation, prayer, and other similar
approaches may result in even stronger personal beliefs in the
existence of God, but they are based on personal experience and
are only valid for the person experiencing such feelings. They
are not transferrable to others like rational techniques are.
Hence, we are not concerned with personal experiences here,
only rational techniques.

Thus the “expert” in this endeavor is one who is familiar
with and reasonably versed in rational discourse, sciences, and
philosophy and can best combine the rational techniques and
scientific knowledge in creative ways to explain the facts and
data related to the origins of creation based on logic.

The Primacy of Logic

Logic is the glue that binds together other knowledge to
come up with valid conclusions and is the one indispensable
tool of rational discourse. As such, logic has precedence over
science, laws of physics, biology, the brain, and any other area
of human endeavor. Let’s see why.

Logic is, at its very core, a specification of the existential
requirements of any conclusion or result. Mathematically, three
necessary and sufficient logical operators exist to specify any
logical statement: AND, OR, and NOT. There is a
mathematically equivalent single operator, NAND, that may
serve the same purpose, but the original set of three operators is
more intuitive. The AND operator specifies all the requirements
(among those elements being considered) for a true conclusion,
the OR operator specifies one or more of the requirements (all
are not necessary) for a true conclusion, and NOT specifies an
element that must not be true for a conclusion to be true.
Simple examples can illustrate the concept: water AND soil are
needed for a flower to grow; you can go to the store by bicycle
OR on foot; NOT being locked allows a door to be opened. In
each of the foregoing examples, the operator is shown in
underlined bold font, the requirements are shown in italics, and
the conclusion or effect resulting from the requirements is
shown in normal text. Thus, as we initially observed, the logical
operators specify the requirements of existence of the result (or
a true conclusion, in the context of information processing).

Logic is also like an information pipe, to use a metaphor. It
is content-invariant and knowledge-agnostic. Logic is not
concerned with what specific subject we are reasoning about. It
also is not concerned about the correctness of the knowledge we
use in our reasoning. For example, if we state that “an elephant
fits in a tea cup; a tea cup fits in my pocket, therefore, an
elephant fits in my pocket,” we are using perfectly valid logic
and correct reasoning, but with faulty knowledge. This is known

238                                           Lights of Irfán vol. 15

as valid but unsound logic (or reasoning) due to the incorrect
data or knowledge.

However, logic is not quite as simple as one may be lead to
believe from the foregoing examples. What we briefly discussed
above is propositional logic, dealing with logical constants.
Higher order predicate logic, such as the first order predicate
logic, the second order predicate logic, etc., deal with logical
functions and quantifiers and are well-known subjects in the
field of mathematical logic. The difference between
propositional logic and predicate logic, apart from technical
mathematical criteria such as whether or not they are
“consistent” and “complete” systems, is that propositional logic
is concerned with logical constants whose truth values are fixed,
while predicate logic deals with logical variables and functions.
This is loosely analogous to arithmetic and algebra, where
arithmetic is used to operate on constant numbers and algebra is
used to deal with variable numbers and functions of numbers.

Just as the complexity of advanced mathematics does not
change the fact that it is basically a study of quantities and how
they are related to each other, the complexity level of logic does
not change the fact that it is about existential conditions of
rational conclusions.

How does all this show the primacy of logic over science and
the laws of physics? It is a question of dependence: for any
entities A and B, if B depends on A, then A must exist first and
B can only exist afterwards. Existence of an entity precedes
every property of the entity, because no other property of the
entity can exist before the entity itself exists. Since logic
defines the existential conditions of any entity, it comes first.
That includes all physical phenomena and laws of nature. We
may have gotten a bit too abstract here, so let’s come back to
earth, to a more concrete and practical level. As far as we know
at this point of human advancement, the laws of nature, such as
the laws of thermodynamics, gravity, quantum physics, and
other such fundamental laws clearly underlie the physical reality

we perceive. Our understanding of these laws changes over
time, yet the logical rules we use in our reasoning to rationally
understand and analyze these very laws of nature remain
unchanged. Conversely, no matter how our scientific
understanding of the laws of physics or nature change, our
logical methods do not. Thus, as far as our cognition is
concerned, our understanding of natural phenomena through
science is dependent upon logic, but the rules of logic are not
dependent on our understanding of the laws of nature. Hence,
the priority and primacy of logic.

A Survey of Classical Arguments for the Existence of God

A few of the classical proofs of the existence of God are
briefly examined below. Some of the modern reasons believed
by some to show why God is not needed to explain the universe
are also reviewed. This survey helps us avoid redundant
discussions and also focuses our attention on new approaches
which overcomes the objections to the classical arguments. This
survey is by no means comprehensive or an exhaustive
treatment of the classical arguments. It only describes the best
known arguments to avoid covering the grounds already
covered many times by others.

The classical arguments may be classified into several
categories as follows. Even though one argument is presented
under each category, there are many variations of these
arguments in each category, which are not treated in any detail
here.

Cosmological Arguments

Presumably Aristotle and Plato, the famed Greek
philosophers, were the first ones to propose the cosmological,
or First Cause, arguments to explain the origins of creation and,
by implication, prove the existence of God. Over the ages and
even to the present, there have been many variations of this
proof with various levels of details. For example, Abdul-Bahá

240                                             Lights of Irfán vol. 15

uses a similar argument to show the existence of God [SAQ 202-

204]. In one of his books , William Hatcher, the Canadian
mathematician, goes through a rigorous mathematical treatment
of this subject using logic and set theory.

The basic outline of this theory is based on the concept of
causality, which defines a temporal cause-and-effect chain. Each
link in this chain is both an effect of the previous cause and a
cause to the next effect. For example, a cloud is an effect
caused by the sun, and it is also the cause of rain. Rain is the
effect of a cloud and the cause of plant growth, and so on.
Tracing the causality chain backwards through time must get us
to a “First Cause” which is not itself the effect of anything else.
The First Cause is necessary because otherwise we would be
dealing with an infinite temporal chain, which seems like a futile
effort for explaining the creation.

Backward tracking from effects to First Cause

> FIRST         Effect-1/       Effect-2/       Effect-3/
> CAUSE         Cause-2         Cause-3         Cause-4

Figure 1: The chain of Cause-and-Effect, and the First Cause

The most compelling objection to this proof is that why this
“First Cause” needs to be a god? Why can’t the laws of nature,
or the big bang be this First Cause? There are responses to this
objection, but none seem to be very convincing because they
only explain some aspects of this proof while other aspects
remain unexplained. For example, Hatcher shows that the chain
of causality, though it can start out as multiple branches or an
infinite number of parallel chains, must end in a single First
Cause. That is, each chain cannot have its own First Cause. This
point shows that there exists a single First Cause or a single
God. However, this does not explain why the First Cause has to

be a willful, intelligent, and conscious being as the notion of a
god normally implies.

Teleological Arguments

Teleological arguments for the existence of God are based on
the idea of purposeful design. This argument, which is most
commonly but not exclusively applied to explain the evolution
of species on earth, avers that complex systems, such as living
organisms, cannot come into being without an intelligent
designer who has purposefully designed them.

Abdul-Bahá uses a similar argument. He expounds that a
combination (for example, a system) is made possible only by
three different means: inherence, accident, and design [PUP 423].
A combination exists by inherence if its components are
inherently associated with each other, such as flame and heat.
Since combinations of animal organs and parts are not inherent,
this method cannot be responsible for a new species. A
combination exists by accident if its components are associated
accidentally, such as wind blowing a leaf into a room. But
animal species are too complex to be explained by blind luck.
So, only the design option remains to explain complex live
organisms and species.

However, the modern evolution theory purports to explain
how blind luck can actually create organisms of arbitrary
complexity from lower forms. As further described below in
more detail, the modern evolution theory describes the
appearance of a new species as a result of the operation of two
major processes: random mutation and natural selection.
During the random mutation phase variations appear in existing
species, and during the natural selection phase the organisms or
animals fittest for a particular environment survive and other
variations vanish over time, hence the common phrase “survival
of the fittest.”

242                                          Lights of Irfán vol. 15

Thus, the counter argument for creation by design is that the
appearance of new and complex species, including homo sapiens
or the modern human, is explained by the theory of evolution
without resorting to a god or purposeful design.

Anthropic Arguments

Anthropic refers to human-centric elements. Based on
observations of laws of nature, some have come to believe that
the whole of universe has been designed to make the existence
of humans possible. A brief summary of some of these
observations follows.

It has been calculated that the density of matter in the
universe must be almost exactly at a critical density needed to
preclude the “Big Crunch,” the complement of the Big Bang,
later described. Recent measurements suggest that the observed
density of matter augmented with theoretical predictions of the
amount of dark matter account for only about 30% of this
critical density. The balance is contributed by a cosmological
constant, the energy density of the vacuum of space. The Nobel
Laureate in Physics Steven Weinberg provided an anthropic
explanation for this phenomenon. He remarked that the
cosmological constant has a very low value, amounting to 120
orders of magnitude smaller than the value predicted by particle
physics, dubbed the “worst prediction in physics.” The point is
that if the cosmological constant were only one order of
magnitude larger than its observed value, the universe would
suffer a catastrophic inflation (described below), which would
preclude the formation of stars, and in turn life itself.

Similarly, the observed values of the dimensionless physical
constants, such as the coupling constant which characterizes the
strength of the electromagnetic interaction, governing the four
fundamental forces of nature (macroscopic gravity and
electromagnetic forces, and subatomic strong and weak forces)
are balanced as if fine-tuned to permit the formation of
commonly found matter and subsequently the emergence of life.

For example, even a slight increase in the strong nuclear force
would bind the dineutron and the diproton particles such that
nuclear fusion would have converted all hydrogen in the early
universe to helium. Under such conditions, water and stable
stars, both essential for the emergence of life, would not exist.
More generally, small changes in the relative strengths of the
four fundamental forces and their interactions can greatly
affect the universe’s age, structure, and capacity for life.

The anthropic principle is not a complete proof of the
existence of a designer for the universe in a mathematical sense.
Rather, it is a highly precise observation that provides some
strong evidences and points to the likely existence of such
designer. The current argument against the anthropic principle
is the concept of a multi-verse, or multiple universes, which
spontaneously pop into existence out of utter nothingness, each
with its own random set of laws and parameters. The one we are
currently in just happens to have the exact makeup required to
support life and, voilả, here we are discussing it; very
convenient arrangement indeed.

Ontological Arguments

Probably the most common types of classical “proofs” for
the existence of God, and the least compelling in view of our
modern knowledge, are based on ontological arguments. Many
such arguments border on sophistry and paradoxical excursions.
A few examples that follow should make it clear that most
ontological arguments are inadequate, and indeed, misleading
paths to the truth.

Ontology is the study of being or existence. Many of the
arguments have little basis in proven or scientific facts and
instead depend on presumptions about the nature of being, the
structure of universe, and how nature works. These
presumptions are used to prove that God must exist.

244                                              Lights of Irfán vol. 15

By most accounts, the earliest ontological argument is
attributed to Anselm of Canterbury in the 11th century A.D.
Anselm based his argument on his definition of God as the
greatest thing that can be imagined or conceived. He then
argued that this being could exist in the mind. He suggested
that, if the greatest possible being exists in the mind, it must
also exist in reality. If it only exists in the mind, a greater being
is possible—one which exists in the mind and in reality. This
argument is based on many presumptions which at best are not
very plausible, such as imagining the greatest thing, and also has
logical flaws such as if something exists in one’s mind it must
also exist in reality based on the presumed meaning of the
“greatest possible being”.

Other ontological arguments have been proposed throughout
the ages by some renowned thinkers and philosophers such as
the 17th century French philosopher René Descartes and the
20th century Austrian mathematician Kurt Gödel. Gödel
proposed a more elaborate and mathematically rigorous version
of Anselm’s arguments, but in essence it is still closer to
presumptuous sophistry than proof.

Thermodynamics Arguments

Thermodynamics is a very basic science, which studies the
relationships between various forms of energy in a system. It
includes a number of basic laws. Thermodynamics has four
fundamental laws, zero through three. The zeroth law is related
to thermal equilibrium of systems; the first law is related to
thermal energy; the second law, and the one that concerns us
here, is related to system entropy; and the third law is also
related to entropy.

More precisely, the second law states: the entropy of a closed
system not in thermal equilibrium increases. Closed systems
spontaneously move towards thermal equilibrium, which is also
the state of maximum entropy of the closed system. This law has
profound physical and also philosophical implications. These

implications originate from and revolve around the concept of
entropy.

Entropy is a measure of the number of ways a system and its
components may be arranged, the components being any and all
parts of the system including atomic, sub-atomic, and quantum
particles. Indeed, at the most fundamental quantum levels, the
laws of thermodynamics, like most quantum concepts, are
expressed in terms of the probabilities of particles behaving in a
particular way. Another interpretation, or implication, of
entropy is that it is a measure of disorder in the system. This
behavior of entropy implies that in a closed system disorder
increases. In other words, a closed system cannot spontaneously
become more organized, unless an energy source external to the
system interferes (which then violates the “closed” system
condition).

As we’ll see later, the concept of spontaneous organization
plays an important role in the discourse on the existence of
God. Some have argued that the second law precludes the
spontaneous evolution of species from lower forms to higher
ones, and their arguments are not entirely without merit.
However, the second law in and of itself is insufficient for this
purpose as many have pointed out. For one thing, the second
law is about energy, not everything else, at least not directly.
Extending the second law to cover the evolution of species and
formation of the universe itself at which time no laws of nature
existed, including the laws of thermodynamics, is not without
substantial difficulties.

Limits-based Arguments

One of the apparently simplest, and at the same time deepest
proofs of God, or at least one of His most essential attributes,
the attribute of being unlimited, is propounded by Abdul-Bahá:

> Now as to the infinite Power that knoweth no
> limitations; limitation itself proveth the existence of the
246                                            Lights of Irfán vol. 15

> unlimited, for the limited is known through the
> unlimited, just as weakness itself proveth the existence
> of power, ignorance the existence of knowledge, poverty
> the existence of wealth. Without wealth there would be
> no poverty, without knowledge no ignorance, without
> light no darkness. Darkness itself is a proof of the
> existence of light for darkness is the absence of light.

[TAF 20; emphasis added.]

Unfortunately, the explanation left to posterity by Abdul-
Bahá is rather brief. He explained that the very concept or
essence of “limit” implies the limitless. Perhaps, this approach
can be understood as a hierarchy of containments. Every limit
defines a boundary or a container that contains its contents,
and the container itself is contained in a yet bigger container. If
this abstract containment relationship is extended to infinity, at
the end which has no end, one may find traces of God.

However, this approach is different from the approach of
this paper and it is only covered here for completeness.

Current Scientific Belief: The Big Bang and Inflation Theories

The science of physics has undergone not only constant
evolutionary changes throughout the ages, but also several
major revolutionary changes, most notably since the early
Twentieth century. Physics has come a long way since its humble
beginnings in ancient times as a collection of basic un-
instrumented observations and corresponding explanations and
theories. Galileo was one of the early scientists to start the
scientific method by using actual observations and
measurements instead of philosophical presumptions to explain
natural phenomena such as the free falling of objects. Sir Isaac
Newton followed in the footsteps of Galileo in the Seventeenth
century and formalized physics with his laws of motion and
gravitation force between large bodies. More recently, Albert
Einstein, the famed physicist of German origin, revolutionized
our understanding of the laws of nature by his special and then

general theories of relativity. Quantum physics added its
interpretations of physical laws at microscopic levels, which
introduced some tensions with the theories of Einstein. Most
recently, a family of theories most commonly recognized under
the label of Superstring Theory, or M-Theory (a set of several
variations of the superstring theory) proposed new
interpretations of the structure of universe to reconcile the
apparent inconsistencies between the relativity theories and the
quantum theory.3

However, all of the above theories are descriptive in nature
and neither provide an explanation for the origins of the
universe, nor do they claim to do so. A theory that does purport
to explain how the universe started is the theory of big bang,
further described below.

The big bang theory is the heart of the standard
cosmological model and is grounded in Einstein’s general theory
of relativity and the idea of expansion of universe, first
proposed in 1927 by the Belgian physics professor Georges
Lemaître, and later supported by the observations of Edwin
Hubble, the American astronomer, in 1929. In 1964, the
detection of cosmic microwave background radiation further
added to the pile of evidence supporting the occurrence of such
an event in the early life of the universe. The cosmic microwave
background radiation is significant because it is consistent
across vast stretches of the observable universe, and thus
suggests a common origin in an ever expanding universe.
Tracking the accelerating rate of expansion of the universe
backwards in time, arrives at an age of about 13.8 billion years,
the birthday of the universe.4

The inflation theory provides an explanation for what is
known as the horizon problem associated with the cosmic
microwave background radiation. Simply stated, the horizon
problem observes that highly distant regions of the universe
have the same temperature and other physical properties despite
not being in physical communication. Such physical

248                                             Lights of Irfán vol. 15

communications are precluded across the distances encountered,
which are far greater than even light could travel during the age
of the universe, because the transfer of information (including
energy, heat, and other effects and influences) cannot take place
faster than the speed of light. The size of the universe is
estimated at about 92 billion light years in diameter, while its
age is only 13.8 billion years. So, how is it possible that
locations in the universe farther apart than even light could
travel in the entire age of the universe have such precisely
similar characteristics without being able to influence each
other? Hence, the horizon problem. The inflation theory
proposes a solution: a hyper expansion of the universe in the
first moments after the big bang and then a slower expansion
rate afterwards to this date; thus explaining how vastly
separated points in space can have very similar background
radiation characteristics.5

According to the standard model of cosmology, with the big
bang and the inflation theories at its heart, at the initial moment
of creation, all of time, space, and matter were rolled up into an
unimaginably concentrated and dense point, a state called
singularity. The big bang released all that in a spark, starting an
ever expanding distribution of time, space, and matter to form
the universe. An important concept to note is that according to
the standard model, time and space are not static dimensions for
the matter to grow into, like an empty room into which
furniture is moved. Rather, the very fabric of universe is
composed of time and space, which is stretching out and
expanding, like a balloon, at an accelerating rate. Hence, the
universe is not static but constantly changing, and eventually, in
a distant future billions of years away, it will end in a dark, cold
death. At least that’s what the currently accepted standard
model of cosmology predicts.

The big bang theory, which explains a great deal of observed
phenomena in existence today, is consistently and supported by
precise experimentations. However, it fails to explain where the
“unimaginably concentrated and dense point made up of time,

space, and matter” came from prior to the big bang. It merely
pushes the question of the origin of creation back to a supposed
“starting point.” A recent response to the question of “what was
there before the big bang?” is that there was no “before”
because there was no dimension of time and thus the question is
meaningless! Similarly, a response to the question of “what
caused the big bang?” is that the laws of universe including
cause-and-effect did not exist and therefore, the question is,
again, meaningless!

And of course, things do not end with the big bang, but
quite literally start with it, including the evolution of complex
life on earth billions of years later. The same basic questions
that apply to the origin of creation as a whole apply to the
origin of species as a more specific case. The evolution of
species is addressed later on.

However, the clever responses to these questions mentioned
above may be more of a sophisticated scientific dodge than real
answers. These answers merely push the question of origin one
step back, to a supposed “beginning,” without explaining where
this beginning and all the potential phenomena, properties, and
characteristics such as matter, energy, laws of physics, etc. that
flowed from it came from. Below, an alternative explanation is
proposed for the origins of creation.

A New Theory: The Pre-Existence Argument

In the Tablet of Wisdom (Lawh-i Hikmat), Baha’u’llah
explains:

> Every thing must needs have an origin and every building
> a builder. Verily, the Word of God is the Cause which
> hath preceded the contingent world. [TB 141]

In the same Tablet He further expounds:

250                                            Lights of Irfán vol. 15

We explore the explanations Baha’u’llah left to posterity
about the nature and origin of creation in a modern context and
from different perspectives.

“Something cannot come from nothing” is the essence of the
pre-existence argument. Before going further, we first need to
understand some foundational principles and then come back
and continue with this line of analysis.

The Notion of Continuity Across a Boundary

We live in a world of limits. Everything is defined or
specified based on limits or boundaries. Without boundaries,
nothing can be distinguished from another. For example, we can
distinguish sea from land because each is limited by its
boundary: at some point sea water ends and dry land begins. If
the sea water never ended, dry land would never start and thus
could not be defined. Boundaries have certain basic properties
regardless of their specific nature or functions in a system or
organism. One such basic property is the notion of continuity
across boundaries.

But to be consistent and faithful to the claimed properties of
boundaries, which sets them apart from other concepts, let’s
first define what a boundary itself is: a boundary is an interface
that separates two sets of different entities A and B, as shown
in Figure 2, below. These “entities” may be any objects,
materials, properties, conditions, relationships, etc.; anything at
all, which may be members of a set. It is noteworthy that some
of these entities may be abstract, such as causation in which no
material may cross the boundary, but only influence or

252                                           Lights of Irfán vol. 15

information in various forms. The interface is specified by the
very difference between sets A and B. For example, a bicycle
and a motorcycle are different sets of objects, and the interface
that separates them is defined by the differences, such as the
motor in the motorcycle.

The notion of continuity may be loosely characterized as
something having to pass across the boundary to establish a
relationship between or connect the two sides. This relationship
has several distinct aspects embodied in several major concepts
of change or transformation of one set into another across the
boundary. These concepts include conservation laws, causality,
and flow of contents and are pivotal to the pre-existence
argument.

A                                      B

Figure 2: Notion of continuity across a boundary

The Existential Conservation Principle

One form of cross-boundary continuity is embodied in the
laws of conservation. These laws generally state that a particular
quantity of interest is neither created nor destroyed, but rather
it is transformed from one form into another. There are many
laws of conservation depending on a quantity of interest. For
example, some of the basic laws of nature are laws of
conservation such as the law of conservation of energy and the
law of conservation of matter. These laws state, respectively,
that energy or matter is not created or destroyed, but are merely
transformed from one form into another.

In every law of conservation the quantity of interest crosses
an abstract boundary defined by the differences between its
initial state and its final state in the course of a transformation.
For example, according to the law conservation of matter, if a
log is burned, it changes from solid wood into charcoal and
smoke. It is transformed; it is not destroyed. During the
transformation, the material that makes up the wood crosses the
abstract boundary that separates and distinguishes between solid
wood and charcoal (and also the smoke), the abstract boundary
being defined by these differences.

We now introduce a new and very general law of
conservation: the law of conservation of existence, or
existential conservation principle. This law states that the very
existence of an entity cannot come from non-existence or
absolute nothingness; it must be transformed from another
state, a state of pre-existence. Or put more casually, “there is no
free lunch.” To see why this law is true, that is, to prove this
principle, we’ll need the differential principle introduced below.

The Differential Principle

Another form of cross-boundary continuity is embodied in
causality, which has been called one of the most, or even the
most, fundamental law of nature. It is a necessary prerequisite
to all scientific and rational inquiry, without which “laws”
would not be meaningful. This is because, generally, a law is a
statement of a specific type of causation. For example,
Newton’s third law of motion states that “for every action there
is an equal and opposite reaction.” Here, “action” is the cause
and “reaction” is the effect. The principle of causality is
verified by the special theory of relativity in which the space-
time continuum and the constant speed of light provide a
consistent frame-work that shows that cause must always
precede effect. Cause and effect are different sets of entities, as
discussed with respect to Figure 2. Hence, for the cause to
create the effect, the influence it exerts, in whatever form, must

254                                           Lights of Irfán vol. 15

needs cross the boundary between the two, establishing a
continuity across the boundary.

The differential principle is related to causality. It may be
considered a particular type of abstract causality without the
physical connotations that we associate with the latter, such as
time. The differential principle states that a set A may be
transformed to a set B or a set C if and only if there is a
differentiating element that directs A to change to B or to C.
For example, a set of wooden parts may be transformed into
either a chair or a coffee table but the construction procedure
differentiate whether they are transformed into one or the
other. Even in a random process something must differentiate
one result from another.

A little set theory can help us in better understanding and
proving the differential principle. Anything, any entity, can be
represented as a set of attributes. The attributes are called the
members of the set and may also be anything, any objects, any
relationship, or another set. Members can also be tangible or
abstract entities. Two sets are equal if and only if their members
are exactly the same. Every set has three main elements: set
members, operations defined on the set, and procedures for
applying the operations to the set members. The procedures
define the order of application of operations to the members
and may be intentional and intelligent or random.

A few examples of sets should make these abstract concepts
more tangible. A bicycle can be represented as the set of the
parts and interrelationships that make up the bicycle. The set of
even integers includes all integers divisible by 2. Addition is an
operation defined on the set of even integers. The procedure of
adding 1 to every member of the set of even integers creates the
set of all odd integers.

To change one set to another, or to generate a new set from
an existing one, the three differentiating elements
(differentiators) of sets are needed: members, operations, and
procedures (information). The resulting set cannot be generated

if one of these elements is missing. Additionally, two different
sets generated must be different in at least one of these
differentiators, otherwise the two sets will be one and the same.
Hence, a single set cannot be transformed into two different
sets if there is nothing to differentiate one outcome from
another. Hence, the differential principle.

Now, let’s get back to the existential conservation principle.

The differential principle may be used to show that the
existential conservation principle is true. A new set cannot be
generated from nothing, because the three differentiators are
required to generate it. Let’s look at this in a bit more detail.

The empty set contains no members, there are no operations
defined on it, and no procedure exist to do anything with the
non-existent operations and members. An interesting fact about
the empty set is that there can be only one empty set because
the members of two empty sets are exactly the same: nothing!
And when two sets have the same members, they are the same
set. A new set, which contains some members, cannot result
from an empty set. For the empty set to turn into or to generate
the new set, the three elements of the set (members, operations,
procedures) must exist, but by definition they do not exist in
the empty set. Therefore, the new set cannot be generated,
unless a non-empty set precedes it on the other side of the
boundary. Hence, the existential conservation principle.

The High-to-Low Flow Principle

Bahá’u’lláh writes that nature reflects the “names and
attributes of God”. It is the expression of “God’s Will ... in ...
the contingent world”.

> Say: Nature in its essence is the embodiment of My
> Name, the Maker, Creator. Its manifestations are
> diversified by varying causes, and in this diversity there
> are signs for men of discernment. Nature is God’s Will
> and is its expression in and through the contingent
256                                            Lights of Irfán vol. 15

> world. It is a dispensation of Providence ordained by the
> Ordainer, the All-Wise. [TAB 142]

In the above passage, Baha’u’llah teaches that the properties
seen in nature are deposited by God. Below, we will examine
particular aspects of this utterance from particular points of
view.

The high to low flow is another principle that revolves
around the notion of continuity across a boundary and is an
important principle with many tangible instances in science and
everyday life for the astute observer. It is also related to the
existential conservation principle.

Based on the differential principle, the flow of content
across a boundary requires something to drive the flow of
content from one side to another. The other side of the
boundary is generated by application of operations to members
of the existing set.

Based on the existential principle, something must exist on
one side of the boundary before the other side can be created. If
we apply the existential principle to a part of the set, we can
come up with an interesting conclusion. The essence of the
existential conservation principle is that from an existing set,
and only from an existing set, a new set may be generated. This
means that the existing set has something more than the non-
existent one, namely, all the set members, operations, and
procedures. With reference to Figure 3 (below), the existing set
A has something more than the new set B. Subset B’ is a portion
of set B. The difference between subset B’ and set A is less than
all, but there is a partial difference that is needed to generate
subset B’. The dotted lines signifies a partial generation of the
new set B from existing set A. There is a deceptively simple
reason for this, as pronounced by Abdul-Bahá in the context of
natural laws:

> But when you look at Nature itself, you see that it has no
> intelligence, no will. For instance, the nature of fire is to
> burn; it burns without will or intelligence. ... Man is able
> to resist and to oppose nature; ... all the inventions he
> has made are due to his discovery of the constitution of
> things. ... Now, when you behold in existence such
> organization, arrangements and laws, can you say that all
> these are the effect of Nature, though Nature has neither
> intelligence nor perception? [SAQ 3]

Abdul-Bahá is indicating, in the context of nature in general,
that what nature does not possess itself (i.e., will and
intelligence), it cannot give to man, who does possess both. He
further alludes to the fact that the organization and laws
evident in nature must have come from another source, namely,
from God. To appreciate the significance of Abdu’l-Baha’s
statements above, it is helpful to put it in the context of
boundaries, in which everything that flows into the new set
must come from an existing one.

We can see how the pre-existence conservation principle is
applicable not only to the whole sets A and B, but also to the
partial subset B’ by examining the process of generation of set
B. Starting from a non-existent set B, a portion of set B is
constructed by flow of contents, physical or abstract,
emanating from set A, we proceed portion by portion to build
the set B. During this construction process, set A must always
have more content than subset B’ to supply the additional
subset B’ with its new contents. Additionally, the contents of A
may be embedded in its members, its operations, or its
procedure. Hence, for each partial step of construction of set
B, that is, for each additional subset B’, set A must have
something extra. In other words, “how can you give something
you don’t have?” The giver must always have more than the
receiver. We will call this the partial existential conservation
principle.

258                                             Lights of Irfán vol. 15

This phenomenon is clearly visible in physical sets, and also in
abstract sets. For example, in a physical set such as a building,
the material used in the building must come from a source
which has more material than the building itself. As an abstract
example, we can look at a set A containing the integer 2 as a
member. If we define an operation “multiply by N,” where N is
any integer, we can generate a set B of all even integers. It seems
like set B including all even integers is generated by set A, yet it
is far greater than set A containing only the integer 2. However,
set A actually includes all integers, not just 2. The rest of the
integers, odd and even, are embedded in “N” within the
definition of the operation “multiply by N.” Thus, set A still has
more than set B. Hence the high-to-low flow principle.

Now, we are ready for a more accurate and practical
statement of the high to low flow principle based on the partial
existential conservation principle: in a closed system, which
implies no external interference and thus spontaneity, content
always flows from a high content level to a low content level
across a boundary. This is a very significant principle with
profound implications, as we shall see later.

Figure 3: Partial existential conservation principle

The high to low flow principle can be seen in several well-
known scientific fields as well. We will briefly consider two of
these fields, the field of thermodynamics and the field of
information theory.

With reference to Figure 4 (below), energy always flows from
high density to low density. This is demonstrated most
prominently by the second law of thermodynamics, which
provides that in a closed system heat (thermal energy) flows
spontaneously from a high-temperature body to a low-
temperature one. To make the heat flow in reverse, that is, from
a low to a high temperature, an external source of energy is
needed. Figure 4(a) shows the external source of energy EX
reversing the flow of energy from a low level, EL, to a high
level, EH. A practical example of this is the common refrigerator
which moves heat from a cold space inside the refrigerator (low
temperature) and expels it outside the refrigerator (high
temperature), with the aid of a refrigeration pump (external
energy source). This is similarly true about potential energy,
which is the energy in a gravitation field, such as mass raised
above ground (high energy state). It can spontaneously fall (to
low energy state) but cannot spontaneously rise up, unless an
external energy source (like your hand) lifts it up.

Figure 4b (below) illustrates the flow of information across a
boundary from a low state to a high state. Information can be
spontaneously lost, but it cannot be spontaneously increased
without external effort. A low information state, IL, can only be
transformed to a high information state, IH, if an external
source of information, IX, is applied. As an example of
information flow, again consider a house. It includes
information embedded in its structure. It contains information
about its own geometry, its construction, its material, etc. If
the house is ruined over time, the information contained in it
will be lost. It goes from high information state to a low
information state spontaneously. However, construction
materials left alone do not spontaneously assemble into a
building, unless an external source of information, such as the
architect or the builder, supplies the information needed to
assemble the material into a building. This is true even if a
random source of energy, such as the wind, is available. The
available energy does not cure the lack of information.

Figure 4: Examples of High-to-Low Flow: (a) Energy, (b)

Information

There are no counter-examples of the high-to-low flow principle
unless an external factor or system is forcing the backward
flow. Such external system when combined with the low content
level system must create a higher content level than the high-
content level system, still upholding the principle of high-to-low
flow, as signified by the dotted enclosure in Figure 4.

Application of Pre-Existence to Creation of Universe

We have laid the foundations of the pre-existence argument
in the form of several principles including the existential
conservation principle, the differential principle, and the high
to low flow principle. We now apply these principles to the
creation of existence.

The story of the big bang is that out of non-existence, that
is, utter nothingness, came the world of existence. Nothingness
is, by definition, the empty set. Then, let’s imagine the state of
nothingness. The empty set can maintain this state and stay the
empty set, or it can change into the set of all things. Why would
the empty set cease to be the empty set and become the set of
all things? According to the existential conservation and the

differential principles discussed above, in this scenario, the
empty set has two choices: remain the empty set or become the
set of all things. But something must differentiate between
these two outcomes. And randomness does not change anything
because still something must exist to be random. That
“something,” the differentiator, must exist in the state of
nothingness. Hence, nothingness must contain something! It
must contain the differentiator, which is the same as at least one
of the three set elements discussed above. We have shown a
contradiction with our initial assumption of nothingness, which
means before we got something (e.g., the universe), there was
something else.

As demonstrated above, mathematically-based proofs often
depend on showing a contradiction with an initial assumption,
proving that the opposite of the assumption must be true. We
started with the assumption that before the creation nothing
existed. We only had the empty set. But we showed a
contradiction with this initial assumption, proving the opposite
of nothingness, and specifically proving that even though the
physical universe may have been in a different form prior to big
bang, some form of pre-existence preceded it. Not necessarily in
a chronological sense, but in some ordered sequence realm. A
realm in which there is a “first” and a “next,” a “before” and an
“after,” with respect to that ordered sequence; a sort of an
abstract time concept.

The current physical existence resulted from a
transformation of a pre-existence across a boundary separating
the two; the pre-existence being a realm that may be totally
different and alien to our perception and the way we think
about our physical existence. Hence, the pre-existence argument
proves two points: one, there was “something” “before” the big
bang, something that was transformed by the big bang into its
current physical form. But that “something” was not necessarily
in forms we are familiar with and the “before” is not necessarily
in a chronological sense. And two, we are back to square one in
terms of explaining where the whole of creation came from,

262                                              Lights of Irfán vol. 15

since the big bang only pushed the question back, as initially
suggested above. The big bang is not an explanation for the
origins of creation, but a description of the process, or at least
parts of it.

Application of Pre-Existence to Evolution of Species

We addressed one of the two fertile grounds for the
discussion of creation and God, namely, the creation of the
universe and how the big bang cannot be an explanation, but a
description. The second favorite arena for this discussion is
evolution of species on earth. Misconceptions and half-truths
abound in this field among non-experts. As such it is important
to first cover the basics of the modern theory of evolution.

A Brief Primer on Evolution

The theory of evolution itself did not start with Darwin. It
goes back, in one form or another, to ancient times as
philosophers and thinkers tried to make sense of their
observations regarding various animals, life forms, and their
relationships to each other. Some of the better known
philosophers who developed some thoughts and theories
regarding the evolution of species include Plato (427 B.C.),
Aristotle (384 B.C.), Descartes (1628), Buffon (1707), Linnaeus
(1707), Kant (1790), Cuvier (1796), Lamarck (1744), and others.

However, the seeds of the modern theory of evolution, which
is widely accepted today, were planted by Charles Darwin’s 1859
book On the Origin of Species. Although Darwin did not know
about DeoxyriboNucleic Acid (better known as “DNA”)
molecule and genes, he meticulously observed that species
change over time based on the demands of their environment.
He proposed the theory that this change is due to natural
selection (we will revisit this concept a bit later). But this is not
the whole story of evolution. When we think about the concept
of natural selection, the question that naturally and inevitably
comes up is: selection among what options? Where did these

options come from in the first place to select from? Let’s
briefly see how evolution works.

The DNA

To understand how the theory of evolution explains the
change and diversification of species, we need to have a basic
understanding of the building blocks of life. DNA is a very long
molecule that holds the information or code for building living
organisms. This information is in the form of encoded genetic
instructions. DNA has a particular structure, a double-stranded
helical ladder composed of a backbone made of alternating
sugar molecules (deoxyribose) and phosphate molecules, and
nucleotides made of four nucleobase molecules attached to the
sugars. Each nucleotide is composed of one nucleobase,
including Guanine (G), Adenine (A), Thymine (T), and Cytosine
(C).6

Notwithstanding other details, DNA’s most prominent
feature is that it is essentially a structure for stringing together
a combination of A, C, G, and T, such as T-T-G-T-C-C-A-C-T-
A-A-A-G-G ... . The two strands in the double helix are mirror
images of each other and every nucleotide has a fixed
complement: across (not adjacent to) the ladder, A and T always
go together, as do G and C. The pairs A-T and G-C are also
called base pairs. So, if one strand has T at one point, the other
strand has an A at the same point opposite this strand; and the
same for C and G. That’s how DNA molecule reproduces itself,
which happens every time a cell divides. The double helix
“unzips” down the middle into two single strands. Each single
strand chemically binds to its mirror image nucleotide one at a
time to reconstruct a double helix. Thus, two double helix
strands result via this process from the original one.

For most part, DNA sequences may be divided into encoding
and non-encoding. The encoding DNA is used to encode and
synthesize proteins, which make up the physical body of living
organisms. The non-encoding DNA sequences are mostly

264                                          Lights of Irfán vol. 15

functional structures, such as transfer RNAs and regulatory
RNAs. The human DNA is about 98% non-encoding. Other
species have different proportions of encoding and non-
encoding sequences.

Whether encoding or non-encoding, DNA sequence
combinations play a critical role in the formation and function
of life. This assertion becomes obvious when we realize that the
difference between a bee, an elephant, an octopus, and a human
is the particular combination of their respective DNA. If the
DNA of an elephant is rearranged in exactly the right way, an
octopus will result, not an elephant. That’s the miracle of the
DNA: one mechanism, almost unlimited designs.

The DNA is further organized into functional segments
called genes, each of which performs one or more functions
such as synthesize particular types of proteins. The human
genome contains about 30,000 genes on 46 chromosomes. A
chromosome is a structure composed of a large segment of the
DNA molecule containing hundreds or thousands of genes.
With each gene having an average of about 100,000 base pairs,
the whole human DNA contains about 3,000,000,000 (3 Billion
or 3B) base pairs. In addition to the structure of DNA briefly
described here, the genes can switch on and off, which controls
the performance and timing of gene expressions and their
respective functions.

In summary, the sequence or combination of base pairs and
the combination of genes and their switching control the
production, function, and behavior of every animal and every
part or organ of that animal. The functions and behaviors
include internal functions such as physiology, immune system,
digestion, reproduction, and the like, and external functions
such as various instincts, locomotion, mating habits, and the
like. When the combinations change, so do the characteristics or
the very identity of the animal the new combination produces.

The Nuts and Bolts of Evolution

We can now get back to the business of evolution. The
evolution of species includes two major processes: mutation
and natural selection. These twin processes are not rare events
and occur in all living organisms on a constant basis. Mutation
means rapid change or transformation, and it is the true engine
of evolution. In the context of evolution, mutation means a
change of the DNA sequence, or arrangement of base-pairs.
Other effects of mutation may include changes in the makeup
and the switching characteristics of genes. Mutation is believed
to occur randomly as a result of various factors, some internal
and some external. The most important internal factor is DNA
replication error. During DNA replication, the wrong
nucleotide may be copied altering the DNA sequence and the
biological characteristics that flow from it in the resulting
animal. Since cells constantly divide to keep our bodies renewed
and functioning, mutations happen all the time due to
replication errors. External sources of mutation include
radiation, chemicals, and cosmic rays.

What mutation does for evolution is to create variations in
species. When an animal’s DNA changes by mutation, the
offspring of that animal will have different DNA and different
characteristics than its parent. And from then on, a new
variation of that animal, or even a new species starts. So, as
more mutations happen more variations in the species occur
also. But every different characteristic of an animal allows a
different interaction with the environment in which the animal
lives. For example, if a mutation causes the legs of a deer to
grow a bit longer, then the deer can run faster, but longer lanky
legs may also be less nimble and maneuverable. So, depending
on the deer’s environment, terrain, and types of predators the
longer legs may help or hurt its survival. This is where natural
selection comes in, the second process of evolution.

Natural selection is as much a brilliant idea as it is simple. It
is almost common sense, once you know it. It simply means that

266                                           Lights of Irfán vol. 15

the animal with the characteristics that make it the fittest for
the particular environment in which the animal lives, has the
best chance of survival and reproduction. Hence, the fittest
animal flourishes while the animals with characteristics that
makes them less fit for that particular environment eventually
die out. From this simple definition a few important points may
be gleaned.

One, natural selection is based on fitness relative to the
environment. There is no such thing as fitness in a vacuum. The
concept of fitness is relative to how well certain animal
characteristics help the animal survive in a particular
environment. The same exact characteristic that may be a
liability in one environment, may be a valuable asset in another.
The slender legs of a deer make it a fast runner, but not a fast
swimmer, just as the flippers of a seal make it fast swimmer, but
not a fast runner.

Two, the threshold of natural selection is death because death
prevents the reproduction and continuation of a particular
variation of a species. Natural selection may take shorter or
longer time to complete, but if the characteristic that is less
suitable for a particular environment does not result in the
death, and thus, the non-reproduction of the animal, then that
variation will simply survive and become another animal in the
environment. For example, Indian lions and tigers, which are
variations of a big cat, have different markings and different
hunting behaviors, but both survive in the forests of India. This
is because their variations in that particular environment do not
rise to the threshold of death for either species and so both
species continue to survive.

Three, natural selection for the same animal can come about
because of a change in the animal or a change in its
environment. This is because natural selection is based not just
on the characteristics of the animal, but on the interactions
between these characteristics and its environment. For example,
polar bears thrive in the cold winters of the north pole, but if

the temperature of the pole rises beyond a certain threshold,
then even though the bears have not changed, they may be
selected by nature for extinction due to the shortage of food
and hunting grounds.

In summary, evolution continues when the process of
mutation creates random variation of species and the process of
natural selection selects the fittest ones. This way, new species
evolve and change by accumulating little changes over time and
the animal species increase in number and diversity.

This all sounds very plausible and of course there are literally
tons of science and data supporting change, survival, and
extinction of species due to the process of evolution. So, what’s
wrong with this theory or belief, the plausibility of random
mutations? To answer this question, we first need to understand
large numbers and the probabilities associated with them.

Abdul-Bahá briefly explains the sources of formation of
various entities, including species of animals. He explains:

Below, we take a closer and more modern look at what
Abdul-Bahá terms “accidental.” We explore the reasons why
Abdul-Bahá stated, with regard to accidental composition, that
“It is self-evidently false.”

A Brief Primer on Probability and Large Numbers

For our purposes, the discussion of probabilities and their
application to random mutation in an evolutionary context,
requires a clear understanding of large numbers and the
associated probabilities. So, we dedicate a few paragraphs to
each of these related topics.

Large Numbers

Size matters! Just as a glass of water from the ocean, even
though identical in composition, cannot contain a whale, does
not generate waves, and does not support the development of a
hurricane, when large numbers are involved, questions of
probabilities transform into questions of possibilities.

We can talk about Quadrillion (1015), Googol (10100), and
Googolplex (10Googol), to name a few famous large numbers, but
to truly understand the significance and impact of large
numbers, we have to look elsewhere. An important key to
understanding large numbers is growth rate. Generally, a change
in a cause creates a corresponding, but not necessarily
proportional change in its effect. We can appreciate the impact
of the change in a cause-and-effect context. For example, the
speed of a car before an accident is the cause of its impact (zero
speed = zero impact). Observing the difference in damages

between impacts resulting from a speed of 10 m.p.h. and a
speed of 25 m.p.h., can tell us something more about the effect
of speed than observing just one instance of damage. It tells us
about the relationship between the cause and effect. In many
phenomena encountered in nature, the relationship between
cause and effect is not linear. That is, doubling the cause may
change the effect less or more than double.

Another important key to appreciating size is comparison to
a well-understood quantity. A poignant example is the number
of electrons in the universe. One would think this number
should be unimaginably large, and it is, but it doesn’t look like
it. The number of electrons in the known universe is estimated
by the Eddington Number (NEdd = number of protons = number
of electrons = 1.57 1079), which is less than only 1080! Compare
this to the number of grains of sand on all the beaches on earth.
If one is asked about the number of grains of sand, chances are
he would estimate it to be more than 1080, or something of this
order, without understanding the truly gigantic size of this
number. So, let’s start by noting that the earth itself is smaller
than a grain of sand in comparison to the whole universe, and
that each real grain of sand has trillions of trillions of electrons
within it.

To fully understand and appreciate the size of this number,
let’s get some help from growth rate. Avagadro’s number
specifies the number of atoms in a gram-atom (atomic mass
number in grams) of a material. For example, a gram-atom of
the element Iron (Fe) is 56, which means a gram-atom of Iron is
56 grams. The Avagadro’s number is numerically equal to 6.022
x 1023. Imagine a 56 gram piece of iron, such as a 4-inch nail. It
literally contains 6.022 x 1023 actual Iron atoms. Now let’s grow
this number from about 1023 to 1080. All of a sudden we go from
a humble 4-inch nail which fits in the palm of your hand to the
size of the entire universe! We can begin to see the immensity
of 1080, and even further, the immensity of exponential growth,
because by increasing the exponent of Avagadro’s number, 23,
merely by 57 (to get to 80), we grow from the size of a nail to

270                                           Lights of Irfán vol. 15

the size of the universe. And the growth is even greater than it
appears here, because 1080 is the number of electrons which are
much more numerous than atoms and molecules specified by the
Avagadro’s number.

Probability

With our new and improved understanding of large numbers,
we can now turn our attention to the basics of probabilities.
Probability is the field of mathematics for the study of
“ignorance,” or put more delicately, imperfect knowledge. At
its heart, probability is a counting game. We count an outcome
or event of interest (Ei) among all possible outcomes or events
(Ea) in a process. We say the probability (P) of an outcome of
interest is the ratio of the outcomes of interest to all possible
outcomes: P(Ei) = Ei/Ea.

A few simple examples should make this concept clear. As a
first example, a coin has two sides, heads and tails. So, the
number of possible outcomes of a coin toss (the process) is 2. If
our outcome of interest is heads, the probability of getting
heads is: P(heads) = heads/[heads or tails] = 1/2 = 0.5 = 50%,
which is intuitively obvious.

As a second example, consider a deck of playing cards, which
has 52 cards including four different suits, red and black colors,
and 13 different ranks of each suit. So, each card is unique in
rank and suit. As such the probability of a particular card, such
as 10 of Diamonds, is P(10 of Diamonds) = 1/52. The
probability of a red card is P(red) = 26/52 = 1/2 = 50%. And the
probability of a face is P(face) = (3 faces x 4 suits)/52 = 12/52.

To be sure, the mathematics of probabilities can get quite
complex, including conditional and Bayesian probabilities,
various types of density and distribution functions, discrete and
continuous density functions, random variables, and many other
concepts. However, all of the complexity encountered is in the
service of counting or quantifying the number of events of

interest and the number of total possible outcomes. But these
complicated counting techniques for complicated processes do
not alter the basic nature of probability as a simple ratio
defined above.

Two of the most common and useful counting techniques
include combinations and permutations. A combination of N
objects is the number of ways the N objects can be combined
regardless of the order of the objects. For example, given three
object A, B, and C, the combination ABC and CAB are
considered to be the same combination.

For the analysis of probabilities governing DNA mutations,
we need permutations, which is defined as N objects selected
for P positions. A familiar example of permutation is found in
combination locks. Imagine a three-dial padlock with 10 digits
on each dial. For each of the 10 digits on the first dial, there are
10 digits on the second dial, and for each of the 10 digits on the
second dial, there are 10 digits on the third one. Thus, the
number of permutations possible is 10 x 10 x 10 = 1,000. In
general, the number of permutations of N objects arranged in P
positions is NP. In permutations, order is important, so ABC
and CAB are two different permutations.

Possibility of Random Evolution

As a probability model, permutation is perfectly suited for
the structure of DNA. Applied to DNA, N = the number of
nucleobase = 4 (i.e., A, C, G, and T), and P = number of
positions = 3 Billion, because each of four nucleobase are
arranged in three billion positions on the DNA molecule. Thus,
the number of possible permutations of the human DNA is
43,000,000,000 = 101,807,000,000 = 101.8B.

In the context of evolution based on random mutations, a
desired probability event is a DNA combination that results in a
useful trait of a living organism, a “useful trait” being any part
of the anatomy, physiology, or behavior of the organism that

272                                           Lights of Irfán vol. 15

enhances its chances of survival in its environment. For
example, thick white fur for the polar bear are traits that
enhance its chances of survival in its polar environment by
providing warmth and camouflage. Similarly, large ears serve
the African elephant by providing cooling in the hot desert
climate. But these traits are generated by particular
combinations of the nucleobases forming the genes of these
animals. A variation in the genes of the African elephant may
result in ears like a cat instead of an elephant, ears growing out
of its rump, or worse yet, no ears at all. The point is that very
few combinations of nucleobases may result in a trait optimized
for survival in a particular environment.

Generally, in any system, and particularly complex systems,
there is a very small subset of the combinations of its
components that would create a functional system. This is a
rather obvious point when considering a concrete example, such
as a computer, an electronic circuit board, or an industrial
machine. For example, even in a relatively simple system such as
a bicycle, the components, such as the handlebar, wheels, chain,
pedal, seat, etc. must be assembled in a particular configuration
for the bicycle to function. Maybe the left and right pedals
could be interchanged, or the handlebar can be assembled
backwards, constituting various functional configurations, but
the wheel and the seat cannot be interchanged to create a
working configuration.

A living organism is many orders of magnitude more complex
than any human-made “complex” system. Compared with the
total number of permutations in the DNA molecule, 101.8B, the
number of permutations that may result in useful traits is
miniscule, as is the probability of it happening randomly.
Actually, the probability of a random mutation of a large DNA
molecule resulting in a useful change in an animal would be
close to mathematical zero. To show how this result works out,
let’s examine some numbers. Since the beginning of life on
earth, it is estimated that about two Billion animal species have
ever existed on earth (estimates range from 1 to 4 Billion), with

about 8.7 million existing on earth today. Let’s assume each
species on the average has one Billion characteristics or traits
created by the genetic code. Such characteristics include
anatomical features, physiological characteristics, behavioral
adaptations, instincts, cellular and organ processes, and any
other type of trait that is embodied in the animal. The
probability of any one of these features occurring randomly is:

P(one useful trait) = [number of all traits ever created] /
[total DNA permutations]
= [2 x 109 x 109 ] / 101.8B
= [ 2 x 1018] / 101.8B = 0

Equation 1.

Well, this probability is actually not zero, strictly and
mathematically speaking, but there isn’t enough paper in a
stationary store to write all the zeros after the decimal point:
0\.0000...2. The number of zeros after decimal point is 1.8
Billion minus 18! that’s 1.8 Billion zeros before the 2. This
number, representing the probability, is zero in any context and
for any purpose. And just for fun, if there were one Billion
mutations per second for the last 4.5 billion years (approximate
age of earth), we would cover only about 1.4 x 1026
combinations out of the 101.8B possible DNA combinations,
which can be shown in a manner similar to equation (1) above, is
equivalent to a zero portion of the total combinations.

And the above is the probability of only a single useful trait,
randomly selected. This means that this probability is repeated
for every one of the 2 x 1018 traits. So, the probability of all of
these traits having resulted from a random process since the
beginning of life on earth is represented by the fraction [ 2 x
1018] / 101.8B multiplied by itself 2 x 1018 times! That makes the
denominator unimaginably large and the probability
unimaginably small. Even a description of the size will be

274                                           Lights of Irfán vol. 15

difficult to manage, let alone showing the number itself. In
short, random evolution is an impossible proposition.

Microevolution

To get around the obviously impossible odds of random
mutation to create even a single trait of a single organism, let
alone the millions of traits of each of the two Billion species,
the mechanism of microevolution has been proposed. Simply
put, microevolution is identical to the process of evolution
described above, which is a description of macroevolution, but
it is limited to small mutations (small changes) within a species.
Over time, accumulated microevolutions may result in a
macroevolution differentiating a new species from an original
or existing species. So, microevolution and macroevolution are
the same process at different time (and change) scales.

The purported benefit of this theory to get around the non-
existent probability of random mutation is that a small
mutation is much more probable than a single big mutation.
Sure enough, this is a true statement, but its scope is limited to
a single microevolution, not a series of them that collectively
result in the same macro evolution. You cannot cheat
mathematics or get around it by intellectual parlor tricks.

Let’s look at the probabilities of microevolution more
closely. This examination will show that the probability of a big
change is the same as the collective probability of a cumulative
series of small changes that result in the same big change. With
reference to Figure 5 below, imagine a string of nine
nucleobases, each position on the string having a choice of the
four nucleobase A, C, G, and T. The number of combinations
possible for the whole string is thus NP = 49. So, the total
probability of a new combination obtained by random mutation
for the whole string is based on this number (as the probability
denominator). Now, let’s see how the probabilities change if
only a subset of the whole string is mutated. Consider three
subsets defined by positions 1-4, 5-6, and 7-9. The respective

probabilities for these three subsets are based on 44, 42, and 43,
as the total number of combinations possible for the respective
subsets. But, the total probability, namely, the probability that
particular events happen in the three subsets separately, but that
collectively yield a desirable trait is calculated as: 44 x 42 x 43 =
44+2+3 = 49, which is the same as the probability of the whole
string changing at once, as pointed out above.

Whether the subsets above are defined in time or space, that
is, whether they belong to the same DNA molecule (defined over
space) or belong to different DNA molecules, which are
combined over time (defined over time), the probabilities work
out the same.

Figure 5: Equivalence of Micro probabilities and overall

probability

Another point that merits attention is that even though, as
shown above, the probabilities of random mutation ending up
in any useful trait is zero, those probabilities were calculated
based on the full human DNA with 3 Billion nucleobases. The
DNA molecules of the earlier life forms were much smaller, so
the probabilities of generating useful traits by chance would
have been more realistic, relatively speaking. However,
probabilities still decrease exponentially as complexity rises.
How probabilities decrease as a function of complexity can be

276                                          Lights of Irfán vol. 15

better understood when described in more detail using
illustrative examples.

In a probabilistic system, starting with simple components,
simple subassemblies may be formed by chance that happen to
be useful. Simple components by nature have simple
requirements to combine with other simple components to form
subassemblies. We will call these level-1 subassemblies. For
example, consider children’s building blocks (like Lego blocks)
that can be assembled into various structures, vehicles, and the
like. Individual blocks can be combined randomly to build
simple subassemblies such as a right angle corner, a simple
staircase-like structure, a curved section, and the like. Next
level of combination will involve combining these level-1
subassemblies into level-2 subassemblies. However, the
requirements to do so will be more complex also because level-1
subassemblies can only be combined in more peculiar ways with
other level-1 subassemblies to produce a useful level-2
subassembly. For example, to form a circle as a level-2
subassembly, two or more curved sections must be connected
end to end to form the circle. If they are combined end to
middle, or the curvature is backwards, then a circle will not
result.

Hence, as we get more complex subassemblies from simpler
ones, the probability of randomly forming the next level also
decreases exponentially. This exponential decrease of
probability is due to two factors: one, the increased number of
subassemblies at each level, creating a larger total number of
outcomes (i.e., increasing the probability ratio denominator),
and two, the particular ways and limited ways that complex
subassemblies can combine with each other to create useful
higher-level subassemblies, creating a smaller number of useful
combinations (i.e., decreasing the probability ratio numerator).
In effect, as the subassemblies become more numerous and
more complex, a wall of probability rises very quickly against
forming the next level of subassemblies by chance. For example,
the building blocks are very unlikely to form a complex

structure, such as a house with multiple rooms, windows, and
doors, by random combination from successively more complex
subassemblies. Thus, clearly this wall of probability will
preclude the random creation of complex systems, such as living
organisms, from simpler forms beyond the very elementary
stages. This is another aspect of the discussion we had above
with respect to Figure 5 regarding combined probabilities of
smaller subsets.

The above discussions covered the probabilistic aspect of the
high-to-low flow principle. It showed that in probabilistic
systems in which randomness plays a role, combinations having
low probability (complex systems with high content level)
cannot result from simpler components having high probability
(simple systems with low content level). It also means that the
high-level contents of a complex system must preexist within
the simple components or augment them from another external
source.

Alternative Models of Evolution

So, if the species did not come about by random mutation,
how did the two billion or so species, each with millions of
complex and optimized attributes, appear on earth during the
past few billion years? In light of the above principles, there are
at least two major possibilities. One, each mutation was
directed or guided by God in a transcendental manner, which
precludes direct and complete scientific observation because
one end of such interaction, namely God’s end, is in non-
observable realms. And two, the potential for each mutation
that results in useful traits is already built into the DNA
molecule and is only triggered by various events or stimuli,
which may be random (such as cosmic rays) or regular (such as
seasonal or climate changes) in nature. As a hypothetical
example, the potential of color change in the arctic fox that
allows a change of color in its coat to pure white in the winter
and to dark and light patches in the summer, may have been
built into the DNA of its ancestor prior to the development of

278                                             Lights of Irfán vol. 15

the arctic species. At some point, the intense cold might have
triggered this built-in potential to change the DNA in a very
specific way in respond to such external stimuli.

Such design is similar to the design of a software system in
which various logical input conditions cause the program to
behave differently because the logic to respond to each type of
input is already designed and built into the program. In the
absence of a particular input type, the appropriate response to
it is hidden and is not externally visible. But once that input
type is applied, the corresponding program behavior is
triggered. As a specific example, consider the software behavior
on a modern smart phone, which is designed to respond to both
voice and text data. If all you receive are voice calls, then the
phone simply rings like old telephones to alert the user and
provide voice communications. But if it receives a text message,
then it displays the message and allows the user to enter text in
response. No voice communication is established. The point is
that both behaviors are built into the software of the phone,
but each one appears only when the appropriate input type is
applied. Similarly, if all useful animal attributes for each species
are already designed into the DNA of the species, then it only
takes an external trigger to genetically transform the animal to a
new species (or a different and better adapted version of the
existing species) revealing new attributes and behaviors. Even
though such attributes give the illusion of being completely new
and randomly occurring, actually, they might already have been
designed in.

Hence, whether God actively guides each mutation as it
happens or He has already built in the potential in the DNA
from the beginning, the mutation process cannot be purely
random. A point that merits mentioning here is that a process
may be random in some regards, yet purposeful in others. For
example, if one walks a mile from home to work, each step that
he takes is random as he does not purposefully select each exact
spot on the ground on which he sets foot in each step. Yet, his
destination is not random. If he repeats this exercise every day,

he always ends up at his work place, not some random
destination like the grocery store, or the park. Hence, in the
process of walking, we see that both elements of randomness
and purposefulness can coexist without being contradictory. So
it is with evolution. There may well be random elements in the
evolutionary process, such as various internal or external
events, climate change, etc., but the end-to-end process cannot
be random in its entirety.

An Alternative View of the Origins of Creation

We saw that the big bang was more of a description rather
than an explanation of creation. Even at that, it is probably just
a partial description of some aspects of the process of creation.
The pre-existence principle requires that something pre-exists
everything, including the universe itself. That something is in
another realm, the realm of pre-existence, which by implication
contains the universe and all its potentials. So, pre-existence
was there before the existence of the universe. But, part of the
big bang and inflation theory is that time itself came into
existence at the moment of the big bang and there was no
“before” prior to the big bang. So, how do we reconcile the
concept of “pre-existence,” which implies “before,” with the
concept of no time prior to the big bang in the realm of pre-
existence?

Order and Priority

To answer this question we need to examine the concept of
“priority.” Time may be represented by a sequence of ordered
values akin to integers: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, ... . The concepts of
“before” and “after” are meaningful in the context of this
sequence. For example, with respect to time = 4, times 1, 2, and
3 are “before” and times 5 and 6 are “after.” But, time is not the
only sequence imaginable. Many sequences are possible. Any
variable that represents a quantity and which can take on
ordered values defines a sequence. And in every ordered

280                                            Lights of Irfán vol. 15

sequence we have a “before” and an “after” with respect to each
value in the sequence. For example, if there are 10 trees in a row
numbered from 1 to 10, a sequence is defined, which is
independent of time. Traversing the trees from 1 to 10, the 6th
tree in the sequence is always “before” the 8th tree and “after”
the third one, regardless of time. Hence, in the realm of pre-
existence a sequence different from our familiar time may
define and dictate events. In this context, pre-existence came
before the universe in an abstract sequence, not in time.

Types of Causality

Closely related to the concept of sequence is the concept of
causality we reviewed in relation to Figure 1 above. The
causality with which we are familiar is defined by the material
world and operates in time: cause always precedes effect
chronologically. We will call this chronological causality. Next
we will introduce another type of causality: the Relational
Causality. The relational causality is defined by relationships,
not by the material world, and operates in an abstract sequence,
not in time. For example, a triangle “causes” the sum of its
internal angles to equal 180 degrees. In this example, we say that
the triangle “causes” the sum of its angles to be 180 degrees
because the existence of the triangle always comes first, not in
time, but in sequence. This means three angles the sum of which
add up to 180 degrees do not necessarily define a triangle. They
may be created by several intersecting lines in various
configurations, such as four intersecting lines which do not
create a closed loop as shown in Figure 6, below:

Figure 6: Illustration of Relational Causality

Thus, the triangle takes precedence and has priority, in a
relational sense, over its angles, but not vice versa. There is no
chronological distance, that is, no time passes between the
creation of a triangle and the emergence of its internal angles,
which add up to 180 degrees. It is literally instantaneous.
Mathematically, at the moment of the creation of the triangle,
the three internal angles are also formed and add up to 180
degrees. This is relational causality: no time is needed, but there
is still a cause-and-effect relationship.

An important property of relational causality is that the
relational cause is permanently needed to sustain the relational
effect. Thus, not only there is a causation relationship between
the relational cause and effect, there is also a sustaining
relationship between the two: the cause creates the effect and
then must sustain it during its existence. If the cause is
removed, the effect will automatically and instantaneously cease
to exist. For example, the moment a triangle is formed, it causes
the sum of its angles to be 180 degrees. And the moment the
triangle is taken apart, the sum of its angles ceases to be 180
degrees. Hence, not only the triangle creates the angle
configuration, but also it is needed to sustain it. This is in
contrast to chronological causality that once the effect is
created the cause can go away without affecting the effect. For
example, if a rock is thrown and causes a glass to break, the
rock can be removed and the glass remains broken. The rock is
not needed anymore to keep the glass broken.

Properly defined, relational causality is the inherence
relationship between two entities. Inherence is not a two-way
street. If A and B are inherent, that is, if they always appear
together, still one entity always has precedence. One entity is
always “first” in the sense of an abstract sequence, and the other
one is “next.” Inherence is shown in logical terms using a
propositional logic operation called implication or modus
ponens. The reason that inherence is one-way is found in the
properties of implication:

282                                           Lights of Irfán vol. 15

If [A ⇒ B AND B ⇒ A], Then A = B;7

Equation 2.

The above is a well-known and easily proven result of logical
implication. This means if A and B both imply each other, that
is, if the inherence relationship between A and B was two-way,
then A and B would be identical, one, and the same. Therefore,
an inherence relationship between A and B, as different entities,
must be one-way with A taking precedence over B.

Realms of Existence

After this necessary excursion into the alternate concepts of
“before” and “after” in the context of non-time sequences, and
relational causality, we can now get back to the alternate view
of creation.

Based on the principle of pre-existence, a realm outside of
our physical universe must exist to provide the universe with its
pre-existing seed, the potential for all that is contained in the
universe including its matter, energy, laws of nature, etc. all
before the big bang happened.

Based on the principle of high to low flow, the contents, in
whatever form, must originate from a high level to a low level.
The question that naturally comes up is: where did the pre-
existing seed come from? And the causality saga continues
backwards towards the ultimate source, the First Cause. If we
are to finally break the causality chain, terminating it with the
First Cause, we must understand the requirements of being the
First Cause.

The first requirement of being the First Cause is that it
cannot have any boundaries, because a boundary necessitates a
supply on the other side, continuing the chain of causality. By
definition of a boundary, the only way a boundary can be
avoided is if the First Cause is infinite in every sense, which is
also a prime part of the attributes of what God is. This

requirement also precludes the multiplicity of god. If He has no
boundaries, then God never “ends” for another god to “begin.”

Another requirement is that the First Cause must contain, in
some form, all attributes, properties, and contents of
everything subordinate to it, because all of these entities must
originate from the First Cause. Therefore, being the ultimate
origin of mind and intellect (and everything else), the First
Cause cannot be a simple or mindless law, like the laws of
nature we observe. It cannot simply be some mindless property
that causes other forms of existence to come into being.
Because such mindless properties cannot contain the more
advanced attributes, as discussed above with respect to high to
low flow principle. In one of His prayers, the Bab bears ample
witness to this truth:

> Whatever God hath willed hath been, and that which He
> hath not willed shall not be. There is no power nor
> strength except in God, the Most Exalted, the Most
> Mighty. [BP 131]

And the third requirement is that the First Cause must be
homogeneous and elemental, that is, it cannot be composed of
any components or parts. Because as soon as it has parts, then it
is conceivable that the parts can be separated, decomposing the
First Cause. Moreover, having components introduce internal
limits that violate the first requirement above.

A few points are noteworthy here. Even though a
“requirement” smacks of “limitations,” the above three
requirements are anything but constraints or limitations on
God. To the contrary, they are His attributes, the descriptions
of His limitless and unconstrained nature: being infinite and
having no boundaries, containing everything conceivable in
some form, and not having any parts that create internal
boundaries and limitations, are all descriptions of His absolute
and utter independence and self-sufficiency. Another important
point is that these attributes (or “requirements”) set Him apart

284                                            Lights of Irfán vol. 15

from His creation, making him categorically different from the
other ordinary links in the causal chain. None of his creation at
any point has any of these attributes as described above. None
of these are true about the physical existence and none are true
about the realm of pre-existence. So, God must dwell in a realm
all His own, as confirmed in Bahá’í Writings: “God singly and
alone abideth in His own place which is holy above space and
time, mention and utterance, sign, description, and definition,
height and depth.” [TN 64]

Considering the above points collectively, a conception of
the First Cause emerges as an infinite, unchanging, inexhaustible
reservoir of existence and its attributes which flows downward
into the creation in whatever form it may assume. There may be
one or an infinite number of layers between the creation we see
as this physical universe and the First Cause, but ultimately the
chain must terminate to provide an explanation of the origins
of creation because infinite regression is not an explanation.
This conception of the First Cause or God, as we commonly
refer to Him, is consistent with a willful, purposeful,
omniscient, all powerful, all knowing, and intelligent being as
the creator, as opposed to a dumb, purposeless, and mindless set
of natural laws that just happens to be out there.

An analogy which may be illuminating about the nature of
the relationship between God and His creation is that of a
human being and his shadow. The shadow of a person seems to
have a separate existence from him, seems to have its own
attributes and behaviors, and more or less reflects the nature of
the person, while all the time the shadow is an emanation of that
person. It is not a part of that person, it has no true
independence from him, and is utterly dependent on the person.
If the person ceases to exist, so will the shadow. Similarly, the
creation and every creature in it, in some sense, may be a
shadow of God, reflecting His attributes, to the extent it can. A
mineral reflects such attributes at its own level, as does a plant,
an animal, and a human.

The Bahá’í Writings teach this verity in numerous tablets.

For example, Baha’u’llah expounds:

> Say: Nature in its essence is the embodiment of My
> Name, the Maker, the Creator. Its manifestations are
> diversified by varying causes, and in this diversity there
> are signs for men of discernment. Nature is God’s Will
> and is its expression in and through the contingent
> world. It is a dispensation of Providence ordained by the
> Ordainer, the All-Wise. [TB 141]

And Abdul-Bahá states, in Some Answered Questions,

> ... all beings and all existences are the centers from which
> the glory of God is reflected - that is to say, the signs of
> the Divinity of God are apparent in the realities of
> things and of creatures. ... Nothing is deprived of this
> benefit. [SAQ 195]

An interesting implication of this view of the creation is that
it necessitates one of two models of the physical universe. One
is that once created, as a result of the big bang, the physical
universe will eventually die out in a cold death, where no energy
differential, thermal or otherwise, remains between any of the
material bodies in the universe and thus no interactions of any
kind can take place. This is a direct result of the principle of
high to low flow in general, and the second law of
thermodynamics, in particular. In this scenario, since creation is
inherent with the existence of God, another universe must pop
out from the realm of pre-existence. Potentially infinitely many
universes can pop out from the pre-existence. This is the same
result as what is professed in the multi-verse theory of creation,
which tries to explain the anthropic nature of this universe and
the suitability of its natural laws and constants for life, as
explained above. We have arrived at the same conclusion, but
for very different reasons. In a sense, existence is like a garden
of creation in which God continuously plants new universes

286                                          Lights of Irfán vol. 15

which grow to their perfection and then stay their course until
their end.

Another model is that there is only one infinite physical
universe, ours, which is somehow replenished with high levels of
energy and information by God, may be through more localized
big bangs coming out of the quantum fabric underlying the
structure of the physical universe. But science has not found
any evidence of such process or similar ones so far.

The Greatest Name

A calligraphic representation of the symbol known by Bahá’ís
as the “Greatest Name” is shown below in Figure 7. This sacred
Bahá’í symbol is related to a number of Tablets by the Bab and
Abdul-Bahá that describe its meanings and significance. Briefly,
of the three parallel horizontal lines, the lower one represents
humanity and the world of creation, the upper line represents
the realm of God, and the middle line represents the special
station of Manifestations of God or the realm of revelation.
The vertical line represents the Primal Will or Holy Spirit
proceeding from God through the Manifestations to humanity.
The position of Manifestation of God in this symbol is said to
be the linking point to God. The two stars or Haykals represent
Bahá’u’lláh and the Báb, the twin Manifestations of God.8

Figure 7: The Greatest Name

There is a remarkable parallel between the symbolism
embedded in the Greatest Name symbol, described above, and

the dictates of logic discussed in this paper. The Greatest Name
symbolizes the inherently and permanently separate realms of
God, revelation, and creation by parallel lines that never
intersect. These are structurally similar and semantically
analogous to the realms of God, pre-existence, and physical
universe, respectively, discussed in this paper. Additionally, the
parallel lines indicate all three realms have always had this
relationship with each other and that there was no chronological
beginning to one or the other. The vertical line indicates the
connection between God and His creation via His Primal Will,
consistent with the principle of high to low flow. The similarity
between the Greatest Name symbol and the theories developed
here is not contrived as we did not start with the Greatest Name
symbol or any of its meanings and allusions. Yet, the structure
of existence that emerged based on a science-based rational
discourse turned out to have a striking similarity to the Greatest
Name. We take this as a very welcome confirmation, at least
regarding the major points, if not the details.

Conclusion

The question of the origin of creation is very simple. The
answer is not. The question simply poses the query “where did
all this creation, matter, energy, laws, time, space, natural
constants, life, etc., come from?” To attempt to answer this
question, in every age, man has depended on his level of
knowledge at the time to come up with different theories and
explanations. Of course, various religions have provided
different stories of creation, which were rooted in truth but
were tailored to the understanding of man during their
dispensations. As humanity gained knowledge and experience,
these explanations were cast aside one by one. In time, a tangled
web of detailed information, scientific and cultural, emerged.
This tangled web is like the proverbial trees that hide the forest.
Thus, what used to be common sense all of a sudden came under
question. An outstanding example of the trees hiding the forest,
is the theory of evolution that purports to fully explain how

288                                           Lights of Irfán vol. 15

fantastically complex and well-adapted living organisms,
billions of them over the ages, came to be through a completely
random and mindless process. What seems to be common sense
that complex systems cannot spontaneously arise from simpler
ones, was suddenly thrown out in favor of complicated
explanations that serve to hide the plain truth. Similarly,
elaborate theories confirming the big bang and inflation
theories also serve the purpose of pushing this question one step
back without resolving it.

Far from seeking to discredit or deride the past or present
theories and explanations, this paper acknowledges their
contributions and uses some of their ideas, but suggests that
they do not paint a complete picture and leave important
questions unanswered. The lack of comprehensive coverage of
these theories is in part due to the discovery of new facts and
ideas that create new questions or pose the old questions in a
new light.

Aided by modern scientific knowledge, such as the big bang
and evolution theories, and modern mathematical logic and
probability theory, this paper attempted to answer the
unanswered questions based on rational arguments that sort the
trees without losing the forest in the process. Some novel
approaches, viewpoints, and principles were developed, partially
based on similar existing concepts, including the pre-existence
principle, the differential principle, the high to low principle,
and relational causality. These principles are partly based on
science and partly based on rational arguments, and paint a
picture considerably different from those before them. This
picture includes the observable universe, preceded by or
contained in a pre-existent realm, all created by God Who is the
relational cause of His creation, its sustainer, and the provider
of all its attributes, which flow down from Him. At the same
time, the results and conclusions are remarkably consistent with
the Bahá’í conception of creation and the relationship between
God and His creation.
