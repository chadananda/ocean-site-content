Chapter 6
Plausibility alignment on a Baha’i
email list
Computer-mediated communication and web technologies have been
exploited in many religious communities, both by leaders and the rank and
ﬁle. The technologies allow instantaneous and interactive communication
on a global scale, but these features are utilized in different ways, depending,
among other things, on whether the websites are set up by the leadership
or by the members at large. In the ﬁrst case, the interactive process is typically
a way of shaping and controlling the ﬂow of information to a person visit-
ing the website. In the second case, conversational communication on email
discussion lists provides spaces where both ongoing and novel issues arising
in the course of a community’s life can be discussed and adjusted or under-
stood anew. Some of these issues may provoke ideas and views that are
neither mainstream nor clearly heretical, but reside in that grey area where
a discussion needs to be unofﬁcial.

In what follows, we consider the dynamics of online interaction among
members of an independent (i.e. not officially sponsored) Baha’i-oriented
discussion group, Talisman, by analysing a single discussion thread. The
progress of this thread illustrates an interactive process of seeking truth
(or at least shared understanding) and provides an instance of plausibility
alignment carried out at the grass roots among a group of Baha’is. Talisman
discussants undertook their discursive enterprise without a mandate from
or supervision by a Baha’i institution. This factor, and the generally high
educational level of participants, made Talisman atypical of Baha’i discussion
lists, many of which enjoy sponsorship by agencies of the Baha’i community,
and function with full-time moderators.

Plausibility alignment
The term ‘plausibility alignment’, adopted from Jill McMillan (1988),
denotes a process by which a religious community – it could be any social
group – maintains a correspondence between its worldview and information
impinging on the group from the social context in which it resides. The
process is crucial to the ongoing viability of a community whose members
are beset by competing messages and truth claims from the broader social

Seeking for truth 87

milieu. McMillan’s piece was based on the work of Peter Berger. In The Social
Construction of Reality (1966), Berger and his collaborator Thomas
Luckmann described the critical importance of ‘plausibility structures’ –
social bases and processes that support and maintain particular social worlds.
These ‘structures’ need to be constantly reinforced through social processes,
largely though not exclusively through conversations among members of the
social group. In The Sacred Canopy (1967), Berger considered some impli-
cations of his findings for religious institutions. Among other points, he
argued that ‘secularization’ created an unprecedented situation: religious
legitimations of the world ‘have lost their plausibility not only for a few
intellectuals . . . but for broad masses of entire societies’ (Berger 1967: 124).
For Berger, secularization was critically linked to ‘pluralism’. In pluralistic
situations, religions have to compete not only with one another but also
with the reality-deﬁning agencies of society at large – government, the media,
the scientiﬁc establishment, and so forth. Berger wrote, ‘A “religious prefer-
ence” can be abandoned as readily as it was ﬁrst adopted’ (1967: 134). ‘As
a result, the religious tradition, which previously could be authoritatively
imposed, now has to be marketed. It must be “sold” to a clientele that is no
longer constrained to “buy”’ (1967: 138). To remain credible, religions are
forced to re-evaluate continuously and adaptively and adjust themselves
in light of what the public at large and their own adherents generally ﬁnd
believable. Though Berger does not use the term, the processes referred to as
globalization have extended the parameters of pluralism and exacerbated
this situation.

In her article, McMillan undertook a survey of literature which elucidated
various aspects of the concept of plausibility alignment. She argued that
‘the loss of plausibility presents a rhetorical problem to the religious insti-
tution’ (McMillan 1988: 327), and illustrated this point through a case study
of a major Christian denomination’s wrestling with the issue of sexism.
She focused on a formal position paper prepared by the Presbyterian Church
of the United States. McMillan noted how the paper had been crafted to
be acceptable to audiences both without and within the church (the latter
audience being the more important) and, simultaneously, to break new
ground by presenting, though in a very mild and tentative way, a new state-
ment regarding sexist language. The exercise described by McMillan was
carried out under the auspices of church authorities; examples of similar
productions could be found to illustrate very similar processes across a wide
range of religious groups, including the Baha’i religion.

The present chapter, on the other hand, considers an instance of plausibility
alignment carried out by a group of Baha’is at the grass-roots level who were
concerned about issues of ‘credibility’, but who carried no ofﬁcial mandate
or sanction for their activity.

The globe-spanning interactive capability of the Internet is exceedingly
well suited for facilitating plausibility alignment in a dispersed group. In the

88 David Piff and Margit Warburg

Baha’i context, electronic discussion lists offer participants a way to bypass
the religion’s restrictions regarding publication of material that has not been
institutionally reviewed (Warburg 2003). However, for the leadership of a
religion, it is probably not possible to permit a grass-roots process of plausi-
bility alignment to result directly in formal changes in religious doctrine or
presentation. To do so would be to allow the process to intrude upon a core
responsibility of the religious leadership, that of collectively acknowledged
interpretation.

Baha’i online
The Baha’i religion has its origins in a Shi’ite millenarian movement, which
rose in Iran in the middle of the nineteenth century. The movement was called
Babism after its prophet-leader, Ali Muhammad Shirazi (1819–1850), known
as the Bab. The Babi movement broke with Islam in 1848 and became
engaged in a series of bloody conflicts with the Iranian government. The
movement had been all but crushed by 1852, but Babism was revived and
transformed into the Baha’i religion by Mirza Husayn Ali Nuri (1817–1892),
known as Baha’u’llah. Baha’is believe that he was not only the prophet and
founder of a religious community but was the ‘promised one of all religions’,
whose mission was to establish the ‘Most Great Peace,’ the ‘Kingdom of
God on Earth’. Baha’u’llah’s son, Abdu’l-Baha (1844–1921), later became
the leader of the Baha’i religion, and he again was succeeded by his grandson,
Shoghi Effendi (1897–1957). During the twentieth century, through sys-
tematic missionary efforts, the Baha’i religion spread all over the world.
Today, the religion has a collective leadership of nine elected men who con-
stitute the highest authoritative Baha’i body, the Universal House of Justice,
situated in the Baha’i World Centre in Haifa, Israel. All Baha’i communities
around the world refer to the Universal House of Justice in administrative
and spiritual matters. The most sacred places on earth for the Baha’is are the
shrines of Baha’u’llah and of the Bab, both situated in the Haifa area, and
Haifa is therefore also a place of pilgrimage for Baha’is.

The official Baha’i website, The Baha’i World, is an apt illustration
of Christopher Helland’s characterization of an ‘ofﬁcial’ World Wide Web
presence: ‘Ofﬁcial web sites are often professionally designed; the information
presented and the environments created are controlled spaces where nothing
is left to chance. In this way the religious organization is attempting to
continue their institutional control and structure on-line’ (Helland 2002:
295). Www.bahai.org provides an attractive public gateway with links
to brief introductory information about the religion and to texts and pictures
illustrative of its view of itself as a global community. The site is profession-
ally maintained and kept current with news of recent Baha’i events and
accomplishments, and offers links to similar websites sponsored by some
sixty national Baha’i communities throughout the world. This cluster of

Seeking for truth 89

websites constitutes the principal formal presence of the religion in cyber-
space.

At the other end of the information spectrum, websites sponsored by
individuals and, more importantly, discussion groups organized to exchange
views about the religion represent unofﬁcial Baha’i cyber presences. These
spaces, which are not reachable from The Baha’i World, allow relatively free-
flowing and casual discussion of aspects of Baha’i life. To illustrate some
of the dynamics of online interaction, and, importantly, an instance of
plausibility alignment, we shall consider a Talisman discussion thread from
April 1995. As we intend to explore the text of the thread more deeply than
is usually done in sociological literature, we will have to content ourselves
with consideration of a single thread. This thread is one of many hundreds
that could have been selected from Talisman to illustrate the same processes.

Online plausibility negotiation – a Talisman
thread
Talisman, which functioned from October 1994 until May 1996, was created
to be an academically oriented forum for open and serious discussion of Baha’i
history, theology, administration, and community life.1 It was created and
managed by an American Baha’i university professor and open to members
of the religion as well as to non-members. A few basic rules governed the
group: discussions were un-moderated, but were expected to be courteous and
based on evidence; participants were to avoid abusive language, ad-hominem
arguments and accusations of heresy.

Despite its open membership policies, the overwhelming majority of
participants on Talisman were Baha’is (there were also a handful of former
Baha’is). Most ‘Talismanians’ were Western-educated; the group was pre-
dominantly male and included a number of Baha’i intellectuals, among them
journalists, professors, graduate students, and published scholars in such
fields as Middle East studies, religious studies, history, anthropology, sociology,
the natural sciences, and engineering. A number of Talisman participants,
while well educated, were not academics. What transpired through the
numerous discussion threads that unfolded and ramified on the list was,
generally, an ongoing interrogation of the community’s received knowledge
and current understandings in the light of prevailing academic attitudes
and standards. It should be noted, however, that there were also a good many
(intentionally) humorous postings to the list. Signiﬁcantly, the undertaking
was initiated by Baha’is who felt the need for a forum in which to discuss
issues that were of concern to many of them. Though similar discussions had
taken place at Baha’i study classes in various locales, the quantity, quality,
and speed of dissemination of such discussions were unprecedented.

The thread to be analysed here ran from 11 to 17 April 1995; its subject
was the so-called Mount Carmel Project at the Baha’i World Centre in Haifa.

90 David Piff and Margit Warburg

This project involved the erection of three major buildings at a site Baha’is
referred to as the ‘Arc’, and the construction of an adjacent set of terraces
and gardens surrounding the Shrine of the Bab and stretching nearly one
kilometre up and down the slope of Mount Carmel. Shoghi Effendi originally
planned both parts of the project, and two other buildings of the Arc had
been completed earlier. The project was at that time well under way (the
terraces were ofﬁcially inaugurated on 22 May 2001).

According to popular Baha’i belief, the completion of the Mount Carmel
Project would coincide in time with the ‘Lesser Peace’, a worldwide political
peace settlement spoken of in Baha’i scriptures. This expectation originated
in letters written by Shoghi Effendi. Addressing the Baha’is of the world in
1954 about the projected construction of the ‘International Baha’i Archives’
on Mount Carmel (the ﬁrst of the buildings of the Arc), and extolling the
spiritual signiﬁcance of the project, Shoghi Effendi (1958: 74–75) wrote that

> The raising of this Edifice will in turn herald the construction, in the
> course of successive epochs of the Formative Age of the Faith, of several
> other structures, which will serve as the administrative seats of such
> divinely appointed institutions as the Guardianship, the Hands of the
Cause, and the Universal House of Justice . . .

This vast and irresistible process, unexampled in the spiritual history
> of mankind, and which will synchronize with two no less significant
> developments – the establishment of the Lesser Peace and the evolution
> of Baha’i national and local institutions – the one outside and the other
> within the Baha’i world – will attain its ﬁnal consummation in the Golden
> Age of the Faith . . . the advent of the Kingdom of the Father repeatedly
> lauded and promised by Jesus Christ.

From statements in the writings of Abdu’l-Baha, many Baha’is had come
to believe that the Lesser Peace would appear around the end of the twentieth
century (Piff and Warburg 2003). This expectation became a matter of some
urgency when the extensive building projects begun in the early 1990s were
proceeding, since Shoghi Effendi had said that these developments and the
Lesser Peace would ‘synchronize’. It was therefore not entirely surprising that
Baha’i World Centre workers were heard to comment, ‘with every stone laid,
forces are being released in the world’, or that ‘whenever we dig into God’s
holy mountain, another old world order institution collapses’ (Piff 2000).

Magic or foresight?
Space prohibits our fully discussing every message posted to the ‘Arc’ thread,
but enough will be quoted to delineate its dynamics and identify the most
important ideas dealt with.2 In particular, the participants struggled with the
possible connection between the completion of the project and developments

Seeking for truth 91

in world affairs. Such causality might be inferred from Shoghi Effendi’s
prediction, and some Talisman participants obviously had difficulties in
reconciling it with their academic background and the Baha’i doctrine of the
harmony of religion and science. On 11 April 1995, a Baha’i academic from
New Zealand initiated the discussion on Talisman:

> A . . . fellow academic currently investigating the writings [has asked,]
> can the Baha’is prove a connection between the establishment of Lesser
> Peace and the completion of the Arc? If so, can we do it now or only in
> hindsight?3

Almost immediately, a Talisman participant, an American academic,
responded:

> In my . . . opinion, there is no connection between the building of the
> Arc and the establishment of the Lesser Peace. Certainly it is true that
> building these building[s] will not and cannot bring about the Lesser
> Peace in some magical way. Baha’is just look ridiculous to thinking
> people when they talk that way.4

Another participant quickly took issue with this view:

> It’s not magic . . . it’s scientifically based (if you want me to go into
> proofs and derivations etc we would have to ﬁrst prove existence of God,
> then of other spiritual worlds etc etc but we would get there . . .) and
> these ‘thinking people’ are not taking into account that there are other
> spiritual worlds that interact with this world . . .5

And another chimed in, agreeing,

> You have said it all! . . . These ‘thinking people’ are part of the problem!
> In fact, it is an essential aspect of Baha’i ‘world view’ – for the lack of a
> better term – that these two worlds (spiritual and material) are intimately
> interrelated and affect each other.6

However, another member, also an academic, responded forcefully:

> Actually, I thought [TL] said it all. The way Baha’is discuss the Arc is
> considered ‘magical’ thinking. The buildings going up on Mt. Carmel
> are viewed by these ‘thinking people’ that some dismiss with a wave of
> a magic wand, as ‘power art,’ an effort to show the power of the Baha’i
Faith and its administration . . .

Alas, the social and economic development plans seem to have lost
out in the process of raising funds for these buildings. I fear that the fact
92 David Piff and Margit Warburg

> that they are sitting in Israel – a country almost universally scorned
> in the world – is going to backfire on the Faith terribly. I wish we
> were putting our resources into human development, rather than into
> marble.7

In the postings quoted thus far one can already observe one of the most
important characteristics of Talisman – its tendency to expose ideological
divisions in the community – in this case between those who, in direct if not
trenchant language, questioned prevalent Baha’i understandings and those
who sought to maintain or defend more mainstream views. Also evident in
the thread, at least in the post quoted just above, is dissatisfaction with the
decisions of Baha’i leadership – here expressed as regret that Baha’is use their
funds to erect monumental administrative buildings rather than to address
human needs and problems more directly. As the Universal House of Justice,
as a matter of Baha’i belief, is viewed as infallible, such a comment was bound
to provoke a reaction.

A follow-up post, directed to LW and copied to Talisman, set out to prove
the validity of Shoghi Effendi’s statement regarding synchronization, and the
Universal House of Justice’s decision to pursue the Mount Carmel project at
this time:

> I’ll try and put it as scientiﬁcally as possible so as to not be considered
too ‘magical’ . . .

Step one . . . through complex calculus and lots of being a thinking
> person one comes to the conclusion that there is a Creator, God, Supreme
Being, Allah.

Step two . . . this ‘God’ must communicate with created beings so
> Manifestations are sent at periods of about every 1,000 years (again
record of history, analogies of sun and mirrors etc etc can prove this).

Step three . . . at this time in history the Manifestation which has
> inaugurated a new Universal Cycle was Baha’u’llah (complex calculus,
Kitab-i-Iqan, Bible proofs, Quran proofs, whatever it takes to prove this).

Step four . . . Baha’u’llah, . . . ordains that a body called the ‘Universal
> House of Justice’ should guide the community of the followers of
> Baha’u’llah (and in a certain sense the world in general). This body has
> ‘conferred infallibility’ and all who follow Baha’u’llah joyfully submit
to the decisions of this Supreme Body.

Step ﬁve . . . This same Supreme Body, in following the instructions
> of Baha’u’llah, . . . the wishes of Abdul Baha and expositions of Shoghi
> Effendi, decide and communicate in a letter of August 31, 1987 that the
> remaining buildings on the Arc are to be completed at this time of history.
> Moreover, this Supreme Body decides that these buildings will be built
in Israel . . . whatever the rest of the world may think about Israel . . .

Shoghi Effendi, whose authority can be derived . . . from the Will of
> Abdul Baha states . . . that there is a synchronization between the
> completion of the Arc, the maturation of LSA’s and the establishment
of the Lesser Peace . . .

Now . . . was there any magic in any of that? Is there any question
about whether the Baha’i world should or should not be doing this?

Thinking people can think what they want . . . but based on the above
> . . . I think the A+ goes to the instructions of the Universal House of
> Justice and expositions of Shoghi Effendi rather than the doubts and
> criticisms of thinking people.8

The following day, the same participant, SP, posted two messages containing
several pages of quotations from Shoghi Effendi’s writings regarding the
Arc and the Lesser Peace. His ﬁrst message began, ‘Assuming we all accept
equations 1–5, perhaps looking directly at the texts could help our con-
sultation on the Arc . . .’9 SP included texts that most Talisman subscribers
presumably knew well and considered authoritative, and interspersed them
with his own comments in which he argued for a connection between the
two ‘variables’.10 The message failed to elicit any direct reply.

Another poster, putting a positive spin on the notion of ‘power art’, stated,
‘There is something powerful about marble – it exudes authority, reverence,
strength, cleanliness, durability, refinement. It is metamorphic beyond its
mere creation.’ He continued, ‘The Arc is God’s metropolis for at least a
thousand years – it is an extremely rare bounty to have a part in its birth.’11
In a separate message, the same individual suggested that ‘the completion
of the buildings by itself is not what is going to bring about the Lesser Peace,
it is the maturation that we must go through to achieve that goal which
is signiﬁcant’.12 Another participant discounted the expressed concern about
the location of the Baha’i World Centre in Israel. ‘In fact,’ he wrote, ‘a
Muslim threw [this] in my face once, accusing the Baha’is of supporting the
Zionist state by sending money there.’ He continued:

> I asked him if he sent money to Mecca. He said he did not, that Saudi
> Arabia took care of the Holy Shrines there. I replied that the . . . money
> we send . . . does not go to the ‘Zionist’ government, but to take care of
our properties.

In short, I say, let it be a teaching tool! We have absolutely nothing
> to be ashamed of regarding what we are doing on the Mountain of
God!

O, and is that mountain magical??? Every pilgrim I’ve talked to
thinks so.13

A great deal of the thread explored the issue of synchronization and
causation. One poster argued that Shoghi Effendi had never intended to

imply a causal connection between events when he wrote that the building
of administrative ediﬁces at the Baha’i World Centre would synchronize with
the Lesser Peace.14 Another wrote that though synchronicity is not under-
stood as a causal connection, ‘can one say . . . this means they are absolutely
coincidental; that there is no connection between them, even a connection
which might exist in the Mind of God?’15 Another remarked, ‘Synchronous
events can occur quite naturally when the same underlying conditions that
foster the occurrence of one also foster the occurrence of the other . . . [A
condition of] relative international stability that could lead to the lesser peace
would also encourage the building of the Arc.’16 Another participant, a
historian, explained in more detail:

> If one believes that a state of Lesser Peace will come in the short term of
> future history; and one believes that Baha’is will build ediﬁces in Haifa
> in the same time frame; then there is nothing illogical in saying that these
> two developments will synchronize while not positing a connection
between them.

Because of the advent of weapons of mass destruction . . . large-scale
> world wars are no longer feasible as rational policy decisions. Thus, the
> Lesser Peace, the peace of Mutually Assured Destruction, is approaching
. . . Shoghi Effendi was keenly aware of the signiﬁcance of Hiroshima.

One could on the other hand predict that in the short term (within 75

> need to build the Arc; this could have been extrapolated from the 10-
year World Crusade itself . . .

There is no rational basis for asserting that the synchronicity of these

be . . . in the minds of Baha’is.

The building of the Arc is well underway, and clearly has some major
> advantages for the international administration of the Faith. But this

fewer local [centres] than we need.

It seems to me that it is legitimate for Baha’is to express a strong
> preference that, once this major building initiative is completed, a couple
> of decades of investment in local communities should be initiated.17

A ﬁnal posting to the thread suggested another solution to the question of
synchronization/causation:

> That processes are synchronous without being causally related (to each
> other or to a common 3rd) is possible [but] not most likely. That erecting
> some buildings in Haifa will cause the world’s peoples to recognize their
interdependence and help to make their politicians ready to effectuate

> that interdependence is not entirely impossible – but very nearly. When

> development keeps pace.18

Interactive seeking for truth
Though in its early stages this thread exposed significant divergences of
opinion in the community, it was possible for a Baha’i to come away from
reading through the entire series of postings satisfied that a problematic
element of the Baha’i worldview had been put into rational perspective: There
was nothing magical at work – Shoghi Effendi, an astute observer of history,
knew the Lesser Peace could not be far off and exploited this insight to
direct the course of the Baha’i community. The Universal House of Justice,
in initiating the construction project on Mount Carmel, had acted in the
same way. At the same time, nothing in the thread ruled out the possibility
that spiritual and material reality were connected. Whatever the reason, the
supreme spiritual authority of the Baha’i community had decided to initiate
the construction work now, almost everyone thought it was a good thing,
and world conditions appeared to foster the undertaking.

Internet threads are artefacts of verbal exchanges performed before largely
silent audiences – Talisman had more than a hundred subscribers at this
time who chose not to participate in the Arc discussion. Some messages
in the thread were addressed to Talisman at large; others were addressed as
responses to particular members and simultaneously copied to the group.
We, of course, know nothing of messages that might have passed privately
between list members but were not copied to the list. As with any electronic
discussion group, reading Talisman was a process of following the course of
several concurrent conversations, and the Arc thread was interspersed with
a number of others that vied for participants’ attention.19

Several of the posts considered here exhibit another noteworthy feature
– formulaic expressions of humility (these have been edited out of the extracts
presented above). For example, TL prefaced his post with the disclaimer, ‘In
my very humble, ﬂawed, imperfect and frequently incorrect opinion . . .’20
SP echoed this when commenting on texts from Shoghi Effendi’s writings,
warning readers that his (SP’s) ‘personal extremely potentially fallible inter-
pretations’ would be marked by asterisks.21 SP also noted parenthetically
that despite his frequent references to ‘equations’ and ‘variables’ he ‘hate[d]
math – can’t you tell!’22 The function of such rhetorical touches was appar-
ently to emphasize the humanity of the poster and, perhaps, soften the force
of an opinion, thus increasing the likelihood that the view put forward would
be accepted. Instances of humour sprinkled throughout the thread probably

served the same function. Such features are not unique to Talisman and
contribute to the social ambience and community feeling of email discussion
groups.

It is, of course, impossible to conclude that the actual participants in this
thread came away convinced. For example, TL and LW, whose postings had
initiated the discussion, posted only a single message each to the thread. We
cannot infer from the postings what their motives were to remain silent; lack
of interest, frustration, or other things to do (other threads to participate in)
may have led them and others to abandon the discussion. Nor were all aspects
covered to the extent that it could be said that a conclusion was reached. In
particular, the suggestion that construction of monumental buildings was
an inappropriate expenditure had not been fully discussed, though one
participant suggested that, following completion of the Mount Carmel build-
ings, it would be appropriate for Baha’is to express a wish for an enhanced
programme of local investment.

Taken together, however, the various postings constituted a well-rounded
exploration of the issue and suggested a resolution that, while unofﬁcial, was
both logical and respectful of the religion’s writings and institutions. In
this, and in its brevity, the thread we have considered here is somewhat
atypical. Many Talisman threads ran on much longer. For example, a thread
on Baha’i teachings regarding the virgin birth of Jesus Christ, a very useful
example of discursive plausibility alignment, ran for over a month (21 January
to 28 February 1996) and, when printed, amounted to seventy-ﬁve single-
spaced pages. Some recurring questions never reached resolution – notably,
that, according to an ordinance of Baha’u’llah, only men and not women are
eligible as members of the Universal House of Justice.

The availability of Baha’i email lists and the facility they provide for
relatively free discussion of any topic has fostered important developments
in the intellectual life of the Baha’i community. In addition, email has per-
mitted creation of a substantial accessible record of the community’s internal
discourse. On Talisman (and, to a signiﬁcant though lesser extent, on other
Baha’i email lists) prevailing community understandings of Baha’i history,
theology, community life, and administrative practice were evaluated and
discussed more thoroughly and frankly at the grass-roots level than had
previously been possible.

A case of plausibility alignment
We suggest that – speaking very broadly and generally – the ‘purview’ of
Talisman – though never deﬁned in these terms – can be interpreted as an
ongoing group exercise in plausibility alignment. The process of plausibility
alignment is continual, as external circumstances are constantly changing,
and necessitates continual adjustment or revision of the group’s ideology (as
the members understand it) to correspond with developments in the world

at large. It occurs in leadership circles as well as at the grass roots and helps
assure that threats to the group’s self-perception arising from such things
as dramatic developments in the daily news, problematic aspects of its own
ideology, or lapses in the conduct of its members can be managed or neutral-
ized. More generally, the process provides a means by which the community
can maintain its collective sense of itself.

Baha’i is a lay religion, governed by elected institutions, and the Baha’i
leaders are elected or appointed from the ranks of the community; they
are not academically trained theologians or religious scholars. Underlying
Baha’i administration is a doctrine referred to as the Covenant, which speci-
fies the leadership succession in the religion, and forbids Baha’is from
organizing opposition to it, on penalty of expulsion from the community.
Many postings to the thread prominently displayed avowals of loyalty and
obedience to the senior Baha’i institutions. The reference to Baha’is ‘joyfully
submitting’ to the decisions of the Universal House of Justice; suggestions
that Baha’is, far from concerning themselves with the wisdom of locating the
projects in Israel, use this fact as part of their teaching message; afﬁrmations
that Mount Carmel is a magical place; expressions of satisfaction at being
able to participate in such a historic undertaking – all contrast sharply with
one participant’s expressed doubts about the project. Indeed, a number of
the posts seem to be a sort of implicit shouting down of a member who had
displayed sentiments considered inappropriate. Over the course of Talisman
there were many instances of this, from both the ‘heterodox’ and ‘orthodox’
wings of the group.

Almost by deﬁnition, the activities on a mailing list such as Talisman are
of a kind that the leadership of a religious community, as stewards of its
public image, would wish to de-emphasize. The Universal House of Justice
has expressed concerns regarding the reach and speed of email, and the risks
it entails, in a number of communications. In a letter to an individual written
on its behalf in 1996 the House of Justice commented,

> In the past, discussions among Baha’is would take place orally among

The quotation illustrates the dilemma for the Universal House of Justice when
a mailing list such as Talisman becomes a prominent discussion forum

unconnected to the Baha’i administration. On the one hand, it is a Baha’i
principle that the individual has the right and duty independently to seek truth.
On the other hand, a group of individuals who collectively seek truth in online
discussions have initiated the kind of conversation that normally takes place
inside the religious organization. As with any other leadership, the House of
Justice could have chosen to endorse the website, and could have appointed
high-ranking Baha’is to participate in the discussion. Had that been done, the
discussion list would have soon lost its exploratory character, participants
would have dropped away and a forum for independent plausibility align-
ment would have been lost to the community. The Universal House of Justice
could also have chosen to ignore the discussion list completely, running the
risk that its influence might increase beyond administrative control, or,
perhaps more likely, that it would become a major source of intra-community
contention. The House of Justice could have ordered that the discussion list
be immediately shut down, or, a less drastic step, could have asked American
Baha’i authorities to put pressure on individual posters to exercise restraint
or self-censorship in expression of their views. This was apparently the course
of action followed, and eventually led to the closing of the list (see Cole
1998).24

The propensity of email discussions to become contentious is well docu-
mented, and Talisman was no exception.25 Put in terms of plausibility
alignment, Talisman participants were unable, in the end, to ﬁnd ways to
adjust a number of critical disjunctures in community opinion, but continued
to argue and explore these difﬁcult issues even after most participants probably
recognized that the discussions were no longer productive.

In its initial phase, Talisman seemed a successful exercise in bypass, in
that free discussion of weighty community issues was facilitated by the
Internet. Initially, the group functioned without interference from Baha’i
institutions. However, the fact that it was closed demonstrates that groups
such as Talisman are not just entities ﬂoating in cyberspace. They also repre-
sent a group of people who are under obligations elsewhere and whose
decisions to contribute to the discussion must take into account the require-
ment that as members of the Baha’i religion they should not ignore serious
advice or instructions from the Baha’i organization. This instance suggests
that the much-heralded bypass opportunity of the Internet may be more of
an ideal construction than a reality in many cases.

The query underlying the particular thread analysed – was it meaningful
to establish a connection between completion of the Mount Carmel project
and the advent of world peace? – brought into focus a number of community
concerns, notably the ongoing desire among Baha’is to bring new converts
into the community, and to reach ‘people of capacity’ with its message.
Reaching thinking people with the Baha’i message is rendered problematic
by Baha’i teachings that appear out of step with contemporary values and
by an ambient supernaturalism that permeates both official and popular

Baha’i. A second important issue is the harmony between science and religion
– that religious teachings are to accord with reason. Some Baha’is have
troubled themselves to disentangle Baha’i teachings both from the extrava-
gances of popular Baha’i culture and from literal understandings of Baha’i
scriptures. The references to ‘magical thinking’, ‘power art’, and Baha’is
looking ‘ridiculous’ reﬂect the vehemence of this effort. But a campaign to
‘correct’ popular understandings is evidently resented by other sections of
the community as potentially dangerous and often arrogant. Several dis-
missive references to ‘thinking people’ illustrated a view that may be phrased
as: Who are these people to question what Shoghi Effendi said or what the
Universal House of Justice decided? One poster made a laboured attempt
to demonstrate the logical derivation of his belief, apparently to prove that
even spiritual realities have a scientiﬁc basis.

A third concern intertwined with the thread is actually a grass-roots version
of the same need that brought about the creation of a professionally designed
ofﬁcial Baha’i website – the imperative for a religious community to make
a good appearance before the world. By hashing out troubling questions
through the give and take of email discourse, participants on Talisman (and
on other Baha’i associated email lists) sought to assure themselves that Baha’i
teachings, properly understood, were not only valid spiritually but harmonious
with rational traditions.

23 Letter to an individual from the Department of the Secretariat, 16 February 1996,

> of self-discipline . . . is needed by those who take part’.
24 Following the demise of Talisman there were several developments in Baha’i-

> List rules explicitly forbade postings critical of the Baha’i administration.

> Baha’i institutions. H-Bahai was initiated for academic discussion of Babi and
> Baha’i topics; membership was generally restricted to individuals with advanced
