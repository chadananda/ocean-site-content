Religion and Evolution Reconciled:
‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s Comments on
Evolution
COUROSH MEHANIAN AND STEPHEN R. FRIBERG

Abstract
The harmony of science and religion is a central teaching of the Bahá’í Faith that
has important implications for the development of society and the emergence of
a global civilization. Science and religion, “the two most potent forces in human
life,” have often been at odds, most notably over evolution and the origins of man.
‘Abdu’l-Bahá has commented at length on evolution and man’s origins, providing
the most extensive exploration of the harmony of science and religion in the
Bahá’í canon. We systematically survey ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s teachings on evolution and
show that He reconciles two viewpoints—evolution and divine creation—that
other thinkers have deemed irremediably in conflict.

Résumé
L’harmonie essentielle entre la science et la religion, un enseignement de base de la
foi bahá’íe, est de grande importance pour l’évolution de la société et l’émergence
d’une civilisation mondiale. Toutefois, la science et la religion ont souvent été mises
en opposition, en particulier en ce qui a trait à l’évolution et à l’origine de l’homme.
‘Abdu’l-Bahá a formulé des commentaires détaillés sur l’évolution et l’origine de
l’homme, fournissant l’exploration la plus approfondie de l’harmonie entre la sci-
ence et la religion que l’on puisse trouver dans les enseignements bahá’ís. L’auteur
passe en revue tous les enseignements d’‘Abdu’l-Bahá concernant l’évolution, et il
montre comment celui-ci réconcilie ces deux points de vue—l’évolution et la créa-
tion divine—que d’autres penseurs estimaient à tout jamais inconciliables.

Resumen
La harmonía de la ciencia y la religión es una enseñanza clave de la Fe Bahá’í que

56             The Journal of Bahá’í Studies 13. 1/4. 2003

entraña implicaciones importantes para el desarrollo de la sociedad y el surgi-
miento de una civilización global. La ciencia y la religión, sin embargo, no pocas
veces han estado en desacuerdo, marcadamente acerca de la evolución y los orí-
genes del hombre. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá ha comentado detalladamente sobre este tema,
proporcionándonos una investigación a fondo acerca de la harmonía entre la cien-
cia y la religión en el canon bahá’í. En forma sistemática contemplamos las
enseñanzas de ‘Abdu’l-Bahá sobre la evolución y demostramos como Él empareja
dos puntos de vista, la evolución y la creación divina, supuestamente en conflicto
irremediable según otros pensadores.

INTRODUCTION

Science is extraordinarily successful at explaining the world, unceasingly
producing new knowledge and updating older understandings. Among its
fruits are marvelous and powerful technologies: world-embracing com-
munications, sophisticated computers, and life-enhancing medical tech-
nologies are but examples. The powerful impact of these technologies,
combined with the multiple successes of science in explaining natural and
human phenomena, has led to the widespread view that science—not, as
once was held, religion—is our primary source of reliable knowledge. Not
surprisingly, ideas derived from science have clashed with ideas derived
from religion.

The most visible of the clashes between scientific and religious ideas
concerns evolution and the origins of man. This conflict started to take
definite shape after the publication of Darwin’s famous Origin of Species in
1859 in Europe and the United States. By the time of the Scopes “monkey
trial” of 1925, it had hardened into a polarized standoff between evolu-
tionism and creationism. At issue were specific questions about human
origins as well as broader questions about the validity of religion in a
scientific age. Were human beings created by God or by evolutionary
processes? Is scientific knowledge or revealed knowledge the truest knowl-
edge? W hat is the role of revealed truth? Conflict over these questions
continues unabated to this day.
A consequence of the clash of scientific and religious ideas about evolution

Religion and Evolution Reconciled                     57

is the widespread belief that science and religion themselves are neces-
sarily in conflict. True or not, this belief has had significant consequences.
The loss of the moderating influence of thinkers familiar with science and
its methods, for example, has led many religious groups to adopt certain
ideas regardless of their rationality, increasing the component of super-
stition and myth in their religious systems. Distrust of the moral and
ethical perspectives inculcated by religion has made it easier for scientists
to embrace ideologies—for example, social Darwinism and eugenics—
that have contributed to the horrors of the totalitarianisms of the twenti-
eth century. Fortunately, these and other negative consequences of the
clash between science and religion have been widely recognized, and many
scientists and religionists are now calling for an updated assessment of
the relationship between science and religion.1

The harmony of science and religion is a central tenet of the Bahá’í
teachings. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá explained the Bahá’í view thus: “Religion and sci-
ence are the two wings upon which man’s intelligence can soar into the
heights, with which the human soul can progress” (Paris Talks 143).
Rejecting the view that science and religion are in conflict, Shoghi Effendi
describes them as “the two most potent forces in human life” (World Order
204). Religion, he says, “must go hand-in-hand with science.”2 The task
facing humanity, the Universal House of Justice has written, “is to create
a global civilization which embodies both the spiritual and material
dimensions of existence.” This can only be accomplished by “a progressive
interaction between the truths and principles of religion and the discov-
eries and insights of scientific inquiry.”3

How do the Bahá’í teachings resolve the seeming conflicts between evo-
lution and the widely shared religious doctrine of divine creation? In this
article, we address this question by surveying ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s extensive
comments on evolution and the origins of man. Addressed primarily to
educated Western audiences in the first two decades of the twentieth cen-
tury, these comments provide the fullest and most sustained discussion of
the relationship between science and religion in the Bahá’í Writings. We
show that ‘Abdu’l-Bahá describes the human species as coming into being
by developmental processes that are consistent with the mechanisms of

58            The Journal of Bahá’í Studies 13. 1/4. 2003

scientific evolution and, further, that these processes are the working out
of the divine creative impulse. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá thus reconciles two perspec-
tives—evolution and divine creation—that many modern thinkers have
deemed irremediably in conflict.

‘ABDU’L-BAHÁ’S COMMENTS ON EVOLUTION

‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s comments on evolution may be found mainly in Some
Answered Questions, Paris Talks, and The Promulgation of Universal Peace.
The first is a compilation of notes of His table talks with pilgrims in the
Holy Land; the latter two are compendiums of His addresses delivered in
the early part of this century in Paris and America, respectively.4 The
majority of His comments touch on issues that, although contemporary to
His time, still command great interest. They span a number of inter-
related themes and resist simple categorization.

It should be mentioned that the transcriptions of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s talks
do not all enjoy the same degree of authenticity. Thus, care is required
when drawing conclusions based solely on these works. To fully under-
stand ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s comments on evolution, it is important to take into
account the many different topics they contain and their context in the
body of the Bahá’í teachings. Shoghi Effendi has cautioned that statements
by ‘Abdu’l-Bahá on evolution “must be taken in conjunction with all the
Bahá’í teachings,” emphasizing that “we cannot get a correct picture by
concentrating on just one phrase” (Arohanui 85–86). In this article, we
explore some of the major themes that run through His comments on
evolution.5 We group them under nine topical headings:

> 1. Creation is perfect
> 2. Nature has no conscious intelligence
> 3. Life evolved gradually from a sole origin
> 4. Diversity is necessary
> 5. Man has progressed through stages
> 6. Man is a distinct species, not an animal
7. Man is a composition of elements that attracts the human spirit

Religion and Evolution Reconciled                    59

> 8. Evolution is governed by law
> 9. Man is a necessary part of existence

In the following, we look at each of these topics in detail. Throughout, we
use the terms “man” and “human” interchangeably in their non-gender-
specific sense.

1\. CREATION IS PERFECT

A central foundation of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s teachings on evolution is an affir-
mation of the perfection of creation:

> When man . . . . sees the state, the organization and the perfection of
> the world, he will be convinced that in the possible world there is
> nothing more wonderful than that which already exists. . . . [T]he uni-
> verse has no imperfection, so that if all beings became pure intelli-
> gence and reflected for ever and ever, it is impossible that they could
> imagine anything better than that which exists. (Some Answered
> Questions 177)

When we carefully investigate the kingdoms of existence and
> observe the phenomena of the universe about us, we discover the
> absolute order and perfection of creation. The dull minerals in their
> affinities, plants and vegetables with power of growth, animals in
> their instinct, man with conscious intellect and the heavenly orbs
> moving obediently through limitless space are all found subject to
> universal law, most complete, most perfect. (Promulgation 79)

‘Abdu’l-Bahá compares the universe to the human body; if the chief
member of the human body, the brain and the mind, were missing, it
would be imperfect:

> [I]f we imagine a time when man belonged to the animal world, or
> when he was merely an animal, we shall find that existence would
60            The Journal of Bahá’í Studies 13. 1/4. 2003

> have been imperfect—that is to say, there would have been no man,
> and this chief member, which in the body of the world is like the
> brain and mind in man, would have been missing. The world would
> then have been quite imperfect. It is thus proved that if there had been
> a time when man was in the animal kingdom, the perfection of exis-
> tence would have been destroyed; for man is the greatest member of
> this world, and if the body was without this chief member, surely it
> would be imperfect. (Some Answered Questions 178)

If, however, the creation in the past had not been adorned with
> utmost perfection, then existence would have been imperfect and
> meaningless, and in this case creation would have been incomplete.

(Some Answered Questions 177)

A universe without man, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá asserts, would be incomplete and
therefore meaningless. This implies that human existence is an essential
part of creation.

‘Abdu’l-Bahá did not elaborate on the physical mechanisms by which
creation gave rise to man. Recent scientific findings have led some scien-
tists to the conclusion that our existence is critically dependent on the
exact form of the laws of nature.6 The laws of physics and the funda-
mental constants of nature are delicately balanced in such a way that per-
mits stars and galaxies to form. Furthermore, the basic building blocks of
life—hydrogen, carbon, oxygen, water, and so on—have chemical and
physical properties that appear to be finely tuned to enable the evolution
of complex life forms. The physicist Paul Davies summarizes this per-
spective as follows: “It almost looks as if the structure of the universe and
the laws of physics have been deliberately adjusted in order to lead to the
emergence of life and consciousness” (Are We Alone? 118). This point of
view is consistent with ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s claim that the universe is perfect,
and that humanity is a central part of that perfection.

2\. NATURE HAS NO CONSCIOUS INTELLIGENCE

Despite the order and perfections evident in the universe, nature lacks

Religion and Evolution Reconciled                           61

conscious intelligence. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá tells us: “Nature is subjected to an
absolute organization, to determined laws, to a complete order and a fin-
ished design, from which it will never depart. . . . But when you look at
Nature itself, you see that it has no intelligence, no will” (Some Answered
Questions 3).

This can readily be illustrated:

> For instance, the nature of fire is to burn; it burns without will or
> intelligence. The nature of water is fluidity; it flows without will or
> intelligence. The nature of the sun is radiance; it shines without will
> or intelligence. The nature of vapor is to ascend; it ascends without
> will or intelligence. Thus it is clear that the natural movements of all
> things are compelled; there are no voluntary movements except those
> of animals and, above all, those of man. (Some Answered Questions 3)

While nature lacks consciousness, humans do not: “Man is intelligent,
instinctively and consciously intelligent; nature is not. Man is fortified
with memory; nature does not possess it. Man is the discoverer of the
mysteries of nature; nature is not conscious of those mysteries herself ”
(Promulgation 81).

The Darwinian model of evolution similarly assigns no intelligence to
nature. For example, Richard Dawkins, in The Blind Watchmaker, explains
how unintelligent forces operating over long periods give rise to organ-
isms of unimaginable complexity and marvelous design. The distinction
is that Dawkins (and others who believe as he does) sees the marvelous
complexity that is intrinsic to life and consciousness as created entirely by
unintelligent processes, whereas ‘Abdu’l-Bahá describes both nature and
consciousness as products of the same cause. This cause, He says, must
possess greater intelligence than its consequences.

3\. LIFE EVOLVED GRADUALLY FROM A SOLE ORIGIN

A cornerstone of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s teachings on evolution is His affirmation of
a single origin of life: “the origin of all material life is one. . . .” (Promulgation
350).

62            The Journal of Bahá’í Studies 13. 1/4. 2003

From this sole origin, the diversity of life was produced: “Consider the
world of created beings, how varied and diverse they are in species, yet
with one sole origin” (Paris Talks 51–52).

> [T]here is no doubt that in the beginning the origin was one: the origin
> of all numbers is one and not two. Then it is evident that in the begin-
> ning matter was one, and that one matter appeared in different aspects
> in each element. Thus various forms were produced, and these various
> aspects as they were produced became permanent, and each element was
> specialized. But this permanence was not definite, and did not attain
> realization and perfect existence until after a very long time. Then these
> elements became composed, and organized and combined in infinite
> forms; or rather from the composition and combination of these ele-
> ments innumerable beings appeared. (Some Answered Questions 181)

‘Abdu’l-Bahá describes the development of complex entities as a slow,
gradual process: “the growth and development of all beings is gradual;
this is the universal divine organization and the natural system. The seed
does not at once become a tree; the embryo does not at once become a
man; the mineral does not suddenly become a stone. No, they grow and
develop gradually and attain the limit of perfection” (Some Answered
Questions 198–99).

Thus, according to ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, life on earth is extremely old: “life on
this earth is very ancient. It is not one hundred thousand, or two hundred
thousand, or one million or two million years old; it is very ancient. . . .”
(Some Answered Questions 160).

These teachings are in harmony with the conclusions of the evolution-
ary sciences that life originated approximately 3.8 billion years ago from a
single bacterial form, as evidenced by the common biochemical foundation
of all life on earth.

4\. DIVERSITY IS NECESSARY

The theory of evolution as developed by Darwin placed a strong emphasis

Religion and Evolution Reconciled                       63

on the role of competition. Since Darwin’s time, the interdependence of
the different components—both animate and inanimate—in a habitat has
been recognized as playing an equally important role. Evolution takes
place in ecosystems that are complex webs of interactions between plants,
animals, geography, bacteria, weather patterns, and other phenomena (see
Lewontin). ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s comments on evolution strongly emphasize the
importance of interdependence:

> For all beings are connected together like a chain; and reciprocal help,
> assistance and interaction belonging to the properties of things are
> the causes of the existence, development and growth of created
> beings. It is confirmed through evidences and proofs that every being
> universally acts upon other beings, either absolutely or through asso-
> ciation. (Some Answered Questions 178–79)

Cooperation and reciprocity are intrinsic components of the created
world, according to ‘Abdu’l-Bahá:

Consider for instance how one group of created things constituteth
> the vegetable kingdom, and another the animal kingdom. Each of
> these two maketh use of certain elements in the air on which its own
> life dependeth, while each increaseth the quantity of such elements as
> are essential for the life of the other. . . . . co-operation and reciproc-
> ity are essential properties which are inherent in the unified system
> of the world of existence, and without which the entire creation
> would be reduced to nothingness. (Huqúq’u’lláh 21)

This passage calls to mind modern ideas about the dynamics of ecosys-
tems and the modern evolutionary biological concepts of cooperation and
altruism.7

‘Abdu’l-Bahá emphasizes that diversity is a necessary condition for the
order and perfection of the whole universe:

Know that the order and the perfection of the whole universe require
64            The Journal of Bahá’í Studies 13. 1/4. 2003

> that existence should appear in numberless forms. For existing
> beings could not be embodied in only one degree, one station, one
> kind, one species and one class; undoubtedly, the difference of degrees
> and distinction of forms, and the variety of genus and species, are
> necessary—that is to say, the degree of mineral, vegetable, animal
> substances, and of man, are inevitable; for the world could not be
> arranged, adorned, organized and perfected with man alone. In the
> same way, with only animals, only plants or only minerals, this world
> could not show forth beautiful scenery, exact organization and
> exquisite adornment. Without doubt it is because of the varieties of
> degrees, stations, species and classes that existence becomes resplen-
> dent with utmost perfection. (Some Answered Questions 129)

5\. MAN HAS PROGRESSED THROUGH STAGES

‘Abdu’l-Bahá compares the evolution of man to the growth of an embryo
into an adult. Man did not appear all at once but developed gradually: “it
is evident and confirmed that the development and growth of man on this
earth, until he reached his present perfection, resembled the growth and
development of the embryo in the womb of the mother: by degrees it
passed from condition to condition, from form to form, from one shape to
another. . . .” (Some Answered Questions 183). There are different stages in
the evolution of man:

> [M]an, in the beginning of his existence and in the womb of the
> earth, like the embryo in the womb of the mother, gradually grew
> and developed, and passed from one form to another, from one shape
> to another, until he appeared with this beauty and perfection, this
> force and this power. It is certain that in the beginning he had not this
> loveliness and grace and elegance, and that he only by degrees
> attained this shape, this form, this beauty and this grace. (Some
> Answered Questions 183)

In each stage (degree) of his development, man acquired new virtues:

In the world of existence man has traversed successive degrees
> until he has attained the human kingdom. In each degree of his pro-
> gression he has developed capacity for advancement to the next sta-
> tion and condition. While in the kingdom of the mineral he was
> attaining the capacity for promotion into the degree of the vegetable.
> In the kingdom of the vegetable he underwent preparation for the
> world of the animal, and from thence he has come onward to the
> human degree, or kingdom. Throughout this journey of progression
> he has ever and always been potentially man. (Promulgation 225)

In every stage of existence through which he progressed—mineral, veg-
etable, and animal—man was potentially man. Potentiality, as we will see,
is a key concept in ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s discussion of evolution.

6\. MAN IS A DISTINCT SPECIES, NOT AN ANIMAL

According to ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, man progressed through many stages before
attaining his present form. But always, he was potentially human. That he
passed through an animal stage does not mean he is an animal:

> But at all times, even when the embryo resembled a worm, it was
> human in potentiality and character, not animal. The forms assumed
> by the human embryo in its successive changes do not prove that it is
> animal in its essential character. Throughout this progression there
> has been a transference of type, a conservation of species or kind.
> Realizing this we may acknowledge the fact that at one time man was
> an inmate of the sea, at another period an invertebrate, then a verte-
> brate and finally a human being standing erect. Though we admit
> these changes, we cannot say man is an animal. In each one of these
> stages are signs and evidences of his human existence and destina-
> tion. (Promulgation 358)

It may seem that ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s comments differ from the standard
Darwinian picture of human evolution. In the latter picture, Homo sapiens

66            The Journal of Bahá’í Studies 13. 1/4. 2003

is considered to be one species which, along with the great apes—chim-
panzees, gorillas, and orangutans—evolved from a common ancestor liv-
ing in Africa some five to ten million years ago. This common ancestry is
often said to imply that man is an animal. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá rejects this inter-
pretation, saying that man is a distinct “species.” However, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá is
not using the word species in the modern taxonomic or biological sense.
Rather, He is using it with the implication of “kind” or “category.”8 With
this meaning in mind, we further examine ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s statements
about human nature and origins.

‘Abdu’l-Bahá likens the development of human beings to the growth of
an embryo in the mother’s womb to emphasize that the evolution of man
through different stages does not bind him to any of those stages:

To recapitulate: as man in the womb of the mother passes from
> form to form, from shape to shape, changes and develops, and is still
> the human species from the beginning of the embryonic period—in
> the same way man, from the beginning of his existence in the matrix
> of the world, is also a distinct species—that is, man—and has gradu-
> ally evolved from one form to another. (Some Answered Questions
> 193–94)

Although he evolved through many stages, man was always distinctly
man, a unique species: “man’s existence on this earth, from the beginning
until it reaches this state, form and condition, necessarily lasts a long time,
and goes through many degrees until it reaches this condition. But from
the beginning of man’s existence he is a distinct species. . . . Man was
always a distinct species, a man, not an animal” (Some Answered Questions
184). “Therefore, this change of appearance, this evolution of members,
this development and growth, even though we admit the reality of
growth and progress, does not prevent the species from being original.”
(Some Answered Questions 194)

What makes man unique, according to ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, is his intellectual
endowment, not his physical makeup.9 He urges us to understand man’s

reality not by focusing on his physical connection with the animal king-
dom, but rather by considering his spiritual nature. It is wrong, He repeat-
edly emphasizes, to assume that man’s physical body makes him merely an
animal: “Man is not man simply because of bodily attributes. The stan-
dard of divine measure and judgment is his intelligence and spirit”
(Promulgation 184). “Again, there are men whose eyes are only open to
physical progress and to the evolution in the world of matter. These men
prefer to study the resemblance between their own physical body and that
of the ape, rather than to contemplate the glorious affiliation between
their spirit and that of God. This is indeed strange, for it is only physi-
cally that man resembles the lower creation, with regard to his intellect he
is totally unlike it” (Paris Talks 71). “The reality of man is his thought, not
his material body. The thought force and the animal force are partners.
Although man is part of the animal creation, he possesses a power of
thought superior to all other created beings” (Paris Talks 17).

‘Abdu’l-Bahá does not deny what humans have in common with the ani-
mal world. Rather, He denies that their animal characteristics comprise
their entire nature. According to ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, human beings are on a dif-
ferent plane than the animal because of their spiritual and intellectual
powers, powers that are evidenced by the sciences, the arts, and human
inventions. “Though man has powers and outer senses in common with
the animal, yet an extraordinary power exists in him of which the animal
is bereft. The sciences, arts, inventions, trades and discoveries of realities
are the results of this spiritual power” (Some Answered Questions 186).
Further elaborating on the differences between humans and the rest of
living things, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá explains: “Man is endowed with ideal
virtues—for example, intellection, volition, faith, confession and acknowl-
edgment of God—while nature is devoid of all these. The ideal faculties
of man, including the capacity for scientific acquisition, are beyond
nature’s ken. These are powers whereby man is differentiated and distin-
guished from all other forms of life” (Promulgation 51).

‘Abdu’l-Bahá collectively calls the human powers which distinguish man
from the animal the spirit of man: “The animal is the captive of the sens-
es and bound by them; all that is beyond the senses, the things that they do

68            The Journal of Bahá’í Studies 13. 1/4. 2003

not control, the animal can never understand, although in the outer senses
it is greater than man. Hence it is proved and verified that in man there is
a power of discovery by which he is distinguished from the animals, and
this is the spirit of man” (Some Answered Questions 188). The evidence for
the spirit of man lies in its visible signs:

> There is no doubt that from its effects you prove that in the animal
> there is a power which is not in the plant, and this is the power of the
> senses—that is to say, sight, hearing and also other powers; from
> these you infer that there is an animal spirit. In the same way, from
> the proofs and signs we have mentioned, we argue that there is a
> human spirit. Since in the animal there are signs which are not in the
> plant, you say this power of sensation is a property of the animal
> spirit; you also see in man signs, powers and perfections which do not
> exist in the animal; therefore, you infer that there is a power in him
> which the animal is without. (Some Answered Questions 189–90)

Man differs from the animals, possessing mental and spiritual capacities
that animals lack. In a similar way, animals differ from the plants, pos-
sessing the power of movement and senses that plants lack. Paleo-
anthropologist Ian Tattersall comments on this difference when he writes
“that with the arrival of behaviorally modern Homo sapiens, a totally
unprecedented entity had appeared on Earth” (188). Man’s mental and
spiritual capacities make him a distinct species.

7\. MAN IS A COMPOSITION OF ELEMENTS THAT ATTRACTS THE HUMAN
SPIRIT

‘Abdu’l-Bahá asserts that man’s perfections—his powers—result from a
measured and balanced combination of elements:

[A]ll these endless beings which inhabit the world, whether man,
> animal, vegetable, mineral—whatever they may be—are surely, each one
of them, composed of elements. . . . [T]he perfection of each individual

> being—that is to say, the perfection which you now see in man or apart
> from him, with regard to their atoms, members or powers—is due to
> the composition of the elements, to their measure, to their balance, to
> the mode of their combination, and to mutual influence. When all
> these are gathered together, then man exists. (Some Answered Questions
> 178–79)

When the appropriate combination of elements appears, the human spirit
is attracted to it:

Moreover, these members, these elements, this composition, which
> are found in the organism of man, are an attraction and magnet for
> the spirit; it is certain that the spirit will appear in it. . . . [W]hen these
> existing elements are gathered together according to the natural
> order, and with perfect strength, they become a magnet for the spir-
> it, and the spirit will become manifest in them with all its perfections.

(Some Answered Questions 201)

Lest this statement be construed materialistically, it should be pointed
out that according to ‘Abdu’l-Bahá the human spirit does not depend for
its existence on the body. He states: “The spirit is independent of the body,
and in relation to it the spirit is an essential preexistence” (Some Answered
Questions 280). He emphasizes: “The spirit does not need a body, but the
body needs spirit, or it cannot live. The soul can live without a body, but
the body without a soul dies” (Paris Talks 86–7). He further expands: “The
life of the spirit is neither conditional nor dependent upon the life of the
body. At most it can be said that the body is a mere garment utilized by
the spirit. If that garment be destroyed, the wearer is not affected but is,
in fact, protected” (Promulgation 259). ‘Abdu’l-Bahá affirms that the human
soul has a beginning, but has no end: “Know that, although the human
soul has existed on the earth for prolonged times and ages, yet it is phe-
nomenal. As it is a divine sign, when once it has come into existence, it is
eternal. The spirit of man has a beginning, but it has no end; it continues
eternally” (Some Answered Questions 151).10

The human soul is associated with the body but continues to exist after
the body disintegrates:

The human spirit may be likened to the bounty of the sun shining on
> a mirror. The body of man, which is composed from the elements, is
> combined and mingled in the most perfect form; it is the most solid
> construction, the noblest combination, the most perfect existence. It
> grows and develops through the animal spirit. This perfected body can
> be compared to a mirror, and the human spirit to the sun. Nevertheless,
> if the mirror breaks, the bounty of the sun continues; and if the mirror
> is destroyed or ceases to exist, no harm will happen to the bounty of
> the sun, which is everlasting. (Some Answered Questions 143–44)

8\. EVOLUTION IS GOVERNED BY LAW

‘Abdu’l-Bahá asserts that natural laws regulate all physical phenomena:
“The phenomenal world is entirely subject to the rule and control of nat-
ural law” (Promulgation 17). These laws are so comprehensive that nature
is bound by them: “Nature is subjected to an absolute organization, to
determined laws, to a complete order and a finished design, from which it
will never depart. . . .” (Some Answered Questions 3). In particular, ‘Abdu’l-
Bahá states that these laws apply to the evolution of living things:

Similarly, the terrestrial globe from the beginning was created with
> all its elements, substances, minerals, atoms and organisms; but these
> only appeared by degrees: first the mineral, then the plant, afterward
> the animal, and finally man. But from the first these kinds and species
> existed, but were undeveloped in the terrestrial globe, and then
> appeared only gradually. For the supreme organization of God, and the
> universal natural system, surround all beings, and all are subject to
> this rule. When you consider this universal system, you see that there
> is not one of the beings which at its coming into existence has reached
> the limit of perfection. No, they gradually grow and develop, and then
attain the degree of perfection. (Some Answered Questions 199)

All beings, whether large or small, were created perfect and com-
> plete from the first, but their perfections appear in them by degrees.
> The organization of God is one; the evolution of existence is one; the
> divine system is one. Whether they be small or great beings, all are
> subject to one law and system. (Some Answered Questions 199)

Having established that evolution is governed by universal law, ‘Abdu’l-
Bahá states that the composition of elements responsible for the appear-
ance of beings is not a chance process:

> [I]t is evident that in the beginning matter was one, and that one mat-
> ter appeared in different aspects in each element. . . . Then these ele-
> ments became composed, and organized and combined in infinite
> forms; or rather from the composition and combination of these ele-
ments innumerable beings appeared.

This composition and arrangement, through the wisdom of God
> and His preexistent might, were produced from one natural organi-
> zation, which was composed and combined with the greatest
> strength, conformable to wisdom, and according to a universal law.
> From this it is evident that it is the creation of God, and is not a for-
> tuitous composition and arrangement. (Some Answered Questions 181)

In accordance with this natural organization—this universal law—the
mature properties of things are not evident at the beginning. Rather, they
appear gradually. According to ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, man’s essential qualities—
mind and spirit—emerged from this same gradual process. He invokes the
analogies of the embryo and the seed:

> [T]he formation of man in the matrix of the world was in the begin-
> ning like the embryo; then gradually he made progress in perfectness,
> and grew and developed until he reached the state of maturity, when
> the mind and spirit became visible in the greatest power. In the begin-
> ning of his formation the mind and spirit also existed, but they were
> hidden; later they were manifested. . . . So it is that in the seed the tree
72            The Journal of Bahá’í Studies 13. 1/4. 2003

> exists, but it is hidden and concealed; when it develops and grows, the
> complete tree appears. (Some Answered Questions 198)

Central to these analogies is the concept of potentiality. Seed-like
growth and embryonic development bring into reality the potentialities
inherent in their respective DNA structures. The potentiality of human
existence is embedded in the laws of the universe. Man existed from the
beginning, but his physical appearance is a gradual process.

9\. MAN IS A NECESSARY PART OF EXISTENCE

‘Abdu’l-Bahá asserts that the universe requires human existence: “One of
the things which has appeared in the world of existence, and which is one
of the requirements of Nature, is human life” (Some Answered Questions 4).
The purpose of human existence in the universe is the appearance of
divine perfections: “[W]e . . . have also proved logically that man exists
from his origin and foundation as man, and that his species has existed
from all eternity, now we will establish spiritual proofs that human exis-
tence—that is, the species of man—is a necessary existence, and that
without man the perfections of Divinity would not appear” (Some Answered
Questions 195). “If man did not exist, the universe would be without result,
for the object of existence is the appearance of the perfections of God”
(Some Answered Questions 196). ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s intent is not that we simply
consider our own planet, but the whole of existence:11 “Therefore, it can-
not be said there was a time when man was not. All that we can say is that
this terrestrial globe at one time did not exist, and at its beginning man
did not appear upon it. . . . Therefore, it cannot be imagined that the
worlds of existence, whether the stars or this earth, were once inhabited
by the donkey, cow, mouse and cat, and that they were without man!”
(Some Answered Questions 197).

According to ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, the reality that humans embody—mind and
spirit—is necessarily present in the world:

[I]t is necessary that the signs of the perfection of the spirit should

> be apparent in this world, so that the world of creation may bring
> forth endless results, and this body may receive life and manifest the
> divine bounties. . . . [I]f the perfections of the spirit did not appear in
> this world, this world would be unenlightened and absolutely brutal.
> By the appearance of the spirit in the physical form, this world is
> enlightened. As the spirit of man is the cause of the life of the body,
> so the world is in the condition of the body, and man is in the condi-
> tion of the spirit. If there were no man, the perfections of the spirit
> would not appear, and the light of the mind would not be resplendent
> in this world. This world would be like a body without a soul. (Some
> Answered Questions 200–1)

The appearance of human consciousness is assured because it is woven
into the fabric of the universe at the deepest level—that of its laws.

This outline of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s comments on evolution, while not
exhaustive, covers many of the major themes in His comments and pro-
vides an overview of His approach, an approach that resolves the appar-
ent differences between science and religion at one of its most contentious
dividing points.

SCIENCE AND RELIGION

We have systematically explored ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s teachings on evolution
and can summarize them succinctly: The process of evolution operates
according to universal law and its outcome is the appearance of the
human spirit—and divine perfections. Before looking at some of the impli-
cations of these teachings, we first briefly describe the current conflict
between science and religion over issues pertaining to human evolution.
We then outline the Bahá’í perspective on the harmony of science and
religion.

CONFLICTING VIEWS OF HUMAN ORIGINS

The tension between science and religion over human origins has its roots

74            The Journal of Bahá’í Studies 13. 1/4. 2003

in conflicting views of how man was created. According to European tra-
dition (and cultural traditions strongly influenced by monotheistic reli-
gion), man was created—designed—by God. The traditional view is con-
veyed very effectively by William Paley’s argument from design. In his
1828 book Natural Theology, Paley argues that the complexity and perfec-
tion of living creatures proves the existence of God. Consider a person
walking across a heath. If he discovers a watch with its intricate machin-
ery lying on the ground, he would conclude that the watch had an intelli-
gent maker. Similarly, an observer aware of the intricate workings of
nature would conclude that an intelligent maker—God—fashioned living
things.

Darwin’s theory of evolution, in the eyes of many scientists and reli-
gionists, contradicts the view that God designed man. These scientists,
especially biologists, have argued that there is no need to postulate the
existence of an intelligent maker. Evolutionary theories, they argue, pro-
vide simple, broad, and fully adequate explanations of the intricate
machinery of life in purely material terms. The blind forces of nature, they
hold, are responsible for biological complexity. If the blind forces of
nature can explain the intricate workings of the natural world, then there
is no evidence of an intelligent maker. It follows, according to many, that
there is no compelling reason for belief in God.12 Stephen Jay Gould, for
example, has argued that the emergence of man is accidental, a result of
blind forces interacting with historical contingencies. He views the evolu-
tion of humans as an unlikely event and the appearance of intelligence
singularly improbable:

> Wind back the tape of life to the origin of the modern multicellular
> animals in the Cambrian explosion, let the tape play again from this
> identical starting point, and the replay will populate the earth . . . with
> a radically different set of creatures. The chance that this alternative
> set will contain anything remotely like a human being must be effec-
> tively nil, while the probability of any kind of creature endowed with
self-consciousness must also be extremely small.13 (Full House 214)

Suppose we accept that humans and their self-consciousness are simply
the products of evolutionary processes driven by random chance. It might
then seem logical to conclude that an intelligent maker did not create man
and that man has no purpose. “The human species,” according to one such
conclusion, “was not designed, has no purpose, and is the product of mere
mechanical mechanisms” (Futumya 12–13).

Clearly, Darwin’s theory of evolution strongly challenged traditional
European religious beliefs about God and the origins of man. The back-
lash to this challenge has been the emergence of religious movements,
usually Christian, that oppose Darwinian evolutionary theories and that
frequently promote a literal interpretation of the Biblical creation story.
This movement—creationism—encompasses a variety of views with the
common theme that Darwinian evolution cannot be correct. Creationists
believe their views on human origins to have the backing of sacred scrip-
ture and therefore to be superior to evolutionary theory.14 Creationism
has fanned the flames of conflict between science and religion and has lent
widespread credence to the belief that religion is inherently irrational. As
we will see in the following sections, the Bahá’í Writings advocate a dif-
ferent approach.

SCIENCE AND RELIGION IN THE BAHÁ’Í TEACHINGS

Science and religion, according to the Bahá’í Writings, are “the two most
potent forces in human life” (Shoghi Effendi, World Order 204). A central
principle of the Bahá’í teachings is that religion must conform to science
and reason. True religion and science must agree. This central principle
of the Bahá’í Faith has numerous facets, many of which are interrelated.
‘Abdu’l-Bahá often conveys these themes together in His Writings and
utterances. We quote several comments from ‘Abdu’l-Bahá in support of
this central principle.

‘Abdu’l-Bahá asserts that science and religion cannot be opposed because
they are aspects of the same truth, while at the same time affirming that
reasoning powers are required to understand the truths of religion:

76            The Journal of Bahá’í Studies 13. 1/4. 2003

> It is impossible for religion to be contrary to science . . . God made
> religion and science to be the measure, as it were, of our understand-
> ing. . . . To him who has the power of comprehension religion is like
> an open book, but how can it be possible for a man devoid of reason
> and intellectuality to understand the Divine Realities of God? Put all
> your beliefs into harmony with science; there can be no opposition, for
> truth is one. (Paris Talks 145–46)

He emphasizes that science and religion are aspects of the same reality:
“Religion must stand the analysis of reason. It must agree with scientific
fact and proof so that science will sanction religion and religion fortify
science. Both are indissolubly welded and joined in reality” (Promulgation
175). He further declares that religious beliefs must accord with the intel-
lect and the power of reason, otherwise they are merely superstition:

> Every religion which is not in accordance with established science is
> superstition. Religion must be reasonable. If it does not square with
> reason, it is superstition and without foundation. . . . God has
> endowed man with reason that he may perceive what is true. If we
> insist that such and such a subject is not to be reasoned out and test-
> ed according to the established logical modes of the intellect, what is
> the use of the reason which God has given man? . . . It is evident that
> within the human organism the intellect occupies the supreme sta-
> tion. Therefore, if religious belief, principle or creed is not in accor-
> dance with the intellect and the power of reason, it is surely super-
> stition. (Promulgation 63–64)

‘Abdu’l-Bahá ascribes the majority of the blame for the rift between sci-
ence and religion to religious claims to superior authority: “Between sci-
entists and the followers of religion there has always been controversy
and strife for the reason that the latter have proclaimed religion superior
in authority to science and considered scientific announcement opposed to
the teachings of religion” (Promulgation 231). Religious claims to author-
ity often create conflict between religious sects. One consequence of this

conflict has been to convince many that religion is irrational and not rec-
oncilable with science:

Many religious leaders have grown to think that the importance of
> religion lies mainly in the adherence to a collection of certain dogmas
and the practice of rites and ceremonies. . . .

Now, these forms and rituals differ in the various churches and
> amongst the different sects, and even contradict one another; giving
> rise to discord, hatred, and disunion. The outcome of all this dissen-
> sion is the belief of many cultured men that religion and science are
> contradictory terms, that religion needs no powers of reflection, and
> should in no wise be regulated by science, but must of necessity be
> opposed, the one to the other. The unfortunate effect of this is that
> science has drifted apart from religion, and religion has become a
> mere blind and more or less apathetic following of the precepts of
> certain religious teachers, who insist on their own favourite dogmas
> being accepted even when they are contrary to science. (Paris Talks
> 143–44)

‘Abdu’l-Bahá states: “There is no contradiction between true religion
and science” (Paris Talks 141). He pronounces those who hold religion to
be opposed to science as failing to distinguish between true and false reli-
gion and true and false science:

> Any religious belief which is not conformable with scientific proof
> and investigation is superstition, for true science is reason and reali-
> ty, and religion is essentially reality and pure reason; therefore, the
> two must correspond. Religious teaching which is at variance with
> science and reason is human invention and imagination unworthy of
> acceptance, for the antithesis and opposite of knowledge is supersti-
> tion born of the ignorance of man. If we say religion is opposed to
> science, we lack knowledge of either true science or true religion, for
> both are founded upon the premises and conclusions of reason, and
> both must bear its test. (Promulgation 107)
78            The Journal of Bahá’í Studies 13. 1/4. 2003

According to ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, much of human conflict can be traced to
man-made differences between science and religion and between the vari-
ous religious sects: “Much of the discord and disunion of the world is cre-
ated by these man-made oppositions and contradictions. If religion were
in harmony with science and they walked together, much of the hatred
and bitterness now bringing misery to the human race would be at an
end” (Paris Talks 144).

‘Abdu’l-Bahá emphasizes the indispensability of both science and reli-
gion for human progress. An important aspect of this is that science safe-
guards religion against superstition and religion protects science from
dogmatic materialism. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá puts it as follows:

> Religion and science are the two wings upon which man’s intelligence
> can soar into the heights, with which the human soul can progress. It
> is not possible to fly with one wing alone! Should a man try to fly with
> the wing of religion alone he would quickly fall into the quagmire of
> superstition, whilst on the other hand, with the wing of science alone
> he would also make no progress, but fall into the despairing slough of
> materialism. (Paris Talks 143)

IMPLICATIONS OF ‘ABDU’L-BAHÁ’S COMMENTS ON EVOLUTION

The Bahá’í teachings in general, and ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s comments in particular,
make it clear that science and religion, if properly understood, are in
agreement. Does this imply that scientific knowledge can be used to
enhance understanding of religion? Can religion enrich scientific under-
standing? Questions like these raise more general issues about the nature
of the agreement between science and religion. In the following, we use
‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s comments on evolution to explore some of these issues
from a Bahá’í perspective.

SCIENCE, RELIGION, AND AUTHORITY

Central to any discussion about the relationship between science and religion

is the question about the extent to which each enjoys authority. The Bahá’í
perspective is that “religion which is not in accordance with established
science is superstition.” While this seems to suggest that religion must
accept current scientific knowledge as authoritative, this is not necessari-
ly always the case. The present scientific point of view is not always cor-
rect, nor is the truth limited to only what science can explain.15

Ultimately, according to ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, the worth of a given science is
determined by whether or not it leads to love of God: “Every kind of
knowledge, every science, is as a tree: if the fruit of it be the love of God,
then is it a blessed tree, but if not, that tree is but dried-up wood, and shall
only feed the fire” (Selections 181). In a similar vein, He describes science
without religion as blocking progress by leading man to “fall into the
despairing slough of materialism” (Paris Talks 143). Thus, we can charac-
terize the Bahá’í Writings as saying that religion must be in conformity
with reason and science, and that science should not be misused to turn
people’s hearts away from God.

AGREEMENT OF RELIGION WITH SCIENCE

Let us consider whether or not ‘Abdu’l-Bahá comments on evolution are in
agreement with the truths of the evolutionary sciences. Clearly, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá
espouses an evolutionary perspective as the framework for understanding
the emergence of man. He describes man as evolving through stages, start-
ing in the mineral kingdom, then moving through the vegetable and animal
kingdoms before arriving in the human kingdom. He also describes life as
developing from a single origin by a slow process over extremely long peri-
ods of time. Thus, He embraces an evolutionary viewpoint that is in broad
general agreement with that of the biological sciences: the earth is very
ancient, life evolved from simple origins, man evolved through the animal
world, and man’s attributes are a consequence of his evolution.

DEPARTURES FROM THE CONVENTIONAL INTERPRETATION

Aspects of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s thought are at odds with certain conventional

80            The Journal of Bahá’í Studies 13. 1/4. 2003

interpretations of evolution. He emphasizes that humans, while sharing
characteristics in common with the animals, are in some fundamental
ways distinct and different from them. He also emphasizes—repeatedly—
that humans have always existed, either potentially or in actuality. He
explains evolution by analogy with the development of an embryo or a
seed. Much as a tree exists potentially in a seed or as an adult exists
potentially in an embryo, man is present at the beginning in the evolu-
tionary process. He thus describes evolutionary mechanisms of develop-
ment not only as intrinsic to the growth of life on earth (and an essential
aspect of spiritual development), but as the unfolding of God’s creation.
He stresses that man—and all the rest of creation—is created by God.

Do these seeming departures from the conventional interpretation of
evolution conflict with the Bahá’í view that religion should be in conformity
with science? Are they assertions that modern scientific understandings
of evolution are wrong or incomplete? When considering these questions,
we should be careful to distinguish between factual accuracy, an area
where science often has indisputable authority, and metaphysics, phil-
osophy, and ideology, areas where science has no special privilege. Because
‘Abdu’l-Bahá classifies any religious belief that contradicts established
science as superstition, it is unlikely that He would endorse a view that
dismissed recognized bodies of scientific truth (like the evolutionary sci-
ences) as factually wrong. It is likely, therefore, that His departures from
the conventional interpretation of evolution are due to disagreements
with the metaphysical, philosophical, and ideological aspects of those
interpretations, not with scientific findings.

Man Is Not an Animal

Consider, for example, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s insistence that man is a distinct
species, not an “animal.” Taxonomically scientists place Homo sapiens as
one species in the order of primates, along with apes and monkeys—a
classification based on humans’ biological similarity to the primates.
‘Abdu’l-Bahá defines man as a separate species on the basis of those qual-
ities that differentiate humans from animals—their rational faculties, for

example—so there is no intrinsic contradiction. Indeed, the differences
between man and the animals in many aspects are significant and obvious,
suggesting that purely biological classification schemes are inadequate.
Classifying man as an animal, while perhaps useful for narrowly defined
scientific goals, ignores both human rational and spiritual aspects, making
it misleading as guidance for wider philosophical explorations.
Recognizing humans’ special nature—their rational faculty and spiritual
capacity—as a category of considerable significance opens up to discus-
sion those aspects of life that are unique to humans, such as science, art,
ethics, and the possibility of a peaceful global civilization.

The Missing Link

In the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, hominid forms interme-
diate between humans and their primate ancestors had not been discov-
ered. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá is reported to have stated that a “missing link” between
man and the animals would never be found: “Between man and the ape,
however, there is one link missing, and to the present time scientists have
not been able to discover it. . . . It will never be found” (Promulgation
358–59).

At the dawn of the twenty-first century, the fossil record is much more
complete, although new discoveries continually challenge and alter exist-
ing understandings. Fossils of many early hominid forms have been found
and a family tree has been constructed for the human species. Do earlier
hominid forms, having substantial anatomical differences from modern
humans, constitute the missing link, negating ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s assertion
that it would never be discovered? In the talk in which He discusses the
missing link, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá underscores that theories of evolution claim-
ing human beings to be descended from the animals concern themselves
solely with human anatomical characteristics:

> [T]he philosophers of the West have certain syllogisms, or demon-
> strations, whereby they endeavor to prove that man had his origin in
> the animal kingdom; that although he is now a vertebrate, he originally
82            The Journal of Bahá’í Studies 13. 1/4. 2003

> lived in the sea; from thence he was transferred to the land and
> became vertebrate; that g radually his feet and hands appeared in his
> anatomical development; then he began to walk upon all fours, after
> which he attained to human stature, walking erect. They find that his
> anatomy has undergone successive changes, finally assuming human
> form, and that these intermediate forms or changes are like links con-
> nected. . . . Therefore, the greatest proof of this western theory of
> human evolution is anatomical. . . . (Promulgation 358)

Other philosophies, in contrast, describe reason as man’s essential reality,
separating humans from the animals:

> The materialistic philosophers of the West declare that man belongs
> to the animal kingdom, whereas the philosophers of the East—such
> as Plato, Aristotle and the Persians—divide the world of existence or
> phenomena of life into two general categories or kingdoms: one the
> animal kingdom, or world of nature, the other the human kingdom,
or world of reason.

Man is distinguished above the animals through his reason.
(Promulgation 356–57)

‘Abdu’l-Bahá endorses this point of view. Man clearly has scientific
attainments attributable to the faculty of reason, attainments animals fail
to possess. The “missing link” between man and the apes thus signifies the
distinction between the human and animal kingdoms: “The lost link of
Darwinian theory is itself a proof that man is not an animal. How is it
possible to have all the links present and that important link absent? Its
absence is an indication that man has never been an animal. It will never
be found. The significance is this: that the world of humanity is distinct
from the animal kingdom” (Promulgation 359).

So in the Bahá’í view, while humans are anatomically connected with the
animals, their true reality, which is intellectual and spiritual, is distinct
and separate.16

Man Has Always Existed

‘Abdu’l-Bahá states that man has always existed. Even when man did not
physically exist, or when he existed in a form different than he has today,
‘Abdu’l-Bahá states that he nonetheless existed. In His comments on evo-
lution, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá frequently uses the analogies of the development of
a mature plant from a seed and the development of an adult from an
embryo. In many of His other comments and writings, He describes sim-
ilar developmental processes that transform potentiality into actuality.
Thus, before humans physically existed, their existence was potential, like
the existence of the tree in the seed, or the full adult form in the embryo.

‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s standpoint is very simple but subtle. Two factors may
make His argument difficult to grasp for those accustomed to modern
debates about human origins. The first factor is that evolutionary process-
es are often thought to proceed without goals or purpose. The second fac-
tor is that it is difficult to see how the very simple constituents of pri-
mordial matter—subatomic particles and the like—could contain within
them instructions for building the biological complexity of man. What is
it in the structure of reality that allows human existence to become real-
ized? From a scientific perspective, what allows mankind’s existence must
be built into the laws of nature. Of course, certain conditions have to be
met before human existence becomes a reality, that is, a planet must be at
a suitable distance from its star and have a suitable atmosphere, chemical
composition, water content, and so on. But these are conditions that are
made possible by the laws of nature. Therefore, it follows that the laws of
nature contain within themselves everything that brings about man’s
existence. An important consequence of this thesis is that it locates both
the possibility and the current actuality of the existence of man in the
laws underlying the entire universe.

The Laws of Nature Embody God’s Will

The view that humankind was created through the laws of nature differs
from a traditional Western Christian stance, which holds humans to have

84            The Journal of Bahá’í Studies 13. 1/4. 2003

been created by the miraculous inter vention of God. In contrast, ‘Abdu’l-
Bahá ascribes the origins and evolution of man—indeed of all life—to
natural developmental and evolutionary processes. This view equates the
scientific understanding of human origins with a religious perspective
unencumbered by ancient dogmas and superstitions. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá empha-
sizes the central role of evolutionary processes and calls attention to par-
allels that exist between physical and spiritual development (Promulgation
131). He identifies evolution as a universal divine law: “The organization
of God is one; the evolution of existence is one; the divine system is one.
Whether they be small or great beings, all are subject to one law and system”
(Some Answered Questions 199).

Bahá’u’lláh describes the laws of nature as an expression of God’s will:
“Nature in its essence is the embodiment of My Name, the Maker, the
Creator. Its manifestations are diversified by varying causes, and in this
diversity there are signs for men of discernment. Nature is God’s Will
and is its expression in and through the contingent world” (Tablets of
Bahá’u’lláh 142). A corollary of this is that God’s creation of human
beings has been effected through natural law.

COMPLEXITY AND ‘ABDU’L-BAHÁ’S COMMENTS ON EVOLUTION

Complexity theory offers an increasingly popular way to probe the inter-
play of historical contingency and natural law responsible for the persis-
tent increase of complexity in the universe. Although still an emerging
field, it has brought important new perspectives to the study of evolu-
tion.17 Questions it poses are central to the discussion of human evolu-
tion: In a universe with omnipresent randomness, where does order come
from?18 What in the structure of physical law gives rise to complexity?19
Is the emergence of life probable or improbable? Is evolution governed by
general laws (see Kauffman, Investigations)? Are intelligence and con-
sciousness inevitable (see Simonton; Byrne)?

A compelling interpretation of what we know about the history of the
universe is that it can be characterized as an unfolding of greater levels of
complexity leading from primordial matter to galaxies, stars, and planets

and eventually to life. Throughout all of the processes responsible for
these unfoldings—processes at scales ranging from the subatomic to the
cosmological—randomness plays a role. Chance and law (see Monod)
work together in this grand scheme to produce the complex universe we
see today. Randomness is the engine that drives the relentless discovery of
new complex configurations of matter, and therefore is indispensable to
evolution at all levels. Therefore, the presence of randomness as a central
mechanism of biological evolution does not contradict the idea that God
created man.

The complexity theory approach to evolution exhibits strong parallels
with ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s teachings. It suggests that general laws govern evolu-
tion, in resonance with ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s assertion that evolution conforms to
universal law. Complexity theory states that new properties emerge from
complex configurations of matter, mirroring ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s affirmation
that man’s perfections are an outcome of his physical makeup. Complexity
theory strongly suggests that intelligence and consciousness are the
inevitable results of evolution, echoing ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s principle that man is
necessarily present in the universe. From both viewpoints, human beings
are the product of historical processes as well as the long-awaited expres-
sion of underlying order latent in the laws of nature (see Kauffman, At
Home 149–89). Championing these ideas, the physicist Freeman Dyson
declares: “I do not feel like an alien in this universe. The more I examine
the universe and study the details of its architecture the more evidence I
find that the universe in some sense must have known we were coming”
(250).

CONCLUSION

‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s comments on evolution show that belief in divine creation
and evolutionary thought are compatible, illustrating the Bahá’í principle
of the unity of science and religion. Here we briefly examine some of the
wider implications. A central issue is how we view ourselves: Is man just
an animal or is he something more? Does man have purpose or not? Other
questions concern the relationship of science and religion: Is religion

86            The Journal of Bahá’í Studies 13. 1/4. 2003

compatible with science? How do science and religion contribute to the
development of a peaceful global civilization? Are science and religion
both necessary?

We have seen that ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s comments on evolution support the
view that physically humans are the product of the natural processes
responsible for animals and all living beings. Animals, and most other liv-
ing beings, are captive to nature—they cannot deviate from a range of
behaviors imposed on them by evolution (see Wilson). If man is simply an
animal, it follows that animal behavioral patterns—conflict, aggression,
and the like—are inherent, inescapable, and ineradicable aspects of human
nature as violence and conflict are chronic and permanent realities in the
animal world.20 If man is an animal, he cannot be held individually
responsible for his actions, nor does it follow that he is capable of altering
them. Similarly, if man is solely a product of the random mechanisms of
evolution, then he was not created with a purpose. An attitude of hope-
lessness and meaninglessness—“the despairing slough of materialism”
(‘Abdu’l-Bahá, Paris Talks 143)—seems to be the unavoidable consequence
of such beliefs.21

To ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, man is much more than an animal. Man has a three-
fold reality, He asserts:

> Man is endowed with an outer or physical reality. It belongs to the
> material realm, the animal kingdom, because it has sprung from the
> material world. This animalistic reality of man he shares in common
with the animals.

The human body is like animals subject to nature’s laws. But man
> is endowed with a second reality, the rational or intellectual reality;
and the intellectual reality of man predominates over nature. . . .

Yet there is a third reality in man, the spiritual reality. (Foundations
51)

Man’s physical nature is rooted in the animal kingdom. Evolution has left
its imprint on us: we are constrained by the need for food, shelter, sleep, and
other physical necessities. But human beings, unlike animals, are not slaves

to nature’s command. Their rational mind and spiritual capacity open to
them a vast range of choices not available to animals. Aggression, selfish-
ness, and conflict, far from being inescapable aspects of human individuals
and society, are the outward signs of undeveloped spiritual potential.

One of the unique capacities of man is science. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá maintains
that science is a divine gift: “The virtues of humanity are many, but sci-
ence is the most noble of them all. The distinction which man enjoys
above and beyond the station of the animal is due to this paramount
virtue. It is a bestowal of God; it is not material; it is divine” (Promulgation
49). ‘Abdu’l-Bahá urges humanity to apply its scientific powers to unify
the human race:

“How shall we utilize these gifts and expend these bounties [science]?

By directing our efforts toward the unification of the human race. We
must use these powers in establishing the oneness of the world of human-
ity, appreciate these virtues by accomplishing the unity of whites and
blacks, devote this divine intelligence to the perfecting of amity and con-
cord among all branches of the human family. . . .” (Promulgation 51).

Another unique human capacity is religion. “The essential purpose of
the religion of God,” ‘Abdu’l-Bahá states, “is to establish unity among
mankind” (Promulgation 202). “It is evident,” He asserts elsewhere, “that
the fundamentals of religion are intended to unify and bind together; their
purpose is universal, everlasting peace” (Promulgation 97). As we have
seen, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá states that true religion and science do not conflict with
each other, nor does science obviate the need for religion.

‘Abdu’l-Bahá declares that both religion and science should direct their
services towards a common goal: the unity of humanity. When their har-
mony becomes widely understood, this will set into motion processes that
will convert conflict and struggle into peace and unity: “When religion,
shorn of its superstitions, traditions, and unintelligent dogmas, shows its
conformity with science, then will there be a great unifying, cleansing
force in the world which will sweep before it all wars, disagreements, dis-
cords and struggles—and then will mankind be united in the power of the
Love of God” (Paris Talks 146).

The enterprise of creating a peaceful global civilization is a formidable
88             The Journal of Bahá’í Studies 13. 1/4. 2003

one. If it is to be accomplished, both science and religion must be brought
into play. Science trains and develops humanity’s intellectual capacity,
frees humanity from ignorance and superstition, and provides the materi-
al, technological, and wealth-creating mechanisms that make a global civ-
ilization possible. Religion provides the spiritual and moral impetus that
takes the benefits of science and directs them into appropriate application.
Religion trains and develops humanity’s spiritual capacity, identifies and
establishes the moral and ethical foundations of society, and provides a
universally compelling vision of the goal to be achieved. Without both
science and religion, a peaceful and unified world civilization is impossible.

4. This article will consider only a general position about evolution that was
prevalent in the Christian West, as it is the one to which ‘Abdu’l-Bahá was specif-
ically responding. The position of other religions with respect to evolution is out-
side the scope of the paper. For a discussion of the nineteenth-century reception
of Darwin’s theory of evolution in the Middle East and its relationship to ‘Abdu’l-
Bahá’s comments, see Brown.

as engaging with is of necessity generalized, but it represents the general view
His audience most likely had in mind when they asked Him about the topic.

8. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá uses the Persian word naw‘—translated as “species”—which
has the broad sense of “kind” or “category.”

9. Fossils of the earliest known hominid species, Australopithecus anamensis, were
discovered in Ethiopia and Kenya. Living slightly more than four million years
ago, Australopithecines were bipedal, a trait which may be taken as the first
hominid adaptation. Many other species of hominids inhabited the earth before
modern Homo sapiens appeared about one hundred thousand years ago. The phys-
ical features of hominids (bipedal locomotion, large brain, slender build, etc.) were
unique adaptations that have been seen nowhere else in the animal world. It is,
therefore, evident that humans are unique even in the physical sense. See Lewin,
Origin, and Tattersall, Becoming Human, for reviews of human evolution.

10. The human spirit and the human or rational soul designate one thing. See
‘Abdu’l-Bahá, Some Answered Questions 208–9.

11. The continuity of human existence is dependent upon the continuous pres-
ence of stars and planetary systems that are home to life and evolution.
Bahá’u’lláh affirms that the earth is not the only planet to host life: “The learned
men, that have fixed at several thousand years the life of this earth, have failed,
throughout the long period of their observation, to consider either the number
or the age of the other planets. Consider, moreover, the manifold divergencies
that have resulted from the theories propounded by these men. Know thou that
every fixed star hath its own planets, and every planet its own creatures, whose
number no man can compute” (Gleanings 163).

12. Robert Wright has remarked that evolution may obviate the need to posit
a God that designs organisms, but it does not rule out a God who designed the
machine (natural selection) that designs organisms (see Nonzero 294).

13. Intelligence, consciousness, and self-consciousness are terms used inter-
changeably in the liter ature to refer to the unique cognitive abilities of humans.

14. For an exploration of creationism from the point of view of a biologist who
is a believing Christian, see Miller, Finding Darwin’s God.

15. The nature of scientific knowledge has been the subject of vigorous and
90             The Journal of Bahá’í Studies 13. 1/4. 2003

controversial debates by philosophers, historians, and sociologists. For a balanced
overview of these debates, see Kitcher; Klee. For an eminent scientist’s response,
see Weinberg.

16. Above we discuss parallels between ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s approach to evolution
and that of complexity theory. According to the latter, biological species consti-
tute quasi-stable points (sometimes called attractors) of a complex dynamical
system. Stable points in the state-space—the space of biological possibilities—
are discrete. Transitions between states are sharp and the distinctions between
them can be dramatic. If the human species constitutes an attractor in biological
state-space, complexity theory suggests that there may be no link, in terms of
traits, that connects the human species with other species. Thus, complexity the-
ory may offer an explanation of why the missing link will never be found.

18. Quantum mechanics—one of the pillars of modern physics—is a theory of
probabilities. Thus, randomness is embedded in the very structure of the laws of
the universe.

19. Complexity theorists ascribe the accumulation of complexity in the bio-
sphere not to mutation and natural selection alone, as Neo-Darwinism contends,
but also to the intrinsic self-organizing properties of complex systems. See Kauff-
man, At Home.

20. The emerging discipline of evolutionary psychology attempts to explain a
great deal—perhaps the majority—of human behavior in Darwinian terms, i.e.,
as determined genetically, either directly or indirectly through the creation of
“mental organs.” For a review of evolutionary psychology, see Wright. Conversely,
a group of distinguished scientists and scholars has condemned the misuse of
evolutionary theory to justify the existence of war and violence in the Seville
Statement on Violence, which was adopted by UNESCO in 1989.
