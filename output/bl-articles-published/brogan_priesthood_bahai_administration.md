   The Roman Catholic Priesthood and Bahá’í
> Administration – A Dialogue by Kevin Brogan

Abstract
One of the teachings of the Bahá’í Faith is that in this
dispensation there is no longer a need for a professional
priesthood. One might therefore ask how there could be any
reason to deal with the issue of Roman Catholic Priesthood
in the context of Bahá’í Administration. This paper examines
the three elements of Roman Catholic Priesthood –
Leadership, Teaching and Sacrament – in an effort to explain
to Bahá’ís the theology of Priesthood and to demonstrate to
Roman Catholics how many of the functions pertaining to the
role of priests are being fulfilled in Bahá’í Administration.
This issue is pertinent, considering the level of criticism of
the Roman Catholic Hierarchy in recent years. There is a lot
of misunderstanding surrounding the meaning of priesthood,
and the paper sets out to answer the need for a greater
understanding of workings of the Roman Catholic
Administration.

Introduction
Growing up in the Irish Roman Catholic tradition, one cannot
forget the hierarchical influence of the local priest in the
Church. The true meaning of Church as the ‘People of God’ is
often lost on many Roman Catholics, and many would say that
this is due to the influence of a Hierarchy which is seen to
impose its teaching on the laity. The priest, “acting in ‘persona
Christi,’ feeds the flock, the people of God, and leads them to
sanctity.”1 How is that role played out in the parish? The
Roman Catholic doctrinal tradition describes the priest as
teacher of the Word (Scripture), minister of the Sacraments and
leader of the Christian community entrusted to him (his
parish). In the context of the Bahá’í Faith, the priest performs
the functions of both the appointed arm and the elected arm.

For the purposes of this paper, it is important to examine each
of these three priestly functions – teacher, minister of
Sacraments and leader2 – and how the role of the Roman
Catholic Hierarchy contrasts with the leadership model evident
in the Bahá’í Faith.

One might question the relevance of such a study as
Bahá’u’lláh has told us that in this Dispensation there is no
need for priesthood, as it exists in Christian religious
denominations. This, however, does not diminish the relevance
of such a comparison between the leadership model of the
Bahá’í Faith and that of Roman Catholicism. The relevance of
such a study is that it sets out to enable Roman Catholics to
understand the reasoning for not having a priesthood while at
the same time allowing Bahá’ís to understand the theology
behind Roman Catholic priesthood.

The Church Hierarchy and its Teaching Role in the
Christian Community
The missionary activity of the Roman Catholic Church – or
pioneering, as it applies to the Bahá’í Faith – is “incumbent
primarily on the College of Bishops presided over by its head,
the Successor of Peter”3, while the “priests ... are collaborators
with the Bishop in virtue of the Sacrament of Orders, and are
called to share responsibility for the mission.”4 As a result, the
Church Hierarchy holds the ultimate responsibility for
spreading the Word of God, a role which in the Bahá’í Faith is
the challenge facing each believer. However, lay teachers are
also employed to carry out this task, but in all cases under the
auspices of the local priest or bishop. This authority is given to
the priest by virtue of his sacred ordination.5 This is not meant
to be an issue of power. This monopolisation of the teaching of
the Word of God stems from the belief that the priest in his
parish has a theological training and knowledge which is
greater than that of the laity.

The argument may be put forward, as it is in the Bahá’í
Faith, that people have benefited from the advances of

widespread education, which challenges them to seek after
truth. However, it remains the teaching of the Roman Catholic
Church that the priest is the primary teacher of his flock. This
is despite the fact that lay people now have sufficient education
to be able to make informed decisions about interpreting how
the teachings of Jesus can influence their individual lives. In
the Bahá’í Faith, the believers are encouraged to read the
writings and reflect on how they can lead them to God: “Man
should know his own self and recognise that which leadeth
unto loftiness or lowliness, glory or abasement, wealth or
poverty.”6 One must earnestly seek after truth with a pure heart
and a mind free of prejudice.

Therefore, as a Roman Catholic, one is expected to
follow the teachings of Christ as recorded in the New
Testament and interpreted by the Hierarchy as well as the
teachings from suitable books7 and “approved writers in
theology” 8, while also adhering to the teachings of the Vatican
as they have evolved over the last two thousand years. The
authority for such teaching lies in the hands of the Pope and
his College of Bishops, which constitutes an infallible
authority because they are direct successors to the apostles and
the Pope is a direct descendant of St Peter, the first Pope. It is
interesting to note that the doctrine on Papal Infallibility was
not drafted until 1869 and in response to the unification of
Italy where Papal authority was confined to the present-day
Vatican; according to Cardinal Manning of England, at the
time, “European powers are dissolving the temporal power of
the Vicar of Christ.” This Papal primacy, or infallibility, means
that the Pope, when teaching matters of faith or morals for all
the faithful, cannot err and is to be obeyed.

It might be said that the absence of a professional clergy
in the Bahá’í Faith poses a greater challenge for the individual
believer. In Roman Catholicism, the individual has been
encouraged to rely on the Hierarchy to teach, although there
has been some effort to involve laity in this task because of the
fall-off in vocations to the priesthood and religious life.

However, each individual Bahá’í is encouraged to participate in
teaching the faith: “It is the individual who manifests the
vitality of the Faith upon which the success of the teaching
work and the development of the community depends.”9

The Priest as Leader in his Parish
The administrative structure described above has served the
Church of Rome quite well throughout its history, even if there
is less loyalty to it in today’s society. Because it was necessary
to protect the faith from heresies and to maintain the purity of
the teachings, such a leadership was centralised, with authority
and power resting in the hands of a small group of individuals
headed by one person who was seen as “Christ’s Vicar” on
earth. Such a leadership – called the Church Magisterium –
had to be authoritarian and to “preserve God’s people from
deviations and deflections and to guarantee them the objective
possibility of professing the true faith without error.”10 Out of
this need grew a professional clergy, which served the faithful
and who were largely uneducated and needed to be told what
was right and wrong, what was sinful and what was not, what
was Church teaching and what was heresy. The Pope is still
seen to be the “perpetual and visible source and the foundation
of unity both of the bishops and of the whole community of the
faithful.”11 As Vicar of Christ and as “pastor of the entire
church, he has full supreme and universal power over the
whole church, a power he can always exercise unhindered.”12
Likewise, when Christ appointed Simon Peter as the head of
the Church (Matthew 16:18–19), He also, by extension,
appointed the Apostles to work with Peter to lead the Church.
Today the bishops of the Church live in “communion with one
another and with the Roman Pontiff in a bond of unity, charity
and peace … Together with their head the Supreme Pontiff,
and never apart from him, they have supreme power and
authority over the Universal Church.”13 In addition to this, the
individual bishops in their own dioceses “exercise their
pastoral office over the portion of the People of God assigned

to them” 14, while at the same time have consideration for the
needs of the whole Church as part of their participation in the
College of Cardinals. The bishop is the authentic teacher of the
faith in his diocese, and exercises power in accordance with the
whole Church under the guidance of the Pope. For example, it
is Church teaching that the bishop is the primary religious
education teacher of all Roman Catholic children in his
diocese. He rules with the same authority and sacred power in
his diocese as the Pope rules the whole Church. Likewise the
priest in his parish has the same power and authority as the
bishop has in the diocese.

Such an infallibility also exists with the Bahá’í Universal
House of Justice15; ‘Abdu’l-Bahá tells us that the members of
the Universal House of Justice “have not, individually, essential
infallibility: but the body of the House of Justice is under the
protection and the unerring guidance of God: this is called
conferred infallibility.”16 Likewise the Spiritual Assemblies –
both at national and local level – set out to “dispel all the
doubts, misunderstandings and harmful differences which may
arise in the community of believers.”17 In the same way that the
bishop has complete authority in his diocese and the priest has
similar authority in his parish, it can be said that the National
Spiritual Assembly and the Local Spiritual Assembly have
authority when they meet and make decisions.

However, one major difference exists in that National and
Local Assemblies and, indeed, the Universal House of Justice
are elected authorities. A convention takes place each year at
national level where delegates appointed by the believers in
each local community meet to consult on issues pertaining to
the believers under the jurisdiction of the National Assembly,
while the members of the Universal House of Justice are
elected for five-year terms. Bahá’ís are encouraged to inform
their Local Assemblies of issues concerning the local
community, and the members of the Local Assemblies consult
on these issues. Such a process is not as strong within the
Roman Catholic parish. Within the Catholic Church, priests

and bishops are appointed and the faithful have no vote or say
on their appointment. Likewise each parish is expected to have
a parish council made up of the faithful who meet to discuss
issues concerning the parish:

> The individual layman, by reason of the knowledge,
> competence or outstanding ability which he may employ
> is permitted and sometimes even obliged to express his
> opinion on things which concern the good of the Church.
> When occasion arise, let this be done through the
> agencies set up by the Church for this purpose. Let it
> always be done in truth, in courage, and in prudence,
> with reverence and charity towards those who by reason
> of their sacred office represent the person of Christ.18

However, lay involvement is organised by the local priest and
the laity can offer opinion which will support the priest in his
threefold mission of teaching God’s word, sanctifying others by
his gift of sacrament and sacrifice and leading others to God’s
promise of eternal life. But this body is not legislative and
cannot make policy or issue decrees. It is a consultative body,
whereby the priest consults with the faithful and yet has the
final decision. By the authority vested in him in the Sacrament
of Holy Orders, he decides what should be done. The parish
council does not therefore administer the parish: its role is to
help the priest in his leadership role, advising him on the needs
of the parish while affirming his indispensable office as the
laity’s mediator with God and his tangible link with his bishop
and the rest of the Church. Many would say that because this
authority is vested in one individual who is not elected by the
faithful and is often a stranger, such an authority lacks
credibility. Indeed, in light of the recent allegations and
exposure of the sexual abuse of children and young people
perpetrated by priests in Ireland and North America, this
authority has been significantly eroded.

The leadership of the Roman Catholic Church operates a
hierarchical model of administration, with the Pope having
supreme power and authority and jurisdiction over all the
Church. While the Bahá’í Administration in the form of the
Universal House of Justice, along with National and Local
Assemblies, has the same power and authority, it is an elected
authority made up of believers “representative of the choicest
and most varied and capable elements in every Bahá’í
community.”19 It is important to point out that there is also an
appointed arm of Bahá’í Administration. This institution is the
International Teaching Centre (established in 1973), which is
given the task of promoting the expansion of the Bahá’í Faith
and defending it against external and internal attack. The
International Teaching Centre is based in Haifa in Israel, and it
supervises Continental Boards of Counsellors, whose
responsibility is to promote and defend the Faith in their
respective continents. Counsellors are appointed for a five-year
term. They in turn appoint Auxiliary Boards for Protection and
Propagation in each of the countries, who in turn appoint
assistants to help them. The Counsellors, Auxiliary Board
members and their assistants “are responsible for stimulating,
counselling and assisting National Spiritual Assemblies and
work with individuals, groups and Local Assemblies.”20 While
the Counsellors and the Auxiliary Board Members outrank the
National and Local Assemblies, they do not interfere in the
conduct and administering of Assemblies’ plans. Therefore the
elected administration in the form of the Assemblies has
autonomy to deal with the issues pertaining to their
communities. Unlike the parish council in the Roman Catholic
tradition, which is established to advise the priest, the National
and Local Spiritual Assemblies are actively involved in serving
the needs of their respective communities. Both the appointed
arm and the elected arm of the Bahá’í Faith operate out of a
servant model of leadership, where “the functions, procedures
between the agencies of the Bahá’í Administration are meant to
canalise, not obstruct the work of the Cause ... these aspects of

the administration will properly be viewed in the context of
humble service to the Blessed Perfection [Bahá’u’lláh], which
is the loftiest objective of all who are gathered under the
banner of the Most Great Name.”21 This approach challenges
the believer to play an active part in his or her Faith, whereas
in Roman Catholicism the faith of the people depends on the
structures rather than on the outpouring of the Holy Spirit and
on one’s ability to make an informed decision having read the
Scriptures. By virtue of the conferral of Holy Orders, the Pope,
bishops and priests have the sole right to speak in Christ’s
name officially, while the part played by the laity is limited to
an advisory capacity and to be consulted when the need arises.

The Sacramental Ministry of Priesthood
The Bahá’í administrative system is not an ecclesiastical one,
as already mentioned. Indeed, Bahá’u’lláh tells priests to leave
their ministries: “O concourse of priests! Leave the bells, and
come forth, then, from your churches.”22 It is the Bahá’í belief
that a sacramental theology as taught by the Catholic Church
had its importance in history and that there is now no need for
such rituals to help the faithful adhere to their faith. This
includes the sacrament of Holy Orders, which is taken by the
priest and gives him the power to lead his flock. In turn the
priest is the chief celebrant for the other six sacraments –
Baptism, Penance, Eucharist, Confirmation, Marriage, and the
Sacrament of the Sick (Extreme Unction). This sacramental
dimension of the church celebrating “privileged moments in
communicating the divine life to man, are at the very core of
priestly ministry.”23 The priest acts in the person of Christ, and
because the sacraments “have become the only effective
moments for transmitting the contents of the faith”24, the priest
is seen as the prime instrument of passing on such a faith.
Central to this is the Eucharist or Mass: “No Christian
community can be built up unless it grows from and hinges on
to the celebration of the Most Holy Eucharist ... For in the

most Blessed Eucharist is contained the whole spiritual good of
the Church”25

Comparable to this in the Bahá’í Faith is the celebration
by the community of the Nineteen-Day Feast. Unlike the Mass
in Roman Catholicism, however, there is no celebrant. ‘Abdul-
Bahá tells us that the Feast should be conducted in a manner
where the responsibility of all participants is to bring about
“knowledge, understanding, faith, assurance, love, affinity,
kindness, purity of purpose, attraction of hearts and union of
souls” 26, where the owner of the house hosting the Feast serves
the participants. Feasts are also held in Bahá’í Centres, and
one of the believers or a family acts as host. “If the Feast is
arranged in this manner and in the way mentioned, that supper
is the ‘Lord’s Supper’, for the result is the same result and the
effect is the same effect.”27

Also absent from the celebration of the Feast is an
overemphasis on ritual. The Guardian wrote specifically on the
use of rituals that “Bahá’u’lláh has reduced all ritual and form
to an absolute minimum in His Faith”28, and goes on to state
that Bahá’í teachings “warn against developing a system of
uniform and rigid rituals incorporating man-made forms and
practices, such as exist in other religions where rituals usually
consist of elaborate ceremonial practices performed by a
member of the clergy.”29 The Roman Catholic Church, on the
other hand, places the priest centre-stage: “The priest has a
mission to promote the cult of the Eucharistic presence …
thereby making his own church a Christian ‘house of
prayer.’”30

Conclusion
This paper has examined some of the issues surrounding the
paradigms of administration found in the Roman Catholic
Church and in the Bahá’í Faith. At first sight there appears to
be a great difference between both administrations. The Roman
Catholic tradition is governed by a clerical leadership, which
seems to wield a strong control over the faithful, as is the case

in most religious traditions, both Christian and non-Christian.

It is hierarchical by nature, with authority being administered
from the top. The Bahá’í Administration has pronounced
democratic features, is not clerical and operates out of a
servant model of leadership with a strong emphasis on
consultation and decision-making in the community. However,
the threefold role of the Roman Catholic priest – Teacher of
the Word, Minister of the Sacraments, and Leader of the
Community – has some elements also in the Bahá’í
Administration. The difference is that in the Bahá’í Faith, these
roles are not confined to a special group of people who
undergo intensive training at the end of which there is a
ceremony or ritual and they become life-members of a priestly
group. In the Bahá’í Faith, each believer is challenged to
undertake these tasks – for example, teaching the Faith. While
there are no sacraments or Mass in the Bahá’í Faith, believers
are encouraged to participate in and to host Nineteen-Day
Feasts and devotional meetings. Likewise the believer is
encouraged to participate, if elected, in the consultations of the
Local or National Spiritual Assemblies, and, if appointed, to
serve as a Counsellor, Auxiliary Board Member or assistant for
the protection or propagation of the Faith.
