Pray ers and rituals in the Bah á’í Faith: A
Tablet to Jiná b-i- Mullá ‘Alí- Akbar f í

Ar∂∂i’l-Álif

Julio Savi and Faezeh Mardani

Who was Mullá ‘Al í-Akbar -i-Ardistání?

The historical information about Mullá ‘Alí-Akbar-i-
Ardistání that the authors were able to find are scanty.
However they are enough to give an understanding of the
allusions of Bahá’u’lláh’s Tablet addressed to him. Mullá ‘Alí-
Akbar was almost certainly born in Ardistán, a town 2000
meters high, located at the southern foothills of the Karkas
mountain chain, adjacent to Dasht-i-Kavír, the central Iranian
desert, not far from Káshán and Náyin. This town, not very
important to day, in the past used to be a major city on the
route of the caravans and it has been described as the birthplace
of the Sasanian king of kings, Khusraw I, entitled the Just (531-
578 ce) or Anúshírván (of the immortal soul).

In his youth Mullá ‘Alí-Akbar lived in Ißfáhán, the renowned
artistic city in which Avicenna resided and taught in the twelfth
century. In Ißfáhán he was a pupil of Mulla Íádiq-i-Khurásání
(Balyuzi, The Báb 77), known as Muqaddas and later entitled by
Bahá’u’lláh Ismu’lláhu’l-Aßdaq, one of the four Hands of the
Cause appointed posthumously by ‘Abdu’l-Bahá (see ‘Abdu’l-
Bahá, Memorials 5-8). In that town he embraced the Cause of
the Báb in 1845 (Manuchehri) together with his master, when
Mullá Óusayn-i-Bushrú’í (1813-1849), the first of the 18
disciples of the Báb, known as Letters of the Living, went there
after having been dismissed by the Báb in Shíráz. Immediately
after his conversion Mullá ‘Alí-Akbar went with Mulla Íádiq to
Kirmán and then to Shíráz. In this town Mullá Íádiq and his
pupil met Mullá Mu˙ammad-‘Alí Barfurúshí, entitled Quddús
(1822-1849), the most illustrious among the Letters of the
Living. The three Bábís began to teach the new Faith and to put
in practice its precepts. Particularly, Mullá Íádiq carried out the
Báb’s instruction to modify the adhán, the call to prayer, adding

322                                             Prayers and Rituals

the words: “‘I bear witness that He whose name is ‘Alí Qabl-i-
Mu˙ammad [‘Alí preceding Mu˙ammad, the Báb] is the servant
of Baqíyyatu’lláh [the Remnant of God, Bahá’u’lláh]’” (Balyuzi,
The Báb 78). This action horrified the pious Muslims of the
town, who were already upset because of the people converted
to the new Movement through the efforts of the three Bábís,
and aroused their anger against the one who had performed that
action and his two friends. The three men were arrested, beaten,
their beards were burnt, their noses were pierced, through this
incision a cord was passed, and with this halter they were led
through the streets of the city. Therefore he and his two
companions were “the first to suffer persecution on Persian soil
for the sake of the Cause of God” (Nabíl, Dawn-Breakers 414).
Immediately after this punishment, the three men met the Báb in
the vicinity of Darvázih Sa‘dí (Door of Sa‘dí), when He came
back to Shíráz from His pilgrimage to Mecca (Mu˙ammad-‘Alí
Faizí). Later on, Mullá Íádiq and Quddús left Shíráz and Mullá
‘Alí-Akbar remained there, hiding himself in ruins outside the
town (see Balyuzi, The Báb 78n). In those circumstances he
addressed a letter to the Báb. In that letter he wrote that he had
taught the Cause in three towns, Yazd, Kirmán and Shíráz,
asked permission to meet the Báb and a guidance on his
behavior. From Shíráz Mullá ‘Alí-Akbar returned to Ardistán
where he continued serving the Faith of the Báb, while keeping
afar from any dangerous situation (Óusayní 269).

According to Sepehr Manuchehri, an expert of Azalism,
“after that event he adopted taqiyyah and never again involved
himself at times of danger” (3:3, see also Mazandarani, Kitáb
Zuhur Al-Haqq 3:103). Taqiyyah, sometimes translated as
dissimulation, “denotes dispensing with the ordinances of
religion in cases of constraint and when there is a possibility of
harm” (Strothmann). Its upholders, especially among the
Shi’ites, consider it as based on the Qur’an (see 3:28 and 16:106)
as well as on Óadíth and juridical commentaries. Taqiyyah was
not abrogated by the Báb, as ‘Abdu’l-Bahá writes in His Tablet
known in the West as “Tablet of Purity”:

> The Báb, at the outset of His mission, explicitly
> prohibited tobacco, and the friends one and all abandoned
> its use. But since those were times when dissimulation was
> permitted (zaman-i-taqíyyih búd, lit.: it was the time of
> dissimulation), and every individual who abstained from
> smoking was exposed to harassment, abuse and even
> death—the friends, in order not to advertise their beliefs,
> would smoke. (SWAB 147, no. 129, Muntakhabátí 144)
Lights of ‘Irfán Book Nine                                  323

Therefore Mullá ‘Alí-Akbar cannot be condemned for having
adopted taqiyyah. Moreover Shaykh KáΩim-i-Samandar from
Qazvín (1844-1918), one of the so called Bahá’u’lláh’s apostles,
and the son of Shaykh Mu˙ammad, entitled Nabíl, a devote
follower of the Bab and His visitor in the fortress of Máh-Kú
and Chihríq (see Taherzadeh, Revelation 3:88), writes that he
was his pupil in Tabríz for two years (see Samandar 172, qtd. in
Balyuzi, Eminent Bahá’ís 200). Evidently the Mullá had a good
reputation among the Bábís and Bahá’ís. Samandar writes
moreover:

> After the declaration of the Abhá Beauty, he [Mullá ‘Alí-
> Akbar] became hesitant for a while, sunk in his own
> thoughts. Even in a Tablet, He [Bahá’u’lláh] commanded
> me to bear a message to him, this great teacher of mine.
> But before long the Will of God prevailed, and that
> sagacious, acute and subtle man, subsequent to deep
> investigation, came through the test and attained the
> highest degree of certitude and knowledge, and engaged in
> glorifying his Lord and teaching His Faith until he passed
> away. (172, qtd. in Balyuzi, Eminent Bahá’ís 200).

Mullá ‘Alí-Akbar, who lived for a long time after the Báb’s
martyrdom (see Óusayní 269), left a number of manuscripts,
comprising a collection in three volumes of works by the Báb,
that he copied in 1845. The Hand of the Cause of God Mr.
Abu’l-Qásim Faizí (1906-1980), who examined them before they
were dispatched to Shoghi Effendi in the Holy Land, writes:
“These books were written in black ink, but whenever the many
references were made to ‘Bahá,’ this word always appeared in
red. During the very first year of His ministry, the Báb had
instructed His amanuensis to write in this manner in order that
those who had no time or patience to read all His Writings
would be helped to see this Name” (8).

The cir cum stan ces of the Tabl et’s revelation

Bahá’u’lláh has seemingly addressed this Tablet to Mullá ‘Alí-
Akbar in that time when he was “sunk in his own thoughts”
(Samandar 172), with the intention of purifying him through
His vivifying Word “from the defilement of the superstitious”
(T1). This Tablet should thus have been written in the Baghdad
period (1853-1863).

Those were difficult years for the Bábís. The Báb had been
shot, all the greatest exponents of His Faith had been martyred,
and the one who had been provisionally appointed by the Báb as

324                                            Prayers and Rituals

“a figure-head (marja‘-i-ismíy-i-ahl-i Bayán, lit. figure-head of
the people of the Bayán) pending the manifestation of the
Promised One” (GPB 28-9, Kitáb-i-qarn-i-badí‘ 89), that is,
Mírzá Ya˙yá Núrí (1831-1912), a half-brother of Bahá’u’lláh,
was not able to act as the central figure of the community.
Bahá’u’lláh writes of this period.

> Upon Our arrival in Iraq We found the Cause of God sunk
> in deep apathy and the breeze of divine revelation stilled.
> Most of the believers were faint and dispirited, nay utterly
lost and dead. (TB 131)

During His absence from Baghdad the situation worsened.

Shoghi Effendi writes: “Such was the decline in their fortunes
that they hardly dared show themselves in public. Kurds and
Persians vied with each other, when confronting them in the
streets, in heaping abuse upon them, and in vilifying openly the
Cause which they professed” (GPB 125). As soon as Bahá’u’lláh
came back to Baghdad from His retirement in Kurdistan, He
arose to regenerate the Bábí community. This Tablet was
probably written in this time and can be numbered among the
many exhortations He addressed to the Bábís to renew and
readdress their faith.

The Tablet to Mullá ‘Alí-Akbar a s a path
towards r eunion with th e Lord

Mullá ‘Alí-Akbar, a devote follower of the Báb, who had
endured a harsh persecution on His path, is now “immersed in
the seas of doubt and passion” (T1) and Bahá’u’lláh wants to
purge him “from the defilement of the superstitious” (T1). He
“droneth round the Fire” (T2) and his position is so grievous
that, as Bahá’u’lláh writes, “the whirlwinds of wrath and the
tempests of rage were ready to blow from thy doubts upon all
beings. Fear thou God, then beg thou forgiveness seventy times,
so that He may forgive thee by His grace” (T6). Despite his
errors, Bahá’u’lláh consoles him saying that if he will put his
trust in God and will be God-fearing, God will turn that Fire
into “a light for… [him], and a mercy upon… [him], and a safety
to the worlds” (T2). His doubts depend on the fact that he relies
on human beings, who are as fallible as he is, whereas he should
rely only on the guidance of the Manifestation of God. This
teaching, later codified as “free and independent search after
truth,” occupies a central position among Bahá’u’lláh’s
teachings. As early as in the Seven Valleys He writes: “O My
Brother, journey upon these planes in the spirit of search

Lights of ‘Irfán Book Nine                                    325

(ta˙qíq), not in blind imitation (taqlíd) A true wayfarer will not
be kept back by the bludgeon of words (kalamát), nor debarred
by the warning of allusions (ishárat)” (SV 24, Haft Vádí 116).
Mullá ‘Alí-Akbar has thus fallen into error because he did not
purify his “heart from all allusions (ishárat)… and from the
words (kalamát) of the people of the Qur’án” (T7). He should
rather look “with… [his] inward eyes the proof through which…
[his] faith hath been previously confirmed”, he should not
“question anyone about this,” and should be content “with what
is revealed on the part of… [his] Lord” (T7). In the days of
God’s revelation, most religious leaders are “wrapt in the dense
veils of the self and are among the heedless. And whosoever
questions such people as these is like unto one born blind who
questions another born blind” (T7). Bahá’u’lláh writes to Mullá
‘Alí-Akbar that He has perceived from him “the flavor of the
ancient allusions (ishárat) of them to whom the Qur’án was
given, allusions about references to the vicegerency (wißáyyat)…
wherefore… [he] was saddened” (T9). He adds: “Hast thou not
heard that He liveth in the All-Glorious Horizon and hath no
need of a vicegerent (waßí) after His Revelation?” (T10).

The concepts of vicegerent and vicegerency mentioned in this
sentence deserve an explanation. The Encyclopaedia of Islam
defines the word waßí as “a theological term in Shí‘ism variously
rendered as legatee, executor, successor or inheritor” and
explains that it “was first used to designate ‘Alí as the inheritor
of Muhammad’s worldly possessions (such as his books and
weapons) and of his political and spiritual authority” and later
on to designate “al-Óasan and the other imáms, all of whom are
awßiyá’” (Kohlberg). This concept is very important, because
the waßí is the One who comes after the Manifestation of God
and is invested with the authority of guiding the community in
its pursuing the goals set by the Manifestation of God. An
incomplete understanding of this concept in the past has given
rise throughout the centuries to many divisions in religions born
to be instruments of spiritual unity.

In the years when Bahá’ú’lláh addressed this Tablet to Mullá
‘Alí-Akbar the Bábí community did not know who was the
vicegerent/successor (waßí) of the Báb, because, as Shoghi
Effendi points out, “a successor or vicegerent the Báb never
named, an interpreter of His teachings He refrained from
appointing” (GPB 28). He had, instead, written in the Persian
Bayán: “apparently, since in this cycle neither prophets (nabí)
nor vicegerents (waßí) were mentioned, [these titles] are ascribed
to the believers, till the Day of Resurrection when each will call
the Tree if Reality as he will like to (va dar Ωaváhir chunkih

dhikr-i-nabí va vaßí dar ín kuúr ni-mí-gardad, bi-muminín i láq
mí-shavad, illá yawm-i-qiyámat kih har-kas rá shajjariy-i-
Óaqíqat bi har ism kih khawhad dhikr mí-kunad)» (6:14).
However, Mírzá Ya˙yá, who, as has been said, the Báb had
simply named “a figure-head pending the manifestation of the
Promised One” (GPB 28-9), surreptitiously suggested that he
was the successor of the Báb. He openly claimed this station
only in the Adrianople period (1863-1868), when he began
proclaiming to be the “successor of the Báb (vaßíy-i-musallam,
lit. indisputable vigerent),” and to pride himself “on his high
sounding titles of Mir’atu’l-Azaliyyih (Everlasting Mirror), of
Subh-i-Azal (Morning of Eternity), and of Ismu’l-Azal (Name of
Eternity) (GPB 114, Kitáb-i-qarn-i-badí‘ 241). Therefore
Bahá’u’lláh explained in His “Law˙-i-Siráj,” revealed in
Adrianople:

> In these days the leaders of the Bayán foolishly quote and
> have quoted, to demonstrate their truth, the same proofs
> that were quoted by the worst of the people of the
> Qur’án, for instance, the concept of vice-regency
> (vißáyat), a concept that My previous Manifestation has
> utterly effaced from the Book, as everyone knows, and
> beside the Letters and the Mirrors nothing has been
> revealed by the Pen of the Merciful in the Bayán. (7: 40-1,
> provisional translation by the authors)
It seems that Bahá’u’lláh intends here to warn Mullá ‘Alí-Akbar
against the nefarious influence of Mírzá Ya˙yá and his
upholders. Bahá’u’lláh confirms His previous words thus:

> Yeah, God hath mirrors (maráyá) for Himself wherein He
> may shine to themselves for themselves, if they are placed
> before the sun and its rays… And they speak of the
> splendor of the sun, if they are placed before it and if they
> remain where they were beforehand. When they depart, the
> light returns unto its source and place, and with the
mirrors the veils remain. (T11)

These words also deserve an explanation. The Báb had named
a “hierarchy (marátib-i-rú˙ání, lit. spiritual grades)” of
“‘Mirrors’ (maráyá)… ‘Guides’ (adillá) and ‘Witnesses’
(shuhadá),” but all these people “had either been put to the
sword, or hounded from their native soil, or bludgeoned into
silence” (GPB 89, Kitáb-i-qarn-i-badí‘ 200). Bahá’u’lláh now
states that the authority conferred by the Manifestation of God
to His hierarchy also depends on their faithfulness. If they turn
their back to His guidance, they lose any authority. This

Lights of ‘Irfán Book Nine                                     327

happened to Bahá’u’lláh’s son, Mu˙ammad-‘Alí (1853-1937, see
Taherzadeh, Covenant 125). He had been chosen to succeed
‘Abdu’l-Bahá in the leadership of the Bahá’í community. But
since he rebelled against the will of his Father, he lost all his
rights, according to Bahá’u’lláh’s words: “‘Should he for a
moment pass out from under the shadow of the Cause, he surely
shall be brought to naught’.” (qtd. in WT 6).

Bahá’u’lláh also explains that the station (maqám) of “true
believer (mawqin)”

> is not specially set aside for anyone at the exception of
> any other one. By God, the True One, in this Day should
> all creatures turn themselves towards the lights of the sun
> that shine above the All-Glorious Horizon with the
> ornament of God, the Omnipotent, the Exalted, the
> Mighty, the splendor of the lights of the sun would be
> reflected in them and none would deny it, except those
> who are ignorant and far removed and other similar to
> them. (T11)
> The criterion is very simple: a “true believer” is whoever
turns his heart towards the Manifestation of God, “the sun that
shine[s] above the All-Glorious Horizon with the ornament of
God” (T11), and is able to conform to the following
exhortation:

> Beware lest thou lookest at Me through the eyes of anyone
> but Me and if thou wishest to know Me, look at Me
> through My eyes and thou wilt not know Me through
> anything but those, although thou ponderest so that thou
> mayest know Me till the end that none among the
> reckoners can reckon. (T12)
> This exhortation refers to a Muslim tradition, known as
˙adíth an-nawáfil (nawáfil, sing. náfilih, supererogatory prayer),
and also Óadíth at-taqarrub, that is, of the approaching to God
(taqarrub), that recites:

> Allah’s Apostle said, ‘Allah said, “I will declare war against
> him who shows hostility to a pious worshipper of Mine.
> And the most beloved things with which My slave comes
> nearer to Me, is what I have enjoined upon him; and My
> slave keeps on coming closer to Me through performing
> Nawafil (praying or doing extra deeds besides what is
> obligatory) till I love him, so I become his sense of hearing
> with which he hears, and his sense of sight with which he
> sees, and his hand with which he grips, and his leg with

> which he walks; and if he asks Me, I will give him, and if
> he asks My protection (Refuge), I will protect him; (i.e.,
> give him My Refuge) and I do not hesitate to do anything
> as I hesitate to take the soul of the believer, for he hates
> death, and I hate to disappoint him.”’ (al-Bukhárí, ßa˙í˙
8.76.509; see Furúzánfar, A˙adíth, no. 148)

This tradition implies that a seeker who strictly adheres to the
religious laws will be able to approach to God to the point that
he will lose his own qualities and acquire His attributes. This
condition opens the eye of the heart, that is the capacity of
perceiving spiritual reality, beyond any mental and intellectual
category, and opens the way towards higher levels of spiritual
progress. In this condition the spiritual seeker is capable of
recognizing the Manifestation of God as disguised as he may
appear.

The “R eunion Prayer”

At this point the second part of the Tablet to Jináb-i-Mullá
‘Alí-Akbar fí Ar∂i’l-Álif begins, known in the Arab and Persian-
speaking worlds as ßalát-i-˙ájat, the prayer of the needs. This
name may have been inspired by the following words at the end
of the Tablet:

> I swear by the life of Him Whom God shall make manifest,
> whoever performs this action wholly for the sake of his
> Lord and rid of all attachment to all else except Him,
> verily God can satisfy his wants (hawá’ij, pl. di ˙ájat) and
> shall raise him up on the day of resurrection in such wise
> that the company of the favoured angels will be
bewildered. (28)

The Bahá’í scholar ‘Abdu’l-Óamíd Ishráq Khávarí (1902-
1972), who quotes this prayer in his celebrated anthology of
Bahá’í writings entitled Má’idiy-i-Ásmání, summarized these
words as follows: “Let him then raise his head, and ask from
God whatever he desireth (Óájat-i-khud)” (7:135). Bahá’u’lláh
also adds:

> Verily, We have instructed and warned thee, that thou
> mayest attain unto the presence (liqá’) of thy Lord and
> mayest not be deprived of what is better for thee than the
treasures of the heavens and the earth. (T28)

Therefore this prayer may also be considered as a prayer
asking God for the greatest bounty: arriving at the presence of,
and recognizing His Manifestation in His Day. The meaning of

Lights of ‘Irfán Book Nine                                  329

the “Presence of God,” or reunion with God is explained in the
Kitáb-i-ˆqán:

> whosoever, and in whatever Dispensation, hath recognized
> and attained unto the presence of these glorious, these
> resplendent and most excellent Luminaries, hath verily
> attained unto the “Presence of God (liqá’u’lláh)” Himself,
> and entered the city of eternal and immortal life. (KI 142,
> ¶ 151, Kitáb-i-Musta áb 111)
Therefore this prayer may be also called ßalat-i-Liqá’, the
“Reunion Prayer.” It is an invitation to the mystic nuptials with
the Lord, “the Best-Beloved of every understanding heart” (PM
104, no. LXV, ¶ 2).

In this perspective, the instructions comprised in this prayer
become reminiscent of such ancient, or even modern, rituals as
the vestition of the bride to be presented to her groom in the
day of their wedding or the vestition of the priest before his
celebration of a rite. First, detaching oneself “from all things”
(T13), performing the “ablutions with clear and pure water”
(T13), hands and face (T14, 15), perfuming oneself and wearing
the best clothes (T17), then turning towards the Qiblih (T17),
standing “firm” in one’s “place” (T18), “with manifest poise and
dignity” (T18), then raising one’s hands “towards God” (T18)
and taking “three paces forward” towards the ideal reunion
place (T20, 22, 24), then prostrating oneself before His beauty
(T26), and finally silently invoking Him from one’s innermost
heart (T28).

Mystical meanings can also be ascribed to the prescriptions
contained in this prayer. They may be read as a description of
the mystical path leading towards the reunion with the Divine.
Detaching oneself “from all things” and performing the
ablutions is a clear reference to the purifying connotations of
the purgative way. Perfuming oneself and wearing the best
clothes is a preparation to the acquisition of virtues, an
acquisition that is perfected while invoking God that He may
turn the simple acts performed by one’s body into inner
attitudes of purification and expression of fragrant virtues,
typical of the illuminative way. The illumination is realized in
“three paces” (T20), each referring to a different Manifestation
of God. The first step refers to Moses, seemingly a symbol of
detachment from the world of names and of the capacity of
seeing God in each part of creation (T21). The second step
refers to Jesus, seemingly a symbol of teaching the Faith, of
detachment from the world of Attributes and spiritual

resurrection (T23). The third step refers to all the Prophets and
the Chosen Ones (T25), seemingly anticipating the entrance into
the Paradise of His Presence, a station in which the
Manifestations of God “are all invested with the robe of
Prophethood, and honoured with the mantle of glory”
(Bahá’u’lláh, KI 152, ¶ 161). Here one comes closer to the apex
of the mystical way, the unitive way, followed by a prostration,
a physical sign of the recognition of one’s nothingness, in one’s
praise of God. At last, the final invocation, asking that one may
avoid the risk of not understanding the signs of God:

> I beseech Thee, O my God… not to reckon me among them
> who heard Thy voice and failed to answer Thy call, or
> them unto whom Thou hast revealed Thy Being in Thy
> most exalted manifestation and glorious splendour, and
> did not obey Thee. (T27)
> This invocation is reminiscent of the fact the one’s spiritual
progress on earth is always uncertain:

> How often hath a sinner attained, at the hour of death, to
> the essence of faith, and, quaffing the immortal draught,
> hath taken his flight unto the Concourse on high! And how
> often hath a devout believer, at the hour of his soul’s
> ascension, been so changed as to fall into the nethermost
fire! (KI 194, ¶ 214)

Therefore this prayer may also be called the “Reunion
Prayer,” in remembrance of the following advice by ‘Abdu’l-
Bahá: “Beseech thou from God’s infinite grace whatsoever thou
desirest. But wert thou to heed my advice thou wouldst desire
naught save entrance into the Abhá Kingdom” (in CC 2:231, no.
1741).

Ritual s in th e “R eunion Prayer”

In the Bahá’í Faith rites, that is, established, ceremonious,
acts codified in the Holy Writings, are very few. The Universal
House of Justice explains that

> the Faith has certain simple rites prescribed by Bahá’u’lláh,
> such as the obligatory prayers, the marriage ceremony and
> the laws for the burial of the dead, but its teachings warn
> against developing them into a system of uniform and
> rigid rituals incorporating man-made forms of practices,
> such as exists in other religions where rituals usually
> consist of elaborate ceremonial practices performed by a
> member of the clergy… (on behalf of the Universal House

> of Justice, 16 October 1979, in LG 478, no. 1573).

The rites associated with the “Reunion Prayer”, seemingly
uncommon in the Bahá’í Writings, are thus an exception in the
Bahá’í religious world. These rites are in part similar to those
associated with the Obligatory Prayers, with a few differences.

‘Abdu’l-Bahá states that “in every word and movement of the
obligatory prayer there are allusions, mysteries and a wisdom
that man is unable to comprehend, and letters and scrolls cannot
contain” (in CC 2:233, no. 1748). And Shoghi Effendi explains
that the “very few and simple” regulations associated with the
Obligatory Prayers “are of a great spiritual help to the
individual believer, in that they help him to fully concentrate
when praying and meditating. Their significance is thus purely
spiritual” (on behalf of Shoghi Effendi, 5 November 1934, in
CC 2:237, no. 1759). The spiritual meanings of the physical
gestures that a person, spontaneously or conforming to a
prescribed rituals, performs during the prayer are also
recognized in the Christian world. The hypertext La formazione
permanente “paradigma” della formazione iniziale (Permanent
Training: Paradigm of the Early Training) devotes an entire
chapter to “The Body in Prayer.” It writes:

> The golden rule of the body’s integration into prayer is… a

> towards God.

Performing the ablutions, turning towards the Qiblih,
standing, raising one’s hands and prostrating are part of the
rites of the daily Obligatory Prayers and of the repetition of the
Greatest Name 95 times a day. Perfuming oneself, wearing a fine
dress and advancing towards the Qiblih are new and typical of
this prayer. Also the explicit prescriptions of an attitude of
detachment “from all things” (T13) and of “manifest poise and
dignity” (T18) are typical of this prayer.
“perform ablutions with clear and pure water…” (T13)

Ablutions as a purification rite are a feature of many

religions. The Bible for example prescribes that the priests
“when they go into the tabernacle of the congregation, they
shall wash with water, that they die not; or when they come near
to the altar to minister, to burn offering made by fire unto the
Lord” (Exodus 30:20, KJB). Another form of ablution among
the Jews is the total immersion of one’s body in a pool filled
with running water, called mikvah or mikveh, to become
purified from such previous defilements, as for example a
menstrual cycle, a childbirth, a nocturnal emission, or coming
into contact with the dead or other ritually unclean objects.
Christians use ablutions in the baptism rite, supposedly going
back to the Pentecost Day (see Facts 2:38), in the rite of the
washing of the feet in Maundy Thursday, as a remembrance of
what Jesus did in the Last Supper (see John 13:4-5) and,
symbolically, in the lavabo rite, when the priest washes his
fingers with water while celebrating the Mass. Early Christians
used to wash their hands before praying, either during a
common rite or individually, in obedience to Paul’s exhortation
“I will therefore that men pray every where, lifting up holy
hands, without wrath and doubting” (1 Timothy 2:8). Muslims
use ablutions (wudú), hands and face, as a preparation to their
Daily Obligatory Prayers.

Bahá’í ablutions consist in washing the hands and the face in
preparation for prayer (see KA 182, n34). The water should be
pure, that is it should not be changed in colour, taste or smell
(see ibid. 212, n105). The essential features of Bahá’í ablutions
may be found in Shoghi Effendi’s “Synopsis and Codification of
the Laws and Ordinances of the Kitáb-i-Aqdas.” The relevant
part is reproduced, integrated, in the footnotes, with
explanations given in note 34 of the Kitáb-i-Aqdas’ text.
a) Ablutions must precede the recital of the Obligatory Prayers.
b) For every Obligatory Prayer fresh ablutions must be

performed.
c) Should two Obligatory Prayers be offered at noon one

ablution for both prayers is sufficient.
d) If water is unavailable or its use harmful to the face or hands,

> the repetition, five times, of a specifically revealed verse is
> prescribed.
e) Should the weather be too cold the use of warm water is

recommended.
f) If ablutions have been performed for other purposes, their

> renewal prior to the recital of the Obligatory Prayer is not
> required.
g) Ablutions are essential whether a bath has been taken

previously or not. (KA 36)
“turn thy face towards the Sanctuary of God [Qiblih,
t.n.]” (T17)

The Qiblih (from the Arabic root qabila, to turn toward) is
“the ‘Point of Adoration’, that is, the point to which the
worshipper should turn when offering obligatory prayer” (in KA
n34). Turning towards a direction considered as holy while
praying is a common feature of many religions. The Jews pray
turning towards the sancta sanctorum of Jerusalem Temple.
Early Christians residing in Europe prayed turned towards East,
that is, towards Jerusalem. In the Moslem world, initially the
Qiblih was Jerusalem, but Mu˙ammad changed it later to Mecca
and the Kaaba Shrine (see Koran 2:142-4).

The Bahá’í Qiblih is appointed in the Kitáb-i-Aqdas and in
“Questions and Answers”:

> Fear ye the Most Merciful and consider what He hath
> revealed in another passage. He said: “The Qiblih is indeed
> He Whom God will make manifest; whenever He moveth,
> it moveth, until He shall come to rest.” Thus was it set
> down by the Supreme Ordainer when He desired to make
> mention of this Most Great Beauty. (KA 68, ¶ 137)
> ANSWER: Facing in the direction of the Qiblih is a fixed
> requirement for the recitation of obligatory prayer, but
> for other prayers and devotions one may follow what the
> merciful Lord hath revealed in the Qur’án: “Whichever
> way ye turn, there is the face of God.” (KA 111, D14)
Shoghi Effendi explains that this orientation is

> a physical symbol of an inner reality, just as the plant
> stretches out to the sunlight—from which it receives life
> and growth—so we turn our hearts to the Manifestation of
> God, Bahá’u’lláh, when we pray; and we turn our faces,
> during this short prayer, to where His dust lies on this
> earth as a symbol of the inner act. (on behalf of Shoghi
> Effendi, 24 June 1949, in CC 2:243, no. 1780)
“stand firm on your place” (T18)

People of all religions stand while praying, an attitude

denoting respect in many cultures. Jews stand while reciting the
19 blessings of the most important prayer in their liturgy,
Amidah (standing prayer), and face the sancta sanctorum of
Jerusalem Temple. Christians usually pray in their knees and
with their hands joined. However, Catholics stand up, as a sign
of special reverence, while listening to the words of the Bible
during the Mass. The hypertext La formazione permanente
explains that “the attitude of standing up while praying is
emphasized in early Christianity as a sign of freedom, of
priesthood, of participation to the resurrection of the Lord.
Therefore it was forbidden praying on one’s knees in Easter
Time.” Muslims stand up at the beginning of each “unity
(rak’ah)” forming the Daily Obligatory Prayer (ßalat).

In His “Reunion Prayer” Bahá’u’lláh says: “stand firm on
your place (qum mustaqarran)” (T18) as in the Long Obligatory
Prayer prescribes: “let him stand erect (yaqúma mustaqíman) and
say” (KA 95, Arabic edition 35). The spiritual meaning of this
physical gesture in the “Reunion Prayer” may be better
understood in the light of Bahá’u’lláh’s own words. For
example: “Thou seest Thy handmaiden, O my God, standing
(qámat) before the habitation of Thy mercy” (Prayers and
Meditation 147, Munáját 101), “Thou seest, O my Lord, Thy
suppliant waiting (qá’iman) at the door of Thy bounty” (Prayers
and Meditation 265, Munáját 178), “Aid me, O my Lord… to
stand (al-qíyam) humbly at His door” (Prayers and Meditation
209, Munáját 142) and “I have stood (qumtu) at the door of Thy
grace with utter self-effacement and complete abnegation”
(Prayers and Meditation 55, Munáját 43). These words suggest
the idea of a vassal presenting himself to his sovereign to both
render homage and invoke his grace. Last but not least,
Bahá’u’lláh repeatedly quotes Koran 83:6: “‘The Day when
mankind shall stand before the Lord of the worlds (yaqúmu an-
nás li-rabbi’l-‘alamín)’,” a verse alluding to the eschatological
meeting with the Lord on the Day of Judgment, a verse fitting
with the concept of this prayer as “Reunion Prayer.”
“raise thy hands towards God” (T18)

The meaning of praying with raised hands as both a request
for assistance and an expression of praise is intuitive and thus is
a feature of many religions. Psalm 141:2 recites: “Let my prayer
be set forth before thee as incense; and the lifting up of my
hands as the evening sacrifice.” Catholics raise their hands while
praying according to the following verse: “I will therefore that
men pray every where, lifting up holy hands, without wrath and
doubting” (1 Timothy 2:8). The hypertext La formazione

permanente elucidates this gesture as follows:

> All religions value the praying language of the hands.
> Hands raise towards the Lord in a searching (Psalms 62:5)
> or an offering attitude (Psalms 140:2), raised hands denote
> the evening sacrifice, open hands signify an attitude of
> intercession, according to Paul’s advice (1 Timothy 2:8).
> Raised hands also are a sign of sacrificial offering...
> …The Odes of Solomon remember the primitive meaning
> of this gesture: “I extended my hands and hallowed my
> Lord, For the expansion of my hands is His sign. And my
> extension is the upright cross. Hallelujah” (nos. 27 and
> 42).

Muslims raise their hands, upward towards the face, four
times during each Daily Obligatory Prayer. Bahá’ís are invited to
raise their hands in both their Medium and Long Obligatory
Prayer. In the Medium Obligatory Prayer Bahá’u’lláh specifies
that palms should be “upward toward the face” (KA 99) in the
Muslim way, an instruction that is not repeated anywhere else.
All the inner meanings of this gesture are confirmed in
Bahá’u’lláh’s words. In one of His prayers for the Fast He
writes: “And these are my hands, O my Lord, uplifted toward
the heaven of Thy favor and tender mercy. Wilt Thou, then,
turn away this poor one…?” (in Importance, sec. 3, no. IV).
Other references to hands raised in a supplicating attitude are:
“Thou beholdest how… my hands are stretched out unto the
heaven of Thy bestowals” (PM 182-3, no. CIX, ¶ 1) and “Thou
seest, O my Lord, how… my hands [are] raised up towards the
heaven of Thy bounty and favor” (Prayers and Meditations 270,
no. CLXXVI, ¶ 9).
“fall down upon the ground” (T26)

Jews and Christians prostrate rarely. Jews call prostration
nefillat appayim, that means “falling on one’s face.” They
prostate for example while reciting the liturgical poem known
as Aleynu (we must) concluding the musaf (Additional offering
or prayer) in the holy days of Rosh HaShanah and Yom Kippur.
In the Catholic liturgy prostration (prone, sometimes with
outstretched arms) is used during the imposition of the Holy
Orders and during the liturgy of Good Friday. The Catechism of
the Catholic Church explains:

> Adoration is the first attitude of man acknowledging that
> he is a creature before his Creator. It exalts the greatness
> of the Lord who made us [Cf. Psalms 95:1-6] and the

> almighty power of the Savior who sets us free from evil.
> Adoration is homage of the spirit to the “King of Glory”
> [Psalms 24:9-10], respectful silence in the presence of the
“ever greater” God. (par. 2628)

The hypertext La formazione permanente explains
prostration as follows: “Full prostration, prone… is a sign of
utter humility before God, of a physical contact with the earth
from which we come, of utter surrender in our adoration of
God.” Muslim prostration (sujúd), used to glorify and praise
God, is part of the rites of the Daily Obligatory Prayer at the
end of each of its unities (rak’at).
The simple rules of Bahá’í prostration are explained in the
Kitáb-i-Aqdas:

> God hath granted you leave to prostrate yourselves on any
> surface that is clean, for We have removed in this regard
> the limitation that had been laid down in the Book; God,
> indeed, hath knowledge of that whereof ye know naught.

(KA 22, ¶ 10)
The spiritual meaning of this Bahá’í ritual act seems clear:
recognizing one’s nothingness before the Omnipotent Lord.
Bahá’u’lláh writes:

> Behold me, then, O my God, fallen prostrate upon the dust
> before Thee, confessing my powerlessness and Thine
> omnipotence, my poverty and Thy wealth, mine
> evanescence and Thine eternity, mine utter abasement and
> Thine infinite glory. (PM 90, no. LVIII, ¶ 5)
> …when they beheld the lights of Thy countenance, they set
> their faces towards Thee, and prostrated themselves before
> Thy beauty, submissive to Thy greatness and severed from
> all things besides Thee. (in Importance, sec. 3, no. VI)
“perfume thyself” (T17)

Ancient Jews used incense and they had a special altar made
“of shittim wood” (Exodus 30:1) to burn incense upon it.
Exodus 30:22-29 describes the four “principal spices” that
should be used to perfume the oil of the sacred anointment,
employed to consecrate the shrine and the priests: “pure myrrh…
sweet cinnamon… sweet calamus… cassia.” Whoever took part
to divine worship was asked to “give… a sweet savour as
frankincense, and flourish as a lily, and send forth a [good]
smell” (Sirach 39:14). Christians also burn incense in the course

of several rites. Catholic priests incense the altar at the
beginning of the Mass, burn incense at the elevation of the
Sacred Host and the chalice after the consecration. Muslims
perfume their bodies at the beginning of their pilgrimage to
Mecca after having performed the specific ablutions and before
they wear the special pilgrim garment. After that they cannot
use any perfume. Muslims wear their best clothes and use
perfumes whenever they meet a specially respected person. An
episode of the Bahá’í history, reminiscent of this use, is
described by Shoghi Effendi as follows:

> One night, aware that the hour of her [ áhirih’s] death was
> at hand, she put on the attire of a bride, and annointed
> herself with perfume, and, sending for the wife of the
> Kalantar, she communicated to her the secret of her
> impending martyrdom, and confided to her her last wishes.
> Then, closeting herself in her chambers, she awaited, in
> prayer and meditation, the hour which was to witness her
> reunion with her Beloved. (GPB 74)
Wearing clean and perfumed dresses is a prescription of the
Kitáb-i-Aqdas:

> God hath enjoined upon you to observe the utmost
> cleanliness, to the extent of washing what is soiled with
> dust, let alone with hardened dirt and similar defilement.
> Fear Him, and be of those who are pure. Should the garb
> of anyone be visibly sullied, his prayers shall not ascend to
> God, and the celestial Concourse will turn away from him.
> Make use of rose-water, and of pure perfume; this, indeed,
> is that which God hath loved from the beginning that hath
> no beginning, in order that there may be diffused from
> you what your Lord, the Incomparable, the All-Wise,
> desireth. (KA 47, ¶ 76)
The meaning of this prescription may be better understood in
the light of the following words by ‘Abdu’l-Bahá:

> It is even as a voice wondrously sweet, or a melody played:
> although sounds are but vibrations in the air which affect
> the ear’s auditory nerve, and these vibrations are but
> chance phenomena carried along through the air, even so,
> see how they move the heart. A wondrous melody is wings
> for the spirit, and maketh the soul to tremble for joy. The
> purport is that physical cleanliness doth also exert its
> effect upon the human soul. (SWAB 146, ¶ 129)
> This special rite has also purely spiritual meanings, as may be

deduced from even a superficial search in Bahá’u’lláh’s writings.
He writes for example: “This is the Day whereon every sweet
smelling thing hath derived its fragrance from the smell of My
garment—a garment that hath shed its perfume upon the whole
of creation” (GWB 29, sec. XIV, ¶ 6). If the word “garment” is
interpreted as “the Divine Revelation,” the spiritual meaning of
the act of perfuming oneself become more clear. Bahá’u’lláh
mentions “the smell of the love of Thy Lord” (GWB 283, sec.
CXXIX, ¶ 10), “the sweet savors of holiness” (GWB 304, sec.
CXXXIX, ¶ 8), “the sweet smelling savor of purity and
holiness” (GWB 306, sec. CXLI, ¶ 4). He also raises the
following prayer for his beloved ones:

> Empower them also, O my God, to be as the rain that
> poureth down from the clouds of Thy grace, and as the
> winds that waft the vernal fragrances of Thy loving-
> kindness, that through them the soil of the hearts of Thy
> creatures may be clad with verdure, and may bring forth
> the things that will shed their fragrance over all Thy
> dominion, so that every one may perceive the sweet smell
of the Robe of Thy Revelation. (PM 190, no. CXIII, ¶ 2)

Thus perfuming oneself may be a symbol of an inner attitude
of spiritual radiance, of living a virtuous life.

The prescription of using perfumes and wearing beautiful
clothes is part of the elaborated rituals prescribed for the
pilgrimage to the Houses of Bahá’u’lláh in Baghdad and of the
Báb in Shíráz, rituals which are not yet obligatory for the
present generations of Bahá’ís. As to the former, Bahá’u’lláh
writes: “And when he [the pilgrim] reacheth it, let him put on
his best clothes and then perform ablutions as God hath
commanded him” (qtd. in MacEoin 155). As to the latter, He
writes: “make use of the best of perfumes, then put on the best
clothes you are able to afford” (qtd. ibid. 155).
“attire thyself with thy finest raiment” (T17)

Wearing special clothes in certain occasions is part of Jewish,
Christian and Muslim rituals. Jews wear the tallit and the
kippah. The tallit, the prayer shawl, is a rectangular piece of
cloth, of various dimensions, usually white, more or less
decorated, characterized by special fringes known as tzittzit
attached to its four corners. The tallit is worn by any observant
Jewish male above 13 years, who is a “son of the
commandment” (bar mitzvah), that is, has become obligated to
observe the commandments. These fringes are prescribed so that

the people wearing them “ may look upon it, and remember all
the commandments of the Lord, and do them” (Numbers 15:39).
The kippah is a skullcap traditionally worn by all observant
Jewish men in worship places, as a sign that they recognize the
superiority of God, that they accept the 613 commandments
(mitzvot), that they identify themselves with the Jewish people.
Both the tallit and the kippah are a sign that one is a Jew.
Christian priests wear special paraments when they celebrate any
religious function. These vestments are different in the
different celebrated rites. Christians wear special clothes when
they receive such Sacraments, as Baptism, “First Holy
Communion,” Confirmation and Marriage (in the latter case,
specially women). Muslim males wear a special garment (i˙rám)
during the days of their pilgrimage to Mecca. The Muslim
pilgrim garment is made of three elements: two clean, white and
unhemmed sheets and a pair of sandals. One of the sheets is
wrapped around the loins below the breast (izár), the other is
thrown over the left shoulder (ridá). The two sheets are secured
by a white belt. The sandals must not cover the ankles. The
pilgrim garment iÓrám is a symbol of purity, of renunciation to
evil and earthly possessions and of the equality of human beings
before God.

Some of the symbolical meanings of clothes in the Bahá’í
world may be better understood in the light of the following
words by Bahá’u’lláh:

> From among all created things He hath singled out for His
> special favor the pure, the gem-like reality of man, and
> invested it with a unique capacity of knowing Him and of
> reflecting the greatness of His glory. This twofold
> distinction conferred upon him hath cleansed away from
> his heart the rust of every vain desire, and made him
> worthy of the vesture with which his Creator hath deigned
> to clothe him. It hath served to rescue his soul from the
> wretchedness of ignorance.
> This robe with which the body and soul of man hath been
> adorned is the very foundation of his well-being and
> development. Oh, how blessed the day when, aided by the
> grace and might of the one true God, man will have freed
> himself from the bondage and corruption of the world and
> all that is therein, and will have attained unto true and
> abiding rest beneath the shadow of the Tree of Knowledge!
> (GWB 77-8, sec. XXXIV, ¶ 1-2)
> The “robe” of human beings is seemingly the body of their

spiritual endowments, here described as their “unique capacity
of knowing Him and of reflecting the greatness of His glory.”
Bahá’u’lláh in His typical use of the metaphorical genitive
associates the word “cloth” or similar with various spiritual
attributes: the raiment of “fear of God” (GWB 290, sec.
CXXXIV, ¶ 3), the “robe of forbearance and justice” (GWB
304, sec. CXXXIX, ¶ 8), “the vesture of forgiveness and
bounty” (TB 69), “the robe of righteousness” (TB 59), “the
vesture of true wisdom” (TB 166), “the raiment of goodly
deeds” (TB 178, KA 46, ¶ 73), “the vesture of high endeavour”
(TB 257). Finally, the “metaphor of the fragrant ‘garment’ is
frequently used in the Bahá’í Writings to refer to the
recognition of the Manifestation of God and His Revelation”
(in KA 164, n1). In this vein the Kitáb-i-ˆqán says: “God grant
that through His gracious and invisible assistance, thou mayest
divest thy body and soul of the old garment, and array thyself
with the new and imperishable attire” (KI 158, ¶ 168). This
condition is explained by ‘Abdu’l-Bahá as follows: “As regards
the teachers, they must completely divest themselves from the
old garments and be invested with a new garment. According to
the statement of Christ, they must attain to the station of
rebirth—that is, whereas in the first instance they were born
from the womb of the mother, this time they must be born
from the womb of the world of nature” (TDP 96). This
explanation is perfectly suitable to the “Reunion Prayer.”

“take three paces forward, turning tow ards God” (T20)

Procession is a very common rite in the Christian world. It
provides for its participants to move along on a particular
course in a devotional attitude. A Jew procession is the
circumambulation of the Torah Scrolls (haqqafa), typical of the
festivals of Sukkot, the Feast of Tabernacles. In the first six
days of the nine days of this festival every day a circuit is made
by the worshippers around the Torah Scrolls. The seventh day
nine circuits are made, while chanting poetical hymns,
comprising an invocation of personal and community salvation
from any natural or social danger and from the hostility of the
enemies and a remembrance of the greatness of patriarchs and
great historical personages. Christian processions comprise
priests and faithful, provide for hymns, psalmodies and litanies,
the participants sometimes follow a statue or a sacred icon.
Processions are done by Catholics in Palm Sundays, falling on
the Sunday before Easter, as a remembrance of the triumphal
entry of Jesus into Jerusalem the days before His Passion, and
in the festivity of “Corpus Domini,” recurring sixty days after

Easter, when the Church celebrates “Corpus Domini,” the
Eucharist, the body—corpus—of Christ in the sacramental sign
of bread. Muslims circumambulate the Ka’bah seven times, in a
counter-clockwise direction (tawáf), during their Pilgrimage.
Muslim pilgrims also run seven times back and forth between
the two little hills of Safa and Marwa located near the Ka’ba
(say’). These are the two hills where Hagar ran in search of water
for her son Ishmael, a water that then miraculously gushed forth
from the fount of Zemzem. Shiites do a procession during the
day of ‘áshúrá, commemorating the martyrdom of the Imam
Óusayn which took place on 10 October 680 ce at Karbala.

Taking three steps towards the Qiblih, as prescribed in the
“Reunion Prayer,” seems to be a symbol of the gradualness of
spiritual growth. Bahá’u’lláh often describes spiritual lovers as
pilgrims gradually moving towards the goal of their hearts, the
Lord:

> O Son of Love! Thou art but one step away from the
> glorious heights above and from the celestial tree of love.
> Take thou one pace and with the next advance into the
> immortal realm and enter the pavilion of eternity. Give ear
> then to that which hath been revealed by the pen of glory.
> (HW 24, Persian no. 7)
> In this vein He mentions people who have directed their steps
“to the seat of Thy grace” (PM 118, no. LXXII, ¶ 3), “towards
Thy dearly-loved Sanctuary, and Thine adored and hallowed
Court” (PM 175, no. CV, ¶ 2), “towards the shores of Thy
oneness, confessing Thy singleness, acknowledging Thy unity,
and hoping for Thy forgiveness and pardon” (PM 221, no.
CXXXIV, ¶ 2), “towards the seat of Thy gracious favors” (PM
206, no. CXXI, ¶ 1), people whom nothing can hinder “from
directing… [their] steps towards the paths of Thy pleasure and
the ways of Thy Cause” (PM 204, no. CXX, ¶ 3). In this prayer
the three steps are seemingly a symbol of the lover’s gradual
advancement towards his Beloved One, through his adherence to
the Divine commandments.
“detach thyself from all things” (T13)

It is the first prescription by Bahá’u’lláh to Mullá ‘Alí-Akbar
and, as a ritual prescription, is typical of the Reunion Prayer.
Detachment, its qualities, prerequisites and effects are described
at length in Bahá’u’lláh’s writings.

As to its qualities, “the essence of detachment is for man to
turn his face towards the courts of the Lord, to enter His

Presence, behold His Countenance, and stand as witness before
Him” (TB 155). It is as “waters” flowing “out from the Supreme
Pen” (ESW 12); it is a “breath” (ESW 9), which a worshiper will
inhale if he were to ponder on whatever of Bahá’u’lláh’s prayers
he is reciting; and a “well-spring” from which one will “quaff
the wine of immortal life” (HW 41-2, Persian, no. 55).

As to its prerequisites, detachment is a “crown” with which
Gods adorns “the heads of… [His] loved ones” (TB 57); an
“atmosphere,” into which whosoever has quaffed “from the
fingers of… [His] bounteousness the living waters which have
enabled every one that hath partaken of them to rid himself of
all attachment to any one save… [God]” and to fix his “gaze
upon… [His] loving providence and… manifold gifts” (PM 240,
no. CL, ¶ 1) soars; a “light” which enlightens those who are
“ablaze with the fire of love and affection” (TB 74) and with
which God illumines the people He has attired “with the robe of
righteousness” (TB 59); an “ocean” upon whose shores “such
valiant souls as have passed beyond the sea of names… [pitch]
their tents” (TB 57-8); a “mead,” where those who have passed
“beyond the narrow retreats of… [their] evil and corrupt
desires” and have advanced “into the vast immensity of the
realm of God” abide (GWB 241, sec. CXV, ¶ 2); a “Horizon”
towards which people whose hearts have been brightened “with
the splendors of the light of… [His] knowledge” set their faces
(PM 275, no. CLXXVI, ¶ 23). Detachment is as “lofty heights”
attained by people who have quaffed “the wine of renunciation”
(KI 238, ¶ 267) and traversed “the vale of renunciation” (Gems
28, ¶ 38); an “atmosphere” where whosoever has quaffed “from
the fingers of… bounteousness the living waters which have
enabled [him] to rid himself of all attachment to any one save…
[Him]” (PM 240, no. CL, ¶ 1) soars.

As to its effects, detachment is a “breath” (ESW 9), which
would make one “have pity upon… [himself] and upon others”
(ESW 9); “a breath… which if it were to be breathed full upon
the world, all beings would renounce their lives, and sacrifice
their souls” (KI 232, ¶ 260). It is as “waters” that will “cleanse”
one’s soul (Summons 74, sec. 1, ¶ 143). It is a “Salsabil” that
cleanse the eye of him who drinks it from all veils (KI 74, ¶ 81);
“a court,” that when one enters it, he “casteth away all signs,
allusions, veils, and words, and beholdeth all things with an eye
illumined by the effulgent lights which God Himself hath shed
upon him... [and] seeth all differences return to a single word
and all allusions culminate in a single point” (Gems 29, ¶ 39).
The blessed beings flying on its “wings” soar “beyond all created
things” (KA 39, ¶ 54); wing their flight “towards the loftiest

summits of… creation” (PM 103, no. LXIV, ¶ 2); rise to such
heights that “neither the vain imaginations of the learned, nor
the multitude of the hosts of the earth… [succeed] in deflecting
[them] from His cause”; and attain “the station which, as
ordained by God, overshadoweth the entire creation” (GWB 34,
sec. XIV, no. 18). Detachment is man’s “true and abiding glory”
(SLH 47, sec. 1, ¶ 88) and “true adornment” (SLH 61, sec. 1, ¶
119); a “breeze” that God expects to be “wafted from the
meadows of… [human] hearts” (HW 38, Persian, no. 45); and a
“path” in which Bahá’u’lláh invites His lovers to demonstrate
what their “endeavors… will reveal” (HW 52), after He has
revealed his vivifying Word unto them.

No wonder, thus, that detachment is such an important
attitude for worshippers. Bahá’u’lláh writes: “whosoever
reciteth… [the Obligatory Prayer], even one time, with a
detached heart, will find himself wholly severed from the world”
(in Importance sec. 1, no. VIII). Being detached while praying is
also conducive to the greatest possible joy. As ‘Abdu’l-Bahá
writes:

> There is a pleasure in offering prayers that transcendeth all
> other pleasures, and there is a sweetness in chanting and
> singing the verses of God which is the greatest desire of all
> the believers, men and women alike. While reciting the
> Obligatory Prayer, one converseth intimately and shareth
> secrets with the true Beloved. No pleasure is greater than
> this, if one proceedeth with a detached soul, with tears
> overflowing, with a trusting heart and an eager spirit.
> Every joy is earthly save this one, the sweetness of which is
> divine. (in Importance sec. 2, no. XIII)
Last but not least, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá advises:

> When a man commenceth the recitation of the Obligatory
> Prayer, he should see himself severed from all created
> things and regard himself as utter nothingness before the
> will and purpose of God, in such wise that he seeth naught
> but Him in the world of being. This is the station of God’s
> well-favored ones and those who are wholly devoted to
> Him. Should one perform the Obligatory Prayer in this
> manner, he will be accounted by God and the Concourse
> on high among those who have truly offered the prayer. (in
> Importance sec. 1, no. IX)
> This sentence seems to explain one of the reasons why
detachment is prescribed while praying. It is an attitude
conducive to the reunion with God, typical of a person who has

come to the “Valley of Unity” and thus “looketh on all things
with the eye of oneness, and seeth the brilliant rays of the divine
sun shining from the dawning-point of Essence alike on all
created things, and the lights of singleness reflected over all
creation” (SV 18). This is also the station, to which Bahá’u’lláh
summons Mullá ‘Alí-Akbar just before revealing the Reunion
Prayer:

> Beware lest thou lookest at Me through the eyes of anyone
> but Me and if thou wishest to know Me, look at Me
> through My eyes and thou wilt not know Me through
> anything but those, although thou ponderest so that thou
> mayest know Me till the end that none among the
> reckoners can reckon.

“with manifest poise and dignity (waqár wa sukún)”
(T18)

Waqár is an Arabic word, deriving from the root waqara,
“He, or it was, or became, still or motionless” (Lane, s.v.
waqara). Wehr ascribes to this root also a connotation of
“reverence” (1276). Lane defines waqár as “gravity, staidness,
steadiness, and calmness” (s.v. waqara, waqár). Bahá’u’lláh
describes “the dignity (waqár)” of the “station” of human beings
(KA 63, ¶ 123, Arabic edition 117).”

Sukún is an Arabic word, deriving from the root sakana, “it
was, or became, still, calm, tranquilized, appeased, allayed…”
(Lane, s.v. sakana). Wehr translates sukún as “calm, tranquility,
peace” (488). Bahá’u’lláh refers to the Manifestations of God as
abiding “upon the throne of peace (sukún) and certitude” (KI
53, ¶ 57, Kitáb-i-Musta áb 41) and describes the “resignation
(taslím) and serenity (sukún)” (ESW 75, Law˙-i-Mubárak 55) of
the martyrs of the Faith before their torture-mongers, “the
rock-like stability (sukún) of… [His] chosen ones” (GWB 341,
sec. CLXIII, ¶ 2, Muntakhabátí 219), “the patience (ßabr), the
calm (sukún), the resignation (taslím) and contentment” (ESW
74-5, Law˙-i-Mubárak 55) of the Mázindarání Bábí.

The locution vaqár va sukún is used by Bahá’u’lláh while
describing the condition of the Bábí and Bahá’í martyrs, that He
defines as characterized by “ constancy… firmness…
steadfastness… certitude... imperturbability (tamkín) and…
dignity (vakár va sukún)” (ESW 87, Law˙-i-Mubárak 64).
‘Abdu’l-Bahá ascribes this attitude to Ustád Báqir and Ustád
AÓmad, two brothers natives of Káshán, that He describes as
“tranquil, dignified (vakár va sukún), confident, strong in faith,

sheltered by the All-Merciful” (Memorials 72, Tadhkirat 117),
while living as prisoners in ‘Akká.

Therefore, Bahá’u’lláh seemingly prescribes to Mullá ‘Alí-
Akbar an attitude worthy of “the dignity (vaqár)” of the station
of human beings (KA 63, ¶ 123, Arabic edition 117), a station
that requires them to submit “unto such restraints as will
protect… [them] from… [their] own ignorance, and guard…
[them] against the harm of the mischief-maker” (ibid.). In other
words Bahá’u’lláh prescribes him to be submitted to the divine
Will. At the same time He asks him to adopt the attitude of
“serenity,” “calm,” and “stability,” typical of individuals ready
to give their lives on His path.

This attitude is also recommend by Bahá’u’lláh for the
recitation of the Obligatory Prayer. He writes that the
worshipper should “regard himself as utter nothingness before
the will and purpose of God, in such wise that he seeth naught
but Him in the world of being” (in Importance, sec. 1, no. IX).
And ‘Abdu’l-Bahá explains that in this condition the worshipper
“holdeth communion with God, seeketh to draw near unto Him,
converseth with the true Beloved of one’s heart, and attaineth
spiritual stations” (in CC 2:232, no. 1744), that is, he has
realized that kind of prayer that Western mystics call
contemplation.

The sp ecial mean ing of th e “R eun ion Prayer”

> Bahá’u’lláh writes at the end of this prayer:
> I swear by the life of Him Whom God shall make manifest,
> whoever performs this action wholly for the sake of his
> Lord and rid of all attachment to all else except Him,
> verily God shall satisfy his wants and shall raise him up on
> the day of resurrection in such wise that the company of
> the favoured angels will be bewildered. (T28)
These words resemble the words of the more famous “Tablet of
AÓmad”: “Should one who is in affliction or grief read this
Tablet with absolute sincerity, God will dispel his sadness, solve
his difficulties and remove his afflictions” (BP 211).

The Bahá’ís associate the “Tablet of AÓmad” with the
following words by Shoghi Effendi:

> These daily obligatory prayers, together with a few other
> specific ones, such as the Healing Prayer, the Tablet of
> Ahmad, have been invested by Bahá’u’lláh with a special

> potency and significance, and should therefore be
> accepted as such and be recited by the believers with
> unquestioning faith and confidence, that through them
> they may enter into a much closer communion with God,
> and identify themselves more fully with His laws and
> precepts. (on behalf of Shoghi Effendi, 10 January 1936,
qtd. in BP 208)

The “Reunion Prayer” could be one of these prayers “invested
by Bahá’u’lláh with a special potency and significance.” Indeed
this prayer summarizes the essential prerequisites of prayer
explained in the Bahá’í writings.

Bahá’í prayer is in the first place a spiritual obligation.

‘Abdu’l-Bahá writes: “It behoveth the servant to pray to and
seek assistance from God, and to supplicate and implore His
aid” (in CC 2:232, no. 1746) and explains:

> Know thou, verily, it is becoming in a weak one to
> supplicate to the Strong One, and it behooveth a seeker of
> bounty to beseech the Glorious Bountiful One. When one
> supplicates to his Lord, turns to Him and seeks bounty
> from His Ocean, this supplication brings light to his heart,
> illumination to his sight, life to his soul and exaltation to
his being. (qtd. in Esslemont 93)

As any spiritual obligation imposed on the Bahá’ís, also the
obligation to pray should be understood in the light of the
following words of the Kitáb-i-Aqdas: “‘Observe My
commandments, for the love of My beauty’” (KA 20, ¶ 4). This
concept seems implicit in the final words of the “Reunion
Prayer”:

> Verily, We have instructed and warned thee, that thou
> mayest attain unto the presence of thy Lord and mayest
> not be deprived of what is better for thee than the
> treasures of the heavens and the earth. If thou doest
> perform it, it is for thine own sake, and if thou doest
> neglect it, thy Lord, verily, can well dispense with all
creatures. (28)

Bahá’í prayer also is a remembrance of God (dhikru’lláh), a
remembrance that “cleanseth all things from defilement”
(Bahá’u’lláh, GWB 294, sec. CXXXVI, ¶ 1) and acts as “‘…a
ladder of ascent for the believer’” (Bahá’u’lláh, in Importance,
sec. 1, no. X), “a healing medicine to the souls and a light to the
hearts of men” (Bahá’u’lláh, in CC 2:228, no. 1732). In the
“Reunion Prayer” He writes:

> Then, detach me, o my God, from this world and from the
> world to come, cause me to enter the Paradise of Thy
> presence (liqá’) and the Garden [Ri∂ván] of Thy mighty
> and luminous glory. O Lord! Blot out from my heart every
> remembrance (dhikr) except Thine, that I may arise to
> praise Thy Being between earth and heaven. (25)
> If the worshipper attains to this condition he prays “only for
the love of God, not because… [he] fear[s] Him or hell, or
hope[s] for bounty or heaven....” (‘Abdu’l-Bahá’, qtd. in
Esslemont 95), he is “associating with God” (‘Abdu’l-Bahá,
SWAB 201, no. 172), “is alone with God, converseth with Him,
and acquireth bounties… he will obtain the confirmations of the
Holy Spirit, and this will entirely obliterate love of self”
(‘Abdu’l-Bahá, in Importance, sec. 2, no. XI). The idea of the
communion with God is the central motif of the “Reunion
Prayer,” whose recitation Bahá’u’lláh recommends to all those
who wish “to attain to the pinnacle of grace and draw nigh unto
the most exalted court” (T13).

In this condition the worshipper reaches “the kingdom of
mystery, and the worship of the Supreme One…. [comes near]
unto His threshold” (‘Abdu’l-Bahá, in Importance, sec. 2, no.
XIII), “day by day… [his] awareness… increase[s], and, through
the power of the knowledge of God,… [he rends] asunder the
veil of error of the people of doubt” (‘Abdu’l-Bahá, in
Importance, sec. 2, no. XVI). The attainment of awareness is
part of the requests advanced in the “Reunion Prayer”: “Cause,
moreover, the waters of knowledge to flow out from my
mouth, in my recognition of Thy Self, the Merciful, that
through it I may produce Thy proof unto such of Thy creatures
as trembled on Thy manifest, radiant and undeviating path” (T23).

In this condition “the worshipper is delivered from the fire,
and entereth the paradise of God’s good-pleasure” (SWB 77-8).
For him now prayer is a need and a joy. In him the following
two sentences by ‘Abdu’l-Bahá are realized: “If one friend feels
love for another, he will wish to say so. Though he knows that
the friend is aware that he loves him, he will still wish to say
so....” (qtd. in Esslemont 94), and also: “For a lover, there is no
greater pleasure than to converse with his beloved, and for a
seeker, there is no greater bounty than intimacy with the object
of his desire” (‘Abdu’l-Bahá, in Importance, sec. 2, no. VII). He
thus realizes exactly what Bahá’u’lláh suggested at the beginning
of the “Reunion Prayer”:

Beware lest thou lookest at Me through the eyes of anyone

> but Me and if thou wishest to know Me, look at Me
> through My eyes and thou wilt not know Me through
> anything but those, although thou ponderest to know Me
> till the end that none among the reckoners can reckon. (T12)
