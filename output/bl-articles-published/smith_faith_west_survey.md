Foreword
ALL RELIGIOUS MOVEMENTS        emerge within a particular socio-cultural
context. For the most part, they remain within the social environment
of their birth. They grow or decline in proportion to their success in ar-
ticulating the cultural concerns of the society in which they are situ-
ated and in creating and channeling the enthusiasm of their adherents.
Some religious movements, however, transcend their culture of origin,
attracting followers from a variety of cultural backgrounds and per-
haps eventually establishing firm roots in a number of societies. The
resulting diversity entails a double existence for the religion in ques-
tion. If it is truly multicultural, it exists in a number of distinct local
cultural forms. At the same time, insofar as it retains its unity, it re-
mains a single transcultural movement.

The Baha'i Faith illustrates this multiple existence. Originating
within the context of nineteenth-century Iranian Shi'ism, it has long
since succeeded in transcending its culture of origin. Not only has it
gained a worldwide following, but it has developed in culturally di-
verse forms. Thus, in the most general terms, we may refer to Baha'i
expansion as having taken place in three cultural-historical "worlds":
the predominantly Iranian Shi4i world of the religion's origin; the
Western world (the subject of the present volume); and the Baha'i
"Third World," from which most of its contemporary adherents are
drawn. Each of these three worlds has had its own distinctive forms
and chronologies of Baha'i expansion.

THERE IS GOOD REASON to    see the multiform development of the Baha'i
Faith in the West as a single process. The West, here defined as Europe
and the culturally cognate territories of North America and the Pacific,
is an area of considerable cultural and historical unity. This is
grounded in part on the common inheritance of Judeo-Christian and
Greco-Roman culture and in part on more recent historical develop-
ments, such as European imperialism, industrial capitalism, and con-
sumer culture. Within this area, Baha'i expansion has followed its own
distinctive pattern. Western Baha'i communities have come to share
many cultural characteristics with each other, both by dint of shared
patterns of Baha'i activity and by their common participation in the
Western-dominated culture of modernity.

HI

RECENT YEARS HAVE SEEN        an impressive development in the academic
study of the Bábi and Baha'i religions. As much of this work has been
by Western Baha'is, academic study itself represents an important as-
pect of Western Baha'i development. Important though this work has
been, there is still evidently much to be done in relation to the West.
We now have several excellent studies of the early American Baha'i
community. Apart from these studies, the period of 'Abdu'l-Baha's
visits to the West, and some very specific topics—such as the cultural
aspects of recent Baha'i conversions in the southern United States,
there is very little material on the history and culture of the Baha'i Faith
in America. There are now detailed studies of only five other coun-
tries: Australia, Britain, Canada, Denmark, and New Zealand. As with
the American studies, much of this work remains unpublished. There
is next to nothing written about any other Western country. In addition
to general historical studies, there are a number of biographies of
prominent Western Baha'is, but only a few of these are scholarly in
tone, and only a few leading Western Baha'is have received serious at-
tention.

One general tendency in much of the work that has been produced
so far has been a concentration on Western Baha'i history and culture
in its own context. This leaves a double lacunae. First, there is as yet

c
Foreword     xi

little research on the relationship between the Bahá'i movement in the
West and its environing societies and cultures. Nor is there any sys-
tematic study comparing Baha'i formation with other religious devel-
opments in the West. Second, the relationship between the Baha'is in
the West and the Baha'i Faith as a whole has yet to be adequately stud-
ied. Clearly, Western Baha'is have played a major role in the diffusion
of the Faith outside the West, in the development of Baha'i adminis-
tration, and in the formulation of frameworks of belief and practice,
but the details of this role have yet to be delineated.

GOOD SCHOLARSHIP INVOLVES        both individual effort and a collective
endeavor. The progress of any scholarly field depends upon these two
elements. We are fortunate, then, that both within the Baha'i commu-
nity (through the activities of the Association of Baha'i Studies, origi-
nally the Canadian Association for Studies on the Baha'i Faith
[1974-1981]) and independently (through the work of those associated
with the Lancaster [1977-1980], Cambridge [1978-1979], and Los An-
geles [1983-1985] Baha'i Studies seminars and their successors), a
growing network of scholarly communication and debate has devel-
oped. The appearance of publications such as the Studies in the Bábi
and Bahá 7 Religions series reflects this growth. This present volume
is a further contribution to the ongoing process of communication and
debate.

As to the papers themselves, the first essay provides a general
survey of Western Baha'i history as a whole (Peter Smith), and the sec-
ond essay studies the Baha'i world from 1919-1920 (J. E. Esslemont's
survey, edited by Moojan Momen). Studies of particular episodes in
the history of the Baha'i Faith in the West follow: Gyórgy Lederer ex-
amines the newspaper reports of 'Abdu'l-Baha's visit to Budapest in
1913; Jackson Armstrong-Ingram looks at the Henry Clayton Thomp-
son episode of 1910; and Loni Bramson studies the development of the
American "Plans of Unified Action." The final essays in the volume
investigate the beginnings of three national Baha'i communities: in
Denmark (Margit Warburg), in Australia (Graham Hassell), and in
Scotland (Ismael Valesco).

THE GESTATION PERIOD of   this book has been unduly long. Most of the
essays in this book were prepared for publication in 1988, but the proj-
ect was delayed. A few editorial changes have been made to the origi-
nal essays, but they remain essentially unchanged. I hope that readers
will find them relevant even after this lengthy passage of time. I would
like to thank the authors for their patience and cooperation in the
preparation of this work. My thanks are also due to the organizers of
the Los Angeles Baha'i History Conferences, at which several of the
following papers were first presented, and to Kalimát Press for its hard
work on the production of this volume. My thanks to Anthony A. Lee
for all his encouragement and perseverance during these years of wait-
ing, and most particularly to Ismael Velasco for his help in preparing
the book for final publication.

The Baha'i Faith in the West
by Peter Smith

THE DEVELOPMENT     of the Baha'i Faith in the West forms an important
part of the history of Baha'i expansion.1 This essay attempts to pro-
vide a general account of this development, as well as to locate it
within the overall context of Baha'i history. Some account of the
distribution and social composition of the present Western Baha'i
communities is also offered.

Western Baha'i history forms part of the overall history of the
Baha'i Faith, but also has its own separate patterns and themes. For
convenience, we may divide it into four general phases: the early
establishment of the Baha'i Faith in the West; its transformation into
more exclusive and organizationally structured forms; its systematic
expansion; and its entry into a period of more rapid numerical increase
and greater public visibility. Despite the considerable diversity of the
Baha'i communities involved (North America, Europe, Australia, New
Zealand, and Hawaii), this pattern has general validity for the West as
a whole.

The First Phase: Early Establishment, c. 1894-1921
The Kheiralla Period, 1894-1900. The initial establishment of the
Baha'i Faith in the West was primarily the work of one man, Ibrahim

George Kheiralla (Khayru'llah) (1849-1929). Kheiralla was a Syrian
Christian who had only recently become a Baha'i when he migrated to
the United States in 1892. Establishing himself in Chicago, he began
to organize classes on the Baha'i religion in 1894. These classes pre-
sented Kheiralla's own highly syncretic version of the Baha'i teach-

i

ings. The classes were pervaded by an aura of mystery, and the name
of the new religion was not made public. Only after attending a series
of graduated lectures were students told the secret "pith" of Kheiralla's
teachings: that God had appeared in the person of BaháVlláh and that
his sonfcAbdu'l-Bahá,was the return of Jesus Christ, and was now liv-
ing in 'Akká in the Holy Land. Converts were required to write a con-

fession of faith to Abdu'l-Bahá and were told God's "greatest name"

> (a form of the Arabic word Bahá* meaning glory) as a means by which
they could enter into a special relationship with the divine.

This mixture of adventist and esoteric ideas, combined with
> Kheiralla's own forceful personality, was sufficient to attract a grow-
> ing number of followers, and by 1900, there were perhaps 1,500 or
> more American Baha'is. Given the extreme geographic mobility of
Americans at this time, these early Baha'is were scattered across sixty

> localities in twenty-five States. There were also a few converts in
> Canada, Britain, and France. The three largest groups were in Chicago,
> New York City, and Kenosha, Wisconsin. The Baha'i "community"
> was socially and religiously diverse, but the majority were native Eng-
> lish-speaking, middle-class, white Protestants. Women outnumbered
men.

Kheiralla occupied a pivotal role in the network of early American
> Baha'is. He was the movement's "beloved teacher," and despite the
> emergence of secondary leaders and a limited organization,
> Kheiralla's overall leadership remained unchallenged. This situation

Akká in 1898-99. Accounts vary, but it seems likely that Kheiralla
> was reluctant to accept 'Abdu'1-Bahá's absolute authority. There were
> important doctrinal differences between the two men, and Kheiralla
> appears to have wished to maintain his dominant position among the
American Baha'is.

Whatever the exact motivation involved, Kheiralla found his lead-
> ership challenged by some of his fellow pilgrims after his return to the
United States in May 1899. A dispute gradually developed, and in

March 1900, Kheiralla publicly declared his doubts about Abdu'l-
> Baha's authority as Baha'u'llah's successor. A distinguished Iranian
> Baha'i teacher, 4Abdu'l-Karím Tihrání, was sent by 'Abdu'1-Bahá to
> ensure the loyalty of the American Baha'is. An open breach ensued,
Kheiralla denouncing 'Abdu'1-Bahá in favor of his dissident, disaf-

fected half-brother, Mirzá Muhammad-4 AH. Dismayed or confused by
the bitter dispute, many adherents abandoned the movement. The re-
mainder split into two separate and mutually hostile organizations: a

Baha'i majority, loyal to Abdu'l-Bahá; and a "Bahaist" minority, who
> followed Kheiralla and Muhammad-4AH. Some individuals fluctuated
> between the two groups.

THE KENOSHA BAHA'i COMMUNITY
Kenosha, Wisconsin, Easter Sunday 1898

The Bohrf Faith in the West: A Survey

The Bahaists. After this schism, the Bahaist group fared poorly, rap-
idly declining in numbers, so that by 1906, they were reduced to a con-
gregation of forty persons in Kenosha, a small group in Chicago, and
a scattering of individuals elsewhere.4 There were subsequent attempts
to expand the movement, but these were unsuccessful. The Kenosha
group continued activities until the early 1950s, but the Bahaists evi-
dently lacked the dynamism of the mainstream BaháMs. Despite
Kheiralla's undoubted charm and personal attraction, it seems likely
that his denial of 4 AbduM-Bahá removed a key element from the ap-
peal of his teachings. Kheiralla had taught that 4 AbduM-Bahá was the
return of Christ—a status which 'AbduM-Bahá emphatically denied—
and it was to 4 AbduM-Bahá, "the Master," that the majority of the
American BaháMs had given their allegiance. Subsequent changes in
their theological understanding of his "station" did not alter that basic
allegiance.

Abdu'1-Bahás Leadership. The stabilization of the American BaháM
movement after the shock of Kheiralla's defection was an impressive
achievement on the part of 4 AbduM-Bahá and those loyal to him.5 The
American BaháMs had been thrown into confusion by the dispute.
Their former mentor and his teachings had been discredited. Their
"Lord" lived thousands of miles away in a remote part of the Turkish
Empire. They had only a few typewritten copies of extracts from the
BaháM writings. They had newly become members of a religion that
was rooted in the alien culture and languages of the Middle East, but
they now had little to guide them as to the doctrines and practices that
they should follow. Stabilization was accomplished by a variety of
means: * AbduM-Bahá *s dispatch of a succession of four Iranian BaháM
teachers to provide the American BaháMs with a focus and source of
orthodox BaháM belief (1900-1905); a vast interchange of correspon-
dence between 'AbduM-Bahá and his American followers; the pil-
grimage journeys to 'Akká of a small but influential minority of
BaháMs; the publication of a substantial body of BaháM literature in
English (such that by 1912, at least seventy books and pamphlets had
been produced, including translations of scripture, pilgrimage ac-
counts, and expositions of the BaháM teachings); and the emergence of
a body of native American BaháM teachers and leaders.

8     Peter Smith

As the Baha'i movement recovered from the shock of 1900, it ex-
perienced a revival in numbers as disaffected members returned and
new converts were made. Growth was much slower than it had been
during the period of Kheiralla's leadership, however, and by 1906, the
Baha'is were still only able to report a membership of 1,280 to the na-
tional census.6 It is not yet clear why growth was so slow after 1900.
Perhaps the more "orthodox" version of the Baha'i teachings was less
appealing than Kheiralla's synthesis. Or perhaps the American
Baha'is1 efforts at propagating their beliefs were hindered by their lack
of effective organization, or by the factionalism and petty disputes that
often dogged the movement. Certainly, the American Baha'is initially
lacked a common focus apart from the distant figure of 'Abdu'1-Bahá,
the Baha'i writings being subject to a variety of individualistic inter-
pretations.

The question of organization was in itself a source of disagreement
among the early American Baha'is. Nevertheless, limited forms of or-
ganization gradually emerged, both in the various local groups and na-
tionally. Many of the local groups began to hold regular business
meetings and to elect executive boards to manage their activities. Na-
tionally, the most significant developments were the formation in
1909, of an annual delegate assembly—the Bahai Temple Unity—
which took responsibility for the construction of a Baha'i House of

Worship (Mashriqu'1-Adhkár) near Chicago, and the initiation of a
regular national Baha'i periodical, the Bahai News or Star of the West
(1910). The leading role in both of these developments was played by
the Baha'is of Chicago, for many years the largest local group. Baha'i
publishing activity also came to be centered in Chicago.

These organizational developments may be assumed to have fos-
tered a growing sense of cohesion as a religious group both locally and
nationally. The conception of a distinctive "Baha'i community" grad-
ually emerged.8 Organization also provided a new basis for campaigns
of activity, such as that of propagating the Baha'i teachings, hitherto
largely regarded as a matter of individual initiative. Under 'Abdu'l-
Baha's guidance, and in contrast to the secrecy of the Kheiralla period,
the propagation of the Baha'i Faith—reaching"—came to be a major
focus of activity. This included regular discussion groups in believers'
homes and more formal public meetings. Initially, there were also

many contacts with sympathetic metaphysical groups (New Thought,
Theosophy, Divine Science) and later, as the BaháMs became better
known and the basis of their appeal broadened, increasing contacts
with liberal Christian churches and with movements concerned with
social issues, such as peace and the advancement of women and of
African-Americans.

In 1912, 4AbduM-Bahá came to North America.9 He stayed for
eight months (April-December) and visited BaháM communities in
various parts of the United States and Canada. This visit was of in-
comparable significance to the BaháMs. Here was their Master, the liv-
ing exemplar of their religion. He enthused his followers, reiterated
over and over again the fundamentals of the BaháM Faith, renewed the
sense of BaháM community, and instilled a tremendous sense of ur-
gency to spread the BaháM teachings. He also established new links
with "progressive" religious and social groups and attracted wide-
spread and generally sympathetic public attention.

With 'AbduM-Baha's visit, the number of BaháMs increased. After
his departure, the level of enthusiasm and activity remained high.
Some systematic plans for missionary expansion were made, and a
scheme for communal funding of itinerant missionary teachers was
initiated. By 1916, the BaháMs were able to report a membership of
2,884, this figure seemingly both including and excluding large num-

bers of sympathizers and peripheral members.

AbduM-Bahá had predicted war, and the commencement of the
European war in 1914 gave the American BaháMs new impetus to their
activities. The urgent need for the BaháM teachings was clearly
demonstrated. For many of the BaháMs, the war also assumed apoca-
lyptic importance.11 Kheiralla had predicted that the promised BaháM
millennium, the "Most Great Peace," would be established in 1917,
and this remained an apocryphal BaháM belief. American entry into the
war (in 1917) was therefore seen as being filled with eschatological
import. It also acted as a catalyst for two major dissensions within the
community: between BaháM pacifists and those who felt it their patri-
otic duty to support the war effort12; and between the supporters and
opponents of the "Chicago BaháM Reading Room.**

These divisions were partly healed and largely overshadowed by
the renewal of correspondence with 4AbduM-Bahá after the war. Call-

ing the Baha'is to work for communal unity, 'Abdu'1-Bahá also gave
them a new vision of worldwide missionary activity. A new campaign
of teaching began within North America, and several individuals mi-
grated overseas to further their religion. There was a sense of a new
beginning, which continued even after the communal trauma occa-
sioned by fcAbdu'l-Bahá's death in November 1921.

Activities Outside the United States. The early growth of the Baha'i
Faith in the West was almost entirely confined to the United States.
Moreover, much of the impetus for activity outside the United States
came from Americans, and in most instances, the initial establishment
of Baha'i groups was the work of expatriate Americans who became
Baha'is (as in Paris and London), or of American Baha'is who mi-
grated as missionary teachers of their religion ("pioneers" in modem
Baha'i parlance). Baha'i groups were thus established in England and
France (both prior to 1900), Hawaii (from 1901), Canada (from 1902),
Germany (from 1905), Japan (from 1914), and Australia (from

1920).13 Only the Baha'i groups in Germany displayed the dynamism
of the American Baha'i groups, however. There were individual con-
verts of great ability in both England and France, but overall these new
Baha'i groups remained very small and made no significant inroads
into their host societies. This was particularly the case with the Paris
group, most of whose early members were expatriate Americans. Even

\[4\] Abdu'I-Bahá's two visits to Europe (August-December 1911; De-
cember 1912-June 1913) did not lead to any expansion comparable to
that in the United States.14 There was little organizational develop-
ment.

The Second Phase:
Organizational Transformation, c. 1922-c. 1934
'ABDU'L-BAHA'S DEATH in November       1921, and Shoghi Effendi's suc-
cession (January 1922), marked a major turning point in the history of
the Baha'i Faith. In sociological terms, there was a change in the basis
of authority of the supreme leadership of the religion: from the per-
sonal charismatic authority of 'Abdu'1-Bahá (and before him, of

c        i_ í _
The Bahďi faith in the West: A Survey    11

Baha'u'llah) to the institutionalized charisma of the office of the
Guardianship. This change in leadership was followed by two succes­
sive and overlapping organizational changes that marked the estab­
lishment of what Shoghi Effendi termed the "formative age" of the
Faith. These were the consolidation of the system of local and national
Spiritual Assemblies (c. 1922-c. 1934) and the adoption of systematic
planning as the chief strategy in the propagation of the religion
(1926/1937-). This second transformation is dealt with in the next sec­
tion. As in the earlier period, the United States was the dominant
Western Baha'i community.

The Administrative Order. One of Shoghi Effendi's chief concerns
when he assumed the office of Guardian was to regularize and con­
solidate a system of locally and nationally elected Spiritual Assem­
blies as a means both of providing the BaháMs with institutionalized
leadership and of preparing the way for the future election of the Uni­
versal House of Justice. 15 In April 1922, he issued his first general let­
ter on the Baha'i "Administrative Order," calling for the urgent
establishment of Assemblies wherever this was feasible and for the
Assemblies to assume direct authority for all Baha'i activities within
the geographical areas of their jurisdictions. A second general letter, in
March 1923, amplified and extended these instructions.16

In the West, developments on these lines proceeded rapidly. Na­
tional Spiritual Assemblies were formed in Britain and Germany in
1923, while the Executive Board of the American Baha'i Temple
Unity was transformed from an executive body implementing the de­
cisions of the Temple Unity's Convention delegates into a directive
legislative body vested with authority over the entire American Baha'i
community. The process of local Assembly formation also proceeded
apace, so that by 1928, there were forty-seven of these bodies in North
America, twelve in Europe, and nine in the "Anglo-Pacific" (see Table
2, below). Apart from North America, Germany, and Britain, the only
other early Western Baha'i "community" to be able to form its own
National Assembly was that of Australia and New Zealand. Progress
toward this goal was slow, however, and it was not achieved until

1934, a date which marks the end of the initial phase of National Spir­
itual Assembly formation (see Table 3). Elsewhere in the West, Baha'i

Oo
12    Peter Smith

groups were too small to follow suit, and the various European groups
(including France) did not form their National Assemblies until the
1950s or later.

The formation of the Assemblies represented a major change in the
structure of the Baha'i communities. There had been organizing bod-
ies before 1922, but they had lacked directive authority. The new As-
semblies encouraged a centralization of authority and provided the
basis for an assertion of power. This was particularly the case in North
America, where the National Spiritual Assembly of the Baha'is of the
United States and Canada rapidly assumed its new responsibilities and
pioneered a series of new administrative arrangements. These included
the establishment of a national office, a full-time salaried national sec-
retary with considerable executive authority, a centralized national
fund, and appointed committees responsible for the main areas of
Baha'i activity. Everything that was "Baha'i" came within its purview.
A definite legal basis for the administration was also established
through formal incorporation, thereby enabling the National Assembly
to hold property and receive bequests. At Shoghi Effendi's encourage-
ment, other national Assemblies later followed suit. A related change

was in the basis for membership in the Baha'i Faith. In place of the
vague inclusivity that had formerly prevailed, the National Assembly
adopted formal criteria of membership. A membership roll was pre-
pared and new Baha'is were required to record their confessions of
faith on "enrollment cards." Existing memberships were validated
through the issuing of individual "credential cards." Again, these in-
novations were later adopted by other national Assemblies.

Opposition and tension. These administrative changes took place with
the approval and often at the express instruction of Shoghi Effendi. As
such, they constitute part of his transformation of the Faith. At the
same time, however, they initially took place within the context of an
American Baha'i community in which there were existing tensions re-
garding organization, and these tensions were naturally reflected in the
manner in which the administrative changes proceeded.

Central to this tension were two divergent conceptions of the
Baha'i religion and collateral divergent attitudes about the nature of
organization. The conceptual tension is partly rooted in the Baha'i
writings (and can still be found in contemporary discourse) in the

Oo       _J
The Bahái Faith in the West: A Survey    13

claim that the Baha'i Faith is both: 1) an independent divine revela-
tion, and 2) the fulfillment of prophesies associated with religions of
the past, with which it forms a single and integral "religion of God."
In the early American Baha'i community, these claims led to what
were essentially rival "exclusivist" and "inclusivist" conceptions of
the religion.18 Those who were "inclusivists" saw the Baha'i teachings
as an all-embracing spiritual philosophy. It was the universal spirit of
the age that was also infused through in all progressive religious and
social movements—all of whose members, it was thought, should
work together to bring about the spiritual transformation of the world.
Being a Baha'i was a matter of sharing this attitude and did not entail
membership in a particular religious organization. By contrast, the
more exclusivist Baha'is viewed their religion as being based on the
revelations of Baha'u'llah. Being a Baha'i entailed specific adherence
to Baha'u'llah's cause and obedience to his teachings. By itself, gen-
eral adherence to Baha'i principles was not enough.

These contrasting attitudes tended to be linked to divergent atti-
tudes towards authority, and hence towards organization. Thus, the
more inclusivist Baha'is were inclined towards an "epistemological in-
dividualism" in which the preferred final locus of doctrinal and orga-
nizational authority was the individual. Some degree of organization
might be necessary, but it should be loosely structured and not curtail
individualism. By contrast, the exclusivists were generally inclined to-
wards an "epistemological authoritarianism" in which there were
clearly established bases of authority beyond the individual.19 Corre-
spondingly, they favored the concepts of doctrinal orthodoxy and of
regular procedures of organization that should be followed.
There was also a linkage between these divergent attitudes and

membership in the "cultic milieu" of the metaphysical movements.
Many early Baha'is were drawn from this background, and "inclu-
sivist" Baha'is often retained their links within it, continuing the uni-
versalistic and individualistic attitudes that were generally
characteristic of that milieu. The Baha'i "exclusivists," by contrast,
tended to be unsympathetic towards this milieu and to Baha'i linkages
with it.

As far as can be discerned, these divergent attitudes coexisted
within the American Baha'i community from 1900 to the early 1930s.
The plurality of the community is remarkable and can be largely

Oo

attributed to the unusual nature of 'Abdu'1-Bahá's leadership and
appeal—a forceful claim to charismatic authority combined with a
highly permissive style of leadership; and, appeal on the basis of
Christian millennial fulfillment combined with liberal social and reli-
gious teachings of the "new age." Common devotion to 'Abdu'1-Bahá
was able to unite a highly diverse Baha'i community.21 The implicit
tension between these two attitudes was expressed in the opposition of
many early Baha'is towards the development of any strong form of
organization. The flexible and relatively non-directive form of organi-
zation that did develop allowed the two attitudes to continue to coex-
ist. However, when the American Baha'is were cut off from
'Abdu'l-Baha's encouraging guidance during the First World War, the
tensions became explicit and an inclusivistic "cultic" group of
Baha'is—the ading Room—was expelled from the Baha'i community

by a well-organized group of exclusivists.

'Abdu'1-Bahá sought to reconcile the divergent groups when com-
munications were restored, but a polarization of attitudes seems to
have occurred. The establishment of the Administrative Order com-
pleted the process of polarization. The changes were welcome to the
more exclusivist Baha'is, who gave their support to the new adminis-
trative institutions and gravitated towards membership in and leader-
ship of them. The inclusivists found themselves increasingly less
influential within the Baha'i community. Many were prepared to ac-
cept the changes—concentrating their efforts on "teaching" rather than
administration—but others became apathetic and inactive, while a
small minority came out in outright opposition. There was a gradual,
but far-reaching, transformation of the community. An ethos of what I
would term "organizational exclusivism" came to replace the univer-
salistic and individualistic attitudes that had been prevalent earlier.

The opponents of organization were able to attract a fair amount
of attention, especially in the late 1920s when the American adminis-
tration was becoming firmly established. They articulated disaffection,
but did not gain a large following. They were a diverse group: Harri-
son Gray Dyar (1866-1929), the editor of the New York-based Baha'i
magazine Reality (1922-29); Ruth White, an active Baha'i teacher; and
Ahmad Sohrab (1893-1958), 'Abdu'1-Bahá's former secretary and in-

terpreter. Dyar and White publicly attacked the new administration

The Baháí Faith in t he West: A Survey    15

and derided Shoghi Effendi—hence putting themselves beyond the
pale of Baha'i orthodoxy—but they were not able to offer an attractive
and coherent alternative to the Baha'i mainstream. Sohrab's critique

was more sophisticated, and his "liberal" and univcrsalistic *New His-
tory Society" (1929-C.1958) remained active for many years after he
had been excommunicated from the Baha'i community as a Covenant-
breaker.24

Outside of North America, the only Western Bah a" i community to
experience outright opposition to the growing Administrative Order
was Germany, where a minority of Baha'is under Wilhelm Herrigel
formed themselves into a breakaway "Bahai World Union" (c. 1930-

1937).25 As in North America, a basic transformation of attitude on the
part of the Baha'i community as a whole eventually occurred, how-
ever. Exclusivism and a more directive system of administration came
to be the norm. A similar change was experienced in Britain and Aus-
tralia—the only other Western Baha'i communities of any size—but
without any movements of opposition developing. Symbolic of the
change was the gradual abandonment of the term "Baha'i Movement,"
widely used to describe the religion up to the 1920s, and its replace-
ment with the term "the Baha'i Faith."

The Third Phase: Systematic Planning, 1926/1937-c. 1968
BEFORE THE GENERAL ACCEPTANCE       of the new system of directive As-
semblies, most Baha'i activities in the West occurred as a result of in-
dividual initiatives and enthusiasms. The slow-moving Temple
construction project at Wilmette, near Chicago, was one of the few
sustained communal efforts. Individual initiative was effective in es-
tablishing a widespread network of Baha'i groups, in organizing
Baha'i meetings, and in securing the publication of a considerable
quantity of Baha'i literature (mostly in English, but also in German).
It was relatively unsystematic and uncoordinated, however, and in
some areas (notably France, Britain, and Australia) led to little actual
growth.

The idea of a more coordinated approach to Baha'i activities—
particularly that of "teaching the Cause"—was highly attractive to a
number of Baha'is. As early as 1915, American Baha'is had made

Coo

some moves to implement a systematic national teaching campaign.
Support for this idea was increased in 1916, by the receipt of the first
of 4Abdu'l-Bahá's general letters on teaching, the Tablets of the Divine
Plan, and again in 1919/1920, when the rest of the letters were re-
ceived and widely discussed.26 Even so, it was only in 1925—after the
transition to a more directive form of organization—that a systematic
"Plan of Unified Action" (1926-1928) was adopted by the American
National Assembly.27 This plan, which received the full backing of
Shoghi Effendi, aimed to increase Baha'i teaching endeavors and ad-
ministrative coordination and to raise sufficient funds to complete the
superstructure of the Wilmette Temple. The success of the Plan ap-
pears to have been considerably impeded by a general lack of confi-
dence in the National Assembly. It was only after the official end of the
plan in 1928, that there was a marked improvement in contributions.
However, the more organized approach to teaching seems to have been
successful and an increasing number of new converts were gained.

Growth in numbers continued during a second plan (1931-1934),
but again, the financial response was disappointing, doubtless in large
part because of the Depression. The increase in numbers was a signif-
icant element in the transformation of the American Baha'i commu-
nity. The official United States census figures record a fall between
1916 (2,884 Baha'is) and 1926 (to 1,247), and then an increase by
1936 (to 2,584).28 These figures have yet to be properly evaluated, but
they indicate what was probably the general trend: a loss of numbers
during the period in which the transition from "universalistic individ-
ualism" began, and an increase during the period when greater organ-
ization was gaining general acceptance among the Baha'is and a more
systematic approach to teaching had been adopted. (On the two Plans
of Unified Action, see Loni Bramson's article in this volume.)

As the Administrative Order became an important element in what
the new Baha'is were taught before they entered the faith, their con-
version strengthened the more exclusivistic approach within the
Baha'i community. By the mid-1930s, some thirty to forty percent of

the American community had become Baha'is since 1925. The two
Plans of Unified Action had only limited success in terms of the com-
pletion of their stated goals, but they consolidated a general acceptance
of "planification" as a normal part of Baha'i activity. Shoghi Effendi

Coc

built on this base to launch two American Seven Year Plans (1937-

1944; 1946-1953).30 These plans gave the Baha'is specific domestic
and international teaching goals, the first plan calling for Baha'is to
settle permanently in all American states, Canadian provinces, and
Latin American republics; the second requiring further expansion of
the movement throughout the Americas, the establishment of new Na-
tional Assemblies for Canada and for the South and Central American
regions, and the launching of a systematic teaching campaign in Eu-
rope. There was also a call for staged work on the Wilmette Temple (fi-
nally completed in 1953). As a consequence, Baha'i groups were
established throughout North America, even in the southern United
States where progress was difficult to accomplish (in part because of
the Baha'i teaching of racial equality in what was then a context of in-
stitutionalized white supremacy). Growth was slow but steady, so that
by 1947, there were over 5,000 Baha'is.31 The goal and attainment of
Baha'i "administrative independence" for Canada—in the form of the
establishment of its own National Spiritual Assembly in 1948—led to
an increase in Baha'i activities in that country. By 1961, there were
over 1,000 Baha'is in Canada.32 Alaska and Hawaii subsequently also
became independent communities.

Systematic planning was only adopted in Europe and Australasia
in the 1940s, and before that time, the local Baha'i communities re-
mained very small. In Europe, the rise of Nazi domination also pre-
sented a major challenge to the Baha'is. In 1937, all Baha'i activities
and institutions were banned in Germany by order of the Gestapo.
There was a consequent cessation of Baha'i activities throughout most
of continental Europe until 1945-1946, when the German Baha'is and
others were able to resume their activities and the American Baha'is
began their European teaching campaign. The German and Austrian
Baha'is were subsequently given their own plan in 1948 (-1953).
Meanwhile, Baha'is were establishing or reestablishing their residence
in most of Western Europe. From the 1950s onwards, a widespread
network of Baha'i Assemblies was built up, each Baha'i national
community eventually establishing its own National Spiritual Assem-
bly. Some growth also initially occurred in Eastern Europe, but this
came to an end with the establishment of communist regimes in the af-
termath of the war. Baha'i teaching activity in these areas has only re-

c

cently resumed. In contrast to the rest of Europe, the formerly lethar-
gic British Baha'i community became increasingly active from the
mid-1930s onwards (establishing its own publishing trust and summer
school in 1937) and was able to continue its activities throughout the
war. In 1944, it adopted its own six-year plan of internal expansion,
and in 1951 was given a new plan by Shoghi Effendi, which in addi-
tion to internal goals, gave the British Baha'is responsibilities for es-
tablishing the Baha'i Faith in Africa. In Australia and New Zealand,
concerted national activity was impeded by the great distances be-
tween the various local groups. A joint National Assembly was formed
in 1934, followed by the establishment of a national news bulletin
(1936) and summer school (1938). At Shoghi Effendi's encourage-
ment, a small-scale teaching plan was adopted in 1943, to be followed
by a more ambitious national plan in 1947 (-1953). Outside of North
America, growth was slow, however. By 1952, there were still fewer
than 2,000 Baha'is in Europe and Australasia combined. Germany re-
mained the largest community, with about 600 Baha'is in 1951; Britain
and Australia (with New Zealand) had about 400 each, as did all the
other European countries combined.33

The Western Baha'i communities grew during the 1950s and
1960s with Shoghi Effendi's promulgation of a ten-year "Global Cru-
sade" (1953-1963), and the subsequent Nine Year Plan of the Univer-
sal House of Justice (1964-1973). Both these plans aimed to increase
the number of Baha'is in the main existing communities and to estab-
lish new Baha'i groups and institutions throughout the world. Each na-
tional Baha'i community had its own plan as a component of the
international plan. By 1963, the total number of Western Baha'is, in-
cluding children and youth, had risen to approximately 25,000 (19,000
in North America, 5,000 in Europe, and 1,000 in Australia and New
Zealand), and by 1968, there were over 40,000 Baha'is (out of a world
total of 1.2 million; see Table 1). Given the small size of the Western
communities in the early 1950s (c. 7,000), this increase is quite

marked, but it is not overly impressive. In the absence of political
constraints, systematic planning provided a basis for sustained growth,
but not for any dramatic increase in the number of Baha'is.

Besides the growth in numbers, the 1950s and 1960s saw a num-
ber of other significant achievements as part of the two successive in-
ternational plans. Despite the fewness of their numbers, Western
Baha'is attained an impressive geographical diffusion—as indicated
by the number of recorded localities in which Baha'is resided in the
West (Table 2). Before the general adoption of systematic planning,
these were very few—141 in 1928, with about half each in North
America and Europe—but by 1945, these had risen to 1,000, and by
1968 to 4,000 (two-thirds in North America).

Of these localities, only a minority had the necessary minimum of
nine adult Baha'is to form a local Spiritual Assembly. The increase in
local Assemblies was slower than the increase in localities. In 1928,
there were sixty-eight Assemblies, and by 1945, this had only risen to

146, nearly all in North America. Thereafter, growth was more
marked, the total number rising to 723 in 1968 (a five-fold increase
since 1945). During this same period, there was also a dramatic in-
crease in the number of National Assemblies: from four in 1945 (three
in 1928) to twenty-one in 1968. This increase was largely the result of
Assembly formation in Europe between 1953 and 1962 (see Table 3).

Of note was the general pattern of this, with the initial formation
of four multi-country, regional Assemblies (one in 1953, and three in

1957), and their subsequent breakdown into their component national
units (1962). During this same period, three of the four original bi-na-
tional Assemblies (Germany-Austria, United States-Canada, Austra-
lia-New Zealand) also dissolved into their component units, and the
discontiguous American states of Alaska and Hawaii formed separate
"National" Assemblies. The process of forming National Assemblies
in Europe continued after 1968, all countries outside of the Commu-
nist East, apart from Malta and the various "micro-states" (Andorra,
Liechtenstein, Monaco, San Marino, and the Vatican City), having
their own National Spiritual Assemblies by 1978. More recently, the
Canary Islands and Sicily have formed separate Assemblies, as has the
dependency of Greenland.

Other achievements in the West included the construction of
Baha'i Houses of Worship in Australia (1957-1961) and West Ger-
many (1960-1964)—with Wilmette, the West now has three out of a
world total of seven; the establishment of administrative headquarters

for each national Baha'i community; the establishment of Baha'i pub-
lishing trusts for all the major European languages; a massive increase
in the range of literature available in the major European languages;
and a concerted endeavor to produce literature in the minority lan-
guages of Europe and North America.

The Fourth Phase: Mass Teaching, c. 1969 Onwards
BY THE 1960S,      active Baha'i communities had been established
throughout Western Europe, North America, and the Anglo-Pacific.
Baha'i communities remained small, however, and the Baha'is were
frustrated by their inability to discover any way of securing a rapid in-
crease in numbers. The onset of "mass teaching" and large-scale con-
versions in various parts of Latin America, sub-Saharan Africa, and
Asia—which occurred from the 1950s onwards—only highlighted the
comparative lack of growth in the West. The change in the West came
in the late 1960s and early 1970s, with a series of large influxes of new
Baha'is.

The primary trigger for this new growth appears to have been the
Baha'i response to changes in the semi-autonomous and transnational
youth culture, which by the 1960s, had grown to incorporate or influ-
ence significant numbers of young people in nearly all Western coun-
tries. These changes in the youth culture led to a sudden and
widespread growth of social reformism and experimentation. As a
non-traditional religious movement committed to concepts of social
change, the Baha'i Faith was potentially attractive to those influenced
by the youth culture. Successful adaptation of Baha'i teaching meth-
ods by some local Baha'i groups led to relatively large numbers of
youth converts. News of these successes was rapidly transmitted to
other Western Baha'i communities, which then sought to emulate
them—invariably with a measure of success. Nearly all Western
Baha'i communities gained new converts from the youth culture.

The influx of new young Baha'is had a major transformative ef-
fect on the existing Baha'i communities. From being an often neg-
lected minority, young Baha'is suddenly became the "spearhead" of
growth. Possessing abundant energy and often more discretionary free
time than their elders, they were able to make a major contribution to

the further expansion of their religion, not just among other youth, but
among various sections of the population. This subsidiary expansion
was particularly marked in the United States, where teams of mainly
young Baha'is successfully sought to teach their religion to the hith-
erto neglected rural black population of the southern states. The results
were impressive, with over 20,000 Baha'i enrollments from these
areas being recorded during 1970 and the early months of 1971
alone.35 Conversions of other minority group members were also
made. As a result of these gains, the Western Baha'i population tripled
in size between 1968 and 1973—from about 41,000 to about 126,500
(see Table 1). Expansion in North America was greatest in both ab-
solute and proportional terms (74,000 or an increase of 23%). Propor-
tionally, Australia and New Zealand (2,800 or 187%) were more
successful than Europe (8,300 or 93%) (see Table 4).

This expansion was difficult to maintain. The youth culture itself
was highly volatile, and by the early to mid-1970s it had begun to
change again. In common with various other movements of alternative
religiosity, the Baha'is found that their influx of young converts was

slackening off. There was also the major problem of integrating new
Baha'is into established Baha'i communities. There were often con-
siderable cultural differences between the older Baha'is—predomi-

nantly white and middle-class, with fairly conservative styles of cul-
tural expression—and a proportion of the new Baha'is: youth who
were influenced by the anti-establishment elements of the youth cul-
ture; and often poor, and poorly educated, rural African Americans.
There were also the logistical problems of socializing large numbers of
new Baha'is into Baha'i norms and values, when the Baha'i commu-
nities themselves possessed only limited resources in terms of trained
and available personnel. These logistical problems were particularly
severe in the United States, and there as elsewhere, a proportion of the
new converts subsequently ceased to be Baha'is or drifted into inac-
tivity.

There were also intense debates within some of the national Baha'i
communities, both about the wisdom of seeking large-scale conver-
sions (and hence relaxing the traditionally strict entrance require-
ments) and, more implicitly, about the need to maintain the traditional
cultural values of those communities. Generally, there was a signifi-
cant shift in the cultural style of Baha'i activities—including a greater
use of music and the development of a more varied range of meet-
ings—as Baha'i communities successfully incorporated a significant
proportion of new Baha'is. There were undoubtedly considerable dif-
ferences in the rates of success in the various communities.

The combination of these external and internal factors resulted in
a dramatic downturn in the rate of Baha'i expansion from the mid-
1970s onwards (see Table 4). This was despite a large-scale influx of
Iranian Baha'is into many Western Baha'i communities following the
Islamic Revolution of 1979. For the West as a whole, the 206% in-
crease of the 1968-1973 period was followed by increases of only 23%
and 21% percent for the two following five-year periods (1973-1978,

1978-1983), while for the 1983-1988 period, the rate fell even lower
to 13%. These figures closely follow changes in the North American
community (over 80% of the whole Western Baha'i population for
nearly all of this period). Australia and New Zealand, by contrast,
maintained a fairly high level of growth—40%, 17%, and 43% re-
spectively for the three successive five-year periods (1973-1978,

1978-1983, 1983-1988)—while European growth (already less
marked than the other two regions) fell to 15%, 5%, and 18% for the
three periods. By 1988, there were over 200,000 Western Baha'is, as

[J( ILwU   II

compared to only 126,500 in 1973, but the rate of growth was appre-
ciably lower.

In conjunction with the lower rate of growth, it is likely that the
Western Baha'i communities were more stable in 1988, than they were
in 1973. The experience of rapid growth forced them to learn ways of
consolidating large numbers of new declarants and subsequently of co-

ordinating appreciably larger Baha'i communities. The apparent
trade-off between growth and stability may not always hold, and it
may well be that the Western Baha'i communities are now more able
to cope successfully with unexpected rapid growth than they were in
the early 1970s. Certainly, they continue to seek rapid growth, and the
experience of rapid growth seems to have transformed Western
Baha'is' understanding of what is achievable.

Apart from the growth in numbers, the period since the late 1960s
has been marked by a major change in the public visibility of Western
Baha'i communities. Outside of North America, it seems reasonable to
suppose that in the 1960s, the Baha'i Faith was largely unknown to the
general public. This is not the case now, as has been evidenced by the
large amount of media coverage the Baha'is have attracted throughout
the West in recent years, largely as a result of the combination of pub-
lic interest in the persecution of Baha'is in post-revolutionary Iran
(1979-) and the Western Baha'is' success in mobilizing media atten-

tion. The persecutions in Iran have also attracted considerable sym-
pathy from public figures and bodies in the West, as have the issuing
of the Universal House of Justice's statement, The Promise of World
Peace (1985) and growing Baha'i involvement in socio-economic de-

velopment projects.

The Former Eastern Bloc. The communist regime in Russia and the
various communist governments which were established in Eastern
Europe after World War II pursued militantly anti-religious policies
which prevented Baha'i activities from continuing or starting. The sit-
uation changed dramatically with the collapse of these regimes from
1989 onwards, and the break-up of the Soviet Union (1991). Whereas
previously there had been a number of isolated individual Baha'is in
several of these countries, organized meetings and proclamation events
—such as tours by Western and Third World music groups—very rap-

idly led to the growth of Baha'i communities in all these countries. By

1992, a total of 112 local Spiritual Assemblies had been established in
the region, and a process of National Assembly formation had begun,
with 13 new Assemblies formed by 1998 (Table 3). The countries to
have shown the most marked response were Albania and Romania, with
large numbers of new Baha'is. Conditions in the former Yugoslavia
proved the most difficult, with National Assembly formation only being
possible in Slovenia and Croatia (in 1994, with a joint Assembly).

The Bahá is in the West as an Element
in the Overall Development of the Baha'i Faith
THE BAHA'I FAITH    is a global religion and the Western Baha'is are only
one element in the worldwide population of believers. As a proportion
of the whole, the number of Western Baha'is has always been com-
paratively limited. Up to the 1950s, the Baha'i Faith remained over-
whelmingly Iranian in its social base. By the early 1950s, there may
have been approximately 200,000 Baha'is worldwide, but no more

than 10,000 were Westerners. The rest were almost all Iranians, in-
cluding a significant proportion of the Arab and Indian Baha'i com-
munities. The number of "Third World Baha'is" outside the Islamic
heartland was negligible. This picture changed dramatically when
large numbers of Baha'i converts began to be gained in various parts
of the (non-Islamic) Third World from the late-1950s onwards. How-
ever, even after the beginnings of large-scale expansion in the West
(late-1960s), the number of Western Baha'is remained comparatively
small. By 1968, there may have been as many as 1.2 million Baha'is
worldwide. Of these, only 41,000 were in the West, that is, 3.4 percent
of the world total. By 1988, world numbers had risen to 4.5 million,
but Western numbers had only risen to 214,000, or 4.8 percent of the

total. Despite small numbers. Western Baha'is have played a pro-
foundly significant role in the overall development of the Bahá'i reli-
gion. This impact has been in terms of its expansion, the development
of its administration, and the diversification of its cultural expressions
and intellectual life.

Expansion. The importance of the role of Western Baha'is in Baha'i
expansion dates from the first establishment of Baha'i groups in the
West in the 1890s. This period marked the decisive socio-cultural
breakthrough by which the Baha'i movement transcended the Islamic
milieu of its birth and demonstrated the transcultural nature of its ap-
peal. Earlier converts outside the Iranian milieu or its cultural outliers
in Central Asia and India had been few.

The conversion of Westerners brought important new resources to
the development of the religion. Unlike their Middle Eastern co-reli-
gionists, the new Western Baha'is enjoyed religious freedom. They
were largely unconstrained by opposition or persecution. They were
also comparatively well-educated and affluent, and more subtly, were
members of the dominant high-status culture of most of the world. Not
only were they able to undertake the task of propagating the Baha'i
Faith within their own societies, but they were able to contribute sig-
nificantly to the expansion of the religion into new geographical areas.
The geographical mobility of some of the Western Baha'is was a major
factor in the religion's further diffusion. By the 1920s, North Ameri-
can Baha'is had already attempted to establish Baha'i groups in Japan,
South Africa, and various parts of Latin America. With the later adop-
tion of systematic planning goals, these efforts were intensified. Dur-
ing the first and second American Seven Year Plans (1937-1944,
1946-1953), a network of American Baha'i "pioneers" was established
throughout much of Latin America and the Caribbean. With the
British-coordinated Africa project (1951-1953) and the Ten Year Cru-
sade (1953-1963), Europeans, Canadians, Australians, and New
Zealanders also began to play a significant role in the religion's inter-
national expansion, particularly in Africa and the Pacific. Western
Baha'is have continued to play a disproportionate role in international
Baha'i pioneering up to the present time. Thus, during the Interna-
tional Seven-Year Plan of 1979-1986, there were some 3,694 pioneer
moves. Of these, the largest single group was made up of Baha'is of
Iranian background (over 1,900), but there were also some 1,100
Americans and Canadians, while the Anglo-Pacific and many of the

European communities were also prominent sources of pioneers.

Apart from pioneering. Western Baha'is have also acted as itiner-
ant religious teachers—most famously, the much-traveled American

The Baha'i Faith in the West: A Survey   29

journalist, Martha Root (1872-1939)42—and have visited and encour-
aged the Baha'i communities in other parts of the world. Even in the
early 1900s, Westerners were visiting the Baha'is of Egypt, the Lev-
ant, Iran, Central Asia, and India, their very presence demonstrating
the unity and universal appeal of the new religion. They also sought to
offer practical assistance in the form of appeals to the Iranian authori-
ties for religious tolerance, and the initiation of educational and med-
ical projects among the Iranian Baha'is.43 Western Baha'is have also
acted as an important source of financial resources, both for interna-
tional Baha'i projects and in the assistance of many of the poorer
Baha'i communities of the Third World. The importance of this finan-
cial role has increased since the Islamic revolution in Iran cut off what
was traditionally the major source of international Baha'i funding.

Administration. The second major area in which Western Baha'is have
made a significant contribution to the development of the Baha'i Faith
as a whole has been in relationship to the Administrative Order. Baha'i
administrative institutions existed in Iran from an early date, but the
modern system of directive Assemblies and their subsidiary institu-
tions, together with the use of systematic planning, was pioneered
largely in the West under the guidance of Shoghi Effendi and in con-
sultation with such prominent Western Baha'is as Horace Holley
(1887-1960), long-time secretary of the American National Assem-
bly.44 As described above, many administrative innovations were first
made in North America and then extended to other Baha'i communi-
ties.

Some indication of this leading administrative role can be gained
from the figures for Assembly formation. In 1928, despite constituting
only a tiny minority of the total Baha'i population, Western Baha'is
had formed some sixty-seven percent of the world total of local Spiri-

tual Assemblies (68 out of 102). Even by 1987, they still formed over
16% (3,020 out of 19,273), while they constituted less than five per-

cent of the world Baha'i population.

viet Azerbaijan.

Another important indicator is the high level of administrative

functioning in the Western Baha'i communities (Table 5). Thus, for
the West as a whole, 76% of local Assemblies reported in 1987, that
they held the regular Nineteen-Day Feast, which is the religious focus
of Baha'i community life. Some 71% also reported that the Assembly
itself held regular business meetings. Considering that the local Baha'i
communities in the West are mostly quite small, and that the Faith
itself has very few professional administrators (and no priesthood),
and thus must rely on the voluntary endeavors of its rank and file
members, these are impressively high figures. They compare with
34% of Assemblies worldwide holding Feasts and 30% holding regu-
lar meetings. These more modest figures reflect the greater difficulty
in administrative functioning that is experienced by many Third-World
Baha'i communities.

Western prominence in the development of the Administrative
Order is partly attributable to the prevailing conditions of religious
freedom, which also enabled Baha'i institutions to gain legal recogni-

The Baháí Faith in the West: A Survey    31

tion. A second factor was the resourceful and educated nature of the
Western Baha'i population, a factor that probably accounts for the high
level of administrative functioning in the West.

This second factor also enabled Western Baha'is to play a promi-
nent role in the development of the Faith's international and Third-
World leadership. Western Baha'is often acted as the primary agents of
diffusion of the Baha'i administrative system, and they were subse-
quently prominent among the memberships of both the National Spir-
itual Assemblies and Auxiliary Boards throughout much of the Third
World. Their role has since lessened with the increasing number of in-
digenous believers in positions of leadership, but Westerners often still
occupy leadership positions in many Baha'i communities of the Third
World.

As regards the Baha'i Faith's international leadership, it is signif-
icant that of the thirty-six individuals who were appointed by Shoghi
Effendi as Hands of the Cause (1951-1957) or as members of the first
International Baha'i Council (1951-1961), twenty-three (sixty-four
percent) were Westerners. Of the rest, twelve were Iranian and one was
Ugandan. Similarly, of the twenty individuals elected to the second In-
ternational Baha'i Council (1961-1963) or the Universal House of
Justice (from 1963 up to 1998), fifteen were Westerners (eleven Amer-
icans, two British, one Australian, one Canadian), and five were Irani-
ans (all with strong links outside of Iran). Finally, of the sixty-seven
Counsellors appointed in 1980, twenty-six (thirty-nine percent) were
Westerners.48

Cultural Expressions. The third area in which Western Baha'is have
played a prominent role in the overall development of the Baha'i Faith
has been in the diversification of its cultural expressions and intellec-
tual life.49 Even though the early Western Baha'i groups were quite
small when they were first established, they significantly expanded the
range of ways in which the Baha'i movement found cultural expres-
sion. The Western groups were not occidental transplantations of Iran-
ian or Middle Eastern Baha'i culture. The Western Baha'is developed
their own cultural expressions of their religion, as for example, in the
forms of their meetings and organizations, their use of American
Protestant religious styles (such as hymnody), and—most con-
sciously—their development of distinctively Western presentations of

the Baha'i teachings,50 Although some early Western Baha'is were
given Persian names by 'Abdu'1-Bahá, and there was widespread use
of some oriental terms, such as the salutation Alláh-u-Abhá, oriental
forms in general were not adopted. Baha'is retained their Western per-
sonal names, behavioral styles, dress, and appearance. (This contrasts
markedly with the behavior of converts to some other "immigrant" re-
ligions.)

The development of distinctively Western presentations of the
Baha'i teachings has as yet been little researched. Quite clearly, the
Western Baha'is lived in a different cultural and intellectual milieu
from their co-religionists in the Middle East. In reflecting on their new
religion and, more specifically, in attempting to present it to their
American, British, French, and German compatriots, the early Western
Baha'is were necessarily concerned with their own cultural issues.
This is quite clearly shown by the types of questions they addressed to
fc

Abdu'l-Bahá. For example. The early text Some Answered Questions
(1908) deals with topics such as biblical interpretation, Christian doc-
trine, evolutionism, reincarnation, spiritual healing, and industrial dis-
putes.51 It is also shown by the writings of early Western exponents of
Baha'i teachings, such as I. G. Kheiralla, Hippolyte Dreyfus, Charles
Mason Remey, Horace Holley, and John E. Esslemont.52 'Abdu'l-
Bahá took a very active role in shaping the development of Baha'i be-
lief in the West, but this development can best be understood as an
interactive process between him and his followers. A similar interac-
tive process occurred during the leadership of Shoghi Effendi, with in-
dividuals such as Holley and George Townshend making major
contributions to the development of BaháM thinking. More recently,
the enormous expansion of Western Baha'i secondary literature re-
flects the continued contribution of Western Baha'is in this area. The
prominent role of Westerners in the recent development of Baha'i
scholarship should also be noted.

Given the general cultural dominance of the West in the modern
world, Western BaháM ways of doing things have had a major influ-
ence on Baha'i communities outside the West. The most important sin-
gle instance of this has been the emergence of English as the principal
language of international Baha'i communication, but it is also ex-
pressed in the preeminence of Western Baha'i secondary literature and
the prominence of Western styles in areas such as form of meetings,
dress, and music.

Distribution and Social Composition
DETAILED STATISTICS    for the number and distribution of Western
Baha'is are not readily available, but such data as we now have sug-
gest three generalizations: 1) there has been a marked and persistent
disparity between expansion in various parts of the West, most notably
between North America and Europe; 2) within Europe, success has
varied considerably between different parts of the continent; and 3)
apart from certain exceptional areas and despite the recent larger num-
ber of conversions, the Baha'i population in the West remains small.
Area Contrasts. The Baha'i Faith in the West began in the United
States, but from there diffused fairly rapidly to Canada and the major
states of Europe. Despite this widespread diffusion, the Baha'i groups
in Europe, and later in Australia and New Zealand, remained minute
until after the Second World War. The United States remained the only
Western Baha'i community of any size. There was then slow, but sus-
tained expansion in many countries until the 1960s and the start of the
period of mass teaching. The overall rates of increase during this period
varied between countries, with those for Australia, New Zealand, and
North America greatly exceeding that for Europe.

• .11 I U . U II

The comparative situation in the three component areas (North
America, Europe, and Australia-New Zealand) in 1988 is shown in
Table 6. What is of note here is not only that the North American
Baha'is (c. 179,000) then constituted some eighty-four percent of the
Western Baha'i population (Europeans, 11.5% with c. 24,500; Aus-
tralians and New Zealanders, 4.7% with c. 10,000), but that within
their own area, the North American Baha'is had the highest population
density, with some 658 Baha'is per million, compared with 68 per mil-
lion in non-communist Europe and 500 per million for Australia and
New Zealand. Clearly, there was (and still is) a marked contrast be-
tween the fairly high degree of penetration of their societies which the
North American, Australian, and New Zealand Baha'is have attained,
and the low degree attained by their European co-religionists.

Country Comparisons. The degree of penetration a religious group has
achieved within a particular society is an important measure of suc-
cess. In the case of the Baha'is, population density figures on a coun-
try-by-country basis are not at present available. It is therefore useful
to introduce an alternative measure of degree of penetration, namely,
the number of Baha'i local Spiritual Assemblies per million population
(see Table 7).»

These figures again show a clear contrast between the relatively
high degree of penetration in North America (7.8 Assemblies per mil-
lion) and Australia/New Zealand (11.2), and the low degree of pene-
tration in non-communist Europe (1.8). The particularly high figure
for Australia/New Zealand is accounted for by the much smaller aver-
age size of their local communities (45 BaháMs per Assembly as com-
pared to North America's 85 per Assembly).

In terms of individual differences between countries (Tables 8 and 9),
we may note that the highest Assembly densities were in Iceland (60)
and Luxembourg (30). These were then followed by the four non-Eu-
ropean states: New Zealand, Canada, Australia, and the United States
(ranging from 18.2 to 7.3). Of the remaining European states, seven
had densities over 3.0: Cyprus, Ireland, Switzerland, Norway, Finland,
the United Kingdom, and Sweden; five had densities between 1.8 (the
European average) and 2.5: Austria, Malta, Denmark, Portugal, and
the Netherlands; and six had densities of 1.5 or less: Spain,

The Bahái Faith in the West: A Survey   37

West Germany, Belgium, Italy, France, and Greece. Of note is the
complete absence of any local Assemblies in then communist Eastern
Europe.

The only clear pattern that emerges from these figures is the higher
densities for the non-European states and a general tendency for those
European states that are predominantly Protestant to have higher As-
sembly densities than those that are predominantly Roman Catholic or
Eastern Orthodox (2.6 as compared with 1.2). Even here, there are im-
portant exceptions, as in the case of Catholic Ireland (5.4) and West
Germany (1.5) with its Protestant majority. Further research is evi-
dently needed, but no general theory to account for these differences
as yet presents itself. There are, however, a number of factors that may
be relevant.

The most evident of these is government opposition to religious
missionary activity. Generally speaking, unless a religion is already
well established in a society, effective government opposition will pre-
vent or greatly restrict its expansion. Such certainly was the case for
the Baha'is of Spain, Portugal, Greece, and Eastern Europe until the
political liberalization of their countries.

A second factor that appears to be relevant is the Baha'i emphasis
on achieving widespread diffusion of their religion. The establishment
of even one local Assembly in a country or territory with a small pop-
ulation will produce a high Assembly density figure (e.g. Malta with
one Assembly and a density of 2.5). Generally then, those countries
with very small populations tend to have higher density figures, as in
the cases of Luxembourg (30) and Iceland (60), both of which have
populations of less than one million. There is still a great deal of vari-
ation between countries of similar population size, however, as for ex-
ample, between the United Kingdom (3.3) and Italy (0.9), both with
populations of (then) 56 million, or as between Portugal (2.4) and
Greece (0.4), both with populations of 10 million.

A third possible factor is the degree to which a particular culture
accepts alternative forms of religiosity. Those states in which there is
considerable religious diversity (such as those of North America and
the Anglo-Pacific) generally have higher densities than those in which
there is little diversity and in which conversion to a non-traditional re-
ligion is correspondingly a more socially deviant act. This is a difficult
relationship to establish with any degree of certainty, however; and

~ J   :}

there are notable exceptions such as Catholic-majority Portugal and
Ireland. Local factors are also undoubtedly of considerable impor-
tance. However, a full consideration of such factors will require more
research.

Size. The differences in Assembly densities and the differences in de-
gree of penetration they reflect are important, but they also need to be
put in the context of the overall small size of the Western Baha'i com-
munities, particularly in Europe. Even in North America, the Baha'i
population represents only some 0.066 percent of the total population,
and the European Baha'i population represents less than 0.007 percent

of its total population. Considering that this is after ninety years of
Baha'i activity in the West, these are not high figures—particularly
when compared with some parts of the Third World where the histor-
ical depth of Baha'i expansion is much more recent. Thus, in 1986, of
thirty-four listed countries or territories with an adult Baha'i popula-
tion equal to or in excess of 1% of the total adult population, only
one—Alaska, with 1.43%—was in the West, the rest being in Africa
(four), Asia (three), Latin America and the Caribbean (twelve), and the

Pacific Islands (fourteen).

Social composition. There have been few studies of the social compo-
sition of the Western Baha'is, but the overall impression is that until
comparatively recently, urban, middle-class, white Protestants were
the predominant group in most Western Baha'i communities. The fol-
lowing section provides an overview of five socio-demographic vari-
ables: (i) gender, (ii) age, (iii) class and occupation, (iv) race and

ethnicity, and (v) religious background.

(I) GENDER

Females have generally outnumbered males. The predominance of fe-
males is apparent in a variety of surveys, sample surveys and censuses
(Table 10). Approximately two-thirds of the American converts prior

to 1900 were female, and a similar proportion is shown in studies of
American Baha'is up to the 1950s, as also of Danish Baha'is in the late
1950s. More recent data for the 1979-1981 period from Britain, New

The Bahá í Faith in the West: A Survey      39

Zealand, Denmark, and Los Angeles shows a slight predominance of
females over males (54-56%). Only one data set (Austria, 1976) shows
a female minority (44%). In the Danish case, this more equal sex ratio
is partly due to the incorporation of Iranian Baha'is into the commu-
nity, the native Danish Baha'is being 59% female.58 It is of note that
despite their smaller number, men have tended to be predominant in

Western Baha'i leadership roles. However, women have always con-
stituted an important minority of leaders. More detailed statistics are
not at present available to the author, but as of 1988, some 37% of Na-
tional Spiritual Assembly members and 42% of Auxiliary Board mem-
bers in the Americas as a whole (that is, including Latin America) were
women. The comparable figures for Europe were 28% and 31%, and

for Australasia as a whole 26% for both.

(u) AGE

Most of the early surveys of Baha'i membership concentrated on
adult members. Indeed, for many years there was a tendency for only
adult Baha'is to be fully incorporated into the Western communities.
The predominance of adults is indicated in the 1936-1937 American
data in Table 11, with only a little over 1% of the sample being aged
less than twenty-one. Also of note is that a majority (65%) of the sam-
ple is over the age of forty. It has been noted that the early Australian

Baha'i community was also predominantly middle-aged or elderly.

The Bahíťí Faith in the West: A Survey    4!

Modern Western Baha'i communities have generally shown a very
different age structure, with a general predominance of those under the
age of 41. During the 1970s at least, there was also a significant pro­
portion under the age of 21. The two data sets given for 1979 (United
Kingdom and Los Angeles) are probably not untypical, each with al­
most 20% in the 0-20 age group and well over 40% in the 21-40 group.
In each population, there is a substantial proportion in the 41-60 age
group (30% and 23% respectively), but a relatively small percentage
over the age of 60 (7% and 13%). The method of data collection is
likely to have excluded a large number of Baha'i children from these
two samples, so the overall youthfiilness of modern Baha'i popula­
tions is likely to be understated.

(Ill) CLASS AND OCCUPATION
The early American Baha'i community appears to have been gen­

erally middle class. Certainly, those who were prominent within it
included many business and professional men or their wives. It was
also largely urban at a time when most Americans were still living in
small towns and rural areas. There were, however, marked differences

between the various Baha'i communities. Chicago may have been
predominantly middle-class. Thus, in 1899, out of 236 Chicago
Baha'is whose occupation is known (out of a total Baha'i community
of about 790), sixty-five (28%) were professionals (doctors, teachers,
engineers and lawyers, etc.), twenty (8%) of the men were in business,
fifty-five (23%) were clerks, stenographers or bookkeepers, and a
number were skilled artisans. There were none of the very rich or the
highly educated. Nor were there any factory workers.63 By contrast
with Chicago, the Baha'i community of Kenosha, Wisconsin, seems to
have been predominantly working-class. In 1899, out of eighty-one
Baha'is whose occupation is known (out of a total Baha'i community
of about 191), forty-three were "employees," "laborers," or machin­
ists. There were also a small number of skilled artisans, engineers and
small businessmen.64 Information on other local Baha'i communities
is more sketchy. New York City and some of the other East Coast com­
munities included Baha'is who were prominent businessmen and pro­
fessionals or who were members of the social elite, but there were also
clerks and skilled artisans. The Cincinnati community appears to have
resembled Chicago in its social composition; that of Racine (Wiscon­
sin) resembled Kenosha.65

The predominantly middle class status of many Western BaháM
communities is also suggested by some more recent data on occupa-
tional distribution for populations or sample populations in several
countries (Tables 12 and 13). Of these, the sample surveys of New
York, Los Angeles, and the United Kingdom most clearly reveal a pre-
dominance of professional, business, administrative and clerical occu-
pations, together with a sizeable number of (potentially middle-class)
college students in the latter two cases. Taken together, these groups
constitute some 75% (New York), 73% (Los Angeles) and 70% (U.K.)

The Bdhďf Faith in the West: A Survey      43

of the sample populations. By contrast, the combined totals for skilled,
and semi- and unskilled manual workers amounts to only about one-
tenth of each sample (10%, 9%, and 8% respectively). By contrast, the
New Zealand survey reveals a much larger proportion of manual
workers (19.5%) and unemployed (3.1%). Even here, students and the
middle-class occupations comprise 47% of the population. It may also
be that many in the large category of housewives (23.8% in New
Zealand) are also members of middle-class households, but this is un­
certain.

The Austrian data (Table 13) is less easy to interpret, the category
of "workers" being quite vague, and the categories of school children
(non-class specific) and college students being combined. However,
the contrast between the Baha'i and national figures is clear, the
BaháMs having an appreciably larger proportion of clerical workers
and civil servants (1.7 times as many), self-employed (x 2.1), and
housewives (x 1.6), but an appreciably smaller proportion of "work-

Coc

ers" (x 0.27). A marked difference in age structure is also suggested,
the Baha'is having 1.5 times as large a proportion of school children
and students as the nation as a whole, but only about one-tenth of the
proportion of pensioners.

As between the various middle-class categories, the largest in each
case is that of professionals (the less specific Austrian data is here ex-
cluded), business, administrative and clerical categories being signifi-
cantly less well represented. Within the category of professionals, no
one type of profession is consistently over-represented. In Berger's
New York study, seventeen out of the thirty-seven professionals (al-
most half) were identified as members of the "marginal intelligentsia,"
a type which Berger implied might be particularly attracted to the

Baha'i teachings. This type is less well represented in the Los Ange-
les (eleven out of twenty-six) and British (five out of thirty-seven)
samples, but it is notable that ten out of the sixty-five New Zealand
professionals were specifically identified as "artists." Another type
well represented is that of the medical and "caring" professions. These
comprised nineteen out of thirty-seven in Britain, thirteen out of thirty-
seven in New York, and six out of twenty-six in Los Angeles.

Another indication of the predominantly middle-class composition
of Western Baha'i communities is provided by the high educational
levels recorded in several sets of survey data. We find 28.5% and
26\.6%, respectively, of participants in the British and New Zealand
surveys had either received or were receiving degree level education
(8.6 percent of the British sample at higher degree level), and a further
12\.6% of the British sample had received or were in pursuit of other
higher certificates.67 An American (1968) and the New Zealand sur-
veys also recorded significantly higher educational levels among the
Baha'is than in the national populations.68 Of those taking or possess-
ing degrees, no particular subject bias was discernible in the British
sample.

A third indication of at least the British Baha'is' middle-class sta-
tus lies in their readership of newspapers. Of 151 individuals, forty-
one obtained copies of one or more "quality" dailies (Guardian,
Telegraph, or Times), while a further seventeen only obtained copies
of a Sunday quality paper or periodical (especially the American Time
magazine). Of those who did not obtain quality papers, ten obtained
copies of the up-market tabloids (Express and Mail)y seven obtained

The Baha'i Faith in the West: A Survey    45

copies of other popular dailies, and 76 reported reading no national
newspapers at all. No marked political bias was discernible in the
choice of papers. Sixty-nine individuals also subscribed to one or more
magazines, but no overall trend seemed evident in their choice.69

As to class mobility, only the British sample survey contained per-
tinent data, although the high rate of non-response (36%) to the ques-
tion about parental occupation must cast doubt on its usefulness. Of
those who responded to this question, most of those employed (thirty-
one out of forty-eight) had fathers in the same occupational category
as themselves; 68.0% of the fathers were categorized as professional
or business, 3.1% as clerical, and 28.9% as manual. Despite the low
response rate, some definite upward mobility is suggested by these fig-
ures. While only eleven individuals were currently in manual occupa-
tions, at least twenty-eight had fathers who were so engaged.70

These various data sets are indicative of what has probably been
the prevailing class composition of most (if not all) Western Baha'i
communities for most of their history. That is, while there has always
been some diversity of class membership, middle-class groups have
always been disproportionately over-represented, even when they
have not constituted an absolute majority of the membership. By con-
trast, working-class and socially elite groups have been greatly under-
represented. This is not necessarily a fixed pattern. The conversion of
members of North American minority groups—notably reservation-
living Amerindians and rural southern black Americans, both groups
which have been at the bottom of the North American class structure—
indicates that the potential appeal of the Baha'i Faith in the West is not
limited to a single class category. The long-term success of the Baha'is
in appealing to such groups and successfully incorporating them fully
into their community structures has yet to be adequately assessed,
however. Given that middle-class leadership and cultural styles appear
to continue to be dominant within Western Baha'i communities, it may
well be that members of these minority groups who are more upwardly
mobile will be fully integrated, while others who are not will be
merely encapsulated as members of essentially marginal enclaves
within the community as a whole.71 The geographical localization of
the majority of these minority group members could well encourage
such encapsulization.

(IV) RACE AND ETHNICITY

In North America, the overwhelming majority of early Baha'is
were white, but some black converts were made from the 1890s on-
wards. The BaháM teachings concerning racial equality distinguished
it from most other white-dominated American religious organizations
of the time. Black Baha'is became a significant minority of BaháM'
membership. By the 1930s, some 7% of the community was black, as
were 13% of a sample of newly declared Baha'is in 1968 (Table 14).72
Since then, the proportion of black Baha'is has massively increased,
not only in the southern states where large-scale enrollments have oc-
curred, but also in urban communities such as Los Angeles (Table 14),
where 23% of the sample were black.

Canada, where in the early 1960s, Amerindians comprised as much as

one-quarter of the Baha'i community.

Of white Americans, the majority of early Baha'i converts were of
northwest European origin, whether native-bom or recent immigrants

(there were appreciable numbers of both). By national origin, the
largest group was of British stock (33% of the 1936-1937 sample, and
38% of those sample members that had become Baha'is by 1919), fol­
lowed by Germans (15% and 34% respectively) and Scandinavians
(7% and 8%). Almost all were former Protestants. The Irish and east­
ern and southern European groups mostly non-Protestants, and who
at that time were of much lower social status—were little represented.
Outside North America, at present we have little data. In common with
Baha'i teaching endeavors throughout the rest of the world, Western
minority groups have often been specially targeted for teaching. Thus,
in Europe alone, Baha'i literature has been produced in some seventy
separate languages and dialects,75 and systematic attempts have been
made to gain converts among such groups as the Lapps (Same), Ro­
many, and Chinese. However, apart from refugees from Portugal's for­
mer African territories and Turkish migrants, significant numbers of
conversions do not appear to have taken place. The British Baha'i
community may be indicative here, the substantial minorities of peo­
ples of Afro-Caribbean, South Asian, or Chinese origin or descent
being almost entirely unrepresented. In my 1979 sample survey (Table
14), there was a small "new-commonwealth" element (most of the
7\.3% "other"), but most of these were students or medical workers
from the Indian Ocean islands and Malaysia, and were likely to have
become Baha'is before their arrival in Britain. Greater success in
teaching minority peoples has been achieved in the Anglo-Pacific, not
only in the cosmopolitan state of Hawaii, but also in New Zealand and
Australia, where there are numbers of Maori and Aboriginal Baha'is.

Of considerable importance in almost all Western Baha'i commu­
nities are numbers of Iranian Baha'is. Iranians have constituted an ac­
tive element in some Western Baha'i communities since the early
1900s. But it is only since the troubled years which led up to the Is­
lamic Revolution in Iran (1979) that large numbers of Iranians have
settled in the West. In the British and Los Angeles sample surveys, Ira­
nians constituted close to one third of the populations (32% in each),

•too   11 c i i

and it is likely that in some communities the proportion is even higher.
The effect of this influx has varied considerably. While in some com-
munities the Iranian Baha'is have become an active and well-inte-
grated element within the Baha'i population as a whole, it is evident
that this has not always occurred, and that major cultural divisions de-
veloped at least initially within some Western communities between
indigenous and Iranian Baha'is. Studies in Britain and Italy suggest
that, in those countries at least, the Iranian immigrants became well in-
tegrated quite quickly in terms of administrative involvement in their
host Baha'i communities. There was also a high level of intermarriage
between the Iranians and local Baha'is.76

(V) RELIGIOUS BACKGROUND

Excluding Iranian Baha'i immigrants, the majority of Western
Baha'is are first-generation converts. In the United States, in particu-
lar, there are families that have been Baha'i for several generations,
but these are a minority in the Baha'i population as a whole. Some in-
dication of this is provided by the data in Table 15. Excluding Middle
Easterners from the Los Angeles and British samples (i.e., reading
columns 4b and 5b), those of Baha'i background in each survey are in
the range of 4.5% to 7%.

Until fairly recently, the vast majority of Westerners who became
Baha'is were of Protestant background. This was true throughout the
West, and in Europe was reflected in the much slower growth of the
religion in those countries that are predominantly Roman Catholic or
Eastern Orthodox. Greater numbers of Catholic converts have been
gained in recent years, but overall, Protestants (active or nominal) still
constitute the predominant source of new Western Baha'is outside of
the former Communist states. This predominance is reflected in Table

15. Again excluding Iranians from the Los Angeles and British sam-
ples, the percentage of Protestants in the surveys ranges from 41.3%
(Los Angeles) to 65% (USA, 1968), while the percentage of Catholics
ranges from 5.2% (North America, 1936-37) to 15% (USA, 1968).
Several surveys also record an appreciable percentage of individuals
(6.0%-16.6%) who identified themselves only as having been "Chris-
tians," but whom it might be assumed were Protestants. As regards the
type of Protestants that have become Baha'is, it would appear that, at

least in Britain and North America, the majority has been drawn from
the mainstream churches and denominations, rather than from the
smaller and less conventional Protestant groups. Some indication of
this is provided in Table 16, which shows some 33% of the sample
being drawn from the main "Anglo-Saxon" churches, while a further
11% is drawn from the "German/Scandinavian" Lutheran churches.
The relatively large proportion (5%) of ultra-liberal Unitarians and
Universalists is also of note in this sample of early Baha'is.

The survey data includes an appreciable number of marginal- and
non-Christians. In Table 15, these comprise Jews (2.5% to 4% in the
country surveys excluding Iranians, 13.8% and 16.7% in the Los An-
geles and New York City samples); Eastern religions (mostly Buddhist
or Indian, 0% to 5.5%); unorthodox Western religious groups such as
the Latter-Day Saints (Mormons) and Christian Scientists (2.25 to

6\.5%); and individuals without a former religion (7% to 15.4%). The
large proportion of the non-religious and, in certain localities, Jews is
noteworthy. Of those drawn from the unorthodox Western groups, the
majority in the earlier American samples (North America, 1936-1937;
New York, 1953) were former members of the various "metaphysical"
groups such as Christian Science, New Thought, and Spiritualism. The
large number of early converts drawn from this background has also
been noted in more qualitative research accounts.77 In the more recent
surveys, there is a greater range of unorthodox backgrounds, several
former Latter-Day Saints being included.

It is not yet possible to generalize about the former theological ori-
entations of Western Baha'is. Certainly, many of the early American
Baha'is were religious liberals, as may be evidenced by the apprecia-
ble number of Unitarian-Universalists and metaphysical group mem-
bers among the early converts. Again, few if any extremely
conservative or fundamentalist Christians appear to have been con-
verted during the period covered by this survey. A range of attitudes is
evident among both the early Western Baha'is and their modern-day
successors, however. Liberal, conservative, and fundamentalist orien-
tations are discernible, and it is likely that these distinctive attitudes
are at least partly traceable to the pre-BaháM worldviews of the adher-
ents. This is a topic that requires further research. The level of previ-
ous religious activity and involvement is another factor of interest.
Again, generalization is not yet possible, beyond noting a considerable
range: from those who formerly had little religious involvement to
those who had been highly active religiously, whether as orthodox
Christians or as religious seekers.

Conclusion
FURTHER STUDY    of the various Western Baha'i communities is evi-
dently necessary. As yet, we have comparatively little material on
which to base any detailed account of the development of the Baha'i
Faith in the West or to describe its present character. Of course, this is
not an isolated lacunae: Baha'i Studies as a whole has tended—so
far—to focus on the history and texts of the earlier "heroic age" of

•   :)•

Baha'i development, and to neglect both more recent developments
and more sociological perspectives. I would hope that the present sum-
mary has the value of alerting readers to some of the research ques-
tions that need to be addressed, and of encouraging other researchers
to take up the work of examining them. Certainly, despite the compar-
atively small number of Baha'is in the West, Western Baha'is and
Western Baha'i communities have played a major role in the develop-
ment of the Baha'i Faith. As such, they constitute an important topic
of enquiry. Again, in terms of the history and sociology of religions in
the West, the Baha'i Faith is surely of interest, constituting as it does
an example of a non-Christian religious movement which has suc-
ceeded in becoming part of Western religiosity, having sustained itself
in the West for over a century, and having now established itself in
every part of the Western world.

8\. Sociologists and BaháMs have developed varying definitions for the basic so-

> body of Baha'is that has not yet formed a local Spiritual Assembly. By con-
> trast, sociologists generally use the term "community" to refer to a relatively
> large group of people who live and work together, and whose basic needs are

> "group" is used to refer to any number of people who interact together and
> have some sense of shared identity, e.g., a family, a formal organization (such
> as the BaháM Faith), or a community. The present work employs the modern
> BaháM usage of "community." Most BaháM "communities" are not in fact
> communities in a sociological sense, but the term is both ubiquitous in BaháM
> literature and is of use as a general referent. However, the BaháM usage of the
> term "group" is overly technical in the present context, and the more general
> sociological usage is retained.

49\. "Cultural expressions" here refers to all formal and informal patterns of be-

> havior and belief that are characteristic of a religious group as a collectivity,
> and which new members acquire through socialization. They include forms
> and styles of interaction between members; the conduct of meetings (both
> formal and informal); forms of organizations; attitudes towards outsiders and
> towards the socialization of children and new members; forms of personal
> behavior and appearance (dress, hair, etc.); and artistic expressions. Intellec-
> tual expressions (folk tales, formal religious codes, scriptural interpretations,
> etc.) constitute a specialized form of cultural expression. As in most religious
> movements, only a few of the cultural expressions of being a Baha'i are
> scripturally prescribed. Most patterns of Baha'i collective life emerge in the
> process of group interaction. In the BaháM case, these now vary quite con-
> siderably from one society to another, no doubt reflecting the BaháM princi-
> ple of tolerance of diversity.
50\. The topic of Western BaháM cultural styles has received little scholarly at-

> tention. See R. Jackson Armstrong-Ingram, Music, Devotions, and
> Mashriqu 'UAdhkar, Studies in Bábi and Bahá 7 History, Vol. 4 (Los Ange-
> les: Kalimát Press, 1987), and Sandra S. Kahn, "Encounter of Two Myths,
> BaháM and Christian, in the Rural American South: A Study in Transmythi-

tional BaháM' periodicals.

53\. Data on the number and location of BaháM' Spiritual Assemblies is readily

> available. A local Spiritual Assembly is generally formed when there are
> nine or more adult BaháMs (aged 21 or over) in a particular locality. As great
> efforts are made to ensure the continued existence of an Assembly after one
> has been formed, its existence indicates a certain minimum level of BaháM
> activity and the presence of what is effectively a BaháM congregation.
54\. Those countries in which there were then no organized BaháM communities

(i.e., Eastern Europe) are here excluded.
