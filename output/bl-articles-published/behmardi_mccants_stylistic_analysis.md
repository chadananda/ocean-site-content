A Stylistic Analysis of the Báb’s Writings
Abridged Annotated Translation of Vahid Behmardi’s “Muqaddamih-yi dar

Abstract
The following is an abridgement of Vahid Behmardi‟s outstanding article on the
style of the Bab‟s Writings.1 I have decided to do this for several reasons.
First, there is a striking lack of communication between Baha‟i scholars who write
in Persian and those who write in English. Of course, much of the Persian writing
on the history and teachings of the Faith is, like English writing, highly derivative.
There are, however, a few notable exceptions, like the work of Vahid Behmardi and
Vahid Rafati, who are engaged in laying the critical foundational work for future
studies (by foundational work, I mean sound and detailed philological studies of
the Baha‟i Scriptures). By making this article accessible to a wider audience, I
hope it will advance dialogue between the two scholarly communities while also
further the development of Baha‟i studies itself.
Second, although the enemies of the Faith and the believers are divided in their
assessment of the Bab‟s style of writing, they do agree on one point: their appraisal
of His writings never moves beyond a superficial evaluation – “it‟s gibberish” or
“it‟s unique.” While Dr. Behmardi‟s article does contain the standard rebuttal of the
former charge, his treatment of the Bab‟s writings is laudable due to his detailed
explanation of the reasoning behind the latter assertion. He touches on most of the
major stylistic features of the Bab‟s writings and provides numerous examples
from His writings to support his conclusions.
As for the format of the article itself, each new thought is preceded by a number
that corresponds with the page number of the article for ease of reference. All
footnotes reflect my own commentary unless otherwise specified.

A Stylistic Analysis of the Báb’s Writings by Vahid Behmardi
Part 1 - Introduction
The style of the Báb‟s writings is new and can‟t be compared with the
standards of style of the people in the past. Therefore, the author will use an
inductive method to talk about the writings of the Báb. Sabk (“style, mode”)
is a term that is applied to ways and means of speaking and writing with
regard to statements and expressions with various phrasings. The Báb uses

vol. 6, p. 47-67)

the terms sha’n or nahj for sabk in His writings. In the Writings of the Báb,
meaning and mode of expression are intimately connected. [Meaning of the
term bayán] Bayán as a technical term of the Báb which He started to use in
Mákú. Its meaning is indicated in the following passage by the Báb in tenth
báb of the second wáhid of the Kitáb al-Asmá:

> “I arranged the Bayán in such wise that when they heard the verses
> of God from His Presence, they all immediately prostrated and did
> not dispute with it [the Bayán] and did not argue and did not think
> within themselves [lá yakhṭiru bi-anfusihim] save by its/his
> command. All who propagated the Bayán and held it close will attain
> [yaḥḍurún]. Moreover, they will prostrate while saying, „This is that
> which God and the essence of the seven letters hath promised us in
> the Bayán, “of which there is no doubt,” [Qur‟an 2:2] which hath
> been sent down from the Lord of the Worlds.‟ ”
Behmardi identifies Him Whom God Shall Make Manifest (man
yuẓhiruhu’llah) as that which is attained and the Báb as the “essence of the
seven letters” (since the name `Alí Muhammad is made up of seven letters).
Based on this passage, Behmardi identifies three different meanings of the
word bayán. First, when the Báb says “I arranged the Bayán,” it means the
Blessed Cause [i.e. the Bábi religion] in general. Second, “all who
propagated the Bayán and held it close” are the people of the Bayán [i.e. the
Bábis]. Third, “This is that which God hath promised in the Bayán” means
the writings of the Báb. It does not only mean the Arabic and Persian Bayán
of the Báb, because in other Writings the promise of the manifestation of
Him Whom God Shall Make Manifest also appears. It has a general
meaning. Of course, the term Bayán is used in other places to specifically
indicate the Kitáb-i Bayán
In the Qur‟an, the word bayán occurs in 3 places. In Sura Al `Imrán and
Sura Rah.mán, it means word and speech. In Sura Qiyáma, the word bayán
is connected with the unveiling and clarification of the meanings of the
Qur‟an:

> Verily, it is incumbent upon Us [God] to collect it and recite it
> [qur‟ánahu]. If we recite it [qara‟náhu], follow thou its recital
> [qur‟ánahu]. Then it is incumbent upon us to explain it [`alayná
> bayánahu].” (Q 75:17-19)
116       Vahid Behmardi & William McCants                                 Behmardi Stylistic Analysis

The meaning of the three verses is clear. God sent down the Qur‟an to
Muhammad and after that He will clarify its truths. Bayán in Arabic means
clarification. The word “then” [which is an `aṭf (conjunction)] in verse 19
indicates that first the Qur‟an is sent down, and then the bayán. So,
according to the verse, God has sent down the Qur‟an and promises to send
down the clarification (bayán). In the context of the Sura, this clarification
is to be sent down on the Day of Resurrection. It will be among the signs of
that Day. Behmardi asserts that until the time of the Báb, no one had
claimed to have the bayán of the Qur‟an. Further, it couldn‟t have come to
pass in the lifetime of Muhammad since the Qur‟an was still being sent
down, and the verse says that the bayán comes when the Qur‟an has
finished being sent down.
Although the Báb wrote commentaries on the Qur‟an, He did not call His
writings “Bayán” until signs that are more eloquent than speech came to
pass indicating that it is the Day of Resurrection. Then the Bayán promised
by God in the Sura of Qiyáma was sent down. Because of this, most of the
Writings of the Báb have one main difference from the Qur‟an with regard
to the mode of writing. Unlike the Qur‟an, the Bayán is in the mode of
explication and giving of details, not absolute brevity. For example, the
divine Names are mentioned in the Qur‟an. However, there is no
explanation of the meaning of these names. Because of this, exegetes gave
several different possible meanings to these names. The writings of the Báb
clarified these names in two ways. First, He compiled the names of the God
from the Qur‟an and added to them. Second, He explained these names in
many of His books and letters. This is one part of the clarification (bayán)
on the Day of Resurrection made manifest by the Báb, as He says in the
Seven Proofs:

Dalá’il-i Sab`ih, Tehran, n.d.: 63. In Behmardi‟s assessment of the term bayán, he relates a standard
Baha‟i explanation of the term as indicating a fulfillment of Qur‟anic prophecy. I would certainly agree that the
Báb saw his writings as a fulfillment of an eschatological prophecy. However, I disagree with Behmardi‟s
117       Vahid Behmardi & William McCants                                Behmardi Stylistic Analysis

Part 2 – The Bab’s Eloquence
In several of His Tablets, the Báb characterizes His Writings as eloquent
[examples given from Dalá’il-i Sab`ih]. Behmardi asks, “What is the
meaning of eloquence with regard to the Writings of the Báb?” In order to
answer the question, he will look at the standards of those learned in
rhetoric, then compare them to the Writings of the Báb.
In the eighth century AH, the orator Qazvíní [666-739/1268-1338]
summarized what had been said about eloquence up until that point in his
book al-Iḍáh. fí `ulúm al-balágha. According to him, eloquence of word
(kalima) lies in the absence of incongruous letters, peculiar words, and
abnormal derivation (of words) (qiyás). Eloquence of composition (kalám)
is devoid of weak writing, incongruous words, complex expression and
meaning, repetition, and consecutive genitive (iḍáfa) constructions.
The Báb‟s writings do not measure up to any of the standards listed by
Qazvini. For example, there are many expressions in the Writings of the Báb
that are known only as Bábi technical terminology, like “ẓilál al-mukfahirrát
al-afrídús” (“the shade of the dark clouds of Paradise”) in the Ziyarát-i `Abd
al-`Aẓím, or “`abd ath-thá‟” in the epistles of the Letters of the Living, and
so forth.
With regard to abnormal derivation of words, the Báb does this a great deal,
particularly in the formation of adjectives, like qaydúr and qadúr from the
adjective qadír and mu`aylim and `alúm from the adjective `alím, or `azúz
from `azíz, and `aẓúm from `aẓím, and qaydús from quddús, and muqtadim
and qadúm from qadím, and so forth3
In verb conjugation, the Báb‟s style is also unusual. For example, he derives
the verb dhawwata from the noun dhát (“essence”), as in the verse:

‫ّد‬ٚ‫ب ِٓ ُر‬ٙ‫د ث‬ّٚ ‫ ُر‬ٟ‫أب إٌّمطخ اٌّز‬
> “I am the Point which He who hath been made an essence [man
> dhuwwita] hath been made an essence by it (the Point) [dhuwwita
> bihá].”4

In the preamble of the Persian Bayan, the Báb derives the verb shayya’a
from the noun shay’, as in the following:
assertion that no one claimed to have a bayán of the Qur‟an until the time of the Báb. Innumerable authors have
described their commentaries on the Qur‟an as bayán (or tibyán). Further, Shi`is probably believed that their
Imams were the sources of the bayán promised in the Qur‟an. Indeed, in one of the earliest Shi`i commentaries on
the Qur‟an, `Ali b. Ibrahim al-Qummi clearly states that the phrases “incumbent upon us” (`alayná) refers to the
“family of the Prophet” (Tafsír al-Qummí, vol. 2, ,p. 397).

These examples are taken from a letter revealed for Him Whom God Shall Make Manifest. See
Muntakhabat Ayat az Athar Hadrat-i-Nuqtih-i-'Ula, Tehran, 134 BE, 1-2.

> “Everything [kull shay‟] that He hath ordained and will ordain hath

His quality of being a thing].”
As for repetition, which is frowned upon by the learned, the Báb‟s writings
are replete with it, especially in the mode of prayers )du`wát( and
supplications (munaját). In most instances, repetition is connected with
peculiar words and abnormal derivations.
So, if we accept the standard of eloquence of the literati of the past, then the
Báb‟s writings clearly do not match this standard. Why then, does He
maintain that His Writings are eloquent? The answer lies in the uniqueness
of His Writings. Since they are unique, they do not measure up to the
standards of the past. Rather, His writings will become the measure of
eloquence in the future. The Qur‟an itself was unique and did not conform
to the standards of the past. The literati took it as a standard, and its style
became the standard, which all strived for but fell short because of its
inimitability. Further, at the time of its revelation, the Arabs rejected its style
because it was not familiar to them and accused Muhammad of working
magic.
Part 3 - Modes of Revelation and a Discussion of the Mode of Verses
The Báb says that His revelation is written in several modes (sha‟n or nahj).
Behmardi says that each of these modes has special qualities, which are
sometimes mixed. In the first báb of the sixth wáhid and the second báb of
the ninth wáhid, He stated that the Persian Bayán is revealed in five modes:
verses (áyát), supplications (munaját), interpretations (tafásír), scientific
treatises (ṣuwar `ilmiyya), and writings in Persian (kalimát-i fársiyyih). In
the Saḥífih-yi `Adliyyih5 and the Dalá‟il-i Sab`ih6, the Báb also says that
orisons (khuṭbát) are one of the modes of revelation.7 Further, in the Seven
Proofs, the Báb also mentions tablets of visitation (ziyárát), prayers
(du`wát), writings in Arabic (kalimát-i arabiyya) and also cryptic esoterica
(ghawámiḍ-i asrár).

Tehran: n.d.: 9-10

p.27

People generally translate “khuṭba” as “sermon,” but this doesn‟t make much sense in the Writings of
the Báb, since the khuṭba usually comes in the form of a preamble to a Tablet and begins with some variation of
“Praise be to God” (taḥmíd), like in the first sura of the Qur‟an (Behmardi will discuss this later on). One might be
tempted, therefore, to translate the term as “preamble” or “opening address.” However, the Báb also describes
whole Tablets as a khuṭba. I have tentatively settled on the term “orison,” since it combines both notion of address
as well as prayer.
Verses (áyát) have a preeminent position among the different modes. Rather,
all the modes are under its shadow, as the Báb says in the first báb of the
sixth wáhid of the Persian Bayán:

ٚ ‫عذ حجّذ ػظّی‬ٚ‫شا وٗ ا‬٠‫حذٖ ِی گشدد ص‬ٚ ‫بد‬٠‫ّٗ اغالق ثش آ‬١ٌّٚ‫مذ ا‬١‫بْ ثٗ حم‬١‫ اعُ ث‬ٚ

‫ّٗ ِی گشدد‬١‫ دس خبِظ ثٗ وٍّبد فبسع‬ٚ ّٗ١ٍّ‫ دس ساثغ ثٗ وٍّبد ػ‬ٚ ‫ش‬١‫دس صبٌش ثٗ رفبع‬

.‫بد روش ِی گشدد‬٠‫ٌی و ًّ دس ظً آ‬ٚ

> Primarly, the name “bayán” is only applied to verses [áyát] because
> they a mighty proof and great testimony that indicate nothing but
> God alone. Secondarily, it is applied to supplications, thirdly to
> interpretations, fourthly to scientific treatises [kalimát-i `ilmiyya],
> and fifthly to writings in Persian. However, all of these are under the
> shadow of verses.

However, the Báb is not saying that His writings are only in one mode [i.e.
verses], since there are five modes used in the Panj Sha’n, four in the Kitáb
al-Asmá, and three in the Ṣaḥífih-yi bayn al-Haramayn.
Behmardi now proceeds to talk about the special qualities of the different
modes of revelation, beginning with verses (áyát). The term “verses” is
generally applied to all divine words, whether Arabic or Persian. This is
because the original meaning of the word is “signs.” Therefore, the words
from the Messengers are “signs” from God and guide humanity to the
Manifestation of His Cause.
Verses are also words which have a special style and, in the Writings of the
Báb and Baha‟u‟llah, are all in Arabic. One of the special characteristics of
verses are that they are the words of God Himself flowing through the
tongue of His Manifestation to His servants. Sometimes the speaker, who is
God, addresses the servants as the sole speaker (first person singular – “I”),
sometimes as if he is absent (third person singular – “He”), and sometimes
as if there are several speakers (first person plural – “We”). This is probably
the meaning of the Bab's statement that verses "indicate nothing but God
alone."
Moreover, verses have end rhymes (fawáṣil). The end rhyme of one verse is
connected with the end rhyme of another. In the Writings of Baha‟u‟llah and
the Báb, this is usually of three types:
1. The letters preceding the final letter (ḥarf rawíy) are related to each

other. These letters are usually a wáw, an alif or a yá‟. For example,

> mubín, `alím and munír all have the letter yá‟ in them [ie. the long
> “í”].
2. The final letters are the same. In literature, this is known as saj`

> [rhymed prose]. For example, `ibád, bilád, and shidád, or muqtadir
> and muntasi.r. [also the same verb patterns are used]
3. A rhyme ending in the accusative alif. For example, all of the verses

> of the Qayyúm al-Asmá end in this rhyme, like wahhájá, mustaqímá,
> ḥakímá and masṭúrá.

Sometimes, the books or epistles have a mixture of different types of
rhymes, as in the Kitáb-i Aqdas and some of the Writings of the Báb. Some
of the suras of the Qur‟an also have several types of rhyme.
Part 4 - The Mode of Supplications
Supplications (munaját) are speech from the Manifestation to the One Who
Makes Manifest [i.e. God]. They are in the mode of address (khiṭáb) and
have sections composed of glorification and exaltation (tasbíḥ wa tahlíl),
testimony (tashahhud), and praise (taḥmíd), like those that begin with
“subḥánaká” (“praise be to Thee”) [example of glorification and exaltation],
“lá iláha illá anta” (“there is no God but Thee”) [example of testimony],
“ashhadu annaka allahu” (“I bear witness that Thou art God”) [example of
testimony], and “naḥmaduka allahumma” (“We offer praise to Thee, O
Lord”) [example of praise]. With few exceptions, the supplications of the
Báb are all in Arabic.
One of the few exceptions is recorded in the Saḥífih-yi `Adliyyih (p. 3):
‫اح‬ٌٛ‫د ثش ا‬ٛ‫ذ لذسد خ‬٠ ٗ‫ حبي آٔىٗ ث‬ٚ ‫ سا‬ٛ‫ت ر‬١‫ُ ِظب٘ش لذسد حج‬٠ٛ‫ٔٗ صٕب گ‬ٛ‫ٔذا چگ‬ٚ‫خذا‬

ُٙ١ٍ‫دَ ػ‬ْٞ‫ُ وّب أذَ اس‬ٙ١ٍ‫دٖ ای ال احصی سْاء ػ‬ِٛ‫س فش‬ٛ‫داد ِغط‬ٛ‫ج‬ِٛ ٖ‫افئذ‬
> “O Lord! How can we praise the manifestations of the power of Thy
> Beloved when, with Thy Hand of divine power, Thou didst inscribe
> upon the tablets of the hearts of all existent things: “I do not consider
> (my) praise of them to be as Thou dost praise them.”
One of the distinctive features of the Writings of the Báb is that in addition
to the praise and glorification of God, He also mentions His personal
condition and historical issues. For example, in one prayer He alludes to His
imprisonment: “Praise be to Thee, O my God! Thou seest my state in the
heart of this Mountain.”
The Báb decreed that supplications were among the proofs of the theophany.
Behmardi cites passage from the Dalái’l Sab`ih8 and the Sharh.-i Súrat al-

Bab, Dalá’il-i Sab`ih, 26-27

Kawthar. The latter example is a reference to a statement by Majlisí in the
Haqq al-Yaqín, where he asserts that the Ṣaḥífih-yi Sajádiyyih, which
contains the prayers the supplications of Imam Zayn al-`Abidín `Alí b. al-
Husayn, is a proof of the Imam‟s divine authority (wiláyat). The Báb alludes
to this in the following passage:

‫ب‬ٙ‫غشث‬ٚ ‫دح اٌزی ِألد ؽشق االسض‬ٚ‫ال رضجذ ثصحبئف ِؼذ‬ٚ ‫فخ‬١‫ٗ ثصح‬٠‫ال‬ٌٛ‫ف رضجذ ا‬١‫و‬

ّ ‫ ا‬ٚ ‫ی حجّخ اوجش ِٓ ٘زٖ إٌّؼّخ‬
.‫ّخ اػظُ ِٓ ٘زٖ اٌمذسح‬١‫ی ػط‬                              ّ ‫فب‬

> “How can the divine authority (of the Imam) be established by a
> single volume [ṣaḥífa] and that which hath filled the East and the
> West not be established by unnumbered volumes? Which proof is
> greater than this divine blessing and which gift is mightier than this
> (evidence of) divine power?”
Prayers (du`wát), tablets of visitation (ziyárát), and orisons (khuṭab) are
slightly different from supplications. However, since all of them set forth the
powerlessness and need of the supplicant, they can be included in the mode
of supplication. One of the differences between supplications and prayers is
that supplications are generally in praise and glorification of the Creator,
while setting forth the servitude, powerlessness and error of the believer in
contrast to the object of worship. However, a prayer is for one object or
occasion, or specific time, but it is revealed in the form of a supplication.
Shi`i prayers from the Imams that found in collections of prayers and tablets
of visitation have the characteristic of being written for some specific
object, time or occasion. For example, there is the prayer for granting a
request (tawassul), or for the removal of difficulties (faraj) and a prayer on
the day of `arafah [the day before the Feast of Sacrifices], and a morning
prayer and prayers for the days of the week, etc.
The Báb has multiplied these types of prayers, like prayers for each one of
the days of the week, and prayers of protection, and for granting a request,
etc. Therefore, we can say that prayer is for something specific and
supplications are general, because supplications only include glorification of
God, but do not have a specific occasion on which they are to be said. This
rule also applies to the supplications and prayers of Baha‟u‟llah. For
instance, there are prayers for fasting and healing, etc.
Tablets of visitation are also prevalent in the Shi`i world. There are tablets
of visitation for the Fourteen Infallible Ones [Muhammad, Fatima, and the
12 Imams] and saints and notables. Most of them are attributed to the
Imams, although it is possible that some of them were composed by the
`ulama in the time of the Safavids. Those that we can attribute to the Imams

with certainty are found in the Ziyárát-i Jámi`a that Shaykh Ahmad
commented upon. In these tablets of visitation, the object of the tablets is
described with attributes and statements that are similar to statements in the
Qur‟an, the Hadith, and the traditions of the Imams. In other words, no other
Islamic technical terminology is added. However, this is not the case in the
Báb‟s tablets of visitation, where one can find the technical terminology of
the Illuminationists and divine philosophy [ḥikma muta`álliyya, ie. Mulla
Sadra‟s school], as in Tablet of Visitation for `Abd al-`Aẓím:

In addition to the Illuminationist terminology, the arrangement of this tablet
of visitation reflects the Illuminationist philosophy called `ilm al-mizán
(The Science of Balance). They are statements that compare the physical
world (mulk) to the spiritual world (malakút) and show the parallel between
the two. For example, the Ka`ba is an earthly symbol for heavenly realities
and a divine throne which is composed of four pillars and a circle of being is
placed in the middle. There are Writings of the Báb in His handwriting that
are in the shape of a square in the middle of which are several circles, and in

> Behmardi‟s note: In the second section, there are four pillars:
> First Pillar    kaynúniyya                     mashiyya                   jawhar
> Second Pillar dhátiyya                         iráda                      tajarrud
> Third Pillar    nafsániyya                     qadar                      sa`a
> Fourth Pillar   anniyya                        qaḍá‟                      ẓuhúr

some the shapes the names of the four angels (Gabriel, Isráfíl, Michael, and
`Izrá‟íl) are written in the four corners of a square. These tetrads (tarbí`) are
clearly evident in the Tablet of visitation for `Abd al-`Aẓím and in other
Writings of the Báb and Baha‟u‟llah.
As in the other writings of the Báb, sometimes the vocabulary of the Tablets
of Visitation is exclusive to the Báb. Another quality of the Tablets of
Visitation is that those that are for the great Bábis, like Quddús and Mullá
Husayn, are full of very lofty praise and characterization of them. In other
places, this praise and characterization would be used by the Báb with
reference to Himself. For example, Quddús is described with attributes of
God found in the Qur‟an and Mullá Husayn is characterized as the creator
of the worlds of the seen and the unseen.10
Orisons are phrases from verses which introduce epistles and speak of God
in the third person [ie. God is not addressed directly]. This is the only
difference between supplications and orisons. An orison begins with praise
(taḥmíd) of God in the form of “al-Hamdu li-llah.” Behmardi gives several
examples from the Writings of the Báb and points out that there are also
orisons in the Writings of Baha‟u‟llah. In Ishráqát, for example, there are
two at the beginning, which Baha‟u‟llah says He has revealed twice, like the
orison of the Qur‟an was revealed twice (once in Mecca and once in
Medina).11
Part 5 – The Modes of Commentaries and Scientific Treatises
Commentaries (tafásir) – Regarding His commentaries, the Báb stated in the
Dalái’l-i Sab`ih that some of His tafsirs on the Qur‟an are in the style of
verses (áyát) and some are in the “technical style of the perfect `ulama
[kalimát-i muṣtalihih bayn `ulamá-yi kammalín]”12. An example of the
former would be the Báb‟s commentary on the Qayyúm al-Asmá. A good
example of the latter is the Báb‟s commentary on the Surat al-Baqara,
which was revealed before the Báb received His call. It is full of technical
terminology and Shaykhí expressions and replete with citations of hadith
and traditions from the Imams. In some of the Báb‟s commentaries, both
styles are used, as in the commentary on Surat al-Kawthar, where both
styles are used in different sections.

Fáḍil Mázandarání, Ẓuhúr al-Haqq, v. 3: 425, 141.

Behmardi's comments on the Bab‟s style in the Tablets of Visitation closely mirror my own
conclusions on Baha‟u‟llah‟s style in the same genre, see „The Wronged One: Shí'í Narrative Structure in
Bahá'u'lláh's Tablet of Visitation for Mullá Husayn‟, Lights of Irfán, (Wilmette: Irfan Colloquia, 2002, 3,),
particularly with regard to the use of quaternaries and hyperbole. I also noted that Baha‟u‟llah‟s style in this genre
closely mirrors that of Shi`i Tablets of Visitation in structure and topoi, something Behmardi does not mention
Those familiar with the technical vocabulary of the Illuminationist and Mulla Sadra schools of philosophy will
instantly recognize that I have glossed over this terminology in the translation of the passage of the Ziyaratnama of
`Abd al-`Az.ím. Much could be written to explain the relationship between the different levels of this tetrad
composed of triads.

Dalá’il-i Sab`ih, 27

Here two issues arise. First, the commentaries that are in the style of verses
do not conform to the rules of the people. However, the commentaries in the
style of the perfect `ulama do conform to the rules, as is clear in the Báb‟s
commentary on Surat wa‟l-`Aṣr. Second, all commentaries in both styles
begin with an orison.
Scientific modes (shu’ún `ilmiyya). This type of revelation is also called
ṣuwar `ilmiyya and kalimát ilmiyya. The meaning of these phrases is that the
work does not have the characteristics of verses and supplications and deals
with a scientific, philosophical or jurisprudential issue, or kindred subjects.
This type of revelation sometimes seeks to clarify an issue and sometimes
seeks to reject or accept various opinions or beliefs. These scientific modes
are sent down in the form of isolated treatises, like the “Risála fí Bayán
Masá’il ath-Thalátha” (“A Treatise Explicating Three Questions”) or
“Ṣaḥífa Dhahabiyya” or in the midst of commentaries in the style of the
perfect `ulama. The style and content of this type of revelation is direct,
scientific, and in no need of interpretation. For example, in his commentary
on the Surat al-Qadr, the Báb succinctly clarifies the meaning of three
scientific terms: “as-sarmad is that which has no beginning and no end, and
ad-dahr has a beginning but no end, and az-zaman is that which is
ascertained from the motion of the celestial bodies by means of the rising of
the sun and the moon and the appearance of day and night.” Behmardi also
cites the Báb‟s response to the proponents of wahdat al-wujúd in His Ṣaḥífa
Dhahabiyya as an example of this mode [the passage concerns God‟s unity
and His disassociation from all things]:

Part 6 – The Mode of the Bab’s Writings in Persian
Persian writings (kalimát fársiyya) – The style of the Báb‟s writings in
Persian is completely without precedent, whether from the standpoint of
vocabulary or phrasing. In the Persian Bayán, the nouns and adjectives are
Arabic and the verbs, pronouns and particles are Persian. In Persian, the
foundation of expression is the verb and a sentence without a verb is
incomplete. Nouns and adjectives are in the position of details of the verb in
the sentence. Therefore, the Persian Bayán is a book in the Persian language
because its sentences are constructed on the basis of Persian verbs.
However, the rest of the characteristics of these Persian sentences are
Arabic, whether from the standpoint of words and vocabulary or from the
stand point of phrasing or arrangement of the vocabulary. Furthermore, the
arrangement of the words is according to Arabic sentence structure, not
Persian. To demonstrate this, Behmardi proposes an experiment. First, he
will take a verse from the first part of the Persian Bayán and separates it into
its component parts:

> / ‫ اص‬/ ‫ و ًّ ؽئ‬/‫ ثٗ ػجض‬/ ‫ اال‬/ ٝ‫ئ‬٠ ‫ ػ‬/ ‫چ‬١٘ / ‫ دس‬/ ‫دسا‬ٛ‫ خ‬/ ْ‫ ػشفب‬/ ‫خ‬٠‫ آ‬/ ٖ‫د‬ِٛ‫خٍك ٔفش‬

/ ‫ّذ‬١ٕٔٛ١‫ ثٗ و‬/ ًّ ‫ و‬/ ٗ‫ و‬/ ‫ ثٗ ػأٔی‬/ ‫ وً ؽئ سا‬/ ٖ‫د‬ِٛ‫ خٍك فش‬ٚ / ٜ‫ئ‬ٞ‫ ثٗ ػ‬/ ْ‫الزشا‬

/ ‫ی‬ٛ‫ وف‬/ ٗٔ ٚ / ‫ ػذٌی‬/ ٚ‫ اص ثشای ا‬/ ‫غذ‬١ٔ / ٗ‫ٕى‬٠‫ا‬

I have used Moojan Momen‟s translation of this excerpt from the introduction to his translation of
Baha‟u‟llah‟s Tablet on the Uncompounded Reality Accessed April 8 2007.. However, Behmardi‟s manuscript
seems to be more accurate and I have adjusted Momen‟s translation accordingly: “Illuminationists” for “Islamic,”
and “non-existent” for “the one who has gone astray” [I think this better describes the relationship between the
absolute and the contingent implied in the word mafqúd]. Further, Momen incorrectly translates one portion as,
“without the existence of anything having form and shape” (shay'un bi-mithl ma inna-hu kana shayyár), although
he notes that this is a tenuous translation. Behmardi‟s version of the text makes the connection between this
sentence and the following sentence clearer: bi-lá wujúdi shay'in bi-mithli má anna-hu kana h.ayyan (“without the
existence of anything in the same manner that He is Living.”)

> khalq nafarmúdih / áyat-i / `irfán-i / khud-rá / dar / hích / shay‟í / illá
> / bih `ajz-i / kull-i shay‟ / az / `irfán-i uu / va tajallí nafarmúdih / bih
> shay‟í / illá / bih nafs-i uu / idh / lam yazal / muta`álí búdih / az /
> iqtirán / bih shay‟í / va khalq farmúdih / kull shay‟-rá / bih sha‟ní /
> kih / kull / bih / kaynúniyyat / fit.rat / iqrár kunand / nazd-i uu / dar /
> yawm-i / qiyámat / bih iinkih / níst / az bará-yi uu / `adlí / va nah /

> “He hath not created a sign of the knowledge of Himself in anything
> except by the inability of all things to know Him and He hath not
> manifested (Himself) to anything except to Himself, since He hath
> always been exalted above association with things and He hath
> created all things in such a manner that all (of creation) in their
> essential nature acknowledge in His presence on the Day of
> Resurrection that He hath no peer or likeness.”
Then Behmardi changes each word into the Arabic equivalent but does not
change the syntax of the sentence.

The result is that the syntax of the “Persian” of the Báb is actually Arabic
syntax. [!] This is the reason Persians cannot understand the Báb‟s Persian
writings.

Muntakhibát-i áyát az áthár-i H.ad.rat-i Nuqtih-yi Ulá, 79.

Behmardi‟s note: “khalq nafarmúdih,” “tajallí nafarmúdih,” and “muta`álí búdih” are in lieu of a
single, complete Persian verb which are formed from Arabic words with a Persian verb suffix. This is one type of
focus on the Arabic language in the Bayán, where Persian verbs are generally one Arabic word with the suffix:
“farmúd – kard – namúd – gardíd – gasht – búd – mi-báshad – hast – shud.” [in other words, one looks to the
Persian suffix for tense and person, but looks at the Arabic word for meaning.]

If a person knowledgeable of Arabic, but unfamiliar with the Writings, reads
an Arabic translation of the Persian of the Báb (without altering the syntax),
he would deem it eloquent. However, a Persian unfamiliar with the Writings
would not be able to understand the Persian Writings of the Báb. Therefore,
we can conclude that the Persian writings of the Báb are outwardly Persian
but inwardly Arabic. This is not farfetched, as the Báb seems to allude to it
in the Ṣaḥífa `Adliyya (p. 4), where He says that “Arabic truths” (ḥaqíqat
`arabiyyat) have flowed from His “Persian verses” (áyát-i `ajamiyyih).
Behmardi also remarks that the Báb‟s penchant for Arabic nouns and
adjectives in His Persian writings is also evident in the Guardian‟s Lawh-i
Qarn.16
Part 7 – The Mode of Cryptic Esoterica
Cryptic esoterica (ghawámiḍ-i asrár) – Some of the writings of the Báb are
sent down on the basis of the science of letters and numbers and circles and
amulets (hayákil) and squares because He says in the Seven Proofs,
regarding the Kitáb al-Hayákil:

ّ ‫اص جٍّٗء‬
> ،ْ‫احذ وٗ ثٗ ح ّذ اػجبص اعذ اخزشاع آ‬ٚ ‫ء اعذ دس ٔفظ‬ٜ‫ادال ء ِزمٕٗ ػٍُ و ًّ ػ‬
.ٖ‫ٓ ِطٍغ ٔؾذ‬٠‫ احذی لجً اص ا‬ٚ ٖ‫ْ ؽذ‬ٚ‫ْ ِخض‬ٕٛ‫ٓ ػٍُ ِى‬٠‫بْ ا‬١‫احذ ث‬ٚ ً‫بو‬٠ ٖ ‫وٗ دس وزبة‬

“Among the conclusive proofs is the knowledge of all things in a
> single individual, the elaboration of which is on the level of
> miraculous inimitability (i`jáz). This hidden and concealed
> knowledge has been explained in the Kitáb-i Hayákil-i Wáḥid, nor
> was anyone aware of it before this.”17

Of course, just because some of the Writings of the Báb are in an obscure
style is no proof that this has general applicability [i.e. that everything is
cryptic esoterica]. It is only in subjects that don‟t concern the general public
and are revealed for the Báb‟s inner circle [kháṣṣán]. Those that are for the
general public have an accessible style that clarifies issues. Otherwise, they
could not be held accountable for rejecting the Báb‟s Message.
If this restriction of cryptic esoterica to things revealed to the inner circle is
correct, then we can say that this type of revelation was written in different
modes. For example, three different styles are used in one of the Báb‟s
Tablets for Baha‟u‟llah in the form of an amulet. First, there are verses

In translating the example Behmardi gives, I have tried to adhere to the syntax of the Persian passage
as much as possible in order to give a sense of what is going on in the original. Since it is actually Arabic syntax, it
is possible to transfer this word order into English, although it sounds terribly clunky. If the passage were of more
Persian syntax, this would be much more difficult since the verb would come at the end of the sentence.

Dalá’il-i Sab`ih, 45-6. Translation from Denis MacEoin, Rituals in Babism and Baha’ism (London:
British Academic Press, 1994, 17). MacEoin argues else where that the Kitáb-i Hayákil-i Wáḥid is actually the last
five sections of the Kitáb-i Panj Sha‟n. See MacEoin, The Sources for Early Bábí Doctrine and History: A Survey
(Leiden: Brill, 1992, 89-90).

(áyát) in which the speaker is God and there is an end rhyme in the form of
an accusative alif. The second portion is in the form of a prayer (ad`iya).
The third portion of the Tablet is in the form of an orison (khuṭab).
Therefore, writings that are considered to be cryptic esoterica, which are
different in tone from other writings, do not have a special style. In other
words, this type of writing has a specialized content, but not a specialized
form. This specialized content is found both in scientific modes (shu’ún
`ilmiyya) of writing and cryptic esoterica.
Part 8 – Alteration of Verses
The alteration of verses (taṣríf-i áyát) is found in the Qur‟an and the
Writings of the Báb and Baha‟u‟llah. Indeed, it can be said that the
alteration of verses is one of the characteristics of divine revelation. In
Arabic, the word taṣríf means changing something from one form (ṣura) or
mood (ḥála) or arrangement (tarkíb) to another form or mood or
arrangement without changing the essence. For example, the definition of
morphology (`ilm aṣ-ṣarf) is “a science which investigates the change of a
word into different forms in accordance with the intended meaning.” 18 For
example, a person who exchanges money is called a money changer
(ṣarráf). It is not only the exchange of one form of money [ie. dollars] for
another form [quarters], but it is also the exchange of one type of money for
another [pounds for dollars]. Therefore, the meaning of altering the verses
of God is changing words from one style or arrangement to another style or
arrangement, like changing from supplications to verses, or vise versa,
without changing the content. For example, we see that in the writings of the
Báb He mentions a subject in which there are numerous instances of
alteration, while preserving the original statement, but with a change in the
arrangement of the sentences. One well-known example of this is the
alteration of the statements in the Dawn Prayer (du`á-yi saḥar).19 In the
Tablets of Visitation which the Báb revealed for the night of the halfway
point (laylat an-niṣf) of the month of fasting,20 He makes reference to the
Dawn Prayer in three places but with three different alterations. The first
alteration of the Dawn Prayer is when He says:

Rashíd ash-Shartúní [1864/5-1906/7] Mabádi' al-`Arabíyah fi al-sarf wa-al-nahw (Beirut: Dár al-
Mashriq, 1979, 8.

Behmardi‟s note:The Dawn Prayer is one of the well-known Shi`i prayers that begins with the
expression, “O God! I beseech Thee by all of Thy most-glorious lights [as‟aluka min kulli bahá‟ika bi-abháhi]...”
The names of the month for the Badí` calendar are taken from the text of this prayer. The text itself is located in
`Abbás Qummí [d. 1941], Mafátíh. al-jinán (Tehran: Cháp-i `ilmí, 1316 AH, 183-85).

Behmardi‟s note: This Tablet of Visitation is to be recited on the tenth night of the fast. In this Tablet
of Visitation, He says that it was revealed for “the Primal Tree and its Branches and whomsoever seeks shade
beneath its canopy. Moreover, it is a remembrance for Him Whom God Shall Make Manifest.” This Tablet of
Visitation is still unpublished.

A second alteration is when He says:

And in a third alteration:

> majesty of God and the most exquisite beauty of god and the most
> radiant light God.”
The alteration of the Dawn Prayer is also found in other Tablets of the Báb,
such as the following:

ًّ ‫ق و‬ٛ‫جّبٌٗ ف‬                                               ّ ٖ‫ش‬ٙ‫ظ‬٠ ِٓ ‫اْ ثٗ اء‬

ّ ٚ ‫جّبي‬
‫ق و ًّ ػظّخ اٌخ‬ٛ‫اْ ػظّزٗ ف‬

> “Verily, the light [bahá‟a] of Him Whom God Shall Make Manifest is
> above every (other) light. Verily, His glory [jalálahu] is above every
> (other) glory. Verily, His beauty is above every (other) beauty. Verily,
> His majesty [`azamatahu] is above every other majesty21

There is another kind of alteration that occurs in the Writings of the Báb,
which is the translation of Arabic into Persian or Persian into Arabic. This is
also found in the Writings of Baha‟u‟llah, as in the two sections revealed in
the Ziyárátnámih-yi Ḥurúfát `áliyyát. One example of this type of alteration
are given from Báb‟s commentary on the Surat Kawthar:

‫ي صجی‬ٛ‫ُ ثُ سي ل‬ٙ‫ ثؼذ رين ٌ ّّب أذ رزوش وٍّبر‬ٚ ،‫ا‬ٚ‫زف ّىش‬١ٌ ‫سلخ‬ٚ ‫ا‬ٛ‫ٕؾئ‬٠ ٌٛ ‫اْ اٌؼٍُ اء‬

> “Verily, if the `ulamá‟ compose a page (of writing), they (must)
> ponder. After that, when you mention their words, its is like the
> speech of a child saying “pah pah” [bravo!] in Persian.”
The Báb then translates this passage in His Ṣaḥífih-yi `Adliyyih:

‫ آخش‬ٚ ‫ه خطجٗ أؼاء ِی وٕٕذ‬٠ ‫ رف ّىش٘ب ثٗ چٗ ِؾمّذ ٘ب‬ٚ ‫و ًّ ػٍّب ثؼذ اص ِالحظٗ ء وزت‬

> “All of the `ulamá‟, after perusing books and pondering them, with
> what difficulty they compose a single orison [khuṭbih]. Afterwards,
> in contradistinction to these grand orisons [those of the Báb], you
> proceed to say, like children: pah pah.”22

Behmardi then quotes a different Arabic passage from the Báb‟s
commentary on the Surat Kawthar and its Persian translation in His Ṣaḥífih-
yi `Adliyyih.
Another type of alteration in the Writings of the Báb is the different modes
of expression used to explain historical questions and the Báb‟s state
without changing the content. However, when a change in style occurs in a
single text without interruption and before the point of transition in the
subject matter, it is called iltifát (“sudden transition”) in literature. This is
occurs frequently in the Writings of Baha‟u‟llah and the Báb. For example,
there is a sudden transition from the mode of the orison (khuṭba) to the
mode of prayer (du`á) in the Ṣaḥífih-yi Makhzúnih:

Muntakhabát-i áyát az áthár-i h.ad.rat-i nuqtih-yi ulá: 110-111.

Ṣaḥífih-yi `Adliyyih: 11

> mashiyya] and from no other thing and fashion things by virtue of

In the commentary on Surat Kawthar, the Báb changes from the mode of
verses to the mode of prayer with no point of transition:

Part 9 – Concision, Disquisition, and Repetition
Both conciseness (ijáz) and elaborateness (tafṣíl) characterize the writings of
the Báb. In some places, the Báb explains a subject very succinctly. The
Ṣaḥífih-yi `Adliyya is a good example of this. However, the Persian Bayán is
among the most detailed of Báb‟s writings. Among the succinct statements
in the Ṣaḥífih-yi `Adliyya is the following:

With regard to alteration by translation, I have translated the two examples as literally as possible to
show how the Báb uses Persian to flesh out the meaning of the Arabic. This also occurs in the Writings of
Baha‟u‟llah, such as the Lawh-i Bahá‟, where Baha‟u‟llah first reveals the Tablet in Arabic and then fully
translates it in Persian. As to the abrupt change from one mode of writing to another without a point of transition
(some phrase signaling a shift in style or content), this can be bewildering even for those fluent in the languages
and can lead to an erroneous reading of the text.

> Also: “Everything that is called a „thing‟, other than the essence of

In some of the Báb‟s writings, like the Persian Bayán and the Kitáb al-
Asmá, divine wisdom dictates that subjects be explained with prolixity,
perhaps so that someone‟s doubts may be dispelled. In other words, the
essence of the thought is given in great deal and not just alluded to. For
example, the phrase given in the Ṣaḥífih-yi `Adliyya, “Everything that is
called a „thing‟,” is explained in detail in the Persian Bayán:

ّ ‫ إّٔی أب‬،‫ٓ اعذ‬٠‫ْ ا‬ٚ‫ ا‬ٚ ‫بْ وٍّٗ ای وٗ جبِغ و ًّ ػٍُ اعذ‬١‫دٖ دس ث‬ِٛ‫ٔذ ٔبصي فش‬ٚ‫خذا‬

> “God revealed words in the Bayán that are the condensation (jámi`)
> of all knowledge. The words are as follows: Verily, I am God, no
> God is there but me. Verily, that which is other than Me is My
> creation. O My creation! Fear God! Everything that is called a
> „thing‟, other than God, is His creation at the point of (ḥadd) of
> origination, and fashioning, and construction, and bringing into
> existence.” (Sixth báb, third wáhid )
As explained before, one of the reasons for the revelation of a bayán is to
clarify and explain in detail. In comparison with the Persian Bayán, the
Arabic Bayán is succinct.
Another interesting aspect in the writings of the Báb is the repetition of
words and phrases. In literature, repetition is usually employed for two
reasons. First, to place emphasis on the subject. Second, to remind the
reader or listener of something, because repetition of a subject or word or
phrase several times fixes it in the mind and prevents people from forgetting
it.

Ṣaḥífih-yi `Adliyyih, 1

Ibid, 15.

Since one of the most important things in the writings of the Báb is divine
Unity and Him Whom God Shall Make Manifest, there is a lot of repetition
when these subjects appear. For example, in order to emphasize absolute
divine unity, there is repetition of the names and attributes of God and praise
and glorification of His essence, as in the Surat al-Mulk in the Qayyúm al-
Asmá and in a letter to Mullá Báqir, a Letter of the Living26
In the Qayyúm al-Asmá, words like ḥaqq (Truth), akbar (most great), kitáb
(book), and nár (fire) are frequently repeated. Moreover, aqq is repeated in
most of the verses of the Qayyúm al-Asmá. For example, the word ḥaqq is
repeated in the first Sura (al-Mulk) 47 times, in the second Sura (al-
`Ulamá‟) 41 times, in the third Sura (al-Imán) 25 times, in the fourth Sura
(al-Madína) 33 times, and so forth until the last Sura (al-Mu‟minín) where it
is repeated 50 times, which is more than the number of its verses. Since it
has been elsewhere claimed [by Behmardi] that repetition indicates
something secret, what is the purpose of repeating ḥaqq so frequently?
Of course, the word does not have a single interpretation, but if one looks at
other writings, it can illuminate the meaning. In this respect, if we look at
Baha‟u‟llah‟s Tafsír Ḥurúf Muqatta`a and the Lawh al-Ḥaqq, it becomes
clear that the Báb is referring to Baha‟u‟llah when He uses the word “truth”
in the Qayyúm al-Asmá, as Baha‟u‟llah states in the Tafsír Ḥurúf Muqatta`a:

‫ ٘زا ِب‬ٚ ‫ی ػٕذ اؽشاق اٌ ّؾّظ ِشّح اخشی‬ٛ‫ٌی ػٓ ؽجشحاٌمص‬ٚ‫ش ٔذاء ا ال‬ٙ‫ظ‬٠ ‫ٕئز‬١‫ ح‬...

From this explanation we understand that the purpose of repeating the word
ḥaqq in the Qayyúm al-Asmá’ is to prepare the Bábis and the people of the
world to believe in the new manifestation of Truth and to stress the

[both examples are quoted].

importance of this subject. This is proof that it was mentioned directly and
repetitively, not with hints and allusions.

Part 10 – Ciphers & Tropes27
To say that the Báb speaks directly is not to say that His Writings are devoid
of allusions and ciphers (rumúz). Of course, discerning the meaning of the
allusions and ciphers used by the Báb is a task that future Baha‟is will
undertake. Some of these terms include “He Who has Seven Letters” (dhát
ḥurúf as-sab`a, meaning `Alí Muhammad), “the Letter Sín” (ḥarf as-sín,
meaning Mullá Husayn), and the “Kitáb-i Qáf and the Kitáb-i Alif”
(meaning the Qur‟an and the Gospel [injíl]), the Letter Mím and the Letter
Fá‟ (ḥarf-i mím and ḥarf-i fá‟, meaning Moses and Pharaoh [fir`awn]), and
so forth. Further, sometimes a string of sentences are dense with ciphers and
allusions. For example, in the Ṣaḥífa bayn al-Ḥaramayn, the Báb says, “The
triple-lettered word (kalimat at-tathlíth) only refers to His Imam (walíyihi,
i.e. `Alí), and the quadruple-lettered word (shakl at-tarbí`) only refers to His
Beloved (ḥabíbihi, i.e. Muhammad). Verily, the things united in all of grades
(of existence) are separated by the manifestation of the union of these two
words (i.e. `Alí Muhammad).”
The use of tropes (majáz) are another special characteristic of the writings
of the Báb. A trope is not a cipher, since a trope goes beyond the external
meaning of one word to indicate another meaning that the literal meaning of
the word does not possess. However, ciphers are expressions that do have
not the intended meaning in themselves. Forms, numbers, and letters can
also be ciphers, like the form of the haykal represents the human being, and
the number seven is a symbol for `Alí Muhammad or Husayn `Ali [because
of the number of Arabic letters in their name], and the numbers five and
nine indicate the Báb and Bahá‟, and the number fourteen indicates the
Fourteen Infallible Ones, which the ciphers “Face” (wajh) or “Hand” (yad)
represent. Therefore, a trope must be an expression whose outer form is
understandable, but the speakers intention is something different. However,
a cipher is a word or a letter or a number or a form that does not have the
intended meaning in itself and the outer meaning is well-known and clear.
The hidden, intended meaning can only be known by familiarity with the

I imagine some people will object to my translation of ramz as “cipher” rather than “symbol” and
majáz as “trope,” rather than “metaphor.” I think, however, that these translations are more in keeping with
Behmardi‟s definitions, since he seems to draw on medieval discussions of these terms rather than modern ones,
which would define a ramz in more Western terms. As for his definition of trope as something that “goes beyond
the external meaning of one word to indicate another meaning that the literal meaning of the word does not
possess,” I think it could be stated another way: the power of a trope is its multivalent connotations (its cultural
and psychological associations), not its denotations (dictionary definitions). To understand the full implication of a
trope, therefore, would require thorough knowledge of the writings of the author and the cultural associations of
the readership (something Todd has tried to show in his work on the commentaries of the Báb). A cipher, on the
other hand, can only be understood through initiation into the code language of the author(s) either through some
sort of key or deciphering the code.

technical terminology used in the text, like the example of the “Letter Sín”
seen above.
Among the tropes in the Writings of the Báb are words like “fire,” “light,”
and “book” in the Qayyúm al-Asmá and “the Sun of Truth” (shams-i
ḥaqíqat), and “the Tree of Truth” (shajarih-yi ḥaqíqat), and so on in the
Persian Bayán. For example, in the Qayyum al-Asmá, the word “fire” has
several meanings. In some places it alludes to the blaze of Mt. Túr [i.e. Mt.
Sinai], which is the Manifestation of the Cause of God in each theophany. In
other places it alludes to Hell [gives two examples from the Surat as-Sirr
and the Surat al-Mulk]. In both cases, the word “fire” has a well-known and
clear meaning and can be found in the dictionary. However, that which is
intended is something different from that which is in the dictionaries [this is
the difference between denotation and connotation].
Sometimes, the Báb clarifies a subject figuratively and allegorically. This
way of clarification uses parables, as found in the Persian Bayán, where the
Báb speaks figuratively and allegorically of the ignorance of the People of
the Bayán when Him Who God Shall make Manifest is among them:

‫د‬ٛ‫ذٖ ِی ؽ‬٠‫شا وٗ د‬٠‫اس اعذ وٗ خبٌی گزاسٔذ ص‬ٚ‫ه ٔفظ عضا‬٠ ًّ ‫ٓ ٘ش ِمؼذی ِح‬١ٕ‫ّ٘چ‬ٚ

> laughs at the believers who, on account of His name, observe this
> type of flattery and respect, but on the day of the His manifestation
> they are veiled from Him.”28

In summary, the words of the Báb are understandable to everyone, otherwise
they wouldn‟t be a proof of His prophethood and a means for obtaining
guidance. What stands in the way is the style, context, and technical
vocabulary which is unfamiliar to most people. There are two reasons for
this. Just as in past dispensations, the technical vocabulary of the Writings is
initially unfamiliar [like the Qur‟an for the Arabs]. The second reason (and
in the author‟s opinion, the most important), people become familiar with
the abstruse and difficult philosophical, mystical and religious writings,

which then become easy to understand. However, if that which they know is
a hindrance, then they should turn to the words of God with their inner
being so that no obstacles may remain in the way of understanding and
recognizing the divine Writings.
