      Constructive Resilience: The Bahá’ı́
> Response to Oppression
> by Michael Karlberg

Against the backdrop of dramatic struggles for social change in the
twentieth century, characterized by non-violent opposition and civil
disobedience, the Bahá’ı́ community of Iran has pursued a distinctively
non-adversarial approach to social change under conditions of violent
oppression. This non-adversarial model has received little attention in the
literature on social change. This article therefore seeks to bring the model
into focus by outlining the Bahá’ı́ community’s experience of oppression,
by examining the principles that inform their collective response to
oppression, by discussing the results of their response, and by deriving
from this a set of heuristic insights that can guide further inquiry into the
dynamics of peace and change.

By the end of the twentieth century, a large body of literature had
emerged exploring the theory and practice of non-violent resistance to
oppression. This literature was derived from the writings and actions
of influential figures such as Mahatma Gandhi and Martin Luther
King, the movements they led and inspired, and the deeper ethical and
spiritual traditions from which they drew their inspiration. Against the
backdrop of these dramatic twentieth-century struggles, the Bahá’ı́
community in Iran was pursuing a distinctively non-adversarial
response to violent oppression that has received comparatively little
attention—despite being ‘‘one of the few documented cases of a
minority that has managed to resist peacefully’’ a sustained and
systematic campaign of genocidal intent.1

For more than 160 years the Bahá’ı́ community in Iran has been a
target of recurrent waves of hostile propaganda and censorship, social
ostracism and exclusion, denial of education, denial of employment,
denial of due process before the law, property looting and destruction,
government seizure of individual and collective assets, arson,

incitements to mob violence, arbitrary arrests and imprisonments,
physical and psychological torture, death threats, executions, and
disappearances—all calculated to extinguish the community.2 Most
Iranians harbor no animosity toward the Bahá’ı́s, and the teachings of
Islam explicitly promote religious tolerance. However, powerful
segments of the Shı́’ah clerical establishment in Iran pursued a hostile
agenda by inciting their more extreme followers to act against the
Bahá’ı́s, by disseminating calumnies and misrepresentations from the
pulpit and through the media that have resulted in widespread indif-
ference to the plight of the Bahá’ı́s within Iranian society, and by
intimidating those who might otherwise be moved to speak out on
behalf of the Bahá’ı́s.3

Since 1979, a renewed wave of persecution and violence has
attracted the attention and condemnation of the United Nations Gen-
eral Assembly and other U.N. agencies, international human rights
organizations, diverse national governments, academics and journalists
from numerous countries, progressive voices within Iranian society,
Iranian expatriates living abroad, and Muslim human rights activists,
who have all noted the innocence and long-suffering of the Bahá’ı́s in
Iran and have urged the authorities there to end the current campaign
of systematic repression.4 As a result of this attention, outside observ-
ers are increasingly taking note of other aspects of this emerging glo-
bal religion that originated within the conflict and turmoil of the
contemporary Middle East. Its steady global expansion, its democra-
tizing tendencies, and its commitments to peace and justice have all
been closely examined and widely documented.5 To date, however,
the Bahá’ı́ community’s response to oppression has received little
attention. This article seeks to bring the Bahá’ı́ response to oppression
into clearer focus as a distinctively non-adversarial model of social
change in the face of violent persecution.

BACKGROUND: THE OPPRESSION OF BAHÁ’ÍS IN IRAN

The Bahá’ı́ Faith was founded in the mid-nineteenth century by a
young Persian, Mirza Husayn-‘Ali, who is known by the name
Bahá’u’lláh (1817–1892). As a young man, Bahá’u’lláh turned his
back on a life of wealth and privilege and refused a position in the
court of the Shah in order to tend to the poor and needy in his coun-
try. From the age of 36 until his death, Bahá’u’lláh was a prisoner
and an exile of the Persian and Ottoman authorities for his leadership

224                   PEACE & CHANGE / April 2010

of a ‘‘heretical’’ religious movement dedicated to the peaceful con-
struction of a new social order.6 The movement derives from the belief
that all of the world’s great religious systems spring from the same
unknowable Divine Source, advance the same processes of spiritual
evolution through successively unfolding stages, and differ only
because of the cultural and historical contexts in which they emerged.
Its social teachings include the full equality of men and women, the
elimination of extremes of wealth and poverty, the harmony of science
and religion, and the need for universal education. The religion’s most
pivotal teachings, however, revolve around the promotion of unity
and justice in the context of increasing global interdependence.7

The community that emerged in response to Bahá’u’lláh’s teach-
ings is now a microcosm of the planet’s diverse human population. It
has a current membership of more than five million people, drawn
from more than 2,100 different indigenous tribes, races, and ethnic
groups, representing all nations and socioeconomic classes on earth.8
The Bahá’ı́ Faith is now widely recognized as an independent world
religion,9 yet it has no ecclesiastical order or clergy of any kind.
Rather, the community is organized through a system of locally
elected governing assemblies in thousands of localities worldwide,
nationally elected governing assemblies in 179 independent nations
and territories, and a single internationally elected governing body that
coordinates and guides its activities on a global scale.10 It is, by these
measures, one of the most diverse, globally distributed, democratically
organized, and steadily growing communities of people—religious or
otherwise—on the planet today.

Bahá’ı́s are required, by their faith, to avoid active involvement in
partisan politics and to show loyalty and obedience to the laws of the
land in which they live.11 Bahá’ı́s are also exhorted to ‘‘consort with
the followers of all religions in a spirit of friendliness and fellow-
ship.’’12 Despite these commitments the Bahá’ı́ community has, since
its inception, been subjected to violent persecution by various religious
and civil authorities in Iran and their followers or supporters.13 The
herald of the Bahá’ı́ Faith, Siyyid ‘Alı́-Muhammad, known as the Báb
(1819–1850),14 was executed at the age of 30 by a government firing
squad of 750 riflemen.15 In the campaign of extermination that fol-
lowed, some twenty thousand early believers, including women and
children, were put to death, often in the most brutal and inhumane
ways, while many more were tortured, imprisoned, subjected to mob
violence, and had their property plundered or destroyed.16 European

eyewitnesses of this period left written accounts of the followers of the
Báb being branded with red-hot irons; being stoned to death; having
their skulls crushed; being blown in half by mortars; being hung
upside down from trees for target practice; having their teeth torn out,
their eyes gouged out, and being forced to eat amputated parts of their
own bodies; having lighted candles inserted into their flesh while being
led in chains, through the streets, behind military bands; and having
the soles of their feet skinned, soaked in boiling oil, shoed like a
horse, and then being forced to run before their execution was admin-
istered.17

Since the initial bloodbath that marked the birth of the commu-
nity in the mid-nineteenth century, the Bahá’ı́s in Iran have lived as an
oppressed and vulnerable minority, experiencing recurrent episodes of
violent persecution. These episodes have been driven by incitements
from the pulpit as well as media propaganda reflecting a calculated
effort to poison public sentiment toward the Bahá’ı́s and to intimidate
fair-minded and sympathetic Iranians who might be moved to come to
their defense.18 For the most part, Bahá’ı́s have been denied the basic
civil protections granted to other religious minorities in the coun-
try—despite the fact that the Bahá’ı́ Faith is the only one of Iran’s
non-Muslim minorities that bears witness to the station of
Mohammad, recognizes the authenticity of the Qur’án, and upholds
the divine origins of Islam.19

The social marginalization and legal exclusion of the Bahá’ı́s in
Iran stands in stark contrast to the religious tolerance that character-
ized Islamic civilization at its peak20—and that moderate Muslims
around the world and inside Iran still advocate. The security of
the Bahá’ı́ community, however, has been continually undermined by
ongoing power struggles that have played out within and between
the civil and religious authorities in Iran throughout most of the
nineteenth and twentieth centuries.21 In the context of these power
struggles, the Bahá’ı́s have served as familiar targets and scape-
goats—much like the role played by Jewish communities throughout
parts of Europe in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, culmi-
nating in the Holocaust.22 Moreover, in general, when the power of
the Shı́’ah clerics has been in ascendance in Iran, relative to the power
of secular authorities, the persecution of the Bahá’ı́s has been most
pronounced.23

Against this backdrop, a number of radical Islamic groups
emerged in the twentieth century with the goal of extinguishing the

226                    PEACE & CHANGE / April 2010

Bahá’ı́ Faith in Iran, despite the many Qur’ánic teachings that extol
tolerance, and despite Mohammad’s clear statements in the Qur’án
that ‘‘God loves not the aggressors’’ (2:190) and that there should be
‘‘no compulsion in religion’’ (2:257). These groups include the
Jam‘ı́yat-i Madhhab-i Ja‘farı́ (Society of the Sect of the Twelve
Imams), the Jámı́‘a-yi Ta‘lı́mat-i Islámı́ (Society for Islamic Education),
and the Anjumani-i-Tablı́ghát-i-Islámı́ (Society for the Promotion of
Islam), which later became known by the more honest name
Anjumani-i didd-i Bahá’ı́ (the Anti-Bahá’ı́ Society) as well as the name
Hujjatı́yyih (a reference to Hujjat, the expected Shi-ah messiah). In
their harassment and intimidation of Bahá’ı́s, this latter group, whose
principal aim was to combat the Bahá’ı́ Faith, operated an extensive
and well-organized network of over 12,000 members across Iran that
enjoyed the patronage and financial support of the religious authorities
while maintaining a collaborative relationship with the Shah’s secret
police, the SAVAK.24

After 1979, following the Islamic revolution led by Ayatollah
Ruhollah Khomeini, a renewed wave of persecution engulfed the
Bahá’ı́ community. Before Ayatollah Khomeini came to power he was
already a self-declared adversary of the Bahá’ı́ Faith and he made it
clear that the Bahá’ı́ community, which constituted the largest religious
minority in Iran with more than 300,000 members, would be denied
the basic human rights that would be afforded to other religious minor-
ities in the country.25 In addition, leaders of the Anti-Bahá’ı́ Society
assumed many of the most influential positions within the newly declared
republic.26 Therefore, immediately following the revolution, it became
clear that the Bahá’ı́s were in great danger as, indeed, the Islamic
regime began to pursue a program of ‘‘implacable hostility toward the
Bahá’ı́s.’’ 27 Segments of the population were immediately incited to
violence against the Bahá’ı́s, who could be attacked with impunity
because the new Islamic constitution (echoing the 1906 constitution
before it) intentionally denied the Bahá’ı́s any legal recognition or civil
protections and ‘‘effectively criminalized the faith.’’ 28 Courts of the
new Islamic regime in turn denied Bahá’ı́s the right to seek justice,
redress, or protection against killings, assaults, or property theft by rul-
ing that Iranians who commit such acts against Bahá’ı́s are not liable
for their actions because Bahá’ı́s are classified as ‘‘unprotected infidels,’’
‘‘heretics,’’ and ‘‘those whose blood may be shed with impunity.’’ 29

In addition to encouraging, and then turning a blind eye to,
heinous acts committed by some Iranian citizens against Bahá’ı́s,

Constructive Resilience                         227

the Iranian authorities pursued their own systematic and well-docu-
mented campaign designed to deal with ‘‘the Bahá’ı́ question’’ by
ensuring ‘‘that their progress and development are blocked’’ by the
state.30 Toward this end, after 1979 Iran saw ‘‘the full range of state
coercive force deployed against the Bahá’ı́s.’’ 31 Within this ongoing
campaign, over two hundred Bahá’ı́s—including a significant portion
of the democratically elected leaders of the Bahá’ı́ community—have
been executed; roughly a thousand more have been imprisoned, and
many thousands more have lost their jobs, been denied their pensions,
been forced to repay past pensions and salaries, been expelled from
schools and universities, been denied health care, had their personal
property plundered, and had their grave sites defiled.32 So depraved
has been the treatment of many Bahá’ı́s that in some cases the family
members of executed victims have been forced to repay the govern-
ment the cost of the bullets used in the executions, while women as
young as 17 years old have been hanged for the crime of educating
Bahá’ı́ children in their homes.33 In addition, Bahá’ı́ holy places and
historical sites have been razed throughout the country. Most recently,
the Supreme Leader of the Islamic regime, Ayatollah Khamenei, also
‘‘instructed military and law enforcement agencies to identify and
monitor all Bahá’ı́s living within their areas of responsibility,’’ and
there is evidence that this instruction is being carried out.34 This act
has been a familiar precursor to genocidal campaigns carried out by
authoritarian regimes in other countries.

The Bahá’ı́s in Iran are therefore ‘‘a people within a state, yet
legally without a state (in terms of state protection), while being the
target of that state.’’ 35 Indeed, for the first two decades following the
Islamic revolution, the government even denied Bahá’ı́s the right to
leave Iran—a policy that was reminiscent of the nineteenth-century
pogroms against Bahá’ı́s when the gates to an Iranian city would be
guarded so that Bahá’ı́s could not escape as they were hunted down
from house to house.36

The authorities defend their actions against the Bahá’ı́s through
baseless and often self-contradictory claims that the Bahá’ı́ Faith is a
seditious political movement rather than a religion; that Bahá’ı́s are
agents of Zionism and spies for Israel; that Bahá’ı́s are agents and
spies for American, British, or Russian imperialism; that the Bahá’ı́s
are anti-Islamic and satanic; that Bahá’ı́s are enemies of the state;
that Bahá’ı́s are spreading injustice and oppression throughout the
world and are allied with communism; that Bahá’ı́s are spreading

228                   PEACE & CHANGE / April 2010

sexual immorality, prostitution, and other vices; and that Bahá’ı́s
were former collaborators with SAVAK, the Shah’s secret police. Such
claims have all been proven to be entirely without merit and have
been rejected by the United Nations, by human rights agencies, and
by objective scholars.37 For instance, the allegation of immorality and
prostitution derives from the fact that the Shı́’ah authorities deny the
validity of Bahá’ı́ marriage, thus rendering all Bahá’ı́ marriages a
form of immorality and prostitution. Likewise, the charge that
Bahá’ı́s are agents of Zionism and spies for Israel derives from the
fact that the spiritual and administrative center of the worldwide
Bahá’ı́ community is located in Akka and Haifa, Israel. Yet the sole
reason for this is that Bahá’u’lláh was exiled and imprisoned there by
the Iranian and Ottoman authorities from 1868 until his death in
1892\.

The fraudulent nature of the Iranian accusations against the
Bahá’ı́s is further revealed by the fact that the Iranian authorities con-
sistently offer their Bahá’ı́ victims freedom from imprisonment and
torture, or reprieve from execution, on the sole condition that they
recant their religious beliefs—a demand that is a violation of the basic
human right to freedom of belief that has been articulated by the
United Nations and various human rights organizations. This demand
provides clear evidence that ‘‘religious persecution was the primary
motive’’ for actions by the regime against the Bahá’ı́s.38 Indeed, the
Iran Human Rights Documentation Center has described these
attempts at forced conversion as ‘‘reminiscent of the methods of the
Spanish Inquisition.’’39

The reasons that some Shı́’ah clerics—or ‘ulamá—are bent on
extinguishing the Bahá’ı́ Faith appear to be both theological and
material. In general terms, many ‘ulamá are theologically unwilling to
accept the possibility of a post-Islamic religion, since that would defy
the interpretive logic by which they understand Islam (and their privi-
leged position within it).40 More specifically, many ‘ulamá appear
unwilling to tolerate the challenging claim, advanced by the Báb and
elaborated by Bahá’u’lláh, that the promise and aspirations of the
major religious systems of the past will gradually be fulfilled in com-
ing centuries as humanity enters into an era of justice and enlighten-
ment in which the ‘ulamá will eventually have no place.41 The Bahá’ı́
Faith is thus perceived as a conceptual menace that threatens to
undermine the theological, social, and economic position of the
‘ulamá, including their extensive system of religious endowments,

Constructive Resilience                        229

fees, and benefits, which can be preserved only as long as they retain
their privileged status within the Iranian psyche.42 This alignment of
theological interpretations and material interests has provided a pow-
erful incentive for the persecution of Bahá’ı́s for one hundred and
sixty years.

As the history of many countries has demonstrated, small but
powerful segments of society, like the more intolerant and ambitious
Shı́’ah clerics within Iran, are often capable of orchestrating large-
scale campaigns of persecution and violence against vulnerable minor-
ities by manipulating public perceptions and sentiments, by inciting
mob actions, by cultivating a climate of indifference within the wider
population, and by intimidating or silencing sympathetic segments of
society who might otherwise speak out in defense of the persecuted
minority. Such has been the case in Iran. Significantly, in recent
years, sympathetic segments of Iranian society have begun to speak
out again in defense of the Bahá’ı́s, often at considerable personal
risk.43

THE BAHÁ’Í RESPONSE TO OPPRESSION

The Bahá’ı́ community’s response to the oppression outlined above
derives directly from the teachings of Bahá’u’lláh and his appointed
successors. Before his death in 1892, Bahá’u’lláh left written instruc-
tions appointing his eldest son, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá (1844–1921), to succeed
him as the Center of his Covenant and the ultimate source of guid-
ance and authority in the nascent Bahá’ı́ community. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá
served in this capacity until his own death. In his will and testament
he appointed the twin successors of the Guardian and the Universal
House of Justice. His grandson Shoghi Effendi (1897–1957) guided
the affairs of the Bahá’ı́ community as Guardian until his passing. Six
years after his death the Bahá’ı́ community had grown to the point
that it could elect its international governing body, as envisioned in
Bahá’u’lláh’s writings. The Universal House of Justice was thus
elected for the first time in 1963 and now directs and coordinates the
work of the Bahá’ı́ community worldwide, serving as the permanent
center of guidance and authority within the community.44 The writ-
ings of Bahá’u’lláh, along with the elaborations provided by these
three covenantal sources of authority, articulate the vision and princi-
ples that guide the Bahá’ı́ response to oppression, which are outlined
below.

230                    PEACE & CHANGE / April 2010

The Bahá’ı́ Vision

The fundamental teaching of the Bahá’ı́ Faith is the imperative of
unity in this age of global interdependence. The goal of our collective
social evolution, Bahá’u’lláh wrote, is to see ‘‘the entire human race as
one soul and one body.’’ 45 ‘Abdu’l-Bahá explains that in the past,
‘‘owing to the absence of means, the unity of all mankind could not
have been achieved;’’ ‘‘in this day, however, means of communication
have multiplied, and the five continents of the earth have virtually
merged into one… all the members of the human family, whether
peoples or governments, cities or villages, have become increasingly
interdependent… Hence the unity of all mankind can in this day be
achieved.’’ 46 Elaborating upon this theme, Shoghi Effendi wrote that
‘‘the oneness of the entire human race’’ is ‘‘the pivotal principle’’ of
the Bahá’ı́ Faith.47 ‘‘Unity,’’ the Universal House of Justice reiterated,
‘‘is the alpha and omega of all Bahá’ı́ objectives.’’ 48 Within this con-
text, the Bahá’ı́ response to oppression is informed by a vision of unity
and interdependence that is seen as the next stage in humanity’s col-
lective social evolution—a stage representing the collective maturation
of humanity. As Shoghi Effendi explains,

> The principle of the Oneness of Mankind – the pivot round which
> all the teachings of Bahá’u’lláh revolve… is applicable not only to
> the individual, but concerns itself primarily with the nature of
> those essential relationships that must bind all the states and
> nations as members of one human family… It implies an organic
> change in the structure of present-day society, a change such as
> the world has not yet experienced… It represents the consumma-
> tion of human evolution.49

For Bahá’ı́s, unity is not only one of the primary goals of social
evolution, it is also ‘‘the power through which these goals will be pro-
gressively realized.’’50 ‘‘So powerful is the light of unity,’’ Bahá’u’lláh
asserts, ‘‘that it can illuminate the whole earth.’’51 The Bahá’ı́
approach to social change thus avoids all forms of divisive or antago-
nistic action. This includes, most obviously, a rejection of all forms of
violent resistance or violent revolution.52 Moreover, the Bahá’ı́ com-
munity does not align itself with the theory and practice of non-violent
opposition and civil disobedience that characterized many twentieth-
century social and political movements. ‘‘Conflict and contention are

Constructive Resilience                               231

categorically forbidden,’’ Bahá’u’lláh explains.53 The Bahá’ı́ approach
is thus completely non-adversarial or non-oppositional. In pursuing this
approach, Bahá’ı́s call into question some of the twentieth century’s
most deeply entrenched assumptions. Foremost among these

> is the conviction that unity is a distant, almost unattainable ideal
> to be addressed only after a host of political conflicts have been
> somehow resolved, material needs somehow satisfied, and injus-
> tices somehow corrected. The opposite, Bahá’u’lláh asserts, is the
> case. The primary disease that afflicts society and generates the
> ills that cripple it, he says, is the disunity of a human race that is
> distinguished by its capacity for collaboration and whose progress
> to date has depended on the extent to which unified action has,
> at various times and in various societies, been achieved.54

This vision of unity as both the means and the end of social change
is so fundamental to Bahá’ı́ belief that it characterizes the work of the
community even in the face of violent oppression, as the collective
experience of the Bahá’ı́s in Iran demonstrates. Of course, pursuing this
vision under such conditions has tested the will and commitment of
individual Bahá’ı́s in Iran and has resulted in personal suffering and loss
for many. In each generation, some individuals have fallen away from
the Bahá’ı́ Faith; small numbers have grown indifferent to the Bahá’ı́
teachings or resentful of Bahá’ı́ authority; and a few have compromised
Bahá’ı́ standards of conduct while continuing to identify nominally as
Bahá’ı́s. Most of the Bahá’ı́s in Iran, however, have remained firm in
their faith, the community as a whole has proven remarkably resilient,
and the institutions of the Bahá’ı́ community have guided its develop-
ment in a manner that is consistent with the long-term vision articu-
lated in Bahá’u’lláh’s writings. In this regard, the collective historical
experience of the Iranian Bahá’ı́ community provides a glimpse into the
efficacy of a distinctively non-adversarial approach to social change.
This experience will be examined after some of the underlying concepts
and principles that define this approach are discussed.

> Concepts and Principles Informing the Bahá’ı́ Response
> to Oppression

Bahá’u’lláh, like the founders of the major religious systems of the
past, affirms that there are both spiritual and material dimensions to

human nature. The human soul, according to his teachings, develops
within a matrix of mutually interacting spiritual and material forces
that affect both our inner and outer lives. As Shoghi Effendi explains,

> We cannot segregate the human heart from the environment out-
> side us and say that once one of these is reformed everything will
> be improved. Man is organic with the world. His inner life
> moulds the environment and is itself also deeply affected by it.
> The one acts upon the other and every abiding change in the life
> of man is the result of these mutual reactions.55

Bahá’ı́s therefore believe that strategies for achieving lasting social
change—including strategies for overcoming violent oppression—must
pay attention to both the material and spiritual dimensions of change,
including the transformation of hearts among both the oppressors and
the oppressed. In this regard, oppositional strategies that pit one group
against another, whether violently or non-violently, are not considered
conducive to spiritual transformation and lasting change. Bahá’ı́s thus
refrain from all divisive forms of social action, including involvement
in partisan political organizing and opposition. As the Universal
House of Justice counsels the Bahá’ı́ community,

> because of our refusal to become involved in politics, Bahá’ı́s are
> often accused of holding aloof from the ‘‘real problems’’ of their
> fellowmen. But when we hear this accusation let us not forget
> that those who make it are usually idealistic materialists to whom
> material good is the only ‘‘real’’ good, whereas we know that the
> working of the material world is merely a reflection of spiritual
> conditions and until the spiritual conditions can be changed there
> can be no lasting change for the better in material affairs.56

In addition to this focus on the spiritual requisites of change,
including the transformation of human hearts, Bahá’u’lláh places great
emphasis on processes of collective social and institutional develop-
ment. Humanity, the Bahá’ı́ writings explain, has passed through
conditions that are analogous to the stages of infancy and childhood
in the individual, and we have entered into a condition analogous to
collective adolescence in which we are realizing our full physical pow-
ers as a species, but we have not yet learned to temper these powers
through the wisdom and discretion that comes with maturity.57

Among the lessons that we need to learn at this stage in our collective
development, in order to attain the long-awaited age of maturity, is
how to live together and organize our collective affairs in a just and
sustainable manner. Of course, Bahá’ı́s do not anticipate that this
transition to a more mature social order will be easy. Indeed, they
believe it will be driven in large part by the increasingly desperate con-
ditions humanity encounters as it clings to immature patterns of
behavior.58 As Shoghi Effendi wrote,

> The world is, in truth, moving on towards its destiny. The inter-
> dependence of the peoples and nations of the earth, whatever the
> leaders of the divisive forces of the world may say or do, is
> already an accomplished fact. Its unity in the economic sphere is
> now understood and recognized. The welfare of the part means
> the welfare of the whole, and the distress of the part brings
> distress to the whole… The fires lit by this great ordeal are the
> consequences of men’s failure to recognize it. They are, moreover,
> hastening its consummation. Adversity, prolonged, worldwide,
> afflictive, allied to chaos and universal destruction, must needs
> convulse the nations, stir the conscience of the world, disillusion
> the masses, precipitate a radical change in the very conception
> of society, and coalesce ultimately the disjointed, the bleeding
> limbs of mankind into one body, single, organically united, and
> indivisible.59

Bahá’ı́s anticipate that this difficult transitional process will span
many generations, as anachronistic institutions and inherited patterns
of behavior are only reluctantly abandoned, and new ones gradually
adopted, in response to the mounting pressures brought about by our
reproductive and technological success as a species. The Bahá’ı́
approach to social change, including the Bahá’ı́ response to oppres-
sion, is thus pursued within a time frame that spans many generations.
This entails perseverance, faith, a long-term perspective, and a recog-
nition that ‘‘the patience required in the usually slow processes of
social evolution is painful’’ at times.60

Within this context, the Bahá’ı́ writings also describe two contrast-
ing processes playing out across the planet during the current age of
transition to a more harmonious global society. Shoghi Effendi
describes these processes as the simultaneous processes of ‘‘integration
and of disintegration, of order and chaos.’’61 From a Bahá’ı́ perspective,

the forces of disintegration and chaos require no assistance, as failing
institutions and anachronistic social norms are steadily collapsing under
the weight of their own dysfunction and maladaptation to current
global conditions. What is needed are functional alternatives that are
well adapted to conditions of heightened interdependence.

Bahá’ı́s are therefore encouraged to devote their time and energy
to the integrative processes associated with the construction of a viable
social order. This is yet another reason that Bahá’ı́s generally refrain
from engaging in the divisive political processes that surround them.
Instead, they are working to construct a new model of democratic
governance62 and new patterns of social interaction that they believe
will gradually prove themselves as viable alternatives to the inherited
sociopolitical order. As the Universal House of Justice explains,

> the Bahá’ı́s are following a completely different path from that
> usually followed by those who wish to reform society. They
> eschew political methods towards the achievement of their aims,
> and concentrate on revitalizing the hearts, minds and behaviour
> of people and on presenting a working model as evidence of the
> reality and practicality of the way of life they propound.63

Bahá’ı́s do not, however, seek to impose their ideas regarding gov-
ernance, or any other aspect of Bahá’ı́ community life, on others.
Rather, they believe that the model of governance they are developing,
and the patterns of social interaction they are learning, can only
be viable if they are embraced through a ‘‘supremely voluntary’’
process.64 In this regard, Bahá’ı́s reject all forms of force, coercion,
compulsion, pressure, or proselytization as means of social change.
Their strategy is one of construction and attraction: construct a viable
alternative and, to the extent that it proves itself and stands in con-
trast with the unjust and unsustainable systems of the old social order,
it will gradually attract more and more people.65

This strategy takes on a specific quality in the face of violent
oppression. For Bahá’ı́s, as the Universal House of Justice explains,
‘‘The proper response to oppression is neither to succumb in resigna-
tion nor to take on the characteristics of the oppressor. The victim of
oppression can transcend it through an inner strength that shields the
soul from bitterness and hatred and which sustains consistent, princi-
pled action.’’66 In this context, the Universal House of Justice has
described the Bahá’ı́ response to oppression as an expression of

constructive resilience. Elaborating on this theme, the Universal House
of Justice wrote to the Bahá’ı́ youth in Iran, who had been deceived
about their prospects of entering colleges and universities by authori-
ties bent on demoralizing them and inhibiting their progress:

> Recent events call to mind heart-rending episodes in the history
> of the Faith, of cruel deceptions wrought against your forebears.
> It is only appropriate that you strive to transcend the opposition
> against you with that same constructive resilience that character-
> ized their response to the duplicity of their detractors. Peering
> beyond the distress of the difficulties assailing them, those heroic
> souls attempted to translate the teachings of the new Faith into
> actions of spiritual and social development. That, too, is your
> work. Their objective was to build, to strengthen, to refine the tis-
> sues of society wherever they might find themselves; and thus,
> they set up schools, equally educating girls and boys; introduced
> progressive principles; promoted the sciences; contributed signifi-
> cantly to diverse fields such as agriculture, health, and industry –
> all of which accrued to the benefit of the nation. You, too, seek
> to render service to your homeland and to contribute to the
> renewal of civilization. They responded to the inhumanity of their
> enemies with patience, calm, resignation, and contentment, choos-
> ing to meet deception with truthfulness and cruelty with good
> will towards all. You, too, demonstrate such noble qualities and,
> holding fast to these same principles, you belie the slander
> purveyed against your Faith, evoking the admiration of the
> fair-minded.67

These principles of constructive resilience and of obedience to
laws of the land do not mean, however, that Bahá’ı́s are forbidden
from appealing for justice for themselves and other oppressed minori-
ties through proper legal channels.68 Indeed, Bahá’ı́s are directed to
pursue ‘‘every principled means’’ to defend themselves and others
against oppression69 and to work toward the empowerment of
oppressed people everywhere, and they have an established history of
advocacy and social action in this regard.70 Yet, when justice is not
forthcoming in relation to their own community, Bahá’ı́s are encour-
aged to manifest a ‘‘spirit of resourcefulness and practicality’’ in their
efforts to maintain a ‘‘vibrant community life’’ even ‘‘under the most
arduous conditions.’’71

While pursuing the path of justice through non-adversarial means,
and striving to maintain a posture of constructive resilience along the
way, the Bahá’ı́ response to oppression is also guided by other princi-
ples alluded to in the letter quoted above and elaborated elsewhere
throughout the Bahá’ı́ writings. These include the principle of meeting
hatred and persecution with love and kindness;72 the principle that we
can gain strength through adversity and hardship, and that we can
attain higher spiritual values and goals by sacrificing lower material
comforts and needs;73 the principle of cultivating spiritual qualities
and virtues within oneself and relying on the power of personal exam-
ple in order to attract and reform the hearts of others;74 and the prin-
ciple of active service to humanity to improve the conditions of all
people without regard to distinctions based on religious belief or other
categories of identity.75 As the Universal House of Justice exhorted
the Bahá’ı́ students in Iran:

> With an illumined conscience, with a world-embracing vision,
> with no partisan political agenda, and with due regard for law
> and order, strive for the regeneration of your country. By your
> deeds and services, attract the hearts of those around you, even
> win the esteem of your avowed enemies, so that you may vindicate
> the innocence of, and gain the ever-increasing respect and accep-
> tance for, your community in the land of its birth… Opposition to
> a newly revealed truth is a common matter of human history; it
> repeats itself in every age. But of equal historical consistency is the
> fact that nothing can prevail against an idea whose time has come.
> The time has arrived for freedom of belief, for harmony between
> science and religion, faith and reason, for the advancement of
> women, for freedom from prejudice of every kind, for mutual
> respect between the diverse peoples and nations, indeed, for the
> unity of the entire human race… Service to others is the way…
> Strive to work hand-in-hand, shoulder-to-shoulder, with your fel-
> low citizens in your efforts to promote the common good.76

Bahá’ı́s are thus encouraged to constantly focus on their common
humanity with others and not to see ‘‘otherness.’’ As ‘Abdu’l-Bahá
exhorted the Bahá’ı́s: ‘‘Cleanse ye your eyes, so that ye behold no man
as different from yourselves. See ye no strangers; rather see all men as
friends, for love and unity come hard when ye fix your gaze on other-
ness.’’77

In sum, the Bahá’ı́ approach to social change is characterized by
the following ideals: collective commitment to the oneness of human-
ity; recognition of the spiritual and material dimensions of human
reality; a long-term perspective accompanied by faith, patience, and
perseverance; rejection of all divisive and adversarial forms of social
or political action; a pledge of loyalty and obedience to the laws of
the land within which Bahá’ı́s live; the cultivation of spiritual qualities
and reliance on the power of personal example; the peaceful construc-
tion of viable, alternative institutional models; the steady attraction of
others who are invited to voluntarily embrace these patterns of indi-
vidual and collective life; a posture of constructive resilience in the
face of violent oppression; a commitment to meet hatred and persecu-
tion with love and kindness; acceptance of the role that hardship and
adversity can play in processes of personal as well as collective growth
and development; and the principle of active service to the welfare of
others, regardless of their backgrounds or beliefs, even under oppres-
sive conditions.

In practice, of course, individual Bahá’ı́s sometimes fall short of
these ideals. Within any community, it is natural that the level of
commitment to, internalization of, and successful application of the
community’s professed ideals will vary among individuals—as the
following discussion of the experience of the Bahá’ı́ community
acknowledges. However, history has demonstrated that commitment
to ideals can be a powerful force of motivation, change, and personal
sacrifice for the common good. In this regard, the power of the ideals
outlined above has been demonstrated, perhaps most clearly, by the
willingness of thousands of Bahá’ı́ martyrs, over the course of years of
violent persecution, to accept even the sacrifice of their lives on the
path of commitment to these ideals and the faith that underlies
them.78

The Experience of the Bahá’ı́ Community

The experience of the Bahá’ı́ community in the pursuit of a con-
structive and non-adversarial response to oppression has been complex
and multifaceted. Small numbers of Bahá’ı́s have been unable or
unwilling to commit to the ideals outlined above or sustain the sacri-
fices those ideals can entail, and they have drifted away from the
community or recanted their faith. In each generation, a few individ-
uals have knowingly violated principles such as non-involvement in

partisan politics, and as a result have had their membership rights
removed within the Bahá’ı́ community by its elected institutions. Some
individuals have engaged in other activities that are inconsistent with
the Bahá’ı́ teachings and have thus aggravated the plight of the Bahá’ı́
community by providing antagonists with a pretext to launch cam-
paigns of calumny or assault against the entire community. For
instance, during periods of relative calm when Bahá’ı́s have had
opportunities to pursue their education and careers in a largely
unimpeded manner inside Iran, some individuals have ignored Bahá’ı́
teachings pertaining to the avoidance of extremes of wealth and
poverty, and the need for moderation in all things, and they have
instead amassed great personal wealth that attracted the suspicions,
envies, and animosities of some Iranians, which in turn created fertile
ground for assaults against the entire community. On the whole,
however, Bahá’ı́s have demonstrated a strong collective commitment
to the ideals embodied in the Bahá’ı́ teachings, including the ideals of
constructive resilience in the face of oppression.

Inside Iran, the Bahá’ı́ community has made great progress toward
the implementation of Bahá’u’lláh’s vision. For instance, in a society
with patriarchal currents that continue to deny women many of the
freedoms, rights, and opportunities available to men, Bahá’ı́s were the
first to reject the veiling of women, to declare the full equality of men
and women, and to begin translating this principle into practice in
every arena of family and community life. Among other things,
Bahá’ı́s established the first schools for girls in Iran. These schools
were open not only to Bahá’ı́s but to people of all faiths and back-
grounds. Indeed, they trained the first generation of professional
women ever in Iran and their influence has been felt throughout the
entire society.79

Within the Bahá’ı́ community itself, the advancement of women
was especially pronounced. As the Bahá’ı́ community learned to trans-
late Bahá’u’lláh’s teachings into practice, which often required them to
transcend deeply entrenched cultural norms, women were increasingly
integrated with men in all Bahá’ı́ community functions. In the space of
a few generations women and men were working side by side as full
partners in elected Bahá’ı́ institutions and committees. In the process,
women gained valuable skills as well as an invaluable sense of dignity
and self-worth. This does not mean, of course, that the Bahá’ı́ commu-
nity has successfully resolved every internal issue related to gender
equality, or that individual Bahá’ı́s and individual Bahá’ı́ families do

not continue to struggle with the legacies of sexism in various ways.
Yet the accomplishments of the Iranian Bahá’ı́ community, as a whole,
have been impressive when it comes to the advancement of women.
For instance, by 1974, Bahá’ı́ women in Iran under the age of 40 had
achieved 100 percent literacy, in comparison to the national average
of only 15 percent.80 In turn, these commitments to the advancement
of women, combined with equally deep commitments to educational
excellence and a strong work ethic, propelled the rapid social and eco-
nomic development of the entire Iranian Bahá’ı́ community which, by
the mid-twentieth century, occupied leading positions across all
professional sectors within Iran.

Following the Islamic revolution in 1979, many Bahá’ı́s were fired
from the high positions they had attained,81 thousands were reduced
to poverty as the authorities imposed a number of measures ‘‘designed
to suffocate the economic life of the Bahá’ı́ community,’’82 and thou-
sands of Bahá’ı́ children and youth across the country were denied
access to education.83 However, rather than organize politically
against the authorities, or resign themselves as victims of forces
beyond their control, the Bahá’ı́s began mobilizing their limited
resources and setting up creative systems to ensure their survival.
Some Bahá’ı́ entrepreneurs, despite attempts by various antagonists to
force them out of business, have been able to quietly maintain modest
businesses. In the process, many have also been able to hire Bahá’ı́s
who had lost their own employment. Iranian Bahá’ı́s have also estab-
lished systems to care for elderly Bahá’ı́s who have lost their pensions,
and to educate Bahá’ı́ children who have been expelled from schools.

The Bahá’ı́s established their own ‘‘open university’’ in a process
that was described in the New York Times as ‘‘an elaborate act of
self-preservation.’’84 The Bahá’ı́ Institute for Higher Education (BIHE)
was created in 1987 to provide for the educational needs of Bahá’ı́
youth and young adults after they were denied access to Iranian col-
leges and universities.85 The BIHE now operates via online courses,
supplemented by seminars and labs in Bahá’ı́ homes and offices
throughout Iran. Despite efforts by the Iranian authorities to disrupt
the university’s operation by raiding hundreds of Bahá’ı́ homes and
offices associated with it, by confiscating BIHE materials and property,
and by arresting and imprisoning dozens of faculty, the university has
grown to the point that it now offers 14 undergraduate degree pro-
grams and 3 graduate degree programs in the sciences, social sciences,
and arts. Over 700 courses are offered through the services and

support of approximately 275 faculty and staff. The university relies
in part upon the services of Iranian Bahá’ı́ academics and profession-
als, many of whom were fired from their jobs by the Iranian authori-
ties following the Islamic revolution. It also relies on a network of
affiliated global faculty that support the university through online
courses, curriculum development, and other services. Its reputation for
academic excellence has led twenty-five respected universities in North
America, Europe, and Australia to accept BIHE graduates directly into
programs of graduate study at the masters and doctoral levels. The
BIHE is, in short, a clear illustration of the constructive resilience of
the Iranian Bahá’ı́s.

While Bahá’ı́s inside Iran have adopted a posture of constructive
resilience in response to oppression, the worldwide Bahá’ı́ community
has pursued a strategy of shining a light on the situation in Iran to
raise global awareness and appeal for justice within the emerging
international framework of moral and legal norms. This campaign to
educate governments, human rights organizations, and journalists
around the world about the situation in Iran has been remarkably suc-
cessful. Scores of resolutions in support of the Iranian Bahá’ı́s have
been passed by the United Nations General Assembly and other UN
agencies; similar resolutions have been passed by parliaments and con-
gresses around the world; appeals for justice have been articulated by
diverse human rights organizations; and considerable attention has
been given to the situation by the international media.86

These efforts have curbed some of the violence directed against
the Bahá’ı́s because the Iranian authorities recognize Iran’s social and
economic interdependence within the larger community of nations.87
The desire of some authorities to extinguish the Bahá’ı́ community is
thus tempered by the desire among most for more favorable percep-
tions in the court of global opinion. The exemplary conduct of the
Bahá’ı́s inside Iran also has mitigated, to some degree, the campaign
against Bahá’ı́s, as many Muslim friends, neighbors, co-workers, and
employers inside Iran have taken measures to shield and defend the
Bahá’ı́s—often at great personal risk. Even some moderate clerics have
risked their lives by shielding Bahá’ı́ homes against violent mobs.88
Meanwhile, a growing number of Iranian journalists, intellectuals, and
organizations of civil society are beginning to openly register their
concern regarding the treatment of Bahá’ı́s and some Iranian political
parties are beginning to advocate official recognition of the Bahá’ı́s.89
Thus the emerging international framework of moral and legal norms

has its counterpart within Iran which, like all contemporary nations,
is characterized by a complex interplay of progressive and regressive
forces. In this regard, as the experience of the Bahá’ı́ community
suggests, progressive forces emerging within many societies provide an
increasingly powerful national conscience to which oppressed
minorities can appeal, if their innocence and political neutrality are
recognized.

The experience of, and response to, oppression by Iranian
Bahá’ı́s has had other effects as well. Within Iran, it has galvanized
the commitment and resolve of many Bahá’ı́s. It has also led thou-
sands of Iranian Bahá’ı́ refugees into the field of international service,
where their influence on the growth and development of Bahá’ı́ com-
munities in many parts of the world, and their services to humanity
through diverse trades and professions, has been substantial. The
example of the Iranian Bahá’ı́s, both inside Iran and throughout their
global diaspora, has prompted Bahá’ı́s from diverse backgrounds in
all parts of the world to new levels of inspiration and commitment,
including heightened attention to constructive processes of social and
economic development within other oppressed and disadvantaged
populations.

Of course, the experience and impacts of this global diaspora
should not be oversimplified or romanticized. Many Bahá’ı́ refugees
suffered significant personal loss and trauma as they fled Iran and
attempted to start new lives in foreign lands. The faith and commit-
ment of a few has been weakened. Some have been drawn, to varying
degrees, into the materialistic consumer cultures of the countries in
which they have resettled. Some have resettled near one another in
such large numbers that they have momentarily overwhelmed the
smaller Bahá’ı́ communities that attempted to absorb them, creating
new challenges and cultural conflicts that these communities have had
to work through. On the whole, however, the dispersal of Iranian
Bahá’ı́s around the world has lent a powerful impulse to the growth
and development of the worldwide Bahá’ı́ community, including its
outreach efforts to serve other oppressed or needy populations.

Around the world, the global campaign to shine a light on the
situation in Iran has forged new institutional capacities for coordi-
nated global action within the Bahá’ı́ community, marking a new
stage in the internal maturation of the community. This, in turn, has
aided the emergence of the community from relative obscurity on the
world stage, where the Bahá’ı́ Faith is now widely recognized as an

independent world religion and its basic tenets are more widely and
more favorably understood.

In short, by persevering with a principled and constructive
approach, even in the face of violent oppression, Bahá’ı́s are demon-
strating the potential of a purely non-adversarial model of social
change. Granted, the personal costs have been high for many Bahá’ı́s.
It is likely, however, that the costs would have been much higher if
the Bahá’ı́s had pursued a path of political resistance, opposition, and
civil disobedience, thereby alienating large segments of Iranian society
by their own actions, providing the authorities with a pretext for a
full-scale assault, and confusing global perceptions regarding their
innocence. Moreover, the emotional and psychological resilience of
Bahá’ı́s who have experienced extreme trauma in Iran has been excep-
tional, as a number of recent studies have demonstrated.90 According
to these studies, this resilience appears to be due, at least in part, to
the strength and coherence of their inner beliefs; to the meaning,
vision, and moral purpose their faith provides them; and to their
ability to maintain an internal locus of control over their moral and
spiritual fate. For the most part, the Bahá’ı́s of Iran have never let
their oppressors establish the terms of the encounter. They have gener-
ally refused to play the role of victim; refused to be dehumanized;
refused to forfeit their sense of constructive agency; and refused to
compromise their principles or forsake their beliefs.

AN INVITATION TO FURTHER INQUIRY

In 1889, Edward Granville Browne, an Oxford scholar who observed
the Bábı́ and Bahá’ı́ movements closely, wrote that ‘‘it is not a small
or easy thing to endure what these have endured, and surely what they
deemed worth life itself is worth trying to understand.’’91 Over a
century later, the vision and beliefs of the Bahá’ı́ community are
beginning to attract the sustained attention of outside observers. Yet
the Bahá’ı́ approach to social change, including their response to
oppression, has received comparatively little attention.

In this context, the preceding analysis constitutes an invitation
into a field of inquiry that may shed new light on the dynamics of
social change in an era of heightened global interdependence. The
Bahá’ı́ teachings assert, in essence, that oppositional strategies of
social change, whether violent or non-violent, have reached a point of
diminishing returns at this stage in human history because they do not

address the underlying cause of injustice and oppression. The underly-
ing cause, according to Bahá’u’lláh, is a widespread reluctance to
accept, on a spiritual and intellectual level, the organic unity and
interdependence—or common identity and interests—of all human
beings. Given this interpretation of reality, Bahá’ı́s in turn believe that,
although positive social change may have been achieved in the past by
divisive and oppositional strategies, these strategies are ultimately
incapable of addressing the contemporary challenges of a rapidly inte-
grating global society. These interpretations, along with the overall
historical experience of the Bahá’ı́ community that derives from them,
suggest a set of heuristic insights that can open new lines of inquiry
into the dynamics of social change in the twenty-first century.

First, the theory and collective practice of the Bahá’ı́ community
suggest that as long as underlying identities and interests remain in
conflict, strategies of non-violent opposition may simply be countered
by increasingly sophisticated strategies of non-violent oppression
because they do not address the root causes of social injustice and
oppression. Thus one could argue that escalating cycles of violent
conflict and oppression are now, as a result of movements toward
non-violent opposition, being replaced by escalating cycles of non-vio-
lent conflict and oppression. Indeed, one could argue that two centu-
ries of non-violent partisan-political conflict in the most ‘‘enlightened’’
western democracies has resulted in exactly this outcome, as powerful
interest groups have systematically learned how to manipulate these
oppositional systems to their own advantage, resulting, among other
things, in massive and steadily growing disparities between the richest
and poorest populations within and between contemporary states. Or
consider the history of racism in the United States: when a violent civil
war brought the formal institution of slavery to an end in the 1860s,
racism quickly reasserted itself in the form of discriminatory laws and
overtly racist practices that emerged during the reconstruction period
that followed. When these discriminatory laws and practices were
challenged through largely non-violent means by the U.S. civil rights
movement that gathered momentum a century later, overt and legal
forms of racism were in turn replaced with more subtle forms of insti-
tutionalized and unspoken racism that continue to perpetuate racial
disparities and injustices in the U.S. today—notwithstanding the fact
that a majority of voters in the United States recently elected the first
African-American president. Therefore, even though significant histori-
cal progress has been achieved through these methods, it appears that

racism may continue to reassert itself as long as interests and identities
are understood by significant segments of the population in racial
terms. It may continue, in other words, as long as people refuse to
fully accept the oneness of humanity, in both theory and practice.

Second, the theory and collective practice of the Bahá’ı́ commu-
nity suggest that as long as underlying identities and interests remain
in conflict, even relatively successful strategies of non-violent opposi-
tion may only result in the reversal or transference of oppressive rela-
tions. This is, again, because the underlying paradigms of identity
conflict and interest-group competition are not altered by strategies of
non-violent conflict. For instance, after labor union movements within
many western nations secured various benefits for their workers
through hard-fought yet largely non-violent oppositional struggles,
many of these unions began advocating trade policies and labor laws
that advanced their narrow self-interests at the expense of their non-
unionized fellow citizens as well as workers in more impoverished
parts of the world. The intent of this illustration, of course, is not to
belittle the significant accomplishments of labor movements. Rather,
the intent is to suggest that the underlying paradigms of identity con-
flict and interest-group competition, and the violent or non-violent
oppositional strategies of change they engender, may not ultimately
lead to the just world that many social reformers seek.

Third, the theory and collective practice of the Bahá’ı́ community
suggest that non-violent opposition to unjust and oppressive institu-
tions diverts valuable time and energy away from the construction of
alternative institutional forms derived from the principles of unity and
interdependence. In this regard, when oppressive systems are thrown
off by non-violent opposition movements, the vacuum that is left
appears to create a rush to power among competing interest groups
that merely invites new forms of oppression. For instance, Gandhi’s
non-violent independence movement successfully threw off the oppres-
sive yoke of the British empire. However, since the movement had not
constructed a viable, just, and unifying model for the governance of
India, the vacuum that was created allowed a rush to power that
resulted in half a million deaths from sectarian violence, the forced
migration and resettlement of over 12 million Hindu and Muslim refu-
gees, the partitioning of the Indian sub-continent into two hostile
states, and a half-century of ongoing sectarian conflict within and
between each of these states that now live under the mutual threat of
nuclear warfare. Again, the intent of this illustration is not to diminish

Gandhi’s stature, belittle his accomplishments, overlook his enlight-
ened views on ethnic and religious diversity, or ignore his tireless and
laudable efforts to effect social harmony. Rather, the intent is to
explore possible limitations of his approach and to raise the question
of whether more refined approaches to social change that minimize or
eliminate these unintended aftereffects are possible.

Fourth, the theory and collective practice of the Bahá’ı́ community
suggest that oppositional models of social change, however non-
violent, may ultimately be self-defeating within the expanding
Western-liberal ‘‘culture of contest’’ wherein almost every major social
institution is structured as a formalized contest of power. Thus we see
partisan contests in the political arena, advocacy contests in the legal
arena, contests of capital accumulation in the economic arena, grade-
based contests in the educational arena, physical contests in the arena
of sport, and so on—in which various expressions of power determine
the winners and losers. This is a theme that has been explored in
much greater depth elsewhere.92 In this context, oppositional models
of social change may be self-defeating because contests of power tend,
ultimately, to privilege dominant social groups who have the most
power. The injustices that result from this arrangement are, in part,
what lead people to engage in adversarial forms of social protest and
political opposition directed against those injustices. Ironically, no
matter how non-violent these oppositional responses are, they can still
be understood as extensions of the culture of contest. In this regard,
they arguably tend to perpetuate the privileges of the most powerful
segments of society through the escalating cycles of non-violent
oppression alluded to above. Even more fundamentally, they reflect
and reinforce the assumptions about human nature and social order
that underlie and perpetuate the culture of contest. In the process, they
legitimize the foundational assumptions from which the institutions of
the culture of contest are constructed and by which a culture of injus-
tice is often perpetuated—hence ‘‘the paradox of protest in a culture
of contest.’’93

Of course, the heuristic insights suggested above will undoubtedly
be met with much skepticism, since they challenge deeply held
assumptions about human nature and social order that are prevalent
in many contemporary societies. This article therefore serves as an
invitation to dialogue and further inquiry regarding these vital sub-
jects, which should be of growing concern in the decades ahead, as
humanity grapples with the challenges of global interdependence. The

purpose of this article is not to suggest that Bahá’ı́s have all the
answers or that they are pursuing the only valid path of social change.
Rather, its purpose is to point out that the Bahá’ı́ community is accu-
mulating experience within a unique conceptual framework that raises
new questions about, and may offer new insights into, processes of
social change.

In this context, the Bahá’ı́ community can be understood as a vast
social experiment in which non-adversarial strategies of social change
are being tested and explored. The Bahá’ı́ community, ultimately, is
attempting to reconcile conflicting identities and interests within the
framework of a common human identity and shared collective inter-
ests through peaceful, unifying, and constructive methods. Such a
strategy may appear naı̈ve when one looks back on the behavior of
many social groups throughout human history. Indeed, the Bahá’ı́
strategy would likely not have been viable in the past, when human
populations were relatively isolated and independent, when they could
afford to ignore their essential oneness, and when there was no emerg-
ing global framework of moral and legal norms to which an oppressed
population could appeal. However, such a strategy may prove to be
essential in the future, as increased interdependence becomes an ines-
capable reality that humanity can no longer afford to deny because
the social and ecological costs of denial are becoming too high.

Furthermore, a unifying and non-adversarial strategy of social
change may now be viable, on a global scale, for two reasons. First,
the emergence of integrative and efficient technologies of global com-
munication and transportation have created the potential, for the first
time in human history, for distant people to see themselves as one
human family, and thus to recognize and operationalize the principle
of oneness. Second, the emergence of progressive global discourses
regarding peace, social justice, and human rights (among others) are
creating new opportunities for constructive social change and coordi-
nated global action that are consistent with the principle of oneness.
In other words, for the first time in human history, a global frame-
work of moral and legal norms is emerging, to which an oppressed
population can appeal. Indeed, it has been the combination of these
two factors that has enabled the worldwide Bahá’ı́ community to
appeal, on behalf of their beleaguered brothers and sisters in Iran, to
the conscience of fair-minded people around the planet, who in turn
have taken effective actions to mitigate the suffering of Bahá’ı́s in
Iran.

The Bahá’ı́ community is thus pioneering a radical new model of
social change—entirely non-adversarial in nature—that appears ini-
tially to be viable even in the face of violent oppression. All interested
observers can study and learn from the accumulating experience of the
Bahá’ı́ community in this regard, as a test of the hypothesis that peace
and justice can be effected through unifying and constructive, rather
than divisive or destructive, strategies of social change.94

3. The effectiveness of these intimidation tactics has begun to diminish in
recent years as a growing number of prominent Iranians, such as Shirin Ebadi

(Iran’s only winner of the Nobel Peace Prize and the first Muslim woman
awarded that prize), have begun to speak out on behalf of the Bahá’ı́s, often at
great personal risk. For historical overviews of the means used to cultivate
prejudice and animosity against the Bahá’ı́s in Iran, refer to Dominic Parviz
Brookshaw and Seena B. Fazel, The Bahá’ı́s of Iran: Socio-Historical Studies
(Oxford: Routledge 2007); refer especially to chapters by Abbas Amanat
(‘‘The Historical Roots of the Persecution of Babis and Bahá’ı́s in Iran’’), H. E.
Chehabi (‘‘Anatomy of Prejudice: Reflections on Secular anti-Bahá’ı́sm in
Iran’’), Mohamad Tavakoli-Targh (‘‘Anti-Bahá’ı́sm and Islamism in Iran’’),
and Reza Afshari (‘‘The Discourse and Practice of Human Rights Violations of
the Iranian Bahá’ı́s in the Islamic Republic of Iran’’).

4. For examples of the attention that is being paid to the plight of
Iranian Bahá’ı́s from observers outside of Iran, refer to Human Rights
Watch, ‘‘Iran: Scores Arrested in Anti-Bahá’ı́ Campaign,’’ Human Rights
News (June 6, 2006); Amnesty International, ‘‘Iran: New Government Fails

International, 2002); Dominic Parviz Brookshaw and Seena B. Fazel, The
Bahá’ı́s of Iran: Socio-Historical Studies (Oxford: Routledge, 2007).
Progressive individuals within Iranian society who have recently spoken out
on behalf of, or sought to defend the rights of, Iranian Bahá’ı́s include
Nobel Laureate Shirin Ebadi, her legal partner Abdolfattah Soltani, and
their organization the Defenders of Human Rights Center in Tehran; Grand
Ayatollah Hossein-Ali Montazeri; and Professor Saeed Hanaee Kashani.
Prominent Iranian expatriates who have spoken out publicly on behalf of
the Bahá’ı́s in Iran include prominent academics, writers, journalists,
activists, and artists such as Abbas Milani, Bahram Choubine, Mohammad
Tavakoli-Targhi, Iqbal Latif, Ahmad Betabi, Behrooz Setoodeh, Soheila
Vahdati, Amil Imani, Majid Naficy, Farhang Farahi, Hossein Bagher-Zadeh,
Khosro Shemiranie, Reza Fani, Jahanshah Rashidian, Hasan Zerehi, Azar
Nafisi, Ali Kheshtgar, and Shohreh Aghdashloo. In addition, an open letter
of apology entitled ‘‘We Are Ashamed’’ was recently drafted by a group of
42 expatriate professionals, and over 260 additional Iranian expatriates have
since added their names to the letter (http://www.we-are-ashamed.com).
Iranian human rights organizations, political parties, and scholarly
associations that have recently published statements advocating for the
rights of the Bahá’ı́s in Iran include the Human Rights Activists of Iran, the
Iranian Minorities Human Rights Organization, the International Campaign

for Human Rights in Iran, the United Republicans of Iran, the
Constitutionalist Party of Iran, the Organization of the Iranian People’s
Majority, the Organization of Iranian Socialists, the National Salvation
Movement of Iran, and the Association of Iranian Researchers. In addition,
a human rights organization called the Muslim Network for Bahá’ı́ Rights
recently formed for the specific purpose of speaking out on behalf of
Bahá’ı́s who are persecuted within the Middle East generally, and Iran in
particular.

government. In general, Bahá’ı́s are encouraged to remain obedient to their

Bahá’ı́ guidance on loyalty and obedience to government, refer to Peter Khan,

Iranian Supreme Revolutionary Cultural Council in 1991, at the request of
the Leader of the Islamic Republic of Iran, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, and the
President of Iran, Ayatollah Ali Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani. This document
outlines a strategy to quietly suffocate the Bahá’ı́ community in Iran in a
manner that would not attract international attention. It came to light in a
1993 report by U.N. Special Representative Reynaldo Galindo Pohl on the
situation in Iran, and has been reprinted in its entirety in numerous sources,
including the International Federation of Human Rights, ‘‘Discrimination

condone violence as a method of social change, nor do they respond to
religious persecution with violence. For a discussion of the Bahá’ı́ view on
collective security and the just use of military force, refer to Bahá’u’lláh,

70. Bahá’ı́s have been addressing the oppression of diverse populations
through a range of constructive, non-adversarial strategies for many years.
These strategies are pursued in three broad domains: (1) formal Bahá’ı́
community engagement with institutions such as the United Nations, national
governments, or non-governmental organizations, (2) Bahá’ı́-inspired social
action initiatives ranging from small individual initiatives to complex
collaborative projects of social and economic development, and (3) individual
Bahá’ı́s working through their chosen professions in fields such as education,
health care, media, and public policy. In the first domain, the offices of the
Bahá’ı́ International Community at the United Nations have been a leading
voice on the international stage regarding the emancipation of women in all
countries. A particularly noteworthy contribution Bahá’ı́s have made in this
regard has been a decades-long campaign to focus global attention on the
priority of educating female children—a practice that the international
development community is now recognizing as one of the single most effective
measures that can be taken to raise the living standards of impoverished or
oppressed communities in all parts of the world. In addition, Bahá’ı́s have
been a leading presence in the field of human rights advocacy within the
United Nations system and other international venues, dating back to the
drafting of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights in 1948. National
Bahá’ı́ communities have also taken leadership roles in advocating that their
governments ratify human rights treaties such as the U.N. Convention to
Eliminate Racial Discrimination, the International Covenant on Civil and
Political Rights, the International Convention on the Prevention and

Punishment of the Crime of Genocide, and the International Convention
against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or
Punishment. Current ratification efforts are focused on the Convention on the
Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women and the
Convention on the Rights of the Child. In the second domain referred to
above, Bahá’ı́s are engaged in thousands of social action projects around the
world, focusing on a wide range of contemporary issues and needs. An
overview of the Bahá’ı́ approach and accomplishments in the field of social
action can be found in For the Betterment of the World: The Worldwide
Bahá’ı́ Community’s Approach to Social and Economic Development (United
Nations Plaza, New York: Bahá’ı́ International Community Office of Social

control. For a discussion of the Bahá’ı́ teachings related to martyrdom, refer to

81. For instance, by 1987 over 11,000 Bahá’ı́ government employees had
been dismissed from their jobs as a result of anti-Bahá’ı́ legislation, as Bahá’ı́s

were purged from all levels of public administration and dismissed from many
private companies as well (Fergus Bordewich, ‘‘Holy Terror: Moslem Zealots
Wage a Deadly War Against Bahá’ı́ Heresies,’’ The Atlantic Monthly, 259,
April 1987).

82. Iran Human Rights Documentation Center, A Faith Denied: The
Persecution of the Bahá’ı́s of Iran (New Haven, CT: IHRDC, 2006), 40.
Measures taken by the Iranian authorities to reduce Bahá’ı́s to poverty include
denial of education, denial of public employment, revocation of many business
licenses, pressure on many employers to dismiss Bahá’ı́ employees, denial of
previously earned pensions, requirements to pay back already received
pensions, confiscation of homes and other personal property, and denial of
inheritance rights. Documentation of these economically repressive measures
can be found in a number of sources, including in the A Faith Denied report
referred to above; in the International Federation of Human Rights’
‘‘Discrimination against Religious Minorities in Iran’’ (Paris: August 2003);
and in Reza Afshari, ‘‘The Discourse and Practice of Human Rights Violations

Brookshaw and Seena B. Fazel, The Bahá’ı́s of Iran: Socio-Historical Studies
(Oxford: Routledge, 2007), 232–277. The oppressive measures documented in
these sources are, in turn, consistent with the 1991 Iranian government’s
internal memorandum on ‘‘The Bahá’ı́ Question’’ referred to earlier in this
article, which prescribes that the government deal with Bahá’ı́s ‘‘in such a way
that their progress and development are blocked.’’
