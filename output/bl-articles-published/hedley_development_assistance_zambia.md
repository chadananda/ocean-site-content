Introduction and Background

We live in a time of increasing polarization of wealth and poverty, a pro-
cess which provides some of the most poignant examples of how the interna-
tional community allows basic human rights to be contravened. The United
Nations Human Development Report says the top 200 billionnaires had a com-
bined wealth of $1,1345 billion in 1999, up by $100 billion, while the income of
the 582 million poorest people in developing countries barely exceeds 10%
of that, at $146 billion. In the 30 wealthiest countries, life expectancy exceeded
75 years, while it averages 48.9 years in sub-Saharan Africa, and drops to 39.1 in
Malawi and 37.9 in Sierra Leone. These inequalities are now classified by the
UN as human rights violations, which now include economic, social and cultural
rights, not only political and civil rights.1

The Right to Development Assistance, and the Duty to Contribute

> We see amongst us men who are overburdened with riches on the one hand, and on the
> other those unfortunate ones who starve with nothing; those who possess several stately
> palaces, and those who have not where to lay their head… This condition of affairs is
> wrong and must be remedied. Now the remedy must be carefully undertaken.2

If the international community would recognize the right of every member
of the human family to the means of a secure livelihood, there could be a
greatly increased flow of aid funding into poverty reduction programs in the
most disadvantaged countries of the world. But few could argue that extra re-
sources would be enough; having rights does not necessarily imply simply
receiving handouts. Among numerous ingredients of effective development
programs, there is arguably a set of duties that the individual beneficiaries
should fulfill, to contribute to their own personal development and that of their
community. These duties are important not only in terms of the practical re-
quirements of implementing poverty reduction programs, but also in terms of
the spiritual development of the individuals, their families and communities.
And looking more broadly at such programs, by actively participating and con-
tributing at a local level, people develop capabilities to participate globally in
creating a more just, unified world.

This paper examines the experiences of a poverty reduction program imple-
mented in Zambia, Southern Africa, by an international NGO, CARE, and the
policy process whereby it sought to enshrine the principle of rights being
matched by responsibilities. Zambia has suffered a long-term economic de-
cline from being one of the wealthiest sub-Suharan countries in the 1960s to
one of the poorest (UNICEF, 1995), and like most African countries is currently
undergoing a structural adjustment programme (SAP) involving economic
liberalisation, privatisation, removal of food subsidies, introduction of fees
for services, and decentralization of government services. Few infrastructure
services like water and sanitation exist in peri-urban settlements, and the gov-
ernment has embraced policies of community participation and partnership to
mobilise more actors to assist with national development.

Since 1994, CARE’s Project Urban Self-Help (PUSH) has worked in peri-
urban settlements in Lusaka and Livingstone, with a combined population of
350,000, facilitating appraisals and needs assessments, forming community in-
stitutions that liaise with City Councils (“Area-Based Organisations,” or ABOs),
undertaking infrastructure improvements and establishing savings and loan ser-
vices. The project encouraged residents’ ownership and active participation in
their own development, as an element of the capacity-building and sustainability
of the project, while CARE provided capital funds and technical assistance for
water projects and other interventions.

The Right to Development Assistance, and the Duty to Contribute

This expectation of considerable participation on the part of residents was
in line with widespread agreement internationally that long-term develop-
ment will require micro-level transformations (as well as macro transforma-
tions), involving people in strengthening their own capabilities, and establishing
transparent and effective local institutions. Despite initial agreements on this
point, however, many residents pressed for CARE to provide financial and
other “incentives” for them to participate in meetings and other work involved
in their communities, a practice common among many other local and interna-
tional organizations.

As PUSH was expanded into the Programme of Support for Poverty Elimi-
nation and Community Transformation (PROSPECT), it became necessary for
the programme to formally agree with stakeholders on its policy with respect
to incentives. The problem was reframed in terms of the objectives of sustain-
able livelihood improvement which the programme sought to achieve. Through
a consultation process, PROSPECT attempted to engage residents’ participation
in establishing a workable policy. As an expatriate manager of the programme,
I decided to shift from actively directing the final stages of this process to
encouraging Zambian staff to lead it. I hoped this decision would allow a more
locally-appropriate and sustainable policy to emerge which would be widely
owned by staff and counterparts. At the same time, I was conducting qualitative
research and writing a dissertation reflecting on both the policy content and
process.

This paper commences with a description of the context and the problem,
followed by an analysis of the issues involved from the perspective of the
Bahá’í Writings and other literature, and then an explanation of how the policy
was set and how stakeholders understood the issues. The paper provides an
insight, I hope, into the complexities of defining rights and responsibilities in
a world of stark economic contrasts, cultural divides and clashing organiza-
tional mandates.

Drawing on the Bahá’í Teachings in the Process of Development

Bahá’ís concerned with rights and duties in the field of international devel-
opment have the challenge, firstly, of understanding Bahá’u’lláh’s vision of a
more equitable world without uncritically inheriting elements of theories preva-
lent in the world today. In addition, one must attempt to discern potential “trans-
formational portals” from the present towards that vision, portals in which one
can visualize oneself moving and acting. One’s understanding of current reali-
ties and of medium and long term goals can not be static:

> The Right to Development Assistance, and the Duty to Contribute

> …your assumptions, your ideals, the way you interpret the world around you, your aims,
> your values, your approach to life are but a few of the elements that form the framework
> of your endeavors.… The framework of your initiatives must evolve over the years, but
> even when it is incomplete it must hold your actions together and give your movements
> direction.3

Furthermore, they must be able to articulate their vision in various ways to
their co-religionists, to other development practitioners and researchers, and
to members of the general public. To engage in dialogue and action with like-
minded people often requires that Bahá’ís know and work within—but are not
constrained by—paradigms or frames4 which are regarded as setting and shap-
ing the wider agenda. The framework of human rights has risen in prominence
in international policy over the past two decades and is being mainstreamed
into the international development field in the form of “rights-based approaches”
to development.

This framework of human rights has been evolving since the 1948 Universal
Declaration of Human Rights, which Karel Vasak explains in terms of a frame-
work of three generations of human rights.5 The first generation pertains to
civil and political rights concerned with liberty, and the second generation
pertains to economic, social, and cultural rights concerned with issues of equal-
ity. The third generation pertains to collective or solidarity rights, outlined in
general terms in Article 28 of the Universal Declaration which declared: “Ev-
eryone is entitled to a social and international order in which the rights set
forth in the Declaration can be fully realized.” Weinberg points out that “…more
than establishing normative standards, the human rights discourse provides a
mechanism for people of divergent convictions to learn about each other, re-
solve particular disagreements, and arrive at new understandings of what is
possible for human beings.”6

The Bahá’í approach to the problem of extreme poverty is based on the
application of spiritual principles, encompassing all of these three generations
of rights. The bedrock of the Bahá’í approach is the principle of oneness, a
profound universal vision, implying a move towards greater solidarity, more
cooperative and consensual modes of decision-making, the equality of women
and men, and the unity in the diversity of the races. And it states unequivocally
that all human beings are born with equal rights, to grow and develop their
potentialities with equal opportunities. Bahá’u’lláh compared the world to the
human body, which is composed of a huge variety of cells, composing various
organs and systems, with very different but complementary functions.

> No cell lives apart from the body, whether in contributing to its functioning or in deriving its
> share from the well-being of the whole. The physical well-being thus achieved finds its
> purpose in making possible the expression of human consciousness; that is to say, the
> purpose of biological development transcends the mere existence of the body and its
> parts.7

Justice is a preeminent means to this oneness, and until justice is valued
over greed, the gap between the rich and the poor will continue to widen. A
new economic order can be founded only on a vision of community that is
world embracing and on an unshakable conviction of the oneness of mankind.
This allows a dialogue that expands beyond current economic constructs to one
that anticipates the emergence of a global system of relationships of equity and
justice. The economic system anticipated in the Bahá’í Writings, although it will
no doubt resemble the present system in many ways, will have significant points
of distinction.

The Bahá’í view of income distribution, for example, allows for differ-
ences but eliminates both extreme wealth and extreme poverty. This is ef-
fected through laws and regulations as well as by the promotion of voluntary
sharing, to limit personal wealth to moberate levels and provide all people
with the means for living a dignified life. Also, the Bahá’í Writings anticipate
the development of community social service institutions which afford relief
to the suffering, sustenance to the poor, shelter to the wayfarer, solace to the
bereaved, and education to the ignorant. At the same time, both the responsibil-
ity and the right to work for one’s sustenance is seen as sacred, and idleness and
begging are prohibited. 8

In 1983 the Universal House of Justice called for the more widespread
incorporation of social and economic development into Bahá’í community life,
by beginning to apply spiritual principles, practice rectitude of conduct and
participatory consultation, “…to uplift themselves and thus become self-suffi-
cient and self-reliant.”9 “Progress in the development field will depend largely
on natural stirrings at the grass roots, and should receive its driving force from
those sources…,” and “all, irrespective of circumstances or resources, are en-
dowed with the capacity to respond in some measure to this challenge, for all
can participate in the joint enterprise of applying more systematically the prin-
ciples of the Faith to raising the quality of human life.”10

In a 1993 statement of the Office of Social and Economic Development
(OSED) approved by the Universal House of Justice, a number of concepts
were set forth, drawing on the previous decade’s experience. It stressed that
capacity-building and learning are the definition and goal of development:

> It has often been said that development is not a product to be delivered by the “devel-
> oped” to the “underdeveloped.” Rather, it is a process the main protagonists of which have
> to be the people themselves. The greatest concern of Bahá’í projects has to be the devel-
> opment of the friends’ capacity to make decisions about their spiritual and material progress
> and then to implement them. In an ideal project, while concrete action is directed to-
> wards visible improvement of some aspect of life, success is measured by the impact
> these actions have on the capacity of the community and its institutions to address devel-
> opment issues at increasingly higher levels of complexity and effectiveness… Approaches
> to development centered on the donation of goods and services, so characteristic of
> traditional religious charity and the programs of the welfare state, are known to have
> debilitating effects and often lead to paralysis.11
> …learning to apply the Teachings to achieve progress could be taken as the very definition
> of Bahá’í social and economic development.12

A further statement by the Bahá’í International Community relates this capac-
ity-building back to a vision of oneness and an ever-advancing civilization:

> The most important role that economic efforts must play in development lies, therefore,
> in equipping people and institutions with the means through which they can achieve the
> real purpose of development: that is, laying foundations for a new social order that can
> cultivate the limitless potentialities latent in human consciousness.13

On one level these statements appear to coincide with much of what is
being thought and written in the wider development field, but as we will see
there are quite challenging issues which relate to this focus on capacity-build-
ing.

The Emerging Consensus on Participation

In the face of disappointing results after decades of predominately top-
down and charity-based development, it has become a point of nearly universal
consensus among international organisations that people’s participation is es-
sential to development. This may be one of the only relatively unambiguous
lessons learned.

The international community can look back at a half-century of “develop-
ment” enterprise with mixed feelings, at best. Pessimism comes easily, as so-
lutions from the left are lacking legitimacy and promise, and welfare and
overseas development assistance commitments are hollowed out by Northern
governments’ need to reduce their deficits and respond to other imperatives.

The “New Policy Agenda” 14 of liberalisation and reduced government has often
failed to address the decline in economic growth in Africa and Latin America,
with negative effects on the poor.15 The World Bank itself, as a major propo-
nent of this agenda, has acknowledged that this restructuring does not lend
itself to clear, unambiguous solutions.16

Along with the discouraging trends, there has been a renewed global em-
phasis on poverty elimination, exemplified in the 1995 Copenhagen summit on
social development. Some of the ideas coming forward, echoing those of pre-
vious international task forces17 are for radical means to increase funds for
development and restructure the global order, such as a tax on global currency
transactions and more ambitious Third World debt relief. As important as re-
source transfer is, however, more charity is not the answer. The challenge needs
to be approached on a different order of magnitude, addressing the social,
economic and spiritual conditions which create and allow poverty to exist.

So what are the root causes of poverty? We have had a decades-long debate
over whether to blame poverty on structural inequality or Third World institu-
tional incapacity and corruption. 18 Many see empowerment as the fundamental
need, but Thomas 19 contrasts the views of Freire20 who saw empowerment in
terms of being conscientised to challenge existing power structures, and
Schumacher who focussed on deficiencies in education and technology and pre-
scribed self-help measures. Growing numbers believe that people must have
self-reliance and community solidarity - to be able to take local actions and to
influence policies and structural inequality.21 Thus, a practical approach to pov-
erty reduction recognises:
- Local initiative is still the foundation, whether or not outside funds materialise

> to support it: hundreds of thousands of grassroots organisations have formed
> by poor people to help themselves achieve what development assis-
> tance has failed to achieve;22
- Outside funds should serve to leverage internal resources to maximise impact:

> the gap between the supply and the need for development financing is
> so great that whatever external funds are available should be used as
> seeds which can lead to a sustainable harvest of internal capacities and
> resources;
- The benefit of development funds will be determined by the effectiveness of

> programmes and capabilities: without viable development programmes in
> place, which strengthen people’s capabilities, development funds gener-
> ally increase dependency, fail to achieve sustainable benefits and ulti-
> mately cause resentments and divisions;23

- Maximise self-reliance and good governance as a negotiating position: to ne-

> gotiate debt relief and a fairer global economy, Third World govern-
> ments can gain a strong moral and practical position if they can demonstrate
> a commitment to long-term national development, and popular participa-
> tion in transparent institutions. This was the case in the recent manage-
> ment of Uganda’s debt relief, involving a coalition of LNGOs, Novib,
> Oxfam, the World Bank, and the Government of Uganda.24
This raises a final conception of participation, which is that participation is a
process in which the development and exercise of people’s capabilities is both
the means and the end. A capability can be defined as “…a developed capacity
to think and to act in a well-defined sphere of activity and according to a well-
defined purpose.” 25 Important capabilities include the capability to look be-
neath the surface to understand social situations, to identify needs and potentials,
to initiate projects and sustain them to completion, to build environments of
unity based on an appreciation for diversity, and to understand and work with
one’s strengths and weaknesses. This conception fits well with current views
on the importance of capabilities in promoting household livelihood security,
exemplified in the following diagram by development guru Robert Chambers:

Human Nature and Participation

Of course, it would be of limited value to expect people to fulfill a re-
sponsibility to voluntary participation if they have little basic willingness to do
so even to a moderate extent. By definition, attempts to legislate or coerce
unpaid participation would be contrary to the ideal of volunteerism. This raises
the question of our assumptions about human nature, of people’s basic motives
for development. While it is beyond the scope of this paper to explore the
issue in depth, several observations can be made about the malleability and
unpredictability of human nature.

First, the Bahá’í principle on human nature, one which is probably intuitively
sensible to many people, is that all people have a dual nature, including a more
noble, community-minded aspect, as well as a more self-centred aspect. This
principle is critical in helping resolve what the Universal House of Justice
refers to as a “paralyzing contradiction” in which people proclaim their longing
for peace, harmony and progress, yet “…uncritical assent is given to the propo-
sition that human beings are incorrigibly selfish and aggressive and thus inca-
pable of erecting a social system at once progressive and peaceful, dynamic
and harmonious, a system giving free play to individual creativity and initiative
but based on co-operation and reciprocity.”26 Equally paralyzing, perhaps, may
be the assumption that the “poor” are somehow less capable of solidarity and
law-abiding behaviour than are the “rich” (however one might hazard to define
the two categories), as if material conditions of life dictate human behaviour.
From such an assumption one might conclude that the “poor” are helpless, and
that they must be provided with the means of existence and given a system to
live in which is constructed by the “rich” - who are often white and male, highly
educated, and particularly coming from or at least trained in “advanced” econo-
mies.

According to the Bahá’í view, people’s current behaviour may vary between
the noble and ignoble, but there is always the potential for them to learn that all
will benefit if we each become more cooperative and contribute towards pros-
perous communities and societies. The view is: I see oneself as part of one
human family—all have rights to the basic means of existence, I cannot be com-
fortable seeing others in abject poverty and am therefore drawn to work for
positive change, and I seek to develop myself so that I may contribute more
effectively to the development of all. By focusing more on this potential in
ourselves and others and striving towards it, we gradually reduce the presence
and influence of the less desirable traits, and bring out the real capabilities and
gifts in each individual. In particular, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá explained the importance of
religion and the influence of “True Educators,” or the Messengers of God:

> Man is said to be the greatest representative of God, he is the Book of Creation because
> all the mysteries of being exist in him. If he comes under the shadow of the True Educator
> and is rightly trained, he becomes… the center of the divine appearances, the source of
> spiritual qualities… If he is deprived of this education he becomes the manifestation of
> satanic qualities, the sum of animal vices…27

With respect to this view on human nobility, we should hasten to add that
what is not intended is the abnegation of the individual’s concern and responsi-
bility for self and family. It is highly praiseworthy for an individual to engage
in work to support one’s family. It would be unfair for one to judge others in
terms of how they allocate their time, especially when their conditions are
clearly very difficult and different from one’s own. But it is equally misleading
to think there is a tradeoff between individual livelihood and community
wellbeing—the two are intrinsically intertwined. What is intended is that we
recognize that we all have rights and responsibilities, and that we all partici-
pate in building a society in which they can be exercised. If we don’t build this
society, who will?

Second, people’s current willingness to participate without payment is partly
an empirical question, which can be guaged through observation and research in
a variety of social-economic-cultural contexts. One does not have to look far in
any country to find examples of people voluntarily participating, and PROS-
PECT provides many such examples. Estimates in Britain range from 20% to
almost 50% of the population taking part in at least one voluntary activity each
year.28

Third, given that volunteers do exist, by no means does there seem to be
any simple answer to the question of what motivates volunteers. In a review of
research publications on the motivation of volunteers Van Til29 summarizes
their findings in the following propositions:
- People volunteer for multiple reasons, among which are their own per-

sonal and social goals and needs
- The individual who volunteers typically does so only after weighing

alternatives in deliberate fashion
- The realm of voluntary action is complex and many-faceted, and differ-

ent organizational tasks appeal to different motivation forces
- Concern for others, while not always purely altruistic, remains an im-

portant motivating force for much voluntary action

- The motivation to give and to volunteer is shaped and constrained by

> broader social realities, and particularly by the omnipresent reality of
> world chaos and destruction
Smith30 finds a similar diversity of motivations, and also points out the cir-
cumstances leading to volunteering are important, that friends or relatives of-
ten recruit volunteers.

Fourth, clearly, people’s beliefs and images of the world and of social change
are very critical to shaping commitment and behaviour, and these images can
change. Boulding writes of people’s images of the world as conceptual frame-
works which guide thinking, and which are themselves influenced to varying
degrees by new information. The significance of the new information, how-
ever, is not intrinsic and universal but rather depends on how each individual
filters and interprets it—“the meaning of the message is the change which it
produces in the image.”31 Much debate about social change is in terms of di-
chotomies, such as dichotomous images of human nature (eg. altruistic vs. self-
serving, material vs. spiritual), or dichotomous images of how society is divided
and what a “good society” is (eg. urban vs. rural, capitalist vs. communist). While
these dichotomies are useful heuristic or learning devices, they should not be
treated as fixed realities.

An increasing stream of theoretical trichotomies posit three alternative
images of human beings and institutions, and people tend to reflect principally
one of these images, perhaps the same image they see in themselves. Chin and
Benne describe three types of change strategies.
- Empirical-rational—assumes people are rational, and will change if con-

sidered personally advantageous
- Power-coercive - change comes about only through compliance with au-

thorities or those in positions of power, through fear of threat
- Normative-reeducative - norms are the basis for behaviour, and change

is a reeducation process in which old norms are supplanted by new ones.32
Both the rational-empirical and power-coercive change strategies have their
place, but their materialistic image of human beings have often been imposed
by development agents in a way that doesn’t take account of the solidarity, hos-
pitality and reciprocity of other cultures. Development projects have tended to
convince grassroots people that their traditional modes of living, thinking and
doing are backwards, so “…the old convivial and familiar spaces which gave
the people life were, at best, reduced to ‘commercial centres’ where money
became the main instrument for social recognition and survival…”33 In addition
to being insensitive to culture, development has promoted productive eco-

nomic activities while undervaluing the “reproductive” activities - mainly of
women—which underpinned them, including building the unity of the family
and community. There is an increasing need for men to share these responsi-
bilities, and create institutions that respond to the needs of the human spirit. 34

Finally, there have been some good attempts to validate cultural, spiritual
images, such as the Four Worlds Development Project35 which developed a
curriculum and community development approach based on the guidance on
dozens of Native North American cultural elders. The Rural University in
Colombia, or FUNDAEC (Fundacion para la Aplicación y Ensenanza de las
Ciencias) places service to the community at the forefront of the rural wellbeing
training program in which tens of thousands of people throughout Latin America
are participating.36 The Orangi Pilot Project in Pakistan, one of the best known
urban development projects, draws specifically on a strong, spiritual tradition.
“The traditional principles of diligence, frugality, charity and modesty have
enabled Orangi people to build, without any subsidies, from their own savings,
their houses, their sanitation, their schools, their clinics, their transport.”37 Hope
and Timmel38 have provided a clear articulation of Christian and African com-
munity development and transformation, drawing on Freire’s critical aware-
ness, human relations training in group work, organisational development, social
analysis, and spiritual inspiration.

Establishing and Reflecting on The PROSPECT Policy On Participation,
Ownership & Community Service

If we are going to understand the duties of participation alongside the right
to development assistance, it is necessary to understand the manner in which
such a policy can be established. I now turn our attention to the way in which
this idea has been implemented and reflected on in PROSPECT.

In keeping with the evolutionary nature of the human rights discourse and
the learning approach of development projects explained above, the policy
sciences have been shifting from a rational, stage model of policy formulation
to an idea of policy cycles,39 competing paradigms and experiments in small
steps rather than through comprehensive, falsifiable theories.40 Similarly, de-
velopment projects have also tended to move away from a blueprint to an adap-
tive approach, with one model given as a series of successive stages:

Experimental        Pilot                Demonstration        Production

Figure 2 (Source: Cusworth, Franks (1995). Management of Development

Projects. London: Longman Scientific. After Rondinelli)

Much of what has been attempted in PROSPECT is explained in the ap-
proach known as Participatory Action Research (PAR—explained above), a learn-
ing approach developed by Freire, and popularised by writers such as Fals
Borda,41 and Rahman. 42 Its central concern is how the poor and oppressed can
transform their own environment by their own praxis (action-reflection).

In this context, following requests by residents for “incentives” to pay for
their participation, we engaged in research to explore the question: is the vol-
untary service and community participation policy appropriate? This is, in a sense,
a test of whether it was fair and realistic to expect that there would be a duty of
participation to match the right to development assistance, and an exploration
of how the balance would work.

The research was conducted in 1998, and augmented by observations and
reflections dating back over the four years prior to that. The research was
focussed around qualitative approaches and the PAR framework, and was con-
ducted by myself in conjunction with several Zambian colleagues. The main
methods used were focus group discussions and semi-structured interviews
with residents, meetings with and written feedback from PROSPECT and Council
staff, and unstructured interviews with CARE International officials. Participa-
tory research has numerous benefits, including avoiding the fallacy of com-
plete research objectivity, and the separation of thought and action that has
characterized much of social science.43 Nonetheless, my position as manager of
PROSPECT could affect my views and conclusions, and other staff or residents
could wish to take advantage of research to advance an interest, so the research
program was balanced to moderate these potential biases. The key to validity
was that we strived to be critically self-aware, and practice intersubjectivity,

dialogue among colleagues to test the ideas, systematically laying out and test-
ing the potential biases.

My general approach was to ask respondents what they understand the policy
and how it came about, how they have been affected by the content and process
of this policy, their opinion about its sustainability, what they think about mo-
tives, as well as the differential experiences and contributions of women and
the poor. Interviews were also held with a regular Zambia-based consultant to
CARE internationally, and with an internationally-recognized expert in urban
development.

Finally, a workshop was held with all PROSPECT staff, several City Coun-
cil staff, and two representatives from the community organizations in each of
our settlements, and it was facilitated by consultants. The workshop included
numerous small group sessions, including some stratified in terms of groups
such as residents, to encourage real opinions to come forward. This was the
workshop at which the policy was formally set out and adopted.

Research Results

CARE’s history had an important bearing on the evolution of the PROSPECT
policy. CARE International works in both relief and development, but gener-
ally when there is no national conflict or emergency, CARE seeks interven-
tions which have long-term developmental aims, not merely charity. CARE
Canada took the lead in establishing an office in Zambia in 1992 at the
government’s invitation, to help mitigate the effects of a national drought and
SAP. When the crisis faded, and recognising that PUSH activities were depen-
dent on continued food supplies, CARE Zambia sought to establish a more sus-
tainable urban project, in “PUSH II,” funded by the UK Overseas Development
Administration (now DFID) from 1994 to 1998. PUSH II aimed specifically to
overcome the reliance on food, to build sustainable development capacities
within the community, and thus in PUSH II and the subsequent PROSPECT poli-
cies, there was an avoidance of providing food as incentive.

In terms of appropriateness of the policy as viewed from an international
perspective, the experts interviewed and senior staff in CARE UK and CARE
Canada expressed strong support in the PROSPECT approach. They believed
that individuals have a core capacity of willingness to improve the community
which is important to nurture, although clearly most people have limitations in
their time available to contribute to wider development. So-called relief and
development incentives often do displace ownership and longer-term devel-
opment capabilities. Volunteerism weaves the social fabric of society, and

strengthens civil society. There were initially reservations expressed about
expecting “altruism” and generosity from the very poor. Then, examples would
be mentioned, of “absolute martyrs,” people like Anne Frank who—in the most
desperate conditions—are capable of nobility, or skipping some steps in
Maslow’s hierarchy. Uncertainty was expressed about whether such martyrs can
be cultivated, but it was felt that training would probably help to at least bring
some sense of community-mindedness.

When discussing the way in which volunteerism was practiced, it was re-
ported that residents’ contributions varied from a few hours a day for a week in
laying pipes, to large portions of days over a number of months, with clearly
larger burdens on the elected ABO members. The tangible contributions made
by residents are: labour, for example in laying pipes or helping dig bridge
foundations; management and leadership services, for example by ABO mem-
bers educating and supervising others; cash contributions, including water fees
and contributions for bridges. The expectation established between CARE and
the elected residents leaders, in the Chipata water project, was that residents
would work approximately four hours a day for five days of pipelaying and
water point construction, and that leaders might work one day per week. 70%
of the households did this, according to the Resident Development Committee’s
(RDC’s) records—while others reported spending six hours a day for almost
six months. In addition, several RDC members reported spending up to 12
hours daily for more than six months, although some of the staff questioned
these numbers.

In the Malota bridge project, residents determined their own contributions
spontaneously at the street level: some did the digging, others gathered water,
or cooked for those working, whilst others paid for the few skilled carpen-
ters. As one person commented: “We have no problem in working without pay,
and others working many days can get a payment.”

Our experience over several years, which was reinforced by the research,
finds a diversity of motivations among residents—common need, feeling of
ownership, hope for additional “incentives,” and respect - underpinned by a
tradition of strong mutual support between relations and friends. Perhaps it can
be summed up by saying that the main motivation for people to contribute their
time and labour, is mainly to address development needs—such as supply of
water—for themselves, their family and community. Most of the residents agreed
with the policy, especially women, and residents felt greater ownership for
development in their settlements, wanting to undertake further projects under
the same arrangements. Some RDC leaders and residents worked out of a sense
of service, addressing needs and feeling compelled to continue. At the same
time, some RDC members and general community members hoped for incen-

tives, and Chipata residents were actually promised incentives of free water
by their community leaders, which didn’t materialise. Gaining self-respect and
respect of others was another important motive.

Residents indicated that they are willing to work alongside their neighbours
in a collective effort to address strongly-felt needs which they have identified.
In the Chipata water project, people expressed appreciation at avoiding the
previous dangers of long trips at 4:00 am to obtain water, more than saving
money and time as PROSPECT’s research indicated. Beyond the general sense
of cooperative work, there is a distinctive form of service orientation in which
contribution is out of proportion with personal benefit. Respondents in Chipata
and George identified two ABO chairpersons, and many ABO members and
residents explain their motive as “ozi peleka” or “kuzi peleka,” having service at
heart. They explained that once they had started working for the community it
was hard to stop because people got to know and need you more. They said,
“those of us with a conscience would feel guilty to abandon such work.”

More widespread in the community is a sense of mutual support, taking in
relatives for weeks at a time, sharing food, or helping others in time of sick-
ness or death. In particular, women traditionally provide unpaid services to
family members and others, so they participate in water projects to reduce
personal risks, and save money and time previously expended on collection.
Still, many staff members felt that unlike the village setting, where kinship
bonds and strong capabilities for solidarity exist, this motive is weak in the
monetary economy of peri-urban areas.

An important issue was that of allocation of benefits from projects, such as
the Chipata water project. There was proportionately greater participation from
women and the poorest, and some uncertainty about the extent to which they
could access the benefits due to the cost of the water, a problem which is
currently being addressed. The well-off could afford to pay a participation fee,
or hire others to work for them, while men often didn’t volunteer as they were
busy working, which women seemed generally to accept.

The interventions, such as the water schemes, show signs of sustainability,
such as the RDCs’ independence vis à vis CARE and the Council. The scheme is
financially self-sustaining, and Chipata RDC has already passed through one
difficult transition of power. Residents shared that sense of ownership to a
slightly lesser degree, while in some cases it was overshadowed by having
been misled by the RDCs. RDC leaders have agreed that any incentives for
sustainability will have to be generated internally, negotiated through their
participatory decision-making processes, and will be performance-related.

The approach is showing a likelihood of developing capabilities to partici-
pate in governance in wider fora. The RDCs are increasingly seen as a legiti-
mate reference point and representative of the residents, and are invited to
help shape policy and plans of a number of government and international agen-
cies. They have confidence and capabilities to speak out on the basis of their
own real and sustained accomplishments, and the democratic institutions they
have behind them.

All factors considered, the content of the current policy can be concluded to
be basically appropriate, and there is nothing which needs to be removed or
fundamentally changed. This broad acceptance of the current policy was con-
firmed formally through a workshop in which ten RDC members and all PROS-
PECT staff participated, and in which as manager I was all but silent (not wanting
to inordinately influence the process, and reduce local staff’s ownership of the
process).

Equally important as a lesson to be learned from PROSPECT’s policy is the
process by which it came into being. The initial idea for the policy certainly
had much to do with international policy on community participation. The idea
of voluntary service was initially set out, and was gradually discussed and formed
the basis of a learning process. Diverse influences arose over the time period,
and some conflict surrounded the policy, until recently when it was repeatedly
placed on staff meeting agendas. Incremental adjustments have been made, until
demands and the opportunity of the new project created a launch window to
formalise the policy.

In learning about the policy, both staff and residents have changed and made
some compromises. We have realised the extent to which “incentives” rest on
having a sound overall approach to fostering community participation, owner-
ship and a spirit of service. Discretion and autonomy bring the needed flex-
ibility to innovate within the policy, such as seen with bridges and midden
boxes, but also confer a sense of responsibility. Culture turned out to be an
unknown and unexplored factor in determining individual and community re-
sponses to the policy.

Conclusions on Rights and Duties in Poverty Reduction Programs

People are often concerned that a rights-based approach to development
would become an exercise in handouts, which from a developmental point of
view would appear unsustainable and inappropriate. It seems justifiable, from
the perspective of the Bahá’í Teachings and from the standpoint of develop-
ment literature and practice, to expect that low-income “beneficiaries” of de-

velopment assistance could also be considered “participants.” The case study of
PROSPECT in peri-urban Zambia demonstrates how a policy establishing that
arrangement has come into being and how it has been accepted. This suggests
that it is reasonable to expect that in keeping with the right to support from the
international community for livelihood improvement and community develop-
ment, individuals would also have a duty to bear—not just to work to take care
of themselves individually, but to contribute to the development of society.
This makes sense not only as a safeguard to sustainably and greater practical
impact, but as an element of the dignity and spiritual growth of the individual.
Though at times there may be real constraints in time and physical capacity
which must be respected, all people should be encouraged to make some mod-
erate contribution to the development of themselves, their family and commu-
nity. While not placing excessive expectations on them, the materially
disadvantaged may surprise us both with how much spiritual and other resources
they have and how much development is really about using those resources
rather than providing financial and material resources. Clearly, such an approach
must be carefully and flexibly implemented with open consultation with all
concerned, with due regard to important varying factors such as emergency
conditions etc.

As was the case with the formulation of the policy in PROSPECT, the prin-
ciple of service to humanity is perhaps a laudable one but can not be legis-
lated—neither with those whose basic needs are met, much less with the very
disadvantaged. This is an important Bahá’í principle, of the voluntary adoption
of principles, and the loving acceptance of people irregardless of their re-
sponse to our suggestions. Wherever possible it is desirable to give people
the choice of whether they will actively pursue opportunities for community
service. In the current context of development assistance, however, with lim-
ited resources for development and a tremendous call on those resources by
those who have received no assistance as yet, it could be argued that the duty
for beneficiaries to contribute a reasonable amount to their own development
be considered a fixed requirement. In keeping with the trends of partnerships
between civil society, government and the private sector, it might be inter-
preted that holders of resources must negotiate on behalf of donors (share-
holders) to obtain the best deal possible in terms of reaching out to the maximum
number of beneficiaries.

Ultimately, however, our perspective shouldn’t be reduced to the handing
out of services and goods, and the learning and capacity-building of people and
communities are really the essence of development. This will undoubtedly
provide the main principle by which to guide and refine policies to balance
rights and responsibilities in development.
