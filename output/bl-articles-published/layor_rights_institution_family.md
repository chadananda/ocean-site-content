        BAHÁ’Í-INSPIRED PERSPECTIVES ON HUMAN RIGHTS

Bringing Rights Home

Bringing Rights Home: Human Rights and the

Institution of the Family

BY CHICHI LAYOR

Since the adoption of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (hereafter
Universal Declaration) by the United Nations General Assembly in 1948, hu-
man rights has come to be regarded as a subject of vital importance to society.
Over a hundred human rights documents or instruments, with varying legal sta-
tus, have been adopted at both the international and regional levels and ratified
by many states. The United Nations (UN) continues to play a major role in
promoting human rights, notably its machinery for monitoring and implement-
ing human rights and its sponsoring of various conferences on the subject. Aside
from the UN, many regional intergovernmental organizations, nongovernmen-
tal organizations (NGOs) and other organizations of civil society are actively
engaged in the arena of human rights.

Despite these commendable efforts, the human-rights discourse, as currently
posited, appears to be of little relevance to the family. Given that the majority
of activities undertaken in the name of human rights seem to be mainly high-
profile cases involving state violations of civil and political rights, it may be
concluded that the family has an insignificant role to play in the promotion and
protection of human rights. At present, human rights work would appear to be
the preserve of lawyers, governments, NGOs, human rights activists or the
UN. The current state of affairs is, however, unacceptable: respect for human
rights must begin within the family. If human rights are “literally the rights one
has simply because one is a human being”1, and if these rights are often violated
by individuals even when they are acting in an official capacity, then individual
behavior must be linked with respect for human rights. Human behavior is
largely based on knowledge, attitudes and beliefs, many of which are acquired
and played out within the family. Regardless of the position one might take in
the “nature versus nurture” debate, it would be difficult to deny that the family
is, in the words of the Universal Declaration, “the natural and fundamental group
unit of society.”2

Bringing Rights Home

The purpose of this article is to analyze, from a Bahá’í perspective, the role
of family rights in the contemporary human rights discourse. First, the rationale
for stressing family rights will be explained and human rights provisions relat-
ing to the family will be examined. Next, Bahá’í principles relating to family
rights will be discussed along with relevant provisions in human rights instru-
ments. Finally, it will be considered whether protecting family rights can help
to foster a human rights culture and thus accelerate “the advent of a world in
which human beings shall enjoy freedom of speech and belief and freedom
from fear and want” which is “the highest aspiration of the common people.”3

Definitions

It would be helpful to provide at the outset some definitions that are rel-
evant to the subject under discussion. Although these definitions may be con-
tested, they are considered valid for the purposes of this article. First, what is
meant by the term “human rights”? As mentioned earlier, these are rights that
human beings have simply because they are human. “Positive rights” arise from
the enactment of laws whereas human rights are essentially moral rights that
may or may not have legal backing. Human rights are God-given and not be-
stowed on us by the state although the state may take steps to promote and
protect the rights of its inhabitants. According to the human rights theorist Jack
Donnelly, “…a principal function of human rights is to shape social relations.”4
This point is affirmed by ‘Abdu’l-Bahá in a statement that also underscores the
non-absolute nature of rights and humanity’s need for “the moderate freedom
which guarantees the welfare of the world of mankind and maintains and pre-
serves the universal relationships.” 5 Clearly, then, human rights are not merely
a collection of grandiose and impracticable principles that happen to be cur-
rently fashionable in certain circles. Rather, to be worthy of the term, human
rights must, of necessity, impact on morality as well as on legal and political
practices.

The second term to be defined is “family rights.” On the one hand, they are
the rights of the individuals within a family: thus for example, the rights of the
wife, husband or child.6 On the other hand, the family can be considered to
have certain rights as a group, as for instance, when the Universal Declaration
of Human Rights stipulates that a family is entitled to protection by society and
the State.7 The question of what is meant by protection will be considered
later.

Bringing Rights Home

The Nexus Between the Family and Human Rights

Keeping in mind the aforementioned definitions, we will now explore the
correlation between the family and the promotion and protection of human
rights. A number of points can be made in this regard. To begin with, it is
necessary to refer to the function of human rights mentioned earlier, namely, to
guarantee the welfare of humankind and preserve social relationships. As one’s
first and most important relationships are often those established within the
family, it is in this environment that the awareness, promotion and protection of
human rights must begin. The possession of moral virtues, such as courtesy,
honesty and trustworthiness, is conducive to respect for the rights of others, for
human rights are often violated by individuals even when they are acting in an
official capacity. Knowledge of human rights law is not sufficient in itself but
must be buttressed by the possession of moral attributes that are more easily
acquired within the family environment.. A statement by the Bahá’í International
Community highlights the importance of beginning human rights-inspired edu-
cation in early childhood “because an individual’s fundamental moral frame-
work is formed at a very young age.”8

A focus on family rights is also important because the family can be consid-
ered a microcosm of human society. The family is, as stated in the Universal
Declaration of Human Rights, “the natural and fundamental group unit of soci-
ety” and the attitudes and practices of individuals within the family are often
carried into other relationships outside the home. The commencement of hu-
man rights promotion in the home is imperative, for individuals who do not
respect the rights of family members are unlikely to respect the rights of oth-
ers in the wider society. For this reason, family rights should be considered
within the broader context of the human family, as the following statement
from ‘Abdu’l-Bahá makes clear:

> Compare the nations of the world to the members of a family. A family is a nation in
> miniature. Simply enlarge the circle of the household and you have the nation. Enlarge the
> circle of nations and you have all humanity. The conditions surrounding the family surround
> the nation. The happenings in the family are the happenings in the life of the nation. Would
> it add to the progress and advancement of a family if dissension should arise among its
> members, fighting, pillaging each other, jealous and revengeful of injury, seeking selfish
> advantage? Nay, this would be the cause of the effacement of progress and advancement.

So it is in the great family of nations, for nations are but an aggregate of families.9

Bringing Rights Home

Human Rights Provisions Relating to the Family

At first glance, it would appear that the seminal international human rights
document recognizes the cardinal role of the family in the promotion of human
rights. The Universal Declaration of Human Rights states that “[t]he family is
the natural and fundamental group unit of society and is entitled to protection
by society and the State.”10 An identical provision is also found in the Interna-
tional Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (hereafter ICCPR).11 A number of
other international human rights documents contain articles detailing the right
to formation and protection of families, such as the provisions stipulating
women’s right to access to information “to help ensure the health and well-
being of families”12, and women’s right to special protection during pregnancy.13

In addition, the Convention on the Rights of the Child contains several pro-
visions intended to protect the best interests of the child, including articles
stipulating that states “shall ensure to the maximum extent possible the survival
and development of the child.”14 A similar article is found in the ICCPR. 15 Other
treaties relating to family rights include the Convention on Consent to Mar-
riage, Minimum Age for Marriage and Registration of Marriages, 1962.

As regards regional human rights documents, the African Charter on Human
and Peoples’ Rights (hereafter African Charter) includes a similar article to that
contained in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. The family being, in
the words of the African Charter, “the natural unit and basis of society,” 16 is
entitled to protection by the state, which “shall take care of its physical and
moral health.”17 This treaty is unique in its mention of the family’s role in main-
taining moral standards: it stipulates that the state has the duty “to assist the
family which is the custodian of morals and traditional values.”18

A common thread running through the aforementioned provisions is the ap-
parent emphasis on the duty of the state to protect the family; note that the role
of society is barely addressed. It will be recalled that the family’s entitlement
to protection by society as well as the state is mentioned in the Universal
Declaration of Human Rights. It is not, however, clear what precisely is meant
by “protection by society and the state,” to which the family is entitled. The
above-mentioned document states that women and men “are entitled to equal
rights as to marriage, during marriage and at its dissolution.”19 Ensuring that men
and women have equal rights during marriage can be regarded as protecting the
family; a corollary of this provision might be to state that only families in which
men and women have equal rights are entitled to protection by society and the
state. Strangely, however, international and regional human-rights provisions
relating to the family fail to mention the role of family members themselves in
protecting the family and do not address directly the rights and responsibili-

ties of individuals within the home. This omission constitutes a great defi-
ciency in the majority of human rights documents.

Concerning protection of the family by the state, as mentioned in the Uni-
versal Declaration, the question may also arise as to whether such protection is
a right to which all families are entitled, including, for example, those in which
physical or emotional abuse is present. Admittedly, there is a danger that the
family’s right to “protection by the state” could be narrowly construed as pres-
ervation of a family in which the rights of some members are violated. Reluc-
tant to infringe on this family’s alleged right to privacy, the state may, citing the
aforementioned right to protection, decline to intervene in the affairs of a
family in which abuse is present. Clearly, the substantive content of the right to
protection of the family needs to be established. As will be shown in the next
section, the Bahá’í Teachings can offer some elucidation in this area of human
rights.

Bahá’í Principles Relating to Family Rights
The Oneness of Mankind

A fundamental principle of the Bahá’í Faith, which is applicable to family
life, is the oneness of mankind. The correlation between this principle and the
establishment of a just society in which everyone’s rights are respected is ex-
plained in the following statement from ‘Abdu’l-Bahá:

> The second attribute of perfection is justice and impartiality… It means to consider the
> welfare of the community as one’s own. It means, in brief, to regard humanity as a single
> individual, and one’s own self as a member of that corporeal form, and to know of a
> certainty that if pain or injury afflicts any members of that body, it must inevitably result in
> suffering for all the rest.20

Seen in this perspective, in order for justice to prevail within the family,
every member would have to protect the rights of other members. But the
family is also to be viewed in a wider context as the human family whose unity
can be best achieved when every member of society protects the rights of
others. The reason for taking such a broad view of the family is that humanity is
not composed of self-contained families living in isolation; rather, individual
families are all part of an interrelated, interdependent and indivisible human-
ity. If, therefore, it is accepted that all human rights are interrelated, interde-
pendent and indivisible, as laid down in the Vienna Declaration and Programme
of Action (1993), and if human rights are rights that one has because one is a

human being, then humanity itself must be indivisible. The principle of the
oneness of mankind would, if applied to relations within as well as outside the
family, conduce to the “promotion of universal respect for and observation of
human rights and fundamental freedoms.”21

Family Unity

One of the fundamental principles of the Bahá’í Faith is the unity of human-
kind: “no power can exist except through unity,” 22 Bahá’u’lláh has declared. Fur-
thermore, “harmony, unity and love are held up as the highest ideals in human
relationships,” 23 and the Bahá’í Writings underscore the importance of family
unity in helping to usher in a just and unified world. Thus, for example, the
supreme administrative body of the Bahá’í Faith, the Universal House of Jus-
tice, has written, “Bahá’u’lláh came to bring unity to the world, and a fundamental
unity is that of the family.”24 He has also stated, as Shoghi Effendi has affirmed,
that “the purpose of marriage is to promote unity.”25 Therefore, the existence
of love and unity in any family is necessary for its progress whereas the “ill
effects of discord are so clearly apparent.”26 The correlation between family
unity and progress is also highlighted in this statement by ‘Abdu’l-Bahá: “If love
and agreement are manifest in a single family, that family will advance, become
illumined and spiritual; but if enmity and hatred exist within it, destruction and
dispersion are inevitable.” 27

If we accept the premise that the human family is composed of several in-
terdependent and interrelated families, then it follows that the conditions, of
harmony or disharmony within each family, can affect, and in turn be affected
by, conditions in the wider society. Similarly, if unity is conducive to progress
both of the individual family and the human family, and human rights are in-
tended to advance and not retard human development, then the individual has a
responsibility to create unity within his or her family.

Gender Equality

The principle of gender equality is an integral aspect of any discussion
regarding the relationship between men and women in the home. Although
husbands and wives have many responsibilities as well as rights, due to space
constraints, only a few will be examined here. The equality of women and men,
within the family and in the wider society, was explicitly proclaimed by
Bahá’u’lláh over 150 years ago and is repeatedly enunciated in the Bahá’í Writ-
ings. In fact, equality of the sexes is so crucial to the advancement of society that
‘Abdu’l-Bahá has declared that “[a]s long as women are prevented from attaining
their highest possibilities, so long will men be unable to achieve the greatness
which might be theirs.”28 It is now generally accepted in human rights discourse,

at least in principle, that denial of equality to women constitutes a human rights
violation. The unequal status of women in present-day society is highlighted in
the following statement by the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cul-
tural Organization (UNESCO):

> Of all the violations of human rights, the most systematic, widespread and entrenched is
> the denial of equality to women. Despite some progress in recent years, there is no
> country in the world where women have achieved full equality. Although making up half or
> more than half of the population, they are treated as a minority group, disadvantaged and
> powerless.29

The above summation of the current global status of women is consistent
with the Bahá’í perspective, inasmuch as ‘Abdu’l-Bahá has stated, “the female
sex is treated as though inferior, and is not allowed equal rights and privi-
leges.” 30 Such a situation is, however, untenable in the Bahá’í view for “divine
justice demands that the rights of both sexes should be equally respected.”31 It
is worth noting that the principle of equality applies to all social relationships
between men and women including, but not limited to, marriage. “According to
the spirit of this age,” ‘Abdu’l-Bahá has affirmed, “women must advance and
fulfill their mission in all departments of life, becoming equal to men.”32 To
demonstrate how the principle of equality might be applied to conjugal rela-
tions, some rights and responsibilities of women and men within the home
will now be considered.

Rights and Responsibilities of Family Members

It is evident from the Bahá’í Writings that rights and responsibilities are
inextricably linked and this correlation is a feature of family relations. Accord-
ing to the Universal House of Justice, “[t]he members of a family all have du-
ties and responsibilities towards one another and to the family as a whole, and
these duties and responsibilities vary from member to member because of
their natural relationships.”33 The rights and responsibilities of the husband,
wife and children will be discussed under three categories: rights of spouses,
rights of children and rights of parents.

Rights of Spouses
Freedom of Religion

Given that the relationship between husband and wife should be one of
equality, each spouse is entitled to choose his or her own religion indepen-

dently of the other for Shoghi Effendi, the Guardian of the Bahá’í Faith, has
stated that “[no]body should trespass on the sacred bond every human being has
a right to have with their Creator.”34 It will be recalled that the right to freedom
of “thought, conscience and religion” is also enshrined in the Universal Decla-
ration of Human Rights.35 Freedom of religion is a fundamental right that should
be respected both in the context of family life and within society as a whole;
regrettably, however, many individuals have attempted to influence forcibly
the faith of other family members. In the event that a husband or wife seeks to
interfere with his or her spouse’s right to a religious affiliation, the one whose
right is thus challenged is advised, in the Bahá’í Writings, to use “conciliatory
and friendly means”36 to endeavor to win the other person’s sympathy. The
objective here is to preserve the unity of the family without ceding one’s fun-
damental right to freedom of religion.

Freedom of Opinion and Expression

Freedom of expression is, according to the Universal House of Justice, “a
fundamental principle”37 of the Bahá’í Cause. From this statement, and in light of
the Bahá’í principle of gender equality, it would be reasonable to conclude that
women and men in the family have the right to freedom of opinion and expres-
sion. But there is another argument in this connection. The principle of consul-
tation is a worthwhile method of seeking solutions, which is stressed by
Bahá’u’lláh; this principle applies to all human relationships and is so important
that “no welfare and no well-being can be attained except through consulta-
tion.”38 Indeed, Bahá’ís are urged to take no important step in their personal
affairs without prior consultation. When applied to the family context, the prin-
ciple of consultation allows for every member of the family to express “with
absolute freedom” 39 their own opinion and set forth their own argument “for
not until matters are fully discussed can the right way be revealed.”40 Although
this injunction was given by ‘Abdu’l-Bahá to the Bahá’í administrative institu-
tions, the Universal House of Justice has stated that consultation should not be
confined to the administrative institutions but should also be used within the
family.41 Therefore, both husband and wife have the right to hold and express
their opinions. Nevertheless, it is appropriate to note that, as is the case with
the majority of the rights enshrined in documents such as the International Bill
of Human Rights, there are conditions attached to the exercise of this right, in
the Bahá’í view.

For instance, although both spouses are entitled to express their opinions
during consultation, they should also “behave in the utmost love, harmony and
sincerity towards each other.”42 Mindful of the fact that the purpose of marriage
is to promote unity,43 and in view of Bahá’u’lláh’s teachings prohibiting unseemly

talk and unkind words, the right to freedom of opinion and expression must
only be exercised within marriage “in such wise that no occasion for ill-feel-
ing or discord may arise.” 44 Again, while it has recommended the use of “full
and frank discussion” by spouses as “a panacea for domestic conflict,” the Uni-
versal House of Justice has also stressed that family consultation must be “ani-
mated by awareness of the need for moderation and balance.”45

However loving the consultation between spouses, there may be situations
where the wife and the husband cannot reach agreement. In such cases, how
should both parties’ rights to freedom of opinion and expression be recon-
ciled? Since there can be no majority vote in this situation, the Universal House
of Justice has stated that there are “times when a wife should defer to her
husband, and times when a husband should defer to his wife, but neither should
ever unjustly dominate the other.”46

Other Spousal Rights

The right to be free from abuse is enshrined in the Bahá’í Writings. The
Universal House of Justice has stated, “no husband should subject his wife to
abuse of any kind, whether emotional, mental or physical.”47 This injunction
should also be read mutatis mutandis, given the mutual respect and equality that
should govern relationships in the home. Interestingly, it would appear that
Bahá’u’lláh has assigned to men a special responsibility for ensuring that women
are not subjected to cruel behavior, as evidenced by the following statement:

> The friends of God must be adorned with the ornament of justice, equity, kindness and
> love. As they do not allow themselves to be the object of cruelty and transgression, in like
> manner they should not allow such tyranny to visit the handmaidens of God.48

Rights of Children

In the Bahá’í view, children have a right to be educated by their parents, for
whom such education is “an inescapable duty”49. As the mother is the first edu-
cator and mentor of the child as well as the predominant influence in the child’s
early life, Bahá’u’lláh has stressed that where it is not possible to educate all of
one’s children, daughters have a prior right to education over sons. It is impor-
tant to note that education, in the Bahá’í view, encompasses both material and
spiritual components. As repeatedly stressed in the Bahá’í Writings, the task of
bringing up a child is “the chief responsibility of the mother” and in order to

discharge this vital duty, the mother is entitled to be financially supported by
her husband. Nevertheless, as the Universal House of Justice has pointed out,
“the father also has the responsibility of educating his children, and this re-
sponsibility is so weighty that Bahá’u’lláh has stated that a father who fails to
exercise it forfeits his rights of fatherhood.” 50

The foregoing should not, however, be construed as justification for an in-
flexible division of gender roles. On the contrary, such a reading would be
incorrect, as the Universal House of Justice has explained. The statement re-
garding the separate roles of mothers and fathers in no way implies that their
functions are “inflexibly fixed and cannot be changed and adjusted to suit par-
ticular family situations.”51 Rather, the Bahá’í Writings state explicitly that women
cannot be confined to the home but may be breadwinners.

In addition, children have a right, in the Bahá’í view, to be treated with
dignity. This principle does not, however, mean that they should not be sub-
jected to discipline; on the contrary, as the Guardian of the Bahá’í Faith has
stated, discipline is “indeed indispensable.” 52 Hence, parents are urged to coun-
sel and punish their children by using means based on reason but, as ‘Abdu’l-
Bahá has stated, “[i]t is not permissible to strike a child, or vilify him, for the
child’s character will be totally perverted if he be subjected to blows or verbal
abuse.”53

Another right accorded to children in the Bahá’í Writings is the right to
choose their own religion from the age of fifteen. 54 Up until this age, children
may be obliged to share the religious affiliations of their parents. But, as Shoghi
Effendi has stated, once children have reached the age of fifteen, they should
be given full freedom to choose their religion, “irrespective of the wishes and
desires of their parents.” 55

Parental Rights

Since there can be no rights without responsibilities, children have certain
sacred duties toward their parents. One such obligation is that of obedience to
one’s parents—parents do not have to obey their children, in the Bahá’í view.
Great respect is due to one’s parents and Bahá’u’lláh has stated that, after the
recognition of the oneness of God, “the most important of all duties is to have
due regard for the rights of one’s parents.”56 He has also warned against the
commission of acts that would “sadden the hearts”57 of one’s parents; hence,
children have the responsibility to strive for the contentment of their parents.
To enable the fulfillment of this obligation, Bahá’u’lláh has enjoined parents to
“rear their children to be staunch in faith” since “a child who removeth himself

from the religion of God will not act in such a way as to win the good pleasure
of his parents and his Lord.”58

Children also have the responsibility, as is evident from the Bahá’í Writ-
ings, “to exert themselves to the utmost in acquiring the art of reading and
writing.”59 Hence, the right of children to be educated by their parents is closely
linked with the children’s duty to study assiduously “those branches of knowl-
edge which are of use.”60

Responsibilities of Individual Members to the Family Unit

It is evident from the foregoing that in addition to having rights and respon-
sibilities towards one another, the members of a family also have responsibili-
ties to the family unit. Individual family members have the duty to exercise
their rights in a manner that will be conducive to harmony, concord and unity in
the family, inasmuch as discord and dissension hinders the progress of a family
and, by extension, that of society as a whole. Since an environment of peace and
unity is necessary for the effective protection of human rights, the members of
a family have the duty to acquire moral virtues that will assist them to preserve
the unity of the family. The following statement by ‘Abdu’l-Bahá highlights the
importance of balancing individual rights and responsibilities against those of
the collective unit:

> According to the teachings of Bahá’u’lláh the family, being a human unit, must be educated
> according to the rules of sanctity. All the virtues must be taught the family. The integrity of
> the family bond must be constantly considered, and the rights of the individual members
> must not be transgressed. The rights of the son, the father, the mother—none of them must
> be transgressed, none of them must be arbitrary. Just as the son has certain obligations to
> his father, the father, likewise, has certain obligations to his son. The mother, the sister and
> other members of the household have their certain prerogatives. All these rights and
> prerogatives must be conserved, yet the unity of the family must be sustained. The injury
> of one shall be considered the injury of all; the comfort of each, the comfort of all; the
> honor of one, the honor of all.61

Conceptions of Family Rights: Contemporary and Bahá’í Views

A few similarities exist between the contemporary conception of family
rights and the Bahá’í perspective. First, as was previously mentioned, the fam-
ily is regarded as a fundamental unit of society both in the principal human

rights documents and in the Bahá’í Writings. Furthermore, in many human rights
documents and the Bahá’í Writings, it is acknowledged that women and men
have equal rights and that these rights should be equally respected. In addition,
the rights of children are considered important in the Bahá’í perspective and in
human rights treaties.

The differences between both conceptions are, however, striking. In the
first instance, human rights documents merely acknowledge, but do not elabo-
rate on, the fundamental nature of the family unit. The Bahá’í Writings, in con-
trast, explicate the interrelationship between the family and humanity as a whole
and this nexus underpins the Bahá’í conception of human rights.

Furthermore, as regards the recognition of women’s rights to equality and
the rights of the child in contemporary human rights discourse, this is markedly
different from the Bahá’í conception. The vast majority of human rights instru-
ments tend to stress the rights of the individual while down playing the re-
sponsibilities that come with the exercise of such rights. For instance, the “right
to marry and to found a family”62 is proclaimed in the International Bill of
Human Rights but there is no mention, in that document or any other, of the
responsibilities of the parties to the marriage. An exceptional human rights
treaty is the African Charter on Human and Peoples’ Rights as it also includes a
section on duties, stipulating for example, that the individual has the duty to
respect his or her parents at all times.63 In contrast to the dissociation of rights
from responsibilities in most human rights documents relating to the family,
recognition of an indissoluble link between rights and responsibilities of fam-
ily members is integral to the Bahá’í perspective of family rights.

The Bahá’í view also differs from current conceptions of family rights in
another respect. There is a tendency, in contemporary human rights discourse,
to view family rights as a collection of discrete rights belonging to atomistic
individuals who have few responsibilities towards anyone other than them-
selves. On this view, every member of the family (mother, father or child)
would have innumerable rights which are held against other family members,
yet little thought is given to family relationships and how they might be influ-
enced by the exercise of individual members’ rights. The Bahá’í Writings, in
contrast, stress the correlation between rights and responsibilities in the fam-
ily and enumerate the rights and responsibilities of each member. Moreover,
in the Bahá’í view, “the integrity of the family must be constantly considered”64
inasmuch as “harmony, unity and love are held up as the highest ideals in human
relationships.”65 Of course, this insistence on family unity should not be con-
strued as a negation of the rights of individual members, since the Bahá’í Writ-
ings make it clear that the rights and prerogatives of every family member must
be sustained.

Reconceptualizing Human Rights to Protect the Family

As earlier mentioned, a number of human rights documents state that the
family is the fundamental group unit of society and is entitled to protection by
the state and society. But how does the state and society protect the family? This
question remains largely unanswered in most human rights documents; in fact, it
would appear that the family has been relegated to the background in contem-
porary human rights discourse.

The effective protection of the family—ensuring the proper exercise of
rights and discharge of responsibilities within the unit—necessitates a funda-
mental transformation in the current conceptual framework of human rights. It
should be noted that this article does not purport to enumerate all of the con-
ceptual innovations that would be required: only a few of these will be dis-
cussed. Our understanding of human rights is far from perfect and will continue
to evolve, and the role of all sectors of society in broadening and deepening
the human rights discourse cannot be overemphasized. A few changes in current
conceptions are here proposed.

Legal and State-centrist Approaches

Inimical to the protection of the family is the predominant perception of
human rights as a relentless struggle between the individual and the state whose
actions must be restrained by the enactment and implementation of suitable
laws. Within the current state-centered paradigm of human rights, the family,
composed as it is of “ordinary” individuals interacting with one another, is
considered largely irrelevant in the vast scheme of things. The adversarial and
legalistic approach to human rights is also unlikely to conduce to protection of
the family since, according to this school of thought, individuals are pitted against
each other or against the state in a fierce struggle to assert their rights. When
the individual members of a family all claim rights held against each other and
invoke human rights legal principles in a court of law, without seriously con-
sidering their responsibilities towards each other, such actions threaten family
unity. Rather than foster an atmosphere in which family members respect and
protect each other’s rights, the adversarial paradigm is likely to encourage dis-
sension and disharmony within the family.

Human Rights Education

The vital role of education in the effective promotion and protection of
human rights is explicitly acknowledged in the Universal Declaration. In this
document, the United Nations General Assembly has proclaimed, “every indi-
vidual and every organ of society, keeping this Declaration constantly in mind,
shall strive by teaching and education to promote respect for these rights and
freedoms.” 66 The importance of education in the promotion of human rights
was further underscored when the General Assembly, in its resolution of 23
December 1994, proclaimed a United Nations Decade for Human Rights Edu-
cation (1995-2004).

In the Bahá’í view, human rights education is not merely a theoretical knowl-
edge of laws and institutional mechanisms for implementing human rights. It is
essential that a moral component be incorporated into human rights education
thus linking respect for rights with human virtues such as compassion, justice,
truthfulness and courtesy. For, even more important than familiarity with the
principles of international human rights law in determining one’s respect for
others’ rights, is the possession of moral qualities. These qualities constitute,
essentially, a strong motivational force in human behavior. But stressing the
importance of moral education does not mean that the force of law must not be
respected; rather, the intention here is to advocate for a holistic and less mate-
rialistic view of human rights. This important subject encompasses fields other
than the law, such as political science, philosophy, and medical ethics. The ab-
stract notion of rights proclaimed in countless international and regional docu-
ments—and here one is reminded of Jeremy Bentham’s dismissal of rights as
“rhetorical nonsense” or “nonsense on stilts”—will not be translated into real-
ity unless and until a deeper understanding of human rights pervades every
sector of humanity.

Materialistic Foundations

A review of past and contemporary texts on the subject reveals that the
foundations of human rights have always been, and continue to be, disputed.
Theories of rights abound in the literature and myriad arguments have been
advanced in support of various schools of thought. These often-conflicting theo-
ries will not be enumerated or analyzed here. The point of this section is to
propose that essential religious truths, but not sectarian dogmas, be re-incor-
porated into the rights discourse in order to establish human rights on a solid
and transcendent foundation and ensure a truly universal culture of human rights.

The contemporary human rights movement is undeniably rooted in liberal
Western thought which can be traced back to the seventeenth century. In the
early stages of its development, human rights or “natural rights,” as the concept
was then known, were regarded as rights given to humankind by God and the
spiritual nature of human beings was not denied. Subsequently, however, the
human rights movement moved gradually away from its religious associations
and adopted an increasingly materialistic approach. Starting with the adoption
of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights in 1948, any explicit mention of
God was effectively erased from the human rights discourse. Thus, many human
rights documents proclaim lofty principles67 that are clearly grounded in secu-
lar and strongly contested values.

The disconnection of human rights from religion has resulted in an overem-
phasis on the adoption of materialistic measures to promote and protect human
rights. Hence, an inordinate amount of time and effort is devoted to formulat-
ing and promulgating treaties and declarations, enacting laws, naming and sham-
ing governments that violate the rights of their citizens, and devising a variety
of human rights machinery. Short shrift has been given to the role of religion in
instilling the requisite moral values in human beings, values that alone can mo-
tivate the individual to protect the rights of others. For religion, Bahá’u’lláh has
declared, is “the chief instrument for order in the world and of tranquillity
among its peoples.”68 In a similar vein, it is clear from the Bahá’í Writings that
human rights are bestowed on humankind by God and not by the state. The
importance of recognizing the divine source of human rights and the limitations
of even the most powerful states in protecting human rights is acknowledged in
the following excerpt from A Bahá’í Declaration of Human Rights and Obliga-
tions:

> “The source of human rights is the endowment of qualities, virtues and powers which God
> has bestowed upon mankind without discrimination of sex, race, creed or nation. To fulfill
> the possibilities of this divine endowment is the purpose of human existence.…
> “The social body does not create essential human rights. Its office is that of trustee under
> appointment to act for the community in the preservation of the relationships which
> represent the moral achievement of the members, and to cherish and protect that unity of
> spirit which is their highest mutual obligation.
> No social body, whatever its form, has power to maintain essential human rights for
> persons who have repudiated their moral obligation and abandoned the divine endow-
> ment distinguishing man from beast.…
> “An ordered society can only be maintained by moral beings.” 69

Conclusion

The international human rights movement has undoubtedly made great strides
since its early origins in Western liberal thought. Thus, for example, the insti-
tution of slavery, which was considered acceptable in past centuries, is today
regarded as a violation of human rights and a major document announces that
“[a]ll human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights.”7 0 Notwith-
standing the incontrovertible achievements of the human rights movement, ex-
emplified by the promulgation of various documents, and the formulation of a
variety of monitoring and implementation mechanisms, the human rights dis-
course appears to be stuck in an adversarial and state-centered paradigm in
which the individual is pitted against the state. This narrow and obsolescent
conception of human rights is manifestly inadequate. Today, human-rights dis-
course needs to evolve beyond its Western liberal origins to include an aware-
ness of the oneness of humankind, recognition of the importance of moral
education and the role of the family in the promotion and protection of human
rights. It is not sufficient to promulgate detailed and authoritative statements of
rights, invoke these rights in cases before national and international courts, or
discuss human rights issues in high-profile international fora.

Urgently needed is for universal human rights to be actualized, in order that
they may truly be a “common standard of achievement for all peoples and all
nations,” as the Universal Declaration of Human Rights purports to be. To this
end, the field of human rights must no longer be considered the preserve of
lawyers, politicians, academics, nongovernmental organizations or high-pro-
file political dissidents; rather, human-rights protection must begin within the
family unit. A focus on the rights and responsibilities of the family is an integral
component of human rights protection. Due recognition ought to be given to the
family for its potential to foster an environment in which values favorable to
human rights can be inculcated and applied. For in the final analysis, to foster a
truly universal human rights culture in the world, human rights must be brought
home to the family.
