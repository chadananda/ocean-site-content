           Natural Stirrings at the Grassroots:
Development, Doctrine, and the Dignity Principle*

Anna C. Vakil
Abstract
Grassroots-led initiatives are the centerpiece of development efforts in the global
Bahá’í community as well as those of other practitioners. This paper provides an
overview of modernization, Marxian, and civil society paradigms and how these
frameworks explain “stirrings at the grassroots.” A new approach, development
with dignity, is presented, supported by principles evident in the Sacred Writings
of the Bahá’í Faith and other religions, as well as recent research in a number
of disciplines. The paper concludes with historical lessons from the three main
paradigms and the experience of the Bahá’í community, and suggestions for
further investigation of the “dignity principle.”

Résumé
Dans la communauté internationale bahá’íe, tout comme dans d’autres
organisations, les initiatives venant de la base sont la pierre angulaire des
efforts de développement. L’article brosse un tableau des paradigmes du
modernisme, du marxisme et de la société civile, et explique comment ces
écoles de pensée interprètent les « manifestations spontanées de la base ». Une
nouvelle approche, le développement dans la dignité, est présentée, laquelle se
fonde à la fois sur des principes énoncés dans les Écrits sacrés de la foi bahá’íe
et ceux d’autres religions, et sur des études récentes menées dans diverses
disciplines. Enfin, l’article présente les leçons historiques à tirer des trois
grands paradigmes examinés, montre l’expérience de la communauté bahá’íe à
cet égard et suggère des pistes pour approfondir la recherche sur le « principe
de dignité ».

Resumen
Las iniciativas fundamentadas a nivel de comunidad son el enfoque de los
esfuerzos del desarrollo en la comunidad bahá’í global al igual que las de otros
ejercitantes. Este artículo provee una visión general de los paradigmas tanto
modernista, Marxista como de sociedad civil, y examina cómo estas estructuras
explican las “movimientos a nivel de comunidad.” Se presenta una nueva
aproximación, el desarrollo con dignidad, respaldada por los principios

Introduction
In 1983, the Universal House of Justice, the internationally elected
administrative body of the global Bahá’í community, offered the following
guidance to the Bahá’í world on social and economic development activities
initiated by the Bahá’í community: “Progress in the development field will
largely depend on natural stirrings at the grassroots, and it should receive its
driving force from those sources rather than from an imposition of plans and
programs from the top” (Messages 379.6).

The importance of this principle has been reiterated in subsequent statements
issued from the Bahá’í World Centre: “. . . grassroots action must begin simply
and in a way that can be managed by the community itself” (Bahá’í Social);
“Bahá’í social and economic development focuses on increasing the capacity of
the friends to make decisions about the spiritual and material progress of their
communities and then implement them” (Evolution).

Although the present focus on development within local communities has
tremendous implications for how the Bahá’í world approaches the challenges of
development at this time, it has a broader significance as well. If we view the
global and ethnically diverse Bahá’í community as a microcosm of humanity,
then the principle of stirrings at the grassroots referred to by the Universal
House of Justice is important not only for development in the Bahá’í
community; it has implications for development in the world at large.

In 1983, when the Universal House of Justice released its first letter on social
and economic development, the ineffectiveness of many projects and programs
in the developing countries, which were planned and carried out from a distant
capital or foreign country, was already making itself known. Similarly, in
industrialized countries such as the U.S., the U.K., and Canada, government
investment in programs over the previous two decades intended to quickly
eradicate problems such as poverty and crime had met only limited success,
along with growing political opposition.1 Anecdotal accounts of practitioners and
the academic literature abounded with stories of the misallocation of precious
government revenues and international agency funds for projects and programs
that either bypassed those people most in need or did not achieve the anticipated
success. This is not an excuse for the ongoing retreat of governments, their

1. For lack of better alternatives, the terms industrialized and developing countries are used
throughout this paper, but this in no way implies that the industrialized countries represent a model
for development.

bilateral aid agencies, and multilateral agencies from collective responsibility for
problems such as poverty, illiteracy, poor health, and a deteriorating natural
environment within their own countries and elsewhere. But it does explain why
nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) have become major actors in
development, since they are seen as having closer links with people at the
grassroots. In parallel fashion, attention in the industrialized countries has been
turning to the nonprofit sector as a significant agency of change in the social and
economic development field. These major shifts underscore a single overriding
lesson that has been learned from the decades of failure: engagement of people at
the community level is fundamental to addressing development problems.

Yet despite the widespread acceptance at the policy level by governments,
NGOs, and international agencies that involvement of people at the grassroots
level is critically important to “success” in development, little attention has
been paid to how community-based development fits conceptually into overall
development processes. What factors account for people choosing to initiate,
organize, and direct their own development? On the surface, this would seem to
be a question having an impact on only a small area of development policy. But
the answer to it is actually central to development theory itself.

For some time, development theory has been described as being in a crisis.

Expressions like “post-development,” “the end of economics,” “beyond the
impasse” are becoming commonplace in the academic literature (Rahnema;
Buarque; Schuurman). Along with the inability of theoretical models to account
for the lack of success of many development programs of all ideological
persuasions over the last century, the crisis has also been attributed to a few
other factors. First is the failure of development theory to predict or provide a
viable alternative to the current unsatisfactory patterns of globalization, the
subject of much debate. A second cause of the impasse is the world
environmental crisis and the acknowledgement that if the goal of development
is to attain the lifestyle currently practiced in the industrialized countries, then it
is clearly not viable on a global scale. Finally, for some time feminists have
criticized the dominant models of development for leaving women out of the
process altogether. The latter two critiques have gained wide support and
significance over the past few decades.

There is yet another challenge for development theory. If theoretical
frameworks cannot provide a viable explanation for why and how development
is practiced at the community level, then they are deficient in accounting for a
phenomenon that is not only important for the Bahá’í community, but that is
documented in empirical research and widely accepted in practice and policy.2

2. Realization that work was needed in this area this arose out of the author’s twelve-year
experience conducting empirical research on community-based housing in both the developing and
industrialized countries, during which it became apparent there was no macro-level theoretical
framework in which to place the findings.

26      THE JOURNAL OF BAHÁ’Í STUDIES                           11.1/2.2001

The purpose of this paper is twofold: to investigate how or whether current
development theories account for natural stirrings at the grassroots and to offer
a framework for an alternative explanation based on an understanding of the
Bahá’í Revelation that might represent the foundation of a new theory of
development. The paper first provides a tentative definition for stirrings at the
grassroots. This is followed by a description of the three main paradigms of
development theory and how each explains stirrings at the grassroots. An
alternative theoretical framework derived from the Bahá’í Revelation is then
sketched out, including a new organizing principle of development, a new
engine for development that is the force behind it, three potential challenges to
this development framework, and a brief description of the model as it is
practiced in the Bahá’í community. Following this is a discussion of lessons
learned, prescriptions for action, as well as a series of propositions applying this
new principle to all three paradigms.

Several operating principles were used in writing the paper. First, the paper
uses a historical method to present the evolution of thought on development,
with the proposed theory derived from the Bahá’í Revelation presented as
building on what has come before. Concepts drawn from the Bahá’í writings are
used as a lens for understanding the past and looking to the future. The paper is
not, strictly speaking, a detailed textual analysis of the Bahá’í writings
pertaining to development, nor is it primarily an explanation of development as
it is applied within the Bahá’í community, although both these features are
included. Second, development is assumed to be a global challenge focused on
more than the developing countries. Knowledge and empirical examples are
therefore drawn from both the First and Third Worlds. Third, although
development theory has traditionally been dominated by the field of economics,
there is an attempt in the paper to move past this. The discussions therefore
draw on a number of areas of scholarship, all with long traditions that could
only be very briefly summarized. Fourth, the paper includes an attempt to
anticipate and address major criticisms that might arise from what is being
proposed. Finally, the paper refers to the Sacred Writings of the Bahá’í Faith as
one, if not the primary, source of legitimacy for a new theory of development,
but it is hoped that the case being presented at the very least offers food for
thought or is convincing without this.

“Natural Stirrings at the Grassroots”: A Definition
It is possible to propose a working definition based loosely on the Universal
House of Justice’s statement on stirrings at the grassroots, with the hope that it
helps discriminate between what may or may not be grassroots development
while at the same time incorporating the maximum range of possible activities.
Three things about community-based development can be deduced. First, the
initiation of change occurs at the community level (“natural” and “grassroots”).

Natural Stirrings at the Grassr o o t s                       27

Second, the change is collective, involving some degree of organization beyond
the individual or household level (“stirrings”). Third, ongoing direction of this
change involves people at the grassroots (“the driving force”). While we are
proposing that for an activity to be considered as grassroots development all
three attributes should probably be evident, they may not all hold in the strict
sense for every case. For example, looking at the first factor, community-level
initiation, although a child vaccination campaign must involve people at the
community level at the implementation stage, it would not often be initiated by
them and requires a high degree of centralized planning. On the second
attribute, collective organization of community-based development, micro-
enterprises (or small-scale businesses) are examples of grassroots development,
but many subsist for long periods with only a loose, informal type of
organization. Finally, on communities being the driving force of change,
education reform might be initiated by an individual community but requires a
higher-level coordination of activities for the purposes of funding and
curriculum development. Thus, if grassroots development is to be a useful
concept, care must be exercised in imposing too rigid or narrow a definition.

Despite the ambiguities, if we apply these three indicators as the basis of a
definition, the phenomenon of natural stirrings at the grassroots has a long
history. Numerous examples can be found in both the developing and the
industrialized countries. A growing body of literature has documented the
efforts of people in poor urban communities in the developing countries—with
or without the help of governments, foreign development agencies, and
NGOs—who form community-based housing organizations to engage in new
housing construction or rehabilitation, or improve the physical infrastructure in
their communities (Vakil, “Problems and Prospects”; Arrossi et al.; Turner).
Although not without its problems, this experience clearly demonstrates the
capacity of people to contribute to their own development within the constraints
of very limited resources and sometimes even political opposition. In the rural
sector, a powerful example of grassroots development is one in Bangladesh that
began as a community-level experiment with small-scale lending to rural
women for launching microenterprises, an approach which has spread not only
to other developing countries but to North America, Europe, and Scandinavia as
well (Holcombe).

Other examples of community-based development can be found in the
industrialized countries. In North America, community development
corporations have been in existence for several decades and, with some
government and private foundation assistance, have built and rehabilitated
housing and substantially reduced crime in inner-city urban neighborhoods
despite the enormous psychological challenges of hopelessness, racism, and
public apathy (Vidal; Perry et al.; Medoff and Sklar). In rural and First Nations
regions, people at the grassroots level have initiated nonprofit economic

28       THE JOURNAL OF BAHÁ’Í STUDIES                                     11.1/2.2001

development organizations, cultural development projects, and healing circles
in the face of fierce challenges such as persistent poverty, substance abuse,
long-standing oppression, and colonial domination (Douglas).

In the world Bahá’í community, the roots of community-based development
extend back to the latter half of the nineteenth century with the founding of
primary schools in Iran (Momen). In more recent times, primary schools, radio
stations oriented to development processes, and race unity education projects
are some examples of sustained development at the grassroots level.

From this description, it can be seen that grassroots development is not a
minor, regionally concentrated, or recent set of activities. It is therefore
essential that a theory of development provide an explanation for it.

Development Doctrine and Stirrings at the Grassroots
Development theory has been in existence for centuries, but within the last
century it has focused almost exclusively on what are now known as the
developing countries. Consequently, the theories discussed below make little
reference to the industrialized regions, rendering justification to the frequently
held notion that these regions are already “developed.” A bit of inspection
reveals that much of this theory also applies to the industrialized countries. The
following sections provide brief descriptions of the most important of these
theories, many of them economic, and their explanations for stirrings at the
grassroots. They fall within three main categories: modernization, Marxian, and
civil-society-based paradigms.3

The Modernization Paradigm: For Profit
We begin with the theoretical perspective that has the longest history: the
neoclassical or modernization approach to development. Its roots stretch back
to the ideas of the philosophers of the Enlightenment such as Voltaire and
Diderot, who proposed that humans are rational and that progress involves
processes that are objective and universally applicable. The neoclassical
economics tradition has continued to be influenced by the work of the famous
Adam Smith, who investigated the nature of the market economy and the
“invisible hand”; Thomas Malthus, who focused on the role of population
growth in development; and David Ricardo, who formulated the notion of
comparative advantage in trade. In the first half of the twentieth century, this
tradition was further developed by Joseph Schumpeter, who emphasized
technological innovation, and later by Walt Whitman Rostow, who formulated
his universal theory of stages of economic growth using nineteenth- and early
twentieth-century Europe as a historical model.

3. A useful, unbiased, and thorough tracing of the historical evolution of development theory can
be found in Martinussen. Also helpful is the review by Hettne.

After World War II, the earliest “structuralist” approaches to development
focused on the role of saving and capital investment in economic growth, which
led to the notion that development could be planned. Later, other considerations
were taken into account such as the barriers to industrial development, which
was regarded at the time as the principle engine of progress. The notion of
“worlds” emerged, with a center-periphery model that placed the industrialized
countries at the center and the developing countries at the periphery. Others
such as Gunnar Myrdal began suggesting that development involved not only
the industrial sector of the economy, but agriculture and social equality as well.
Additional areas of study that emerged were “new institutional economics” (an
examination of the structures and strategies within firms as an important
determinant of market dynamics) and the “informal” (or small-scale petty
commodity) sector of the economy which was viewed as connected to
traditional societies and would eventually be replaced by modern economic
practices. Still others concerned themselves with how productivity in the
agricultural sector might be improved by exploring such factors as technology,
rural policy, and land reform.

Although the modernization tradition has been the domain of the discipline of
economics, contributions have also been made by sociologists such as Max
Weber, who delved into the relationships between individual behavior,
bureaucratic institutions, and the economy. Another important sociological
notion was that of a dualistic society, in which it was proposed that the social
patterns and habits of poor people become entrenched in what has been called a
“culture of poverty.”

Political scientists’ role in the evolution of the modernization approach began
with the work of David Easton, Almond and Powell, and Lucien Pye, who
explored the importance of Western-style democratic institutions as a necessary
condition for modernization. Other factors considered by political scientists
were the role of military dictatorships, the phenomenon of the “soft state”
characterized by weak legal and administrative institutions, and development
planning as one of the roles of the state. Some have focused on the state’s
potential role in disarmament that would result in the freeing up of economic
resources for development.

In 1976, the International Labour Organization (ILO) produced a report
which stated that economic growth in industry and other modern sectors, while
necessary, was not adequately addressing issues of unemployment and poverty.
Based on a growing understanding of the nature of poverty, the ILO along with
others argued that interim measures such as improving employment, health
care, and education should be taken to accompany growth-oriented strategies.
Following on the heels of this “basic needs” approach was the “human
development” school. Championed by the Pakistani economist Mahbub ul Haq,
along with Paul Streeten and Amartya Sen, the human development approach

30     THE JOURNAL OF BAHÁ’Í STUDIES                          11.1/2.2001

acknowledged the importance of economic growth but claimed that this could
not occur without public sector leadership in ensuring that the poor and
disenfranchised in a society have access to the basic services which sustain life.
This thinking was very influential and resulted in the UNDP’s annual
publication of the widely distributed Human Development Report. Although the
human development approach has not contributed significantly to development
theory, it represents an early reference to moral standards.

Over the past twenty years, the modernization view has enjoyed a major
resurgence through an approach called “neoliberalism.” Based on the work of
Lal; Balassa; and Little, it involves a much-reduced role for the state in
development and has been strongly promoted by powerful international
agencies such as the World Bank. This strategy is more or less parallel with the
renewed conservative economic agenda in industrialized countries such as
Britain, the U.S., and Canada, which have continued to promote a similar
reduction in the role of governments. Heavy justification for this approach was
gleaned from the “East Asian miracle” of the 1980s and early 1990s in the
countries of South Korea and Taiwan. But it has since come under fire with the
unpredicted “Asian meltdown” of 1997. What we might notice in this general
trajectory of ideas falling within the modernization tradition is a preponderant
emphasis on the role of the market—and less recently the state—and how these
larger processes affect and define development.

How does community-based development fit into this? One of the strengths
of the modernization approach lies in the internal logic of its theory, which
includes an attempt to account for individual agency. The explanation can be
found in the body of theory generally known as microeconomics, a subfield of
economics which proposes a role for the individual in modernization processes.
According to this approach, the individual is viewed as a materialist being,
based on John Stuart Mill’s nineteenth-century notion of homo economicus,
which is an extension of the ideas of Adam Smith. This concept has evolved to
refer to rational behavior motivated by the desire to maximize “utility” or
satisfaction. In simple terms, this refers to making a profit. Drawing on
ingenuity, creative problem solving, and a willingness to work hard, the
individual establishes an enterprise that provides a good or a service, and builds
up that enterprise. The result is that the enterprise benefits the individual’s
family, its own employees and consumers, and ultimately the entire society.
This is essentially an explanation for grassroots development based on
entrepreneurship.

What is missing? First, as commonly cited as this process is in describing the
formation of most businesses, the projects that many community-based
organizations engage in—schools, health education, self-help housing,
collective farming—cannot be classified as enterprises since they are often not
profit generating. And although they rely heavily on the initiative of several

Natural Stirrings at the Grassr o o t s                        31

individuals and hard work, grassroots-led development is frequently motivated
not by profit but by a desire to provide a basic service to the community. Even
microenterprises are often driven by incentives other than simple profit
generation. Second, these activities may be launched initially by individuals, but
they often become collective undertakings at the community level.
Consequently, the individual entrepreneurship model does not account well for
grassroots development initiatives.

Potential responses to this assertion are essentially twofold. First,
community-based development motivated by factors other than profit can be
seen as a transitional phenomenon. Communities are forced to provide
necessities until the market “inefficiencies” in these areas and in the overall
economy are remedied. (A fully functional economy would generate tax
revenue to pay for some of these services.) The problem with this approach is
that despite decades of intervention of various kinds, market inefficiencies have
not been fixed. In some parts of the world, such as sub-Saharan Africa, they
have actually worsened. This deterioration is due to the failure of a longstanding
mechanism claimed by proponents of the modernization approach, that benefits
to the prosperous will “trickle down” to those less fortunate—a claim now
rejected even by those who might wish otherwise. In the industrialized
countries, a dual phenomenon has emerged. As mentioned above, the state has
not been efficient or successful in resolving problems resulting from market
inadequacies. Second, taxpayers have become increasingly unwilling to fund
some of the services not provided by the market. Unless one assumes that future
solutions will eventually address these inadequacies, it seems likely that
community-based development is more than a temporary stopgap solution.

There is another explanation for community-based development as a
transitional phenomenon. Notwithstanding innumerable training programs and
the creation of incentives by both government and the market, the skills of
Western-style individual entrepreneurship have not been successfully learned
by the vast majority of the world’s peoples (which would in turn resolve market
inefficiencies). Consequently, they must often resort to other kinds of activities
to meet their basic needs. Now it could be claimed that these peoples are
incapable of learning such skills, a belief with serious ethnocentric and class-
laden implications, held more often than one would suspect since it is rarely
expressed openly. It could also be argued that the important attributes of most
of the world’s cultures, such as kinship and other norms and values of a
collective nature, are inconsistent with individual entrepreneurship. The
solution would therefore lie in eliminating or otherwise redirecting these
cultural attributes. Even if this were accurate, given the scale of the project—
which would have to target most of the human population on the planet—it is
an unrealistic proposition. Core cultural values and practices like kinship are
enduring phenomena.

32       THE JOURNAL OF BAHÁ’Í STUDIES                                      11.1/2.2001

We do not imply that because individual entrepreneurship cannot adequately
explain community-based development it is therefore a useless notion.
Entrepreneurship, economic competition, and the profit motive have been
responsible for much progress and positive change in the quality of life of many
people. The history of the industrialized nations over the past hundred years
illustrates this fact. Profit has also been an important incentive in the success of
microenterprises and microfinance institutions. Indeed, community-based
development is quite happily accepted within the modernization paradigm since
it is seen as an indicator of people’s ability to “pull themselves up by the
bootstraps” and a justification for reducing the responsibility of government.
Regardless of one’s opinion on that, individual entrepreneurship is probably a
necessary element of development. However, because it cannot adequately
account for grassroots-led development, it is an insufficient mechanism for
explaining overall development processes.

What can be learned from the experience of this model? An important
contribution of the modernization approach in the search for a development
theory lies in its emphasis on providing a social, economic, and political
environment that fosters individual initiative and creative problem solving. As
its proponents claim, this environment creates the conditions necessary for the
formation of individual enterprises. But at the same time, it creates some of the
necessary conditions required for community-based development. For example,
changes in policies in the housing sector, such as improving the accessibility of
financing and the removal of cumbersome regulations and unnecessary
procedures associated with purchasing land, not only better enable the private
housing market to function more effectively, but they also facilitate the
formation and effective functioning of community-based organizations that
build housing for their members. Identification of the importance of access to
small loans has enabled millions of people worldwide to benefit from
microenterprises. Because of the significance of these conditions in stimulating
individual and collective initiative, the modernization approach to overall
development processes sheds light on development with freedom.4

The Marxian Approaches: For Power
Despite the long history and dominance of the modernization approach in
development, still employed by most of the world’s governments and influential
development agencies, other approaches have been formulated over the past 150
years or so. The most compelling and historically significant among them have
been the Marxian approaches.

4. “Freedom” here refers to the commonly accepted meaning of freedom from interference. For a
full discussion of the Bahá’í perspective on how this concept is currently understood and practiced,
see the Universal House of Justice, Individual Rights and Freedoms.

Similar to the modernization paradigm, Marxian approaches to development
are an outgrowth of a fundamental understanding of how the market economy
works. In like fashion, the ideas of Karl Marx also follow from those of the
Enlightenment philosophers since he viewed human beings as rational, and
progress as an objective and universal process. However, his view of society,
derived from the philosophy of Hegel, was a historical one. Marx’s ideas on the
economy were a reaction to the appalling living conditions of urban industrial
workers in mid-nineteenth-century Europe and centered on the role of capital
and the value of labor. According to Marx, there was an increasing divide
between those who controlled capital and those who sold their labor for wages.
The capital-controlling classes (or “bourgeoisie”) were able to continually
accumulate capital through profits resulting primarily from the “surplus value”
of wage labor, which led to perpetual exploitation of, and a degrading life for,
the working classes. The solution, according to Marx, was expropriation of
capital from the bourgeoisie by the state, which would then manage the affairs
of the economy on behalf of the entire society. This was a historical process
evolving out of the “natural” progression from feudalism through capitalism to
socialism, and would be achieved by force.5 The necessary condition for the
move to socialism was the working classes (the “proletariat”) attaining “class
consciousness,” or solidarity gained from a collective awareness of how they
were being exploited. How the state should manage the economy once it
achieved this has been the cause of ongoing disputes among Marxists for many
decades (Tucker).

In the mid-twentieth century, several theorists applied and adapted Marx’s
view of the economy to development. Building on the structuralist notion of
core and periphery, Paul Baran extended the concept of surplus value of labor in
industrial production to the entire economy as a way of explaining why some
economies remained underdeveloped. Andre Gunder Frank, a Latin American
economist, formulated his well-known dependency theory of development in
which the dynamics of the global system of capitalism, particularly unequal
exchange and trade, continually enrich the core of the system (the industrialized
countries) while at the same time draining resources and wealth from the
periphery (or the “underdeveloped” countries). Others have since focused on
factors such as a distorted production structure within the underdeveloped
countries, undervalued labor, and the degree to which the bourgeoisie was able
to exert control over the state, which could then be used as a tool to further
enrich the bourgeoisie. Developments within the neo-Marxist tradition
contributed by sociologists include a focus on social class and “modes of

5. Although not often acknowledged, the evolution of the welfare state and welfare programs in
many nonsocialist countries was a direct result of the impact of socialist thinking.

34        THE JOURNAL OF BAHÁ’Í STUDIES                                         11.1/2.2001

production” in the agricultural and industrial sectors within the developing
countries and the growing internationalization of the labor market resulting
primarily from the emergence of transnational corporations.

Political scientists have examined the impact of colonialism on political
institutional development, and the national and ethnic conflicts that have
resulted. Other areas of study include the impact of geopolitical conflicts
resulting from the Cold War; the reasons nondemocratic institutions,
particularly military regimes, have flourished in many developing countries;
patron-client relations within political systems; and the role of democratic
institutions in enhancing human rights, legitimacy, and participation
(Sandbrook).

It might be noticed that, like the modernization discourse, the Marxian
tradition also places heavy emphasis on both the market and the state as
principal actors in development processes. Despite the rapid fall of the Soviet-
bloc regimes over a decade ago, the Marxian tradition has remained a
convincing critique and descriptive tool because it grew out of a concern for
social and economic inequality that continues to remain only an afterthought
within the modernization paradigm. This partly accounts for its enduring
popularity.6 Indeed, for many, the term progressive denotes some connection
with Marxian analysis or practice.

Turning to the question of grassroots initiatives as a form of development,
Marxist theory is of limited usefulness as an explanatory tool. It is not clear
what Marx actually thought about the individual, since most of his writing
focused on the societal level. Many have criticized the disjuncture between
Marx’s early and later writings, the former sometimes described as humanist,
motivated by a deep concern for the human condition and almost verging on a
transcendent view of human nature (Fromm; Avineri). His portrayals of
individual behavior are nonetheless confined to the materialist terms of the
relationship between individuals and their work. According to Marx, labor
relations in the capitalist system produce alienation in the individual. One
reason for the need to remove the capitalist system is to rid the individual
worker of this alienation. In Marx’s later writings, however, his description of
society itself becomes quite mechanistic and he makes little mention of the
individual, who appears as an atomized version of class consciousness and a
tool for collective action.

In contrast to modernization theory, which exalts the individual and provides
no role for collective undertakings, the Marxist view promotes the opposite by
defining human beings primarily as instruments for collective action. However,

6. The Marxist interpretation of the collapse of the socialist states is that global capitalism has only
temporarily won the struggle. Modernization proponents, on the other hand, claim victory because
they perceive they have been right all along. Both positions are without much basis.

collective action in the Marxist sense consists of resistance by the working
classes to the exploitation they face, where the goal is to build a mass political
movement that will eventually overthrow the capital-controlling classes. This is
quite different from the type of collective activities undertaken in community-
based development, where the principal aim is to provide goods or services to
the community. So, like the modernization school, Marxian approaches to
development do not account well for grassroots-initiated development.

As with the previous model, there are some potential criticisms of this claim
that must be addressed. Like the proponents of modernization, Marxists view
community-based development as a temporary phenomenon. Grassroots
development activities are seen as resulting from a lack of consciousness of the
working classes, who have not yet recognized their own alienation or built
solidarity with other, similarly exploited people. Because of this, according to
the logic, they do not realize that the real solution to the problem lies in gaining
control over capital on a large scale. As a result, collective action employed in
grassroots development initiatives is misdirected because it focuses on
development rather than resistance.

In order to address this allegation, it is easiest to focus on those areas or
countries where political organizing has been taking place for several decades.
One of two things has happened. First, many people have given up on the
promise of a better life offered as an incentive. Although Marxist states are now
few in number, there are nonetheless some regions where Marxist-oriented
policies are currently in place or have been historically, such as Cuba,
Nicaragua, Tanzania, and Ethiopia. While there is a broad range of approaches
to Marxist social and economic policy (partly because these were never clearly
specified by Marx himself) and it is somewhat unfair to lump them together, the
record with most is fairly consistent. In countries like Cuba, Nicaragua, and
Tanzania there were substantial initial gains in the quality of life, but these were
often reversed. Alternatively, life has remained the same or even worsened, as
in Ethiopia. Second, the self-perpetuating violence often resulting from the
resistance struggle has either worn people down or is seen by them as an
unjustifiable means to an end.7

The notion of change achieved through force is adhered to primarily by hard-
line Marxists, who argue that capitalist structures need to be abolished
altogether through revolution. Many supporters of the Left, however, adopt a
“softer” version of this position by advocating that the purpose of resistance by

7. Marxists propose that the reason socialist regimes such as those in Nicaragua and Tanzania
failed is that they were conspired against by the more powerful capitalist bloc countries. This is
difficult to disprove and is another explanation for the enduring faith of a great many people in the
Marxian view. For a Bahá’í perspective on comparing capitalism and Marxism as social ideologies,
see Hanson, “Bahá’í Development Strategy.” For a comparison between the Bahá’í Faith and
Marxism, see The Bahá’í Faith and Marxism.

36       THE JOURNAL OF BAHÁ’Í STUDIES                                       11.1/2.2001

exploited peoples is to change institutions and structures in some way. Indeed,
many Marxists would see community-based development in a positive light
since it represents proof of market failure and the desire among exploited
people to establish economic structures such as nonprofit organizations outside
the free market system. In stating that the grassroots activities in question focus
on development rather than resistance, we are not saying there is no place for
institutional change. This is needed, and there is no doubt that much injustice
has been historically addressed in this way. But there are serious limits to the
positive effects of institutional change alone, as the case of racial inequality in
the U.S. demonstrates. Although not motivated by Marxist philosophy, the civil
rights movement in the U.S. of the 1960s is a good example of a resistance-
oriented movement aimed at institutional change. As a result, policies and
practices explicitly discriminating against African Americans in housing,
employment, and education have been considerably reduced. But residential
segregation based on race in U.S. cities has increased, and poverty in African
American communities has worsened (Wilson). Therefore institutional change,
although necessary, seems insufficient.

Despite the shortcomings, what can be learned from the Marxist view? An
important contribution of the Marxist approach to development theory is that it
directly addresses the exploitation and suffering experienced by ordinary people
that has been exacerbated by modernization policies, or created by them.
Although incomplete in theory and proven not very successful in practice, it
nonetheless continues to satisfy a deep longing among many people who
believe no other approach to development addresses these same issues. Because
of the Marxist view’s emphasis on the inequalities of the human condition, its
principal contribution to overall development processes is that it offers a
perspective on development with justice.8

The Civil Society Paradigm
The third and final approach we will examine in some detail is civil-society-
based development, a loose collection of theories that has shifted the discourse
from abstract concepts like the state and the market to the role of civil society,
or people’s organizations and activities not affiliated with either the market or
the state. The origins of this development paradigm might be traced back to the
liberal philosophy of John Stuart Mill or the direct democracy promoted by
Jean-Jacques Rousseau.

A word needs to be said at this point on a subgroup of these theories,
espoused primarily by anthropologists and other scholars and practitioners.

8. “Justice,” as it is used here, refers simply to the basic concept of fairness as most people
understand it. Despite its problems, Marxism is still able to appeal to this sense of fairness. For a
fuller treatment of the subject of justice from a Bahá’í perspective, see Lerche.

Culture-based approaches to development derive from the early nineteenth-
century German Romantic philosophers such as Schleiermacher, who proposed
that humans are products of specific cultures and that progress is not a
universal process, but one that can only be defined within a particular society.
Examples of these approaches are found in the work of anthropologists such as
Clifford Geertz and Paul Brass, who focus on the relationship between
development and ethnic identities and nationalities. Culture-based approaches
have made a significant contribution to the overall development debate, since
they have placed the important element of culture at the center of the
discussion. Saiedi presents two major problems associated with these
approaches, derived from the Romantic or “historicist” view of development.
First, the emphasis on cultural uniqueness eventually results in assertions of
cultural superiority and can manifest itself in intolerance toward ethnic
minorities within a particular society. Second, culture itself can become a static
concept defined merely by tradition. A recent derivative of culture-based
development is postmodernism, which has gained a considerable following in
the past decade. Based on the writings of Michel Foucault, postmodernists place
great importance on the analysis of language and discourse in understanding
developmental processes. However, a postmodern view of development entails
some problems. First, the postmodern approach represents more of an analytical
tool than a theory describing or prescribing the processes of development.
Saiedi claims that postmodernism is “trapped in a fundamental contradiction”
(20), since on the one hand it rejects objectivity, yet at the same time it
promotes the objective value of tolerance. For these reasons, in addition to the
relatively weak impact culture-based approaches have had on development
theory, we will focus on the work of three individuals within the civil society
paradigm that has been particularly influential: Paulo Freire, John Friedmann,
and David Korten.9

We begin with the work of the Brazilian educator-priest Paulo Freire, whose
rural literacy programs of the 1960s earned him exile during Brazil’s years of
military dictatorship. For Freire, the critical problem of development related to
poor people’s inability to understand the causes and nature of their oppression.
He saw education as the primary means of addressing this problem. Using the
medium of literacy education, Freire worked on the assumption that the rural
poor already possessed a reservoir of knowledge and that the educator’s role

9. Another very recent approach that deserves brief mention is asset-based community
development (ABCD), intended to address problems of poverty in the inner cities of the United
States. Grounded in the notion that community change should be based on identification of assets
rather than enumeration of deficits, ABCD is gaining a large following in North America, but
because it does not offer a theory of development, it is not included in this discussion. See
Kretzmann and McKnight.

38      THE JOURNAL OF BAHÁ’Í STUDIES                         11.1/2.2001

was to facilitate the process of building on this knowledge base. As opposed to
the “blank slate” approach of traditional pedagogy where the teacher “deposits”
information into the mind of the learner—a model Freire saw as a convenient
instrument of neocolonial regimes—he promoted a pedagogy of dialogue. The
means by which the rural poor could improve their quality of life, according to
Freire, was the process of “conscientization”: coming to an understanding of the
causes of oppression. This, in turn, was realized through “liberating” education
whereby, with the help of facilitators or animators, the poor could come to
understand the social forces shaping their lives and believe in their ability to
change these forces. The end result of the conscientization process was
individual and community-level empowerment.

Freire not only had tremendous influence on the development of liberation
theology in Latin America, but his focus on the central role of education in
development processes caused his ideas to have a significant impact on a
number of areas of development practice including education reform in the
developing countries, “informal” or “popular” (non-classroom-based)
education, training programs of various kinds, primary health care, rural
extension, participatory rural appraisal, the promotion of indigenous
knowledge, and participatory research. Further, much of the current work of
NGOs at the grassroots level, which often includes a significant training
component, can be traced to Freire’s model of pedagogy.

It is probably unfair to comment on Freire’s work as a theory of
development, since he did not propose one; however, a few observations can be
made about his ideas in the context of other approaches to development. First,
Freire did not attempt to explain politics or economics at the national level;
rather he was concerned primarily with oppression at the local level.
Consequently, he made little reference to either the state or the market. Second,
there is an apparent logical affinity between his notion of conscientization
among the “oppressed” and Marx’s concept of class consciousness. However,
Freire did not claim that his idea of empowerment constituted political power.
Rather, it was an empowerment resulting from knowledge and understanding.
No clear direction was provided as to what individuals or communities should
do at the collective level once they became empowered and attained
conscientization. Nonetheless, his work essentially filled in the missing piece of
the Marxist model since it provided a role for both the individual and the
community as well as an educational methodology for building collective
political action.

As a response to the modernization approach with its foundation in utility-
maximizing behavior of the individual, John Friedmann, an international urban
planning consultant and university professor based in the U.S., has articulated a
theory of alternative development using as its point of departure the “basic
needs” approach (characterized by him as “political claims”) for eradicating

poverty, which he sees as the central development challenge. Friedmann states
that the operational principle for eradicating poverty is power. In this way,
although he reformulates the class-based Marxian concept of power, there is
nonetheless a link between the two concepts. He refers to three kinds of power:
psychological, social, and political. Psychological power is associated with self-
confidence and an “individual sense of potency” (Friedmann 33). Social power
refers to capacities at the household level such as knowledge and skills,
financial resources, social networks, and surplus time. The use of these
capacities is motivated, according to Friedmann, by reciprocity and mutual
obligation for the purpose of increasing the productive wealth of the household.
Finally, political power is the ability to access critical decision-making
processes and have a collective voice.

Drawing on much of what has been learned in the past decades about
development, Friedmann goes on to state that development occurs when the
social power of poor households is used to assert political claims. These claims
can be realized in a number of ways. First, poor households must be included in
democratic processes. Second, they must participate in and benefit from
“appropriate economic growth,” which should include the informal sector of the
economy (mentioned above). Third, referring to the important work of Maxine
Molyneux, Friedmann states that the “strategic” and “practical” political claims
of poor women must be met. Women’s practical claims arise from lack of
education, inaccessibility of credit, poor health, early and numerous
pregnancies, and the child-rearing responsibilities and domestic confinement
associated with them. Strategic claims refer to the legal and institutional
changes that must take place in order for many of the practical claims to be
fulfilled. Finally, Friedmann incorporates environmental issues by stating that
development must entail allocating real prices to products and processes
involving external environmental costs, environmental accounting mechanisms
which ensure that environmental damage is adequately monitored, food
security, and the building of energy-conserving cities. For Friedmann,
community-based development is at the front and center of development
processes. Development must “build on people’s own initiative” at the
community level, and “mutual learning, patient listening, and a tolerance for
contrary views” (160) must be part of the experience.

Unlike Freire, Friedmann’s approach includes the state and the market along
with many other factors in a more holistic fashion, and is therefore one of the
more comprehensive and informed approaches that have emerged in the past
decades of the debate on development. Unlike either the modernization or
Marxist models, its focus on the household recognizes that most of the world’s
peoples belong to communal rather than Western-style individualistic cultures.
It acknowledges that people are “moral beings” motivated by more than simply
making a profit. Because it incorporates much of what has been learned about

40      THE JOURNAL OF BAHÁ’Í STUDIES                         11.1/2.2001

development, it is a useful descriptive model for understanding development
processes.

However, this approach has some basic shortcomings. We will make mention
of two issues on the descriptive side, both acknowledged by Friedmann himself
(46). Unlike the Marxist approach, which focuses exclusively on collective
action, Friedmann’s model focuses on the household as the unit of analysis.
However, this still does not resolve the dilemma of how to account for the
individual’s role in the whole process. It creates, as Friedmann suggests, a
“black box” at the household level. Also, the strength of a household-centered
approach, with its emphasis on sociocultural relations accurately reflecting the
life conditions of many of the world’s peoples, is also its weakness. It may not
be so helpful in understanding development in the industrialized countries due
to the high proportion of single-person households in those populations. Despite
these shortcomings, Friedmann’s model will likely have a significant impact on
both the theory and practice of development.

Roughly twenty years after Freire wrote down his thoughts on education for
development, David Korten began sharing his reflections on what he had
learned during his many years as a development consultant in southeast Asia for
the U.S. Agency for International Development. In contrast to the previous two
alternative approaches to development, Korten’s ideas have fewer parallels with
either the modernization or the Marxian model. Korten outlines the basic
principles of what he calls “people-centered development,” which he defines as
“a process by which the members of a society increase their personal and
institutional capacities to mobilize and manage resources to produce sustainable
and justly distributed improvements in their quality of life consistent with their
own aspirations” (Getting to the 21st Century 67).

Drawing heavily on the language of the environmental crisis, which he
contends was created largely by centralized states and private corporations,
Korten proposes that it is voluntary organizations (VOs) that will eventually
bring about development. He outlines a typology of VOs and describes how the
voluntary sector itself has evolved through this typology since the 1950s and
1960s. Korten goes on to state that it is “fourth generation,” or “people’s”
organizations (POs) that hold the greatest potential to effect positive change.
According to Korten, POs have three characteristics: they serve their own
members, they have a democratic structure, and they are self-reliant. He argues
strongly against centralized top-down development, and in favor of approaches
grounded in the experience of communities.

In Korten’s view, POs must comprise global citizens or “citizen volunteers,”
who through “critical consciousness” are able to “transcend institutional and
cultural conditioning for the larger good of the society” (Getting to the 21st
Century 107). He emphasizes the role of education in bringing about this
change in consciousness, but also the role of religion:

Religion, which commonly presumes to be society’s primary arbiter of the values
> that govern human behavior and relationships, must surely play a central role. While
> religion is all too often invoked as the rallying cry of the intolerant and hateful in the
> cause of violence, the basic message of all of the world’s great religious teachers has
> been one of love, brotherhood and tolerance. Those who follow in the tradition of
> these great teachers are among the most important development workers of our day
> because they are attacking a root cause of human suffering. (Getting to the 21st
> Century 189)

Korten’s work has been widely read by development practitioners and
scholars, particularly those working in the NGO sector; however the lack of
reference to power dynamics has made it vulnerable to criticism from the
Left.10

Although the three civil-society-based approaches to development theory
included here are somewhat different, what links them in terms of a new
perspective on community-based development not previously provided by
neoclassical or Marxist theory is that they all openly acknowledge the
importance of moral factors in describing the existing and potential human
condition. Korten’s theory even prescribes a role for religion. Second, they
focus explicitly on a locally based process either at the community or the
organizational level and, in describing this process, make an attempt to
reconceptualize power. Finally, Korten’s approach in particular identifies a new
concept of global citizenship as a critical variable for change. The main new
contribution of civil-society-based approaches to development theory is that
they introduce the notion of development with empowerment.

A Bahá’í Framework for Development Theory
The next sections outline a framework, derived from the texts of the Bahá’í
Faith, for a new theory of development. The basic theoretical principles of this
framework are presented as well as an attempt to address criticisms that might
arise. In doing so, similarities and differences between the new approach and
the three existing paradigms discussed are drawn out. Emerging knowledge
from a number of disciplinary traditions is used to support these principles. Also
included is an explanation of how they are put into practice by the Bahá’í
community.

Dignity as an Organizing Principle
Although John Stuart Mill’s notion of homo economicus comes closest to it,
none of the approaches so far discussed provides a comprehensive theory of

10. For example, it has been claimed that the approach is “unable to replace the accumulated
insights into the structures, processes, and power relations that constitute the context of human
action. . . .” (Martinussen 341).

42        THE JOURNAL OF BAHÁ’Í STUDIES                                         11.1/2.2001

human nature that might represent a philosophical foundation for a theory of
development. Both the modernization and Marxian frameworks are based on an
essentially mechanistic view of human nature not shared by most of the world’s
ordinary people. Civil-society-based models have so far not provided a clear
alternative. What is needed, then, is a revisiting of some basic assumptions
about what it is to be human.

Bahá’u’lláh, the Author of the Bahá’í Revelation, provides a foundation for
an approach to development in which He claims that the essence of humanity is
spiritual: “O S ON OF SPIRIT! Noble have I created thee, yet thou hast abased
thyself. Rise then unto that for which thou wast created” (Hidden Words,
Arabic no. 22).

> O SON OF SPIRIT!

I created thee rich, why dost thou bring thyself down to poverty? Noble I made
> thee, wherewith dost thou abase thyself? Out of the essence of knowledge, I gave thee
> being, why seekest thou enlightenment from anyone beside Me? Out of the clay of
> love I molded thee, how dost thou busy thyself with another? Turn thy sight unto
> thyself, that thou mayest find Me standing within thee, mighty, powerful and self-
> subsisting. (Bahá’u’lláh, Hidden Words, Arabic no. 13)

Although the full meaning and implications of these passages would require a
lengthy treatise, two important things can be gleaned that are relevant for this
discussion. The first is that Bahá’u’lláh’s explanation of human nature is
described in nonmaterial terms. This is important for development theory, since
the two main perspectives previously described (modernization and Marxism)
operate on an implicit assumption that development can be measured with
money. They therefore tend to focus on that (large) sector of the world’s
population lacking in material wealth. The solutions provided by these
paradigms suggest that once the world’s material wealth is more evenly
balanced, development has been “achieved.” Other than in the environmental
sphere, there are few suggestions for changes that need to be made by the
wealthy minority. One implication of Bahá’u’lláh’s universal description of
human nature is therefore that the balancing of material wealth in the world, as
challenging and vital as that might be, is neither sufficient nor achievable as the
sole goal of development.

The second fact that can be gleaned from Bahá’u’lláh’s statements quoted
above is that the central feature of human nature is nobility. Although not
exactly synonymous, the term dignity is used here, as it is more easily utilized
in discussions about development within the social sciences and humanities.11

11. Nobility, according to Webster’s New Universal Unabridged Dictionary, includes some
attributes not listed in the definition for dignity: moral qualities, distinction, and excellence. This is
an important difference, but we prefer the term dignity at this time since it is already gaining usage
in several fields.

Dignity as it is defined in Webster’s dictionary is associated with nobility,
honor, worth, loftiness, and self-respect. These are somewhat intangible
attributes, which means that dignity cannot be viewed in a useful or practical
way as an end state, but must be seen as a process. It can therefore be deduced
that, based on Bahá’u’lláh’s description of human nature, striving for dignity is
the most important positive process underlying individual and collective human
behavior. The same inference can be made from the Sacred Texts of all the
world’s major religions in stark contrast to the profit motive and the quest for
power on which other theories of development are based.

The process of striving for dignity is not a simple one. According to
Bahá’u’lláh, although the central feature of humanity is nobility, human beings
actually possess a dual nature. On the positive side is the quest for dignity just
described. On the negative side is the lower aspect of human nature: greed, lust,
temptation by the material:

In man there are two natures; his spiritual or higher nature and his material or lower
> nature. In one he approaches God, in the other he lives for the world alone. Signs of
> both these natures are to be found in men. In his material aspect he expresses untruth,
> cruelty and injustice. . . . The attributes of his Divine nature are shown forth in love,
> mercy, kindness, truth and justice, one and all being expressions of his higher nature.

(‘Abdu’l-Bahá, Paris Talks 60)12

Everyday life consists of a continuous tension between these two natures.

This is why the process of striving for dignity is more like a struggle. Indeed,
struggle is intrinsic to the very concept of dignity itself. But in both of the
passages quoted above, Bahá’u’lláh states that humans abase themselves:
“Noble have I created thee, yet thou hast abased thyself”; “Noble I made thee,
wherewith dost thou abase thyself?”

Many other passages express a similar notion. This does not mean that the
lower nature of humanity is somehow imaginary. Nor does it necessarily mean
that the lower manifestations of human behavior are inevitably dominant. It
does mean that overcoming the lower nature is a difficult task that must be
addressed by everyone every single day. We therefore propose that a new
theory of development must have as its foundation the fostering of the struggle
for human dignity. From Bahá’u’lláh’s claim that dignity is the most important
potential human attribute, other related truths can be deduced: all humans need
to live a dignified life; all humans have a right to a dignified life; and all
humans contain within their nature the capacity to strive for dignity. The notion
of human dignity as an organizing principle for development can be inferred
from a number of different areas of study that relate to these corollary truths.

12. A fuller discussion of a Bahá’í perspective on human nature can be found in Lerche, “Human
Nature and the Problem of Peace.”

44       THE JOURNAL OF BAHÁ’Í STUDIES                                      11.1/2.2001

Exploration of the need for dignity among humans would advance
significantly the discussion on basic needs, referred to above, that took place
several decades ago. If one accepts that all humans need to strive for dignity,
then clearly the meeting of basic needs is necessary but insufficient. The need
for dignity also casts Friedmann’s model of political claims in a new light since
it moves the discussion beyond the issue of poverty. Coming to terms with the
struggle for dignity as a central feature of human nature would help address
issues related to, but not normally associated with, development from a policy
perspective. For example, if one examines the problem of urban gangs in the
cities of Europe, North America, and elsewhere, it can be seen that the members
of these gangs often live in poor neighborhoods with concentrations of minority
or otherwise excluded populations, where violence, crime, and substance abuse
are endemic and opportunities for education and upward mobility extremely
limited. These individuals have effectively been stripped of the possibility of a
dignified life. The only option they perceive that preserves their dignity is the
gang, in the security of which they are able to attain some sense of importance
and respect. Currently, the main policy in place for dealing with this problem is
the construction of more incarceration facilities, the fastest growing “industry”
in some parts of the U.S., for example. Not only is this an extremely expensive
solution, its effectiveness is highly questionable since it achieves nothing with
respect to the root causes of the problem, particularly the deprivation of dignity.

Human dignity as the basis for human rights has been proposed by Radin and
others who argue that people have a right to conditions which make “human
flourishing” possible. This has also been clearly asserted by the Bahá’í
International Community in the following statement: “Recognition of the
oneness of humanity gives rise to an elevated concept of human rights, one that
includes the assurance of dignity for each person and the realization of each
individual’s innate potential. This view differs markedly from an approach to
human rights that is limited to preventing interference with the individual’s
freedom of action” (Right and Responsibility).

In discussing the Bahá’í view of human rights from a historical perspective,
Weinberg suggests that a focus on human dignity having a “transcendent basis”
in a “universal identity” that can “fuse diverse peoples together into a universal
community” represents a “new generation” of human rights (272).13

The struggle for dignity as a conceptual framework for development is a
potentially useful one. It is universal and not culturally bound or driven by
Western philosophy. Neither is it inimical to notions of justice or freedom.
Human dignity as a core attribute of human nature and the foundation for real
development is an idea on which there can be agreement among both the leaders
and followers of the major religions. 14 In contrast to the primary focus of

14. An example of this line of thinking from a Christian perspective is Reeve, God and the Market.

development theory on the mechanics of greed, self-interest, and lust for power
as the sole motivations explaining the evolution of human society, the struggle
for dignity accounts for positive behaviors such as service to the community,
which most people recognize and acknowledge. At the same time, the lower
aspect of human behavior is not wished away or left unacknowledged. This
latter point will be returned to below. Further, a focus on dignity is consistent
with recent discussions that have taken place within a new field known as
ethical development. Qizilbash reviews some newly proposed ethical
foundations for development that include “capabilities” and basic needs, and
concludes that it is an approach based on a concept of well-being (Griffin, Well-
Being; “On the Winding Road”) that is most promising. The struggle for dignity
is an example of such an approach.

A New Engine for Development: The Human Will
The primary resource drawn upon to fuel the struggle for dignity can be inferred
from the same passages by Bahá’u’lláh quoted above. In the first passage,
Bahá’u’lláh, after pronouncing that nobility is the distinguishing feature of
human beings, states : “Rise then unto that for which thou wast created.” In the
second passage, words like “turn” and “find” are used in referring to how
people should attain nobility: “Turn thy sight unto thyself, that thou mayest find
Me standing within thee, mighty, powerful and self-subsisting.” These are
action words. Rising and finding are acts of will. It is the human will that is the
primary resource to be drawn upon in the struggle for dignity. Indeed, there
remains no other resource left upon which to draw, an assertion made by
Bahá’u’lláh: “Know thou that all men have been created in the nature made by
God, the Guardian, the Self-Subsisting. Unto each one hath been prescribed a
pre-ordained measure, as decreed in God’s mighty and guarded Tablets. All that
which ye potentially possess can, however, be manifested only as a result of
your own volition” (Gleanings 149).

The human will—its nature, functioning, limits, and potentialities—is at the
present time a poorly understood phenomenon; however some insight can be
gleaned from the Bahá’í Revelation. One of the eternal paradoxes of individual
spiritual life is that the highest, most effective, and productive use of the human
will is its subjugation to the Will of God. Referring once again to the short
passage by Bahá’u’lláh already provided, He states in relation to achieving
nobility: “Turn thy sight unto thyself, that thou mayest find Me standing within
thee, mighty, powerful and self-subsisting.” There are a great many passages
from the Bahá’í writings as well as the Sacred Texts of other major faiths that
communicate a similar idea. The notion of detachment, one of the central
principles of all religions, refers to the act of allowing the human will to become
a channel for the will of God. From time immemorial, all the great religions
have taught that without divine assistance, it is difficult to achieve much.

Other passages from the Bahá’í texts reveal further insights into the nature of
46         THE JOURNAL OF BAHÁ’Í STUDIES                                11.1/2.2001

the human will. Consider the following, which refers to the power of volition as
one attribute that distinguishes humans from other beings in the natural world:
“Nature is without volition and acts perforce, whereas man possesses a mighty
will. . . . Man can voluntarily discontinue vices; nature has no power to modify
the influence of its instincts” (‘Abdu’l-Bahá, Promulgation 178). Volition is
affected positively by certain beliefs such as the eternal life of the human soul, a
truth promoted by all the great religions:

> . . . it behooves man to abandon thoughts of nonexistence and death, which are
> absolutely imaginary, and see himself ever-living, everlasting in the divine purpose of
> his creation. . . . If he dwells upon the thought of nonexistence, he will become utterly
> incompetent; with weakened willpower his ambition for progress will be lessened and
> the acquisition of human virtues will cease. (‘Abdu’l-Bahá, Promulgation 89)

In the field of philosophy, the question of “free will” has been debated by
Western philosophers for centuries. At the center of the debate has been the
question of how much of our existence is determined by free will, and what can
be accounted for by destiny (cause-and-effect relationships). Also central are
the roles that reason and intelligence (science) on the one hand, and morality
and the divine (religion), have played in both. In brief terms, toward one end is
the view, espoused by the Pythagoreans and Saint Augustine, as well as Thomas
Hobbes, Spinoza, and most of the Enlightenment philosophers of the late
seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, that human behavior is subject to laws
and has a cause. At the other end of the spectrum is the view that our lives result
primarily from choice. An early presentation of this view was made by Plato
and Aristotle, supported much later in the eighteenth century by Jean-Jacques
Rousseau and the great Immanuel Kant as a reaction to the Enlightenment,
followed by Hegel, William James, and John Dewey in the nineteenth and
twentieth centuries. Somewhere in between lie the contributions of philosophers
like Rene Descartes, John Locke, David Hume, and John Stuart in the
seventeenth, eighteenth, and nineteenth centuries. Setting these controversies
aside, we can say that most people would accept that free will or the human will
exists to some degree. This is because most of us believe that we make choices.

Understanding the human will in the context of individual behavior is a task
that falls within the realm of psychology. Some of the groundwork for this
effort was laid by Daniel Jordan in his discussion of knowledge, volition, and
action. Drawing from the Bahá’í writings, he refers specifically to goal setting,
perseverance, patience, and resisting the temptation of “vices” as powers of the
human will. Hossain Danesh, in his book linking psychology with spirituality,
observes that in the context of psychotherapy, “there is a tendency to reject the
primacy of the role of will and to place much greater importance on forces that
are beyond the reach of our volition such as instincts, drives, the unconscious
and childhood experiences” (71). This is perhaps a major reason so little

attention has been given to the agency of volition in many areas of human
endeavor.15 Yet despite this, the enormous popularity of self-help books now
available on every conceivable subject is a testimony to the enduring belief
people have in the power of the human will to overcome difficulties.

It seems that attention is paid to the human will only in highly exceptional
cases where an individual conquers impossible odds in order to achieve
something. An example provided by Friedmann is the “one-legged octogenarian
who climbs Mount Whitney” (168). William Hatcher refers to the exaggerated
attention (and salaries) paid to individuals with exceptional abilities in sports,
such as Michael Jordan or Wayne Gretzsky, as the “supervaluation of the
special” (18). More ordinary acts of will that are just as heroic are habitually
ignored. For example, it is often assumed that parenting is instinctive behavior.
However, most people who have had any experience with parenting would have
to agree that sacrifices, struggles, and other acts of will are required every day
in the raising of a child. Quite obviously, parenting involves far more than
programmed behavior.

The Bahá’í texts also make reference to the human will when it is exercised
at the collective level. Volition breathes life into the human collectivity, as
illustrated in the following passage: “. . . for the people are as the human body,
and determination and the will to struggle are as the soul, and a soulless body
does not move” (‘Abdu’l-Bahá, S e c r e t 111–12). Humans, when deciding
collectively to take actions, must first attain knowledge about the problem they
wish to act upon:

Mere knowledge of principles is not sufficient. We all know and admit that justice

> thing will not help its erection. The ways and means must be provided; we must will
> to build it and then proceed with the construction. (‘Abdu’l-Bahá, Promulgation 121)

In order to be most effective, collective volition must be based on the
identification of principles that can be agreed upon, as described in the
following passage by the Universal House of Justice: “The essential merit of

15. Another reason why the human will has received little attention as a subject for study is that
research in this area presents some methodological problems. The root cause of these problems is
the philosophical dilemma referred to above. Strictly speaking, the human will lies beyond the
realm of cause and effect. If the human will is entirely “free,” then predicting it is inherently
impossible, a fact originally asserted by Immanuel Kant. For this reason, the scientific method, at
least as it has so far been applied, is not a tool well suited for understanding the human will. This
problem can be seen in the growing need to predict the future behavior of certain types of criminals
such as child molesters. While predictions of specific individual actions may remain forever
impossible, it is conceivable that understanding the faculty of the human will—its nature and
functioning—is within reach. However, scientific research in this area will probably entail major
changes in the way human behavior has traditionally been studied.

48         THE JOURNAL OF BAHÁ’Í STUDIES                                  11.1/2.2001

spiritual principle is that it not only presents a perspective which harmonizes
with that which is immanent in human nature, it also induces an attitude, a
dynamic, a will, an aspiration, which facilitate the discovery and
implementation of practical measures” (Messages 438.37). Volition must be
linked with vision: “The effort of will required for [global peace] cannot be
summoned up merely by appeals for action against the countless ills afflicting
society. It must be galvanized by a vision of human prosperity in the fullest
sense of the term—an awakening to the possibilities of the spiritual and material
well-being now brought within grasp” (Bahá’í International Community,
Prosperity of Humankind 273–74).

In describing the prerequisites for world peace, the Universal House of
Justice states in a letter to the peoples of the world that humanity faces a choice
between “unimaginable horrors” or an “act of consultative will” (Messages
438\.2) that could launch a process leading to world peace. In other words,
humanity can, of its own volition, choose peace. If it makes that choice, there is
an intimate connection between collective volition, the power of human
thought, and consultation,16 as referred to in the following passage from that
letter:

The courage, the resolution, the pure motive, the selfless love of one people for
> another—all the spiritual and moral qualities required for effecting this momentous
> step towards peace are focused on the will to act. And it is towards arousing the
> necessary volition that earnest consideration must be given to the reality of man,
> namely his thought. To understand the relevance of this potent reality is also to
> appreciate the social necessity of actualizing its unique value through candid,
> dispassionate and cordial consultation, and of acting upon the results of this process.

(Messages 438.47)

Scholarly study of the dynamics of the human will as it is manifested at the
collective level can be found primarily in the literature on mass social
movements. More recent examples would be the women’s movement, the civil
rights movement, the antinuclear movement, and the indigenous people’s
movement. Although they involve a wide range of activities, these often include
actions that take place within the political arena and therefore involve, to a
certain extent, power dynamics at the collective level. Scholars have tended to
focus almost exclusively on this conflict aspect of social movements as the
main substantive area for study (Richard Thomas). While in the past this view
has found theoretical justification in Marxist doctrine, more recently it has been

consulting on it, and taking action is actually a framework for planning. See June Manning Thomas
for a description of how the Bahá’í texts further inform this process.

based on a looser concept of counterhegemony, or resistance to the dominant
power structure (Carroll).

The rather narrow focus by scholars on conflict has obscured the importance
of other aspects of the exercise of collective will, primarily those areas of
activity that either do not involve conflict or entail overcoming it. It is these
very areas, involving such things as building a common vision, identifying
operating principles, and fostering consultation skills mentioned in the Bahá’í
texts excerpted above, that are relevant to understanding the collective struggle
for dignity. The pervasive focus on conflict has affected topics chosen for study,
theoretical frameworks employed, methodologies used, and conclusions drawn
when observing collective human activities. Indeed, perhaps because of this
emphasis on conflict, some believe that collective will applied to anything other
than power struggles does not exist at all. However, a different approach is also
emerging. In connection with the antiracism movement, for example, a recent
study conducted in Atlanta found that a far larger proportion of citizens than is
commonly assumed (three-quarters of Caucasians and two-thirds of African
Americans) are involved in interracial contacts and friendship. It was concluded
that “there are reservoirs of interracial good will and amity in the United States
that are both unstudied by scholars and underutilized by agents of social change.
It suggests that conflict models of race relations need to be placed in a broader
context, for they do not fit many day-to-day relationships between whites and
blacks” (National Spiritual Assembly 19).

Three Challenges
Three important issues must be addressed in any attempt to propose a new
approach to development theory. The first has to do with the implications of
human nature itself that have already been mentioned: the challenge of profit
and power. The other two are longstanding critiques of development in theory
and practice: the environmental crisis and gender inequality.

Profit and Power Revisited. What of those who choose to exercise their will for
the sole purpose of pursuing profit or wielding power over others? History
teaches us that only a handful of individuals with control over vast resources or
power over large numbers of people are capable of creating misery on a massive
scale. Consequently, any new approach to development must attempt to address
these issues. There are no quick-alternative fixes for this problem, but the basis
of a solution can be gleaned from the Bahá’í Sacred Writings. We deal with the
power issue first.

From a policy perspective, there are two ways of addressing the thorny issue
of individuals or groups who wish to wield power over others. The first is the
twin factors of religious faith and education: “Close investigation will show that
the primary cause of oppression and injustice, of unrighteousness, irregularity

50      THE JOURNAL OF BAHÁ’Í STUDIES                           11.1/2.2001

and disorder, is the people’s lack of religious faith and the fact that they are
uneducated” (‘Abdu’l-Bahá, Secret 18).

This suggests an interesting reason why, during the 1980s and 1990s, many
of the world’s most notorious and seemingly intractable dictatorships in Latin
America, Africa, and Asia have crumbled or given way to democratic regimes
of various kinds. Some of these national despots have been apprehended by an
emerging international justice system and brought to trial. A strong message is
now reverberating around the globe that the days of gross abuse of power with
impunity are numbered. Even though on the surface this development seems
quite miraculous, there has been little attempt to explain it. Of the two factors of
religious faith and education mentioned by ‘Abdu’l-Bahá in the above passage,
it would seem that education—although still grossly inadequate for many—may
be the reason many despotic regimes have collapsed over recent years. In one
sense, this has been an unintended consequence of education. It is very difficult
to subdue a growing educated population for long periods of time. Education
eventually leads to the exercising of collective will to bring about the struggle
for dignity and, ultimately, positive change. It might even be stated that as long
as education levels in a population are continually rising, as they are now in
most regions of the world, this creates a self-correcting feature in political
systems that acts to prevent totalitarian regimes from taking hold.

Arthur Lyon Dahl, in a book on environment, ecology, and the economy,
makes a strong case for the power of education to transform a population by
referring to the historical example of the educational reforms put into place in
France in the late nineteenth century by Jules Ferry, who was in charge of the
ministry of education. Faced with dramatic social and political changes that had
come about as a result of the French Revolution, Ferry’s task was to mold the
educational system so that the people were better able to live harmoniously in
the new republic. His efforts were a fantastic success, referred to often in history
books. Pertaining to the task at hand at this time, important work has been done
by Kavelin Popov, McLaughlin Nogouchi et al., Ayman, and others in
integrating moral education into the curriculum in North America and elsewhere.

Education is the most effective way to bring about lasting change, but there
are also certain structural changes at the institutional level that, once in place,
can prevent or seriously limit the capacity of individuals to have power over
others. Such changes include many of the features of the Bahá’í administrative
system which is designed to reduce or eliminate individual power. The
situating of authority squarely within the framework of elected institutions
rather than with individuals is one of these features. Arthur Lyon Dahl
suggests that another is the separation of inspirational (individual) leadership
from legislative and administrative aspects of governance. Other features of
the Bahá’í administrative system include the absence of political parties,
nominations, and political campaigning (and with it a distorted campaign

finance system), which are increasingly corrupting electoral systems in many
countries. A few of these changes have already been instituted in a limited sense
in some countries. One recent stellar example is the official elimination of
political parties in Uganda.

Limiting the blind pursuit of profit is possibly a longer endeavor than
preventing the emergence of individuals or groups who hold power. This is
because, for many people, accumulation of material wealth is tremendously
alluring. In extreme cases, the fantastic profits realized by some transnational
corporations have created vast wealth for the individuals who control those
corporations. This situation may persist for some time. Even if there were a
colossal crash of the world’s financial markets, it is likely that, as in the past,
the most wealthy would emerge fairly unscathed. Eliminating extremes of
wealth and poverty is one of the basic principles of the Bahá’í Revelation, and
the Bahá’í texts mention two main ways that this can be achieved. The first is
conscience—a deep and heartfelt understanding of the link among all people,
rich and poor. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá states: “Is it possible that, seeing one of his fellow-
creatures starving, destitute of everything, a man can rest and live comfortably
in his luxurious mansion? He who meets another in the greatest misery, can he
enjoy his fortune?” (Some Answered Questions 277). This kind of change can
only come about as a result of a profound transformation of the peoples of the
world, particularly among those who are currently wealthy. Education can play
a significant role in bringing about such change.

Associated with a growing consciousness of the oneness of humankind would
be a desire by people to exercise their responsibility, realized through the
second and related principle of voluntary sharing: “And among the teachings of
Bahá’u’lláh is voluntary sharing of one’s property with others among mankind.
This voluntary sharing is greater than [legally imposed] equality, and consists in
this, that man should not prefer himself to others, but rather should sacrifice his
life and property for others” (‘Abdu’l-Bahá, Selections 302). Once again we see
the role of human volition—in this case voluntary sharing of wealth as part of a
strategy for eliminating poverty—in development. 17 While at first glance it
might be tempting to dismiss voluntary giving as too altruistic for humanity to
achieve, we hope that previous discussions about human nature and the general
lack of understanding of the faculty of the human will might cast this pessimism
in a new light. Indeed, the kind of transformation referred to here is already
underway, as can be seen by recent reports of some of the world’s wealthiest
individuals offering to contribute large sums of money to the United Nations or
to fund international programs of the World Health Organization.

17. This does not mean there is no role for taxation. In fact, the Bahá’í writings specify a type of
progressive taxation as one means for eliminating extremes of wealth and poverty. For a recent
discussion of this, see Mohtadi.

Environmental Conservation. The most compelling question posed by the
environmental movement that needs to be tackled is how a theory of
development based on human dignity can possibly resolve the environmental
crisis. Although a thorough review of the literature on the environmental crisis
and the collective response to it is not appropriate here, we will draw upon a
few threads that are essential to supporting the dignity principle of develop-
ment that we are proposing. Much of the environmental crisis has been
attributed to the faulty workings of the now-dominant capitalist economic
system, since the real and long-term environmental costs have simply remained
unaccounted for as “externalities.” But those countries which adopted a Marxist
approach have an equally dismal record (starkly demonstrated by the
catastrophic demise of the Aral Sea in the former Soviet Union), as a result of
the fact that both the modernization and the Marxian approaches to economic
development are based on Western constructs that have promoted
undiscriminating extraction of resources and unfettered growth. It is partly for
this reason that the environmental movement has remained largely aloof from
both paradigms.

Since roughly the mid-nineteenth century, there have been a number of
attempts to reconcile humanity’s distorted relationship with nature. These
include deep ecology, social ecology, ecofeminism, the Judeo-Christian
tradition, North American native spirituality, and bioregionalism.18 Although
there are considerable differences among the means proposed by these various
movements for change, they are more or less united in their ultimate goal,
which is to reestablish a much-needed balance between humans and the natural
world. Some common themes that are relevant to this discussion can be gleaned
from these movements. First, all agree that there is an interdependence and
interconnectedness between humans and the rest of the natural world. Second,
most propose small, locally based systems of management and governance.
Social ecologist Murray Bookchin’s “libertarian municipalism” is a good
example of this (Biehl). This notion of locally based environmental
management fits conceptually within the civil-society-based paradigms such as
Korten’s and Friedmann’s, both of which make considerable mention of
environmental issues. Other marriages of environmental concerns with human-
based activities that focus on the North American context include frameworks
applied specifically to city planning such as those of Wackernagel and Rees,
and Marcia Nozick. Third, aside from some deep ecologists, there is agreement
among most of these approaches that although humans are an integral part of
creation, they are in some way different from other species and therefore have
special responsibilities. Although the Bahá’í writings present a “hierarchical”

18. For a fuller description of these movements and how they relate to a Bahá’í perspective, see
Lalonde; White; and Sours.

view of creation which asserts that human beings have attributes distinguishing
them from other creatures, the only logical interpretation of this is that humans
carry the commensurate responsibility of caring for the earth, a responsibility of
s t e w a r d s h i p .1 9 (Although we apparently share 98 percent of our genetic
material with apes, they will not help us much with this). The notion of
stewardship or trusteeship is also shared by most of the environmental
perspectives referred to above.

What, then, does environmental stewardship mean? In addition to
implementing individual lifestyle changes such as recycling, composting,
consuming less, carefully evaluating what is consumed, utilizing solar energy,
and relying on alternatives to the car, some with a deep commitment to
resolving the environmental crisis have chosen to work directly in the field. A
few have focused their attention on advocating to politicians and the public and
private sectors for change, others on the formulation and enforcement of
environmental regulations, the development of environmental planning
frameworks, the design of alternative low-impact technologies and production
systems, and the education of the public.

A few have taken on the task of developing alternatives to economic theory
that address the imbalances. It is out of this process that some of the most
stinging and soul-searching criticisms of the current economic system have
sprung. The Asian NGO Coalition, for example, sharply criticize the notion
that money has become “the arbiter of values and the motivating force of nearly
all human institutions and activities” and set forth a new approach based on
“spirituality, community, and a bonding to place or habitat” (“Economy Part I”
79). Lamenting the “dysfunctions of conventional development,” they propose a
community-based economy directed by the organizations of civil society, with
households and communities (instead of enterprises) as the basic units of
analysis and a “community balance sheet” that takes stock of natural resource
accounts as well as money accounts. Arthur Lyon Dahl offers a similar criticism
in his book, referred to earlier, that presents a theory of “ecos,” an application
of ecological principles to human systems. He claims that many problems
within human ecos are rooted in the overvaluation of money and the
undervaluation of people, and therefore that any new accounting system must
also incorporate knowledge and information, the most important attributes of
human ecos.

While individual and collectively based environmental activities such as
these are essential to achieving the ultimate goal of a more balanced
relationship between humans and nature, we propose they are insufficient.
Others, such as Dahl, have come to a similar conclusion. There are two main

54        THE JOURNAL OF BAHÁ’Í STUDIES                                     11.1/2.2001

reasons for this, both related to the notion of stewardship. The first is that
environmental stewardship is a sacred responsibility. Bahá’u’lláh writes the
following:

> . . . Nature in its essence is the embodiment of My Name, the Maker, the Creator. Its
> manifestations are diversified by varying causes, and in this diversity there are signs
> for men of discernment. Nature is God’s Will and is its expression in and through the
> contingent world. It is a dispensation of Providence ordained by the Ordainer, the All-
> Wise. (Tablets 142)

This view elevates the responsibility of caring for the earth above many other
responsibilities, and associates it directly with the very essence of the human
spirit. Caring for the earth can therefore be seen as one aspect of human
dignity. Combining the notions of interdependence and stewardship, it can be
proposed that one way humans fulfill their highest purpose is to act on the
conscious recognition of their oneness with the natural world. In this way, the
basic principles of kindness to animals, preservation of species diversity,
protection of delicate ecosystems, regard for as-yet unborn generations, and
appreciation for the beauty of nature all become components of the human
dignity principle.

The second reason environmentally based activities alone are insufficient is
that environmental stewardship is a collective human responsibility. A deep
concern for, and willingness to act on behalf of, the earth quickly leads to
intense interaction with other people. Resolution of the environmental crisis is
squarely in the human arena, subject to all the current limitations and challenges
of collective decision making, organizational functioning, institution building,
and governance. Specialists in several fields, such as city planning, have
already recognized that environmental issues cannot be dealt with in an
effective manner separately from issues related to governance. On the global
level, the organizational and decision-making challenges faced are enormous, as
can be seen in the increasingly regular global meetings on environmental issues
where the developing countries are seen to be doing too little about population
control and lax environmental regulations while the industrialized countries
stall on limiting greenhouse gas emissions and exporting toxic waste.20

All of the skills associated with collective human will must be drawn upon in
order to address the root causes of the environmental crisis, one of the gravest
signs so far seen of human civilization gone awry. Environmental issues, while
they are of an admittedly urgent nature demanding immediate attention, will

20. Some who are of the Marxian persuasion have recognized this problem and have, with limited
success, attempted to unite the “green” (environmental) and “red” (leftist) causes. Evidence of this
was seen during the Seattle protests of late 1999 associated with the World Trade Organization
meetings.

ultimately be resolved only when they are fully integrated with human
development issues. It is in this way that the struggle for dignity as the driving
principle of development directly addresses the environmental crisis.

Gender Equality. The notion that development consists of the collective
process of striving for dignity drawing upon the faculty of the human will is not
inherently inconsistent with what the women’s movement has been trying to
achieve within various development paradigms. On the surface, it is obvious
that any approach with the aim of promoting human dignity must include half
of the world’s population. Nonetheless, this assertion requires some
explanation.

Although the women’s movement has been in existence in the world in some
form for at least a century and a half, the movement has historically traveled
different paths in the industrialized and the developing countries. Conceptually,
Western feminists have been primarily concerned with sexual equality in terms
of opportunity and status. In the developing countries, women’s persistent
subordination to men in all areas of life has been the greatest concern. However,
growing poverty among women and children in the industrialized countries and
increasing worldwide recognition of violence against women have been
powerful uniting forces. In addition, there have been attempts to “wed”
feminism with other schools of thought. One is ecofeminism, mentioned earlier,
which promotes the view that environmental destruction is the result of male
domination over nature. Recognition of the subordinate status of women all
over the world as a social justice issue has led to attempts to merge feminism
with Marxism.21 Some have referred to this as an “unhappy marriage,” since
the promise of improved status for women in socialist countries was not
fulfilled. The distinction between modernization and Marxism has therefore not
been a very useful one in addressing the gender question.

On the policy side, following the early struggles for voting rights, the focus
in North America has been on improving the status of women in the work force
relative to men, and on women’s legal, reproductive, and property rights in the
private sphere of the household. As a result, many hard-won legislative changes
have been made in pay equity, human rights law, and property law. These
changes have resulted in considerable improvements in women’s lives,
particularly with respect to economic independence. European women’s groups
have, along with these concerns, tended to place a heavy emphasis on the
societal responsibilities associated with childcare, as reflected in public policy
in many countries which now provide subsidized, accessible daycare and
flexible work arrangements.

Moser has characterized policy approaches to the gender question in the

developing countries as having evolved very much in parallel with general
trends in the modernization paradigm outlined earlier. Welfare approaches were
associated with the growth-oriented strategies of the 1950s and 1960s.
Consisting mainly of emergency and food aid given out mainly to women
because of their roles as mothers, the welfare approach led later to population
control through family planning programs. It was at this time that Esther
Boserup, in her famous book published in 1970, observed that although women
constituted an enormous resource for achieving development goals, they were
essentially invisible in the process. This insight led to an approach known as
Women in Development (WID) that consisted of programs focusing on
employment and credit to assist women to better integrate into the development
process. A second response to the realization that women matter was the
collection of statistics on women as part of the regular process of reporting on
development, a practice now well established but which still needs improvement.
During the 1970s, WID caught on in many of the bilateral aid agencies, which
initially adopted a Western-style goal of achieving equity for women relative to
men in the development process. But there were inherent difficulties in defining
equity that led to a lack of consensus within the aid agencies as well as among
women’s groups on how to implement it. Consequently, equity was dropped in
the mid-1970s and replaced with an anti-poverty WID approach, which arose
from a growing concern, within the modernization paradigm, for basic needs.
But the small-scale “income-generating projects” intended to reduce women’s
poverty that were the main thrust of this policy proved more difficult to
implement than anticipated. It was found that even if women’s incomes rose,
their quality of life did not necessarily improve, as long as the work had to be
done by extending the working day or if the income they earned came under the
control of men. Parallel with the neoliberal policies of the 1980s and 1990s, the
third and current WID approach has become part of a larger thrust toward
efficiency, promoted primarily by international agencies. Reduced funding in
health, education, and other social services promoted by these agencies has had
a disproportionate impact on women and children, who rely upon them more,
and it is women who are often the major participants in the voluntary
organizations that are expected to shoulder these responsibilities.

Empowerment, the final approach, is firmly based on a different perspective
called Gender and Development (GAD) that arose from criticisms of WID as an
add-on to the modernization paradigm and its preoccupation with efficiency.
GAD addressed the relationship between men and women as an inherent
component of the problem. What this meant was looking beyond women as a
category or special target group for development programs and policies, to the
social and historical construction of how and why women tend to be
subordinated to men in a particular society. GAD, while it is considered to be
largely outside of the mainstream, has been practiced by many non-Western

Third World women’s groups since the 1980s. This perspective is exemplified
by Development Alternatives with Women for a New Era (DAWN), a loosely
structured network of Third World women’s organizations which, in a paper
prepared for the 1985 World Conference of Women in Nairobi, stated that its
vision of the new era was one where “each person will have the opportunity to
develop her or his potential and creativity, and women’s values of nurturance
and solidarity will characterize human relationships” (73). The means for
achieving this, according to DAWN, was empowerment through organization
from the bottom up, as well as the fulfillment of practical and strategic gender
needs.

It will be recognized that the empowerment approach to women and
development is affiliated closely with the civil-society-based paradigm
discussed earlier. Like David Korten’s approach, the active agent is seen to be
the people’s organization. Of all the approaches so far discussed, the women’s
perspective on empowerment comes very close to addressing the need to
reformulate the concept of power as a tool in development. Moser writes that
the empowerment approach “acknowledges the importance for women to
increase their power. However, it seeks to identify power less in terms of
domination over others (with its implicit assumption that a gain for women
implies a loss for men), and more in terms of the capacity of women to increase
their own self-reliance and internal strength” (74). What this implies is that the
emancipation of women entails a struggle not between women and men, but for
the ultimate triumph of the human spirit—the struggle for dignity.

Two other important additional aspects of the dignity principle as it relates to
the gender question can be mentioned. One is the balance between the
masculine and feminine in society, mentioned in the DAWN statement, but also
found in the Bahá’í writings: “. . . the new age will be an age less masculine and
more permeated with the feminine ideals. . . .” (‘Abdu’l-Bahá, qtd. in Esslemont
149).22 Another is the participation of men in the emancipation of women,
without which their own potential cannot be fulfilled: “As long as women are
prevented from attaining their highest possibilities, so long will men be unable

22. The concept of balance referred to by ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, however, contains the clear assumption
of a distinction between men and women that goes beyond reproductive functions. Consequently,
the Bahá’í writings refer to equality based on complementarity, not uniformity. While this is
acceptable to most women as well as many feminists, it is an understanding not shared by some
Western feminists who believe that the case for equality of women with men must be presented as
one based on a presumption of sameness. This position springs from fear that any mention of
gender differences (whether real or apparent) will be used as proof of inferiority and as a
justification for preventing the advancement of women. While this fear is understandable, the
position taken may not be necessary. It also entails some dangers, particularly if scientific
evidence indicating biologically based distinctions that affect functions other than reproduction

to achieve the greatness which might be theirs” (‘Abdu’l-Bahá, Paris Talks
133).23 “When men own the equality of women there will be no need for them
to struggle for their rights!” (‘Abdu’l-Bahá, Paris Talks 163).

Theory in Action: Development and the Bahá’í Community
While not a major force in thinking on development at this time, since the late
nineteenth century Bahá’ís have been putting into practice principles for
carrying forward “an ever-advancing civilization” (Bahá’u’lláh, Gleanings 215)
enunciated by the founder of the Bahá’í Faith, Bahá’u’lláh. Although these
principles do not spell out a specific theory, the history of the Bahá’í Faith over
more than 150 years itself exemplifies a unique approach to development. One
of the distinctive historical features of the Bahá’í Faith, the most recent of the
world’s great religions, is that the period of revelation of the authoritative texts
containing these principles lasted more than seventy-five years, including the
Writings of Bahá’u’lláh Himself and ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, His eldest son and
designated interpreter. It was in 1921 that Shoghi Effendi, grandson of ‘Abdu’l-
Bahá and appointed leader of the Faith, was entrusted with the herculean task of
building the foundation for Bahá’u’lláh’s “world order,” a spiritual democracy
comprising elected councils (or “Spiritual Assemblies”) at the local and national
level. These institutions were responsible for leading the growth of the
community, encouraging individual development, and establishing an essential
pattern of internal practices at the local level such as regular consultative and
spiritual meetings and religious anniversaries, the education of children, and
annual elections. In 1983, the Universal House of Justice, the internationally
elected institution of the global Bahá’í community, ordained by Bahá’u’lláh and
established twenty years earlier, issued the letter to the Bahá’í world quoted at
the beginning of this paper. This letter stated that “although it [had] hitherto
been impracticable for Bahá’í institutions generally to emphasize development
activities, the concept of social and economic development is enshrined in the
sacred Teachings of [the] Faith.” It announced the establishment of an
international Office of Social and Economic Development, and the National
Spiritual Assemblies were invited to “consider the implications of this emerging
trend for their respective communities,” but the emphasis from the outset was,
as stated earlier, on “natural stirrings at the grassroots.” The letter advised that
“the steps to be taken must necessarily begin in the Bahá’í Community itself....”
The aim of the Bahá’ís was “to uplift themselves and thus become self-
sufficient and self-reliant,” and their efforts toward this end would “conduce to
the preservation of human honor so desired by Bahá’u’lláh.” It was anticipated
that “in the process and as a consequence, the [Bahá’ís] will undoubtedly extend
the benefits of their efforts to society as a whole. . . .” (Messages 379.2, 6, 3).

Since then, development projects and programs have been established in
local Bahá’í communities all over the world. Many of these focus on education,
an endeavor of great importance to Bahá’u’lláh, which is itself expected to have
enormous ramifications; others focus on development communication, health,
the environment, agriculture, and rural development, as well as race unity,
cultural development, and development of women. Although some have
evolved to become larger-scale projects and are carried out in collaboration
with other institutions and agencies, most are small and have received little or
no outside funding assistance.

This history itself illustrates some basic principles, three of which are shared
with other empowerment perspectives on development. The first is the
centrality of grassroots development; the second is building local institutional
capacity; and the third is self-reliance. Other principles are unique: the
explicitly stated significance of “human honor” or dignity, the establishment of
patterns of community life as prerequisites for development, the supporting role
of higher-level institutions in this process, and the importance of Bahá’í
communities learning how to experiment in their own communities before the
natural process of outreach beyond the Bahá’í community. Perhaps the most
striking feature about this history is that while stirrings at the grassroots is the
central principle, the entire process—from the directions of Shoghi Effendi to
the letters of the Universal House of Justice—was planned. This is a result of
the uniqueness of the Bahá’í administrative system, with its interrelated parts
extending from the local to the international level. In order to understand how
stirrings at the grassroots can be guided from above, one must appreciate that
the Bahá’í community is not a social or political movement, but a religious
community. At the core of Bahá’í belief is obedience to what is understood to
be in the Bahá’í texts, which represent a vast resource for study. Unlike policy
documents, internal memos, or even manifestos, these texts are considered by
Bahá’ís to be authoritative truth. Understanding and acting on them is not
optional. Equally important is obedience to Bahá’í institutions. Although there
is not always agreement among individuals about appropriate steps to take in
responding to guidance from higher institutions or in identifying and solving
problems at the community level, the willingness to be obedient to local and
national institutions is a powerful unifying force.

Other principles pertaining to development are mentioned in the Bahá’í texts.

They include the importance of individual rectitude of conduct, particularly
trustworthiness; the preservation of unity in all endeavors; a spirit of
selflessness and service; consultation; building of local capacity; a learning
framework consisting of study of the texts, consultation, action, and reflection;
development of human resources; universal participation, especially by women;
and the building of institutions, particularly the elected Local and National
Spiritual Assemblies. All of these and others are referred to in letters from the

60        THE JOURNAL OF BAHÁ’Í STUDIES                                       11.1/2.2001

Bahá’í World Centre 24 and many are elaborated on by Holly Hanson Vick
(Social and Economic Development).

These principles, acted upon by community members striving for personal
betterment and collective unity with a shared vision and belief in the authority
of the texts and the Bahá’í institutions, provide a powerful force for
development and change. They work in tandem with certain structural features
of the system already mentioned, such as the separation of inspirational and
legislative/administrative functions and absence of electoral campaigning. In
addition is a mechanism already in place within the Bahá’í community for
redistributing wealth known as H. uqúqu’lláh, an obligatory annual monetary
donation by adults of approximately one-fifth the value of marginal savings.25

For these reasons, it could be stated that the Bahá’í model, with its emphasis
on civil society, organization building, education, and morality, is centered on
development with empowerment. However, a neat classification is not so easy.
The model also has elements of development with freedom. Profit-making
enterprises, although they are not currently emphasized in Bahá’í development,
are not prohibited. Private property and the creation of wealth are also not
proscribed, if the pursuit of either is exercised in moderation and in a spirit of
sharing. The Bahá’í model shares the goal of development with justice—the
elimination of oppression—but the means for achieving it is not through
conflict, but the power of the collective human will in striving for dignity and
unity.

In terms of grassroots development within the Bahá’í community,
Bahá’u’lláh’s explanation of human nature as it affects this process has already
been described. Bahá’ís, like others, collectively strive for dignity and, in so
doing, improve the quality of their lives. But for Bahá’ís, there is a deeper
meaning to the concept of dignity. True fulfillment of human potential involves
not only aspirations related to self-respect, but two other very important
elements: acting upon the recognition of the oneness of the human race, and
service. The principle of oneness is related to David Korten’s idea of “global
citizenship” and “critical consciousness” and is, in fact, the central teaching of
Bahá’u’lláh, enunciated over a century ago. A complex subject dealt with
extensively by Bahá’u’lláh, it arises out of the diversity of the human race. Not
only is the global Bahá’í community diverse, but most local communities are
composed of people with widely varying class, ethnic, and religious
backgrounds. The central purpose of the Bahá’í Faith is to forge these diverse

peoples into one unified human race, a unity similar to that found in the human
body constituted by its functional component parts: “He Who is your Lord, the
All-Merciful, cherisheth in His heart the desire of beholding the entire human
race as one soul and one body” (Bahá’u’lláh, Gleanings 214).

A concise explanation of this concept can be found in the writings of Shoghi
Effendi:

> Far from aiming at the subversion of the existing foundations of society, [the
> principle of the oneness of humanity] seeks to broaden its basis, to remold its
> institutions in a manner consonant with the needs of an ever-changing world. It can
> conflict with no legitimate allegiances, nor can it undermine essential loyalties. Its
> purpose is neither to stifle the flame of a sane and intelligent patriotism in men’s
> hearts, nor to abolish the system of national autonomy so essential if the evils of
> excessive centralization are to be avoided. It does not ignore, nor does it attempt to
> suppress, the diversity of ethnical origins, of climate, of history, of language and
> tradition, of thought and habit, that differentiate the peoples and nations of the world.
> It calls for a wider loyalty, for a larger aspiration than any that has animated the
> human race. It insists upon the subordination of national impulses and interests to the
> imperative claims of a unified world. It repudiates excessive centralization on one
> hand, and disclaims all attempts at uniformity on the other. Its watchword is unity in
> diversity. (41–42)

The second aspect, service, is more than simple volunteerism; it is a much
higher calling, enjoined by Bahá’u’lláh Himself: “That one indeed is a man
who, today, dedicateth himself to the service of the entire human race. The
Great Being saith: Blessed and happy is he that ariseth to promote the best
interests of the peoples and kindreds of the earth” (Gleanings 250). Service is a
form of worship and prayer: “Briefly, all effort and exertion put forth by man
from the fullness of his heart is worship, if it is prompted by the highest motives
and the will to do service to humanity. This is worship: to serve mankind and to
minister to the needs of the people. Service is prayer” (‘Abdu’l-Bahá, Paris
Talks 176–77). Service is nearness to God: “For service in love for mankind is
unity with God. He who serves has already entered the Kingdom and is seated
at the right hand of his Lord” (‘Abdu’l-Bahá, Promulgation 186). Reflecting on
these lofty ideals and striving to enact them in individual and community life
creates an energized atmosphere for transformation.

Because the Bahá’í community is a religious community, a new dimension
reinforces the potential of the human will in striving for dignity. It has already
been mentioned that all the great religions teach the submission of the human
will to the will of the Creator. Believing this means believing in having access
to a power much greater than what resides within human beings: “By the
righteousness of God, should a man, all alone, arise in the name of Bahá and
put on the armor of his love, him will the Almighty cause to be victorious,

62      THE JOURNAL OF BAHÁ’Í STUDIES                          11.1/2.2001

though the forces of earth and heaven be arrayed against him” (Bahá’u’lláh, qtd.
in Shoghi Effendi 106).

Accessing this power, however, is essentially a mystical process that involves
abandoning all self-interest: “O SON OF MAN! If thou lovest Me, turn away from
thyself; and if thou seekest My pleasure, regard not thine own; that thou mayest
die in Me and I may eternally live in thee” (Bahá’u’lláh, Hidden Words, Arabic
no. 7). For the Bahá’í community, the belief that divine power can be harnessed
for the betterment of human life on this planet is tremendously inspiring both on
an individual and a collective level, and is a galvanizing force for positive
action far beyond what the human will, unaided, can achieve.

Stirrings at the Grassroots and the Dignity Principle: Lessons,
Prescriptions, and Propositions
Contributions to understanding the descriptive dynamics of the dignity principle
at the grassroots level have been made by all three paradigms—development
with freedom, justice, and empowerment. This gives rise to some very basic
theoretical propositions as well as some prescriptions for action in
implementing this principle.

The profit motive may be evident in many grassroots development efforts. To
the extent that making a profit is one of the objectives of a development project
or program, there is much that has been learned. This is the primary
contribution of development with freedom. Lessons learned about stirrings at
the grassroots within this model include the need for access to finance, effective
financial management, market analysis, and an efficient distribution
infrastructure. In cases where profit-making enterprises are being utilized as a
tool for development, there is growing evidence that lessons learned about
business development and management must be combined with other factors.
This point has been explained persuasively by Barbara Rodey in a series of
reports on microfinance. In one of them, she refers to five basic principles
which can be seen as components of the underlying dignity principle being
discussed here: building capacity, involvement of women, reinforcement of
traditional ways of life, ownership at the grassroots, and building a sense of
community. The connection of these factors with success in microfinance
projects lends support to the proposition that the pursuit of profit results in
development with freedom if it is based on the struggle for dignity.

In formulating projects and programs at the local level, people will often be
faced with lack of assistance or even resistance from higher authorities, either in
the public or private sectors. This may from time to time necessitate advocacy
activities on the part of the project participants. Some understanding of how
these higher authorities have evolved historically and how they might be
approached can be gleaned from the Marxian perspective on development with
justice. In confronting justice and equity issues, adherence to the dignity

principle for grassroots development organizations would mean that in taking
necessary actions with higher-level institutions, the dignity of individuals and
the integrity of organizations is not compromised. For example, a community-
based organization might need to meet with government officials to secure land
for a housing project. Following the dignity principle means that offering
bribes, making a proposal that might place other similar organizations at a clear
disadvantage, agreeing to political or electoral support of any kind in exchange,
or engaging in other actions that compromise the basic virtues of honesty,
forthrightness, and trustworthiness would not be entertained since they
jeopardize the dignity of individuals involved and that of the organization as a
whole. This is a difficult path to tread, and the appropriate steps to take under
the changing and unique sets of circumstances all organizations encounter
would not always be clear. Holding to the dignity principle might also
sometimes involve difficult short-term sacrifices.

A word needs to be said about structural change including at the global level.

Institutional change among agencies, authorities, and governments, although of
vital importance, is not a reasonable primary role for organizations geared to
development activities at the community level. It has already been stated that
the long-term means for assuring social justice are education, certain structural
changes in governance that militate against totalitarianism, and an infusion of
the dignity principle throughout societal processes from the ground up, but
other factors come to bear as well. The Bahá’í writings outline three main
actors in the broader process of societal change—individuals in key positions,
governing institutions, and the people themselves: “. . . when the pure intentions
and the justice of the ruler, the wisdom and consummate skill and statecraft of
the governing authorities, and the determination and unstinted efforts of the
people, are all combined; then day by day the effects of the advancement, of the
far-reaching reforms, of the pride and prosperity of government and people
alike, will become clearly manifest” (‘Abdu’l-Bahá, Secret 108).

National- or regional-level civil society organizations, as organs of “the
people” can play an important role here.26 They comprise part of a process that
is essentially an organic one, where interplay among all three components—
leaders, institutions, and the people—results in change. Such an organic view of
societal development is found in the Bahá’í writings:

26. For a discussion of a typology of NGOs and their various current roles and functions, see
Vakil, “Confronting the Classification Problem.” Appropriate roles for these higher-level
organizations in transforming themselves and other institutions such as government and
international aid organizations represents a very important subject for research. A potential case
study of strategies and practices associated with the dignity principle as they pertain to higher-level
NGOs can be found in the Bahá’í International Community, the representative agency of the world
Bahá’í community with nongovernmental status at the United Nations.

The world of politics is like the world of man; he is seed at first, and then passes by
> degrees to the condition of embryo and foetus, acquiring a bone structure, being
> clothed with flesh, taking on his own special form, until at last he reaches the plane
> where he can befittingly fulfill the words: “the most excellent of Makers.” Just as this
> is a requirement of creation and is based on the universal Wisdom, the political world
> in the same way cannot instantaneously evolve from the nadir of defectiveness to the
> zenith of rightness and perfection. (‘Abdu’l-Bahá, Secret 107)

However, for all three actors—key individuals, institutions, and people at
large—the struggle for dignity must permeate their efforts if these are to be
rendered successful: “The spiritually learned must be characterized by both
inward and outward perfections; they must possess a good character, an
enlightened nature, a pure intent, as well as intellectual power, brilliance and
discernment, intuition, discretion and foresight, temperance, reverence and a
heartfelt fear of God” (‘Abdu’l-Bahá, Secret 33–34).

The ultimate achievement of social justice is therefore not a simple process,
and only a part of it pertains to stirrings at the grassroots. This leads to the
proposition that, at all levels, it is the struggle for human dignity that results in
development with justice, not the struggle for power.

Much has also been learned from development with empowerment. Indeed
many of the tools associated with the dignity principle were identified through
this approach. Among the lessons learned are the importance of tapping into the
resource of indigenous culturally based knowledge, utilizing cultural forms of
expression as inspirational and educational tools, and acquiring the skills
needed to build effective organizations. Much has been written within this
paradigm on these factors. It is also within an empowerment paradigm that
traditional notions of power involving domination and the assumption of win-
lose outcomes, have been questioned. This is most clearly acknowledged in the
Bahá’í model: “At the heart of the matter here is the empowerment of the
masses of humanity. This must of necessity occur at the grassroots level. For
Bahá’ís, the manner in which authority is collectively exercised by local and
national Bahá’í administrative institutions provides a glimpse of how power can
be constructively tapped and channeled for the benefit of individuals and
communities.”27

The Bahá’í community offers some interesting examples, some of which are
not well known at this time, of how the dignity principle can be applied within
an empowerment framework. We will refer to only two of these. Planning
Progress, June Manning Thomas’s book on what can be learned about
community-based planning from Shoghi Effendi, describes the historical growth
and development of the global Bahá’í community by providing an outline of his
plans, communications, and leadership style that can be seen as a blueprint for

27. Bahá’í International Community to Anna C. Vakil, 18 November 1998.

positive change in many contexts. Thomas initially provides some guidelines
derived from the Writings of Bahá’u’lláh and ‘Abdu’l-Bahá that include features
not normally associated with planning, such as inspiration and encouragement,
faith, love and unity, and detachment from materialism. She then goes on to
describe Shoghi Effendi’s unique approach to systematically fostering human
dignity through creating a vision, developing goals and strategies, and
monitoring implementation of plans. The attributes of Shoghi Effendi’s
approach have significant implications for moral leadership in community-
based development.28 Among other things, they include constant reference to
the vision for change, the nurturing of the individual, generous use of praise and
encouragement, and strong commitment to the plan through personal example.

Another example that has attracted some attention in the field of development
communication is an extremely successful Bahá’í radio station in Ecuador
described in a case study by Kurt Hein. Its programming, conducted mostly in
the Quechua language and aimed at an indigenous listening audience in the
Andean region of Ecuador, includes traditional music, locally based news and
public announcements, as well as education in agriculture, health, sanitation,
and nutrition. Hein describes the success of the station as being related to the
following factors: direct access of the listeners to the station and its programs,
participation that involved extensive training of local people as staff and
volunteers, locally based management, fostering of local leadership,
commitment to local culture and language, radio as an appropriate technology
for the region, appropriate technical standards suitable to the listeners that
included indigenous radio voices, low cost (including the construction of the
station which relied on local resources), and a spirit of service.

There is a vast reservoir of knowledge on effective methods of implementing
the dignity principle in stirrings at the grassroots that can be used in
development, drawing from all three traditions of freedom, justice, and
empowerment. This is only a preliminary list:29

> • use of beauty both in the arts and in nature as an inspirational tool

activities
• conscious acknowledgement and development of virtues such as

Conclusion
The prevailing approaches to development with respect to stirrings at the
grassroots have fallen lamentably short of their stated goals since they lack the
appropriate foundation in a theory of human nature that is based on human
dignity. Neither the profit motive alone nor the quest for power—the driving
forces within modernization and Marxism, respectively—has resulted in real
and sustainable development, and both have inherent dangers. Development
with freedom has focused on economic freedom, with the paradoxical end result
that all have become enslaved by the economy. Transnational corporations are
free to move wherever labor costs are low and environmental regulations are
lax.30 Meanwhile in many communities, people go hungry when there is more
than enough food to feed everyone. Even those who care deeply about this
disparity are powerless to do much. This is not freedom. Development with
justice has resulted not in justice but, at best, a temporary façade that masquerades
as justice. Even when movements acting on behalf of the people manage to seize
power, the force and violence they have used to achieve power often lead to
their undoing. This is a far cry from justice. Development with empowerment
incorporates many of the processes and methods necessary for human dignity to
flourish, but it needs to be disentangled from traditional notions of power.

As the elements of the dignity principle at the grassroots level are explored,
experimented with, and developed, it may eventually be seen that, along with
other mechanisms at higher levels, this new foundation helps fulfill the goals of
all the current models as we have described them here—freedom, justice, and
empowerment. Theory and action centering on the struggle for dignity can
eventually result in these seemingly contradictory approaches converging into a

single theory and unified set of policy tools, unencumbered by false distinctions
between industrialized and developing nations, unconfined by the barriers that
divide the different scholarly disciplines, freed from the confines of political
and economic ideologies, unrestrained by misleading conceptions of expertise
that ignore the wisdom and knowledge of masses of people and prevent them
from having input into the decisions that affect them, and released from the
confusion and disillusionment created by a notion of human nature that has so
far focused almost exclusively on the lower aspect of what it is to be human.

This paper began with an examination of stirrings at the grassroots as the
current emphasis of Bahá’í development and an empirical phenomenon now
widely documented in research and practice. The recognition that this
phenomenon is not adequately explained by the dominant theories of develop-
ment is essentially a window for questioning the viability of development
theory in general. Additional windows—or, better stated, holes—in these major
perspectives can be found as well. Two were briefly dealt with in this paper and
have been extensively addressed by others—the challenge posed to develop-
ment processes by environmental conservation and the persistent inequality of
women and men. A third was touched on: globalization. A fourth was initially
stated as an assumption: that development is a universal process but one that,
due to historical contingencies, has been splintered into separate analyses of
what applies to the industrialized countries and the developing countries. This is
a false dichotomy that needs to be addressed, since there is very little work in
this area. Finally, the field of ethical development represents an excellent
opportunity for discourse about human nature and values in development. All
five need more exploration from the perspective of how the Bahá’í teachings
can inform a theory of development.

The framework proposed here, with the struggle for dignity as the organizing
principle and the human will as the force that propels it, is a potentially useful
one. It is firmly grounded in a theory of human nature that can be applied at
both the individual and collective levels. It can be understood and analyzed
from a number of different disciplinary perspectives. It acknowledges what has
been learned from the past. It is consistent with basic ideas about human nature
taught by all the major religions. At the same time, it is comprehensible by
ordinary people on a rather common-sense level. People know they can strive
for a higher state, and they know they can exercise the will to achieve it if they
choose to. This point is of vital importance. If people everywhere are to become
intimately involved in, and to direct, the development process, it is essential that
the basic dynamics of that process are comprehensible to them.

It is also important that development workers in various areas of practice can
identify with the principles. Currently, there is a major disjuncture between
what most people working in the development field at the grassroots level
accept as experiential knowledge about community-based development

68        THE JOURNAL OF BAHÁ’Í STUDIES                                       11.1/2.2001

processes, and paradigms that are incapable of incorporating this knowledge
(principally modernization and Marxian approaches). Experiential knowledge
referred to here includes such things as community participation, consultative
skills, and involvement of women. Profit and power as the sole attributes of
human motivation are clearly inadequate explanatory and prescriptive tools.
When the notion of the struggle for dignity is incorporated, this experiential
knowledge begins to fall into place.

What has been presented in this paper is a skeleton that needs more flesh.

There are implications for a number of areas of scholarly study that were only
superficially touched on in this discussion. One is a more thorough textual
analysis of Bahá’í and other religious texts on the basic principles of nobility
and volition, as well as the relationship between volition and the will of God
and how these concepts relate to development. This is an area appropriate for
those interested in religious studies and philosophy. Implications for
psychology include the need for a greater understanding of the dynamics of the
human will and how it influences human behavior. 31 The mobilization of
collective will, usually studied by sociologists, is an area that needs major
reexamination. The historical concentration on conflict has likely been
exhausted and needs to give way to a new exploration of how people can
effectively work together and overcome conflict on a collective level in order to
resolve problems. Related to this, also, is the rapidly growing applied field of
conflict resolution, which has implications far beyond individual disputes in the
courts,32 as well as small group consultation, where a significant contribution
has been made by Bahá’ís in particular due to the extraordinary emphasis
placed on consultation in the Bahá’í writings.33 An increased understanding of
the dynamics of development processes has direct implications for further study
and application in the field of human rights.34 The study of social change as it
affects national and global development, only briefly touched on in this
discussion, would be significantly advanced by a thorough textual analysis of
‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s Secret of Divine Civilization, an exercise begun by Saiedi.
There are also enormous implications for the field of education, especially
moral education, some of which were referred to in this paper.

The framework for development outlined in this paper has the largest
implications for the field of neoclassical economics. The implications are
twofold. The first has to do with the need to incorporate the notion of human
dignity into the technical aspect of economics, particularly theories of value and

31. An additional implication of understanding the human will is for the study of science itself and
the possible existence of laws other than cause-and-effect. See note 15.

utility within microeconomics.35 Whether it will be possible to do so remains to
be seen, but effort needs to be expended toward this end nonetheless. The
establishment of the Society for Socio-Economics 3 5 is an encouraging
development in this regard. The second implication, related to the first, has to
do with the place economics has historically occupied relative to other actors
within the domain of development “expertise.” Economists have held dominion
here because, of all the social sciences, the “dismal science” deals the least with
variables relating to humans. While this may seem paradoxical, it has enabled
them, in the words of economist Gregory Dahl, to “take refuge in self-
consistent theoretical worlds of highly simplified models or in empirical,
mechanistic worlds of regression analysis and statistics, all comprehensible
only to themselves” (“Economics” 1–2). Reverence for the rarefied world of
numbers by powerful decision makers in governments and international
agencies involved in development needs to give way to a more balanced
process where economists might take their place alongside other professionals,
NGOs, religious and spiritual leaders, as well as ordinary people. Economists,
on their part, need to actively work toward this outcome as well. Happily, such
movement is already happening, as shown by the recent Dialogue on World
Faiths and Development organized by the World Bank in London in 1998.
Interestingly, the motivation comes not only from the extraordinary recognition
that development needs to be informed by the accumulated knowledge of the
world’s great religions, but it also springs from the realization that establishing
efficiency as the sole goal of development within the modernization paradigm,
with its concomitant underutilization of most of the human resources on the
planet, has itself proved to be inefficient!

Putting into practice the principle of fostering the struggle for dignity that
draws on the power of the human will is a necessary step toward a development
that is real and sustainable. However, these mechanisms become fortified and
much more potent when they are permeated with belief in God. The Bahá’í
community’s history with development illustrates how much more powerful
this model becomes when it is infused with the conviction that individual and
collective efforts operating according to a divinely revealed set of principles
within the framework of a spiritual democracy are reinforced by the Primal
Will. The framework proposed in this paper can be understood without
acceptance or belief in a Creator. Concepts like dignity and the human will are
digestible without this. However, it is interesting to note that the reason people
understand these ideas is the accumulated impacts throughout time of the great

35. Work has already been done on a joint utility function, based on Becker, primarily as a

religions, which are themselves the source of this understanding. As ‘Abdu’l-
Bahá has stated:

There are some who imagine that an innate sense of human dignity will prevent
> man from committing evil actions and insure his spiritual and material perfection.
> That is, that an individual who is characterized with natural intelligence, high resolve,
> and a driving zeal, will, without any consideration for the severe punishments
> consequent on evil acts, or for the great rewards of righteousness, instinctively refrain
> from inflicting harm on his fellow men and will hunger and thirst to do good. And
> yet, if we ponder the lessons of history it will become evident that this very sense of
> honor and dignity is itself one of the bounties deriving from the instructions of the
> Prophets of God. (Secret 97)
