INTRODUCTION                                        
  
The large  influx of Iranians  into  Los   Angeles  since the second half of  
the 1970s  has  added  a sizeable and   distinctive  minority to the population of  
this metropolitan area.  According to  the  1980  U.S. Census,  about a quarter of  
the  nation's Iranian population resided  in  Los Angeles,2  making it the largest  
single concentration  of Iranians in  the  United  States.  In  spite of the rapid  
growth  of  the  Iranian  population  in   Los  Angeles  and  the  U.S., published  
material  on  this immigrant group is  meager (Ansari 1977;  Askari  et  al. 1977;  
Gilanshah  1986; Iran  Times 1983, 1984;  Lorentz and Wertime  1980;  Momeni 1984;  
Moslehi 1984).                                                                             
One  of  the  distinctive features  of   Iranian immigration to  the  United  
States  and  Los  Angeles is that it occurred before  and  after a revolution that  
altered  substantially  social  and political  conditions   in Iran.  It  may   be  
argued  that    these  two  groups  of  immigrants had  very different motives for  
leaving  their  country,   thus resulting  in  different statistical profiles  for  
each  group.  The  later wave must have included  a substantial  number of politi-  
cal  refugees and exiles as contrasted  to  the  earlier wave of students and eco-  
nomically   motivated immigrants.   While Iranians who arrived in  the  U.S. after  
the Iranian revolution were not officially  admitted  as  "parolees"  or refugees,  
the lives  and welfare of many of them were affected just  as  adversely   as  the  
well-being    of  the official refugees from  Cuba  or  Vietnam.   Therefore,  the  
status  of  Iranian  exiles  has  a  sociological rather than a legal or political  
basis (Suhrke 1983).                                                                       
The  main  objective  of   this  paper is  to use the Iranian  case to  test  
three   hypotheses  about the demographic,  religious,  and  socioeconomic differ-  
ences  between  immigrants and political refugees or  exiles,  which  are commonly  
found  in  the  literature.  These  hypotheses will  be tested  by using data from  
the  1980 U.S. Census  Public Use Microdata  Sample for the 1975-80  and  the pre-  
1975  Iranian immigrant  cohorts.    While  the  pre-1975 cohort  includes  mainly  
Iranians who came  to  the  United States  for study,  for a  visit, or  for work,  
the  1975-80 cohort is made  up of  these types  of immigrants  as well  as exiles  
or  political  refugees  who  fled  Iran after  the 1978 revolution. Of course, if  
census  data  were  available  by  single  year of immigration,  we   would   have  
selected  instead  the  post-revolution  period of 1978-80 and  the pre-revolution  
years  prior  to  1978.  Nevertheless,  because the Immigration and Naturalization  
Service  (INS)  data indicate  that  over  half of Iranian arrivals during 1975-80  
occurred  after  the  revolution,3   it  may  be assumed that  half of this recent  
cohort is made up of exiles or political refugees.                                    
The  differences in  the demographic, social, and economic characteristics  
of  economic  immigrants and  political refugees or exiles have been  discussed or  
documented  in  a number  of studies  ( Bernard 1976; Fagen et al.  1968; Gaertner  
1955;  Nelson  and  Tienda  1985; Pedraza-Bailey 1985; Portes and Bach  1985; Rogg  
1974).  As  stated  by  Portes  and  Bach (1985:73), "refugees have been described  
as  internally  homogeneous  groups,  since  reasons for their  flight  are  often  
linked  to  a  common  class  origin,  religion, or political ideology."  While an  
exile or  refugee migration   stream  may   be selective  of   only one religious,  
ethnic,  or  political  group, within  that group  we expect to find little selec-  
tivity  demographically  and  socioeconomically.  In  other words,  even though  a  
refugee  stream  as  whole  is  homogeneous with  respect to a given group, within  
that  group  we  expect  heterogeneity.   This does not constitute a contradiction  
in empirical findings as Portes and Bach (1985) appear to argue.                      
Our  first  hypothesis  is  that  the 1975-80 immigrants include  a higher  
proportion of  religious  minorities   than the pre-1975  immigrants.   It is   in  
accordance  with  Kunz'(1973:139)  hypothesis that in "all mass flights  ethnic or  
other  religious  minorities  participate  beyond their demographic  proportions."  
Consequently,  the    comparisons between   cohorts  should take  into account the  
ethno-religious  identity  of    the  immigrants. In  view of the  radical Islamic  
nature  of  the Iranian  revolution, political refugees and exiles must  have com-  
prised  not  only  Muslim  Iranians  who  opposed the new regime but also  a large  
number  of  non-Muslim  religious minorities who feared persecution.  This pattern  
of selective immigration could not have occurred prior to the revolution.             
Within  religious  minorities  that are  forced into exile from a country,  
we  would  expect  little  demographic selectivity (Bernard  1976).  Therefore, it  
is  likely,  therefore,  that a  refugee stream  that comprises  religious minori-  
ties  will  also  be  characterized  by a balanced  demographic  structure. Conse-  
quently,  our  second  hypothesis  is that the  1975-1980 cohort,  composed of   a  
large  number  of  refugees, is  much more   balanced  with respect to age and sex  
distribution  than  the  pre-1975  cohort.  This  hypothesis pertains to the whole  
immigration cohort as well as to ethno-religious groups within it.                    
Despite  their  diversity  in  social  class origin, early waves of exiles  
have  higher  socioeconomic  status  than immigrants (Fagen et al.  1968; Gaertner  
1955;  Peterson   1978;   Rogg  1974, Stein  1981). This  pattern is  difficult to  
ascertain  because  its components  need  to  be disentangled.  The use of occupa-  
tion  and  income  of exiles in the  receiving country  is problematic  because it  
is  affected  by  the migration experience.  In view of the  involuntary migration  
of  exiles  and, in  some cases,  the problem  of compatibility of their skills to  
the  country  of  destination,   they   initially   experience  downward  mobility  
(Briggs  1984;  Chiswick  1979;  Stein 1979).  Thus, data on occupation and income  
of  exiles  in  the receiving  country  may  not  accurately reflect their occupa-  
tional selectivity.  Using  educational attainment as  a  proxy  for social class,  
however,   Pedraza-Bailey  (1985)  shows  that  the  Cuban exiles  who  immigrated  
during  1960-1970   had  a  higher  social class origin than the  Cuban immigrants  
who  came  to the  U.S. in  the  1945-1959 period or before the Cuban  revolution.  
Thus,  our  third  hypothesis  is  that   Iranians  who   arrived in 1975-80 had a  
higher  socioeconomic  achievement than  those  who came  before  that date.  This  
hypothesis    will   be   tested  mainly  by considering educational  achievement.  
Indirect   evidence  pertaining to  this hypothesis,  however, may be provided  by  
an analysis of U.S. Census data on occupation and income.                                      
The analysis  of data  from  the  1980  U.S. Census on immigration cohorts  
will  be preceded by  a brief review  of  trends  and types of Iranian immigration  
to   the United  States as  documented  by tabulations from the INS.   While these  
tabulations  pertain  only  to  the United States,  they  also reflect immigration  
trends  to Los Angeles, since this metropolitan  area  is  the favored destination  
of Iranian immigrants to the United States.                                                    
  
Iranian Immigration Cohorts to the United States, 1950-1980                                    
  
Iranian  immigration  to  the  United  States is essentially  a post-World  
War  II   phenomenon   which  can   be  divided  into  two chronological phases or  
cohorts:  1) after World  War  II  until  the Iranian revolution (1950-1977);  and  
2) during and after the Iranian  revolution  until  the  census year  (1978-1980).  
According  to INS  data,  during  the  first phase (1950-1977),  an average annual  
of  1,515 immigrants  and  17,001 nonimmigrants  from  Iran  were admitted  to the  
United   States    (Table  1).   Data  on  nonimmigrants provide information about  
visitors and  students,  both common  types of international  migration  from Iran  
to the United  States.  This phase of Iranian emigration was triggered  by  Iran's  
gradually  recovering  economy after   World  War II  as  its  oil production  and  
revenues resumed.  It coincided with the  beginning of  a  period  of direct  U.S.  
influence in  Iran.  Towards  the end of this  period (1974-1977),  the  explosion  
of   oil  revenues    enabled   many  Iranians   to   come to  the  United States,  
particularly as visitors and students.                                                         
The    short    second  phase  of Iranian immigration  (1978-1980) can  be  
distinguished from the first phase  in  terms of both  its  increasing volume  and  
the  motives  for   emigration.    The number of Iranian  nonimmigrants  increased  
sharply  to  an  annual average of  112,205 during the one and three quarter years  
for   which   INS   data on   nonimmigrants   are  available between 1978 and 1980  
{Table   1).   The   upward  trend in  Iranian arrivals to the United States after  
1978 suggests  that  after the revolution they included  a substantial  proportion  
of exiles and refugees.                                                                        
The  number  of  Iranian immigrants, excluding those   with   visitor   or  
student visas, increased to an annual average  of  8,249 (Table  1).  Much of this  
growth,  however,   was due to adjustment  in  status  from  nonimmigrant to immi-  
grant, particularly in the year 1980.   These conversions  reflect the  major mode  
of   resident status attainment among  Iranians;  i.e.,  to enter as nonimmigrants  
(mostly  visitors and students) and  subsequently  to  adjust to immigrant status.  
Adjustment to  immigrant  status   signifies  a  desire  to  settle in  the United  
States among persons who first arrived as visitors or students.

Assessment of the 1980 U.S. Census Data on Iranians in Los Angeles                      
  
There is a wide variation in the  estimates of the Iranian  population in  
Los Angeles-Long Beach  SNSA,  which  contains 82  percent of Iranians in the five  
counties (Los Angeles, Orange,  Ventura, San  Bernardino  and  Riverside) included  
in  the present analysis.  The 1980  U.S. Census reported  25,510 (U.S.  Bureau of  
the Census 1983:Table  195).  Time  (1983:22) claimed 200,000,  and  ranked  Iran-  
ians as the  second  largest  ethnic  minority in Los Angeles, Mexicans  being the  
first.   Time's source  for  this  excessive estimate is  unknown,  thus  reducing  
its  reliability.   On the other  hand, it is very  likely   that  the 1980   U.S.  
Census undercounted Iranians.  First,  the census  enumeration took  place  during  
the  Iranian    "hostage  crisis."  Under  those circumstances,  many Iranians may  
have  disguised  their  national  origin in  the Census  questionnaire for fear of  
hostility  and  deportation.  Refusal or disguise  was  probably most common among  
Iranians  who  were  in  violation of their  visas at the time. According  to INS,  
1,203  Iranians  were  deported  for visa violations in  the fiscal  year 1979-80,  
which  was  the  largest  number of deportees for any immigrant group in that year  
(INS  1980:Table  39).   Second,  many  non-Muslim Iranians (especially  Armenians  
and  Assyrians),  may  have  only  reported  their ancestry rather than  place  of  
birth  or  Iranian  origin  in the U.S. Census,  thus reducing the number of Iran-  
ians  enumerated.  However,  in spite of its limitations, the 1980 U.S.  Census is  
the  only  source  of  systematic  demographic  and socioeconomic data on Iranians  
in the United States.                                                                   
Another feature  of Iranians  is  the presence of a large number  of stu-  
dents.  In 1980,  29  percent of  Iranians  in  Los Angeles were students.4 Census  
data on  the  characteristics of  Iranian  students  and non-students 20 years and  
older indicate   that  despite  their relatively   younger  age,  students have  a  
higher educational  level  than non-students.  Students  also  are more  fluent in  
English.  Not surprisingly,  Iranian students  do  not do  as well economically as  
non-students.  The former  show   lower  labor  force participation  with  smaller  
proportions holding high   status  jobs.   These factors  combined  with   working  
fewer  weeks  per year  and  a lower self-employment rate result in about  half as  
much  earnings for  students  than non-students  (around  $9,000  as  compared  to  
$17,000  during 1979).  Therefore,  the inclusion  of  students  with non-students  
in  any  analysis of  Iranians  distorts the statistical profile of this minority.  
It  leads  to younger  age  distribution,  greater  knowledge  of  English,   less  
reliance  on self-employment,   lower occupational  profile,  and  markedly  lower  
levels of income.                                                                       
Iranians  in  Los  Angeles  are  composed  of  several distinctive ethno-  
religious sub-groups, such  as Muslim,  Bahai, Jewish,  Zoroastrian,  Armenian and  
Assyrian.  Compared  to  their   population   size in  Iran, non-muslim  religious  
minorities  appear  to  be  overrepresented  among  Iranians  in this metropolitan  
area.  Unfortunately,  since  the  U.S. Census  has no  questions on religion  and  
the  tabulations  of  the  1980  Census  question  on ancestry explicitly excluded  
religion,  it  is  impossible  to  identify  all of these sub-ethnic groups in the  
1980  U.S.  Census.  Only a  non-governmental sample survey could do so. Neverthe-  
less,  the  new  question on ancestry,  introduced for the first  time in the 1980  
Census,  makes  it  possible  to identify  persons of Armenian ancestry and class-  
ify  Iranians  into  two sub-groups:  Armenians and non-Armenians. The latter sub-  
group  is,  of  course, heterogeneous  and  includes all the other ethno-religious  
groups  mentioned  above.  Although  the  ancestry  question   also   allows us to  
identify  other  sub-ethnic  groups  such as Assyrians,   Kurds  and Turks,  these  
ethnic  groups  are  included  in  the non-Armenian category  because they are too  
smalll to warrant a separate analysis.                                                    
  
Minority, Demographic, and Educational Characteristics of Immigration Cohorts            
  
Data  from  the  1980  U.S.  Census allow  us to test the three hypotheses  
about  the  differences  between  minority,  demographic,  and educational charac-  
teristics of the pre-1975 and the 1975-80 non-student immigration cohorts.               
There  appear to be proportionately  more minorities  in the  1975-80 than  
the  pre-1975  cohort.  While  the  percentage of  Armenians increased  only  from  
24.4 in   the pre-1975   cohort to 28.8 in   1975-80 cohort,   this increase   was  
statistically  significant  at the 5 percent level (calculated  from Table  3). If  
the  census data had also enabled us to  identify Iranian  Jews and  Bahais, there  
would  have been a much greater  increase  in  the  minority composition  of these  
two immigration cohorts. Thus there is clear support for the first hypothesis.           
Tables  2 and 3 provide support for  the second  hypothesis as  it applies  
to  all  refugees  as  well  to  specific  religious minorities within the refugee  
stream.  For  all  non-students,  the  sex  ratio  drops  sharply from 153 for the  
pre-1975 cohort to 97 in 1975-80  (calculated from  data given  in Table  2), thus  
suggesting  that  Iranian  exiles  tend  to  have a more balanced sex distribution  
than other immigrants.  Also,  both  men  and  women  who arrived  in 1975-80 were  
not only younger on the average than those  who came  before 1975  but had  also a  
more  balanced  (or  heterogeneous) age distribution  as  measured by the standard  
deviation.  The  increase  in  the standard  deviation of age  between the earlier  
and later cohorts, however, is only statistically significant for men.                   
Since  there  are marked differences  between Armenians and non-Armenians,  
the  contrast  between pre-1975 and  1975-80  immigrants within  these  sub-groups  
should  be  even  greater than for all Iranians.  Among non-Armenians, the 1975-80  
migration  cohort  is  much more balanced in terms of  sex ratio  and age than the  
earlier  cohort,  thus suggesting less migration  selectivity  for the more recent  
migrants.  The  sex  ratio dropped sharply from 193 to  95 men  per 100 women, and  
the  mean  age  decreased from 39.2  to  35.8 years  (Table  3).   What  is   more  
significant,  however,  is that the  standard deviation  of age increased markedly  
from 11.0  to  16.5.  It is clear that,  among non-Armenians,  the cohort with the  
large number  of  refugees was  much  more balanced  demographically than the pre-  
1975   immigrants.   Among  Armenians,   the  demographic   differentials  between  
cohorts are  similar  to those  for non-Armenians, but  are surprisingly much less  
marked.  It should  be noted,  however, that the sample  for Armenians who arrived  
before  1975 is  small.  While these results are consistent  with the second hypo-  
thesis,  they fail  to  suggest a  higher demographic heterogeneity among minority  
than  non-minority refugees  or exiles.  But,  as  pointed out earlier,  the  non-  
Armenian category itself includes religious minorities.                                  
One  interpretation  of  these  findings is that, over time, all immigrant  
streams  become  more  balanced  demographically because of family  reunification.  
But,  family  reunification  assumes  that  immigrants  have acquired citizenship.  
It  appears   that  this   interpretation does   not  apply to Iranian immigrants,

since  only  10  percent  of all persons born in Iran and residing in  Los Angeles  
had been naturalized by 1980.                                                              
Using  educational  achievement as  a proxy for socioeconomic achievement,  
the  evidence  given  in  Tables 2 and 3 clearly contradicts the third hypothesis.  
Between  the    pre-1975  and   the  1975-80  cohorts, the mean years of education  
decreased  from  18.1 to  14.3 for  men  and  from  14.9 to  12.9 for  women. This  
decline  in  educational level  is   statistically  significant for  both men  and  
women.                                                                                     
For both Armenians and  non-Armenians,  there is  a noticeable  decline in  
educational  achievement  between   the   two  migration cohorts.   For the larger  
group of  non-Armenians,  the percent with "five  or  more   years   of   college"  
decreased  markedly  from 64.0 to 36.2  in  the same period  (Table   3).  Similar  
differences   were observed  for  Armenians.  These findings indicate  that  those  
who  arrived  in 1975-80  included more  elements of   Iran's population  such  as  
women  and  older persons who  were less likely to  have  a graduate school educa-  
tion.  It  may  be noted that  the lower levels of education of the 1975-80 cohort  
was  accompanied by  a lesser  knowledge  of   English.  Thus,  for non-Armenians,  
the  percentage "knowing English not  well or not  at  all"  increased drastically  
from  9.4  in pre-1975 to 34.0 in 1975-80 periods (Table 3).  This pattern  may be  
indicative  of either a lower socioeconomic  status   or  lesser acculturation  of  
the  1975-80 cohort.  Nevertheless, Iranian migrants as  a whole probably  have  a  
better command of  English  and  more education than  most other immigrants in Los  
Angeles.  For example,  34.2  percent of Iranians completed more than  four  years  
of  college compared  to  30.2  percent for  foreign-born  Koreans,  a highly edu-  
cated  immigrant group.  Furthermore,  10.7 percent of Iranians  had little or  no  
knowledge of  English,  a  level  much  lower  than the comparable  figure of 39.2  
for Koreans.5                                                                              
While  the  findings  on education contradict our  third hypothesis,  they  
undoubtedly    reflect the fact  that education   increases   with   duration   of  
residence in the United States.  Also,  the  pre-1975  cohort of non-students must  
have  included  many  Iranians who obtained their  college education in the  1960s  
and the mid-1970s.                                                                         
  
Occupational and Income Characteristics of Immigration Cohorts                             
  
We  shall   examine  now  the differences in occupational achievement  and  
income between the  two  immigration  cohorts and  consider the  relevance of  our  
findings to the third hypothesis (Tables  2  and  3).  For men, occupational level  
and  income  is  much  higher  for  those who came before 1975 than those who came  
during  1975-80.  The  only  difference  in  favor of  the exiles  is interest and  
rental  income  which  is three times higher (around  $9,000)  than for immigrants  
(about $3,000). The pattern is similar for women.                                          
The  comparisons of occupational status and income for  Armenians and non-  
Armenians  will  be limited to males (Table  3).  A comparable analysis  could not  
be carried out for women because of their small number in the sample.                      
For  both  Armenians  and non-Armenians, the  distribution  of occupations  
differs  appreciably between the  pre-1975 and  the 1975-80  period.   For  Armen-  
ians,  the   percentage in the  two top  occupations (administrative,  managerial,  
and  professional)  decreased  noticeably  from 51.8 to 22.7 and the percentage in  
the  two    bottom occupations  (craft,  operatives,   and   laborers)   increased  
markedly  from 18.5  to 37.9.  A  similar though  less marked  trend may  be noted  
for  non-Armenians.  One unexpected finding is the  high level  of self-employment  
among  Iranians  in  Los Angeles,  almost  irrespective   of   group   or   period  
(Table  3).    The  percentage   of  Armenian  males   reporting   self-employment  
increased  from 25.0  to  33.3  between pre-1975 and  1975-80.  For  non-Armenians  
the  comparable figures  are  28.6  and 34.2 percent. These  self-employment rates  
suggest  that  all Iranians,  whether Armenians or  non-Armenians  and  exiles  or  
immigrants,  share in  common  with many  other immigrant  groups a  high reliance  
on  self-employment as  a form  of economic  adaptation  in  the   United   States  
(Light 1984).                                                                          
Both  Armenian  and  non-Armenian  males   who   arrived   in  1975-80 had  
substantially lower mean  1979  incomes  than  those who immigrated  earlier. Mean  
income  dropped  from  $24,486 in pre-1975  to  $14,180  in 1975-80  for Armenians  
and  from  $25,885  to  $18,620 for non-Armenians in  the  same period  (Table 3).  
There  is  a  similar  trend  for  mean  wage or salary income. These lower income  
levels  of    men  in 1975-80  may   be explained,  in part, by  the fact that the  
revolution  and  subsequent emigration impaired  the earning  ability of those who  
left  at  that  time.  It  may also be explained  by lower educational achievement  
and  the  lesser  hours of  work for recent immigrants.  An interesting finding in  
Table  3  is  that  while mean income from  wages or salaries declined between the  
two  migration  periods for  both  groups,  the opposite  is  true for mean income  
from  interest  or  net rental  income.  Mean  income  from   the  latter   source  
increased  from  $3,470 to  $12,970  for  Armenians and from  $2,779 to $7,328 for  
non-Armenians.  These figures  imply  that  Iranians who  arrived  in 1975-80  had  
much  more  capital  at their  disposal  than  those who immigrated earlier. Given  
the  short  length of stay of  this cohort  in the U.S.; it  is unlikely to attri-  
bute  the  availability of  capital  to  savings  in  the U.S., rather it reflects  
bringing  in  capital from  Iran.  The  greater  availability of capital may  be a  
distinctive  feature of  some  exile  or  refugee  groups  compared  to   economic  
immigrants.                                                                            
In  assessing  the meaning  of  the substantial differences in mean income  
between  Iranian  males  who came  before  1975  and  those who arrived after that  
date, we  need  to  establish whether  or not   these   differences remain   after  
controlling  for  the  effects of  relevant  variables.  A multiple classification  
analysis  was  carried  out separately  for  Armenian and  non-Armenian  males  16  
years  of  age and  over who reported that  they worked 40 hours  or more per week  
in 1979  (Table 4).   In  order  to increase   the  sample  size, this  population  
included  students  who  worked full-time.  Income  from all  sources for males is  
the  dependent  variable and the  independent variables are age,  education, know-  
ledge of  English,  occupational status,  self-employment,  and  year  of immigra-  
tion.  The   results are  strikingly  different for  Armenians   compared to  non-  
Armenians.  Mean  income dropped  sharply  from  $26,950  for Armenians  who  came  
before  1975  to  $16,430 for those who  arrived after 1975. After controlling for  
the  effects  of    the  five independent    variables, the decline in mean income  
remained  as great (from  $25,130  to $17,860).  For non-Armenians, the unadjusted  
mean  incomes  are $28,510 and $23,520,  and the  means adjusted for the effect of  
the  other variables  are $26,440  and  $25,930.  Thus,   these  variables,   that  
usually  explain levels  of income  of  males,  have little  effect on income dif-  
ferences  for  the two Armenian  migration cohorts.  On the  other hand, they seem  
to  explain  all  of  the  differences for non-Armenians. It should be  noted that  
all six  variables  explain  much  more  of  the  variance   of  Armenians' income  
(50 percent) than that of non-Armenians' (35 percent).

The fact that timing of migration has a strong  net effect  on Armenians'                        
income could be interpreted in terms  of exile  status. It  is in  agreement with                        
the  findings  by  Chiswick (1979)  that  political  refugees  or  exiles  cannot                        
translate their  education and  labor market  experience  from   the country   of                        
origin into earnings as easily as immigrants. It  is likely  that as  a predomin-                        
antly exile  population, Armenians  arrived mostly  after the  Iranian revolution                        
of 1978.  Considering the small Ns  for Armenians,  however, we  have to  be cau-                        
tious in interpreting these findings.                                                                    
The fact that timing of migration has  little net  effect on  the earning                        
ability of non-Armenians can be considered  to confirm  the third  hypothesis. If                        
we  were able  to control  for the  general tendency  of socioeconomic  status to                        
increase  with  longer  residence in  the United  States, it  is likely  that the                        
income of the 1975-80 cohort would  have been  greater than  that of  the earlier                        
one. While  all exiles  have  lower  educational levels   than immigrants,   some                        
exiles may have more funds at  their disposal  and achieve  a higher  income than                        
immigrants.                                                                                              
  
SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS                                          
  
Annual data from the Immigration and Naturalization Service were  used to                        
identify  two  broad phases  of Iranian  migration to  the United  States, before                        
and after the Iranian revolution  of 1978.  Between the  first and  second phase,                        
the  average annual  number of  Iranian immigrants  increased about  fivefold and                        
nonimmigrants nearly sevenfold. While  most of  those who  came before  1978 were                        
permanent   or temporary  immigrants,  the majority of  the non-students and some  
of   the students who arrived after the revolution  may   be   considered to   be  
exiles.                                                                                      
The Public Use Microdata Sample from the 1980 U.S. Census  was   used  to  
analyze   the demographic and socioeconomic  characteristics of  Iranians in  Los  
Angeles  with a focus on  a comparison between the  1975-1980 and   the  pre-1975  
immigration   cohorts.   While these intervals do not coincide  exactly with  the  
two  phases  of  Iranian immigration, they do provide a  basis for describing the  
characteristics of Iranian migration streams during these phases.                            
The  analysis of census data for Iranians provides a clear  cut image  of  
the   differences  between  the 1975-80 and the pre-1975 immigration cohorts  for  
both  Armenians  and non-Armenians.   These  findings  reflect  only   partially,  
however, the differences  between immigrants and  exiles.   While the former pre-  
dominate  in  the pre-1975 period,  the latter comprise only  a portion of  those  
who  arrived  during  1975-80.   Furthermore,   the category of  non-Armenians is  
heterogeneous and includes major sub-groups such as Jews, Muslims, and Bahais.               
Notwithstanding the shortcomings of data from the 1980  U.S. Census,  our  
analysis   gives   preliminary   support for the first and second hypotheses that  
the  1975-80  cohort includes a higher proportion  of religious minorities and is  
much  more balanced with  respect  to age and sex distribution  than the pre-1975  
cohort.  However, the third hypothesis that Iranians  who arrived  in 1975-80 had  
a  higher socioeconomic achievement than those who came before  that date  is not  
corroborated by  the data.  It  is clear that Iranian exiles have  a lower educa-  
tional  attainment  than immigrants.   Given the preponderance of former students  
among  Iranian  immigrants,  this  finding  is not surprising.  The lower occupa-  
tional and   income levels  of  Iranian  exiles than immigrants  may reflect both  
their social    class origin   and  the downward  mobility  of exiles immediately  
after arrival.  Unfortunately, census data  do  not  allow  us to disentangle the  
two.  Only  a  survey  can  resolve this issue and provide a  firm test  of  this  
hypothesis.

2.The Los Angeles metropolitan region comprises the   counties  of  Los  Angeles,  
Orange,  Ventura, Riverside, and San Bernardino.   It is  identical  to the  Los  
Angeles-Long   Beach-Anaheim  Standard Consolidated  Statistical Area (SCSA)  in  
the  1980 U.S. Census.  The Bureau of the Census  rationale for defining SCSA is  
that    it  includes   "adjoining  SMSA's"  which  "are  themselves socially and  
economically interrelated." See U.S. Bureau of the Census (1982:6-4,A-4).

4.Some  of  the  Iranians who were non-students in 1980 may have come as students  
rather  than  as  immigrants  before  1975.   While   they  may  have initiallly  
intended to  go  back  to  Iran   after the  completion of  their studies,  they  
changed  their  minds and became de facto expatriates in the  United States as a  
result  of  the Iranian revolution.  Unfortunately, it is impossible to evaluate  
the relative importance of this group, using the census data.
