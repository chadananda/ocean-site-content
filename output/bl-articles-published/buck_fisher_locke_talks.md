Alain Locke: Four Talks Redefining Democracy,
Education, and World Citizenship


EDITED AND INTRODUCED BY CHRISTOPHER BUCK AND BETTY J. FISHER



   Alain Locke (1885–1954) was an extraordinary individual who, in his almost
   seven decades, made an unforgettable mark on the African American community
   in the United States and who still has much to say to the world at large about
   prejudice, racism, democracy, and world citizenship—and the importance of
   being not behind or on the curve, but ahead of it. Locke lived what he wrote,
   for he was ahead of the curve in just about everything he did for most of his
   sixty-nine years. In 1907 he became the ³rst African American Rhodes Scholar.
   With the publication in 1925 of The New Negro: An Interpretation of Negro Life,
   an anthology showcasing African American artists, he became known as the
   Dean of the Harlem Renaissance, which sought to advance African Americans
   through race relations, the arts, and social thought, leaving behind European
   and white American styles and celebrating the black experience. Professionally,
   Locke was a philosopher. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., in an unpublished
   speech given on 19 March 1968, in Clarksdale, Mississippi, compared Locke
   to Plato and Artistotle, saying that “We’re going to let our children know that
   the only philosophers that lived were not Plato and Aristotle, but W. E. B. Du
   Bois and Alain Locke came through the universe.1

        Locke “rede³ned” democracy through his evolving conceptions of the
     philosophy of democracy, widening its scope to include at least nine dimensions:
     local democracy, moral democracy, political democracy, economic democracy,
     cultural democracy, racial democracy, social democracy, spiritual democracy,
     and world democracy.
        In the ³eld of education, Locke was ³rst and foremost a teacher, both in the
     classroom and in his books, his many essays, and his talks. He became a leader
     in the adult-education movement, serving one term (1946–47) as the ³rst
     African American president of the predominantly white American Association
     for Adult Education. In the aftermath of World War II he urged educators to
     foster “international-mindedness,” which, he said, “can only be created through
     some de³nite collective e²ort at mutual understanding and by developing a
     sense of common purpose among educators throughout the world.”2
        As a corollary to his interest in world-mindedness, Locke championed world
     citizenship, perhaps most eloquently in a 1944 essay entitled “Stretching Our
     Social Mind” (reprinted below).
        Locke’s academic training included undergraduate studies at Harvard
     University, where he was one of a handful of African Americans; graduate
     work at Hertford College at Oxford and at the University of Berlin; and,
     ³nally, a Ph.D. in philosophy from Harvard in 1918. His distinguished teaching
     career began at Howard University, a premier African American university in
     Washington, D.C., and included a number of visiting and exchange pro-
     fessorships at universities in the United States and Haiti. Locke, whom W. E.
     B. Du Bois described in 1927 as being “by long odds the best trained man
     among younger American Negroes,” became, during the 1930s and until his
     death in 1954, a well-known national ³gure with honors and appearances too
     numerous to list.3
        In 1918, the year in which Locke was awarded a doctorate in philosophy
     from Harvard, he declared himself to be a Bahá’í. Initial research has already
     begun to reveal the nature of his commitment and contributions to the Bahá’í

   Faith, particularly in the area of race relations and intercultural understanding.4
   Because Locke did not leave diaries or records showing exactly how the tenets
   of the Bahá’í Faith helped to shape his thinking, much remains to be done to
   clarify the exact nature of various in·uences on his work. However, many
   themes in his writings resonate with the teachings of the Bahá’í Faith: the
   progressive nature of unfolding truths, the elimination of all kinds of prejudices
   (religious, racial, national, cultural, and so on), the role of education in
   enlarging mind-sets, seeing and treating all peoples as spiritual beings, attaining
   a sense of world citizenship. In the four talks that follow one will ³nd these
   themes and more.
      Below we have transcribed four of Locke’s essays from typewritten copies,
   edited them conservatively, and are publishing them for the ³rst time. We have
   preserved Locke’s spelling, adding clari³cations in brackets in several places.
   We have also preserved Locke’s punctuation, adding punctuation marks in
   brackets only where the text becomes hard to read. We have deleted the
   commas and semicolons Locke often used before em-dashes and have used
   house style to make ending quotations marks consistent throughout. Words
   and phrases that Locke added by hand we have set in italics and have noted his
   additions in footnotes.




ALAIN LOCKE: THE PRESERVATION OF THE DEMOCRATIC IDEAL5
Archival records do not reveal when Alain Locke gave the talk he called “The Preservation of
the Democratic Ideal,” but internal evidence (his reference to something he wrote in “1935,
three and a half years ago”) suggests that it can be dated to 1938 or 1939. The audience,
according to references in the talk, is social workers plying their profession in the tradition of
settlement houses providing services directly to the poor in urban areas. Locke’s assignment, he
states at the end of his talk, was to “emphasize the pivotal place of the minority situation on
the present-day battle front of democracy and the critical need for social and cultural
democracy as the bulwark of as much democracy as we have or even realistically can hope to
attain.”
    Two themes animate the presentation—rede³ning democracy and the need for education
aimed at changing hearts. The responsibility for education, Locke says, belongs to the press, the
schools, the pulpit, and radio (then a fairly recent innovation) but also to the social workers
who have a “particularly intimate exposure” to the problems of minorities.
    In rede³ning democracy, Locke advocates pressing “forward more vigorously and more
rapidly toward” attaining “social democracy in actual practice,” the “test touchstone” being

“minority status, minority protection, minority rights.” The minorities he cites include Slavs,
Southern Europeans, Jews, Orientals, Native Americans, Mexicans, and Negroes—an “ominous
rainbow” subjected to “social bias and prejudice.” Keeping “political democracy,” he asserts,
requires “more social democracy and more economic democracy.” For Locke, rede³ning
democracy and educating to change hearts includes the Americanization of Americans in
their “social attitudes and behavior,” the goal being to “establish democracy in the heart of our
social relations.” Many of Locke’s insights resonate in the twenty-³rst century as they did in
the late 1930s in the years before the United States entered World War II.


There is only one really e²ective way to preserve the democratic ideal, it seems to
me, and that is to press forward more vigorously and more rapidly toward the
attainment of social democracy in actual practice [sic]. As far as theory goes[,] we
have a fairly adequate tradition and conception of democracy, even though it could
stand broad extension on the economic front, but it is in the general practice of
even what is traditional in our democracy that the present danger to democracy lies.
We all sense the immanent [sic] danger of a lapsing democratic practice—you and
I especially perhaps, you as social workers on the yet undemocratic and unliquidated
frontier of underprivilege, of social and economic discrimination, I, as a Negro, on
that insidious and dangerous ·ank frontier of race discrimination and prejudice.
So here we are together to discuss[,] at a strategic point and a critical hour[,] what
can be done and what must be done to safeguard or even save democracy.
    Now it isn[’]t easy to be or live a social problem and it is far from pleasant to
be an alarming symptom. And it may not seem modest to put one’s own case forward
or ·aunt one[’]s own cause ³rst. However[,] these are no times for polite complacencies
and pleasant proprieties. Most Negroes know what’s wrong with American democ-
racy, and in times like these it is false modesty as well as bad policy not to speak
and speak frankly. Democracy just can[’]t stand too much exceptions and too
·agrant contradiction in practice. Surely ours isn[’]t the only case; but it is the oldest
and most chronic case. It has its lessons and its warnings particularly now when
even democratic theory is being seriously and powerfully challenged, and to press
these matters now is not merely the pleading of a special case but the sounding of
a general warning and call to a vital general cause and issue.
    Constitutional guarantees, legal and civil rights, political machinery of demo-
cratic action and control are, of course, the skeleton foundation of democracy, but
you and I know that attitudes are the ·esh and blood of democracy, and that without
their vital reenforcement [sic] democracy is really moribund or dead. That is my
reason for thinking that in any democracy, ours included, the crucial issue, the test
touchstone of democracy is minority status, minority protection, minority rights.
It isn[’]t the sum total of democracy, but it is a crucial and critical factor. Ce[r]tainly
of all groups[,] settlement workers should know this, being in a sense special
guardians of this, democracy’s most critical and dangerous frontier.6 This has been

so since the early days of settlement pio-
neering when the settlement house was
the democratic citadel outpost in the
economic and cultural Ghettos of our
land. However the situation has changed,

    Lest I seem too alarmist, or too pan-
icky about this issue, allow me to read
a few paragraphs I wrote in 1935, three and a half years ago.7 Except for the Negro’s
case, the situation was surely not so critical then. But even then, it was perfectly
true and accurate to say that we were too complacent about our way of democracy,
too supine and inconsistent, too unaware of the fact that democracy’s house was
not in good order. I am quoting now: “America has a curiously laissez-faire tradition
on the subject of minorities. It has been our naive and pious belief that[,] in her
atmosphere of freedom and opportunity[,] minority di²erences would fade out. This
belief did not extend to the ³eld of religion[,] but religious sects were supposed to
live in mutual tolerance even if they could not fraternize. But separatism and
migration, I think, account for much of the earlier historical manifestations of
tolerance in America and indi²erence for much of the later phases. Our orthodox
tradition, [sic] has been that[,] by ignoring these di²erences[,] they would automati-
cally disappear,[.] Most of them (but here note the Negro exception) are glossed
over by a thin veneer of conformity to help keep up the majority illusion; (the most
contrary to fact myth in our American social thinking, need I point out to social
and settlement workers.)”

    “But the close observer scarcely needs the vagaries of 100 percent Americanism
or the recurrent rampancy of Ku-Kluxism to convince him that we in fact have only
a precarious truce.8 These minority traditions carry on beneath the surface of our
super³cially composite life, ready for volcanic explosions of social fear, persecution
and prejudice[,] or for milder eruptions of social snobbishness and factionalism.
Without belittling the amount of real tolerance that America has achieved in these
matters, it can still be said that America is full of minority groups, some repressed,
some suppressed, all of them in varying degree dangers and challenges, but, if rightly
handled, opportunities to [for] the attainment of sound social democracy.”9
    “I may be in error, I should like to be, but I cannot believe that the American
situation is so very exceptional (as compared to Europe) and that the Atlantic and
Paci³c ocenas [sic, oceans] have thrwon [sic, thrown] around us an e²ective psy-
chological quara[n]tine. If the American social mind were not so particularly pe-
culiarly subject to racial prejudice[,] one might have some ground for such belief.
As a matter of fact, whatever else they prove, those questionnaires that the professors
of sociology are tabulating show a wide and very typical spectrum of American social
antipathies[,] running a gamut from Slavs and Southern Europeans to Jews, Ori-
entals, Indians, Mexicans and Negroes. This ominous rainbow, with a few local but
not signi³cant variations, shows a wide dif[f ]ussion of social bias and prejudice in
our social atmosphere and unfortunately presages not the passing but the coming
of a storm.[”]
    “It does not seem, then, that America is as much of an exception in these matters
as is commonly thought[,] and unless America solves these minority issues construc-
tively and achieves minority peace or minority tolerance, in less than half a gen-
eration she will be in the ·aming predicament of Europe. Her plight may perhaps
be even worse because of the closer justaposition [sic] of these elements in the context
of American life and culture. . . . We must realize that active forces in the world
today are preaching, practising and propagating dominant factionalisms and hatreds,
and by evoking counter-factionalisms, are spreading minority antagonisms in their
path. At this point, we should note in passing that rarely is the so-called majority
an actual majority. It is usually a particularly belligerent or a strategically situated
minority itself, a minority in the saddle, booted and spurred, riding for an immediate
dominance—and often for an eventual fall. Few indeed are the forces today that
are working for mutual understanding and tolerance among groups.” And thus it
is that I repeat that attitudes are the crux of the problem of democracy today.
    To be more speci³c;[:] there are ·agrant inconsistencies and contradictions in-
volved in our dominant present-day American social attitudes. The mass mind, for
example, ³nds it quite possible[,] and does not sense it as at all inconsistent[,] to

revel in the Negro’s spiritual products,10 and on the popular level to wallow in his
emotional atmosphere and yet despise his person and exclude his normal society.
We have the paradox of a whole section of the country professing that it “loves the
Negro”—indeed thinking that it does, but in fact oppressing, terrorizing and
lynching him. This same body of opinion includes those who have pro³ted for
generations from the Negro’s unpaid and underpaid toil and labor, but who, without
recognition of their social responsibility, can complacantly [sic] regard him as a great
social menace and liability. Or again, a whole nation has found it possible to roman-
ticize the Indian[,] while pursuing a policy of ostracism and extermination, with
barely a thought of the wrong involved in setting its children to playing bad imitations
of the real Indians whom they have banished.11 Finally we have a nation, a whole
group of nations, appropriating and reverencing the Jew’s [sic, Jews’] spiritual
products while despising and ostracizing the human Jew.”12
    No; if we are going to have e²ective democracy in America[,] we must have the
democartic [sic] spirit as well as the democratic tradition,[;] we must have more social
democracy and more economic democracy in order to have or keep political democ-
racy. It is a mistake under such circumstances to regard fascism as the danger of
a foreign blight, as altogether an alien psychology.13 Very soberly and very sadly I
must point out that there are seeds of fascism in the native soil, deep down in the
heart of the reactionary economy of the sharecropping South, deep down too in
the sub-marginal slum and the residential city Ghettoes [sic] that settlement workers
have discovered long since, and have made their special ³eld of work and respon-
sibility. But in view of the special crisis, have we not the obligation to re-think these
situations somewhat? Aren[’]t they, if our analysis is correct, of more concern and
importance to majority interests and welfare than even to minority interests and
claims? I think they are the stakes of democracy in the practical sense, and that they
need to be presented to the community at large in that challenging and none too
patronizing aspect. Is it not wise to stress the majority peril and the common stake
rather than merely the minority calim [sic, claim] and the possible minority gain?
We have dispensed with the old formula of “Americanizing the foreign-born,” and 14
somewhat outmoded the problem issue of “assimilating the Negro,” and are begin-
ning to see over the horizon even of the campaign for raising the submerged and
promoting the “secondary Americans,” as they have been called; but now, it seems
to me, the soundest, wisest and most appropriate slogan—if we must have a slogan,



     10. Locke was referring to the artistic, musical, and literary expression of what he called “race
genius.” In his essay “The Negro Spirituals” Locke says that “the spirituals are really the most
characteristic product of the race genius as yet in America” (The New Negro: An Interpretation of Negro
Life, ed. Alain Locke [New York: Boni, 1925] 199).—Ed.

is to [A]mericanize Americans in their social attitudes and behavior. [sic] to establish
democracy in the heart of our social relations.15
    We certainly have not done our full share, either as social workers or as educators,
in working toward this goal. We have not promoted unity and tolerance by the
educational policy of minimizing cultural di²erence and stressing conformity. By
this process we have merely appeased the sense of di²erence and enfeebled our
capacity to stand and understand di²erence. A few particularly disparaged “problem
minorities” have thus had to bear the brunt of this easy compromise and become
the scapegoats of a breakdown or default of an adequate educational program of
practical social democracy. So stereotyped has the situation become that it takes a
crisis to shake us out of this false optimism and sense of democratic security.
However[,] such is the situation today, and much depends on whether we can
confront it cool[l]y and clear-headedly as a challenge and opportunity or only in
timid and panicky fashion as an unexpected crisis.
    I by no means want to suggest that this is the social worker’s particular burden.
In the ³rst place it is far too general and critical for that. The press, the school,
the pulpit, the miracle institution of radio must all take it up, and fortunately are
beginning to do so. But still the settlement worker has a particularly intimate exposure,
a particualrly [sic, particularly] rich experience, and I think a rather seasoned tra-
dition of liberalism of personal living and attitude which on the one hand makes
him vital in any such crusade and on the other makes the settlement house very
strategic still in the situation. Only quite new emphases must be found in the traditional
programs of the settlement, new techniques of approach and publicity no doubt,
and certainly new and enlarged justi³cations; all of which I wish I wer[e] more pro-
fessionally competent to suggest and discuss. However, it [is] to some of these more
speci³c and professional problems that you will be turning your attention in sub-
sequent sessions of this very conference. My task, I take it, has been mainly to emphasize
the pivotal place of the minority situation on the present-day battle front of de-
mocracy and the critical need for social and cultural democracy as the bulwark of
as much democracy as we have or ever realistically can hope to attain.16

Hampton Institute; now Hampton University) was one of the ³rst colleges for African
Americans and a pioneer in educating Native Americans. Both Armstrong and Booker T.
Washington, a Hampton alumnus and later head of Tuskegee Institute, believed in educating
African Americans in moral virtues and in crafts and trades that would assure them gainful
employment. By the early years of the twentieth century a new approach to black-white
relations had challenged the accommodation associated with Washington and with Hampton’s
original mission.
    The original mandate of Hampton Institute makes Locke’s commencement address all the
more remarkable, for he took as his thesis that the time has come “to stretch our social minds
and achieve thereby a new dynamic as well as new alliances in the common ³ght for human
justice and freedom of which our minority cause [that of African Americans] is a vital but
nonetheless only a fractional part.” As in “The Preservation of Democracy,” Locke pursued
two themes: reeducating the citizens of the United States and rede³ning democracy. He
assigned responsibility for reeducation to “our schools,” to “all intelligent leadership,” “progressive
educators,” and, by implication, to the students in Hampton Institute’s graduating class.
    Perhaps shocking to some of the Hampton faculty and to some of the elders in the com-
mencement audience was the gauntlet for change that he threw down.19 The proponents of
two older views of black-white relations, he said, “must be told that they are hopeless
reactionaries and not true friend[s] of progress or of the Negro.” Such people, Locke asserted,
must be “repudiated publicly, and shamed or forced out of what was once a progressive but
what is now a retrogressive attitude and point of view.” The two retrogressive views included,
³rst, interracialism, an “intrenched” point of view in the African American community
characterized by moralism, missionary zeal, “paternalistic nature” and by its working to
resolve racial relations (the very soil from which Hampton Institute and most of the
nineteenth-century African American colleges sprang ) and, second, racialism, the more
recent “militant and chauvinistic racialism” advocating civil rights and full equality, a
position that, to Locke, had “dangerous limitations” and that fostered isolationism.
    Both racialism and interracialism with its militant penchant must be replaced, Locke said,
with a third stage—that of a common cause, a “newer, more progressive social mindedness”
that will replace “nation-mindedness” with “world-mindedness” and “race-mindedness” with
“human-mindedness”—both concepts re·ecting important tenets in the sacred scriptures of
the Bahá’í Faith. By expanding the African American cause to include peoples of di²erent
races and cultures Locke believed that a “sounder and broader” interculturalism for “all
minority problems and situations”—religious, cultural, and racial—could be achieved.
Thus, Locke asserted, the democracy for which African Americans should work is political,




    19. When Locke sent a resume of his article to Negro Digest (launched in 1942 by John H. Johnson),
the magazine rejected it. In November 1944 Johnson, the managing editor, thanked Locke for his
submission but explained that, while the resume of the talk was “interesting and informative,” the
editors “did not feel that we could use it . . . at this time” (John H. Johnson, letter to Alain Locke, 18
Nov. 1944, Alain Locke Papers, MSRC, Box 164-40, Folder 42 [ Johnson, John H.]). Possibly the
magazine’s publishing agenda was full. But by the 1940s Locke had become a prominent national ³gure,
his accomplishments legion. For example, in 1940 he chaired a concert commemorating the seventy-
³fth anniversary of the U.S. Constitutional amendment abolishing slavery and published The Negro in
Art: A Pictorial Record of the Negro Artist and the Negro Theme in Art. In 1941 he dedicated, with U.S.
First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt, an African American Community Art Center on Chicago’s South Side. In
1942 he coedited an anthology called When Peoples Meet: A Study of Race and Culture. And in 1944 he
became a charter member of the Conference on Science, Philosophy and Religion. Examining the
thinking of Negro Digest’s editors in light of Locke’s analysis of two outmoded points of view—racialism
and interracialism—in the African American community might be a fruitful line of inquiry.—Ed.

economic, and cultural—a “broad social mindedness” linking the “racial cause” to “progressive
trends and movements.”
   In the ³rst decade of the twenty-³rst century many of Locke’s ideas seem self-evident. But
he was delivering his message in 1944, before the end of World War II and before the
establishment of the United Nations, both in 1945; before the integration of the U.S. Armed
Forces in 1948; before Brown v. Board of Education prohibited segregated schools in 1954.
Locke was, indeed, ahead of his time.


Part of the lot of any oppressed or persecuted minority is an acute and sometimes
morbid social consciousness. To this the Negro is no exception. One of the most
important issues before us as a racial group today is to broaden our deep but often
too narrow group consciousness and channel it toward the progressive goals and
movements of these modern times. Neither reactionary, subservient inter-racialism
of the traditional sort nor narrow chauvinistic racialism are a proper and adequate
base for our present-day thinking or our present-day group planning and action.
It is high time, therefore, to stretch our social minds and achieve thereby a new
dynamic as well as new alliances in the common ³ght for human justice and freedom
of which our minority cause is a vital but nonetheless only a fractional part.
    It is especially incumbent upon our schools and all intelligent leadership to assist
in this re-orienting of the Negro mind; for only in this way can our group cause
be kept abreast of the progressive trends of our time. So intrenched [sic], tradition-
ally, are some of the older viewpoints and attitudes that this may require the pioneers
of such broader social vision to become social martyrs. The old paternalistic inter-
racialism still has its advocates[,] and considerable vested interests are staked and
rooted in this philosophy of racial work and race relations. Its exponents will have
to be challenged and converted or overcome. On the other hand, militant and chau-
vinistic racialism, paternalistic inter-racialism’s inevitable sequel and antidote, is also
today a dangerous limitation on a sound and progressive social outlook. To the extent
that it distorts and narrows the broad and basic democratic and humanitarian point
of view, it, too, must be fought and reconstructed. But for a considerable while,
its advocates will also oppose the newer, more progressive social mindedness. Even-
tually, however, just as world-mindedness must dominate and remould [sic] nation-
mindedness, so we must transform eventually race-mindedness into human-
mindedness. Today it is possible and necessary for Negroes to conceive their special
disabilities as ·aws in the general democratic structure. The intelligent and e²ective
righting of our racial wrongs and handicaps involves pleading and righting the cause
of any and all oppressed minorities. In making common cause with all such broader
issues, we shall ³nd that we strengthen, both morally and practically, our own.
Indeed, we must learn and use this new strategy and further regard such new
motivations as a contribution we have it in our power to make to the the [sic] general
welfare and social democracy at large.
    Really to grasp this new perspective, we must look back at the three stages through
which the development of inter-racial relations have historically passed in this
country. The ³rst stage was moralistic and missionary, and necessarily of a pater-
nalistic nature. Not merely Hampton Institute, but all or most of our colleges sprang

                                                                     ALAIN LOCKE: FOUR TALKS


from such soil, and many have not yet outgrown this tradition.20 No one with any
fair realization of the historical record would dare be ungrateful of the accomplish-
ments of this great missionary e²ort or repudiate its motives in its healthy prime.
However, that tradition and all it implies is already outmoded, though unfortunately
it is only slowly being outgrown. Those on both sides of the race line who continue
this tradition today are not only doing more harm than good, but are helping to
undo in the minds of the younger generation the proper respect and gratitude for
what this epoch of inter-racial e²ort had previously done for us. Its exponents today,
however, must be told that they are hopeless reactionaries and not true friend[s]
of progress or of the Negro. They must be repudiated publicly, and shamed or forced
out of what was once a progressive but what is now a retrogressive attitude and point
of view.
    But narrow and sel³sh racialism, more characteristic and current among us
today[,] has its dangerous limitations too. Great as the temptation is to counter-
assert, racialism has its taint of the original racism to which it is the pardonable
but not warrantable sequel and reaction. Inevitable and even necessary as a stage
of development, it now, in its turn[,] is a handicapping basis for a healthy and
progressive group platform and program. Negroes today must not allow any insidi-
ous form of racialism, no matter how emotionally tempting or satisfying, to isolate
them from the common cause movements to which the racial cause is logically tied.
Only by broadening our social minds in this respect can we hope to become an
integral part of the progressive movements of the world at large working for political,
economic and cultural democracy. I can best illustrate what this means perhaps by
repeating a suggestion I made sometime ago that I thought the time had come for
an organization like the National Association for the Advancement of Colored
People, vital and useful as it had been as a militant Negro defense organization, to
shift its emphasis, and in an inspiring renewal of insight into what the movement
really meant, to change its name to the National Association for the Advancement
of American Democracy.21
    There was a time, and that was the time when the NAACP and other similar
organizations were founded, when our group e²ort necessarily pivoted on racial
assertiveness. Such organizations even when inter-racially manned, were primarily
race defense organizations. A certain amount of such e²ort is still necessary, but the
focus of our new e²ort must re·ect the third stage of this historical development.


   20. Hampton Normal and Agricultural Institute became Hampton Institute in 1930 and Hampton
University in 1984.—Ed.
   21. The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) was formed in
1908. Its ³rst goal, in response to the treatment of African Americans in the 1908 race riot in
Spring³eld, Illinois, was to assure all Americans of the rights found in the amendments to the U.S.
Constitution—the end of slavery (Amendment 13), equal protection under the law (Amendment 14),
universal male su²rage (Amendment 15). Over the ³rst four decades of the twentieth century its e²orts
were marshaled to ³ght racism, lynchings, the separate-but-equal doctrine, state-mandated segregation,
and job discrimination. Results began to be seen in 1948 when U.S. President Harry S. Truman
desegregated the U.S. Armed Forces and 1954 when Brown v. Board of Education mandated that schools
be desegregated.—Ed.

CHRISTOPHER BUCK / BETTY J. FISHER


That stage is represented by the emergence of the “common-cause” type of move-
ment. In these the racial cause is taken up into the substance of a general program
and struggle for common human advance. These new and increasingly powerful
causes are interracial and intercultural movements in which the full signi³cance and
force of interracialism for the ³rst time comes to full ·ower. They are such move-
ments where people of di²erent race and cultural groups work together not as
representatives of particular groups but as co-workers and collaborators in a common
cause in which, however, their special group interests are soundly and usefully
incorporated. We might cite as current and signi³cant instances, each of them
incorporating e²ectively the ³ght for Negro rights and full privilegds [sic], the recent
programs of the National Maritime Union, the CIO labor movement as today
o¹cially committed to the principle of equal labor rights for the Negro, the Southern
Farm Tenant’s [sic] Association, and the like; [sic] all of them expressing e²ectively
common denominators of speci³c aspects of the Negro’s problems.22
   More and more the intelligent younger generation will come to see in such move-
ments the best working base for Negro work and social e²ort. They will ³nd in such
movements the right and only ³nal way of being soundly and modernly inter-racial.
This applies, I think, to many other provinces which we have not time to illustrate,
including professional, intellectual, cultural and religious organization[s]. Indeed in
the intellectual and cultural ³eld there is already a trend—and a healthy one, to
replace the “racial” concept with a sounder and broader term—intercultural. This
includes all minority problems and situations, the religious and cultural as well as
the strictly racial; and it will be the basis in the near future of most of the e²orts
of progressive educators to teach understanding, tolerance and cultural democracy
between all groups in our national and world society. We need, to repeat, a broad
social mindedness which will link our racial cause to the progressive trends and
movements of our time, that will o²set on the one hand the damage of “ghetto-
mindedness[”] and on the other, the other the [sic] pitfalls of counter-racialism.




ALAIN LOCKE: ON BECOMING WORLD CITIZENS23
Two years after delivering a commencement address at Hampton Institute in Virginia, Alain
Locke delivered another such address to the University of Wisconsin High School’s thirty-³fth


   22. The National Maritime Union, founded in 1936 by Joseph Curran, lobbied for increased wages,
overtime pay, better food, improved working conditions, and the end to discrimination on ships. The
Committee for Industrial Organization (CIO), formed in 1935 by John L. Lewis within the American
Federation of Labor (AFL), organized by industry (as opposed to by occupation or skill) workers and
unskilled workers not included in the AFL. The CIO accepted African Americans and others excluded
from unions. In 1938, after eight unions that formed the CIO were expelled from the AFL, they
founded the Congress of Industrial Organizations. The Southern Tenant Farmers Union was formed in
Arkansas in 1934 and soon spread to other states. It gave voice to the treatment of small tenant farmers,
sharecroppers, and farm laborers.—Ed.

graduating class. Locke had been a visiting professor at the University of Wisconsin in
Madison during the 1945–46 academic year, which had been immensely rewarding both
personally and philosophically.24 But much had changed between the August 1944 address on
the East Coast and the 28 May 1946, address in the Midwest. In 1945 World War II had
ended, and the United Nations, of which Locke was an early and vocal champion, had been
formed.25 The watershed changes provided Locke with the thesis of his talk—the need for
world citizenship.
   In addressing the need for a new kind of education, Locke apologized for the “messy world”
the graduating students were inheriting from their elders, with its “indi²erence, intolerance,
narrow heartedness, and closed mindedness.” Instead of asking educators to take up the
matter of education for worldmindedness, Locke spoke directly to the students, urging them
(and their generation) to ³nd “answers to the problems of world citizenship.” He asked them
to take up the “battle for world peace, world order, world understanding” by rejecting the
outmoded beliefs in our country right or wrong, in our civilization and institutions being
appropriate for the entire world, and in our one-way relationships with the peoples and
nations that diminish con³dence and respect—attitudes that, unfortunately, still are prevalent
in the twenty-³rst century. To illustrate his point, Locke drew on two personality types: ³rst,
the “blatant, cocksure[,] narrow-minded patriot” returning from war with a mind-set that
would lead to a “domineering, cocksure world of a formula,” and, second, the returning
soldier who had been “sobered” and who was not so sure of “what it is all about.” The second
type of person, Locke said, had a mind-set open to the “educative life of live and learn, the
helpful life of give and take, the inner spirit of humane democracy”—Locke’s only reference
to democracy in the address. A more “·exible” and “higher” patriotism, he asserted, would be
found when the generation of the graduating class sought “other yardsticks for civilization and
culture, another attitude toward human di²erences of all kinds—social, religious, racial,
and cultural.” By so doing, Locke concluded, the students would be making an e²ort “toward
extending the geography” of their minds and “enlarging the diameters” of their hearts.
   What Locke calls “world citizenship”—a familiar term in Bahá’í religious discourse—
represents the individual’s role in building what Locke called in other of his writings “world
democracy” and in the address to the University of Wisconsin High School “humane democracy.”
Locke’s vision is both secular and religious and may well represent, in part, a secular
articulation of his religious values as an adherent of the Bahá’í Faith.

    25. In 1942 Locke, during World War II, wrote about the United Nations: “‘Signi³cantly enough,
the Phalanx of the United Nations unites an unprecedented assemblage of the races, cultures and
peoples of the world. Could this war-born assemblage be welded by a constructive peace into an
e²ective world order—one based on the essential parity of peoples and a truly democratic reciprocity of
cultures—world democracy would be within reach of attainment’” (Alain Locke, “The Un³nished
Business of Democracy,” Survey Graphic: Magazine of Social Interpretation, 31 (November 1942): 456,
quoted in Buck, Alain Locke 258. On August 4, 1944, while World War II raged on, Locke spoke on the
air in Denver on Adelaide Hawley’s radio program called Women’s Page of the Air, saying, “‘Just as the
foundation of democracy as a national principle made necessary the declaration of the basic equality of
persons, so the founding of international democracy must guarantee the basic equality of human groups’”

Thank you, Mr. Chairman, for your kind and generous introduction, and you,
Ladies and Gentlemen, for your very cordial welcome. It heightens with keen
pleasure the honor of participating in this occasion. But we are all here, you and
I together, to honor and encourage these young graduates: it is their occasion, their
hour of accomplishment and satisfaction. So I feel I can presume upon your even
deeper bond of connection with them as their devoted teachers, parents, relatives
and friends, by assuming that I have your consent and approval to address my
remarks this evening directly to them.
    My dear Young Friends of the Class of ‘46:
    When you asked me to be your commencement speaker, I felt both delighted
and honored, and still do. Indeed, the ³rst thing to be done is to thank you for
this compliment, so full of the eager curiosity, the kindly con³dence, the gallant
natural democracy of youth. My best return is a graduation wish that you may have
a life and a world in which these native qualities of youth can live and expand,
instead of having to be cramped, con³ned and eventually extinguished by their cold
dead opposites of indi²erence, intolerance, narrow heartedness, closed mindedness.
And somehow, although in these critical days I cannot be a prophet of sentimental,
all-is-well optimism, I do hope and believe it will be so, and this wish may come
true. Though I am forced to confess that the odds are barely even, and that it will
not easily become so. It is because I have regard for your respect and con³dence
that I cannot regale you, even on this happy occasion, with easy, hollow platitudes,
which even your young but alert minds would know not really to be true. But on
the other hand, I am glad that, since I cannot swing incense to Pollyanna, I do
not ³nd it necessary on the other hand, to be a gloomy Jeremiah or even too much
of a Doubting Thomas. I hope, therefore, even though I have chosen a serious theme,
not to take too much o² the keen edge of the youthful pleasure to which you, and
by proxy, your teachers, friends and parents are rightfully entitled tonight.
    When your spokesman, Miss Becker, conveyed your invitation, I knew what I
wanted to talk about, and gave her this subject—On Becoming World Citizens. I
thought I knew what I was going to say, but as it turned out, I gave myself more
homework than I anticipated; for there are no ready answers on this subject. Indeed,
it is your generation that will have to ³nd the exact answers to the problems of world
citizenship. We elders can only give hints from our own not too successful expe-
rience, and then, if we are quite honest, apologize to you for the messy world that
in time we must hand over to you, for better or worse, for losing or keeping. Yet
even so, you are to be congratulated, I think, on ³nishing the most critical stage
of your preparation for life at a similarly critical and signi³cant stage of the world’s
life. Your adolescence happens to coincide with the early adolescence of a new sort
of world. In terms of the old calendar, you are the human crop of 1946; in the
new calendar, you date A.A. 1—year one of the atomic age.26 And that means
something—how much and how signi³cant, none of us can yet tell or say.

intense Allied ³re bombing of Japanese cities, U.S. President Harry S. Truman authorized the dropping

    This much we do know—that you just escaped having to risk your lives directly
in the World War which was the critical climax of this great change. But you are
nevertheless, along with your contemporaries, boys and girls alike, picked to be the
shock troops of the next phase of the struggle—the not easy and not too certain
battle for world peace, world order, world understanding. Some of you will probably
serve in distant lands as part of an army of occupation, others of you will be even
luckier to serve in e²orts toward internationalism more constructive than armies of
occupation. The life careers of many of you will have international scope and pur-
pose, even while remaining national enterprises; all of you will have new dimensions
added to your work and living, no matter how local and domestic they may be.
In short, you will have to acquire world citizenship as our present age works out
its speci³cations, its duties, its privileges. It is cowardly and reactionary in the
presence of youth to contemplate any other alternative, although you all know and
can meditate at will on the pithiest maxim of our time, the phrase—One World or
None.27
    Assuming the better and saner choice—One World, it becomes our most im-
portant common task to give practical body and substance to an age-old dream of
human brotherhood, now become a crying need, a modern necessity. And the nub
of that task, as I see it, lies in an enlightenment of mind and heart capable of making
us e²ective world citizens. World organization, the skeletal framework of all this,
is the problem of the experts, our statesmen—God grant them more wisdom and
much more grace!28 But world citizenship is the vital ·esh and blood the rest of
us must add to this framework, through which alone it can live and move and have
some real e²ective being. For the moment this is a ba¼ing task, but as it moves
in your lifetimes further along toward solution, it may also appear not as just a
strange new duty and responsibility but as a thrilling challenge and opportunity.
    But let us be more speci³c about all this, which is the only way to become prac-
tical. World citizenship, in addition to calling for better citizenship at home and

organization started by American scientists who worked on the Manhattan Project, which developed the
atomic bomb. The book was the FAS’s ³rst attempt to explain to the public how the bomb worked, what
its e²ects were, and what its implications, political and military, might be. Writing about the book in
2007, Ivan Oelrich, Vice-President of the Strategic Security Program of the FAS, noted that the book
was “widely discussed and reviewed, almost entirely favorably” (see www.fas.org/pubs/_docs/
one_world_or_none_intro_Ivan_2007.pdf ). Locke was on the cutting edge with these two references to
the work in his May 1946 commencement address.—Ed.
    28. Locke is referring to the United Nations, which was established on October 24, 1945. According
to the Preamble to its Charter, the organization determined “to save succeeding generations from the
scourge of war, . . . to rea¹rm faith in fundamental human rights, in the dignity and worth of the
human person, in the equal rights of men and women and of nations large and small, and to establish
conditions under which justice and respect for the obligations arising from treaties and other sources of
international law can be maintained, and to promote social progress and better standards of life in larger
freedom. . . .”—Ed.

in terms of the old speci³cations, calls for new outlooks, new values, and more im-
portantly even, the re-casting of some of our old outlooks and values. Many of our
present ways of acting and thinking are too narrow, too provincial, too sel³sh to
provide a sound basis for world citizenship. Following common, present-day practice
will never permit us to achieve it.
    Let us, for example, ask ourselves a few concrete questions about world citizen-
ship. Will acting on the basis of our country, right or wrong, or even our country
³rst and last, ever develop a true and vital internationalism? Can the idea of our
form of civilization and our particular pet institutions, not as just best for us, but
as arbitrarily best for everyone, everywhere ever lead us to the proper appreciation
of other cultures and nations or to smooth-working collaboration with them? Will
any one-way relations, rather than give-and-take ones, ever develop the con³dence
and respect of nations and peoples di²erent from us in their ways and traditions?
To me, it seems the answer to all three of these questions is—No. That type of
thought and behavior will not promote world understanding and therefore is not
the proper path for those who would become world citizens.
    If this is so, what does it mean? Well, as I said at the beginning, some decided
enlargement of our customary viewpoints, some de³nite reform of our traditional
attitudes. It means a more ·exible patriotism, if not indeed a higher patriotism, other
yardsticks for civilization and culture, another attitude toward human di²erences
of all kinds—social, religious, racial, cultural. It means more civility in our civi-
lization; and more fair-play and good sportsmanship in our diplomacy and our
politics. That means, to put it both pointedly and brie·y, better group manners.
These, my young friends, are not things that have to wait on juster peace treaties,
perfected United Nations organization, better world government. In some respects,
only their cultivation in a larger part of our population will lead us to these other
desirable ends. Indeed, these are the real ends of world citizenship, and they grow
in individuals, and should, I think, be somehow rooted in education. For nowadays,
it is important that the majority of us have such outlooks, standards and attitudes,
and not just the few exceptional individuals of outstanding importance. We all need
these enlarged perspectives, not just those who travel in clipper planes or who are
hauled overseas in transports, but also those who, while they stay at home in city,
town or farm, must read, listen, argue, vote, contribute, and understand intelligently
this growing inter-dependence and collaboration of our widening world-life.
    Let us be even more concrete about all this: I think I can bring some of these
qualities of world citizenship within testing range of your own experiences, young
though they are. Each of you within your own circle of friends and acquaintances,
and in terms of personalities only four or ³ve years older than yourselves[,] has,
in all likelihood, evidence of the di²erence, at least in basic attitude, between the
old and the new style citizen. A thumb-nail sketch of the two opposite types of
personality will give us suggestive clues that you can check on for yourselves. You
all know some acquaintance back from overseas who, despite his widened and
potentially broadening experience, has come back the hardened image of his same
old self, still a provincial[,] only forti³ed with a chestful of war ribbons. He is your

super-patriot, full of “we won the war,” and “we showed them how,” “all Frenchmen
are this,” “all Germans that,” and as to the Italians—well, you can imagine. Surely
you recognize him. Of course, according to him, “we could have straightened up
Europe in a ji²y, if they would only let us do it,” only “now that we have shown
them how, they ought to be able to do it for themselves,” or possibly, “They aren’t
worth it, anyhow,” and of course, “everything is alright [sic] at home” or would be
“if only[”]—and here for “if only” ³ll in the fellow’s pet peeve, which he assumes
without asking, you should share with him; otherwise, “there is something wrong
with you.”
    I hope you recognize also the opposite to this blatant, cocksure[,] narrow-minded
professional patriot, the type that returns neither so sure of himself nor of what
it is all about, but sobered and sometimes silent, whom it takes a good while to
discover has come back transformed in intelligence and in human sympathy and
understanding. I admit, he doesn’t ³t in just right with the village or small-town
mentality, or with the gang psychology or the latest slogans. This chap isn’t that
sure about things, or that hasty to accept ready-made answers. He is far from sure
that “all Frenchmen are like that” or “all Germans are this and that”; he may even
be disposed to admit that Americans have some faults and made some mistakes.
He is no professional patriot and may not be an immediately impressive fellow, but
most promising of all, his opinions can grow and change. Potentially he is a better
American; he is ripe for maturing world citizenship.
    Of course, I do not mean that the issue between good and bad citizenship rests
on these two personality types, but the attitudes they typify are an important con-
trast and teach a great lesson. The one leads to the domineering, cocksure world
of a formula and a blinkered and pro³tless experience, no matter how otherwise
wide and educative. The other leads to the educative life of live and learn, the helpful
life of give and take, the inner spirit of humane democracy. I hope, on second
thought, you ³nd the latter the more attractive, the more promising, the kernel,
let us say, of the good world citizen.
    Now, ³nally, let us not look at types but at real historical persons, two outstanding
world citizens who were and are the better Americans by virtue of being elastic,
progressive and courageous enough to become world citizens and crusaders for world
citizenship. They need no thumb-nail sketches; so well-known are they that their
mere names will su¹ce. But before I tell you these, let us notice what they teach
us about the ³nest possibilities of world citizenship. I think you will agree with me
when you hear their names that the best world citizenship also makes the best type
of national citizenship, much as many say it doesn’t. They teach us further that this
type of citizenship is the monopoly of no political party, sex or class: one was
politically a Democrat, the other a Republican, one a man, the other a woman, one,
an American aristocrat, the other, a man of the people. One was from the sophis-
ticated [E]ast, the other, essentially a mid-Westerner. Both grew, by obvious and
gradual learning stages to the stature of world citizenship, one from a retiring,
secluded housewife and mother; the other, from another narrow cocoon—the hard-
minded, pro³t-making life of a typical American industrialist. Perhaps, by now, like

the radio identi³cation game, you have guessed them. But I am sure none of you
can contest the statement that Eleanor Roosevelt and the late Wendell Willkie are
among the best American exponents of world citizenship.29
   Notice, if you please, how these personalities spell out a brief de³nition of world
citizenship—the same moral yardstick for ourselves as for others, and the courage
to make its two plus two equals four apply[,] whether for or against us, whether
for democracy abroad or at home. And yet, with it all[,] no insistence on uniformity
in order to achieve unity. Very simple, my young friends, but awfully di¹cult. Both
Mr. Willkie and Mrs. Roosevelt were courageous enough to speak out against the
lacks and incompletenesses of our own democracy, and they each thought that one
of our best ways of helping the world toward democracy was to put our own house
in order. But they opened also both their hearts and minds to the whole world as
well and tried to practice what we have been talking about tonight—world citizen-
ship.
   In some respects all really great personalities transcend the limits of their par-
ticular groups and break through to the world plane of living. But we cannot much
longer trust to the occasional happy exception; at least with respect to world outlook,
the exception must in our day become the rule. Instead of leaving world citizenship
to chance and inclination, we must through education make the average citizen
world-minded, world-hearted, as loyal to humanity as to his country[,] as eager
about world welfare as about that of himself and his nation.

    29. Eleanor Roosevelt, the wife of U.S. President Franklin D. Roosevelt, was a formidable and
controversial ³gure in the liberal and political issues she supported. In the 1920s she worked for the
League of Women Voters and the Women’s Trade Union League. In the 1930s the Great Depression led
her to support a program for youth employment, the National Youth Administration. She promoted
racial equality, including the desegregation of the U.S. Armed Forces. In 1939 she resigned from the
Daughters of the American Revolution when the organization denied the use of their facilities to
African American opera singer Marian Anderson and arranged a concert for Anderson at the Lincoln
Memorial, which attracted some seventy-³ve thousand people. In 1945 U.S. President Harry S. Truman
appointed her a delegate to the United Nations, where she chaired the Commission on Human Rights
and saw to the adoption in 1948 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.
    Republican Wendell Willkie ran against Democrat Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1940, opposing Roosevelt’s
bid for a third term and some of his New Deal policies. Defeated by an enormous majority, Willkie,
nevertheless, supported Roosevelt when the United States entered World War II in 1941. In 1942
Willkie traveled to Allied countries as Roosevelt’s semio¹cial envoy and published in 1943 One World, a
book opposing isolationism and advocating world peace.—Ed.

ALAIN LOCKE: CREATIVE DEMOCRACY31
The certain facts about Alain Locke’s “Creative Democracy” are that he delivered the talk in
the evening in May in Minnesota. In his “Literary” agenda for “1946– 47” Locke wrote in his
own hand “Creative Democracy for Minnesota May 1 & 2.” 32 But, since Lock’s schedule
revolved around the fall-to-spring academic year, he could have given the talk in 1946 or
1947, May 1947 being more likely. Nothing in the text of the talk reveals the place in
Minnesota, the occasion, or the nature of the audience. The pithy nature of the talk, echoing
in some ways Locke’s “The Preservation of the Democratic Ideal,” suggests that it may have
been a “seed” talk meant to prompt the audience to consider the concept of democracy in a
larger context than the term is often considered.
   Just as Locke had much to say about race during the span of his academic life, he also
devoted a great deal of philosophical thought to democracy over many decades, constantly
re³ning and adding to his conception of the many facets of the term.33 In “Creative
Democracy” he challenged his audience to see democracy as a “dynamic, changing and
developing concept,” as something always to be considered in an “expanding context”—a
theme on which he touched brie·y in the third paragraph of “The Preservation of the
Democratic Ideal.” He noted that democracy in the United States began with a contradiction
that approved slavery and denied into the twentieth century the right of women to vote. At
the outset it also lacked the “adult principle of abstract freedom of conscience.” Unfair taxes by
the British added “political freedom and the liberty of self-government.” The industrial
experience brought the “gradually acquired sense of collective responsibility.” In “Stretching

discussed spiritual democracy. In 1938, in “Peace between Black and White,” he discussed democracy in
terms of economics. In 1941, in “Five Phases of Democracy: Farewell Address at Talledega College,” he
discussed ³ve phases of democracy: local, moral, political, economic, and cultural. As noted in the
introductory headnote, Locke, over the years, considered democracy in at least nine di²erent spheres of
human experience: local, moral, political, economic, cultural, racial, social, spiritual, and global. See

                                                  relationships, advocating replacing them with
                                                  worldmindedness. In “Creative Democracy”
                                                  he again advocated replacing the outmoded
                                                  with new understandings: democracy, he
                                                  asserted, is like a living organism that “must
                                                  grow” and mature with each generation to
                                                  be kept “alive.”


                                                 Let us admit at the very outset that “de-
                                                 mocracy” is an overworked term, and to
                                                 make matters worse, has always been a

done if we use democracy as a ·ag-word, for to do that is to place it immediately
beyond both reason and common-sense. Regarded as sacrosanct, it is all set to be
used as a stalking-horse for our own pet dogmas and special interpretations. In this
respect, we may not ourselves be successful this evening, but there is virtue in trying.
    One most e²ective way of assuring that we are 35 both rational and realistic in
any consideration of democracy, and thus free from the dogmatism and cant of
professional patriotism and word-worship, is to keep constantly in mind how in-
disputably democracy has historically changed and enlarged its meaning, acquiring
from generation to generation new scope, added objectives, fresh sanctions. We can
scarcely make a fetish of our own or even our generation’s version of democracy
if we recall that once in the minds of all but a few radical democrats like Je²erson,
democracy was compatible with such obvious contradictions as slavery and has even
much later seemed adequate in spite of such limitations equally obvious to us now
as the disfranchis[e]ment of women, complete disregard of public responsibility for
education, no provision36 for social security and the like.37 Such sobering facts
forestall, or should, any tendency, however traditional and popular, to put democ-
racy above realistic analysis or beyond objective and constructive criticism. If de-

mocracy hasn’t always meant the same thing, how can we be so sure that its present
compass of meaning is so permanent or so fully adequate? It seems absolutely
essential, then, to treat democracy as a dynamic, changing and developing concept,
to consider it always in terms of an expanding context, and to realize that like any
embodiment of human values, it must grow in order to keep alive. Except as
progressive and creative, democracy both institutionally and ideologically stagnates.
For the little time that we have for considering democracy together this evening,
let us try to construe it in this living, dynamic way.
   Our American tradition of democracy, let us remember, began merely as a pas-
sionate rationalization of religious non-conformism, the conscientious demand of
a convinced minority about freedom of worship and the moral liberty of conscience.
And at that time, it had not even matured to the adult principle of abstract freedom
of conscience as the religious intolerances of the colonial settlers proved; migrating
non-conformists themselves, they still could not stand the presence of non-confor-
mity in their midst. Then later came that political and secular strand of colonial
experience which out of the ³ght against tyranny and taxation grew into the issue
of political freedom and the liberty of self-government. But even then, when these
developments had been fought for and won, and were being institutionalized, it took
another strain of radical thinking imported from Revolutionary France to consoli-
date this into a formally democratic doctrine, the fundamental historical creed of
American democracy that we know so well and rightly treasure so highly. But do
we really understand it? Hardly, because it has been taught us for the most part,
and we still teach it for the most part, in terms of abstract formulas, which means
that knowing little realistically about its development, we know it, like most cat-
echisms, by taking it for granted.
   Little wonder, then, that through considering democratic principles so non-
historically, we know and advocate them in such a chronicly [sic] dogmatic and
doctrinnaire [sic] way.38 And another consequence even worse, [sic] than this, we
do not expect democracy to change and do not fully realize the necessity for its
constant growth.
   Here is not the place, perhaps, to trace in any considerable detail other steps in
the successive maturing of the democratic tradition in America;[:] the personal
initiative and personal responsibility motifs born of the frontier, the gradually
acquired sense of collective social responsibility stemming from industrial experience
and organization, the hard-won sense of the dignity and rights of labor based on
labor’s own gradual self-assertion, and the like. All of these enlargements of demo-
cratic thought and practise [sic] in the perspective of one trained to expect democracy
to evolve are viewed and accepted in a natural and meaningful way as part of a
necessary process.



   38. Locke, in the ³nal line of page 2 of his typescript, typed “dogmatic and doctrinnaire [sic] way.
And another even worse consequence.” On the ³rst line on page 3 he repeated “dogmatic and
doctrinnaire way,” but he reversed the order of the words in “And another consequence even worse.”
We have chosen the text Locke typed on page 3.—Ed.
