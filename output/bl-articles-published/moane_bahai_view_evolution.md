Book Review and Commentary: A Bahá’í View of

Evolution by Eamonn Moane
Brown, Keven and Eberhard von Kitzing (eds) Evolution and Bahá’í
Belief: ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s Response to Nineteenth Century Darwinism (Los
Angeles: Kalímat Press, 2001), 278 pages.

Introduction
One of the fundamental beliefs of the Bahá’í Faith is the harmony
of religion and science, faith and reason, heart and mind. The past
three to four centuries have been an age dominated by science and
reason increasingly severed from their theological and
philosophical underpinnings. In the conflicts that have arisen
between science and religion, the latter has appeared to lose. This
has been due mainly to religion’s man-made dogmas and rituals
based on a primarily literal interpretation of sacred Scripture.
Science must also accept some of the blame because it can tend to
make unjustified speculative claims about its findings, especially
concerning the origin and meaning of existence. Yet as ‘Abdu’l-
Bahá states, there can be no disagreement between the conclusions
of sound scientific thinking and a correct reading of Scripture,
because the physical universe is a shadow or reflection of an
eternal spiritual realm:

> Know that this material world is the mirror of the Kingdom,
> and each of these worlds is in complete correspondence with
> the other. The correct theories of this world which are the
> result of sound scientific thinking are in agreement with the
> divine verses without the slightest divergence between
> them.1

The whole issue of evolution is of truly world historic
importance because, arguably, no single idea has been more
responsible for the decline of religious belief in the West than
Darwin’s theory of evolution published in The Origin of Species in
1859\. This is particularly so because of the sweeping claims that
have been made about the theory since Darwin’s time, and the fact
that it has become one of the most influential doctrines of the
modern age. Darwin’s work appeared to strike at the foundation

of the religious view that God created all species separately,
essentially in their present form, according to a divine plan, and
linked them together in the great, continuous Chain of Being, with
Man at the apex. Instead, the diversity of species was due to
mechanical processes of random variations in organisms and
natural selection by a changing environment of those variations
best fitted to survive, with no goal or direction to the whole
process and in which human purpose and destiny seemed to have
no place.

This book is an impressive exposition of the Bahá’í view of a
religious and scientific issue central to our understanding of our
own nature and the meaning of our existence. The Bahá’í Faith
affirms a harmonious belief in both divine creation and evolution.
However, evolution is a process of development within a species,
not of one species evolving by chance into another. The human
species is a divinely created separate species that has always
existed somewhere in the universe. Man has evolved on Earth as a
separate species, with his physical, intellectual and spiritual
evolution divinely guided for a divine purpose.

The book is also a powerful reminder of how modern science
has become severed from its metaphysical (i.e. philosophical and
theological) foundations. In this context, philosophy is concerned
with true knowledge and understanding about the origin and
purpose, and general causes and principles, of phenomena, while
natural theology deals with the knowledge of God as gained from
studying the workings of His creation.

Overview of Subject Matter of Book
This is the first Bahá’í book to give such a rigorous treatment of the
broad religious, philosophical and scientific aspects of one issue. It
has over 500 endnotes and a very extensive bibliography of a wide
range of sources, Bahá’í and non-Bahá’í, religious, philosophical
and scientific. For the interested layperson without a background
in philosophy or science, the book requires a concerted effort to be
understood.

The book consists of two long essays by two Bahá’ís. The first
essay by Keven Brown, a specialist in Near Eastern languages and
cultures, focuses mainly on the philosophical issues relating to
species and evolution. It starts with the philosophical response to

Darwin’s theory in the West and in the Arab world. It then deals
with the historical development of philosophical concepts of
creation, species and evolution, from ancient Greece to the
Nineteenth Century. It finally covers ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s response to
Darwinism.

The second essay by Eberhard von Kitzing, a specialist in
theoretical physics and biochemical evolution, focuses on how
‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s views on evolution compare with the concepts of
Nineteenth-Century biology and modern biology and cosmology.
It covers the scientific challenge of Darwin to the then-prevailing
scientific orthodoxy, looks at modern Western scientific concepts
of species and evolution, considers the broader issues of the origin
of complex order in the universe, and of cosmology, and discusses
‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s statements and their compatibility with modern
science.

It was originally intended to have a third article, by a non-
Bahá’í scientist and practising evolutionary biologist, Dr Ronald
Somerby, but it was not ready in time. This is unfortunate, as it
would have added a broader perspective to the book.

The authors have different views on the extent to which
‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s statements on evolution are to be taken literally.
Brown’s approach ‘is to assume that ‘Abdu’l-Bahá intended his
words on this subject to be taken at face value’ (Preface xix). In
contrast to Brown, von Kitzing assumes that ‘the statements of
‘Abdu’l-Bahá about evolution are not intended to be a detailed
explanation of cosmogony and biological evolution. They are
understood rather as seminal statements from which Bahá’í
scholars may develop a relevant Bahá’í philosophy’ (p. 141).
Different interpretations of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s words are possible and
depend crucially on what He meant by the term ‘human species.’
Von Kitzing emphasises that his essay ‘does not address the
question of the particular mechanisms of evolution as such’ (p.
142). Both authors agree, however, that ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s response to
Darwinism was more philosophical than scientific in nature. Their
articles aim to present interpretations of His statements on
evolution that are in accordance with reason and scientific facts.

Concepts of ‘Species’
Central to both essays are two different ways of thinking about the
meaning of ‘species.’ The classical approach up to the Nineteenth
Century had thought of a species as a fixed, timeless entity or
‘species essence’, the law or blueprint or idea in the mind of God
that determines the essential attributes of its biological
counterpart. While variations in the biological form could occur
over time, they could never stray from the limits set by the species
essence. Natural selection merely eliminates accidental
characteristics. This view that each species was created by design
and for a purpose is known as ‘teleological thinking.’

The central theme of Darwin’s theory is that all biological
species, including man, are not divinely created or fixed realities of
nature, but have descended from common ancestors by a
continuous process of branching. Accidental variations in a
species, if beneficial for survival in the environment, would be
selected by natural selection and hence be the basis of a new
species. Only the individual members of a species are real, not the
species itself, which is a mere mental classification or construct. A
species is defined as a population of particular interbreeding
organisms that can produce fertile offspring. This approach is
known today as ‘population thinking.’

Brown gives a comprehensive review of the development of
philosophical ideas about the meaning of species, from ancient
Greece to the Nineteenth Century. Plato taught that a species was
determined by an immaterial archetypal Form or Idea beyond the
grasp of the human mind and that these Ideas or Essences are the
true timeless realities existing independently of the biological
populations of particular members. This corresponds with fixed
species and teleological thinking, and is closer to the Bahá’í view.
However, Aristotle believed that a species was determined solely
by its biological forms and assumed that the existence of particular
members of a biological population is sufficient to maintain the
species. Species was therefore a mental construct. This corresponds
with today’s population thinking.

Plato’s Forms and Ideas came to be regarded by the early
Christian Church Fathers as the Word of God, or Logos, by which
God created the world. Augustine has God create seminal seeds
that manifest themselves over time as environmental conditions

become suitable. Most later Muslim thinkers were in effect
Neoplatonists. They believed that God’s knowledge is the cause
for the existence of all things, and that the Platonic forms are the
immaterial roots of the biological members of species. The species
appear when the physical environment is ready to receive them,
and remain static over time.

Mullá Sadra (1571-1640) added the dimension of motion or
‘becoming’ to existence, and to the physical realisation over time of
the fixed species essences that he regarded as part of God’s
changeless Essence. Shaykh Ahmad al-Ahsá’í (1753-1825), one of
the two forerunners of the Báb, made a continuous process of
action and becoming the very foundation of existence, allowing for
a process of continuous evolution or becoming within individuals
and species, and indeed within all systems in the universe. The
species essences were created or activated by the Will of God, and
were not part of His changeless Essence.

Von Kitzing explains how classical biology of the Eighteenth
and early Nineteenth Century was essentialist, with the species
essence being the unchanging idea in the mind of God of the ideal
form of the members of a biological population. It was impossible
that a species could change or evolve. The dominant concept was
of a static unchanging world of short duration. Some scientists had
a more mechanistic view of a universe created by God, Who then
let it run on a few laws, while others believed in natural theology,
which considered nature to be the result of the direct and detailed
providence of God. The first challenge to this world view came
from Lamarck (1744-1829), who was the first to propose a
systematic theory of biological evolution, such that all species
descended from earlier less complex forms. In addition, growing
geological evidence began to imply that the world must be much
older than the 6,000 years suggested by a literal reading of the
Bible. Nevertheless, there was no essential contradiction between
theology and biology until the mid-Nineteenth Century.

Evolution Thinking Since Darwin
The above was the background and context in which Darwin’s
Origin of Species was published. Brown points out that Darwin
never claimed to explain the origin of life. He proposed that God
breathed life into a number of first primitive species, established

general but not detailed laws of nature, and then allowed the
mechanisms of random variations and natural selection to
gradually transform these common first forms into today’s wide
diversity of species. He did not claim that recent species derived
from other recent species.

Darwin appeared to replace divine creation and teleology
with natural selection by the environment of random beneficial
biological variations, and to replace a theological with a scientific
explanation of species. Proofs advanced by Darwin and his
followers to support evolution include: rudimentary trace organs
in man from an earlier stage of evolution; the stages of human
embryonic development (ontogeny) recapitulating the stages of
human biological evolution (phylogeny); the similarity of
geographically isolated species; morphological similarity between
species; and the fossil record showing the oldest layers of rock
containing fossils of the most primitive species. However, the
fossil record does not show transitional forms of species, but
species appearing suddenly, remaining for a long time and then
suddenly disappearing. The punctuated equilibrium theory of
Gould and Eldredge, suggesting sudden leaps forward in
evolution followed by long periods of stasis, tries to explain this.

Von Kitzing surveys the development of modern thought on
evolution since Darwin. Life on Earth evolved from a pre-biotic
soup over billions of years, with random mutations and
recombinations in the genetic material of organisms being selected
by the environment based on fitness for survival. The concept of
species is based on individuals, not the fixed type, and is defined
as reproductively isolated populations occupying an ecological
niche. This removed purpose and direction from evolution and
transformed the whole philosophy of biology.

Monod, the French Nobel Prize winner, regarded evolution
as the emergence of new biological characteristics, based on
chance. Dawkins, today’s best-known exponent of reductionist
Darwinian thinking, maintains that cumulative natural selection,
by many small and gradual steps, is the only explanation for life’s
complexity and is the driving force of evolution. Evolution is the
opposite of chance because, while mutations are random, natural
selection is not: evolution is not teleological. However, as Ward
points out, the gradual appearance of order requires the same level

of explanation as its sudden emergence. The Bahá’í writer, William
Hatcher, argues that the development of life from more probable
simple forms to less probable complex forms, despite the universal
second law of thermodynamics, which states that all systems tend
towards increasing disorder (entropy), is non-random, and
requires a purposeful evolutionary force, which he calls God.

Von Kitzing contrasts ‘top down’ with ‘bottom up’ concepts
of the origin of order and complexity. Classical concepts are top
down, explaining complexity on intelligent design, and assuming
that complex order and purpose existed from the start. Later
Nineteenth-Century cosmology considered the universe to be
infinite in space and time, hence avoiding the problem of Ultimate
Cause. However, modern science seeks to explain complexity
based on cumulative random trivial causes, a bottom up concept.

Today the universe is considered to be finite in space and
time, with temporal causation starting with the Big Bang. Dennett
proposes a kind of ‘Darwinian cosmology’ by cosmological
selection, with perhaps ‘a timeless Platonic possibility of order’ (p.
178), but with no explanation for initiation or origin. Hence
modern science merely assumes the a priori existence of
complexity, and the non-existence of a scientific explanation for
evolution. It ignores the fact that natural laws must be more
complex than the particular structures they produce, and require
explanation.

Interestingly, von Kitzing notes that while biology has
rejected species essences, physics and chemistry remain
essentialistic, with their general laws considered invariant in place
and time throughout the universe.

Brown surveys how most Nineteenth-Century Arab thinkers
(in particular al-Isfáháni), in their reaction to Darwinism, focused
on its philosophical and social implications. They criticised
Darwin’s postulate that all species now existing were generated
from a single germ over millions of years of natural action as being
against sound intelligence. They maintained that the religious
Scriptures are clear on the independent creation of species, but not
on whether they were created all at once or independently, and
they accepted progress towards perfection within independently
created species. They also rejected the materialistic idea that the
actions and powers of the soul are no more than the effects of

matter, and that human feelings and intelligence are merely the
actions of the brain. Rather, the mind is independent of the brain,
which is merely the instrument of the mind.

‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s Response to Darwinism
The final sections of both essays focus on ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s response
to Darwinism. Brown puts more emphasis on the philosophical
aspects of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s response and he helpfully provides new
or improved translations of His statements on evolution (mainly in
Some Answered Questions). Von Kitzing covers ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s
statements from a broader scientific and cosmological perspective.

In summary, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá understood species in its Platonic
archetype sense as referring to a divine reality outside of time and
space. The species is primarily that immaterial essence by which
its biological form exists. Evolution (progress and development)
takes place within the species itself and is the movement of the
living species towards its own perfection. Species are not derived
gradually and haphazardly from each other.

‘Abdu’l-Bahá states that creation or formation can be of three
kinds only: accidental, necessary, or voluntary. He rules out
formation occurring by accident or chance (i.e. self-creation),
because every effect must have a cause preceding it. It cannot be
necessary because then the formation would be an inherent
property of the constituent parts, and change and decomposition
would be impossible. Voluntary creation by God for a purpose is
the only feasible explanation. However, creation is not directly by
God. The first emanation from God, outside of time and place, is
the First Intellect or Primal Will, located in the Will of God, not in
His Essence. This First Cause creates the species essences or
realities of things, which in turn leads to the physical existence of
things when environmental conditions are correct.

Bahá’u’lláh states that the very existence of a transcendent,
infinite and eternal God requires a creation which is ‘infinite in its
range and deathless in its duration.’2 ‘Abdu’l-Bahá says that to
imagine a time when no creation existed would be a denial of the
divinity of God, because the eternal attributes of God would not
then be manifest. However, the evolution of the universe is
necessary for God’s timeless creation to emerge in place and time

and to manifest His signs. Hence creation and evolution are
complementary and mutually necessary processes. Motion and
change are essential aspects of creation:

> Creation is the expression of motion, and motion is life ... All
> created forms are progressive in their planes, or kingdoms of
> existence, under the stimulus of the power or spirit of life.
> The universal energy is dynamic. Nothing is stationary in the
> material world of outer phenomena or in the inner world of
> intellect and consciousness.3

‘Abdu’l-Bahá’ gives two main arguments against the
modification and derivation of the human species from a lower
species by chance. The first argument is that the eternal existence
of the human species is necessary to act as a mirror of God’s
created names and attributes. If the human species (the reality or
species essence of man) ever did not exist, the chief member of
God’s creation would be missing, and the creation would be
imperfect:

> The reflection of the divine perfections appears in the reality
> of man, so he is the representative of God, the messenger of
> God. If man did not exist the universe would be without
> result, for the object of existence is the appearance of the
> perfections of God. Therefore it cannot be said that there was
> a time when man was not. All that we can say is that this
> terrestrial globe at one time did not exist, and at its
> beginning man did not appear upon it. But from the
> beginning which has no beginning, to the end which has no
> end, a Perfect Manifestation always exists.4

The same argument applies to man’s existence on this planet:

> Now, if we imagine a time when man belonged to the animal
> world ... there would have been no man, and this chief
> member, which in the body of the world is like the brain and
> mind in man, would have been missing. The world would
> then have been quite imperfect.5

If there was no man, the perfections of the spirit would not
> appear, and the light of the mind would not be resplendent
> in the world. This world would be like a body without a
> soul.6

The second argument is that each being or species, including
man, requires a particular prescribed composition of elements, and
the right environmental conditions, to appear and exist:

... the perfection of each individual being ... is due to the
> composition of the elements, to their measure, to their
> balance, to the manner of their combination, and to the
> interaction and influence of other beings. In the case of man,
> when all these factors are gathered together, then man
> exists.7

‘Abdu’l-Bahá states that nothing comes into being
immediately in its perfect form, but everything grows and
develops with its perfections appearing by degree. Like a seed or
human embryo, all created things, large or small, are perfect and
complete from the start, but progress and development take place
by degrees within the species themselves:

> All beings, whether universal or particular, were created
> perfect and complete from the first, but their perfections
appear in them by degrees ...

Similarly the terrestrial globe from the beginning was
> created with all its elements, substances, minerals, atoms and
> organisms; but these only appeared by degrees; first the
> mineral, then the plant, afterward the animal, and finally
man. But from the first these kinds and species existed ...

When you consider this universal system, you see that
> there is not one of the beings which at its coming into being
> has reached the limit of perfection. No, they gradually grow
> and develop and then attain the degree of perfection.8

Hence the Earth, of which man is the fruit or chief member, also
evolved, with the more simple forms of existence appearing before
the more complex forms:

But it is clear that this terrestrial globe in its present form did
> not come into existence all at once, but that this universal
> existence gradually passed through different phases until it
> became adorned with its present perfection ... it is evident
> that this terrestrial globe, having once found existence, grew
> and developed in the matrix of the universe, and came forth
> in different forms and conditions, until gradually it attained
> this present perfection ... 9

‘Abdu’l-Bahá is emphatic that the human species has been
established from its origin as a separate species and has evolved as
such. The fact that it appeared after the animals is not proof that it
was derived from them:

> In the world of existence man has passed through various
> stages until he has attained the human kingdom. In each
> stage the capacity for ascent to the next stage has appeared.10
> It may be that in the beginning he was in the stage of a seed
> ... but that seed which evolved belonged to the human
> species, not an animal species.11
> Man’s existence on this earth, from the beginning until it
> reaches this state, form and condition, necessarily lasts a long
> time, and goes through many degrees until it reaches this
> condition. But from the beginning of man’s existence, he has
been a distinct species ... a man, not an animal.12

... the animal having preceded man is not a proof of the
> evolution, change and alteration of the species, nor that man
> was raised from the animal world to the human world ... For
> man, from the beginning of the embryonic period until he
> reaches the degree of maturity, goes through different forms
> and appearances ... Nevertheless, from the beginning of the
> embryonic period he is of the species of man – that is to say,
> an embryo of a man and not an animal ... As man in the
> womb of the mother passes from form to form, shape to
> shape, changes and develops, and is still the human species
> from the beginning of the embryonic period – in the same
> way man, from the beginning of his existence in the matrix of

the world, is also a distinct species – that is, man – and has
> gradually evolved from one form to another ... Man from the
> beginning was in this perfect form and composition, and
> possessed capacity and aptitudes for acquiring material and
> spiritual perfections, and was the manifestation of the words
> ‘We will make man in Our image and likeness.’13

Brown emphasises that ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s response to
Darwinism was not a technical scientific refutation as such. Rather,
he focused on its philosophical and religious implications for
human society. In particular, He condemned the application of the
principle of the ‘struggle for survival’ to human affairs as a
grievous error.

Von Kitzing, in dealing with ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s statements on
evolution, emphasises that the origin of the universe was complex
from the beginning, and included the potential for man’s
intelligence to emerge. Evolution is the unfolding in time and
place of this pre-existing order, not continual random self-creation
of new characteristics. The world is a hierarchy of increasing
complexity – mineral, vegetable, animal, human – with each level
including all lower but no higher levels.

Evolution applies to all levels of organisation, from the atom
up. A particular composition of elements, together with suitable
environmental conditions, always leads to the emergence of man
in the universe due to time-invariant laws.

Von Kitzing, and indeed the existing translation of ‘Abdu’l-
Bahá’s statements, could be clearer that the human spirit is not so
much the by-product or consequence of a particular composition
of atoms, but is associated with it in the physical world. It comes
from a pre-existent spiritual realm and appears on earth and is
individualised when a particular complexity in atomic
composition is obtained. He quotes from Bahá’u’lláh, Who affirms
an ever-changing existence sustained by the Word of God, with
physical nature an expression of God’s Will:

> That which hath been in existence had existed before, but not
> in the form thou seest today ... Verily, the Word of God is the
> Cause which hath preceded the contingent world – a world
> which is adorned with the splendours of the Ancient of

Days, yet is being renewed and regenerated at all times ...

> Say: Nature in its essence is the embodiment of My Name,
> the Maker, the Creator. Its manifestations are diversified by
> varying causes, and in this diversity there are signs for men
> of discernment. Nature is God’s Will and is its expression in
> and through the contingent world. It is a dispensation of
> Providence ordained by the Ordainer, the All-Wise.14

Parallel Evolution?
Von Kitzing poses the question as to how literally we should
understand ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s analogy between evolutionary
phylogeny (the human biological form) and embryonic ontogeny
in the human species. Is it a philosophical statement about the
nature of the universe, or does it mean that the evolving human
form was biologically human all the way down? ‘Abdu’l-Bahá has
stated that even if the human biological body was different in the
past, it was still the unchanged human species. But what does He
mean by ‘human species’? Is it the Platonic species essence or a
physical form? Could the human species essence contain not only
the ideal picture of the species, but different possible evolutionary
pathways towards perfection?

A literal interpretation of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s statements results
in a model of parallel evolution where a biologically distinct line of
each species has existed from the beginning of the earth and each
species develops in parallel or independently from each other. But
‘the assumption of parallel evolution produces more problems
than it solves’ (p. 234) and is not accepted by scientists as a serious
theory. Von Kitzing accepts that other Bahá’í writers understand
‘Abdu’l-Bahá to propose a biologically distinct evolution of the
human species parallel to the animal kingdom. However, he
suggests that His teachings on the subject have been widely
misunderstood because of misinterpretations of His meaning of
the term ‘human species.’

For parallel evolution to be regarded as credible by today’s
science, a number of issues would have to be resolved. When did
the vegetable, animal and human species branch from their
common roots? A biological definition of species compatible with
current scientific knowledge must be developed. If genetic DNA
similarities among humans reflect biological relationships, why do

similar DNA sequences in different species, especially in the
higher primates and humans, not imply biological relationships
between them?

Von Kitzing argues that by the term ‘human species’,
‘Abdu’l-Bahá means the eternal species essence of man as a perfect
mirror reflecting all of the attributes of God, as a universal law
pre-defining humanity, not a particular biological species. ‘Abdu’l-
Bahá’s statement above that ‘a Perfect Manifestation always
exists’15 seems to support this. Hence the evolution of the
biological form of the human species on this earth is secondary. He
accepts the conventional view that Homo sapiens and the modern
higher primates have a common ancestor but that they branched
off at least ten million years ago. But this view seems to contradict
‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s statements that man existed from the beginning of
the Earth and that a particular, perfect composition of elements is
required for the human spirit and intelligence to be made manifest
in the physical world. It seems to this reviewer that Von Kitzing
does not resolve this issue. To be fair, he is clear that his article
does not aim to do this. At the start of the Twenty-first Century, it
may simply be too soon to achieve a detailed technical synthesis
between the Bahá’í view and modern science. Perhaps, as Friberg
wrote,

> It is wrong, therefore, to view man as originating from the
> animals. However, it would not be wrong to say that man
> appeared from the animals, as long as the place of appearance
> is not confused with the reality of that which has appeared.16

Von Kitzing quotes Shoghi Effendi, who affirmed that man,
irrespective of his physical form, was always man, on the basis
that no form or species can exceed its own potentialities and
evolve into something else. These statements seem to leave open
the exact biological mechanisms of man’s evolution:

> The Bahá’í faith teaches man was always potentially man,
> even when passing through the lower stages of evolution.17
> We cannot prove that man was always man for this is a
> fundamental doctrine, but it is based on the assertion that
> nothing can exceed its own potentialities, that everything, a

stone, a tree, an animal and a human being, existed in plan,
> potentially, from the very ‘beginning’ of creation. We don’t
> believe man has always had the form of a man, but rather
> that from the outset he was going to evolve into the human
> form and species and not be a haphazard branch of the ape
> family.18

Some Criticisms of Book
Notwithstanding its subtitle, the book focuses perhaps too
narrowly in relating the topic of evolution to philosophical
thought from the ancient Greeks to the Nineteehth-Century Arabs
and to ‘Abdu’l-Bahá. It does not cover what the Old Testament
(particularly Genesis, chapter 1), the Qur’án, and other Scriptures
and philosophies say about creation and evolution. It would
benefit from expounding on what today’s mainstream Christian
churches, and the ‘scientific creationism’ of American
fundamentalist Christians, have to say on these issues. The
inclusion of the originally intended third article would enhance the
book by providing a broader perspective and treatment of the
topic.

The book does not resolve how the Bahá’í view of evolution
is compatible with the current scientific view of the biological
technicalities of the evolution of the human species. There is a
sense of an unsatisfactory incompleteness in this area, specifically
whether or not the Bahá’í view implies the parallel evolution of all
species and a separate biological form for man from his beginning
on Earth, a concept rejected by modern science. Differing possible
views of the meaning of the term ‘human species’ as used by
‘Abdu’l-Bahá are not resolved.

The ordering of the book’s contents could be better, perhaps
covering the scientific aspects before the philosophical aspects.
Brown’s essay could have started with the philosophical and
historical background to creation and evolution, rather than with
the response of Nineteenth-Century Muslims and ‘Abdu’l-Bahá to
Darwinism. Parts of his essay can be hard to grasp for the
layperson, especially some of the philosophical concepts in the
third section (pp. 51-76) about substance, form, accident and
becoming. The fact that the book consists of two separate essays
leads to some duplication, although the subtleties and difficulties

of the ideas and concepts may justify this. An overall conclusion
and synthesis would be beneficial.

One visible shortcoming is that there is no index, despite
comprehensive endnotes and a bibliography, although the detailed
contents section at the start compensates partly for this. Nor is
there any biographical information about the authors.

Other Possible Applications of Book’s Approach
The approach used in the book could be applied equally to writing
a Bahá’í response to the Big Bang theory of the origin and
development of the universe that has, since the 1960s, become the
dominant theory of cosmology. From observing today’s expanding
universe, it projects backwards to its origin some 15,000,000,000
years ago when all the matter and energy of the universe was
compressed in an extremely small space of infinite density, a
‘singularity.’ This exploded and began to expand, leading by a
long process, and through the power of gravity, to the formation of
stars and galaxies and planets; and then through random
mutations and natural selection, to the evolution of life and human
beings, where conditions are suitable. The current prevailing view
is that the universe will continue to expand until it reaches a final
‘heat death’ and grinds to a halt. This appears to conflict with the
very emphatic Bahá’í view that the universe is eternal and infinite.

A philosophical approach would reject such sweeping
speculative claims. It might maintain that the Big Bang was not
‘the beginning’, but merely the earliest time for which scientific
evidence is available. Perhaps, as some scientists have suggested,
the Big Bang was just a local phenomenon, or the exiting matter-
energy from the black hole or contraction of a previous universe or
of another part of the universe. Our universe may be just one small
part of a much greater one, or one of many universes. It may be the
beginning of just another cycle of expansion in an eternal cyclically
oscillating universe. This would appear to agree with the
fundamental principle of the cyclical nature of existence and life as
explained by ‘Abdu’l-Bahá: ‘ ... in the whole universe, whether for
the heavens or for men, there are cycles of great events, of
important facts and occurrences. When a cycle is ended, a new
cycle begins.’19

On more specific issues, what are we to make of
Bahá’u’lláh’s statement that ‘every fixed star hath its own planets
and every planet its own creatures whose number no man can
compute’,20 in light of the current scientific view that life, as on
Earth, does not exist in the rest of our solar system? How do we
interpret the references in His Writings, confirmed by ‘Abdu’l-
Bahá, to a future transmutation of elements by way of a hidden
science or knowledge, which to modern science might appear to
refer to alchemy, now regarded as a discredited occult subject?
What about the paradigm of medicine and healing in the Bahá’í
Writings, which appears much closer to traditional or ‘alternative’
medicine than to today’s orthodox ‘scientific’ medicine?

Conclusion
The development of biology since Darwin has undermined
religious values by denying divine creation and a goal or purpose
for evolution and life, and insisting that random genetic variations
in species, selected by the environment according to survival
criteria, can alone explain the evolution and diversity of life,
including man. It regards the mechanisms of evolution – random
mutations and natural selection – as sufficient to explain the cause
and origin of life itself. It cannot explain the origin of complex
order and so merely assumes it. Yet random mutations and
selection by an ever-changing environment do not preclude the
movement of evolution towards a goal, under the guiding force of
divinely created species essences working through genetic
information as a means to regulate the development of organisms.

Evolution, based on chance and without purpose, has
become an all-embracing doctrine in the dominant Western
civilization of today, imprisoning its culture in an apparently
irreconcilable conflict between religion and science. Its
philosophical implications taken to an extreme, especially the
‘struggle for survival’, have had disastrous consequences in
ideologies like Nazism and Communism, and in extreme variants
of nationalism and free-market competitive capitalism. The
mainstream Christian churches, including the Roman Catholic
Church, have accommodated themselves to the current prevailing
scientific orthodoxy, while insisting on God as the Ultimate Cause
of creation and on man’s spiritual nature and destiny. However, in

the United States in particular, many Christian Churches have
stuck to the literal biblical account of creation, and the creation
versus evolution debate has become a major cultural and political
issue. The construction of a new paradigm of evolution, with a
true reconciliation of its scientific and religious dimensions, has
still to be achieved.

The Bahá’í Faith does not merely believe in evolution as one
among many beliefs. Rather, its fundamental outlook is inherently
evolutionary. It regards motion and evolution as the essence of
creation and life. It affirms that evolution has a divine purpose,
and is the unfolding in time and place of that purpose and of the
eternal signs and attributes of God, not continual random self-
creation. Its central theological belief is that Divine Revelation is a
continuous and progressive process, and Bahá’u’lláh states that
‘All men have been created to carry forward an ever-advancing
civilization.’21 Von Kitzing is surely correct when he states that ‘the
complexity of the final goal of evolution may simply surpass the
imagination of all evolving civilizations’ (p. 210).

This book is an impressive and weighty contribution to the
evolution debate, although it does not set out a detailed technical
solution to the issues raised. It provides a framework for relating
the teachings of religion and theology to the deepest scientific and
philosophical issues facing today’s world. It succeeds in its claim
that ‘it offers an ambitious model for the application of the
principle of the unity of science and religion’ (back cover). The
book highlights the importance of a metaphysical and
philosophical underpinning to science. Hence it should hold its
own among any books, academic or otherwise, published in the
area of the relationship between religion and science.
