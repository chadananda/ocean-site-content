                   THE IDENTITY OF THE SABI’UN:

AN HISTORICAL QUEST
One of the mysterious and unsolved Qur’anic problems surrounds the identity
of the Sabians, al-sribi’zin.As Jane McAuliffe has shown in her study published
in an earlier volume of this journal,’ Muslim exegetes reflect uncertainty on this
point from the very start. Over time the term so diversified in meaning that it
became even more difficult to determine to whom it referred. Yet one would
assume that in the Qur%n uZ-.@bi’rlndenotes a specific historical community.
Placed alongside Jews, Christians, and “the Believers” (Muslims)-in S. 2:62, one
is tempted to regard the Sabians as a fourth monotheistic community. This
association is all the more inviting when once again, in S. 569, the same four
religions are distinguished following an address to the “possessors of scripture”
several verses earlier. This sense of parallelism would appear in S. 22:17 t o
extend to the Mujk-who are called into question by the obtrusion into the
context of “those who associate” (gods with God). Whatever the solution, these
groups constitute a significant internal witness to the religious demography, so to
speak, within the Qur’anic universe.

To make sense of the demographic puzzle in which the Sabians figure as the
least familiar piece, a fresh methodological “angle” is suggested by the
inconclusive data obtained from the study of Muslim commentators. Their
indecisive witness is itself a problem which may need to be explained in other
ways than simply as resulting from educated speculation. Complementary to
McAuliffe’s illustrative exegetical survey, the present study employs, therefore,
an historical methodology which enables us to place history alongside tradition.
A comparison will be drawn between the prominent religious communities Islam
encountered during its first two centuries of expansion and the groups identified
as scibi’zin by Arabic and Persian authorities, primarily of the tenth century.
Moreover, data gleaned from pre-Islamic sources will offer an independent
witness, especially crucial for determining who the Qur’anic Sabians originally
were.

Waardenburg provides a fairly sequential list of religious communities
encountered in the course of conquests outside Arabia during the seventh and
eighth centuries A.D.:

> 1) Mazdaeans in Mesopotamia, Iran and Transoxania
2) Christians of different persuasions:

> -Nestorians in Mesopotamia and Iran
> -Monophysites in greater Syria, Egypt, and Armenia
> -Orthodox Melkites in greater Syria
> -Orthodox Latins in North Africa
> -Arians in Spain
3) Jews in Mesopotamia and Iran, greater Syria, and Egypt

> 4) Samaritans in Palestine
> 5 ) Mandaeans in south Mesopotamia
> 6) Harranians in north Mesopotamia
> 7) Manichaeans in Mesopotamia and Egypt
> 8) Buddhists and Hindus in Sind
> 9) Followers of tribal religions in east Africa.’

Excluded from Waardenburg’s list are the Sabaeans of the spice-exporting
kingdom of Saba’ which flourished in the mountain altitudes in South Arabia,
whose rich legendary history finds expression in the “Queen of Sheba” and
Solomon narrative of the Qur’gn. They should not be confused with the
distinctly different Sabians. The first in fact to be called a ?rib? was the Prophet
Muhammad. In the earliest extant biography of the Prophet he is referred to as
“This Sabi’ who destroyed the authority of Q ~ r a y s h , ”and

~ the Prophet’s followers
. ~ b. Wahb’s conversion is described as Taba’a, in a
are referred to as s ~ b i t‘Umar
context which scarcely requires the meaning “bapti~ed.”~The interesting
occurrence in the Qur’an of the related word Tibgha (S. 2:138) heightens the
ambivalence of what has often been rendered as “baptism.’* Subi: however
disputed its etymology, came to serve as one of several designations for
“proselyte” (hanif/pibi/m~hijir/ansir).~     This initial past-Qur‘anic association
with the Sabians prompted Ibn al-Nadim, to whom we will refer later? to speak
in his Kitab al-Fihrist of the monotheistic hansfs as “the Ibrahimitic Sabians.”

The hypothesis we want to test in this article is that the tenth-century
identifications of the Tabitin which will be considered here reflect the first wave

In his 1972 study on the Harranian Sabians Hjarpe discussed various theories regarding their
identity and devoted separate appendices to the etymology of the word qubi’zin and the relationship
between the terms Sabi’and bani/; Jan Hjarpe, Analyse critique des traditions arabes sur les Subkens
Harraniens (Uppsala: Skriv Service AB, 1972), esp. pp. 1-34. He summarized the main theses of the

les textes plus comprkhensibles et est prkfkable a la these de Chwolsohn selon laquelle ‘sabken’

Mandaeans in south Mesopotamia. It should not surprise us that the literary
sources available to us are relatively late, since Islamic historiography was
essentially the extended memory of oral tradition for around a century and a
half. With this in mind we should face with greater openness the value as well as
the limitations of the often-contradictory tradition and be careful not to assume
that disparate data are necessarily meaningless. In the case of the Sabians, an
interpretation which accounts for diverse identifications woiild show the validity
of data which otherwise would simply be dismissed as contradictory and
therefore wrong.

From the end of the tenth century dates an important reference to the Sabians,
from no one less than al-Birimi (d. 1048), who writes that the name applies to

> they found it inconvenient to return to Syria; therefore they preferred to

> consequence of which they listened to the doctrines of the Magians, and
> inclined towards some of them. So their religion became a mixture of

> Genealogically they trace themselves back to Enos, the son of Seth, the son

Elsewhere in his erudite Chronology of Ancient Nations the Persian savant states
in a similar passage that "the real Sabians differ from the Harriinians, blaming
their doctrines and not agreeing with them except in a few matters. In praying,
even, they turn towards the north pole, whilst the Harriinians turn towards the
south pole."ll While al-Birfini does not designate them by any other name than
the general category Sabians, the religion described here is clearly that of the

Professor H . Kassis informed me that the Syrian scholar Sayyid 'Abd al-RazzHq al-Husayni of
Sayda has sought to demonstrate that at one juncture the Mazdaeans or Zoroastrians (the first group
on Waardenburg's list) were identified as Sabians, but I have been unable thus far to obtain this
study. See below, at note 16.

Subba or Sabba, the more formal self-designation being the Mandai or
Mandaeans.12

These so-called “Christians of St. John” did (and still do) face the Polar Star
as their qibla-the North is the source of light, enlightenment, and healing. This
is a heritage from the Babylonians, distinct from both the Zoroastrians and the
Harranians, who would turn south. A further point of agreement with al-Birbni’s
account regards the tradition of the “founder” of the religion, since Mandaean
priestsI7 count Anush or “Enoch” as the first priest. The final point of accord
touches on origins. In the second passage referred to above, at-Birbni reports of
the Sabians: “For the Sabians are the remnant of the Jewish tribes who remained
in Babylonia, when the other tribes left it for Jerusalem in the days of Cyrus
and Artaxerxes. Those remaining tribes felt themselves attracted to the rites of
the Magians, and so they inclined (were inclined, i.e. jabi) towards the religion
of Nebukadnezzar, and adopted a system mixed up of Magism and Judaism like
that of the Samaritans in Syria.”I4 In the Mandaean legend of “Nebuchadnezzar’s
Daughter” we find a similar report of their origins:

> Some of the Jews fled until they reached Babylon. The King Nebuchadnezzar
> (BukhtanajSar)said to the rabbis and cohens, “Why did you thus? Why did
> you kill these people of your own blood without right?” . . . They said,
> “The Nasurai have a secret doctrine, and that was the reason.” The king
> replied, “I myself, and my following, we will go also and become of their
> company.” He and his wise men left the Kingdom and went to the
> Mountain of the Mandai . . . and . . . were made Mandai.Is
> Al-Birbni’s assertion that Sabian doctrine and praxis partly derived from a
Magian heritage seems to establish some association of the @bi’Cm with the
community mentioned as the first one on Waardenburg’s list.I6 But the main
point of interest is undoubtedly the distinction he makes between various groups
somehow falling under the general category of $ibi’un and the identification of
the Mandaeans as the real Sabians.

Harranians in north Mesoporamia. The Harrinians referred to above were the
ancient Carrhae, a pagan sect in H a r d n influenced by Helleni~rn.’~ Al-Biriini
refers to them immediately following his discussion of “the real Sabians.”

A survey of their feasts follows after which al-Biruni expresses the hope that
contacts with the Hardnians themselves will enable him “to distinguish between
what is peculiar to the Sabians, the Harrgnians, and the ancient magi an^."'^

The twelfth-century Persian scholar al-SharastAni was in a. position to learn
more about these Sabians. In his Book of Religions and Philosophical Sects we
are told that the largest, most influential sect of Hardnians were called a@b
al-rtihdniyycit, or “proponents of spiritual beings.” According to the author, the
ruwniyyfit served as intermediaries through whom the Wise and Productive
Creator ought to be sought.2O By purifying one’s soul, and controlling one’s
passions, one could enter into a communion with the spirits, who direct the force
of the divine power towards the lower beings. At times the Sabians called the
plant fathers and the elements mothers. One could see why Caliph al-Ma’mb
thought of destroying these ustar-worshippers,”zl but their intellectual prowess
won them toleration. The Sabian Abti Ishaq b. Hikl, secretary under Caliphs
al-Mup’ and al-Tsl‘i‘, succeeded in securing a n edict of toleration in favor of his
coreligionists of Harrfin around the year 364/ 975.2*

Manichaeans in Samarqand. Manichaeans within the Muslim empire were, for
the most part, stigmatized as Zindiqs (from the Persian zandiq, “follower of
Zand”) and thus subjected to persecution. The only exception was the
community of Manichaeans who were known as (presumably lawful) Sabians.
Ibn al-Nadim informs us that when Manichaeans sought refuge in Samarqand to
escape persecutions in the tenth century, the ruler of Khurassln wished to put
them all to death. Reprieval came as an unexpected fortune when the
Manichaean king of the Uighurs nearby at QoZo threatened to kill all Muslims
within his kingdom if any harm should befall the Manichaeans in Samarqand.23
On the authority of al-Biruni we are told:

2o That is, the largest, most influential sect of Harranians. See B. Lawrence, “Shahrastani on
Indian Idol Worship,” Stisf, XXXVIII (1973), 66. For the in this connection most important
passages in al-Shahrastani see below note 31.

21 When in A.D. 830 al-Ma’mirn encountered the people of HarrHn, an official of the victor
enquired: “Who are you?“ The folk of Harrsn replied, “Hardnians.” “Christians or Jews?“ “Neither,”
was the answer. The conqueror demanded, “Have you any holy books or a prophet?“ To this the
HarrHnians gave a guarded and confusing response. Whereupon the official observed, “You must be
Zindiqs (zanldiqa).” From that time onward, the Harranians adopted and kept the name sbi’fin.

Buddhists and Hindus in Sind. For all of al-BirDnT’s knowledge of
Brahmanism, it is remarkable how little he knew of Buddhism.25 Nevertheless, he
is our main authority for the extension of the term Sabian to include the Buddha
and his followers. Al-BirDni placed the Buddha in the class of “pseudo-prophets”
who deluded their communities: “The first mentioned is BGdh6saf; who came
forward in India after the 1st year of TahmGrath. He introduced the Persian
writing and called people to the religion of the Siibians. Whereupon many people
followed him.”ZbIt seems likely that al-Birijni was acquainted with the history of
the Buddha through the Arabic romance Kitcb Bilawhar wu Ytidisaf(Biidh2saf).
Not a direct translation of any single Indian Buddhist work, the Arabic
legendary life of the Buddha is a syncretic compilation of episodes found in the
Buddha-carita. the Mahdvastu, the Lalita-vistara, and the Jataka Tales.2’ Right
after al-BirDni tells of the BBdhiisaf, he mentions Balkh. This is an association
which may not have been accidential, for Balkh (along with Sogdiana and
Ferghana) had a strong Buddhist minority. Indeed, the ruins of the Buddhist
period in Balkh, associated with names from the Persian saga-cycles ( Takht-i-
Rustam, etc.) are better preserved than the Muslim ruins.** Apparently,
extension of the term Sabians to include Buddhists was not peculiar to al-BirDni,
but was a practice among other Islamic writers as well.29

AI-Shahrastiini was apparently the first author to apply the designation
Sabians to various religious groups in India, using it to classify them according
to degrees of idolatry.)O In the earlier mentioned section of his Kitub al-milal wa
7-nihal he discussed how the Sabians traced their teachings back to Adhimiin
(Agathodaimon; Shith, Seth) and Hermes (Idris, Henoch),” and dealt with them
mainly under the three categories of aShdb al-ruhdniyydt (referred to above),

Making use of these same three categories in his final chapter, “Ad’ al-Hind,” he
could find a place for eleven Indian religious groups under one of these headings
(excluding only the Badhima and the Indian philosophers), moving from the
most spiritual among them, especially the followers of Visnu and Siva, via the
star worshippers to those who worship idols which their own hands have made?3

Followers of tribal religions in East Africa. During Islam’s expansion in its
first two centuries it also encountered tribal religions in Africa. The process
which led to the eventual identification of African aboriginal religions with
Sabianism involved an intermediate association, one which was struck by the
tenthcentury author Abu ’1-Hasan ‘Ali Mas‘udi. In his Tanbih Mascadi asserts
that the Egyptians were ancient Sabians, who honored as their prophets Hermes
and Agathodaimon, the names occurring in the above mentioned account of
al-Shahrasani. These “Sabians of the Egyptians” were in fact the forebears of
the “Sabians of the HarrSLnian~.’’~~ He viewed the Buddha as an ancient Sabian
prophet of considerable influence in a n t i q ~ i t y , ’and

~ regarded the ancient
religions of China, Persia, Egypt, Greece and Rome as vestiges of the Sribi’type
of religion.36It was natural in the course of time for Muslim authors to extend
the application of the term Sabian to cover not only communities from a far
distant past, but also contemporary communities with which they themselves
came in contact, including some in Africa.37 Clearly, the term Sabian had by
now proved to be the most meaningful and attractive nomenclature for
comprehending foreign religiosities within what could still be considered a
Qur’anic world view.

While we have discussed thus far the application of the term Fabi’M to groups
outside the Jewish and Christian communities, we move, finally, to a category of
Sabianism to which tenth-century Muslim authors as well as Christian sources
make reference:

community situated in a swampy region traversed by the Euphrates in its lower
course. These people were known locally to the Arabs as al-mughtasila, or “those
who wash themselves.” The author of the Filzrist, Ibn al-Nadim, accordingly
calls them sabi’at al-bafd’ih,“Sabians of the Marshes.”

> belong to the male principle, whilst the mistletoe belong to the female, the
> trees being its roots. They have some detestable axioms that can only be
> called nonsense. [Dodge: “They have seven sayings, taking the form of
> fables.”] He [al-Hasih] had a disciple named Sham‘fin. They (the
> Mughtasila) agreed with the Manichaeans with regard to two principles,
> but otherwise their religions differ. Among them are some who worship the
> stars up to the present day.

And they embraced the creed that Futtaq was ordered to adopt.3s

Chwolsohn read the founder’s name as “al-Hassayh”39 rather than as “al-
Hasih,” but in either case any doubt as to the relationship between Elchasai and
the Mughtasila had to be abandoned after the discovery in 1969 of an original
Manichaean manuscript, the Kolner Codex.40 This Greek parchment codex
(dated fifth century A D . on paleographic grounds), from the papyrus collection
of the University of Cologne, is the smallest known manuscript from antiquity!’

Probably from a grave in Oxyrhynchus, Egypt, the parchment had evidently
served as an amulet. The text was rendered into Greek from a Syriac original,
and bears the title On the origin of his body-where “body” (somatos) should be
taken in the ecclesiological sense of St. Paul’s s6ma ChristoG.42 This “history” of
Mgni’s Church is not only of unquestioned43 importance for our knowledge of
Manichaean origins, but also for our recovery of the Mughtasila, the “Sabians of
the Marshes.”

The Cologne Mgni Codex (CMC) provides the following details regarding
those “baptizers” among whom Mgni had lived and from whom he later broke
away. Located in the Sasanid province of Meskne in southern Mesopotamia (the
MesEnelMaisan region was a t the embouchure of the Euphrates), Mani’s
baptists dwelled communally in isolated villages. Agriculture was the major
source of livelihood, along with related kinds of physical labor. The CMC
consists of “1”-narratives of Mgni, prefaced by formulae which are not only
introductory, but which are ascribed to particular (and elsewhere-attested)
Manichaean authorities as we11.44 These memoiresque literary sources are judged
to have a high degree of historicity, although clearly hagiographic in nature.45 In
the CMC, Mgni tells us: “I was reared and brought up in this sect of baptists, and
to its leaders and presbyters I was related through the upbringing of my body.’‘6
“If you accuse me concerning baptism, see, again 1 show you from your Law and
from what had been: revealed to your leaders that it is not necessary to baptize
oneself. For this is shown by Alchasaios the founder of your Law.”47

The co-editor of the critical edition of the CMC, A. Henrichs, suggested eight
major points of congruence between Mgni’s Elchasaites and the Elchasaites of
other ancient reports, and also singled out elements in common with related
baptist sects of Jewish-Christian origin.

1. Orientation toward sacramental piety. All baptist sects related external
purifications to salvation. Observance of sacramental baptisms along with other
ritual laws had both salvific and communal value. Such purifications renewed
the spirit and though distinct from the Mosaic law they were in a sense a
continuation of it. This explains why the CMC baptists could refer to their
religion as ‘‘our law and that of the fathers in which we have been living since
olden times.”

2. Keeping of the Sabbath. Ancient sources inform us that the followers of
> Elchasai were obligated to observe the Jewish Sabbath. Evidence that the CMC
> Elchasaites did likewise hinges on one passage in the codex, and its

place of origin for this papyrus document; Eg/. er Thhol., X (1979),182; A. Henrichs, “The Cologne
Mani Codex Reconsidered,” Hurvard Srudies in Classicul Philology, LXXXlll (1979).For further
studies see the introduction in Cameron-Dewey, note 46 below (p. 6).

interpretation. The CMC MBni epitomizes the religion of the baptists as “the
doctrines of those who are used to reading about purity, castigation of the flesh
and the keeping of the resting of the hands.” Mandaic texts, in explicitly anti-
Jewish and anti-Christian passages, confirm the interpretation of “the resting of
the hands” as Sabbath observances.

3. Baptismslablutions through immersion in running water. The Elchasaites
are attacked by Mani in severe criticisms which strike at the very heart of baptist
life. Mani criticizes the daily baths. Such lustrations were comparable to those
performed by the Hemero-baptists as well as by Ebionite Christians. From
Miini’s arguments we can infer that the CMC Elchasaites also practiced
initiation by special sacramental baptism, again not unlike the Ebionites.

4. Celebration of the Eurcharist with unleavened bread and water. Quoting
scriptural passages from Tatian’s Diatessaron, MBni takes to task the baptist
practice of regulated preparation of bread for ritual purposes. Since Mani in the
CMC appeals to the Lord’s supper as contradistinct to what was held by the
Elchasaites, Henrichs infers that their celebration of the Eucharist was like that
of the Ebionites, who partook of unleavened bread and pure water.

5 . Baptists’ rejection of portions of Scripture, including all writings of Paul.

The CMC portrays only a single instance where the baptists drew from scripture.
The occasion was an altercation with Mgni. Exactly which texts were invoked is
uncertain. Henrichs argues that when challenged by Miini on New Testament
grounds, the baptists would in all likelihood have repudiated the authority of
MBni’s proof-texts, especially those marshalled from St. Paul. Charging that
parts of scripture were interpolations was, of course, an issue in Jewish-Christian
polemic, Henrichs points out. The baptists in any event suspect Miini of “going
to the Greeks” or “to the Gentiles” apparently referring to his appeal to St. Paul;
the wording that the latter was a “Greek” was a term of abuse in some Jewish-
Christian polemics.

6. Encratism. The baptists of the Cologne Codex were confirmed vegetarians,
as has been reported of the Ebionites. Henrichs speculates that baptist asceticism
extended to continence in the CMC (on the basis of Ibn al-Nadim’s report),
although he is aware that Elchasai encouraged marriage and that continence as
an ideal was foreign to all other Judaic baptist groups. To account for Miini’s
total abhorrence towards sexuality, Henrichs expects that, like Jesephus’
Essenes, Msni must have grown up in all-male environment.

7. The doctrine of the “True Prophet.”Not everything that was baptist was
> rejected by MBni, and the most striking instance of this perhaps is to be found in
MSni’s prophetology, where there is some ideological carry over. Henrichs states:

> The Pseudo-Clementines and Elchasai coincide in that they propagate the
> cyclic incarnation of the True Prophet. For Elchasai, however, the series of
> incarnations did not culminate in Christ, but included Elchasai and
> continued even beyond him. The Cologne Codex has a clear reference to
> this doctrine. Some of the baptists were so impressed by Mgni’s
> performance as a theologian that they regarded him as the True Prophet
> and the incarnation of the Living Logos (CMC 86, 1-9). This doctrine,
> which lies at the root of Mfini’s own conception of his apostleship as thc

> concluding stage in a series of incarnations, forms, in combination with the
> docetism of Marcion and Bardaisan, the basis of MSni’s christology.
8. Eschatological belief in the resurrection of the body. All the CMC baptists
referred to the future resurrection of the body as the “resting of the garment,” we
are told. Such doctrine was widespread, though not universal, in various forms
of Judaism and Jewish Christianity.48

Henrichs considers these parallels between the new data of the CMC and
ancient reports on the Elchasaites to be “overwhelming”: “Henceforth, the fact
that M3ni grew up with, and was influenced by, Jewish-Christian baptists must
be reckoned with.”49 The tentatively suggested identification of the Sabians of
the Marshes, the baptists in the CMC and the Elchasaites now needs further
consideration.

Sabians of the Marshes-CMC baptists-Ekhasaites

The Fihrist evidently equates the Mughtasila Sabians of the Marshes with
Elchasaites, and the CMC equates MBni’s baptists with Elchasaites; but does any
pre-Islamic source equate Elchasaites with Sabians, thus furnishing a third
independent attestation to the validity of the equation?

A rare occurrence of what appears to be a form of the term “Sabian” in
Christian sources prior to lslarn is found in Hippolytus of Rome who, writing in
A.D. 225, voiced this warning:

> What was the recent arrival of the strange demon Elchasai and that he used
> as a concealment of his particular errors his apparent adhesion to the Law
> but in reality he devotes himself to the ideas of the Gnostics, or even those
> of astrologers and magicians. . . . When his doctrine had been spread about
> throughout the entire world, a cunning man and full of desperation, one
> called Alcibiades, living in Apamea, a city of Syria, examined carefully into
> his business. And considering himself a more formidable character more
> ingenious in tricks than Callistus, he went to Rome. He brought with him
> some book alleging that a certain righteous man, Elchasai, had received
> this from the Seres of Parthia. And that he gave it to one called Sobiai. . .

The word “Sobiai” bears resemblance to both Arabic and Mandaic terms for
Sabians, and Macuch’s observation in his Handbook of Classical and Modern
Mandaic sufficiently illustrates the probability of a Sobiai f Fbbi’a association:

> Observation of actual pronunciation corrected my view concerning this
> Glossary in many points. The frequent confusion of the emphatic s with the
> non-emphatic s does not go back-as Noldeke thought-to the similarity
of the Mandaic s to the Arabic +, but is . . . based on actual pronunciation

.
. . . The Mandaeans themselves confuse the emphatics with their non-

> emphatic counterparts. The letters which my Mandaean friends write to me
> are full of such confusions. They would often write even the word Subia
> (Ar. subbi) with s . ~ ]
Lady Drower, who studied the Mandaeans for many years in her field work, is
of the opinion that the term Subba or Sabbu is a colloquial form by which the
Mandaeans refer to their principal culf, immersion, the more formal name of
their religion and people being Mundui.52 The question arises whether Sobiai
could be a reference to a sect rather than to a particular person. The probability
that this is the case is strongly suggested by Klijn and Reinink who in their study
of Hippolytus reached the conclusion: “We presume that Sobiai is not the name
of a person, as Hippolytus suggests, but that of a group using this name to
express the emphasis they laid on the importance of purification through
baptism.”53 It is corroborative that the Cologne Mgni Cpdex gives the proper
name for the baptist Elchasaites it describes as Subbuios ’0 BaptistE~!~~

The relationship between the groups referred to in the reports of Ibn al-
Nadim, CMC and Hippolytus can ultimately only be determined by a study of
their teachings. The historical integrity of each of these reports seems to US a

The discrepancies can easily be accounted for if one takes these distinct
approaches seriously, for, as Stone once remarked, “the rush to compare the
heresiologists’ report to the insiders’ self-description is useless. The two will never
be the same.’’s6

Klijn and Reinink concede that Ibn al-Nadim gives us a rather one-sided
picture of Mughtasilan practices. This is obviously due to the nature of the
description itself. We think, e.g., of the instruction given to FBtiq in the heathen
temple: “0Fgtiq, d o not eat meat! Do not drink wine! Do not marry any human
being!’’S7 and the injunctions for entrance into Manj’s own cult and community,
recorded several pages later: “He who would enter the cult must examine his

Chwolsohn, too, understood Sabiai as the personification of a sect, and discussed at some length the
issue of the identification of the Mughtasila-Sobiai-Sabians-Elchasaites(see below)-Mandaeans; Die
Ssabier, esp. I, 109ff. (121 on the identification Sobiai and Sabians).

” Drower, The Mandaeans of Iran and Iraq, p. 1 .

’’  Patristic Evidence, p. 5 5 . Also of interest is the possibility that the Sera whom Hippolytus
associates with the Elchasaites may have been a community with baptist tendencies. The description
which the Pseudo-Clementine Recognitions gives of the Seres reflects at least a lack of sacrifices, and
baptismal and sacrificial cults were usually antithetical to each other. Recognitions, 8:48; 9: 19. The

The link between the Elchasaite Mughtasila and the pre-Manichaean
Elchasaite baptists throws fresh light upon an early kind of Sabianism. That the
details d o not fully tally with those of the Elchasaites of Hippolytus’ description
is not a negation of the new-found evidence. The Elchasaite connection of
MHni’s Babylonian baptists, as Henrichs suggests, may well be secondary and
superimposed on an original Palestinian substratum, through the adoption of
Elchasai’s book of revelation.”’

As far as the identification of the Qur‘anic Sabi’tm are concerned, we are faced
with one final issue. Two rival claimants come to fore: Mandaeans and
Elchasaites.6’ The question of the relationship between these two baptist groups

6 1 Giitje, for example, declares with regard to the qubi’lin: “In the Qur’an itself the Mandaeans are
no doubt intended”, Qur’cin, p. 265. C. de Vaux, on the other hand, states that the Sabians “have
sometimes been identified with the Mandaeans or with the Elkasaites”; Shorter Ehc. of Islam, p. 477.

Foc the views of Maimonides on Sabianism, see L. Strauss’s introductory essay to S. Pines’s
translation of 7he Guidefor the Perplexed (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1963), pp. xxxiv
ff. and Chwolsohn, Die Ssabier, I, 689-716; 11,451-91. The Persian Prophet BaMullBh gives what
would constitute the Baha’i perspective. Bahg’ullah refers to ancient followers of John the Baptist
who kept separate from Christianity and “who are even now still on the earth and are known as the
@bi’tin”(tr. D. MacEoin from Asrcinr’l-Arha‘r, IV, 233; World Order, X (Winter 1975-76), 11; see
also MacEoin, World Order, X (Fall 1975), 3, where an almost identical passage from BahH’u’lbh is
given: “After the martyrdom of the son of Zachariah [John the Baptist], some of his followers did
not turn unto the divine Manifestation of Jesus, the Son of Mary, and removed themselves from the
Faith of God, and until this day they have continued to exist in the world, being known to some as
the SbPlin. These people consider themselves to be the community of John.         ..  “; Qdrntis-i-iqdn,11,
987\. The closest analogue to this historical perspective within the Christian tradition would appear to
be the following Ebionite Christian .reminiscence: “For the people was now divided into many
parties, ever since the days of John the Baptist. For when the rising of Christ was at hand for the
abolition of sacrifices, and for the bestowal of the grace of baptism, the enemy. . . wrought various
schisms among people. . . . Yea, some even of the disciples of John, who seemed to be p a t ones,
have separated from the people, and proclaimed their own master as the Christ”; Recognizions, 1,
5S54. In this connection, there is a remarkable report by Conti the Maronite (1650) who asserts that
a sect had migrated to Mergab in Lebanon from Galilee, around 150 years prior to his own time.

deserves renewed attention, and the following remarks of Henrichs seem very
important in this connection:

Mandaeans and MBni’s Elchasaitesb3 dwelled in the marsh lands and delta of the
lower Euphrates in southern Mesopotamia where they co-existed as two baptist
movements both known as Sabian communions. Were these Sabians also
within Arabia? Epiphanius reports that various Jewish-Christian sects, including
the Elchasaites (whom he calls also Sampsaeans) are found in Arabia: “The
Sampsaeans and the Elkasaites . . . still live in Arabia. . . . in everything they are

which considered John the Baptist as it founder. The priests wore turbans and garments of camel’s
wool. Sacraments consisted of locusts and wild honey. The sect held Jesus to be a mere prophet who
succeeded John. Days of assembly were Sunday and Thursday. The four annual feasts were the birth
of John the Baptist; the commemoration of his baptism; the lamentation for the beheading of John;
and a feast in honor of John’s victory over a dragon. This report, however, is not confirmed by any
ancient source. See Smith-Wace, A Dictionary of Chrisriun Biography (New York: AMS reprint,
1967), S.V. “Sabians,” p. 570.

For a critical evaluation of some IsmSili identifications of the Sabians-among others by the
tenth-century AbB Ya‘qBb al-SiJistHni,who held them to have been disciples of MHni, Bardesanes and
Marcion, and by his contemporary Abu HHtim al-Razi, who identified them as Christians inclined
toward Zoroastrianism-see S.M. Stern, Studies in &r/y Ismo‘ilirm (Jerusalem: The Hebrew
University, 1983). pp. 33-34.

~ ~ question of their identity and history certainly
deserves further research.

Our study has shown that the issue of the apparent confusion among Muslim
exegetes over the identity of the Sabians is resolved once the historical
circumstances are grasped. Exactly because it was imprecise, the word "&En
functioned as a term of great legal importance by contributing to an attitude of
toleration towards minority religions under Muslim rule. The term evolved from
a once-specific designation to a classification which, adapted to ever new
historical contexts, expanded its meaning to embrace peoples of otherwise
uncertain standing, giving them a place of security within a Qur'anically
sanctioned framework.

As far as the original QuIJanic Sribi'tin are concerned, special attention was
paid to the Cologne Mani Codex which confirms the assertion found in the
Fihrist that Sabians were Elchasaites, an identification which may also be
implied in Hippolytus. On the basis of evidence to date it seems justifiable to
reaffirm Chwolsohn's conclusion that the Qur'anic Sabians were persons known
for their emphasis on ritual purifications, predominantly Mandaeans and
Elcha~aites.6~
