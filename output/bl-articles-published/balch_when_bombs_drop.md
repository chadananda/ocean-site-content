On April 29, 1980, members of a small Baha'i sect1 entered fallout
shelters to await a thermonuclear war that would fulfill the pro-
phecies of Revelation. In exactly one hour they believed one-third
of mankind would perish in the holocaust. During the next 20
years they expected the world to be further ravaged by starvation
and disease, worldwide revolution, and natural disasters caused
by the Earth's shifting crust. Finally, in the year 2000, God's

138   SOCIOLOGICAL PERSPECTIVES / APRIL 1983

Kingdom would be established on Earth and a thousand years
of peace would ensue.

About one month before April 29 we began a participant-
observer study of this group. Although the project has become
an ongoing affair, our original intent was to replicate the classic
study by Festinger,Riecken, and Schachter (1956) of the reactions
to disconfirmed prophecy.Festingerand his colleagues infiltrated
a millennial flying saucer cult to test the hypothesis that discon-
firmation of the leader's prophecy would result in increased con-
viction and heightenedefforts to recruitnew believers.They argued
that members of apocalyptic groups experience severe cognitive
dissonance when their prophecies fail. If believers have made
strong commitments based on their faith, they cannot easily aban-
don their beliefs. Instead, their only recourse is to seek conso-
nant information, including the social support of fellow believers,
and that should entail increased efforts to persuade nonbelievers
to accept the faith.

Festinger et al. tested their hypothesis by observing the reac-
tions of a millennial cult (the Lake City group) when the expected
catastrophe failed to happen. The group's leader, a woman they
called Marian Keech, had received severalmessages from a space
being named Sananda warning her about a devastatingflood that
would inundate much of North America on a particulardate. Even
after her prophecy failed, the most committed members main-
tained their beliefs. Mrs. Keech claimed that the world had been
saved by their faith, and she pointed to earthquakesin other parts
of the globe to provethat disastrousupheavalshad reallyoccurred,
although not in the manner she expected. She also made several
more predictions in rapid succession, all disconfirmed, in what
appeared to be a desperate attempt to save face. Most important,
she and her followers began to proselyte almost immediately-a
finding that is especially remarkablein view of the fact that Mrs.
Keech had been relativelyunconcernedabout spreadingSananda's
messages prior to the disconfirmation.

However, a subsequent study of a millennial Christian sect
called the Church of the True Word failed to support the pros-
elyting hypothesis. Hardyck and Braden (1962) found that Church

Balch et al. / WHEN THE BOMBS DROP     139

members did not attempt to win new converts after an expected
nuclear attack failed to occur. Out of 135 believers who entered
fallout shelters, 103 remained underground for 42 days until Mrs.
Shepard, their prophet, told them to come out. Testimonies and
follow-up interviews indicated that they remained firm in their
beliefs. Members claimed that God had merely been testing their
faith and using them as an example to warn an apathetic world.
Mrs. Shepard's followers continued to believe that war was immi-
nent, but they made no efforts to proselyte after they emerged
from their shelters, even though they had numerous opportunities
to do so.

Consequently, the evidence concerning the urge to proselyte
after prophetic failure is contradictory. Hardyck and Braden sug-
gested that Festingeret al. failed to specify all the conditions under
which proselyting will occur. Here we attempt to build on their
conclusion by arguing that reactions to disconfirmed prophecy
depend on the social context in which disconfirmation is exper-
ienced. Because adaptation to prophetic failure is a collective
process (Zygmunt, 1972), any theory that neglects the role of inter-
actional variableswill have limited value in explaining how millen-
nial movements react when their prophecies fail.

DATA COLLECTION

Unfortunately, most accounts of millennial movements do not
provide much information about group dynamics at the moment
of disconfirmation. The best way to get this information is to
be on the scene when prophetic failure occurs, but outsiders rarely
have that opportunity. They must rely on after-the-factinterviews,
as Hardyck and Braden did, or historical records, which are often
unreliable or incomplete. Like Festinger et al., however, we were
lucky enough to witness firsthand the moment of truth.

We first heard about the apocalyptic sect known as the Baha'is
Under the Provisions of the Covenant (BUPC) about two months
before the impending cataclysm.2 The little-known sect based in
Missoula, Montana, was catapulted into the headlines when the

140   SOCIOLOGICAL PERSPECTIVES / APRIL 1983

local paper exposed a nuclear preparedness group as a BUPC
organization. Known as SAFE, standing for Shelter and Fall-Out
Education, the group has been organizedby the BUPC to upgrade
Missoula's fallout sheltersand educate Missoulians about nuclear
survival.

With the permission of the sect's leader, Dr. Leland Jensen
(known as "Doc" to his followers), we began participating in all
manner of BUPC activities. These included "feasts" held every
19 days according to the Baha'i calendar, "firesides" where the
BUPC teach the faith to "prospectivemembers,"and "deepenings"
intended to explore Baha'i writings in greater depth. In the hec-
tic days before April 29 we spent long hours collating pages for
Doc's latest manuscript (Jensen, 1980) and helping members
preparetheir fallout shelters.When the fateful day finally arrived,
we joined believers in three different underground shelters, and
we returnedon May 7 after Doc reset the date for the catastrophe.
During the next six months we interviewed41 of Doc's followers,
including believers in Wyoming, Colorado, and Arkansas. In
addition to these formal contacts, we have spent a considerable
amount of time with the BUPC in more casual settings.

A CLOSER LOOK AT THE
BAHA'IS UNDER THE PROVISIONS OF THE COVENENT

Any discussion of the BUPC must begin with Doc, the jovial
67-year-old chiropractor who predicted the cataclysm for April
29\. Once an internationally known Baha'i teacher, Doc was
expelled from Baha'i Faith in 1960 for aligning himself with a
schismatic leader named Mason Remey. Believing that a
catastrophic flood was about to inundate much of the United
States, Mason urged his followers to move to high ground in the
Rocky Mountains, and in 1964 Doc opened a chiropractic office
in Missoula. Because of opposition within Mason's following
stemming from a 1963 doctrinal dispute, he became discouraged
with the human side of the faith and stopped teaching altogether
shortly after moving to Montana.

Balch et al. / WHEN THE BOMBS DROP    141

In 1969Doc was convicted of performinga "lewdand lascivious
act" on a 15-year-oldpatient, and despite his claims of a frame-
up, he was sentenced to 20 years in the state penitentiary. Not
long after his arrival, Doc says he was visited in his cell by an
angel who informed him of his spiritual identity. Drawing on a
remarkable set of parallels between events in his life and certain
Biblical prophecies, Doc issued a proclamation in 1971 claiming
to be Joshua, the high priest prophesiedin Zechariah3. According
to Doc, Joshua is the return of Jesus who will establish the
Kingdom after the holocaust. EventuallyDoc claimed severalother
Biblical identities, including the Lamb and the Seventh Angel
described in Revelation.

Once the angel lifted the veil from his eyes, Doc was able to
comprehend the symbolism of the Scriptures. He began tying
together diverse strands of Biblical prophecy, Baha'i teachings,
and pyramidology, a fascination dating from his childhood. All
the evidence pointed to the same inescapable conclusion that
nuclear catastrophewas imminent. As early as 1971Doc predicted
that the war would begin in 1980, caused by a conflict between
the superpowers over Middle East oil. After the four waves of
destruction (Revelation 7:1) had cleansed the world of evil and
apostasy, Doc believed that the remainder of mankind would
embrace the BUPC faith and peace and harmony would prevail
for the next thousand years.

Shortly after his visitation, Doc began holding firesides for his
fellow inmates. Twice a week 20 to 30 attended his meetings, and
by the time he was paroled in 1973Doc had recruiteda small group
of highly committed believers.Some of his converts became effec-
tive teachers in their own right. One of Doc's first recruits was
largely responsible for establishing a branch of the faith in
Sheridan, Wyoming, where about 15 people eventually became
followers.

After his release Doc began spreading his message outside the
prison walls. In 1978 he took an extended trip throughout the
midwestern and Rocky Mountain states trying to convert many
of Mason Remey's followers, and his efforts led to the establish-
ment of small BUPC groups in Durango, Colorado and Ft. Smith,

142   SOCIOLOGICAL PERSPECTIVES / APRIL 1983

Arkansas. It is impossible to say how many believers there were
on the eve of April 29, 1980, but roughly 150 people in Montana,
Wyoming, Colorado, and Arkansas made plans to enter fallout
shelters "when the bombs dropped" (one of Doc's favorite
expressions).3

Prior to April 29 the BUPC were a recruitment-orientedgroup
whose lives revolved around teaching the faith. Teaching was
expected and Doc claimed that proselyting would be rewarded
with a high station in God's kingdom. To that end the BUPC
organized the Communications Club, a group modeled after
Toastmasters, to improve public speaking skills, and they com-
piled a "teacher's manual" explaining how to teach the faith to
nonbelievers. Recruitment proceeded almost entirely through
friendship networks and family ties (Stark and Bainbridge, 1980).
Persons interested in learning about the faith were invited to a
series of firesides, usually held in a member's home, where they
were systematically introduced to Doc's teachings as well as the
basic principles of the Baha'i faith. Although we have no, reliable
figures, it appears that most of those who completed the fireside
sequence became believers.

In 1979 Doc determinedthat the bombs would drop at precisely
5:55 p.m. Mountain Daylight Time. As the date approached, his
followers stepped up their efforts to prepare for the holocaust.
Their most ambitious undertaking was SAFE. Recognizing that
the organization might be discredited if it became identified with
a group of "religious fanatics," they preferred to keep its con-
nection with Doc a secret. Under the auspices of SAFE members
taught classes on sheltermanagementand radiologicalmonitoring,
and they printed thousands of leaflets explaining what to do in
the event of a nuclear attack.

SAFE disbanded after it was exposed as a BUPC project, and
because of lack of public support, its members abandoned their
plans to improvethe community's shelters.With the date less than
two months away, even teaching the faith diminished as Doc's
followers turned their energies to building and stocking their
private shelters. There were eight in the Missoula area, including
a "community shelter" for members who could not afford their

Balch et al. / WHEN THE BOMBS DROP    143

own. The major focus of group activity during the last month
was the print shop. Doc owned a small printing business that
printed commercial work by day and Doc's manuscripts by night.
Day after day the BUPC assembled pages until 2:00 or 3:00 a.m.
in a frantic effort to publish 10,000 copies of Doc's latest book
before April 29.

Meanwhile, the public was at least vaguely aware that the
Baha'is were preparing for Armageddon. Doc received con-
siderable local newspaper and TV coverage, and the Associated
Press carried several stories about his predictions. Although
members occasionally complained about media bias, they gen-
erally believed the coverage was fair. In Missoula there was some
ridicule in the form of jokes on the radio, impromptu doomsday
parties, and a few crank calls to believers, but overall the atmo-
sphere could best be described as indifferent.

Finally, on the night of April 28, about 80 believers met at a
potluck feast in Missoula for the last time before Armageddon.
They joked and laughed and enjoyed their meal as if nothing
unusual were about to happen. Were it not for the speeches that
followed, an outsider would not have guessed that these cheerful
people were expecting nuclear warheads to strike within 24 hours.
The festivities concluded around 10:00 p.m. and then the faithful
dispersedto their respectivesheltersto awaitthe missilesthat would
usher in the new age.

SUITABILITY OF THE BAHA'I SECT
FOR TESTING THE FESTINGER HYPOTHESIS

Festingeret al. specified five conditions that must be met before
prophetic failure can be expected to be followed by increased con-
viction and vigorous proselyting. According to the first, a belief
must be held with deep conviction and it must have some relevance
for action. Although the BUPC included many fringe members
who were skeptical about Doc's prediction, the vast majority took
it very seriously. Only a few expressed doubts to any of us, and
interviews with ex-members who left the group before April 29

144      SOCIOLOGICAL PERSPECTIVES / APRIL 1983

confirm our impressionthat the level of belief was very high. Doc's
prediction obviously had direct implications for their behavior.
Even true believers would perish if they did not prepare for the
holocaust, and the fact that they made extensive preparations is
strong evidence that members expected the bombs to drop on
April 29.

The second condition is closely tied to the first. Believers must
make irreversiblecommitments based on their conviction. Doc
was so confident that he staked the validity of all his teachings
on the accuracy of his prediction. For example, in a small book
entitled The Most Mighty Document (1979: 61-62) he posed the
following question:

> DOES YOUR RELIGION(sect or denomination)tell you the
> "Dayand the Hour"for the oncomingthermo-nuclear     holocaust
> in whicha thirdof mankindare to be killed, so that you can be
> 100miles from a thermo-nuclearblast (Rev.14:20)?If it doesn't
> it lacks Divine Guidanceto save you [italicsin original].

There is no doubt most believers made enormous commitments.
They organized SAFE to alert the community to the dangers of
radioactive fallout, and they built their own shelters at great
expense,often runningup huge bills which they had trouble paying
after the 29th. Virtually all of them attempted to persuade friends
and relativesto accept the faith or at least take precautions. Some
wrote to the local paper explaining their beliefs; a few wrote
pamphlets about the faith, which Doc printed and distributed
along with his own manuscripts. Many believers had moved to
Missoula, in some cases from almost 2000 miles away, just to be
near Doc when the war began.

The third condition is that the prediction must be sufficiently
specific to be refuted unequivocally.By specifying that the bombs
would drop at precisely 5:55 p.m. Mountain Daylight Time on
April 29, 1980, Doc clearly left no room for hedging.

The fourth condition requires undeniable evidence that the
predicted events did not occur. This, too, was quite clear. No
bombs fell on April 29; Doc's followers were well aware that the
day passed without incident.

Balch et al. / WHEN THE BOMBS DROP     145

Finally, there must be social support for the apocalyptic belief.

Festingeret al. added this provision because they felt that believers
would be unable to withstand the devasting impact of disconfir-
mation if they did not have at least some degree of support from
others. The BUPC met this condition as well. They were a close-
knit group, bound by a single undisputed leader, a shared set of
beliefs, family and friendship ties, and regular social interaction.
The believersreferredto themselves as "the friends" or "the com-
munity," and some compared themselves to an extended family,
an analogy that we found quite appropriate.The sect consistituted
a relativelyexclusivesocial world whereclose ties with nonbelievers
were unusual.

In short, the BUPC met all five conditions specified by Festinger
et al. How well, then, did their behavior following April 29 con-
form to the hypothesis that conviction and recruitment efforts
would increase after disconfirmation?

REACTIONS TO DISCONFIRMATION

Contrary to the hypothesis, the failure of Doc's prediction did
not strengthen the believers' convictions, nor did it produce an
increase in proselyting. In fact, just the opposite occurred. It took
severalmonths before some members would admit to us just how
badly shaken they had been when the bombs did not drop on
April 29.

Although reactionsvaried from shelterto shelter,most believers
at first appeared relatively unconcerned, as if the 29th had not
been an important event. Events in the community shelter pro-
vide a good example. The appointed time appeared to pass
unnoticed even though there had been a high degree of tension
earlierin the day. Members continued to work on last-minutepro-
jects, but the atmosphere became increasingly subdued as 5:55
approached and passed without incident. Since the shelter door
still was not securely in place, it was easy for believers to slip out
quietly, and many took advantage of the opportunity. Those who
remained said little. Around 8:30 p.m. a large group, including

the senior author, went out for dinner at a nearby restaurant. No
one seemed concerned about the possibility that Doc's predic-
tion might have been off by a few hours. In fact, no one said
anything about the bombs. Much of the meal was spent in silence
broken only by occasional small talk. Back in the shelter they
watched television or read quietly, saying almost nothing until
12:15a.m., when the sheltermanager casually asked a small group
of believerswhat they thought about the unexpectedturn of events.
However, there was little discussion, and by 1:00 a.m. the lights
were out and the shelter was completely silent.

The next few days wereundoubtedlythe most anomic the BUPC
had ever experienced. The situation could best be described as
an informationalvacuum. Doc's followerswere scatteredover four
states, and even in the Missoula area there were several shelters,
three of them about 30 miles out of town. Members were even
more widely dispersed than this implies because many stayed at
home on the assumption that they would have about eight hours
to seek shelter before the fallout arrived from West Coast target
areas like Portland and Seattle.Although their shelterswere equip-
ped with CB radios, Doc had not bothered to make specific plans
for keeping in contact with his followers, nor had he specified
any particular length of time that members should remain
underground. He merely assumed that they would need to stay
there about two weeks. In Missoula some of the believers stayed
for as long as three days, but most had come out by the evening
of April 30. In the community shelter about two-thirds of those
who had been there before 5:55 p.m. on the 29th had left by
midnight.

Doc's first response to disconfirmation was to reset the time
for 6:11 a.m. on May 7. Citing a passage in Revelation, he claimed
the reason for the delay was "to give the peoples of the world
a chance to hear the voice of their savior and be saved, or to con-
demn him and go into the fire." However,word of the new predic-
tion circulated informally by word of mouth because Doc made
no systematic effort to get the message out. In fact, the BUPC
did not meet again as a group until May 16.

During this period group activities stopped almost completely.
We never saw more than two or three people at the print shop,

and work on the community shelter was halfhearted at best. The
shelter committee met at least twice, but most of the enthusiastic
volunteers we had observed before April 29 had disappeared. The
group became decidedly less visible as believerswithdrewinto their
private spaces, and observation suddenly became very difficult.
Members who had once been extremely open to us cooled
noticeably. For example, on the senior author's first visit to the
community shelter after the 29th, most of the believers avoided
eye contact, gave brief, businesslike replies to questions, and
generally acted as if he were not there. Although Doc remained
friendly and open, we generally felt like intruders.

By May 4 Doc had added a four-page addendum, printed in
red, to his manuscript explaining what really happened on April
29\. Citing numerous phone calls from reporters as far away as
Australia, he claimed to have fulfilled the prophecy of Revela-
tion 16:17 and 18 in which the Seventh Angel pours his "bowl
of wrath"into the air. This, he said, refersto the worldwide media
coverage his message received on the 29th. In this addendum Doc
also drew a parallel between himself and Noah, claiming that the
Old Testamentprophet had been similarly mistaken the first time
he predictedthe deluge. He cited the Koran, which says that Noah
made three predictions before the flood finally occurred, and
Matthew 24:37, which prophsesies that "The coming of the Son
of Man will repeat what happened in Noah's time." This explana-
tion quickly became the most widely cited reason for the
disconfirmation.

While the red pages were being added to the book, Doc received
a phone call that provided him with still another explanation for
April 29. The caller, a formal Naval officer, claimed that the Soviet
Union had launched a spy satellite armed with nuclear warheads
at the precise moment Doc had predicted.4 Believing that the
United States considered this an act of war, Doc announced that
this action would set in motion a chain of events that would
culminate in the holocaust, now set for May 7.

In spite of Doc's explanation, the BUPC appeared very
demoralized. Most members we interviewedexpressed skepticism
about Doc's account of the spy satellite, although none would
rule it our entirely,and we rarelyheard anyone mention it in casual

conversations. The parallel with Noah continued to be the most
popular explanation for the disconfirmation, but some members
who had once presented themselves to us as true believers now
insisted that they had always been skeptical about Doc's predic-
tion. Many of them cited Matthew 25:13, which says that no man
knows the day or the hour when the Son of Man will return.

The May 7 date failed to rekindle enthusiasm. Most members
told us they did not believethe bombs would drop then, and hardly
anyone volunteered to work in the print shop or community
shelter.Fewerpeople made plans to reentera shelter,and the com-
munity shelter was almost empty when the date arrived. After
the 7th also passed uneventfullyDoc tried one last time, suggesting
that the bombs might drop on either May 22 or 23, but by then
no one (to our knowledge) believed him, and even Doc later
admitted to us that he had been "grasping at straws."

Within a few days after April 29 we began hearing comments
about increasing quarrels and family problems in the group,
including a brief fight between two members of the shelter com-
mittee. We witnessed several flareups ourselves. Most were
triggered by minor incidents like borrowing a tool without per-
mission, not returning something to its proper place, or leaving
a shelter door open.

On May 16 the Missoula group finally gathered for their first
feast since April 29. Normally the responsibility for feasts fell
to Doc's followers, but this time no one volunteered, so Doc
organized the gathering himself. Thirty-six believersattended, not
counting Doc and his wife, and almost all of them were core
members who had been extremely active in the faith prior to the
29th. Superficially there was no evidence of the tension and
demoralization we have described. The atmosphere was friendly
and cheerful, and not once did we hear anyone mention April
29 or the thermonuclear war, even though the third date was only
one week away.

After a few prayersabout persecution, suffering, and standing
fast in the faith, Doc addressedthe group. Besides explainingwhat
happened on April 29, he criticized his followers for bickering
and shirking their responsibilities. Using himself as an example

of courage in the face of adversity, he exorted them to remain
true to the faith, but we failed to observe any signs of enthusiasm
during his talk. Of particular significance were Doc's comments
on proselyting. As if even he did not think the bombs would drop
on May 22 or 23, he declared that the war would not begin until
the BUPC had recruited the 144,000 prophesied in Revelation.
To help spread the message he had brought a box of his books
and urged members to distribute copies all over town. Doc was
more forceful about proselyting than we had ever seen him. In
some of this strongest language he exhorted them to "Rise and
shine! Establish the Kingdom! Teach as you never have before!"

Despite Doc's pep talk, no one took any books and hardly any
teaching occurredthroughoutthe summer.To our knowledgenone
of Doc's followers was ever approached by the press, and none
of them sought media attention. Firesideswere discontinued, and
most believers kept a low profile in town. Usually they told us
that they did not mention the faith to anyone unless someone
asked them about it. Even Doc's efforts at spreading the faith
were subdued. He issued a press release,composed a lengthy letter
to the local paper which was never published, and answeredques-
tions from dozens of reporterswho called after the 29th; but other-
wise he did nothing to get his message out to the world.

Attendance at feasts continued to drop over the summer until
it hit an all-time low of 11 on September 27. The BUPC even
missed two feast dates because, again, no one volunteered. There
were three major reasons for the small attendance figures. First,
some of the 80 who attended the April 29 feast were not com-
mitted believers,but friends and relativeswho knew relativelylittle
about Doc and his teachings. None of these people ever returned.

Second, several members moved out of town, ostensibly to find
work, but often to escape what they described as an oppressive

atmosphere within the group poisoned by internal conflict. Even
though the BUPC strongly condemned the practiceof backbiting,
the amount of malicious gossip that circulated after the 29th was
considerable. Doc himself contributed to the problem. For
example, during a feast we attended, he openly questioned his

> followers about alleged drug use by three members who were

rumored to have joined a rival sect. The third reason for poor
attendanceat feasts is what some memberscharacterizedas "burn-
out." They had worked feverishly and exhausted their resources
preparing for the 29th, and now with the date postponed indef-
initely, they preferredto return to some semblance of normalcy.

However, the poor turnout at feasts did not reflect widespread
defection from the faith. For our purposes defection can be
defined as rejection of the formerly held belief that Doc is the
"promised one" prophesied in Zechariah. Since some of those
who made plans to enter a shelter did not even know much about
Doc, they could hardly be classified as defectors when they failed
to attend the feasts after April 29. If we restrict our attention to
those who genuinely believed in Doc, two patterns become
apparent. In the Missoula group we found only four members
who could be classified as defectors six months after the 29th.
Three of them had been central figures and their defection came
as a shock to the rest of the group. While the defectors refused
to reject the possibility that Doc might ultimately be right, they
each expressed serious reservations about his messianic claims.
Otherwise, everyone in the Missoula group continued to profess
belief in Doc, although many admitted that they occasionally
entertaineddoubts. It appears that even those who failed to attend
feasts over the summer continued to believe. On the other hand,
almost all the believersoutside Montana eventuallyrejectedDoc's
teachings. Everyone in the Arkansas group defected, as did most
of the believers in Colorado and Wyoming. To our knowledge
only three members of the Colorado group remained steadfast
by the end of the summer, and possibly two in Wyoming.5

During the summer we began to hear a new theme in both
formal interviews and casual conversations with believers. The
BUPC explained that the community had been so preoccupied
with preparations for the war before April 29 that they had
neglected the basic Baha'i teachings. They spoke less and less
about Doc and his predictions and increasingly about the need
to live their lives according to Baha'i principles. The best way to
teach the faith, they claimed, was to become a living example for
others. As one woman explained, "I think we all made a mistake.

We got too caught up in the physical. We weren't ready for the
war because spiritually none of us were strong enough." As early
as May 14 we noticed that hardly anyone still used the familiar
expression, "when the bombs drop." Although they all continued
to believe that war was inevitable,their personal predictionsvaried
from "within a year" to "the turn of the century."

We also detected a new fatalistic trend. Once obsessed with
preparedness,many believersadopted the attitude that they would
survive if God meant them to. They lost the community shelter
when they could no longer pay the rent on the warehouse base-
ment whereit was located, and most of the group's privateshelters,
including Doc's, were at least partly dismantled. Only two BUPC
in Wyoming remained active in civil defense work, but one of
them claimed she no longer believed in Doc.

For his part, Doc continued to revise his explanations for the
failure of the April 29 prediction, and in a lengthy new introduc-
tion to his book he declared that the seven-year Tribulation
described in Revelation had commenced on the predicted date.
Although he continued to insist that war was imminent, Doc
claimed that the four winds of destruction (Revelation 7:1) were
being held back until the 144,000 had been recruited. However,
he set no new date for the catastrophe and refused to be pinned
down even to an approximate time.

DISCUSSION

Contrary to the theory advanced by Festinger et al., we found
no evidence of increased conviction or proselyting in the first six

months after disconfirmation. Instead, there is considerable
evidence that the BUPC's faith was badly shaken by the failure
of Doc's prediction. Defection was widespreadin the out-of-state
groups; and even in Missoula, where virtually everyonecontinued
to profess belief, members resisted Doc's efforts to resume pros-
elyting. This finding is especially devastating for the Festinger
hypothesis because the Missoula group had a long tradition of
active recruitment before April 29.

In an attempt to explain why members of the True Word sect
did not proselyteafter Mrs. Shepard'sprophecywas disconfirmed,
Hardyk and Braden suggested that two additional variables need
to be considered in order to understand a group's reaction to pro-
phetic failure. The first is the degree of public ridicule. Accord-
ing to Hardyk and Braden, the more a group is berated for its
beliefs by outsiders, the more its members should feel the need
to justify their position by proselyting. Compared with the Lake
City group, which was ridiculed unmercifully by pranksters and
the local papers, the BUPC and True Word group had an easy
time with nonbelievers. In both cases the press was generally fair
and the public seemed indifferent to the episode.

The second variable is the level of social support enjoyed by
believers. While Festinger et al. argued that some degree of sup-
port is essential to prevent defection, Hardyk and Braden con-
tended that the consensual validation provided by a strong
community of believerscould reducedissonance to the point where
it would be unnecessary to recruit additional members. That is,
the urge to proselyte following disconfirmation should be greater
in groups providing weak support than in groups that are highly
supportive. Marian Keech's Lake City cult was a relatively new,
loose-knit group that lacked a well-integrated set of beliefs. For
awhile Mrs. Keech even had to vie for leadership with another
member who claimed to receive messages from none other than
the CreatorHimself. By contrast, the TrueWord sect was a highly
cohesive group with undisputed leaders and a coherent belief
system, so it should have provided greater social support in the
face of disconfirmation.

The BUPC case is less clear-cut but still consistent with Hardyk
> and Braden's hypothesis. Although the Missoula group had been
> relatively "tight" before April 29, it was quickly splintered by
> gossip and hostility, and most members withdrew from organ-
> ized group activities. Is it accurate to say, then, that the BUPC
> enjoyed a high degree of mutual support? We think it is, but only
with some clarification. First, despite the quarreling, most
members had formed strong ties with other believers that were
not affected by the group's internal disputes. Second, and perhaps
more important, most believers had strong identities as BUPC
that transcendedtheir commitment to Doc's prediction. For them
the faith offered both an all-embracingtheodicy and an eminently
desirable plan for living. While most had been attracted to the
faith by its apocalyptic orientation, they subsequently acquired
a firm grounding in a coherent body of Baha'i teachings dating
back over 100 years. As a result, Doc's followers were able to cope
with disconfirmation by shifting the focus of their lives away from
Doc and placing greater emphasis on the fundamentals of the
BUPC faith. Members of the Lake City group lacked this option
because their belief in Mrs. Keech's prediction was the sole basis
for their identity as members.

Thus Hardyk and Braden's post factum hypotheses appear to
explain why both the True Word group and the BUPC failed to
proselyte after disconfirmation. Yet there remains a puzzling
anomaly in our finding. Doc's followerswere severelydemoralized
by disconfirmation, while members of the other two groups pro-
claimed great victories for their faith. In both the Lake City and
TrueWordgroups, testimonies and follow-up interviewsindicated
that disconfirmation may have even strengthened belief.6 What
accounts for the difference? Comparison of the three groups sug-
gests that the social context in which disconfirmation is exper-
ienced might be the critical factor determining the reaction to
prophetic failure.

In the Festinger study Mrs. Keech and most of her followers
were together in the same house when disconfirmation occurred.
Within hours after her prophecy failed Mrs. Keech offered what
became the group's "official" explanation. The world had been

spared from destruction because of their faith. The next day
members confronted numerous reporters and other visitors who
came to the house to hear how Mrs. Keech would explain the
failure of her prediction.

The situation was very similarin the TrueWordgroup. Although
there were several shelters, each group had a strong leader and
the shelters were connected by an intercom system that allowed
the leaders to deal with questions, doubts, and dissent as soon
as they appeared. We are not told how long it took Mrs. Shepard
to rationalize the failure of her prophecy, but her explanation
obviously could have been communicated to all of her followers
very rapidly.When membersof the TrueWordsect finally emerged
from their shelters, they also confronted the press as a group, and
the leaders held an impromptu news conference to explain why
the attack had not occurred.

On the other hand, the BUPC experienced disconfirmation as
a widely dispersed collection of small groups that lacked a well-
thought-out plan for staying in contact with each other. Doc made
no systematic effort to communicate with his followers immedi-
ately after disconfirmation, and his explanations- suggested and
revised over a period of months - were disseminated haphazardly
by word of mouth. Members never confronted representativesof
the outside world as a group; even in Missoula they did not meet
again for over two weeks after the 29th.

What we have here are three groups with enormous material
and psychological investments in a millennial dream which sud-
denly collapsed. It is hard to imagine a more ambiguous situa-
tion than the first uneasy moments after disconfirmation. It is
a well-established principle that the more ambiguous the situa-
tion, the greater the demand for information in the form of
rational explanations and guidelines for behavior, especially when
the situation has important implications for action (Allport and
Postman, 1974; Festinger, 1954; Shibutani, 1966; Turner and
Killian, 1972). In his early theory of social comparison Festinger
(1954) postulated that there is a basic drive in human beings to
evaluate their opinions and beliefs. When objective reality checks
are unavailable,people tend to rely on others as points of reference.

Doc's failure to act decisively and the group's lack of organ-

> guity caused by prophetic failure. Without the imminence of

> Kingdom suddenly seemed remote and the means for achieving

> Cohen, 1959; Raven and Rietsema, 1956) have demonstrated that
ambiguous goals and uncertainty about how to achieve them are

relatedto personal insecurity,emotional tension, weakened attrac-
tion to the group, loss of motivation to accomplish collective tasks,
and declining conformity to group norms. Compared to the Lake
City and TrueWord groups, the BUPC experiencedthe ambiguity
of disconfirmationfor a longer period, and also appearedfar more
discouragedby the failureof their prophecy.Significantly,the Lake
City believerswho weremost likely to defect werethose who exper-
ienced disconfirmation alone. Much like Doc's followers,they had
to endure the ambiguity of prophetic failure longer than the
believers who were in the company of Mrs. Keech.

When Doc finally made a strong pitch for proselyting 17 days
after April 29, his followers were already demoralized and a pat-
tern of resignation, withdrawal, and internal conflict had been
established, so it is easy to understandwhy they failed to respond.
Mrs. Keech, on the other hand, immediately provided a clear
example for the others by calling a reporter to explain what had
happened. Given the susceptibility to social influence of people
caught in highly ambiguous situations, it is possible that the
leader's initial reaction to disconfirmation could determine
whether or not the group engaged in proselyting regardless of
social support or public ridicule.

Not only did the BUPC endure more uncertainty,but they never
had to confront the press as a group. This is a significant dif-
ference, because this kind of public meeting is likely to elicit a
strong reaffirmation of faith. Members are, in effect, on stage

in the company of fellow believers before an audience of skep-
tics, and in that situation they are likely to play the role of believer
regardlessof their real feelings (Balch, 1980). By enacting the role,
especially before reporters, press photographers, and TV
cameramen, they are recommitting themselves to their beliefs.
Except for Doc, none of the BUPC was ever induced to recom-
mit himself or herself in this manner.

In conclusion, we believe the data discussed here suggest that
reactions to disconfirmed prophecy depend on the nature of the
social situation in which prophetic failure occurs. The example
of the BUPC reveals the inadequacy of the psychological model
used by Festinger et al. The theory of cognitive dissonance is
simply unable to account for the complexities we observed in the
wake of disconfirmation.

Although our conclusions are tentative,three hypotheses appear
to be warranted by the data. First, the more central the predic-
tion is to one's identity as a believer, the greater the need to con-
vince others after disconfirmation. Second, members are most
likely to suffer severe demoralization when their leader fails to
providea quick explanationfor their predicamentand take decisive
steps to restore the group's integrity. Third, believers who are
forced to explain the failure of their prediction to nonbelievers
in public settings are more likely to profess strong convictions
and attempt to persuade others after disconfirmation. As these
hypotheses suggest, future research on disconfirmed prophecy
should explore the nature of the believer's identity as a member,
the reactions of the group's leadership to prophetic failure, and
the kind of contact the group has with outsiders immediatelyafter
disconfirmation.

NOTES

1. In this article we follow the definitions of "cult" and "sect" offered by Stark and
Bainbridge (1979). A sect has a prior tie with another religious organization, while a cult
is a nonschismatic group that lies outside established religious traditions. A millennial
movement may be either a cult or a sect. It is a religious group that promises imminent

collective salvation for the faithful in an earthy paradise that will rise in the wake of
apocalyptic destruction brought about by supernatural means (Cohn, 1970: 15).

2. This is the group's real name, and members refer to themselves as Baha'is despite
the fact that the Baha'i Faith disavows any connection with the sect and objects to its
use of the Baha'i name. At the request of a spokesman for the Baha'i Faith, we have
used the abbreviation BUPC to prevent confusion. The Baha'i name has been used only
in connection with the international Baha'i Faith or Baha'i writings that are fundamen-
tal to both groups.

3. With few exceptions, Doc's followers are young working-class adults. Typical occu-
pations in the Missoula group include gardener, mechanic, tree thinner, mill worker, bus
driver, electrician, printer, and welder. Although a few members hold white-collar posi-
tions, only two in Missoula could be classified as professionals. Doc's wife, an elder in
the faith, is also a chiropractor, and another woman is a speech therapist. Overall their
living standardsare quite modest. Most own relativelyfew material possessions and hardly
any of them are homeowners. All but a few are in their twenties, and roughly a third
of the active believers are married.

4. In fact, the local paper reported that the Soviets did launch a spy satellite on April
29, but we have been unable to verify the time of day. The caller claimed to have received
his information "from the Holy Spirit."

5. Unfortunately, our knowledge of the out-of-state groups is based on just eight inter-
views. While we have no doubts about the overall direction of the results in these groups,
the exact numbers are open to question.

6. We are not entirelyconvinced by Hardyckand Braden'sdata. Ratherthan observing
the True Word group directly, they relied entirely on after-the-fact interviews, which are
highly subject to retrospective interpretation and social desirability effects. Members of
deviant religious groups often misrepresent their true feelings to outsiders (e.g., Balch,
1980), and without built-in validity checks, especially direct observation, these distor-
tions can easily pass unnoticed. In our study of the BUPC we found numberous instances
where members' recollections of their reactions to disconfirmation did not jibe with our
observations or the reports of others. Unfortunately, there is no evidence that Hardyck
and Braden attempted to verify the accuracy of their findings.
