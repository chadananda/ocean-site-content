> by Michael Karlberg

We live in a culture of contest and protest. Our economic, political, and
legal institutions are structured as contests. Our efforts to reform these
institutions frequently are characterized by protest. This article examines
the social and ecological implications of this culture of contest and protest.
It begins by demonstrating that our economic, political, and legal institu-
tions form an integrated tripartite system of contests that is socially unjust
and ecologically unsustainable. It then considers the paradox of attempting
to reform these institutions through protest and other adversarial strategies
of social change. The article concludes by outlining a theory of social change
that derives from the concept of cultural games. This theory suggests that
the nonadversarial strategies of construction, attraction, and attrition are
the most effective means of creating a more peaceful, just, and sustainable
social order.

We live in a culture of contest. In our economic systems, our political
systems, and our legal systems, contest models are the norm. Surround-
ing this culture of contest is a culture of protest. In our pursuit of social
change, adversarial strategies such as protests, demonstrations, acts of
civil disobedience, partisan organizing, litigation, and strikes are the
norm.

Many of these competitive institutions and adversarial strategies
have been critiqued through various theoretical lenses by other peace
and change scholars. What has not been theorized adequately, however,
is the integrated nature of this entire system of contest and protest. This
article examines the social and ecological implications of the integrated
tripartite system of contests in our economic, political, and legal spheres,
as well as the paradox of attempting to reform these institutions through
a culture of protest. It concludes by outlining a theory of social change
that derives from the concept of cultural games. This theory suggests
that the nonadversarial strategies of construction, attraction, and

attrition are the most effective means of creating a more peaceful, just,
and sustainable social order.

THE CULTURE OF CONTEST: SOCIAL IMPLICATIONS

All contests, by deﬁnition, result in winners and losers. In most recrea-
tional contests the stakes are not high and winning or losing is not a
great concern. In addition, such contests can be intrinsically rewarding
or fun. However, when contests are employed as instrumental means
to other ends—such as the distribution of wealth, the distribution of
political power, or the dispensation of justice—they take on different
signiﬁcance. In such cases the stakes can be very high. In addition, though
such contests serve instrumental purposes, they have little or no intrinsic
value. Hence it is important to distinguish between recreational contests
and instrumental contests.

With this distinction established, it is also important to recog-
nize that all contests are contests of power. The forms of power that
are relevant in a given contest depend upon the speciﬁc nature of the
contest. In athletic contests like tennis or football, the outcome is
determined by physical powers such as strength, stamina, skill, and
coordination. In mental contests like chess or bridge, the outcome is
determined by intellectual powers such as strategic thought, concen-
tration, and memory. However, even in recreational contests, political
and economic forces often inﬂuence who wins. Though physical and
mental capacities are distributed evenly throughout the human popula-
tion, opportunities to cultivate and to reﬁne these capacities, or powers,
are not distributed evenly. Such opportunities are determined by one’s
position in socially constructed hierarchies of class, race, gender, nation-
ality, and so forth.

These hierarchies of power become even more problematic in the
case of instrumental contests, where the stakes are much higher. Con-
sider the capitalist economy. In theory, those who are the hardest work-
ing, most innovative, and efﬁcient “win” in a free-market contest. In
practice, however, competitors do not all enter the contest at the same
time with the same resources because resources (such as wealth, social
connections, and educational opportunities) are not distributed equally
in human populations. In this regard, the contemporary economy is like
a game of Monopoly™ in which some players started the game early,
played until they bought up most of the property, and then invited other
players to join them. Even though the latecomers have been invited to

play by the same rules as those who started the game earlier, they
perpetually are handicapped by a constant need to pay rent and by few
opportunities to accumulate their own properties.

Consider also the case of partisan politics—a contest model of gov-
ernance that is founded on the same organizing principles as a capitalist
free market.1 In the economic market, capitalists compete for control
over the means of economic production. Likewise, in the political
market, politicians compete for control over the reigns of government.
In the political marketplace this occurs, quite literally, through processes
of “political entrepreneurship,” in which politicians compete with one
another in their efforts to build and maintain “political capital.” In
theory such contests are fair and open and the outcome merely reﬂects
the aggregate preferences of the majority of voters. As Vaughan Lyon
explains, “Supporters of party government argue that if one looks at the
larger picture and sees the ‘political market’ in which several parties, the
media, interest groups, and individuals all interact, democratic needs
are served in a kind of mysterious way ... [as though] another ‘invisible
hand’ is at work.”2

In practice, however, the invisible hand of the political market acts
much like the invisible hand of the economic market. It privileges those
with the most power. The reasons for this are not difﬁcult to under-
stand. Political contests are very expensive. Winning requires a substan-
tial amount of personal wealth or ﬁnancial patronage. Therefore, by
structuring our political processes as contests we have created systems
that cater primarily to the interests of those who can afford either to
ﬁnance the contestants directly or to inﬂuence their success indirectly.

Finally, consider the case of legal advocacy contests. The legal
adversary system is founded on the same competitive principles as the
capitalist economy and the partisan political system. The underlying
assumption of the legal adversary system is that the truth is most likely
to emerge in an open contest because no one has more incentive to work
for the emergence of truth than the righteous contestant.3 In practice,
however, the truth is a secondary and often elusive outcome.4 In actual
legal contests, though one contestant may be working hard to present
the truth, the other contestant can be working equally hard to obscure
the truth. Indeed, the prevailing legal principle of “zealous advocacy”
raises this practice to the level of a professional responsibility for legal
advocates even when their clients are guilty.5 Furthermore, legal con-
tests, like political campaigns, are very expensive. The power of money,
rather than the power of truth, is what buys the best legal advocacy.6

332                   PEACE & CHANGE / July 2003

The result is a system of jurisprudence that primarily caters to the inter-
ests of those who can afford to ﬁnance the best legal advocacy. As Anne
Strick explains, this contest model

> serves not only the lawyers and judges who directly administer it
> but society’s power-holders down the ranks. For adversariness is a
> mode that singularly advantages power. Most of its beneﬁciaries
> therefore worship adversary procedure “like motherhood itself ” and
> either remain blind to its defects, hold that despite those defects it
> serves a higher good, or work at screening its fraud from public
> gaze. Yet fraud it is. For by its nature the adversary approach to
> dispute settlement disserves the rest of us—almost totally.7

In any one of these arenas—market, government, and courts—
contest models tend to privilege those at the top of existing social
hierarchies. Of course, we still might accept these models based on the
rationalization that no model is perfect, that all models involve tradeoffs,
and that these particular models have great strengths that outweigh
their weaknesses. However, if we step back to view these three models
as a single integrated system, which is what they have become, then
these rationalizations fail.

Our economic, political, and legal systems are not separate, isolated
systems. They are interconnected and interdependent. They can be
understood and analyzed as an integrated tripartite system of contests.
This tripartite system is deeply problematic because modeling all three
of these spheres as contests inherently subordinates political and legal
regulation to market forces. The logic is simple: Because political and
legal contests are expensive, the outcomes of political and legal contests
are determined by the outcomes of economic contests, which are themselves
inﬂuenced by preexisting social hierarchies. Hence, the tripartite system
has an inherent internal hierarchy. Political and legal contests inevitably
are subordinated to economic contests due to the nature of contests.

By critiquing this hierarchical arrangement and by pointing out that
it is an inevitable result of the integration of these three contest models,
I am not suggesting that competition itself is inherently problematic in
every sphere of social activity. Recreational contests may have some
intrinsic value if pursued in the proper spirit.8 Even in an instrumental
arena such as the economy, a market system that rewards hard work,
innovation, and efﬁciency appears to be desirable. The problem arises
when these three instrumental contests are conjoined within this

tripartite arrangement, because in order to avoid extremes of wealth
and poverty in the economic arena, competition needs to be regulated
responsibly. Yet within this tripartite system it is virtually impossible to
regulate the economy in a just manner because the political and legal
institutions that should be regulating it instead are subordinate to it.

Moreover, to be effective, political and legal regulations ultimately
need to be complemented by the moral self-regulation of individual
economic actors.9 Only by operating in concert can these internal and
external forms of regulation provide the necessary constraints and in-
centives needed to maximize the beneﬁts of a free market while curbing
its excesses. Yet here again, just as a tripartite system of contests fails
to provide for external regulations on market activity, it also fails to
cultivate moral self-regulation among market actors. When virtually all
public activity is structured as a series of contests that reward the
competitive pursuit of material self-interests, the cultural environment is
hardly conducive to moral development and self-regulation. Ubiquitous
and indiscriminant competition tends to cultivate aggressive and indi-
vidualistic values rather than communal and cooperative ones.10

One of the primary legacies of this tripartite system, with its failure
of both external and internal regulation of market activities, is the mas-
sive and steadily increasing disparity of wealth and poverty that can be
seen within and among virtually every country on earth.11 These condi-
tions constitute one of the most signiﬁcant obstacles to peace in the
world today because they foster a state of perpetual conﬂict and in-
stability within and among nations. These are the social implications of
the culture of contests. What about the ecological implications?

THE CULTURE OF CONTEST: ECOLOGICAL IMPLICATIONS

Upon critical examination this tripartite system tends not only to be
socially unjust, but it tends also to be environmentally unsustainable.
Consider, again, the functioning of the free market within the tripartite
system. In unregulated markets, production and consumption decisions
are based largely on the internal costs of manufacturing processes. These
include costs of labor, materials, manufacturing equipment, energy, and
so forth. These internal costs determine the retail prices that consumers
pay for products, which in turn inﬂuence how much they consume. These
costs, however, seldom reﬂect the true ecological price of a product. Many
industries generate external costs, or externalities, that are never factored
into the price of a product because they are not actual production costs.12

334                  PEACE & CHANGE / July 2003

For instance, industries that pollute the environment create sub-
stantial public health and environmental remediation costs that seldom
are factored into the actual costs of production. Rather, these costs are
borne by the entire society, by future generations, and even by other
species. Because an unregulated market does not account for these ex-
ternal costs, the prices of products with high external costs are, in effect,
kept artiﬁcially low through taxpayer subsidies as well as the impover-
ishment of “ecological capital.”13 These subsidized prices inﬂate con-
sumption of the most ecologically expensive (or damaging) products.

For these reasons, market economies are ecologically unsustainable
unless carefully regulated by governments that account for such exter-
nal costs and that factor them back into the prices of goods through
“green taxes” and other means.14 As discussed above, however, markets
are virtually impossible to regulate effectively within the tripartite sys-
tem because the system subordinates political and legal decision-making
to market inﬂuences.

Contest models are unsustainable for other reasons as well. En-
vironmental stewardship requires long-term planning and commitment.
Competitive political systems, however, are constrained inherently by
short-term horizons because in order to gain and maintain political
capital, political entrepreneurs must cater to the immediate interests
of voting constituents. This focus on constituents-in-the-present tends to
undermine commitment to the interests of future generations. Pro-
minent among the interests of future generations, of course, is the sus-
tainable stewardship of the environment by present generations. Even in
those exceptional cases when sustainable policies are adopted out of moral
principle by one candidate or party, continuity often is compromised
by successive candidates or parties who dismantle or fail to enforce the
programs of their predecessors to distance themselves from policies they
previously opposed on the campaign trail or as the voice of opposition.

Likewise, just as competitive political systems are responsive to
constituents-in-the-present at the exclusion of future generations, they
are also responsive to the interests of constituents-within-electoral-
boundaries at the exclusion of people outside of those boundaries. This
is especially the case at the level of the nation state due to the absence of
an effective international system of governance. Again, this has signiﬁc-
ant ecological implications. The transboundary nature of many modern
environmental issues (e.g., ozone depletion, global warming, acid rain,
water pollution, or the management of migratory species) signals the
need for unprecedented levels of global cooperation and coordination.15

Competitive notions of national sovereignty, however, render the existing
international (dis)order virtually incapable of responding to these eco-
logical imperatives. Within the existing international system, sustainability
is sacriﬁced to the pursuit of national self-interests as political entrepre-
neurs must cater to the short-term desires of their own voting citizens.
The consequence is an anarchic and competitive system of nation-states
vying with one another in their rush to convert long-term ecological
capital into short-term material gains.

Another reason partisan systems tend to be ecologically unsustainable
has to do with the nature of partisan debate, which is about winning
political capital. Choosing the best course of action under a given set of
social and ecological conditions tends to be a secondary and generally
elusive outcome. Moreover, partisan debate tends to reduce complex
and multifaceted issues to simple polarized positions.16 Yet most envir-
onmental issues are complex and multifaceted. They cannot be resolved
through simple dualistic arguments. Furthermore, in an age of mass-
mediated sound-bite politics, these dualistic arguments tend to degener-
ate into emotional sloganeering designed merely for short-term political
advantage. Such partisan rhetoric is woefully inadequate as a basis for
sound environmental decision-making.

Finally, competitive political systems also tend to be ecologically
dysfunctional because those segments of the population who tend to
suffer the most from the effects of environmental degradation—namely
the poor and ethnic minorities who are statistically most likely to live
and to work in areas of increased environmental health risks and
degradation—are least able to inﬂuence political decision-making due to
their relative political and economic disenfranchisement. As a result,
environmental practices that seldom are tolerated in the backyards of
more afﬂuent segments of the population are commonplace among
populations that are marginalized politically and economically.17 The
tripartite system thus can be seen as an integrated system of social injus-
tice and ecological dysfunction. Yet if this is the case, why does this
system endure? Is it, as conventional wisdom suggests, an inevitable
outcome of an essentially selﬁsh and competitive human nature?

THE MYTH OF BIOLOGICAL DETERMINISM

The assumption that human nature is fundamentally selﬁsh and com-
petitive has deep roots in Western culture, tracing back through various
Greco-Roman traditions and Judeo-Christian interpretations.18 With the

336                   PEACE & CHANGE / July 2003

dawn of the European Enlightenment, this assumption became embedded
in the emerging canons of Western-liberal social theory. As Rose,
Lewontin, and Kamin point out, the modern articulation of this assumption

> goes back to the emergence of bourgeois society in the seventeenth
> century and to Hobbes’s view of human existence as bellum omnium
> contra omnes, a war of all against all, leading to a state of
> human relations manifesting competitiveness, mutual fear, and the
> desire for glory. For Hobbes, it followed that the purpose of social
> organization was merely to regulate these inevitable features of
> the human condition. And Hobbes’s view of the human condition
> derived from his understanding of human biology; it was biological
> inevitability that made humans what they were.19

This assumption continued to exert a dominant inﬂuence on the West-
ern social sciences through most of the 20th century.20 In recent decades,
however, it has come under scrutiny by scholars from a range of discip-
lines.21 Anthropologists such as Howell and Willis have pointed out that

> the great majority of researchers assert that “aggression” is an integ-
> ral part of human nature; and that aggressive impulses and behavior
> have somehow to be directed and controlled for human relations to
> be sustained over time in a social setting.... We wish to propose an
> alternative approach, challenging the assumption that aggression is
> an innate human drive. It is undeniably the case that in Western
> society aggression is regarded as part of human nature. But perhaps
> this tells us more about Western society than about human nature.
> We wish to suggest that we cannot assume an a priori aggressive
> drive in humans. The presence of innate sociality, on the other
> hand, has much evidence in its favour. Humans are a priori
> sociable beings; it is their cooperativeness that has enabled them to
> survive, not their aggressive impulses.22

Of course, such conclusions need not deny the existence of conﬂict
and competition in human societies. Human beings appear to have
the developmental potential for both conﬂict and cooperation. Which
potential is more fully developed, however, depends on our cultural
environment—as demonstrated by the fact that different societies vary
considerably in their expressions of conﬂict and cooperation.23

Some economists are arriving at a parallel conclusion. Rejecting the
essentially self-interested and competitive model of human nature that

has dominated for centuries, economists are acknowledging increasingly
the human potential for cooperative, altruistic, and even self-sacriﬁcing
behavior.24 In fact, a growing body of economic theory and research
suggests that the competitive pursuit of self-interests is often a less effec-
tive strategy than mutual cooperation—even when measured strictly by
indicators of material gain.25 In this context, economists, along with
game theorists, have demonstrated that cooperative behaviors well may
have been selected for in human evolution due to the advantages they
confer relative to adversarial behaviors. 26

In addition, many social scientists have begun expressing concern
about the self-fulﬁlling nature of assumptions that our species is essen-
tially selﬁsh and competitive. Numerous studies suggest, for instance,
that neoclassically trained economists tend to behave in more self-
interested ways than noneconomists, due in part to their continual
exposure to these assumptions.27 As Zamagni explains,

> Our beliefs about human nature help shape human nature itself,
> in the sense that what we think about ourselves and our possibili-
> ties determine what we aspire to become. In this precise sense, the
> self-interest theory is not morally neutral, contrary to what most
> economists seem to believe. There is growing evidence that the self-
> interest paradigm may be self-fulﬁlling ... subjects come to perceive
> self-interest as a normative characterization of rational behavior
> and come to act accordingly. It is here that the effects of the
> self-interest theory are most disturbing.28

By naturalizing conﬂict, competition, and other adversarial expres-
sions within our economic, political, and legal arenas, the theory of
biological determinism generates and perpetuates the reality it merely
purports to explain. It helps cultivate the behaviors that it presupposes.29
Those behaviors then tend to be invoked in order to rationalize and to
defend contest models of social organization.

THE CULTURAL BASIS OF CONTEST MODELS

If this tripartite system is not an inevitable outcome of human nature, it
must have a cultural rather than biological explanation. Yet if it is
proving to be socially unjust and ecologically unsustainable, how can
we explain its emergence and persistence?

Contest models of social organization—at least in their modern tri-
partite combination—arose from the thinking of relatively afﬂuent and

educated social classes during the European Enlightenment. These models
coincided with the self-interests of those powerful social classes because
contests, as discussed above, tend to favor those with the most power.
At the same time, those powerful classes occupied positions of cultural
leadership—as merchants, statesmen, writers, philosophers, and so forth
—through which, either consciously or unconsciously, they inﬂuenced
popular assumptions regarding human nature and social organization.

The Italian theorist Antonio Gramsci described this form of cultural
inﬂuence with remarkable insight in the ﬁrst half of the 20th century.30
His concept of “hegemony” since has entered into the lexicon of
cultural theorists around the world, and it provides a useful framework
for understanding the emergence and perpetuation of these contest
models. In brief, Gramsci borrowed the term hegemony, which traditionally
referred to the geopolitical dominance of some states over others, and
he reworked it to refer to the cultural dominance of some social classes
over others. Gramsci pointed out that political hegemony, which is
achieved and is maintained largely by force, is an obvious focus of
resistance by oppressed populations and therefore is relatively difﬁcult
to maintain over time. Cultural hegemony, on the other hand, is achieved
and is maintained through the cultivation of common sense belief
systems, which are less obvious and which therefore generate less resist-
ance. In other words, to the degree that privileged social classes can
naturalize the existing social order in the minds of subordinate classes,
the latter unconsciously will consent to their own subordination.

An example of this can be seen in the traditional exclusion of women
from many arenas of public life. This exclusion was reinforced by the
cultivation of “common-sense” notions regarding the “appropriate” role
of women in society. Of course, not all women accepted these notions,
and many struggled against them. But remarkably, some women did
accept these notions, as demonstrated by women who organized in
opposition to women’s suffrage movements on the “common-sense”
conviction (among others) that their entrance into public life would
compromise the moral purity of women and that the entire social fabric
thereby would be weakened.31

The theory of cultural hegemony is also useful in explaining the
widespread consent given to the tripartite system of contests. The belief
that competition is an inevitable expression of human nature has
become part of our inherited common sense. This assumption continues
to be reinforced from virtually every direction through these same
competitive institutions that now structure our daily activities, as well
as through our educational systems, which tend to structure learning as

a contest, and through our commercial media, which exaggerate and
amplify all of these competitive and conﬂictual activities. Furthermore,
on those rare occasions when the naturalness of the existing social order
is questioned, an extensive apparatus of economic, political, and legal
theory exists to defend it.

This is not to suggest a conscious conspiracy on the part of those
who beneﬁt from the existing social order. This order naturally appears
desirable to those who beneﬁt from it because people tend to have an
unconscious afﬁnity for ideas that promote their own interests.32 When
these people also happen to be educated and afﬂuent elites who largely
control the means of cultural production, it is quite natural that they
would end up cultivating, within the wider population, beliefs for which
they have an afﬁnity.

THE PARADOX OF PROTEST

Cultural common sense leads many to believe that the best way to
organize every social institution is in the form of a contest. Paradoxically,
it also leads many to believe that the best way to reform those institu-
tions is through protest—and other adversarial strategies of social change.
Protests, demonstrations, partisan organizing, litigation, strikes, and other
oppositional strategies are standard methods for pursuing social change.
In more extreme cases, violence and terrorism also are employed.

All of these strategies, however, have become paradoxical and self-
limiting. If they were viable in the past, they now appear to have reached a
point of diminishing returns. Adversarial strategies legitimate the assump-
tions regarding human nature and social organization that sustain the
tripartite system. When social activists engage in partisan political organ-
izing, they legitimate the contest models of governance that keep them
at a perpetual disadvantage. Likewise, when social activists engage in
litigation, they legitimate the adversarial systems of jurisprudence that
keep them at a perpetual disadvantage. Even street protests, demonstra-
tions, and acts of civil disobedience legitimate the underlying assumption
that contest and opposition are necessary forms of social interaction.

Granted, social activists do “win” occasional “battles” in these
adversarial arenas, but the root causes of their concerns largely remain
unaddressed and the larger “wars” arguably are not going well.
Consider the case of environmental activism. Countless environmental
protests, lobbies, and lawsuits have been mounted in recent generations
throughout the Western world. Many small victories have been won.
Yet environmental degradation continues to accelerate at a rate that

far outpaces the highly circumscribed advances made in these limited
battles, and even the most committed environmentalists acknowledge
that the overall war is not going well.33

In addition, adversarial strategies of social change embody assump-
tions that have internal consequences for social movements, such as
internal factionalization. For instance, virtually all of the social projects
of the “left” throughout the 20th century have suffered from recurrent
internal factionalization. The opening decades of the century were marked
by political inﬁghting among vanguard communist revolutionaries. The
middle decades of the century were marked by theoretical disputes among
leftist intellectuals. The century’s closing decades have been marked by
the fracturing of the “new left” under the centrifugal pressures of
identity politics. Underlying this pattern of inﬁghting and factionalization
is the tendency to interpret differences—of class, race, gender, perspec-
tive, or strategy—as sources of antagonism and conﬂict.34

In this regard, the political “left” and “right” both deﬁne
themselves in terms of a common adversary—the “other”—deﬁned by
political differences. Not surprisingly, advocates of both the left and
right frequently invoke the need for internal unity in order to prevail
over their adversaries on the other side of the alleged political spectrum.
However, because the terms left and right are both artiﬁcial and reiﬁed
categories that do not reﬂect the complexity of actual social relations,
values, or beliefs, there is no way to achieve lasting unity within either
camp because there are no actual boundaries between them. In reality,
social relations, values, and beliefs are inﬁnitely complex and variable.
Yet once an adversarial posture is adopted by assuming that differences
are sources of conﬂict, initial distinctions between the left and the right
inevitably are followed by subsequent distinctions within the left and
the right. Once this centrifugal process is set in motion, it is difﬁcult, if
not impossible, to restrain.

For all of these reasons, adversarial strategies have reached a point
of diminishing returns. Even if such strategies were necessary and viable
in the past, when human populations were less socially and ecologically
interdependent, those conditions no longer exist. Our reproductive and
technological success as a species has led to conditions of unprecedented
interdependence, and no group on the planet is isolated any longer.
Under these new conditions, new strategies not only are possible but are
essential. Humanity has become a single interdependent social body. In
order to meet the complex social and environmental challenges now
facing us, we must learn to coordinate our collective actions. Yet a body

cannot coordinate its actions as long as its “left” and its “right,” or its
“north” and its “south,” or its “east” and its “west” are locked in
adversarial relationships.

Pressures for such coordinated collective action are mounting daily.

Threats of ecological degradation, resource scarcity, species extinctions,
global health pandemics, nuclear and biological contamination, terror-
ism, military conﬂict, and so forth all are pressing us to ﬁnd new modes
of collective and coordinated action. Under these conditions, neither the
tripartite system of contests nor adversarial strategies of social change
are viable any longer.

A CULTURAL GAME THEORY OF SOCIAL CHANGE

If we cannot transform the culture of contest through a culture of
protest, how else can we pursue social change? Answering this question
requires a fundamental shift in our thinking. To effect this shift,
consider the metaphor of a cultural game. Cultural institutions can be
conceptualized as “games” that operate according to speciﬁc sets of
“rules.”35 This metaphor is especially well suited to thinking about
the tripartite system of contests and about the strategies that might be
employed to change or to transform it.

Within the culture of contest, virtually every institution, or game,
operates according to competitive rules. These rules ensure not only that
there will be winners and losers but also that the most powerful players
are most likely to win. When less powerful players agree to join in these
games, they are consenting to play by rules that tend to promote their
own defeat. Adversarial strategies of social change, such as protest, are
consistent with these competitive rules. Not only do they legitimize the
old games, but they also are part of them. Again, they ensure that the
most powerful players are more likely to prevail.

There is, however, another strategy: to withdraw your time and
energy from the old games in order to construct new ones. The only
thing perpetuating the old games (i.e., the tripartite system of contests)
is the fact that the majority of people consent to the rules. If alternative
games begin to yield recognizable results (i.e., increased social justice and
environmental sustainability), then they will begin to attract increasing
numbers of people to them (i.e., the majority of people whose interests
and values are not well served by the old game). If enough people stop
playing by the old rules and start playing by new ones, the old games
will come to an end not through protest but through attrition. The

alternative strategy, then, is one of construction, attraction, and attrition.
This strategy, moreover, is entirely nonadversarial. It reconciles the means
of social change with the ends of a peaceful and just social order.

At ﬁrst glance this may sound like a naive retreat from the hard
work that needs to be done to pursue social change, but the cultural
game theory suggests exactly the opposite. Activists pursuing adversarial
strategies of social change are consenting to play by the old rules that
promote their own defeat. Such is the hegemony of the culture of con-
test. Even those who protest and ﬁght for social change are, in effect,
contained within its hegemonic boundaries. Yet contrary to “common
sense” within the culture of contest, social change does not require
defeating oppressors or taking on opponents through adversarial means,
nor does it require attacking those who proﬁt most from the old rules of
engagement. Rather, it requires that we recognize the hegemonic nature
of the old competitive and adversarial games, that we withdraw our
time and energy from them, and that we invest that time and energy in
the construction of new ones.

This recognition dissolves the paradox created by the culture of
protest. Increasing numbers of people are beginning to recognize this
intuitively. Consider the cooperative economics movement in all its
manifestations. Throughout the planet, diverse people are recognizing
that their values and interests often are served better by entering into
various types of cooperative economic arrangements. Worker coopera-
tives and micro-credit cooperatives are emerging on the supply side of
the economy in many parts of the world as many previously exploited
artisans, craftspeople, small farmers, and others recognize their com-
mon interests in reducing third-person handling costs while increasing
access to previously inaccessible credit, capital, and markets.36 Likewise,
consumer cooperatives are emerging on the demand side of the economy
as growing numbers of consumers recognize their common interests
in socially responsible volume purchasing.37 Even within traditional
capitalist enterprises, proﬁt-sharing models are gaining prominence as
owners begin to recognize their essential interdependence with workers.

This is not to suggest that the future economy will or should be
modeled solely along the lines of all of these cooperative principles. As
discussed above, market principles that reward hard work, innovation,
and efﬁciency play an important role within a responsibly regulated
economy. The examples above merely illustrate ways that we might
diversify the economy by increasing cooperative activities and relation-
ships within it. Most importantly, they illustrate that economic reform

can be pursued through nonadversarial means—or through a cultural
games approach.

Of course, if the thesis of this article is correct, our primary
challenge is not reforming the free market system but reforming our
legal and political systems so that markets actually can be regulated in
a more just and sustainable manner. It is not the free market, but its
relationship within the larger tripartite system of contests, that is the
primary problem.

Fortunately, nonadversarial approaches to social change also can
be seen in the legal and political spheres. Consider, for instance, the
alternative dispute resolution (ADR) movement. The emergence of ADR
provides an excellent illustration of a nonadversarial approach to social
change. ADR includes a variety of nonadversarial models for resolving
many of the disputes that previously would have been addressed within
the legal adversary system.38

More to the point, however, the success of ADR has not been
achieved by “taking on” the legal adversary system or those whose
interests it serves. Rather, many people simply are abandoning the legal
adversary system and are experimenting with new models that are more
consistent with their own values and interests. This includes not only
disputants but also many lawyers and judges who are recognizing the
excessive ﬁnancial, emotional, and moral costs of the legal adversary
system and its inappropriateness for many kinds of disputes.39 ADR
is literally a new game that is rising in the shadows of the old legal
adversary system that has alienated large numbers of people.

Finally, even in the political sphere, experiments with nonpartisan
electoral and decision-making models are beginning to emerge through
nonadversarial strategies of social change. Granted, most of these exam-
ples are still below the radar of many political observers because
nongovernmental organizations (NGO), rather than states, have taken
the lead in this regard. Yet these emerging models constitute important
sociopolitical experiments which we would do well to monitor and
from which we could learn.

Consider, for instance, the experience of the Bahá’í International
Community. As an NGO, the Bahá’í International Community currently
has over six million members from over 2,000 ethnic backgrounds in
every nation on the planet, representing a microcosm of the entire human
race. The community governs its internal affairs through a system of
democratically elected assemblies that have been established locally,
nationally, and internationally in over 15,000 communities throughout

the planet.40 Signiﬁcantly, in many parts of the world, the ﬁrst exercises
in democratic activity have occurred within the Bahá’í community.

The Bahá’í electoral system is democratic, yet it is entirely non-
partisan and noncompetitive. In brief, all adult community members are
eligible for election, and every member has the reciprocal duty to serve
if elected. At the same time, nominations, campaigning, and all forms of
solicitation are prohibited. Voters thus are guided only by their own
conscience as they exercise complete and real freedom of choice in voting
for those they believe best embody the qualities of recognized ability,
mature experience, and selﬂess service to others. Through a plurality
count, the nine individuals who receive the most votes are called to serve
as members of a decision-making assembly.41 Because no one seeks elec-
tion, elections are a call to service and a sacriﬁce rather than a pathway
to power and privilege. Thus the process is shielded from the material
corruptions to which competitive electoral systems are so susceptible.

All decision-making within these assemblies is, in turn, guided by
consultative principles that make decision-making a unifying rather than
a divisive process. Participants regard diversity as an asset and seek to
inform themselves by soliciting the perspectives, concerns, interests, and
expertise of all segments of the community. They also strive to tran-
scend the limitations of their own egos and perspectives, to express
themselves with care and moderation, to raise the context of decision-
making to the level of principle, and to seek unanimous consensus but
settle for a majority vote when necessary.42

Of most relevance to this discussion, however, is the manner in
which Bahá’ís are implementing this system as part of a larger approach
to social change. Bahá’ís believe that partisan models of governance
have become anachronistic and problematic in an age of increasing
global interdependence. Yet they do not protest or attack existing partisan
systems. On the contrary, Bahá’ís express loyalty and obedience to
whatever governmental systems within which they live, and they exer-
cise their civic responsibilities to vote in those societies that afford the
opportunity to do so. At the same time, Bahá’ís avoid active participa-
tion in partisan politics in order to focus their energy instead on the
construction of an alternative system of democratic governance that
they offer as a model which others can study. As the Bahá’í community
grows in capacity and prominence, its electoral model indeed is attract-
ing the attention of outside observers, such as the United Nations,
which has recognized it as a system that nation states might adapt or
emulate.43

The experience of the cooperative economics movement, the alter-
native dispute resolution movement, and NGOs like the Bahá’í Inter-
national Community provide numerous examples of nonadversarial
approaches to social change. Moreover, experiences such as these pro-
vide naturally occurring experiments that will allow us, over time, to
test the efﬁcacy of the cultural games theory of social change, with its
strategies of construction, attraction, and attrition.

CONCLUSION

If contest models of social organization in their current tripartite
arrangement are unjust and unsustainable and if adversarial strategies
of social change have reached a point of diminishing returns, then
advocates for social justice and environmental sustainability need to
employ new strategies of social change in order to construct new
models of social organization. If the preceding analysis is correct, non-
adversarial strategies of construction, attraction, and attrition may be
the only way to arrive at a peaceful, just, and sustainable social order.

Fortunately, this cultural games hypothesis can be tested. In fact, it
already is being tested, consciously or unconsciously, by increasing num-
bers of people participating in diverse social experiments such as those
referred to above. In the spirit of scientiﬁc inquiry, we would do well to
encourage, observe, and even participate in these experiments in order
to learn from them.

so strong, and the period over which it operated was so extended, that it can
hardly fail to have become embedded to some measure in our genetic makeup.”

29. Cultivation theory suggests that repeated exposure to a consistent and
pervasive set of messages incrementally can inﬂuence human perceptions and
behavior in a collective and cumulative manner. In other words, cultures are
cultivated in part through the “stories” we tend to tell about ourselves. Cultiva-
tion theory also suggests that processes of cultivation reinforce existing cultural
perceptions and behaviors once established. Despite the obvious difﬁculty of
empirically verifying these claims, cultivation analysis has yielded impressive
support for both of these hypotheses. For an excellent overview of cultivation
theory, methodology, and ﬁndings, refer to the edited collection of articles on
