The Kitáb-i-Aqdas: Bahá’í Law, Legitimacy,
and World Order*

Martha L. Schweitz

Abstract
This article is an initial attempt to understand the Kitáb-i-Aqdas from the perspective of
contemporary secular national and international law. First, it analyzes and classifies the
laws and institution-building provisions of the K i t á b - i - A q d a s , demonstrating its
character as a constitution or “Charter” of future world civilization. The social laws are
further analyzed to show how they, together with expressed principles, form the nucleus
for a fully developed legal system. Second, the article investigates the relationship
between law and principle, the “warp and woof” of the institutions of Bahá’u’lláh’s
World Order. How a particular code of laws actually functions in a society depends
heavily on the background of shared principles. Characteristic legal and social
principles are identified, principles which together distinguish the Bahá’í system of law
and government from others. The final section describes current thinking about the
concept of legitimacy and the transformation of international law through human rights
standards from a system that serves only states into one which serves humanity on the
basis of emerging World Order principles.

Résumé
Cet exposé constitue une tentative préliminaire visant à analyser le Kitáb-i-Aqdas du
point de vue du droit séculier national et international. D’abord il analyse et classifie les
lois et les dispositions du Kitáb-i-Aqdas se rapportant à l’établissement d’institutions,
démontrant le caractère constitutif ou de “charte” que revêt le Kitáb-i-Aqdas pour la
civilisation mondiale du futur. Par une analyse approfondie des lois sociales, l’exposé
démontre comment ces lois et les principes énoncés forment le noyau d’un système
juridique pleinement développé. L’exposé examine ensuite le rapport existant entre la
loi, d’une part, et le principe, d’autre part, ces deux éléments constituant en quelque
sorte les fils de chaîne et de trame qui composent l’étoffe des institutions de l’Ordre
mondial de Bahá’u’lláh. La façon dont une société choisit d’appliquer un code de lois
dépend beaucoup des principes que ses membres partagent en commun. L’exposé cerne
des principes juridiques et sociaux qui, pris ensemble, distinguent le système bahá’í de
droit et de gouvernement de tout autre système existant. Enfin, l’exposé décrit les
concepts ayant cours concernant la notion de légitimité, de même que l’impact de
l’adoption de normes relatives aux droits de la personne et la transformation que ces
normes opèrent sur le droit international, qui passe d’un système desservant uniquement.
les États à un système desservant l’humanité en fonction des principes émergents liés à
l’Ordre mondial.

Resumen
Este escrito es un ensayo inicial que busca comprender el Kitáb-i-Aqdas desde la
perspectiva de la ley seglar contemporánea, nacional e internacional. De prímer plano
analisa y clasifica las leyes y medidas edificadoras de instituciones, provenientes del
Aqdas, demostrando su carácter de constitución o Carta de una civilización mundial
futura. Se profundiza el análisis de sus estatutos sociales para indicar cómo, en unión de
sus principios declarados, se forma el núcleo de un sistema legal enteramente
desarrollado. De seguido, la disertación sondea la relación entre lo que es ley y lo que
es principio, o sea, lo que viene a ser el fundamento de las instituciones de la Orden
Mundial de Bahá’u’lláh . La forma en que cierto código de jurisprudencia funciona de
hecho en una sociedad depende fuertemente del trasfondo de principios compartidos
dentro de esa sociedad. Se indentifican principios legales y sociales característicos, que
reunidos distinguen al sistema.bahá’í de ley y goblerno de cualquler otro sistema. La
última parte se dirige al pensamiento de actualidad re f e rente al concepto de la
legitimidad, y la transformación del derecho internacional en aplicación de normas de
derechos humanos, de un sistema sirviente al estado a aquel que sirve a la humanidad
basándose en los principios de una Orden Mundial emergente.

I  n Japan, when one is honored with a formal gift, one receives it with arms

outstretched in front at shoulder height, standing at a respectful distance,
head bowed. This is the image that came to mind upon receiving the recently
published English translation of The Kitáb-i-Aqdas (The Most Holy Book).
Bahá’ís regard The Kitáb-i-Aqdas, written by Bahá’u’lláh in Arabic in about
1873, as the gift of an all-loving yet unknowable Creator. This book reveals the
nucleus of a system of law and government for humanity’s collective maturity
and is intended to organize an evolving global human society on principles of
justice and equity. Bahá’u’lláh has written of The Kitáb-i-Aqdas, “So vast is its
range that it hath encompassed all men ere their recognition of it” (quoted in
Shoghi Effendi, God Passes By 216). Our understanding of The Kitáb-i-Aqdas
can be expected to evolve over the generations; we are now at the stage of
commencing in its study.

I have been asked to speak about The Kitáb-i-Aqdas as a legal system. In the
interests of full disclosure (about which lawyers are always especially
sensitive), it should be explained that my own particular perspective is of one
trained in the common law system, that is, the system evolved from English law
of centuries ago, and more specifically, of one trained in U.S. law. My adopted
home is Japan, a country which follows the civil law tradition, originating with
Roman law and the legal codes of Western and Southern Europe. My academic
passion is international public law.

Thus, my approach is to view The Kitáb-i-Aqdas not in the context of
religious legal systems but from the perspective of contemporary secular law,
national and international. I will address three areas: (1) the classification and
nature of the laws and institutional provisions of The Kitáb-i-Aqdas, (2) the
distinction and relationship between principle and law, and the fundamental

The Kitáb-i-Aqdas: Bahá’í Law, Legitimacy, and World Ord e r                       37

principles on which the system of governance envisioned in The Kitáb-i-Aqdas
depends, and (3) concepts of obedience and legitimacy indicating an emerging
universal sense of moral value. This last part explains how certain notions of
legitimacy in law and government seem to be taking hold in the minds of
diverse peoples and states, and to be slowly generating a still tentative global
consensus. It is an attempt to show how this consensus is not only compatible
with the system of The Kitáb-i-Aqdas but also would appear to be part of the
spiritual process of the maturation of humankind and of building the World
Order envisioned and ordained by Bahá’u’lláh.

To set the proper context, a brief preliminary note is necessary about the
application of the laws of The Kitáb-i-Aqdas. A considerable number of these
laws have been binding on the Bahá’í community for many years now,
particularly the laws regarding prayer and fasting, abstinence from habit-
forming drugs and alcohol, and those relating to marriage and divorce. The law
of H.uqúqu’lláh just came into effect worldwide in 1992 (Universal House of
Justice, Rid.ván 1992 Message to Bahá’ís of the World). Many other laws of The
Kitáb-i-Aqdas, including most of the social laws described later, are not yet in
effect. The 1992 publication of the English translation of The Kitáb-i-Aqdas
does not increase the number of laws currently applied.1

Many of the laws of The Kitáb-i-Aqdas are intended for, in the words of Shoghi
Effendi, a future “state of society destined to emerge from the chaotic conditions
that prevail today . . . ” (Kitáb-i-Aqdas 6, quoting a letter written on behalf of
Shoghi Effendi to a National Spiritual Assembly in 1935). The Bahá’í writings
anticipate a time in the future when the process of human civilization—having
evolved through the successive stages of tribe, city, and nation-state—matures into
a worldwide system of governance, upholding the unity of humankind while
preserving its diversity. Shoghi Effendi has written that “the Spirit breathed by
Bahá’u’lláh upon the world . . . can never permeate and exercise an abiding
influence upon mankind unless and until it incarnates itself in a visible Order,
which would bear His name, wholly identify itself with His principles, and
function in conformity with His laws” (The World Order 19).

When Bahá’u’lláh enunciated his principles of world order over a century
ago, it was much harder than it is now to imagine a process of international
integration. By now we can see how the current anarchic system of sovereign
states is being overtaken by universal needs of humanity; how states and

Members of the Bahá’í community who cannot read Arabic have not been unaware of
the contents of The Kitáb-i-Aqdas. A Synopsis and Codification of the Laws and
Ordinances of The Kitáb-i-Aqdas was published in English by the Universal House of
Justice in 1973, and numerous passages that had previously been translated by Shoghi
Effendi have been published in various compilations of Bahá’u’lláh’s writings and in
collections of Shoghi Effendi’s letters. These are listed in The Kitáb-i-Aqdas 255–57.

peoples are willingly or unwillingly being drawn into ever-increasing global
contact, conflict, and cooperation by the forces of technological progress,
economic systems, and environmental interdependence. We see regional
organizations like the European Community taking three steps forward and two
steps back. We see transnational non-governmental organizations creating bonds
of unity where governments have not. And, from outside the Bahá’í community,
we can see the Bahá’í system as one alternate model for the future organization
of global society. This system is already proving itself at the grassroots level.2

Shoghi Effendi has written that the Law of Bahá’u’lláh “repudiates
excessive centralization . . . and disclaims all attempts at uniformity,” but
“insists upon the subordination of national impulses and interests to the
imperative claims of a unified world” (Shoghi Effendi, The World Order 42).
Bahá’ís are confident that a world order wholly identified with Bahá’u’lláh’s
principles will eventually emerge, through some combination of the visible and
painful failure of the current world system and the active efforts of Bahá’ís and
others of like mind to build a new order.

Classification and Nature of the Laws of The Kitáb-i-Aqdas
As anyone who has read The Kitáb-i-Aqdas will know, it is, as Bahá’u’lláh
states, not “a mere code of laws.” It is not a mere code of laws in form, in
content, nor in purpose or spirit. In Bahá’u’lláh’s words it is the “source of true
felicity” (quoted in Shoghi Effendi, God Passes By 215), the “choice Wine,”
“unsealed . . . with the fingers of might and power . . . ” (Kitáb-i-Aqdas, para.
5). He writes that its commandments are the “lamps of My loving providence
among My servants, and the keys of My mercy for My creatures” (Kitáb-i-
Aqdas, para. 3). Its purposes are to establish order and security among peoples
(Kitáb-i-Aqdas, para. 2), to train humanity in justice (Bahá’u’lláh, “Tablet of
Ishráqát,” in Kitáb-i-Aqdas 91), and to elevate the station of individual souls
(Kitáb-i-Aqdas, para. 45) through divine education, that we may understand and
develop our true spiritual natures.

The form in which The Kitáb-i-Aqdas is written is nothing like the deductive
logic of the typical civil law code or the inductive case-by-case style of the
common law. The legal system to develop over time from the nucleus found in
The Kitáb-i-Aqdas will no doubt require systematization of some kind, but The
Kitáb-i-Aqdas itself is written in an entrancing poetic style. Specific laws and

2. A recent very dramatic example concerns a large number of refugees who fled
from the civil war in Liberia to the Ivory Coast. The group included some 200 Bahá’ís.
They reestablished their community activities, worked together with the villages in the
Ivory Coast, and organized some twenty-five local Spiritual Assemblies. As a result,
through consultation and collective effort, they have established successful small-scale
development projects and are on their way to becoming self-sufficient (Bahá’í
International Community, One Country [Oct.–Dec., 1992]: 1, 12–13).

The Kitáb-i-Aqdas: Bahá’í Law, Legitimacy, and World Ord e r                          39

ordinances are embedded in text glorifying insight and detachment. References
to the “Lamp of the Eternal” and the “Dayspring of Divine knowledge” are
juxtaposed with instructions not to burden an animal with more than it can bear
(K i t á b - i - A q d a s, paras. 186–87). Why is this? Pierre-Yves Mocquais has
described this style as a pattern of ascending circles or a spiral (Mocquais, “The
Kitáb-i-Aqdas,” Second Annual Conference of the Association for Bahá’í
Studies–Japan, Feb. 20–21, 1993, Tokyo). Perhaps, by so intertwining laws and
details about conduct with what we might think of as more “spiritual” passages,
Bahá’u’lláh is visibly demonstrating to us what he says in the first paragraph of
The Kitáb-i-Aqdas: that recognition of him and observance of his ordinances are
inseparable. Perhaps he is reminding us again that his laws are spirit in action,
joining the physical and spiritual realities, to be cherished with the love borne for
him.

From the standpoint of the contents of The Kitáb-i-Aqdas as well as its laws and
institutional provisions, it is not a “mere code of laws.” In legal terminology it
resembles much more closely a constitution. Indeed, Shoghi Effendi, who never
used a word except precisely, refers to it as the “Charter” of the future world
civilization (God Passes By 213). A constitution, of course, holds a unique position
within a legal system, as the “higher law” to which all other laws and the organs of
government themselves must yield. A constitution generally has several basic
functions: it identifies the source of the government’s right to exercise authority
(thereby establishing one form of “legitimacy”); it structures governmental
authority; it distributes and describes the various powers of government; it imposes
certain limits on governmental power; and it ordains methods for adapting to
change. Each of these elements is easily visible in Bahá’u’lláh’s Charter.

In pointing out these elements, we should also recall that The Kitáb-i-Aqdas
is one of several important sources of Bahá’í law; the Will and Testament of
‘Abdu’l-Bahá is another essential source. These two documents are, to quote
Shoghi Effendi, “inseparable parts of one complete unit,” such that they must
both be read in order to understand the institutional aspects of either.3 Reading
these sources together we can see, for example, how authority is structured and
powers allocated to local and national Houses of Justice and to the Universal
House of Justice, and how authority to interpret the Word of Bahá’u’lláh is
conferred successively upon ‘Abdu’l-Bahá and Shoghi Effendi. We can see
further how change is accommodated, through the authority of the Universal
House of Justice to enact supplementary legislation, and the authority of that
same body to amend and repeal its own enactments. Such supplementary
legislation must be wholly consistent with the laws and principles of
Bahá’u’lláh; herein lies the constitutional limitation on governmental power. It is

are the Tablets of Bahá’u’lláh Revealed after The Kitáb-i-Aqdas. Shoghi Effendi describes
these tablets as elucidating and supplementing laws already laid down (Tablets v).

beyond the scope of the present effort to go into detail on these well-known
institutional provisions that find their roots in The Kitáb-i-Aqdas, but perhaps
these examples will suffice.4 In its institutional aspects The Kitáb-i-Aqdas can
readily be understood as a constitution intended to lay the foundation for a
world commonwealth.

If we wish to analyze further the contents of The Kitáb-i-Aqdas, we need a
framework for classifying its laws. The Bahá’í scholar Mírzá Abu’l-Fad. l
divides the laws into three categories (Taherzadeh, Revelation 3: 293–94):

> (1) Devotional laws and ordinances, concerning worship of God (such as
> prayer and fasting). These might also include pilgrimage, Feasts and Holy
> Days, burial laws, and the prohibition on establishing a priesthood or using
> pulpits;
> (2) Laws that benefit primarily the individual, aimed at elevating the
> personal and spiritual condition of the individual (such as standards of
> cleanliness). Perhaps this would also include laws of personal sexual
> morality and all of the exhortations to virtue and good character;
(3) Laws concerning society, to which we will return shortly.

A word is necessary here about the distinction between enforced and
unenforced laws. For many of the laws in The Kitáb-i-Aqdas, individuals are
accountable to God only; that is, society has no authority to impose sanctions for
violating the law. An obvious example is obligatory prayer. This would be true of
most of the laws in Mírzá Abu’l-Fad.l’s first two categories, that is, devotional
laws and laws which benefit primarily the individual. However, for most of the
third category, laws concerning society, individuals are also held accountable to
the society in which they live, by virtue of social institutions having the authority
and responsibility to impose sanctions for proven violations.

How, one may want to know, can there be a law which is obligatory but not
enforced? (International lawyers are asked this question every day, since so few
international norms are enforceable by traditional legal mechanisms like courts
and sheriffs.) The “unenforced” devotional and personal laws binding on
individuals have a purpose that is wholly distinct from enforced social laws.
Their purpose is to purify hearts, to transform spirits. These benefits can only be
realized if individuals follow the laws of their own volition. As Zafar Moghbel
commented recently in Tokyo in discussing the non-coercive nature of
H.uqúqu’lláh, it does not mean much to get to the top of Mt. Fuji if someone pulls
you up there. If such laws were subject to enforcement, their transforming effect
would be annihilated (Moghbel, “On H     . uqúqu’lláh,” Second Annual Conference
of the Association for Bahá’í Studies–Japan, Feb. 20–21, 1993, Tokyo).

4. The Bahá’í Administrative Order is explained in depth by Shoghi Effendi in The
World Order of Bahá’u’lláh, and is described generally in introductory books on the
Bahá’í Faith. See, for example, Hatcher and Martin, The Bahá’í Faith: The Emerging
Global Religion; Huddleston, The Earth is but One Country .

The Kitáb-i-Aqdas: Bahá’í Law, Legitimacy, and World Ord e r                           41

Continuing in the effort to classify the laws of The Kitáb-i-Aqdas, those in
the third category mentioned above (laws concerning society) can be further
classified into the various legal categories known in national systems today. A
brief survey of how this can be done will show that the laws of The Kitáb-i-
Aqdas can be viewed as the seeds for development of various fields of law, or as
constitutional minimum requirements in those fields.

The first category into which the largest portion of the laws would fall is
family law, encompassing engagement, marriage, and divorce. Next might be
criminal law, including all of the references in T h e K i t á b - i - A q d a s to the
following: arson, murder, theft, assault, involuntary manslaughter, non-medical
use of habit-forming substances, gambling, carrying arms, and the prohibition
of slave trading. In the field of wills and estate law, The Kitáb-i-Aqdas sets forth
the obligation to write a will, confirms each person’s unfettered jurisdiction
over disposal of his or her estate (after the payment of debts), and specifies a
detailed system of intestate succession (that is, the rules by which an estate is
distributed in the absence of a valid and enforceable will). In the area of tax law,
The Kitáb-i-Aqdas establishes two very different regimes. One is H.uqúqu’lláh,
which resembles in form a net assets tax, but which is in the nature of a spiritual
obligation and explicitly must not be enforced by society in any way, nor even
individually solicited. The other is Zakát, a future tax on certain categories of
income, details of which have not yet been specified. With respect to the law of
trusts, The Kitáb-i-Aqdas asserts the obligation of the trustee to preserve the
value of the entrusted property, which may be regarded as the fundamental
principle in this field. Regarding property law, the only explicit references seem
to be to the disposition of lost property and treasure trove, but other provisions
relating to inheritance, H.uqúqu’lláh, and Zakát are laden with implications for
the development of a system of private ownership. In the area of procedural law,
we find the criterion for a just witness, that is, that he or she have a good
reputation among the people regardless of faith or creed.5

The purpose of this brief review is to show, with respect to the specific laws
in T h e K i t á b - i - A q d a s, the scope of what topics are and are not expressly
included in comparison to a fully developed contemporary legal system. From
this point of view there are enormous gaps in subject matter. For example, there
are no laws explicitly regarding contract law. We are reminded again that The
K i t á b - i - A q d a s is not a code of laws but a constitution—establishing the
unchangeable foundations of a legal order, and guiding the process and content
of its further development. Any subject that is not addressed in a constitution is
left to the law-making institutions to create and to change as circumstances
require. This process of law making will be largely an effort to extrapolate rules

5. Since various aspects of the laws referred to above are found in multiple scattered
paragraphs of The Kitáb-i-Aqdas, citations have not been given. They can be located
easily through the detailed index.

and procedures from the general principles built into the constitution and legal
system (addressed in the following section). In this example, the most general
level of principles in The Kitáb-i-Aqdas that would be relevant to contract law
might be its exhortations to exhibit virtues such as truthfulness, trustworthiness,
fairness, and courtesy. Surely various systems of contract law could be built in
an attempt to incorporate these multifaceted values. Fairness, variously
interpreted, informs all contemporary contract law systems of “civilized
nations,” which systems are in fact surprisingly similar even though they come
from many different cultures and traditions. But courtesy? Truthfulness? The
standards for implied warranties in sales agreements, or for what constitutes
“good faith” in performing contractual obligations, might well be considerably
higher than they are in most current systems.

Thus, in its fundamental legal character The Kitáb-i-Aqdas would appear to
be constitutional, establishing the institutions, the controlling principles, and the
legal parameters for a universal system of governance. Woven inextricably with
these are the devotional and personal laws essential to individual spiritual
transformation.

Principle and Law
The relationship between principle and law defies any precise explanation, but
it must be addressed in order to show how a legal system differs from a simple
set of rules, such as applies to a game of chess or Monopoly. To view law as a
list of rules is to miss something essential to the nature of law. To view The
Kitáb-i-Aqdas this way would be equally misleading.

Interpreting and applying law is not a science amenable to objective
measurement and mathematical precision. It depends not only on reason and
logic but also on the uniquely human faculties of judgment and intuition. How a
system of laws actually works in a given society is a function of the human
values and social context in which it is embedded. Two nations with very
similar constitutional provisions can have very different legal practices. A well-
known example is criminal procedure in Japan and the United States. The
provisions in the constitutions of the two nations governing the rights of a
criminal defendant are basically the same (compare Kenpo [Constitution] arts.
XXXI–XL [Japan] with U.S. Constitution amend. IV, V, VI, VIII), due to the
fact that the United States essentially wrote Japan’s new constitution following
the Second World War. Nevertheless, the practices that have evolved under
each, and what the two respective court systems have determined to be
constitutional, are not at all the same. In its actual criminal procedure Japan has
not fully abandoned its former inquisitorial system in favor of the adversary
system (Tanaka and Smith, The Japanese Legal System 812). These differences
are generally attributed in turn to the stereotypical individualism and rights
orientation in the United States, and to the stereotypical hierarchy and group

The Kitáb-i-Aqdas: Bahá’í Law, Legitimacy, and World Ord e r                             43

orientation in Japan. The lesson here is that it is impossible to read a code of
laws, much less a constitution, and have a clear vision of how it will work in
society without having considerable information about the context of widely
shared fundamental premises and values.

For another example, in 1896 the U.S. Supreme Court concluded that the
constitutional mandate of “equal protection of the laws”6 permitted racially
segregated schools and public facilities, relying on the pernicious doctrine of
“separate but equal” (Plessy v. Ferguson, 163 U.S. 537 [1896]). As long as
segregated facilities like trains and schools were equal (which in fact they were
not), separating the races did not deprive any person of the equal protection of
the laws. About sixty years later, in 1954, that same Court (still composed of
nine white men) declared unanimously that separate educational facilities for
children of different races are inherently unequal and do permanent damage to
the self-esteem of children of the minority race (Brown v. Board of Education,
347 U.S. 483 [1954]). The Court held that to segregate schools racially is
unconstitutional, thereby initiating the long legal and social struggle to integrate
American public schools. In the two cases the Supreme Court was interpreting
the same phrase in the Constitution, trying to be faithful to the intent of its
framers, but in radically different eras of U.S. history, informed by different
human values and principles.

The principles that find their way into legislation or court decisions are
generally those which happen to be associated with powerful social groups,
whose interests are in fact represented in government. This often does not bode
well for the rest of humanity. The beauty of the embryonic system of The Kitáb-
i-Aqdas is that the principles which set the context for its further development,
interpretation, and application are explicit, and often elaborated in considerable
detail in The Kitáb-i-Aqdas and in other Bahá’í writings. The underpinnings of
the system are not left to chance. These principles are universal, comprehensive,
and immutable. Shoghi Effendi makes a point of distinguishing laws from
principles and states that both together “constitute the warp and woof of the
institutions upon which the structure of [Bahá’u’lláh’s] World Order must
ultimately rest” (The World Order 199). The Kitáb-i-Aqdas and other Bahá’í
writings are replete with principles relevant to the evolution of a system of law
and governance, from the highly specific to the broad and all-encompassing. A
few examples follow.

At the most specific level, The Kitáb-i-Aqdas appears to incorporate some of
the most basic of the “general principles of law recognized by civilized
nations,” the term used in the Statute of the International Court of Justice (59
Stat. 1055, T.S. No. 993, 3 Bevans 1179, art. 38[1][c]). For example, the
principle of proportionality, that penalties of any sort depend on the degree of

6. “No State shall . . . deny to any person . . . the equal protection of the laws” (U.S.
Constitution amend. XIV).

44         THE JOURNAL OF BAHÁ’Í STUDIES                                   6.1.1994

the misconduct, appears in the reference in The Kitáb-i-Aqdas to the penalties for
assault.7 Another example concerns the closely related doctrines of excuse and
justification, i.e., “I did the prohibited act (or failed to perform an obligation) but
for a certain good reason, so I should not be found guilty or held liable.”
Accordingly, The Kitáb-i-Aqdas generally forbids carrying arms (para. 159), yet
self-defense is justified (note 173). The doctrine of excuse is also incorporated in
the provisions stating that someone who falls short of certain standards of
cleanliness “with good reason shall incur no blame” (para. 74), and in allowing that
people with insufficient means to renew the furnishings of their homes at regular
intervals “hath been excused” (para. 151). A final example of a specific legal
principle is the mens rea concept in criminal law, which requires that for most
crimes the defendant must have had a certain level of intent to commit the criminal
act. The Kitáb-i-Aqdas incorporates this requirement when it distinguishes between
“deliberately” and “unintentionally” taking another’s life, i.e., between murder and
involuntary manslaughter (paras. 62, 188), and in prescribing criminal penalties for
the “intentional” destruction of a house by fire (para. 62).

Moving to a more general level of principles, there is the pervasive notion of
the unity of science and religion. The legal system envisioned in The Kitáb-i-
Aqdas cannot be expected to evolve in some kind of ethereal vacuum removed
and apart from the rich variety of existing legal traditions and experience from
around the world. The Kitáb-i-Aqdas states that the Creator has “assigned to
every end a means for its accomplishment” (para. 160), has enjoined the people
to resort to competent physicians when ill (para. 113), has confirmed the use of
“material means” (para. 113), and has counselled his followers to study sciences
which further the progress and advancement of society (note 110). As the legal
system of The Ki t á b - i - A q d a s is further developed, the responsible Bahá’í
institutions will be able to draw upon the collective legal experience of many
generations in a wide variety of cultures.

A panoply of other principles of Bahá’u’lláh, many of them enumerated in
The Kitáb-i-Aqdas itself, will have a direct bearing on the process of building
world order and on what can be considered “constitutional” in the Bahá’í legal
system. To mention just a few: Authority is to be exercised by elected
institutions free of the corruption of campaigning, institutions whose individual
members have no separate authority whatsoever. Decisions are made by a
specified process of group consultation, striving for unanimity but accepting a
majority vote (para. 30 & note 52). Violence, force, and constraint are
condemned (note 170), the Islamic law of holy war is abrogated, and fellowship
with the followers of all religions is enjoined (note 173). Governments are
besought to expend resources for the good of the people instead of for
armaments, and a system of international collective security is envisioned in

7. “The penalties for wounding or striking a person depend upon the severity of the
injury . . .” (Bahá’u’lláh, Kitáb-i-Aqdas, para. 56).

which “force is made the servant of Justice” (note 173). Oppressive, tyrannical,
and unjust rulers are condemned and the reins of power are to fall into the hands
of the people (paras. 88, 89, 93).

Both transcending and permeating the system as a whole is the principle of
the unity of humankind. We are “all the leaves of one tree and the drops of one
ocean” (Bahá’u’lláh, Tablet of Ishráqát, in Tablets of Bahá’u’lláh 129). “It is
not for him to pride himself who loveth his own country, but rather for him who
loveth the whole world” (Bahá’u’lláh, Lawh.-i-Maqs. úd, in Tablets 167). The
implications of this principle of unity in creating a legal system go far beyond,
and may prove to have a fundamentally different character from, the meager
standards of “equal protection of the laws” known in present-day constitutions.
The latter are designed simply to prohibit governments (not people) from
discriminating on the basis of race or certain other inborn human characteristics.
The possibility of designing a legal system intended to promote unity and value
diversity excites and challenges the legal imagination.

Throughout Bahá’u’lláh’s writings are references to the preeminence of the
principle of justice. He has even named the primary institutions of his World
Order “Houses of Justice.” Bahá’í scholars are now only beginning to study
seriously these many passages and to relate them to secular legal philosophy,
and no attempt will be made to do so here, but one meaning must be mentioned
briefly. Bahá’u’lláh writes in The Hidden Words:

> The best beloved of all things in My sight is Justice; . . . . By its aid thou shalt see
> with thine own eyes and not through the eyes of others, and shalt know of thine own
> knowledge and not through the knowledge of thy neighbor. . . . Verily justice is My
> gift to thee and the sign of My loving-kindness. (3–4)

He writes further, in the Words of Wisdom, “The essence of all that We have
revealed for thee is Justice, is for man to free himself from idle fancy and
imitation, discern with the eye of oneness His glorious handiwork, and look into
all things with a searching eye” (Bahá’u’lláh, As. l-i-Kullu’l-Khayr [Words of
Wisdom], in Tablets 157). It seems from these two passages that one aspect of
justice is seeing with pure vision: judging and evaluating claims with an eye
free of preconceived notions, prejudgment, and prejudice, free from all of the
conditioning we are subject to simply by virtue of the place and time in which
we happen to be born.8 One cannot read The Kitáb-i-Aqdas without sensing the
need to move beyond such limitations.

One example of how our conditioning affects our reading of The Kitáb-i-
Aqdas relates to the law of “dowry,” as it appears in the English translation. A

8. Living in Japan I have become acutely aware of how profound and pervasive such
conditioning is, as I try to understand the thoughts and behavior of people who have
grown up with very different mental maps about almost everything.

46          THE JOURNAL OF BAHÁ’Í STUDIES                                     6.1.1994

typical Western response to the notion of dowry is likely to be anything but
openminded. This practice is closely associated in some minds with bride
burnings and all sorts of abuse of women. But those who can release themselves
from such Pavlovian responses can perhaps begin to “see with their own eyes.”
The dowry, of course, is a practice in many diverse cultures and takes many
forms. Bahá’u’lláh has redefined the dowry as a gift from the groom to the
bride. It is not a gift from the bride’s family to the groom, the sort of dowry
which in some places has been associated with the atrocity of bride burnings.
Nor is it a gift from the groom to the bride’s parents, the sort of dowry referred
to as a “bride price,” which carries disturbing implications of the wife’s
becoming the husband’s property. The dowry ordained in The Kitáb-i-Aqdas is a
gift from the groom to the bride herself, the amount of which is measured by the
value of stated quantities of gold or silver, and payment of which can be
deferred if financially necessary (Kitáb-i-Aqdas, para. 66 & notes 93–94). This
dowry can range from a little over two troy ounces of silver to about eleven troy
ounces of gold. It seems not entirely unlike the Western custom of engagement
and wedding rings. Often the amount of a dowry, or the size of the diamond in
an engagement ring, have been converted into status symbols, flaunting the
wealth of the groom. The dowry as stipulated in The Kitáb-i-Aqdas is protected
from this abuse, however, by the fact that a maximum amount is specified
(approximately eleven troy ounces of gold) and by Bahá’u’lláh’s words that it is
better for a man to content himself with payment of the minimum amount (para.
66 & note 95). He then adds (lest we again succumb to the tendency to become
preoccupied with rules and forget the spirit?) that God “enricheth whomsoever
He willeth through both heavenly and earthly means, and He, in truth, hath
power over all things” (para. 66).

Those who aspire to be world citizens need to understand other peoples and
to open their minds to others’ experience. Studying The Kitáb-i-Aqdas gives
one no choice but to engage in that process. Laws that seem perfectly
understandable to one people may seem very strange to another. On the one
hand, we read that confession to and seeking absolution of one’s sins from
another person is prohibited (para. 34 & note 58). In the West we are familiar
with the Catholic practice of confession to priests. On the other hand, we read
that Bahá’u’lláh has abolished the concept of ritual uncleanliness of certain
things and people (para. 75 & notes 20, 103, 106) and that sable fur and bones
do not invalidate our prayers. 9 That we wonder about, except for the most
educated among us, because we cannot imagine what fur and bones could have
to do with prayer. Others might wonder why a person would ever feel
compelled to seek forgiveness from someone they never harmed. Bahá’u’lláh is

9. Kitáb-i-Aqdas, para. 9. As explained in The Kitáb-i-Aqdas, note 12, in some earlier
religious beliefs, wearing the fur of sable or certain other animals, or having certain
objects like bones on one’s person, was held to invalidate one’s prayer.

relentlessly challenging aspiring world citizens to rise above ourselves and our
own particular variant of the human condition. Those who have seen this
horizon find it impossible to go back to the narrow thinking of the past.

The final issue to be addressed concerning the relationship between law and
principle is the subject of women in The Kitáb-i-Aqdas. It also relates directly to
this requirement of justice that we purify our vision, or, in Bahá’u’lláh’s words
to a “true seeker”: “He must so cleanse his heart that no remnant of either love
or hate may linger therein, lest that love blindly incline him to error, or that hate
repel him away from the truth” (Bahá’u’lláh, Kitáb-i-Íqán 192). For some it
may be difficult to understand why there are a handful of distinctions in
Bahá’u’lláh’s laws between men and women, while it is also clear from the
Writings that the spiritual and social equality of men and women is one of
Bahá’u’lláh’s most fundamental principles. In The Kitáb-i-Aqdas there are
exemptions for women from certain obligations related to prayer, fasting, and
pilgrimage (optional exemptions only, not prohibitions [note 20]), some
differences between male and female relatives in inheritance if there is no valid
will, eligibility for election to the Universal House of Justice, and a few
distinctions related to marriage.

Many of us (including this writer) have been conditioned by our experience
to see any distinction in treatment between men and women as a badge of
female inferiority. We have ample reason to think this way, since in the societies
in which we live it has almost always been true. These societies are permeated
with the psychology and practice of paternalism and male domination. Both
men and women are victims of this thinking, until we consciously strive to
change it in ourselves. In struggling against these social patterns, we often find
that we come to hate the ingrained attitudes that perpetuate sexual inequality.
This feeling, along with the fear that this abhorrent system will continue, may
be the sort of hatred which can “repel us away from the truth” and interfere with
understanding the gender-based distinctions in The Kitáb-i-Aqdas. A brief
digression may be useful to explain this.

Within the constitutional concept of “equal protection of the laws”
mentioned earlier, groups of people may be classified based on some
characteristic and may be treated differently under the law only if that
classification is rationally related to a legitimate government interest. For
example, it is constitutional to require, in the interests of safety, that people be
of a certain age to get a driver ’s license; it would not be constitutional to require
that they have blue eyes. In U.S. constitutional law, if the classification itself is
“suspect”—that is, based on race or national origin—then the government has a
heavier burden of proof and must show that such classification is not just
rational but is “necessary” to a “compelling” government interest. Because it is
virtually impossible to satisfy this burden, laws that make distinctions based on
race or national origin have been repeatedly struck down by U.S. courts as
unconstitutional. In current U.S. practice, the burden of proof that must be met

48           THE JOURNAL OF BAHÁ’Í STUDIES                                   6.1.1994

in order to uphold laws making distinctions based on gender is lighter than in
race cases but heavier than the simple test of “rationally related.”10

If one were to describe the gender-related provisions of The Kitáb-i-Aqdas in
the language of constitutional law, it could be said, first, that Bahá’u’lláh has
constitutionally guaranteed the equality of the sexes and, second, that
Bahá’u’lláh has also determined that the limited distinctions between men and
women in The Kitáb-i-Aqdas are necessary to an important spiritual and/or
social purpose. Unlike the United States government, however, Bahá’u’lláh has
no duty to prove to Bahá’ís the necessity for such distinctions, though
individuals may discern reasons for themselves. In law, equality and distinction
are not necessarily mutually exclusive. Equality is anything but a simple
concept and has been the subject of extensive and fascinating philosophical
thought. The result of efforts to understand these provisions in The Kitáb-i-
Aqdas may hopefully be a deeper understanding of the meaning of gender
equality in the Bahá’í writings.

Turning again to the social context in which laws are applied, it must be
recalled that the future society envisioned is one in which women are
participating “fully and equally in the affairs of the world” (‘Abdu’l-Bahá,
Promulgation 135), as the “peers of men” (Promulgation 375). ‘Abdu’l-Bahá
has written that when this occurs, “when women . . . enter confidently and
capably the great arena of laws and politics, war will cease; . . .” (Promulgation
135). He refers to the gender distinctions in the Writings as “negligible”
(Bahá’u’lláh, Kitáb-i-Aqdas 7). The Universal House of Justice has written:

> The denial of such equality [between the sexes] perpetrates an injustice against one
> half of the world’s population and promotes in men harmful attitudes and habits that
> are carried from the family to the workplace, to political life, and ultimately to
> international relations. There are no grounds, moral, practical, or biological, upon
> which such denial can be justified.11

Whatever the spiritual and/or social purposes of the few gender distinctions in
Bahá’í law, they apparently are fully consistent with the evolution of a society
in which women and men are equally accomplished in civic life; and with the
wide spectrum of possible implications this condition holds for education and
family life.

Laws cannot be divorced from principles any more than a tree can be
severed from its roots. A legal system resembles a living organism much more
closely than it does a game of chess. Rational people will naturally have
different views in specific cases on how a principle may be applied to draft or
interpret a law. This is largely what comprises the legislative process and
jurisprudence, respectively. For example, if a group undertakes to draft a law to
protect clean water supplies, assuming further that the members first have
reached substantial agreement on the principle that “the polluter pays,” what
mechanisms should they include in the law for testing the water, investigating
industrial plants, and assessing liability? How intrusive the investigation and
how extensive the liability? Additional principles must be articulated to resolve
these questions. Or, when a court is required to interpret the “free speech”
provision of some constitution and endeavors to balance the principles of
freedom of the press and individual privacy, how do the judges decide whether
the press went too far in publishing details of Ms. Doe’s financial affairs? On
any of these issues rational people, applying the same basic principles, will
differ, usually coming up with a variety of plausible conclusions.

Such a variety of opinion also is essential to the process of Bahá’í
consultation and institutional decision-making. But since Bahá’í consultation is
built on the substantive principles expressed in the Bahá’í writings—principles
which are explicit, comprehensive, and universal—this diversity of opinion will
be focused and, indeed, “principled,” not the rancorous, self-serving sort that
inevitably leads to fracturing and fragmentation. The hope and promise of
Bahá’u’lláh’s law is that such principled diversity of opinion can be used
constructively to build the most just system that divine guidance operating on
human intelligence and spirit can produce.

Obedience and Legitimacy
The third and last theme relates to current thinking in international law about
concepts of obedience to law and legitimacy of legal systems. The
developments that certain international law scholars are now describing and
analyzing would appear, from a Bahá’í perspective, to be early steps in the
maturation of humankind and in the building of the World Order envisioned and
ordained in The Kitáb-i-Aqdas.

We begin with the question Why do people obey laws? This is a favorite
question to ask students in international law classes. Usually the first response is
Because I’ll be arrested if I don’t obey, in other words, because of the police
power of the state and judicial enforcement of the laws. But then getting more
specific, when asked why they don’t commit a robbery or attack someone, a
student responds, “I would never do that, even if I were sure of not getting
caught.” Why? “Because it’s wrong.” Ah, it’s wrong. So some laws we obey
because they coincide with our values. What about red lights? Students

50           THE JOURNAL OF BAHÁ’Í STUDIES                                         6.1.1994

generally seem to agree that going on green and stopping on red is not a moral
issue (except to the extent that they place a moral value on the principle of
obedience to law in general). Rather, they see the practical utility of stoplights at
intersections to prevent accidents, i.e., to create order.

It becomes apparent that the reasons we obey laws vary, depending on the
law. What about pollution control regulations? Enforcement is probably essential
there. What about income tax law? About this time a student usually says, Well, I
don’t agree with all of the tax law, but I know the government needs to tax
people and this is the law that Congress passed, so I follow it. But I don’t like it.
The student is now beginning to understand the multifaceted concept of
legitimacy: that laws are often obeyed not because of the likelihood of
enforcement nor because they are wholly accepted as morally correct, but rather
because they are viewed as “legitimate” by those to whom they are addressed.

What is “legitimacy”? As the term is used by Thomas Franck, it is the
capacity of a law or rule to exert a pull to compliance, instilling in people the
sense of a non-coerced obligation to obey.12 The stronger this pull to compliance
(i.e., the stronger the legitimacy of the rule), the greater any countervailing force
will have to be to induce disobedience. Jürgen Habermas writes:

> Legitimacy means that there are good arguments for a political order’s claim to be
> recognized as right and just; a legitimate order deserves recognition. . . .
> [L]egitimacy is a contestable validity claim; . . . [H]istorically as well as analytically,
> the concept is used above all in situations in which the legitimacy of an order is
> disputed . . . . This is a process.13

The central question here is, What are these “good arguments” for a political
order’s claim to be recognized? Or, in Franck’s terminology, What is it about a
law or rule that gives it this capacity to exert a pull to compliance? In national
legal systems, where enforcement is always lurking, it is often difficult to
isolate the non-coercive factors that induce obedience. That is why it is
particularly interesting and useful to study these factors in the context of
international law, where enforcement mechanisms are generally lacking.
Franck begins with the notion that we should not be surprised that states violate
international law; we should rather be surprised that (in Louis Henkin’s famous

International Law.

13. Habermas, Communication and the Evolution of Society 178–79 (emphasis in
original). Note that in the above passages Franck is addressing the legitimacy of a law or
rule, Habermas the legitimacy of a political order as a whole. These two questions,
though distinct, are tightly connected. For present limited purposes, little will be made of
this distinction.

phrase) “most states follow most of the rules most of the time,” and we should
try to find out why.

Two ideas are often intertwined. One is legitimacy of a law or rule based on
its source; the other is legitimacy based on the content or nature of the law or
rule itself, independent of its source.14 Although in practical terms the two are
mutually reinforcing, they are also analytically and functionally distinct.
Separating the two clarifies matters considerably.

In the first case, which will be referred to here as “source legitimacy,” the
qualities of legitimacy adhere to the authority issuing the law or rule, and to the
characteristic process through which such authority issues laws. In the pure
case, the legitimacy of the issuing authority is claimed to be sufficient alone to
generate a sense of obligation to comply. Parents try to invoke this sort of
legitimacy regularly, every time a child asks Why do I have to do that? and the
parent responds Because I said so! In the legal context, this issue merges into
the fundamental and recurring question in legal philosophy, which is, What is
law, and where does it come from? On the one hand, theories of natural law,
which have been around for centuries, posit that law is either of divine origin or
can be discerned by powers of reason from the inescapable nature of the human
condition. On the other hand, the theory of positivism, developed by John
Austin in the 19th century and elaborated with more sophistication in this
century by H. L. A. Hart, maintains essentially that law is what a sovereign says
it is; law is a command of the sovereign backed up by force (Hart, Concept of
Law). It is clear, then, why positivists say that international law is not law at
all.15 This approach also leads to the conclusion that there is no necessary
connection whatsoever between law and morality.16

In explaining legitimacy, the point is that if the authority or sovereign (divine
or temporal) which issues a rule is accepted as legitimate, i.e., if a rule comes

14. Franck, “Legitimacy in the International System” 705, n. 10. See Franck, Power
of Legitimacy 17–18, for an overview of three categories of legitimation theory: Max
Weber’s specific process approach, Habermas’s procedural–substantive theory, and the
neo-Marxist approach based principally on outcomes. To focus instead on the distinction
between source (which would include many considerations of process) and content
(which would include the nature of the outcome) cuts within and across these categories
and may prove useful in explaining attitudes and behavior in response to law.

15. “[T]he law obtaining between nations is law (improperly so called) set by general
opinion. The duties which it imposes are enforced by moral sanctions: . . . by fear on the
part of sovereigns, of provoking general hostility . . . ” (Austin, P rovince of
Jurisprudence Determined 208).

16. At the Association for Bahá’í Studies Conference in 1982, Judges James and
Dorothy Nelson presented a comprehensive and insightful paper entitled, “Natural Law
Revisited,” which explains these theories in greater detail and suggests how the Bahá’í
system of law has the potential to bring together various secular and theological schools of
natural law theory. (Audiotape available from the Association for Bahá’í Studies, Ottawa.)

52          THE JOURNAL OF BAHÁ’Í STUDIES                                    6.1.1994

into being in compliance with secondary rules about how and by whom rules
are to be made and interpreted (whether as “natural” or “positive” law), then the
rule has a strong claim to be regarded as legitimate. In the international system,
for example, in the absence of a rule-issuing sovereign, we can substitute the
recognized sources of international law, that is, treaties and the customary
practices of states. If an international norm comes into being through such
recognized processes (so-called secondary rules of norm creation), it will have a
strong claim to legitimacy. This is “source legitimacy” and is apparent in two of
Franck’s factors of legitimation.17

The other very different type of argument is that legitimacy of a law or rule
is based on its nature or content. Qualities of legitimacy inhere in the law or rule
itself, analytically independent of its source. This will be referred to as “content
l e g i t i m a c y.” Franck’s two other legitimizing factors belong here. One is
“coherence”: “Rules, to be perceived as legitimate, must emanate from
principles of general application” (Franck, Power of Legitimacy 1 5 2 ) .
Exceptions to rules are of course possible, but they must be capable of
principled justification. The other factor he calls “determinacy,” which relates to
the degree of clarity of a rule or of mechanisms to interpret and apply it
(Franck, Power of Legitimacy 50–66). Neither of these factors has much to do
with the source of the rule or the process by which it has come into being.

At this point, one might wonder What happened to justice? People may
disagree about notions of justice, but if a rule is widely perceived to be just,
won’t this be a factor exerting a pull to compliance? Ronald Dworkin, the well-
known contemporary legal philosopher, writes that habitual obedience (to
national legal systems) can be secured only if the quality of governance exhibits
characteristics he identifies as fairness, justice, and integrity (Dworkin, Law’s
E m p i re 176–224). These would, again, be aspects of content legitimacy.
Nevertheless, Franck goes to great lengths to distinguish legitimacy from justice
in the international context and to show why Rawlsian notions of justice cannot
apply to an international community composed of states (Franck, Power of
Legitimacy 208–46). He acknowledges that both legitimacy and justice exert a
pull to compliance but for very different reasons. He believes that the two
concepts have no necessary relationship to each other and that the international
community—a highly morally diverse community—is better served at this stage
by keeping them separate. The beauty of the concept of international legitimacy,
he argues, is that it suggests the emergence of an orderly international
community functioning by consent and validated obligation rather than by
coercion. Moreover, this order can be increased by deliberate steps to strengthen
the legitimacy of international rules and institutions without the need for a

17. Franck, with infinitely greater precision, identifies two aspects of source
legitimacy, which he calls “symbolic validation, ritual and pedigree” and “adherence to a
normative hierarchy” (Franck, Power of Legitimacy 91–110, 183–94).

universally agreed morality or standard of justice (Franck, Power of Legitimacy
710–11). He maintains that an international order cannot yet be based on a
common moral foundation of justice:

> The evolution of a system of global justice, therefore, must await, and go hand in
> hand with, the system’s transformation from one based on states to one based on the
> primacy of world government and global citizenship. Universal individual rights
> may be an historic imperative whose day will come; but it is not yet fully upon us.18

Franck is anticipating here a possible future in which global justice is linked
with universal human rights and global citizenship. This approaches the vision
of world order in T h e K i t á b - i - A q d a s and is a hopeful but nevertheless
imaginable outcome of the transformation that is now occurring in international
law and society.

Modern international law has grown up out of the consistent practices of
states in their relations with one another. What began as customs, primarily
among the rulers of the states of Western Europe, gradually became widely
accepted as standards of law and has grown into the extensive body of
international customary and treaty law we have today.19 From the beginning of
this process, the most fundamental principle has been the sovereignty of each
state, that is, that a state has complete freedom of action in international law to
deal with its own territory, with its own nationals, to enter into legal
relationships with other states, and even (until this century) to wage a war of
aggression. Thus, it is traditionally stated that international law can only be
created by the consent of states and that states are the only s u b j e c t s o f
international law: that is, the legal entities for which international law creates
rights and upon which it imposes duties. A corollary of this is that international
law can only deal with topics of international concern, never with matters of
domestic jurisdiction.

18. Franck, Power of Legitimacy 233. Franck has been criticized in some quarters,
however, for trying to divorce his factors of legitimacy so completely from notions of
contextual justice. His factors often do, in fact, depend for their operation at least in part
on some minimum satisfaction of the perceived demands of justice. See Koskenniemi,
Book Review of Franck, The Power of Legitimacy Among Nations 175–78.

19. This is not to imply that the model of European state relations has been accepted
worldwide without question or change. In particular, newer states, which did not exist in
the earlier stages of the development of international law and therefore had no role in its
formation, have challenged the validity of the system as a whole. (This can easily be
understood as an issue of source legitimacy as discussed above.) Many points of
international customary law are not settled because of the persistent lack of agreement
among states with diverse political–economic systems and legal traditions. For an
overview of issues and viewpoints, see Snyder and Sathirathai, eds., Third World
Attitudes toward International Law.

The development that is profoundly altering some of these basic
assumptions in the structure of international law is the emergence of
international human rights law. Until the Second World War, there was very
little human rights law that could be called “international.” It concerned
primarily the treatment of civilians and prisoners in time of war, and the
treatment by a government of nationals of a foreign state.20 But international
law could not recognize, because of the doctrine of national sovereignty, the
right of any individual against any state, one’s own or another. The positivist
theory was in ascendance, and how a state treated its own citizens was purely a
matter of domestic jurisdiction, governed by a state’s own laws (Sieghart,
International Law of Human Rights 13–14).

Then the world witnessed the atrocities committed by Nazi Germany, many
of which were completely legal under German law, enacted by a legislature
lawfully installed under the constitution of a sovereign state. The strict
application of legal positivism gave way before the conviction that what
happened in Germany (and in some other parts of the world) was immoral and
that the community of nations must never permit it to happen again. The United
Nations Charter was written to include as one of its purposes the promotion of
human rights and fundamental freedoms “without distinction as to race, sex,
language, or religion”21 and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights was
adopted in 1948. 2 2 Since then a series of multilateral treaties have been
concluded, committing states to protecting a wide range of rights.23 Most of
these treaties are long on listing rights and short on implementation methods.
(The notable exception is the European Convention,24 which creates an effective

Assembly on Dec. 10, 1948. Forty-eight states voted in favor, none against, and eight
abstained.

23. Two of the most comprehensive are the International Covenant on Civil and
Political Rights (999 U.N.T.S. 171, e n t e red into forc e M a r. 23, 1976) and the
International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (993 U.N.T.S. 3,
entered into force Jan. 3, 1976). Other examples include the International Convention on
the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination (660 U.N.T.S. 195, entered into
force Jan. 4, 1969) and the Convention in the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination
against Women (G. A. Res. 180 (XXXIV 1979), entered into force Sept. 3, 1981,
reprinted in International Legal Materials 19 (1980): 33–45.

24. European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental
Freedoms, 312 U.N.T.S. 221, E.T.S. 5, entered into force Sept. 3, 1953 and subsequently
amended by Protocols Nos. 3, 5, and 8.

European Court of Human Rights and in some cases gives individuals the right
to sue.) But these treaties have nonetheless promoted substantial change in the
practices of many states, through reporting procedures and other non-coercive
means that mobilize international opinion. Moreover, even for states that have
not signed these treaties, certain basic human rights have come to be widely
regarded as a part of customary international law binding on all states.

Something profound has happened here. A state is now considered
accountable to the international community, under international law, for how it
treats its own nationals. It can no longer be maintained that a government’s
treatment of its own citizens is a matter of purely domestic jurisdiction. How
can this be? It is true that egregious violations of human rights (like genocide in
Cambodia) often become transnational problems, due to the flight of refugees or
civil violence that spills into neighboring countries. But international human
rights law is not limited to such cases. It is in fact reaching behind the legal
fiction of the state to protect people from their own governments. This is a
radical departure not only from the amoral doctrine of legal positivism but also
from the original precept on which international law has been built: unfettered
state sovereignty. States are no longer the only subjects of international law.
International human rights law puts the fundamental interests of human beings
above the prerogatives of state governments. And, as some noted international
law scholars such as Fernando Tesón are beginning to argue, it is laying the
foundation for a universal morality, for universally accepted principles of
justice. Human rights, it is argued, and not the rights of states, are emerging as
the ethical foundation of international law and as the basis of any defensible
moral theory of international law and relations (Tesón, “Realism and
Kantianism” 118).

This is not just the hopeful theorizing of academic writers. What they are
describing is a process and way of thinking that seems to be taking hold in the
minds and actions of diverse peoples and states, related in part to the so-called
global democratic revolution. An expectation is emerging among the community
of states that a government seeking the validation of its empowerment must
govern with the consent of the governed. 25 In other words, returning here to our
theme, governments and laws that do not respect fundamental human rights are
not legitimate, based on an analysis of their content rather than their source. State
governments and their laws are increasingly judged by the community of nations
against a minimal standard of justice embodied in the most widely accepted
portions of international human rights law.26

26. The term “international human rights law” encompasses all of the treaties and
customary law on the subject, some of which have only been accepted by and apply to a
limited number of states. What is referred to here as the basis of an emerging universal
standard of justice is the still somewhat amorphous core of rights which have received

56          THE JOURNAL OF BAHÁ’Í STUDIES                                      6.1.1994

Where do these standards come from? It has been said that when the
industrial and scientific revolutions killed God they left a God-sized hole.
Secular philosophers have labored diligently to identify a moral basis for human
dignity (and thus for identifying human rights) that does not depend on the
unique attribute of possessing a soul, and they have largely succeeded to the
satisfaction of the international secular community. The ethics of Immanuel
Kant, for example, are often viewed as an attempt to pursue Christianity by
secular means. He identified the human capacity for rational choice as the
attribute that makes humans autonomous and thus entitled to special moral
protection.27 As long as the international community does not try to look too
closely at its reasons for upholding certain human rights—which reasons are
likely to be diverse and inconsistent—it seems for the moment to be able to
sustain consensus on some basic rights and the commitment to protect them.
The most apparent risk to this process stems from the fact that the international
community is so unevenly developed, in this moral dimension as well as
economically and politically. The potential for disaster is obvious daily. One
must look more deeply than to the nightly news to find the more hopeful signs.

To conclude, we can discern a process now of order in global
political–economic life gradually increasing, in fits and starts, evidenced by a
growing array of rules binding on states. To the extent that these rules are
accepted as binding by those states it is because they are perceived to be
legitimate, by virtue of some combination of their source and content, but in
the support of almost all states and are considered binding on all.

The extent of international consensus on human rights should not be exaggerated. It
is neither complete nor secure, nor does it always result in action to protect people.
Much of international human rights law, like the rest of international law, has developed
in the context of modern Western thinking. Discussion and debate continue on questions
of individual vs. group rights, civil–political rights as distinct from economic rights, and
the degree to which (let alone methods by which) a state is accountable to the
international community for allegedly violating human rights.

Despite all this, it is evident that the notion of fundamental human rights has entered
the arena of international political life and has become an inescapable part of any
discussion of the merits and legitimacy of any particular government or social system. It
is becoming increasingly difficult and fundamentally impractical for state governments
to ignore them blatantly. Indications are that this process will only continue to grow.
Whether or how quickly this global discussion will produce a useful working consensus
specific enough to protect a broad spectrum of rights effectively, remains to be seen. See
generally Sieghart, International Law; Meron, ed., Human Rights in International Law;
Lillich, International Human Rights. For a range of non-Western views and experience,
see the articles collected in Snyder and Sathirathai, eds., Third World Attitudes, Part IV.

27. Murphy and Coleman, Philosophy of Law 78–79. Rational beings exist as ends in
themselves, not merely as the means to an end. They cannot be replaced because they
have no equivalent and therefore possess “dignity” (Kant, Foundations of the
Metaphysics of Morals, reprinted in The Essential Kant 295–360).

many cases still making no necessary or strong claim to justice or morality. We
may also be able to discern the early stages of a succeeding step, the first
inklings of a universal set of principles of justice, as yet scantily defined but
visible in notions of human rights to the extent that they are now generally
accepted. It is the claim of Bahá’u’lláh that the laws, principles, and institutions
ordained in The Kitáb-i-Aqdas and his other Writings show the way to the
further development of such universal principles of justice. It is Bahá’u’lláh’s
claim that only through the unity engendered by implementation of such
principles will the future well-being of humankind be ensured, can civilization
advance, and individuals and communities develop their full potential. Those
who have accepted Bahá’u’lláh’s claim see in the present chaos both the death
of an old outworn world order and the glimmerings of the birth of the new, the
traumatic adolescence of humankind.

For Bahá’ís, the legitimacy of The Kitáb-i-Aqdas, the strength of its claim to
be obeyed and implemented, rests first on its Source. Those who recognize
Bahá’u’lláh as the Lord of the Age observe his commandments “for the love of
[His] beauty” (Kitáb-i-Aqdas, para. 4). “Whatsoever He, the Well-Beloved,
ordaineth, the same is, verily, beloved” (para. 7). Recognition of Bahá’u’lláh
and observance of his every ordinance are inseparable twin duties (para. 1). For
them, also, the principles and laws of The Kitáb-i-Aqdas become the standard
against which to evaluate all other claims: “Weigh not the Book of God with
such standards and sciences as are current amongst you, for the Book itself is
the unerring Balance established amongst men. . . . [T]he measure of its weight
should be tested according to its own standard . . . ” (para. 99). This is faith.28

To those who do not recognize authority in Bahá’u’lláh, these statements are
simply irrelevant. For them the legitimacy of the laws of The Kitáb-i-Aqdas
cannot rationally flow from legitimacy of their source. In fact, thanks to
centuries of human abuse of revealed religion, the suggestion of newly revealed
divine law is likely to strike many as inherently illegitimate.29 Nevertheless,

28. It is significant that even in The Kitáb-i-Aqdas Bahá’u’lláh writes: “[Y]e [are]
free to ask what you need to ask, but not such idle questions as those on which the men
of former times were wont to dwell. . . . Ask ye that which shall be of profit to you in the
Cause of God and His dominion, for the portals of His tender compassion have been
opened before all who dwell in heaven and on earth” (para. 126). This would seem to
reconfirm the balance between faith and reason, religion and science. As ‘Abdu’l-Bahá
has written, “[Humanity] cannot fly with one wing alone. If it tries to fly with the wing
of religion alone it will land in the slough of superstition, and if it tries to fly with the
wing of science alone it will end in the dreary bog of materialism” (qtd. in Esslemont,
Bahá’u’lláh and the New Era 210).

29. To the uninitiated it should be pointed out that the Bahá’í system does not share
certain characteristics that have so often redounded to the illegitimacy of systems of
government claimed to be based on revealed religion. No living individual is claimed to
be infallible nor does any one have the authority to interpret Bahá’u’lláh’s revealed

58         THE JOURNAL OF BAHÁ’Í STUDIES                                  6.1.1994

The Kitáb-i-Aqdas also has a claim to legitimacy based on its content: as a
constitution for world order, ordaining institutions, principles, and social laws
which can inspire the further development of presently emerging universal
principles of justice. To Bahá’ís, of course, it is no coincidence that principles
fundamental to Bahá’u’lláh’s World Order should now be advocated regularly
in international fora as standards without which there is little hope for the future
of humankind. To others, Bahá’u’lláh’s system must prove itself on its merits if
it wishes to be recognized as the “highest means for the maintenance of order in
the world and the security of its peoples” (Kitáb-i-Aqdas, para. 2). To the extent
that it is perceived to be just, inclusive, and irrevocably wedded to universal
principles, it can be recognized as a legitimate system of governance. The
strength of its claim will depend not only on what is written in The Kitáb-i-
Aqdas but also on the behavior of Bahá’ís in their efforts to put the system into
practice. Bahá’í communities and institutions today are still in their earliest
stages of development, but they invite the study of those who would discern the
potentialities latent within them.
