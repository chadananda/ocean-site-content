                                Global Claims, Global Aims:
An analysis of Shoghi Effendi’s
The World Order of Bahá’u’lláh (1929-36)
Zaid Lundberg

This paper addresses two main questions: What is Shoghi Effendi’s (1897-1957) discourse on
‘globalization’ and ‘globality’? and What are the global1 claims and global aims in The World
Order of Bahá’u’lláh?

GLOBAL MISSIONARY PLANS
Global missionary plans2 in the Baha’i Faith are traceable to ‘Abdu’l-Baha in 1916-17, but
they were unrealized during his lifetime.3 At the beginning of Shoghi Effendi’s ‘ministry’
(1922-57) he wrote Bahá’í Administration (1923-33) where he urged the Baha’is to spread
globally (Shoghi Effendi 1928: 69) but the first executed systematic plan had to wait until
1936 when he announced ‘The First Seven Year Plan’ (1937-44).4 Subsequently other
national plans were developed.5 The aim of ‘The Second Seven Year Plan’ (1946-53),
however, was to establish local spiritual assemblies in various countries on other continents.6
None of these plans, however, could be considered global but where either national,
continental, or, at the most, international in scope. The year 1951-53 is a watermark in the
geographical expansion of the Baha’i Faith. In 1951 Shoghi Effendi (1965: 104) coins the
noteworthy term ‘global crusade’ and launches the missionary plan in 1953 via four
‘intercontinental conferences’ held on four different continents.7 Thus, ‘The Global Crusade’
(1953-63)8 can be said to be the first truly global missionary plan.9 Shoghi Effendi played an

\[1\] The term ‘global’ appears already in 1676 in Merriam Webster Dictionary where it means ‘of, relating to, or
involving the entire world’ and it seen as synonymous with the term ‘worldwide.’ Similarly, according to
Cambridge International Dictionary of English the term ‘global’ means ‘If something is global, it relates to the
whole world.’ It is distinguished from the word ‘international’ which is ordinarily understood as ‘1. involving
several countries: involving two or more countries or their citizens, 2. crossing national boundaries: extending
beyond or across national boundaries, 3. of relations among nations: concerned with relations between nations’
(Encarta 2003). See Scholte 2002: 8-9 and footnote 9.

\[2\] These plans are fourteen tablets that are addressed to the N. American Baha’is and published in 1919 as Tablets
of the Divine Plan. The mandate in these tablets is to spread the Baha’i Faith to all the five continents including
120 territories and islands.

\[3\] When ‘Abdu’l-Baha passed away in 1921 there were neither National Spiritual Assemblies (NSAs - the
nationally and democratically elected governing and administrative body of the Baha’i Faith) nor any
administrative order and the Baha’is numbered only c. 200,000 followers out of which 90 percent were Iranian
(Hofman 1993: 92; Smith 2000: 138). Geographically, the Baha’i Faith was largely confined to Iran with few
followers in residing in 35 countries, mainly the Middle East, N. America and Europe (Smith 2000: 137-154).

\[4\] This plan was directed to the N. American Baha’is to ‘establish one local spiritual assembly in every state of the
United States and every province of Canada, and to created one centre in each Latin American republic’ (Momen
1989: 180).

\[5\] E.g., India/Burma, the British Isles, Germany/Austria, and Australia/New Zealand.

\[6\] Europe and Africa.

\[7\] Africa (Kampala), America (Wilmette), Europe (Stockholm), and Asia (New Delhi).

\[8\] ‘The Global Crusade’ is also known as ‘The Ten Year Plan’ (Hassall 1994/95).

\[9\] Shoghi Effendi (1971: 152, italics added) writes ‘Let there be no mistake. The avowed, the primary aim of this
Spiritual Crusade is none other than the conquest of the citadels of men’s hearts. The theater of its operations is
the entire planet.’ Indeed, similar to ‘Abdu’l-Baha’s global missionary plan, its aim was ‘to settle Bahá’ís in
every significant territory and island group throughout the world’ (Smith 2000: 272). At the beginning of global

important role of the international expansion of the Baha’i Faith but he is also the key figure
in its global phase.10 The focus of this paper is not on Shoghi Effendi’s global missionary
plans but on his globalization discourse and the global claims and aims in one of his most
important doctrinal11 documents - The World Order of Bahá’u’lláh (1929-36) – that precedes
his plans. As such one purpose of this paper is to retrospectively delineate the ideological
discourse at the basis for such subsequent global mission. It is argued that there is an implicit
dialectic in The World Order of Bahá’u’lláh where e.g., the Baha’i Faith is defined as a
‘world religion’ (global claim) while envisioning a future ‘Baha’i commonwealth’ (global
aim). In order to shed light on this implicit dialectic it is maintained that an Aristotelian12
causality – his idea of a final or teleological cause – is essential and recurrent. In Aristotle’s
analysis of causality, all things have a purpose or aim, actualized as various potentials develop
over a period of time (Aristotle Physics II, 7. See Waterfield 1996). No scholarly work so far
has put Shoghi Effendi’s writings in globalization and Aristotelian contexts. The present
paper is therefore preliminary research in a novel territory of Baha’i scholarship.

SHOGHI EFFENDI, GLOBALIZATION, AND GLOBALITY
In order to portray Shoghi Effendi’s global discourse some terminology needs to be discussed.
The term ‘globalization’ appeared in the English language in 1959 (Schreiter 1997: 5) – two
years after Shoghi Effendi’s death. The term ‘globality’ is recent and this paper follows
Scholte’s (2002: 2, 4) distinction between globality as ‘the condition’ and globalization as
‘the trend.’ The latter term has during the last decades generated not only a variety of
definitions13 and conceptualizations but great theoretical implications (Robertson 1992;
Waters 1995; Kofman & Youngs 1996; Beck 1998; Beynon & Dunkerley 1999; Scholte 1999,
2002; Baumann 2000). The idea of something worldwide is inherent, but not exhaustive, to
definitions of globalization (Giddens 1990: 64; Robertson 1992: 8; Stackhouse 2000: 22).
Recently there has been an upsurge in cultural dimensions of globalization where religion has
an important role (Featherstone 1990, 1995; Robertson 1992; Friedman 1994; Appadurai
1996; Cvetkovich & Kellner 1997; Jameson, & Myoshi 1998; Haynes 1999; Skelton & Allen
1999; Tomlinson 1999). Rather than seeing globalization as a unified or one-dimensional
concept Appadurai (1998) prefer five global ‘scapes’14 and Waters (1995: 187) suggests the
crusade the Baha’i Faith was found within 128 countries and territories and when Shoghi Effendi unexpectedly
passed away in London in 1957 the numerical growth was insignificant but it was established in 254 countries
with about 50 NSAs (Rabbani 1969: 391-392).

\[10\] Smith (2000: 137-140) divides the expansion of the Baha’i Faith into three distinct phases: 1) the ‘Islamic
period’ (1844-c.1892); 2) ‘Internationalization’ (c. 1892-1953); and 3) Global expansion (from 1953). See also
Rabbani 1969: 94.

\[11\] Hofman (1991: 18) states that ‘Without deep study of this basic document, no Bahá’í can claim to be truly
knowledgeable of his Faith. Indeed, no one can have a deep, authentic knowledge of the Revelation of
Bahá’u’lláh without study of all these expository and exegetical works of the Guardian.’ See footnote 22.

\[12\] Baha’u’llah (1978: 147), ‘Abdu’l-Baha (1978: 7; 1981: 15) and Shoghi Effendi (1991: 154) give several
references to Aristotle in their writings. It is also significant that Kluge (2000: 3) states that there is an
‘Aristotelian substratum or soil of the Baha’i Writings’ and that ‘the Baha’i Writings re-affirm many of
Aristotle’s philosophical ideas and methods of studying reality and adapt and develop them to their own unique
purpose of laying the philosophical foundations for a Baha’u’llah’s new world order’ (Kluge 2002).

\[13\] Beck (1998: 36, translation mine) states that ‘Globalization has surely been the most used and abused, most
seldom defined, probably the most misunderstood, vague and politically effective slogan during the last years
and will be during the years to come’ (Cf. Robertson 2000: 63 and Scholte 2002). Thus, it is no surprise that
authors on globalization are neither unanimous regarding its definition (Schreiter 1997: 4) nor do they agree
when this process started (Schreiter 1997: 5; Stackhouse & Paris 2000: 8). Beck (1998: 37) gives various dates:
Marx/Wallerstein 15th century; Giddens 16th century; Robertson 1870-1920; Perlmutter 1989. Rifkin (2003: 5)
argues that it is traceable to 1944.

term ‘sacriscapes’ for religion. Accordingly, globalization is currently perceived as a multi-
dimensional phenomenon (Beyer 1994: 15; Waters 1995: 14-16; Robertson 2000: 54;
Stackhouse 2000: 37-38).
Shoghi Effendi showed great interests in both education and world matters15 and during his
international studies16 he chose subjects like economics, social sciences, political science and
philosophy (Khadem 1999). In 1931 he writes that ‘political and economic unification of the
world’ is ‘a principle that has been increasingly advocated in recent times’ (1991: 34).
Robertson (1992: 8, italics added) portrays globalization as ‘the compression of the world and
the intensification of consciousness of the world as a whole’ and ‘the overall process by
which the entire world becomes increasingly interdependent, so as to yield a ‘single place’.
We could even go so far as to call the latter a ’world society’, as long as we do not suggest by
that term that nationally constituted societies are disappearing’ (Robertson 1989: 8, italics
added. Cf. Scholte 2002: 14, 16). Similarly, Scholte (2002: 2) defines globalization as ‘the
spread of transplanetary – and in more recent times – supraterritorial – connections between
people.’ Although Shoghi Effendi does not use Robertson’s term ‘compression,’ he writes in
1931 that the world is ‘contracted and transformed into a highly complex organism by the
marvellous progress achieved in the realm of physical science, by the world-wide expansion
of commerce and industry,’ and that ‘the fortunes of its races, nations and peoples becoming
inextricably interwoven’ (Shoghi Effendi, 1991: 47, 59, 198). Similar ideas are found in other
early writings. In 1939 he writes (1990: 87, italics added) that ‘The world is contracting into a
neighborhood,’17 and in 1941 he writes of ‘the fundamental changes effected in the economic
life of society and the interdependence of the nations, and as the consequence of the
contraction of the world, through the revolution in the means of transportation and
communication’ and that:
The world is, in truth, moving on towards its destiny. The interdependence of the peoples and nations of the
earth, whatever the leaders of the divisive forces of the world may say or do, is already an accomplished fact. Its
unity in the economic sphere is now understood and recognized. The welfare of the part means the welfare of the
whole, and the distress of the part brings distress to the whole (Shoghi Effendi 1980: 122, italics added).
Stackhouse (2000: 22, italics added) writes that globalization ‘combines the notion of a
worldwide, ordered place of habitation subject to transformation.’ In 1931 Shoghi Effendi
describes his visions of ‘present-day society’ that implies ‘a change such as the world has not
yet experienced’ and that it:
calls for no less than the reconstruction and the demilitarization of the whole civilized world -- a world
organically unified in all the essential aspects of its life, its political machinery, its spiritual aspiration, its trade
and finance, its script and language, and yet infinite in the diversity of the national characteristics of its federated
units (Shoghi Effendi 1991: 43).
Sentences like ‘the world, contracted and transformed into a single highly complex organism’
and passages like ‘Great and far-reaching as have been those changes in the past, they cannot
appear, when viewed in their proper perspective, except as subsidiary adjustments preluding
that transformation of unparalleled majesty and scope which humanity is in this age bound to
undergo’ also testify to this theme of transformation (Shoghi Effendi 1991: 46, italics added).

\[15\] Ruhiyyih Rabbani (1969: 177) describes Shoghi Effendi as ‘the keenest observer of political events and kept
abreast of all happenings’ and the ‘exactitude with which he compiled statistics, sought out historic facts, worked
on every minute detail of his maps and plans was astonishing’ (Rabbani 1969: 127-28).

\[16\] The French Jesuit school, Collège des Frères, in Haifa, Catholic Boarding School and Syrian Protestant
College (later known as the American University) in Beirut, and Balliol College at Oxford University (1920-21).

\[17\] Cf. Shoghi Effendi (1965: 126) and McLuhan’s (1962) term ‘global village.’

Moreover, globalization is portrayed as multi-dimensional involving ‘transportation and
communication’ (communication), ‘demilitarization’ and ‘political machinery’ (politics),
‘spiritual aspiration’ (religion), ‘trade and finance’ (economics), and ‘script and language’
(culture). Noticed that such a process is ‘not only necessary but inevitable, and that its
realization is fast approaching’ (1991: 43, italics added) and that the world is ‘moving on
towards its destiny.’ Key terms as inevitability, realization, and destiny, coupled with world
processes suggest an underlying Aristotelian teleology as well as global aims.
Above Robertson defines globalization in terms of a ‘single place’ and a ‘world society.’
Waters (1995: 5, italics added), similarly, states that in ‘a globalized world there will be a
single society and culture occupying the planet tend towards high levels of differentiation,
multi-centricity and chaos.’ Above Shoghi Effendi describes ‘a world organically unified in
all the essential aspects of its life’ and ‘yet infinite in the diversity of the national
characteristics of its federated units.’ Thus, Shoghi Effendi, Robertson and Waters envision
not only a ‘world society’ but emphasize that it will be diverse or heterogeneous. It is
apparent that although Shoghi Effendi was unable to utilize the term ‘globalization’ there is
an agreement between Shoghi Effendi and authors on globalization it is a:

> •   multi-dimensional phenomenon
> •   contraction/compression of the world (increasing inter-dependency)
> •   major transition/transformation
> •   move towards a single/world society, yet diversified
It is argued that the first three points depict ‘globalization’ (the trend) and the fourth point is
‘globality’ (the condition). Conceptualized in this manner Shoghi Effendi’s global discourse
predates modern authors on the subject more than half a century.

THE WORLD ORDER OF BAHÁ’U’LLÁH
The World Order of Bahá’u’lláh: Selected Letters18 was written to the N. American Baha’i
communities during 1929-36. It is significant that this document was written during a phase-
transition period between an end-phase administration (‘the Administrative Order’)19 and a
start-phase of missionary plans (1937-63).20 It is also noteworthy that Ruhiyyih Rabbani
writes that it was:

\[18\] Although the original letters included neither a title nor subtitles, they were ‘added with Shoghi Effendi’s
approval for the convenience of the reader’ (Holley ‘Introduction’ to The World Order of Bahá’u’lláh, p. v). Yet,
in the very first letter, entitled ‘The World Order of Bahá’u’lláh’ the phrase ‘the World Order ushered in by
Bahá’u’lláh’ occurs on the very first page (p. 3). The exact phrase ‘the World Order Bahá’u’lláh’ occurs 7 times
(p. 35, 74, 148, 171, 185, 194, 195) and the phrase ‘world order’ 25 times. The letters are: 1) ‘The World Order
of Bahá’u’lláh’ (27 February 1929); 2) ‘The World Order of Bahá’u’lláh: Further Considerations’ (21 March
1930); 3) ‘The Goal of the New World Order’ (28 November 193 1); 4) ‘The Golden Age of the Cause of
Bahá’u’lláh’ (21 March 1932); 5) ‘America and the Most Great Peace’ (21 April 1933); 6) ‘The Dispensation of
Bahá’u’lláh’ (8 February 1934); and 7) ‘The Unfoldment of World Civilization’ (11 March 1936). For a short
summary of these letters see Smith 2000: 364-65.

\[19\] This can be seen from his correspondence with the N. American community, published as Bahá’í
Administration (1923-33).

\[20\] Bramson-Lerche (1982: 266) writes that ‘In 1926 Shoghi Effendi began to emphasize the transition from
concentrating on developing the administrative institutions to using them to further propagation efforts’ and that
after Shoghi Effendi had ‘established a basic understanding in the American community of the principles of the
Bahá’í Administrative Order, he began to explain the principles of the World Order of Bahá’u’lláh’ (Bramson-
Lerche 1982: 257). It is also noteworthy that Momen & Smith (2003) divides Shoghi Effendi’s ‘ministry’ into

designed to clarify for the believers the true meaning and purpose of their Faith, its tenets, its implications, its
destiny and future and to guide the unfolding and slowly maturing Community in North America and in the West
to a better understanding of its duties, its privileges and its destiny (Rabbani 1969: 212, italics added).
Tenets (claims) is associated with The World Order of Bahá’u’lláh, and note, in an
Aristotelian teleology, how many times terms like ‘purpose,’ ‘destiny’ and ‘future’ (aims) are
employed. The sixth letter, ‘The Dispensation of Baha’u’llah’ (1934), is relevant since
Ruhiyyih Rabbani (1969: 213, clarification added) states ‘I know from his [Shoghi Effendi]
remarks that he considered he had said all he had to say, in many ways, in the Dispensation.’
Moreover, it is significant that it is referred to his ‘confession of faith’ (Hofman 1993: 99) and
‘doctrinal statement’ (Smith 2000: 122). Such remarks infer the doctrinal status of this letter
but such claim is also be substantiated and corroborated from terms and phrases used
throughout The World Order of Bahá’u’lláh e.g., ‘basic principles,’ ‘essential verities,’
‘cardinal tenets’ and ‘fundamentals’ (Shoghi Effendi, 1991: 3, 123, 199, 15).21 The phrase
‘fundamental verities and ideals of their Faith’ may be interpreted as representing both claims
and aims. In addition, Shoghi Effendi 1991: 147) refers to ‘this general exposition of the
fundamental verities of the Faith,’ and that he has ‘endeavored to dissipate . . .
misapprehensions’ (Shoghi Effendi 1991: 131).22 Considering these points this paper concurs
with previous Baha’i scholars who consider The World Order of Bahá’u’lláh one of Shoghi
Effendi’s major doctrinal work and a main source for understanding the Baha’i Faith.23
Before analyzing the global claims and global aims in The World Order of Bahá’u’lláh it is
important to briefly consider ‘three Baha’i areas’ 1) the Baha’i Faith, 2) the Administrative
Order, and 3) the World Order of Baha’u’llah.24
In The World Order of Bahá’u’lláh the Baha’i Faith is divided into ‘three ages that constitute
the component parts of the Bahá’í Dispensation’ (Shoghi Effendi 1991: 144). Each age or
period in this dispensation is described in significant terms: ‘the Transitional and Formative
period of the Faith,’ or ‘the formative age,’ which commenced with Shoghi Effendi’s own
‘ministry’ (1922- ) (Shoghi Effendi 1991: 98, 143). This period or age can be seen in
contradistinction to the ‘heroic age . . . the Primitive, the Apostolic Age,’ that starts with the
‘Declaration of the Báb,’ (1844) and concludes with the passing of ‘Abdu’l-Baha (1921)
(Shoghi Effendi 1991: 52, 89). The formative age or period will, in turn, give rise to ‘the
Golden Age of the Revelation of Bahá’u’lláh,’(Shoghi Effendi 1991: 49, 53) ‘that golden
two phases: 1) The Development of the Baha’i Administrative Order (1922-c.1937) and 2) The Systematic
Spread of the Baha’i Faith (c.1937-63). See also Hatcher & Martin 1989: 167.

\[21\] Variations of the most common phrases are: ‘fundamental verities and ideals of their Faith’ (pp. 66, 99, 147,
164); ‘root principles’ (pp. 99, 116); and ‘this cardinal principle’ (pp. 116, 151).

\[22\] The two first letters of The World Order of Bahá’u’lláh were addressed to Ruth White and Ahmad Sohrab, an
American and a Persian Baha’i respectively, who both questioned the idea of Baha’i Administration and
seriously attacked Shoghi Effendi’s ‘Guardianship.’ It is noteworthy that Bramson-Lerche (1988: 276, italics
added) states that ‘White’s attack . . . caused Shoghi Effendi to begn [sic] to synthesize and expound those
doctrines in the Bahá’í Faith which would lay a solid foundation for expansion and give the Bahá’ís a more
profound understanding of their religion, especially of the administrative order and world order.’ Thus, there is a
dialectic between doctrines (claims) and missionary expansion (aims).

\[23\] It is noteworthy that in 1987 a letter written on the behalf of The Universal House of Justice (quoted in
Bergsmo 1991: 9) writes that ‘such well-read and familiar titles as Bahá’í Administration, The World Order of
Bahá’u’lláh, The Advent of Divine Justice . . . [etc] . . . form part of the primary literature of the Faith.’ The
World Order of Baha’u’llah and The Dispensation of Baha’u’llah are also offered as internet-based distance-
learning courses by the Wilmette Institute (Illinois, USA), see Wilmette Institute. See footnote 7.

\[24\] This phrase should not be confused with the title of The World Order of Baha’u’llah, but is a concept that
Shoghi Effendi frequently employs in The World Order of Baha’u’llah. See footnote 16.

millennium,’ (1991: 74, 156) ‘the Most Great Peace,’ (1991: 19, 69) or ‘the Kingdom of God’
(1991: 39, 44). Not only is the age described as ‘transitional’ or ‘formative’ but the Baha’i
Faith itself is rendered as being ‘in its embryonic state,’ ’nascent,’ an ‘infant,’ ‘slowly
maturing,’ and ‘slowly crystallizing’ (Shoghi Effendi 1991: 23, 54, 74, 199).
The Administrative Order is described as being ‘in infancy,’ a ‘newborn child,’ ‘nascent,’
‘crystallizing,’ and in a ‘process of slow and steady consolidation’ (Shoghi Effendi 1991: 156,
144, 98, 154). This Administrative Order is supposed to give rise to the World Order of
Baha’u’llah, illustrated as ‘embryonic,’ a ‘gradual emergence,’ ‘yet unborn’ and it ‘is slowly
and imperceptibly rising’ (Shoghi Effendi 1991: 185, 29, 168, 24). Evidently, a number of
organic metaphors25 portray such a process of growth and unfoldment of potentials, implying
an Aristotelian teleology. The next passage utilizes an organic metaphor associating the ‘three
ages’:
The period in which the seed of the Faith had been slowly germinating [the Heroic Age] is thus intertwined both
with the one which must witness its efflorescence [the Formative Age] and the subsequent age in which that seed
will have finally yielded its golden fruit [the Golden Age] (Shoghi Effendi 1991: 144, clarification added).26
Notice the sequence: seed → germinating → efflorescence → fruit. Shoghi Effendi (1991:
155, italics added) also uses phrases like ‘the organic institutions of this great, this expanding
Order.’27 The relationship between the areas above and the usage of organic metaphors is
clearer in the next passage:
Though the framework of His Administrative Order has been erected, and the Formative Period of the Bahá’í
Era has begun, yet the promised Kingdom into which the seed of His institutions must ripen remains as yet
uninaugurated (Shoghi Effendi 1991: 168, italics added).
Observe that ‘the promised Kingdom’ is described ‘as yet uninaugurated.’ Shoghi Effendi
even states that he considers it his ‘that the promised glories of the Sovereignty which the
Bahá’í teachings foreshadow, can only be revealed in the fullness of time’ (1991: 16, italics
added). Thus, the full potential is still to be actualized in the future.
In this brief analysis Shoghi Effendi portrays the Baha’i Faith (1929-36) as dialectically
positioned between two great ages or periods, and that ‘three Baha’i areas’ are seen as part of
a slow and yet steady evolution of organic processes developing over time (Shoghi Effendi
1991: 23, 155). Thus, in an Aristotelian teleology, the Baha’i Faith (1929-36) is depicted in a
state of formation or transition:

The Baha’i Faith
Heroic Age → Formative Age → Golden Age

⁄                 │               \
(Báb, Bahá’u’lláh, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá) (Shoghi Effendi) (World Order of Baha’u’llah)

│
(Administration /The World Order of Bahá’u’lláh/ Plans)

\[25\] Hatcher & Martin 1989: 184-185.

\[26\] This interpretation is based on the fact that Shoghi Effendi mentions the ‘three ages’ in the earlier sentence.

GLOBAL CLAIMS28

The first area, reviewed above as Shoghi Effendi’s discourse on ‘globalization’ or ‘globality,’
does not directly involve the Baha’i Faith but pertains to ‘the world’:
The World
•   ‘the world, contracted and transformed                                  (p. 47)

into a highly complex organism’
•   ‘the fortunes of its races, nations and peoples                         (p. 59)

becoming inextricably interwoven’
•   ‘that universal fermentation which, in                                  (p. 170)

> every continent of the globe and
> in every department of human life’
•   ‘a world of inter-dependent peoples and nations’                        (p. 198)
Subsequent lists concern the ‘three Baha’i areas’ discussed above:

\[28\] A difference between a claim and an aim is that the former pertains more to statements that relate to what is
(the presence), or in Aristotelian terms, what is potential. In this context it is closely related to doctrines
(although doctrines may also be related to prophecy in the sense of futurology). An aim is more related to
purpose, intention, and plan, or in Aristotelian terms, what can be actualized. As such an aim is related to what
will be (the future). In this context it relates to, anticipates, and precedes, global activities and processes,
especially global missionary ideas and plans.

Obviously, the present (1929-36) nature of the Baha’i Faith is described most expressively
and little attention is paid to the two ‘orders.’ These, it is argued, are unrealized phenomena
ascribed to a future globality.
Another way to describe the global claims is statements that define the Baha’i Faith a world
religion. Such statements are seen in the seventh and last letter, ‘The Unfoldment of World
Civilization’ (1936), where a whole section - subtitled ‘A World Religion’- is devoted to this
definition:
Ceasing to designate to itself a movement, a fellowship and the like -- designations that did grave injustice to its
ever-unfolding system -- dissociating itself from such appellations as Bábí sect, Asiatic cult, and offshoot of
Shí’ih Islám, with which the ignorant and the malicious were wont to describe it, refusing to be labeled as a mere
philosophy of life, or as an eclectic code of ethical conduct, or even as new religion the Faith of Bahá’u’lláh is
now visibly succeeding in demonstrating its claim to be regarded as a World Religion, destined to attain, in the
in the fullness of time, the status of a world-embracing Commonwealth, which would be at once the instrument
and the guardian of the Most Great Peace announced by its Author (Shoghi Effendi 1991: 196, emphasis and
italics added).
This passage is central, not only because the word claim is employed, but also since the
Baha’i Faith is claimed an ‘ever-unfolding system,’ ‘a world religion,’ (global claim) while
‘destined to attain, in the fullness of time, the status of a world-embracing Commonwealth’
(global aim). Thus, although the Baha’i Faith is described as global, its full potential, in an
Aristotelian teleology, has yet to be actualized in a future globality.

GLOBAL AIMS
The third letter, ‘The Goal of a New World Order’ (1932), is pertinent since Shoghi Effendi’s
secretary referred to it as follows:
Shoghi Effendi wrote his last general letter to the western friends because he felt that the public should be made
to understand the attitude the Bahá’í Faith maintains towards prevailing economic and political problems. We
would let the world know what the real aim of Bahá’u’lláh was (Compilation 1991, italics added).
Again Shoghi Effendi’s economic and political interest is mentioned. Shoghi Effendi writes,
for example, that ‘It is towards this goal – the Goal of a new World Order . . . all-embracing
in scope . . . that a harassed humanity must strive’ (Shoghi Effendi 1991: 34, italics added).
‘The Goal’ is synonymous with aims and the phrase ‘all-embracing in scope’ is tantamount to
global and together they convey a global aim. Such global aims are nowhere clearer in The
World Order of Bahá’u’lláh than in the last letter, ‘The Unfoldment of World Civilization’
(1936), especially under the subtitle ‘World Unity the Goal’:
Unification of the whole of mankind is the hall-mark of the stage which human society is now approaching.
Unity of family, of tribe, of city-state, and nation have been successively attempted and fully established. World
unity is the goal towards which a harassed humanity is striving. Nation-building has come to an end. The
anarchy inherent in state sovereignty is moving towards a climax. A world, growing to maturity, must abandon
this fetish, recognize the oneness and wholeness of human relationships, and establish once for all the machinery
that can best incarnate this fundamental principle of its life (Shoghi Effendi 1991: 202, italics added).
World unity is clearly seen as an inevitable and more mature stage in the unfoldment of
humanity’s collective life depicted as: family → tribe → city-state → nation → world unity.
This scheme, together with phrases like ‘must strive,’ ‘is now approaching,’ ‘is striving,’ ‘is
moving,’ and ‘growing to maturity,’ and terms like ‘inevitable’ and ‘Unfoldment’ conveys in

Aristotelian teleology and, coupled with terms like ‘World unity,’ constitute global aims and
globality. This idea of ‘world unity’ is also seen in Shoghi Effendi’s concept of a ‘world
commonwealth’ where ‘all nations, races, creeds and classes are closely and permanently
united, and in which the autonomy of its state members and the personal freedom and
initiative of the individuals that compose them are definitely and completely safeguarded’
(Shoghi Effendi, 1991: 203). The global aims of this ‘world commonwealth,’ also referred to
as ‘Bahá’í commonwealth’ (Shoghi Effendi 1991: 7, 18), in the last letter, is listed below. The
list presents global aims and globality found throughout The World Order of Bahá’u’lláh.

•    ‘This New World Order . . . involves no less than the                      (p. 162, italics added)

complete unification of the entire human race’
The choice of words ‘must needs be evolved,’ ‘not yet experienced,’ ‘bound to undergo,’ ‘to
bring to a climax,’ ‘till,’ ‘supreme mission,’ ‘preparing for,’ ‘the future,’ ‘designed to,’
‘constantly evolving,’ ‘underlying aim,’ ‘shall,’ ‘Purpose,’ ‘destined to,’ and ‘in the fullness
of time’ are all significant. Clearly, in contrast to the list on global claims, the emphasis is on
the future. Moreover, the words like ‘must,’ ‘bound to’, ‘designed to,’ ‘shall,’ ‘destined to’ all
indicate an Aristotelian teleology. Coupled with phrases like ‘the whole of mankind,’ ‘the
whole body of nations,’ ‘upon earth,’ ‘over the surface of the globe,’ and ‘World Order’ they
convey global aims and globality.
So far the global aims and global claims in The World Order of Bahá’u’lláh has been
analyzed as two separate categories but they are nonetheless intimately related. Many of the
areas discussed above can be found in e.g., a single passage of ‘The Unfoldment of World
Civilization’:
The Revelation of Bahá’u’lláh [the Baha’i Faith] whose supreme mission is none other but the achievement of
this organic and spiritual unity of the whole body of nations, should, if we be faithful to its implications, be
regarded as signalizing through its advent the coming of age of the entire human race. It should be viewed not
merely as yet another spiritual revival in the ever-changing fortunes of mankind, not only as a further stage in a
chain of progressive Revelations, nor even as the culmination of one of a series of recurrent prophetic cycles, but
rather as marking the last and highest stage in the stupendous evolution of man’s collective life on this planet.
The emergence of a world community, the consciousness of world citizenship, the founding of a world
civilization and culture -- all of which must synchronize with the initial stages in the unfoldment of the Golden
Age of the Bahá’í Era -- should, by their very nature, be regarded, as far as this planetary life is concerned, as the
furthermost limits in the organization of human society . . . (Shoghi Effendi 1991: 163, clarification and italics
added).
First of all, Shoghi Effendi states what the ‘supreme mission’ is for the Baha’i Faith. This aim
is some form of global unification of nations i.e., globality. It further clarifies what the Baha’i
Faith is and is not (claims). The role of the Baha’i Faith is associated the ‘evolution of man’s

collective life on this planet’ and ‘this planetary life’ (global claims and global aims). Four
global aims (world community, the consciousness of world citizenship, a world civilization
and world culture) are seen to ‘synchronize with the initial stages in the unfoldment of the
Golden Age’. Shoghi Effendi depicts that the ‘Golden Age’ has stages and is supposed to
‘unfold,’ suggesting an Aristotelian teleology. Moreover, the idea that ‘The emergence of a
world community’ will coincide with ‘the Golden Age of the Bahá’í Era’ indicates that
globalization and the three Baha’i areas are not seen as unparallel or independent. In the
following passage Shoghi Effendi describes this ‘twofold process’:29
As we view the world around us, we are compelled to observe the manifold evidences of that universal
fermentation which, in every continent of the globe and in every department of human life, be it religious, social,
economic or political, is purging and reshaping humanity in anticipation of the Day when the wholeness of the
human race will have been recognized and its unity established. A twofold process, however, can be
distinguished, each tending, in its own way and with an accelerated momentum, to bring to a climax the forces
that are transforming the face of our planet. The first is essentially an integrating process, while the second is
fundamentally disruptive. The former, as it steadily evolves, unfolds a System which may well serve as a pattern
for that world polity towards which a strangely-disordered world is continually advancing; while the latter, as its
disintegrating influence deepens, tends to tear down, with increasing violence, the antiquated barriers that seek to
block humanity’s progress towards its destined goal. The constructive process stands associated with the nascent
Faith of Bahá’u’lláh, and is the harbinger of the New World Order that Faith must erelong establish. The
destructive forces that characterize the other should be identified with a civilization that has refused to answer to
the expectation of a new age, and is consequently falling into chaos and decline. A titanic, a spiritual struggle,
unparalleled in its magnitude yet unspeakably glorious in its ultimate consequences, is being waged as a result of
these opposing tendencies, in this age of transition through which the organized community of the followers of
Bahá’u’lláh and mankind as a whole are passing. (Shoghi Effendi 1991: 170, italics added)
Shoghi Effendi refers to a ‘universal fermentation’ global and pervasive. The first process (the
integrative) is associated with the Baha’i Faith and the second (the disruptive or destructive)
is connected with ‘civilization’ or ‘this age of transition.’ These two global processes will
eventually ‘bring to a climax the forces that are transforming the face of our planet.’ Note that
the Baha’i Faith will serve ‘as a pattern’ for the future ‘world polity’ and that it is ‘the
harbinger of the New World Order.’ Yet, both Baha’is and ‘mankind as a whole’ share, in an
Aristotelian teleological sense, the same ‘destined goal’ and ‘ultimate consequences.’ Above
Stackhouse states that the term ‘’globalization’ combines the notion of a worldwide, ordered
place of habitation subject to transformation.’ Shoghi Effendi frequently employs terms like
‘worldwide’ and ‘order.’ Coupled with the idea of the ‘three ages,’ organic metaphors, and
recurrent terms like ‘unfoldment,’ ‘reconstruction,’ and ‘a twofold process,’ he also maintains
that the world’s ‘ordered place of habitation’ is undergoing an inevitable and radical
transformation where the aim is some form of globality (‘World Unity’). Yet, although such
globality is the same for the two processes, Shoghi Effendi (1991: 162) makes a subtle, but
important, distinction with regard to the actors, the sequence, and ultimate aim of these
processes. The latter process, associated with ‘the collective efforts of mankind,’ can only
‘hope to achieve anything above or beyond that ‘Lesser Peace’’ that is described as a
‘political unification of the Eastern and Western Hemispheres,’ (Shoghi Effendi 1965: 33) or
‘political peace between nations’ (Smith 2000: 266-267). In contrast, the former process will
achieve ‘The Most Great Peace’ described as:
a peace that must inevitably follow as the practical consequence of the spiritualization of the world and the
fusion of all its races, creeds, classes and nations — can rest on no other basis, and can be preserved through no

\[29\] Although Shoghi Effendi does not refer to ‘the Major and Minor Plan of God’ (1965, p. 139-140) in The World
Order of Baha’u’llah he refers (1991: 161) to ‘God’s all-pervasive Will, the shaping of His perfectly and world-
embracing Plan.’ These concepts, however, illustrates how he envisions the dialectic and coincidence between
the above-described global processes.

other agency, except the divinely appointed ordinances that are implicit in the World Order that stands
associated with His Holy Name [the Baha’i Faith]. (Shoghi Effendi 1991: 162, italics and clarification added)
The actors, processes, and aims can be depicted as follows:

> Kingdom of God
Accordingly, both Baha’is and mankind as a whole are, inevitably destined to establish
‘World Unity’ (Globality I) yet the former are only indirectly involved in creating the ‘Lesser
Peace.’ In contrast, the latter are uninvolved in establishing the ultimate global aims, ‘the
World Order of Baha’u’llah/Baha’i Commonwealth,’30 synonymous to ‘the world’s future
super-state,’ or ‘world-civilization,’ (Globality II) and that will inaugurate ‘that golden
millennium,’ ‘the Most Great Peace/Kingdom of God’ (Globality III) of the Baha’i Faith.31

CONCLUSION
In this brief analysis of Shoghi Effendi’s global discourse in The World Order of Bahá’u’lláh
it is clear that although a leader of a religious community, his view of globalization (and
Globality I) includes a range of non-religious dimensions, and his ideas predates, and is
strikingly similar to, modern authors on the subject. Yet, theological and teleological
(Aristotelian) aspects of his of global discourse predominate The World Order of Bahá’u’lláh.
This paper has argued that this globalization discourse is the ideological basis for Shoghi
Effendi’s subsequent global missionary plans.

Shoghi Effendi (1974: 364, italics added) refers to this process as ‘the successive stages of repression, of
emancipation, of recognition as an independent Revelation, and as a state religion, must lead to the
