Shi'i Clerics in Iraq and Iran,
1722-1780: The Akhbari-Usuli
Conflict Reconsidered

Juan Cole

It has long been held that the eighteenth         century was
a pivotal    one in the history       of Imami Shi'i thought and ju-
risprudence    in Iraq and Iran.        At the beginning   of this era,
it is said, the previously         dominant Usuli school declined,
and the conservative        Akhbari school came to the fore.       This
intellectual     revolution    coincided   with the fall of the Safa-
vid dynasty in Iran and the disestablishment            of Shilism under
the Afghans and then Nadir Shah.           Standard accounts would
have us believe      that Akhbarism became dominant.        Then late
in the century,      as the Qajars came to power, the Usuli school
staged a comeback in the shrine cities           of Iraq and subse-
quently in Iran.1

This version     of events,     deriving    from published   nine-
> teenth-century      Usuli works, contains        elements of truth.      But

Moreover, most treatments     of the period adopt an ap-

scholars,    or ulama, as a group in society,        influenced    by
social    and economic developments     as well as political       ones.
Schools of thought should be seen as ideologies             supporting
the position    or aspirations    of differing    groups of ulama.
Family histories    written    in the eighteenth     century are an
essential    but as yet unused resource       in this endeavor of
revision.

Several critical    questions     need to be asked about the
period:     Is there good evidence      that   Akhbari religious      and
legal doctrines     dominated the religious        establishment     in
Iran during the eighteenth       century?      What do we really      know
about intellectual     currents    in Iran's major cities        at that
time, or for that matter about the less populous but still
important small towns (qasabahs)?           Did Akhbarism really        only
come to the fore in the Iraqi shrine cities             in the eighteenth
century,    or had it been dominant there earlier?             When ex-
actly did the Usuli revival        take place     in  Iraq?    Was it as
late  as  the  Qajar  period?    The   following     examination   of
manuscript sources and re-examination            of some printed ones
seek to clarify     the history    of Shilism in this crucial          cen-
tury.

During the eighteenth        century in Iran and Iraq the
established      central   political    institutions      of the preceding
two centuries      were weakened or destroyed,          with major demo-
graphic and cultural        shifts   taking place.        It began with
nearly    a quarter    century    of Shah    Sultan  Husayn   Safavi's
weak rule (1694-1722)         in Iran and Ottoman Governor Hasan
Pasha's firmer administration           (1702-1724)     in Iraq.     There
followed    in Iran 25 years of more or less Sunni rule, be-
ginning with the conquest of Isfahan by Ghalzai Afghans,
followed by the Islamic ecumenist Nadir Shah (1736-47),
who employed the Sunni Afghan tribes              as allies    in his bid
to create     an  empire.

After a long interregnum in which political          chaos
dominated the center,    the Shiraz-based    Shi'i ruler Karim
Khan Zand (1763-79)   consolidated    his position,     emerging as
the major force in Iran west of Khurasan.         Upon his death,
the Qajar tribe gained political      pre-eminence,     creating    a
new Shi'i state that   ruled   throughout   the  nineteenth     cen-
tury and into the twentieth.       In Ottoman Iraq, which suf-
fered Iranian incursions     under Nadir Shah during Ahmad
Pasha's governorship,    Sulayman Abu Laylah Pasha (1750-62)
created a new, regionally-based             Mamluk state that continued
under his slave-ruler    successors          until the reassertion  of
direct  Ottoman rule in 1831.2

These political      trends made a major impact upon the
Shi'i ulama.        Under Shah Sultan Husayn and his predecessor,
Shah Sulayman, the high ulama in Iran won great influence,
position,     and wealth.       Arjomand has shown that in so doing
the foreign     religious     scholars     from Syria, Bahrain, and Iraq
displaced,     to some extent,       the indigenous    "clerical       estate"
of landed notables        who had held official       religious      office.4
The Safavid capital,        Isfahan,     became the cynosure of the
Shi'i clerisy,       a center of learning        with 48 colleges       and
162 mosques, and a place where important career contacts
could be made.5        The clergy waxed so powerful that some
openly preached the necessity             for the ruler to be, not only
a Sayyid, but a mujtahid or senior jurisprudent                  trained     in
Ja'fari    law.    This disputed       the claim of the Safavis,          who,
though they asserted        their descent from the Prophet, were

laymen given often to loose morals.              The dominant view sup-
ported the legitimacy          of Safavid rule against        clerical     pre-

> tenders.6     Not everyone trusted          the ulama, as a seventeenth-
> century folk saying from Isfahan testifies:                 "Keep a wary
> eye in front of you for a woman, behind you for a mule, and
> from every direction        for a mulla."7       Most of the clergy were
> neither    independently      wealthy nor too proud to associate
> with the government,        as they held this was permissible              when-
> ever they would otherwise          fear for their lives or whenever
> they felt they could thereby help the Shi'i               community.8

The Afghan conquest of Isfahan in 1722 displaced            hun-
dreds of scholarly    families    and delivered    a mortal blow to
the dynasty that had assured their fortunes.            The Sunni
Ghalzais and Nadir Shah expropriated         the endowments sup-
porting the clergy,     leading to a relative      impoverishment
and a decline   in the influence      of this group.     During the
second quarter of the eighteenth        century great numbers of
Shi'i  clergymen and merchants fled Iran for the shrine
cities  of Ottoman Iraq, adding a new ethnic component to
the Arab quarters    of these cities.       Under the Safavids     the
high ulama establishment       in the center had favored the
Usuli school of jurisprudence,        which legitimated     an ac-
tivist   role for the clergy as legal scholars         in society.
The Iraqi shrine cities,       laboring under Sunni Ottoman rule,
had remained centers      of the more conservative      Akhbari

5                      WINTER 1985
school.      With the collapse    of Shi'i rule in Iran and the
anticlericalism       of the new rulers,   the ulama in any case
lost much of their previous        opportunity    for an active     so-
cial role.       The congregation    of hundreds of Iranian cleri-
cal families      in the Akhbari strongholds      brought them under
the conservative       influence  of  that school.      Isfahan itself,
while weakened, remained a center of rationalism,              mysticism,
and Usulism throughout this period,          exercising     a counter-
vailing    influence     in those areas.   Other Iranian centers
of Usulism also remained.         The rise of Akhbarism in the
eighteenth      century largely   occurred in the consciousness
of Isfahani      immigrants to Iraq.

The Majlisi       Family

One way to determine the import of the eighteenth
century for the Imami clergy is to examine the fate of
prominent families.      We are fortunate        in having a family
history   from the pen of Aqa Ahmad Bihbahani,            scion of two
ulama dynasties,     the Majlisis     of Isfahan and the Bihbahanis
of Karbala.9     Mulla MuhammadTaqi Majlisi            (d. 1656), from
a Syrian family     that emigrated      to  Iran  during   early Safa-
vid rule,    led Friday congregational        prayers in Isfahan,
the capital.     An extremely     significant      figure with Sufi
and Akhbari leanings,     his works wielded great influence
for centuries,    while his position        in Isfahan lent him re-
ligious   and political   power.10

Mulla MuhammadTaqi had three sons and four daughters.

All three sons became ulama and the daughters married cler-
gymen as well.      One son, Mulla cAzizu'llah,          renowned as an
author on religious      sciences   and belles-lettres        composition,
grew so wealthy that he rivaled        the very rich merchant
Mirza MuhammadTaqi cAbbasabadi.           The second son, Mulla
cAbdu'llah,     emigrated to India.     A network of Iranian and
Indian long-distance      merchants carried information          on the
overseas    job  market  to  Isfahan,  whose    intellectuals     were
prized at the Mughal court.11

The youngest brother,    MuhammadBaqir Majlisi    (d. 1699),
had no    reason to emigrate.     He succeeded his father as prayer
leader    (Imam-JumCah)   for the capital,   and under Shah Sultan
Husayn    rose to the rank of Shaykhu'l-Islam.      As a represen-
tative    of the increasingly    influential  ulama class,  Mulla
MuhammadBaqir waged a deadly campaign against               its competi-
tors for    state  patronage,      such  as  the Sufis.    He  further
initiated     a short-sighted      persecution   of Sunnis, as well
as of the 20,000 Hindu merchants and money-lenders                in Is-
fahan who competed successfully            with local concerns.12      He
adopted a strong commitment to the practice              of independent
legal reasoning       (ijtihad),     in contrast   to his father.13
His high social      position     allowed him to marry into the
notable class,      one of his three wives being the sister
of   Abu  Talib   Khan    Nihavandi.

Of Mulla MuhammadTaqi Majlisi's           four sons-in-law,
two were from Mazandaran, one from Shirvan north of Azer-
baijan,      and one was a Fasa'i from Fars province            in the
south.       Of the last,    Aqa Ahmad Bihbahani knew nothing.
Mulla MuhammadSalih Mazandarani (d. 1670) came to Isfahan
as a youth to escape poverty in his home province,                  eking
out    a  living   as  a student    on  a stipend   in  the  capital.
His brilliance        so impressed Majlisi       I that he gave him
his daughter Aminah Begam in marriage.                The girl,   highly

literate      and trained   in the religious      sciences,    gained a
reputation       as a mujtahidah,      or legal scholar,     in her own
right.14        In spite of having married well, Mazandarani
never became wealthy,          living   out his days in Isfahan as

a mujtahid.

even after 1722 it did not entirely            decline   as a center for

the ulama.     It indicates,     moreover, that clerical        elites
maintained    continuity     in spite of turbulence       at the center,

7                     WINTER 1985
Of MuhammadSalih Mazandarani's        sons, two emigrated to
Awrangzib's   India.    Aqa MuhammadSa'id Mazandarani emerged as
a favored court poet in Delhi, with the pen name "Ashraf."'17
His brother,   Aqa Hasan 'Ali,     followed   in his footsteps.     For
sons of Shi'i ulama to succeed socially         in the strongly    Sunni
atmosphere of the Mughal court it was necessary          for them to
concentrate   on literary    or medical pursuits,    which they did
with some success.      In Iran, MuhammadSalih's      daughter mar-
ried into a clerical      Sayyid family,    wedding the Shaykhu'l-
Islam Mir Abu'l-Macali,      a union that produced several      lead-
ing ulama based in the shrine cities         in the middle of the
eighteenth   century.

Many members of the third generation      lived through the
terrible    siege and sack of Isfahan,      some of them scattering
elsewhere.      Among those who remained, two important ulama
emerged at this point.       In 1714 Mir MuhammadSalih Khatuna-
badi, the prayer leader,      passed away and was succeeded by
his son, Mir MuhammadHusayn.         He held the post through the
Afghan period and until his death in 1738 in Nadir Shah's
base of operations,     Mashhad.    During the Nadir Shah era the
position    of Imam-Jumcah was held by Mir MuhammadHusayn's
distant    cousin and aunt's husband, MuhammadTaqi Almasi
(d. 1746).18      He was forced to adopt the shah's Sunni-Shi'i
ecumenism.      After one successor   from outside    the family,   the
post of Imam-Jumcah thereafter       reverted   to the Khatunabadis
on a permanent basis early in the Qajar period.

The third generation     intermarried     with other clerical
elites  in Najafabad (near Isfahan),         Mashhad, and Isfahan it-
self.   There was some settlement       in Najaf and Karbala.       Al-
though Bihbahani appears deliberately          to have included in
his family history     only those lines that remained ulama,
even some of their daughters began marrying artisans.              This
may have  been   simply  a natural   effect,    downward  mobility
being the fate of most descendants         of any wealthy family.
But given the prior exclusion       of so many from the genealogy,
it might reflect    the impoverishment       even of the ulama.

A grandson of MuhammadSalih Mazandarani continued a
family tradition   in following    his father to India.   Unlike
MuhammadAshraf, however, Muhammad 'Ali "Daman" settled         in
Murshidabad, Bengal, rather than in Delhi.       In the first
half of the eighteenth     century the Mughal court underwent
serious   decline, leading poets to seek patronage elsewhere.
The two rising       Shi'i-ruled      provinces    of Bengal and Awadh
might have offered particularly              congenial     settings    for Shi'i
scholars     from Iran.       But it was only in the last quarter of
the century that the nawabs of Awadh settled                    down to a pro-
vincial     court of their own, being until             then based largely
in declining      Delhi.      Thus, Shi'i-ruled        Bengal began to at-
tract the Majlisis         who wanted to peddle their literary               tal-
ents in India.        As the nawab's capital           after 1704, flourish-
ing Murshidabad, a major commercial center and producer of
silk goods, offered          immigrants great opportunities.l9               More-
over, in the late seventeenth-              and early-eighteenth         centuries
the Bengal port of Hughli had become an important trading
center for Iranian long-distance              merchants.        Indeed, they
amassed more capital          than any other group in the city.               Such
a congregation       of Iranians      ensured the growth of Shi'i            in-

stitutions     and patronage for Shi'i          scholars.20        The exis-
tence of a convenient           transportation     network based on trade
between the ports of Iran and Hughli also may have encour-

> aged scholars      to land there rather than risk the increasing-
> ly insecure     land route through Afghanistan              and the Punjab
> to Delhi.

The fourth generation       continued   to produce scholars
in Isfahan such as Taqi Almasi's          son Mirza cAzizu'llah
(d. 1750/1163),    a historian      as well ass a theologian.       The
turbulence    of the times is indicated        in the death of some
while traveling     to Mashhad, and the passing away of others
far from home in Najaf.        Of those who stayed in Isfahan
several   deserted    the pulpit    for the bazaar, producing a
dyer (sabbagh),     a fuller    (gadhar),    and daughters   that mar-
ried a hat maker (kulah-duz)         and a copper smelter      (rikhtah-
gar).

In the Mazandarani line one sees ulama tying them-
> selves    to the richer classes    of the bazaar, seeking new
> forms of economic security       when their links to the courts
> were so disrupted     from 1722 to the rise of the Zands. Their
> bazaar links and the relative        political     independence    this
> fostered    were to prove crucial     to the growth of ulama power
> in the nineteenth     and twentieth     centuries.21      Of Mulla Muham-
> mad Akmal's two wives, one was a granddaughter              of Muhammad
> Salih Mazandarani.       The children     of the other wife did not,
become mullas,     working in Isfahan and Tehran as money changers

(sarraf)   or in Zand Shiraz as money coiners          (zarrabi).      The
> children    of the Majlisi   wife, however, did become mullas,
> among them Aqa MuhammadBaqir Bihbahani.

9                      WINTER 1985
Aqa MuhammadBaqir first          married the daughter of Aqa S.

MuhammadTabataba'i,       congregational      prayer leader for the
small town of Burujird in Luristan,           whom he met in Karbala
after the Afghan invasion.          Aqa MuhammadBaqir later settled
in the small Iranian town of Bihbahan, which in this period
served as the stronghold        of the Kuhgilu tribe.      There he
married the daughter of a merchant, Hajji Sharafa.               Bihbahan
was increasingly     integrated     into Fars province,     serving as
a hinterland    town to the Persian Gulf port of Bandar Rig,
which in 1750 was so prosperous          as to rival Bushehr.22      Like
his father,    then, Bihbahani developed marital links both
with high status ulama families          and with wealthy bazaaris,
a step even more necessary        for him as he had the tragedy to
come of age just as the Safavid dynasty fell            and Iran was
thrown into political       turmoil.     Likewise,  a-female cousin
in Najafabad married a jeweler whose relatives            monopolized
high religious     posts in their town.

Another Mazandarani line in the fourth generation             did
not take up religious      occupations   at all.   Mulla Muhammad
Salih (named for his grandfather)        had a daughter who married
a merchant, Mirza Amin Tajir,        and a son who emigrated to
Bengal as a civil     servant for Viceroy cAli-Vardi      Khan Maha-
bat Jang (1740-56).23       CAli-Vardi Khan's brother had come
to Iraq and Iran as part of his visitation          of the Imams in
Najaf and Karbala.       In Isfahan he struck up a friendship
with Mulla MuhammadSalih,        then returned to the court in
Delhi.    When, in 1740, his brother was appointed viceroy
of Bengal, he wrote to Mulla MuhammadSalih informing him
that he needed good men to staff his upper bureaucracy.
The latter   dispatched    his son, cAla'u'd-Din     Muhammad, from
Isfahan forthwith.       As this ruling family was Shi'i and
Iranian,   they favored the importation       of other Iranians
for such posts.      The networks of pilgrimage      and visitation
in which the ulama were involved        enabled them to make con-
tacts crucial    for career changes, and at that point steamy
but rich Bengal might have looked more appealing           than Is-
fahan, with its decaying mosques.         Sometimes the change of
career and life style was very great.          The descendants      of
the Majlisi    court poets Ashraf and Daman in Murshidabad
were so debauched that Aqa Ahmad Bihbahani refused to in-
clude their names in his genealogy.

On the other hand, the Sayyid descendants         of Mazanda-
rani   through Mir Abu'l-Macali, a Shaykhu'l-Islam,         deter-
minedly remained mullas.     They established     links with high-
status Sayyid families    in small centers    like Burujird,   and
Aqa MuhammadBaqir was able to take advantage of these bonds.
The descendants   of daughters who had married-into       a mujtahid
family in Mashhad became notables      (addressed    as nawabs) in
Yazd, where they lived in palaces.       Their children    in turn
attained  the high religious   offices   of Sadr and Shaykhu'l-
Islam in Yazd.

The fifth     generation,    many of whom were born under
Nadir's rule and lived to see the advent of the Qajars,
continued    to establish      bazaar ties.       Imam-Jumcah Muhammad
Taqi Almasi's      grandson, CAllamah Mirza Haydar cAli, became
a mulla.     But his sister       married a polisher     of precious
stones   (hakkak)     whose grandsons congregated         in the Qajar
capital   of Tehran.       The family produced other mullas and
married into the Khatunabadis.            Almasi's    grand-niece     mar-
ried twice,     first   Mirza MuhammadMihdi Tajir-i            cAbbasabadi,
of a prominent Isfahani          commercial dynasty,      and then a Say-
yid whose descendants         became mullas and merchants.           This
generation     produced more skilled        artisans   in Isfahan,     a
silk weaver (tikmah-duz)          and a confectioner       (qannad),   and
a good number of extended family members lived in the shrine
cities   of Iraq, not all of them as mullas (they included a
copper smelter).

Among the heirs of MuhammadSalih Mazandarani one
finds a weaver of fine cloth (nassaj),           and a druggist    in
Kazimayn.    But most members of the family were either mul-
las or Bengali civil     servants.      Some, like Hajji Muhammad
Ismacil,  had one wife in Murshidabad and another in Karbala,
where he retired.     A sister     of the wealthy Bengali branch
of the family married into the Bihbihani mujtahid dynasty
in Karbala.     Among the family's      mullas,   especially    in the
Bihbahani and Tabataba'i       lines,   one notes in this period
a resurgence    of power and patronage.         The Zands, while not
as generous to the ulama as the Safavids had been, did pro-
vide some sinecures.       In the shrine cities       themselves   huge
amounts of money were placed in the hands of the leading
ulama by Nawab Asafu'd-Dawlah         of Awadh and other patrons

Aqa Ahmad provides little          information on the sixth
generation,   many of whom lived         into the nineteenth  century.

Numbers perished    in the Iraqi plague of 1773-74 or the Wah-
habi invasion   of Karbala in 1801, the devastation     wrought
by these events encouraging     many survivors   to emigrate.   In
1801, for instance,    a man moved to Murshidabad and two
brothers  in the Mazandarani line to Faizabad in Awadh. A
new wave of Iranian emigration      to India from 1790 also co-
incided with a significant     expansion of trade, particularly
the Iranian import of Indian cotton goods.24

From 1764 Bengal was decisively          under British      control,
while Awadh continued        to flourish    under Shi'i rule in the
north.     Murshidabad was no longer an administrative               center,
and its silk and other industries           were dealt a blow by the
famine of 1769-70,       from which the city never recovered.                 In
the early 1800s Aqa Ahmad found the area's Muslim notables
and learned tradition        impoverished,      the British    in control,
and whatever wealth still         existed   in the hands of Hindus.2S
In addition,     the Iranian-dominated       port of Hughli rapidly
declined     in favor of British      Calcutta.       In the latter      part
of the eighteenth      century scholarly        families    emigrating      from
Iran and the shrine cities         began to settle       in the flourish-
ing cities     of Awadh. One Murshidabadi branch of the Majlisi
clan moved to Lucknow and intermarried             with the family of
Asafu'd-Dawlah's      chief minister      in the 1790s, Raja Jhao Lal,
a convert to Shi'i       Islam.26     Aqa Ahmad Bihbahani himself
left Kermanshah for India because of financial                difficulties,
settling     in Patna as the congregational          prayer leader after
failing    to find patronage in Awadh.

The prestigious       clerical     dynasty of the Majlisis        adopted
varying strategies         to deal with the problems they faced in
the eighteenth        century.      These included emigration          to the
Iraqi shrine cities         where a constant        stream of pilgrims       and
long-distance       merchants provided them with a livelihood                as
legal advisers        and supervisors        of charitable     contributions
and pious endowments.             Some managed to retain religious           of-
fice in a declining          Isfahan,     while others intermarried         with
rich merchants or well-off             artisans,    when possible.       With
the decline       of court patronage for scholars            and the expro-
priation      of endowments, more were probably forced into low-
status     trades--cotton       or silk weavers,       smiths,   dyers,
bleachers,      and hat makers--than          would normally have been
the case.       Many settled       in Iran's small towns and large
villages,      where local tribal         leaders came into prominence
with the decline         of central      government.     The smaller centers

were less likely     to attract   marauding invaders,   prospering
as local trade depots,      even as some large cities     declined.
Members of the Majlisi.family        colonized high religious     of-
fice in Najafabad,     Ardistan,    Kazirun, Bihbahan, and Yazd.
Finally,     numbers sought employment in India as literary         men,
civil    servants,  and physicians.

Neo-Akhbari     Dominance    1722-1763     in   Iraq

Against this backgrop of geographical             and class dis-
location,       the ulama of the eighteenth         century fought out a
decisive      battle   on the interpretation        of Shi'ism.27        The
conflict      between strict    constructionist        Akhbari and ration-
alist      Usuli jurisprudents    centered on two sets of issues.
The first       concerned the sources of law, with the Akhbaris
restricting        them to the Qur'an and the oral reports             of the
Prophet and the Imams. The rationalists                 insisted     that the
consensus of the jurisprudents           could also serve as a source
of legal judgment, as could the independent                  reasoning

(ijtihad)      of the jurist.    The Usulis divided all Shilis
into formally trained jurisprudents               (mujtahids)     and laymen,
stipulating        that the ordinary believers         must emulate the
mujtahids in matters of subsidiary              religious      laws.

The rationalists  asserted  that the mujtahids,        as
general representatives     of the Hidden Imam, could substi-
tute for him in performing such tasks as rendering             legal
judgments,    implementing  rulings,   collecting     and distribut-
ing alms (zakat and khums), mandating defensive           holy war
and leading Friday congregational        prayers.     While Akhbaris
accepted that the relater      (muhaddith)     of oral reports from
the Imams could perform the functions          of judges,   they often
disallowed     some or all of the others in the absence of an
infallible     Imam. Akhbaris further rejected        any division   of
believers    into laymen and mujtahid-exemplars,        holding that
all Shilis    must emulate the Twelve Imams. In practice,
Akhbaris also made interpretations.

During the Safavid period the Usuli school,         associated

> the time of Shaykh Abdul-Ali      al-Karaki     (d. 1533), Isfahan's
> Imam-Jumcahs were for the most part Usulis.            Late in the
> period,   MuhammadBaqir Majlisi      exemplified    the Usuli ethos.

The situation    outside  Isfahan in the late seventeenth         cen-

tury is harder to gauge.           In some provincial     centers Akhbaris
remained influential.        The Imam-Jumcah       and  Shaykhu'l-Islam
of Qom under Sulayman Shah (1667-94),            MuhammadTahir, a big-
oted Akhbari brought up in Najaf, caused a row with the court
by censuring     the monarch's morals.28         Al-Hurr al-cAmili      (d.
1708-09) immigrated to Mashhad from Syria, becoming Shaykhu"l-
Islam.     A staunch Akhbari, he disallowed          the use of reason
and wrote against      rationalist     theology.29     The family of the
Akhbari Nicmatu'llah       Jaza'iri     (d. 1701) settled     in the small
Iranian town of Shushtar,          in Khuzistan,    as Akhbari prayer
leaders.30      As noted, the Akhbari school had found favor
with the ulama in the shrine cities            of Iraq, as well.

Shaykh Yusuf al-Bahrani         (1695-1772),       a key figure in
the intellectual       development of Shilism in Karbala, grew up
in the village      of Diraz on the isle of Bahrain.31                 His grand-
father,    a pearl merchant, helped bring him up. His father,
Shaykh Ahmad, a student of Shaykh Sulayman al-Mahuzi in
Bahrain, adhered to the Usuli school,                detesting     Akhbaris.
Usuli jurisprudence       was an important current in Safavid-
ruled Bahrain.        In 1717 al-Bahrani's          family fled an inva-
sion from Masqat, settling           on the mainland at Qatif for a
while.32     After his father's        death Yusuf commuted to Bahrain
to keep up the family pearl business,                pursuing his studies
in his spare time.         Financial     difficulties,        partly owing to
the high taxes charged by the invaders,                 led him to emigrate
to Iran soon after the Afghan conquest of 1722.                     He lived
in Kerman, then moved to Shiraz             where    he   gained   the  patron-
age of the governor.          Investing     in   agriculture,      which  his
patron allowed him to pursue tax-free,                 he began his famed
work on law, al-Hada'iq         al-nadirah.         He fled the city after
the Afghan army had reduced it in 1724 by mass slaughter                      and

looting,and    settled    in Karbala in Iraq.            There his financial
situation     improved, perhaps through trade.

Al-Bahrani      adopted the Akhbari school,         rejecting    his
early schooling        in Bahrain.      As a   refugee  from   Iran   in Kar-
bala, he would at first          have been dependent on the largesse
of Akhbari religious         dignitaries.       Moreover, the same po-
litical    instability     that propelled       him from his homeland
and deposed the Safavids          apparently      made an establishment-
oriented     school of jurisprudence         like Usulism less appeal-
ing.    As time went on, al-Bahrani            moved away from a strict
Akhbarism to a neo-Akhbari position               which had Usuli elements.
Nevertheless,       he rejected     Usuli  principles     of legal reason-

ing, the syllogistic   logic     Usulis allowed in interpreting
the law, and the legitimacy       of holy war during the occulta-
tion of the Imam.33

When the influx of Iranians   came into Karbala from
Isfahan and other Iranian cities,    especially    during the in-
terregnums of 1722-36 and 1747-63,     the Akhbari teachers     in
the shrine cities    employed their prestige    and patronage to
convince them to adopt the Akhbari school.        Thus, al-Bah-
rani' s many students   included not only other Arabs but in
later years such Iranian scholars     as Sayyid MuhammadMihdi
Tabataba'i  of Burujird,    Mirza MuhammadMihdi Shahristani,
and Mulla MuhammadMihdi Niraqi.34

The trend to Akhbarism after 1722 may be witnessed              in
another maj'or eighteenth-century        figure,   Aqa MuhammadBaqir
b. MuhammadAkmal (1705-90),         born in Isfahan and descended
on his mother's side from MuhammadTaqi Majlisi.                As the
chronology    of his career has remained confused,           a reinter-
pretation   is offered here.       Aqa MuhammadBaqir departed from
his home town for Najaf after the death of his father and
the 1722 Afghan invasion.        In Iraq he studied the rational
sciences   with Sayyid MuhammadTabataba'i           of Burujird and
the oral reports      of the Imams with Sayyid Sadru'd-Din           Qumni.
The latter    had trained    in Isfahan,    returning    to Qom as a
teacher.    He was forced to flee the Afghans, first            to Hama-
dan and Kermanshah, and finally         to Najaf.     Under the influ-
ence of Qummi, an Akhbari, the young Aqa MuhammadBaqir
likewise   came to adhere to this school.36           While in Najaf
in the late 1720s Aqa MuhammadBaqir married the daughter
of his teacher,      Sayyid MuhammadTabataba'i         (other marriage
alliances    existed   between the two families).          In 1732 (1144)
his first    son, MuhammadcAli, was born in Karbala.

In 1732-33 Nadir invaded Iraq, his troops occupying
the Shi'i holy places of Samarra, Hilla,       Najaf, and Karbala,
over which he appointed     Iranian governors.     Ottoman rein-
forcements   soon arrived,   forcing Nadir to make a peace
treaty and withdraw after he visited       the shrine cities.37
These military    engagements created insecurity     even in the
holy cities    of Iraq, and there may at this time have been
some exodus of anxious refugees      to still  more secure sites.

Whatever the reasons, Aqa MuhammadBaqir traveled  early
in the    1730s to Bihbahan on the border of the Iranian prov-

inces of Khuzistan and Fars.          Many Isfahani    scholarly    fami-
lies scattered     to such small towns (qasabah)        in  southern
Iran, which were relatively        near to the shrine cities        and
offered  greater     security  in this period than large cities;
moreover, Aqa MuhammadBaqir had a cousin there teaching
in the local seminary.38         At that point the town served as
a stronghold    for the semiautonomous Kuhgilu tribe and the
headquarters    of its Beglarbegi.        The latter   had allied     him-
self with Nadir Shah against MuhammadKhan Baluch in a bid
to maintain his local control over the area.39              In the
1730s the town, lying on a        north-south    trade  route    from
the port   of  Daylam,    was in  decline.40

Aqa MuhammadBaqir found the religious            institutions
dominated by Akhbaris from Bahrain.41              Although he may at
first    have gotten along with them, at some point he re-
verted to his Isfahani        Usulism, engaging in bitter          polemics
with the Akhbaris.      His son, Aqa MuhammadcAli, boasted that
he never emulated any jurisprudent,           being already a mujtahid
when he came of age     at    15  (in  1747)>42      This indicates     that
his   father  was  an Usuli    again   by the   late   1730s.    Aqa   Muham-
mad Baqir established       firm links to the elite         in Bihbahan
and its suburb of Qanavat, marrying the daughter of the
headman in the latter       and the daughter of Hajji Sharafa
the merchant in Bihbahan.43           He emerged as a popular prayer
leader and teacher,     remaining for 30 years.

Sunni-Shi'i    Ecumenism        in   Iran   1736-1751

While Aqa MuhammadBaqir found refuge in Bihbahan,
the ulama in most parts of Iran suffered          the assaults    of
Nadir Afshar.        In 1736 he gave up the fiction      of being
merely the agent of the young Safavid heir, having himself
declared    shah upon the plain of Mughan and abolishing          the
Safavid state altogether.          He made it one of the corner-
stones of his policy       that Iranians should renounce the
Shi'i practice      of cursing the first     two caliphs    of Sunni
Islam and tried to have Shi'ism incorporated            into Sunnism
as a fifth     legal rite.     Much of Shi'i   law was based on the
precepts    of the sixth Imam, Ja'far as-Sadiq,         whom Nadir
proposed to place on par with the founders of Sunni legal
rites   such as Abu Hanifah and ash-Shafi'i.          Nadir attempted
to negotiate      with the Sunni Ottomans an acceptance        of this
theological      compromise,   but  never proved  successful.     More

important,   the policy did allow him to keep the loyalty           of
both his Afghan troops and his Qizilbash       cavalry,      the former
bigoted Sunnis and the latter    extremist    Shilis.       Nadir Shah
forced the Shi'i ulama to agree to this compromise, execut-
ing one cleric    for opposing him.44     Wherever they felt it
necessary   they went along, but the assent of many surely
represented    no more than pious dissimulation       (taqiyyah),
as Nadir's proposal contradicted      their most cherished        dogmas.

Still,    many clerical     officials      were incorporated        into
Nadir's state and had to represent              his policies.      For in-
stance,    Mirza Ibrahim, qadi of Isfahan,             became Nadir's mil-
itary judge (qadi-Caskar).4S             The shah sent Abu'l-Qasim
Kashani, the Shaykhu'l-Islam,            and Mulla 'Ali Akbar, Mulla-
bashi,    to Istanbul    to negotiate       with the Ottoman ulama.            In
addition,      Nadir  sought  to   weaken     the  clergy,    and to  guard
against    any potential     clerical     opposition       to his policies,
he confiscated       the rich endowments that had supported the
seminaries      and mosques of Isfahan.46

On his return from India, Nadir Shah once again pre-
pared for conflict     with the Ottomans in Iraq.        He coordi-
nated a two-pronged attack,        through Kirkuk and Shahrizur
in the north and from Arabistan to Basra in the south, dis-
patching troops to occupy, once more, the Shi'i shrine
cities   in the summer of 1743.        In November, 1743, Nadir
Shah convened a congress of ulama from Iran, Afghanistan,
and Transoxiana,     as well as from the shrine cities,        in
order finally    to resolve    the differences    between Sunni
and Shi'i.     He attempted to propitiate       the Shi'i ulama of
Najaf   by ordering   the  gilding    of Imam  CAli's  shrine.

The conference,    after much debate and haggling,       pro-
> duced a document that rejected       the past Shi'i practice       of
> cursing the first     two caliphs,   stipulating    that Shi'is
> should abandon it on pain of death; that recognized            the
> legitimacy   of the rule of the first       three Sunni caliphs;
> and that granted the Iranians the right to follow the
> legal rite of Imam Jacfar as-Sadiq and yet remain within
> the Muslim community.       The list   of participants   reveals
> that most of the Iranian ulama were Imam-Jumcahs and qadis
> of Iran's chief cities.        No mention appears in the biograph-
> ical dictionaries     of the role the Akhbari establishment          at
> the shrine cities     played in these negotiations,      nor did as-
> Suwaydi refer to them, but they were almost certainly             in-

volved.   The Iranians took the lead in the negotiations      on
the Shi'i side, particularly     Nadir Shah's compliant Mulla-
Bashi.   The Ottomans rejected    the document that emerged.47
Some Shi'i officials   genuinely   committed themselves  to
Nadir's ecumenical stance.      The Imam-Jumcah of Isfahan
from 1746 to 1787, Shaykh Zaynu'd-Din cAli, wrote a refu-
tation of a treatise   by Mulla Haydar cAli in 1751, who
opposed the policy.    Haydar cAli had insisted    that all
sects other than the Imami were ritually      impure and out-
side Islam.   Shaykh Zaynu'd-Din replied     that Sunnis were
also Muslims.48

One longlasting   effect  of-Nadir Shah's Iraq campaign
of the 1740s was the provisions       in the peace treaty he fi-
nally concluded with the Ottomans that concerned Iranian
pilgrims    to the Iraqi shrine cities.      While the shah ceded
these cities     once more to the Turks in September 1746, he
stipulated    that Iranian pilgrims    be able to visit     the
shrines and that "so long as these pilgrims          carried no
merchandise,     the Governor and officials     of Bagdad were not
to levy any tax upon them."49        The unimpeded access for
Iranians to Karbala and Najaf guaranteed by the Treaty of
Kurdan meant prosperity      for merchants,    shopkeepers,    and
clerics    who lived off the pilgrim trade.       Moreover, in the
eighteenth    century the shrine cities     paid no tribute     to the
Mamluk government in Bagdad.50

The Usuli   Revival    in the   Zand Period:

1763-1779

In Bihbahan, Aqa MuhammadBaqir escaped from what the
communalist Imami ulama perceived          to be the indignities       of
Nadir's ecumenism, and for some time remained unaffected                 by
the turbulent     twelve-year    interregnum in central     government
that Iran experienced        in the wake of the Afsharid's       bloody
demise.     But the growing power of the Zands disturbed            the
tranquility    of Bihbahan in 1757-58, when Karim Khan first
attempted to subdue the tribespeople          in its vicinity.        In
July of 1757 the Zands took Bihbahan, imprisoning              the old
beglarbegi    and replacing     him with one of their supporters,
and levied an annual tribute         of 7,000 tomans.    The Zands
decisively    pacified    the area in 1765.51      It may have been
these military      campaigns and the disruptions      they brought
to local power and patronage structures          that encouraged Aqa

MuhammadBaqir to return        to Iraq sometime     in the early
1760s.

Bihbahani,     as he was now known, found the shrine
cities   an extremely hostile        environment for an Usuli.
Shaykh Yusuf al-Bahrani,         in his late 60s and ten years
senior to the newcomer, presided             over the religious      es-
tablishment    in Karbala as the prestigious             dean of Shi'i
scholarship.      Al-Bahrani's      neo-Akhbaris     considered    Usulis
to be ritually      impure, touching Usuli works with handker- S2
chiefs   to shield their fingers          from any polluting      effects.
More serious,     anyone walking in the street            with Usuli lit-
erature beneath his arm risked violent              assault.53     The
power structure       in the shrine cities        consisted    of an Arab
landholding    elite,     a number of mafia-type         gangs, and the
leading clerics.         Any important figure among the ulama
would have to make alliances           with the Sayyid landholders
and with the chief gangsters           who ran protection       rackets

in the bazaars.        At this point,      the Akhbaris had the im-
portant gangster or luti          contacts,     and could employ these
to intimidate      Usuli rivals.

Bihbahani at first      faced so many difficulties        in Kar-
bala that he seriously      considered     returning    to Iran.   His
eldest  son, Aqa MuhammadCAli, had even greater difficul-
ties adjusting    to the new intellectual        milieu.    He joined
Yusuf al-Bahrani's    classes,     receiving    a diploma (ijazah)
from him.    But he did not pursue further studies           with him
because he kept wishing to contradict           the old man's neo-
Akhbari teachings,    which would have been highly improper

(and perhaps even dangerous).         Aqa MuhammadCAli therefore
went on pilgrimage     to Mecca, settling       in Kazimayn until
1772\.S4

Aqa MuhammadBaqir began teaching     Usuli texts secret-
ly in his basement to a select     and trusted number of stu-
dents, many of them former pupils of al-Bahrani.           These
included his young grand-nephew on his first        wife's   side
of the family,    Sayyid MuhammadMihdi Tabataba'i       (1742-96),
who had settled    in Najaf in 1755 but now returned to study
with his great-uncle.55     Also involved was Bihbahani's
sister's    son, Sayyid cAli Tabataba'i    (1748-1801),    a mere
teenager    at the time.   When the Iranians had originally
come to the shrine cities     in the 1720s, many of them penni-

less refugees,   they had been integrated     into the Akhbari

ideology    of their Arab hosts and benefactors.             Forty years
later the founding of an Usuli cell in Karbala led by mem-
bers of the Majlisi       aristocracy     signaled    the increasing
financial    and social    independence      of the ethnically     Iranian
quarters    in the shrine cities.56          While the Iranian scholar-
ly families    originally     depended heavily       on government land
grants and emoluments in Iran, which many of them lost after
1722, the history       of the Majlisi      family sketched above sug-
gests that they increasingly          forged links with merchants
and skilled    artisans    in the bazaars,       giving them a new fi-
nancial base.      Though fallen      from their semifeudal       notable
status and dispossessed         of their lands around Isfahan, many
Iranian expatriates       could increasingly        compete with the
wealth of merchant-ulama,         like al-Bahrani,      on his own terms,
moving into the bourgeoisie          themselves.      The partial    upturn
in ulama fortunes       in the Zand period,       moreover, coincided
with the economic rebound of the artisan              and merchant
classes   with whom they had become increasingly             bound up.57

Aqa MuhammadBaqir had strong merchant contacts
through his in-laws        in Bihbahan and his half-brothers       in
Isfahan and Shiraz,        important insofar     as they might en-
courage merchant capitalists           who came through Karbala to
put charitable      contributions      in his hands and seek his
rulings    on commercial disputes.         It is also possible   that
his sister-in-law's        brothers    in Bengal might have channeled
charitable     contributions      from Indian notables    to the shrine
cities   through him.       Wealth was essential     to the success of
a great teacher,       as he attracted     students by providing    them
with stipends      to live on.       It was also indispensable   in in-
suring that the gangster bosses were on his side.

At some point Bihbahani began to feel that he had
enough students,    monetary support,  and security    to chal-
lenge al-Bahrani    openly, an event that led to the polariza-
tion of the scholarly     community in Karbala during the 1760s.
Fortunately    for the Usulis,  around this time the older and
more prestigious    Akhbari scholars  began to die off.     Muham-
mad Mihdi al-Fatuni    of Najaf, for instance,    passed away in
1769\.58

In 1772, when al-Bahrani    expired,  Bihbahani had at-
tained such a prestigious   position    that he read the funeral
prayers for his late nemesis.      Shaykh Yusuf's demise re-
moved the most vigorous Akhbari leader from the field,       al-

lowing Aqa MuhammadBaqir, then 67, to spend his last clear-
minded decade in consolidating  his position.     In this he
was aided not only by his nephews, the young Tabataba'is,
but by a number of other former students    of al-Bahrani    who
now forsook neo-Akhbarism for the Usuli school,     including
the Iranians MuhammadMihdi Niraqi and Mirza MuhammadMihdi
Shahristani  and the Arabs Shaykh Jacfar an-Najafi     and Sayyid
Muhsin Baghdadi.59   These in turn helped their aging mentor
to train a whole new generation   of youthful  mujtahids who
came from Iran to the shrine cities   in the last years of
Zand dominance and the opening years of Qajar rule.

The Usuli revival         in Iraq began to exert influence           on
Iran, where Usuli currents had always run strong,                    with a
wave of ulama reimmigration            from the shrine cities         in the
1770s.     Political      tensions    between Iraq and Iran arose in
the early 1770s, the Mamluk ruler cUmar Pasha levying a
frontier    toll on Iranian pilgrims           in contravention       of the
1746 Treaty of Kurdan.60             The new policy      adversely    affected
the economy of the pilgrim-dependent                shrine towns.       In
1772, the same year that Shaykh Yusuf passed away, a cata-
strophic    plague epidemic raced through Iraq, claiming hun-
dreds of thousands of lives,             perhaps a quarter of a million
in Bagdad alone.61           The existence     of the shrines       of the

Imams as pilgrimage         sites   contributed     tQ frequent epidemics
in Iraq, especially          as Shi'is    often transported        corpses to
them for reburial.62            Towns that became depopulated           immedi-
ately attracted        Bedouin raids and further destruction.                The
Mamluk ruler 'Umar Pasha therefore               attempted to keep people
in the cities        during the plague, which lasted for some
eighteen    months.63

How to respond to the epidemic became an issue among
the Shi'i clergy as well,           since many of them were morally
and financially        attached to their shrines        and convinced of
the divine protection          they offered.      Bihbahani and his
chief disciples        did their utmost to clear people from the
festering     urban centers,       in defiance    of 'Umar Pasha.    Aqa
MuhammadBaqir strictly            enjoined his son Aqa MuhammadcAli
to flee Kazimayn for Iran.             The latter   only reluctantly
complied,     settling     for the rest of his life       in Kermanshah,
near the Iraqi border.64             Sayyid cAli Tabataba'i     supported
his mentor's stance with the hadith report,               "Greet not ob-

livion   with your own hands.",65         Sayyid MuhammadMihdi Taba-
taba'i    took his family out of Najaf through Isfahan to

Mashhad during the plague,         teaching  and giving diplomas         in
Isfahan and Khurasan until         his return in 1779.66

This firm commitment to fleeing            the plague preserved
the lives of many in Bihbahani's           circle,    spreading his ideas
to urban centers       in Iran as his relatives        and students     scat-
tered there.      The loss of life      in Iraq in 1772-73        was  monu-
mental.     The Sunni cleric      as-Suwaydi taught a class of a
thousand students        at a mosque in Basra before the plague
reached there,      then fled to Kuwait.         On his return a few
months later,     when the epidemic had subsided,           he found that
everyone who had attended his class was dead.                The toll in
the shrine cities       was equally high.67         The Akhbari Arab na-
tives of Karbala and Najaf may have found it less easy to
leave suddenly than the Iranian Usulis with their inter-
national    contacts,     exposing them to heavier casualties           from
the disease.      Moreover,     the  former   social   order   of  the
shrine cities     could not help but be disrupted           by so immense
a catastrophe,      allowing    Bihbahani's    young Usuli cadres to
move into the power and culture vacuum upon their return.

The impact Bihbahani's   movement had in Iran in the
Zand period may be witnessed      in the careers of such clerics
as Mulla MuhammadMihdi Niraqi and Mulla MuhammadRiza
Tabrizi.    Niraqi (d. 1794) was born near Kashan and studied
in Isfahan with the theologian      Isma'il   Khaju'i (d. 1759).
He then   went  to  Karbala, probably   during  the governmental
interregnum of the 1750s, studying with Shaykh Yusuf al-
Bahrani.    When Bihbahani returned to Karbala Niraqi changed
his allegiance     to the Usuli teacher.     He then settled  in
Kashan, where he was writing on commercial law for merchants
and in defense of Usuli jurisprudence        in the years 1766-72.68

Tabrizi   (d. 1793) also stayed for a long while in
Iraq,   studying   with MuhammadMihdi al-Fatuni          and Aqa Muham-
mad Baqir Hizarjaribi.        He, like so many others,          went over
to Bihbahani in the 1760s.          He thereafter    returned to Tabriz,
where he led prayers and gave sermons.             After a visitation
to the shrine at Mashhad, he made his way to the Zand capi-
tal of Shiraz in the south.          He became close to Karim Khan
Zand, who appointed       him military    judge (qadi-.Caskar).       The
Zands,    though  ungenerous   to   the  lower   ranks  of  clerics   and
religious     mendicants,   were open-handed with the high ulama,
building    mosques and living      quarters for them in Shiraz.69
When the Zand state declined         after 1779 Tabrizi returned to

Iraq.70   In Kermanshah during        the Zand period Bihbahani's
son Aqa MuhammadCAli--another          product of the Usuli revival--
became extremely  influential,        intermarrying  with the notable
class there.71

The new mood in the shrine cities  was epitomized    by
Bihbahani's  student Shaykh Jacfar b. Khidr an-Najafi     (d.
1812), who later authored the Kashf al-ghita'    in refuta-
tion of Akhbarism:

> The hair of his head and beard was already white
> in his youth.       He was a big man of high aspirations
> and sublime courage, with great strength          of intel-
> lect and insight.         He had a strong appetite    for
> licit    sex (al-ankihah)     and food, and for establish-
> ing links with kings and rulers for the sake of the
> religious    benefits     he believed  to lie therein.72

The Usuli revival    was, in Iranian terms, a largely      Zand-
period phenomenon which the Qajars came to support later
on.    In the shrine cities   themselves   the Usuli victory   co-
incided with the rise of local Shi'i power and the decline
of central   Ottoman control,    such that Usuli principles    like
the holding of Shi'i congregational       prayers could be imple-
mented, something the Ottomans had not tolerated        when their
hand in Iraq was firmer.

The   First   North   Indian    Usuli   Disciples

The degree to which the Usuli school dominated the
shrine cities   of Iraq at the end of the 1770s is demonstrated
by the memoirs of an Indian student and pilgrim,            Sayyid
Dildar cAli Nasirabadi    (1753-1820).       Nasirabadi    brought
with him from the Shi'i-ruled     nawabate of Awadh (Oudh) a
copy of MuhammadAmin Astarabadi's         al-Fawa'id    al-madaniyyah,
a work hugely popular among Shi'i thinkers           in North India.
Written nearly two centuries     earlier,      this major statement
of the Akhbari creed attacked      such classical      Usuli writers
as Hasan ibn al-Mutahhar al-Hilli.

Sayyid Dildar cAli and his companion landed at plague-
> and war-devastated    Basra, proceeding up the Euphrates by
> boat.73    During this long boat journey Nasirabadi   made
> friends   with an Arab Shi'i,  also en route to Najaf, where

he had just begun his studies       with Shaykh JaCfar an-Najafi.

Their discussions      came around to the principles    of jurispru-
dence,.    Nasirabadi   supported the Akhbari position,    while his
Arab friend took the side of the Usulis.         The Indian criti-
cized Usuli acceptance      of consensus among scholars     as an
independent     source of Shi i law, asking why something should
be true simply because large numbers of persons believed            it.
He also attacked Usulis for believing       in ra'y, or the ex-
ercise   of independent    judgment by the jurisprudent.      In this
discussion    Sayyid Dildar cAli first    encountered   the now
largely    Usuli atmosphere of the shrine cities,     finding    it
disturbing.   74

After performing visitation       to the shrine of Imam cAli,
Sayyid Dildar CAli met with the scholar Sayyid Muhsin Baghdadi

(d. 1810s/1230s),     who wrote on the principles        of jurispru-
dence and became the prayer leader in Kazimayn.75               Nasirabadi
remarked on the fact that most North Indian'Shi'i               ulama,
including     himself,   were Akhbaris.     The Iraqi replied      that
this was owing to their unfamiliarity          with Usuli works.        He
then gave him a refutation        of Astarabadi's     opus.     Sayyid
Dildar CAli read it, but the book left his doubts unresolved.
He next met with Shaykh Jacfar an-Najafi,            discussing    whether
scholarly     consensus can constitute      a proof in jurisprudence.
Nasirabadi     left dissatisfied.     Later, he again brought up
this matter with Baghdadi,who upheld the Usuli view that
consensus does indeed constitute         a source of law.        Sayyid
Dildar CAli listened       and grew quiet,    deciding    that if he
insisted     on arguing these points with his teachers           it would
be impossible      to learn anything.     The important scholars        in
Iraq at that time were apparently         Usulis,    and he had little
choice but to attempt to benefit         from them.

Nasirabadi  shifted   north to Karbala, studying the oral
reports from the Imams with Aqa MuhammadBaqir Bihbahani,
then 75, and law with Sayyid cAli Tabataba?i and Mirza Mihdi
Shahristani   (the latter   having himself been to India).         In
spite of his silence     on the issue,   his reputation    as an
Akhbari followed him to Karbala, where Sayyid cAli once em-
barrassed him in front of an Indian nobleman by stressing
his debt to the mujtahids.       Sayyid Dildar cAli determined
to throw himself   into an intensive     study of Usuli works,
as they were the ones difficult       to find in India.     He began
survey reading on the issue of the validity         of those oral
reports that were related     by only a single    transmitter    in

each early generation      (khabar al-ahad).76      After much study
of the classical    writers    Sayyid Dildar CAli began to feel
that Astarabadi's    position    on this issue was indefensible.
Within a few months of his arrival         in Iraq, he adopted the
Usuli school,    one factor surely being that this ideology
was in vogue at the prestigious        centers   of Shi'i scholar-
ship.  He later attributed       his change of views to his prox-
imity at that point to the holy tombs of the Imams.77

When Sayyid MuhammadMihdi Tabataba'i               returned to
Iraq, Nasirabadi,       who had heard him praised as virtually
sinless    (macsum),    sought him out and studied with him brief-
ly.     He pointed out to his teacher that in the Usuli system
a believer     must either be a mujtahid himself,              or he must
emulate a living       mujtahid.     But, he continued,         the Shilis
of India were deprived of any opportunity                for either,       so
that they might land in perdition.             Tabataba'i       replied     that
this was not at all the case.            The Shilis      in India, he main-
tained,    must simply practice       caution    (ihtiyat),       following
the strictest      of the major positions       on any matter of law.
Nasirabadi     riposted    that Majlisi     I once said that the most
cautious    position    was not always the correct one.                Sayyid
MuhammadMihdi answered that such instances                  were rare.78
Sayyid Dildar CAli's dissatisfaction            with the practice           of
caution as a solution         to the dilemma of Indian Usulis sug-
gests that even then he saw the need for religious                     leader-
ship that would result          from the spread of Usulism in Awadh.

Nasirabadi    had great difficulty   being taken seriously
as a scholar because of his Indian background,         some Iranian
students    insisting    that there simply were no ulama in India.
They found the very thought of an Indian mujtahid absurd,
given that only three scholars        at the shrine cities  were
recognized     exemplars.

After about a year and a half,    Sayyid Dildar cAli re-
turned to India overland via Kazimayn, Tehran, and Mashhad,
wintering    in Khurasan and studying with Mirza Muhammad
Mihdi Mashhadi (who was later killed      by an Afsharid scion
of Nadir Shah).     On arriving   in Lucknow he met with Awadh
First Minister    Hasan Riza Khan and had an interview     with
Nawab Asafu'd-Dawlah.       In 1781 he began teaching   and writing

> in Lucknow, producing a wide-ranging      attack on Akhbari ideas
> and beginning   the task of training   a new generation   of Shi'i
> scholars   in Usuli sciences.

Sayyid Dildar CAli's experiences          demonstrate     that in
1779 Usuli jurisprudence         already dominated most intellectu-
al circles     in Iraq.      His adoption of that school and his
transmission     of it to North India paralleled           a similar
process among other Shi'i pilgrim-students              from Iran, Af-
ghanistan,     and elsewhere     in Iraq.     By virtue of their cen-
trality    to Shi'i pilgrimage       and higher education,       the
shrine cities      exercised    extraordinary    influence     on intel-
lectual    currents    elsewhere    in the Shi'i world.

The questions      asked at the beginning of this essay
can now be answered, if not with complete satisfaction,
then at least provisionally.            The evidence does not support
the belief     that Akhbari religious         and legal doctrines        dom-
inated the religious         establishment     in Iran during the
eighteenth     century;     they certainly     did not prevail       in
major centers       like Isfahan.      Akhbarism, or at least con-
servative     jurisprudence      based closely      on the Imami oral
reports,    was popular in the Iraqi shrine cities               long be-
fore the eighteenth         century.     Iranian immigrants to Iraq
during the turbulent         period 1722-1763,       adhering to Usulism,
may have come to resent this situation               more than had pre-
viously    been the case.        But the real change was not a sud-
den Akhbari dominance in Iraq; rather,               it was an influx of
Usuli-inclined        Iranians   into  the   shrine    cities.    These
Iranians temporarily         adopted the Akhbarism of their Iraqi
hosts,.but     reverted     to Usulism in the 1760s.           The Usuli
dominance of the shrine cities            came, not at the end of the
century with the rise of the Qajars, but in the 1760s and
1770s during the Zand era in Iran.

Given Usuli dominance in Iran, the fall of the shrine
cities  of Iraq to this clerical  ideology  meant the elimina-
tion of one of Akhbarism's last strongholds.     From the
shrine cities,  with their complex network of pilgrimage
and study that linked them to the rest of the Shi'i world,
Usuli ideas then spread to distant    areas like North India.

Usulism emerged as the favored ideology       of the shrine
cities   at a time when the central  Ottoman empire had de-
clined and even the Mamluk vassal state grew extremely weak
and little   able to control the Shi'i cities     firmly.   Local
elites   came to prominence in these city-states,      composed of
Arab landowners,   Arab and Iranian ulama, and gangster bosses.
Usulism, with its emphasis on the leading role of the re-

ligious  scholars    in generally representing   the absent Imam
and serving as exemplars for lay believers,       resonated with
the increasing    local power possessed    by the Imami ulama in
the shrine cities.

These developments       appear also to be related        to state
formation in Qajar Iran and in Nawabi Awadh: the ruling
classes   in both regimes favored Usulism.             Usulism, with
its doctrine     that the ulama can legitimate          Friday prayers
(said,   in fact,    in the name of the secular ruler)          and its
position    on state-related       functions    such as defensive    holy
war, proved more amenable to the needs of the rising                rulers
in Iran and North India.           Conservative     Akhbarism, in which
most state-related       functions     of Islamic government were
considered     lapsed in the absence of the Imam, could not
fulfill    state needs for legitimation          nearly as well.     In
the nineteenth      century,    Akhbarism virtually      disappeared    as
a major school of Shi'ism,           and only Usulis were left to
write the history       of what had happened.
