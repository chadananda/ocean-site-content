        BAHÁ’Í-INSPIRED PERSPECTIVES ON HUMAN RIGHTS

Human Rights and the Rights of the Child

Human Rights and the Rights of the Child:
Implications for Children’s Participation

in the Bahá’í Community

BY GREG DULY

Although subject to the criticism of promoting “…a certain culturally spe-
cific ‘Western’ model,…”1 international human rights, both in conceptual and
legislative terms, is gaining increasing importance as a normative framework
for the guidance and protection of humankind.2 Nevertheless, the validity of
the universality of human rights, particularly as set forth in the Universal Dec-
laration of Human Rights (UDHR) developed in 19483, is potentially under-
mined by questions about its provenance (i.e. having been established by a
small group of mostly Western nations) and perceptions of cultural insensitiv-
ity.4

In regard to children’s rights, however, these criticisms are significantly
diminished. Children’s rights are enshrined in the United Nations Convention
on the Rights of the Children (CRC) which was adopted unanimously by the UN
General Assembly in November 1989. In contrast to the UDHR, the consulta-
tive process that resulted in the CRC occurred over a ten-year period and
involved all members States of the United Nations. Importantly, between 1989
and 1999, the CRC was ratified by all but two countries—Somalia and the United
States of America. Thus, theoretically, at least, the CRC, as a conceptual frame-
work and legal instrument, should have legitimate claim to a universally ac-
cepted set of principles, norms and standards. Notwithstanding this achievement
questions remain. Less so regarding the issue of the universality of the CRC
and its broad intent than with its implementation at country level where the
norms and standards embodied in it encounter local cultural values and atti-
tudes about children that would appear to diverge from the intent of the Con-
vention.

Human Rights and the Rights of the Child

Whilst the international debate surrounding children’s rights may appear
remote and esoteric to national and local Bahá’í communities, recent messages
from the Universal House of Justice 5 regarding the role of children in commu-
nity life strikes a resonant chord with the current global focus on children’s
rights hence necessitating an examination of the ethics and principles under-
pinning these rights instruments and their relevance to the process of carrying
“…forward an ever-advancing civilization” 6 as well as the ultimate goal of the
Bahá’í Faith—the unity of the human race. To this end, this paper will explore
several key human rights issues of relevance to the Bahá’í community.

First, the author will investigate the issue of the universality of rights in
light of criticism from cultural relativists. Second, the author will endeavour to
resolve concerns about the secular nature of rights instruments by exploring
the possibility that human and children’s rights may, in fact, have spiritual, or
religious influences. Finally, the paper will look more specifically at the rel-
evance of child rights and prospects of children’s participation in the Bahá’í
community. Whilst the author will offer suggestions regarding the implications
to the Bahá’í community of a rights orientation, it should be noted that this paper
is not intended to present a definitive statement on this subject. Rather, it is the
author’s hope that this paper will provoke thought and contribute to an on-going
examination of the significance of the messages from the Universal House of
Justice and international child rights instruments concerning the historical rela-
tionships between adults and children, institutions and children, as well as the
prescriptive and traditional attitudes about the roles and responsibilities chil-
dren can undertake in the Bahá’í community in the pursuit of world unity.

The Universality of Human Rights: A Universal Truth or Cultural
Imperialism?

> Bahá’u’lláh taught that an equal standard of human rights must be recognized and adopted.
> In the estimation of God all men are equal; there is no distinction or preferment for any
> soul in the dominion of His justice and equity.7

Between 1853 and 1892, the Founder of the Bahá’í Faith, Bahá’u’lláh, issued a
series of Tablets and Letters that, when taken together, could be regarded as an
embryonic form of a human rights charter. One of the underlying conceptions
of Bahá’u’lláh’s implied rights framework is the principle of universality. Cor-
respondingly, the concept and indeed the feasibility of human rights 8 as a nor-
mative framework, particularly as expressed in the UDHR, rests upon this

Human Rights and the Rights of the Child

same principle—a presumption of universality. That is to say, the principles,
standards and norms proclaimed in the Declaration are shared by all members
of the human family regardless of race, religion, gender, nationality, socio-
cultural status, and so forth. This issue of the universality of human rights is
extremely significant as “…there can be no prospect of the universal applica-
tion of [human] rights unless there is, at least, substantial agreement on their
concept, scope and content.”9 The principal of universality is supported by two
underlying concepts: a) an aspirational aspect, i.e. that all peoples of the world
share a desire for and a belief in these rights, and b) an entitlement component,
i.e. that all people are entitled to these rights and that this entitlement—a ter-
minology incorporating both moral and legal considerations—is a function of
one’s membership in the human race.

Unsurprisingly, the claim of universality of human rights is challenged by
“…some real skepticism.”10 Economist and Nobel Laureate, Amartya Sen, pos-
tulates that this scepticism can be grouped into three basic categories: the le-
gitimacy critique, the coherence critique, and the cultural critique.11 Whilst all
three critiques are relevant to the principle of universality, the analysis of this
paper will focus on the cultural critique in that cultural relativists are among the
strongest critics of the universality principle.

The claims of the cultural relativists regarding the purported lack of uni-
versality of human rights revolve around the following themes: a) limited par-
ticipation in the development of the UDHR, b) a disproportionate emphasis on
Western libertarian notions about individual autonomy without due regard for
the value of collective social responsibility, and c) the secular tone of the
Declaration and the human rights discourse that appears to devalue the role of
religion as a social force and as a source of individual inspiration and content-
ment.

Limited participation in the development of the UDHR refers to the fact
that at the time the Declaration was proclaimed (1948) only 58 countries partici-
pated in the dialogue and of these only 48 assented to its adoption. 12 The critics
argue that since the Declaration had been drawn up without their participation
it cannot be considered truly universal.13 In response, human rights apologists
such as Dato’ Param Cumaraswamy, the Chairman of the Law Association for
Asia and the Pacific Standing Committee on Human Rights, point out that de-
spite the fact that the majority of the current member States of the United Na-
tions did not participate in the drafting and adoption of the Universal Declaration
in 1948, it should be “…realised that the… declaration came under close scru-
tiny as recently as 199314 [at the World Conference on Human Rights in Vienna]
and was reaffirmed by 171 member States.” … These States adopted by consen-

Human Rights and the Rights of the Child

sus the Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action, which [confirmed that]…
‘The universal nature of these rights and freedoms is beyond question.’”15

Whilst the Bahá’í Faith is a proponent of the principle of universality, it
does not argue its case in a manner that dichotomises the universality and rela-
tivist discourses. Although the universality of human rights is a foundational
principle, the Bahá’í Faith acknowledges the validity of certain relativist argu-
ments. Promoting universality without recognising bona fide culturally specific
values and norms would be akin to proposing a global form of cultural homo-
geneity or uniformity. Clearly, the Bahá’í position straddles the two worldviews
in a way that could be interpreted as ambiguous and non-committal. This inter-
pretation would be incorrect, however, as explicated by Shoghi Effendi 16 in
the following citation:

> Far from aiming at the subversion of the existing foundations of society, it17 seeks to
> broaden its basis, to remold its institutions in a manner consonant with the needs of an
> ever-changing world. It can conflict with no legitimate allegiances, nor can it undermine
> essential loyalties. Its purpose is neither to stifle the flame of a sane and intelligent patrio-
> tism in men’s hearts, nor to abolish the system of national autonomy so essential if the evils
> of excessive centralization are to be avoided. It does not ignore, nor does it attempt to
> suppress, the diversity of ethnical origins, of climate, of history, of language and tradition,
> of thought and habit, that differentiate the peoples and nations of the world. It calls for a
> wider loyalty, for a larger aspiration than any that has animated the human race. It insists
> upon the subordination of national impulses and interests to the imperative claims of a
> unified world. It repudiates excessive centralization on one hand, and disclaims all at-
> tempts at uniformity on the other. Its watchword is unity in diversity…18

The reference to the primacy of individual autonomy pertains to notions
about individual rights and freedoms as contrasted against, according to the
relativists, the norms of other cultures that place high value on the concepts of
collective responsibility (to the family, to the community, and to the state),
loyalty, and discipline.19 Whilst this reasoning is compelling, both Cumaraswamy
and Sen present two persuasive counter arguments. The first is that the “West-
ern values” argument is most frequently made by the leaders of authoritarian
institutions (e.g. both governmental and traditionalist religious bodies) who
could be said to have a vested interest in diminishing the importance of indi-
vidual human rights. Indeed, Cumaraswamy contends that these authority fig-
ures do not accurately represent the aspirations of their people who support
the principle of the universality.20 Regarding the second argument, Sen posits
that in order for the relativists’ claims to hold true one should not be able find
historical evidence of individual rights and freedom as value system in these

cultures. This, however, is disproved by Sen who presents multiple examples
to the contrary. “In sum,” according to a report on the Ramsey Colloquium, “…an
integrated reading of the Declaration makes clear that it is neither individual-
istic nor statist, but a charter of rights for the flourishing of persons in commu-
nity.”21

A Bahá’í perspective on this particular issue is instructive. Bahá’í literature
suggests that the concepts of the rights of the individual and the rights of the
collective (family, community, nation) are not mutually exclusive. Indeed, it
would appear that they are mutually reinforcing as the following citations dem-
onstrate:

> The integrity of the family bond must be constantly considered, and the rights of the
> individual members must not be transgressed.22
> Concern that each human being should enjoy the freedom of thought and action conducive
> to his or her personal growth does not justify devotion to the cult of the individual that so
> deeply corrupts many areas of contemporary life. Nor does concern to ensure the welfare
> of society as a whole require a deification of the State as the supposed source of humanity’s
> well-being.… Only in a consultative framework made possible by the consciousness of
> the organic unity of humankind can all aspects of the concern for human rights find legiti-
> mate and creative expression.… Since the body of humankind is one and indivisible, each
> member of the race is born into the world as a trust of the whole.23

In reference to the secular nature of human rights deliberations, the concern
here is that whilst mention is made to the freedom of worship in the Universal
Declaration,24 the contemporary discourse is conducted in a form and a manner
that appears to diminish the role of religion as a social force and religious
tenets as normative frameworks. This subject will be discussed at greater length
in the following section.

In summary, the author endeavoured to examine the pivotal yet contentious
issue of the universality of human rights and concluded that the concept has been
subjected to sufficient debate as to permit the human race to accept that:

> All human rights are universal, indivisible and interdependent and interrelated. [And that]
> The international community must treat human rights globally in a fair and equal manner on
> the same footing and with the same emphasis. While the significance of national and
> regional particularities and various historical, cultural and religious backgrounds must be
> borne in mind, it is the duty of States, regardless of their political, economic and cultural
> systems, to promote and protect all human rights and fundamental freedoms.25

Equally, the author posited that the inherent tensions between the principle
of universality and cultural relativists need not be dichotomised by rights pro-
moters, world and religious leaders, and civil society. Rather, they should en-
courage a dialectic that will, through a consultative process, achieve coherence
and unity of thought on this issue.

Human rights - An expression of spiritual values?

One of the ironies of the human rights debate is that the concept is largely
perceived to have originated in a context of Western secular liberalism. 26 This
perception is aided by the fact that the contemporary rights discourse is influ-
enced by classical modernism and a positivist interpretation of the philosophy
of natural law.27 On the contrary, religious contributions to the development of
human rights concepts are historically rather significant and quite direct. This
connection can be traced to the development of natural law which is widely
accepted to be the precursor to the concept of human rights. Whilst worldviews
about natural law have been heavily influenced by Hobbesian thought (e.g. the
notion that, motivated purely by self-interest, human beings agree to give up
their more unsociable freedoms in exchange for peace), there is evidence
establishing its numinous qualities. Thomas Aquinas, for example, asserted that
“natural law is a special subset of the divine law which pertains to moral behaviour,
and is accessible to everyone through reason - including unbelievers.28 Enlight-
enment philosophers, such as Grotius, Pufendorf, Locke, Clarke, and Paley ac-
knowledged that the will of God, as our Creator, becomes the highest natural
law and that “…our moral duties arise from this mandate and, in turn, these
moral duties lead to civil and international laws.”29

This belief system is not limited to Christian philosophers and theologians.

Islam and Judaism also subscribe to a belief in a “…universal moral law rooted
in the righteousness of God…” and the principle that “[s]ince human beings are
created in the image of God and loved by him [sic] as individuals each is worthy
of dignity and respect.” Furthermore, with reference to the UDHR itself,
Damien Keown, a scholar of Indian Religion, submits that “…each of the thirty
articles of the Universal Declaration shows them to be in harmony with early
Buddhist teachings both in letter and in spirit.”30

Bahá’í scripture contains numerous references to human rights. Not only do
Bahá’í writings attribute a spiritual or divine source for human rights, Bahá’u’lláh,
proffered many formulations on the subject of rights that, as already mentioned,
could be regarded as a notional basis for a Human Rights Charter, as well as an
international code of conduct, and a legal framework for human rights adminis-
tration. Examples of these writings include, inter alia, the Kitáb-i-Aqdas (The

Book of Laws), Bishár’at (Glad Tidings), Tarázát, (Ornaments), Tajallíyát
(Effulgences), and Kalimát-i-Firdawsíyyih (Words of Paradise).31 Due to the
vastness of the body of His work, a reproduction of these and other writings of
Bahá’u’lláh are beyond the scope of this paper.32 Briefly, however, the rights
principals articulated in His works are echoed in many of the concepts and
principles enshrined in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and other
rights instruments. Examples include, inter alia: the inherent nobility of human
beings, the equality of humankind, the protection of the rights of any member
of the human race, the equality of women and men (and the importance of edu-
cating women), the protection of minority rights, the right to independently
investigate Truth, the harmony of science and religion, religious harmony and
tolerance, the elimination of poverty, and the establishment of international
structures and regulatory institutions endowed with the mandate to establish
and ensure human security and world peace. The essence of Bahá’u’lláh’s writ-
ings on these subjects has been provided in summary form by His eldest son,
‘Abdu’l-Bahá 33 and is provided in Annex I, although interested readers are en-
couraged to seek the original texts.

Establishing the spiritual origins of human rights is a matter of some conse-
quence. If the human rights discourse is bound to a positivist, or modernist,
paradigm, humanity’s capacity to fully actualise the potential inherent in rights
concepts is likely to be circumscribed. If Hobbes’ self-interest postulate is to
be accepted as the norm, what motivation is there for humanity to internalise
and acts in ways that respects the UDHR’s pivotal principle of inherent human
dignity? Surely, a resigned compliance to international law will not create so-
cial norms wherein human rights flourish and human beings will live in a world
characterised by sustainable peace, security and co-operation in the truest sense
of these terms. An awareness of the divine source of human rights and indeed
life itself “…endows us with the capacity for self-transcendence.”34 In other
words, a willingness to freely commit one’s self to the types of personal and
social behaviour required to make the world truly peaceful and secure. Speak-
ing to the issue of the spiritual origins of human rights, Vaclav Havel contends
that :

> “Politicians at international forums may reiterate a thousand times that the basis of the
> new world order must be universal respect for human rights, but it will mean nothing as
> long as this imperative does not derive from the respect of the miracle of Being… Only
> someone who submits to the authority of the universal order and of creation… can genu-
> inely value himself and his neighbours, and thus honor their rights as well.” 35

This is a sentiment which reinforces ‘Abdu’l-Bahá ‘s assertion that :

> All who hold fast to the one reality will be in agreement and unity. Then shall the religions
> summon people to the oneness of the world of humanity and to universal justice; then will
> they proclaim equality of rights and exhort men to virtue and to faith in the loving mercy of
> God.36

In light of An-Na’im’s argument that “…there can be no prospect of the uni-
versal application of [human] rights unless there is, at least, substantial agree-
ment on their concept, scope and content” 37 the recognition of the sacred origins
of human rights carries with it significant implications for overcoming the di-
chotomy between the so-called secular and relativist worldviews. What can, in
the final analysis, galvanise the requisite unity of thought and purpose in a world
riven by factionalism, fanaticism, materialism, militant nationalism, secularism,
racial and gender bigotry, ecclesiasticism, and scepticism? If the solution were
merely an acknowledgement of the divine nature of human rights, what then has
prevented the religions of the world from overcoming the barriers to human
security? It would appear, historically at least, that religions have approached
the rights dialogue from a particularist perspective, i.e. some religious lead-
ers have fuelled the relativist arguments either out of self-interest or due to
the lack of a vision of humanity that could transcend their respective orthodox-
ies. The Bahá’í writings, however, suggest that the recognition of the divine
origins of human rights can indeed create a powerful tool for achieving human
security and engaging “the world’s population in assuming responsibility for its
collective destiny” when conducted within a “consciousness of the oneness of
humankind.”38

The fact that this consciousness is emerging among the world’s religions can
be attested to by the development of a document known as the Declaration
towards a Global Ethic which is grounded in the conviction of the fundamental
unity of the human family and a belief that a common set of core values can be
found in the teachings of all the world major religions. Many of the principles
contained in the Declaration concern human rights. Additionally, the Declara-
tion considers the universal recognition of human rights and human dignity by
the religions of the world as the cornerstone of a “new global order.”39 An
excerpt from this Declaration is reproduced in Annex II.

Clearly, providing sufficient empirical evidence to demonstrate the sacred
nature of human rights is a challenge of immense proportions. Whilst eminent
persons such as Vaclav Havel assert that human rights are endowed by God,
secular human rights activists argue, on the other hand, that placing respect for
human rights and faith in God into the same concept violates one of the tenets of
human rights e.g. the right to deny the existence of God. This paper submits,
though, that the secular and religious perceptions are essentially compatible on

this point. Whilst activists express this right as the freedom to choose one’s
belief system (including atheism), the Founders of the world’s major religions
articulate this right as free will, or agency. In other words, the decision to
accept the existence of God must be voluntary and borne from informed aware-
ness and rational thought rather than blind faith. This concept receives compre-
hensive treatment in the Bahá’í writings.

In conclusion, the author argues that respect for human rights will be strength-
ened through a recognition of two basic concepts. First, that human rights are
God-given rights and, secondly, a consciousness of the organic oneness of the
human race. These concepts will enable humanity to transcend both the secular
paradigm that can alienate the “…billions of people who structure their daily
routines around spiritual practices…” and to free humanity from the traditional
religious practices that many suspect of particularism and power abuse.40 The
spiritual origins of human rights suggests important implications for under-
standing the potential roles and responsibilities for children in their personal
development as well as development of community life; a point that will be
explored in the following section of this paper.

Children’s Rights: A Consensus Enshrined in the Convention on the Rights of
the Child

One of the many implications of the principle of the universality of human
rights is that children are also rights holders with entitlements as well as capabilities
and responsibilities to act as agents of social change. Whilst this may seem
self-evident in this day and age, an historical examination reveals rather shock-
ing attitudes towards children over the years. In European societies of the
eighteenth Century, for example, children were deemed to be property of
their parents. Dr. Judith Ennew, a member of the Centre for Family Research at
Cambridge University, observes that :

> [I]n England, child abduction was not theft in the legal sense unless the child happened to
> be dressed. The thief was regarded as having stolen the clothes. Apart from that, child theft
> was tantamount to stealing a corpse. In the case of both a dead body and a live child, no
> legal person was involved.41

Three hundred years later the litany of violations against and deprivations
of children continues to make depressing reading: (a) some 600,000 million
children live in households that earn less than $1 per day; (b) more than 110
million children of primary-school age are not enrolled in school; (c) during

the 1990s more than 8 million children were either permanently disabled,
seriously injured or died as a result of armed conflict; (d) as of the year 2000,
over 300,000 children have been recruited to participate in armed conflicts;
and (e) an estimated 100 million children work in dangerous circumstance e.g.
bonded labour, prostitution & pornography.42 Clearly, these horrific conditions
place upon us, as citizens of the world, an obligation to ensure that children’s
rights are realised, a responsibility that includes providing children with a
voice and a means for affecting change on matters concerning their well being.

Likewise, a recognition of the divine heritage of human rights carries with
it significant meaning with respect to the role of children in the realisation of
humanity’s collective spiritual destiny which is, according to Bahá’í teachings,
the organic unity of humankind.43

Children’s rights are enshrined in the UN Convention on the Rights of the
Child (CRC) which was adopted by the UN General Assembly in 1989. The
CRC is the most widely ratified international Convention in history (191 coun-
tries). Only Somalia and the USA are not party to the treaty.44 The CRC is
underpinned by four fundamental principles (viz. (1) equal value and rights of
all children and the prohibition of discrimination (Article 2); (2) the best inter-
ests of the children (Article 3); (3) the right of the child to life, survival and
development (Articles 4 & 6); and (4) the right to freely express views and to
be heard (Articles 12 & 13). This paper will examine the theoretical relevance
and practical ramifications of the Convention to Bahá’í community life and the
overall aims of the Bahá’í Faith.

Children’s Participation: Definition and Debate

Children’s participation is attracting growing attention from a multitude of
academics and practitioners alike. An explanation for this interest lies in the
ontological presumption that children possess capabilities and are seen as full
human beings (i.e. they are not people who only become fully human when they
become adults; a world view of some considerable prevalence). The CRC
recognises that children are not mere dependants, the property of parents or
guardians.45 Children are increasingly competent and are genuinely interested
in what is going on around them, especially that which affects them. Whilst they
are in need of protection they have strengths. This presumption includes the
notion that children’s views and opinions are significant and are the by-product
of their capability to reflect, analyse and consider consequences. From this
perspective, children and youth, when encouraged, become agents of social
change, active and involved citizens in society, to the extent of their individual

and collective developing capacities, maturity and competence.46 Early research
in this area would appear to validate this hypothesis.

Gillian Mann, a researcher on care and protection of separated children at
the Refugee Studies Centre in the UK, invokes a broad denotation of participa-
tion as “taking part in a social process.”47 With specific reference to children’s
participation, though, Mann defines it as:

> …the process of children’s involvement in the decisions which affect them and the com-
> munity in which they live. To be genuine and effective, it means listening to children and
> respecting their views and the way in which they choose to express them. It involves
> recognising and nurturing their strengths, interests and abilities through the provision of
> meaningful opportunities to contribute to their own development and that of their peers,
> families and communities. In this way, child participation encourages reciprocal learning
> between children and adults as well as the establishment of respectful horizontal relation-
> ships across generations.48

Mann’s definition is very helpful in that it describes, in clear terms, the
developmental processes and outcomes associated with child participation. It
is also very useful due to the emphasis it places on self-actualising human po-
tential in contrast to the traditional view that external forces (e.g. parents, guard-
ians, teachers, etal) bear exclusive responsibility for the shaping and moulding
of a child’s character. Finally, Mann’s denotation incorporates the concepts of co-
operation, tolerance and mutual respect, concepts implied in her references to
“reciprocal learning” and “respectful horizontal relationships.”

As helpful as Mann’s definition is, this author proposes an alternative that is
meant to be more specifically relevant to the thesis of this paper in that it endeavours
to embody the aspects of spirituality and social transformation. For the purpose
of this paper, then, children’s participation refers to:

> Processes that empower children to take responsibility for their spiritual development, to
> foster a sense of moral purpose and pro-social attitudes in order to engage—to the extent
> of their individual and collective developing capacities and in an authentic manner—in
> actions, behaviour and forms of service that will contribute to social transformation
> characterised by unity, justice, co-operation, reciprocity, and mutual respect and helpful-
> ness.

Classic reactions to the concept of children’s participation range from out-
right scepticism to a concern “that children’s rights conflict with the rights of

parents and adults.”49 On the one hand, there are those who feel that the partici-
pation of children in community or state affairs is ludicrous; a cute but meaning-
less activity for which they have little capacity and that has no place in the “real”
world. Situated at another point on the spectrum are those adults who are threat-
ened by the notion of children’s rights and participation out of a fear of losing
control. In Uganda, for instance, many still hold the view that the reason for
children’s existence is the satisfaction of adult needs and interests.50

There are several possible rejoinders to these concerns, two of which will
be made here. The first and most obvious is that children’s participation is
established in international law as a legitimate, inalienable right, or entitle-
ment. There are, fortunately, several additional reasons that justify the impor-
tance of children’s participation that extend beyond the legal argument. Although
there are many justifications for children’s participation, Mann provides an ex-
cellent formulation. The advantages of authentic children’s participation, according

to Mann, manifest themselves in three distinct ways: (a) benefits to the child,
(b) benefits to the family, and (c) benefits to the community. The following
table summarises Mann’s thinking according by category:

Coincidentally, Mann’s categorisations—that is the manner in which the ben-
efits of children’s participation accrue not only to the child but to the family and
community as well—would seem to reinforce Bahá’í thought regarding the
interconnectedness of individual and societal development. As cited earlier, the
Bahá’í Faith seeks neither the “devotion of the cult of the individual” nor the “deifi-
cation of the State” but, rather, healthy and mutually supportive relationships be-
tween the constituent members of society deriving from a “…consultative
framework made possible by [a] consciousness of the organic unity of human-
kind…” In this sense, Mann’s analysis appears to bear out the truth of George
Bernard Shaw’s aphorism : “We are members of one another; so that you cannot
injure or help your neighbour without injuring or helping yourself.”

Effective Participation of Children: Exemplary Evidence

Despite the fact that the philosophy and practice of child participation is
still in an embryonic state there is growing empirical evidence demonstrating
that children’s participation can foster responsible behaviour and practice and
meaningful social change. In Budapest, for example, children between the ages
of ten and fifteen manage (with the exception of the engine driver) the Pioneer
Railway, a thirteen mile-long track carrying children and tourists on field trips
through scenic areas overlooking the Danube River.51 Children from five schools
in Rochdale, Lancashire conducted research, jointly with the local police force,
as part of the Rochale Safer Cities Programmes, on problems associated with
the security of the city’s elderly residents. This child-led research activity led
to recommendations for specific low-cost crime prevention measures for these
vulnerable citizens.52

The Greenlit programme in the UK is an intervention wherein children
between the ages of ten and thirteen submit proposals to companies for reno-
vating land damaged or neglected by businesses. Through a process of consul-
tation, the proposals are agreed then funded by the corporations. Children are
responsible for the full spectrum of activities—e.g. site surveys, analysis, de-
sign, costing and implementation of the project. 53 In Bolivia, Save the Children
Canada facilitates a project known as the “Leadership of Children in Integrated
Community Health.” Having identified health issues to be a major concern in
the communities, the children were then trained as community health promot-
ers in the concepts of traditional and modern medicine and provided with first
aid kits. “These children are now responsible for these kits in their communi-

ties. They alone are able to detect and resolve simple respiratory problems
and diarrheal disease, and clear up minor injuries.”54

During the recent Great Lakes Region Consultation on the Protection and
Development of Children Affected by Armed Conflict held in Kampala Uganda
in December 2000, five children from war torn Eastern Congo participated in
a workgroup session whose purpose was to allow the children, aged between
twelve and fifteen (two of whom had served in active combat with the brutal
local Mai-Mai rebels over a two year period) to identify the characteristics of
a good national or community leader. The characteristics identified by the chil-
dren were someone who is: loving, will give advice, not greedy, honest, clean
of body, respectful of others, sincere, and a unifier (i.e. someone who doesn’t
bring conflict). These are remarkable insights with profound implications for
systems of governance if we are to take these views seriously. Adult reaction
to the first characteristic (to be loving) was fascinating. The moment the term
was mentioned the adults interrupted in an attempt to convince the children that
the necessary qualities for leadership were to be strong, to be powerful and so
forth, characteristics typically associated with an authoritarian style of gover-
nance. Despite this intervention and after much debate, the children insisted
that “to be loving” was a vital quality for good leadership and continued to
itemise the other characteristics heretofore cited.55

Children in the Bahá’í Community: Prospects for Participation

A comparison between the Bahá’í writings and the CRC reveals remarkable
congruence in thought, intent and spirit concerning child rights and child devel-
opment. This is perhaps not surprising in light of the importance placed on
human rights by Bahá’u’lláh.

On the other hand, there are a number of Bahá’í laws that could be consid-
ered inconsistent with the CRC, although no value judgement is attributed to
either Bahá’í law or the CRC in making this observation. An example of this
concerns the age limit defining the status of a child. The Convention defines a
child as “every human being below the age of eighteen years unless under the
law applicable to the child, majority is attained earlier.” 56 The latter part of this
definition is in reference to country specific laws that may set an age limit lower
than eighteen. Bahá’í law uses the term “age of maturity” and sets this at fifteen
years. Fifteen is the age at which a person is deemed capable of making inde-
pendent decisions regarding one’s religious affiliation and other matters af-
fecting their spiritual development. It is the age at which, should one decide to
declare themselves a Bahá’í, an individual is required to assume responsibility

for observing Bahá’í law (e.g. fasting, prayer, etc.) and is the minimum age at
which marriage can occur.57

It is interesting to note, however, that whereas in most countries the age of
majority generally corresponds to other civic rights such as the right to vote,
within the Bahá’í Faith the age of maturity “…relates only to purely spiritual
functions and obligations and is not related to the degree of administrative
capacity…”58 Hence, the minimum voting age; a term referring both to one’s
eligibility to vote and to be voted for; is twenty-one. Service on elected Bahá’í
local and national administrative institutions (a form of service that approxi-
mates, in terms of mandate and scope, to the responsibilities of municipal coun-
cils and national governments) is another feature unique to the Bahá’í Faith.
Whilst in most countries the right to vote is applicable once an individual
reaches 18 years of age, the majority of the world’s nations set the eligible age
for service on municipal and nationally elected governing bodies much higher.
Voting rights in the Bahá’í community, on the other hand, carry with them both
the right and responsibility to vote and to serve on administrative institutions.

Despite the twenty-one year age restriction, Bahá’í youth are not prohibited
from participating on various committees, whether, national or local, and are, in
fact, strongly encouraged to engage in all aspects of Bahá’í work considering their
capabilities to be of “…great assistance to the Cause even though not yet le-
gally of age.” 59 Explanations as to why the minimum voting is set at twenty-one
are as yet sketchy but are no doubt, in the opinion of the author, strongly corre-
lated to a minimum level of maturity and life experience required to serve on
elected institutions which shoulder onerous responsibilities in the provision of guid-
ance and support to Bahá’í communities and individuals. Whilst the age of twenty-
one is currently applicable, it would appear that this age will be subject to
review. In His Directives of the Guardian, Shoghi Effendi indicates that voting
rights are fixed at twenty-one “…for the present.”60

Participation is central to the Bahá’í concept of a vibrant and healthy commu-
nity. Participation, in a Bahá’í social context, is a process whereby community
members are “…engaged in applying knowledge to create well-being, thereby
generating new knowledge and contributing in a substantial and meaningful
way to human progress.”61 Admittedly, however, whilst there is no evidence in
Bahá’í literature proscribing the participation of children in community affairs—
indeed, there are numerous examples of children making outstanding, even
heroic, contributions throughout Bahá’í history—these examples are the ex-
ception rather than the rule. The Universal House of Justice plainly states that:
“Even though children’s activities have been a part of past Plans, these have
fallen short of the need.”62

The November 26, 1999 and Ridvan 2000 messages63 from the Universal
House of Justice concerning children and junior youth suggest a fundamental
shift in our concept of the potential roles for these particular community mem-
bers as it concerns community life and the progress of the Faith. Referring to
children as the “…most precious treasure a community can possess…” and a
“…trust no community can neglect with impunity…,” the Universal House of
Justice calls upon individual believers and Bahá’í institutions alike to create a
cultural milieu in which children are “…thoroughly integrated into the process
of community development…,” and made to “…feel that they belong to the
community and share in its purpose.”64 As previously explicated, this sense of
belonging and purpose can be most effectively achieved through the use of
participatory approaches.

The messages from the Universal House of Justice suggest the need for the
Bahá’ís of the world to reflect on traditional attitudes, approaches, and relationships
regarding the role of children in their own spiritual development, their roles, re-
sponsibilities and capabilities in the development of Bahá’í community life, and
their potential for making contributions to the processes of social transformation
and world unity. “Creative attention must be devoted to involving them in
programmes of activity that will engage their interests, mold their capacities for
teaching and service, and involve them in social interaction with older youth.”65

Although the Universal House of Justice places considerable emphasis on
spiritual and academic educational training (e.g. children’s classes, study circles,
training institutes and other forms of scholastic training) as the bedrock upon
which a child’s development should rest, it would seem that this “represents
only a part of what must go into developing… the characters and shaping…
personalities” of children. 66 What then are examples of other ways in which
children can be thoroughly integrated into the process of community develop-
ment so as to feel a sense of belonging and purpose? The following are a few
of the author’s suggestions, all of which are provided with the stipulation that
the participation should be calibrated to the extent of the individual and col-
lective capacities of the children:
- The Nineteen Day Feast 67 : In practice, the role of children in the func-

> tioning of this young institution has been consigned to the periphery.
> Children attend, of course, the spiritual portion of the Feast and are oc-
> casionally requested to perform certain forms of service during the event
> (e.g. drama and music presentations; serving refreshments during the social
> segment), but these decisions and the manner in which they are carried
> out are made, for the most part, by adults on behalf of children. Yet, there
> would appear to be no prohibition against children participating in plan-
> ning Nineteen Day Feast programmes and schedules. This is an area of

> service for children that could be explored by Local Assemblies. Like-
> wise, the goal of thoroughly integrating children in the life of the com-
> munity presents a particular challenge to Local Assemblies as it implies
> a need to structure the administrative portion of the Feast in a manner
> that enables children to engage meaningfully in the consultations in a
> manner that would encourage them to present their views and to be as-
> sured that these views are taken seriously. Consideration should be given
> to the training of adults in the types of facilitation skills that foster
> children’s participation. As well, some sort of a systematic method could
> be developed to help children prepare themselves in advance for the
> consultative segment of the Feast.
- Appoint children as assistants to Auxiliary Board Members68: The ap-

> pointment of children to this role is rather unconventional, but an idea
> that has been implemented in certain countries. Not only would the prac-
> tice provide the Board Members with new perspectives, it should en-
> able these children to develop confidence, a healthy self-esteem, and a
> sense of identity and purpose. It would, moreover, provide them with
> opportunities to accelerate the development of skills and capabilities
> they will need to function as adult Bahá’ís.
- Committee appointments: Appointing children and junior youth to local

> and national committees is not a common practice within the Bahá’í com-
> munity. This is probably out of habit more than any other reason. Re-
> search, however, has shown that children can act responsibly and make
> important contributions when conditions are created for fostering their
> participation. Again, specific skill sets and structures might need to be
> developed in order to ensure their role is not limited to tokenistic
> gestures or that they are overwhelmed by adult opinion.
- Children and Junior Youth Projects: Children can be encouraged to plan,

> implement and reflect on projects of their own making. There is suffi-
> cient empirical evidence to demonstrate that children can work respon-
> sibly on service projects at levels of sophistication and complexity beyond
> the expectations of adults. In Kampala, Uganda, for example, as part of an
> on-going Bahá’í junior youth movement, Bahá’í children redesigned and
> installed a new visitors information display at the entrance of the Bahá’í
> House of Worship. An expansion of this concept is that children and
> junior youth can be encouraged, with the help of a skilled facilitator
> during the initial stages, to participate in formal analytical and planning
> sessions along with adults and to make presentations of their recommen-
> dations to the Local and National Assemblies.

- Social and Economic Development Projects: Bahá’í children should not

> merely be beneficiaries of social and economic development, or com-
> munity development, projects. As demonstrated in the section entitled
> “Effective Participation of Children: Exemplary Evidence,” children can
> play a central role in planning, implementing and evaluating a wide range
> of projects such as in the areas of primary health care, education and the
> environment, to name but a few. Since Bahá’í social and economic devel-
> opment projects are ultimately intended to benefit non-Bahá’ís as well
> as Bahá’ís, children’s participation would have the added advantage of
> providing Bahá’í children with opportunities to interact with the entire
> community (i.e. with non-Bahá’í community members) in an integrative
> and constructive way.
These are but a few of the possibilities that can be considered by Bahá’í
communities around the world. The purpose of this section was not to exhaust
all options but, rather, inspired by the Messages from the Universal House of
Justice, to provoke news ways of thinking about advancing the goal of integrat-
ing children into the life of the community and preparing them for a life of
service out of a selfless desire to be of service to humanity. The possibilities
are endless. What is required is a willingness to challenge accepted conven-
tions and attitudes concerning children and the roles they have historically been
assigned to play within the community.

Conclusion

This paper endeavoured to examine new concepts about the roles and re-
sponsibilities of children in the Bahá’í community, admittedly through a rather
circuitous, but nevertheless important, route. Through his exploration of the
universality of human rights, the author validated the claim for children—as
members of the human race and individuals in their own right—to access the
full spectrum of rights and responsibilities set forth in the UDHR and the CRC.
The author’s treatment of the spiritual origins of human rights and his review of
the Universal House of Justice’s messages on the subject of children and junior
youth sought to expand the Bahá’í community’s understanding of the nature of
and scope for children in assuming responsibility for their own spiritual trans-
formation, promoting the development of the Bahá’í community, and contribut-
ing to the process of the unification of the human race.

Based on studies and reports from experts in this field, evidence was pro-
vided illustrating the tremendous potential and capabilities latent within chil-
dren to act as agents of social change, particularly when appropriate facilitation
methods are employed that are calibrated to their individual and collective

developmental stages. A major theme of this paper is that children are more
capable than generally credited by adults—a mindset not restricted to non-
Bahá’í communities—and that they are competent, genuinely interested in what
is going on around them, and capable of making contributions to affect change.
The author argued that children’s participation is potentially a significant con-
tributor to the achievement of sustainable peace and security in the world.

The paper concluded with a series of recommendations to the Bahá’í com-
munity as to how children can be “…thoroughly integrated into the process of
community development…” and made to “…feel that they belong to the com-
munity and share in its purpose.” Whilst these recommendations may challenge
current Bahá’í social conventions regarding children, it is felt that they are,
nonetheless, consistent with the guidance provided by the Universal House of
Justice. Bahá’u’lláh’s exhortation to bring into being “…a new race of men” 69
obligates the Bahá’í community to stretch the boundaries of social conventions
and to introduce and put into practice new values and behaviour based on co-
operation, tolerance and justice. This obligation applies equally to our atti-
tudes, concepts and vision about children, a vision that is well captured in the
following citation by ‘Abdu’l-Bahá:

> I pray in behalf of these children and beg confirmation and assistance for them from the
> Kingdom of Abhá so that each one may be trained under the shadow of the protection of
> God, each may become like a lighted candle in the world of humanity, a tender and
> growing plant in the rose garden of Abhá; that these children may be so trained and
> educated that they shall give life to the world of humanity; that they may receive in-
> sight; that they may bestow hearing upon the people of the world; that they may sow
> the seeds of eternal life and be accepted in the threshold of God; that they may become
> characterized with such virtues, perfections and qualities that their mothers, fathers and
> relatives will be thankful to God, well pleased and hopeful. This is my wish and prayer.

ANNEX I:          ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s Summary of Bahá’u’lláh’s Writings Regarding

Human Rights

Taken from ‘Abdu’l-Bahá in London (1997) p. 27
Discourse of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá given at the Theosophical Head Quarters
September 30th, 1911

Firstly: Bahá’u’lláh lays stress on the search for Truth. This is most important,
because the people are too easily led by tradition. It is because of this that they
are often antagonistic to each other, and dispute with one another. But the mani-

festing of Truth discovers the darkness and becomes the cause of Oneness of
faith and belief: because Truth cannot be two! That is not possible.

Secondly: Bahá’u’lláh taught the Oneness of humanity; that is to say, all the
children of men are under the mercy of the Great God. They are the sons of
one God; they are trained by God.… But the children of men are in need of
education and civilization, and they require to be polished, till they become
bright and shining. Man and woman both should be educated equally and equally
regarded. It is racial, patriotic, religious and class prejudice, that has been the
cause of the destruction of Humanity.

Thirdly: Bahá’u’lláh taught, that Religion is the chief foundation of Love and
Unity and the cause of Oneness. If a religion become the cause of hatred and
disharmony, it would be better that it should not exist. To be without such a
religion is better than to be with it.

Fourthly: Religion and Science are inter-twined with each other and cannot
be separated. These are the two wings with which humanity must fly. One wing
is not enough. Every religion which does not concern itself with Science is
mere tradition, and that is not the essential. Therefore science, education and
civilization are most important necessities for the full religious life.

Fifthly: The Reality of the divine Religions is one, because the Reality is
one and cannot be two. All the prophets are united in their message, and un-
shaken. They are like the sun; in different seasons they ascend from different
rising points on the horizon. Therefore every ancient prophet gave the glad
tidings of the future, and every future has accepted the past.

Sixthly: Equality and Brotherhood must be established among all members
of mankind. This is according to Justice. The general rights of mankind must be
guarded and preserved. All men must be treated equally. This is inherent in the
very nature of humanity.

Seventhly: The arrangements of the circumstances of the people must be
such that poverty shall disappear, and that every one as far as possible, accord-
ing to his position and rank, shall be comfortable. Whilst the nobles and others
in high rank are in easy circumstances, the poor also should be able to get their
daily food and not be brought to the extremities of hunger.

Eighthly: Bahá’u’lláh declared the coming of the Most Great Peace. All the
nations and peoples will come under the shadow of the Tent of the Great Peace and
Harmony - that is to say, by general election a Great Board of Arbitration shall be
established, to settle all differences and quarrels between the Powers; so that dis-
putes shall not end in war.

Ninthly: Bahá’u’lláh taught that hearts must receive the Bounty of the Holy
Spirit, so that Spiritual civilization may be established. For material civiliza-
tion is not adequate for the needs of mankind and cannot be the cause of its
happiness. Material civilization is like the body and spiritual civilization is
like the soul. Body without soul cannot live.7 0

ANNEX II:       Towards a Global Ethic(An Initial Declaration)

1993 Parliament of the World’s Religions
August 28 - September 5, 1993
Chicago, Illinois, U.S.A.
www.cpwr.org/calldocs/EthicTOC.html

We affirm that a common set of core values is found in the teachings of the
religions, and that these form the basis of a global ethic.

We affirm that there is an irrevocable, unconditional norm for all areas of life,
for families and communities, for races, nations, and religions. There already exist
ancient guidelines for human behavior which are found in the teachings of the
religions of the world and which are the condition for a sustainable world order.

We consider humankind our family. We must strive to be kind and gener-
ous. We must not live for ourselves alone, but should also serve others, never
forgetting the children, the aged, the poor, the suffering, the disabled, the refu-
gees, and the lonely.

We confirm that there is already a consensus among the religions which can
be the basis for a global ethic—a minimal fundamental consensus concerning
binding values, irrevocable standards, and fundamental moral attitudes.

We all have a responsibility for a better global order. Our involvement for
the sake of human rights, freedom, justice, peace, and the preservation of Earth
is absolutely necessary. Our different religious and cultural traditions must not
prevent our Common involvement in opposing all forms of inhumanity and
working for greater humaneness. The principles expressed in this Global Ethic
can be affirmed by all persons with ethical convictions, whether religiously
grounded or not. As religious and spiritual persons we base our lives on an
Ultimate Reality, and draw spiritual power and hope therefrom, in trust, in
prayer or meditation, in word or silence. We have a special responsibility for
the welfare of all humanity and care for the planet Earth. We do not consider
ourselves better than other women and men, but we trust that the ancient wis-
dom of our religions can point the way for the future.

> We are convinced of the fundamental unity of the human family on Earth.

By a global ethic we do not mean a global ideology or a single unified
religion beyond all existing religions, and certainly not the domination of one
religion over all others. By a global ethic we mean a fundamental consensus on
binding values, irrevocable standards, and personal attitudes.

31   It would be misleading if the author did not clarify that whilst rights issues form a significant part

> of Bahá’u’lláh’s discourse on social structures, conduct and regulation, as well as forms of na-
> tional and international governance, due to the fact that He wrote in a revelatory style these
> issues are woven randomly throughout His Tablets and Books and thus are not presented in the
> codified manner normally associated with legal texts. Whilst this fact does not diminish the
> validity of His pronouncements on rights issues, it must be acknowledged that Bahá’u’lláh did
> not use the legal language and terminology of human rights that characterises the UDHR and
> other rights documents.

32   The Writings of Bahá’u’lláh are contained in more than one hundred volumes.
