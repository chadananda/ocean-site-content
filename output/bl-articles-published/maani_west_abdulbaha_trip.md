> **Abstract:** When 'Abdu’l-Bahá gained freedom, after fifty-eight years of exile and confinement, He made preparations for a momentous trip. By August 1910, when He began His trip, the Faith of Bahá’u’lláh had spread beyond the borders of lands gripped in the yoke of Islamic fanaticism and orthodoxy, and was established in areas which enjoyed religious freedom. However, He chose the West for His historic trip. The presentation on this topic explores the reasons for His choice and discusses the tremendous results achieved by the visit He made to Europe and North America, particularly the United States.

        The Choice of the West for `Abdu’l-Bahá’s

Epoch-making Trip

Baharieh Rouhani Maani

A child born in Tehran in 1844 had to leave His homeland at the age
of nine and live the rest of His life in exile. Fifty-five years later the
political landscape in Iran and Turkey, the countries responsible for
His exile and confinement, changed and sealed the fate of the despotic
regimes in those countries. As a result, He gained his freedom and
undertook a long and arduous journey to lands far beyond His familiar
environs. He traveled to areas spread over three continents of the
globe, crossed seas and oceans, and used various modes of transpor-
tation to visit souls longing to see Him and to speak to people eager
to hear His message,. He embarked on the trip despite His old age,
the risk to His failing health, a lack of material means, and the need
for hasty preparations for His colossal undertaking. Although legally
free, His traditional enemies watched Him closely, monitored His
every movement, and did what they could to frustrate His plan. The
trip, a precursor to the revelation of the Tablets of the Divine Plan,
described by Shoghi Effendi “the birthright of the North American
Bahá’í community”(CF 7) could not be postponed. The time was
short, the project had to be accomplished regardless of the obstacles
in His way and the formidable circumstances that prevailed.

The child Who spent almost all His life in exile was `Abbás Effendi,
the eldest Son of Bahá’u’lláh. In His Writings Bahá’u’lláh bestows
upon Him many titles descriptive of His unique station, such as
the Master, the Mystery of God, He Round Whom Revolves All
Names, He Who Sprang from the Ancient Root, and so forth. After

Lights of ‘Irfán Book Thirteen

Bahá’u’lláh passed away, `Abbás Effendi chose `Abdu’l-Bahá (Servant
of Bahá) as His title and required His followers to address Him as
such. This is the name by which He has become known throughout
the Bahá’í world and in outer circles, and that is how He is addressed
in this article.

The reason `Abdu’l-Bahá went into exile at the age of nine had noth-
ing to do with what He had done, or failed to do. His Father had
accepted the Claim of the Báb, Who in 1844 declared in Shiraz that
He was first of the two Manifestations of God expected in Scrip-
ture. The Báb’s mission was to prepare the way for the coming of the
next Manifestation of God, the Promise of All Ages. The Báb was
executed in Tabriz in 1850 by firing squad. His execution, demanded
by the religious establishment and government authorities in Iran,
was expected to extinguish the light of His Cause, diminish the
influence of His teachings, root out the new Order He had brought
and intimidate those who promoted the new Faith He had authored.
Mirzá Husayn-`Alí, entitled Bahá’u’lláh (Glory of God) was the
Manifestation of God the Báb had preceded and Whose coming he
had heralded. Bahá’u’lláh embraced the truth of the Bab’s Revelation
in 1844. He was the most prominent of the Báb’s followers and actively
promoted the Bábí Cause. His activities made Him a target for the
wrath of those who were intent on eradicating the Cause of the Báb.

An attempt on the life of Nasiri’d-Din Sháh in 1852 by three Bábí
youth who held him responsible for the atrocities perpetrated
against their loved ones, provided the authorities with the pretext to
imprison Bahá’u’lláh in mid-1852. After four months imprisonment
in the Síyáh-Chál (Black Pit) of Tehran, He was ordered to leave
Iran. Accompanied by the members of His immediate family, He
left Iran for Baghdad, which was then under the Ottoman rule. The
reason for the banishment was the perception of those in charge of
the country’s affairs that Iran could not enjoy rest and tranquility

The Choice of the West

while Bahá’u’lláh lived there, for prominent Bábís rallied around
Him, sought His guidance and followed His advice.

When Bahá’u’lláh left Iran, He had not yet made publicly known His
own Claim of being the one for whom the Báb had come to prepare
the way and for whose sake He had sacrificed His life. Bahá’u’lláh’s
declaration of His Mission occurred ten years later in Baghdad in
1863 just prior to the time when He and His family were forced to
leave Baghdad to yet another place of exile. The successive banish-
ments imposed on Bahá’u’lláh and His family by the Ottoman Rulers,
who acted under intense pressure from the Persian government to
send Him ever farther away from the Iranian border, culminated in
His imprisonment in the walled city of `Akká, then a desolate city and
penal colony where He lived the rest of His life.

The Centre of Bahá’u’lláh’s Covenant:
Before Bahá’u’lláh passed away on 29 May 1892, in a document
known as the Book of the Covenant written from beginning to end
in His own hand and bearing His seal, He outlined the salient fea-
tures of His revelation, specified unity as the purpose of religion, and
stipulated that the object of the verses He had revealed in the Kitáb-i-
Aqdas two decades earlier about the One to Whom all His followers
were to turn after His Ascension and the One authorized to interpret
His writings, was none other than His eldest son, the Most Great
Branch, Who later adopted `Abdu’l-Bahá as His title. In the same
document He appointed his second son, Mirzá Muḥammad `Alí,
titled the Greater Branch as a successor to `Abdu’l-Bahá and specified
that his station was beneath that of the Most Great Branch.

Hoping to have a leading role in directing the affairs of the Bahá’í com-
munity, Mirzá Muḥammad `Alí soon realized that the contents of
Bahá’u’lláh’s Testament made his aspiration untenable. He resented

Lights of ‘Irfán Book Thirteen

being overshadowed by the luminosity of his half-brother, Who was
ten years his senior. Recognizing the futility of contesting the authen-
ticity of his Father’s Book of the Covenant, he outwardly accepted
its provisions without abandoning the claim of being `Abdu’l-Bahá’s
equal and of sharing with Him the leadership of the Bahá’í world. His
ambitious and feeble attempts at seeking recognition and exerting his
influence among the believers did not come as a complete surprise. As
far back as 1867 he had exposed his unbridled ambition by claiming
to enjoy a station on par with Bahá’u’lláh. He clandestinely wrote to
some believers in Iran claiming to be the recipient of direct revelation
from God. The confusion occasioned by his claim angered Bahá’u’lláh,
Who clarified the station of His sons and emphasized that steadfast-
ness in His Cause was the cardinal prerequisite for attaining His good
pleasure. He further stated that if any of His sons stepped out from
beneath the shadow of the Tree of the Cause of God, their doings
would be brought to naught.1

> required that he and `Abdu’l-Bahá lead it jointly. He also denied that

Opposition to `Abdu’l-Bahá started immediately after Bahá’u’lláh’s
Ascension. Its scope widened rapidly, and the campaign of slander

> sity. At the instigation of His half brothers and their supporters

Greatly distressed by the news of fresh restrictions on `Abdu’l-
Bahá’s activities and movement, some western believers consulted
together and made a plan: They raised a considerable sum of money
and decided to send a delegation to Constantinople to meet the
Sultan, explain `Abdu’l-Bahá’s innocence and arrange His release. 6
Prominent believers, such as Mrs. Jackson, Hippolyte Dreyfus and
Lua Getsinger were involved. Lua Getsinger and Hippolyte Dreyfus
had, at `Abdu’l-Bahá’s behest met Muzaffari’d-Din Sháh and his
Prime Minister in Paris in 1901, and pleaded for justice on behalf
of the persecuted Bahá’ís in Iran. Encouraged by the success of their
meeting with the Shah, they seem to have conceived a plan to meet
Sultan `Abdu’l-Ḥamíd of Turkey in 1902 and to plead with him to

Lights of ‘Irfán Book Thirteen

order the release of `Abdu’l-Bahá. When informed, `Abdu’l-Bahá
strongly advised against the plan and asked that it be abandoned.

> Another Commission of Enquiry headed by a man heavily influenced

“Another time will do.”8 That time never came, for in July 1908 the

The principle aim of the Covenant-breakers was to have `Abdu’l-Bahá
removed from the nerve Centre of the Faith and to take control of the
affairs of the Bahá’í community. In the darkest hours of His ministry,
when the danger to His life seemed real and imminent, `Abdu’l-
Bahá wrote His Will and Testament. In it He explained how Mirzá
Muḥammad `Alí had disqualified himself as His successor, and
appointed his grandson Shoghi Effendi, then a child of tender years,
as the Guardian of the Cause of God. To keep the document safe,
He buried it underground in an unsuspected spot in the basement
of His residence in `Akká, the House of `Abdu’lláh Pashá. `Abdu’l-
Bahá’s sister, the Greatest Holy Leaf, knew of the appointment of
Shoghi Effendi as the Guardian of the Faith, (PP 11) and surely of
the whereabouts of His Testament.

The Choice of the West

The Young Turk’s Revolution Leads to
Freedom from Oppression

Corruption, oppression and lack of concern for the welfare of the
people living under their rule marked the reign of the last Ottoman
emperors. It was during the Caliphate of Sultan `Abdu’l-`Azíz that
Bahá’u’lláh was banished from place to place within his domain,
and endured untold hardships. Sultan `Abdu’l-`Azíz surrounded
himself with ministers who followed “the desires of a corrupt incli-
nation” and “cast behind their backs that which had been committed
into their hands and manifestly betrayed their trust…”(GWB 232)
Bahá’u’lláh counseled the Sultan: “Be bounteous to others as God
hath been bounteous to thee, and abandon not the interests of thy
people to the mercy of such ministers as these.” (ibid) He promised the
monarch that if he inclined his ear unto His speech and observed
His counsel, God would exalt him “to so eminent a position that the
designs of no man on the whole earth can ever touch or hurt thee.”(bid
234)But, as anticipated, the Sultan did not heed Bahá’u’lláh’s
loving counsel and warning. The excesses characterizing his rule,
the injustices perpetrated by officials who served in his court, the
hardships suffered by his people, and the sense of hopelessness that
gripped the population continued during the reign of his successor,
Sultan `Abdu’l-Ḥamíd, and caused widespread resentment.

The situation in Turkey worsened steadily. Acute dissatisfaction with
the status quo and the ruler’s lack of response to the needs of the people
under his rule caused the population, especially the younger generation,
to arise against him. The Young Turks Revolution gained momentum
and in 1908 ushered in an era of social and political change. One of
the demands of the Revolution was the restoration of the constitu-
tion which Sultan `Abdu’l-Ḥamíd had suspended, and the release of
all political prisoners. `Abdu’l-Bahá was not a political figure, but the
trumped up charges against Him were deliberately designed to have
political implications. He had been falsely accused of involvement in

Lights of ‘Irfán Book Thirteen

subversive activities against the central government. When political
prisoners were freed, `Abdu’l-Bahá gained freedom as well. Had there
been a delay, He would not have been able to achieve the work that He
was destined to do, including the completion of the original structure of
the Báb’s Mausoleum, the interment of the remains of the Báb, which
had arrived in the Holy Land ten years earlier, in their permanent rest-
ing place on Mount Carmel, and undertaking His momentous trip to
the west, especially to North America.

The Choice of the West for An Epoch-making Trip
Much had occurred during the fifty-five years Intervening between
the time `Abdu’l-Bahá was exiled from the land of His birth, and
1908 when He gained freedom from the shackles of confinement. He
left Iran as a child accompanying His Father, spent the rest of His
childhood, youth and adulthood moving from land to land, under-
taking responsibilities and challenges in service to Bahá’u’lláh and
His mighty Cause. By the time Bahá’u’lláh passed away, His Faith
had spread not only in Iran, Iraq, and Turkey where He had lived,
but also to other Middle Eastern countries, as well as to far away
areas; the Indian sub-continent, China, some central Asian countries
and parts of North Africa. The sovereigns and rulers of the world
had been addressed by Him, His Most Holy Book, as well as major
Tablets revealed after the Kitáb-i-Aqdas, had been published, and
the tenets of His Faith had been set out in more than one hundred
volumes and major works revealed from His Pen.

The pace of progress accelerated during the ministry of `Abdu’l-
Bahá, Bahá’u’lláh’s Successor and the Centre of His Covenant.
He consolidated the Cause of God where Bahá’ís lived, and estab-
lished it in new territories. One area of the globe where the light
of Bahá’u’lláh penetrated shortly after His Ascension was North
America and from there it spread to Europe. The spread of the Faith

The Choice of the West

to the western hemisphere has been described by Shoghi Effendi
as “the most outstanding achievement that will forever be associated
with `Abdu’l-Bahá’s ministry.” (GPB 279)

The activities of `Abdu’l-Bahá’s opponents that had caused Him
untold suffering during the first sixteen years of His ministry had been
frustrated, but the agitation they fomented continued into the min-
istry of the one He appointed as the Guardian of the Cause of God.
As the Covenant-breakers witnessed the fading of their reputation and
the loss of their status among the believers, their clandestine activities
increased. They stopped at nothing to discredit `Abdu’l-Bahá, Whose
main aim was to spread far and wide the Teachings of Bahá’u’lláh,
unite the believers under the banner of His Cause, and help them to
work toward an ever-advancing civilization.

During the first decade of `Abdu’l-Bahá’s ministry, the remains of the
Báb Who had been martyred fifty years earlier, arrived safely in the
Holy Land. Shortly after the arrival of the remains, `Abdu’l-Bahá laid
the foundation stone of the Báb’s Mausoleum, in a groundbreaking
ceremony held in 1900 on Mount Carmel. The original structure,
which `Abdu’l-Bahá built at the instruction of Bahá’u’lláh for the
interment of the remains of the Báb, took nine years to complete.

> Almost simultaneously with the arrival of the remains of the Báb
> in the Holy Land, and while preparations were being made for the

> reaching consequences took place: Western pilgrims, eager to meet
`Abdu’l-Bahá and visit the Sacred Shrine of Bahá’u’lláh, set sail in

> have the means to embark on a transatlantic voyage. For them the
> only hope of meeting `Abdu’l-Bahá was if He visited their country.

The returning pilgrims and those who could not make the trip to
the Holy Land sent petitions to `Abdu’l-Bahá pleading with Him to
honor their land with His presence. They even raised funds for His
trip, which He gently declined.9

`Abdu’l-Bahá received invitations not only from the believers but also

> from religious leaders, political figures, organizers of peace confer-
> ences, and groups concerned with the status of the world and its
> future stability. They longed to meet and hear the “Prophet of the
> East”, despite His insistence that He was not a prophet but simply
`Abdu’l-Bahá, the Servant of Bahá.

`Abdu’l-Bahá’s advanced age, failing health, the pressing matters

> that He had to deal with and the world situation made it impossible
> for Him to undertake trips to all of the different parts of the globe,
> where the Light of Bahá’u’lláh’s Revelation had penetrated and which
> enjoyed religious freedom. In some of His Tablets, He expressed the
> wish to visit India, Japan and China, but knew the wish would remain
> unfulfilled. When He was in Chicago, members of the Society of
> Indians resident in that city attained His presence and read Him an
> address of welcome. In it they called His visit to the United States “a
> source of honor and grace” to them. In the same address, they said:

> [W]e believe that our country, India, will greatly benefit
> from a visit from your Excellency. The lack of unity between
> the Hindus and Muslims has kept them in the utmost con-
> tention and strife. As your Excellency’s teachings are very
> much like the teachings of our religious leaders, they will
> undoubtedly unite them and make these contending nations
> one. We are certain that you will receive the same warmth
> and honor in India as here in America… We pray to God to
> give your Excellency long life so that you may be enabled to
> convey your message to all mankind.10

The prevailing circumstances were such that `Abdu’l-Bahá could
make only one trip far away from the Headquarters of the Faith. He
chose a trip to the West, a trip Shoghi Effendi has described as “the
culmination of His ministry”. (GPB 295) Bahá’u’lláh had anticipated
this priceless opportunity during His lifetime, when all worldly forces
were leagued against Him: “In the East the light of His Revelation hath
broken; in the West have appeared the signs of His dominion.”(TB 13)
He further prophesied: “Should they attempt to conceal its light on the
continent, it will assuredly rear its head in the midmost heart of the ocean,
and, raising its voice, proclaim: ‘I am the life-giver of the world!’” (WOB
78–79. These momentous utterances found fulfillment with `Abdu’l-
Bahá’s trip to the west, particularly His transatlantic voyage.

The opportunity to make the trip had to be seized immediately, or it
would have been lost forever. Aware of the upheavals in the making that
threatened international peace, and the short years during which
He could make the trip, He decided the time had come for Him to
take action and fulfill a preordained mission, but did not divulge
His intention regarding a specific time or the places He wanted to
visit aforetime.

In response to invitations from the friends in the United States,
`Abdu’l-Bahá stipulated one condition: “My invitation to America

> will be the unity of the believers.” 11 Differences of opinion among
> the friends had led to disunity. The cause of the differences was
> directly linked to the misdeeds and intrigues of an ambitious person
> who had taken the message of Bahá’u’lláh to the United States of
> America, and taught many to enlist under the banner of His Cause.
> His name was Ibrahim Kheiralla, who, in the words of Shoghi
> Effendi, “blinded by his extraordinary success and aspiring after an
> uncontrolled domination over the beliefs and activities of his fellow-
> disciples, insolently raised the standard of revolt.”12 He “dreamt of
> sharing `Abdu’l-Bahá’s authority.”13

> Of Syrian origin and Christian evangelical background, Kheiralla
> became a Bahá’í in Egypt in about 1888. In 1894 he migrated to
> the United States where he began teaching the Bahá’í Faith with
> great success. In 1900 he joined an early group of pilgrims to `Akká,
> stayed in `Abdu’l-Bahá’s house as a guest, was received warmly by
> Him and praised for the services he had rendered. Acknowledging
> his outstanding success in teaching the Cause of Bahá’u’lláh to so
> many souls, `Abdu’l-Bahá conferred upon him “the titles of ‘Bahá’s
> Peter,’ ‘Shepherd of God’s Flocks,’ and ‘Conqueror of America.’”
> However, Kheiralla wanted much more. When he realized that “[t]
> he integrity of `Abdu’l-Bahá’s stewardship could not be breached,”14
> he rose in opposition to Him, determined to form a following and
> exert influence on the Bahá’í community in the west. If rising to
`Abdu’l-Bahá’s stature was not in the equation, discrediting Him

> through false accusations and slander could go a long way to fulfill
> that intention, especially if he joined hand with those who had a
> similar aim. To achieve the purpose, he worked in conjunction with
> other Covenant-breakers. He launched “a campaign of unrelenting
> vilification against the person of `Abdu’l-Bahá, to undermine the
> faith of those believers whom he had during no less than eight years,
> so strenuously toiled to convert.” (WOB 82)

Kheiralla defected at a crucial juncture in the fortunes of the Faith in
the West. His collaboration with the traditional enemies of `Abdu’l-
Bahá within and outside the United States, his working in concert
with them to propagate calumnies and the misleading material he
published in English confused the minds of some of the people he
had taught. The believers were divided in their understanding of
Kheiralla’s true standing in the Faith and in the way he comported
himself. `Abdu’l-Bahá sent Tablets emphasizing the importance of
unity. He also dispatched outstanding Bahá’í teachers to the West,
such as `Abdu’l-Karím Tihrání, the man who had taught the Faith
to Kheiralla, Siyyid Asadu’llah Isfahani, and Mirza Abu’l-Fadl who
spent nearly two years in the United States at the beginning of the

twentieth century. The purpose of his long sojourn was to deepen the
understanding of the believers in the tenets revealed by Bahá’u’lláh
and to allay the doubts that still lingered in the minds of some believ-
ers. As His own station had become a controversial subject and a
matter of contention, `Abdu’l-Bahá emphasized servitude as His
glorious crown and strongly urged the believers to see and refer to
Him as `Abdu’l-Bahá (Servant of Bahá), and to follow His example.
These efforts were successful to some degree, but restoring health to
the ailing body of the community that had suffered the malady of
disunity, required a powerful antidote. `Abdu’l-Bahá had addressed
the believers’ concerns through correspondence and had dispatched
emissaries to help them overcome the stumbling blocks in the way of
achieving unity, but nothing short of a visit from Him could arouse
them to scale the heights that they achieved after His historic trip,
described by Shoghi Effendi as “a turning point of the utmost signifi-
cance in the history of the century. (GPB 279–280)

`Abdu’l-Bahá spoke of the crucial importance of His trip to the

> United States when He was on His way to Kenosha, Wisconsin, a
> stronghold of Kheiralla’s activities:

> I am bearing the discomforts of this journey with stopovers so
> that the Cause of God may be protected from any breach. For
> I am still not sure about what is going to happen after me. If I
> could be sure, then I would sit comfortably in some corner; I
> would not leave the Holy Land and travel far away from the
> Most Holy Tomb. Once, after the martyrdom of the Báb, the
> Cause of God was dealt a hard blow through Yahya. Again,
> after the ascension of the Blessed Beauty, it received another
> blow. And I fear that self-seeking persons may again disrupt
> the love and unity of the friends. If the time were right and the
> House of Justice were established, the House of Justice would
> protect the friends.15

He then spoke of the devastating effects of disunity at the beginning
of the Islamic dispensation: “Because of certain people who sought
to fulfill their personal desires and who yet counted themselves
among the supporters of the religion, the foundation of Islam was
completely uprooted.”

The Genesis of the Spread of the Bahá’í Faith in the West
In his message of Naw-Ruz 110 BE to the friends in the East, Shoghi
Effendi refers to the astonishing phenomenon of the spread of the
light of Bahá’u’lláh’s Cause to the West. He says the light which
blazed in the midmost heart of a storm in Tihran, emerged from
behind the veils in Baghdad, glowed in the clear glass of Adrianople,
and shed its light on the western hemisphere from the horizon of the
prison city of `Akká, the qiblih of the people of Bahá.16

The western world first heard of the Bahá’í Faith through press
reports and the writings of Orientalists, such as Edward G. Browne17
and Alexander Tumansky.18 Edward Browne had an audience with
Bahá’u’lláh in `Akká in 1890, and left to posterity his matchless
description of the Person he had met. But the person who actively
promoted the Faith of Bahá’u’lláh in the United States was Ibrahim
Kheiralla. He set foot there shortly after Bahá’u’lláh’s Ascension,
and began in earnest to teach the Cause. When success crowned
his efforts, he was tempted by insatiable ambition and desired to
be the recognized leader of Bahá’ís in the West. When that dream
proved unattainable, he turned against `Abdu’l-Bahá, the Centre
of Bahá’u’lláh’s Covenant, and rebelled against His authority. His
rebellion caused a breach of short duration in the community he had
helped establish, and temporarily halted the pace of progress he had
set in motion.

Kheiralla is not the first or only person in the history of the Bahá’í
Faith whose success in the teaching field became a grievous test,
exposed his ambition and caused his downfall, while the Faith he
was using for his own selfish ends emerged triumphant and forged
ahead without his presence. It was through Kheiralla’s initial efforts
that the Cause of God was established in several parts of the United
States and through his rebellion and defection that the unity of the
believers was threatened. To receive `Abdu’l-Bahá in their midst, the
greatest gift they could imagine, the faithful believers united under
the banner of the Covenant. His visit galvanized them to arise in
service to the Cause of the Blessed Beauty, the purpose of which is
to unite humankind, and made them worthy of being the recipients,
together with the believers in Canada, of The Tablets of the Divine
Plan, a mandate for the spiritualization of the planet. These Tab-
lets were revealed while World War I was raging, a war that began
shortly after `Abdu’l-Bahá returned to the Holy Land from His
visit to North America and Europe, and ended three years before
His Ascension.

A Pre-ordained Trip
`Abdu’l-Bahá had accompanied His Father into exile when Iran was in

> the tight grip of a dictatorial Qajar Shah,19 and the Ottoman Empire

`Akká.21 `Abdu’l-Bahá continued to live in the citadel of `Akká until

orders were received for His release from confinement.

When freed, `Abdu’l-Bahá was eager to visit the West before His
health condition deteriorated further, and world events interfered,
making it impossible for him to undertake the trip. When the
appointed time came, all forces worked together to bring about the
realization of His plan. `Abdu’l-Bahá embarked on His momentous
journey two years after He was released from years of incarceration.

Two kings, Muhammad `Alí Qájár, the Shah of Iran, and Sultan
`Abdu’l-Ḥamíd, the Ottoman Caliph, were dethroned that He may

> be freed. Without freedom, He would not have been able to fulfill
> His predestined trip to the West. This highly significant remark He
> made during His visit to the United States. “Think of it,” He said,
“Two kings were dethroned in order that I may be freed. This is naught

but pure destiny.”22

Before embarking on His long and arduous journey, `Abdu’l-Bahá
was intent on completing the Báb’s Mausoleum and on interring His
remains in their permanent Resting Place, as had been envisaged by
Bahá’u’lláh. The mission was finally complete when on Naw-Ruz
1909, in the presence of pilgrims and resident Bahá’ís, `Abdu’l-Bahá
placed with His own hands the inner casket containing the remains
of the Báb and the disciple23 who had been martyred with Him, in
the marble sarcophagus offered for the purpose by the Bahá’ís of
Rangoon, Burma. The sarcophagus had reached the Holy Land in
good time and been placed in the vault of that Mausoleum, ready to
receive the sacred remains of the Báb.24

To embark on a protracted journey to lands far away from the Holy
Land in fulfillment of a mission decreed by Providence at a time when
means of communication between countries, let alone continents,
were primitive and painfully slow, `Abdu’l-Bahá needed a depend-
able and trustworthy person to serve as His deputy at the nerve
Centre of the Faith. That person was none other than His beloved
sister, Bahá’íyyih Khánum, known in the West as Bahíyyih Khánum,
entitled the Greatest Holy Leaf. Shoghi Effendi says:

And when in pursuance of God’s inscrutable Wisdom, the ban on
`Abdu’l-Bahá’s confinement was lifted and the Plan which He, in the

> darkest hours of His confinement, had conceived materialized, He
> with unhesitating confidence, invested His trusted and honoured

sister with the responsibility of attending to the multitudinous
details arising out of His protracted absence from the Holy Land.25

> Preparations for `Abdu’l-Bahá’s journey and arrangements for the
> affairs in the Holy Land to function smoothly during His absence,
> were all made quietly. If plans were disclosed prematurely, the
> Covenant-breakers would have done their utmost to cause disruption
> and frustration. Therefore, when on a September afternoon in 1910,
`Abdu’l-Bahá left for Egypt, everyone was taken by surprise. A Tablet

> revealed by `Abdu’l-Bahá in honor of the Greatest Holy Leaf, when
> He was either about to leave the Holy Land or possibly already on
His way to Egypt, reads:

O thou my sister, my dear sister!

> Divine wisdom hath decreed this temporary separation,26 but
> I long more and more to be with thee again. Patience is called
> for, and long-suffering, and trust in God, and the seeking of His
> favor. Since thou art there, my mind is completely at rest.

> In recent days, I have made a plan to visit Egypt, if this be
> God’s will. Do thou, on my behalf, lay thy head on the sacred
> Threshold, and perfume brow and hair in the dust of that Door,
> and ask that I may be confirmed in my work; that I may, in
> return for His endless bounties, win, if He will, a drop out of
> the ocean of servitude.27

When it became known that `Abdu’l-Bahá had left Haifa, Sydney
Sprague28 disclosed the news in a letter to Isabella Brittingham:

> I have a very big piece of news to tell you. `Abdu’l-Bahá
> has left this Holy Spot for the first time in forty-two years,
> and has gone to Egypt. Think of the vast significance and
> importance of this step! By it many prophecies of the sacred
> Scriptures are fulfilled… Everyone was astounded to hear
> of `Abdu’l-Bahá’s departure, for no one knew until the very

> last minute that he had any idea of leaving... The afternoon
> of the day he left, he came to Mírzá Asad Ullah’s home to
> see us and sat with us a while beside a new well that has just
> been finished and said that he had come to taste the water.
> We did not realize that it was a good-bye visit. Then he took
> a carriage and went up the hill to the Holy Tomb (of the Báb).
> That night, as usual, the believers gathered before the house
> of `Abdu’l-Bahá to receive that blessing, which every day is
> ours, of being in his presence, but we waited in vain, for one
> of the sons-in-law came and told us that `Abdu’l-Bahá had
> taken the Khedivial steamer to Port Said.29

`Abdu’l-Bahá’s absence from the Holy Land was soon felt by every-

> one. The friends of the family who were not Bahá’ís enquired
> about His whereabouts. In a Tablet revealed in honor of His wife,
`Abdu’l-Bahá says:

> Should people enquire about My whereabouts, tell them that
> certain prominent Americans and Europeans have repeatedly
> sought and received promises that I would make a trip to those
> areas… be evasive as much as possible… The less said the better
> it would be. Tell Dr. Fallscheer also not to divulge the truth, and
> thou shouldst not divulge either as far as possible.30

Dr. Fallscheer was the family doctor who lived in Haifa. She was a
close friend and confidant. She knew of `Abdu’l-Bahá’s trip to Egypt
and of His plan to travel to Marseille, where He was to meet “a man
of stature.” In fact, she served as intermediary between `Abdu’l-Bahá
and that person.31 It was a highly confidential meeting. The name of
the person and information about the meeting, whether it took place
and what the outcome was, remained undisclosed.

Egypt was the starting point of `Abdu’l-Bahá’s epoch-making trip,
during which He shed the brilliance of the Light of Bahá’u’lláh’s

revelation on the western world. Juliet Thompson records in her
Diary something `Abdu’l-Bahá said to her when she was on pilgrim-
age in 1909, the year of the entombment of the remains of the Báb.
That statement brings to focus the connection between Bahá’u’lláh’s
utterance about the Light of His Revelation breaking in the East and
the signs of His dominion appearing in the West, also confirming
that if attempts were made to conceal that Light on the land, it would
raise its head in the midmost heart of the ocean. She says: “I was
on the roof of the House in `Akká with the Master and Munavvar
Khanum.32 The Master was pointing to the moon. “The East. The
moon. No!” He said. “I am the Sun of the West.”33

Speaking of the Light of the Kingdom shedding greater illumination
upon the West, `Abdu’l-Bahá says: “The East hath verily been illu-
mined with the light of the Kingdom. Ere long will this same light shed a
still greater illumination upon the West. Then will the hearts of its people
be vivified through the potency of the teachings of God and their souls be
set aglow by the undying fire of His love.” (WOB 79)

Successive attempts over decades at suppressing the Light of
Bahá’u’lláh’s Advent in the land of its birth and in countries under
the Ottoman rule provided the moving force to cause it to appear
in promising lands in North America, whence it spread to the rest
of the western hemisphere. During His travels, `Abdu’l-Bahá met
people of all ranks and backgrounds. With the luminosity of His
unique personality, divine love, wisdom, compassion and under-
standing He transformed many souls and opened before them the
gates of everlasting felicity and salvation. We have on record the
accounts of many converts who have recorded their impressions of
meeting Him face to face. There are also many comments by those
who were not listed among His followers but perceived with their
inner eyes the Light that shone through Him:

Diya Pasha, the Ambassador of Turkey, the country that had per-
secuted Bahá’u’lláh and `Abdu’l-Bahá most unjustly and for so
long, gave a dinner at the Turkish Embassy in honor of the Center
of Bahá’u’lláh’s Covenant. After dinner, he “made a thrilling speech.
Rising and turning a lover’s face to the Master, he called Him ‘the
Light of the world, the Unique One of the age, Who had come to
spread His glory and perfection amongst us’.”34

At a meeting of the New York Peace Society, held at the Hotel Astor,
New York, “Mrs. [Anna Garland] Spencer introduced `Abdu’l-Bahá
as the Prophet of the East and the Messenger of Peace.”35 “The Con-
sul General of Persia [Mr. Topakyan] referred to `Abdu’l-Bahá as the
Beauty of God and the Glory of the East.”36

The governor of Lahore, Khan Bahadur Allah-Bakhsh, called on the
Master at the Hudson Apartment House one early morning in mid-
May 1912. Three days later, Juliet Thompson had a note from him. It
read: “`Abdu’l-Bahá is the Divine Light of today.”37

Mr. Lee McClung, the Treasurer of the United States, met `Abdu’l-
Bahá at Mrs. Parsons’. In response to Juliet Thompson who asked
how he felt when he saw the Master, said: “Well, I felt as though I
were in the presence of one of the great old Prophets: Elijah, Isaiah,
Moses. No, it was more than that! Christ… no, now I have it. He
seemed to me my Divine Father.”38

Lawrence White, a friend of Juliet Thompson’s, had come to New
York from Utica to meet the Master. After seeing `Abdu’l-Bahá at
Mount Morris Baptist Church, he whispered: “Look at Him and see
the Christ.”39

In his review of the history of the first century of the Bahá’í Era
(1844–1944), Shoghi Effendi has drawn a parallel between the
summit reached during Bahá’u’lláh’s ministry, when He proclaimed

His Message to the rulers of the earth, and that of the ministry of
`Abdu’l-Bahá, when He blazoned “the glory and greatness of His

Father’s Faith among the peoples of the West.” He says:

> As the day-star of Bahá’u’lláh’s Revelation had shone forth in
> its meridian splendor at the hour of the proclamation of His
> Message to the rulers of the earth in the city of Adrianople,
> so did the Orb of His Covenant mount its zenith and shed
> its brightest rays when He Who was its appointed Center
> arose to blazon the glory and greatness of His Father’s Faith
> among the peoples of the West. (GPB 295)

The Ascendancy of the Covenant Empowered `Abdu’l-Bahá
to Undertake His Historic Trip
Shoghi Effendi refers to `Abdu’l-Bahá’s three-year trip to the West
as a mission and explains how the ascendancy of the Covenant made
the fulfillment of that mission possible:

> That divinely instituted Covenant… had manifested… before
> all mankind, with a force in a measure hitherto unapproached,
> its vast potentialities when it empowered Him in Whom its
> spirit and its purpose were enshrined to embark on a three-
> year mission to the West—a mission so momentous that it
> deserves to rank as the greatest exploit ever to be associated
> with His ministry.” (ibid)

Confirming the ascendancy of the Covenant by the time `Abdu’l-
Bahá embarked on His trip to the West, H.M. Balyuzi says: “Mirzá
Muḥammad `Alí and his partisans were now thoroughly discredited.
In the absence of `Abdu’l-Bahá from the Holy Land the violators
would have the field entirely to themselves, but their utter inability
to make any move to impair the unity of the Bahá’ís would set the

final seal on their downfall. `Abdu’l-Bahá particularly stressed this
fact in a Tablet addressed at the time to a Bahá’í in Iskandarún
(Alexandretta).”40

> The early signs of the triumph of the Covenant were discernible when
> the western pilgrims arrived in `Akká, spent a few glorious days in
`Abdu’l-Bahá’s presence, and left completely transformed. By the

> time the first group of western pilgrims reached the shores of the
> Holy Land, almost all members of Bahá’u’lláh’s family had arisen in
> opposition to `Abdu’l-Bahá. The coming of the pilgrims cheered the
> heart of the Greatest Holy Leaf and other members of His family
> who had for long been deeply concerned for His safety. In the words
> Shoghi Effendi:

> It was through the arrival of these pilgrims, and these alone,
> that the gloom which had enveloped the disconsolate mem-
> bers of `Abdu’l-Bahá’s family was finally dispelled. Through
> the agency of these successive visitors the Greatest Holy
> Leaf, who alone with her Brother among the members of her
> Father’s household had to confront the rebellion of almost
> the entire company of her relatives and associates, found
> that consolation which so powerfully sustained her till the
> very close of her life. IWOB 81–82)

When the western pilgrims arrived in `Akká in the concluding years
of the nineteenth century, the stage was set for `Abdu’l-Bahá’s visit to
North America and Europe some twelve years later:

> It was through these pilgrimages, as they succeeded one
> another in the years immediately following the ascension of
> Bahá’u’lláh, that the splendor of the Covenant, beclouded
> for a time by the apparent ascendancy of its Arch-Breaker,
> emerged triumphant amidst the vicissitudes which had
> afflicted it... By the forces which this little band of returning

> pilgrims was able to release in the heart of that continent
> the death-knell of every scheme initiated by the would-be
> wrecker of the Cause of God was sounded. (ibid)

The returning pilgrims ignited the spark of longing for meeting
`Abdu’l-Bahá in the hearts of the believers, most of whom could

> not attain His presence due to lack of means. Many of them com-
> municated with Him and received His Tablets. Many had heard
> from the returning pilgrims accounts of the transformation they
> had experienced. These believers, unlike many who lived in the
> Middle East and other Islamic countries, enjoyed the blessing of
> freedom and could receive `Abdu’l-Bahá in their midst. Therefore,
> repeated petitions were sent beseeching Him to honor them with a
> visit. `Abdu’l-Bahá’s visit to North America made firmer the steps
> of the faithful in the Cause of God, removed doubts from the hearts
> of the confused in areas where Covenant-breakers had penetrated,
> and emphasized the vital importance of unity and concord among
> the friends.

The Treatment of the Qajar Princes Responsible for
the Massacre of Bahá’ís in Iran
Among the people `Abdu’l-Bahá met during His first visit to Europe
was a prince who was personally responsible for the massacre of
Bahá’ís in Isfahan, Iran. Zillu’s-Sultan, 41 the eldest son of Nasiri’d-
Din Sháh, and his two sons attained `Abdu’l-Bahá’s presence in
Thonon on Lake Geneva. Juliet Thompson describes the meeting:

> In the suite of `Abdu’l-Bahá was a distinguished European42
> who had visited Persia and there met Zillah Sultan. One day
> when the European was standing on the balustraded terrace
> of the hotel in Thonon and `Abdu’l-Bahá was pacing to and
> fro at a little distance, Zillah Sultan approached the terrace.
`Abdu’l-Bahá was wearing, as always, the turban, the long

> white belted robe and long `aba of Persia. His hair, accord-
> ing to the ancient custom of the Persian nobility, flowed to
> His shoulders. Zillah Sultan, after greeting the European,
> immediately asked:

“Who is that Persian nobleman?”

“`Abdu’l-Bahá.”

“Take me to Him.”

In describing the scene later, the European said:

“If you could have heard the wretch mumbling his miserable

excuses!”

But `Abdu’l-Bahá took the prince in His arms.

“All that is of the past,” He answered, “Never think of it again.

Send your two sons to see me. I want to meet your sons.”

> They came, one at a time. Each spent a day with the Master.
> The first43 though an immature boy, nevertheless showed
> Him great deference. The second, 44 older and more sensitive,
> left the room of `Abdu’l-Bahá, where he had been received
> alone, weeping uncontrollably.

“If only I could be born again,” he said, “into any other family

than mine.”

> For not only had many Bahá’ís been martyred during his
> uncle’s reign (upwards of a hundred by his father’s instiga-
> tion), and the life of `Abdu’l-Bahá threatened again and
> again, but his grandfather, Nasir’d-Din Sháh, had ordered
> the execution of the Báb, as well as the torture and death of
> thousand of Bábís.

The young prince was “born again”—a Bahá’í. 45

Another prince who attained `Abdu’l-Bahá’s presence in Britain
during His second visit to that country was Mahmud Mirza, the

Jalalu’d-Dawlih. It was during his governorship of Yazd, Iran, that
the Bahá’ís of the area suffered unprecedented atrocities in 1903
and many were martyred. “He was now a broken man and an
exile, seemingly contrite, asking for forgiveness. He threw himself
at `Abdu’l-Bahá’s feet, but `Abdu’l-Bahá would not permit him to
humiliate himself.”46

The Reaction of Persian Diplomatic Representatives
In the United States of America and in Europe `Abdu’l-Bahá met
Iranian officials and potentates who spontaneously expressed their
pleasure and appreciation for what His visit had done for their coun-
try. Several years earlier such meetings would have been unthinkable,
for Bahá’ís were relentlessly persecuted in that country as a matter of
state policy, dictated by the clergy.

> The Iranian dignitaries in the United States witnessed with delight
> the admiration and respect for `Abdu’l-Bahá among the inhabitants
> of that country. They were proud that His visit was the cause of great
> glory for Iran and the East. The Consul-General for Persia in New
> York, Mr. Topakiyan invited Him and His retinue to luncheon in his
> New York home, and “arranged as well, for some notabilities to meet
`Abdu’l-Bahá and some newspapermen to interview Him. 47

> The Persian Minister in London, Mushiru’l-Mulk, visited `Abdu’l-
> Bahá shortly after He arrived there in December 1912, and heard
> from Him “of His work in America—‘winning everlasting victories
> which will bring unfading glory to the peoples of the East.’”48 A few
> weeks later, the same Minister “gave a dinner party for `Abdu’l-Bahá
> at the Legation. The Minister and his staff rejoiced over the news of
`Abdu’l-Bahá’s visit to Scotland, the reception accorded to Him in

> Edinburgh.” The press reports were clear proof that He “had indeed
> brought glory to the people of the Orient…even as He had described

it to the Minister, in their first meeting.”49

The Persian Minister in Paris, `Abdus-Samad Khan, the Mumtazu’s-
Saltanih “called on `Abdu’l-Bahá a week after His arrival. A number
of noted Easterners were also present, who were united in saying that
they felt very much at home in the presence of `Abdu’l-Bahá.”50

A prominent member of the Iranian aristocracy, Dust-Muhammad
Khan, the Mu`ayyiru’l-Mamalik, son-in-law of Muzaffari’d-Din
Shah (1896–1907), “had become so attached and devoted to the
person of `Abdu’l-Bahá that he was always seeking His presence, and
could almost be counted a member of His retinue.”51

These and other examples of unhindered association, based on
mutual respect and friendship, between `Abdu’l-Bahá and officials
of the Persian government make one wonder if the same would have
been possible, had He travelled to any other part of the globe.

`Abdu’l-Bahá’s Public Addresses
By personally addressing large gatherings of eager seekers in the
free world, `Abdu’l-Bahá proclaimed what His Father had revealed
several decades earlier. He explained how the ultimate goal of the
unity of humankind and universal peace could be achieved. He con-
veyed Bahá’u’lláh’s Teachings in their purest form to those who were
hearing it for the first time. He also corrected the misunderstandings
and misconceptions that had crept in through self-seeking individuals
who promoted their own interests in the guise of teaching the Bahá’í
Faith. This priceless opportunity, had it been missed, would have
not come about again, for World War I broke out shortly after He
returned from His trip to the Holy Land, and three years after the
end of the war He passed away in November 1921. With His visit
to the West, for the first time in the annals of religious history, the

light of the Sun of Truth, which had risen in the east, illumined the
West by the One whom Bahá’u’lláh had appointed the Centre of His
Covenant and the infallible Interpreter of His Words.

`Abdu’l-Bahá had also received invitations from organizations that

> were eager to meet and seek enlightenment from Him. The world
> was moving toward a conflict that would engulf many countries. The
> threat of World War I was looming high. Many organizations were
> hard at work to promote goodwill among people and raise conscious-
> ness regarding the perils of war. Their ideas often revolved around
> the economic, social and political ills afflicting people of diverse back-
> grounds. `Abdu’l-Bahá stressed the pivotal principles enunciated by
> Bahá’u’lláh; that the oneness of humanity was the basic prerequisite
> for addressing the ills afflicting humanity, that prejudices of all kinds
> had to be eliminated, that education had to become universal and
> compulsory, that preferences accorded people on the basis of gender
> and color of skin had to give way to equal rights for all. His mes-
> sage was spiritual in nature. He advocated a civilization in which the
> material and spiritual aspects were well balanced.

Among the conferences `Abdu’l-Bahá attended in the United States
was Lake Mohonk International Peace Conference. It was one of
the most prestigious organizations searching for peaceful solutions
to the problems assailing humanity. The eighteenth annual session
of the conference on international arbitration was held 15–17 May
1912 at Lake Mohonk, New York. The attendance included delegates
and visitors from many countries. `Abdu’l-Bahá had been invited and
accepted to participate. Announcing the Conference, the “Evening
Sun” of New York City, the 8 May 1912 issue, number 25068, wrote:

> The eighteenth annual Lake Mohonk Conference on Inter-
> national Arbitration will meet by invitation of Albert Smiley
> at Mohonk Lake, New York, May 15–17, the members of

> Abdul Baha Abbas of Persia, leader of the Bahai movement.

Under the headline “ABDUL BAHA LECTURES ON THE
RELIGION OF PEACE”, the Pittsburgh Press on 8 May 1912
reported on `Abdu’l-Bahá’s talk on the night of 7 May in the Hotel
Schenley “to an attentive audience of about 400 persons”:

> He is of absolute simplicity of manner, is unostentatious
> and unpretentious and delivered his message cheerfully, ear-
> nestly and quickly. The Bahai religion emanates from Persia
> and is promulgating an era of peace, and unity in language,

> of Baha-O’llah, who founded the religion. He is venerable in
> appearance, with long white hair and beard, and with strong,
> kindly, peaceful expressive features…

> Abdul-Baha said the Bahais believe in the equality of women
> with men, for until women have an equal voice in the affairs
> of the world, war will not be abolished. They believe in the
> harmony of science and religion; in the oneness of life with

> ditions; in temperate, reasonable living; in being happy and
> contented; and in following the teachings of the founder of
> the religion of love, Jesus of Nazareth.

Under the heading “JERSEY CITY TO HEAR A PEACE MIS-
SIONARY” , The Urban Gazette, number 25104, wrote on 16
May 1912:

Speaking of the general theme of `Abdu’l-Bahá’s discourses and the
influence He had exerted on the public, “The World” as established
by Joseph Pulitzer, wrote on 13 July 1912 in the section “Notes and
News of the Churches”:

> wave of influence toward Christian harmony and Christian
> recognition of a wider unity which is to comprise a real

When `Abdu’l-Bahá reached London, after His visit to North America,
reporters asked Him about the purpose of His visit. He said:

> I have come from America where I travelled for nine months. I
> went to every city, spoke in their churches and meeting places.

> I was invited to many conferences, such as the Lake Mohonk,

He was again asked on 27 December about the purpose of His visit.
He said: “I have come to promote divine civilization, the civilization that
Bahá’u’lláh has established in the east, the civilization that would promote
good character, the civilization that is the cause of universal peace, the
civilization that promotes the unity of humankind.”53

Reflection
`Abdu’l-Bahá’s childhood journey in the mid-1800’s was arduous

> and fraught with hazards. It was intended to root out the influence
> of His Father’s Teachings and extinguish the Light of His Cause. It
> was a journey imposed on Him by temporal tyrannical authorities,
> a journey that presaged no return to His homeland. That journey
> involved a sojourn of ten years in Baghdad, four months in Constan-
> tinople (Istanbul), five years in Adrianople (Edirne), and ultimately
> consigned Him to spend the rest of His life in a penal colony of the
> Ottoman Empire, which is a part of Israel today. Bahá’u’lláh and His

family reached the shores of the Holy Land in 1868. The imperial
decree, issued under pressure from Persian authorities, which brought
Bahá’u’lláh and His family to `Akká, fulfilled scriptural prophecies
about the Lord of Hosts appearing in the Promised Land.

`Abdu’l-Bahá’s journey to the West was also arduous and fraught with

> hazards. However, unlike His childhood journey, it was initiated
> without the intervention of any temporal power. It was a journey
> undertaken when He was finally free to go where He pleased and
> over which He had full authority, a journey that blazoned the name
> of Bahá’u’lláh and spread the Light of His Revelation far and wide. It
> was the exact opposite of what the adversaries had hoped to achieve.
> The scheme of sending Bahá’u’lláh to a place where His followers
> could not reach Him, resulted, sixty years later, in the Centre of His
> Covenant appearing in the western world, where He raised the ban-
> ner of His Cause among the people eager to hear His message, and
> won the admiration of those genuinely interested in the oneness of
> humanity and the establishment of an enduring peace.
