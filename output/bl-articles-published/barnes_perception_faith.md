> **Abstract:**  
>   
> Attaining eternal life has concerned the human soul for millennia. Using statements from many Scriptures, but especially the Bahá’í Writings, this paper will argue that entering into eternal life is both a change of being and of perception, an ontological leap and an epistemological one. The process starts with a mystical perception, like the kind that one thief experienced during the crucifixion of Christ.  
>   
> From there the paper moves to a discussion of the two natures of man. One nature is the temporal self, called the ego. The other is the eternal self, activated and nourished only by God's Word. These two selves are opposing conditions of existence. Thus, no transformational connection can unite them.  
>   
> The next part of the discussion focuses upon the age-old issue of faith versus good deeds as the necessary means for attaining eternal life. The Bahá’í writings say that good actions performed without knowledge of God "cannot be the cause of eternal salvation" and "entrance into the Kingdom of God" because they do not bring about a conscious perception of eternity. Faith is predicated upon knowledge and perception, and then good deeds. "By faith is meant, first, conscious knowledge, and second, the practice of good deeds."  
>   
> The final part of the paper discusses the condition called in the Bahá’í writings the spirit of faith, where the soul is granted "the gift of faith" and its latent powers awaken. Faith and eternal life are, then, a spiritual resurrection into a larger mental existence that expands the powers of the soul.

Perception Into Faith: A Radical Discontinuity Within Unity

by William Barnes

nyone fam il i ar with the New Testament synoptic Gospels knows that differences over the life and

A       genealogy of Christ exist in their accounts. One curious example of this is their treatment of the

events taking place around the crucifixion of Jesus. All four mention that two other ind iv idu al s
were strung up with Him, one to either side. John simply mentions them, except to report that late in
the afternoon they had their legs broken so they might not linger into the following day and have their
groans spoil everybody’s Sabbath. Matthew, faithful to the earlier penned account of Mark, reports the
additional piece of biography that these two ind iv iduals were thieves, and goes on to inform us that,
blind to the last, these unrepentant souls went to their death jeering Christ. But Luke has a different
version of what transpired between these three dying figures. Luke says that one thief truly reco g n iz ed
C hr ist and asked that Christ remember him when He came into His heavenly kingdom. His reward for
this sincere eleventh-hour request is Chr is t’s promise that the thief shall have eternal life alongside Chr is t
in paradise.

Such a wide variance is, I think, a result not of sloppy reporting of the facts, but of the different
mean in gs that the writers or compilers of each gospel wished to bring out of the events of the day. The
modern skeptical temper tends to think that the accounts of Matthew or Mark probably have the essen-
tial facts of the story right. If such facts are the real interest of the crucifixion, then Luke, or whoever
wrote the gospel with his name attached to it, is easily dismissed as just another propagandist for a lot
of hokum about an afterlife. Yet Luke may have been telling another kind of story. His version means
to get readers to look past a poor carpenter to see a Being so loving that even His own death agonies do
not stop the flow of compassion to others, and that in the life and action of such a Being resides the key
to everlasting life for all.

Maybe Christ did miraculously walk out of His tomb, but to give life to another at the moment of los-
ing His own is the real miracle and the real message of His mission. To obtain this everlasting existence
people must, like the thief, see past the expiring body called Jesus to the eternal Christ shining in
unchangeable splendor. To see Him as he saw Himself is the necessary requirement to be with Him. The
thief redeems himself and his whole sorry existence in this single, final act of revolutionary perception,
and by this act this social misfit became an exemplar, not only of every man’s search for true life but
also of God’s delight in bestowing that life to whomever sincerely asks for it, at any moment and under
any set of circumstances, no matter what the life lived to that moment. Any discussion of the life-affirm-
ing mission of the Prophet and His Words must make stories like this the cornerstone of its argument.
Being one of the central myths about humanity, Luke’s account tells us about more than one man. It
explicates the race.

Human Natures

The Holy Books tell us that the human being is a double-natured creature, where the word nature
denotes the animating and organizing power behind a recognizable form of itself. Thus if the individ-
ual is two natures he has two forms. As far as this life is concerned human beings are composed of a
body or outer form, which comes forth from earth, and a soul or inner form which is sent forth from
eternity.1 Each returns in some form to its original homeland at death.

Lights of ‘Irfán

But though double natured, every individual is, nevertheless, one entity: a unity structured as a kind
of polarity—we’ll return to this word. Thus, as all the religions tell us, the human self is really two selves
in relation. One part is the an im al self, called the ego, the self building up around and concerning itself
with bodily experiences and material life. The other is the spiritual self, the expressions of the aware-
ness of eternity.

The animal spirit incarnate in the ego is the originator of everything selfish, narrow and beastly in
man. Hence the ego is not a particularly happy, friendly or generous fellow. He is, in fact, what is meant
by the traditional designations of Lucifer, the light-b r in ger rising at the dawn of every life to lead way-
farers astray into the path of self-love.2

And as another name for this execrable creature indicates, the ego is not really one personality but a
“legion” of “multiple identities born of passion and desire:”3 a raucous pandemonium of contentious, con-
tradictory, screaming monkeys which give the appearance of emanating from a single intelligence and
holding together for some over-riding purpose only because they are associated with an object existing
within conventionally known limits of space and time, namely, the body. He is the tendency to self-will,
chaos and destruction: defensive, fretful, sulky and murderous. He sees the world as an anarchic scram-
ble after material comfort and security which can only be obtained either by those strong enough to
impose their will upon others, or by those who live in strict accordance with the strong man’s wishes.
In his largest form he is the Leviathan of Hobbes and the Bible, and he is huge only because his materi-
al appetites are insatiable. In his smallest form he is a wh in in g, wheedl in g, hypochondriac playing on his
supposed helplessness to get others sympathies. In either incarnation his concern is chiefly with hinder-
ing others freedom and purpose to maximize his own.

In any form this satanic self is obviously not what religious scripture means by man’s true self, that
part of every person said to be made in the image and likeness of God. This second part of man is called
the eternal self and it, too, can be said to have two parts: an individuality, or soul, metaphorically inhab-
ited by a greater creative spirit, called Holy. Thus ‘Abdu’l-Bahá says that “man has a soul in which dwe ll s
the divine spirit.”4 “The divine aspect or spiritual nature,” He says, “consists of the breaths of the Holy
Spirit.”5 These “breaths of the Holy Spirit” are, in their broadest sense, Revelation from God. If this
divine spirit is like the ocean, the individual souls are like its waves. We cannot conceive of an ocean
without waves, and we cannot conceive of waves independently of the ocean.

The divine spirit an im ating man’s eternal self is, according to Bahá’í teac h in gs, the source of all noble
thoughts and emotion, selfless acts and great visions. This eternal self is the tendency in human beings
toward integrating and harmonizing the chaos of ego desires into unified, developing patterns. He is the
urge toward infinity, all human aspirations to be God-like in thought and action.

The eternal self is exuberant, selfless, a lover of freedom, especially for others, and is unified within
himself toward this end for his own freedom is guaranteed in this effort. He is concerned with eternal
life and spiritual ideals. He is huge because he contains all things within himself.6

The eternal world is mostly hidden and religion is meant to inform humanity about it. The eternal self
is, too, mostly hidden and the lives and words of the Prophets are meant to bring it to perception. Satan,
the ego, being, in ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s words, “the product of human minds and of instinctive tendencies
toward error”7 is the doubter of eternity and nobility. The Bible calls him, correctly, the “accuser,”8 and
the Bahá’í Writings “the blamer,”9 because he points the finger at others to prevent his own and prior
sins being noticed, and to prevent others from being inspired by nobility.

The ego is the first self we are aware of because we are first aware of material desires. Once estab-
lished in the soul he loathes renouncing his pr iv il eged position to man’s eternal self, who should right-
fully sit there. The drama of human life is to decide which of these two selves will get the upper hand.
This drama is played out by actors who have radically different ideas about the nature of the play itself.
Thus the Master states: “In man there are two natures; his spiritual or higher nature and his material or
lower nature. In one he approaches God, in the other he lives for the world alone. Signs of both of these
natures are to be found in men.”10

\[2\] Perception Into Faith

The ego opposes the eternal self not because it is created evil, but because it can’t see eternity. It is a
temporal selfhood bound by temporal constraints of thought and passion. To such a personality mater-
ial comfort and power are the only things it makes any sense pursuing in a life dom in ated by the thought
of impending extinction, in a world called by ‘Abdu’l-Bahá “this vanishing world, this death in life.”11
Incapable by himself of experiencing anything other than the world and its laws, the ego thinks eterni-
ty is all a silly piece of imagination ste mm ing from frustrated hopes in life. He works to keep human
vision confined within the cramped, gloomy vault of space and time. In such ways he becomes in
Bahá’u’lláh’s words the “Evil One” that “hindereth the rise and obstructeth the spiritual progress of the
children of men.”12

As the embodiment of radically opposing spiritual conditions, the human soul is in the paradoxical
position of being as close to and as far away from God as it is possible for any creature to be. ‘Abdu’l-
Bahá puts it this way:

> Man is in the highest degree of materiality, and at the beginning of spirituality—that is to say,
> he is the end of imperfection and the beginning of perfection. He is at the last degree of dark-
> ness, and at the beginning of light; that is why it has been said that the condition of man is at
> the end of night and the beginning of day, meaning that he is the sum of all the degrees of
> imperfection, and that he possesses the degrees of perfection. He has the an im al side as well as
> the angelic side, and the aim of the educator is to so train human souls that their angelic aspect
> may overcome their an im al side. Then if the divine power in man, which is his essential per-
> fection, overcomes the satanic power, which is absolute imperfection, he becomes the most
> excellent among creature; but if the satanic power overcome the divine power, he becomes the
> lowest of the creatures. That is why he is the end of imperfection and the beginning of perfec-
> tion. Not in any other of the species in the world of existence is there such a difference, con-
> trast, contradiction and opposition as in the species of man.13
‘Abdu’l-Bahá is not saying here that within man is a graded moral continuum stretching from complete
darkness to total light in which the “end of imperfection and the beginning of perfection” are contigu-
ous points. This would make man single-natured and unconscious like the animal. He is saying that man
is created morally double-natured, and that “the end of imperfection” and “the beginning of perfection”
are polar and hierarchical opposites of light and dark structuring human nature. That is, they do not
form a complementary polarity, but a contradictory one.14 Light and dark are symbols for absolute con-
ditions of existence, and though they stand in a kind of conjunction in thought there can never be any
transformational connection between and uniting them.

Spiritually we live in both conditions at once. Movement is toward one or the other pure condition.

But this movement is like the rising movement from the world of sleep to the world of wakefulness and
the setting decline of wakefulness to sleep. That is, one world simply and completely replaces another.
There is no bridge. It is not a movement between sites on the same plane of existence, like the move-
ment between the bedroom in which one awakens and the kitchen where one prepares breakfast. The two
worlds of the soul express a radical ontological separation, which cannot on these premises be papered
over by any epistemology of being. They are in “contrast, contradiction and opposition.”

There is absolutely nothing positive about being in “the highest degree of materiality.” This is
“absolute imperfection.” This is Satan the ego, the “lowest of creatures” because he intentionally com-
mits evil and consciously leads others to do the same. The “sum of the degrees of imperfection” is its
f in al degree. This is not the palest light of dawn, but the “last degree of darkness,” “the end of night”
or ultimate moral blackness.

There is everything positive about being the “beginning of spirituality.” This is to be the “beginn in g
of light,” its origin and highest point from which all spiritual light in creation emanates. The “begin-
ning of perfection” means to be the highest being in creation because one latently “possesses the degrees
of perfection.” This is “the beginning of day.”

Spiritually, “light does not unite itself with darkness.”15 This can only mean that, too, darkness wants
no part of light. All action within the soul is therefore apocalyptic. It is life or death.16 All or nothing.

Lights of ‘Irfán

There is no both/and, only either/or at this level. Whoever is not with me is against me, says the Chr is t.
There can be no fence sitters. The lukewarm are the most execrable. Those with “lifeless hearts” can never
approach Him. The gradu al is ts have no place.

In an apocalyptic world a person can be the incarnation of Satan his whole life, but on the cross of
extinction he may see the Light, act and win eternal life. Likewise a person may have been the incarna-
tion of pious devotion yet, as Bahá’u’lláh warns, “at the hour of his soul’s ascension, been so changed as
to fall into the nethermost fire.”17 Because change is all or nothing at all in an apocalypse, spiritually
the smallest is the same as the largest. Hence ‘Abdu’l-Bahá asserts that: “For no veil is greater than ego-
tism and no matter how thin the covering may be, yet will it finally veil man entirely and prevent him
from receiving his portion of the eternal bounty.”18 And Christ can tell His disciples of workers in a field
where the last to arrive at the end of the day get the same pay as the first to work at the crack of dawn.19

Good Deeds Not Enough

The apocalyptic ontology of the Holy Books is the source of the Prophets continually pointing to the
workings of the uncomfortable ethical principle that good actions performed without knowledge of
God—which doesn’t mean acting solely with an eye to heavenly reward, but with the understanding that
righteous acts are a praise of God and flow out from the promptings of an eternal Self—such good acts,
however praiseworthy and helpful they may be, “cannot be the cause of eternal salvation” and “entrance
into the Kingdom of God”20 because they do not bring about a conscious perception of eternity.21

An act done without this dimension of awareness is not a perfect act, and one must be perfect “as
your Father which is in heaven is perfect”22 if one is to enter eternity. Now perfection for humanity, what-
ever the moral philosophers tell us, can never mean without ethical blemish. If being stainless is the cri-
teria we are all going to be roasted, so we might as well get on enjoying what time we have here. Neither
can perfection mean to do as well as God does. Not being God all human acts are by definition imper-
fect. Here, the mechanical workings of an indifferent, abstract moral law would also automatically dis-
patch everyone to hell.

But perfection is some sense must be achievable since Christ said we are to be perfect. A key to the
whole question lies in the word holiness, which is wholeness. A perfect act is a completed one. This does
not mean an act ending in time. It means any act predicated upon the perception of eternity.

Every kind of perception is through a faculty, sight through the eyes, hearing through the ears,
abstract knowledge through the intellect. The perceptual faculty through which human beings perceive
eternity is the human heart, which doesn’t mean the throbbing organ in the middle of the chest but the
sensitive receiver at the center of being. The heart is the connection with eternity because Bahá’u’lláh
says it is the “seat of the revelation of the inner mysteries of God.”23

When Bahá’u’lláh says, “Our mission is to seize and possess the hearts of men,”24 He means His
Revelation will throw open “the doors of the hearts of men, which in reality are the doors of heaven”25
so that latent spiritual powers and perceptions may awaken, enabling the soul to see eternal things and
things eternally, and to do eternally effective actions.

The Manifestations have all been chiefly concerned with developing this faculty of faith, for faith
which means knowledge of God or the recognition of His Manifestation and obedience to His laws,26
depends upon its healthy functioning. Humankind has mostly ignored Them, and this failure to perceive
what the Manifestations were telling us about our true Self has caused a decline in the power of this fac-
ulty to perceive, and this causes man to lose faith in himself.27

The age-old dispute over salvation by faith or works alone is fallacious since it overlooks the fact that
faith is an inner act, a form of perception. Both faith and works are necessary for salvation, but faith is
first as a precondition for spiritual works. “By faith is meant, first, conscious knowledge, and second,
the practice of good deeds,” says ‘Abdu’l-Bahá.28 “Deeds are secondary to faith in Him and certitude in
His Reality,” says the Báb.29 Outer works are necessary as an expression and demonstration, that is a com-
pleting and perfecting, of inner faith. It is faith that inspires deeds, while deeds realize faith.

\[4\] Perception Into Faith

Salvation by works alone says that, ideally, good works must lead up to faith and then lead out from it.

This is true, but not in the sense of the moral continuum with the middle point separating the least evil
act from the least good one. The soul, as we saw, is not on a moral continuum.30 It is a conjunction of
radically opposing conditions of being, one tending “towards moral sublimity and intellectual perfec-
tion, while the other turneth to bestial degradation and carnal imperfections.”31 The soul’s movements
are apocalyptic. Faith is, initially, not a transforming but a transmuting act.32 It redeems and completes
those imperfect acts leading up to it and informs those acts leading out from it. It completes life by
recreating and renewing it, making it holy or whole, changing becoming into a form of being.
Bahá’u’lláh states: “Whosoever acknowledged His truth and turned unto Him, his good works out-
weighed his misdeeds, and all his sins were remitted and forgiven. Thereby is the truth of these words
concerning Him made manifest: ‘Swift is He in reckoning.’ Thus God turneth iniquity into righteous-
ness, were ye to explore the realms of divine knowledge, and fathom the mysteries of His wisdom.”33

Faith may come at any moment. Hence there can be no critical mass of accumulated good works,
which by sheer weight will automatically swing open heaven’s doors. If eternal life could be won this way,
then we may rightly revolt against heaven’s ways when a pathetically wrong ind iv idual like the thief wins
the grand prize simply through the ludicrously good fortune of accidentally being in the right place at
the right time and saying just the right thing. But more than this, salvation by works alone makes the
Prophets and Their Message irrelevant to renewing and running human society.

What makes an action holy, or complete and perfect, is not, finally, any quality which the doer brings
to the action, such as purity of intention or efficiency of execution. What makes an action holy is God’s
acceptance of it.34 For if we knew how to perform holy actions and did them, then God Himself would
become irrelevant for spiritual growth and individual salvation.

Holiness, or completion by divine acceptance, is what separates an act of faith from a merely good
act. Seeking divine acceptance is the essential aspect missing from good deeds performed by follow in g
“a mere code of laws” whether society’s or one’s own, since Bahá’u’lláh says “all things are dependent
upon His Will, and the worth of all acts is conditioned upon His acceptance and pleasure.”35

To say deeds lead up to faith is therefore technically misleading. One attains faith by opening a new
center of perceptual awareness. And the perception which opens eternity to view was stated by Christ:
“Whosoever will save his life shall lose it; and whosoever will lose his life for My sake shall find it.”36
Initially, faith is a connection of love not effort. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá says:

> For faith, which is life eternal, is a sign of bounty, and not the result of justice. The flame of
> the fire of love, in this world of earth and water, comes through the power of attraction and not
> by effort and striv in g. Nevertheless, by effort and perseverance, knowledge, science and other
> perfections can be acquired; but only the light of the Divine Beauty can transport and move the
> spirits through the force of attraction.37
Of course any humanitarian deed is meritorious and is worthy of respect and reward. “For every act
performed there shall be a recompense according to the estimate of God,” says Bahá’u’lláh.38 But acts car-
ried out with no real thought taken for the soul’s uplift express no conscious spirituality—that is, they
express no attraction for God, only a form of socially-conditioned conscience. Thus even an infinity of
movement toward “good” along the horizontal social axis of good and evil gains one not a millimeter
of vertical lift toward eternity.39 Further, the nearly perfect is as far away as the grossly imperfect,
because both are part of a different internal order of being and awareness. Any attachment to this world
is the limiting ego at work, and even attachment to the improvement of this world alone is a form of
this attachment. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá puts the principle this way:

> The foundation of success and salvation is the knowledge of God, and the results of the knowl-
> edge of God are the good actions which are the fruits of faith. If man has not this knowledge,
> he will be separated from God, and when this separation exists, good actions will not have com-
> plete effect…the foundation is to know God, and the good actions result from this knowledge.
> (G)ood actions alone, without the knowledge of God, cannot be the cause of eternal salvation,
> everlasting success, and prosperity, and entrance into the Kingdom of God.40

Lights of ‘Irfán

The thief on the cross performed the one redemptive act an individual must perform to gain eternity.

He saw Reality and gave himself over to it.41 In this act he purified (i.e., made holy) his entire existence
because he attained the real purpose of every human life. He recognized that since the Prophet sees deep-
est into Reality, His Message alone defines the good. He defines the good as seeing as He does and seek-
ing after eternity or the Kingdom of God, all other things “shall be added unto you” once this search
gets up in earnest. It is to enable every seeking soul to find the Kingdom of God within him that the
Prophets come into the world.

Hence we return to the hill of Calvary where the thief finds that Chr is t’s promise of eternal life fol-
lows immediately upon his just awakened perception of eternity embodied in Him, as it did just as sud-
denly upon Peter’s declaration of the Sonship of Christ. Some kind of revolutionary leap is indicated in
this story, and it is worthwhile inquiring into what happened within the soul of that thief in that holy
moment. This will provide us with some comprehension of the nature of faith and with some under-
standing of spiritual growth and resurrection. Too, we shall find that the contradictory polar opposition
that constitutes human nature and that divided the ethical action also divides into levels of perception.

The Revolutionary Leap

Every human being is born into a dying world, and for as long as he identifies himself with that world
and its limitations he, too, is a dying form of life, capable only of delaying but not overcoming the pull
of nature toward extinction. To live eternally the ind iv idual must be granted the gift of faith, for the
Master tells us that the “meaning of eternal life is the gift of the Holy Spirit.”42 It is obtaining the power
of true vision. This is a vision, however incomplete, not of the future but of Reality—the kind of expe-
rience we mean when we say things like “the veil lifted” or “the scales fell from my eyes.” So far as per-
ceiving eternity is concerned, Bahá’u’lláh informs us that “none discerneth in this day save those who
have been granted vision by this sublime Beauty.”43

The Bahá’í Writings call entering into conscious communion with the Holy Spirit entering into the
spirit of faith. Being a connection between two sentient spirits, however radically different in essence,
faith, then, is a higher way of perception and know in g, not a bottomless mental abyss into which one
must blindly plummet so that Providence can demonstrate its ability to rescue human beings from their
worst suicidal tendencies. Faith is a spiritual resurrection or move into a larger mental existence. Faith
expands not demands the intellectual powers of the soul. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá says some extraord in ary things
about souls in this state of existence:

> The fourth degree of spirit is the heavenly spirit; it is the spirit of faith and the bounty of God;
> it comes from the breath of the Holy Spirit, and by the divine power it becomes the cause of
> eternal life. It is the power which makes the earthly man heavenly, and the imperfect man per-
> fect. It makes the impure to be pure, the silent eloquent; it purifies and sanctifies those made
> captive by carnal desires; it makes the ignorant wise.44
In another place He described this state more fully:

> But the spirit of faith which is of the Kingdom consists of the all-comprehending grace and the
> perfect attainment and the power of sanctity and the divine effulgence from the Sun of Truth
> on luminous light-seeking essences from the presence of the divine Unity. And by this Spirit is
> the life of the spirit of man, when it is fortified thereby, as Christ saith: ‘That which is born of
> the Spirit is Spirit.’ And this Spirit hath both restitution and return, inasmuch as it consists of
> the Light of God and the unconditioned grace. So, having regard to this state and station, Chr is t
> announced that John the Baptist was Elias, who was to come before Chr is t. And the likeness of
> this station is as that of lamps kindled: for these in respect to their glasses and oil-holders are
> different, but in respect to their light, One, and in respect to their lum in ation, One; nay, each
> one is identical with the other, without imputation of plurality, or diversity or multiplicity or
> separateness. This is the Truth and beyond Truth there is only error.45
The spiritually unenlightened human spirit, He says, “consists of the rational, or logical, reasoning
faculty, which apprehends general ideas and things intelligible and perceptible.”46 is part of the world and

\[6\] Perception Into Faith

lives for it unless the spirit of faith is awakened and perceptions of the reality of eternity are opened.
This occurs only when the soul voluntarily surrenders itself to the Prophet and His Message.

In the spirit of faith knowledge is a direct perception of realities, what traditional philosophers called
knowledge of thi ngs, not knowledge about things.47 With direct perception there is no need of logical or
rational arguments, neither experiment nor hypothesis is required.48 For these in relation to direct per-
ception are themselves veils of knowledge, and not knowledge itself. In direct perception the ind iv idual
sees behind an expiring body of things called the material world to perceive their revealed forms stand-
ing within it. Comprehension becomes apprehension, because knowledge is no longer conceptual but
existential, that is, a permanent part of one’s existence. Epistemologically, creation is no longer purely
objective, i.e., an alien body of objects confronting the inquiring intelligence. But neither are these
objects purely subjective. In faith, creation and reason form an identity—two parts of one unmediated
unity, which is the basis of true understand in g.

The soul in the spirit of faith is a living power. Such a soul, Christ said, was “a son of God” like Him,
though to an incalculably lesser degree. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá says: “The station which he who hath truly recog-
n iz ed this Revelation will attain is the same as the one ord a in ed for such prophets of the house of Israel
as are not regarded as Manifestations ‘endowed with constancy.’”49 And Bahá’u’lláh says: “O My Servant!
Obey Me and I shall make thee like unto Myself. I say ‘Be,’ and it is, and thou shalt say ‘Be,’ and it shall
be.”50 Such souls, the Book of Revelation tells us, “may have right to the tree of life.”51

Yet the soul that passes from the human spirit into the spirit of faith undergoes no change of nature
or alteration of essence. It remains unchanged in its fundamental reality, yet experiences a tremendous
and concentrated infusion of power. This causes the individual to resemble a fissioning atom, the inrush-
ing force knocking him out of his established orbit of experience into another and larger one, trans-
forming his ways of thought, perception and behavior and acting as the authority for later acts and state-
ments. He becomes a satellite of a Greater Selfhood, orbiting the Manifestation of God.52

In this new configuration of the psyche, what has occurred is not that a new center has come into
being, but that the soul has come into awareness of the center of itself that has always been, the Power
that is dr iv ing it. The experience of having touched one’s essential humanity, the infinite Selfhood
Bahá’u’lláh says is “standing within thee,”53 is usually described as an ecstasy, a word carrying overtones
of both connectedness and separation. It unites the ind iv idual within himself and with the humanity of
all, but divides him from his fellow beings who have not had this experience. Yet the authentic experi-
ence of eternity does not divide the soul from his society by a quixotic withdrawal into a private utopia.
No, he joins what Saint Augustine called the Commonwealth of the Sa in ts, for at its highest intensity
the true religious experience teaches or shows to the soul not just the reality of himself, but real human-
ity as a kingdom of power and glory of which faithful souls are its real members and the Prophets its
real kings. This experience prepares the soul, is its initiation, for a spiritual world where souls “shall
associate and commune intimately one with another, and shall be so closely associated in their lives,
their aspirations, their aim and striv in gs as to be even as one soul.”54

Every human being is born into the world at birth and borne out of it by death. The def in ing aim of
the human spirit is the urge toward transcendence. This urge is fulfilled by a sacrificial offering of self,
which means the deliberate attempt to make sacred some part of one’s life, a turning of passion into com-
passion. What the soul has sacrificed of its life is what returns to eternity at death. The ultimate act of
this kind is to sacrifice one’s entire self; that is, to make one’s entire life sacred, as the thief did. Only
in this act does the soul transcend all human limitations and achieve real eternal life, which is the only
kind of life that the Holy Books recognize.55 It is this perception that both brings and begins faith.

Notes
1) “It is manifest that beyond this material body, man is endowed with another reality, which is the world of exemplars con-

> stituting the heavenly body of man...This other and inner reality is called the heavenly body, the ethereal form which cor-
> responds to this body.” (‘Abdu’l-Bahá, 1982. The Promulgation of Universal Peace. Wilmette: Bahá’í Publishing Trust, pp.
> 464–465.) The human soul, says Bahá’u’lláh, “is, in itself, a testimony that beareth witness to the existence of a world
> that is contingent, as well as to the reality of a world that hath neither beginning nor end.” (Bahá’u’lláh, 1976. Glean in gs
> from the Writings of Bahá’u’lláh. Second Revised Edition. Wilmette: Bahá’í Publ is h ing Trust, pp. 161–162.)

14) A complementary polarity is like that of humanity, where the complements, male and female, exist on the same plane,

> within the same Kingdom. Complements work together and are attracted to each other. As we say, “opposites attract.” In
> a contradictory polarity, the “poles” do not exist on the same plane, but are from different, i.e., higher and lower,
> Kingdoms of spirit. They do not work together, but against one another; each works to overcome the other. Here oppo-
> sites repel. Transformation is the condition of mortality and the eternal does not become mortal and vice-versa. In anoth-
> er place ‘Abdu’l-Bahá states: “For the inner reality of man is a demarcation line between the shadow and the light, a place
> where the two seas meet; it is the lowest point on the arc of descent and therefore is capable of gaining all the grades

26) “The first duty prescribed by God for His servants is the recognition of Him Who is the Day Spring of His Revelation

> and the Fountain of His laws, Who representeth the Godhead in both the Kingdom of His Cause and the world of cre-
> ation. Whoso achieveth this duty hath at ta in ed unto all good; and whoso is deprived thereof, hath gone astray, though
> he be the author of every righteous deed. It behoveth every one who reacheth this most sublime station, this summit of
> transcendent glory, to observe every ord in ance of Him Who is the Desire of the world. These twin duties are insepara-
> ble. Neither is acceptable without the other.” (Bahá’u’lláh. Glean in gs, pp. 330–331) This two-fold obligation is, in reality,
> the two aspects of belief. For out from the act of recognition flow socially redeeming acts, the greatest of which is get-
> ting others to see Reality.

30) The works alone argument is really a works first argument. It grows from a deification of society. It hinges on the belief

> that the social law of right and wrong is a perfect image of the life and death dichotomy of the soul. It isn’t. Ever. Deeds
> without faith move the soul along the right or left side of the axial midpoint of social morality. But after faith deeds
> revolve the soul toward the center of being, so that by effort souls perfect the perfect state. In purely spiritual terms the

32) Transformation is changing the form of a thing into something else in the same kingdom of existence. Transmuting is

> c h an ging the nature of the thing. That is, there is transformation within conditions of existence, but not between them.
> A progressive transformation within a condition or Kingdom of existence reveals more complexity within the possibili-
> ties (qualities) of development of that condition, but no number of transformations adds up to a transmutation. A trans-
> mutation reveals qualities that cannot be manifested within the possibilities of a lower condition. The lower is not evil,
> but simply constrained by inherent limitations from manifesting the qualities of the higher. Transmutation is a differ-
> ence of not, not of degree. It is the kind of thing Bahá’u’lláh refers to when he says that the “task of converting satanic
> strength into heavenly power is one that We have been empowered to accomplish.” (Bahá’u’lláh. Gleanings, p. 200)

34) “Man’s actions are acceptable after his having recognized (the Manifestation).” (Bahá’u’lláh. Epistle to the Son of the

> Wolf, p. 61) In one clear instance Bahá’u’lláh writes, “For the doings of men are all dependent upon Thy good pleasure,
> and are conditioned by Thy behest. Shouldst Thou regard him who hath broken the fast as one who hath observed it, such
> a man would be reckoned among them who from eternity hath been keeping the fast. And shouldst Thou decree that he
> who hath observed the fast hath broken it, that person would be numbered with such as have caused the Robe of Thy
> Revelation to be sta in ed with dust, and been far removed from the crystal waters of this living Fountain...the excellence
> of all things is dependent upon Thy bidding and Thy word, and the virtue of every act is conditioned by Thy leave and
> the good pleasure of Thy will, and may recognize that the reins of men’s doings are within the grasp of Thine acceptance
> and Thy commandment.” (Bahá’í Prayers. 1991 edition. Wilmette: Bahá’í Publ is h ing Trust. pp. 262–263.)

41) “Know thou that faith is of two kinds. The first is objective faith that is expressed by the outer man, obedience of the

> limbs and senses. The other faith is subjective, the unconscious obedience to the will of God. There is no doubt that, in
> the day of a Manifestation such as Christ, all contingent beings possessed subjective faith and had unconscious obedi-
> ence to His Holiness Christ.
> “For all parts of the creational world are of one whole. Christ the Manifestor reflecting the divine sun represented the

> words, of such faith there is very little in any age. That is why His Holiness Christ said to His followers, ‘Many are called

> been praiseworthy, and not the limited knowledge that hath sprung forth from veiled and obscured minds. This limited

48) “As to thy question regarding discoveries made by the soul after it hath put off its human form: certainly, that world is
