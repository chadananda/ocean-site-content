> **Abstract:** The Bahá’í texts touch on many facets of faithfulness: being faithful as an individual; God being faithful to His people; believers being faithful to the Covenant established by Bahá’u’lláh; Bahá’u’lláh calling the believers of a former era to be faithful to the new Manifestation of God. For people, faithfulness is a state of being, an attitude of mind and soul that reflects itself in behaviour and deeds, a spiritual quality that manifests itself in relationships as, for example, loyalty, trustworthiness and reliability. This is a preliminary examination of the concept of faithfulness in Bahá’í English-language texts and the behaviours expected from those who are faithful.

   The Concept of ‘Faithfulness’ in the
> Bahá’í Texts in English Translation

Wendi Momen

The Bahá’í texts abound with references to faithfulness:
being faithful as an individual; God being faithful to His
people; believers being faithful to the Covenant established by
Bahá’u’lláh; Bahá’u’lláh calling the believers of a former era to
be faithful to the new Manifestation of God. For people,
faithfulness is a state of being, an attitude of mind and soul
that reflects itself in behaviour and deeds, a spiritual quality
that manifests itself in relationships as, for example, loyalty,
trustworthiness and reliability.

This is a preliminary examination of the concept of
faithfulness in Bahá’í English-language texts and the behaviours
expected from those who are faithful.1

Dictionary definitions of faithful

Dictionaries provide a large number of definitions for the
word ‘faithful’:
o strict or thorough in the performance of duty: a faithful

worker
o true to one’s word, promises, vows, etc.
226                                             Lights of Irfán vol. 17

o steady in allegiance or affection; loyal; constant: faithful

friends
> o reliable, trusted, or believed
o adhering or true to fact, a standard, or an original;

accurate: a faithful account; a faithful copy
> o obsolete. full of faith; believing
o the faithful; the believers, the body of loyal members of

any party or group
Some of these definitions relate to objects, such as a faithful
copy of something, for example, a manuscript or model train;
or to the accuracy or truth of an idea. Most, however, can be
ascribed to the people. Some also relate to God and His
Manifestations and their relationship with people.
Dictionaries also provide synonyms for ‘faithfulness’:

> o true, devoted, staunch
o faithful, constant, loyal imply qualities of stability,

dependability, and devotion.
o faithful implies long-continued and steadfast fidelity to

> whatever one is bound to by a pledge, duty, or
> obligation: a faithful friend
o constant suggests firmness and           steadfastness      in

attachment: a constant affection
o loyal implies unswerving allegiance to a person,

> organization, cause, or idea: loyal to one’s associates,
> one’s country
o precise, exact
These definitions and synonyms are helpful when considering
the way in which the concept of faithfulness is used in the
English translations of Bahá’í texts.

Concept of “Faithfulness”                                      227

Some of the contexts in which ‘faithfulness’ is used in
Bahá’í texts

The concept of ‘faithfulness’ is used in a variety of contexts
within the Bahá’í writings and texts in English. These largely
correspond with the variety of definitions of the term and
synonyms found in dictionaries. While any selection of
categories in which ‘faithfulness’ or similar terms are used
cannot be exact, nevertheless it is useful for a deeper
understanding of the concept to group together those which
seem generally to relate to the same ideas. These are my own
categories and understandings and I do not wish to suggest that
they are anything more than one way to study the concept of
faithfulness, which appears so often in the Bahá’í writings. Thus
these categories imprecise and fluid and if a particular
quotation is categorized in one way and could be categorized in
another, this merely demonstrates the limitations of the
exercise.

With this caveat in mind, below are the categories of the
concept of ‘faithfulness’ and related ideas, such as loyalty and
fidelity, which are I have found most frequently in the available
Bahá’í writings and texts in English, along with some examples
of each.

The two primary ways in which the concept of ‘faithfulness’
is used in the Bahá’í writings is in relation to God and His
Manifestations, on the one hand, and in relation to people, on
the other. Each of these has numerous ways which the term
‘faithfulness’ or ‘faithful’ is used and I have selected several of
these by way of example. Thus in relation to the faithfulness of
God and His Manifestations, we find ‘Faithfulness as one of the
attributes of God’, ‘God is faithful to His promises’.
‘Manifestations are faithful mirrors of the divine’ and other
ways in which the writings convey to human beings ideas and
realities that are actually beyond their comprehension.

228                                            Lights of Irfán vol. 17

In conveying the idea of faithfulness as it relates to human
beings, the writings seem to describe many more forms of
faithfulness that take account of the myriad ways in which
people think, behave and work with others, or ought to do; and
their spiritual condition. Thus we find texts that remind us that
‘people are to be faithful to God’, explain how we can ‘develop
the spiritual quality of faithfulness’, describe how we are to
relate to others, and outline the implications of being faithful,
and unfaithful, for all people in general and for followers of
Bahá’u’lláh in particular. Some texts describe particular
attitudes that need to be developed to be a considered a faithful
person, others look at actions and deeds that need to be done.
The writings give examples of faithful people who have been
spiritual lives and qualities are worthy of emulation; indeed
‘Abdu’l-Bahá has composed a large number of tributes to such
individuals, brought together in the book Memorials of the
Faithful.

A third important way in which the concept of faithfulness is
used in the writings is in the context of unfaithfulness, those
who are not faithful, those who have broken the Covenant.
Further, there are references to faithfulness in some of the
mystical writings of Bahá’u’lláh and references to the Faithful
Spirit.

The Faithfulness of God and His Manifestations

The concept of the faithfulness of God and His
Manifestations appears numerous times in the Bahá’í texts. It is
presented as absolute truth, a statement of fact that is
foundational to one’s understanding of the nature of religion
and of the attributes of God.

Faithfulness as one of the attributes of God

It is axiomatic in the Bahá’í teachings that God is ‘the
unknowable Essence’ and is ‘immensely exalted beyond every

Concept of “Faithfulness”                                         229

human attribute, such as corporeal existence, ascent and
descent, egress and regress’ [GWB 46]. People come to know
about God through His Manifestations, ‘those luminous Gems
of Holiness’, who ‘appear out of the realm of the spirit, in the
noble form of the human temple’ and are ‘made manifest unto
all men, that they may impart unto the world the mysteries of
the unchangeable Being, and tell of the subtleties of His
imperishable Essence’ [GWB 47]. It is by ‘the revelation of these
Gems of Divine virtue’ that ‘all the names and attributes of
God, such as knowledge and power, sovereignty and dominion,
mercy and wisdom, glory, bounty, and grace, are made manifest’
[GWB 48]. God ‘chose to confer upon man the unique distinction
and capacity to know Him and to love Him’ and upon ‘the
reality of man’ has ‘focused the radiance of all of His names and
attributes, and made it a mirror of His own Self’ [GWB 65].
‘Abdu’l-Bahá explained that ‘Just as the light and effulgence of
the sun when cast upon a polished mirror are reflected fully,
gloriously, so, likewise, the qualities and attributes of Divinity
are radiated from the depths of a pure human heart’ [PUP 69] and
therefore the ‘most important thing is to polish the mirrors of
hearts in order that they may become illumined and receptive of
the divine light’ [PUP 14].

Thus it is that human beings come to ‘know’ God and His
attributes and try to reflect them. Among the attributes of God
described in the Bahá’í writings is faithfulness:

> I call on Thee O Exalted One, O Faithful One, O
> Glorious One! Thou the Sufficing, Thou the Healing,
> Thou the Abiding, O Thou Abiding One! — Bahá’u’lláh
> [BP 102]

> Verily thy Lord is the faithful, the perfect. — Bahá’u’lláh
> [BS 193]

> No God is there save Thee, the Strong and the Faithful.

— Bahá’u’lláh [BP 25]
230                                             Lights of Irfán vol. 17

> Verily, Thou art the All-Powerful, the Ever-Faithful, the
> Omnipotent. — The Báb [SWB 4]

God is faithful to His promises

The keeping of promises is highly valued by many as a sign of
a person’s trustworthiness and reliability. The promises God are
even more significant, as are part of the Greater Covenant
‘which every Manifestation of God makes with His followers,
promising that in the fullness of time a new Manifestation will
be sent, and taking from them the undertaking to accept Him
when this occurs’.2 That promise is often cast in religious
scripture as a prophecy of events that will occur in the end time
or in thousands of years:

> Verily Thou art God, the Lord of creation, the
> All-Sufficing. Thou art faithful to Thy promise and
> doest whatsoever Thou pleasest. — The Báb [SWB 209]

> When Bahá’u’lláh arrived at this prison in the Holy
> Land, discerning souls were awakened to the fact that
> the prophecies which God had voiced through the tongue
> of His Prophets two or three thousand years before had
> been realized and that His Promises had been fulfilled...

— ‘Abdu’l-Bahá [SAQ 37]

> Indeed such a consummation [arrival of Bahá’u’lláh in
> ‘Akká], He assures us, had been actually prophesied
> ‘through the tongue of the Prophets two or three
> thousand years before.’ God, ‘faithful to His promise’,
> had, ‘to some of the Prophets’ ‘revealed and given the
> good news that the “Lord of Hosts should be manifested
> in the Holy Land”.’ Isaiah had, in this connection,
> announced in his Book: ‘Get thee up into the high
> mountain, O Zion that bringest good tidings; lift up thy
> voice with strength, O Jerusalem, that bringest good
> tidings. Lift it up, be not afraid; say unto the cities of

> Judah: “Behold your God! Behold the Lord God will
> come with strong hand, and His arm shall rule for
> Him.”’ David, in his Psalms, had predicted: ‘Lift up your
> heads, O ye gates; even lift them up, ye everlasting
> doors; and the King of Glory shall come in. Who is this
> King of Glory? The Lord of Hosts, He is the King of
> Glory.’ ‘Out of Zion, the perfection of beauty, God hath
> shined. Our God shall come, and shall not keep silence.’
> Amos had, likewise, foretold His coming: ‘The Lord will
> roar from Zion, and utter His voice from Jerusalem; and
> the habitations of the shepherds shall mourn, and the top
> of Carmel shall wither.’ — Shoghi Effendi [GPB 183]

God’s promises to those who are faithful

> Blessed the one who hath remained faithful to the
> Covenant of God... Say: This is the Day of Bounty!
> Bestir yourselves that I may make you monarchs in the
> realms of My Kingdom. If ye follow Me, ye shall behold
> that which ye were promised, and I will make you My
> companions in the dominion of My majesty and the
> intimates of My beauty in the heaven of My power
> forevermore. — Bahá’u’lláh [SLH 64-65]

> No God is there but Him. All creation and its empire are
> His. Unto Him return the works of the faithful. —
> Bahá’u’lláh [SLH 211]

> For verily I say, the heavenly Father is ever with you and
> keeps watch over you. If you be faithful to Him, He will
> assuredly deliver into your hands all the treasures of the
> earth, and will exalt you above all the rulers and kings of
> the world. — The Báb [DB 93]
232                                             Lights of Irfán vol. 17

Manifestations are faithful mirrors of the divine

As we have seen, God makes Himself known to His people
through the Manifestations of God, who have appeared on earth
from time to time throughout the whole created history of
humankind. They are perfect mirrors of all the attributes of
God:

> These Prophets and chosen Ones of God are the
> recipients and revealers of all the unchangeable
> attributes and names of God. They are the mirrors that
> truly and faithfully reflect the light of God. Whatsoever
> is applicable to them is in reality applicable to God,
> Himself, Who is both the Visible and the Invisible. —
> Bahá’u’lláh [KI 141]

> The face of nature is illumined, the grass, the stones, the
> hills and valleys shine; but they shine not of themselves,
> but because they reflect the rays of the sun. It is the sun
> which shines. In the same way, our minds reflect God.
> Those who live thinking good thoughts, doing good
> deeds, and with love in their hearts... A stone reflects
> but slightly the rays of the sun; but if a mirror be held
> up, though it be small, the whole of the sun will be
> reflected in it, because the mirror is clear and bright.
> Just so it is with the minds of men and the Sun of
> Reality. The great Masters and Teachers so purified their
> minds by the love of God and of men that they became
> like polished mirrors, reflecting faithfully the Glory of
> God. — ‘Abdu’l-Bahá [BS 302-303]

People are to be Faithful to God

Faithfulness is a spiritual quality that individuals can develop
as they strive to come closer to God and ‘polish’ the ‘mirrors’ of
their ‘hearts’ [PUP 14]. While the concept of faithfulness is used
to describe a fact about the nature of God and His

Manifestations, when used in relation to human beings it is
often set out as an appeal or injunction for them to improve
their attitude, behaviour and spiritual character, or as a
reminder of the requirements and benefits of spiritual progress.

> O Ye People that Have Minds to Know and Ears to
> Hear! The first call of the Beloved is this: O mystic
> nightingale! Abide not but in the rose garden of the
> spirit. O messenger of the Solomon of love! Seek thou
> no shelter except in the Sheba of the well beloved, and O
> immortal phoenix! dwell not save on the mount of
> faithfulness. Therein is thy habitation, if on the wings of
> thy soul thou soarest to the realm of the infinite and
> seekest to attain thy goal. — Bahá’u’lláh [HW Persian #1]

> Have they not told thee that faithfulness is a duty on
> those who follow the mystic way, that it is the true guide
> to His Holy Presence? — Bahá’u’lláh [FVSV 74]

Human progress requires faithfulness

> All religions teach that we must do good, that we must
> be generous, sincere, truthful, law-abiding, and faithful;
> all this is reasonable, and logically the only way in which
> humanity can progress. — ‘Abdu’l-Bahá [PT 141]

> ... the Divine religions enjoin upon and encourage all the
> faithful to adopt such principles as will conduce to
> continuous improvements, and to acquire from other
> peoples sciences and arts. — ‘Abdu’l-Bahá [SDC 99]

Faithfulness as one of the spiritual qualities of the
human being

> ... human reality stands between the higher and the lower
> in man, between the world of the animal and the world

> of divinity... All the imperfections found in the animal
> are found in man...

> On the other hand, we find in him justice, sincerity,
> faithfulness, knowledge, wisdom, illumination, mercy
> and pity coupled with intellect, comprehension, the
> power to grasp the realities of things and the ability to
> penetrate the truths of existence. All these great
> perfections are to be found in man. — ‘Abdu’l-Bahá [PUP
> 465]

> No attribute is more commendable than faithfulness. It
> is of the greatest of the virtues in the world of
> humanity. — ‘Abdu’l-Bahá [TAB3 634]

Be faithful

> He Who is the Eternal Truth, exalted be His glory, hath
> ever loved faithfulness. Well is it with him who adorneth
> his temple with its raiment, and is honoured by this
> greatest of distinctions. — ‘Abdu’l-Bahá [CC2 333]

Give faithful service

> ... for our attention is directed toward the heavenly
> Kingdom unto which we must render faithful service. —
> ‘Abdu’l-Bahá [PUP 334]

> The Guardian sends messages of consolation to you and
> all the friends in this bereavement, and he says that in
> this calamitous time all must bow down their heads and
> be acquiescent, arise in faithful service to His Cause,
> and model themselves upon that most exalted, sacred and
> resplendent presence. — Bahiyyih Khánum [BK 82]

Benefits of faithfulness to the individual/rewards for the
faithful

> Hadst thou faithfully obeyed the Decree of God, all the
> inhabitants of thy land would have followed thee, and
> would have themselves entered into the celestial
> Paradise, content with the good-pleasure of God for
> evermore. — The Báb [SWB 32]

> As to those who have faithfully observed the ordinances
> in the Bayan from the inception of its revelation until
> the Day when Him Whom God shall make manifest will
> appear, these are indeed the companions of the paradise
> of His good-pleasure who will be glorified in the
> presence of God and will dwell in the pavilions of His
> celestial Garden. — The Báb [SWB 138]

> This is the Day that God hath ordained to be a blessing
> unto the righteous, a retribution for the wicked, a
> bounty for the faithful and a fury of His wrath for the
> faithless and the froward. — Bahá’u’lláh [TB 103]

> Whoso hath searched the depths of the oceans that lie
> hid within these exalted words, and fathomed their
> import, can be said to have discovered a glimmer of the
> unspeakable glory with which this mighty, this sublime,
> and most holy Revelation hath been endowed. From the
> excellence of so great a Revelation the honour with
> which its faithful followers must needs be invested can
> be well imagined. By the righteousness of the one true
> God! The very breath of these souls is in itself richer
> than all the treasures of the earth. Happy is the man that
> hath attained thereunto, and woe betide the heedless. —
> Bahá’u’lláh [GWB 10]

> Happy is the faithful one who is attired with the vesture
> of high endeavour and hath arisen to serve this Cause.

Such a soul hath truly attained the desired Goal and hath

> apprehended the Object for which it hath been created.

— Bahá’u’lláh [TB 257]

> ... after departing from this world the faithful ones will
> enter into paradises which have no likeness, and enjoy
> winning graces which are beyond comprehension: verily
> those paradises are the fruits of their deeds which they
> have accomplished in this world. — Bahá’u’lláh [BS 202]

> Know thou, moreover, that those who faithfully serve
> the All-Merciful will be enriched by Him out of His
> heavenly treasury... — ‘Abdu’l-Bahá [CC2 513]

Entrance into the Kingdom/The life of the soul after
the body’s death

> ... O immortal phoenix! dwell not save on the mount of
> faithfulness. Therein is thy habitation, if on the wings of
> thy soul thou soarest to the realm of the infinite and
> seekest to attain thy goal. — Bahá’u’lláh [HW Persian #1]

> Know, verily, that the soul is a sign of God, a heavenly
> gem whose reality the most learned of men hath failed to
> grasp, and whose mystery no mind, however acute, can
> ever hope to unravel. It is the first among all created
> things to declare the excellence of its Creator, the first
> to recognize His glory, to cleave to His truth, and to
> bow down in adoration before Him. If it be faithful to
> God, it will reflect His light, and will, eventually, return
> unto Him. — Bahá’u’lláh [GWB 158-159]

> Thou hast, moreover, asked Me concerning the state of
> the soul after its separation from the body. Know thou,
> of a truth, that if the soul of man hath walked in the
> ways of God, it will, assuredly, return and be gathered to
> the glory of the Beloved. By the righteousness of God! It
> shall attain a station such as no pen can depict, or

> tongue describe. The soul that hath remained faithful to
> the Cause of God, and stood unwaveringly firm in His
> Path shall, after his ascension, be possessed of such
> power that all the worlds which the Almighty hath
> created can benefit through him. Such a soul provideth,
> at the bidding of the Ideal King and Divine Educator,
> the pure leaven that leaveneth the world of being, and
> furnisheth the power through which the arts and
> wonders of the world are made manifest. Consider how
> meal needeth leaven to be leavened with. Those souls
> that are the symbols of detachment are the leaven of the
> world. Meditate on this, and be of the thankful. —
> Bahá’u’lláh [GWB 161]

> Entrance into the Kingdom is through the love of God,
> through detachment, through sanctity and holiness,
> through truthfulness, purity, through steadfastness and
> faithfulness and through self-sacrifice. — ‘Abdu’l-Bahá
> [SAQ 281]

Examples of faithfulness

‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s book Memorials of the Faithful is a tribute to
a number of believers who were outstanding examples of
faithfulness, courage and spiritual strength in the face of many
challenges and difficulties. Below is an example of just one such
individual, together with another story told by ‘Abdu’l-Bahá
describing the faithfulness and selflessness of Christ’s disciples:

Faithfulness of Christ’s disciples

> The most memorable instance of spiritual consultation
> was the meeting of the disciples of Jesus Christ upon the
> mount after His ascension. They said, ‘Jesus Christ has
> been crucified, and we have no longer association and
> intercourse with Him in His physical body; therefore, we
> must be loyal and faithful to Him, we must be grateful
238                                              Lights of Irfán vol. 17

> and appreciate Him, for He has raised us from the dead,
> He made us wise, He has given us eternal life. What shall
> we do to be faithful to Him?’ And so they held council.
> One of them said, ‘We must detach ourselves from the
> chains and fetters of the world; otherwise, we cannot be
> faithful.’ The others replied, ‘That is so.’ Another said,
> ‘Either we must be married and faithful to our wives and
> children or serve our Lord free from these ties. We
> cannot be occupied with the care and provision for
> families and at the same time herald the Kingdom in the
> wilderness. Therefore, let those who are unmarried
> remain so, and those who have married provide means of
> sustenance and comfort for their families and then go
> forth to spread the message of glad tidings.’ There were
> no dissenting voices; all agreed, saying, ‘That is right.’ A
> third disciple said, ‘To perform worthy deeds in the
> Kingdom we must be further self-sacrificing. From now
> on we should forego ease and bodily comfort, accept
> every difficulty, forget self and teach the Cause of God.’
> This found acceptance and approval by all the others.
> Finally a fourth disciple said, ‘There is still another
> aspect to our faith and unity. For Jesus’ sake we shall be
> beaten, imprisoned and exiled. They may kill us. Let us
> receive this lesson now. Let us realize and resolve that
> though we are beaten, banished, cursed, spat upon and
> led forth to be killed, we shall accept all this joyfully,
> loving those who hate and wound us.’ All the disciples
> replied, ‘Surely we will—it is agreed; this is right.’ Then
> they descended from the summit of the mountain, and
> each went forth in a different direction upon his divine
> mission. — ‘Abdu’l-Bahá [PUP 74]

Zaynu’l-Ábidín Yazdí

> One of the emigrants who died along the way to the
> Holy Land was Zaynu’l-Ábidín Yazdí of Yazd. When, in
> Manshád, this devoted man first heard the cry of God,

> he was awakened to restless life. A holy passion stirred
> him, his soul was made new. The light of guidance
> flamed from the lamp of his heart; the love of God
> sparked a revolution in the country of his inner self.
> Carried away by love for the Loved One’s beauty, he left
> the home that was dear to him and set out for the
> Desired Land.

> As he travelled along with his two sons, gladdened by
> hopes of the meeting that would be his, he paused on
> every hilltop, in every plain, village and hamlet to visit
> with the friends. But the great distance stretching out
> before him changed to a sea of troubles, and although
> his spirit yearned, his body weakened, and at the end he
> sickened and turned helpless; all this when he was
> without a home.

> Sick as he was, he did not renounce the journey, nor fail
> in his resolve; he had amazing strength of will, and was
> determined to keep on; but the illness worsened with
> every passing day, until at last he winged his way to the
> mercy of God, and yielded up his soul in a longing

> Although to outward eyes he never drained the cup of

> still he achieved the very spirit of spiritual communion;

> eyes with beholding the lights of that mysterious Realm.

— ‘Abdu’l-Bahá [MF 83-84]

Being a Faithful Person

The Bahá’í texts also describe what a faithful person is like
and how one can become faithful. These texts could apply to
the generality of humankind, not just to those who have already
recognized Bahá’u’lláh and are trying to follow His teachings.
These quotations seem to guide such people towards recognition
of the Manifestation of God by building on their faithfulness to
God:

> Since thou hast faithfully obeyed the true religion of
> God in the past, it behoveth thee to follow His true
> religion hereafter, inasmuch as every religion proceedeth
> from God, the Help in Peril, the Self-Subsisting. — The
> Báb [SWB 138]

Who are the faithful?

> ... the faithful, they that have believed in God and in His
> signs, whose hearts witness to His unity, whose tongues
> proclaim His oneness, and who speak not except by His
> leave. — Bahá’u’lláh [SLH 231]

The requirements of faithfulness

> Our requirements of faithfulness is that thou mayest
> sacrifice thyself and, in the divine path, close thine eye
> to every pleasure and strive with all thy soul that thou
> mayest disappear and be lost, like unto a drop, in the
> ocean of the love of God. — ‘Abdu’l-Bahá [TAB3 552]

Developing the spiritual quality of faithfulness

Faithfulness of women

Being a faithful Bahá’í

Many of the verses concerning faithfulness found in the
writings of Bahá’u’lláh and in the letters and talks of ‘Abdu’l-
Bahá are directed towards those who have already recognized—
or are about to recognize—the Manifestation of God and are
striving to be more faithful to His teachings. The guidance
found in these passages explains who is considered to be
faithful; what faithfulness is; the characteristics of a faithful
Bahá’í; the attitudes, qualities, virtues, behaviours and actions
that the faithful are to acquire and those they are to avoid or
overcome. They outline the requisites for spiritual growth, the
need for loyalty to the Cause and steadfastness in the Covenant,
the trials and sacrifices that the faithful are to endure. Several
of the examples below are taken from Tablets of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá
written to individual believers in the West, often in response to
their letters to Him. Many convey very detailed guidance about
how Bahá’ís should conduct themselves, provided to those who
were new to the Faith and were learning attitudes and
behaviours that were sometimes very different from those they
held before becoming Bahá’ís. It is noticeable that ‘Abdu’l-
Bahá’s Tablets mention a large number of spiritual qualities in
addition to faithfulness.

Who are the faithful?

> Indeed those whose souls have been created through the
> splendour of the light of thy Lord recognize the Truth
> and are numbered with such as faithfully obey the One
> True God and are well assured... — The Báb [SWB 24]

> ... the favoured among the faithful, [are] they that truly
> uphold the unity of God and are wholly devoted to His
> Cause. — Bahá’u’lláh [GWB 344]

Use of the terms, ‘the faithful’, ‘faithful followers’, ‘faithful
workers’, ‘faithful servants’, ‘faithful lovers’, ‘faithful friends’,
etc. to mean ‘believers’ or followers of Bahá’u’lláh

> To live the teachings of the Cause should be the
> paramount concern of every true believer, and the only
> way to do so is to commune both in spirit and through
> actual concrete means with the entire community of the
> faithful. — From a letter written on behalf of Shoghi
> Effendi to an individual, 13 August 1936 [LG 475]

> From the excellence of so great a Revelation the honour
> with which its faithful followers must needs be invested
> can be well imagined. By the righteousness of the one
> true God! The very breath of these souls is in itself richer
> than all the treasures of the earth. Happy is the man that
> hath attained thereunto, and woe betide the heedless. —
> Bahá’u’lláh [GWB 10]

> ... it devolves upon the faithful workers in India to
> follow up the work, to seize every opportunity and to
> give to her hasty and in many places insufficient services
> a more permanent and lasting character. — Shoghi
> Effendi [DND 17]

> If His faithful servants could realize how meritorious
> are benevolent deeds in these days, they would all arise
> to do that which is meet and seemly. — Bahá’u’lláh [CC1

488]

> I appeal in particular to those faithful lovers of His
> Cause in that vast and distant dominion. — Shoghi
> Effendi [DND 1]

> It is a great pleasure and privilege to me to enter into
> direct, and I trust, permanent correspondence with those
> faithful friends of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, who though few in
> number and scattered over that vast and flourishing

> of that spiritually-minded people. — ‘Abdu’l-Bahá [MC 3]

Faithfulness as one of a cluster of spiritual qualities
of the believer

> Cleave ye at all times to the cord of trustworthiness and
> hold fast the hem of the garment of truthfulness: thus
> biddeth you He Who is the Truthful, the Trusted One.
> God is my witness, trustworthiness is a light that shineth
> refulgently from the heavens, and leadeth to the
> exaltation of the Cause of God, the Omnipotent, the
> Incomparable, the All-Praised. Whoso hath remained
> faithful to the Covenant hath been steadfast in his
> adherence to trustworthiness, whilst those who have
> repudiated it have erred grievously. — Bahá’u’lláh [CC2

334]

> We call to remembrance every one of the friends and
> exhort them to have regard to trustworthiness, which is a
> charge that God hath entrusted to the safe-keeping of
> His servants; to righteousness, which He hath made to be
> a citadel of strength for His well-favoured ones and
> faithful, humble servants; and to whatever virtues shall
> conduce to their dignity and honour among all peoples.

— Bahá’u’lláh [CC2 330]

> ... ye must conduct yourselves in such a manner that ye
> may stand out distinguished and brilliant as the sun
> among other souls. Should any one of you enter a city,
> he should become a centre of attraction by reason of his
> sincerity, his faithfulness and love, his honesty and
> fidelity, his truthfulness and loving-kindness towards all
> the peoples of the world, so that the people of that city
> may cry out and say: ‘This man is unquestionably a
> Bahá’í, for his manners, his behaviour, his conduct, his
> morals, his nature, and disposition reflect the attributes

> of the Bahá’ís.’ Not until ye attain this station can ye be
> said to have been faithful to the Covenant and
> Testament of God. For He hath, through irrefutable
> Texts, entered into a binding Covenant with us all,
> requiring us to act in accordance with His sacred
> instructions and counsels. — ‘Abdu’l-Bahá [SWAB 70]

Characteristics of the faithful believer

> One of the teachings is that love and faithfulness must
> so prevail in the hearts that men may see the stranger as a
> friend, the sinner as an intimate fellow, may count
> enemies as allies, regard foes as loving comrades, call
> their executioner the giver of life, consider the denier as
> a believer and the unbeliever as a faithful one—that is,
> men must behave in such a manner as may befit the
> believers, the faithful, the friend and the confidant. —
> ‘Abdu’l-Bahá [BWF 413]

> I desire distinction for you. The Bahá’ís must be
> distinguished from others of humanity. But this
> distinction must not depend upon wealth—that they
> should become more affluent than other people. I do not
> desire for you financial distinction. It is not an ordinary
> distinction I desire; not scientific, commercial, industrial
> distinction. For you I desire spiritual distinction—that is,
> you must become eminent and distinguished in morals.
> In the love of God you must become distinguished from
> all else. You must become distinguished for loving
> humanity, for unity and accord, for love and justice.

> In brief, you must become distinguished in all the virtues
> of the human world—for faithfulness and sincerity, for
> justice and fidelity, for firmness and steadfastness, for
> philanthropic deeds and service to the human world, for
> love toward every human being, for unity and accord
> with all people, for removing prejudices and promoting

> international peace. Finally, you must become
> distinguished for heavenly illumination and for acquiring
> the bestowals of God. I desire this distinction for you.
> This must be the point of distinction among you. —
> ‘Abdu’l-Bahá [PUP 190]

Faithfulness of women believers

Many of the western believers who corresponded with
‘Abdu’l-Bahá were women. The two excerpts from His Tablets
below are a very small example of how He encouraged women
to develop their spiritual capacities and strength.

> Convey thou unto the handmaids of the Merciful the
> message that when a test turneth violent they must stand
> unmoved, and faithful to their love for Bahá. In winter
> come the storms, and the great winds blow, but then will
> follow spring in all its beauty, adorning hill and plain
> with perfumed plants and red anemones, fair to see.
> Then will the birds trill out upon the branches their
> songs of joy, and sermonize in lilting tones from the
> pulpits of the trees. Erelong shall ye bear witness that
> the lights are streaming forth, the banners of the realm
> above are waving, the sweet scents of the All-Merciful
> are wafted abroad, the hosts of the Kingdom are
> marching down, the angels of heaven are rushing
> forward, and the Holy Spirit is breathing upon all those
> regions. — ‘Abdu’l-Bahá [SWAB 163-164]

> Be thou a light to every darkness, a dispeller of every
> sadness, a healer for every sick person, a quencher for
> every thirst, a shelter for every refugee, a refuge for
> every captive. If the Pharisees interfere with thee, it is
> incumbent upon thee to implore God to guide them to
> the road of salvation! And it is incumbent upon thee to
> be affable to them under all circumstances, to be patient
> in afflictions, to be courteous with the enemies and to

> pray for the hateful sinners! This is the nature of the
> faithful and convinced women believers whose hearts are
> dilated with the fragrances of God and who instruct
> people in the teachings of God! — ‘Abdu’l-Bahá [TAB2

285]

> Through the insults and indignities suffered by the well-
> assured and faithful maidservants of God, portals of
> everlasting honour will be flung open before the face of
> the women in Persia, nay everywhere in the world... —
> Shoghi Effendi [FL 33]

How to recognise the faithful servant

> The bounties of God are: to love each other, to speak the
> truth, to sever our hearts from the world, to be reverent,
> to be humble, to be hospitable. By these things you
> know the faithful servant of God. How do we know the
> light? By its rays. So when you see these qualities, you
> will know that the servant of God has received the
> regeneration. — ‘Abdu’l-Bahá [BS 501]

How to become faithful/how to develop faithfulness

> O banished and faithful friend! Quench the thirst of
> heedlessness with the sanctified waters of My grace, and
> chase the gloom of remoteness through the morning-
> light of My Divine presence. Suffer not the habitation
> wherein dwelleth My undying love for thee to be
> destroyed through the tyranny of covetous desires, and
> overcloud not the beauty of the heavenly Youth with the
> dust of self and passion.

> Clothe thyself with the essence of righteousness, and let
> thine heart be afraid of none except God. Obstruct not
> the luminous spring of thy soul with the thorns and
> brambles of vain and inordinate affections, and impede
248                                               Lights of Irfán vol. 17

> not the flow of the living waters that stream from the
> fountain of thine heart. Set all thy hope in God, and
> cleave tenaciously to His unfailing mercy. Who else but
> Him can enrich the destitute, and deliver the fallen from
> his abasement? — Bahá’u’lláh [GWB 323]

> It behoveth the loved ones of the Lord to be the signs
> and tokens of His universal mercy and the embodiments
> of His own excelling grace. Like the sun, let them cast
> their rays upon garden and rubbish heap alike, and even
> as clouds in spring, let them shed down their rain upon
> flower and thorn. Let them seek but love and
> faithfulness, let them not follow the ways of unkindness,
> let their talk be confined to the secrets of friendship and
> of peace. Such are the attributes of the righteous, such is
> the distinguishing mark of those who serve His
> Threshold. — ‘Abdu’l-Bahá [SWAB 257]

> But we, and the friends of God, should on no account
> slacken our efforts to be loyal, sincere and men of good
> will. We should at all times manifest our truthfulness
> and sincerity, nay rather, we must be constant in our
> faithfulness and trustworthiness, and occupy ourselves
> in offering prayers for the good of all.

> O ye beloved of God, these are days for steadfastness,
> for firmness and perseverance in the Cause of God. —
> ‘Abdu’l-Bahá [SWAB 294]

Divine verses evoke love in the faithful

> ... the divinely-revealed verses shine as the sun, whilst all
> others are as stars. To the peoples of the world they are
> the abiding testimony, the incontrovertible proof, the
> shining light of the ideal King. Their excellence is
> unrivalled, their virtue nothing can surpass. They are the
> treasury of the divine pearls and the depository of the

> divine mysteries. They constitute the indissoluble Bond,
> the firm Cord, the Urvatu’l-Vuthqá, the inextinguishable
> Light. Through them floweth the river of divine
> knowledge, and gloweth the fire of His ancient and
> consummate wisdom. This is the fire which, in one and
> the same moment, kindleth the flame of love in the
> breasts of the faithful, and induceth the chill of
> heedlessness in the heart of the enemy. — Bahá’u’lláh [KI

Prayers for faithfulness

Many of the prayers revealed by Bahá’u’lláh and ‘Abdu’l-
Bahá beseech God to assist the believers to remain faithful to
the Covenant and to God and to help them remain strong and
committed believers during times of tests and trials.

> Entreat thou the one true God to enable His faithful
> servants to fulfil that which is conducive to the good of
> this world and the world to come. This is the
> commandment of God that hath been prescribed in His
> weighty and inviolable Book. — Bahá’u’lláh [CC1 489]

> O God, my God! I beg of Thee by the dawning of the
> light of Thy Beauty that hath illumined all the earth, and
> by the glance of Thy divine compassion’s eye that
> considereth all things, and by the surging sea of Thy
> bestowals in which all things are immersed, and by Thy
> streaming clouds of bounty raining down gifts upon the
> essences of all created things, and by the splendours of
> Thy mercy that existed before ever the world was—to
> help Thy chosen ones to be faithful, and assist Thy loved
> ones to serve at Thine exalted Threshold, and cause them
> to gain the victory through the battalions of Thy might
> that overpowereth all things, and reinforce them with a
> great fighting host from out of the Concourse on high.

— ‘Abdu’l-Bahá [SWAB 5]

> O my Lord and my Hope! Help Thou Thy loved ones to
> be steadfast in Thy mighty Covenant, to remain faithful
> to Thy manifest Cause, and to carry out the

> Book of Splendours; that they may become banners of
> guidance and lamps of the Company above, wellsprings
> of Thine infinite wisdom, and stars that lead aright, as
> they shine down from the supernal sky. — ‘Abdu’l-Bahá
> [SWAB 259]

Faithfulness necessary for spiritual growth

Bahá’u’lláh has stated quite clearly in His Writings the
essential requisites for our spiritual growth, and these are
stressed again and again by ‘Abdu’l-Bahá in His Talks and
Tablets. One can summarise them briefly in this way:
1. The recital each day of one of the Obligatory Prayers with

pure-hearted devotion.
2. The regular reading of the Sacred Scriptures, specifically at

> least each morning and evening, with reverence, attention
> and thought.
3. Prayerful meditation on the teachings, so that we may

> understand them more deeply, fulfil them more faithfully,
> and convey them more accurately to others.
4. Striving every day to bring our behaviour more into

> accordance with the high standard that are set forth in the
> Teachings.

> 5. Teaching the Cause of God.
6.   Selfless service in the work of the Cause and in the

> carrying on of our trade or profession. [From a letter written
> on behalf of the Universal House of Justice to a National Spiritual
> Assembly, 1 September 1983]

Acting faithfully

> O ye beloved of the Lord! Commit not that which
> defileth the limpid stream of love or destroyeth the
> sweet fragrance of friendship. By the righteousness of
> the Lord! Ye were created to show love one to another
> and not perversity and rancour. Take pride not in love
> for yourselves but in love for your fellow-creatures.
> Glory not in love for your country, but in love for all
> mankind. Let your eye be chaste, your hand faithful,
> your tongue truthful and your heart enlightened. Abase
> not the station of the learned in Bahá and belittle not the
> rank of such rulers as administer justice amidst you. Set
> your reliance on the army of justice, put on the armour
> of wisdom, let your adorning be forgiveness and mercy
> and that which cheereth the hearts of the well-favoured
> of God. — Bahá’u’lláh [TB 138-139]

Faithfulness, trials, tests and sacrifice

> Trials for the faithful believers are like unto divine
> bestowal and everlasting gifts. — ‘Abdu’l-Bahá [TAB2 277]

> In the estimation of the loved ones of God abasement is
> exaltation itself, and affliction leadeth to faithfulness. —
> ‘Abdu’l-Bahá [FL 29-30]

> Neither the world-wide growth of the Bahá’í community
> nor the process of learning it was experiencing... tell the
> whole story of these tumultuous and creative decades.
> When the history of the period is eventually written, one
> of its most brilliant chapters will recount the spiritual
> victories won by Bahá’í communities, in Africa
> particularly, who survived war, terror, political
> oppression and extreme privations, and who emerged
> from these tests with their faith intact, determined to
> resume the interrupted work of building a viable Bahá’í

> collective life. The community in Ethiopia, homeland of
> one of the world’s oldest and richest cultural traditions,
> succeeded in maintaining both the morale of its members
> and the coherence of its administrative structures under
> relentless pressure from a brutal dictatorship. Of the
> friends in other countries on the continent, it may be
> truly said that their path of faithfulness to the Cause led
> through a hell of suffering seldom equalled in modern
> history. The annals of the Faith possess few more
> moving testimonies to the sheer power of the spirit than
> the stories of courage and purity of heart emerging from
> the inferno that engulfed the friends in what was then
> Zaire, stories that will inspire generations to come and
> represent priceless contributions to the creation of a

> Rwanda added unforgettable achievements of their own

Be faithful to the Cause/Bahá’u’lláh

> Whatsoever is thy desire is found in the Cause of
> Bahá’u’lláh. If thou art asking confirmation and
> assistance, be thou faithful, firm and steadfast. —
> ‘Abdu’l-Bahá [TAB2 246]

> Bahá’u’lláh endured the greatest hardships. He found
> neither rest by night nor peace by day. He was
> constantly under the stress of great calamity—now in
> prison, now in chains, now threatened by the sword—
> until finally He broke the cage of captivity, left this
> mortal world and ascended to the heaven of God. He
> endured all these tribulations for our sakes and suffered
> these deprivations that we might attain the bestowals of
> divine bounty. Therefore, we must be faithful to Him
> and turn away from our own selfish desires and fancies

> in order that we may accomplish that which is required
> of us by our Lord. — ‘Abdu’l-Bahá [PUP 461]

> For such benefits, for such an arresting and majestic
> vindication of the undefeatable powers inherent in our
> precious Faith, we can but bow our heads in humility,
> awe and thanksgiving, renew our pledge of fealty to it,
> and, each covenanting in his own heart, resolve to prove
> faithful to that pledge, and persevere to the very end,
> until our earthly share of servitude to so transcendent
> and priceless a Cause has been totally and completely
> fulfilled. — Shoghi Effendi [MA 104]

Strive to be faithful

> But we, and the friends of God, should on no account
> slacken our efforts to be loyal, sincere and men of good
> will. We should at all times manifest our truthfulness
> and sincerity, nay rather, we must be constant in our

> O ye beloved of God, these are days for steadfastness,
> for firmness and perseverance in the Cause of God. —
> ‘Abdu’l-Bahá [SWAB 294]

> O saints of God! at the end of Our discourse We enjoin
> on you once again chastity, faithfulness, godliness,
> sincerity, and purity. Lay aside the evil and adopt the
> good. This is that whereunto ye are commanded in the
> Book of God, the Knowing, the Wise. Well is it with
> those who practice [this injunction]. At this moment the
> pen crieth out, saying, ‘O saints of God, regard the
> horizon of uprightness, and be quit, severed, and free
> from what is beside this. There is no strength and no

> Oh, friends of God! If ye will trust in the Word of God
> and be strong; if ye will follow the precepts of
> Bahá’u’lláh to tend the sick, raise the fallen, care for the
> poor and needy, give shelter to the destitute, protect the

> humanity with all your hearts, then I say unto you that
> ere long this meeting-place will see a wonderful harvest.
> Day by day each member will advance and become more
> and more spiritual. But ye must have a firm foundation
> and your aims and ambitions must be clearly understood
> by each member. They shall be as follows:

> 1. To show compassion and goodwill to all mankind.
> 2. To render service to humanity.
3. To endeavour to guide and enlighten those in

darkness.
4. To be kind to everyone, and show forth affection

to every living soul.
5. To be humble in your attitude towards God, to be

> constant in prayer to Him, so as to grow daily
> nearer to God.
6. To be so faithful and sincere in all your actions

> that every member may be known as embodying
> the qualities of honesty, love, faith, kindness,
> generosity, and courage.
7. To be detached from all that is not God, attracted

> by the Heavenly Breath—a divine soul; so that the
> world may know that a Bahá’í is a perfect being.

> Strive to attain this at these meetings. Then, indeed and
> in truth will ye, the friends of God, come together with
> great joy! Render help one to the other, become as one

> man, having reached perfect unity. — ‘Abdu’l-Bahá      [PT

> A word or two from Shoghi Effendi [at the

Deeds of the faithful Bahá’í

> Be ye not seated and silent! Diffuse the glad-tidings of

> just as you show forth to your relations. If a soul is
> seeking to quarrel, ask ye for reconciliation; if he blame
> you, praise him; if he give you a deadly poison, bestow
> ye an all-healing antidote; if he createth death,
> administer ye eternal life; if he becometh a thorn, change

> unity upon the apex of the world.

> These are the results of the divine advices and
> exhortations, and the epitome of the teachings of the
> Bahá’í Cycle. — ‘Abdu’l-Bahá [BWF 353]

Duties of the faithful Bahá’í

> The duty of the concourse of the faithful in this day
> should be but one duty, their purpose but one purpose,
> their aim but one aim, and the object of their endeavour
> but one object, and this is none other than to foster the
> spirit of unity and harmony, to serve and teach His
> Cause and to promote His Word. Such is the meaning of
> true faithfulness; and in this lies the good-pleasure of
> ‘Abdu’l-Bahá. — Bahiyyih Khánum [BK 174]

Faithfulness in relationships with others

The faithful are to treat others with joy

> They that are endued with sincerity and faithfulness
> should associate with all the peoples and kindreds of the
> earth with joy and radiance, inasmuch as consorting with
> people hath promoted and will continue to promote

> unity and concord, which in turn are conducive to the
> maintenance of order in the world and to the
> regeneration of nations. — Bahá’u’lláh [TB 36]

Treat people with faithfulness

> Wherefore, O my loving friends! Consort with all the
> peoples, kindreds and religions of the world with the
> utmost      truthfulness,    uprightness,    faithfulness,
> kindliness, good-will and friendliness, that all the world
> of being may be filled with the holy ecstasy of the grace
> of Bahá, that ignorance, enmity, hate and rancour may
> vanish from the world and the darkness of estrangement
> amidst the peoples and kindreds of the world may give
> way to the Light of Unity. Should other peoples and
> nations be unfaithful to you show your fidelity unto
> them, should they be unjust toward you show justice
> towards them, should they keep aloof from you attract
> them to yourselves, should they show their enmity be
> friendly towards them, should they poison your lives,
> sweeten their souls, should they inflict a wound upon
> you, be a salve to their sores. Such are the attributes of
> the sincere! Such are the attributes of the truthful. —
> ‘Abdu’l-Bahá [WT 14]

> As to thee, O maid-servant of God! Blessed art thou, for
> thou hast dealt with people in goodness and good
> favour. Do not seek from them any reward whatever,
> but seek all grace and beneficence from thy Lord, and

The faithless/unfaithful

Today the world is experiencing a frightening and horrible
example of the way in which one group of so-called religious
fundamentalists is violently enforcing its understanding of how
to treat those they consider to be ‘faithless’ and ‘infidels’ by
torturing and killing them. This is not the place to discuss
whether they are right in their understanding of who the
‘infidels’ are or their misguided actions but their beliefs have in
any case been overtaken by the teachings of the Manifestation
of God for this day, Bahá’u’lláh. For not only have Bahá’u’lláh’s
teachings abolished concepts such as jihad, in the dispensation
of Bahá’u’lláh the religious division of peoples into those who
are faithful and those who are infidels has been abolished. This
does not mean, however, that there is no distinction between
them or that they have the same spiritual status. From the

268                                           Lights of Irfán vol. 17

writings it seems that whereas in the past those who were not
faithful to the religion were considered to be cut off from the
bestowals and love of God, in this day they are, like everyone,
recipients of His grace and bounty. As Bahá’u’lláh explains, it is
not God who fails to love an individual but the individual who
fails to love God that creates the appearance that God is not
showering His love on that person:

> O Son of Being! Love Me, that I may love thee. If thou
> lovest Me not, My love can in no wise reach thee. Know
> this, O servant. — Bahá’u’lláh [HW Arabic #5]

The attitude other have about such individuals is also to be
different in this day. They are not evil but ‘asleep’, ‘ailing’ or
‘immature’ and should be ‘awakened’, ‘healed’ or ‘trained’,
treated with kindness and love. Only in extreme cases, now
determined by the Universal House of Justice after long
investigation and attempts to rehabilitate the individual, will a
person be declared a Covenant-breaker, association with whom
by Bahá’ís is forbidden for their own spiritual health. And even
they are still able to receive the bounties of God.

> hath repaired from the emerald height of fidelity unto
> the Sadratu’l-Muntahá, and wept with such a weeping

> that the Concourse on high and the dwellers of the

Division of humankind into the ‘faithful’ and the
‘infidels’, is abolished

> A fundamental teaching of Bahá’u’lláh is the oneness of
> the world of humanity. Addressing mankind, He says,
> ‘Ye are all leaves of one tree and the fruits of one
> branch.’ By this it is meant that the world of humanity is
> like a tree, the nations or peoples are the different limbs
> or branches of that tree, and the individual human
> creatures are as the fruits and blossoms thereof. In this
> way Bahá’u’lláh expressed the oneness of humankind,
> whereas in all religious teachings of the past the human
> world has been represented as divided into two parts:
> one known as the people of the Book of God, or the
> pure tree, and the other the people of infidelity and
> error, or the evil tree. The former were considered as
> belonging to the faithful, and the others to the hosts of
> the irreligious and infidel—one part of humanity the
> recipients of divine mercy, and the other the object of
> the wrath of their Creator. Bahá’u’lláh removed this by
> proclaiming the oneness of the world of humanity, and
> this principle is specialized in His teachings, for He has
> submerged all mankind in the sea of divine generosity.
> Some are asleep; they need to be awakened. Some are
> ailing; they need to be healed. Some are immature as

The Faithful Spirit

In the Bahá’í writings the ‘Faithful Spirit’ is generally
understood to be Gabriel3, who appears to be a spiritual entity
beyond the understanding of humans. The Faithful Spirit is
mentioned at number of times in the texts:

> We have revealed Ourself unto men, have unveiled the
> Cause, guided all mankind towards God’s Straight Path,
> promulgated the laws and have enjoined upon everyone
> that which shall truly profit them both in this world and
> in the next; yet they have pronounced judgement to shed
> My blood, whereat the Maid of Heaven hath wept sore,
> Sinai hath lamented and the Faithful Spirit was made to
> sigh with grief. — Bahá’u’lláh [TB 251]

> They ascribed unto Him what caused the Spirit Jesus to
> lament in His Most Sublime Station, and the Faithful
> Spirit to cry out. — Bahá’u’lláh [PB 78]

> They that have forsaken their country for the purpose of
> teaching Our Cause—these shall the Faithful Spirit
> strengthen through its power. A company of Our chosen
> angels shall go forth with them, as bidden by Him Who
> is the Almighty, the All-Wise. —Bahá’u’lláh [GWB 334]

Conclusion

The concept of faithfulness appears throughout the English-
language Bahá’í writings in different contexts and is applied to
a number of situations and people. The writings provide
definitions for the sort of people and actions that are ‘faithful’,
for example ‘they that have believed in God and in His signs,
whose hearts witness to His unity, whose tongues proclaim His
oneness, and who speak not except by His leave’ [SLH 231] and
those who are ‘unfaithful’, including those who ‘do their utmost
to shake the foundations of the Cause’ [SWAB 315]. As a spiritual
quality that can be demonstrated in the individual’s attitude,
behaviour and relationships with the Bahá’í Faith and its
institutions as well as with other people, it presents an
opportunity for deepening, reflection, meditation and practice.

As this is but a preliminary sampling of some of the Bahá’í
writings, there is very little analysis possible at this stage but the
subject is worthy of much deeper study.
