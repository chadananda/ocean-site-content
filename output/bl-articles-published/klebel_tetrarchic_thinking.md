> **Abstract:** This presentation tries to follow ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s statement that we have to follow Bahá’u’lláh’s new principles and forget the old patterns of thought in order to find the peace of the heavenly kingdom, not only in the world, but primarily and foremost in our hearts:
> 
> > “Now the new age is here and creation is reborn. Humanity hath taken on new life. ... The people, therefore, must be set completely free from their old patterns of thought, that all their attention may be focused upon these new principles, for these are the light of this time and the very spirit of this age.
> > 
> > Unless these Teachings are effectively spread among the people, until the old ways, the old concepts, are gone and forgotten, this world of being will find no peace, nor will it reflect the perfections of the Heavenly Kingdom.” (SWA 253).
> 
> Bahá'u'lláh's Writings have frequent references to four-fold relationships such as "Firstness and Lastness – Inwardness and outwardness" (SVFV 27); "Motion and Stillness – Will and Purpose" (GWB 164) and several others in the Writings. This presentation will show how these fourfold principles, we call "tetrarchies," are a new way of thinking about humankind and the entire universe. It is significant that all these statements originated during the Baghdad and Edirne period of Bahá'u'lláh’s translated Writings, which means that they are to be understood in a mystical context.
> 
> The word “Tetrarchy” is not mentioned, as such, in any enumeration of Bahá'u'lláh’s principles, yet, it is this writer’s opinion that this idea presents a new way of thinking. This concept describes a new pattern of thought, a new basic hermeneutical and ontological principle permeating the Revelation of Bahá'u'lláh.
> 
> The new idea presented in this paper is the tetrarchic understanding of reality, which this writer has developed and presented in all of his previous Irfan and ABS presentations beginning with the paper on “True of Thyself”, (Lights of Irfan, Book Six, 2005) mentioning the four states of man from the Seven Valleys (page 27). To describe these four states with the word tetrarchy has been introduced two years ago and used in the paper “The Essence of Man”, which is now in print, in the last copy of Lights of Irfan. Since then, the study of the Writings has resulted in new insights and new philosophic sources have been found to further develop the concept of tetrarchy. Besides Wilber’s (born 1949) Quadrants, Romano Guardini’s (1885 – 1968) “Gegensatz” (translated as Polarity or Oppositeness) and its development in the Integral Philosophy of Augustinus Wucherer (born 1929) has given a newer and deeper understanding of the tetrarchic structure of reality; promoting a new understanding of concrete reality, in contrast to the understanding of reality in abstract concepts.
> 
> These two ways of understanding, abstract and personal, are similar to Ferdinand Ebner’s (1882 – 1931) distinction between Personal and Substantial Understanding, as presented in the paper “The Word is the Master Key of the Whole World” (_Lights of Irfan_ Book Eight, 2007).
> 
> Another rather new aspect of this understanding is the epistemological question of how we understand, which was presented by Romano Guardini in three different ways of understanding: the rational (Logical, Abstract), the trans-rational (Personal, called Intuition) and the super-rational understanding (called Vision or “Anschauung”). These three ways of understanding surprisingly correspond with Bahá'u'lláh’s three differing planes of understanding the wayfarer moves in the Seven Valleys (page 20):
> 
> > “Thus, for that they move on these three differing planes, the understanding and the words of the wayfarers have differed; and hence the sign of conflict doth continually appear on earth. For some there are who dwell upon the plane of oneness and speak of that world, and some inhabit the realms of limitation, and some the grades of self, while others are completely veiled.” (SVFV 20)
> 
> Here the rational abstract understanding is referred to under the term limitation, the intuitive way of understanding is referred to under the terms of grades of self and the vision is described as the plane of oneness, while Bahá'u'lláh adds the ones who are completely veiled, calling them ignorant. Bahá'u'lláh further indicates that this differences of understanding create the conflicts of this world; ‘Abdu’l-Bahá has interpreted this idea, stating that accepting Bahá'u'lláh’s principles will bring peace to the world.
> 
> It is postulated by this writer, that these developments of philosophy and new thinking are based on the Revelation of Bahá'u'lláh, in spite of the fact that all the thinkers, quoted here, had no knowledge of the Bahá’í Faith. As presented before (Lawh-i-Hikmat, _Lights of Irfan_ Book Seven, 2006), Bahá’í theology is understood as being progressive, always starting with the Writings, but finding in the Writings new patterns of thought and ways of thinking, which often enough have been found as well by other thinkers, who do not necessarily know of the Bahá’í Faith.
> 
> This idea was recently expressed by the Universal House of Justice (in _One Common Faith_ 2005, p. iii):
> 
> > “Bahá’ís will come to increasingly appreciate that the Cause they serve represents the arrowhead of an awakening taking place among people everywhere, regardless of religious background and indeed among many with no religious leaning.”
> 
> Concluding, it has to be indicated that this presentation is the outline of the forthcoming book of this writer, to appear hopefully in the year 2013 under the same title: “Understanding Reality.”

“These Four States Conferred Upon Thee”1
Tetrarchic Thinking in Philosophy, Theology,

and Psychology

Wolfgang Klebel

Introduction

In this paper the attempt is made to understand reality in a
new way, a way that is forward thinking and following the
evolution of the human ability to understand, to reason.
Consequently, the evolution of human thinking will be part of
the investigation of this study, and it will start with new ideas in
philosophy, will then transcend them by including theological
statements and will finally apply findings of this process to
studies in psychology. It is not accidental that the writer had
first a complete philosophical and theological education and
then became clinical psychologists, which today is still his
professional practice.

How real is reality, is the first question studied here.2 If
reality is real, how can we understand reality, is the other
question. Several things seem to be clear. Humankind was
always trying to find an answer to these questions, and the
answer changed from century to century, from epoch to epoch.
What is intended here is not to find a final answer, but to find
an answer that is valid today, or, to attempt such an answer and
to get a step further in this quest for a solution. It is clear, on
the other hand, that there will never be a final answer. The
question remains unanswered in some sense, no matter how
often an answer is found, how often the search has started
again. Considering this, any answer to this final question about
reality is temporary and transient, yet, the search is necessary

126                                    Lights of ‘Irfán Book Fourteen

and all the answers found are of highest importance for human
self-understanding and for the understanding of reality.

Anticipating the second theological part of this paper, it can
be stated that it is a theological contention, as presented in the
Bahá’í principal of progressive revelation, that every new
revelation to mankind has fundamentally changed the
understanding of reality, as it is predicted in the Bible in the
book of Revelation that a new heaven and a news earth will
appear with the return of Christ. This was interpreted in the
Bahá’í Writings as the new heaven standing for the new
revelation and the new earth being the new understanding of
this revelation, establishing a new understanding of reality.

The next thing to consider is where such an answer can be
found. Looking at the history of investigating this question,
which could be called the history of ontology, it is established
that answers come from different searches, from different fields
of exploration. Philosophy comes first to mind; it is the
discipline where ontology is usually studied. Next might be
physics, considering the outside world of man; followed by
psychology, exploring the inside world of humanity, and this
includes epistemology since man is the one who understands.
The answers given by the religions of the world is found in their
theology, which seems to be the answer that reaches the farthest
into the question, because it includes God; it reaches towards an
understanding of the ultimate; no matter, how tangential, or
even how opposing this search might necessarily appear.

Another issue of this quest is the fact that answers of such
depth are never found by a single person, they usually present
themselves in the work of many, of a whole generation of
thinkers. Therefore, any answer searched for and found in this
paper will start with some thinkers, other than this writer, and
these answers are developed throughout history, mainly the
history of the last two centuries. The focus on the last two
centuries is taken, because the assumption can be made that the
development of thinking has reached a critical phase during
these centuries and might well find a conclusion, albeit a
transitory one; yet, these answers could be decisive and showing
the way into the future. What will be shown below is the fact

Tetrarchic Thinking in Philosophy                               127

that any deficient or wrong answer to these questions can, and
has had, devastating consequences for all of humankind.

Hermeneutic Circle of Understanding

This paper is presented with a concern because the terms used
in this paper have a specific meaning and could be
misunderstood if not placed in the right context. The idea of
the hermeneutic circle3 presents us with the solution to this
problem. The “Oxford Guide to Philosophy” describes the
hermeneutic circle with the following words:

> A term often used by philosophers in the (mainly
> continental) tradition running from Schleiermacher and
> Dilthey to Heidegger, Gadamer, and Ricoeur. It has to
> do with the inherent circularity of all understanding, or
> the fact that comprehension can only come about
> through a tacit foreknowledge that alerts us to salient
> features of the text which would otherwise escape
> notice.4

In this understanding the parts have to be understood from the
whole and the whole from the parts. In other words, any word,
any idea must be seen in the light of the whole presentation and
not abstracted from it, which would, often enough, lead to
misunderstandings, sometimes even to the opposite meaning as
indented by the original writer.

Explaining this circle of understanding an example might be
introduced here and it is critical for the understanding of this
paper. The term “progressive” and “progress” is such a
shimmering concept that can mean different things in different
contexts as used by different writers, especially if the meaning
expressed are based on different philosophical and sociological
assumptions. In present day politics and sociological
descriptions of every day events, the word progressive is usually
used to contrast a forward looking attitude versus a backward
looking approach to political and social actions.

Today’s Progressives claim that they present the future, yet
often enough they indicate by this adjective their move from

128                                    Lights of ‘Irfán Book Fourteen

individualism to collectivism, often enough understood as
collectivism in a Marxist or socialistic fashion, where the state
or the government is the solution to all problems, while
individual effort and achievement is seen as a misguided and
often evil intention. The historical context to this assumption is
ironic. Karl Marx, in his materialistic point of view, where
every progress is based on the economic structure of society,
stated in the Communist Manifesto that the “free development
of each is the condition for the free development of all”.5

Yet, in all countries where his ideas became the guiding
philosophy of the government the diametrical opposite
happened, the freedom of the individual was forcefully
suppressed by an overpowering state that used terror tactics to
enforce this ideology. The so-called progresses lead from
extreme liberalism and capitalism to communism, both the
extreme positions in this philosophical polarity, both causing
devastation and backwardness, lack of progress and rigid social
structures that eventually collapsed in the Soviet Union, or had
to be drastically changed in post-Mao China.

When the word progressive is used in this paper and by this
author it is used in the context of the Bahá’í Writings about
Progressive Revelation, indicating a progress to an ever higher
level of reality, or as stated by Bahá’u’lláh that All men have
been created to carry forward an ever-advancing civilization
[GWB 214]. This advancement of civilization, directs society
towards what Teilhard de Chardin called the point Omega or the
Noosphere. That most of the writings of Teilhard are consonant
with the Bahá’í Writings in this and other points was
demonstrated by this author in a previous paper in the Lights of
Irfan.6

The term progressive in this paper needs to be understood
not as going from individualism to state collectivism, as modern
“progressives” would have it, but from a development of the
polarity between the individual and the collective, in which both
poles are protected and enhanced. This will lead progressively
forwards to an ever higher and advanced society. Whenever a
concept is presented it has to be understood in the horizon of
the writer and then placed into the horizon of the reader as
Gadamer7 has explained.

Tetrarchic Understanding of Reality

Considering that answers reaching into the depth of being are
complex, are transcending simple logic or straight forward
logical thinking, the process of thinking about such answers
needs to be explored as well. With this thought, we come to the
special aspect of this study, the fact that answers presented in
this paper are called tetrarchic. This is a Greek word from
history, “tetras” meaning four and “arche” meaning beginning,
principle, prince or ruler. While the historical use of this word
was describing a single country governed by four rulers, who
were called tetrarchs,8 in this writing its meaning is drawn back
to the original meaning of the words tetras and arche, indicating
an idea or a reality that is based on four principles, or is
emerging from four beginnings. This emerging is best expressed
by the German word “Ursprung,” meaning springing or leaping
forth from the beginning, like water welling up from a spring,
or emerging from a fountain.

Reality, as it is understood here, and the understanding of
reality as well, emerges always from four principles, from four
origins or beginnings. To see this, to perceive such a process
takes a special way of understanding; it takes what we call
vision, to recognize reality in this way and a whole section will
be dedicated to this aspect of epistemology in order to clarify
how to see reality and why it is not always seen that way.

Another thought that will be developed is the fact that these
four principles are organized as two pairs of opposites, which
subsequently are combined into four unified quadrants.
Consequently, we understand that any tetrarchic unity is created
from its parts. In a reverse way it must also be said that the
whole creates the parts. The parts in the whole are assuming
different functions contributing to the whole, and are doing
that only because they are unified in the whole, therefore, it is a
unity in the diversity of its parts. This will then be explained as
the structure of reality of the cosmos, of all living beings and
first and foremost of humanity. It will, as well, best describe
the way of thinking about this very reality.

The central theme of this paper is dominated by the
consideration that the world is changing and developing, i.e., is

130                                    Lights of ‘Irfán Book Fourteen

in process of evolution and has to be seen in new ways in order
to be understood. This has to be kept in mind, so that further
changes and developments can be anticipated.

Philosophy

“Gegensatz,” or Polar Oppositeness: Romano Guardini

In this chapter, the focus is upon the philosophical issue of
the reality “as it really is” and not as it can be logically
described. There is, quite definitely, a difference of how we
think logically about reality and how reality really is.
Throughout history, as will be described later, the view of
reality has changed over time, now we are concerned about
today’s view, how do we have to understand, how do we have to
think in order to understand our world. Every historical epoch
has different paradigms to understand itself and its world;
therefore, it is important to think with new understanding
especially in a time as ours, where changes in thinking, changes
in science and technology, changes in everyday life occur almost
daily.

There are two thinkers, among many that will be focused
upon, who have changed thinking about reality, who see the
world not as a simplistic mechanistic structure, like a machine,
but look at the world from the point of view of life and
development of life, they ask the question what do we see when
we look at the world, at the human condition?

Guardini’s Gegensatz or Oppositeness of Reality

The first concept we consider is the concept of
“Oppositeness,” “Opposites” or “Polar Opposites.”9 These
words are chosen to stand for the German word “Gegensatz.”
This word means that something is set against some other thing,
it is opposed to it, at least in some ways, and it is united with
the other concept as well. It is important to see these opposites
as forming a unity; in other words, the unity experienced when
considering life forms, is always a unity that is build and formed
from opposites, these opposites are opposites because they

Tetrarchic Thinking in Philosophy                              131

form a unity and the unity is only possible as unity, because
there are opposites united, consequently neither unity nor
opposites can be conceived without each other. Guardini
expressed this when saying (translation by this writer):

> Life consists in unified opposites; in a Unity
> constructed from opposites. We experience life as
> existing and functioning in opposites and as unfolding
> in that way.… Everything has its Opposite in itself, so
> that one is in the other, or even better, one is through
> the other.10

When saying that in this polar relationship one is in the other
or through the other, it is stated that “one” cannot be thought
of without the “other”. Then the question arises of what is prior
or more valuable, the whole or the parts, the unity or the
opposite parts constituting the unity. If one is through the
other, this question is moot: both in their special ways are first
or originating the other and both are originated by the other. In
other words, the whole is constituted through the parts and the
parts are constituted as parts only if they are forming a whole.
That thought includes the consideration that the parts, now
forming a whole function different than before and the whole
by being a whole of parts is different than the mere aggregation
of parts, not forming a whole.

A simple example will explain that and it can be applied to all
reality. In the chemical molecule water, when separated, the
same atoms form gases, when combined they are a liquid at
normal temperature with totally different attributes and
function. When atoms form a molecule, they are still the same
and when the molecules falls apart, the atoms have not changed,
yet, when combined in the molecule, i.e., when these parts form
a whole they will function differently and appear differently,
have different manifestations and react differently with other
atoms and molecules. For example a water molecule contains
one oxygen and two hydrogen atoms connected by covalent
bonds. Water is a liquid at ambient conditions.

Logically, this problem cannot be solved. This was known
already by Plato, who in his Dialogue “Parmenides” let
Parmenides talk with Socrates and they are not finding a

132                                       Lights of ‘Irfán Book Fourteen

solution of the problem of the one and its parts. The questions
are asked by Parmenides; Socrates gives the laconic answers in
this dialogue.

Then the one cannot have parts, and cannot be a whole?

Why not?

> Because every part is part of a whole; is it not? Yes.
> And what is a whole?
Would not that of which no part is wanting be a whole?

Certainly.
Then, in either case, the one would be made up of parts;

both as being a
> whole, and also as having parts? To be sure.
And in either case, the one would be many, and not one?

True.
But, surely, it ought to be one and not many? It ought.

The history of philosophy since Parmenides and Plato is the
story of attempting to solve this problem between the whole
and its parts. Either the whole got priority like in Aristotle or
the parts do not form a real whole like by Democritus. Either
the world is conceived like a big machine by Newton, where the
parts are not really forming a whole or the world is understood
like a big organism, as in the romantic philosophy. The concept
of parts combining in a whole like in a machine is the ideology
that has created modern technology and science, the organic
understanding is the more humanistic and spiritual
understanding that is in conflict with the other. Issues like
religion versus atheism, Darwinism versus intelligent Design
even today exist in this conflict between the Parts and the
Whole, as anticipated by Plato.

There are many examples of polar opposites; one of the
oldest to be considered is the oppositeness of gender, of female
and male. Here it is clear that both have humanness in common,
so they are united in an essential way, yet they are opposed to
each other as well, and what is even more important, they can
only exist when the other opposed side exists as well, because

Tetrarchic Thinking in Philosophy                               133

they are designed to complement, to support and to collaborate
together, without this relationship humanity could not exist,
neither could either man or woman.

This relationship was described in this mutual dependency, as
the “Universal Man” in Hildegard von Bingen’s Liber
Divinorum Operum, in the year 1165.

> “Man and woman are in this way so involved with each
> other that one of them is the work of the other.
> Without woman, man could not be called man; without
> man, woman could not be named woman.”11

What will be found is that this kind of opposite relationship is
crucial in the understanding of reality, it pervades all of reality.
Neglecting it is creating misunderstanding and, consequently,
reality is not understood. If either the male and rarely in history
the female is taken as the only and real human, it becomes clear
that both lose, the supremacy of the male will in extreme
destroy not only the female but will also diminish the male
aspect of humanity. Modern tendencies to correct the previous
one-sided view of humanity have marked the new thinking and
understanding of the human reality.

The definition of the word opposite or oppositeness, with
which the word “Gegensatz” is translated, was presented by
Romano Guardini in his book “Der Gegensatz,” (The
Oppositeness, an attempt to a philosophy of the living-
concrete,” translation by this writer).

> This specific relationship, in which two elements
> generally exclude each other and yet are connected with
> each other, and in addition seem to presuppose each
> other, a relationship that appears in quantitative,
> qualitative and formal structures, we call oppositeness
> (“Gegensatz”).12

Several elements of this description need to be further
explained. These opposite elements generally exclude each other,
especially logically and in the way, they are usually considered
by the rational mind. Yet, they show a connection with each
other, in other words, they cannot only be looked at insofar as

they are in opposition, but need to be considered as well,
insofar as they are always somehow connected and, as is said in
the next sentence, they are not only connected but are
presupposing one another. That means that one cannot exist in
reality without the other, or in other words, one without the
other presents an extreme situation that is not functional and
destroys the unity of reality. With reality is understood the
concrete individualized reality, of the thing as it is and not the
abstract concept of things in our rational understanding.

This can easily be explained when we consider such opposites
as rest or stillness on the one hand and action and movement on
the other. These two opposites belong together like night and
day, like being awake and being asleep. One cannot be totally
resting, even in sleep we dream and one cannot be totally in
action, we need a reserve of rest and inner stillness that makes
action meaningful and productive. While they are logically
opposites, we cannot think other than by separating them, these
two concepts are inseparable in reality and always need to be
considered together, whenever we think about the reality of
both, of rest and stillness and action and movement. In life, an
overactive person loses effectiveness, and an overly resting
person will not act enough to make a difference. In extremis,
we have the inactive couch potato who does nothing and the
neurotic overactive meddler, who does too much and achieves
nothing.

In concrete reality, we need both and life is a constant
walking and living in this tension between rest and activity, we
need periods of work and vacation, we need daytime activity
and nighttime rest and sleep to be productive and effective.
Especially creativity must be based on both sides of these
opposites and the balance is crucial, even though every person
must find her own measure and equilibrium between these
opposites without falling in the extreme and destroying this
living unity.

Another word of Guardini needs consideration, when he
describes the Gegensatz (opposites):

> Both sides are always given together; one is only
> possible and conceivable with the other. This is

> oppositeness: Two moments, each one of them cannot
> be derived from the other, or transferred into the other,
> each one is unmixed in itself, nevertheless they are
> irremovable connected with each other, they cannot be
> thought of unless they are understood as existing with
> each other and through each other.13

Guardini’s crossing of opposites

Romano Guardini further talks about the oppositional
unities that are combined so that two pairs of opposites form a
crossing where two pairs of opposites are seen together in the
form of a cross forming four quadrants. He places the
opposites “Act and Structure” as well as “Form and Abundance”
in this structure. In another of these crossings of opposites, he
places Connection and Division in opposition to Similarity and
Distinction producing the following picture.

It is interesting to note that a rather similar arrangement was
used by an American thinker, Ken Wilber, of whom we will talk
later, and who most likely never read the book of Guardini as it
was not translated into English and Wilber never mentioned
Guardini in his Bibliography. While there is the possibility that
some intermediate writer transferred the idea of Guardini to
Wilber, from the description of Wilber that does not seem
apparent. Most likely, the idea was independently found. Even

more interesting is, what we will discuss in the theological part
of this paper, the same arrangement was presented in the
previous century in a mystical writing of Bahá’u’lláh.

When different writers, who are separated in different
continents and who speak different languages, and live in
different times come independently to the very similar
conclusion, we observe a phenomenon that needs to be
considered. Guardini wrote his book in 1925, Wilber wrote
about this idea at the end of the century, and the theological
description happened a century before these writers,
nevertheless, the similarity is more than a coincidence. It can be
described as something that was an idea which time had come.

In order to properly describe this arrangement and give it
meaning, the word Tetrarchy was applied to this structure by
this writer, where two pairs of two opposites are forming the
four principles of a new unity, like in a tetrarchy four rulers
rule one country. Here four principles are forming a unity,
describing a reality that cannot be otherwise described.

The obvious similarity of these thoughts should not make us
forget their differences. While Guardini’s interest is mainly in
the oppositeness of the pairs, Wilber does not stress this idea
and develops the pairs in four quadrants, attempting to describe
the developmental aspect of life and reality. Wilber sees the
connection of the pairs in the four quadrants of the crossing
and develops his understanding of reality from this aspect as
will be described below.

Before going forward and explaining the concept of
quadrants, as Wilber has formulated it, let us recapture the
important features of oppositeness as described by Guardini.

Two concepts are described as opposites, if they are logically
in opposition, but must be perceived as in reality always
presupposing each other, and being in existence through their
oppositeness, as well as, forming through their mutual
presupposition a unity, which best can be described as a unity in
diversity.

This definition cannot be logically reduced, but the tension
that is inherent in this opposition needs to be supported

rationally and will always require that these concepts have to be
considered together. Any separation or undue emphasis on one
side or the other is destroying this precarious unity on which
every living being is based. In fact, this oppositeness with its
tension and resolution in a unity in diversity needs to be
extended to all beings, from the material to the spiritual reality.
If anything is seen otherwise, the reality of it is not really
brought into the understanding mind, and only part of reality is
seen. This is not only unrealistic, but also destructive, when
used in application it will destroy the reality that it tries to deal
with.

There is a good example from politics to clarify the above
statement. In any democratic process, there are parties, and the
parties are most often in opposition. Nevertheless, the parties
on both sides are necessary and presuppose each other in order
to take care of the whole, the state. If one party takes over the
whole, especially if it eliminates the other parties from
functioning or even from existing, it will be destructive to the
whole and not represent the whole in any meaningful way.

Even after all other parties have been eliminated, as for
example in Hitler’s Germany or Lenin’s Russia, these dictatorial
governments still call themselves parties, even though, they have
assumed the governance of the whole and do not tolerate any
opposition. That such an arrangement is dysfunctional has been
proven in the last century and any party who acts as the whole is
unable to produce results that benefit the whole, it becomes
destructive and creates a dysfunctional society.

It is interesting to observe that these parties developed a
tyrannical leader, who eventually had to “purge” the party itself,
as Hitler did in the “Röhm Putsch” and Stalin did when killing
two thirds of the party’s first Central Committee. In this sense,
it has been said during the French Revolution, that the
revolution devours its own children.

The contribution of Ken Wilber: Quadrants,
Levels, Holon

The integration of the inside and outside, of the individual
and collective, of being and awareness is at the core of the
integral philosophy of Ken Wilber, whose writings will assist in
this paper’s quest to understand reality14. What is reality, we
need to ask again? How does the self relate to the internal and
external, to the individual and to the collective? To rediscover
this tradition of the self and to fortify it with modern science
and the understanding of the development of the individual and
of humanity Wilber’s has developed his integral philosophy,
which has become a new, a worldwide phenomenon as the
translation of his books into 20 languages demonstrates and
made him the most read thinker not only in USA, but popular
also in countries such as Germany and Japan?

Wilber’s Four Quadrants

Wilber organizes the structure of reality as well as of human
consciousness in four quadrants, where the left two quadrants
are depicting the inside of things and the right two sides the
outside of things [see graph on previous page]. The upper
quadrants signify the individual aspect and the lower two
quadrants the collective aspect of reality and consciousness.

This paper is concerned with a vision that will shape the
future; it is trying to discover the way humanity sees itself and
it will try to solve the difficulties the future might bring. Can
philosophy be the answer, or does it take more than human
understanding? This idea will result in an attempt to formulate
some principles of integral and progressive thinking, an
attainment that can today only be envisioned in its outlines and
that will have to be developed over time.15

A note about popularity needs to be inserted here. Popularity
is not a criterion of truth, in fact, it often is indicative of a lack
of truth, or, as history has proven, it is an indication of what
can be called “half-truth.” Something becomes popular because
it conveys some truth, but in an easy form, which often
disguises the untruthful, but popular aspect of the statement. In
the case of the Integral Philosophy of Ken Wilber this issue will
be explored below under the term of spiritual materialism.16

He further indicates that the philosophical tradition for
several thousand years, in East and West, has seen the structure
of being in similar ways, talking about the area of the “I” as the
Beautiful, about the area of “We” as the Good and about the
right sight (the “It and Its”) as the area of the True. (See picture
above) Combining the tradition and the modern understanding
of consciousness he added another aspect to this structure, that
of the levels. With this concept, he introduces into the structure
of the perennial philosophy the modern idea of historicity, of
evolution and progress.

In this Wilber follows the view of Teilhard de Chardin and
others, who had indicated that the evolutionary aspect of reality
was a new understanding. Additionally, they had also described
this evolution in not only a biological Darwinian sense, but also

much more in an ontological sense, ascribing this concept of
evolution to the world and the reality of being. Teilhard had
developed his view from the scientific understanding of the
human phenomenon, since then many studies of psychology and
philosophy have built a rather substantial understanding of the
progressive character of the universe.

In Wilber’s graph above,17 the development of the individual
consciousness is shown as starting at the center and moving
towards the corners in a continuous evolution of awareness, of
behavior, of social and cultural understanding.

The same is true for the reality and development of the
universe, starting in the center with the big bang and developing
upwards and towards the corners in all four directions.

What should never be overlooked is the fact that this
development is not happening in four different directions, but
that these four quadrants are integrated and corresponding
aspects of the same reality. Whatever develops or changes in
one quadrant has effects in all the others, and happens at the
same level in all four quadrants. This fact was cogently
demonstrated by Wilber in an overview of the modern
understanding    of    developmental    psychology    and    is
demonstrated in the history of humankind as well.

In the figure above from Wilber’s books, this development is
depicted. Beginning in the center, the development of the
physical world on the right side and of the spiritual world on the
left side is noted in the different levels of development. In all
for direction, the development starts in the middle and spreads
out from there, this progress is interconnected, and all four
arrows are presenting the development of the whole.

Obviously, this scheme presupposes the understanding that
awareness is present at all levels of development of the universe.
The reader is invited to seek the explanation for this
understanding of awareness and the history of this ontological
and epistemological idea in the writings of Wilber. Wilber
describes the development of the universe in three spheres: The
understanding, development and integration of physiosphere
(matter), biosphere (living organisms) and noosphere (a
Teilhardian concept, meaning the sphere of the mind), is
presupposed in this scheme.

Wilber’s Holon

There is another Wilberian concept (originally coined by
Arthur Koestler) that is important for the understanding of this

metaphysical concept of integration, which again places Wilber
in the center of modern thinking and demonstrates that all of
his concepts are thoroughly integrated with the understanding
of science. This is his concept of the Holon. This Greek term
stands in for the word whole but in a very specific sense. Wilber
explains that the world is not made of matter or spirit, who in
his and Teilhard’s system are never to be separated, but out of
Holons. A Holon is a whole consisting of parts in its own right,
and which is always at the same time a part of a higher whole.

Consequently, and that is important to the understanding of
Wilber’s system, everything is such a Holon, and dependent on
what place such a Holon is found it will be including always
parts and be a part of other wholes. So for example, the atom is
a whole compared to subatomic particles such as electrons or
even lower quarks etc. As soon as the atom is included in a
higher whole such as a molecule, it becomes a part of this.
Again, the molecule will be part of the cell, and the cell of the
organism and so forth, even into the spiritual area of
consciousness, this principle is continued. There is no end in
either direction. The reality consists of these Holons, which
gradually developed into ever-higher wholes.

When the oppositeness of Guardini and the crossing of
opposites is introduced into the Wilberian concept of
Quadrants and Holons a new idea is emerging, which we call the
tetrachic structure of being. What is important to note is the
fact that this is a basic structure of being, it appears in all
concrete existing entities, and solves the old problem of the
whole and its parts, in developing the understanding of reality.
This relationship is placed at the center of the consideration:
reality is seen as it is concrete and actual, not in abstract logical
constructions, but as it is. It takes this difficult logical
structure to approach the concrete and individual reality, to
understand its functioning and gain new insight in “how reality
really is.”

It is further important to recognize that it takes a special
way of thinking and understanding in order to be able to
penetrate to this level of understanding. As Teilhard of Chardin
mentioned, there are two different way of thinking,

> However, it is just at this point, in fact, that we meet
> an initial split in the thinking mass of mankind.

And further:

> Beneath     an     infinite   number     of     secondary
> differentiation, caused by the diversity of social
> interests, of scientific investigation or religious faith,
> there are basically two types of minds, and only two:
> those who do not go beyond (and see no need to go
> beyond) perception of the multiple — however
> interlinked in itself the multiple may appear to be —
> and those for whom perception of this same multiple is
> necessarily completed in some unity. There are only, in
> fact, pluralists and monists: those who do not see, and
> those who do.18

Obviously, in this paper the thinking in unity is attempted
and there are several ways how this can be described. Teilhard
calls it monistic versus pluralistic thinking, another way do
understand the relationship between these different ways of
thinking and understanding reality was described by Guardini,
who wrote his book before Teilhard’s papers were available and
mentioned three ways of understanding.

Guardini’s Epistemology or three Ways of
Understanding

Guardini at the end of his book “Der Gegensatz” presents
another interesting consideration about the way concrete reality
is understood. He distinguishes three levels of understanding:
rational, trans-rational and super-rational (in German: Rational,
Außer-Rational and Über-Rational).

The first is the rational understanding forming concepts,
which abstracts from the concrete individual reality and forms a
general idea. In order to individualize we have to give this thing,
this animal or person a name or indicate that we mean this
house and not the other house next to it. Fortunately, houses
have numbers and people and pets have names, otherwise we
could not speak about an individual person without describing

some features that are specific to that individual, or pointing to
that individual, like in court.

Guardini describes another way of understanding, which he
calls intuition. This way of understanding Guardini calls trans-
rational (“Außer-Rational”), which he describes as a clear and
normal way of understanding. Additionally, he places these two
ways of understanding in an opposition, so that the conceptual,
abstract way of understanding can never be totally separated
from the intuitive concrete way of understanding. Whenever we
think of a general abstract concept, like that of “cat,” or
felineness, we somehow have the concrete experience and
picture of a specific individual cat or cats in mind, only that
makes the abstract thought possible and meaningful.

And whenever we think or talk about an individual cat, for
example, the abstract concept of cat is in the field of
understanding as well, because we know always both, the focus
and concentration may be on the individual or on the abstract
concept, but both cannot be thought about without the other
side, i.e., its opposite being included and in some way this
defines the idea of either a particular animal or person. On the
other hand, the idea of animalness, or humanness must be
considered whenever the individual example of this animal or
person is considered,. Even if we invent a fictitious animal, like
the unicorn, we have to make a picture of it in our mind, and
this picture will be concrete of such an animal and not abstract
as the concept of unicornness would be.

After that discussion, the third way of understanding is
mentioned by Guardini with some caution. He claims that the
mystery of the living is not in the intuitive versus the rational
understanding, but in this third way of understanding that he
calls super-rational, it is a higher understanding than reason or
intuition, it is the understanding of the whole, of the unity of
reality and it is achieved in the tension between rational and
intuitive understanding. It is not a Hegelian synthesis, which
abolishes the other ways of understanding; it is an original, a
first and essential understanding, which is actually very simple
in its complicatedness. Any attempt to define this logically, is
bound to fail. This core of the concrete reality can only be

understood in an act of knowing, that has the same structure as
the reality, and this is what Guardini calls vision (Anschauung):

> To understand the core of the living reality and to
> approach its mystery is not a nebulous imagination, it
> rather takes vision, which is possible only in the
> tension, and in respect of the mystery, which requires
> discipline and self-control.19

Guardini describes further this concept and indicates that any
one-sidedness destroys this tension of understanding reality;
that it leads to erroneous simplification, and to false
explication and failure to understand truthfully. Only the
oppositeness of this relationship allows the human mind to
grasp the whole and to use rational understanding and intuitive
perception in a scientific and philosophically correct way in
approaching reality. Rationalism and intellectualism, if used
one-sided, will be opposed by Intuitionism, or Romanticism and
Mysticism and both will fail to understand reality as it really is.

In understanding reality, this epistemological structure needs
always to be kept in mind, and the vast theological and pastoral
work of Romano Guardini is testimony to that fact. Here we
will use this understanding to improve on the psychological and
cosmological conceptualization of Ken Wilber and later it is
expected to be helpful in understanding the theological and
revelatory Writings of the Bahá’í Faith. The last part of this
paper will be an attempt to apply this way of thinking to
psychology as a proof of its value and effectiveness. Another
thought, which will be considered later, is the fact that in
modern physics, especially in Quantum Mechanic, light has
oppositional character, it is showing wave characteristics
and/or corporal characteristic, depending on the research
apparatus of the investigator, the same is true for Einstein’s
Relativity Theory, between mass and energy.

This oppositional essence at the core of reality has created a
revolution in physics and in philosophy as well. It has put
consciousness in the center of discourse, with many
consequences that will be explored later.

Integral Opposite of Unity in Diversity (Goethe,
Solovyov, Gabriel, Wucherer)

The history of the thinking in “Gegensatz” (Oppositeness) has
predecessors but comes to its fruition in the writings of
Augustinus Karl Wucherer-Huldenfeld, who wrote his
dissertation on the Gegensatz philosophy of Romano Guardini
and developed this and other ideas into a Philosophy of the
Whole (Ganzheitsphilosophie). In his most recent book,
Philosophische Theologie im Umbruch20 (Philosophic Theology
in Radical and Renewing Change) he has developed this topic
over many pages as a separate topic.

In this excurse or digression first the general idea of the one
and the many is discussed, and then its development by Thomas
Aquinas is described. The different understanding of the
dialectic of the idea of the whole is seen in its extreme
understanding of totalitarian unity versus anarchistic plurality.
Finally the history of the integral whole is explained in the
Aristotelian tradition and the new paradigms of its
understanding are presented, where Guardini and Teilhard de
Chardin play a major role.

It is significant that Wucherer, when applying this idea of the
integral whole to the different religions and the conversion
from one religion to another, presents an understanding that is
only expressed in the Bahá’í understanding of unity of religion.

> A criterion of the truth of one’s own religion is the
> uninhibited and loving acceptance of all other paths to
> salvation of humankind, because ultimately they all
> stem from the same origin as your own religion.

He claims in this passage that all religions are from the same
origin, are from God, their revelations are presented by distinct
messengers, at different times to humanity at different levels of
evolution. The same God is revealed in the different revelations,
which were given at different historical times to different
people, therefore the same message had to be presented in
diverse ways. Additionally, he further says that

> the conversion or the going from one religion to
> another (if one has honestly lived in the original
> religion) is outdated, or possibly even morally
> questionable, if the growing into another religious
> community excludes the improved retention and
> deepening in the own original religion from which one
> is coming from.21

These statements are based on an understanding of the
different religions of this world, that is only present in the
Bahá’í Faith, i.e., all religions are true and are only steeps and
historical expressions of the different Manifestations, who all
bring the same message from God to humankind, adjusted to
the level of understanding in the different periods of history.

That this idea is not alien to the Christian message was
demonstrated by Wucherer in a personal discussion with this
writer. He reminded this writer of the story of Cornelius in the
Acts of the Apostles, (Chapter 10-11) where Cornelius, who
obviously was a Roman and a pagan at the time, is several times
mentioned as a devout God-fearing person (Act 10:1; 10:22:
upright and God-fearing) who in his prayers got a message from
God to seek Peter and who together with his family and friends
received the Holy Spirit even before he was baptized. It is
remarkable that this episode which is a lengthily passage of the
Acts and is repeatedly mentioning the religious qualities of
Cornelius has been so totally forgotten in Christianity. Many
Christians condemn not only the adherents of other Religions
but also members of other Christian denominations, a fact that
does not seems to be based on scripture, but is a human
convention of intolerance and exclusivity born from pride and
ignorance and based on a wrong understanding of reality. When
the oppositional aspect of reality is overlooked, the unity is
destroyed, politically as well as socially and philosophically.

Matter and Spirit (Teilhard, Ebner, Buber)

The relationship between matter and spirit has occupied
philosophers throughout history, from materialisms of a
Democritus to Hobbes Leviathan and finally to Karl Marx and
the dialectical materialism of Communism, as described by

Stalin. There is the dualistic solution as presented by Descartes,
which is dominating modern science, and the conflict between
Plato and Aristotle, about what is reality, the eternal ideas of
Plato or the concrete reality as presented in the physics and
metaphysics of Aristotle has never been resolved.

In recent times Teilhard de Chardin has attempted a novel
solution by stating that mater and spirit are fundamentally
connected, are dependent of each other and are in a process of
development that has come in our days to a significant solution.

Ferdinand Ebner has placed the spiritual in man into the
word, and proves that the word, given to man is the source of
man’s spiritual existence, a similar approach has been presented
by Buber and the other personal dialogical thinkers of the last
century.

Theology

New Heaven and New Earth

In the book of Revelation (21:1) a vision is described

> Then I saw a new heaven and a new earth, the first
> heaven and the first earth had disappeared now, and
> there was no longer any sea.

Bahá’u’lláh interpreted this passage in a new way, stating:

> On the contrary, by the term “earth” is meant the earth
> of understanding and knowledge, and by “heavens” the
> heavens of divine Revelation. [KI 47]

This change from the old to the new is a change of
understanding, of a new understanding of the creation as
renewed by the new Revelation. What is prophesied in the book
of Revelation has been fulfilled in the Revelation of
Bahá’u’lláh, the change is a change of understanding; it is a new
and sublime Vision.

> Were the breezes of Revelation to seize thee, thou
> wouldst flee the world, and turn unto the Kingdom, and
> wouldst expend all thou possessest, that thou mayest
> draw nigh unto this sublime Vision. [SLH 81]

In the Surih of the Temple, Bahá’u’lláh describes the Maiden
as announcing to the world a new understanding of reality
expressed in new and wondrous sciences and craft, brought
through the Revelation of Bahá’u’lláh:

> Erelong shall We bring into being through thee
> exponents of new and wondrous sciences, of potent
> and effective crafts, and shall make manifest through
> them that which the heart of none of Our servants hath
> yet conceived.22 [SLH 35]

Must it not be assumed that the new philosophical and
scientific understandings, which have been presented in the first
part of this paper, are part of the new understanding of reality?
This new understanding was originated in the Revelation of
Bahá’u’lláh and it was found a century later by thinkers and
theologians, even if they had no first-hand knowledge of this
Revelation. To make sure that this is more than an idle
speculation, we will now demonstrate how the Bahá’í Writings
can be understood and how this new thinking in Opposite and
Tetrarchic structures can be found in the Bahá’í Writings. This
is not only found there, but it clarifies these structures, gives
them a new and deeper meaning, which does elucidate the
Writings as well and makes them easier to understand.

It takes a New Eye, a New Ear, a New Heart, and a New
Mind to find this new understanding of the Creation and it is
given to the seeker, as Bahá’u’lláh stated:

> He [the seeker] will find himself endowed with a New
> Eye, a New Ear, a New Heart, and a New Mind. [KI 195]

“Gegensatz” or Polar Oppositeness in the Bahá’í
Writings

In the Bahá’í writings the word opposite is only used in the
extreme and contradictory way, so that opposites excluder each
other like good and evil, light and darkness. Nevertheless, other
concepts are frequently placed in opposite or polar positions as
can easily be demonstrated. When Bahá’u’lláh speaks in the
Tablet of Wisdom of the world of existence coming into being
he presents on oppositional polar relationship of the principle
forces involved.

> The world of existence came into being through the
> heat generated from the interaction between the active
> force and that which is its recipient. These two are the
> same, yet they are different. Thus doth the Great
> Announcement inform thee about this glorious
> structure. [TB 140]

The active force and the recipient force are clearly describing
a “Gegensatz,” they are polar opposites, therefore they are
called the same and different. One can make a reference to the
Aristotelian concept of form and matter, but this understanding
of same and different goes beyond the Aristotelian concept of
form and matter, which are only conceived as being opposite
but not as the same as well. Bahá’u’lláh calls this a glorious
structure in His Great Announcement, placing a great emphasis
and importance on this way of describing reality and its origin.

When tetrarchic structures in the Bahá’í Writings are
described below, it will become clear that all the concepts used
to form a tetrarchy are in a “Gegensatz” or in polar
oppositeness to each other and are to be understood in the same
way. Such polar concepts are Firstness and Lastness, Inwardness
and Outwardness, [SVFV 27] Stillness and Motion, Will and
Purpose [GWB 164], Ascent and Descent (TU 51]; to mention only
the most obvious examples. Concluding it can be stated that the
concept “Gegensatz” or polar opposites is not present as such in
the Writings. Nevertheless, this phrase, common in the
Writings, leads us directly to the concept of “Gegensatz” as it
was described above.

Tetrarchies in the Bahá’í Writings

Bahá’u’lláh has many fourfold statements that can be seen as
tetrarchic statements, because they are addressing the principles
or origins of reality. A list is added here, that is most likely not
complete, but should make clear that this is a frequently used
form of speech in Bahá’u’lláh’s Writings.

These structures are from the early writings of Bahá’u’lláh,
mainly of the Bagdad Period. The last here mentioned is from
the Gleanings but is original in a Tablet written to Mírzá Hádí
during Bahá’u’lláh’s stay in Edirne (Adrianople). This is the
period where most of Bahá’u’lláh’s mystical writings were
composed, after His stay at the Mountain of Kurdistan where
He had contact with Sufis, who were visiting Him later on in
Bagdad after His return. Most of these statements were made
before his public announcement in the Garden of Ridván. This
point is made to explain that it is the mystical approach to
reality that is expressed in these tetrarchies. This approach is
based on a special way of understanding reality, which is called
vision like in this Verse of Bahá’u’lláh:

> Were the breezes of Revelation to seize thee, thou
> wouldst flee the world, and turn unto the Kingdom, and
> wouldst expend all thou possessest, that thou mayest
> draw nigh unto this sublime Vision.” [ESW 56]

The same term Vision (in German “Anschauung”), is used by
Guardini as presented above, in the context of the way we
understand reality. For Guardini Vision transcends the rational
and intuitive understanding and is needed to approach the
mystery of reality, when he said: “To understand the core of the
living reality and to approach its mystery is not a nebulous
imagination, it rather takes vision.”23 This mystery is the reality
seen in Bahá’u’lláh’s Revelation and Vision; it is the way to
approach this Revealed Reality.

While tetrarchies are found in the so-called mystical writings
of Bahá’u’lláh, these are philosophical and fundamental ideas
about being, which refer to the structure of reality and give us
insight in the new way of understanding reality of the Bahá’í
Revelation.

The question is here, can we organize these statements into a
tetrarchic structure and what does this mean? One answer would
be that these statements can be inserted into existing tetrarchic
structures without difficulty. If the Bahá’í concepts fit into
these structures and if this insertion makes sense, we can
conclude that these fourfold structures can be described as
tetrarchies. Another answer to the question posed above is the
fact that when the Bahá’í concepts are inserted into this
structure, they make sense and the other concepts become more
meaningful as well. So it seems advantageous on both ends,
advantageous for understanding the Bahá’í writings and also for
better understanding such structures in modern writings.

Integration of Tetrarchies

It is important that tetrarchies are not logical structures that
follow the logical way of understanding; neither do they follow
the intuitive way of understanding to follow Guardini’s
epistemology. Tetrarchies are elements of Vision, of
Anschauung, and therefore need to be understood in a totally

new way. Bahá’u’lláh indicate this distinction of understanding
when He describes the wayfarer’s journey in his mystical
pursuit. In the first part of the Valley of Unity He describes the
fact that the light of the sun, being white, is reflected in
colorful objects as color and concludes that colors are from the
object, not from the light. In other words the diversity of the
world is based on an underlying unity of light.

> In like manner, colors become visible in every object
> according to the nature of that object. For instance, in
> a yellow globe, the rays shine yellow; in a white the rays
> are white; and in a red, the red rays are manifest. Then
> these variations are from the object, not from the
> shining light. [SVFV 19]

Later he explains what this fact means to the wayfarer in his
journey towards the Unity with the Beloved. Those who only see
the diversity and color of objects see only the surface, the outside
of beings. What they do not see is the underlying unity of
reality, of all things. Looking only at the diversity and differen-
tiations of things, we do not see reality, but see the dust that
hides reality. Bahá’u’lláh then talks about some who look at the
light, which is the unity in diversity of the world, and the third group
He is talking about are those who see the origin of the world’s
unity; in the metaphor presented here, they see the sun itself.

> In sum, the differences in objects have now been made
> plain. Thus when the wayfarer gazeth only upon the
> place of appearance — that is, when he seeth only the
> many-colored globes — he beholdeth yellow and red and
> white; hence it is that conflict hath prevailed among the
> creatures, and a darksome dust from limited souls hath
> hid the world. And some do gaze upon the effulgence
> of the light; and some have drunk of the wine of
> oneness and these see nothing but the sun itself. [SVFV 21]

These are the three levels of knowing, the three planes we
know reality, from the diversity of this world to the unity in
this diversity and to the origin of this relationship of unity in
diversity in the unity of God. These different epistemological
positions are the cause of conflict in this world, according to

Bahá’u’lláh, which could easily be demonstrated in describing the
different philosophical and scientific opinions prevalent today.

> Thus, for that they move on these three differing
> planes, the understanding and the words of the
> wayfarers have differed; and hence the sign of conflict
> doth continually appear on earth. [SVFV 21]
In the following passage Bahá’u’lláh describes the three basic
ways of understanding reality, the three epistemological
positions towards the understanding of reality and he adds a
fourth position, the position of ignorance, of being unable to
see anything, of being “completely veiled.” Again, he adds to
this explanation the insight in the problems which is created by
those “ignorant people,” who do not see the reality in a spiritual
understanding and therefore inflict on people what they actually
deserve themselves.

> For some there are who dwell upon the plane of oneness
> and speak of that world, and some inhabit the realms of
> limitation, and some the grades of self, while others are
> completely veiled. Thus do the ignorant people of the
> day, who have no portion of the radiance of Divine
> Beauty, make certain claims, and in every age and cycle
> inflict on the people of the sea of oneness what they
> themselves deserve. [SVFV 21]
This description can be compared with Guardini’s three ways of
understanding, explained above.

Those “who dwell upon the plane of oneness” have vision or
Anschauung, those who “inhabit the realms of limitation” are
bound by logical thinking only, and those who inhabit “the
grades of self” clearly belong to those who have intuition as
their tool of understanding.

It should not be surprising that tetrarchic structures are
difficult to understand, especially as we are all seeing the world
mostly in scientific and logical terms, are used to explanations
of reality in this way and are not educated to accept other ways
of understanding. As Guardini has noted vision is difficult, it
takes the toleration of the tension between logical knowledge and
intuition and it entails “respect of the mystery, which requires

discipline and self-control.” On the other hand, Guardini’s
influence in the Catholic understanding of religion, primarily in
Germany but even here in USA, where his books are translated,
might indicate that this way of thinking is not only powerful,
but also forward-looking and progressive for our times.

Thoughts about Dual and Tetrarchic Structures in the Bahá’í Faith

In the following pages, the adjective tetrarchic24 is used from
the Greek meaning four (tetras = four) princes governing a
single kingdom, in contrast to monarchy, where there is only
one (monos = one) ruler. As used here, tetrarchy refers to the
four principles that constitute the whole; they all are
independent principles, yet, they are integrated in the whole and
they contribute to the whole. In the Bahá’í writings, these four
principles are translated into English as the four states of man.

> And thus firstness and lastness, outwardness and
> inwardness are, in the sense referred to, true of thyself,
> that in these four states conferred upon thee thou
> shouldst comprehend the four divine states, and that
> the nightingale of thine heart on all the branches of the
> rosetree of existence, whether visible or concealed,
> should cry out: “He is the first and the last, the Seen
> and the Hidden....” [SVFV 27]

With this passage in mind, we shall below consider the
principles of a Tetrarchic Developmental Psychology, which
deals with how the human psyche develop and questions of a
possible Tetrarchic Psychopathology. The latter considers how
mental illness affects the human psyche. We shall also consider
what this new approach may mean for a Tetrarchic approach to
Psychotherapy.

In the figure below the fourfold or tetrarchic structure is
shown to consist of a double tetrarchic paradigm: Two opposite
states are opposed and integrated with two other opposite
states. In this paradigm, it is important to reconcile and
integrate all the four or eight opposites into a whole, as an
example of Unity in Diversity:

Motion     <|>    Stillness
eros/thanatos     —     life/death drive

Will    <|>    Purpose
purposeful goal directed     —     freedom of choice

Firstness   <|>   Lastness
individual     —    collective

Inwardness     <|>   Outwardness

spiritual     —    material

Leaving aside other four-fold principles in the Writings, we
shall consider only these four, which depict the reality of life in
this double tetrarchic structure. In these four states of man, the
tetrarchic paradigm is applied to the different areas of
psychology. Bahá’u’lláh indicates that this tetrarchic paradigm is
essential to all reality by calling it to come from the “rosetree of
existence” [SVFV 27]. Another aspect of this structure needs to
be emphasized: the total spiritual unity of the soul that is seen
in our limited vision as a tetrarchic structure. Bahá’u’lláh
expresses that clearly when talking in the same tablet about the
different vision of reality:

> For some there are who dwell upon the plane of oneness
> and speak of that world, and some inhabit the realms of
> limitation, and some the grades of self, while others are
> completely veiled. [SV 20]

Three different planes of vision of reality are described: one is
the plane of oneness, the other the realm of limitation, and
grades of self and finally, the realm of those who see nothing at
all. What is described in this paper is the realm of “limitation
and self,” which is the area of psychological studies. Yet the
plane of oneness, of unity, and of the whole must never be
overlooked and must be taken into account whenever the world
is seen as it presents itself to our vision.

Therefore Bahá’u’lláh reminds us at the end of the Valley of
Unity of this vision of oneness:

> These statements are made in the sphere of that which is
> relative, because of the limitations of men.

> Otherwise, those personages who in a single step have
> passed over the world of the relative and the limited,
> and dwelt on the fair plane of the Absolute, and pitched
> their tent in the worlds of authority and command —
> have burned away these relativities with a single spark,
> and blotted out these words with a drop of dew.

> And they swim in the sea of the spirit, and soar in the
> holy air of light. Then what life have words, on such a
> plane, that “first” and “last” or other than these be seen

> or mentioned! In this realm, the first is the last itself,
> and the last is but the first. [SV 27]

In the original the above quote and the quote below are one
paragraph, here the sentences are separated for easier analysis.

This vision of the spirit ... in the holy air of light is what
unifies the tetrarchic structure and what allows the four
principles described above to be seen in their unity. Both of the
contradictory aspects are integrated, or they are the same, so
that the first is the last, as noted above. Both must always be in
sight, which is why seekers must see with the eye of God:

> Then will the manifold favors and outpouring grace of
> the holy and everlasting Spirit confer such new life
> upon the seeker that he will find himself endowed with
> a new eye, a new ear, a new heart, and a new mind.

> He will contemplate the manifest signs of the universe,
> and will penetrate the hidden mysteries of the soul.

> Gazing with the eye of God, he will perceive within
> every atom a door that leadeth him to the stations of
> absolute certitude.7 [GWB 267]

When analyzing this we find that the tetrarchic structure is
based on the integration of opposites, of a dual structure
forming a whole. This is basically a dual and paradoxically
opposing and integrated structure. The dual nature of man was
already indicated in the following verse of the Bible:

All     things are double, one against another:

> and he hath made nothing imperfect. (Book of Sirach,
> 25:24)

Here, too, we observe the basis of the fourfold structure
described above which embraces the opposites of first and last,
inwardness and outwardness. It needs to be noted that several
of these tetrarchic structures can be superimposed on each
other as seen in the diagram given above which forms a
panoramic picture of the human condition.

> understanding. The first, as indicated by Bahá’u’lláh, is

Psychology

After having established the tetrarchic vision of reality in
philosophy, after having expanded and transcended this view in
the theological section of this paper, it could be applied to a
specific field, to psychology to demonstrate its value and
potential usefulness. Other realms of reality could be as well be
seen in the tetrarchic vision, for example modern Quantum
Physics, where the dual character of light as particle and as wave
can be seen as a polar opposite and this findings have
revolutionized modern physics, but we will not pursue this idea
here.

This application to psychology has been made in a previous
paper by this author, about “The Essence of Man,”26 in this
paper the basic philosophical and theological condition for the
finding presented in that paper were more explicitly explained,
giving it a deeper understanding so that future application to
psychology can be improved, and its meaning towards a new
understanding of the psychology of man can be expanded.
Further studies will be needed to prove the thesis, which was
enlarged in the present paper, to diverse psychological disorders
and to the infantile development as well as to the mature human
behavior.

The concept of the tetrarchic structure of reality was further
explained and the concept of Polarity or Gegensatz was
developed to further deepen the understanding of reality as

presented in its tetrarchic structures. The previous paper about
“The Essence of Man” and the understanding of the tetrarchic
structure as applied to psychology was extended and presented
with a better understanding of its integral aspects. These aspects
include the polarity of reality and a new epistemology to be able
to have a vision of reality seen in its tetrarchic structure. This
added insight was found to be present in the Bahá’í Writings,
and this further improved the understanding of how to see
reality in this new and progressive way, at the three planes of
Vision, Reason, and Insight and as presented in the Valley of
Unity in the Seven Valleys of Bahá’u’lláh where He said: “For
some there are who dwell upon the plane of oneness and speak
of that world, and some inhabit the realms of limitation, and
some the grades of self, while others are completely veiled. …”
[SVFV 21]

It seems to be advantageous that the development of the
progressive understanding of the Bahá’í Writings is coordinated
with the thinking of today in order to better present them when
teaching the Bahá’í Faith. This paper needs to be regarded as
another small step towards this goal.
