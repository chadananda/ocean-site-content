The Tablet of Wisdom

In Lights of `Irfan, vol. 9 (2008), Ian Kluge has published a response
to my earlier paper “Relativism: A Basis for Bahá’í Metaphysics.1 I
would like to thank him for a clear and informative description of
the background and the various elements that go towards relativism.
From the start of this response, I would like to make it clear that
I have never regarded my paper as a definitive exposition of Bahá’í
theology or philosophy. I recognize that future Bahá’í scholars will
develop understandings of the Bahá’í teachings that will make what I
have written seem naive, ill-judged or simply wrong. At such an early
stage in the development of the Bahá’í Faith, it would be foolish to
imagine that we can make definitive statements when so much of
the Bahá’í scriptures remain unpublished and inaccessible. Indeed
since the publication of that first paper, I have modified my position
as described below.

According to the Bahá’í view of where we are in humanity’s develop-
ment, Bahá’u’lláh has not come merely as a further Manifestation

Lights of ‘Irfán Book Twelve

of God, he is a Universal Manifestation coming at the close of one
cycle and the start of another cycle. To me this means that what he
has brought is so revolutionary that the new world that will come
into being will be unrecognisable to the people of the past or pres-
ent generation. When people in several thousand years time look
at the process he has initiated, they will see it as the building of an
entirely new world psychologically, socially, economically and, yes,
even philosophically; in other words, that the cessation of war and
creation of a peaceful united world will just be the surface effect of
a much more radical change that has occurred in human minds and
souls; that he has not just come to bring about world unity but to
construct a new vision of reality itself.

I would maintain therefore that Bahá’u’lláh is not a proponent
of Enlightenment philosophy who wishes to extend the liberal
democratic values of the West to the rest of the world as some have
suggested; he has not come to tinker at the edges of philosophy; he is
not merely seeking to put right a few problems with the way the world
is organized economically and socially; he has not come just to add
a new international layer to the local and national institutions that
we already possess. His aim is a radical change much more radical
than any envisaged by any of the philosophies of the past. Unfortu-
nately the word “radical” has been used of such political movements as
communism and thus to call Bahá’u’lláh “radical” appears to put him
into a category with the likes of Marx, but what Bahá’u’lláh aims at is
something much deeper than anything that Marx wanted to achieve.
The only effect of the Communist revolution was to replace one hier-
archical oppressive social structure with another one (cf Orwell’s
Animal Farm). What Bahá’u’lláh is seeking to change is the very
structure of society that has been the norm for some 7,000 years. This
change can only be effected on the basis of changes in politics, econ-
omy, social structures and also in our conceptual and philosophical
models. This change, the Bahá’í teachings maintain cannot be brought
about by legislation and social policy. It also requires individuals who

Relativism, A Theological and Cognitive Basis for Bahá’í Ideas

are spiritually transformed so as to be less self-centred and more
other-centred; and it requires social processes at a community level
that can replace the present hierarchical social processes.

My critique of Kluge’s response has four main points, which I will
discuss in turn:

1. Along with others who have criticised my article on rela-

> tivism, I feel that Kluge has simply taken the word “rela-
> tivism” and reproduced all of the usual criticisms of this
> philosophical concept without taking into account that I
> have in fact used the word in a very limited way and in
> relation to a limited area of Bahá’í teachings. Thus most of
> what he writes in his article may well be true but is simply
> not relevant to my article.

2. Kluge has not taken into account the fact that this article

> was written some 30 years ago and published more than
> 20 years ago and that I have modified my position since
> then. Following the publication of my original article,
> Keven Brown pointed out to me an un-translated passage

> the level of the Absolute Reality of the Divinity Itself.
> Subsequently I modified my view and published this in
> my article “The God of Bahá’u’lláh”,2 a paper which Kluge

3. In both articles, I have constructed an argument drawing

4. Point 3 in fact highlights a much more fundamental

1: Relativism and relativism

Kluge has given a very extensive description of relativism in its widest
scope of meaning. In my article, it may be that I was not sufficiently
clear or emphatic but I did state there that I have confined my argu-
ment to a specific area of relativism, cognitive relativism, and applied
it to a limited area of Bahá’í teaching, that of metaphysics. Thus much
of what Kluge writes about ontological relativism (p. 187), moral
relativism (p. 184), cultural relativism (p. 181, 186–7), legal relativ-
ism (p. 181, 187), etc., interesting as it may be, has no relevance to
my article. Of course I do not think that the Bahá’í Faith advocates
moral relativism. Bahá’u’lláh inculcates a moral code that by today’s
standards is even considered traditional or old-fashioned and is the very
antithesis of moral relativism. Of course I do not think that the Bahá’í
teachings advocate an ontological relativism (i.e. that the existence of
all entities is context-dependent and determined by individual and/or
cultural beliefs). Bahá’u’lláh clearly considers that there is an Absolute
Reality which exists independently of every human point of view.

Relativism, A Theological and Cognitive Basis for Bahá’í Ideas

Relativism does not apply to most areas of the Bahá’í teachings,only
to a limited area. In relation to ethics, Bahá’u’lláh restates the moral
laws of previous religions (although there are changes in social ethics
as these are part of the social teachings); in relation to social teachings,
the Bahá’í scriptures advocate the principle of progressive revelation
that the teachings brought by the Manifestations of God develop in
accordance with human social progress. Paul Lample in his excellent
treatment of the area of social action in the Bahá’í teachings, has
suggested that the nonfoundationalism of Richard Bernstein is the
best theoretical model for the Bahá’í teachings in the area of social
action.3 It is only in the narrowly-defined area of metaphysics that I
am suggesting that a cognitive relativism applies.

What I am suggesting is that the relativism that applies to the Bahá’í
teachings relates to metaphysics and is cognitive. I am defining meta-
physics as that which is beyond this physical world in other words,
God and the spiritual world. Cognitive means that it applies, not to
“what is” but to what we are capable of knowing about “what is”. Thus
my contention is that, although we believe that there is an Absolute
Reality (God) in the metaphysical realm (the spiritual world beyond
the physical), what we can know or comprehend about this entity
that we call God is relative and not absolute. It is relative to our
viewpoint, our psychological, spiritual, cultural and other limitations
that confine our viewpoint and prevent us from comprehending the
totality of God.

In explaining Shoghi Effendi’s statement that “religious truth is not
absolute but relative”, Kluge writes:

> “From this we conclude that relativism does not apply to
> the “eternal verities” (universal, objective and foundational)
> but only to the way they may be expressed outwardly, or
> historically.” (p. 209)

Lights of ‘Irfán Book Twelve

But my contention is that we human beings do not know what these
“eternal verities” are in relation to metaphysics (and even in the area
of ethics for the most part), we only have access to “the way they may
be expressed outwardly, or historically”. Since we only have access to
the historical expression of the “eternal verities”, then our knowledge
of them is relative. This is true even in the area of ethics. Both the
Bible and the Qur’an appear to consider slavery and holy war to be
permissible yet Bahá’u’lláh now forbids these. Presumably the “eter-
nal verities” have not changed and yet there has been a profound
change in their historical expression. We however only have access
to that historical expression. The same degree of change has occurred
with many social structures and institutions such as the position of
women in society and the position of the clerical class. For all we
know there are aspects of our society that we regard as permissible
and normal and fondly consider to be “eternal verities” which future
Manifestations of God will change.

Of course when we are dealing with ethical relativism, we are tread-
ing on thin ice and it would be easy for some to take our words out
of context and apply to them a meaning we did not intend (which is
why I have not dwelt at any length on this aspect in my papers). The
concept of ethical or moral relativism enshrined in the Bahá’í teach-
ing is not one of “anything goes” in the present day which is what
this term connotes to most people. Rather it is one that states that,
over a long period of history, ethical ideals and values have changed
as human society has changed and some of what was considered
permissible in a past age is not considered permissible today.

Furthermore Kluge’s asserts that:

> “Of course, it is evident that we do, in fact, have some knowl-
> edge of these “eternal verities” or other absolute truths…
> Thus, throughout history, we attain partial glimpses of the
> essential truths, the “eternal verities”. (p. 210)

Relativism, A Theological and Cognitive Basis for Bahá’í Ideas

I would ask the question: how do we know what are the “eternal
verities” and what are those aspects of Bahá’u’lláh’s revelation that
are not eternal and which future Manifestations of God will change?
Perhaps if we had lived in the 12th century, we might have fondly
imagined that the institution of slavery or holy war and those ethical
values that underlie these practices were part of the “eternal verities”.
Even today there are many who think that war is an “eternal verity” of
the human condition. The teachings of future Manifestations of God
are hidden from us precisely because we cannot “bear them now” (cf
John 16:12). This in itself seems to me a convincing argument that
we cannot know what the “eternal verities” are in any exhaustive or
definitive sense in the area of ethics. We can only know them in the
more general sense of spiritual qualities such as love, justice etc.
In fact, the “partial glimpses” that Kluge refers to are precisely the
cognitive relativism imposed on human beings (and indeed on all
creatures) by the fact that they are incapable of comprehending the
levels of reality above their own level.

Kluge has a section “Relativism versus Relationalism” deals with
ontological questions whether things exist or do not - this again has
nothing to do with the cognitive relativism that my two relativism
papers are concerned with. However even in this section there are
suggestive sentences that point to the position that I am suggesting.
For example, Kluge states that:

> Again we observe that in these statements the attributes
> of existence and nonexistence are not simply matters of
> opinion or viewpoint in the relativistic sense of our being
> able to hold the opposite view with equal validity. There
> is, for example, no standpoint from which creation is not
> contingent and dependent upon God, nor is there a stand-
> point from which God Himself depends on creation. (This
> should not be confused with the claim that humans may

Lights of ‘Irfán Book Twelve

> devise various concepts of God; the concepts, but not God
> Himself are dependent on man.) (p. 214)

But as `Abdu’l-Baha states all of our concepts of God are creations
of our minds. He does not exclude the Bahá’ís from this statement:

> Consider then, how all the peoples of the world are bowing
> the knee to a fancy of their own contriving, how they have
> created a creator within their own minds, and they call it the
> Fashioner of all that is—whereas in truth it is but an illusion.

Thus are the people worshipping only an error of perception.4

All of us, whether Bahá’ís or not, cannot have any concepts of God
that are independently true that occupy an Archimedean point. So
the fact that God exists is an assertion that we affirm (i.e. a statement
of belief)as soon as we try to conceptualise what “God exists” means
(i.e. try to bring it to the level of cognition), we are in the realm of rela-
tive truths, each of us conceptualises that ontological truth in differ-
ent ways in accordance with our worldview, our culture, our previous
intellectual and social experiences.

> But that Essence of Essences, that Invisible of Invisibles,
> is sanctified above all human speculation, and never to be
> overtaken by the mind of man. Never shall that immemorial
> Reality lodge within the compass of a contingent being. His
> is another realm, and of that realm no understanding can be
> won. No access can be gained thereto; all entry is forbidden
> there. The utmost one can say is that Its existence can be
> proved, but the conditions of Its existence are unknown.5

I cannot see that there is much difference between this concept of
relative truth and the concept of perspectivism that Kluge approves
of in his paper thus it may be that our difference in relation to this
part of his paper is merely that of terminology.

Relativism, A Theological and Cognitive Basis for Bahá’í Ideas

Kluge writes that as a result of relativism:

> …there is no common reality or world for all people. As
> seen immediately above, this leads to the impossibility of
> developing an even minimally coherent metaphysic theory of
> reality or general world-view (Weltanschauung). Even more,
> it also makes the entire Bahá’í project impossible. The mis-
> sion of the Bahá’í Faith is to provide a spiritual framework
> in which all the religious dispensations can find their place
> and be elevated to a new level,6 and in which the dream of a
> unified world order can be achieved. Such unity requires that
> to a considerable degree we share a common reality, that at
> least a sufficient number of people agree about the nature of
> reality, the nature of man and the world we live in. (p. 224)

I would disagree profoundly with what Kluge has written here. It
is the insistence on a single truth that has led the Western world
towards its intellectual, religious and cultural imperialism in which
it has insisted on its truth to the exclusion of all other perspectives.
In reaction to this other groups such as Islamic fundamentalists are
insisting that they have sole access to the truth. It is by allowing vari-
ous viewpoints of the truth to co-exist within the Bahá’í framework,
and thus giving dignity and value to these different frameworks, that
we can have truly have unity on an equal basis and lessen the appeal
of extremist positions.

2: At What Level Does Cognitive Relativism Apply?

Kluge takes up a great deal of his response in refuting the idea that the
Bahá’í Faith believes in any form of monism (pp. 219–222). Firstly, I
would like to say that everything that he writes is correct. He appears
to think, however, that by refuting monism, he has refuted my thesis.

This shows a misunderstanding of my thesis. My articles are not say-
ing that monism is the Bahá’í understanding of metaphysics. The
position advanced in my articles is that both monism and theism are
equally correct if they are taken as an understanding of God but they
are equally incorrect if they are taken as the absolute understanding
of God. Each understanding is correct from its own standpoint but
wrong from the other standpoint. To be more specific, they are correct
when understood at the level of the manifestation of the names and
attributes of God but are incorrect as understandings of the Essence
of God. This is an important point as much blood has been spilt over
this difference in human history7 and resolving the conflict would
therefore be a significant element in Bahá’í attempts to bring unity.

Both monists and theists regard their understandings as the abso-
lute understanding of the Essence of God. By refuting this standard
understanding of monism from the Bahá’í viewpoint, Kluge has in
fact given half of the proof of my argument. To complete the proof of
my position, I need only to refute the standard understanding of the-
ism from a Bahá’í viewpoint and establish that these two positions
are in fact both correct as relative understandings of the manifesta-
tions of the names and attributes of God (but not of God Himself).
This I need to do in three stages:

A. to refute, from a Bahá’í perspective, the standard under-

standing of theism;

B. secondly to demonstrate that both theism and monism

> apply to the Manifestation of God only and not to the
> Essence; and

C. to demonstrate that the Bahá’í scriptures advocate a

> cognitive relativism in order to explain how both theism
> and monism can apply to the Manifestation of God.

A. Refutation of Theism. Theism posits a God that can be known and
described. Foremost among the statements made about God is that
He is the Creator of all that exists. Many other attributes and actions
are attributed to Him in the scriptures of Judaism, Christianity and
Islam. In the Bahá’í scriptures, we find however that God is unknow-
able: ‘”The way is barred, and all seeking rejected.’ The minds of the
favourites of heaven, however high they soar, can never attain this
station, how much less the understanding of obscured and limited
minds.”8 Even the attributes of God that we think we understand are,
in reality, beyond our comprehension.

> It is not that we can comprehend His knowledge, His sight,
> His power and life, for it is beyond our comprehension; for
> the essential names and attributes of God are identical with
> His Essence, and His Essence is above all comprehension.9

In the Bahá’í scriptures, however, we find evidence that these descrip-
tions of God and His attributes refer not to the Essence of God but
in fact all of them refer to the Manifestations of God. Bahá’u’lláh
asserts that all pathways to the Ultimate Reality, whether that of
mystics (adh-dhákirún) or of the learned (al-`árifún) are in reality
pathways to the Manifestations of God—these two pathways can be
considered as allusions to the two pathways of monism (the mystics)
and theism (the learned). More specifically, Bahá’u’lláh denies that
either the pathway of the mystic (yadhkaraka) or that of learning and
esoteric knowledge (ya`raja ilá hawá’ `irfánika) yields knowledge of
Ultimate Reality; it yields knowledge only of the Manifestation:

> The loftiest sentiments which the holiest of saints (adh-
> dhákirún) can express in praise of Thee (yadhkaraka), and the
> deepest wisdom which the most learned of men (al-`árifún)
> can utter in their attempts to comprehend Thy nature (ya`raja
> ilá hawá’ `irfánika), all revolve around that Centre Which is
> wholly subjected to Thy sovereignty, Which adoreth Thy

> Beauty, and is propelled through the movement of Thy Pen
> [i.e. the Manifesation of God].10

Similarly, in his Tablet of the Uncompounded Reality (Lawh-i Basit
al-Haqíqa), Bahá’u’lláh states that “whatever wondrous references
and powerful descriptions have appeared from the mouth and pen
refer to the sublime Word [of God], the most exalted Pen, the primal
Summit, the true Homeland, and the Dawning-place of the manifes-
tation of mercy [i.e. the Manifesation of God].”’11

Bahá’u’lláh states that he himself is the one whom in the Hebrew
Bible is called Jehovah (Yahweh, YHWH)12 and this is confirmed
by Shoghi Effendi.13 Bahá’u’lláh also claims to be the Speaker on
Sinai.14 Jehovah and the Speaker on Sinai are of course considered
to have been God Himself in Judaism, Christianity and Islam.
Similarly, Bahá’u’lláh refers to Himself as the “Word” and as the
“Father”,15 again being terms associated in the Christian Bible with
God Himself. And similarly, the crowning attribute of God as the
Creator is in fact, attributed in the Long Obligatory Prayer to the
Manifestation of God: “He Who hath been manifested is the Hid-
den Mystery, the Treasured Symbol, through Whom the letters B
and E (Be) have been joined and knit together.”

Bahá’u’lláh states that even such attributes as “Godhead, Divinity,
Supreme Singleness, and Inmost Essence”, which we would normally
think of only in relationship to the Ultimate Reality, are in fact
attributable to the Manifestations of God.

> Viewed from the standpoint of their oneness and sublime
> detachment, the attributes of Godhead, Divinity, Supreme
> Singleness, and Inmost Essence, have been, and are appli-
> cable to those Essences of Being, inasmuch as they all abide
> on the throne of Divine Revelation, and are established upon
> the seat of Divine Concealment. Through their appearance

> the Revelation of God is made manifest, and by their coun-
> tenance the Beauty of God is revealed. Thus it is that the
> accents of God Himself have been heard uttered by these
> Manifestations of the Divine Being.16

`Abdu’l-Bahá confirms this, asserting that everything that is attributed
to God in the scriptures is in reality attributed to the Manifestation of
God and that anything else that human beings may think they attri-
bute to God is pure imagination.

> Accordingly all these attributes, names, praises and eulogies
> apply to the Places of Manifestation; and all that we imagine
> and suppose beside them is mere imagination, for we have no
> means of comprehending that which is invisible and inacces-
> sible… From this it is certain and evident that if we imagine
> a Divine Reality outside of the Holy Manifestations, it is
> pure imagination, for there is no way to approach the Reality
> of Divinity which is not cut off to us, and all that we imagine
> is mere supposition.17

Even when we talk of the Oneness of God (at-Tawhíd), we are in real-
ity, so Bahá’u’lláh asserts, talking of the Unity of the Manifestations:

> Beware, O believers in the Unity of God, lest ye be tempted
> to make any distinction between any of the Manifestations
> of His Cause, or to discriminate against the signs that have
> accompanied and proclaimed their Revelation. This indeed
> is the true meaning of Divine Unity, if ye be of them that
> apprehend and believe this truth.18

So the Bahá’í Faith, as well as refuting classical monism as Kluge
demonstrates, also refutes classical theism, as laid out by the theolo-
gians of Judaism, Christianity and Islam.

B. Both theism and monism apply to the Manifestation of God only
and not to the Essence of God. As demonstrated in the previous
section, all of these positions taken in the Bahá’í scriptures specifically
and categorically deny the traditional theism of Judaism, Christianity
and Islam. Since the Bahá’í scriptures also specifically and categori-
cally deny traditional monism, as Kluge has shown, what then are we
left with? I would suggest that what we are left with is affirmation
in the Bahá’í scriptures that both the theism and monism are true
if applied to the Manifestation of the names and attributes of God.
Thus for example, `Abdu’l-Baha in Some Answered Questions denies a
literal oneness of existence (wahdat al-wujúd) between the Creator and
the creation, wherein God becomes resolved into (munhall, dispersed
among) the forms of created things (as some Sufis and other monists
assert). But of course both Bahá’u’lláh and `Abdu’l-Baha maintain
that all things manifest at least some of the names and attributes
of God. Thus names and attributes of God, the signs of God, are
dispersed among all created things:

> …whatever I behold I readily discover that it maketh Thee
> known unto me, and it remindeth me of Thy signs, and of
> Thy tokens, and of Thy testimonies. By Thy glory! Every
> time I lift up mine eyes unto Thy heaven, I call to mind Thy
> highness and Thy loftiness, and Thine incomparable glory
> and greatness; and every time I turn my gaze to Thine earth,
> I am made to recognize the evidences of Thy power and the
> tokens of Thy bounty. And when I behold the sea, I find
> that it speaketh to me of Thy majesty, and of the potency of
> Thy might, and of Thy sovereignty and Thy grandeur. And
> at whatever time I contemplate the mountains, I am led to
> discover the ensigns of Thy victory and the standards of
> Thine omnipotence.19

Similarly, Bahá’u’lláh asserts, as the above quotations have demon-
strated, that theism is also true at the level of the Manifestation of God

and not at the level of the Essence of God. Indeed the Bahá’í scriptures
assert that we can say nothing about God. The only valid statement
that we can say about God is that He/She/It exists,nothing else:

> But that Essence of Essences, that Invisible of Invisibles,
> is sanctified above all human speculation, and never to be
> overtaken by the mind of man. Never shall that immemo-
> rial Reality lodge within the compass of a contingent being…
> The utmost one can say is that Its existence can be proved,
> but the conditions of Its existence are unknown.20

We have seen above that the statements about God made in theistic
traditions are related in the Bahá’í scriptures to the manifestation
of God. The statements in Monism asserting unity between the
individual and Absolute reality are also related by `Abdu’l-Baha to
the Manifestation of God, or rather to the Primal Will which is
the Reality of the Manifestation of God. In describing the monist
position, `Abdu’l-Baha makes use of the analogy of the ocean as the
Absolute Reality and of the waves of that ocean as the individual
human beings. He asserts in Some Answered Questions that this
position that the individual is emerges from and is absorbed back
into the ocean of the Absolute Reality is wrong.21 `Abdu’l-Baha
explains however that between the World of the Absolute Reality
and the physical world, there is an intermediate world, the World of
Command (`álam al-amr), wherein the Primal Will emanates from
God. This is the world of the Manifestation of God. He explains that
“the Primal Will is the inner reality of all things and all existent
entities are the manifestations of the Primal Will”;22 and in another
passage that the above concept of the waves that resolve into the
ocean of Reality applies at this level of the Primal Will, the Mani-
festation of God.23

In this way, both the theistic concept of God (and humanity’s abso-
lute separation and distinction from God) and the monistic concept

of the Absolute Reality (and humanity being resolved into and being
inseparable from this Reality) are related in the Bahá’í scriptures to
the concept of the Manifestation of God, who is in fact the Manifes-
tation of the Primal Will and exists at the intermediary level of the
World of Command.

C. The Bahá’í scriptures advocate a cognitive relativism in order to
explain how both theism and monism can apply to the Manifesta-
tion of God. In my paper “The God of Bahá’u’lláh”, I suggest that
Bahá’u’lláh has tackled this split between theism and monism in
five different ways, each of which is in its own right correct. This,
incidentally, is itself a response to Kluge’s contention (p.202) that
the statement that Relativism is a basis for Bahá’í metaphysics is
self-refuting, since it can only be relatively true. Yes, relativism is
itself only relatively true; there are four other ways of looking at this
question that are also relatively true. In this paper however, rather
than repeating what is said in my other paper about the other four, I
will just concentrate on relativism.

In the Tablet of the Uncompounded Reality, Bahá’u’lláh describes
the Manifestation of God thus: “even though outwardly He is given
a name and appears to be bound by limitations, He is, in His inner
reality, uncompounded (basít), sanctified from limitations. This
uncompounded state is relative and attributive (idáfí wa nisbí) and
not uncompounded in an absolute sense (min kull al-jihát).”24

The Manifestation of God is humanity’s contact or link with the
Absolute. He has a privileged, Archimedean standpoint and is thus
able to make pronouncements that are normative for all of human-
kind. But he is limited in what he can bring to us of Absolute Reality.
He is confined by the limitations of human understanding, of human
language and of the stage of development that humanity has reached.
Thus although in theory, he could bring us Absolute Truth and “eter-
nal verities”, in practice he only brings us a truth that is compatible

with and relative to human limitations and our stage of development.
The best that we as human beings can do is to study the scriptures that
the Manifestation brings and form our own understandings of God
and of the spiritual world. Of course this means that once one of the
Manifestations of God, such as Moses and Muhammad, had made a
strong statement against idolatry, it would no longer have been correct
for Jewish and Islamic theologians and philosophers to have viewed
spiritual reality in a way that included multiple gods. Similarly, since
in the Bahá’í scriptures, there is a strong statement that reincarnation
is not literally true, it would be wrong for Bahá’ís to construct theolo-
gies and philosophies that include this concept (although the Bahá’í
scriptures do give us hints that such concepts might have some relative
truth to them25).

Bahá’u’lláh and `Abdu’l-Baha have removed God out of our arena of
discourse completely and assert that all references either to a theis-
tic God or a monistic Absolute Reality are in fact references to the
Manifestation of God. How then can we reconcile the idea that both
theism and monism are true at the level of the Manifestation of God?
The Bahá’í scriptures themselves indicate the way. Bahá’u’lláh asserts
that any conceptions that human beings have of God are in reality the
products of their own mind; that human beings are unable to:

> …fathom the mystery of Him Who is the Day Star of Truth,
> Who is the invisible and unknowable Essence. The concep-
> tions of the devoutest of mystics, the attainments of the most
> accomplished amongst men, the highest praise which human
> tongue or pen can render are all the product of man’s finite
> mind and are conditioned by its limitations.26

> Exalted, immeasurably exalted, art Thou above the strivings
> of mortal man to unravel Thy mystery, to describe Thy glory,
> or even to hint at the nature of Thine Essence. For whatever

> such strivings may accomplish, they can never hope to tran-
> scend the limitations imposed upon Thy creatures…27

Since human minds are incapable of transcending these limitations
and conceptualising the Absolute Reality, Bahá’u’lláh states that the
concepts that human beings have are thus necessarily a reflection of
the viewpoint of that person:

> The meditations of the profoundest thinker, the devotions of
> the holiest of saints, the highest expressions of praise from
> either human pen or tongue, are but a reflection of that which
> hath been created within themselves…28

Similarly as we have seen above, `Abdu’l-Baha says that:

> All the people have formed a god in the world of thought,
> and that form of their imagination they worship…

> Therefore consider: All the sects and people worship their own
> thought; they create a god in their own minds and acknowl-
> edge him to be the creator of all things, when that form is
> a superstition thus people adore and worship imagination.29

`Abdu’l-Baha explains this further in his Commentary on the
Islamic tradition “I was a Hidden Treasure… “. Here in explain-
ing the differences between those philosopher-mystics who incline
to monism and those who incline to theism, `Abdu’l-Baha asserts
that these differences in the viewpoints arise from differences in the
fundamental natures (i.e., the Divine attributes predominant within
the soul/psyche complex) of the observers. The fundamental nature
of one individual inclines him to see Reality in a dualist mode, while
another will see Reality in a monist modem (see below for a more
detailed explanation of this point).30

In summary then, both Bahá’u’lláh and `Abdu’l-Baha are saying that
the differences that occur between those who see God in a theistic
mode and those who are inclined to seeing the Absolute Reality in a
monistic mode are due to the viewpoint of these different observers;
in other words that this is a matter of cognitive relativism. What they
understand of the Absolute is relative to their viewpoint.

To express all of this in the language of post-modernism and decon-
struction, we can say that the Bahá’í scriptures indicate that when
scripture (whether Bahá’í or those of other religions) refers to God,
the signifier “God cannot refer to an Absolute Entity, since there is
nothing that can be said about that Absolute Reality. Instead, what is
signified by the word “God” is that which is manifest of God in this
world. At the highest level this is of course the Manifestation of God
who is the perfect manifestation of all of the Names and Attributes of
God, but the Names and Attributes of God are also manifest in every
human being and even in Nature. In exactly the same way, the person
hearing or reading the word “God” in the scripture will impose upon
that a meaning drawn from a network of meanings in the person’s
mind and the culture in which the word is used. Thus ultimately the
meaning of the word “God” rests upon a network of texts that form
the background of the psyche and culture of the person using the
word. We as human beings are inescapably caught within this web
or net of meaning, to which the term “intertextuality” is applied. The
“signifier” (which is usually a word, but may be an image, sound or
action, invested with meaning) can truly represent the “signified” for
a given individual person, but not generically for all.31

3: What is to count as proof and evidence?

In the two articles that I have written on this subject, I have con-
structed my arguments drawing conclusions from three quotations
of Bahá’u’lláh and a quotation from `Abdu’l-Baha. Kluge has not

engaged with the argument that I have presented nor addressed any
of these quotations and has merely commented on a quotation from
Shoghi Effendi that I appended as supporting evidence. It seems to
me that if he is going to refute my paper, he should at least point
out where the interpretation of the Bahá’í scripture that I have pre-
sented is faulty.

What Kluge has done in arguing against the conclusions of my paper
is to bring forward logical and philosophical arguments. He appeals
to the rational. He takes up much of his article with trying to prove
that the position of relativism is “self-undermining and self refuting”
and “logically incompatible” with the Bahá’í teachings (p. 180, 202;
see pp. 204–211).

This appeal to logic and to rationalism is where I must part company
with Kluge. Indeed in my first paper I made it clear that I realize
that the position that I am putting forward may appear contrary
to Aristotlean standards of logic. But I would contend that these
Aristotelean standards are themselves not tenable when we are
considering matters that relate to anything outside our every-day
physical world. Even in science, it has become clear that Aristotelean
logic and the construction of reality based on Newton’s laws applies
only to our every-day level of physical existence. As we move away
from this, either towards the very small, where quantum theory
appears to be the best explanation of reality, or towards the very
large, where relativity theory appears to be the best explanation of
reality, our common-sense and logical constructions (such as main-
taining that a proposition and its opposite expression cannot both
be true—Aristotle’s Law of the Excluded Middle) become less and
less “true”. Even Aristotle’s laws of causality are called into question
by 20th century science. The Newtonian construction of reality falls
down and is replaced by a reality in which propositions and their
opposites can both be true; in which a thing can be in two opposite
states at once. If this is true in the realm of science as we move away

from the every-day physical world towards the very large and the very
small in the physical world, I would maintain that it is also true as
we move away from our everyday level of physical reality towards
spiritual reality. Here too, as mystics have been saying for centuries,
the laws of logic and our common-sense construction of reality break
down. As Bahá’u’lláh writes in the Seven Valleys:

> The story is told of a mystic knower, who went on a journey
> with a learned grammarian as his companion. They came to
> the shore of the Sea of Grandeur. The knower straightway
> flung himself into the waves, but the grammarian stood lost
> in his reasonings, which were as words that are written on
> water. The knower called out to him, “Why dost thou not
> follow?” The grammarian answered, “O Brother, I dare not
> advance. I must needs go back again.” Then the knower
> cried, “Forget what thou didst read in the books of Sibavayh
> and Qawlavayh, of Ibn‑i‑Hajib and Ibn‑i‑Malik, and cross
> the water.”

The death of self is needed here, not rhetoric:

Be nothing, then, and walk upon the waves.32

Kluge rejects the epistemological position of relativism that says “man,
not the object of knowledge, determines what is true or false about
what is perceived . . Ontologically, it is man who determines whether
something or some situation or state of affairs is or is not.” (p. 189)
But I would ask whether the following quotation from `Abdu’l-Baha
is not in fact an expression in relation to God of the position that
Kluge has rejected: “All the people have formed a god in the world
of thought, and that form of their imagination they worship.”33 As I
have commented above, `Abdu’l-Baha does not exclude Bahá’ís from
this. “All the people”, he says, determine for themselves what they
consider to be “true or false”.

Again Kluge rejects the relativist position that “you and I have dif-
ferent truths simply because we are different individuals with
different points of view.” (p. 190) But I would ask: is this not the clear
implication of `Abdu’l-Baha’s exposition of the Islamic Tradition “I
was a Hidden Treasure...”. In this exposition, `Abdu’l-Baha explains
that human beings do see reality differently because the various
names and attributes of God are manifested in each individual to
different degrees:

> For the world of humanity is the world of the perfection
> of the words. Thus it is that it has been said: “God created
> Adam in His image”; that is to say in the form of His Names
> and Attributes. However although he is the dawning-place
> of the manifestation of all the Names and Attributes, one of
> the Divine Names is manifested most strongly and appears
> most intensely [in each person]. Thus his being originates
> from this Name and returns to it. The summary of the mat-
> ter is that some of the saints of God, since they have seen
> the rays of the light of the Eternal Beauty with the eye of
> perpetuity in the heights of transcendence [tanzih] and the
> heaven of sanctity [taqdis] praise and sanctify the Essence
> of Absolute Unity above all of the stages [shu’unat] that per-
> tain to the world. For in the being of these heavenly figures,
> the Names of “Sanctity” and “Transcendence” have shone
> forth. And some of the knowers of the Hidden Secrets are
> the manifestations of the names “Divinity” and “Lordship”.
> Thus it is that in this station, they do not see the Lord of
> Lords without His subject creatures, nor the Creator with-
> out a Creation, nor the All-Knowing without an object of
> knowledge.

> And some of those who know the secrets of Primal Unity,
> although in their reality and innermost being one of the
> Divine Names is strongest yet in their being a reflection

> exists and a light is apparent of every Name of the Absolute
> and every Attribute of the Self-Sufficient One. For these, in
> the station of absolute transcendence and complete sanctity
> whereof it is said: “There was God and there was nothing
> besides Him”, see that Essence of Primal Unity as being
> pre-existent in both Essence and Attributes, free from the
> existence of objects of knowledge and from the realities
> of existent beings. In this station, they consider all except
> God to be absolute non-existence and complete nothing-
> ness. Thus it is that, in this station, they regard realities,
> existent beings and contingent beings as originated and do
> not consider anything as pre-existent except the Essence of
> the Absolute. In another station which is the station of the
> manifestation of the Name “All-Knowing” and the Names
> of “Divinity” and “Lordship”, the realities of things are
> considered to be pre-existent and knowledge dependent on
> objects of knowledge.34

Thus each individual sees reality differently in accordance with how
strongly each of the names of God is manifested within him or her.
For human beings, there is no Archimedean point for seeing reality
correctly in any absolute way. All that is available are the individual
understandings that each human being has. These understand-
ings should of course be based on our reading of the scriptures but
ultimately even our understanding of what we read is shaped by the
factors which `Abdu’l-Baha describes as the relative balance of the
expression of the different Names of God in each individual.

Some in whom “the Names of ‘Sanctity’ and ‘Transcendence’ have
shone forth” are more inclined to separate God from His creation,
to separate truth from error; theirs is an analytic mind that seeks
to separate and define precisely, a mind that does not tolerate
ambiguity and contradiction. They favour reductive, empiricist,
determinist or positivist approaches to constructing reality. This

frame of mind is favoured in the world of Newtonian science and
Aristotlean philosophy.

Others whom `Abdu’l-Baha describes as “the manifestations of
the names ‘Divinity’ and ‘Lordship’” are more inclined to see God
in relation to His creation; they look to truths that encompass all
positions and are more comfortable with ambiguity and contradic-
tions, considering these to be an inherent, inescapable part of the
human condition. They prize inclusiveness and synthetic, integrative
or holistic constructions of reality. This frame of mind is favoured
among mystics and many modern scientists.

Since this relative balance in the expression of the different Names
of God in each individual affects how we see reality, it will also affect
how we assess and determine what proofs and what evidence we
accept in this debate. Those in whom `Abdu’l-Baha says “the Names
of ‘Sanctity’ and ‘Transcendence’ have shone forth” will be more
strongly inclined to accept logical proofs and rational argumenta-
tion. Others whom `Abdu’l-Baha says are “the manifestations of the
names ‘Divinity’ and ‘Lordship’” will prize argumentation that is
holistic and inclusive. Thus the fact that Kluge sees Absolute Reality
in a dualist form and I see it in a relativist mode indicates nothing at
all about the Absolute Reality but does indicate something about the
difference in our two psyches. Perhaps this then is the “knowledge”
of our “own selves” that Bahá’u’lláh is referring to in his statement:

> Far, far from Thy glory be what mortal man can affirm of
> Thee, or attribute unto Thee, or the praise with which he can
> glorify Thee! Whatever duty Thou hast prescribed unto Thy
> servants of extolling to the utmost Thy majesty and glory is
> but a token of Thy grace unto them, that they may be enabled
> to ascend unto the station conferred upon their own inmost
> being, the station of the knowledge of their own selves.35

4: The Relativism of the Debate

Finally, I would like to make a more general point about what is going
on in this debate, a point that is in many ways much more important
that any specific detailed comments. If we look at Kluge’s response we
find the following points within it:

> It is philosophical, and deals with truth as defined within a
> particular sphere of philosophy that favours logical, analytical
> argument. It has not responded to any of the quotations that I
> have given in my argument.

Similarly, if you examine my line of argument you will find that:

> It is based on scripture and is principally theological in its
> argument. It deals with truth in a holistic and synthetic man-
> ner. Kluge will no doubt think that it has not dealt adequately
> with the specifically philosophical points in his argument.

What we have here then are two different conceptual worlds each
perfectly self-consistent and understandable within itself but coming
to different conclusions, using different criteria for what will count
as evidence and what will count as decisive proof. In other worlds
we have two universes of discourse, two paradigms, two realities or,
to use a phrase from the philosopher Wittgenstein, two different
language games.

Each universe of discourse is complete within itself and each seems
consistent with reality and with the Bahá’í scriptures as long as one
remains within it. While reading Kluge’s paper all of his arguments
are perfectly consistent and convincing. I would hope that the reader
finds that my arguments are also consistent and convincing.

This picture that I have drawn of what his happening in the debate
between myself and Kluge is in a way a much more powerful argu-
ment for the truth of the position of relativism that any of the
detailed arguments I have made above. It demonstrates the reality
of the human position. We are all trapped inside realities that we
human beings have created communally, in this case, one a reality
created within the world of philosophy and another created within a
more theological setting. Although these realities are created by us,
we lose sight of this fact and thin of them as reality itself. We think
that this is how things actually are whereas in fact they are just the
reality that we have constructed. As long as we remain within one
reality, the picture that it draws is consistent and believable. We, as
human beings, have no way of standing outside of these constructions
of reality and judging what is absolute truth. We only have access to
our visions of truth that are limited and contingent.

Conclusion

In brief then, the position that I think is closest to what the Bahá’í
scriptures say is one that is built up along the following lines:

1. Human beings because of the limited nature of their

> minds can have no knowledge of the Absolute Reality,
> God (no “Archimedean point” for understanding). The
> most we can say is an affirmation of belief that He/She/It
> exists. This inability of human minds to have knowledge
> of God extends to the rest of the metaphysical realm, since
> Bahá’u’lláh asserts that we cannot even have knowledge of
> that aspect of the metaphysical realm that is closest to us,
> our own souls.

2. All that human beings have knowledge of are the Names

and Attributes of God.

3\. These Names and Attributes are most perfectly mani-

> fested in the Manifestations of God, the founders of the
> world religions, They are humanity’s point of contact
> with the Absolute. They have a privileged, Archimedean
> standpoint, Therefore it is to the person and writings of
> these Manifestations that we must turn to obtain the
> best knowledge.

4\. But we, as human beings are two stages away from being

> able to understand that Archimedean point. The first stage
> of remove is that, although the Manifestation has access to
> the Absolute Truth, He is limited in what He can bring to
> us of Absolute Reality. He is confined by the limitations of
> human understanding, of human language and of the stage
> of development that humanity has reached. Thus although
> in theory, He could bring us Absolute Truth, in practice he
> only brings us a truth that is compatible with and relative
> to human limitations and our stage of development. And
> so although He is able to make pronouncements that are
> normative for all of humankind, these are not statements
> of Absolute Truth but statements that are what we are able
> to understand of that truth at our stage of development.

5\. The second stage of remove from Absolute Truth is that we,

> as human beings have no direct access to the mind of the
> Manifestation; we can only study the scriptures that the
> Manifestation brings and form our own understandings of
> God and of the spiritual world. But these understandings
> will be shaped by the limitations imposed upon us by our
> individual cultural and educational background and our
> own personal life history. They will be limited, partial or
> relative truths. Others from a different culture and life
> history will understand what they read in the same scrip-
> tures differently and will form their own understandings

> of God, His attributes and of the spiritual world. The
> teachings of the Manifestation do give certain social and
> moral teachings and laws. Humanity must act on these
> as though they are absolutes until the coming of a future
> Manifestation of God, but in fact even these are relative
> truths and a future Manifestation may change these in
> ways that we cannot anticipate. Only a Manifestation of
> God, however, has the authority to change these social and
> moral laws and teachings or to interpret them in anything
> other than their obvious sense.

I would maintain that the pathway taken by Kluge is the one that
Western thought has always traditionally taken and which necessarily
results in one approach being triumphant over all other approaches. In
this line of thought, there can only be one correct exposition of truth
and only one understanding of reality. One result of this approach
historically has been the neo-colonialism that seeks to impose one
conceptual world (that of the West that is based on these philosophical
concepts) on the rest of the world. The approach that I am suggesting
in this paper enables Bahá’ís to explore the truths within the Bahá’í
Faith from many different perspectives without prejudging what is the
correct understanding of the Bahá’í scriptures. Humanity has a rich
history of spiritual traditions stretching back thousands of years. Over
time, these traditions have developed different ways of looking at the
world. The approach that I am putting forward here enables Bahá’ís
to explore this rich spiritual history and see what light these different
approaches throw on the Bahá’í scriptures and what is in them about
God and the spiritual world (the realm of metaphysics). The Bahá’í
scriptures are full of gems but, I would maintain, that we will not suc-
ceed in discovering all of those gems if we restrict ourselves to looking
with just the conceptual world of the Western philosophical tradi-
tion. We need to harness all of the world’s spiritual and philosophical
traditions if we are to succeed in finding all of these gems.
