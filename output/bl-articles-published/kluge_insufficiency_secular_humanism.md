The Insufficiency of Secular Humanism

Ian Kluge

Theme

The argument of this paper is that secular humanism’s
inability to accommodate the empirically established universal
presence of religion in human nature undermines secular
humanism’s claim to be a viable world-view for mankind. This
failure to live up to its self-proclaimed empiricism unleashes a
cascade of consequences that undermines its internal coherence,
diminishes its value as a rational argument and leaves the
arguments for theism untouched.

Part 1: Humanism and Secular Humanism

Perhaps the best and shortest definition of ‘humanism’ in
general is offered by philosopher Corliss Lamont, whose
Philosophy of Humanism states that humanism is “a philosophy
of which man is the center and the sanction.”1 All branches of
humanism are concerned with the dignity and worth of
humanity as a whole and each individual. They all emphasize
human existence in the natural world and in man as a ‘natural’
being; they place enormous value on the power of reason and
critical analysis; and they all stress free will and the power of
the individual to shape him or herself by their choices.

In general, there are two major types of humanism — theist
and non-theist. Theist humanism holds that it is essential to

50                                           Lights of Irfán vol. 16

acknowledge the existence of a Transcendent ‘being’ that is
absolutely independent from all knowable phenomena. The
reason is that no description of human life is complete or
accurate without reference to the Transcendent which may be a
personal being or a non-personal process such as ‘independent
origination’ in Buddhism, the Tao, Schopenhauer’s Will or
Tillich’s ‘ground of being.’ Humanity is both physical and
spiritual. In the contemporary West, theist humanism in its
Christian form is best represented by Jacques Maritain’s
“integral humanism.”2 However, there are forms of theistic
humanism which are not associated with any particular religion.
Karl Jasper’s existential philosophy is among them. According
to Jaspers, humans are always aware of something beyond
themselves and beyond nature because of their contingency and
their recognition that “man cannot be comprehended on the
basis of himself.”3 In other words, man’s existence cannot be
explained and understood strictly on the basis of human
existence. Jaspers calls this unknown which is both immanent
and beyond us ‘Transcendence’ when he wants to emphasize its
ontological ‘distance’ from us and as the “Encompassing”4 to
emphasize how it encloses us.

In this paper, our focus is ‘secular humanism’ or SH. Its
starting point is the rejection of any form of transcendent i.e.
supernatural being, in short, atheism. As Thomas Flynn states
for secular humanists, “humanism begins with rejecting the
transcendent as such.”5 From the denial of the transcendent, it
follows that the unaided human intellect, the ‘rational faculty’
as it is often called, is the most capable guide that we can
follow throughout life.”6 There is nothing else but reason to
rely on — and the efforts to deceive ourselves about this
situation only serve to hurt humankind and hinder its progress.
Religion is basically a product of ignorance about the workings
of the world and fear of death. Both of these can be overcome
by following the methods of rational science and by adopting
new attitudes towards human life.

Secular Humanism                                              51

SH exists in various forms but all share the absolute
rejection of transcendence though the reasons for that
rejection may differ. For example, Sartre’s existentialist
humanism7 bases its rejection on ethical grounds. If there were
a God, there could be no freedom and without freedom of
choice there can be no ethics. Even if God existed, we humans
must defy him in order to be free.8 This principle is based on
Sartre’s belief that “existence precedes essence,”9 i.e. that the
individual makes or ‘shapes’ himself through his choices and
that there is no human nature given to us ready-made by God.
On the other hand, Marxist humanism — based on Marx’s
economic and philosophic manuscripts of 1844 — rejects God
because God’s existence alienates man from himself by
estranging him from his positive attributes and above all, from
his work. Another example of SH is “democratic humanism”
which is based largely on the work of American philosopher
John Dewey who combined his belief in religious evolution, the
scientific method and his faith in American democracy to add a
uniquely American flavor to humanist thought.

Although the term ‘secular humanism’ originated in the
1930’s the roots of SH go back to ancient Greece. A number of
the pre-Socratic philosophers such as Thales, Democritus,
Protagoras and Heraclitus endeavored to explain the natural
world in terms of natural causes and not as results of divine
action. Thales, for example, tried to explain all natural
phenomena as permutations of a single substance — water —
and even outlined a basic theory of evolution. In short, these
philosophers sought natural not supernatural explanations for
the world around them. In more recent times, the growth of SH
also received a strong intellectual impetus from Ludwig
Feuerbach (d. 1872) who taught that the idea of God was a
chimera, a projection of humanity’s own attributes into a non-
existent super-natural realm. In short, God is a magnification
of humankind. Nietzsche re-enforced Feuerbach’s teaching by
proclaiming that God is dead.10 Nietzsche also strengthened the
naturalistic basis of SH by insisting that we must live and think

52                                             Lights of Irfán vol. 16

entirely within the limits of the natural world and that any
reliance on the super-natural was nothing less than betrayal of
ourselves.

In 1933, The Humanist Manifesto I listed ten major
principles of SH. Among them are the foundational SH
principles that
1. There is no God or any other supernatural being. The

universe is “self-existing and not created.”11
2. Man is part of “organic nature” and the body/mind or

body/spirit dualism must be rejected.
3. “Humanism asserts that the nature of the universe

> depicted by modern science makes unacceptable any
> supernatural or cosmic guarantees of human values.”12
4. “Religious Humanism considers the complete realization

> of human personality to be the end of man’s life and
> seeks its development and fulfillment in the here and
> now. This is the explanation of the humanist’s social
> passion.”13
5. There are “no uniquely religious emotions and attitudes

> of the kind hitherto associated with belief in the
> supernatural.”14
6. In the place of the old attitudes involved in worship and

> prayer the humanist finds his religious emotions
> expressed in a heightened sense of personal life and in a
> cooperative effort to promote social well-being.15

In 1949, philosopher Corliss Lamont re-iterated these points
and clarified several features:
1. Humanism, having its ultimate faith in man, believes

> that human beings possess the power or potentiality of
> solving their own problems through reason and the
> application of the scientific method.
Secular Humanism                                                53

2. Notwithstanding arguments from science or religious

> doctrines of fatalism, human beings possess free will
> within certain physical limits.
3. Humanism believes in an ethics or morality that grounds

all human values in this-earthly experience.
4. Humanism      believes   in    the    complete       social

> implementation of reason and scientific method with
> “Full freedom of expression and civil liberties.”16
In 1973, well-known SH philosopher Paul Kurtz published
The Humanist Manifesto II. This document strikes a more
charitable chord than its predecessor insofar as Kurtz
recognizes that religion has some positive aspects. However, he
re-affirms the foundational principles of the first Humanist
Manifesto and Lamont’s text by asserting that theism does “a
disservice to the human species.”17 He says,

> In the best sense, religion may inspire dedication to the
> highest ethical ideals. The cultivation of moral devotion
> and creative imagination is an expression of genuine
> “spiritual” experience and aspiration. We believe,
> however, that traditional dogmatic or authoritarian
> religions that place revelation, God, ritual, or creed
> above human needs and experience do a disservice to the
> human species. Any account of nature should pass the
> tests of scientific evidence; in our judgment, the dogmas
> and myths of traditional religions do not do so.18

Furthermore, Kurtz rigorously emphasizes that ethics do not
depend on religion or a belief in the Transcendent.

> We affirm that moral values derive their source from
> human experience. Ethics is autonomous and situational
> needing no theological or ideological sanction. Ethics
> stems from human need and interest.19
54                                               Lights of Irfán vol. 16

In the last analysis, “Reason and intelligence are the most
effective instruments that humankind possesses”20 because these
alone can serve our interests and needs.

In recent years, SH has been supported by the movement
known as the New Atheism. However, it must be made clear
that while all secular humanists are atheists not all new or old
atheists are necessarily humanists. Marxists, for example, are
not necessarily humanists even though they are atheists. The
same may be said of Sartrean existentialists. The New Atheists
have assisted SH by providing sharply worded critiques of
belief in God and of ethics and social theory based on
revelation as well as with arguments for the supremacy of
reason and science in human decision making.

Part 2: Procrustes’ Bed

Procrustes was an evil blacksmith and bandit in ancient
Greece who gained a horrible reputation for a bed he invented.
It was truly a ‘one size fits all’ affair. If you were too short, the
bed functioned as a rack which stretched you until you fit the
bed. If you were too tall, the bed worked as a chopping block
and cut enough off your feet and legs to make you fit. The
Greek hero Theseus ended Procrustes’ reign of terror by giving
him a night in his own bed.

The central thesis of this essay is that SH is a Procrustes’
bed. On one hand, it amputates whatever aspects of human
nature don’t fit its theory of man and on the other, it
unreasonably stretches the use of certain terms and concepts to
make up for the deficiencies caused by its amputations! Our
conclusion is, therefore, simple: SH’s view of humanity is not
true to its subject –humanity — and is, therefore, inadequate in
its world-view, in its understanding of mankind and as a guide
for the future.

Because SH is based on the rejection of all forms of belief in
the supernatural and the Transcendent21 it has insurmountable

Secular Humanism                                                55

difficulties in dealing with the global prevalence of religion
both in the past and in the present. As one puzzled author
states, “still, one wonders about the near-universality of the
human experiences and feelings that are called “spiritual.”22 The
best that SH can say is that whatever may have been good in the
past, religion is now a worthless and dangerous relic from
history. The problem here is obvious. The SH view is totally in
conflict with human nature as empirical scientific and historical
studies have found it. SH overlooks the full significance of the
empirical fact that religion is universal. We have never
encountered either directly or through historical records any
society that lacks religion or in which religion does not play a
major part in a society’s world-view, social organization, ethics
or law. This universality is irrefutable empirical evidence that
religiosity is an intrinsic attribute of human nature and that as
an intrinsic i.e. essential attribute, it cannot be removed
whether by education or intellectual dismissal or amputation.
Because it is an intrinsic part of human nature, religiosity
returns even when it is suppressed. As we shall see below, like
Freud’s famous “return of the repressed” or the famous cat who
came back when they thought it was a ‘goner,’ humanity’s
religious nature will always find ways to express itself. One of
my philosophy professors used to say, “When you kick God out
the front door, He comes in through the back window.”

More precisely, the universality of religion means that in one
way or another, all peoples share the same fundamental
ontology, i.e. theory of reality. In the most general terms,
reality has at least two aspects, the phenomenal/material world
and another, unseen reality whose presence is known by the
existence of contingent beings. This identical foundation
illustrates the Bahá’í teaching that “So shall we see the truth in
all religions, for truth is in all and truth is one!” [PT 137] They
start from the same ontological principle but, with the guidance
of the Manifestations, they develop the consequences
differently according to place, time and local conditions.

56                                             Lights of Irfán vol. 16

This universal foundation means that as far as humanity in
general is concerned, nature is more than just material stuff. It
is more than just what we can apprehend with our physical
senses and we are more than just our physical bodies. ‘Behind,’
‘beneath’ and/or ‘beyond’ phenomenal reality, there is a non-
physical source or ‘ground of being’ that we perceive. As the
Bahá Writings say, “The signs of God shine as manifest as the
sun amidst the work of His creatures.” [GWB 143] How we
experience this unknowable entity or process ‘beneath’ the
physical and what it means varies from culture to culture over
time, but the principle is essentially the same everywhere.

We should add that contrary to the SH view that belief in a
super-natural ground of being is irrational, this belief is
exceedingly rational and reflects the scientific method. It
moves from empirical evidence i.e. the contingency of all
known things and the need for all contingent things to have a
cause and applies it to the phenomenal world. In other words, a
universal empirical observation leads to a conclusion about
phenomenal reality in general, namely, like all other things the
phenomenal world needs a cause. Implicit in this conclusion is
the understanding that whatever is the first cause or “Prime
Mover” [PM 262] cannot be like all other phenomenal beings
and, therefore, does need a cause need to be caused by anything
else. That is why God is the “Prime” Mover. The question,
“Who created God?” — often regarded by non-theists as a
definitive retort — results from a failure to understand the
difference between phenomenal or material reality and non-
phenomenal and non-material. In short, the question
exemplifies a logical category mistake.

Experientially, people intuit that there is more to reality than
what meets the senses and this ‘more’ is endless. Existentialist
philosopher Karl Jaspers refers to this ‘more’ of which people
are aware as “the Encompassing”23 which forms our horizon but
always “indicates something further which again surrounds the
given horizon.”24 This endlessly expanding series of horizons —
like boxes in a nested hierarchy — which begins with us in our

Secular Humanism                                                57

own personal concrete situations “announces the presence of
being”25 which is never directly encountered as a particular
thing (like a butterfly or a horseshoe) but whose presence is
always known through all things, situations and perspectives. It
is like the mysterious self in Hume’s philosophy: we cannot
identify ‘the self’ as a particular item in our stream of
consciousness, but it is implicitly present in our consciousness
of the stream itself.26 Our natural and inescapable awareness of
the Encompassing is what Jaspers means by the orientation to
Transcendence, an orientation to something that is behind or
beyond all natural phenomena. This orientation is the basis of
all religion, i.e. the sense that there is something ‘beyond’ what
appears to us is one of the things all religions and spiritualities
have in common. It is the ontological basis of Bahá’u’lláh’s
teaching of the essential one-ness of all religions because all
other forms of religion and all specific teachings are ultimately
based on this intuition of the Encompassing and the orientation
to Transcendence. As Abdu’l-Bahá says,

> Bahá’u’lláh promulgated the fundamental oneness of
> religion. He taught that reality is one and not multiple,
> that it underlies all divine precepts and that the
> foundations of the religions are, therefore, the same.
> Certain forms and imitations have gradually arisen. [PUP
> 175]

In other words, religion grows from the intuition of the reality
beyond the phenomenal realm.

Humanity’s inherent orientation to Transcendence is so
strong that even societies adopting a militant atheist world-
view cannot escape it. Marxism provides a good example.
Shoghi Effendi describes it as a “religious irreligion.”27 The core
of Marxist ontology is the concept of dialectical materialism
which provides the ultimate justification for all other Marxist
teachings. It is the foundation principle of Marxism and asserts
that all phenomena including mind and thought are the
products of the inter-actional or dialectical processes of

58                                             Lights of Irfán vol. 16

matter. This process is reality itself and the other process
described in historical materialism i.e. the history of mankind
and the economic and cultural superstructures are ‘add-ons.’
These add-ons include religion, social organization,
government, law and art among other things.

It is not difficult to see that the process of dialectical
materialism corresponds to Jaspers’ “Encompassing” and
requires an orientation to Transcendence. The process is, in
effect, super-natural. It has four characteristics not found in
any other phenomena: (1) it is not limited in space, i.e. not
particularized and is ubiquitous; (2) it is not limited by time the
way all other phenomena are; (3) it is not dependent on the
existence of any other particular thing for its own existence;
and (4) it has logical priority over all phenomena, i.e. we cannot
think of any phenomena without implicitly pre-supposing the
existence of the dialectical process. Nothing else in nature
exists in this unique way — which, in effect, means the
dialectical materialist process is super-natural, i.e. beyond
nature. It encompasses everything and, therefore, transcends
everything. This shows how difficult it is to rid human thought
of the Encompassing and the orientation to Transcendence —
and this difficulty opens up the real possibility that this
orientation is a response to something real. It does not, of
course, prove that such a super-natural being i.e. God exists,
but it does leave that possibility as a rational option.

Given the implicit metaphysical implications of dialectical
materialism, it should be no surprise that after his 1920 visit to
Lenin in the Soviet Union such an astute observer as Bertrand
Russell said, “Bolshevism is not merely a political doctrine; it is
also a religion, with elaborate dogmas and inspired
scriptures.”28 In A History of Western Philosophy, he lists
structural similarities between the structure of Marxism and
Christianity.29

Since all other Communist regimes have much the theoretical
principles and structure, Russell’s remark about the religious

nature of Soviet Communism applies to them as well. Given
Communism’s implicit orientation to Transcendence, it is not
surprising that even after seventy years of systematic atheist
indoctrination a sudden resurgence of religion occurs in Russia
and Eastern Europe. Furthermore, the persistent Chinese
interest in religion despite decades of repression shows how
deeply engrained this orientation is.

However, Marxism is not the only example of “religious
irreligion” as we observe in the pervasiveness of Ersatz or
substitute religion. They preserve the orientation to
Transcendence and even a feeling of the Encompassing. We can
observe this development in the incredible popularity of films,
novels, TV series and comics that are based on the supernatural.
Churches are emptying because more people find it easier to
offer “willing suspension of disbelief”30 to unconventional
forms of the supernatural than to God. Given the popularity of
entertainment about demonic possession and forces from hell it
seems many people find it easier to believe in the devil than
God. At the very least, they find it easier and/or more
meaningful to ‘play’ imaginatively with devils, witches,
werewolves, supermen with unearthly powers and magic than to
play imaginatively with saints, miracles and appearances of the
divine in the form of Manifestations. Perhaps the most obvious
example of this is the incredible popularity of the Harry Potter
books and films and all their imitators. In addition there are
those books that move in a gothic direction and even somewhat
satanic direction as seen in the Twilight series and its imitators
as well as in the vampire series by Anne Rice. In the popularity
of this literature of the supernatural we can still plainly discern
the orientation to Transcendence at work, i.e. the sense or
intuition that there is something else beyond, in or behind
reality although in this ersatz form, the ‘beyond’ evokes fear
rather than hope, inspiration and comfort. Moreover, the
‘encompassing’ aspect of the transcendent dimension
exacerbates our fears. Negative as these entertainments might
be, attraction to such phenomena is clearly an orientation to

60                                           Lights of Irfán vol. 16

Transcendence, i.e. to something beyond the natural world.
This orientation has not been eradicated by the modern
scientific-materialist mindset but has simply changed its form
of expression.

The orientation to Transcendence is also evident in the large
numbers who describe themselves as ‘spiritual’ as distinct from
‘religious’ in an institutional sense. Such orientations can run
the gamut from a deep and profoundly moving appreciation of
natural beauty to the pursuits of New Age wisdom vis-a-vis
tarot cards, crystals, chanting and other spiritual practices.
Among women in particular we observe the resurrection of
Wicca which tends to seek the Transcendent below, in
mysterious earth-powers, than in what they would call ‘sky-
powers.’

Given the evidence presented above, it is difficult to resist
the conclusion that the orientation to Transcendence — the
basis of all religion — is far more widespread and far more
difficult to escape than we think. What conclusions may we
draw from all this? The universality of the orientation to
Transcendence and the Encompassing clearly says that it is an
essential attribute of humanity which cannot be eliminated — or
amputated — without denying human nature as such. It is not
an accidental attribute such as skin or hair color, education
level or wealth which can be removed or changed without
changing our fundamental identity as human beings. In other
words, the secular humanist goal of removing or amputating
the orientation to Transcendence seems highly unlikely to be
realized.

The Bahá’í Writings refer to the orientation to
Transcendence in two ways. We see such a reference in Abdu’l-
Bahá’s statement that man has

> two natures; his spiritual or higher nature and his
> material or lower nature. In one he approaches God, in

> the other he lives for the world alone. Signs of both
> these natures are to be found in men. [PT 60]

Our “spiritual or higher nature” is oriented to God or
Transcendence, i.e. oriented to ‘something’ beyond the
phenomenal world. If this spiritual nature were lacking, we
would be entirely enclosed within our material limits like
animals which are “utterly lacking spiritual susceptibilities,
ignorant of divine religion and without knowledge of the
Kingdom of God.” [PUP 177] These “spiritual susceptibilities”
are the second way in which we are oriented to Transcendence.
He adds, “In the human kingdom spiritual susceptibilities come
into view, love exercises its superlative degree, and this is the
cause of human life.” [PUP 268] In other words, what
distinguishes humanity from animals is that humans have
“susceptibilities” i.e. a capacity for perceiving the spiritual
aspects of reality and a corresponding orientation to
Transcendence. These “susceptibilities” make us aware that
there is more to reality than the physical appearances that we
can perceive or that science can measure. However, this is not
to say that in the Bahá’í view we ought to neglect our physical
nature — only that it should be under the control of our
spiritual selves. He reminds us that “in the Cause of Bahá’u’lláh
monasticism and asceticism are not sanctioned.” [PUP 186] The
challenge for man is to make sure “his spiritual being and
intelligence man dominates and controls nature, the ruler of his
physical being.” [PUP 81]

In light of the foregoing discussion, it is reasonable to
conclude that SH simply does not present human beings as
given by the empirical evidence both from the past and the
present. By ignoring religion altogether, by diminishing its
importance or by attacking it as outmoded, useless and/or
dangerous, SH shows its inability to deal with humanity as we
find it. Its understanding of humankind is correspondingly
distorted and consequently its value as guidance for humanity is

62                                            Lights of Irfán vol. 16

limited. As we shall see below, some SH writers seem to be
aware of this problem and explore ways of remedying it.

Once this problem is recognized, another one arises. If SH
cannot deal with the empirically verified religiosity of mankind,
what happens to SH’s claim of being strictly guided by
empirical science and reason? Obviously it cannot stand. And if
that foundational claim is undermined, how strong is SH’s
commitment to other aspects of its program such as a rational
and scientifically based ethics and morality? This logical self-
contradiction seriously undermines its foundations and, by
extension, the credibility of many of its claims as a superior
world-view.

Indeed, these considerations revive an important ontological
question that undermines the SH project: if the orientation to
Transcendence and the Encompassing is universal, could it be
that this orientation corresponds to something real — just as
the eyes respond to the reality of light even though they cannot
see light itself? Since this orientation has survived such
momentous vicissitudes throughout its evolutionary existence,
it must have served humanity’s interests in surviving and
thriving. But how can it serve our survival interests if it is
completely delusional, utterly devoid of any relationship to
something real, and confusing to human thought and
understanding, if it needlessly drains our mental energies for
nothing? While these questions cannot prove that God or the
Transcendent exists, they are sufficient to put the issue of
God’s existence back on the table. Perhaps this is why Greg
Epstein does not try to disprove the existence of God but
argues that the concept of God is merely a “spandrel.”31 A
spandrel is “a phenotypic characteristic that is a byproduct of
the evolution of some other characteristic, rather than a direct
product of adaptive selection”32 This is implausible to say the
least. A universal phenomenon that consumes an enormous
amount of human physical and psychological energy and
resources cannot rationally be dismissed as an inessential “by-
product” of evolution. Such a Procrustean understanding of

religion illustrates the SH method of diminishing human nature
to fit the SH world-view.

Part 3: Why do Humans Need the Transcendent?

One of the key questions we must ask is how the orientation
to Transcendence and the intuition of the Encompassing affects
humanity. Does it make any difference if this orientation is
lacking, or, conversely, what positive value does the orientation
to Transcendence have in human lives? In this section we shall
explore some of the ways in which our lives are shaped by this
orientation and the awareness of the Encompassing.

In our view, the presence or absence of the orientation to
Transcendence has a profound effect on our understanding of
the nature of reality; on our self-understanding and self-
evaluation as human beings; on the purpose and meanings of
our lives; and on our ethics or legal systems. Whether this
transcendent entity is recognized as the Tao, or a personal God,
or a form of pantheism or panentheisim or the process of
independent arising makes no difference: the principle of
transcendence remains an essential part of understanding the
world and everything in it. No aspect of human existence is left
unaffected. We can verify this for ourselves by studying the
world-views of all cultures, their ethics and legal systems as well
as their art, stories and poetry and social structures.

On the SH view, existence has one — material — dimension
and there is absolutely no entity, will, process or authority to
direct our affairs except our own, either individually or
collectively. There is no other, super-natural will whose wishes
we must take into account. However, on the religious view,
existence is at least two dimensional — material and non-
material or spiritual — and there exists some kind of entity,
process or ground of being which has a will or nature or
authority which we must take into consideration. Our affairs
are not entirely in our own hands, starting with the human
nature with which we have been endowed. Contrary to Sartre,

64                                            Lights of Irfán vol. 16

this does not mean that we are completely pre-determined since
the choice to struggle against our human nature or work with it
is a matter of free will. As Abdu’l-Bahá says,

> Some things are subject to the free will of man, such as
> justice, equity, tyranny and injustice, in other words,
> good and evil actions; it is evident and clear that these
> actions are, for the most part, left to the will of man.

[SAQ 248]

The SH view is a form of reductionism i.e. the viewpoint
that everything about human beings can, in the last analysis, be
reduced to physical and bio-chemical processes and that these
physical processes completely describe human nature. If we
reject the intuition of the Encompassing and the orientation to
Transcendence, we shall be forced to understand ourselves
completely as material beings subject to all the laws and
limitations to which matter is subject. We have to understand
ourselves as nothing more than bio-chemical processes In our
times, this requires us to accept a scientific understanding of
the world and of ourselves — which leaves no room for the
existence of a soul, of free will, life after death or even
objective morals. In this one-dimensional life-world everything
about us can — at least in principle — be explained in
measurable material and physical terms. Even mind and thought
are reduced to and fully explained by brain function. The
contemporary term for this conflation of brain and mind is
“identification theory.”33 Consequently, we would agree with
Pierre Cabanis that “The brain secretes thought like the liver
secretes bile.”34 The fact that we possess consciousness or, as
Pascal points out, that we are a “thinking reed”35 does not
endow us with any special value if thoughts are mere physical
secretions or bio-chemical reactions in the brain. On the SH
view, we are clearly trapped in an ontological, one-level
flatland from which there is no escape. This leads to a number
of problems that highlight the insufficiency of SH in meeting
the needs of humankind.

The problem is that human beings do not experience or
understand themselves as mere physical processes — and resist
doing so. That does not prove that humans are nothing but
chemistry but it does show how SH is out of touch and
insufficient to explain why humans instinctively cling to
concepts like ‘self’ or ‘soul’ and find them necessary to
function successfully. It is difficult to build a successful world-
view as SH is trying to do when it denies (1) the universality of
religion and (2) the way people universally experience
themselves as more than material and as having free will. SH
simply does not practice empiricism consistently. The following
thought experiment demonstrates that we do not experience
ourselves as purely material beings. If I had a super-computer
that could tell you everything about your current condition, i.e.
physical;, emotion, intellectual etc. would you agree that the
resulting print-out “is you”? If the super-computer added all the
information about your past history and even family history,
would the print-out “be you”? If we added all the emotions,
fleeting thoughts, dreams, shameful secrets etc. would the
resulting print-out “be you” or sum you up? In over thirty years
of teaching I have never encountered a single person who would
seriously accept a computer-print out of any size as being him
or her. Here, too, we see — as Hume did — that the self cannot
be reduced to or identified with all the data we can collect but
remains stubbornly mysterious and irreducible. The self is
more, and most, if not all, humans intuit this quite readily. Any
philosophy — such as SH — which undermines or denies i.e. in
effect amputates this understanding of ourselves as being more
than empirical data is inevitably an insufficient view of human
nature.

Another aspect of human nature that must be amputated in
SH’s Procrustes’ Bed is the sense of the intrinsic value of
humankind. On the basis of its own adherence to the scientific
method and principles, SH cannot avoid the conclusion that as
mere bio-chemical processes among all the others, humanity has
no intrinsic value. Indeed, nothing and no one has because,

66                                            Lights of Irfán vol. 16

from a scientific perspective, matter itself does not have
intrinsic value which can be objectively proven. If there is no
such intrinsic value in human beings, then it follows that any
claims about human value are external attributions — or if wish
— rabbits pulled out of a hat. They are conventions which can
be unmade as easily as made; they are not inherently necessary
and essential. In the end, it is simply a matter of external
circumstances and the accidents of history.

A consciousness informed by the knowledge that it has no
intrinsic value and what whatever value it has is a mere social
convention is substantially different than a consciousness
informed of by a sense of intrinsic value based on a
Transcendent entity, or by the will of God. The consciousness
informed by knowledge of its connection to the Transcendent
also has a sense of the ‘ontological rightness’ of its existence.
Ontological rightness means that our intrinsic value is not
merely an externally attached attribute from man-made
conventions but is ontologically grounded in ‘something’ that is
independent of time, space and matter and which “announces
the presence of being”36 in every particular thing. Each one of
us is linked with the independent and eternal ground of being
and that gives our existence an undeniable legitimacy and value.
In religious terms, we are ‘necessary’ in a deep ontological sense
because “God loves all”. [PUP 267] What God chooses to love
cannot be worthless or existentially illegitimate. The Bahá’í
Writings express this in the following statement from
Bahá’u’lláh:

> Whatever is in the heavens and whatever is on the earth
> is a direct evidence of the revelation within it of the
> attributes and names of God, inasmuch as within every
> atom are enshrined the signs that bear eloquent
> testimony to the revelation of that Most Great Light.

[GWB 177]

The basis of our being and our ontological rightness and
intrinsic value as creations of God could not be more clearly

established. Abdu’l-Bahá describes humanity as the
“consummation of this limitless universe with all its grandeur
and glory hath been man himself.” [TAF 13] There is no question
of intrinsic value and ontological rightness here, not of dignity,
and even cosmological importance:

> For the noblest part of the tree is the fruit, which is the
> reason of its existence. If the tree had no fruit, it would
> have no meaning. Therefore, it cannot be imagined that
> the worlds of existence, whether the stars or this earth,
> were once inhabited by the donkey, cow, mouse and cat,
> and that they were without man! This supposition is
> false and meaningless. [SAQ 196]

Humanity’s intrinsic value and ontological rightness could
not be established more clearly. The ontological rightness of
human kind is based on our necessary, our essential place and
role in the order of creation. The tree exists to produce fruit
and thereby the fruit justifies the existence and struggles of the
tree. Abdu’l-Bahá’s metaphor tells us that humans are “the
reason of [the universe’s] existence” as the culmination and
highest expression of the powers inherent in the universe. That
is why he states,

> Man is the microcosm; and the infinite universe, the
> macrocosm. The mysteries of the greater world, or
> macrocosm, are expressed or revealed in the lesser
> world, the microcosm. [PUP 69]

However, there is another way in which consciousness
informed by a sense of ontological rightness and intrinsic value
differs from a consciousness informed by ideas about man-
made conventions as the basis of its value. This concerns what
psychologist Eric Erikson calls “basic trust” which is necessary
for the complete and healthy development of any human being.
In the individual, basic trust is primarily developed in
relationship to the mother; to one degree or another, this trust
— or lack of it — forms the basis of our relationship to the

68                                            Lights of Irfán vol. 16

world and our world-view which shapes our thoughts and
actions. For example, our basic existential stance towards
reality could be fearful, suspicious, trusting, appreciative or
grateful or even mixtures of these. In our view this happens at
the collective level as well. A world-view asserting that man is a
by-product and chance-development of a fortuitous cosmic
process without any purpose or meaning and likely to end in a
universal ‘heat death’ or a ‘big crunch’ is unlikely to inform a
sense of basic trust in the cosmos and in humanity and
existence in general. Such a world-view is far more likely to
generate a sense of cosmic mistrust or even despair which in
turn undermines the sense of ontological rightness and
mankind’s intrinsic value, dignity and importance. These values
may be asserted by man-made philosophies such as SH but in a
universe in which everything exists as a result of chance and has
no guiding purpose, such assertions inevitably sound hollow
and cannot inspire enduring trust. They sound an awful lot like
whistling in the dark.

Furthermore, there is nothing in the SH philosophy that
actually addresses this vital issue of ontological confidence. In
other words, SH cannot inspire the ontological confidence in
ourselves or in our species that is at least possible in world-
views that possess an orientation to Transcendence and an
intuition of the Encompassing. The inner conceptual resources
are simply not there to do so; there is no basis from which to
develop such basic trust and ontological confidence. This
cannot help but undermine our view of humanity itself. Why
should one bio-chemical process be intrinsically superior to any
other? Does it matter more if a person or a tree dies? It is not
difficult to see how materialist answers to such questions could
lead to the de-valuing of mankind and denial of its intrinsic
value or cosmic purpose. Of course, SH does not overtly hold
such a minimalist or even depressing view of humankind — nor
does it intend to. Indeed, quite the opposite: it strives to
develop a positive outlook on humanity. The problem is that it
undermines its own optimism because its conceptual

framework — especially its uncritical view of science — brings
these questions to the fore and fails to answer them adequately,
i.e. logically on the basis of its own conceptual framework.

Let us examine more closely why SH’s conceptual framework
undermines its overtly stated optimism. If human beings have
no intrinsic value, then the very foundations of all ethical
systems has been removed. After all, the whole point of
establishing rules by which to treat people in certain ways is
that humans have some intrinsic value that must be respected
and preserved. If we try to find our values by turning to nature
or the scientific method, a serious difficulty, known as Hume’s
Guillotine, arises. Hume’s Guillotine points out that we cannot
logically get from a fact or a description of a fact to a
prescription for what we are obligated to do. There is no bridge
from ‘is’ — a description of what is the case — to ‘ought’ — a
prescription to what ought to be or should be the case. For
example, just because it is the case that Jane cooks supper every
night does not mean she ought to cook supper or is obligated to
cook supper every night. The plain fact of her cooking does not
contain a moral obligation to cook in the future. The reason
for this is simple: facts alone just are. To confuse a description
of a fact with a prescription to do a certain act is to commit a
logical error known as a category mistake which means that we
are mixing up completely different kinds of things as we do,
for example, when we compare apples to horse shoes. Facts do
not contain any intrinsic obligations. The problem of Hume’s
Guillotine seriously undermines SH’s claim that empirical
knowledge alone is sufficient for ethics to guide man. From
that perspective, SH is completely insufficient.

In contrast, the Bahá’í world-view inspires trust in the
cosmic processes because values are intrinsic in all things as
creations of God.

> This composition and arrangement [the universe],
> through the wisdom of God and His preexistent might,
> were produced from one natural organization, which
70                                              Lights of Irfán vol. 16

> was composed and combined with the greatest strength,
> conformable to wisdom, and according to a universal
> law. From this it is evident that it is the creation of
> God, and is not a fortuitous composition and
> arrangement. [SAQ 181 emphasis added]

In short, creation has order and purpose. This belief
strengthens the orientation to Transcendence and the intuition
of the Encompassing which in turn inspires us to develop our
individual and collective “spiritual susceptibilities.” To one
degree or another (depending on their place in the order of
progressive     revelation)    all   religions   develop  these
susceptibilities which in turn informs a consciousness that is
positive in its outlook and confident in action. In short, it
provides a positive existential stance to the world. Those
inspired by Bahá’u’lláh — or by other Manifestations — share
this positive existential stance and consciousness and

> shall labour ceaselessly, by day and by night, shall heed
> neither trials nor woe, shall suffer no respite in their
> efforts, shall seek no repose, shall disregard all ease and
> comfort, and, detached and unsullied, shall consecrate
> every fleeting moment of their lives to the diffusion of
> the divine fragrance and the exaltation of God’s holy
> Word. Their faces will radiate heavenly gladness, and
> their hearts be filled with joy. Their souls will be
> inspired, and their foundation stand secure. [SWAB 251]

Furthermore, the Bahá’í Writings and theist ethics in general do
not suffer from the ‘is/ought’ problem. Since God is the
Creator of nature, all natural facts are already implicitly
endowed with value, meaning and potential ethical significance.

> Whatever is in the heavens and whatever is on the earth
> is a direct evidence of the revelation within it of the
> attributes and names of God, inasmuch as within every
> atom are enshrined the signs that bear eloquent

> testimony to the revelation of that Most Great Light.

[GWB 177]

In other words, there is more to all created things than can
be known by strictly empiricist analysis. We have already seen
this with the unsuccessful attempts to reduce ‘self’ or ‘soul’ to
purely objective knowledge. From a Bahá’í perspective, all
things have spiritual aspects that are known only to those who
have experienced “the awakening of spiritual susceptibilities.”
[PUP 339] Everything reflects spiritual values and consequently,
there is no logical category mistake of jumping from fact to
value in basing an ethical argument on natural facts. The facts
already embody ethical categories as seen in the names and
attributes of God. For example, the virtue of generosity is
embodied in every created thing insofar as it ultimately exists
by the generosity of God Who brought it out of nothingness.
[GWB 61] Generosity is moral primarily because it is in harmony
with God’s will. The various advantages it brings to individuals
and collectives are also valuable, but by themselves they do not
establish the moral goodness of the act. Only being in harmony
with God’s will can do that. As Bahá’u’lláh says,

> The source of all good is trust in God, submission unto
> His command, and contentment with His holy will and
> pleasure ... The source of all evil is for man to turn away
> from his Lord and set his heart on things ungodly. [TB
> 153-155]

In other words, no action or goal can be good if it does not
harmonize with or “submit” to God’s commands; conversely,
any action or goal that contradicts God’s command is evil.

Unlike SH ethics, Bahá’í ethics have within themselves the
conceptual resources to bridge the gap between ‘is’ and ‘ought.’
The presence of God’s names and attributes performs this
function. Consequently, Bahá’í and theist ethics have not only
self-sufficiency but also coherence, i.e. there is no necessary
conceptual gap between empirical facts and valuations. Indeed,

72                                            Lights of Irfán vol. 16

the Manifestation of God bridge this gap even more directly
and clearly insofar as they are the Beings that guide our
understanding of the facts to the correct moral conclusions.
This feature is also missing in SH ethics.

It is important to state that we do not wish to impugn the
moral sincerity of secular humanists on the issues of ethics and
the valuation of mankind. They are as sincere as anyone else on
both counts — but that is not the problem. The serious
deficiency of their high views of humankind is that it has no
basis whatever in SH’s empirical, scientific world-view. These
high views are, in effect, rabbits pulled out of a hat, add-ons
unrelated and unrelatable to the scientific method: from a
strictly scientific view, secular humanists are not entitled to
these high ethical views. They cannot be established by science
and they obviously come from somewhere else, perhaps secular
humanists’ emotions or perhaps from the religiously shaped
cultural atmosphere in which most of them grew up and live.
However, what matters from our perspective is simply the
observation that SH is absolutely insufficient in establishing its
valuation of man and its ethics on a strictly rational and
scientific basis.

This is no small matter. It may be argued that even with a
concept of the intrinsic values of humans, religions have not
always treated people decently. This is unquestionably true but
there is still an important difference between SH and the
religious world-view. Because of its ontology, religion has
internal self-corrective resources available when it goes awry
i.e. it can still refer back to its ontology and the resulting
philosophy of man and correct course. Whether or not it always
does so is a different issue. However, what is clear is that SH
has no such inner self-corrective resources due to the
limitations of its materialist ontology and strict adherence to
the scientific method. All that SH can do is replace one set of
conventions with another set of conventions; moreover, it
makes our value an extrinsic issue and weakens us because we
are completely dependent on others. In an age that has

witnessed the ravages of totalitarian regimes SH does not seem
to have a sufficient ontological foundation for the intrinsic
value of human beings. It seems clear that the SH materialist
ontology which makes intrinsic value impossible will has a
difficult task ahead if it aims to instilling the deepest possible
confidence and appreciation in the ontological rightness of our
existence as human beings. Yet this is exactly what it must do if
it wishes to present an effective program to replace religion in
the life of mankind.

Part 4: Procrustes’ Bed as a Rack

For the unfortunate overnight guest at Procrustes’ motel
who was too short for his bed, Procrustes added a racking
mechanism that would let him stretch the guest until he fit the
bed perfectly. Precisely because they amputated the
transcendent aspects of human existence, secular humanists
find themselves forced to make use of its stretching functions
in order to make up for the lack of deep significance or
gravitas in man-made concepts. A concept based on human
thought and social approval simply cannot attract the esteem
and reverence inherent in concepts based on the Transcendent.
The reason is obvious: it is hard, if not impossible, to feel that
ideas produced by a creature that is the chance result of an
absolutely random, purposeless and meaningfulness universe
have the same gravitas as ideas from or inspired by or
connected to the eternal ground of being. To overcome this
gaping difference, to make its ideas adequate or fitting to
human needs, SH tries to stretch its concepts to make them
appear as adequate to the needs of human nature.

The vital importance of this ontological grounding — or lack
of it — is recognized by the foremost spokesman for SH in
North America, Paul Kurtz, who writes,

> the central issue about moral and ethical principles
> concerns their ontological foundation. If they are
74                                            Lights of Irfán vol. 16

> neither derived from God nor anchored in some
> transcendent ground, are they ephemeral?37

The Bahá’í Writings answer Kurtz’s question about
ephemerality in the affirmative. Because they are not grounded
in the Transcendence or in the teachings of the Manifestation,
purely secular philosophies have no endurance. Abdu’l-Bahá
states

> The philosophers who claimed to be the educators of
> mankind were at most only able to train themselves. If
> they educated others, it was within a restricted circle;
> they failed to bestow general education and
> development. This has been conferred upon humanity by
> the power of the Holy Spirit. [PUP 205; cf. PUP 400]

Kurtz recognizes that without a basis in a “transcendent
ground” ethical systems, the viability of SH ethics — and with it
the whole SH program — is questionable and in that sense, not
sufficient for human needs. The reason is that all ethical
systems are implicitly or explicitly based on an ontology, i.e. a
theory of reality which allows us to justify their teachings as
objectively real because they are based the nature of reality
itself. However, SH’s ontology rejects any version of
transcendence as a basis of its world-view and consequently
must rely exclusively on reason and science. This creates two
problems. First, as we have already seen, because of Hume’s
Guillotine empirical facts alone cannot lead to moral demands;
a description cannot logically be used as a prescription without
making a logical category mistake. Furthermore, science cannot
be a basis of values because values are not proper objects of
scientific research. Things that are appropriate subjects of
scientific research must meet the following criteria: (1) are
physical/material; (2) are susceptible to empirical direct or
indirect observation by the humans senses or instruments; (3)
are measurable or quantifiable; (4) are results of repeatable
experiments or observations; (5) are observer independent and

(6) are disprovable or falsifiable by observation and/or
experiment. These criteria, which are the basis of the scientific
method, show that ‘values,’ ‘moral judgments,’ ethical beliefs
cannot be determined by science. Science may provide
information which we might consider in making ethical
decisions but the actual ethical aspect of judgment must come
from beyond the facts themselves, either human reasoning or
divine revelation or some combination of the two. This
situation is easy to illustrate with a simple question: how could
a scientific experiment prove that stealing, adultery and murder
are morally wrong? Science can point out the damage this does,
but then, what experiment could prove that doing such damage
morally wrong? What if I don’t care about the damage as long
as I get my way or get pleasure? In the end we will be left with a
stack of psychological, sociological and economic facts, none
of which can tell why me I shouldn’t be ‘bad.’

Kurtz’s starting point for SH morals is what he calls the
“common moral decencies”38 which he claims are accepted by all
cultures. Among them are truthfulness; promise-keeping;
trustworthiness; sincerity; honesty; justice; tolerance and
cooperation; good will; sexual consent and fairness. These, he
believes are inherent in human nature and in our situation as
social beings. In his view, without these “common moral
decencies” any society is unworkable and will disintegrate.
Consequently, he feels they are acceptable everywhere.

The first serious problem is that Kurtz, like all utilitarians,
fails to distinguish between the useful and the moral. Useful
behaviors are not necessarily morally good. The useful and the
good are different logical categories and for that reason cannot
be conflated, as Kurtz, and, indeed, all utilitarians do. For
example, take the hospital room scenario. In a hospital, five
dying people could be saved by a transplant of a different
organ. A lightly injured young man arrives and the chief
surgeon decides to give the dying five patients his young,
healthy organs. By doing so he achieves a utilitarian goal —
saves five lives — and achieves the utilitarian maxim of “the

76                                            Lights of Irfán vol. 16

greatest good for the greatest number.” However, while one
can argue for the sheer practicality of the surgeon’s solution, it
is not possible to argue his actions are moral. The judgment
that an act is morally good and not merely useful cannot come
from the empirical facts themselves — as we have seen with
Hume’s Guillotine.

Hume’s Guillotine and the scientific method make it clear
that no matter how useful an action may be, the promotion
from being useful to being morally good cannot be based on
mere empirical evidence. The same is true for the promotion of
values — such as being thoughtful, educated or polite — to
being moral values or obligations. To be promoted from being
useful or valuable, we need something more, something not
merely empirical and, thereby, subject to Hume’s Guillotine.
There are only two remaining choices from which derive that
‘something extra’. One is social convention and the other is our
orientation to Transcendence and the Encompassing. Humanity
has used both, usually turning to the Transcendent to decide
what is or is not moral and using social convention to enforce
those decisions.

In theory at least, Kurtz recognizes the potential importance
of the Transcendent when he asks, “If they [our moral
principles] are neither derived from God nor anchored in some
transcendent ground, are they ephemeral?39 The flip side of his
question is, ‘Can morals based strictly based on empiricism
endure?’ The Bahá’í Writings suggest the answer to Kurtz’s
question is negative. Abdu’l-Bahá states

> Surely that which is founded through the divine power
> of the Holy Spirit is permanent in its potency and
> lasting in its effect.

> Material brotherhood does not prevent nor remove
> warfare; it does not dispel differences among mankind.
> But spiritual alliance destroys the very foundation of
> war, effaces differences entirely, promulgates the

> oneness of humanity, revivifies mankind, causes hearts
> to turn to the Kingdom of God. [PUP 130, emphasis added]

In the first part of this quotation, Abdu’l-Bahá indicates that
spiritual and not material power will have “lasting effect,” i.e.
they will not be “ephemeral.” Then he provides specific
examples of what he means by contrasting “material
brotherhood” with “spiritual” brotherhood to the advantage of
the latter. The “spiritual brotherhood” is “lasting in its effects”
precisely because it is connect to or grounded in something
higher than mankind and its shifting advantages, interests and
vicissitudes.

Kurtz even points us to the answer to his question about the
ephemerality of values and morals not connected to the
Transcendence. He states that “the central issue about moral
and ethical principles concerns their ontological foundation.40
In other words, while he realizes the importance of the
“ontological foundation” of ethics, he rejects the notion of
Transcendence as the necessary foundation. He is ware that the
nature and structure of reality itself determines whether an
action is ethical. For example, if we believe that all of us were
born because we needed sharp punishment in our lives, then
making life easier for us would not be good — but hurting us
would be. The problem for SH is that its strict empiricist and
materialist ontology logically prevents it from making any
value judgments at all because of Hume’s Guillotine and the
limits of the scientific method. That being the case, the
“common moral decencies” Kurtz advocates can only be
grounded in human agreement and cannot have the same in-
depth foundation as ethics rooted in something that is eternal
or timeless, that is not limited by time and space, that is
independent of all phenomenal things and that is the ground or
producer of all phenomena. In short, his advocacy of these
“common moral decencies” lack gravitas.

In his attempt to make the “common moral decencies” into
the basis of SH ethics in particular and the SH program in

78                                            Lights of Irfán vol. 16

general, Kurtz stretches or exaggerates their viability and
sturdiness to give them a gravitas that cannot be justified in
terms of the SH empiricism and naturalism. This problem in
internal coherence undermines the ability to justify its
conclusions rationally and, thereby, to justify its gravitas. The
‘gravitas’ of any world-view or ethical system refers to how
seriously we must take it on the basis of its (1) internal logical
coherence, (2) its ability to connect to human beings as we
know they are and have been in the past; (3) its ability to engage
people’s “ultimate questions”41 at the emotional, intellectual
level and spiritual levels; and its (4) the issues of legitimacy,
authority and universality. In the foregoing discussions, we
have already seen that SH is weak vis-à-vis internal logical
coherence and we shall see more evidence to this effect below.
We have also seen that in its inability to accommodate
humanity’s universal orientation to Transcendence, SH fails to
deal with humans as we find them now and in the past, thereby
undermining its claims to empiricism as well as its usefulness as
a world-view and guide. This failure also reveals SH’s short-
comings vis-à-vis the ultimate questions that all cultures answer
regarding the nature and make-up of reality and the nature and
purpose of humanity. The orientation to Transcendence and the
intuition of the Encompassing are essential aspects of the
answers to “ultimate question.” It is impossible for a
philosophy that rejects or neglects the answers to these ultimate
questions to claim the gravitas to be an effective guide for
most of mankind. Its concepts cannot reach that far.

The next insufficiency of SH in regards to gravitas concerns
the foundational question of legitimacy which deals with three
questions: (1) Who or what — if anything — has the universal
knowledge, and the understanding of humanity to legitimize or
warrant laying down moral principles and precepts for the
human race? (2) Who or what — if anything — has the
knowledge, understanding and goodness necessary to legitimize
a demand for obedience? (3) Who — or what — is inherently
entitled to make obedience a condition for attaining ‘rightness,’

or true value and appropriate worth as a human being?’ These
questions must be answered in a satisfactory manner for claims
to legitimately to win acceptance in society.

It is self-evident that humans lack such inherent legitimacy.

Not only are human individuals fallible but they also lack the
unlimited knowledge and insight needed to achieve full
understanding of any situation and therefore, cannot dispense
perfect justice and compassion among the complexities of
existence. Humans are often fickle; consciously or
unconsciously pursuing personal advantage; they lack absolute
independence from all things, i.e. are susceptible to outside
influence, interference and coercion. Humans cannot guarantee
objectivity and “equity.” [GWB 203] These facts about human
nature lead to an almost self-evident question: Given the
frailties of human nature, how can any human pronouncements
attain the legitimacy needed to win acceptance as moral
standards? The problem with SH is that it has no answer to this
fundamental question — at least no answer the vast majority of
people are willing to accept. Therefore, instead of abandoning
the orientation to Transcendence they have experienced for
themselves, people chose to build their world-views on ethics
on this orientation and their intuition of the Encompassing.
Being good ‘spiritual empiricists’ they built on their actual
experience rather than on other people’s theorizing. We may
not agree with this choice, but it is not as irrational as SH often
makes it out to be.

Indeed, the choice is logically straight forward once we have
accepted our orientation to the Transcendent and intuition of
the Encompassing. God or any transcendental being is not only
unaffected by the aforementioned human deficiencies, but He
is also the actual maker of the world and the nature of
everything in it. Given His knowledge, it is difficult to imagine
who else could have genuine ethical legitimacy since His
guidance is the only reliable guide to ‘the good.’ This choice has
fewer rational impediments than the SH alternative and so,
from that perspective, is eminently rational.

80                                            Lights of Irfán vol. 16

The second aspect of gravitas is the question of power.

Without legitimacy, power is tyranny but without power,
legitimacy is impotent. Thus, to see how legitimacy is actually
put into practice we must ask (1) ‘Who — if anyone — has the
power necessary to truly enable people to follow these rules
despite their short-comings and weaknesses?’ (2) ‘Who — if
anyone — has the power to impose His will and His ethical
judgments on humankind? (3) ‘Who — if anyone — can impose
both obligations or laws and consequences for committed or
omitted acts?’ It is important to understand precisely what
these questions mean. There is no doubt that various human
powers — for example, societies, priests, ideologies, leaders of
thought — will try to answer these questions for themselves and
that some of them will have a degree of worldly success.
However, as we have already seen from Abdu’l-Bahá, this will
not be “lasting in its effect.” [PUP 130] The Transcendent alone
has this power in an ultimately real sense, and though it does
not manifest its powers in ways we can easily understand, in the
end, the Transcendent will prevail. This underlying confidence
and certainty is one of the reasons religions are associated with
all cultures and ethical systems.

The third aspect of gravitas is ‘universality.’ Here, the most
fundamental question is, ‘Is there such a thing as a universal
human nature?’ Answering this will tell us whether the limits of
authority are defined by time, culture, economics or political
ideology. Both the Bahá’í Writings and SH answer this question
affirmatively insofar as both believe that a universal ethical
standard follows from a universal human nature. Such a
universal human nature is presupposed in Kurtz’s “common
moral decencies.” The significant difference between the Bahá’í
Writings and SH is that the Writings believe that humans need
the inspiration and guidance of the Manifestation to actualize
our moral potentials.

Because postmodern philosophy has made the concept of a
universal human nature so controversial in the last thirty years,

it is important to show how the Writings unequivocally support
this principle. For example, Abdu’l-Bahá says,

> When we observe the human world, we find various
> collective expressions of unity therein. For instance,
> man is distinguished from the animal by his degree, or
> kingdom. This comprehensive distinction includes all the
> posterity of Adam and constitutes one great household
> or human family, which may be considered the
> fundamental or physical unity of mankind. [PUP 190,
> emphasis added]

God has created human nature as it is, and the teaching of
the oneness of humankind affirms that this nature is universal
even though different cultures may actualize different aspects
at different times. The teaching of the oneness of humankind
starts with the “physical unity of mankind.” Furthermore, all
humans possess a “human spirit which distinguishes man from
the animal [this] is the rational soul, and these two names — the
human spirit and the rational soul — designate one thing.” [SAQ
208] Regardless of culture, time, place or circumstance, all
people share one human nature because they have a rational
soul. We also share a higher, spiritual nature and a lower animal
nature which the higher nature must control. [SAQ 118] In
addition, we all posses “spiritual susceptibilities” [PUP 339]
which must be cultivated in order to make spiritual progress
possible. Since there is a universal human nature, then it
logically follows that a universal ethic is possible, i.e. at least
some ethical rules apply to everyone at all times and in all
places. Since God is the creator of human nature, no one is
better qualified than God to establish what this ethic is.
Consequently, there are ethical standards valid across all
cultures, places, times and circumstances and that cross-cultural
moral judgments are possible. Shoghi Effendi writes,

> He [Bahá’u’lláh ] insists on the unqualified recognition
> of the unity of their purpose, restates the eternal
82                                            Lights of Irfán vol. 16

> verities they enshrine, coordinates their functions,
> distinguishes the essential and the authentic from the
> nonessential and spurious in their teachings, separates
> the God-given truths from the priest-prompted
> superstitions, and on this as a basis proclaims the
> possibility, and even prophecies the inevitability, of
> their unification, and the consummation of their highest
> hopes. [PDC 107, emphasis added]

The core of this statement is that Bahá’u’lláh “restate[d] the
eternal verities” which means (1) that certain truths — including
ethical truths — are not bound to one time and (2) that these
“verities” which Bahá’u’lláh “restated” are the same as those
taught by previous Manifestations in other times and places.
Some of these resemble Kurtz’s “common moral decencies”
though this concept as presented by Kurtz lacks the sanction of
the Manifestations. His arguments fail to ‘stretch’ them or
provide sufficient gravitas. In effect, Shoghi Effendi confirms
a meta-ethical perennialism for those morals that are not
“priest-prompted superstitions” and “nonessential and
spurious.” His dismissive description of those religious
teachings that deviate from the “eternal verities” clearly de-
legitimates them. The underlying assumption is that the “eternal
verities” are suited to a universal human nature and what is best
therein. This suggests an important conclusion: ethical
relativism does not apply to the “eternal verities” or
“fundamental verities”42 but it applies to the superstructural
cultural adaptations. The former are universal and the latter are
particular.

It is also important to ask, ‘Can a man-made ethical system
claim to be universally valid for all human beings?’ On the basis
of the foregoing arguments, the answer is clearly negative: man-
made ethical systems lack gravitas in the form of legitimacy;
gravitas in the form of power, and gravitas in the form of
universality.

The latter is inescapably deficient in this regard is because
humans only have access to incomplete knowledge conditioned
by time, location and circumstances, and, therefore, cannot,
even in principle, have the insight into human nature to make
their knowledge universal. This limitation is recognized by all
systems of meta-ethics and is the source of much debate and
controversy. Various types of meta-ethical skepticism and
nihilism find their basis here.43 The fact that this deficiency still
causes so much debate suggests that emphatic denials to the
contrary, theistic meta-ethics cannot just be ignored.

Part 4.1: “Religion for Atheists”

Alain de Botton’s book Religion for Atheists is an attempt
to stretch the SH world-view to help it fulfill important
personal and social functions that SH amputated by rejecting
religion. Unlike the militant New Atheists like Dawkins, Harris
and Hitchens, de Botton recognizes that religions have fulfilled
very useful and worthwhile functions for humanity in the past.
He says that atheists can admit that

> We invented religions to serve two central needs which
> continue to this day and which secular society has not
> been able to solve with any particular skill: first, the
> need to live together in communities in harmony ... And
> second, the need to cope with terrifying degrees of pain
> ... to trouble relationships, to the death of loved ones
> and to our decay and demise ... God may be dead ... the
> urgent issues which impelled us to invent him up still
> stir and demand resolutions which do not go away when
> we have been nudged to perceive some scientific
> inaccuracies in the take of the seven loaves and fishes.44

To his credit, de Botton understands that religion was not
just irrational and fearful foolishness but an evolutionary
development answering deep human needs that are still with us.
Unfortunately, he fails to understand that an orientation to
Transcendence and the Encompassing are an intrinsic i.e.

84                                              Lights of Irfán vol. 16

essential part of the answers to our human needs. Thus, he, too,
applies the amputating function of Procrustes’ Bed — which, in
turn, requires to make use of its stretching mechanism when
what remains is found to be inadequate for human needs.
Having recognized the positive function of religion, he
concludes,

> The error of modern atheism has been to overlook how
> many aspects of the faiths remain relevant even after
> their central tenets have been dismissed. Once we cease
> to feel that we must either prostrate ourselves before
> them or denigrate them, we are free to discover religions
> as repositories of a myriad ingenious concepts with
> which we can try to assuage a few of the most persistent
> and unattended ills of secular life.45

While we applaud de Botton’s open-mindedness, his secular
humanist suggestions for meeting humanity’s ‘spiritual’ needs
are no more than “ersatz” or feeble substitutes for the religious
originals he rejects. He wants the comforts and advantages of
the spiritual life without the ‘metaphysical’ or ‘super-natural’
baggage. In the last analysis, what he suggests is a form of
psychologism, i.e. a reduction of the spiritual and religious
states which includes recognition of Transcendence, to
psychological states. These mental states are purely subjective
and have no cognitive value beyond ourselves, i.e. they tell us
nothing about the world or transcendent realities. Whatever
value and meaning they have is assigned to them by us. In short,
their value is entirely arbitrary.

However, ‘genuine’ spirituality, i.e. spirituality as universally
understood as involving some reference to the supernatural is
excluded from de Botton’s SH world-view. His SH outlook
denies it is one thing to experience community with my
neighbors because I choose to value and appreciate them, and,
quite another to value and appreciate them because they each
exhibit the signs of God and are each an image of God. As
Abdu’l-Bahá says, “All the creatures are evident signs of God,

like the earthly beings upon all of which the rays of the sun
shine.” [SAQ 113] Appreciating one’s neighbor in the Bahá’í (or
religious) world-view has an ontological dimension that
connects the appreciation to God or to the Transcendent source
of all being and, thereby, provides what we have called
“ontological rightness” as well as gravitas. The SH version is
simply a personal, psychological response that has no value
beyond itself and certainly no transcendent guarantor. Yet the
universality of religion indicates that such a connection to the
Transcendent is precisely what human beings need and desire.

Let us examine one of de Botton’s examples. He points out
that churches are good places where strangers can meet
comfortably because all are recognized as children of God and
committed to serving Him and even spreading His faith. De
Botton’s answer to such a ‘safe space’ is the “Agape
Restaurant”46 where we are required to sit and eat with
strangers and, thereby, break the barriers between us instead of
merely reinforcing old connections. While the Agape
Restaurant is certainly a novel idea worth trying, it cannot
replace the spiritual connectedness rooted in the orientation to
Transcendence. Being a good dining partner cannot replace or
be an “ersatz” for being a child of God. Dinner in the Agape
Restaurant may arouse pleasant feelings and be very
informative, but the experience of deep spiritual kinship
through God is more than a good feeling but also a statement
about the ontological value of the other. In fact, it is difficult
not to find such a suggestion somewhat feeble insofar as it does
not comprehend what spiritually-based brotherhood is about.
By-passing some of de Botton’s more outlandish ideas for
ersatz institutions and rituals, let us examine his reflections on
the Virgin Mary. Devotion to her, he says, is valuable because it
allows us to “be weak in her presence,”47 to give free reign to
our most tender emotions, to recognize and embrace our
vulnerability. This is good for us because “atheists may neglect
the frailty that is an inevitable feature of all our lives.”48 They
need to cultivate their tender emotions. De Botton’s solution

86                                              Lights of Irfán vol. 16

to the callousness that might result from the atheist world view
are “Temples to Tenderness”49 These would use art — the great
sad Madonnas of Catholicism — as places to reconnect with
these softer aspects of ourselves, to learn about ourselves from
the perspective of helplessness, vulnerability, suffering and
tenderness. Once again, the problem is clear: an SH philosopher
is trying to stretch secular concepts to meet human needs by
eliminating their religious foundations. In the medieval
Madonnas, the Virgin Mary isn’t only another sad woman; her
sadness represents the sadness of God for the waywardness of
man because that, after all, is why God needed to incarnate
Himself through Her. Otherwise we could just reduce it all to
Bob Marley’s “No Woman No Cry” but that cannot give us the
transcendental comfort and solace we seek. It simply doesn’t
stretch that far. Once again, the vital ontological dimension
needed by humanity is missing.

There is no need to multiply examples to show how secular
replacements for useful religious customs are destined to
failure given humanity’s long demonstrated need for a
connection to the Encompassing. Like a baby blanket on an
adult bed, secular concepts cannot be stretched to cover the
transcendental needs which have demonstrably been a part of
human nature for at least 300,000 years.50 In the last analysis, de
Botton’s ersatz or substitute institutions and/or practices are
simply not the same kind of things as the religious institutions
and rituals they are designed to replace. As Christ says,

> Or what man is there of you, whom if his son ask bread,
> will he give him a stone? Or if he ask a fish, will he give
> him a serpent? [Matthew 7:9-10]

Although offered with the best intentions, de Botton’s
substitutes for transcendently based spirituality seems destined
to fail.

In Good Without God, Greg Epstein also explores the
strategy of establishing SH parallel institutions and practices to

replace their religious counterparts. Even his title at Harvard
University illustrates this: Humanist Chaplain. This title
summarizes his claim to show that the pastoral services
traditionally provided by chaplains or rabbis can be provided
equally well by secular humanists for whom “God is beside the
point.”51 He goes on to state, “The point of Humanism is not
whether or not a God exists, but whether we ought to worship,
fear or pray to it.”52 In this position, reminiscent of Sartre,
Epstein hopes to side-step the existence of God debate and
show how SH teachings can replace divine guidance, i.e. ethics
rooted in the Transcendent. Doing this will, as we shall see,
force him to stretch some of his concepts to the point of
untenability. There is no way to side-step the issue of God’s
existence.

The stretching problem in SH is illustrated in Epstein’s chart
comparing the Biblical Ten Commandments to their SH
counterparts. In Exodus 20:3 the first commandment states,

> I am the LORD they God, which have brought thee out
> of the land of Egypt, out of the house of bondage. Thou
> shalt have no other gods before me.53

There are three points to be noted here. The first is that we
have the immediate presence of the Transcendent as the source
of the command. This provides the ontological dimension and
connection that humans have always sought and required as the
basis of legitimacy, authority and universality in moral matters.
Second, the implicit choice between God and other gods has an
ontological dimension that takes this choice out of the strictly
personal domain. Another will is involved and that complicates
matters. Third, this choice has greater meaning than other,
strictly personal choices because it connects us to the
Transcendent. In short, the First Commandment displays
gravitas.

Epstein’s SH version reads as follows:
88                                           Lights of Irfán vol. 16

> Seek the best in yourself and in others, and believe in
> your own ability to make a positive difference in the
> world.54

While the humanist statement is unquestionably excellent
advice and we have no desire to disparage its content, none of
the attributes noted in the Biblical First Commandment are
present and this makes it inadequate for human needs. The
entire transcendent dimension is absent and that is exactly what
is necessary to satisfy the intrinsic human orientation to
Transcendence. Consequently, the choice to obey or not to
obey this ‘commandment’ is a strictly personal matter and
nothing more; it lacks the “ontological rightness” that comes
with a command from God, the creator or ground of being of
the universe. In short, it is a psychological matter and nothing
more. Moreover, the difference between the commandment and
Epstein’s SH humanist version is the difference between a
command from a legitimate (as defined above) and universal
authority, i.e. God and a suggestion or a genteel urging from a
fellow human being. This urging is not wrong — it is simply not
enough, i.e. not adequate to replace a divine command. It lacks
the legitimacy that humans have historically sought in
Transcendence while the SH version is clearly no more than
good or even excellent advice.

Let us briefly look at another example from Epstein’s book.

He quotes the Third Commandment, “Thou shalt not take the
name of the LORD thy God in vain; for the LORD will not
hold him guiltless that taketh his name in vain.”55 He replaces
this with “Be positive and constructive rather than negative and
disrespectful.”56 Clearly, each of these two statements inhabits
different ‘worlds’ and while each provides good counsel, they
cannot be considered as even approximate equivalents. Not
only does the Third Commandment refer to the Transcendent —
and implicitly to all the associated ontology — but it also
invokes two concepts that have no place in the SH world-view:
guilt and punishment. Taking God’s name in vain is not like

offending another human being, i.e. another created being — it
is offense against the Creator of all beings and is, therefore, far
more serious because of the ontological implications. It is not
merely a personal attack but rather an attack on the basis of all
being. For that reason it elicits sharp divine punishment. None
of these concepts are involved in Epstein’s SH version which
completely omits the issues of punishment and guilt. These have
no place in the SH world-view except as social and legal
concepts and have no ontological implications at all.

It is significant that Epstein admits the failure of humanism
in his book. He states,

> Many factors have contributed to Humanism’s failure,
> thus far, to fulfill expectations.57

He explores various reasons why this is the case, but he does
not recognize the problem with transcendence because to do so
would be to destroy the very foundations of SH. In our view,
the failure to understand and adequately deal with humanity’s
intrinsic orientation to Transcendence and intuition of the
Encompassing is fatally damaging. This orientation and
intuition has to be taken into account in any world-view and
philosophy of man. All attempts to explain them away whether
they come from Feuerbach, Nietzsche, Marx or Dawkins are
doomed to failure precisely because they do not genuinely
reflect human nature and its orientation to Transcendence.

5\. Conclusion: “Humanism’s Failure”58

Although SH is an intellectual failure in regards to internal
logical coherence, Hume’s Guillotine, the scientific method and
the achievement of gravitas, it presents a positive challenge to
‘people of faith’ to examine their own scriptures and struggle
to present their teachings without falling into the same errors.
It should also warn us not to ‘water the wine’ of Bahá’u’lláh’s
teachings to the point where in effect, they become a pale
imitation of themselves for the sake of ‘acceptance’ and start

90                                                       Lights of Irfán vol. 16

to be more like SH. It is sometimes tempting to do this but in
the end, nothing is gained by doing so.
