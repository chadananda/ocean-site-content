The Challenge of the Bahá’í Faith
A Non-Bahá’í Assessment Of Reasons For Studying The Bahá’í Religion,

from World Order, Spring 1976, pp. 31-41.

By V. Elvin Johnson

Why study the Bahá'í Faith? Is the religion worthy of the time and effort required
for its investigation? Could not one spend the time more profitably on some other
subject? Actually, rather than being a subject on the periphery of vital concerns, the
Bahá’í Faith may be regarded as a subject of central importance not only for the
student of the history of religions but for anyone interested in world problems and
proposals for their solution. Ernst Kliemke, president of the Esperanto Society of
Germany, said in an address in Esperanto delivered in Danzig on July 30, 1927:
"Because of their cultural principles alone, Bahá'u'lláh and 'Abdu'l-Bahá are worthy to
be regarded among the highest Lights of all times, even by those who are not able to
accept the religious pan of Their teachings . . ."I The Bahá'í Faith is worthy of
intensive study for the following reasons.

Its Imposing Claims
The Bahá'í Faith compels attention, first, became of its imposing claims. It claims that
the prophets of all religions of the past have foretold the coming of Bahá'u'lláh and
the golden age which would be ushered in by his coming. This claim was not
manufactured by the Faith's followers but is based on the word of Bahá'u'lláh, the
prophet or Manifestation of God after whom the religion is named, who himself
declared:

> The Revelation which, from time immemorial, hath been acclaimed as
> the Purpose and Promise of all the Prophets of God, and the most
> cherished Desire of His Messengers, hath now, by virtue of the pervasive
> Will of the Almighty and at His irresistible bidding, been revealed unto
> men. The advent of such a Revelation hath been heralded in all the
> sacred Scriptures. Behold how, notwithstanding such an announcement,
> mankind hath strayed from its path and shut out itself from its glory.2

Bahá'ís maintain that as the Jews were blinded from accepting Jesus as the Messiah
because of their preconceived ideas about the Messiah and about interpretations of
the prophecies concerning him, Christians are guilty of rejecting Bahá'u'lláh as the
returned Christ became of preconceived interpretations of New Testament
prophecies concerning Christ's return and the events connected with His coming. If
Jesus has returned in Bahá'u'lláh, as Bahá’ís maintain, that event is the most singularly
important event since the ministry of Jesus of Nazareth; for Christians to fail in
recognizing him would be the most grievous sin.

William S. Hatcher, who became a Bahá'í while a student at Vanderbilt Univerafty,
testifies that he studied the thought of such philosophers and theologians as Soren
Kierkegaard, Karl Jaspers, Gabriel Marcel, Jean-Paul Sartre, Richard Niebuhr, Nels
Ferré, and Paul Tillich but found "nothing which is in any way comparable to the
Bahá'í Revelation either in the dynamic qualities of the Spirit or in the satisfaction of
the intellect."3 Hatcher is disturbed that Christian leaders "refuse to consider even the
possibility that the claims of Bahá'u'lláh might be true."4

Could Bahá'u'lláh's claims be true? Bahá'ís not only acknowledge Bahá’u’lláh as the
returned Christ but also make the astounding claim that Bahá’u’lláh is the expected
deliverer hoped for in all the revealed religions; he is the expected Lord of Hosts of
Judaism, the Fifth Buddha of Buddhism, the Sháh-Bahrám of Zoroastrianism, the
"Great Announcement" of Islam, and the return of Krishna for the Hindus. Since
Bahá'u'lláh, according to the Bahá'ís, fulfills the hopes of the world's religions, Bahá'ís
believe that the adherents of these diverse religions may at last be united in
Bahá'u'lláh by one common devotion.

The Bahá'í claim to be a uniting influence among the diverse peoples of the world
finds verification in actual practice, for in Bahá'í gatherings one may find converts
from Judaism, Christianity, Islam, Hinduism, and other religions, worshiping and
serving together in their common loyalty to Bahá'u'lláh. The Bahá'í Faith puts to
shame some of the older religions which, although holding in theory that men are
equal in God's sight, often sadly fail to carry theory into practice.

Bahá'ís claim not only that Bahá'u'lláh is the return of Christ and of the prophets of
other religions but that in him is to be found the solution to the world's ills. When
men accept Bahá'u'lláh and begin to put into action his teachings, the world's
millennium will become a reality, peace will finally be achieved, and men will be
able to live in harmony and unity with one another in world brotherhood. The
religious of the world, moreover, will become united under the banner of
Bahá'u'lláh. When the nations, races, religions, and other divisions of men find their
unity in Bahá'u'lláh, many of the world's current problems will disappear, and
whatever problems remain will find solution under the direction of Bahá'u'lláh's
divinely guided administrators. The Bahá'í Faith aims at nothing less than the union
of all the world's presently existing divisions—racial, religious, national, political,
economical, social, and sexual—in one world brotherhood and one common faith.

No wonder George Craig Stewart exclaimed: "Of all the fantastic dreams that men
have ever dreamed this religion is the most ambitious." 5

Certainly, other religions have had great dreams, and other religious figures have
claimed to be the return of Christ, but Bahá'u'lláh's claims are not so easily dismissed.
The Bahá'í Faith has proved to an extraordinary extent its ability to unite in its cause
the members of various religious creeds and backgrounds, and this diversity in unity
is evident in many Bahá'í gatherings.

If Bahá'u'lláh is the return of Christ, if he is the expected deliverer of all the world's
religions, if he is the hope for world peace and unity, his appearance in the world is
an event of unsurpassed importance, and to ignore him would be tantamount to a
betrayal not only of one's own religious heritage but of all humanity. The Bahá'í
claims are of a nature to demand that attention be given and some response be
made to them.

Its High Praise by Non-Bahá'ís
Another reason the Bahá'í Faith is worthy of study is the high praise lavished upon
the new Faith by non-Bahá'ís. The adherents of a religion might naturally praise it
highly and see great prospects for its future; but when non-Bahá'ís, many of
distinguished merit, speak of the Bahá'í Faith in the terms they do, one's attention
may properly be aroused.

Robert E. Speer, for some forty-six years the secretary of the Board of Foreign Mis-
sions, Presbyterian Church in the U.S.A., a world traveler familiar with religious cur-
rents of the time, said of the Bábi religion: "It is one of the must remarkable
movements of our day . . ."6 Edward G. Browne, who translated various Bahá'í
works into English, called the Bábi-Bahá'í movement "the greatest religious
movement of the century."7

Herbert A. Miller, a sociologist at Ohio State University, wrote: "What will be the
course of the Bahá'í Movement no one can prophesy, but I think it is no
exaggeration to claim that the program is the linear fruit of the religious
contributions of Asia."8 A Christian theologian, Nels F.S. Ferré, admits: "I have been
surprised at the depth and devotional character of the best in Bahá'í scriptures as
presented, for instance, in Townshend's The Promise of All Ages."9

Marcos Bach, formerly a professor of comparative religion at the University of Iowa,
says of the Bahá'í Faith: 'Wherever I have gone to research the faith called Bahá'í, I
have been astonished at what I have found."

He mentions his astonishment when he visited the Bahá'í World Center in Haifa,
Israel, and stood on Mt. Carmel in the shadow of the golden-domed Shrine of the
Báb and his equal astonishment at the Bahá'í Nine Year Plan, projected for the years
1964-1973. He then says;

But most of all, I am continually intrigued by the Bahá'í people, . . .

> representing the basic cultural and ethnic groups around the world and
> embracing obscure and little-known localities in far-flung lands where
> even Christianity has barely gone. . . . I have met them in the most
> unexpected places, in a war-torn village in southeast Asia, in African
> cities, in industrial Mexico, in the executive branches of big industry in
> Iran, in schools and colleges on foreign campuses, in American cities and
> villages, wherever people dream of the age-old concept of the
> brotherhood of man and the fatherhood of God, somewhere in the
> unfolding rapture of the phrase, the Bahá'ís are there.10

Although the Bahá'í are a small and sometimes unnoticed presence amid the fast-
moving, technological currents of the modern world, the historian, Arnold Toynbee,
suggests something of the potential of the Bahá'ís when he observes how the
Christian faith, at the beginning of its second century, was little esteemed by the
cultured elite of the time:

> In a Hellenizing World early in the second century of the Christian Era
> the Christian Church loomed no larger, in the sight of an Hellenically
> educated dominant minority, than the Bahá'í and Ahmadi sects were
> figuring in the sight of the correspending class in a Westernizing World
> mid-way through the twentieth century.11

Toynbee feels that syncretistic religions constructed artificially from elements of
existing religious (such as the attempts of the Roman Emperor Julian and of Emperor
Akbar, in India) have little chance of capturing mankind's imagination and allegiance
because such attempts are made partly for utilitarian rather than religious reasons,
but Toynbee says, "At the same time, when I find myself in Chicago and when,
travelling northwards out of the city, I pass the Bahá'í temple there, I feel that in
some sense this beautiful building may be a portent of the future."12

Such recognitions by non-Bahá'í scholars of the importance and possible destiny of
the Bahá'í Faith require that the religion be given careful attention.

Its Approximation to Christianity
Another reason for studying the Bahá'í Faith, particularly for Christians and those in
the Western part of the world, is its approximation to Christianity. "No religion,"
one writer observes, "shows more strange parallels to Christianity. . . ."13 William A.
Shedd, a Christian missionary in Persia, reported: "For the most part the ethical ideals
are Christian."14 When Edward G. Browne visited Persia in 1887-88, he was "much
touched by the kindliness" of the Bahá'ís. When he mentioned this to his Bahá'í com-

panion, the latter responded by saying that the Bahá'ís were nearer in sympathy to
Browne than were the Muslims:

> To them you are unclean and accursed: if they associate with you it is
> only by overcoming their religious prejudices. But we are taught to
> regard all good men as clean and pure, whatever their religion. With
> you Christians especially we have sympathy. Has it not struck you how
> similar were the life and death of our Founder (whom, indeed, we
> believe to have been Christ Himself returned to earth) to those of the
> Founder of your faith? . . . But besides this the ordinances enjoined upon
> us are in many respects like those which you follow.15

Browne observed that few of the Muslims were conversant with the Christian
Gospels, whereas the reverse was true of the Bahá'ís, many of whom, he noted, "take
pleasure in reading the accounts of the life and death of Jesus Christ."16

Unlike many Muslims who believe that the Qur'án teaches that Jesus did not die on
the cross, Bahá'ís accept the Gospel accounts of Jesus' sacrificial death on the cross,
and whereas Muslims refuse to regard Christ as more than merely a prophet or
teacher from God, Bahá'ís profess him to be indeed the Son of God, a perfect
manifestation of deity.17

In one eloquent passage, Shoghi Effendi, great-grandson of Bahá'u'lláh, delineates the
striking parallels between the ministry of Jesus Christ and that of the Báb:

> The passion of Jesus Christ, and indeed His whole public ministry, alone
> offer a parallel to the Mission and death of the Báb, a parallel which no
> student of comparative religion can fail to perceive or ignore. In the
> youthfulness and meekness of the Inaugurator of the Bábi Dispensation;
> in the extreme brevity and turbulence of His public ministry; in the
> dramatic swiftness with which that ministry moved towards its climax; in
> the apostolic order which He instituted, and the primacy which He
> conferred on one of its members; in the boldness of His challenge to the
> time-honored conventions, rites and laws which had been woven into
> the fabric of the religion He Himself had been born into; in the role
> which an officially recognized and firmly entrenched religious hierarchy
> played as chief instigator of the outrages which He was made to suffer;
> in the indignities heaped upon Him; in the suddenness of His arrest; in
> the interrogation to which He was subjected; in the derision poured, and
> the scourging inflicted, upon Him; in the public affront He sustained;
> and, finally, in His ignominious suspension before the gaze of a hostile
> multitude—in all these we cannot fail to discern a remarkable similarity
> to the distinguishing features of the career of Jesus Christ.18

In the distorted reports of their teachings and activities, in the persecution to which
the Bábis were subjected, in their religion's power to effect progressive social change
and to inspire its followers to self-sacrifice and martyrdom, the Bábi movement
reminds one of essential features of early Christianity.

Early Christian appraisals of the Bábi-Bahá'í movement saw it as a stepping stone in
reaching the Muslims with the Christian gospel. An early notice in The Missionary
Review of the World reported that the new teaching

> has opened the door to the Gospel as nothing else has done. Bible
> circulation is almost doubled every year. It is computed that in many
> towns and villages half the population are Bábis. This is a clear indica-
> tion that the people of Persia are already, in large measure, wearied
> with Islam, and anxious for a higher, holier, and more spiritual faith.
> Almost all through the country the Bábis are quite friendly to Christians.
> The rise of this faith is in a large measure due to the spread of the
> Gospel, the best of their doctrines are borrowed from it, while they
> openly reverence our Scriptures and profess to be ready to reject any
> opinion they may hold when once proved to be contrary to the Bible.19

As late as 1925 Jules Bois wrote, "It is quite possible that Bahaism has a mission to
pacify and spiritually quicken races and tribes which we have so far been unable to
evangelize."20 If Muslims could be won to an acceptance of the mission of Jesus as a
divine revealer of God, perhaps they could eventually be won to a full acceptance of
Christianity. This expectation, however, seems to have been premature, for instead
of being won to the gospel, Bahá'ís began winning converts from Christianity.
Robert P. Richardson, a strong critic of the Bahá'í religion, observed that “although
so recent, this religion has spread from its birthplace, Persia, to the furthest ends of
the earth” and noted with alarm that “Christians by the thousands have deserted the
banner of Jesus for that of Bahá'u'lláh.”21

Christian converts to the Bahá'í Faith, however, do not feel that they are deserting
Jesus for Bahá'u'lláh but are reaching out to Jesus in his second coming. Just as Chris-
tians believe that if the Jews had actually believed Moses they would have believed
in Jesus (John 5:46), so Bahá'ís believe that true Christians will accept Jesus in his re-
turned form, Bahá'u'lláh. The Bahá'í Faith thus becomes, in Bahá'í thought, a truer
form—the modern form—of Christianity. Firuz Kazemzadeh, an eminent Bahá'í and
a professor of history at Yale University, in a recorded commentary on one of
Bahá'u'lláh's writings, says: “The Bahá'í Faith . . . encompasses all the previous faiths
and is organically linked with them. . . . The Bahá'í Faith is Christianity today; the
Bahá'í Faith is Islam today.”22

Because of the Bahá'í approximation to Christianity, Samuel G. Wilson, a Christian
missionary to Persia, felt it necessary to stress that the Bahá'í Faith is “a distinct
religion” from Christianity.23 Since the Bahá'í ethics also are similar to those of

Christianity, the transition to the Bahá'í Faith is easy for some Christians. Be that as it
may, the Bahá'í approximation of Christianity affords another reason for studying
this remarkable religion.

Its Appeal to the Modern Age
A further reason for studying the Bahá'í Faith is its appeal to many people in the
modern age. Charles W. Ferguson wrote in 1929, and his statement is still true in the
1970s, that “No cult bears a gospel better suited to the temper of our times than the
Bahá'í.”24 Indeed, Bahá'ís believe that the Bahá'í message is God's word to the
present age just as his word through prophets of the past was directed in a special
way to the people of those former ages. Part of God's message through previous
prophets, such as the requirement of love to God and man and the "Golden Rule," is
eternal and is restated by succeeding prophets. But another part of the prophet's
message is directed to the special needs of the time. It is at this point that the
prophet employs his divine authority to annul previous laws and to issue new ones
commensurate with the requirements of the new age. Bahá'ís feel, therefore, that in
Bahá'u'lláh's teachings are to be found those divine laws, principles, and requirements
which speak with special force to the present age. Whether one subscribes to this
religious philosophy, it is true that many of the Bahá'í teachings deal with important
issues of the time, and this explains in part the Bahá’í appeal to the modern age.

The Appeal to Modern Issues.
The Bahá'í teaching concerning prejudice speaks about the current racial problem.
The Women's Liberation Movement finds a friend in the Bahá'í teaching of the
equality of the sexes. The threat of nationalism, the problem of war, the hope for a
durable peace, the efforts at international cooperation and arbitration by a "United
Nations" tribunal, the modern friction between science and religion, the language
barriers, the problem of poverty, the scandal of religious plurality—all these
important issues of the modern period are dealt with (and the Bahá'ís would say,
find their solution) in the Bahá'í revelation.

No religion has addressed itself in such specific manner to so many of the major
problems and issues of an age than has the Bahá'í Faith. Arthur L. Dahl, a Bahá'í, ex-
plains that the Bahá'í Faith “recognizes that the major problem of our age is the
resolution of a series of deeply ingrained conflicts which are interrelated and
penetrate various levels of society: conflicts between ideologies, nations, religions,
races, and classes.”25 The Bahá'í Faith, thus, addresses itself specifically to these issues
and offers to modern man a faith, based on the concept of progressive revelation,
which reconciles these conflicting divisions of man.

At a time when Christians are seeking ways to make the gospel more relevant to the
modern world, Bahá'ís feel they already have a gospel which speaks to the modern
age in God's latest revelation. Why, the Bahá'ís ask, should one seek to make a

revelation which was directed to a previous age applicable to a later period, when
God already has vouchsafed to modern men and women His new message which is
specifically designed for the new age? Bahá'ís have for years been directing their
energies toward the solution of certain modern problems which some Christians are
only now confessing their guilt in having encouraged.26 This helps explain the appeal
today of the Bahá'í Faith over more traditional forms of religious expression.

The Appeal in a Modern Ecumenical Age
The Christian Ecumenical Movement of the twentieth century has been widely
acclaimed as a trend which future historians may recognize as “the most significant
event of the twentieth century.”27 The Ecumenical Movement within Christianity no
doubt has been one of the major events of modern times, but Floyd H. Ross says,
“The great issue of the hour is not Christian ecumenism but human ecumenism.”28 It
is to this larger ecumenism that the Bahá'í Faith addresses itself. The Bahá’í's are
concerned not simply with union within the existing religions but with the union of
all the religions in one faith and the union of all people in one universal
brotherhood.

The Bahá'ís, thus, represent a gigantic ecumenical movement. In an age when the
distances which separate peoples and cultures of the world grow smaller every day,
when events in one part of the world dramatically affect the entire globe, when the
threat of total annihilation endangers all life forms on earth, and when man
constantly searches for better and more effective means toward world understanding
and cooperation, the worldwide Bahá'í ecumenical program marks one more reason
for this Faith's appeal to men and women of the modern age.

The Appeal to Today's Religiously Disenchanted
The modern world is justly described as a “post-Christian” and “secular” world.
However much some may think these descriptions have been overplayed, the reality
remains. Edmund Perry writes:

> Respect for the Church is no longer axiomatic in the West and the norms
> of Christian behavior do not as formerly dictate the morals of Western
> culture. Indeed, Christian faith, the Church and Christian behavior have
> become quite unacceptable to the vast majority of folk in the West.
> Bishop Lesslie Newbigin has aptly characterized this loss of the Church's
> power and influence in the West by the phrase "the breakdown of
> Christendom."29

Not only does the secular man outside the church deem the church irrelevant, but a
number of notable persons within the church have left it in recent times because of
its irrelevance to modern man. James Kavanaugh, the "modern priest" who took a
look at his "outdated church" and later decided to leave it, noted that "the most

significant religious experiences are taking place outside or in spite of the institutional
Church."30 He writes:

> It is too hard to convince an irrelevant institution that the world finds it
> intransigent and obsolete. It is hard to "go through channels" when the
> "channels" are more a vested interest than a reflection of an honest
> search for faith. A man can only abandon the institution and search for
> God on his own or with a few friends.31

This search for God outside of the institutional church, of which Kavanaugh speaks, is
being carried on by an increasing number of modern men and women, from the
youthful "Jesus people" to experienced churchmen and trained theologians.

Kavanaugh's indictment of the institutional church is quite similar to what the Bahá'ís
are saying, but instead of looking at only one segment of the modern religious
world—the Roman Catholic church, as Kavanaugh did—the Bahá'ís have taken a
look at Christianity as a whole and also at Buddhism, Hinduism, Islam, and other reli-
gions and found them all outdated and irrelevant to the modern age.

In Bahá'í thought, all religions go through an inevitable process of development and
deterioration. For a time each religion develops and makes a significant impact on
the world but eventually begins to depart from the pure teachings of its founder and
starts a decline in which it continuously loses its spiritual power and its relevance to
the world. At an appropriate point, God sends a new revelation to renew and
revitalize the religion and to make it more applicable to the religious and social
needs of the time.

This revelation of God is continuous and progressive, determined by the world's
needs and by man's ability to receive new revelation. The various religions are
created because the followers of one revelation refuse to accept the succeeding one
but continue instead to adhere to the prophet who brought the revelation with
which they are familiar. To the Bahá'ís, therefore, since God has sent His latest
revelation through Bahá'u'lláh, all previous revelations and the religions which have
been built around them have become obsolete, except for the eternal laws which
deal with matters such as love, kindness, justice, and humility; and these are restated
in the Bahá'í revelation. The messages of previous prophets relating to religious insti-
tutions (rituals, sacraments, ordinances, religious laws concerning prayer, fasting, and
pilgrimages) and laws directed to social needs are superseded.

To the person who has grown weary of seemingly empty religious practices and
teachings designed only to perpetuate the religious establishment regardless of
whether it makes any meaningful contribution to society, the Bahá'í Faith, which
claims to have no clergy or ordinances and a minimum of dogma but an important
social message, makes a definite appeal. Marcus Bach points out that the "many
Americans" who "were ready to accept Bahá'u'lláh as the mouthpiece of God" were

"not people whom the churches have passed by; some of them had passed up the
churches, feeling that creeds and sects were narrow and confining."32

Its Fertility for Insights into Religious Development
Another important reason for studying the Bahá'í Faith is the insight it may provide
in studying other religions, in tracing and understanding the developments which reli-
gions experience. To focus today on the birth and rise of a world religion which is
so close to one's own day at such an early stage in its development may provide in
no small way important, insights into the origin and development of religions of the
past.

To be sure, each religion is unique in some respects so that one could not always con-
clude that what is true of one is necessarily true of all others; but every religion as a
historical and social phenomenon also shares certain common features with other
religions, else one could not speak of the general category of "religions." Every
religion, for example, originates within a particular historical context, and it passes
through certain stages of development. Every religion possesses a body of "sacred"
literature or oral tradition, which is regarded by the religion's adherents as set apart
from other literature or knowledge in a special way.

The Bábi-Bahá'í movement provides the historian of religion with invaluable sources
for studying its origin and development as with no other religion. There are at least
two reasons for this. First, the Bahá'í Faith is the most recent religion. Other
religions began hundreds or thousands of years ago. Of the so-called eleven major,
living religions of the world, only Islam (seventh century A.D.) and Sikhism (sixteenth
century A.D.) are centuries old, the others—Hinduism, Buddhism, Jainism, Taoism,
Confucianism, Shinto, Zoroastrianism, Judaism, and Christianity—date back
thousands of years. The Bahá'í Faith originated only in the last century (1844 A.D.),
and only since 1963 has it reached possibly the last phase of its formative
development, which incidentally makes the present time most appropriate for
making a study of that development. The Bahá’í Faith is, therefore, a religion of
modern times and is naturally more accessible for study and understanding than the
older religions.

A second reason that this faith is an excellent subject of study is that its origin
coincided with the nineteenth-century development of interest in the scientific and
critical study of religion. Joseph Arthur Comte de Gobineau and Edward G. Browne
were among the scholars who took an academic and scientific interest in the religion,
and the material they collected and their observations of the movement have placed
all succeeding students of the Faith in tremendous debt to them. Edward G. Browne,
for example, had a number of interviews with Bahá'u'lláh himself, the founder of the

religion. Moreover, he talked with and corresponded with a number of leaders in
the movement and gained much valuable information.

In spite of these researches, a number of important questions regarding the origin
and early development of the movement remain unresolved, but the information
which is available is considerably greater than is available concerning the rise of any
other major religion. Thus the Bahá'í Faith is important not only for its own
significance but for the insights it may provide in understanding the manner in which
other religions are born and develop.

Its Remarkable Growth
The Bahá'í Faith, moveover, deserves study because of its remarkable growth and
extension around the world. Since its birth in 1844 the Faith has spread from Persia
to all parts of the world and may be called quite appropriately a world religion. The
Faith is reporting spectacular successes in recent years. When William McElwee
Miller wrote his first book on the Bahá'í Faith, published in 1931, he said:

> All impartial observers of Baháism in Persia are agreed that here in the
> land of its birth this religion, which once showed promise of capturing all
> Central Asia, is now steadily losing ground. . . . It is only a matter of
> time until this strange movement, like Manichaeism and Mazdakism
> before it, shall be known only to students of history.33

That description was written in the early 1930s. Much has happened since then.
Miller himself was to note later, in 1940, that the number of Bahá'í Spiritual
Assemblies and the number of voting members had doubled in the decade from 1926
to 1936.34 John Elder referred in 1948 to the "surprising vitality" observable in the
Bahá'í movement in Iran.35 Edward B. Calverly, in 1955, remarked, "The Bahá'í cause
two decades ago was decreasing in influence in Iran, but is, at present, experiencing
remarkable vitality."36 Frank S. Mead reported that "since 1963 there has been a
marked growth in membership" in the Bahá’í Faith.37

Bahá'ís do not give statistics of their worldwide               The numbers quoted in this
membership, but they do publish periodically, among             1974 paper are, of course,
other statistics, information on the number of countries        obsolete. As of 2006, the

Bahá'í Faith has over 5

opened to the Faith, the number of Spiritual Assemblies,        million followers in over
and the number of languages into which Bahá'í literature        100,000 centers throughout
has been translated. A look at the growth of the Bahá’í         the world, making it the
Faith in countries and territories during the periods of the    second most wide-spread
Faith's successive leaders reveals the rapidly developing       religion after Christianity,

with 12,500 local admini-
outreach of its influence. During the Báb's ministry            strative bodies, and 182
(1844-1850), Bábis could be found in Persia and Iraq. By        national administrative
the end of Bahá'u'lláh's ministry (1892), Bahá'ís had           bodies. The community is
penetrated into fifteen countries, and when 'Abdu'l-Bahá        composed of over 2100

passed away (1921), an additional twenty countries had been opened to the Faith.

The period of spectacular extension, however, began under the able administrative
direction of Shoghi Effendi, Guardian of the Cause from 1921 until his death in 1957.
At the time of Shoghi Effendi's passing, Bahá'ís had penetrated 254 countries and
dependencies. Most of this extension occurred after 1953, when Shoghi Effendi
launched the Ten Year Plan. Achievements during this decade (1953-1963) included
the following: the number of countries and territories where Bahá'í resided more
than doubled (from 128 in 1953 to 259 in 1963); the addition of 220 languages into
which Bahá'í literature is translated and printed more than tripled the previous
figure; the number of National Spiritual Assemblies (the national administrative
bodies) quadrupled (forty-seven were formed in this period); seven new Bahá'í
publishing trusts were established; three new Bahá’í temples were built (in Frankfurt,
Germany; Sydney, Australia; and Kampala, Uganda, Africa); and the acquisition of
forty-six new temple sites more than quadrupled the original goal of eleven.

This Ten Year'World Crusade was climaxed in 1963 by two important events: (I) the
election by the members of fifty-six National Spiritual Assemblies convened at the
Bahá'í World Center in Haifa, Israel, of the first Universal House of Justice, composed
of nine men, forming the highest administrative body in the Bahá'í Faith, and (2) the
convening of the first Bahá'í World Congress in London, England, where more than
six thousand Bahá'ís from around the world gathered for the formal celebration of
the Most Great Jubilee (April 21-May 2), commemorating the centenary of
Bahá'u'lláh's declaration of his mission.

The Universal House of justice launched in 1964 the Nine Year Plan concluded in
1973\. The reported growth of Bahá'í membership in the United States within this pe-
riod is extraordinary. The sixty-second annual National Bahá'íConvention (1971), for
example, reported that Bahá’í membership more than doubled within the past
one-year period.38 In a one-month period, nine thousand converts were won in a
thirteen-county "teaching conference" based in Dillon, South Carolina.39 The number
of National Spiritual Assemblies has presently reached 119, with 12 more to be
established in the course of the present Five Year Plan for the expansion of the Faith.

From the few hundred centers in thirty-five countries in which Bahá'ís could be found
when 'Abdu'l-Bahá passed away in 1921, the Bahá'í Faith has expanded today to
more than 69,500 centers in more than 300 countries, islands, and territories of the
world. The remark made by a Protestant minister to Marcus Bach that “If these
Bahá'ís ever get going, they may take the country by storm” may be coming true
today.40

17\.   The Muslim belief that Jesus did not die on the cross is based on an

> disagree concerning it are in doubt thereof;] they have no knowledge thereof
> save pursuit of a conjecture; they slew him not for certain, but Allah took him
> up unto Himself” (Marmaduke Pickthall, The meaning of the Glorious Koran: An
> Explanatory Translation, A Mentor Religious Classic (New York and Toronto:
> New American Library, n.d.], p. 93). Various interpretations of these verses are
> given today by both Muslims and Christians. The traditional Muslim view is
> that some substitute, Judas Iscariot or some other, actually died on the cross in
> the "appearance" of Jesus. The more probable interpretation is that the Qur'án
> is denying any Jewish victory in Jesus' crucifixion since Jesus willingly laid down
> his life. Geoffrey Parrinder calls attention to a possible parallel to these verses
> in Surih 8:17 in reference to the Muslims who were taking credit for victory at
> Badr: "Ye (Muslims) did not kill them but God killed them. . . ." (Parrinder, Jesus
> in the Qur’án [New York: Barnes and Noble, Inc., 1965, p. 120). Ultimately, the
> victory was the work of God. Similarly, the crucifixion was the work of God,
> who "gathered" (3:55; 5:117) Jesus to himself. Cf. Julius Basetti-Sani, "For a
