CHAPTERl

The Messianic Roots of Babi-Baha'i Globalism

Stephen N. Lambden

Ideas of the oneness of a globally united humanity has a rich and
variegated history, reaching back to antiquity (Baldry 1965; Kitagawa
1990). A substantial part of this global thinking is represented by ma-
jor world religions, which have been theologically globally-minded
through most of their existence. This is especially the case as far as
their eschatological hopes, messianisms and apocalyptic visions are
concerned. Eschatological expectations within diverse apocalyptic
traditions include religious messianisms which are associated with
national, global and / or cosmic renewal. It was expected by many
that God would one day through the instrumentality of one or more
exalted messiah figures, set the whole world and its peoples in order.
At least within the main Abrahamic religious traditions (Judaism,
Christianity and Islam), messianic hopes have often presupposed that
in the 'latter days' a messianic advent of global import would take
place alongside a cosmic re-creation.

Scriptures and traditions held sacred within Judaism, Cmistianity
and Islam all give value to predictions that their religion would ul-
timately be made truly global through acts of eschatological warfare
and divine judgment (Klausner 1956; Levey 1974; Sachedina 1981;
Neusner 1984). A final world-embracing battle, an Armageddon, a
major jihad achieving the universal defeat of ungodliness, should take
place throughout the earth and perhaps throughout the cosmos. It was
anticipated that injustice, evil and ungodliness would be challenged
and ultimately defeated, resulting in the universal establishment of

> world order and truth. One or more warrior-messiah figures along
with an elect would induce many of the peoples of the whole world to
