  Clouds and the Hiding God: Observations on Some

Terms in the Early Writing of Bahá’u’lláh

Moshe Sharon

Introduction and Synopsis

Two early Tablets of Bahá’u’lláh, probably the earliest, Rashḥ-i-
‘Amá and Lawḥ Kull aṭ-Ṭa’ám, one in Persian the other in Arabic,

> were translated into English and studied by Stephen Lambden and
> extensively researched by Vahid Ra’fati (in Persian) a decade ago,
> but they are still the topic of further investigation. In several places
> in his writings, `Abdu’l-Bahá relates to, comments on, and interprets
> certain themes in these early writings.

The importance of these tablets, as well as the third one, the Qaṣídatu
‘izz warqá’iyyah, is that they outline the future development of

> Bahá’u’lláh’s teachings about the Divine and the divine manifestations,
> and their relation to the two levels of reality: that which is attainable
> by the temporal senses and that which is attainable by the prophets’
> super-awareness (SAQ 151).

> Highly mystical, the language which Bahá’u’lláh uses in these tablets
> is cryptic in many places and allusions are constantly made to diverse
> sources which, on the whole, may be identified. Naturally, coming
> from the Muslim world, Bahá’u’lláh’s prime source of reference is
> Islam: the Qur’án, its interpretations and the ḥadíth. References are
> also made to ṣúfí ideas and language. All these aspects have been
> studied in depth by Ra’fati in his 1999 article in Persian in Safíniy-i-
‘Írfán (Book 2, pp. 50ff),1 and although he dealt with only one Tablet,

Lights of ‘Irfán Book Thirteen

Rashḥ-i-‘Amá, his observations are also relevant to other early works
of Bahá’u’lláh.

Let us not forget, however, that Islam was not born in a void. It was
born in that part of the world that was the cradle of human civili-
zations, and the residues of all these civilizations were there when
Muḥammad and his successors created the Islamic religion and its
literature. This ancient legacy was memorized and constantly devel-
oped by storytellers, poets, and scholars, generation after generation,
and found its way into the Qur’án and its traditions as it had found its
way into the writings of the Hebrews, the Greeks, the Romans, and
the Christians. It is therefore interesting to examine some of the terms
Bahá’u’lláh uses in these early Tablets and compare them to the rich
sources that represent the ancient homiletic material which found its
way indirectly into Islamic ḥadíth literature and eventually also into
the writings of the báb and Bahá’u’lláh. I refer here to the extensive
body of midrashic and mystical Jewish literature. I do not mean that
the creators of the ḥadíth borrowed from the midrash, but that both
the midrash and the ḥadíth, in the larger meaning of the word, tapped
the same early sources which were available in the territory where they
were born and developed.

In this lecture I shall examine several ideas used by Bahá’u’lláh, such
as the idea of the cloud as the hiding place of the Divine Being or
His dwelling place before creation and after creation. I shall move
through the Bible and the midrash and show that Bahá’u’lláh’s world
of thought and imagination is well-rooted in the same ancient ground
that gave rise to various types of thinkers before him: Prophets and
priests, poets and storytellers, philosophers and theologians.

Many years ago I flew in a small airplane in which there was room only
for me and the pilot. It was a winter day and the sky was rather cloudy.
At a certain point, when we approached what looked like a wall of
cloud the pilot said: “I am looking for an empty hole in the clouds.”

Clouds and the Hiding God

I asked: “Why can’t you fly through the cloud?” and he said, “I don’t
know what is waiting inside it”.

I remembered this incident when I repeatedly encountered the idea
of clouds in the writings of Bahá’u’lláh, especially his early writings
Rashḥ-i-‘amá’ and the Tablet of all Food,2 and in his later tablet Ode
of the Dove, as well as in many of his other writings, notably Kitáb-
i-Íqán, and the Hidden Words. In all these writings, Bahá’u’lláh uses
the word cloud in an allegorical meaning, sometimes as representing
the Divine Being, sometimes the manifestation, sometimes for a new
exegesis of the Scriptures, and sometimes, as in The Hidden Words,
to denote the idea of a veil concealing the person from the truth of
the New Manifestation (Thus: “yá ibn al-‘amá’—O son of the cloud!”).

But since every allegory has its source in more tangible and natural
words and although behind the façade of words there is often a
hidden meaning, I shall try in what follows to move between the two,
mainly concentrating on the sources behind the usage of the idea
of the cloud and touching upon two types of clouds bearing a close
relation to each other: the hiding cloud and the rain cloud. The first
type represents a wider concept than the other.

The Hiding Cloud

> In the Tablets of Rashḥ-i-‘amá’, Kull aṭ-Ṭa‘ám, Qaṣídah Warqá’iyyah,
> Ishráqát and many others, the Arabic-Persian word used for cloud is
‘amá’. In Kull aṭ-Ṭa‘ám (Khavárí, 2007, 257)3 this cloud acts as veil

> behind which, in some cases, the divine dove or “the dove of light”, pre-
> sumably the manifestation, hides singing the eternity of God. The
> concealing cloud is called in this case, “veils of cloud, ḥujubát al-‘amá’.”
> The context for identifying the cloud with a veil was the personal
> situation of Bahá’u’lláh following his imprisonment in the Black
> Dungeon, his experience of revelation therein, and his expulsion to

Lights of ‘Irfán Book Thirteen

Iraq with all his family during the winter of 1853. He describes his
experience in that period as “a dark night” creating an unusual super-
lative adjective in Arabic from the word layl—night—to express it:
al-layl al-alyal for which in English translation would sound like “the
nightiest night.” As usual in his style he repeats the same idea in other
and more familiar forms: aẓ-ẓulumát al-aṭwal (instead of aẓ-ẓulumát
aṭ-ṭúlá) “the longest darknesses (sic!)”.

His message is clear: there is hope in this dark, seemingly hopeless
situation since behind the veil of the cloud, no doubt a dark cloud,
Bahá’u’lláh can hear the voice of the divine dove, and we, the readers,
whether believers or not, are made to carry the idea of this dove that
appears very frequently in Bahá’u’lláh’s world of similes. It could well
be compared to the dove in Jewish and Christian sources, the dove of
the shekhinah, literally meaning the divine presence.

At any rate, in this study we are interested in the cloud itself, even
before entering into the problems of interpreting it. The cloud
represents the dark veil which, in the “dark night”, is a perfect
hiding place for the divine, whose voice can be heard pointing to
His presence, but whose reality cannot be conceptualized. The
most striking example of this concept of God’s voice without His
appearance is found many times in the Bible. 4 In the Book of Exo-
dus, passages describe the descent of God onto the burning Mount
Sinai engulfed in clouds and smoke that obscured the top of the
mountain. This terrifying event followed something the Israelites
coming out of Egypt had already experienced: God leading them in
a pillar of cloud in daytime. This cloud turned into a pillar of fire
by night. On Mount Sinai, God’s appearance was accompanied by
the rumbling of thunder and by lightening, and was, no doubt, very
spectacular making such a frightening impression on the people
that they said to Moses “Speak thou unto us and we will hear; but
let not God speak with us lest we die.” (Ex. 20:16)

Clouds and the Hiding God

In scores of places in the Bible the idea of God hiding in the cloud
is expressed in various forms, but in all of them it is a thick cloud
obscuring everything, not only inside it but naturally also what is
beyond it. Sometimes this thickness is expressed by the Hebrew
word ‘av (pl. ‘avím) instead of ‘anán, or even the two words together
as in Exodus 19:9: “And the Lord said unto Moses, ‘lo I come unto
thee in a thick cloud (‘av he‘anán), that the people may hear when I
speak unto thee’…” Note! “Hear” not “see”.

Before going on, we must emphasize here that even in the most
metaphorical usages when natural objects are involved, like clouds
in this case, the allegory is based on visualizing the real thing. No
matter how far the metaphor goes in using the natural object to
express an abstract idea, it is the natural object which leaves its
impression on the mind before entering into metaphysical and
speculative interpretations. For this reason, even though the cloud
is used by thinkers in an allegorical sense, it is still the cloud of
nature which they see and the reader, or listener sees. It is like say-
ing of a person that he is a lion, a snake or a monkey. The meaning
is understood but we still see these animals.

For the believer, who is neither a philosopher nor theologian, the
natural phenomena are the true reality, and he does not need any
interpretation to connect them directly with God.

For the Biblical man, God’s presence in heaven as well as his descent to
earth were natural realities. He did not indulge in hair-splitting argu-
ments concerning the question of whether God could be described
in limiting terms. On the contrary, prophets and ordinary believers
alike did not refrain from describing God in the most anthropomorphic
language. He has a head, eyes and hands. He is angry, loving, and
jealous just like any human. It is his omnipotence, omniscience
and omnipresence, his eternality and concealment which make
Him different from and above his creation. At the same time he is

Lights of ‘Irfán Book Thirteen

a personal god, who can be approached, who hears prayers and sup-
plications; he is compassionate and merciful, but also demanding and
dangerous. He can be loving but also full of rage and quick to punish:
a father in a patriarchal family. He is also mysterious, and his mystery
is dangerous: “Man cannot see me and live.” Moses, who for the Jews
is the human being who was allowed to come nearest to God, was
not allowed to witness His reality, God’s “face” in the language of the
Bible; he was allowed to witness only God’s “back” (Ex. 33:18–20).
This was the highest status that any human (in Judaism, prophets are
not manifestations of God) could ever reach, a status which earned
Moses in Islam the title of klím alláh “he who spoke with Alláh.”

Two divine elements are emphasized here: First, the arrival of God in
a cloud. In other words, the cloud is not only an obscuring substance,
forming an impenetrable veil, but also a divine chariot, to which we
shall soon return. Second, the voice of God is heard from inside the
cloud. The difference between this voice and the voice of the dove
is that with the former, the voice heard from the cloud in Sinai was
directed at all the people of Israel, in case of the dove of heaven only the
prophet could hear it. However, both voices were heard in the same
place, both on Mount Sinai, even if the Mount Sinai of Bahá’u’lláh is
a concept more than it is a geographical spot. The difference between
the two voices is both in the content and in the principle. The God
of Israel established a covenant with His people in the roaring voice
of thunder and the fire of lightening. But in Bahá’u’lláh’s vision the
atmosphere is subdued, quiet and gentle:

> I beseech thee, my God, in the darkest night when the pigeon of
> the cause (or: the divine Command) sings on Mount Sinai on
> the right side of the Red Tree, the melodies of thy eternity; and
> in those times of long darkness at the presence of the warbling
> dove of light that sings thy infinity behind the veils of the cloud.

Clouds and the Hiding God

> ‫…يا الهي ألقسمنك في ذلك اليل األليل عند تغني حمامة األمر في جبل‬
> ‫السيناء عن يمين شجرة الحمراء بتغنيات أزليتك وفي تلك الظلمات‬
‫بتغردات سرمديتك‬
ّ ‫األطول تلقاء تغرد ورقاء النوراء خلف ُح ُجبات العماء‬

)٧٥٢ ‫ ص‬٧٠٠٢ ،‫(رحيق مختوم‬

In Moses’ experience in Sinai it is specifically indicated that

> the glory of the Lord abode upon on Mount Sinai and the
> cloud covered it six days, and the seventh day he called unto
> Moses out of the midst of the cloud, and the sight of the glory
> of the Lord was like devouring fire on the top of the mount in
> the eyes of the children of Israel. And Moses went onto the
> midst of the cloud, and got up into the mount; and Moses
> was in the mount forty days and forty nights (Ex. 24:16–18)

Bahá’u’lláh also wants “to go into the mount.” The scene as described
by him is much quieter: no rumbling thunder, but the prophet
hears the voice and also wants to be in the presence of his Lord; he
also wants to be invited. He uses a very strong word to entreat the
Almighty. Turning directly to him he says:

> I beseech thee…that thou raise me up into the heaven of
> concealment (ghayb)… and make me ascend to the horizon
> of witnessing (shuhúd)… and make me climb into the hiding
> place of thine Oneness, and honour me to encounter thy counte-
> nance, so that I take an abode nigh unto thee, [at thy side], and
> rest upon thine carpet and recline on the pillows of light and
> stretch out on the heaven of the manifestation…

Here I wish again to point out the elements of the allegory, their usage
and the part they play in the mind of the hearer. Carpets, pillows,
cushions, stretching out, reclining, and so on, are of course meant
here metaphorically but one can not ignore the fact that first and
foremost they are real objects that represent real experience in a real

Lights of ‘Irfán Book Thirteen

world. They are carried into the metaphor but it is because of their
real nature and function that the metaphor is understood. However,
in the eyes of the believer these and other similar objects need not
be understood metaphorically. On the contrary, the Muslim believer,
for instance, is assured by the Qur’án and a large number of tradi-
tions, as well as by endless sermons and writings of learned ‘ulamá’
that the delights of heaven are as real as they are described, with real
food, real drink and real women, and the fires of Hell consume like
any fire. Following this observation it should be emphasized that the
fire, and clouds, and thunders and lightening on Mount Sinai were
real. There is no metaphor here: “Moses drew near the heavy cloud
where God was” (Ex. 20:18). The Biblical message is clear: the cloud,
or the thick darkness, was a genuine cloud and God was actually in it.

Bahá’u’lláh wants to be there beyond the cloud and he is as bold as
Moses, or even bolder for, as we have just seen, he goes into great
detail about where exactly he wants to be in the presence of his Lord.
Moses expressed the same idea in a short sentence: “I beseech thee:
show me thy Glory.” (Ex. 33:18) To which God answers: “Thou canst
not see my face; for there shall no man see me, and live.” (EX. 33:20)
Unfortunately, there is no record of God’s answer to the same request
of Bahá’u’lláh who asks to be honoured with seeing God’s “face” or
countenance (bi’an tusharrifaní biziyárati ṭal’atika).

> The cloud as a hiding place of God is a recurring topic in the Bible;
> moreover it is his abode. Thus, for instance, when King Solomon
> built the Temple in Jerusalem and placed the Ark in it “the cloud
> filled the House of the Lord… for the glory of the Lord filled the
> House of the Lord.” (1K, 8:10–11). In other words, God came in His
> cloud into the house built for him on earth. For usually He does not
> dwell on earth, or, in the words of Solomon: “The Lord said that he
> would dwell in the thick darkness.” (1 K, 8:12) The Hebrew word for
“thick darkness”—‘arafel—is rightly translated as “dark cloud” in the

King James Bible.

Clouds and the Hiding God

But the cloud, as we have already mentioned, is not God’s static home.
As a natural phenomenon, the clouds move, and therefore the cloud is
the chariot of God. In many places in the Bible, God is portrayed as
riding, or sitting on a cloud. He is also called “the rider on the clouds.”
(rokhev ba’aravot. Ps. 68:5) The word ‘aravot for clouds was borrowed
together with its context from Ugarit where we find the god Ba’al, the
chief deity of the Phoenicians, riding on clouds.

God is also described as moving from place to place riding on a cherub.
Thus we find in Psalms 18:11(=2 Samuel 22:11): “And he rode upon
a cherub and did fly; and he was seen upon the wings of the wind.”

The prophet Ezekiel (1:4–26), describes in great detail his vision of
the living chariot of the theophanic God, resting on four cherubs.
The throne upon which he sits is above them, under the dome of the
sky, exactly as in nature the clouds are under the sky, so that God
moves with his chariot under the canopy of his permanent abode.
He sits on the cherub or cherubs and they spread their wings to
conceal him, exactly like the cloud. In fact, clouds and cherubs are
one and the same; they interchange easily in biblical descriptions.
The idea of the cloud-cherub being God’s veil, protecting the divine
appearance and at the same time serving as the divine chariot is well
represented in a verse from the book of Samuel following the one
just quoted which described God as riding on a cherub. “And He
made darkness pavilions round about him, dark water, and thick
clouds of the sky.” (2 Samuel, 22:12)5

The cloud as the hiding place of God is no doubt the source of the
ḥadíth which appears even in traditionally accepted, authoritative col-
lections. When the prophet Muḥammad was asked “where was God
before he created his creation”, he answered: “He was in a cloud above
which was water and beneath which was water . Then he created his
throne on the water.” (Ibn Májah 65)6

This tradition is usually quoted because of the word ‘amá’ used in
it, which has caused some discussion among theologians and mystic
philosophers, because it defines God in the most limiting terms.
However, believers, as I emphasized before, are not bothered by such
hairsplitting arguments, and the concealment of God in a cloud is
perfectly fitting, a very enduring human belief. It is enough to read
the first verses of the book of Genesis to encounter the same idea.

> Before creation or in the very first act of creation “when the earth was
> without form and void; and darkness upon the face of the water; and
> the spirit of God moved upon the face of the water” God began his
> creation in the course of which he divided between the lower water
“which was under the firmament” and upper water “above the firma-

> ment” (Genesis, 1:7). In the ḥadíth, which was created a few thousands
> years after the Biblical tradition, it is not very difficult to see how this
> division of water came into being. It is not far-fetched to suppose that
> the firmament in Genesis could well be the cloud in the ḥadíth.

Going deeper into Sumerian-Babylonian records brings us to the
story about the god Marduch, the head of the Babylonian pantheon,
splitting in two the body of the monster Tiamet, ancient goddess of
the primeval waters, creating heaven (with its water) from one half
and earth (with its water) from the other half.

Coming back to the ḥadíth we are told that God first created His throne
on the water, no doubt on the higher water, which is above the cloud,
and which thus continues to fulfill its main function as a concealing
veil for the divine. In the Biblical tradition this point is made very
clear: God erects his throne above the cloud-chariot. Prophet Ezekiel
described the throne above the chariot, other Biblical texts describe
the throne in heaven, namely inside the canopy above the clouds: “The
Lord has established His throne in the Heaven; and his Kingdom
ruleth over all,” says the Psalmist (Ps. 103:19). And the Prophet Isa-
iah, criticizing the idea of building the House of the Lord on earth,

declares: “Thus saith the Lord: The heaven is my throne and the earth
is my footstool; where is the house that ye may build unto Me? And
where is the place that may be my resting place? (Isaiah, 66:1)

From the chariot (Heb. merkavah), God can rise to his throne in
heaven, and from the throne he descends to his clouds-chariot.
Both ways the gates of heaven open in coordination with his move-
ments; but whichever way, he is always concealed from the creation
by the clouds.

Clouds of Rain
What are the clouds to which Bahá’u’lláh alludes in his writings. To
begin with, we see that he uses the word ‘amá’ as well as the word
ghimám to describe clouds. (Ode of the Dove v. 2, 3) He also uses
the word saḥáb in the same meaning. Even more interesting is the
fact that that he refers to God as he who rides over a cloud, exactly
as we have just found in the Biblical references, and one can hardly
exclude a Biblical influence particularly since as it seems, reading
the Kitáb-i-Íqán, that Bahá’u’lláh (as well as ‘`Abdu’l-Bahá—(SAQ,
36ff) was familiar with the Book of Daniel where we read the verse
which speaks about the clouds of heaven as a divine chariot: “And
behold there came with the clouds of Heaven, One like unto the
son of man.” (Daniel: 7:13)

In the Ishráqát, we find a reference to Him who rides on the clouds:

qad atá al-wahháb rákiban ‘alá as-saḥáb—“the Bestower has come riding
on the clouds,” and again the same formula in a form of an oath: qul:
balá wa-rabb-as-saḥáb—“Say: Yes, by the lord of the clouds.” (Ishráqát,
Majmú‘ah-i-Alwáḥ, Hofhein, 2000, p. 66 l.11 and last line)7 The
Islamic tradition which speaks about God being in a cloud before cre-
ation has been rightly connected with the famous ḥadíth qudsí where

God referred to Himself as “hidden treasure (kanz maknún),” and
that wishing to be known he decided to create His creation. In other
words, this ḥadíth coming straight from the mouth of God himself
attributes to God wills and wishes, even uncontrolled needs such as
human needs: to be known. But this ḥadíth is neither strange nor
original. Going some thousand years back to the Midrashic tradition
we find that God created the world because he wanted to build for
himself an abode “down below” (Midrash Tanḥúmah on Naso, ch.16)
and to choose for Himself people who would proclaim his Name all
the time. How otherwise would He be known? 8

Bahá’u’lláh rejected the idea that through creation God revealed
himself and came out, so to speak, from his hidden abode. Turning
to God in an adoring prayer he says that every part in him bears testi-
mony to God’s oneness, omnipotence, omniscience, government and
glory; “and that you are Alláh, no god but thee. You are forever a hidden
treasure concealed from the eyes and conceptualization, and forever you
are what you are eternally and for ever and ever.” (Ishráqát 65). In other
words God is still concealed probably in his cloud.

If we accept that Rashḥ-i-‘amá’ is the first tablet of Bahá’u’lláh, or at
least one of the first, then we must consider his particular descrip-
tion of this cloud, because it may reveal some of his later attitude
to the same subject. This is a cloud which rains! Presumably water;
although the hidden meaning in this poem which may be described
as an Ode to the Manifestation is completely spiritual. This poem is
a precursor of his much longer poem on the same subject the Ode of the
Dove. In both of these poems, we encounter the theme or the symbol
of the raining cloud. In the early poem, the word used for raining
or sprinkling, is rashḥ a word which is reserved mainly for water. In
the Ode of the Dove, written at least thirty years later, the substance
sprinkled by the cloud is perfume, (“Because of its resplendence
the perfume of the cloud was stirred”—libahjatihá misk al-‘amá’
tahajjat) an understandable choice of word for describing the new

> Manifestation. But, then he goes on to use another word denoting
> clouds for describing the New Times of the divine salvation. It is not
‘amá’ but ghimám. The reference, as Bahá’u’lláh himself explains, is

> to two verses in the Qur’án, both referring, with and without addi-
> tional interpolations, to the End of Days, or as Bahá’u’lláh puts it:
> kull dhálika min ‘alámát al-qiyámah wa-má yaḥduthu bihá:—All these
> are the signs of the resurrection (or, End of Days) and that which
> will happen therein.” (Bahá’u’lláh’s notes to the first three verses of
> the Ode of the Dove.)

The idea behind the usage of ‘amá’ and ghimám in these verses is
that these two words are synonyms. The word ghimám means heavy
clouds, which reflects the meaning of the verb ghamma, to veil. So
this type of cloud is thick enough to veil God and the angels who,
according to the Qur’án, ride over it.

The word ‘amá’ represents all kinds of clouds, of any possible shape.
However, its usual meaning is a heavy cloud of rain (like its synonyms
saḥáb and ghimám); even if in the dictionaries other meanings can
be found, which Vahid Ra’fati diligently collected. These meanings
stretch from a very thin cloud to one heavy with rain and a cloud
which has already poured its water but has not yet scattered. (Ra’fati,
1999:53)

Dark clouds, heavy with rain, are those connected with God. Man
has always been fascinated with rain clouds because, after all, these
are the clouds that enable him to live. In all religions, God or the gods
cause these clouds to bestow life on earth. The clouds accompanied by
lightening and thunder were identified with the great life-giving god.
Ancient man paid attention to the fact that clouds of rain are found
around the peaks of high mountains even when they are not anywhere
else. It is not surprising that the tops of these high mountains, reach-
ing out to the sky and surrounded by clouds pouring their rain, were
seen as the abodes of the gods and the situation of the throne of the

supreme deity, the god who was identified with rain and thunder. The
ancient Greeks identified Zeus as this god and in times of drought
the Athenians prayed: “Rain, rain, O, dear Zeus on the corn lands of
the Atheneans and the plains.” (Frazer, 1967 210)9 Zeus’s counter-
part, the chief deity among the Hindus is Indra the god of war, storms,
thunder and rain. In the Daily Jewish prayer, known as the Eighteen
Benedictions, the second benediction extolling God’s omnipotence
and his ability to quicken the dead (including, no doubt, the dry land
after the long summer) says:

> Thou O Lord are mighty for ever, Thou revivest the dead,
> Thou are mighty to save. Thou causest the wind to blow and
> the rain to fall. (Hertz, Daily Prayer, 1976, 133)10

The Psalmist, extolling God, speaks frequently about His great
power by which He causes rainfall, lightning and thunder.

> “He causeth vapours to ascend from the ends of the earth,
> He maketh lightening for the rain; He bringeth forth the
> wind out of his treasuries.” (Ps. 135:4)

That rain was the gift of the all-powerful God who was recognized
as such by ancient man, no matter to which culture or religion he
belonged. Dark clouds of rain were a gift or a reward from God for
those who followed his commandments. This divine gift, the rain, is,
therefore, conditional.

Thus we read in Deuteronomy 11 in the passage that forms the central
part of the Shema’, the most important of the Jewish prayers:

> And it shall come to pass, if ye shall hearken diligently unto
> my commandments which I command you this day, to love
> the Lord your God, and to serve him with all your heart and
> all your soul, that I will give the rain of your land in its season,

> the former rain and the latter rain, that thou mayest gather
> in thy grain, and thy wine and thine oil… (Deu. 11:13–14)

Otherwise, in the case of disobedience:

> …the anger of the Lord be kindled against you, and He shut
> up the heaven, that there be no rain and that the land yield
> not her fruit… (Verses 14–17)

There was only a short distance between natural rain, representing
God’s benevolence, and the mystical idea of divine grace streaming
down from His secret abode onto the world. There was nothing
strange or unusual in the idea which we find in the Jewish Kabbala
of the divine life giving water, or God’s seed, streaming through the
tree of the sefirot from the “Ancient of Days”, from the highest sefira,
the Divine Crown, down to the lowest one, the sefira of Kingship
(malkhut). Similarly, it was only natural, therefore, for Bahá’u’lláh to
use the same idea to describe the appearance of the new manifesta-
tion of God in a term so well-known to people as rain from a cloud.
He leaves no doubt about the comparison of this manifestation to
real rain, for the language he uses is very clear. He uses the Arabic
word rashḥ which has the specific meaning, as we saw, of dripping
or leaking, mainly of water, but he defines it with the Persian verb
ríkhtan [ríz] which means to pour. This is the verb which he chose as
the rhyming word throughout the whole poem. Having established
the comparison he can continue by qualifying the pouring down as
not being of water but of the secret of God’s fulfilled promise, and the
rain, therefore, is another rain, not water, and the wind that blows
with it brings the perfumes of China. This rain is:

> The overflow of the manifestation, the pouring of purity, the
> song of the birds it is, which comes through straight from the
> inner nothingness.

This explains why `Abdu’l Bahá, in his interpretation of the word
‘amá’ to a believer in Egypt, avoided speaking about the dark cloud

> of rain and opted for what he defined as the very light, delicate cloud
> which can sometimes be seen and sometimes not. It is only if you
> were to concentrate intensely you might see something but when just
> looking nothing can be seen. Because of this, ‘amá’ was understood
> to mean the absolute reality.” (Ra’fati 1999, 58).11 Just as the cloud
> can be seen and not be seen so also in the case of the perfect oneness
> and absolute reality there is perception and non-perception of the
> attributes which are in the Self (dhát), conceptualized and not con-
> ceptualized. This is the situation of the “hidden treasures mentioned
> in the hadith.” (ibid)

Were `Abdu’l-Bahá to regard the cloud as a heavy rain-cloud he
would have found himself in the realm of the rather crude idea of
God hiding in real darkness which would mean limiting him to a
specific place, whereas ‘amá’, as he explains it, turns the whole con-
cept into an allegorical one. Cloud, wind, perfume, rain and sun can
therefore be used freely without fear of crossing the border of ta‘yín,
limitation by definition.
