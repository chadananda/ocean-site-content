Enacting Thought: Divine Will,
Human Agency, and the Possibility
of Justice
HOLLY HANSON

Abstract
This paper argues that in the Writings of the Central Figures of the Bahá’í Faith,
social structures are viewed as embodiments of thought which gather substance
through generations of human decision making. The processes that create both
injustice and justice are gradual, almost imperceptible in their operation, and they
shape our reality. Oppressive social structures are the result of generations of self-
interest, while social structures which facilitate justice result from deliberate, con-
tinuous effort to implement the will of God. Two examples, one of political trans-
formation and one of economic transformation, illustrate this argument. The
paper outlines the history of political practice in Uganda over three centuries,
then examines the transformations of productive activity in eighteenth- and nine-
teenth-century England which strongly influenced industrial capitalism.

Résumé
L’auteur de l’article soutient que, selon les écrits des figures centrales de la foi
bahá’íe, les structures sociales sont vues comme la concrétisation de pensées
émanant de prises de décisions échelonnées sur plusieurs générations. Les proces-
sus qui créent l’injustice tout comme ceux qui créent la justice opèrent de façon
graduelle, voire imperceptible, et ils façonnent notre réalité. Tandis que les struc-
tures sociales oppressives découlent d’intérêts personnels maintenus sur
plusieurs générations, les structures sociales favorisant la justice résultent d’ef-
forts délibérés et continus pour faire la volonté de Dieu. Deux exemples de
processus de transformation sont fournis pour étayer cette thèse, l’un de nature

politique et l’autre d’ordre économique. Après un survol historique de trois siè-
cles de pratiques politiques en Ouganda, l’auteur se penche sur les transforma-
tions qu’a subies l’activité de production en Angleterre au XVIIIe et XIXe siècles,
des transformations qui ont grandement influencé le capitalisme industriel.

Resumen
Este trabajo sostiene que en los escritos de las figuras centrales de la Fe bahá'í,
las estructuras sociales se perciben como una forma tangible del pensamiento y
que estas mismas estructuras adquieren más sustancia tras generaciones de deci-
siones humanas. Los procesos que crean tanto la injusticia como la justicia son
graduales, casi imperceptibles en su funcionamiento, y dan forma a nuestra reali-
dad. Las estructuras sociales opresivas son el resultado de generaciones de egoís-
mo, mientras que las estructuras sociales que facilitan la justicia son el resultado
de un esfuerzo deliberado y continuo de poner en práctica la voluntad de Dios.
Dos ejemplos, uno de transformación política y el otro de transformación
económica, ponen de manifiesto este punto debatido. Este artículo describe la
práctica política durante trescientos años de historia ugandesa, y examina las
transformaciones de la actividad productiva en los siglos 18 y 19 en Inglaterra,
que influenciaron de sobremanera al capitalismo industrial.

High hopes and bitter disappointments shaped the theory suggested by
social critics in the second half of the twentieth century. They had experi-
enced communism without equality, nationalism without freedom, and
modernism without prosperity. In order to explain these failures and chart
directions for future action, many focused on the power of deeply ingrained
habits of thought to shape social structures. Antonio Gramsci, seeking to
understand the complacency of Italian factory workers, wrote about hege-
mony: the uncritical assent given by mass society to its own domination by
a few (Femia 44–45). Probing humanity’s responsibility for the Holocaust,
Max Horkheimer and Theodor Adorno argued that the commodification of
culture and a misplaced faith in rationality had deprived human beings of
moral consciousness and will. Pierre Bourdieu’s concept of habitus and
Michel Foucault’s description of a power/knowledge nexus also explored
the heavy social weight of accumulated thought.
These diagnoses of social stagnation resonate with some aspects of

Enacting Thought                                29

Bahá’í ideas regarding how humanity created its current problems. It can
be argued that critical social theory and Bahá’í scripture share the concept
that thought shapes structures, which then influence thought; the recog-
nition that self-interested actions have consequences over time; and the
perception that unquestioned imitation of the past perpetuates and facili-
tates oppression. The fundamental difference between the Bahá’í percep-
tion of the relationship of thought and action and that of critical social
theory is the Bahá’í recognition of humanity’s capacity to transcend
oppressive thought and create structures that embody justice using the
power of the Word of God.

Social action builds on a theory of social reality. The belief that social
structures embody injustice and shape people’s experience of reality leads
to a strategy focused on breaking oppressive structures. On the other
hand, the belief that structures develop gradually, as an expression of
human thought, leads to a strategy of social transformation based on
changing the way people think and act. This paper argues that the theory
of social action inherent in the Bahá’í Revelation focuses on human action
as the agent of Divine Will. Human beings utilize the transforming power
of the Word of God to envision and enact social structures that embody
God’s intentions for the world.

It is possible to see in the Writings of the Central Figures of the Bahá’í
Faith the view that social structures are embodiments of thought, which
gather substance through generations of human decision making. Once
those structures are created, they influence both the thoughts and actions
of the people who live inside them. The character of thought determines
the character of the social structures. Self-interested, turning-away-from-
God thought gradually creates social structures which hold people in
unproductive, oppressive patterns of action. Humanity is liberated from
oppressive social structures by thought that comes from God: human
beings responding to the Will of God create social structures which
reshape human thinking, purify human actions, and gradually develop
alternative patterns of interaction and new social structures. In this per-
spective, religion is not a set of beliefs; rather it is a divine energy, a will,
that becomes realized in human action (Dunbar 10–11).

30            The Journal of Bahá’í Studies 19. 1/4. 2009

The concept that Divine Will acts on human agency to shape social
structures can be traced through the Authoritative Writings of the Bahá’í
Faith. The Universal House of Justice, asserting that solutions “for every
social problem” can be found in spiritual principle, explained that “[t]he
essential merit of spiritual principle is that it not only presents a perspec-
tive which harmonizes with that which is immanent in human nature, it
also induces an attitude, a dynamic, a will, an aspiration, which facilitate
the discovery and implementation of practical measures” (Promise par. 38).
Shoghi Effendi wrote to the Bahá’ís struggling to build the first House of
Worship in North America that worship would not be its “sole, nor even
the essential” function. Rather, the force generated by worship and the
energies focused on service to humanity would have to be in “direct and
constant interaction” to “provide the necessary agency capable of remov-
ing the ills that have so long and so grievously afflicted humanity” (Bahá’í
Administration 186). The necessity of giving concrete form to spiritual
truth is implied in a letter written on Shoghi Effendi’s behalf: “We cannot
segregate the human heart from the environment outside us and say that
once one of these is reformed everything will be improved. Man is organ-
ic with the world. His inner life moulds the environment and is itself also
deeply affected by it. The one acts upon the other and every abiding
change in the life of man is the result of these mutual reactions” (qtd. in
Conservation 15).

In The Secret of Divine Civilization, written to “produce fundamental
changes in the thinking and the behavior of society” (106–7), ‘Abdu’l-Bahá
asserts the constructive power of human thought and will,1 identifies reli-
gion as the source of qualities which benefit society,2 and defines lack of
religious faith and education as “the primary cause of oppression and injus-
tice, of unrighteousness, irregularity and disorder” (18).3 He cautions
against unthinking imitation of the past; describes the inculcation of just
patterns of political order as a slow, organic process; and prescribes educa-
tion as the mechanism that sets that process in motion.4 Bahá’u’lláh iden-
tifies the spiritual power that makes social transformation possible when
He states that human beings live, move, and have our being inside of the
love of the Manifestation of God and His law: “It is the warmth that these
Luminaries of God generate, and the undying fires they kindle, which cause

Enacting Thought                              31

the light of the love of God to burn fiercely in the heart of humanity. . . .
Through Him all things live, move, and have their being” (Kitáb-i-Íqán 34).
Similarly, Bahá’u’lláh writes of the Kitáb-i-Aqdas, “[I]t hath encompassed
all men ere their recognition of it“ (16). Our human lives are, potentially, a
movement outward from God’s will for us, which is the center of our real-
ity. When we achieve this, when our actions express the love of God which
animates us, we create societies characterized by justice.

Understanding humanity’s relationship to God in this way gives people
power to shape the world, while a more limited view of religion renders
people impotent. This paper argues that social structures which facilitate
justice would result from deliberate, continuous effort to implement the
will of God, and that oppressive structures are the result of generations of
self-interest, building on top of each other through imitation of the past.
After noting how materialism limits of our perception of human capacity
in the present, the paper examines two examples of historical processes
through which assertions of self-interest, imitated by following genera-
tions, established social structures. The first example examines the ori-
gins over three centuries of lack of political accountability in a sub-
Saharan polity. The second example uses ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s comments on
economy in the West and Shoghi Effendi’s description of the characteris-
tics of prevailing economic systems to view the well-known story of
industrialization in England as a “history of forgetting” the spiritual bases
of social organization. Having specified the “the hardened clay out of
which this perverse generation is molded,” the paper considers the actions
of newly enlivened human beings which would be “the touch of moisture”
capable of dissolving the oppression and tyranny which Bahá’u’lláh
deplored (Gleanings 93).

HOW MATERIALIST THOUGHT LIMITS OUR CONCEPTION

OF HUMAN CAPACITY

Currently predominant theories of human nature and social reality are so
profoundly materialistic that the logic of social action based on humani-
ty’s effort to conform to the Will of God may be difficult to grasp. It is
worth pausing, therefore, to examine how the Bahá’í Writings associate

32            The Journal of Bahá’í Studies 19. 1/4. 2009

humanity’s inability to act to solve its problems with a materialistic con-
ception of human nature. A spiritually dynamic civilization depends, of
course, on material means, but the excessive focus on the pursuit of mate-
rial things—and sometimes the denial that any other reality exists—pro-
foundly impedes human capacity. As the authors of Century of Light
observe, “Whether as world-view or simple appetite, materialism’s effect
is to leach out of human motivation—and even interest—the spiritual
impulses that distinguish the rational soul” (89–90). In The Promise of
World Peace, the Universal House of Justice identified “the social and eco-
nomic ills that blight every region of our world,” “apathy,” and “the extinc-
tion of hope” as the consequences of “the substitute faiths” which have
preached “the dogmas of materialism, whether of the east or the west,
whether of capitalism or socialism” (par. 20). In order to build a new
world, the House of Justice suggests we must clear away “the falsehood
that human beings are incorrigibly selfish and aggressive” (par. 22).
Shoghi Effendi in 1956 described the disorientation and powerlessness
that characterizes people focused on material pursuits: “[t]he gross mate-
rialism that engulfs the entire nation at the present hour; the attachment
to worldly things that enshrouds the souls of men; the fears and anxieties
that distract their minds; the pleasure and dissipations that fill their time,
the prejudices and animosities that darken their outlook, the apathy and
lethargy that paralyze their spiritual faculties. . . . (Citadel of Faith 149).
Engulfed, enshrouded, distracted, and paralyzed: without the vitalizing
force of faith, people cannot act.

Failure to understand our own true nature undermines humanity’s
capacity to create justice, and this is why keeping humanity from knowl-
edge of God is the greatest form of oppression. Bahá’u’lláh wrote that
there is no greater oppression than to be blocked from perceiving reality:
”What ‘oppression’ is more grievous than that a soul seeking the truth,
and wishing to attain unto the knowledge of God, should know not where
to go for it and from whom to seek it?” (Kitáb-i-Íqán 31). He described this
condition, writing that although the fingers of divine power have unlocked
the portals of the knowledge of God, the leaders of people, who busy
themselves with selfish calculation, maintain that the door of knowledge
is closed (29-30). He wrote: ”[V]oracious beasts have gathered and preyed

Enacting Thought                              33

upon the carrion of the souls of men” (31). He used this image to describe
the powerful religious leaders of Iran, who told people that Bahá’u’lláh
was not a Messenger from God. They maintained that the door of knowl-
edge was closed. Political leaders who focus attention on themselves as the
only hope for the people of their country are doing the same thing. The
leaders of thought who, through blind imitation, insist that humanity’s
future is the same as its past, hold the door of knowledge closed.
Advertisers who tell people that the only route to happiness is through the
purchase of particular products are also acting in self-interest, asserting a
falsehood about human reality. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá also described this condition:
“For the helpless masses know nothing of the world, and while there is no
doubt that they seek and long for their own happiness, yet ignorance like
a heavy veil shuts them away from it” (Secret 110). This description, of
humanity wrapped in ignorance and therefore unable to create happiness,
resonates with the profound description of the consequences of oppression
supplied by the Universal House of Justice, that over the long term
oppressed people “lose confidence in their own perception of themselves”
and become “drained of that spirit of initiative that is integral to human
nature” (Letter to the Followers).

According to the Bahá’í teachings, materialism can sometimes also
characterize religious communities. Although most people in the world
believe in God, the extreme materialism which orders our intellectual
lives distorts and diminishes even our perception of religion. We live in a
world characterized by functional atheism. This means that even though
people believe in God, they may not recognize or utilize the power of God
to illuminate and transform every aspect of reality. In his travels in the
United States in 1912, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá defined religion which does not result
in action that benefits the world as a form of materialism:

Consider to what a remarkable extent the spirituality of people has
> been overcome by materialism so that spiritual susceptibility seems to
> have vanished, divine civilization become decadent, and guidance and
> knowledge of God no longer remain. All are submerged in the sea of
> materialism. Although some attend churches and temples of worship
> and devotion, it is in accordance with the traditions and imitations of
34            The Journal of Bahá’í Studies 19. 1/4. 2009

> their fathers and not for the investigation of reality. . . . They are hold-
> ing to certain imitations which have descended to them from their
fathers and ancestors.

. . . [T]he darkness of imitations encompasses the world.
(Promulgation 221).

Investigation of reality, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá asserts, would enable people to
transcend the oppressive stagnation of imitation and the world would
change:

Were these various nations to investigate reality, there is no doubt
> they would attain to it. As reality is one, all nations would then
> become as one nation. So long as they adhere to various imitations
> and are deprived of reality, strife and warfare will continue and ran-
> cor and sedition prevail. If they investigate reality, neither enmity nor
> rancor will remain, and they will attain to the utmost concord among
> themselves. (Promulgation 221–22)

These passages demonstrate the power of thought in the construction of
social reality. If we were not “overcome by materialism,” we would per-
ceive a different reality than the one we perceive, and that would give us
the capacity to make the world different than it is.

THE ACCRETION OF IMPEDIMENTS TO POLITICAL AGENCY AND VOICE

The power of self-interested thought and actions to shape social struc-
tures is particularly evident in the realm of politics, as people in most
nations, even those that are putatively democracies, struggle to achieve
their aspiration to live in a well-governed society. In a 2007 letter, the
Universal House of Justice observed that

One of the signs of the breakdown of society in all parts of the
> world is the erosion of trust and collaboration between the individual
and the institutions of governance. In many nations the electoral

Enacting Thought                             35

> process has become discredited because of endemic corruption.
> Contributing to the widening distrust of so vital a process are the
> influence on the outcome from vested interests having access to lavish
> funds, the restrictions on freedom of choice inherent in the party sys-
> tem, and the distortion in public perception of the candidates by the
> bias expressed in the media. Apathy, alienation, and disillusionment
> are a consequence, too, as is a growing sense of despair of the unlike-
> lihood that the most capable citizens will emerge to deal with the man-
> ifold problems of a defective social order. (Letter to the Bahá’ís)

In order to trace one example of the layers of self-interested action that
have created this dynamic, we will examine the history of political
accountability in southern Uganda, where citizens have seemed to attain
greater political agency, but then lost it, more than once in living memo-
ry. Readers who are more familiar with the recent political history of other
world regions will undoubtedly find points of similarity.

The thoughtful, well-educated middle class of Uganda has many rea-
sons to be dissatisfied with the structures of governance they experi-
ence. Standards of living for most Ugandans are still lower than they
were one and two generations ago, before the nation experienced mas-
sive social disorder and war under a series of self-serving rulers. When
President Yoweri Museveni took control of the state in 1985 after fifteen
years of civil war, Ugandans hoped to create a nation that was account-
able, free from corruption, and that gave voice to the populace. While
ordinary citizens appreciate the peace that prevails in most of the coun-
try, many people have come to feel that responsible government is an
unattainable dream.

Museveni instituted a new form of governance, the lowest level of which
is the local council, a nine-person body which was, when it was first cre-
ated, elected from among all the people in a village or section of a town
with no electioneering. The local council (LC) was responsible for settling
local disputes, initiating activities for community well-being, and some
administration. Every person in the local district was supposed to partic-
ipate in regular meetings and people did so with great enthusiasm in the

36            The Journal of Bahá’í Studies 19. 1/4. 2009

first years after the system was introduced in the early 1990s. LCs organ-
ized water systems, punished local touts, and held their elected leaders
accountable. Over time, however, the Ugandan state changed the system:
some LC members became appointed rather than elected and people began
to perceive the LC as an instrument of the ruling party. The perceived
legitimacy of the system declined, and attendance at council meetings
dropped off.

Thoughtful Ugandans describe corruption as a highly infectious dis-
ease. “Eating” means taking the benefits of state office for one’s self, and a
prominent Ugandan parliamentarian, Winnie Byanyima, observed a few
years ago:

Sections of the press and some politicians have made “eating”
> acceptable and have placed it right at the centre of political debate.
> Struggling for the trappings of power is now at the centre stage, it
> has become acceptable and even fashionable. This eating is crude, self-
> centered, egoistic, shallow, narrow and ignorant. . . . we must do away
> with if we are to start a new nation. (qtd. in Tripp 1)

Sectarianism, which in Uganda means sharp political divisions between
Catholics and Protestants, and between people from different regions, is
also a concern. Again, Winnie Byanyima said, “What I observe is that eth-
nicity is being used to provide platforms from which the amenities of
modernity can be competed for.” She said it was playing “a perverse role”
in political development, and that “we politicians are sometimes promot-
ing [it] for narrow self-interest” (qtd. in Tripp 124).

Like the citizens of many nations, Ugandans who want to contribute to
the well-being of their country through participation in its governance
face severe structural constraints. Their choices as voters are limited, as
members of the ruling party have clearly gained from their positions, but
the leaders of all other political parties seem to be focused entirely on their
own benefit as well. People who see the misuse of public funds may risk
their jobs if they speak out. The transfer of wealth from rural agricul-
tural producers to the urban elite, a facet of the Ugandan economy for a

century, continues, with rural people distracted and pacified by the ethnic
and sectarian slogans of politicians (Kasozi 43).

The political constraints that Ugandans now face have a history. The
problem is not, as some would assert, that Ugandans have not yet learned
how to rule themselves in an effective way. Nor is it valid, as others would
assert, to entirely blame colonial rulers for their deliberate destruction of
African forms of governance, as significant as that was. Several hundred
years of the assertion of self-interest, and significant moments of uncriti-
cal imitation, created the political conditions of the present. In the king-
dom of Buganda, now part of Uganda, people lost important forms of
political accountability as a consequence of war in the eighteenth century,
other practices fundamental to good government were lost under British
colonial rule, and post-colonial politicians have also made their own con-
tribution to the current situation.

In the kingdom of Buganda, kings ruled with the consent of their peo-
ple until the eighteenth century, when kings began to bring home war cap-
tives and settle them as their personal slaves in private provinces that ben-
efitted only the ruler himself. This led to almost one hundred years of
upheaval, as various factions in the kingdom fought to control the kingship
and its spoils. As a result of these wars, people lost their ability to make
their rulers accountable, kings became despotic, and chiefship became
much more rigid and hierarchical than it had ever been before. The actions
of eighteenth-century kings created the absolute power of the king and the
increased power of chiefs over their people, but people do not remember a
beginning to these conditions. The kings’ assertion of self-interest became
part of the structure of the society (Hanson, Landed Obligation 86).

The Buganda kingdom lost other dimensions of government accounta-
bility during British colonial rule. For many years after a British
Protectorate was declared in 1896, Ganda chiefs thought of British offi-
cers as their friends and partners. They invited the British officers to
prayers, Bible study, and tea, and tried to model to the British how good
rulers behaved toward their people. The character of chiefship changed as
the British gained power over the people of Buganda. The British govern-
ment required colonies and protectorates to be financially self-sufficient,

38            The Journal of Bahá’í Studies 19. 1/4. 2009

so Ganda people paid taxes and performed forced labor to provide salaries
and services for colonial officers. This work, especially the forced labor,
impoverished many people because they did not have time to do that work
and also raise their own crops and take care of their affairs. Chiefs had to
stop doing what chiefs were supposed to do in Uganda—which was to
protect their people—and instead took the action of calling out forced
labor, which harmed their people. Chiefship became coercive. Precolonial
chiefs had demonstrated their power through redistribution, giving feasts
and gifts to followers. Colonial chiefs began to assert their power through
fines, and, for the first time, people were forbidden to leave their chiefs.
Colonial officers, and some postcolonial rulers, have shown their power by
having fabulous wealth in comparison with the people they rule. A funda-
mentally self-interested way of thinking—that rulers needed comfortable,
somewhat ostentatious lifestyles, whatever the cost to the people they
were ruling—became the pattern for African rulers who took over from
the colonizers. It was an assertion of self and also blind imitation that ben-
efited a few at the expense of the whole society.

One of the premises of good government in Buganda in the precolonial
period was that decisions should emerge from consensus, and long, long
discussions about every issue were part of governing. The British intro-
duced Westminster-style parliamentary practice, which enabled one fac-
tion of Ganda chiefs to completely dominate the parliament. In 1927, a
diverse group of Ganda thinkers brought a case against these dominating
chiefs. The essence of their complaint was that Ganda government had
been better before the British came, and if the British really wanted
progress for the country, they would allow a return to Ganda practices.
They said the collaborating chiefs had “upset everything and as the results
of that mistake caused the present ill feeling which exists among our peo-
ple as a whole, shattering also our country from its former foundation and
destroying all our good customs of helping and loving each other, thus
putting us under a form of Government which we cannot understand. We
feel as if we were under the hybrid customs.”5 Early in the twentieth cen-
tury, Ganda thinkers saw that the premise of Ganda government, which
focused on drawing people into a group and convincing them to stay
there, had been undermined.

The politicians who came to power after independence in 1962 perpet-
uated the extreme differences in wealth and power which had character-
ized colonial rule. They exercised power through domination, rather than
through consensus, as Okot pBitek describes in his famous poem, The
Defence of Lawino:

> If the party bosses have dedicated themselves to developing our land
> Why don’t they discuss it in peace?
> Family conferences, do people usually shout when holding them?
> Don’t elders deliberate at length, taking turns?
> Whoever shouts in such discussions is possessed;
> His sense has left him: he’s beside himself !
> For, that’s not the way to make peace and communal understanding
The true leader is humble, at peace with all, listens to complaints!

(93)

The modern right to vote sometimes gives ordinary people a less sig-
nificant voice in governance than they had in precolonial practices of
extensive consultation. As M. Owusu observes,

Beyond the ritual exercise of their right to vote, which often
> has very little meaning, most poor and powerless Africans, especial-
> ly illiterate women, have very little say in the formulation and imple-
> mentation of policies which directly affect their welfare. The truth is,
> of course, that the electoral system benefits immediately only the
> members of the educated middle classes and the rich, because they
> are generally the “bosses” of any party apparatus. (qtd. in Abra-
> hamsen 85)

The lack of political voice and power which most non-elite Africans expe-
rience stands in significant contrast to the level of their participation in
earlier times in their history, when women and men contributed in consul-
tative groups, anyone concerned participated in the judgment of cases, and
chiefs and people could hold their rulers accountable by choosing to with-
hold necessary labor and tribute.

40            The Journal of Bahá’í Studies 19. 1/4. 2009

The lack of political accountability in Uganda in the present is the result
of a long heritage of self-interested thought and blind imitation.
Explaining that national and racial distinctions originate in selfish behav-
ior, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá said, “These boundary lines and artificial barriers have
been created by despots and conquerors who sought to attain dominion
over mankind, thereby engendering patriotic feeling and rousing selfish
devotion to merely local standards of government.” He went on to point
out that “[a]s a rule they themselves enjoyed luxuries in palaces, surround-
ed by conditions of ease and affluence, while armies of soldiers civilians and
tillers of the soil fought and died at their command upon the field of battle,
shedding their innocent blood for a delusion. . . .” (Promulgation 354).
Political vitality in Uganda is impeded by many artificial boundaries creat-
ed by people who sought dominion over others. The practice of chiefship as
domineering rule over others is a residue of the self-interested action of
eighteenth-century kings. The willingness of British imperial entrepre-
neurs, colonial officers, and post-independence politicians to absorb a pre-
ponderating share of national resources has bred a culture of corruption.
The nineteenth-century fights between Catholics, Protestants, and
Muslims, and the exploitation of those differences by twentieth-century
politicians, has divided Ugandan society and curtailed political expression.

Structures that direct the aspirations of political leaders to focus on the
well-being of the whole society are needed to move Uganda’s public fig-
ures to act on behalf of all the people, not only of the people who voted for
them. Spiritual and moral discipline would allow public figures to be con-
tent with modest remuneration, and not seek to benefit financially from
their positions. If Ugandans and international agencies could see their
own well-being in the well-being of the whole and focus resources on the
least-developed regions of the country, the sources of sectarian tension
would be removed. Such spiritual and moral discipline might enable devel-
opment agencies that design their forms of assistance to attract attention
to themselves to let go of their need to control, abandon the unquestioned
assumption that their own way of doing things is superior, and provide
long-term support to fund infrastructure.
People everywhere face the challenge faced by Ugandans, which is to

express their innate capacity to contribute to the stable organization of
society, without waiting for their leaders to assent. Although our habits of
thought imagine political power as narrow, sectarian, and state-centered,
the power to organize people and influence the way they think and act is
available to all those who recognize their capacity to do so. Political power
in its deepest sense—the agglomeration of the will of people to organize
themselves in a particular way to further social order—would be, if we
chose to perceive it, an arena of human activity that is deeply amenable to
the promptings of the spirit. This reordering of human motivations and
relationships is at the heart of the activities carried out by Bahá’ís and their
co-workers in neighborhoods and villages. Shoghi Effendi foreshadowed
this potential when he described that community as aware of the “society-
building power that their Faith possesses” (World Order 194). Groups of
people who devote themselves to furthering a vision of social justice with
pure intentions, humility, a sense of responsibility, and a deliberate avoid-
ance of distinctions among people have influence far beyond their numbers.

The Bahá’í Revelation contains numerous references regarding the
power wielded by groups united to assert spiritual principle. One tremen-
dously significant example is the statement by the Universal House of
Justice in The Promise of World Peace that the consequence of the people of
the world asking their leaders to gather to make arrangements for a sta-
ble world peace, and those leaders doing so, “can release such a salutary
spirit among the peoples of the earth that no power could resist the final,
triumphal outcome” (par. 47). In The Secret of Divine Civilization ‘Abdu’l-
Bahá asserts that when people are “genuinely religious and are literate and
well-schooled” (18), they cannot be oppressed because they would know
how to ask authorities for redress in a way that would evoke a positive
response. In a world in which most of our practices of governance are per-
verse, corrupt, unjust, and polarizing, the possibilities for providing alter-
native models derived from the Will of God are immense.

The modern nation state of Uganda is imprisoned in social structures
which are encrustations of self-interest. Some of the oppressive structures
are modern, some come from the period of European imperialism, and
others are older, a consequence of actions of this generation’s African

ancestors. The unquestioned assumption that the partisan politics of
Europe and North America provide the best model for humanity burdens
the citizens of polities all around the world. But even people who live
inside these structures can invoke spiritual principle, create alternatives,
and act on them.

MATERIALIST MODERNITY: A HISTORY OF FORGETTING

Our second example of the creation of social structures as an assertion of
thought concerns the creation of the modern world economy. In the nine-
teenth century, the discovery of new technologies caused one of the great-
est transformations in human history. Physical distances lost their mean-
ing through railroads, steam-powered ships, and the telegraph; the indus-
trialized production of cloth and other goods reduced the labor necessary
for subsistence to a fraction of what it had previously been. These new
technological capabilities gave humanity the capacity to create a tightly
integrated, dynamic, and prosperous world civilization, and Bahá’u’lláh
associated them with His Revelation, writing: “Such arts and material
means as are now manifest have been achieved by virtue of His knowledge
and wisdom which have been revealed in Epistles and Tablets through His
Most Exalted Pen—a Pen out of whose treasury pearls of wisdom and
utterance and the arts and crafts of the world are brought to light” (Tablets
39) Contemporary observers, although unaware of the real source, recog-
nized the profound and all-encompassing nature of the change: the influ-
ential diplomat and author Henry Adams dated it to 23 May 1844, when
the first telegraph message was sent.

It is essential to carefully consider the spiritual import of this pro-
found social transformation. The exchange of goods in markets in which
individuals and groups of individuals organized as corporations operate
on their own initiative (which is the essence of capitalism), and the indus-
trialized production of goods, contain great potential for human progress.
But the promise of these innovations has not been met, as the authors of
Century of Light attest:

> [W]hat Bahá’ís see in present-day society is unbridled exploitation of
> the masses of humanity by greed that excuses itself as the operation
> of “impersonal market forces.” What meets their eyes everywhere is
> the destruction of moral foundations vital to humanity’s future,
> through gross self-indulgence masquerading as “freedom of speech.”
> What they find themselves struggling against daily is the pressure of
> a dogmatic materialism, claiming to be the voice of “science,” that
> seeks systematically to exclude from intellectual life all impulses aris-
> ing from the spiritual level of human consciousness. (136)

In the early twenty-first century, we see all around us the fulfillment of
Bahá’u’lláh’s warning, that “[i]f carried to excess, civilization will prove as
prolific a source of evil as it had been of goodness when kept within the
restraints of moderation” (Gleanings 342–43).

One way of thinking about the transformations that brought us to our
current organization of society is that they were inevitable, they have had
overall positive consequences, and their current shortcomings are in the
process of being corrected. History textbooks tend to describe the indus-
trial revolution in this way. Illustrated with advertisements seeking “fam-
ilies with many children for factory work,” quoting journalists’ exposés
concerning the squalid conditions in early industrial cities, and with a
drawing of the cotton gin next to one of slaves on a plantation, the mes-
sage conveyed might be formulated as, “Yes, many people suffered in
Europe and around the world to create modern industrial society, but the
end result was positive: we are all the beneficiaries of this increase in mate-
rial wealth and freedom for individuals.” An interpretation of the Bahá’í
writings which adopts a similar view of nineteenth-century economic his-
tory emphasizes the positive: the conditions in factories in Europe eventu-
ally improved, and the working class won political rights. From this per-
spective, the economic structures humanity created to make use of new
technology are evolving, and the necessary modification will be made
gradually as humanity becomes aware of the standard of justice inculcat-
ed by Bahá’u’lláh.6

44            The Journal of Bahá’í Studies 19. 1/4. 2009

An alternative interpretation of economic history is also possible.

Applying the theory regarding the construction of social structures pro-
posed in this paper, the structures of industrial capitalism, which we take for
granted, and which appear to be utterly natural, can be seen to be the cre-
ation of people who allowed self-interest to dominate their actions. The
effects of those actions endured, solidified over generations, and we live
inside of them. Humanity could have had the positive dimensions of indus-
trialization and economic intensification without the negative social conse-
quences if people had made different moral choices about how they used the
new technologies they had created. The impoverishment and debasement of
the masses of workers who produced cloth and other goods on a large scale
would not have happened if the dignity and worth of laborers had been
respected in the organization of factories. The global economic imbalance
caused by the production of commodities in the tropics and the production
of industrial products in the north would not have happened if all the par-
ticipants in the emerging world economy had been treated equitably.

To observe that failures of moral judgment contributed to the shape of
our current world economy, which is largely a product of capitalist forms
of economic organization, does not imply that communism or socialism,
especially as we experienced them in the twentieth century, were superi-
or—they were not.7 Humanity has not yet created an economic system
which uses our vastly increased technological capacities in ways that are
conducive to human well-being. And while it may be true that the eco-
nomic conditions of some people in some parts of the world are evolving
for the better, the gap between the poor majority and the rich minority
continues to widen. A system which allows 10 percent of the world’s pop-
ulation to control 85 percent of the world’s wealth (which means that 90
percent of the world’s people control only 15 percent of the wealth)
(Davies et al.) does not meet Bahá’u’lláh’s standard, “If thine eyes be
turned towards justice, choose thou for thy neighbor that which thou
choosest for thyself ” (Tablets 64).

In order to perceive the role of self-interested thought in the creation of
the structures of our current world economy, it will be useful to first con-
sider the characteristics of economic structures delineated in the Bahá’í
Writings. For example, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá stated: “The fundamentals of the

whole economic condition are divine in nature and are associated with the
world of the heart and spirit,” and He goes on in the same talk to exhort
His listeners to “[m]anifest true economics to the people. Show what love
is, what kindness is, what true severance is and generosity” (Promulgation
239). The concept that economic conditions are associated with the world
of the heart and the spirit and that true economics is love, kindness, true
severance, and generosity becomes easier to understand when we place it
in the context of statements made by ‘Abdu’l-Bahá in The Secret of Divine
Civilization. There ‘Abdu’l-Bahá wrote that “[w]ealth is praiseworthy in
the highest degree, if it is acquired by an individual’s own efforts and the
grace of God, in commerce, agriculture, art and industry, and if it be
expended for philanthropic purposes,” and He continued: “Wealth is most
commendable, provided the entire population is wealthy.” He stated that
unless wealth was dedicated to the welfare of society, it would only prove
a liability to its possessor (24–25). Explaining that the true purpose of civ-
ilization is to create human happiness through the instrumentality of
virtue, He wrote that despite “their [European] vaunted civilization . . . all
the phenomena of their culture come to nothing” (Secret 60).

Observations ‘Abdu’l-Bahá made in His travels in the West amplify this
statement. He explained, over and over again, that the material civilization
of the West was not productive. He stated this explicitly: “Material civi-
lization alone is not sufficient and will not prove productive” (Promulgation
166), and through analogies—it was a lamp that was not lighted, a beau-
tiful body that was not alive: “Material civilization is like the body. No
matter how infinitely graceful, elegant and beautiful it may be, it is dead.
Divine civilization is the spirit, and the body gets its life from the spirit,
otherwise it becomes a corpse” (Selections 227.22). By considering the
implication of these statements together, it is possible to arrive at the con-
clusion that economic activity is only productive when it has positive spir-
itual consequences as well as positive material consequences. In order to
breathe life into the dead body of material civilization, all our productive
activity has to have positive social consequences.

Another way to understand ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s statement that true econom-
ics is love, kindness, severance, and generosity is to recognize that all eco-
nomic actions are also social actions; they involve people interacting with

46            The Journal of Bahá’í Studies 19. 1/4. 2009

each other. All economic activity, all of the things people do which involve
production of things and exchange of things and adding value to things,
create social relationships. The social consequences of economic activity
can be positive or negative, but they are never neutral. Farming with the
intention of sustaining people creates positive social relationships. Trading
with a concern for the needs of the producers for a just price creates posi-
tive social relationships. In contrast, trading by squeezing producers and
deceiving consumers creates negative social relationships. A factory which
allocates all the profit to stockholders and leaves the workers with bare
subsistence creates negative social relationships. But that same factory
could be a source of positive social relationships if management provided
for the workers adequately and shared profits with them. One way of
understanding ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s observation that material civilization alone
is not productive would be that producing material things in a way that has
negative social consequences does not count as production. The only forms
of production that really count—the only phenomena that have results—
are ones which enhance human relationships as well as producing goods.
If we take this as the criterion for economic activity, it makes sense to think
of true economics as love, kindness, and generosity.

Turning now to the modern history of economic transformation, we can
see that before the technological, economic, and social changes that made
the modern world, the concept that productive activity created social rela-
tionships was familiar to most people. Craftspeople produced crafts inside
guilds; peasants produced crops in relationships with each other and, in
some societies, in relationship with lords; and people carried gifts to their
chiefs. In current thinking, economic production with the motivation of
solidifying social relationships is often termed primitive, and economic
production to serve the individual interests of the owner of the means of
production is termed modern. Capitalism means the organization of eco-
nomic activity in a way that individuals or corporations, not states, own the
materials that produce wealth, make decisions about production, and the
exchange of goods happens in a free market, without restriction. A refram-
ing of modernity, along the lines outlined by ‘Abdu’l-Bahá in The Secret of
Divine Civilization, suggests there is another alternative approach to mod-
ern economic relationships. Truly modern economic activity would unite

the freedom of choice we associate with the present and the sense that eco-
nomic activity always creates social relationships, which has at present
been forgotten.

This forgetting is the intellectual history of the modern world. It is pos-
sible to see, as people wrestled with new technology and the new social
structures that came with them, individuals making choices which privi-
leged their own interests above those of a larger group. Furthermore,
those choices of self over others were imitated unthinkingly by subsequent
generations and led to an erasure of aspects of social order built on the
recognition that economic activity manifests love and builds social rela-
tionships. In one of his last messages, Shoghi Effendi identified forgetting
the spiritual bases of society as an aspect of the ever-increasing emphasis
on material well-being of all the forms of modern economic organization,
both capitalism as it was practiced in the United States and communism
as it was practiced in the USSR. In a letter to believers in the US, he wrote
about what humanity loses in a materialistically oriented economy:

Parallel with this [deterioration of morality], and pervading all
> departments of life—an evil which the nation, and indeed all those
> within the capitalist system, though to a lesser degree, share with
> that state and its satellites regarded as the sworn enemies of that sys-
> tem—is the crass materialism, which lays excessive and ever-increas-
> ing emphasis on material well-being, forgetful of those things of the
> spirit on which alone a sure and stable foundation can be laid for
> human society. (Citadel of Faith 124–25)

Shoghi Effendi highlights not only the ever-increasing emphasis on
material well-being, but also the corollary of that materialism, which is
that it causes forgetfulness of those things of the spirit which are the only
stable and sure foundation for society. The self-interest of industrialists a
century ago has hardened into economic theory and practice which
diminishes our understanding of human possibilities in the present. To
understand the reality of the modern world economy, therefore, we have
to look for what we have forgotten regarding the spiritual foundations of
a stable society.

A transformation in how people used natural resources in Northern
Europe was a crucial part of the beginning of capitalism. Patterns of land
use that involved many different people using the same land in complex
ways changed into a pattern of land use in which one person was the
owner and sole controller of a specific piece of land. One famous example
occurred in Scotland: the Duchess of Sutherland claimed ownership of
794,000 acres, evicted 15,000 people by burning their homes and villages
and destroying their crops, and replaced them with 131,000 sheep
(Perelman 142). The people who succeeded in enclosing land—depriving
anyone else of rights to use it—became very much richer, and the people
who lost their rights to sustenance became very, very much poorer and
entirely lost their capacity to control their productive lives. Enclosure was
an assertion of self-interest. Its structural consequences have been pro-
found. It criminalized forms of collaborative resource use, and the regions
where sheep replaced communities of farmers carrying out high-intensity
mixed farming never regained their capacity to create prosperity for large
numbers of people.

Loss of common lands and rural communities, as well as the push into
wage labor, eroded social networks and habits of cooperation. When most
people lost their access to any productive resources except their own labor,
and wealth became more concentrated, relationships between people that
in the past had had social and economic dimensions became solely eco-
nomic. This process is called commodification: it means that aspects of life
which had many kinds of value, such as people’s ability to work, came to
have only a monetary value. When groups of people worked in turns on
each other’s fields, and worked together on common fields, that work had
social value as well as productive value. It had maintained the connec-
tions among members of a community. Capitalist production replaced the
social motivations for working with merely material motivations for
working, which undermined or destroyed forms of community interac-
tion. Karl Polanyi’s influential analysis of modern economic history
described this process as “the smashing up of social structures in order to
extract the element of labor from them”; he asserted that what European
powers did in their colonies in the early twentieth century “was done in

the eighteenth century to white populations by white men for similar
purposes” (172).

The way we industrialized, and the ways cities grew in order to accom-
modate workers, intensified the destruction of social networks and the
transition to an insistently individualistic organization of society.
Suddenly, in the mid-nineteenth century, people had to figure out how to
use the technological capacity of new kinds of engines and new kinds of
tools. We had to create a new pattern of working to use these new techno-
logical capacities. We could have created industrial production with a
sharing of profits between workers and owners, so that a new kind of pro-
duction wove a more solid social fabric, instead of eroding it. We could
have created working conditions for the new workers that allowed them to
maintain relationships of mutual support, and forms of community soli-
darity, instead of grinding cooperative social practices into non-existence.
The technology would have worked just as well that way. Instead, we cre-
ated forms of industrial production in which all the profits went to own-
ers and workers were barely able to stay alive as they worked. This asser-
tion of self-interest has been perpetuated in the “hardened clay” of rigid
extremes of wealth and poverty, social class conflict, and excessive indi-
vidualism. While it is true that, over time, industrial workers in some
nations did win rights of political representation that led to improved
working conditions, the social and moral characteristics of preindustrial
work organization never reappeared—those ‘things of the spirit’ had
been forgotten.

The massive suffering and impoverishment caused by early industrial-
ization created a moral dilemma for Europeans who observed it. Michael
Perelman demonstrates in The Invention of Capitalism that Adam Smith’s
assertion of the autonomy of markets in The Wealth of Nations was actual-
ly a defense of the evolving economic order written in opposition to the
work of contemporary thinkers who made a more determined effort to
document the social consequences of enclosure and early industrialization
(Perelman 174). Perelman describes the work of James Steuart, who
observed that capitalist farming became profitable by depriving people of
the capacity for self-provisioning, and suggested that statesmen were

50            The Journal of Bahá’í Studies 19. 1/4. 2009

needed to organize the population so that poor people would work but not
starve: “‘[T]he more soberly our lowest classes are made to live at all times,
the cheaper may our manufactures be sold’” (qtd. in Perelman 154).
Steuart’s point—that paying people less made manufacturing more prof-
itable—was not easy for the early economists (who were called moral
philosophers) to explain. Eventually, classical economic theorists repudi-
ated the moral objections to the harm caused by early capitalism by argu-
ing about economies using analogies of animal conflict. Their theories left
out human capacity to transcend the self and to recognize and care for the
social whole. They forgot the true purpose of work.

The immense productivity of industry created another problem. How
could the production of goods continue to be profitable when so much had
been produced that no one needed any more? If everyone had clothing,
how could the textile mill that produced cloth keep operating? The
extremely high costs of equipment for industry intensified the importance
of this question. Over time, one solution to this problem that emerged
was the advertising industry. If people came to believe that meeting their
subsistence needs was not enough, that they would be better people, hap-
pier, freer, and more alive, if they bought more things, then a market could
be created for any amount of industrial production. Part of the history of
the past hundred years is our increasing commitment to this manipulation
of our reality. We have developed forms of economic organization that
require constantly increasing rates of consumption. It can be argued that
everything about the productive systems in which we live, from the meas-
ure of gross national product to the advertising we see every day, to the
way that we live on the landscape, asks us to think of ourselves as bundles
of needs that can be met through purchases. As ‘Abdu’l-Bahá observed,
“[M]aterial forces have attacked mankind” (Promulgation 12). The organi-
zation of the laws, structures, and habits of our economy, its forms of
information and its built environment, all perpetuate this fabrication.
Growth-oriented, consumption-driven capitalism endangers the planet
and dehumanizes all of humanity while providing immense wealth to a few.

Critical social theorists argue that the modern world economic system
dehumanizes people through replacing social bonds with economic ones

and through urging people to find satisfaction in consumption. For
example, in 1964 Theodor Adorno argued that the economic, political,
and cultural manifestations of advanced capitalism undermined the indi-
vidual, destroyed personal freedom, and made critical thought impossible.
People could not arrive at productive self-awareness because they used
commodified culture to find escape from purposeless work (“Culture
Industry Reconsidered”). In 1957, Shoghi Effendi had lamented “the evil
forces which a relentless and all-pervasive materialism, the cancerous
growth of militant racialism, political corruption, unbridled capitalism,
wide-spread lawlessness and gross immorality, are, alas, unleashing, with
ominous swiftness, amongst various classes of the society. . . .” (Citadel 154).
Offered only materialistic ways of thinking about the purpose of work and
the purpose of life, people in currently existing capitalist societies accom-
modate themselves to a grossly diminished experience of human reality.

To begin to create forms of economic interaction conducive to human
well-being, we need to reassert the spiritual realities that our practice of
unrestrained capitalism has caused us to forget. A fundamental step in this
process is to recognize that economies are embedded in social systems: we
cannot think about economic production as one reality and the rest of soci-
ety as something distinct from it. Part of our blind imitation of the past has
been to assent to the idea that economic prosperity and material well-being
require that some people will be out of work and poor, but this is not the
foundation of a stable society, and it does not conform to Bahá’u’lláh’s stan-
dard of justice. Although the habits of thought which are part of capitalism
as it is currently understood tell us that economic activity can be beneficial
even when its social consequences are negative, a more valid perception,
one that pays attention to those things of the spirit which are the only foun-
dation for a stable society, would be that economic activity is only produc-
tive when it has positive social consequences. If we consider what it means
to follow ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s injunction to “[m]anifest true economics to the
people. Show what love is, what kindness is, what true severance is and gen-
erosity” (Promulgation 239), possibilities for action open up to us.

The implications of these instructions are much more profound than
merely retaining the capitalism we have but urging the rich to give more

52            The Journal of Bahá’í Studies 19. 1/4. 2009

to the poor. A deliberate and systematic permeation of economic interac-
tions by love, severance, and generosity would transform human society
in profound ways. If we all took care to ensure that our own interactions
were characterized by love, severance, and generosity, it would change the
way human beings think about themselves, because attention to love in
our productive lives would make us aware that happiness does not come
from owning things or satisfying desires, but from serving others. It
would change the structure of wealth inside the nation, inside cities, and
around the world, because the impulse towards generosity on the part of
those who have more than they need would facilitate the creation of pros-
perity where it does not now exist. The elimination of extremes of wealth
and poverty would create stability and lead to profound improvements in
health. If economic interactions were characterized by love, severance, and
generosity, it would restructure the geographical organization of econom-
ic activity because productive units that build positive social relationships
would probably happen more fundamentally inside regions, rather than on
a global scale. It would require a change in the structure of ownership,
because stockholders would not be content to receive profits from compa-
nies that might be treating workers unjustly, and would demand more
knowledge. Industrial processes would change, with a goal of drawing in
the intelligence and creative capacity of workers, instead of seeking to
replace workers with machines. We would have to redefine the measure of
economic success because people seeking to show love, severance, and
generosity might decide that efficiency is an empty goal. It might lead us
to producing less, but of higher quality.

A small, wealthy segment of the world’s population benefits from thick-
ly encrusted structures of materialism that naturalize their wealth and the
poverty of others. Deliberate, focused action can change those structures.
We can act with love as participants in a local economy, building sustain-
ing relationships with businesses that give life to our communities. We can
act with love as consumers, making sure that the firms we endorse with
our purchases act responsibly in their relationship with producers. We can
act with love in creating meaningful bonds of support among people in our
neighborhoods because economic vitality develops where links among

people are strong. If we are Bahá’ís, we can participate in a world-encom-
passing structure that counteracts the spiritual and physical effects of
materialism by offering Huqúqu’lláh.8 We gain this power as economic
actors by refusing to imitate, by rejecting the commodification of our real-
ity in a consumption-oriented society.

HUMAN AGENCY AND DIVINE WILL

The processes that create injustice are gradual, almost imperceptible in
their operation, and they shape our reality. This awareness illuminates the
tremendous power of Bahá’u’lláh’s injunction to see the world through the
lens of justice:

> O Son of Spirit!

The best beloved of all things in My sight is Justice; turn not away
> therefrom if thou desirest Me, and neglect it not that I may confide in
> thee. By its aid thou shalt see with thine own eyes and not through
> the eyes of others, and shalt know of thine own knowledge and not
> through the knowledge of thy neighbor. Ponder this in thy heart, how
> it behooveth thee to be. Verily, justice is My gift to thee and the sign
> of My loving-kindness. Set it then before thine eyes. (Hidden Words,
> Persian no. 2)

To strive to see with our own eyes and not through the eyes of our neigh-
bors opens the possibility that we will recognize tyranny and oppression
that masquerade as ordinary reality. Recognizing justice as the avenue of
our connection to God, we are motivated to take actions that create it in
the world.

An essential first step in putting into effect the interaction of Divine
Will and human agency which facilitates justice is to consider whether we
incorporate human agency in our explanations of how the Faith works in
the world. For example, there is no causality in the statement “Bahá’ís
believe in the equality of the sexes.” It leaves out the implication of faith
in the world, the dimension of human action. To highlight that agency, we

54            The Journal of Bahá’í Studies 19. 1/4. 2009

need to say: “We believe in the equality of the sexes, and we are confident
that our love of God and our devotion to justice will enable us to overcome
oppressive habits of thought and action, and allow us to create new and
equitable patterns for our personal lives and the life of society.” To per-
ceive the Faith as a divine energy being imprinted on the world opens a
realm of powerful action that is not present when we think and speak
about the Faith as a set of beliefs.9

We also need to avoid making truncated statements, where we offer a
beautiful vision but omit what Bahá’u’lláh says about the power of true
religion to realize that vision. For example, we often quote “The earth is
but one country, and mankind its citizens” without the preceding sen-
tences, which state that “the welfare, security and protection of mankind
and the safety of human lives” require rulers and people to act with jus-
tice and equity (Bahá’u’lláh, Tablets 167). We often quote “Ye are the fruits
of one tree, and the leaves of one branch” but almost never include
Bahá’u’lláh’s wish, expressed in the next sentence, “We cherish the hope
that the light of justice may shine upon the world and sanctify it from
tyranny” (Tablets 164). What human beings are supposed to do is an essen-
tial part of Bahá’u’lláh’s statements. The world becomes one country
through human beings’ actions to serve the entire human race. It is human
beings’ obligation to respond to Bahá’u’lláh’s hope and eliminate tyranny
that will demonstrate we are the leaves of one branch. In order to effec-
tively assume the responsibilities that God has given us, we must be care-
ful to incorporate Bahá’u’lláh’s statements regarding human action when
we think and speak about the Revelation.

CONCLUSION

Injustice is not inherent in societies. It is not inevitable, something that
arrives like bad weather and there is nothing people can do about it. People
create injustice through selfish thought that shapes human action and
human institutions. Oppressive social structures build up, layer by layer,
and people live inside them and consider them to be natural. At present,
people generally do not question that rulers have vastly more wealth than

the ruled, that competition among politicians is the means of ensuring
good governance, or that democracy requires voting but not consultation
by the entire populace. They accept that media are dominated by advertis-
ers, that the purpose of work is individual accumulation, and that a few
people have extreme wealth and most have very little. They perceive reli-
gion as a particular form of possession that they can choose and use in
ways that suit their personal spiritual inclinations, and they assign respon-
sibility for changing the world to God and not to themselves.

This exploration of the history of social structures suggests that, all
over the world, human beings live within the boundaries of hardened pat-
terns of thought and habits of action which are the embodiment of self-
interest and greed. Our political lives, productive lives, social lives, and
even our experience of our own selves as believers in God are shaped by
layers and layers of self-interest. We live inside them—engulfed, enshroud-
ed, and paralyzed. This diagnosis need not alarm us, however, because we
also live inside the reality of the will and love of the Manifestation of God.
Human beings “live by the operation of Their Will, and move and have
their being through the outpourings of Their grace” (Bahá’u’lláh,
Gleanings 176).10 When we think and act in conformity with the Word of
God in our own lives, we liberate ourselves. When we work in groups, sys-
tematically and deliberately, to implement the Word of God, we create
social institutions which reflect God’s intentions for the world.

7. Criticizing “extreme socialists and communists” as well as “the other
extreme tendency represented by the ‘Laissez-faire’ or individualistic school of
economics,” Shoghi Effendi wrote: “[I]ndividualism and socialism, therefore do
not offer the right solution to the economic problem. In both the democratic and
fascist countries today, there is a growing tendency towards over-control, and
even increasing ownership of the means of production, and such tendency cannot
be fully sanctioned by the believers.” He states that “In the Bahá’í economic sys-
tem of the future, private ownership will be retained, but will be controlled, reg-
ulated, and even restricted” (qtd. in Badi’i 106–7).
