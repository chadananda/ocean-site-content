Styles of piety
Notes on the relationship between Baha’i scholars and the
Baha’i institutions with reference to academic methodology1
ĀāĪīŌōŪūḍḤḥṢṣṬṭẒẓ

Abstract
This paper addresses very broadly a number of issues in contemporary Baha’i scholarship. The
approach here is allusive rather than categorical. Starting from the denigration of ‘blind faith’ by
Baha’u’llah, the intellectual heritage of the Islamic world is held up as both mirror and example (both
positive and negative) for approaching current problems and questions arising from an encounter
between scholarship and administrative authority. Some thoughts are expressed touching upon the
role of the scholar in the community. The phenomenon of the Internet is briefly discussed. The article
ends with some reflection on the idea or institution of the Covenant.

On the subject of methodology one can do no better than draw attention to a sacred tradition that the
Bab was fond of quoting; the prophet Muhammad is reported as having said: ‘The Paths to God are as
numerous as the very breaths of His creatures’. One of the more appealingly progressive, if not
‘postmodern’ features of the Baha’i Faith is the institutionalized self-consciousness that is built into
the teachings. Such calls to mind the striking and perhaps even troubling image of the aware foetus
introduced a half-century ago by the science-fiction writer Arthur C. Clarke. Baha’is believe that the
Baha’i Faith of today is evolving or developing into what it is destined to become; and what it is
destined to become is intimately connected with something referred to as a New World Order. While
there is no precise blueprint or clear and precise image for this future, the Universal House of Justice
has indicated its ‘apophatic’ nature in a statement largely devoted to the nature of deepening:

> A detailed and exact knowledge of the present structure of Bahá’í administration, or of the
> bylaws of national and local spiritual assemblies, or of the many and varied applications of
> Bahá’í law under the diverse conditions prevailing around the world, while valuable in itself,
> cannot be regarded as the sort of knowledge primarily intended by deepening. Rather is
> suggested a clearer apprehension of the purpose of God for man, and particularly of His
> immediate purpose as revealed and directed by Bahá’u’lláh, a purpose as far removed from
> current concepts of human well-being and happiness as is possible.2

Baha’i teachings indicate that the ‘organs of perception and consciousness’ of this ‘embryonic world
order’ are the various consultative and deliberative institutions of the Faith. Thus, esteeming and
honouring the idea of multiple paths to the truth taught by the Bab and Baha’u’llah is destined to lead

to the ultimate and complete transformation of human life on the planet. This transformation will, we
feel, characterize a time when the important Baha’i principle of the harmony of science and religion is
so etched into the cultural mind of that far-off time that the thought of a conflict between Baha’i
scholars and Baha’i institutions will be unformulable. Among the paths to the truth so considered,
then, there seems to be no compelling reason to omit academic methodology. A methodology is a tool,
it can be used well or it can be used badly. As for the path to truth, there is no guarantee that everyone
who esteems themselves treading it, is actually doing so. It is possible to stray from such a path, just
as it is possible to stray from any path. But this does not mean that the whole notion of a scientific
method or academic modus operandi should be demonized.

There are then at least two ways of speaking about the relationship between Baha’i scholars and
Baha’i institutions: (1) in terms of the very desirable state of affairs that will characterize the living
and working conditions of the New World Order, and (2) in terms of the current stage in the
development towards that goal. My comments will address only this second item, and I will take for
granted that the ideal conditions towards which we are all working are generally agreed upon, even if
we remain ignorant of precise details. My comments will also take for granted that among the most
important factors that condition the ideal relationship between Baha’i scholars and Baha’i institutions
are those spiritual – moral and ethical – virtues all Baha’is are called upon to embody. These are
frequently the same as the basic prerequisites of civilized society in general: honesty, humility,
generosity, patience, sincerity, mutual respect, a sense of humour, and so on. It is true that every
Baha’i is in some sense a Baha’i scholar when attempting to apply the teachings to a lived experience
or to study the Baha’i writings. Indeed, because of the sacramental status of intellect in the Baha’i
view of things, it could be said that any time a mind is ‘deployed’ Baha’i scholarship ensues, no
matter where that mind might find itself. Such a mystico-philosophical view is, I think, directly
related to a basic anti-clerical motif running throughout the writings of the Bab and Baha’u’llah. This
anti-clerical motif is one of the more foundational and formative themes in the writings and has helped
to energize a characteristic Baha’i impulse towards a kind of democratization, if you will, of religion.
This is the bright side. But my comments are not about the scholarship that comes under this category,
the ‘every Baha’i is a Baha’i scholar’ proposition, although what is said on the topic here could have
relevance for that category.

The dark side of such anti-clericalism sometimes manifests itself in a robust anti-intellectualism
and mistrust of the ways and methods of today’s secular clergy and their church – academics and the
academy. Anyone who has spent any time at all in an academic milieu knows that this mistrust is
surely a healthy thing in certain circumstances, just as a small dose of poison can frequently save a
life. Mistrust of ‘intellectuals’ is not new to the world and may be seen full-blown as a polemical
topos in such apocryphal tales as that of the burning of the library of Alexandria by the invading
Muslim hordes who, so the tale goes, were commanded to burn it because it either contained
knowledge that was already in the Qur’an and was therefore redundant and superfluous, or it
contained knowledge that was not in the Qur’an and was therefore unnecessary and (eo ipso) wrong.
In either case, the library was to be destroyed. This never happened, by the way. It is yet another of
the seemingly endless examples of Crusades-inspired cultural slurs against Islam.

A person might counter this assertion of anti-intellectualism in the Baha’i community by pointing
out that Baha’is are frequently highly educated people and that indeed the Baha’i Faith appears to be a
religion for intellectuals (a criticism I am sure we have all heard). But one of the prime inspirations for
the calling of this conference is the desire to address some of the issues and problems that have
emerged from the recent history of the relationship between Baha’i scholars and Baha’i institutions. I
will speak about the type of scholarship that I know best and the type with which I have the most
sustained experience: scholarship as a vocation, a profession. Furthermore, the species of scholarship

\[72\] STYLES OF PIETY

about which I am interested and most qualified to speak is a type that may be thought to play a
particular and distinctive role in the Baha’i community, and according to a recent communication
from the World Centre, perhaps a negative one.3 While there are dozens of Baha’i scholars who
pursue careers in various disciplines such as law, literature, physics, philosophy, and the sciences, the
type of scholarship that has given thoughtful Baha’is more pause for thought is precisely Middle
Eastern or Islamic Studies and Religious Studies and History.

It is natural and obvious that this be so. Baha’i scholars who perform scientific research in
literature, physics, engineering, medicine, and even philosophy are unlikely to publish books and
papers that directly connect with or pertain to Baha’i history and teachings in a primary way. This is
not to suggest that the work of such scholars is irrelevant to the Baha’i Faith. Nothing could be further
from reality. Because of the basic Baha’i teaching that posits no disjunction or disagreement between
‘religion’ and ‘science’, all intellectual endeavour is potentially pertinent to the Baha’i Faith, even if
only to continue to demonstrate the soundness of such a principle.

It is sometimes pointed out that some recent Baha’i scholarship is devoid of references to unseen
forces and the pivotal function of prophethood in the unfolding of civilization and culture. On the
problem of an appropriate methodology in the study of history, one observer has indicated that today
it would not be possible for a professional Baha’i intellectual historian to publish assent to the
historically problematic statement of Baha’u’llah: ‘The sages aforetime acquired their knowledge
from the Prophets, inasmuch as the latter were the Exponents of divine philosophy and the Revealers
of heavenly mysteries.’4 Presumably, the point being made here is that since it is not yet possible for a
Baha’i scholar to be completely honest in a professional milieu because the conclusions such a scholar
is under obligation to uphold are ‘unfashionable’, it is better for Baha’is to avoid altogether such
professions. But, if that Baha’i scholar were living and working in Afghanistan or Iran or Libya, it
would be not only possible but also probably expected (and certainly unexceptionable) to publish such
a statement.5 Except, of course, in this instance the Baha’i scholar would be constrained to avoid
mentioning Baha’u’llah in connection with such an assertion. It is thus quite possible that the kind of
research results published by a scholar of Islamic studies may at times challenge the Baha’is to ask
new questions about the history and teachings of their Faith, because the subject matter of this field of
inquiry is intimately connected with the rise, development and establishment of the Faith and
intersects the assertions of Baha’i history as written and elaborated by the Guardian. In such cases
Baha’is need to keep in mind that Shoghi Effendi was, as has been pointed out by the House of
Justice, completely dependent upon his sources for the information that he conveyed and interpreted.

> The infallibility of the Guardian is confined to matters which are related strictly to the Cause
> and interpretations of the Teachings; he is not an infallible authority on other subjects, such as
economics, science, etc.

The Guardian’s infallibility covers interpretation of the revealed word, and its application.

It is unlikely, for example, that scholars of American history or musicology will, in the course of their
professional duties, come across data which challenge or disagree with assertions made in the standard
Baha’i histories. The scholar of Islamic studies and Middle Eastern studies may run into such a
problem. The Baha’i scholar who studies the history of the Baha’i Faith according to the canons and
methods of the discipline of history as it is now configured will find, for example, that colleagues will
raise eyebrows, and perhaps even question competency, if that historian does not take into account all
the variants of a pertinent historical tradition. There can be no prima facie privileging of sources
simply because someone, no matter how many people think he or she is divinely guided, has said,
‘This is the truth.’

Styles and tastes in contemporary scholarship are such that questions of divine guidance,
revelation, and absolute truth are treated with great scepticism. And, it may be that a given Baha’i
scholar chooses to write about the events of history without capitalizing the pronouns referring to the
Central Figures of the Faith, or to write in a style that many Baha’is might deem dry and ‘intellectual’
(a subjective matter of taste?). Furthermore, it may be that such a scholar, in analysing (say) the
proclamation of the Bab, seeks to understand such an event by taking for granted that the Bab was a
Manifestation of God – a spiritual and confessional proposition that is quite beyond the reach of
syllogistic proof or disproof by anyone’s standard – and still proceeds to discuss the event by
coordinating it with what is known about the state of society at the time, its economics, its sociology,
its religious atmosphere and political and religious institutions. It may be that such a scholar after such
an analysis concludes that the event of the Bab’s proclamation and the subsequent development of the
Baha’i Faith and its institutions make perfect sense when studied in such a manner. Does such a
conclusion indicate that this scholar is any less a believer than the Baha’i who simply asserts that the
Bab was a Manifestation of God and that we know this because he said so? Or are we dealing here
with two different styles of piety?

Piety is a tricky topic; for those foolish enough to claim authority for their views upon it
demonstrate thereby that they are unequal to the task. But piety is an important topic because it
denotes the seriousness towards life, meaning, and truth that religion, and therefore the Baha’i Faith,
requires of believers. But what is such seriousness truly about? Does it mean that true believers should
never laugh? Certainly some have suggested this in the past. Does it rather mean that human dignity is
intimately connected with faithfulness towards the Ten Commandments or, if you will, religious law?
Human dignity is seen as preserved, paradoxically, in the submission of the human being to a higher
purpose or law. But in the unfolding of history, true piety has been expressed in many different ways.
There is a purely civic piety – the term, incidentally, stems from the Latin pietas: ‘sense of duty’. And
there is the purely religious piety. This latter has frequently found itself the butt of jibes and jokes by
secularists or even more ‘moderate’ religious types because of an a priori view of piety in this sense as
being self-righteous, irrational, stubborn, pompous, and fanatical. Thus Seneca:

> The difference between us and the Etruscans is the following: that whereas we believe
> lightning to be released as a result of the collision of clouds, they believe that clouds collide
> so as to release lightning: for as they attribute all to the deity, they are led to believe not that
> things have a meaning insofar as they occur, but rather that they occur because they must have
> a meaning.7

Where are the Baha’is to be placed along this implied continuum? It would seem that the Senecan
attitude is more in line with such Baha’i principles and axioms as the essential harmony of science and
religion. Yet, there are strong, clear traces of the ‘Etruscan mode’ in the Faith. It is perhaps not a

\[74\] STYLES OF PIETY

question of either/or, but of emphasis, proportion, taste, and the ever-elusive wisdom that dictates
which mode is to be privileged at a given time, or in which combination and ratio the two apparently
irreconcilable modes are to be joined together in a specific noetic and/or moral and ethical
circumstance. Baha’i institutions recognize, of course, that matters of temperament, style, and taste are
not the same as matters of faith; that one’s relationship to the Covenant cannot be determined solely
on the basis of the manner in which one expresses oneself. For after all, tastes and styles in expression
and speech change over time and according to cultural presuppositions. But it is not always the case
that all of us recognize this. A person who is so impressed by the Baha’i view of things that they wish
to attempt to discover how such a beautiful and compelling teaching came to be should not be
penalized for this interest. To examine the circumstances under which Baha’i teachings evolved and
the lives of the Central Figures of the Baha’i Faith unfolded is something, according to the writings
themselves, that is encouraged by the Baha’i institutions. After all, ‘Abdu’l-Baha has said that we can
be greedy for knowledge:

> [G]reed, which is to ask for something more, is a praiseworthy quality provided that it is used
> suitably. So if a man is greedy to acquire science and knowledge, or to become
> compassionate, generous and just, it is most praiseworthy. If he exercises his anger and wrath
> against the bloodthirsty tyrants who are like ferocious beasts it is very praiseworthy; but if he
> does not use these qualities in a right way, they are blameworthy.8

Seeking to gain a more profound understanding of how the Baha’i religion came to be, then, must not
be confused with explaining it away. What is the difference? Better ask, ‘Where is the difference?’ A
phobic reaction to the mindset which scientists and historians must have in order to do their work
indicates that inner resources are not up to the task. The ‘where’ in question then is precisely the soul;
a faculty, according to the Baha’i writings, which is best left to err on the side of magnanimity (lit:
‘capacious of soul’). Why, otherwise, should anyone fear the truth, be pusillanimous (lit: ‘small of
soul’). Countless examples from history – including the origin and development of Baha’i teachings
themselves – demonstrate that the greatest truths were born as heresies.

I would like to present an example from a cognate problem in another realm of discourse. It may
be difficult to imagine, but it is nonetheless true that the various disciplines and fields of study in the
academy have spawned their own histories of orthodoxy versus heterodoxy. Even the study of poetry
– of all things – shows this pattern. When John Ciardi published what was destined to become a very
influential book, it was met with virulent opposition. The book, How Does A Poem Mean?,9 was
thought by some representatives of the literary establishment to violate the sanctity of the poetic by
explaining in precise and accurate language the various elements that combine in a successful poem to
produce the ‘ineffable experience of poetry’. So the author was chastised and condemned by the
academic establishment for having taken the magic out of poetry, for explaining it away. (That Ciardi
was also at the same time hounded by the FBI seems to have been a coincidence having nothing to do
with his scholarly preoccupations.) The author, therefore, was constrained to offer a word of apology.
Here is an apposite excerpt:

There is a tendency to focus on relationships between Baha’i scholars and the Baha’i institutions only
when problems and difficulties arise. We all have a vision of what the relationships between these two
will be in the hereafter of the New World Order, and we should, of course, maintain such a vision as it
will inevitably nourish and cultivate relations as they exist now. Before we conclude this brief
exploratory consideration of the current intellectual culture of the Baha’i community, I would like to
digress by presenting a very brief sketch of the history of the relationship between scholars and
institutions in Islamic culture and history. After all, the Guardian instructs us to study such things in
our continuing efforts to determine what the Baha’i Faith is and what it is not. In a letter written on
behalf of Shoghi Effendi to an individual believer, dated 27 April 1936, the following is found:

> The Bahá’í view . . . is that the Dispensation of Muḥammad, like all other Divine
> Dispensations, has been fore-ordained, and that as such forms an integral part of the Divine
> Plan for the spiritual, moral and social development of mankind. It is not an isolated religious
> phenomenon, but is closely and historically related to the Dispensation of Christ, and those of
> the Báb and Bahá’u’lláh. It was intended by God to succeed Christianity, and it was therefore
the duty of the Christians to accept it as firmly as they had adhered to the religion of Christ.

. . . Islám constitutes a fuller revelation of God’s purpose for mankind. The so-called
> Christian civilization of which the Renaissance is one of the most striking manifestations is
> essentially Muslim in its origins and foundations. When medieval Europe was plunged in
> darkest barbarism, the Arabs regenerated and transformed by the spirit released by the

> their contemporary Christians in Europe had never witnessed before. It was eventually

released by the Muḥammadan Dispensation.

From the standpoint of institutionalism Islám far surpasses true Christianity as we know

\[76\] STYLES OF PIETY

. . . The Bahá’ís should try to study history anew, and to base all their investigations first
and foremost on the written scriptures of Islám and Christianity.11

And Shoghi Effendi himself wrote the following:

> [The Bahā’īs] must strive to obtain, from sources that are authoritative and unbiased, a sound
> knowledge of the history and tenets of Islám – the source and background of their Faith – and
> approach reverently and with a mind purged from pre-conceived ideas the study of the Qur’án

> only Book which can be regarded as an absolutely authenticated Repository of the Word of
> God. They must devote special attention to the investigation of those institutions and
> circumstances that are directly connected with the origin and birth of their Faith, with the
> station claimed by its Forerunner, and with the laws revealed by its Author.12

With such guidance as inspiration, I would like to divert the focus for a moment to offer one instance
of how it may be helpful to refer to the history and culture of Islam when attempting to employ a
Baha’i paradigm in the pursuit of answers to pressing social and intellectual problems. By the time
Islamic history began to be officially sponsored – that is to say written – in Muslim realms, the
community had developed and acquired many of the characteristic institutions and vocations that
would continue to work themselves out over the course of time. One of the key historiographical
principles that informs this early history has to do with the function of various severe crises in early
Islamic history. Some of these crises have been characterized as political and some religious. From a
Baha’i point of view, it may be suggested that the early crises might have been avoided had the
specific provisions of Muhammad’s will and testament, his covenant, been universally observed. This
is an assertion based on faith and, if you will, ideology. It is a proposition that Baha’is find congenial,
but one that contemporary historians would criticize. It is an assertion that cannot at present be upheld
according to the strict demands of contemporary historical and historiographical methodology.

So, we must say that for whatever reasons, these social, political and religious crises occurred and
left in their wake a number of groups with varying theologies and visions of the ‘true Islam’. By the
early 9th century, as a result of the vast wealth and power accumulated during the Abbasid dynasty,
the court mounted one of the most impressive state-sponsored scholarly enterprises up to that time: the
attempt to collate and classify all the knowledge in the world, and of course to translate it into Arabic.
This project brought Muslims into direct contact with Greek (pagan) philosophy, and the Muslims –
supremely confident of their place in the world as followers of the most recent divine revelation – set
about coordinating this foreign knowledge with Qur’anic revelation. It was the supreme confidence of
Islamic society that allowed it to take truth from whichever quarter it might be found. After all,
according to Islam, all knowledge comes from God, a God who communicates such knowledge and
truth to humans through specially chosen messengers. Therefore, truths and knowledge found outside
of the Islamic cultural sphere might be imported, as long as it is recognized that these too will have
their ultimate source in revelation, even if there exists no historical record of God’s revelatory activity
in the foreign culture. The all-important epistemological presupposition is: if it is true, it must have its
source in prophecy, and if there is no record of such, say in ancient Greece, then it must be the case
that the traces of such an event have been lost forever, the Greeks travelled to the Holy Land (Israel)
for knowledge at some stage, or that emissaries from the Holy Land travelled to pagan lands to

enlighten them. It is absolutely untenable that any truth could occur outside the system of
monotheistic prophecy. (Thus my earlier comment that Baha’u’llah’s assertion, while clearly
unacceptable in the post-enlightenment West, would find an assenting readership in some of the more
so-called fundamentalist Muslim countries today. The thesis is basically an Islamicate one.) This
supreme confidence that evidence can confirm belief but can never contradict it typifies the
Rationalist style of piety.13

The proof of Islam’s own truth was precisely the prosperity and triumph of Islam over the
previous religions of Mesopotamia and the Iranian plateau. It was in such a euphoric atmosphere that
Islamic philosophy began. Having clearly nothing to fear, official scholars such as al-Kindī (d. c. 870
CE) serenely asserted that it was the scholar’s duty to take knowledge and truth wherever it was
found, even if this be in the midst of the most godless of people. His successor al-Fārābī (d. c. 950
CE), in a characteristic expression of Islamicate cosmopolitanism, asserted unflinchingly that all
religion is the same, but varies only according to language, history, weather or geography – which
factors give rise to different articulations of the same basic truths. So sanguine and powerful was the
Abbasid court that it eventually attempted to impose on the populace what it esteemed the most
rational (and therefore, according to the prevailing court mood, most godly) interpretation of Islam.
One of the mottoes of this ‘inquisition’ was that God is constrained to behave in a way that never
conflicts with reason. But this inquisition resulted in the eventual triumph not of so-called Islamic
Rationalism, but rather Islamic Traditionalism/Fundamentalism. The Traditionalists were scandalized
by the arrogance of the philosophers who presumed to set limits, no matter how abstract and
metaphysical, to the nature of God. Possibly even more crucial, such philosophic discussions appeared
to take too scant notice of Islamic scripture. That is to say, the words of the philosophers were
presented by their critics as forming something of a self-serving new scripture intended by their
authors to supersede the sacred verities of the Qur’an and Hadith. Consequently, the Islamic
Rationalists lost more and more credibility and authority until they all but disappeared from view and
the Traditionalists grew in influence.

In addition to these two modes of Islamic piety, Rationalism and Traditionalism, several others
were in operation. The activity of the philosophers qualifies as religious on the grounds that they
sought to justify the theological and cosmological claims of the Qur’an and the Hadith with the
axioms of Hellenistic philosophy and science. There were also the Sufis and mystics, and the experts
in Islamic law – and then of course there were the fissiparously burgeoning Shi’i movements that
would eventually issue in the Fatimid political experiment and the Twelver or Imami intellectual
tradition out of which the Baha’i Faith would eventually grow.

The achievement of Islam may in part be spoken of in connection with the way Islamic society
ultimately came to accommodate such different modes or styles of piety within it.14 Amongst those
who expressed their piety through the Law, such statements ascribed to Muhammad as ‘Difference of
opinion with my community is a divine mercy’ and ‘My community will never agree on an error’
tended to reassure even this least flexible of piety-minded Muslims that unity was not the same as
uniformity.15 As seen above, the accommodation was not always without conflict. But, even in the

absence of a universally honoured covenant, this was by any measure a remarkable development.
Despite the various and frequently competing spiritual hues, emphases and doctrines, the Islamic
polity may be thought to have achieved a degree of universalism established throughout a vast
geography on a scale previously unknown and probably unpredictable. This is what may be referred to
as catholic Islam. In the process, philosophy, which started life in Islamic culture under a very
auspicious star, was eventually demonized by the ‘orthodoxers’ of Islam. And rationalism and the
philosophic spirit sought refuge in the Shi’i movement and some Sufi movements. This led to what
has been described as an intellectual stagnation during the middle periods of Islamic history. Because
there was not a single universally recognized source of spiritual and political authority, the various
trends in Islamic intellectual history were, by and large, left to seek their own destinies and levels.

It is true that scholars and scientists continued to be patronized by the various caliphs and sultans
whose careers punctuate Islamic history and that there never seems to have been any doubt that one
could also be a Muslim and be interested in science and scholarship.16 It seems as if the more the
Muslim seekers of knowledge penetrated the mysteries of creation, the more they exulted in and
celebrated the mysterious and elegant workings of an all-powerful Creator. Thus the earliest histories
of the Prophet (9th century CE) are full of minute details describing the conditions and the causes that
led to various revelations of verses in the Qur’an. This knowledge, far from being considered
dangerous to faith, was embraced as its constituent and prime element. The intricacies by which the
Divine Will made itself known were never seen as a proof for an assertion that ‘as soon as one
understands the influence of these “intricacies” one is no longer required or permitted to believe in a
Higher Intelligence’. There was Qur’anic support, e.g. 41: 53, from the very beginning for the view
that contemplating (tadabbur/tadhakkur/tafakkur) the Signs of God (i.e. the natural realm) is an act of
piety. According to this naturalistic (and semiotic) style of piety, understanding (fahm) the workings
of nature and society is a desideratum for anyone who would call themselves believer.

But then Islam – catholic Islam – cultivated and nurtured these various modes of piety from a
position of near-absolute strength. Islam had defeated the old and venerable civilizations even as it
had incorporated many of their achievements into its own culture, and it was clear that Islam had

nothing to fear from knowledge of any kind. Thus, the euphoria continued more or less unabated until
the Mongol ‘occupations’ at which time the fictional centre of the Islamic world was finally exposed
for what it was and the self-confidence of Islam was profoundly shaken. After 1258 CE, the year of
the destruction of Baghdad and the execution of the Abbasid caliph, much of the progress in the
intellectual tradition was halted and there was a mass exodus, once again, into the conservatism of
Traditionalism. It is as if Muslims felt that the Mongol invasions were a punishment from God for
their having strayed from the true path – perhaps through the kinds of intellectual experimentation and
cultivation indicated above.

So from the 13th century until the rise of the Safavids at the beginning of the 16th century, the
main spiritual and intellectual pursuits were frequently found amongst the Sufis, the mystics. Not
necessarily because of the mysticism, but because Sufism was reconfiguring itself in numberless and
sometimes competing organizations (lit. ‘paths’, turuq) to respond to the profound identity crisis
resulting from the Mongol devastations. The unthinkable had occurred: Islam was defeated.
Alexander’s wall had been breached and the forces of Gog and Magog set loose upon the lands of
Islam – the Land of the Covenant (viz. ‘civilization’). Sufi organizations now spoke of a Land of the
Covenant that was inaccessible to barbarians because it was located in the spiritual realm. In much the
same way, various Shi’i groups speak of the Hidden Imam, the focus of all authority whether spiritual
or political, as residing in an inaccessible, mysterious, unseen realm from which he exercises his
rule.17 At the same time, these same organizations constructed numerous earthly institutions through
which this Land of the Covenant could be travelled to and inhabited. Islam was once again inviolable
and the confidence of the Sufi brotherhoods, together with their altruism and commitment to the noble
ideals of Islam, influenced and helped heal the terrible psychological dislocations of the Mongol
conquests . . . to such a degree that the conquerors themselves eventually embraced Islam and helped
re-establish its health. This was the triumph of the Sufi style of piety.

In the 16th century the remarkable Safavid dynasty was established and triumphed over Iran. The
vast wealth that flowed to the capital was used in the promotion of high culture and the consolidation,
in a new era, of the Twelver Shi’i religion. This religion elevated to the highest possible level the
mystic devotion to and love of the Imams. In the process, and in the context of historical and religious
factors which would take us too far afield, Safavid Shi’ism also elevated ‘sacred hatred’ to the highest
possible level.18 Such ‘sacred hatred’ was directed precisely to those deemed unfaithful to the
Covenant – the majority Sunni Muslims. Most alarmingly, it was a perversion of the sacred duty of
scholarship that was ultimately responsible for the thoroughness of this development. In large
measure, it was against the deleterious and culturally exhausting effects of this ‘sacred hatred’, that
Baha’u’llah first raised his voice. And since it was in large part the religious scholars who laid the
foundations and propagated this hatred, a large part of the Baha’i critique of society is aimed at them,
the mullas and mujtahids, the religious authorities first of Islam and by extension, the clerical class in
all religious traditions.

So, for better and for worse, throughout its history, Islam never despised the activity of the
individual independent scholar. Indeed, the tradition holds that a scholar is amongst the most valuable
of citizens. The Safavid instance reminds us that not everything that goes by the name of scholarship
is necessarily so, for in the Baha’i view, scholarship and truth are proven in the fostering of a social
unity thought to be an earthly reflection of divine unity. In other words, and as Baha’u’llah has

insisted, if religion causes disunity then it is better done without, no matter how compelling it might
otherwise be.

Because of the nature of ‘truth’ partly delineated above, knowledge and learning has from Islam’s
inception until the present day performed something of a sacramental function with practical
implications and ramifications. It is because it is so highly esteemed that it is also susceptible of
perversion and manipulation for selfish political ends. There have been times when a certain
intellectual attitude or theology was imposed upon the Muslims: the inquisition referred to above, the
Wahhabi movement of the Arabian peninsula, the Khomeinist regime in Iran, the Taliban of
Afghanistan. But these seem to stand out in intaglio against the guiding ethos of a classical age that
was one of relative intellectual freedom and scientific experimentation. And this was a result (indeed
no doubt possible only because) of the deep certitude Islam felt about its rightful place in the world.
As this certitude fluctuates through history, we can see that intellectual attainment also rises and falls.
Today, for example, as Islam feels itself besieged on all sides by hostile forces, it has circled its
wagons and, in some cases, apparently abandoned the noble tradition of liberalism and research that
once characterized its most prosperous periods. This is, I think, something that the Guardian wanted
the Baha’is to observe in their study of Islamic history, so that Baha’i history might renew its nobler
qualities and avoid the baser – such as the occasional tendency to defend the Faith against opposition
by attacking certain styles of piety.

**************

Despite the eradication by Baha’u’llah from the religious repertoire of anything resembling ‘sacred
hatred’, tensions have developed between some Baha’i scholars and Baha’i institutions in recent
years. They are, in some ways, the reappearance of typical relationships that everyone knows well
from the experience of other religious communities. It makes sense to assume that the institutions of
the Faith are evolving as the individuals who serve on assemblies also evolve and mature spiritually
and intellectually. The Baha’i vision is one that assumes gradual and perhaps even slow development
towards its destiny. But Baha’i institutions as sensory organs and the conscience of the infant Baha’i
community are infallibly designed to guide. It is the degree to which the individuals serving on these
assemblies are able to establish a cognitive and contemplative distance between their divergent,
distinct (but mutually energizing) roles as simultaneous members of the infant community and
participants in the collective mode of consciousness and perception that is designed to lead the
community, that these institutions will be permitted to acquit themselves of this unique calling – ‘to
enter the poem more perceptively’. The destiny, as is well known, is something that must be won by
the Baha’is through mutuality, cooperation, intellectual honesty and liberality, detachment and work.
This victory is unlikely to be won without recognition of, and genuine respect for, diverse styles of
piety.

These days, part of the tension may arise from uneasiness with the somewhat anarchic nature of
the Internet. Fear of the new is an occupational hazard of institutions. Indeed, the closest word for
heresy in Islamic theology is precisely ‘innovation’. The Internet is new but definitely here to stay, so
institutions have to adjust to its presence. Tools are neither good nor bad in themselves, but are only
made so as a result of the way they are used. It is much too early to think about how the Internet might
eventually function within the Baha’i community, but it is certain that it will continue to play a larger
and larger role.19 If that role can be worked out through trial and error, in a spirit of cooperation, with
goodwill and humour it will clearly enhance the quality of Baha’i community life to an unforeseeable

degree.20 The proper relationship between all Baha’is and the sources of authority in the Faith is
characterized in the writings as one of love, mutuality, cooperation, trust, obedience and respect. If the
epithet ‘Baha’i scholars’ means ‘scholars who identify themselves as Baha’is’, then this relationship
should include them as well. That the organizers of this conference have included this general topic
among the few ‘foundational issues’ is a direct result of the somewhat vexed, more or less public,
relationship between some Baha’i scholars and ‘the institutions’ of late. These recent developments
are in some ways typical of the historical relationship between an intelligentsia and authority-wielding
institutions in general, and as long as authority is wielded, there will be challenges to it. This is not the
same as saying that as long as there is an intelligentsia, there will be challenges to authority.

The brighter and more mature future that we as Baha’is can and should look forward to is not
necessarily one in which Baha’i scholars and intellectuals will cease questioning the institutions about
interpretations and applications of Baha’i teachings. The conception of authority developed in the
Baha’i writings is itself an evolving idea. It is an authority of magnanimity, of patience, of love, of
strength, of generosity. It is in some ways the authority of a parent, or of a spouse (male or female)
who by virtue of a commitment to a marriage acquires authority in the relationship commensurate
with such a commitment. Individual believers – scholars included – as constituents of the Baha’i
institution of community are called upon in their authority to be no less magnanimous, loving and
generous than their counterparts in the Faith.

Many of the recent difficulties in the relationship we are discussing came about because of
insecurity, fear and a lack of fair play. I think chief amongst the lapses was gossip – replacing
dialogue with storytelling. Difficulties will never cease, either inside or outside the Faith. But we can
perhaps strive for ever more interesting and engaging difficulties, and even more importantly, more
elevated and worthy ways of coming to some harmonious outcome.

Finally, there seems to be a confusion between the pious and the pietistic, especially in styles of
writing about the Faith and its history. Faithfulness to the Covenant is sometimes confused with a
style which advertises its own faithfulness by repetition of pietistic formulas, while the scholarly style
which places facts before self-expression is regarded with suspicion. But these different styles simply
reflect different styles of piety, neither of which is inherently more faithful to the Covenant than the
other. The community needs both styles; and from its academic members, the community needs
scholarship on Faith-related matters in which it remains tacitly understood that God is the author of
creation and that Baha’u’llah is a Manifestation of God and that the House of Justice is infallible.
Writing which constantly interrupts the investigation to make these assertions explicit would defeat
the sacred purpose of scholarship.
