    Baha'i Guidelines to Healing and the Role of

Homoeopathy

Dr. Mozhdeh Foo

Abstract

While the Baha'i Writings do not advocate any particular system of
healing yet Baha'u'llah and 'Abdu'1-Bahá have enunciated the
fundamental principles of health and healing. The paper discusses the
principles of the Homoeopathic system of medicine and compares them
with those outlined in the Baha'i Writings.

Introduction

In this paper, I am happy to introduce the friends to one of the alternative
systems of therapeutics, namely, the Homoeopathic System of Healing
Art, which will be covered in the first part In the second part of my talk, I
will present the principles of health and healing as enunciated in our Faith.

I will not attempt to compare directly the Homoeopathic principles with
the Baha'i guidelines, I will, however, highlight the commonalties, and
leave it to the friends to consider its value, as the Universal House of
Justice has clearly pointed out that "the Faith should not be associated
with any particular school of medical theory or practice. It is left to each
believer to decide for himself which doctors he should consult, bearing in
mind the principles enunciated" l in the Writings.

HOMOEOPATHIC SYSTEM OF MEDICINE

History

The history of Homoeopathy begins with the discoveries of its founder,
Dr. Samuel Hahnemann, a German physician (1755-1843). By the time
he was 24 years old he was an accomplished Doctor. The system of
Medicine then was very preliminary. Bloodletting and purging were
common methods of treatment. He was soon disgusted with the prevalent
system of medicine practised at that time, gave up his clinic and became a
translator.

Hahnemann had an investigating and truth-seeking mind. In 1789, while
translating the book of William Cullen, one of the leading physicians of
the era, he was not satisfied with the reason given by Cullen for Peruvian
bark (Cinchona)^ effectiveness in curing Malaria. Cullen had ascribed
the usefulness of Peruvian bark (Cinchona) in treating Malaria to its bitter
and astringent properties.

By nature Hahnemann was an audacious rebel, unafraid to speak his
mind. He advocates audacity in his Organon using the Latin words, Aude
Sapere, meaning, dare to be wise. Hahnemann objected to Cullen's
reasoning and wrote a bold footnote to the effect that the efficacy of
Peruvian bark must derive from some other factor because there were
other mixtures and substances more bitter and astringent than cinchona,
yet not effective in the treatment of malaria.

He then decided to experiment for himself to discover the reason Cinchona
could cure Malaria. Thus he took four drachms of Cinchona extract twice
a day, until his body responded to its toxic dose with fever, chill and other
symptoms similar to malaria. Hahnemann suspected the reason this herb
was beneficial in curing Malaria was because it produced paroxysms of
chills and fever similar to those of the disease it was treating. The
necessity for Methodical discovery of the medicinal properties of drugs
was made apparent to him. He spent the next 6 years actively

experimenting on himself and his family and a small group of followers.
In 1796, he wrote his first article regarding "The Law of SJtaiJar&'v

He devoted the rest of his life to experimenting and developing the
Philosophy as well as the Materia Medica of the Homoeopathic system of
medicine. Subsequently, over 2000 medicines were proved.

Homoeopathy faced great persecution from the pharmacists and the
physicians of the time. Hahnemann himself was driven from one city to
another till the end of his life. Yet despite all the sufferings, Homoeopathy
continued to grow andflourish.Homoeopathy is now popular in a number
of countries namely, Germany, Great Britain, Scotland, France,
Argentina, and India.

Sources of Homoeopathic Medicine

There are six main sources from which Homoeopathic medicines are
prepared. These include:

Minerals:         Copper, Gold, Silver, etc.

Plants:           Greatest sources of medicines are plants.

Animals:          Snakes, poison, spider, Bee, etc.

Human Beings: Parts of human beings like the hormones, bacteria grown

> in the intestines, diseased parts like the micro-organisms
> present in diseases like Tuberculosis, Pneumonia, etc.

Chemicals:        Sulphuric acid, Nitric acid, etc.

Others:           like X-Ray, Magneticfield,Uranium, etc.

72            THE SINGAPORE BAHA'I STUDIES REVIEW
Seven Cardinal Principles of Homoeopathy

1\. Similia Similibus Curentus (Similar Cures Similar)

This is the basic underlying principle of Homoeopathy and the one from
which its name is derived. According to this law, the signs and symptoms
that a crude drug, when given in large, repeated doses, can cause in a
healthy person, the same it can cure in disease.

2\. Proving

Proving is the way in which the drug pictures are built up for each remedy
and the curative properties of a drug are ascertained. The proving in
Homoeopathy is not done on cats and mice or guinea-pigs but on healthy
human beings, the reason being, disease manifests itself not merely by
objective signs of sensory impression, but also by subjective symptoms of
motor expression. We cannot record the subjective feelings of animals
because they cannot express and communicate these feelings. Thus the
Medicine to be proved is given in small doses, to healthy human beings
(provers), until a reaction is experienced. Provers each maintain a diary in
which they keep a careful record of all the symptoms developed in them,
whether they affect the mind, body or emotions. After a few months of
proving, all diaries are collected and the common symptoms that appeared
in all provers are noted down. The most important symptoms are those
that appeared in greatest number of provers.

There are also two other sources of information on drug properties namely
the observances made in case of poisonings, accidental or otherwise and
Clinical Observances which are the symptoms cured in patients
unexpectedly taking a particular remedy. These too are noted and added
to the Materia Medica.

3\. Minimum Dose

One of the problems that Hahnemann faced was that of the dosage. Many
of the substances which he used were highly toxic in their crude state and
although diluting them reduced their side effects, it also, correspondingly
decreased their curative powers. After much experimentation he came

Guidelines to Healing and the Role of Homoeopathy                          73

across another extremely important discovery which proved to be the
answer to the problem. After diluting the medicinal substance in water or
alcohol, he vigorously shook the bottle containing the resulting dilution.
He called this "shaking succusion". The whole process of alternately
diluting and shaking the medicinal substance he called "potentisation" or
"dynamization". The resulting remedy was not only freed from toxicity,
but to his amazement its curative powers were actually increased, as use
in clinical practice proved3.

4\. Potency
The discovery that the remedies prepared by potentisation often became
more powerful therapeutic agents than the original starting materials was
a pure empirical observation. Remedies prepared by dilution and without
succusion did not display this increasing therapeutic power. Hahnemann
therefore named diluting and succusing his solutions 'potentisation', since
this process increased the potency or power of the therapeutic agents.4
Hahnemann considered that distilled water, alcohol and lactose (milk
sugar) were medicinally inert, so he diluted the medicines in these media.
If the remedy was soluble in water or alcohol he mixed one part of the
substance with ninety-nine parts of the liquid and submitted the dilution to
a hundred vigorous succusions. In other words he banged the dilution on a
leather-bound book a hundred times. The resulting dilution was called the
first centesimal potency or lc. He then mixed one drop of this dilution
with ninety-nine parts of the water or alcohol and submitted it to another
hundred succusions, and called it second centesimal potency or 2c. This
he did up to 30 times to produce the 30c potency. This is called the
centesimal scale. Today the whole process is usually carried out by
machines and dilutions up to 100,000 are made.5

Insoluble materials are triturated (ground up) with lactose in dilutions of 1
in 10 or 1 in 100. After the sixth trituration such substances become
soluble and dilution is then continued using the water/alcohol diluent.
After the sixth potency not even a molecule of the original substance is
left and yet it exerts such influence which can cure a sick parson quickly
and without side effects.
Homoeopathic medicines are all sweet to taste and those prepared by
succusion bear the smell of alcohol.

5\. Single Remedy

This principle follows directly from the principle of cure by like. The
Homoeopathic physician is trying to match his patient to the most like
remedy, and it follows that the patient should resemble closely only one
remedy at a time. The remedy may change, or in acute injuries more than
one remedy may be required, but in classical Homoeopathy the remedies
are administered one remedy at a time. This is logical on the grounds that
the remedies were proved as a single remedy and not as mixtures, and
mixtures of remedies may have effects which are different from those of
their component parts.

6\. Hering's law of Cure-The Law of the Directions of Cure

This was enunciated By Hahnemann's pupil, Dr. Constantine Hering, and
is of practical use in deciding how a course of treatment is progressing.
Hering stated that a cure should proceed: from above, downwards-from
the head or upper regions of the body down towards the feet; from within,
out- from the internal organs out to the joints or skin; from more
important to less important organs-fromthe liver, heart or lung out to the
joints or skin; from the present backwards in time- going back into the
patient's medical history.
Hering realised that disease was the result of imbalance somewhere in the
body and that if a true cure was to be effected, the imbalance had to be

corrected. He visualised it as being brought out from the deeper levels of
the individual to the surface and finally dispersed altogether6.

7\. Repetition of Remedy

In classical Homeopathy a single dose of high potency is given to the
patient and, assuming improvement, is not repeated for as long as the
patient continues to improve. It is only when improvement ceases or the
patient begins to deteriorate again, that the dose is repeated. The low
potencies are repeated more frequently depending on the disease.

Biochemie Homoeopathy

There are twelve Biochemie Tissue Remedies, that are a complementary
part of Homoeopathy. The former, along with Homoeopathy acts as the
opposite blade of the scissors; in completing the curative action of the
medicines. Dr. Schussler wrote the treatise on the twelve Tissue Remedies
and the Homoeopathic practitioners used it and later on wrote their
experience of these remedies.

Theory of Schussler* s Biochemie Method

"The idea upon which Biochemie therapeutics is based is the
physiological fact that both the structure and vitality of the organs of the
body are dependent upon certain necessary quantities and proper
apportionment of its organic constituents.
The inorganic constituents are, in a very real sense, the material basis of
the organs and tissues of the body, and are absolutely essential to their
integrity of structure and functional activity. According to Schussler* s
theory, any disturbance in the molecular motion of these cell salts in living
tissues, caused by a deficiency in the requisite amount, constitutes
disease, which can be rectified and the requisite equilibrium re-established
by administering the same mineral salts in small quantities"7.

The Constituents of the Human Organism

Blood consists of water, sugar, fat, albuminous substances, chloride of
sodium, chloride of potash, fluoride of lime, silica, iron, lime, magnesia,
soda and potash. The latter are combined with phosphoric, carbonic and
Sulphuric acids. Thus the following 12 tissue remedies were prepared to
supplement the deficiency of these constituents.

Calcarea Flourica                            Kali Sulphuricum
Calcarea Phosphorica                         Magnesia Phosphoricum
Calcarea Sulphurica                          Natrum Muriaticum
Ferrum Phosphoricum                          Natrum Phosphoricum
Kali Muriaticum                              Natrum Sulphuricum
Kali Phosphoricum                            Silicea

The biochemical therapeutics aid nature in her efforts to cure by
supplying the natural remedies lacking in certain parts, that is, the
inorganic cell-salts, and in this way corrects abnormal states of
physiological chemistry.8

Since these medicines are given in diluted and potentised forms it will
enter the blood and intercellular fluids from the mouth and oesophagus
and restore disturbed function.

HEALTH AND HEALING FROM THE BAHA'I
PERSPECTIVE
Guidelines on Nature of Medicine

Treat Disease through Diet

While Baha'ullah has strongly recommended visiting skilful physicians
when sick, at the same time he has advised us to leave off medical
treatment once health has been restored. Preference is to be given to

treatment first through diet and later through the use of single herb. He
says, "Do not neglect medical treatment when it is necessary, but leave it
off when health has been restored. Treat disease through diet, by
preference, refraining from the use of drugs; and if you find what is
required in a single herb, do not resort to a compound medication...
Abstain from drugs when health is good, but administer them when
necessary."9

Cures Which Are Not Repulsive

Cures in future should be agreeable to smell and taste of man. *AbduT-
Bahá enunciating this principle says, "The science of medicine is still in a
condition of infancy; it has not reached maturity. But when it has reached
this point, cures will be performed by things which are not repulsive to the
smell and taste of man- that is to say, by aliments, fruits and vegetables
which are agreeable to the taste and have an agreeable smell" 10.

Biochemie Homoeopathy

Although the BaháT Faith is not "associated with any particular school of
medical theory or practice", as explained by Shoghi Effendi yet wefindin
the writings a reference made by 'Abdu'1-Bahá to the Biochemical
Homoeopathy system of medicine, as a form of food medicine.

One of the friends of Persia wrote to Shoghi Effendi and asked this
question: "Is it true that 'AbduT-Bahá has said that biochemical
homeopathy, which is a form of food medicine, is in conformity with the
BaháT medical concept?" The beloved Guardian's reply to this question
in a letter dated 25th November 1944 was as follows: "This statement is
true, and the truth thereof will be revealed in the future." (The question
and answer are translatedfromthe Persian.)

The Universal House of Justice has also asked us to inform you that it
does not wish the above statement to be circulated in isolation from the
many and varied other texts in the Writings on medicine. However, you
may share it with any of yourfriendswho are interested u .

Causes of Disease

In the writings there is a great emphasis on the importance of preventing
diseases. By knowing what causes disease we can prevent disease.

1\. Bodily or Physical Causes of Illness

Disturbance of the elements that compose the human being.

'Abdu'l-Baha says, "The outer, physical causal factor in disease,
however, is a disturbance in balance, the proportionate equilibrium of all
those elements of which the human body is composed. To illustrate: the
body of man is a compound of many constituent substances, each
component being present in a prescribed amount, contributing to the
essential equilibrium of the whole. So long as these constituents remain in
their due proportion, according to the natural balance of the whole- that
is, no component suffereth a change in its natural proportionate degree
and balance, no component being either augmented or decreased- there
will be no physical cause for the incursion of disease.

For example, the starch component must be present to a given amount,
and the sugar to a given amount. So long as each remaineth in its natural
proportion to the whole, there will be no cause for the onset of disease.
When, however, these constituents vary as to their natural and due
amounts- that is, when they are augmented or diminished- it is certain that
this will provide for the inroads of disease"12.

Britain: W & J Mackay, 1978, pp. 152-156

2\. Sins - Potent Cause of Physical Ailments

"If mankind were free from the defilements of sin and waywardness and
lived according to a natural, inborn equilibrium, without following
wherever their passions led, it is undeniable that disease would no longer
take the ascent, nor diversify with such intensity."13

"But man hath perversely continued to serve his lustful appetites, and he
would not content himself with simple foods. Rather, he prepared for
himself food that was compounded of many ingredients, of substances
differing one from the other. With this, and with the perpetrating of vile
and ignoble acts, his attention was engrossed, and he abandoned the
temperament and moderation of a natural way of life. The result was the
engendering of disease both violent and diverse."13

Thus 'Abdu'1-Bahá explains that cause of illness is related to defilements
of sin and waywardness, indulgence in one's persistent biological urges,
lack of contentment with simple food and the lack of moderation. Today
multitudes of people are weighed down with diseases that are the result of
their indulgent nature. Alcoholism, drug abuse and freedom of sex have
lead to innumerable physical and psychological diseases.

Alcohol when used chronically causes serious psychological diseases,
behavioural problems, disorders of sleep, depression and nervousness.
The side effects of heroin are suicidal tendencies, and bodily ailments like
liver cirrhosis, pericarditis and infarction of blood.

Another social problem faced all over the world is that offreedomof sex.
Venereal diseases and Aids are the serious problems which are the result
of thisfreedom.The unwanted pregnancy especially of young girls aged
14-16 years is another serious issue in many countries of the world.
Leaders and thinkers suggest solutions such as the proper use of family
planning to solve these problems. They teach in schools how to use
preventive measures to avoid unwanted pregnancies and Aids. What they

Britain: W & J Mackay, 1978, pp. 152-153

80             THE SINGAPORE BAHAT STUDIES REVIEW
don't examine is the cause of the problem which is freedom of sex and
enslavement to one's carnal desires.

3\. Emotional Causes of Illness

Negative emotions and lack of spiritual characteristics can affect our
health to a great extent.

Baha'u'llah says, "Verily the most necessary thing is contentment under
all circumstances; by this one is preserved from morbid conditions and
from lassitude. Yield not to grief and sorrow: they cause the greatest
misery. Jealousy consumeth the body and anger doth burn the liver: avoid
these two as you would a lion."14                                                   0

Thus a life of moderation and spiritual orientation, with especial attention
to renouncing addictive substances, the purity of diet, leading a chaste and
holy life, living the life and maintaining rectitude of conduct and
obedience to the laws of God for this age is been strongly recommended in
the Faith to promote physical, mental and spiritual health.

Conclusion

There are many systems of medicine being practised in the world, one of
which is the Homeopathic system of medicine. It must however be made
clear that none of the systems prevalent in the world at present can claim
to be the be-all and end all of healing. According to 'Abdu'1-Bahá "the
science of medicine is still in a condition of infancy; it has not reached
maturity."15

Although the Biochemical system of medicine has been approved by
'Abdu'1-Bahá yet we must bear in mind that "No specific school of
nutrition has been associated with Baha'i teachings." and that "...The

\[14\] Esslemont J.E. Baha'u'llah and the New Era. 5th edition. Wilmette: Baha'i
Publishing Trust, 1980, p. 108

' AbduT-Bahá. Some Answered Questions. Translated by Laura C. Barney. Wilmette:
Baha'i Publishing Trust, 1994, p. 257

Faith should not be associated with any particular school of medical
theory or practice. It is left to each believer to decide for himself which
doctors he should consult, bearing in mind the principles enunciated
above."16

In this paper the cardinal principles of Homoeopathy and the Baha'f
guidelines on health and healing have been described. The purpose of this
paper is not to prove that Homoeopathy is the only system of healing but
is a possible mode of treatment that could be trusted and considered by
the B aha* is when sick.

Human beings are created noble and spiritual beings. Therefore all
activities and endeavours should increase this nobility and safeguard this
spiritual reality from debasement.

A state of complete health exists and can be maintained when spiritually,
emotionally and physically the individual, fully aware of his true identity,
is able to function at his real potential. He must befreefromenslavement
and in full control of his self. To avoid enslavement of body and mind we
are forbidden the use of intoxicating drinks, opium and other mind-
altering drugs and have been requested by 'Abdu'1-Bahá to renounce the
use of tobacco. Man can enjoy a much healthier state of being by
practising moderation and altering his diet to include simpler foods.
The sociomedical implications of observing premarital chastity and
fidelity in marital relationships would be a marked decrease in venereal
diseases and all its subsequent complications.

It is hoped that the paper has served its purpose of familiarising the reader
with the basic tenets of the Homoeopathic system of medicine and the
commonalties it has with the directives in the Baha'i Faith on health and
healing.
