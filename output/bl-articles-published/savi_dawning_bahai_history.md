          Mayflowers in the Ville Lumière:
the Dawning of Bahá’í History in the European Continent1

Julio Savi

Against the background of the Paris of the fin de siècle and of the Belle
Époque, with its magnificent intellectual and artistic efflorescence, a young
American lady becomes the catalyst for the spiritual awakening of a group
of early God-intoxicated believers. The paper emphasizes their human
characters and the mysterious ways through which they, lovingly steered
by a subtle, omnipresent and all-guiding Will, came to recognize the dawn
of the new era on the European continent and on the whole world.

The nineteenth century of the Christian era was drawing to a close
when a young woman from the town of Englewood, New Jersey,
on the outskirts of New York City, arrived in Paris, on the banks
of the Seine. Her family name was Bolles and her name was Mary
Ellis(1870–1940), but she was known as May, a name evoking the
thought of advanced springtime, multicolored roses, mild breezes,
refreshing showers.

Randolph, her brother, had decided to study architecture and his
family had chosen for him the École des Beaux Arts in Paris. There-
fore in 1892–93, May, Randolph and their mother Mary Martha
moved to the French capital. A subtle, omnipresent and all-guiding
Will had decreed that their choice would open to the young woman
a road, which would lead her to a great destiny, comprising “the
priceless honor of a martyr’s death” in Argentina in 1940(Shoghí
Effendí, qtd. in Holley, “May Ellis Maxwell” 642), if only she would
understand the true meaning of events and seize her God-given

opportunities. And through her Paris, that ancient town of material
and intellectual glories, would witness the earliest dawning of a new
age of light—whose fruits only the future will reveal—for the old
European continent.

Paris: a magical name that—in the people of Europe, so proud
of their heritage of culture and history—still evokes mixed feel-
ings of confident admiration and consuming longing. In the Belle
Époque(1871–1914)— an echo of whose sounds may still be enjoyed
in Jacques Offenbach’s(1819–1880) most renowned melodies, like
his galop infernal known as Cancan—the French capital well deserved
to be called la Ville Lumière, the City of Lights, for the blaze of its
nocturnal lamps and shining minds in a continent just entering a
modern age, seemingly filled with infinite promises. After 1889 the
Tour Eiffel, with its futuristic profile of iron pillars and girders stood
above the Seine with its 320 meters, a promise of future achieve-
ments, unimaginable only a few decades before. With its two and half
million people, renowned boulevards, quays and places, intense city
traffic, industrious economic and commercial activities, brilliant
society life and intellectual audacity, Paris was indeed the capital
of an Europe, which was in those days more than ever convinced of
its invincible supremacy over the world, a supremacy which no one
would ever expect to be so soon undermined.

The meaning of those days is as yet not fully grasped, possibly
because the extraordinary Power that, after 1844, is mysteriously
shaping the course of human history is not yet sufficiently known
and understood. Unknown is the real source of the Romantic ideas
of a century that, after the cloying doltishness of Arcadia and Rococo,
was obscurely craving after a perfect Ideal, a century that was eager
to break with a recent past, perceived as narrow and empty, and was
yearning after the Infinite with impetuous thrust and adolescent
blindness. The greatest minds of those years felt an irrepressible

Mayflowers in the Ville Lumière

longing for a greatness that they themselves could not define. Their
intense longing brought them to an outburst of passions, whose pulse
can be perceived in their sculptures, paintings, novels, poems, melo-
dies, sometimes in their ideals of life and in their open rebellion to a
widespread, dull acquiescence to the dictates of a venerable tradition
by that time divested of any meaning and truth.

This enthusiastic search, which had manifold expressions in the
course of the nineteenth century, was manifest in the Paris of the
fin de siècle more than anywhere else in the Western world. In
that city, Claude Debussy(1862–1918), “le gamin de Paris [the
Paris urchin],” as Nadejda von Meck(1831–1894), Pyotr Ilyich
Tchaikovsky’s Egeria called him(qtd. in Brockway and Weinstock,
Men of music 529), was expressing unusual sounds and harmonies,
disregarding most of the canons of European musical tradition
after Bach. Edouard Manet(1832–1883) had already completed
his pictorial work under the banner of “a spontaneous and lively
transcription of the first glance”(Daydí, “Éduard Manet” 218),
openly defying the rhetoric triumphalism of the academic official
painting style upheld by the powerful Académie de Beaux Arts and
represented by such artists as Jean-Leon Gérôme(1824–1903)
and Alexandre Cabanel(1823–1889). The Impressionists—Edgar
Degas(1834–1917), Claude Monet(1840–1926) and Pierre Auguste
Renoir(1841–1919)—had already finished their aesthetical revolu-
tion based upon the primacy of light. They had already transfigured
physical beauty into a symbol which, as earthly as it was, spoke of a
spiritual dimension, which nevertheless most of them ignored in their
lives. Stéphane Mallarmé(1842–1898), Paul Verlaine(1844–1896),
and Arthur Rimbaud(1854–1891) had already depicted, through
their verses, a world wherefrom a remote scent of Eternity is wafting.
It was the Eternity that they, atheistic and immersed in a sensuous,
sometimes perverted, life as they were—described in the numerous
Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec’s(1864–1901) canvases, watercolors,
prints, posters and drawings—were unconsciously seeking. Their

Lights of ‘Irfán Book Twelve

sensuousness was aspiring to impossible heights of material perfec-
tion and beauty. And in every height a man is struggling to scale, he
fancies that he will at long last discover his real self, i.e., that same
Eternity he so often wants to deny. As a nineteen-year-old Rimbaud
wrote in 1873 in his Une Saison en Enfer(A Season in Hell):

Finally, O reason, O happiness, I cleared from the sky the blue which
is darkness, and I lived as a golden spark of this light Nature. In my
delight, I made my face look as comic and as wild as I could:

> It is recovered.
> What?—Eternity.
> In the whirling light
> Of the sun in the sea.
> O my eternal soul,
> Hold fast to desire
> In spite of the night
> And the day on fire.
> You must set yourself free
> From the striving of Man
> And the applause of the World
> You must fly as you can...
> —No hope forever
> No orietur.
> Science and patience,
> The torment is sure.
> The fire within you,
> Soft silken embers,
> Is our whole duty
> But no one remembers.
> It is recovered.
> What? Eternity.
> In the whirling light
> Of the sun in the sea.(< www.mag4.net/Rimbaud/poesies/
> Alchemy.htm >)

In this town, where peaks of knowledge, refinement, beauty and art
arose above abysses of moral and spiritual decay, our young Ameri-
can lady was waiting for an answer to many questions stirring her
heart. What was that light which, a long time before in her home in
Englewood, had shined so luminous in her dream as to leave her, an

Mayflowers in the Ville Lumière

eleven years old child, blinded for a whole day? And moreover, why
had those angels brought her so far through space, showing, from
those remote distances, the earth overflowing with light, and upon
the earth an inscription, only two letters of which—B and H—she
could read? What was the meaning of those letters, which—she was
absolutely certain—had a world-transforming power? And, last but
not least, who was the Man—clad in a loose Oriental robe, His face
framed by flowing silvery hair and a long white beard, deep blue eyes,
a kind, fatherly smile—Who was calling her to Himself beyond the
shores of a cerulean sea? May could not explain those strange visions,
which had left a mysterious feeling in her heart. Her life could not be
described as wholly happy. She was surrounded by love. Her mother
and brother were fond of her. But when she was about 20 years-old
she fell ill of a strange ailment that no doctor could ever diagnose and
that made her body very weak. And thus she was often bedridden,
her days spent in rest were long, and at the same time her spirit was
thirsty, she felt an incomprehensible, unappeased yearning within
her heart.

But the subtle Will—Whose Love and Loving Kindness cradle each
human being even before his human parents become the joyous
instruments of his entry into this privileged level of creation—was
mysteriously weaving the threads of her life, so that at the right
time she could change from a chrysalis into a moth through her
efforts blessed by the divine confirmations. Mrs. Phoebe Apperson
Hearst(1842–1919), the affluent American philanthropist, offered
to Mrs. Mary Martha Bolles her apartment on the Quay d’Orsay in
Paris, “in exchange for the minor inconvenience of assisting with the
management of the suite when its mistress was absent”(Hogenson,
Lighting 58).

It was the beginning of October 1898 when one fine day Mrs. Phoebe
Hearst came to Paris, with a group of friends. They were bound—
she said—for Egypt, where they intended to go up the Nile. But May

Lights of ‘Irfán Book Twelve

was so sensitive and so keen were the instruments of her insight, that
she could not fail to perceive the reflection of a mysterious fire, hid-
den in those hearts, especially in that of the beautiful, brown-haired,
blue-eyed, ivory-skinned Lua Moore Getsinger(1871–1916), later
appointed by `Abdu’l-Bahá’ Himself as “the Herald of the Covenant.”2

The details of their conversations are unknown. We only know that,
through the words uttered by Lua, May could at long last understand
the meaning of her visions. The longing that induced others—more
renowned then her today in the world—to scale the heights of art
and, in their ignorance of their real Moving Power, to lose themselves
in alluring meanders of sensuous and intellectual dreams, that same
longing led her to the one Object of her love and to the real self-real-
ization. She discovered the path towards the Infinite in her service to
the Glory of God that had just revealed Itself to the world.

The magnanimous Phoebe Hearst could not depart and leave May
on the Seine. Her longing well deserved to be satisfied. Beyond the
shores of the azure Mediterranean Sea the One Who could disclose
the essence of that precious soul in all its beauty was waiting for her.
And Phoebe, who intended to visit Him, brought May with her.

It was the 17th of February 1899 when, at long last appeased, May
met her Master and understood, because she herself experienced
them, the words of Christ: “Blessed is he who shall eat bread in the
Kingdom of God”(Bolles, An Early Pilgrimage 22).

Many years later, `Abdu’l-Bahá wrote about her: “that maidservant of
God is ablaze with the fire of the love of God. Whosoever meets her
feels from her association the susceptibilities of the Kingdom. Her
company uplifts and develops the soul”(“Recent Tablets” 247).3

Mayflowers in the Ville Lumière

Edith MacKay
A middle-aged widow, Marie-Louise MacKay, and her young
daughter, Edith(1878–1959) had been living in Paris for a few years.
Edith who had a beautiful voice frequented Paris’s Conservatoire,
where she “began her singing career with Madame Marie Roge of
the Opera”(de Bons, “Edith de Bons” 878) and was also instructed
by the French Jules Massenet(1842–1912) and the Italian Rug-
gero Leoncavallo(1858–1919), the composer of the opera “Pagliacci
[Players, or Clowns]”.

The same subtle omnipresent Will that had lovingly guided the
young May kindly watched over this brown-haired, sweetly singing,
girl. This Will chose a solemn day, the day that Christian tradition
has associated throughout the centuries with the birth of their Sav-
ior, Christmas Day, to guide her to her predestined goal. She was 21
years-old.

That day in the house of Edith’s godfather there was a party, as in all
other houses. She had been invited. She had meticulously prepared
herself—we can well imagine—for that happy event. She had chosen
an elegant and decent dress. She had carefully fixed her hair. The
roads were busy. There was a great coming and going of happy people.
The air was cold and pungent. There was a Christmas smell. Edith
was captured by that sweet, merry atmosphere.

> As she entered the elegant hall, brightened by Christmas
> decorations and enlivened by a small crowd of merry guests,
> a glimpse was enough for her to identify, among all, a pres-
> ence that immediately took on a special meaning in her
> eyes. That presence was a young lady, with soft brown hair,
> delicate features, clear blue eyes, and a mysterious inner
> flame, hidden from any other eye but Edith’s. “She comes
> from the United States,” they told her. “She is here with her
> mother and brother, a student at the School of Architecture.

> Her name is May Ellis Bolles.” A mysterious power guided
> Edith to the presence of the young woman. Almost unaware,
> Edith looked for a long time at May’s crystal-clear eyes that
> revealed unknown depths of feelings and inner awareness,
> and whispered: “I believe that you have something to tell
> me!” “Yes,” May answered in a breath. And slowly, over the
> course of three days, she revealed to Edith, with measured
> wisdom, the extraordinary secret enshrined in her heart.

Edith soon believed—the second one in Paris, after May. She did
not take a long time to offer that priceless gift to her mother as well,
and, together, in 1901 they themselves went to the Holy Land and
sat at the feet of their newly discovered Master(see de Bons, “Edith
de Bons” 878–81).

Laura Clifford Barney
Laura Clifford Barney(1879–1974) was among those children of
American “good families” who came from the United States to Paris
to refine their culture, attending the renowned Sorbonne University,
the École des Beaux Arts or the Conservatoire, listening to concerts,
visiting museums and, last but not least, frequenting the Parisian
high society. Thus she and her sister Natalie(1876–1972) moved
from the United States to live in a college at Fontainebleau, aux
Ruches. Natalie later became playwright, novelist, poet, memoirist
and epigrammatist, as well as a muse and inspiration of other writers,
like her good friend, the famous French novelist Colette(1873–1954).

Laura came from a family of scholars and artists—her mother
was Alice Pike Barney(1857–1931), the famous American painter,
poet, writer and architect, some of whose paintings are hanging in
the National Museum of Washington D.C. Gifted with a “keen

Mayflowers in the Ville Lumière

intelligence, [a] logical mind and [an] investigating nature”(Giachery,
“Laura Clifford Dreyfus-Barney” 535), she was barely in her twenties

> when, about 1900, she also met the young May Ellis Bolles. Unfor-
> tunately her precious, detailed diaries, which she jealously guarded
“in a mahogany secretaire” in her home in 74, rue Raynouard in

> Paris, were confiscated by the Gestapo during the Nazi occupation
> of Paris(Giachery, “Laura Dreyfus-Barney” 12). And thus we do
> not know her intimate experiences of those days. We can, however,
> imagine that her ideals of world peace, the brotherhood of man and
> the oneness of humankind that she—“a true pioneer in this field… at
> a time when the world was still geographically and politically divided
> and quite insensible to the call of spiritual unity”(Giachery, “Laura
> Clifford Dreyfus-Barney” 535)—strongly felt in her mind and heart
> even as a teen-ager, had found at last a clear expression. And after an
> early visit to the Master she enrolled in the new Faith. Her repeated
> visits to the Master “became the centre of… [her] life and inspiration”
> and, whenever she related their many details, “an expression of rap-
> ture and wonderment”(Giachery, “Laura Clifford Dreyfus-Barney”
> 535) appeared on her face.

> We owe to her spiritual and intellectual curiosity the famous col-
> lection of utterances by `Abdu’l-Bahá known as Some Answered
> Questions. Between 1904 and 1906, during repeated visits to ‘A kká,
> at table, in the dining room of `Abdu’lláh Páshá’s House, where
`Abdu’l-Bahá had transferred His residence in October 1896, the

> v),the manifold questions which the young American lady asked
> on such deep topics as the origin and nature of man, his material,
> intellectual and spiritual powers, the origin of creation, its relation-
> ship with its Creator and many others. She carefully recorded His
> answers. And since she believed that what had been “so valuable”
> to her might “be of use to others, since all men, notwithstanding
> their difference, are united in their search for reality”(Dreyfus

> Barney, “Introduction” vi), she later presented her notes to Him
> for His approval. She finally had them published in London in 1908,
> leaving to posterity a book “unique” in the “entire field” of “religious
> history”(MUH J63 282). Humankind will never be grateful enough
> to her for this gift, which Shoghí Effendí defined as her “imperishable
> service”(GPB 260). In that book the fundamental tenets of the divine
> philosophy of `Abdu’l-Bahá are expounded, a philosophy which will
> be the basis of any future philosophy in the entire world(see Giachery,
“Laura Clifford Dreyfus-Barney” 536–7).

However, her accomplishments also included a focus on “humanitar-
ian and social activities in her work for world peace”, that she pursued
with “undaunted zeal”(Giachery, “Laura Clifford Dreyfus-Barney”
535). As early as 23 July 1925, she was appointed Chevalier de la
Légion d’Honneur and in 1937 she was elevated to the rank of Officier
de la Légion d’Honneur. Mona Khademi comments upon the life of
this precious lady as follows:

> proper recognition has eluded Laura Dreyfus Barney both
> within the Bahá’í community as well as the world. One reason
> may be the lack of her diaries or memoirs. Another factor may
> be that she still stands in the shadow of her prominent and
> accomplished spouse, Hippolyte Dreyfus-Barney. Yet another
> might be that she divided her time between two countries,
> which was uncommon in those days. Therefore her heroism
> has been lost in unexamined history.(“Glimpse” 73–4)

Thomas Breakwell
Having a lucrative job in a cotton mill in the south of the United
States, Thomas Breakwell(1872–1902), a cultured, refined English-
born man, could afford to visit every summer his country and to
take long vacations in the old Europe(see Lakshiman-Lepain, Life of

Thomas Breakwell). That year, 1901, he had come to Europe for other
reasons, as well:

> His conscience tormented him because his employment
> afforded numerous opportunities to witness at first hand
> abuse of workers—especially the child labourers… Troubled,
> he had taken a leave of absence from his work and headed for
> Europe hoping to forget the injustices that gnawed him, by
> visiting his British family and touring that continent. Per-
> haps another more ominous reason for the journey was to
> seek treatment for his recurring tuberculosis.(Hogenson,
> Lighting 185)

While crossing the Channel on a boat bound to France, he met a
certain Mrs. Milner. Mrs. Milner, so clever, passionate and charming
for her interest in the most unusual aspects of human life, was con-
sidered by the young Thomas as a most pleasant interlocutor. Among
many other things, they also discussed theosophy, the new spiritual
science which for many people was only fashion, while for others it
was a way of nourishing a longing for the Infinite that they could not
otherwise express. The more familiar Mrs. Milner became with the
young man, the more convinced she was that she should arrange a
meeting for him with that young Bahá’í American lady, who lived in
Paris and was so deep in her knowledge of spiritual topics, Miss May
Ellis Bolles. Yes, in Paris she would arrange a meeting for them. And
the unaware Thomas did not yet realize that in the French capital
that young American lady would clarify certain precious feelings he
had been concealing in his heart. Not so long ago, for three consecu-
tive months, he had felt as though he was soaring through a rarefied
atmosphere of love and harmony, while his heart was burning in its
love for an unknown and mysterious Supreme Beauty, in peace, in
perfect unity with all humankind.

In Paris May was waiting for him, albeit she was not aware. At the
beginning of that summer, when Mary Martha Bolles was going
to leave for the French coast of Brittany, as she did every year, for
a vacation with her children, `Abdu’l-Bahá Himself had suggested
that May should not follow her, that she should not leave Paris until
a word came from Him. Mary Martha was so disappointed, maybe
even disturbed: May was so frail, she needed sunshine and sea-air.
Paris was too warm and muggy in the summer for her health. Mírzá
Abu’l-Fad.l, the Persian believer later designated by the Guardian of
the Bahá’í Faith as one of the nineteen “Apostles of Bahá’u’lláh,” sent
by `Abdu’l-Bahá to Europe so that he may deepen that early handful
of believers, wrote to the Master about Mrs. Bolles’s apprehensions
for her daughter. But He did not change His mind. And May was
inflexible in her determination to comply with His wish. Mary Mar-
tha had to give up. And Mrs. Edith Tewksbury Jackson, a wealthy
American lady that had known and accepted the Faith through May,
gave May hospitality in a flat connected to her luxurious residence, so
that she should not remain alone. The apartment in 100 Rue du Bac,
not far from the Bon Marché department store, where the Bolles had
moved in June of 1899, was closed.

> It was a bright summer’s day. When May welcomed her newly arri-
> ved guests, she was pleasantly surprised to see Mrs. Milner, who
“knew nothing of the Bahá’í teaching and had closed her ears to its

> message”(Maxwell, “A Brief Account” 707), accompanied by a young
> man, “of medium height, slender, erect and graceful, with intense
> eyes and an indescribable charm”(Maxwell, “A Brief Account” 707).
> His deep dark eyes reminded her of a “veiled light”(Maxwell, “Letter”
> 298). That ardent and thirsty soul was still enfolded in “the veil which
> is over every soul until it is rent asunder by the power of God in this
> day,” the veils of its ignorance of God(Maxwell, “Letter” 298). They
> talked for a long time, touching many topics of common interest, the-
> osophy, spirituality. And during their conversation, she studied him

with great attention, coming to consider him “a very rare person of
standing and culture, simple, natural, intensely real in his attitude
toward life and his fellowmen”(Maxwell, “A Brief Account” 707).
May was not surprised when, saying goodbye, he asked permission
to meet her again.

> The day after, when Thomas came to her, his face was glowing, his
> voice was vibrant. His radiant soul was now unveiled, a new light
> shone from him. May made him comfortable. And immediately
> he told her of the mysterious experience he had the evening before.

When he had left May’s house, he had gone to the Champs Élysées.
“The air was warm and heavy, not a leaf was stirring.” And yet all of a

> sudden he had been invested by a gust of wind, which for a long time
> had continued to whirl around his body. A very sweet voice emerged
> from that whirl: “Christ has come again! Christ has come again!”
> Then the wind had died down. And a sweet peace had pervaded his
> heart as well. He stared at her, “with wide startled eyes”(Maxwell,
“A Brief Account” 707), and asked her whether she thought he was

> crazy. No, it was not craziness; it was the beginning of a new wisdom.
> And May kindly and patiently disclosed to him the doors through
> which he could at long last reach that Truth that had always been in
> wait for him. In three days the young Thomas got rid of all previous
> shackles. His soul, at long last freed, dived into the boundless ocean
> of the Faith of God. His “veiled light” shone now in its meridian
> splendor. Although his life was very short, he passed away in June
> 1902 at the age of 30, Shoghí Effendí mentioned him, with George
> Townshend and John Ebenezer Esslemont, as one of “three luminar-
> ies shedding brilliant luster on annals of Irish, English and Scottish
> Bahá’í communities”(MBW 173). Soon a cable arrived from the
> Master, “You may leave Paris at any time”(Maxwell, “A Brief Account”
> 709). The following morning May joined her anxious mother in her
> vacation in Brittany(see Maxwell, “A Brief Account” 707–11).

Edith Sanderson

> Edith Sanderson(1870–1955) too had come to Paris by the end of
> the nineteenth century. She had arrived in the French capital soon
> after the death of her father, the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court
> of California, together with her mother and three sisters. One of her
> sisters, Sybil(1864–1903), a girl of unusual beauty, was endowed
> with a voice of an extraordinary range(from low G to contre sol) and
> thus the family wanted her to study at the Paris’ Conservatoire. In
> 1887 Sybil met Massenet and became his favored soprano and one of
> the most famous operatic sopranos during the Parisian Belle Époque.
> She debuted in Massenet’s Manon and had enormous success in his
> Thaïs in 1894. Massenet had written for her the title role. The French
> composer also dedicated to her two of his celebrated Mélodies [Songs],
“Pensée d’automne [Autumn Thought]” after a poem by Armand Sil-

> vestre(1887) and “Beaux yeux que j’aime [Beautiful eyes which I love]”
> after a poem by Thérèse Maquet(1891).

Edith met May in 1901 and soon accepted the Faith. From that
moment on she devoted all her qualities to the diffusion of the
Bahá’í message. The Master used to call her “My daughter.”
Although “fragile in appearance,” she had an exceptional will-
power. She studied the Writings in depth and, in her love for
the holy Word, she became conversant in Persian. Her spiritual
sensitivity, her love for nature—flowers, trees, the sea, the beauty
of the clouds—the “rarified atmosphere” that surrounded her
made of her a point of attraction for many seekers of truth. She
was in touch with famous personalities of her time, like the French
scholar Louis Alphonse Daniel Nicolas(1864–1939), an authority
on the Bábí movement, the Jesuit philosopher Pierre Teilhard de
Chardin(1881–1955) and Simone Weil(1909–1943), the French
philosopher and mystic, and “groups who were interested in social
and spiritual questions”(Dreyfus Barney, “Edith Sanderson” 889).

Hippolyte Dreyfus-Barney

> The Sandersons were the instruments through which that same
> Will, Who was lovingly taking care of those early Bahá’í lights in
> the old European continent, presented Hippolyte Isidore Drey-
> fus(1873–1928) with the opportunity of fulfilling his high spiritual
> destiny: “kindling the torch which is destined to shed eternal illu-
> mination upon his native land and its people”(Shoghí Effendí, “Hip-
> polyte Dreyfus-Barney” 210). They were women of great charm:
> beautiful, clever, cultured, refined and gifted with a rare spirituality.
> Hippolyte Dreyfus was “strong in appreciation of life and all that
> it has to offer… a well balanced and independent person”(Dreyfus-
> Barney, “Hippolyte Dreyfus-Barney”), who “combined a rare
> sweetness of nature with great firmness and strength”(Maxwell,
“Hippolyte Dreyfus Barney” 27) and inspired “confidence with his

> frankness”(Natalie Clifford Barney, qtd. in Hippolyte Dreyfus, sec. 7).
> An “agnostic”(Maxwell, “Hippolyte Dreyfus-Barney” 26) in those
> days, when he was still preparing himself for his future life, he was
> gifted with a “questing mind” that “led him onward to ever-vaster
> horizons,” with a “generous heart” that enabled him to “understand
> the difficulties of human life and to be close to people”(Dreyfus-
> Barney, “Hippolyte Dreyfus-Barney”) and with the “rare quality
> of being more interested in others than in himself ”(ibid.). Thus he
> also felt in the depth of his heart that something else exists beyond
> material life. And, like many others of his generation, this feeling
> initially drew him towards occult sciences; however, occult sciences
> disappointed him.4

Hippolyte met the Sandersons in the summer of 1900 in the salon
of his mother, Lea Marie Sophie Inés Cardozo Meyer(1848–1913),
who “used to give musicales frequented by people of taste, including
many artists”(Dreyfus-Barney, “Hippolyte Dreyfus-Barney”). At that
time Sybil Sanderson was a well-known singer of Paris’ Opera. The
Sandersons and Hippolyte, we can well imagine, felt an immediate
and reciprocal attraction. Thus the American ladies could not refrain

> from introducing him to the person whom they, like the entire group of
> their “Parisian” friends in love with the new Faith, considered as their
“spiritual guide, who started the Baha’i group in France”(Dreyfus-

Barney, “Hippolyte Dreyfus-Barney”), May Ellis Bolles.

> Born into a well-known French Jewish family—his father Georges
> Arthur Lucien(1840–1911) was a wealthy stock-broker—Hippolyte
“had all the advantages that could be obtained from a happy home

> and from an intellectual and artistic center such as Paris at the height
> of its culture”(Dreyfus-Barney, “Hippolyte Dreyfus-Barney”). He
“liked both thought and action. He could sit at his desk and translate

> and read all day and late into the night. Or he could go for a swim or
> horseback ride with friends or alone”(ibid.). His sister-in-law Natalie
> Clifford Barney said about him: “He loved good eating… He liked
> riding through the woods of St. Cloud or St. Cucupha. He could
> make tractable, even gentle, the worst horse. He was a marvelous
> swimmer”(qtd. in Hippolyte Dreyfus, sec. 7). Surrounded by “the
> whirl of a Parisian life” as he was, his sincere altruism and love for
> his fellow-human beings lead him to found, together with a friend, “a
> welfare society for home visiting,” the Société des Visiteurs, and to be
“untiring in his support of those who had so little of that of which he

> had so much”(Dreyfus-Barney, “Hippolyte Dreyfus-Barney”). Thus,
> the words which the ardent May told him could but immediately
> attract him. Hippolyte used to speak little of himself and of the past.
> Therefore we do not know the details of their conversation. The only
> thing we know is that very soon he accepted that Faith, which he
> had already met through the writings of such distinguished French
> scholars, as Huart Clément, Count Joseph Arture de Gobineau,
> Louis Alphonse Daniel Nicolas and Joseph Ernest Renan(see Drey-
> fus-Barney, “Hippolyte Dreyfus-Barney”). Now he finally also met,
> on the one hand, its soul-transforming power and, on the other, its
> revolutionizing principles, first among them oneness in its threefold
> expression: “There is one God; mankind is one; the foundations of
> religion are one”(ABL 19). The young Hippolyte took at once the

> opportunity that a generous Destiny was offering to him. And in
> that group of American expatriates he became the first French Bahá’í.
> As May Bolles wrote about him: “Although he had never believed in
> any force transcending nature, nor had he received intimations of the
> possible existence of a Supreme Being, yet after hearing of the advent
> of Baha’u’llah his inner susceptibilities became unfolded”(“Hippolyte
> Dreyfus Barney” 26). About ten years later, in London, at the end of
“a remarkable cosmopolitan gathering… [that ] filled the large ball

> at the Westminster Palace Hotel, Friday evening, December 20th
> [1912], to listen to an address by Abdul Baha”(Fraser, “Abdul Baha in
> London” 5) on the topic of peace, he himself said as part of his concise
> closing remarks:

> everything in the world manifests God to a greater or less
> degree. We can find the divine in the beautiful melodies
> that are sung by the birds in the forests, the divine in
> nature, but we find it specially in man, who is at the sum-
> mit of creation, and especially in those supreme beings
> who are called the prophets. It is in understanding their
> teaching that we can reach the knowledge of God.(qtd. in
> Fraser, “Abdul Baha in London” 10)

> After May had acquainted him with the Bahá’í message, he straight
> away addressed a letter to `Abdu’l-Bahá: he was determined to devote
> his whole life and his talents to the achievement of the ideal his newly-
> found Faith had revealed to him. Soon after, in 1902, he left together
> with his friend Sydney Sprague(1875–1943) for Haifa to meet the
> Master. And after a second visit to `Abdu’l-Bahá in 1903 he “gave
> up his legal career”(Bilani, “Hippolyte Dreyfus”), as “the secretary
> of one of the most prominent barristers in France”(Dreyfus-Barney,
“Hippolyte Dreyfus-Barney”), and decided “to devote himself to

> oriental studies, enrolling in the religious-studies section of the
> École Pratique des Hautes Études in Paris, where he studied Arabic
> and Persian with Hartwig Derenbourg and Clément Huart”(Bilani,

“Hippolyte Dreyfus”). It was thus that he became “the only Western

Bahai of his generation who received such formal training”(ibid.).

Very soon Hippolyte’s father and mother, his sister, Yvonne Mayer-
May, and his brother-in-law, Paul Meyer-May, also joined the Cause.
Laura Dreyfus-Barney writes that “their gracious home was a center
for inquirers and followers. Their summer house, ‘Daru’l-Salam’ on
Mont Pelèrin, Switzerland, was also open wide to people of many
lands and many beliefs”(“Hippolyte Dreyfus-Barney”).

Thus began the unique spiritual adventure of the first French Bahá’í,
who, in Shoghí Effendí’s words, “by his brilliant gifts of mind and heart
as well as by the divers achievements of his life, has truly enriched the
annals of God’s immortal Faith”(“Hippolyte Dreyfus-Barney” 210).
Active in the defense of the Faith in its earliest days—in 1902 he met,
together with Lua Getsinger, the Shah of Persia to plead the cause of
the persecuted Bahá’ís in Iran—a travel teacher in Burma and India
with his friend Sidney Sprague as early as 1904(see Sprague, Year), he
was among the first translators in a Western language of the Bahá’í
Writings, such as the Aqdas, the Íqán, the Súrih of the Temple, the
Súratu’l-Bayán(not yet wholly authoritatively translated), the Will
and Testament of `Abdu’l-Bahá, and the celebrated Leçons de St Jean
d’Acre(known in English as Some Answered Questions). It was while
translating this latter book into French together with Laura Clifford
Barney that the two, who had been close friends for several years, dis-
covered their reciprocal love. In 1910 they married and he added her
surname to his own, changing it into “Dreyfus-Barney.”

As early as 26 October 1903, just at the beginning of Hippolyte’s
Bahá’í career, `Abdu’l-Bahá had written about him:

> As to Dreyfus, in truth he is a bird among the birds of Para-
> dise. Very soon such melodies shall appear from him as the

> souls will be amazed and God will make him a propagator of
> His breezes in those regions.(qtd. in Hippolyte Dreyfus, sec. 12)

And on 21 December 1928, shortly after his passing Shoghí Effendí
penned the following words in a private letter to Laura Dreyfus-
Barney, Hippolyte’s his widow:

> None, I can confidently assert, among the Bahá’ís of the
> East and of the West, combined to the extent that he did
> the qualities of genial and enlivening fellowship, of intimate
> acquaintance with the manifold aspects of the Cause, of
> sound judgment and distinctive ability, of close familiarity
> with the problems and conditions of the world—all of which
> made him such a lovable, esteemed and useful collaborator
> and friend.(21 December 1928, to Laura Khanum)

On the same day Shoghí Effendí wrote to the Bahá’í world:

> His gifts of unfailing sympathy and penetrating insight,
> his wide knowledge and mature experience, all of which
> he utilized for the glory and propagation of the Message
> of Bahá’u’lláh, will be gratefully remembered by future
> generations who, as the days go by, will better estimate the
> abiding value of the responsibilities he shouldered for the
> introduction and consolidation of the Bahá’í Faith in the
> Western world.(“Hippolyte Dreyfus-Barney” 210)

Agnes Baldwin Alexander
Although this spring flower of the Faith did not bloom in Paris, she
deserves to be mentioned here because of the close friendship that
bound her to that Parisian group of God-intoxicated believers. Agnes

Baldwin Alexander(1875–1971) was born in the Hawaii Islands on
the 21st of July 1875, from a family of deep faith who in 1831 went
to those remote Pacific islands as Christian missionaries and was
25 years old when she left the country where she was born bound
for the old European continent. In autumn 1900, in Rome, where
she had gone to visit an aunt who had married an Italian gentleman,
the benign, omnipresent Will had prepared for her an opportunity,
which, if but she would seize it, as she did, would completely change
the course of her earthly and spiritual life.

When she arrived in Rome, she settled in a pensione at 57 Via Sistina,
just a stone’s throw from Trinità dei Monti, where she met an Ameri-
can lady, with her two daughters. She immediately felt a strange
fascination for that unknown lady. Grown up as she had on a remote
island, very far from the European continent, Agnes was very shy.
However, so strong was the attraction she felt toward that lady, that
she managed to overcome her own bashfulness and to approach her,
so that she may come to know her better. She herself said about that
meeting with that American lady and her two daughters:

> Across the long table in the dining-room I saw them. They
> seemed to have a radiance and happiness different from
> others and I could hardly take my eyes from them. A few
> days later as I sat in the parlor I overheard the mother in
> conversation with a lady who had heard in Paris of the Baha’i
> Message from Mr. Mason Remey. Little did I comprehend
> what it was they were talking about, but my heart was stirred
> and the realization came to me that it was the Truth.(Linard,
> Autobiographical Materials, see also Alexander, “Comment je
> devins baha’i”)

The opportunity to talk to her arose when Agnes met them in the
elevator. Agnes took the hand of the unknown lady in hers and
told her: “You hide a secret, share it with me.” The lady, not at all

surprised by her words, answered that they could meet after dinner,
in the back parlor.

She told Agnes that her name was Charlotte Emily Brittingham
Dixon(1852–1920 c.). She did not mention that she was a descendant
from one of the oldest families of European settlers in New England
and had accepted the Bahá’í Faith in 1897. For the whole evening she
pleasantly entertained Agnes, touching on several arguments. While
saying goodbye, Mrs. Dixon gave her a small sheet of paper, with a
short hand-written prayer. When Agnes was alone in her room, she
eagerly read it. “It answered all the longings of my heart,” she said
later, speaking of that script. They had arranged to meet the evening
of the day after. Agnes went to the meeting-place in great expecta-
tion. But the secret was not yet revealed. Nothing happened for three
subsequent evenings. Every night, Agnes retired to her room, a prey
of such emotions that made her sleepless. It was the night of the 26th
of November 1900, when, unable to rest in her anxiety, she suddenly
felt within herself the certitude that Mrs. Dixon’s mystery was that
Christ had returned to earth.

Next morning, as soon as she got up, she immediately went to Mrs.
Dixon to share her new insight with her. Mrs. Dixon then felt finally
free to speak openly of Bahá’u’lláh, of `Abdu’l-Bahá, of the Bahá’í
Faith—she had just arrived from the Holy Land where she had met
the Master. And Agnes immediately promised her enduring alle-
giance to that Faith.

When Mrs. Dixon left Rome, Agnes remained alone. No one was
willing to share her enthusiasm for the Faith she had just discovered.
She often met indifference, sometimes indignation and even hostility.
Mrs. Dixon had given her the address of an American believer who
lived in Paris. Agnes wrote to this person. The letter she received
in answer said among other things: “Please God we may soon wel-
come you in our midst in Paris and that you may then receive the

full Revelation, and much help and instruction”(quoted in Linard,
Autobiographical Materials, see also Alexander, “Comment je devins
baha’i”). In March 1901 Agnes went to the French capital, where in
100 Rue du Bac she finally met that long-awaited friend, May Ellis
Bolles, who appeared to her as an angel of light “filled with a consum-
ing love which the Master said was divine”(ibid.)

May introduced her into the hall where the Bahá’í friends in Paris—
Laura Barney, Thomas Breakwell, Hippolyte Dreyfus, Emogene
Hoagg, Herbert Hopper, Marion Jack, Edith MacKay, Edith Sand-
erson, Sidney Sprague and others, most of them expatriates—gath-
ered for their meetings. She saw faces beaming with peace and light
and light was everywhere in that blessed hall. She said: “Such an
atmosphere of pure light pervaded… that one was transported, as
it were, from the world of man to that of God”(Personal Recollections
8). Later on `Abdu’l-Bahá wrote about those friends: “All men are
asleep; you are awake. All eyes are blind; yours are seeing. All ears are
deaf; your hearing is clear. All tongues are mute; you are eloquent. All
humanity is dead; and you are full of life, vigor and force through the
benefits of the Holy Spirit”(qtd. in de Bons, “Edith de Bons” 878–79,
see Marsella, “Agnes Baldwin Alexander” 423–30).

In June 1901 she received in Paris a Tablet from `Abdu’l-Bahá. It
said:

> Be… a divine bird, proceed to thy native country, spread the
> wings of sanctity over those spots and sing and chant and
> celebrate the Name of thy Lord, that thou mayest gladden
> the Supreme Concourse and make the seeking souls hasten
> unto thee as the moths hasten to the lamp, and thus illumine
> that distant country by the Light of God.(quoted in Linard,
> Autobiographical Materials, see also Alexander, “Comment je
> devins baha’i”)

Responsive to His call, on the 26th of December 1901 she returned
home to Hawaii. Her life had been completely changed. That shy girl
had already become a great teacher of this modern message of one-
ness and peace, a person whom the Guardian would choose, on the
27th of March 1957, as one of the Hands of the Cause of God.

***

It was late 1902 when May, married now to the Canadian architect
William Sutherland Maxwell(1874–1951)—who later was honored
with seeing his project for the marble superstructure of the Shrine
of the Báb on Mount Carmel realized—left Paris and moved to
Montreal, Canada.5

Today—as to its spiritual life—Paris is still as the Master described it,
“silent… exceedingly dispirited and is in a state of torpor”(SWAB 102–3).

> As `Abdu’l-Bahá wrote, “although the French nation is an active and
> lively one… the world of nature hath fully stretched its pavilion over Paris
> and hath done away with religious sentiments”(SWAB 102–3). And yet,
> as He wrote, a day will come when the “power of the Covenant shall
> heat every freezing soul, shall bestow light upon everything that is dark
> and shall secure for the captive in the hand of nature the true freedom of
> the Kingdom”(SWAB 102–3). On that day the deep meaning of these
> short stories will become manifest. And the European continent—

> which has been the cradle of a civilization to some of whose
> beneficent features the pen of Bahá’u’lláh has paid signifi-
> cant tribute; on whose soil both the Greek and Roman civi-
> lizations were born and flourished; which has contributed so
> richly to the unfoldment of American civilization; the foun-
> tainhead of American culture; the mother of Christendom,
> and the scene of the greatest exploits of the followers of Jesus

> Christ; in some of whose outlying territories have been won
> some of the most resplendent victories which ushered in the
> Golden Age of Islam; which sustained, in its very heart, the
> violent impact of the onrushing hosts of that Faith, intent on
> the subjugation of its cities, but which refused to bend the
> knee to its invaders, and succeeded in the end in repulsing
> their assault(CF 26)

—this continent will be able to bequest the most precious legacy of his
ancient civilization to the whole world. It is not the materialistic and
unspiritual civilization, that seems today on the point of invading the
whole world, but the fruit of the spiritual vivification of its unquench-
able and fearless spirit of search that has always characterized it from
the time when the legendary Ulysses crossed the Pillars of Hercules.
