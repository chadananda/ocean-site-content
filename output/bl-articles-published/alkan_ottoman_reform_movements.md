> **Abstract:** This paper examines the relationship between the Young Ottoman and Young Turk reform movements and the Bahá'ís that was established probably from the time of Bahá'u'lláh’s exile to Istanbul and Edirne and certainly from 1868 with Bahá'u'lláh’s banishment to Palestine. The emphasis of this article is not the convergence of ideas but the nature of the contacts and the impressions of the Young Ottomans and Young Turks of the Babis and Bahá'ís. Regarding the convergence of ideas, suffice it to say that Bahá'u'lláh and 'Abdu’l-Baha", his successor and authorised interpreter of his writings, have referred to topics such as ‘consultation,’ ‘liberty,’ ‘constitutional monarchy,’ and democracy’ which were also discussed among reformist intellectuals in the Ottoman Empire as well as in Persia.

> Bahà", his successor and authorised interpreter of his writings, have
> referred to topics such as ‘consultation,’ ‘liberty,’ ‘constitutional monar-
> chy,’ and ‘democracy’ which were also discussed among reformist
> intellectuals in the Ottoman Empire as well as in Persia (Momen
> 1983; Buck 1991; Cole 1992 and 1998; Alkan 1998).

1. Reform and Opposition in the Ottoman Empire

> The years 1839–1876 are known as the Tanzimat (‘reordering’) period
> in the history of the Ottoman Empire. Successive sultans and their
> high-ranking ministers aimed to reform the Ottoman state as to com-
> pete with the European Powers and to prevent their infringement
> upon the internal Ottoman matters. The reforms were proclaimed
> basically through three imperial edicts: the Gülhane Hatt-ı }erîﬁ (Noble
> Edict of Gülhane/Istanbul) of 1839, the Islahât Fermanı (Reform Edict)
> of 1856 and the Kânûn-i Esâsî (Substantial Law) of 1876 (Berkes 1998;
> Lewis, 1968; Shaw/Shaw 1977 (2); Uzunçar{ılı/Karal, 1961–83 (7, 8)).
> The central theme of the last was the introduction of the ﬁrst con-
> stitution (me{rutiyet) that was drafted under the auspices of Midhat
> Pasha. The period starting from 1876 is known as the “First
> Constitution” (Birinci Me{rutiyet). Its main aim was to restrict to some
> extent the exercise of the powers of the sultan, and for the ﬁrst time
> it accepted a parliamentary system. The terms of this constitution

254                           

> covered basic rights and privileges, the independence of courts and
> the safety of judges, among other aspects. The reform decrees were
> partially directed toward winning the support of European powers
> and emphasised the equality of all subjects under the law. It allowed
> civil and political rights to Christian subjects. These decrees were
> formulated after European models and moved away from the Islamic
> holy sharì'a. However, the main goal of the reforms was to preserve
> the Ottoman state (Davison 1963; Devereux 1963). After Sultan
> Abdülaziz was deposed by some reformist intellectuals called “Young
> Ottomans” (1876) and the short ineﬀective interregnum of Sultan
> Murad V, Abdülhamid II reigned until 1909. Though he initially
> accepted the constitution and a parliament, in 1878 he closed it
> down and strengthened his position as an absolute ruler for 33 years
> until he was overthrown by the Young Turks revolution, and the
> constitution and parliament were again put into eﬀect ((kinci Me{rutiyet,
“Second Constitution”).

During the Tanzimat many Ottoman students were sent to Europe
> for education in various ﬁelds. They came into contact with diﬀerent
> European ideologies such as liberalism, nationalism and constitu-
> tionalism that deeply inﬂuenced them. Gradually these young intel-
> lectuals who later worked as low-level government oﬃcials, moved
> away from Ottoman traditionalism and expressed their ideas on the
> political, social and religious problems of the Empire and oﬀered
> their remedies in their writings, journals and other literature made
> possible by the emerging press. This group known as the “Young
> Ottomans” (Yeni Osmanlılar) organised itself in the secret ‘Patriotic
> Alliance’ ((ttifâk-i Hamiyyet) in 1865 that became the “Young Ottoman
> Committee” (Yeni Osmanlı Cemiyeti ) two years later. They demanded
> more democratic conditions and favoured a constitutional govern-
> ment; they aimed for Turkey to participate in both at the Western
> and Islamic cultures and to stop the disintegration of the Empire;
> they criticised the superﬁcial reforms being carried out. Their enemy
> was not the sultan but mainly Âli Pasha and Fuad Pasha. In the
> eyes of the Young Ottomans, whose perspectives were rooted in
> orthodox Islamic belief, these secularising pashas were serving European
> imperialism and blindly imitating Western culture. Reforms were not
> enough, their emphasis was on a liberal regime that would ensure
> freedom (hürriyet) so as to halt the decline of the state and stop the
> intervention of the Western Powers. The pashas rejected the idea of
> constitutional rule by saying that the establishment of a national

> assembly would lead to the representation of those nationalistic groups
> who wanted to separate themselves from the Empire and that Ottoman
> society was not prepared for it. The Young Ottomans deemed the
> participation of Muslim and non-Muslim groups in a parliamentary
> system as a good means to arouse in all the feeling of the same
> “fatherland” (vatan) and thus weaken the various nationalistic move-
ments (Mardin 1962).

Because of their radical ideas for which they fought hard many
> Young Ottomans were forced to ﬂee to Europe from 1865 but
> returned from France and England to Istanbul after the death of
> their chief-enemy Âli Pasha in 1871. In 1873 the performance of
> the patriotic play Vatan yahud Silistre (‘Fatherland or Silistria’) of Namık
> Kemal (1840–1888), an eminent poet and writer and one of the
> founders of the “Patriotic Alliance,” caused an uproar. Mainly because
> of their sympathies towards the heir apparent Murad Pasha, Kemal
> and other four of his colleagues were exiled by Sultan Abdülaziz to
> diﬀerent places: he himself to Famagusta in Cyprus; the journalist
> and publisher Ebüzziya Tevﬁk (1848–1913) and the novelist Ahmed
> Midhat (1844–1912) to Rhodes; and Bereketzade (smail Hakkı
> (1850–1918), who was then a young theology student, and Menapirzade
> Nuri Bey (1844–1906), co-founder of the Young Ottoman Committee,
> to 'Akkà in Palestine (Tevﬁk 1974; Bereketzade 1915/1997; Kuntay
> 1944–56 (2/I): 151–80; Tansel 1967 (1)). During their exile, Namık
> Kemal, Ebüzziya Tevﬁk and Bereketzade (smail Hakkı either com-
> municated or came into personal contact with the Bahà"ìs.

2. Young Ottomans and Bahà"ìs

> Ebüzziya Tevﬁk talks in his account of the history of the Young
> Ottomans about the “Bàbìs” who were exiled to 'Akkà via Rhodes.
> He considers their banishment as the result of Iran’s interference in
> Ottoman politics and rejects that they are engaged in religious pro-
> paganda in the Empire. At the same time he regards “Bàbism” as
> a religious belief disguised as a political doctrine intending to start
> a revolution in Iran. Tevﬁk also mentions that “thanks to the kind
> help of an individual named Bahaeddin among them [the Bàbìs],
> who probably is still alive, we received news about Nuri Bey and
> Hakkı Efendi and eventually a response to our letter” (Tevﬁk 1974

(3): 64). With regard to the name “Bahaeddin” it is said that Tevﬁk

256                              

> here obviously is confusing it with “Bahà"u"llàh” (Cole 1998: 69).
> However, it seems that Bahà"u"llàh was generally known in the Haifa-
> 'Akkà area as Bahà"u"d-Dìn. The following report supports this:
> “Lately the prophet of the Baabis, Beha-eddin, died at his country
> house in Acca. He was towards 80 years old. There is a large com-
> munity of Persians, Baabis, in Acca, some of whom have much inﬂu-
> ence” (cited in Momen 1981: 233). Supposedly, this name was also
less theologically problematic than Bahà"u"llàh.

Namık Kemal, apparently, had more contacts with Bahà"u"llàh’s
> half-brother, and opponent, Mìrzà Ya˙yà Íub˙-i Azal and his Azalì
> followers in Famagusta, than with Bahà"ìs. In one of his letters writ-
> ten in Famagusta and dated 1873 in which he describes the city and
its people, he refers to the ‘Bàbìs’ with these words:

> The Bàbìs who sometimes claim prophethood and sometimes divinity,
> and some of whom even God forbid! maintain that they have created
> God, are here . . . The Bàbìs receive more money under the pretext
> of daily salaries than the government oﬃcers. They eat and drink, and
> under the shadow of His Majesty try to divide the Ottoman country;
> they constantly do pray for the total disintegration of the Sublime
> Empire (Kuntay 1944–56 (2/I): 44; Tansel 1967: 240–41).

> And in another letter from 1874 and probably addressed to Midhat
> Pasha he calls them “the most wicked creatures” (e{err-i mevcûdât)
> (Tansel, 1967 (1): 309). Süleyman Nazif, a Turkish writer, refers to
this in his book Nasıruddin }ah ve Babiler:

> That Kemal Bey accepts the Bàbìs as ‘the most wicked creatures’ does
> not discredit 'Abbàs Efendi ['Abdu’l-Bahà"], because, ﬁrst of all, 'Abbàs
> Efendi withdrew from Bàbism and even was praying to God to guard
> him from it . . . It is also true that Íub˙-i Azal was surrounded by a
> company of wicked and degenerate Bàbìs. The power and grandeur
> was on Bahà"u"llàh’s side, as it is only Bahà"u"llàh’s still well estab-
> lished creed and order that is esteemed and inﬂuential in Europe and
> America (Nazif 1923: 53–54).

> Elsewhere Nazif says: 'Abbàs Efendi had told me clearly and emphat-
> ically that he was not a Bàbì” (Ibid.: 53). This statement is sup-
> ported by 'Abdu’l-Bahà" himself who makes a clear distinction between
> the Bàbìs and Bahà"ìs ('Abdu’l-Bahà" 1330/1912: 206), and with ref-
> erence to the Azalìs: “. . . in Iran at present there is a sect made up
> of a few individuals who are called ‘Bàbìs’; they claim allegiance to
> the Bàb but are utterly uninformed of him. They possess secret teach-
> ings, which are utterly opposed to those of Bahà"u"llàh. Now, in

                            257

> Iran, the people know this, but, when they come to Europe, they
> conceal their own teachings and utter the teachings of Bahà"u"llàh . . .
> you will see the true fact that the teachings of Bahà"u"llàh are com-
> pletely at odds with those of this sect” (cited by MacEoin 1983:
228–29).

Saying “Abbàs Efendi withdrew from Bàbism” hints to the fact
> that 'Abdu’l-Bahà" had dissociated himself from the Bàbism his uncle
> Mìrzà Ya˙yà was propagating. Nazif ’s conclusion seems to indicate
> that Namık Kemal was referring to the Azalìs. On the other hand
> Kemal himself remarks that he dictated a theatre play (Gülnihal ) to
> Ahmed Ezel, a son of Mìrzà Ya˙yà (Tansel 1967 (1): 335). Thus,
> Kemal’s relationship to the ‘Bàbìs’ remains ambiguous. In his same
> work Süleyman Nazif mentions that Namık Kemal had communicated
with 'Abdu’l-Bahà":

> When I met 'Abbàs Efendi . . . two years ago [1917] in the town of
> Haifa he told me with complete sorrow that he had an extensive cor-
> respondence with Kemal Bey but that out of worry about investiga-
> tion and persecution in the time of Sultan Abdülhamid II he had burnt
> those letters (Nazif 1923: 52–53).

> Juan Cole mentions that Namık Kemal, sent to Cyprus, had more
> contact with Azalìs than with Bahà"ìs, though he developed a friend-
> ship with the Bahà"ì Mishkìn Qalam, whom the Ottomans had per-
> versely sent to the island with the Azalìs. One of his closest companions
> in exile was }eyh Ahmed Eﬀendi, hero of the Kuleli uprising, who
> had adopted Babism or the Bahà"ì faith in his Cyprus exile. By
> 1876, the year of his release, Namık Kemal was constrained to deny
> rumours circulating in Istanbul that he had become a ‘Bàbì’. It is
> not obvious from the letters of Kemal to which Cole refers that the
> above-mentioned Ahmed Efendi became a Bàbì or Bahà"ì (Cole
> 1992: 11; idem 1998: 69). Due to diﬃcult Ottoman syntax in these
> letters this issue remains vague. There is no satisfactory information
> on Ahmed Efendi who was a leader of the Kuleli Revolt in 1856
against the government ((<demir 1937; Kuntay 1944–53 (2/I): 689–93).

As to Mishkìn Qalam, Cole possibly assumes that “Bahâ"î-i bihi’l-
> ahlâk” (“a Bahà"ì of high ethical standards”) (Tansel, 1967 (1): 454)
> refers to Mishkìn Qalam; in fact, according to the editor of Namık
> Kemal’s letters (index in Tansel 1967 (1)) it is a reference to Bahà"u"llàh.
> If so, Kemal furthermore was in contact with him. However, ﬁrst
> of all, a “Bahà"ì” is a “follower of Bahà".” Secondly, we have examples

258                           

> of other Ottomans referring to him, and they call him a {eyh and
> acknowledge his leadership position. There is some question as to
> whether Tansel’s identiﬁcation in this case is correct. Thus Mishkìn
Qalam may be considered as an alternative.

Süleyman Nazif also remarks that the poet-statesman Ziya Pasha,
> another important Young Ottoman ﬁgure, as maintained by some
> Western historians, had met Íub˙-i Azal when he was governor of
> Cyprus and laid the foundations of the contacts between the Bàbìs
> and the Young Ottomans. Yet there is nothing to support this infor-
> mation (Nazif 1923: 52) nor that 'Abdu’l-Bahà" was acquainted with
Ziya Pasha, and was in contact with him (Ibid.: 18, 53).

In a study of Ziya Pasha, the author (Bilgegil 1970) refers to the
> French historian León Cahun who was personally in contact with
> the Young Ottoman expatriates in Paris, and according to him some
> of them had established contacts with the “Bàbìs” towards 1868: “à
> cette date quelques «Jeune Turcs» sont entrés en rapport avec les
> Bektachis, et les Babis” (Cahun 1924: 545). He also remarks that the
> revolutionary spirit that has been developed by the Young Turks (in
> Europe both the Young Ottomans and the Young Turks were labelled
> as “Young Turks”) through contact with Europe and the revolu-
> tionary spirit that has its roots in Islam, “either in republican and
> collectivist or pantheist and anarchist mysticism,” existed side by side
> and came in contact around 1868 (Cahun, 1924: 545). He states
> that whereas in Istanbul this opposition started among young peo-
> ple who were captivated by reading Western literature, it took a
> diﬀerent Oriental shape in the provinces; the mystical sects, and most
> likely the Bekta{is and the Bàbìs, preached religious reform in Anatolia,
namely in Konya and Üsküdar (Istanbul) (Cahun 1924: 546).

The Bekta{is, a heterodox Shì'ì sect who are said to have been
> revolutionary in essence, were the spiritual leaders of the Janissary
> troops who rebelled against the military reform by Sultan Mahmud
II. He eliminated the corps in 1826, and abolished the Bekta{i order.

It is interesting to note in this regard Namık Kemal’s attachment
> to this order and even his Bekta{i background (Melikoﬀ 1988: 337–39;
> idem 1997: 25–33). Known for their liberal and tolerant ideas and
> their support of the oppressed, the Bekta{is inﬂuenced intellectual
> life in the Ottoman Empire. This community of the oppressed was
> mystical and religious in character; the Bekta{is claim that their creed
> originated in the time of the Karbalà" martyrs and later acquired a
> socio-religious colour; its martyrs became a symbol for all facing

> injustice and coercion. Kemal was inclined to this kind of thought
> since his childhood, and the ideals of liberalism, tolerance and the
> equality of diﬀerent races and social classes he learned of in Europe
found favour in his eyes.

Pushed to secrecy from 1826, the Bekta{is found the support of
> the Freemasons. Both groups shared liberalism, tolerance, non-con-
> formism and anti-clericalism. In addition, the Bekta{i conventions in
> the cities attracted many intellectuals because of the rich Bekta{i cul-
> ture of literature, poetry and music. These educated liberal-minded
> people played a similar role in the Ottoman reform movement, as
did the Masons in the European Enlightenment.

Namık Kemal, like other Ottoman statesmen and intellectuals
> (Gün/Çeliker, 1968: 19; Düzda<ı 1977 (1): 53), joined a Masonic
> lodge. The ideal that Freemasonry aimed at was a society the mem-
> bers of which have equal rights with respect to freedom and laws,
> regardless of race and religion. Thus it is not surprising that Kemal
> joined a movement whose features were close to his hopes and ideals
> he fought for all his life (Melikoﬀ 1999: 302–5). This inclination of
> Namık Kemal makes his aforesaid alleged interest in the Bàbì-Bahà"ì
> religion, whose teachings are based on equality, tolerance and unity
of mankind, more possible.

León Cahun adds in his account: ‘Le parti actif des Babistes
> réfugiés dans l’empire ottoman, sous l’inﬂuence de Yahia, à la suite
> de ses relations avec Zia Pacha, et plus tard avec Mehemed Bey, a
> peu à peu perdu son caractère religieux et s’est fondu, comme parti
> socialiste et révolutionaire, dans le groups les avancés de la “Jeune
> Turcs” ’ (Cahun, 1924: 559). Nazif, too, refers to the loss of the reli-
> gious character of the Bàbì movement: ‘The more the Bàbìs retreated
> towards the West, the goals and fundamentals they pursued also
> changed. The religious movement in Iran gradually took a social
> form’ (Nazif, 1923: 53). The aforementioned ‘Mehemed Bey’ is
> Mehmed Bey, one of the founding members of the Young Ottoman
> society. He was the grandson of the same Necib Pasha (Mardin
> 1962: 10, fn 1) who as governor of Baghdad interrogated Mullà 'Alì
> Bastàmì, an early follower of the Bàb, and exiled him to Istanbul
(Momen 1982: 113–43).

To sum up Nazif ’s account of the Bàbìs and Bahà"ìs: he lengthily
> dwells on the personality of 'Abdu’l-Bahà", and conveys to the reader
> his encounter with him in 1917 in Haifa. 'Abbàs Efendi, ‘son and
> successor of the famous Bahà"u"llàh’, who had withdrawn from Bàbism

260                           

> and established an independent mezheb/madhhab and, as stated by
> himself, a tarikat/†arìqa, moved from 'Akkà to Haifa after the Second
> Constitution (Young Turk coup d’etat 1908). Because his words and
> statements were for the most part distorted, 'Abdu’l-Bahà" initially
> received visitors with suspicion. But then he was assured of Nazif ’s
> sincerity, and talked about all the events since his childhood (Nazif
1923: 18).

A few months after the publication of Beyrut Vilayeti (yearbook of
> the Beirut district; Temimi/Yazar, 1335/1917), in the ﬁrst volume
> of which twelve pages deal with the authors’ three meetings with
> 'Abdu’l-Bahà", Nazif met him in Haifa; the Bahà"ì leader complained
> that his statements and ideas were misrepresented there or not prop-
> erly understood. Nazif conﬁrms that some statements in those pages
> are not congruent with the “manifest intelligence” of 'Abdu’l-Bahà",
> and adds: “I do not know how real 'Abbàs Efendi’s sincerity towards
> me was. I have not witnessed anything that made me think that he
> was insincere” (Nazif 1923: 87). Süleyman Nazif ends the story of
> his encounter with 'Abdu’l-Bahà" with the latter’s words that “We
> have no belief that is contrary to true Islam. Our judgment (ijtihàd)
is in accord with the spirit of Islam” (Ibid.: 88).

In a letter (dated 17 Sha'bàn 1338) written to Nazif in Turkish
> and appended to the book, 'Abdu’l-Bahà" complains about some arti-
> cles on him, published in the newspaper Tasvir-i Efkâr; he says that
> the information was received second hand by Westerners from cer-
> tain persons in Istanbul who outwardly appear as Bàbìs. Nazif,
> 'Abdu’l-Bahà" states, who is a lover of truth and has studied the
> writings of Bahà"u"llàh, should scrutinise his replies to European and
> American newspapers that contain the fundamentals of the Bahà"ì
> movement, and thus free himself from various kinds of prejudices.
> Nazif assures the reader that he wrote down what he read about
> 'Abdu’l-Bahà" and had witnessed himself without alteration, and that,
> after studying the letter and newspapers 'Abdu’l-Bahà" had sent to
him, it is not his to write in favour or against his madhhab or †arìqa.

'Abdu’l-Bahà", furthermore, “by the express invitation” of Midhat
> Pasha, patron of the Young Ottomans in the late 1870s, had met
> him in Beirut sometime in 1879–80 (Shoghi Eﬀendi 1944: 193).
> Hassan Balyuzi remarks: “According to British consular records,
> Mid˙at Pàshà was Governor-General in Damascus from November
> 1878 to August 1880. He visited Haifa and 'Akkà in May 1880.”

> sources, an account of this meeting from Ottoman sources would be
interesting.

Nuri Bey and Bereketzade (smail Hakkı Efendi who were exiled
> to 'Akkà had a warm and close contact with the Bahà"ìs there. In
> his autobiography Yâd-ı Mâzî (1332/1915: 105–20) Bereketzade (smail
> Hakkı gives a vivid and positive picture of the Bahà"ì community in
> 'Akkà. He regards “Mirza Abbas Efendi” ('Abdu’l-Bahà") as “an eru-
> dite and noble ﬁgure who is cognisant of the conditions of the age”
> (âlim ve fâzıl ve ahvâl-ı asıra vâkıf bir necâbet-simât) and goes on saying
that:

> During our stay in 'Akkà Bahà"u"llàh Efendi left the administration of
> community aﬀairs to 'Abbàs Efendi because he had retired to his rented
> house and only appeared to his followers. If 'Abbàs Efendi’s charac-
> ter and attitude is carefully examined it appears that his behaviour
> and manner remind of being rather political than sheikh-like. If an
> article on Iran in the foreign press came across his attentive eyes he
> would, devoting himself to it, explain his thoughts for hours and enjoy
> this so much that he sacriﬁced his sleep and comfort. Sometimes, hav-
> ing written articles in Arabic and Persian, he sent them with their
> French translations to the European press . . . Because he had won the
> hearts of the people of 'Akkà by his friendly association, the beauty
> of his getting along with them, his generosity and goodness, visitors
> rich and poor, Muslim and non-Muslim, would come and go all the
> time to the place used as selamlık [male part of the house] . . . Delicious
> teas and the ﬁnest tobaccos of Shiraz were served with water-pipes to
> the guests. A great many time it happened that 'Abbàs Efendi gave
> banquets in the garden he had bought outside the city walls. After
> going out together for a walk and having eaten, we again used to
> return together to the Fortress.

> (smail Hakkı Efendi further describes the Bahà"ì children who were
> taught the Qur"àn with its Persian meaning, were introduced to
> diﬀerent areas of study and instructed in European languages like
> French and German, and that some members of the community
were occupied with crafts and trade.

Bereketzade’s observations of the Bahà"ìs in 'Akkà concluding with
> the words “both the good conduct of the community and the chil-
> dren are indeed worth of appreciation” (Ibid.: 108) challenges the
> statement of the Turkish historian }erif Mardin that (smail Hakkı
> Efendi did not take the Bàbìs, whom he regarded as “primitive,”
> seriously; moreover, the aforementioned contacts and the possible

> Bahà"ì inﬂuence on Young Ottoman thought could question Mardin’s
> assertion that there was no such “Bàbì” inﬂuence in the time of the
Young Ottomans (Mardin 1964: 65).

Another possible link between Young Ottomans and Bahà"ìs, as
> suggested by Juan Cole, is provided through a certain Hoca Sadık
> Efendi who belonged to the ulema and was a progressive Muslim
> reformer. He was attacking the unjust conditions and oppression in
> the Empire and “preached in Istanbul [the merits of ] democracy,
> liberty, equality, brotherhood between all men, be they Christian or
> Moslem, Greek or Ottoman” (Mardin 1962: 252–53); because of his
> propaganda Sadık Efendi was exiled to 'Akkà and imprisoned in the
> fortress in 1868. Cole points out that the call by both Young Ottomans
> like Namık Kemal in London and Bahà"u"llàh for British-style par-
> liament in the Ottoman Empire converged (1868–69), and ascribes
> this to the possible interaction between Sadık Efendi and the Bahà"ìs
> and the former’s secret communication with Kemal (Cole 1997).

3. Young Turks and “Bàbis”

> In the second part of the 19th century Iran increasingly became the
> arena for European diplomats, traders, travelers and the like. Western
> ideas and activities had a profound inﬂuence on Iran, while in the
> country there were clear signs of displeasure with the declining Qàjàr
> dynasty that gave concessions and monopolies to foreigners under-
> mining Iran’s own sovereignty. The desire for change manifested
> itself in events, which led to unrest and clashes with those in charge
> of the old order. Like in other social conﬂicts where minorities
> suﬀered, the Bahà"ì community of Iran also was being aﬀected. Note
> that even in the 1890’s the Bahà"ìs were known to Westerners as
> well as to Iranians as “Bàbìs,” although the followers of Bahà"u"llàh
> had been already calling themselves ‘Bahà"ìs’ for thirty years. This
> explanation is important in that the followers of Bahà"u"llàh’s half-
> brother Mìrzà Ya˙yà Íub˙-i Azal, the Azalìs, were known as Bàbìs.
> Whereas the latter actively opposed Nàsiru"d-Dìn Shah’s government,
> the Bahà"ìs, although expressing their ideas on political issues, were
> on the whole politically inactive. They at least, were not conceiving
activities against the shah (Momen 1981: 358).

In the 1890s we come across links between certain “Bàbì mili-
tants” (Hanio<lu 1995: 57) and early Young Turks. The Iranian

> reformer Jamàlu"d-Dìn ‘al-Afghànì’ (Keddie 1972) was regarded as
> one of the leaders of the Bàbìs. One source states that Afghànì, not
> being a Sunni from Afghanistan but an Iranian Shì'ì who was a
> adherent to the Bahà"ì school, was expelled from Iran because of
> his relationship with the Bahà"ìs (Tarih ve Medeniyet 1998). It is true
> that Afghànì was in contact with the Bahà"ìs in 'Akkà until the end
> of the 1880s for utilising their ideas for expressing his own ideas.
> However, his cooperation with politically active Azalì-Bàbìs in his
> pan-islamist circle in Istanbul would appear more favourable in his
> eyes, since he saw the Bàbìs “as potentially breaking up the unity
> of the Islamic world therefore his continued contacts may well have
> been because he found the ideas emanating from this source useful
to him in formulating his own views” (Momen 1983: 48–50).

In Istanbul Afghànì had established a circle for promoting Pan-
> Islamist ideas (Keddie 1970: 380 ﬀ.). Among the members were the
> two Persian expatriates Mìrzà Àqà Khàn Kirmànì (Bayat 1974) and
> Shaykh A˙mad Rù˙ì (Keddie 1962: 284 ﬀ.). Both were Íub˙-i Azal’s
> sons-in-law and his followers, although they later distanced them-
> selves from Azalism and subsequently discarded formal religious belief.
> Yet their involvement in political propaganda in the Ottoman cap-
> ital gives the impression that they provided the Ottoman oﬃcials’
suspicion of the collaboration between Young Turks and Bàbìs.

The Qàjàr prince Abu’l-˙asan Mìrzà, ‘Shaykhu"r-Ra"ìs’, a secret
> Bahà"ì, had contacts with al-Afghànì and Mìrzà Malkum Khan (Algar
> 1973), another Persian reformer, in Istanbul. Shaykhu"r-Ra"ìs’ was
> a leading intellectual who openly advocated liberal reforms in Persia.
> During his second sojourn in Istanbul (1892–93) he was in touch
> with Persian expatriates. It is possible that through the ecumenical
> spirit in the Bahà"ì faith he was attracted to the ideology of Pan-
> Islamism and wrote in favour of Sultan Abdülhamid II who utilised
> it for his own goals. Together with the two Azalìs Shaykhu"r-Ra"ìs
> was a member of al-Afghànì’s pan-Islamist circle, and conversed with
> Ottoman politicians and published his ideas in his book Itti˙àd-i Islàm
> (“The Unity of Islam”). Again, his motives to bring together the
> Shì'ites and Sunnìs might have stemmed from the Bahà"ì principle
of the unity of religions (Cole 1998a; idem, 2001).

We come across links between Bahà"ìs and Freemasonry in connec-
> tion with Malkum Khàn, one of the most important western-educated
> and reform-minded Iranian ﬁgures of the 19th century. He promoted
> his ideas in his Masonic lodge, the faràmùshkhàna (‘house of oblivion’).

> Nàsiru"d-Dìn Shah closed it down in 1861, fearing that it could be
> centre of revolt and thus lead to the establishment of a republic in
> Iran (Algar 1969: 185; idem 1970: 276–96). The Bàbìs were part of
> his fears, and Malkum like other enemies was associated with them.
> It is worth noting that he tried to promote his goals shortly after
> the suppression of the Bàbìs, and not by chance they were suspected
> to be involved in his activities (Keddie 1966: 278). He spoke in
favour of the Bàbìs; Malkum believed that

> The root of all these sects, Babis, Shaykhìs and others, is a passion-
> ate desire for change, reform, innovation, an abiding disgust with the
> order or disorder of things as they are. It is a constant protest against
> the narrow orthodoxy of Islam combined with a revolt of the human
> conscience against the excesses of a barbarous despotism, an irresistible
> but uncertain and unorganised aspiration for a national deliverance.

(Algar 1973: 221 ﬀ., fn 80).

> Algar points out that Malkum had few reasons not to cooperate with
> the Bàbìs since he was in the same situation as they were in and
> “Malkum’s plan, like Bàbism, entailed the use of Islamic terminol-
> ogy for purposes fundamentally alien to the Islamic faith” (Algar
> 1973: 58 f.). Malkum, exiled to Baghdad in 1862, had previously
> contacts to the Bàbìs in Iran, and he asked Bahà"u"llàh in Baghdad
> for refuge which the latter declined, probably not to be involved
with his faràmùshkhàna (Balyuzi 1980: 151–52).

The Young Turks regarded Jamàlu"d-Dìn al-Afghànì as “an impor-
> tant pillar and the perfect spiritual teacher for the CUP [Committee
> of Union and Progress]” who had inﬂuenced the Young Turk move-
> ment (Hanio<lu 1995: 57; idem, 1986: 121–24; Mardin 1964: 65–66).
> Although Sultan Abdülhamid initially had invited al-Afghànì to
> Istanbul and favoured his political activities, later he was accused of
> “being a leader of the Babî society and an agitator and of having
> relations and secret correspondence with Freemasons, Armenian com-
> mittees, and Young Turks” (BOA, 2; Hanio<lu 1995: 56; idem 1986:
> 122). It is also said that al-Afghànì had organised the Bàbìs in Istanbul
> to a society of “Young Iran” and secretly send some of them to Iran
> for his propaganda, and that other “Young Iranians” helped the
> Young Turks by distributing their publications (Mardin 1964: 66;
Hanio<lu 1995: 255, fn 328).

Niyazi Berkes refutes the idea that al-Afghànì had inspired the
> Young Turk movement and the 1908 Revolution was prepared by
> his agitation. He indicates that these are “inventions of writers” to

> justify his having been in the company of the sultan and asks why
> he, on the one hand, opposed Nàsiru"d-Dìn Shah’s despotism and
> his granting the tobacco monopoly to foreigners, and on the other
> hand did not criticise Abdülhamid’s autocracy and the granting of
> monopolies and railway concessions. Moreover, Berkes notes that the
> Young Turks for the ﬁrst time organised themselves three years before
> al-Afghànì’s second visit to Istanbul, and that al-Afghànì would have
> labelled ﬁgures such as Abdullah Cevdet and Ahmed Rıza as mate-
> rialists and atheists in line with his arguments in his refutation of
> “materialists” and “naturalists” that he wrote to denounce traitors
of religion and society (Berkes 1964: 266, fn 14; 265 ﬀ.).

Historian }ükrü Hanio<lu remarks that “although the Ottoman
> authorities had repeatedly complained about the role played by the
> servants of the Persian embassy in Istanbul, they never gave any
> information indicating the religious sects and orders to which these
> servants belonged” (Hanio<lu 1995: 255, fn 334), meaning that there
> is no substantial information that those were “Bàbìs.” Some early
> Young Turks praised Mìrzà Ri∂à Kirmànì, a follower of al-Afghànì
> and assassin of Nàsiru"d-Dìn Shah (1896), whom they regarded as
> a Bàbì, for accomplishing this deed. Even though the assassination
> was condemned in their publications, they expressed their hopes
> regarding the death of Sultan Abdülhamid in the same manner.
> (brahim Temo wrote an eulogy for Kirmànì (who allegedly supplied
> him with secret Young Turk publications) titled “May Abdülhamid’s
> turn come next” (Darısı Abdülhamid"in Ba{ına) and let it be made pub-
> lic (Hanio<lu 1986: 123). The Young Turk Ahmed Rıza remarked:
> “The vengeance of the Babîs, who were oppressed forty-eight years
> ago, opened a door of rejuvenation and progress in Iran. We do
> hope that the sighs and wails of the victimized [members] of the
> CUP will not be in vain” (Hanio<lu 1995: 57; idem, 1986: 123, fn
> 240). Although Ri∂à Kirmànì was seen as a “Bàbì,” one Persian
> source (Dawlatabàdì 1983) aﬃrms that in times of political prob-
> lems, as in that period, the government would try to divert the feel-
> ings directed against it and would label opposition movements as a
> “Babî [heresy]” (Hanio<lu 1995: 255, fn 335). From its early days
> the Bàbìs were in conﬂict with the civil powers in Persia, and from
> the ﬁrst attempt upon the life of Nàsiru"d-Dìn Shah it was mistak-
> enly concluded that Bàbism was a political and anarchist or nihilist
> movement (Earl Curzon 1892 (1): 496–594). Following the assassi-
> nation, Ri∂à Kirmànì and his colleagues were not only identiﬁed as

> nihilists and socialists but also as enemies of the shah and other
> Muslim rulers (BOA, 3: 354/13). A Young Turk publication wrote
> that upon the shah’s death, the Persian government requested the
> handing over of al-Afghànì and three other “Bàbìs,” and that
> Abdülhamid was confused and complied with this, adding that he
> feared the revenge of the Bàbìs in Istanbul (BOA, 3: 352/12, 13,
23 and 28).

Given the fact that the Azalìs Kirmànì and Rù˙ì were executed
> in 1896, and that al-Afghànì died in 1897, it is unclear which Bàbìs
> were still involved in the Young Turk publication in 1899 (Hanio<lu
1995: 255, fn 334).

Amìn Arslàn, a Lebanese (Druze) member of the CUP, inter-
> viewed 'Abdu’l-Bahà" in 1891 in 'Akkà (Momen 1981: 224–25;
> Hanio<lu 1995: 56). Arslan had intended to meet Bahà"u"llàh, he
> could but “catch a glimpse of him who is the incarnation of ‘the
> Word of God’ in the eyes of the Persians.” He concludes with the
> following tribute to 'Abdu’l-Bahà": “He is a man of rare intelligence,
> and although Persian, he has a deep knowledge of our Arabic lan-
> guage, and I possess some Arabic letters from him which are mas-
> terpieces [“chefs-d’oeuvre”] in style and thought and above all in
oriental calligraphy.”

Another founding member of the CUP, (shak Sükuti, “had a deep
> interest in the Bahaî philosophy and studied its works” (Hanio<lu
1995: 56).

With reference to 'Abdu’l-Bahà"’s release from prison after the
> Young Turk coup d’état in 1908, Hanio<lu says that though Bahà"ì
> sources see this as a result of the revolution, “there is however, no
> clear evidence crediting the Young Turks for this, and amnesties
> were commonplace at the time” (Ibid.: 57). Yet there is some evi-
> dence for this in some of 'Abdu’l-Bahà"’s talks in the West ('Abdu’l-
Baha" 19822: 36):

> I too was in the prison of 'Abdu’l-Hamìd until the Committee of
> Union and Progress hoisted the standard of liberty and my fetters were
> removed. They exhibited great kindness and love toward me. I was
> made free and thereby enabled to come to this country. Were it not
> for the action of this Committee, I should not be with you here tonight.
> Therefore, you must all ask assistance and conﬁrmation in behalf of
> this Committee through which the liberty of Turkey was proclaimed.

> We can say that he was stating his appreciation for his liberation in
> 1908, and before it was clear that the military wing of the CUP

> had taken over or what that would mean. It would seem that his
> ties were to the civilian, parliamentarian wing. It would be inter-
> esting to know to whom, exactly; perhaps some of the oﬃcials posted
to Palestine were Young Turks, with whom he made contact.

Hanio<lu moreover says that “Babî groups throughout the Ottoman
> Empire were under close scrutiny by police” as late as 1908 (Hanio<lu
> 1995: 256, fn 335). Here the Bàbìs are again confused with the
> Bahà"ìs; both the Bàbìs and Bahà"ìs were labelled as “Bàbìs” by the
> Ottoman government. The document taken into consideration here
> deals with Sultan Abdülhamid II’s policy towards 'Abdu’l-Bahà". The
> ‘Bàbìs’ intend to build a hospital on Mt. Carmel in Haifa; this should
> be prevented because 'Abbàs Efendi is a “mischief-maker” (erbab-ı
> fesad "den olub) and the Bàbìs a “subversive group” (cemiyet-i fesadiyye)
(BOA, 1).

Hanio<lu sees ‘the Babî and Bahaî movements and ideologies’ as
> insigniﬁcant (quantité négligeable), despite the established contacts in the
> 1860s with Young Ottomans and the deep interest of early Young
> Turks in the Bahà"ì ideas (Hanio<lu 1995: 58).

4. Abdullah Cevdet and the Bahà"ì Faith

> In the last days of the Ottoman Empire, during the armistice period,
> Abdullah Cevdet, one of the ﬁrst four members of the Young Turk
> Osmanî (ttihad ve Terakki Cemiyeti (“Ottoman Committee of Union and
> Progress”), caused a considerable public commotion in 1922 after
> publishing an article in his journal (ctihad on the Bahà"ì faith. Just
> some month earlier, in November 1921, January/February 1922,
> three articles on the Bahà"ì faith by Emin Âli titled “An academic
> study of the Bahà"ì movement” were published in the same period-
> ical, where the author Emin Âli spoke in a very positive and emphatic
> way about the history and tenets of “Bahà"ism,” based, in his own
> words, on the voluminous writings of the Bàb, Bahà"u"llàh and
> 'Abdu’l-Bahà". The author was later identiﬁed with the Bahà"ì faith
> and the group of suspected Bahà"ìs who were put on trial in 1928
in Istanbul and Izmir (Shoghi Eﬀendi 1974: 168).

With reference to those articles, Abdullah Cevdet issued on 1 March
> 1922, in no. 144 of (ctihad, his article “Mezheb-i Bahaullah Din-i
> Ümem” (The doctrine of Bahà"u"llàh as a world religion). Soon the
> religious authorities and the Turkish press responded to it, accusing

> him attacking the Prophet Mu˙ammad and Islam. Consequently,
Cevdet was sentenced to two years prison.

Abdullah Cevdet (1869–1932), a medical doctor by profession, was
> a poet, translator, radical freethinker and an ideologist of the Young
> Turks who between 1908–18 led the Westernisation movement
> (Süssheim 1938; Mardin 1964: 221–50; Creel 1978; Hanio<lu 1981).
> After his ﬁrst education in Southeastern Turkey he joined the Military
> Medical Academy in Istanbul in 1889. The atmosphere of French
> and German scientiﬁc materialism, social Darwinism and Positivism
> of that time prevailing in this school soon inﬂuenced Cevdet, who
> came as a deeply religious student to Istanbul. (brahim Temo con-
> tributed much to this change, as he gave Cevdet several works of
> European materialists on chemistry, biology, and physiology, many
> of which Cevdet translated later into Turkish. In the eyes of the
> Ottoman administration of Sultan Abdülhamid II, whom the Young
> Turks wanted to overthrow, they were a group of atheists (Hanio<lu
1995: 17–23).

Due to his political activities Cevdet was arrested several times
> and had to leave the country. Among other places, he was in Geneva,
> Paris and Cairo, and wrote against the despotic Abdülhamid and
> his repressive regime. Cevdet published articles on political, social,
> economic and literary issues in (ctihad, which he had founded in
> 1904 in Geneva promoting his modernist thoughts to enlighten the
> Muslim masses. As a positivist, Cevdet was suspicious towards reli-
> gion and particularly towards Islam. However, he believed that Islam
> was a source from which progressive ideas could be drawn in order
> to infuse fresh blood into the Muslim veins, make them believe in
> modernisation and westernisation as Islamic concepts and later con-
> vert them to Positivism. Naturally, his unrestrained beliefs were con-
sidered at his time and later as anarchical (Hanio<lu 1995:ch. 9).

Probably in 1902 when he was in Paris, Abdullah Cevdet came
> in contact with the Bahà"ì faith (Hanio<lu 1981: 300) but perhaps
> even as early as in the 1890’s when “Bàbì” ideas were discussed
> among the Young Turk leaders, as mentioned above. In his 1922
> article Cevdet discusses the true nature of Christianity and Islam,
> which came to be perverted in the course of history and compares
them with the Bahà"ì faith. In his own words:

> Bahà"ism is a religion of compassion and love (Bahailik bir din-i mer-
> hamet ve muhabbetdir). But one could ask, which religion is a religion of
> oppression and enmity. Has not Jesus said, ‘Love ye each other’ and

> preached love and peace to the world? Has not Mu˙ammad came as
> a mercy to the peoples and said ‘Do not hate each other, do not be
> the cause of misfortune for each other and do not envy each other,
> o servants of God, be all brothers’? Again, has not our glorious Prophet
> said, ‘A Muslim is the one who guards the people from [the wicked-
> ness of] his hand and his tongue’? . . . Though this being so, it is con-
> stantly demonstrated in a sharp and shameful way that the historical
> events in Christianity and Mu˙ammadanism do not follow these divine
> principles. Their ‘ghazwas’ [military expeditions on behalf of Islam],
> their ‘St. Bartholomews’ [Massacre of Huguenots in France on 24
> August 1572] and Crusades etc. are in no wise deeds of compassion
> and peace.

> Following these explanations he refers to an incident in the time of
> Mu˙ammad, namely the killing of the Jewish QurayΩa tribe (because
> of their violation of the agreement with the Prophet concerning their
> help against his enemies). The heads of 800 men or so were cut oﬀ,
> their wives and daughters were sold as concubines and slaves, and
> one of the young girls was chosen by Mu˙ammad for himself. These,
> in Cevdet’s opinion, “cannot be seen as compatible with the true
> spirit of compassion and peace” (hiç de {îme-i merhamet ve selâmet eser-
leri de<ildir). He goes on saying,

> Every religion was founded to establish compassion and fellowship (mer-
> hamet ve uhuvvet). However, whichever religion a man is born into, no
> religion has been accepted that in its essence has been able to pro-
> cure its acceptance of him. That religion is only the religion of com-
> passion and love, preached and founded by Bahà"u"llàh and his son
> 'Abdu’l-Bahà". Bahà"u"llàh says: ‘Beware lest ye sow tares of dissen-
> sion among men or plant thorns of doubt in pure and radiant
> hearts . . . Commit not that which deﬁleth the limpid stream of love
> or destroyeth the sweet fragrance of friendship. By the righteousness
> of the Lord! Ye were created to show love one to another and not
> perversity and rancour.’ [Bahà"u"llàh 1988: 138] These truly divine
> words are indispensable in that they have to be uttered and repeated
> and allowed to penetrate the souls profoundly in every age, especially
> in this age of humanity . . . A spiritual teacher who set universal love,
> compassion and peace as a belief and who provided the necessary light
> and heat has not existed before Bahà"u"llàh . . . Bahà"ism, founded by
> Bahà"u"llàh and organised and spread abroad by 'Abdu’l-Bahà", has
> no idea, no law which is not compatible to reason, i.e. Bahà"ism is
> light-shedding heat. It is not a dark movement. This feature leads it
> to be a world-embracing and universal religion of peace and love. A
> true prophet who teaches compassion and brotherhood performs con-
> quests in the regions of the heart completely without terror and weapons
> and can, though he does not claim to be a prophet, say . . .: ‘We were

> wounded, we have conquered but our ﬁeld of battle never was coloured
by anyone’s blood’.

Never does it beﬁt the station of those who were sent as a mercy
to the people to kill but to be killed!

'Abdu’l-Bahà", who said ‘the candle gives its life: drop-by-drop it
> sheds its very essence in order to diﬀuse those tears. This shall be an
> example, a model for you’, indeed burned like a torch, and after kin-
dling thousands of torches he left to be alight in other worlds . . .

But how much heat and light can spread from this spark? In order
> to heat the world the ﬁre in Bahà"u"llàh’s soul is necessary, a spiritual
> and divine ﬁre to illuminate and heat at the same time.

> Owing to these words particularly criticising Islam and favouring the
> Bahà"ì faith, he was denounced publicly, even by the sultan. One
> newspaper described the sentence as “an eﬀective lesson for those
> attacking our religion” (Tevhid-i Efkâr 21 April 1922: 3). Yet, the
> decision to imprison Cevdet was never put into action and the trial
> continued until December 1926, during the ﬁrst years of the Turkish
> Republic, and was one of the most interesting proceedings in the
> history of the Turkish press. Thanks to this episode, the Bahà"ì faith
> was extensively discussed in Turkey. The trial was dismissed because
> of the abolition of the law regarding the punishment for attacking
> sacred matters (enbiyâya ta’n fezâhat-i lisâniyye) (Hanio<lu 1981: 300;
idem 1988: 92).

Abdullah Cevdet turned his trial into a matter of freedom of con-
> science (hürriyet-i vicdan), and beneﬁted from the public discussion
> which enabled him to promote his paciﬁst ideas: the general idea of
> the Bahà"ì faith that resembled paciﬁsm had probably attracted him
> to this “doctrine” (mezheb) and encouraged him to create a new
> “ethics” for the Turkish society (Hanio<lu 1981: 300, 338). His con-
> tacts in Europe with intellectuals, especially in Austria, resulted in
> his interest in “paciﬁsm,” “women’s rights” and “feminism.” In 1922
> Cevdet founded the “Union de Paciﬁstes” (Ehl-i Sulh Birli<i ) in Istanbul
> that would ﬁght war and promote universal peace (Hanio<lu 1976–77).
> He believed that “World peace may remain an abstract concept, a
> dream that never materializes. But for this to be so does not pre-
> vent a person from seeing world peace as an ideal, worthy, and in
> the pursuit of which lives may be sacriﬁced. There is no prospect
> that tuberculosis will ever be completely eradicated from the face of
> the earth; it will go on forever. Does this being so render vain and
> worthless the formation and activity of anti-tuberculosis societies?”
> (Creel 1978: 153).

On the basis of these beliefs, as }ükrü Hanio<lu states, “Abdullah
> Cevdet later asked the Muslims to convert to Bahaîsm, which he
> regarded as an intermediary step between Islam and Materialism,
> and the Young Turks’ eﬀorts to create a very liberal and progres-
> sive Islam reﬂected a core endeavour” (Hanio<lu 1995: 202; idem
> 1981: 338–39). For Cevdet, “Bahà"ism” was similar to early uncor-
> rupted Islam; he wanted to achieve his goal by means of the approaches
> of the Egyptian reformer Mu˙ammad 'Abduh. It seems that Cevdet
listened to a lecture of 'Abduh in Geneva (Horten 1916).

Mu˙ammad 'Abduh had met 'Abdu’l-Bahà" in Beirut and was
> impressed by him (Shoghi Eﬀendi 1944: 193). A recent study on
> 'Abdu’l-Bahà" and 'Abduh shows further evidence: “Balyuzi further
> asserts that 'Abduh met 'Abdu’l-Bahà" during the latter’s visit to
> Beirut [1879]. However, 'Abduh at this time was in Egypt, proba-
> bly living in exile in his village. There is little doubt, however, that
> the two actually met, as attested by both Arslàn and later by 'Abduh
> in a conversation with Ri∂à, who asserted that 'Abdu’l-Bahà" visited
> frequently during his sojourn in Beirut. We must assume, therefore,
> that 'Abdu’l-Bahà" visited Beirut at least a second time, between the
years 1884–1888” (McCants 2001 2001: 16; Scharbrodt 2000).

Abdullah Cevdet did not succeed with reforming society by util-
> ising Islam and the Bahà"ı faith, and seems to never have turned
> his attention to such topics (Hanio<lu 1981: 339). This is attested
> by the following comment of Cevdet in a newspaper in connection
> with the Bahà"ìs who were put on trial in October 1928 in Izmir
> and Istanbul: “Don’t involve me in such matters. I am not inter-
> ested in this! They can do whatever they want, it is none of my
business!” (Son Saat 10 October 1928: 2)

A Turkish society, in which religion was secondary, was one of
> the main features of Cevdet’s “utopia,” and his concept of “west-
> ernisation” similar to the oﬃcial ideology of the Turkish Republic
> that gave him the opportunity to promote his ideas (Ibid.: 341; Creel
> 1978).

Conclusion

> Contrary to Iranian reformers who would never have admitted the
> inﬂuence of the Bahà"i faith on their own ideas, as such an association
> being would have been regarded as heretical, Ottoman reformers

> openly and even in a positive way talked about the Bàbìs and Bahà"ìs
> who were oﬃcially regarded as agitators involved in subversive activ-
> ities. Ottoman sources from the 1910s and 1920s on the Bàbì and
