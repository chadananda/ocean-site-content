Ireland’s Multi-Ethnic Immigration Challenge: An

Irish Bahá’í View by Eamonn Moane

Abstract
Ireland’s dramatic economic success in recent years has led
to a new phenomenon in Irish life, that of immigrants from
outside the EU or USA wanting to come and live here. In
view of Ireland’s own experience of mass emigration over the
past two centuries, the country’s reaction to multi-ethnic
immigration has been disappointing. Ireland should adopt
policies that are generous, fair, and transparent. Its
approach should be based on moral principal, an
understanding of the processes at work in the world, and
recognition of the potentially enriching effects of
immigration. It is essential that there be open and honest
debate on the immigration issue, free of the one-sided
ideology of “political correctness” which some lobby groups
seek to impose on the debate of, and solutions to, the
challenge. Adopting the Bahá’í approach to consultation and
race relations would, alone, be a major contribution to
dealing with the issue.

Introduction
In the seven years from 1994 to 2000, Ireland experienced an
economic transformation unprecedented in its history. The
economy grew at 8% per annum by conservative calculations, a
cumulative growth of some 70%. The defining feature of this
economic transformation has been the phenomenal increase of
almost 50% in the numbers at work in the country. Gross
national product per person, a crude measure of economic
well-being, increased from 70% of the EU average to about
100%. Although the growth rate has slowed appreciably since
the middle of 2001, reflecting the world economic slowdown,
it is still higher than in most countries and the numbers at work
in Ireland have continued to increase.1

The vastly improved economic and employment situation
has brought about something totally new to Ireland. Firstly,
tens of thousands of diverse peoples from poor non-EU
countries have come to work here with work permits for
specific periods obtained in advance by their employers.
Secondly, and more controversially, tens of thousands more
have come here as economic migrants and asylum-seekers
without such work permits, and have applied for asylum. It is
mainly with the second group that this paper deals.

Historical Perspective
For most of the two centuries or so from the end of the
Napoleonic wars in 1815 to the early 1990s, Ireland’s
agriculturally based economy was unable to provide sufficient
jobs for its people. Involuntary mass emigration became a
permanent feature of Irish life and culture. The calamitous
Potato Famine of the 1840s and the mass emigration in its
aftermath were particularly traumatic. Several million
emigrated during the 19th century, and over 1 million
emigrated between independence in the early 1920s, and the
early 1990s, particularly in the 1950s (when 400,000 left) and
the 1980s (when 250,000 left). The population of the area now
constituting the Republic in the early 1840s was about 6.5
million, but at independence in the early 1920s, it was only
just over 3.0 million. The 1961 census showed the population
had fallen to a modern historic low of 2.8 million, although by
1991, it had recovered to some 3.5 million. By 2001, it had
reached over 3.8 million.2

In the early 1920s, the number at work in Ireland was
about 1.2 million. 70 years later in the early 1990s, it was
virtually unchanged. Yet by the end of 2001, almost 1.8
million were at work. Such a 50% increase in eight years is
almost unprecedented anywhere during normal peacetime.

This caused unemployment to fall from over 15% in the
early 1990s to less than 4% in early 2001, although it has
edged up slightly in the last year.3 It resulted in the – hopefully

permanent – ending of mass unemployment and involuntary
emigration that has been a feature of Irish society and culture
for much of the past two centuries.

Since the mid-1990s, the country has changed from one
of substantial net emigration to substantial net immigration.
The greatest component of immigrants was returning Irish
emigrants. In the past few years, tens of thousands of short-
term work permits were issued to nationals of many countries
where Irish employers showed they were not able to recruit EU
workers. In addition, in a new development, over the six years
from 1996 to 2001, some 37,000 applications for asylum and
residence were received from persons outside the EU or USA,
mainly from such countries as Nigeria, Rumania, the Congo
and Algeria.4

Up to then, Ireland’s experience of asylum applications
was limited to numbers in the hundreds – Hungarians in 1956,
Vietnamese in the 1970s, Iranian Bahá’ís in 1985, and
Bosnians in the 1990s. It granted these people refugee status
due to its obligations under the 1951 International Convention
on Refugees. This defined refugees in “political” terms, as
those fleeing persecution on grounds of race, nationality,
religion, social group or political opinion. It did not include
“economic” refugees fleeing poverty, famine, natural disaster or
war. The State has always adhered to the strict 1951 definition
of a refugee.

Of course, mass movement and migration of large
numbers of people, voluntary or involuntary, has been a
dominant feature of human history. Present-day North and
South America and Australia have been built by mass
immigration in recent centuries, but at terrible cost to their
indigenous populations. However, relative to its home
population, the sheer scale of Ireland’s emigration and
resulting population decline throughout much of the last two
centuries has been almost unprecedented in the world. This is
particularly so if one bears in mind that, since the second half
of the nineteenth century, Ireland has usually ranked

economically among the world’s rich countries, even if the
poorest of those rich. A huge Irish diaspora of tens of millions
exists, mainly in North America, Australia and England.
Except perhaps for England, the Irish abroad have been very
successful materially and have made enormous contributions to
their adopted countries.

Ireland’s Response to Multi-Ethnic Immigration
In view of this unique historical experience of emigration, and
the recent dramatic improvement in our economic fortunes, one
might expect that we in Ireland would be particularly sensitive
and compassionate to multi-ethnic, non-EU immigrants, other
than those coming on a work permit, wanting to come here.
One might assume that as a people we would openly and
unhesitatingly accept that we were faced with a grave moral
and practical dilemma, and would be openly engaging with and
debating the issue in a soul-searching manner. After all, the
37,000 applying for asylum and residence here between 1996
and 2001 amounted to one per cent of the existing population,
lower than in many other countries. As recently as the late
1980s, Irish Government ministers and officials were pleading
with the United States to relax its immigration regulations and
to legalise the situation of the tens of thousands of illegal Irish
immigrants into the States during the 1980s.

To be fair, the Irish reaction to the new immigrants has
not been ugly, let alone violent. Neither has it been, until the
introduction of “direct provision” in 2001, humiliating
financially. In fact, immigrants want to apply for asylum here
precisely because of the relatively generous social welfare and
safety net provided, and the fact that Ireland is one of the few
countries that automatically grant citizenship to all children
born here, irrespective of the circumstances. The response from
the religious leaders, sections of the media, and various
organisations, has been compassionate and generous.

However, the response from the generality of Irish people
can be described as small-minded and mean-spirited,

ambivalent and hesitant, but above all, largely devoid of moral
principal or historical perspective. This is particularly true of
the political leadership, which, of course, merely reflects
popular opinion. Any moves towards accepting immigrants and
allowing them to work here have been dictated mainly by
expediency and the labour needs of a rapidly growing
economy. In view of our own recent past, our reaction to the
immigration issue is a shameful reflection of the moral and
intellectual wasteland into which the society has been heading
in the unprecedented material prosperity of the last eight years.

Surely as a society of mass emigration for two centuries
we should regard immigration as a positive compliment
reflecting Ireland’s changed fortunes, and be pleased that it
will enrich and diversify us, as elsewhere, in the very same way
that the millions of Irish emigrants have enriched their host
countries. Instead, we appear to be fearful of even very limited
multicultural immigration as a threat to our economic well-
being and cultural identity. Indeed, could one reason for the
changing sentiment to the EU and its enlargement, as
evidenced in the rejection of the Nice referendum proposals in
June 2001, be the prospect of large numbers of East European
immigrants eventually coming here?

There are reasons for Ireland’s disappointing response to
the immigration issue. First, because of history and geography,
the Republic of Ireland since independence has been,
ethnically, religiously and culturally, an unusually
homogeneous society, unused to genuine diversity. It has been
a society of conservative thinking, and of consensus and
conformity, lacking a tradition of intellectual discourse and
mature debate. From the mid-19th century until at least the
1960s, as part of asserting our national identity, we chose as
the dominant ethos of society a dogmatic, triumphalist and
authoritarian form of Roman Catholicism which discouraged
independent thinking and initiative. In the closing decades of
the 20th century, the dominant ethos has been an equally
dogmatic, if not intolerant, politically correct secular liberalism

devoid of any true spiritual vision, which, as elsewhere, seeks
to exclude all aspects of religion, transcendence and spiritual
values from the public discourse.

Second, continuing mass emigration over the generations
had a deadening affect on the country’s social and intellectual
life and made Irish people wary of foreign people taking scarce
jobs. The resulting conservative ethos perpetuated a
conservative, somewhat ossified society where, until recent
decades, one’s possessions rather than ability determined one’s
social status.

Third, it is an unfortunate widespread phenomenon that
people who have been the underdog for much of their history,
when they cease to be so, do not show much sympathy to other
underprivileged people. Excluding the core of missionaries and
aid workers, the record of the Irish diaspora abroad, in their
attitudes to race and to underprivileged peoples, has frequently
been far from honourable.

A Broad Bahá’í Perspective
A Bahá’í approach to Ireland’s multi-ethnic immigration issue
would be based on moral and spiritual principle, and on a
global perspective. It would be based on the acceptance that
the unity and interdependence of the human race – the pivotal
social teaching of Bahá’u’lláh’s Revelation – is now being
established as the result of divinely ordained historical
processes at work in the world. These are pushing its peoples
inevitably towards world unity and a world commonwealth.
Abdu’l-Bahá stated that in this age, the unity of mankind
could, for the first time in history, be achieved, and he
envisaged that one stage of this, the unity of nations or peoples,
would be established in the 20th century:

> ... The fifth candle is the unity of nations – a unity which
> in this century will be securely established, causing all
> the peoples of the world to regard themselves as citizens
of one common fatherland.5

Shoghi Effendi wrote in 1936:

> Unification of the whole of mankind is the hall-mark of
> the stage which human society is now approaching. Unity
> of family, of tribe, of city-state, and nation have been
> successfully attempted and fully established. World unity
> is the goal to which a harassed humanity is striving. 6

It would also emphasise the concept of global citizenship, and
the common equality and dignity of all peoples, with its
implications for human rights, as exemplified in the following
Hidden Word of Bahá’u’lláh:

> O Children of Men! Know ye not why We created ye all
> from the same dust? That no one should exalt himself
> over the other. Ponder at all times in your hearts how you
> were created. Since We have created you all from one
> same substance it is incumbent on you to be even as one
> soul, to walk with the same feet, eat with the same mouth
> and dwell in the same land, that from your inmost being,
> by your deeds and actions, the signs of oneness and the
> essence of detachment may be made manifest.7

Advocating race harmony and unity, and working to
overcome racism, follow from the above. As the Bahá’í
International Community stated in 2001:

> Racism originates not in the skin but in the human mind
> ... At the root of all forms of discrimination and
> intolerance is the erroneous idea that humankind is
> somehow composed of separate and distinct races,
> peoples or castes, and that these sub-groups innately
> possess varying intellectual, moral, and/or physical
> capacities, which in turn justify different forms of
treatment. The reality is that there is only one human

race. We are a single people, inhabiting the planet earth,
> one human family bound together in a common destiny, a
> single entity created from the one same substance,
obligated to “be even as one soul.”

The reality of human oneness is fully endorsed by
> science. Anthropology, physiology, sociology and, most
> recently, genetics, in its decoding of the human genome,
> demonstrate that there is only one human species, albeit
> infinitely varied in the secondary aspects of life.8

A Bahá’í approach would also would advocate global
economic and social policies aimed at removing the underlying
causes of involuntary mass migration that have resulted in 150
million migrant workers with immediate dependants, 9 and some
22 million officially recognised refugees, 10 in the world. This
would obviously include working for world peace and for an
end to conflict, and for a minimum code of human rights to be
applied everywhere. It would also include economic policies
aimed at eliminating the extremes of wealth and poverty, and
the endemic hopeless poverty afflicting huge masses of people
globally. The mass migration in today’s world is one of the
symptoms of the wider crisis of intolerable economic inequality
and poverty destabilising the world.

A Practical Bahá’í Approach
As recommended by the Roman Catholic hierarchy in 2000,
Ireland should give an amnesty to, and regularise the situation
of, asylum-seeker immigrants already here, unless they have
committed serious offences. It should then adopt a quota-based
immigration system with open and transparent regulations and
procedures. This should accept a generous and fair number of
immigrants into the country, allow them work as their
application is considered, give them full citizenship, and
develop systematic programmes for their reception and
integration. The USA is a good example. Whatever the
numbers it accepts, the procedures for residency, work, and

eventual full citizenship, are clear and transparent, even if
rigorously enforced. The same standards and procedures apply
to all. Immigrants should then be expected to obey the law of
the land – an important Bahá’í principle. Ireland should do
these things for a number of reasons.

First, it is the right thing to do. Because of our historical
experience with emigration, we have a moral obligation, now
that we have become materially successful, to be generous to
others seeking a materially better life.

Second, humanity is moving towards a world
commonwealth and a global civilisation and culture, based on
unity in diversity, and Ireland cannot escape the implications of
this.

Third, our homogeneous insular society would benefit
from an influx of culturally diverse peoples. Here it is perhaps
worth remembering that the acceptance in 1985 of Bahá’í
refugees from the persecutions in Iran greatly enriched both the
Irish Bahá’í community and the wider Irish communities in
which they settled. Experience worldwide shows that, in the
long run, immigrants enrich the societies that accept them. The
enriching effects of human diversity are vividly depicted
by’Abdu’l-Bahá:

> Consider the flowers of a garden: though differing in kind,
> colour, form and shape, yet inasmuch as they are
> refreshed by the water of one spring, revived by the
> breath of one wind, invigorated by the rays of one sun,
> this diversity increaseth their charm, and addeth unto
> their beauty ... How unpleasing to the eye if all the
> flowers and plants, the leaves and blossoms, the fruits
> and the trees of that garden were all of the same shape
> and colour! Diversity of hues, form and shape, enricheth
> and adorneth the garden, and heighteneth the effect
> thereof. In like manner, when diverse shades of thought,
> temperament and character, are brought together under
the power and influence of one central agency, the beauty

and glory of human perfection will be revealed and made
> manifest. Naught but the celestial potency of the Word of
> God, which ruleth and transcendeth all things, is capable
> of harmonising the divergent thoughts, sentiments, ideas,
> and convictions of the children of men.11

In light of the above, we should not merely tolerate or accept
or even welcome diversity; we should celebrate it as one of the
major signs of God in the world. However, it is also clear from
the last sentence above that it is only the Word of God that
can, in the long run, provide the overarching value system
necessary to allow genuine diversity to flourish.

Finally, even on the most pragmatic grounds, immigrants
have helped, and would continue to help, the economy to
function more smoothly.

Ireland, as a rich country that was not a coloniser, still
enjoys a measure of prestige and goodwill in the international
community that is out of proportion to its real economic or
political or even military power. It should use its influence in
world affairs to advocate radical structural solutions that will
mitigate and eliminate the poverty, conflict and human rights
violations that are the root causes of involuntary mass
movement of peoples. It should advocate the concepts of
global citizenship, consciousness and identity that will bring
this about. In the meantime, until the long-term problem is
resolved, it could also propose adopting an international code
of policy and conduct on immigration whereby countries
would agree to accept generous but just quotas of immigrants
depending on their population size and economic wealth.
Indeed, such policies could be regarded as a form of
international economic aid and assistance.

Political, religious and social leaders should initiate and
foster a process of genuine consultation, discussion and debate
on the immigrant issue, devoid of ideological polemics, the pre-
set agendas of vested interest groups, and the adversarial
method of policy and decision-making. This should be based

on ascertaining the facts, identifying the principles and coming
up with a correct solution. In fact, this is arguably the most
difficult step, and is dealt with below.

There should be agreement not to stir up the immigration
issue in a sensational, scare-mongering manner for partisan
political reasons. The apparent tacit acceptance of this in the
2002 general election campaign underway in Ireland at the
time of this writing, in which immigration has been hardly
mentioned, is welcome. While less preferable than dealing with
our immigration challenge in an open, mature and principled
manner, it is certainly preferable to making it a divisive, ugly
and indeed dangerous political issue.

In immediate practical terms, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá has set forth
the Bahá’í standard in our attitude and reactions to individual
immigrants and asylum-seekers – that of loving– kindness while
giving them the benefit of any doubts or reservations we may
have:

> I ask you not to think only of yourselves. Be kind to the
> strangers, whether they come from Turkey, Japan, Persia,
> Russia, China or any other country in the world. Help to
> make them feel at home; find out where they are staying,
> ask if you may render them any service; try to make their
> lives a little happier. In this way, even if, sometimes, what
> you first suspected should be true, still go out of your
> way to be kind to them – this kindness will help them to
> become better. After all, why should foreign people be
treated as strangers?

Let those who meet you know, without your
> proclaiming the fact, that you are indeed a Bahá’í. Put
> into practice the teaching of Bahá’u’lláh, that of kindness
> to all nations. Do not be content with showing friendship
> in words alone, let your heart burn with loving kindness
> for all who may cross your path.12

Bahá’u’lláh exhorts us to see in the face of the vulnerable His
own face:

> O Son of Man! Deny not My servant should he ask
> anything from thee, for his face is My face; be then
> abashed before Me.13

From Political Correctness to True Consultation
Unfortunately, as with the Traveller issue, the “Refugee and
Asylum-Seeker” issue tends to be hijacked by vociferous
though well-meaning individuals and groups who seek to
impose a “politically correct” victim culture approach to the
problem. By labelling as “racist” those who raise certain
questions, use certain words, or suggest that immigrants (and
Travellers) also have to play their part in resolving the
problems arising, they prevent a proper discussion of the
challenge. In that sense they actually contribute to the
problem. They create an atmosphere in which the issues cannot
be frankly debated and in which people feel embarrassed and
intimidated about talking freely. This has the effect of
repressing the problem and contributing to the growth of
negative and racist sentiment directed against these vulnerable
groups. In this regard, the growing level of support in Europe
for political parties advocating such views (as in France) should
be a warning.

An example of the effects of political correctness is the
misuse of the very expressions, “refugee” and “asylum-seeker.”
Those coming here from poor countries without work permits
have little choice but to apply for asylum and refugee status.
Yet the majority of such applicants are in fact economic
migrants seeking to better their material lives, in the same way
as countless millions, including millions of Irish people, have
done in recent centuries. Therefore from the time of their
arrival and dealing with officialdom here, pretence, confusion
and ambiguity exist on both sides, which can lead only to
future problems. Truth and honesty in words, and fair and

open policies and procedures, would go a long way towards
resolving the issue. Hence the deliberate use of the word
“immigration” in the title of this paper.

Another example of political correctness is the frequent
reaction when the question of limiting the numbers of asylum-
seeking immigrants is raised. Even hinting at this very
immediate and legitimate question can be deemed “racist.” Yet
can anybody seriously and credibly advocate such
uncontrolled immigration? Certainly the Republic of Ireland,
with a population of 3.8 million and with 1.8 million people at
work, could accept something of the order of, say, 10,000
asylum seekers per annum. But 100,000, or 1 million, per
annum? Merely phrasing the question like this shows how
absurd it is to advocate unlimited immigration, and to
denounce as “racist” those who disagree.

Yet another example is the chorus of accusations of
“racism” when sensitive issues are raised, or when the law or
common sense standards are applied to immigrants or
Travellers in the same way as to the general population. In fact,
words like “racism” and “racist” are now amongst the most
used, misused and abused words in public discourse. Yet
racism is essentially the belief that certain groups of people of
different ethnic backgrounds are inherently inferior to others.
Prejudice means pre-judging, holding unjustified views about
others without informed thought. These words should not be
used to automatically label justified, well-informed concerns,
questions or opinions that one may have about others.

For example, is it “racist xenophobia” if residents express
concern when relatively large numbers of immigrants are
settled in their area? Is it “racial discrimination” to express
concern about the numbers of women arriving in Ireland in
advanced states of pregnancy to ensure that their babies born
here can obtain Irish citizenship? Is it blind “racist prejudice” if
parents, perhaps misguided, express their concern that their
children’s education might be adversely affected by the

presence of relatively large numbers of immigrants, or
Travellers, in certain classes?

Like it or not, issues such as these have to be discussed
and resolved in any society that wants to manage multi-ethnic
immigration and cultural diversity successfully. Dealing with
these sensitive and complex issues demands a high level of
moral maturity, courage, tact and sympathy. Perhaps a major
contribution that the Bahá’ís, despite their small numbers, can
make to the multi-ethnic challenge is the Bahá’í process of
genuine consultation, based on spiritual principles and the
sincere desire to find the correct solution. This involves being
frank but cordial in the consultation, regarding ideas as
belonging to the group and not to the individual who first
proposes them, and the participation of those affected by any
decisions arrived at. The Bahá’í International Community
elaborated on this process in 1994:

> The standard of truth seeking this process demands is far
> beyond the patterns of negotiation and compromise that
> tend to characterize the present-day discussion of human
> affairs. It cannot be achieved – indeed, its attainment is
> severely handicapped – by the culture that is another
> widely prevailing feature of contemporary society.
> Debate, propaganda, the adversarial method, the entire
> apparatus of partisanship that have long been such
> familiar features of collective action, are all
> fundamentally harmful to its purpose: that is, arriving at a
> consensus about the truth of a given situation and the
> wisest choice of action among the options at any given
moment.

What Bahá’u’lláh is calling for is a consultative
> process in which the individual participants strive to
> transcend their respective points of view, in order to
> function as members of a body with its own interests and
> goals. In such an atmosphere, characterised by both
candour and courtesy, ideas belong not to the individual

to whom they occur during the discussion but to the
> group as a whole, to take up, discard or revise as seems to
best serve the goal pursued ...

Viewed in such a light, consultation is the operating

> basic feature of a viable strategy of social and economic
> development. Indeed, the participation of the people on
> whose commitment and efforts the success of such a
> strategy depends becomes effective only as consultation is
> made the organising principle of every project.14

The Bahá’í writings are clear that both sides must play
their part in solving the problems arising from racial and ethnic
discrimination and prejudice. What Shoghi Effendi wrote to the
American Bahá’í community in 1938 about the challenge of
racial prejudice is apt today:

> Let neither think that the solution of so vast a problem is
> a matter that exclusively concerns the other. Let neither
> think that such a problem can either easily or immediately
> be resolved ... Let neither think that anything short of
> genuine love, extreme patience, true humility,
> consummate tact, sound initiative, mature wisdom, and
> deliberate, persistent, and prayerful effort, can succeed in
> blotting out the stain which this patent evil has left ... 15

Recent Developments
Two recent developments give further cause for concern on the
immigration issue. The first is the systematic application, in
2001, of “direct provision” for immigrants claiming to be
asylum-seekers. The new system supersedes the previous
system of social welfare payments and benefits, and rent
supplements, available for all Irish citizens. It provides the
immigrants with free full-board accommodation in hostels and
bed and breakfast places, together with very modest pocket

money for personal items, of £20 (€25.39 cent) per week for
adults and £10 (€12.70 cent) for children. This arrangement
holds when the immigrants’ application for refugee status is
being considered, and they are not allowed to work in the
meantime. Such a system is demoralising, humiliating and
distressing for the immigrants, and this appears to be its
intention. Sadly, Irish public opinion as a whole is not unduly
concerned. Imagine the reaction here if this approach was
applied to illegal Irish emigrants in the USA or any other
country!

Second, over the past year it has become clear that the
exceptional era of the Celtic Tiger economic boom has ended,
with the economic growth rate slowing down considerably
from 10% to 3–4%, and the public finances deteriorating
rapidly. Unemployment has risen marginally from 3.7% to
4\.3%, and is expected to rise further, although the numbers at
work are expected to hold up. There is little now of the kind of
talk heard in 2000 about the need for 200,000 immigrant
workers between 2000 and 2006 to meet the needs of the
economy, half of whom would not be returning Irish emigrants!
This poses the challenge of preventing an increase in anti-
immigrant sentiment.

Another issue in particular poses a further challenge to
our attitude to all non-EU immigrants. Are we to regard them
in the same way as Irish workers, or just pragmatically as a
“safety valve” for the economy, with work permits granted and
withdrawn at the dictates of the economic cycle and the forces
of economic globalisation? Are we to systematically
discriminate between those immigrants with the skills needed
by the economy, and the more vulnerable economic migrants
and asylum- seekers without such skills? There are disturbing
signs that we are opting for the purely pragmatic and
discriminatory approach. Besides being utterly cynical and
immoral, such a policy of discrimination would do irreparable
damage to Ireland’s international reputation.

Conclusion
Multi-ethnic immigration has provided a special challenge to
Ireland, and its response has been disappointing, if not
disturbing. Most worrying, perhaps, has been not so much our
response to the challenge, but the shameless lack of moral
principle and historical perspective in our attitude. Our
response, given our history, has been that of a people who are
insecure, afraid of diversity, and ruthlessly determined to hold
onto our new-found economic wealth. This is despite the
admirable record of Irish missionaries and aid workers broad,
and the notable generosity of Irish people in contributing to
international Irish aid agencies and charities.

To face this challenge, Ireland needs the moral vision and
global historical perspective to foster the correct attitude and
implement just and transparent policies. The Bahá’í view of
this issue, and the consultative approach it offers to finding a
solution, can provide the Irish people with the vision,
perspective and courage to face up to the multi-ethnic
immigration challenge in a generous, just and exemplary
manner in the years ahead.
