## Unity and Progressive Revelation: Comparing Bahá'í Principles with the Basic Concepts of Teilhard de Chardin

> **Abstract:**  
>   
> This catching up of the "thinking world" with the Bahá'í Principles will be the point of comparison of this paper, which attempts to "correlate with the Bahá'í teachings" the corresponding concepts of Teilhard de Chardin, whose books created a sensation in European intellectual circles when they were first published. This correlation will allow to compare the Faith with the "progressive movements of today" and promote the study of the "Bahá'í teachings more deeply." (Shoghi Effendi) In the following nine chapters these points of comparison will be made:  
>   
> 
> | **Bahá'í Principles** | **Teilhard's Basic Concepts** |
> | 1 Unity in diversity | Unification and differentiation |
> | 2 Independent Investigation | The phenomenon of Man in the Unity of science and religion cosmos (a purely and simply scientific treatise) |
> | 3 Progressive Revelation | "The God of Evolution," "Christ the Evolver" |
> | 4 Evil and God's providence | Evil and Evolution |
> | 5 Man's position in the universe | "Hominization" of the universe |
> | 6 Attraction and love as principle of Reality | Love and reason as principle of existence in "spirit-matter" |
> | 7 Service to an ever advancing civilization | Service in a "religion of the Earth" |

giving Christ the epithet of “cosmic” and
“universal,” he came as close as possible
to the concept of Divine Manifestation,
trying to fit Christian tradition into his
new concept of the “God of evolution.”

As pointed out above, this process has
not ended with the death of Teilhard and
the publication of his work in 1955.
Some of the New Age writers have tried
to continue in Teilhard’s view, but have
not been able to really comprehend the
message of this writer, due to their lack
of historical understanding. This was
clearly pointed out by Ken Wilber,52
who himself continued and expanded the
new view of Teilhard and others into a
impressive opus, that has been translated
into more than 20 languages and has
found followers in different lands, espe-
cially in Japan and Germany.53

Bahá’í theology is in its beginning
stages and will develop together and in
dialogue with today’s philosophy. It is
this author’s conviction that in spite of
Teilhard’s Catholic background and
Wilber’s Buddhist influence, both
authors, if understood in the Bahá’í con-
text, will contribute to the development
of a Bahá’í theology, thus promoting the
Unity of all Religions of God as pro-
claimed in the Revelation of Bahá’u’lláh.
