letters and other personaldocuments. Moreover,stable governmenthelps assure
the continuity of institutionalsupportfor various sorts of writing, bureaucratic
and religious. With patriciansdisplacedand the economy in shambles,patronage
became greatly reduced. The new rulers often proved hostile to the majority,
Shi'i culture of Iran, promoting either Sunnism (in the case of the Afghans) or
an ecumenical mixtureof Sunni and Shi'i emphases (in the case of Nader Shah).
Such rulersexpropriatedendowmentfunds for seminariesand otherTwelver Shi'i
institutions, helping impoverish clerical intellectual life and also making the
preservation of manuscripts less likely.2 Niraqi's works, however, appear to
have survived in abundance, many of them in family hands in Iran. The rich
Iraqicollections also contain manuscriptsby him.

I want to use Niraqi's work to raise and resolve three issues, all of them related
to the question of prevalent culturalcodes. First, I will look at the question of
whether scholars have oversimplified the intellectual history of late seventeenth
and eighteenthcentury Iranin depicting it as dominatedby narrowliteralistand
scripturalistmethods in religious scholarship. For in contrast to the scriptural
literalists, Niraqi's approach is firmly grounded in the Greco-Islamic
philosophical and illuminationist traditions. Second, I have argued that some
religious thought of the ulama can be seen as ideology.3 I wonder if Niraqi's
work can be analyzed so as to elucidate some of his attitudes toward various
groups in society, despite the ratherabstracttone of most passages. Finally, I
wish to make better sense of the disputes in Safavid and post-Safavid Shi'ism
over the permissibilityof certainmethodsand disciplines in elaboratingreligious
thought. Since this struggle centered on types of discourse, it seems to me
legitimate to approachit with some tools deriving from sociolinguistic theories
aboutdiscoursestrategies.

The philosophical (or even theosophical) approachto ethics, employing Greek
concepts and methods, possesses a distinguished pedigree in Twelver Shi'ism.
Avicenna, Miskawayh, Nasirual-Din Tusi and Mohsen Fayz Kashani all
produced ethical works that mixed Islamic scriptural moral concerns with
Aristotelian and Platonic schemas and illuminationist mysticism. Scholars
most often assume, however, that this rationalist-gnosticapproachto ethics died
out in the latter half of the seventeenth century, supplanted among Twelver
scholars by an emphasis on the literal quotationof oral reportsfrom the Prophet
and Imams. The flights of metaphysicalspeculation, evoking the ghosts of the
medieval Andalusian mystic Ibn Arabi and the Iranian philosopher-mystic

Avicenna, it is held, gave way to the compulsive compilation of huge
collections of oral reports.

Historiographyon eighteenth century Shi'ism in particularhas concentratedon
legal thought, seeing a hegemony of the literalist Akhbari school of
jurisprudencein the first partof the century,followed much later by a revival of
the rationalist Usuli school. This depiction partially derives from the
biographiesof two majorthinkersin the canon of eighteenthcentury writersstill
studied by Twelver ulama, Shaykh Yusof al-Bahrani (1695-1772) and Aqa
MohammadBaqerBehbahani(circa 1705-1790). Al-Bahranibecame an Akhbari,
perhapsin the 1720s, and established himself in the Iraqi shrine city of Karbala
 as a powerful religious and educational figure. His ideas had implications both
 for the interpretationof law and for wider culture, since he attackedthe study of
 philosophy, theology, and Greek logic and confined the sources of law to a
 literal reading of the Qur'anand the sayings of the Prophetand the Imams.4 In
 so doing he continued an intellectualtraditionpopularin the conservative shrine
 cities long before his arrivalin Karbala. His younger contemporary,Behbahani,
 derived from Isfahan and studied in Iraqin the 1720s, but lived in southwestern
 Iran for thirty years before coming to Karbala to stage an intellectual revolt
 against al-Bahrani in the 1760s. Behbahani promoted the rationalist Usuli
 school, which allowed limited use of syllogism in legal reasoningand recognized
 the consensus of previous jurisprudentsas a source of law. Behbahani'sUsuli
 revival in Karbala had a lasting impact, since he and his close disciples in
  Mamluk Iraq traineda whole generationof Iranianclerics who went on to gain
  high posts underthe rising Qajarsin late eighteenthand early nineteenthcentury
 Iran.t

 This sort of view, however, appears to limit the history of Twelver Shi'ism in
 the eighteenth century to events in the small Iraqishrine city of Karbala. What
 sort of religious works, one wonders, did scholars produce in Iran--in Isfahan,
 Shiraz,Mashhadand Yazd--duringthe era of al-Bahrani'sprominencein Karbala?
 Unlike specialists in literatureor theology, historians are often impatient with
 the idea of a "canon"of great authors(such as al-Bahraniand Behbahani). Even
 minor writers can, they insist, help us understand the history of mentalities.
 The standard conception of eighteenth century Shi'ism, as I hinted above, is
 challenged by the intellectual biography of Mohammad Mehdi Niraqi, among
 others. This scholar studied in middle age with both al-Bahraniand Behbahani,
 but never acquired their authority. Both Niraqi and his son Ahmad produced
 major works on ethics in the tradition of Miskawayh and Tusi, as well as
 philosophical and gnostic writings. The existence of this oeuvre, elaborated in
  Isfahan and Kashan, comes as a shock to anyone familiar with the standard

historiography on eighteenth century Iranian intellectual history, and the
concerns of the Niraqis raise important questions. Has the demise of the
philosophical high culture of early seventeenth century Isfahan been greatly
exaggerated? Can a continuity of philosophical speculation be seen from the
Safavid era, throughthe politically fragmentedeighteenth century and right into
the nineteenthcenturyand modem times?

The second issue I will raise, about Niraqi's attitudes toward social groups,
concerns the ideological aspect of his writing. I have already arguedelsewhere
that the techniques of social history can provide insight into the changing
position of the clergy in the eighteenth century.6 In studying thinkers,
however, it would be perverse to ignore their thought. We must acquire an
understandingof these writers' modes of discourse, the internal dynamics that
shaped their conclusions. The task of isolating ideological elements in clerical
discourse, suggested by such disciplines as the sociology of knowledge and the
social history of ideas, requires both a social and a semiotic analysis of the
semantic content of words describing social groups. I will suggest that the
Platonic conception of "faculties"in which philosophical ethics was grounded
provided a model for depicting social groups. Advances on the two fronts of
codes and context must be built up on the foundationof many individualstudies,
and this look at Niraqi is meant as a first step.

Finally, I would like to address the general question of the social and linguistic
meaning of conflicts over the permissible range of religious thought. There is
no denying that the late Safavid period witnessed a recurrentstruggle within
Twelver Shi'i thought, over the numberof culturalcodes upon which religious
scholars could legitimately draw in establishing a discourse about God and in
deriving legal judgments from scriptural texts. Literalists wished to restrict
religious discourse to a single code, drawnunreflectivelyfrom the Qur'anand the
oral reportsof the Prophetand the Imams. Rationalistswanted to importGreek
logical and philosophical systems, with which they could elaborate genres or
disciplines such as dialectical theology, Aristotelianethics, metaphysics,and the
principlesof jurisprudence;these codes, they thought,should coexist with and be
interwoven with the scripturalones. Mystics wished to employ, in addition,
illuminationistand Sufi codes that would allow a more ecstatic sort of discourse
about the believer's relationshipto the divine. Beyond asking if many of these
codes may not have survived among clerics in Isfahan long after the early
seventeenth century, I also wish to pose the question of how to understandthe
social conflicts involved with the struggle over permissible codes. I will argue
an analogy between speakersof a single languageand theirresentmenttowardthe
multilingual, on the one hand, and users of several culturalcodes, on the other.
Moreover, I will suggest a similarity between the School of Isfahan'smixing of
several codes (Qur'anic,Neoplatonic, Peripatetic,Illuminationist,Sufi) and the
tendency of bilinguals and multilinguals to engage in "code-switching"or the

alternationbetween two or more languages, sometimes within a single
sentence.7

The Cultural Ambience of Isfahan

Before consideringhis life and work,it is necessaryto raise some questions
aboutNiraqi'sdiscoursecommunityof 30 years--theclericalnetworksof post-
SafavidIsfahan. Whatsortof religiousambiencedid Niraqiencounterin this
city on his arrivalfrom the small town of Niraq around1730? Although
Westernscholarswithoutaccessto the manuscript    librariesof IranandIraqare
still not in a good positionto answerthis questionfully, a generalimpression
canbe achieved,evenat secondhand.Isfahanin thehighSafavidperiodconjures
up for historiansof culturethe Schoolof Isfahan,a combinationof rationalist
theology, Avicennian philosophy, scholastic Sufism, and illuminationism
exemplifiedduringthe firsthalfof theseventeenthcenturyby the workof Sadra
Shirazi,Baha'ad-Dinal-Amili, Mir Damad,and MohsenFayz Kashani. As
Newmanhas recentlydemonstrated,moreover,the membersof this cultural
movementoftenhadstrongties to theSafavidstateandarguedvigorouslyforan
expansionof the role of the Imamiclerics in standingproxy for the Hidden
Imam.8

It is often argued,however, that late Safavid Iran witnessedan increasing

influencefromthe literalist,scripturalist                             along
with a suppressionof Sufismand philosophy. Arjomandremarkedthat,"the
impact of the culture of the mandarinsof the clerical estate, i.e., the
philosophicaltradition,on the outlookof the Shi'ite hierocracydid not prove
lasting. In the subsequentgenerations,one was not to findmojtahedswho, like

that from the time of Shaykhal-IslamMohammadBaqerMajlesi(d. 1699),

partof studies at the religious colleges."10 Momen says elsewhere of the school
of Isfahan: "Afterbeing vigorously attackedby the orthodox ulama during the
course of the 18th century, it began to re-emerge in the course of the 19th
century." 11

Among the figures often mentioned as Akhbaris from the middle of the
seventeenthcenturyare MohammadTaqi Majlesi the Elder in Isfahan,al-Hurral-
Amili of Mashhad, and Molla Mohammad Taher Najafi and, surprisingly,
Mohsen Fayz Kashani in Qom.12 Since most strict Akhbarisforbade the study
of the rational sciences, including philosophy, philosophical theology, and the
principles of jurisprudence,Akhbaridominance would have taken Safavid high
culture in a new direction,away from the illuminationismand rationalismof the
earlier School of Isfahan, and toward a literalist fundamentalism. In such an
atmosphere,Momen suggests, the mammothcollection of oral reportsfrom the
Prophet and the Imams, Bihdr al-anwar, was compiled by Shaykh al-Islam
MohammadBaqerMajlesi the Youngerin the late seventeenthcentury.

Without wishing to deny the vitality of Akhbarismin some places among some
scholars, I feel it Is necessary to bring into question some of these assumptions.
First of all, this argument rests on the biographies of a very few individuals.
Second, it is surely necessary to distinguish between Qom, with its millenium-
old emphasis on the study of oral reports, and more cosmopolitan cities like
Isfahan. Moreover,one wonders how representativethe scholars named were of
local ideas. Mohammad Taher of Qom was intellectually formed in the
conservative environment of Shi'i Iraq, and al-Huff al-Amili came into Iran
alreadyan Akhbarifrom what is now southernLebanon.

Another crucial observation is that Akhbarism simply was not a monolithic
movement. The Akhbari scholar Mirza MohammadZaki Khan of nineteenth-
century Lucknow pointed out that a middle path between strict, literalist
Akhbarism and thorough-going, rationalist Usulism had been adopted by a
numberof scholars, beginning with MohammadTaqi Majlesi (d. circa 1659), a
Safavid Shaykh al-Islam and Friday prayer leader in Isfahan.13 A similar
conclusion has been reached recently by Etan Kohlberg.14 Akhbari scholars
could be divided into liberals, like Molla Mohsen Fayz, and conservatives such

Isfahancannotbe shownto be dominatedby conservativeliteralistsin the late
Safavidperiod. Mohammad     TaqiMajlesitheEldercan only in a very marginal
sensebe consideredan Akhbari,andhe certainlywas not a conservativeone.15
He gaineda reputation as thefollowerof theliteralistAkhbariMohammad  Amin
Astarabadi largelybecauseof a casualremarkin a bookwrittenin 1655not long
before his death, showing appreciationfor the work of Astarabadi. It is
worthwhilequotingthe passageat length. Majlesithe Elderexplainsthatthe
Imamspracticedpiousdissimulation,so thatoralreportstransmitted   fromthem
cannotalways be takenat face value. Theirclose companionsknew which
reportsreflecteddissimulationandwhichweretrue,butbecauseof persecution
this knowledgewas lost by later generations,as were many books of oral
reports. In the end, only a few such books survived,largelycontainingoral
reportstransmittedby only one believer in each early generation(it was
 preferablethata reportbe shownto have been transmittedby morethanone
 source,so reinforcingthe likelihoodof its accuracy). Hereticalschoolsarose
 among the Twelvers, and the ability to distinguish among oral reports
 disappeared.He continues,

     Disputesaroseamongthe Shi'is, andeach practicedaccordingto his
     own conclusions (yaft) from the Qur'anand hadith,and followers
     emulatedthem. Then about thirtyyears ago the great and erudite
     scholarMohammad   AminAstarabadi beganstudyingandcomparingthe
     oral reports from the sinless Imams, and denouncingthe use of
     individualopinionandanalogy. He knewthe pathof the companions
     of the sinless Imams, writing the Favd'id-i madaniyyehand sending it
     to this land. Mostof the peopleof Najafandthe exaltedshrinecities
     thoughtwell of his approach,andtheyhadrecourseto theoralreports.
     The truth is, most of what Mawlana MohammadAmin said is
     correct. 16

 Akhbariapologists always excerptedjust this much from the book when
 claimingMajlesithe Elderas one of theirown. But let us quotethe restof the
 passage,whichgivesa muchdifferentfinalimpression:

 Said Amir Arjomand, "Religious Extremism (Ghuluww), Sufism and Sunnism in

 'Ilmi, 1963), pp. 37-38.
14 Cole


    In sum, my own approachis a middle course between extremes, and I
    have demonstratedthis approachgraduallyin my Rawdat al-muttaqrn,
    and, God willing, I will also recall it to mind in the course of this
    commentary. Its essence is that it is permissibleto act according to the
    conclusions reached by someone who knows the favored path of the
    People of the House throughassiduous study of their sayings, and who
    can reconcile these, and who is upright--orrather, has given up this
    world. Indeed, it is incumbent that the layperson act according to the
    conclusions of such a one. For under these circumstances, they have
    not merely acted accordingto his words, but have acted accordingto the
    words of God, his Messenger,and the sinless Imams.17

Majlesi the Elder, in short, finally reached the conclusion that laypersons must
emulate a knowledgeable cleric, a position held by Usulis as well as by liberal
Akhbaris such as Molla Mohsen Fayz. Conservative Akhbaris such as
Astarabadi,it must be emphasized, rejected the requirementof such emulation,
saying that all Twelvers should emulate the Imams. Majlesi the Elder was also
clearly committedto a rationalscience of oral reportsinvolving the weighting of
some against others, anotherprocedurerejectedby strict Akhbaris. Mohammad
Taqi Majlesi emphasizes that he follows a "middleway," suggesting no strong
allegiance to either the Usuli or Akhbarischools.

Moreover, both Majlesi the Elder and his son Mohammad Baqer wrote on
rationalistsubjects like dialectical theology, and so cannot be categorized with
strict Akhbaris such as al-Hurral-Amili who forbade such subjects. The same
holds, of course, in regardto Molla Mohsen Fayz, who, whatever his approach
to legal interpretation,was no scripturalliteralist in any other area of culture.
Mohammad Baqer Majlesi, it is true, denounced the school of Isfahan and
persecuted both Sufi brotherhoodsand intellectuals who took their inspiration
from Sufi gnosis ('irfan). But despite his prominence and power, Majlesi the
Younger hardly controlled religious culture in Isfahan It seems unlikely that
such witch-huntingcontinuedafter his deathin 1699.

Not all clerical Shi'i writers have agreed with the generalizations about
universally increasing Akhbaridominance in the late seventeenth and much of
the eighteenth century. An Arab Imami, Yusuf MuhammadAmr, has argued
that although an Akhbari movement dominated Karbala in this period, Najaf
partiallyescaped Akhbariinfluence, and Isfahanremainedalmost untouchedby
it, a majorityof scholars there steadfastly adhering to Usulism. Henry Corbin
has also discussed rationalistthinkersof the early eighteenth century in Isfahan
and elsewhere in Iran, such as Fazel-e Hindi, an Avicennian who was killed in
Isfahan in 1722; Molla Na'ima Taleqani (d. after 1739), a theosopher who

survivedthe siege of Isfahanbut thenemigratedto Qom;and the philosopher
MollaAbdar-Rahman    Damavandi  (d. circa1737).18

A sense of the breadthand sophisticationwith which scholarspursuedthe
rationalsciences, includingthe Usuli principlesof jurisprudence,In the last
decadesof Shah Sultan-Hoseyn's    Isfahancan also be gainedfrom the list of
worksthatMohammad      Ali HazinGilani(circa1691-1767)wrote.19Gilaniwas
no outsiderto the clerical and royal establishment,but a prominentyoung
memberof Isfahanisocietywith stronglinksto the shah'scourtby the time he
was in his twenties. An advocateof the Usuli school of jurisprudence,he
defendedtheprincipleof ijtih&i, or thederivationof Islamiclaw throughthe use
of appliedreason. He did, however,criticizetoo extensivea use of analogyin
law (mostUsulis forbadeit whereit was not mandatedby the scripturaltext).
He also wroteon commonplacesubjectssuchas rituallaw andoralreports.But
beyondsuchconcerns,expectedof a Twelvercleric,he commentedon medieval
worksby thephilosopherAvicennaandthe illuminationist    Suhravardi,defended
the Sufi mystic Ibn Arabi to his detractorsin Karbala,and wrote on the
concordanceof philosophywith the Islamicrevelation. He had thingsto say
aboutgeometryand Aristotelianphysics(as hadhis father,AbuTalebGilani),
 andaboutal-Kindi'sworkon psychologyin the Greektradition.He appearsto
 haverecognizedthedifferencesbetweenNeoplatonismandtheperipatetics,      and
 attemptedto reconcilethem. He wrote a book of advice to the shah in the
 "Mirror for Princes"vein. Nor was Hazin'svasteruditionlimitedto Islamand
 theGreco-Islamic philosophicaltradition.He describedZoroastrian ideason the
 beginningof theworld,discussedpropheciesof Mohammad      in theHebrewBible
 andtheNew Testament,andrefutedtheChristiannotionof personsin God. He

The Life and Worksof Niraqi

Niraqi, on aniving in Isfahanaround 1730, began studying with scholars whose
interests sound remarkablylike those of Hazin. Niraqi's favorite teacher, the
masterof philosophy and rationalisttheology Esma'il Khaju'i,lived throughthe
Afghan siege of Isfahan In 1722. Unlike many Isfahani ulama who fled the
capital for the shrine cities of Iraqor for the bejewelled courts of India, Khaju'i
remainedin a devastatedIsfahanuntil his death in circa 1759. Niraqiappearsto
have remained there with him, as well. Among his other teachers were Shaykh
Mohammad Mehdi Harandi and Shaykh Mohammad, son of the Avicennian
physician Hakim MohammadZaman. Both were masters of the philosophical
sciences (hikmah), and Niraqi's son singled them out along with Khaju'ias the
most importantof his Isfahan-erateachers.20

Unfortunately,I have been unable to ascertainin what seminariesNiraqi studied
or taught, or anything about his institutional connections. The city's
institutionscertainly were disruptedin the eighteenth century. Isfahanprobably
declined from a population of 250,000 or so in 1720 to only 20,000 in the
aftermath of the Afghan siege and conquest of 1722.21 But, as I have noted
elsewhere, a certainamountof continuitycan neverthelessbe perceived from the
Safavid period, and Isfahanis often made their peace with the short-lived
conquerorswho succeeded one anotherso rapidly,so that their city's population
gradually grew to some 50,000 by the end of the century. A branch of the
Majlesi family continued to provide contenders for the post of Friday prayer
leader, for instance. And one cannot assume that all the wealth of the landed
clerics was usurped. Nader Shah himself made some use of prominentIsfahani
clerics, appointing Mohammad Baqer Hezarjaribi (d. 1790) to an official
judgeship, and the emperor was said to have shown great respect to Kha2u'i
himself. One suspects thatpatronageformedone element of such "respect."22

Seminaries, then, continued to exist, though perhaps reduced in number and
student and faculty population by ninety percent, like everything else in the
former capital. The ten percent were able, nevertheless, to carry on a fairly
lively intellectual life. Religious studies went on, and Isfahani relaters of oral
reports from the Prophet and the Imams bore special prestige in that many of
them could trace their transmissionof these reportsthroughthe widely respected
Mohammad Baqer Majlesi. On the other hand, despite the assertions of
Arjomand and Momen quoted above, scholars continued to cultivate the old

One of Khaju'i'sstudents,Molla Mehrab,was notoriousfor his belief in the
Sufi doctrineof the oneness of being, consideredhereticalby manylegalist
clergy,andhe hadto hide his identitywhenhe visitedthe conservativeshrine
cities.23

A modembiographer    hasreferredto Niraqias a "self-mademan"('e$jmO),which
appearsto meanthathe wasa first-generation  clericratherthanderivingfroman
old familyof divines.24His father,AbuDharr,servedas a minorfunctionary   of
the Safavidstatein theKashandistrictof west-central  Iran,whereinwas located
the family's ancestralhome, the village of Niraq. We do not know when
MohammadMehdiNiraqiwas bornintothis familyof lower-levelbureaucrats,
but he probablycame to Isfahanto study in 1730 or so, and was then, most
likely,aroundfifteenyearsold. He formeda life-longaffectionfor his teacher
Esma'il Khaju'i,with whom he associatedfor thirtyyears. Khaju'idevoted
much of his teachingeffort to theosophicaland philosophicalworks in the
traditionof the School of Isfahan. Niraqi'sstint studyingreligion was not

or merchantswent to seminaryfor a few yearsbeforereturningto a secular
occupation.Occasionally,as in Niraqi'scase, the avocationof religiousstudy
becamea vocation.

Duringthe perioda young man spentporingover Qur'ancommentariesand
works of Islamic law he often lived in penury, even if from a wealthy
background. The family expectedthe boy to subsist on the small stipends

particularlywhen he came into the donor'sshop.26 The anecdotes about young
Niraqi, preserved in family manuscripts, emphasize the contradictions in the
apprenticeship of a divine, the humiliations he must bear even while
approaching the exalted sacred texts, and Niraqi's own choice of private
humiliationover the acceptanceof charityfrom strangers.

Since one cannot imagine a good economic or social reason for this enforced
immiseration of sons of the intermediate strata upon their enrollment in
seminary, we might furtherconsider culturalcauses. Structuralanthropologists
argue that where humans believe in a divine other world distinct from the
material world around them, they posit intermediariesbetween the two. They
depict these intermediariesas having attributesof both dimensions, so that they
can act as bridges.27 These figures, whether prophets bothered by visions, or
bleeding god-men, or monstrous mixtures of animal and human, stand at the
intersection of two realities. The Twelver Shi'i clergy, in the absence of the
hidden Imam, also functioned to some extent as intermediaries between the
invisible and the visible world. By making crushing poverty part of their
initiation into the world of religious learning, they emphasized their other-
worldliness. This special appreciation of heroic poverty in youth had the
undoubtedbenefit of not requiringa punishingly ascetic style of life in middle
age.

Niraqi, then, left the impressionon contemporariesof a serious-mindedstudent,
an ascetic, willing to cut himself off from the comfortable world of the
intermediatestratafor the sake of spirituallearning. A final anecdote underscores
these attributes. While he was in Isfahan, his father, Abu Dharr,was killed in
Kashan. His brotherswrote him, informinghim of the death, and requestinghis
returnhome so thatthe inheritancecould be divided up. Niraqi, however, had, in
keeping with his ascetic bent and desire to be cut off from the mundane,begun
refusing to read his mail. He deposited all letters, unopened,underhis bed. The
same fate befell a second entreatyfrom his brothers. Finally, in exasperationthe
brothers wrote to Esma'il Khaju'i, asking him to contact their unresponsive
sibling for them. Khaju'i, fearful of delivering a shock to his student, told
Niraqithathis fatherwas woundedand he hadbest hurryhome. Niraqirefusedto
take the hint, however, saying that he would neverthelessperseverein his studies
in Isfahan. Khaju'ihad no choice but to tell his stubbornpupil the whole truth
about Abu Dharr'sdemise. Niraqi continued to Insist on remaining in Isfahan.
In the end, Khaju'iorderedNiraqi home to take care of his obligations. Niraqi
obeyed, but hurriedto Kashan,had the estate divided up, and set out on the back-
breakingreturntripto Isfahanthe very next day after his arrival.28

Again, the anecdote informs us of Niraqi's asceticism, his isolation from the
practicalworld. Yet perhapsit tells us more than was intended. Niraqi'srefusal

to go to what he thought was his father'ssickbed seems to indicate that he lost
little love on the old man, nor does he appearto have squanderedmuch affection
on his brothers. The change of family profession from bureaucratto cleric, and
of dwelling place from Kashan to Isfahan, would make even more sense if we
conclude thatNiraqi did not get along with his family. Of course, his disinterest
in being presentfor the division of the estate does also indicatea genuine ascetic
disregardfor worldlygoods.

Niraqi lived in Isfahan, teaching, researching and writing, for thirty years,
keeping a close association with his mentor,Esma'il Khaju'i. It appearsthat he
stayed with Khaju'i until his teacher'sdeath in 1759, living through the savage
repression by Nader Shah of the revolt of 1744, the fluctuatinguncertaintiesof
political rivalry after the emperor's assassination in 1747, and both of Karim
Khan Zand'sconquests of the city in the early 1750s. Around 1759 Niraqi went
to Karbala, where he studied oral reports with the Akhbari revivalist Shaykh
Yusof al-Bahrani. He was by then middle aged and an accomplished author in
his own right, of course. Many ulama enjoyed studying the transmitted
sciences, such as oral reports, with their peers, since that often gave them an
additional expertise and enlarged or reinforced the chain of transmission that
linked them to the Prophet and the Imams. On Aqa Mohammad Baqer
Behbahani'sarrival in Karbalain the early 1760s, Niraqi switched to studying
with him. As an Isfahani rationalist,he would have found the Usuli Behbahani
a more congenial teacher.

MohammadMehdi Niraqi then returnedto his homeland, settling in Kashanfor
the last twenty-five years of his life. Karim Khan Zand had by now firmly
integrated this city of 20,000 into his stable, increasingly prosperous state. In
this center for the productionof silk stuffs and carpets, Niraqi wrote a book in
1766 in Persian on commercial law for lay merchants,and in 1772 he wrote a
work on the principles of jurisprudenceentitled Anis al-mojtahedin. In Kashan
he founded a center for religious study that survived him, and raised a son,
Ahmad, who would become a prominent Kashani mojtahed or jurisprudentin
his own right. In 1793, Niraqi visited Najaf with his son Ahmad, dying there
the following year and being buried in Imam Ali's shrine city. His son stayed
on to study with the Usuli greats.29

 Let us consider Niraqi's 32 books.30 He wrote seven on basic questions in
 Islamic law or fiqh, including matters of ritual purity, pilgrimage, prayer and
 commercial intercourse. He authoredfive works on principles of religion and
 principles of jurisprudence, approaching both in a rationalist manner and
 defending ijtihad and consensus in the interpretationof law. But his greatest
 output lay in the area of the philosophical sciences and metaphysics. He
 addressed issues in being (wujud) and quiddity (mThiyyah), produced a

commentary on Avicenna's metaphysical opus, ash-Shifa', discussed the
theosophy of illumination in his al-Lam'at al-'arshiyyah, wrote on natural
sciences, composed two works on cosmology and cosmography,and authoreda
huge three-volume work on philosophical ethics, as well as writing on Greek
geometry and on mathematics. He also contributedto the fields of imamology
and elegy for the imams, collected his sermons into a manuscript,and wrote on
rhetoric. In short, this Twelver contemporary of Shaykh Yusof al-Bahrani
sounds more like an Intellectualheir of Molla Sadraor Hazin Gilani thanof Ibn
Babuyehand Mohamnmad     Amin Astarabadi.Nor does Niraqiappearto have been

Niraqi's"Compendium
                  of Happiness"

I will now attemptto use Niraqi's work on ethics to examine how he employed
diverse culturalcodes to create a religious vision of the moral life. I will also be
interested in how Niraqi related even a highly abstract ethical system to his
society. Niraqi'sattitudestoward monarchs,other clerics, Sufi mystics, and the
wealthy tell us much about his values. My use of this book for the purpose of
eliciting the attitudesof a particularera, it might seem, could be faulted. It can
be objected that Niraqi'swork is not particularlyoriginal, that he based it largely
on Molla Mohsen Fayz Kashani'sreworkingof al-Ghazali'sIhya' 'ulam ad-din
(The Revival of the Religious Sciences) and other sources. I would meet this
importantobjection in several ways. First, the Idea that a work should transmit
previous authorities rather than initiating an original argument is common to
pre-printmanuscriptcultureall over the world. Often, an authormade a personal
statement in what he chose to transmitand what he omitted. Moreover, few
authors resisted the temptationto embellish, as well as to edit, the tradition,so
that original thoughts often lie buried in works that are otherwise largely
derivative. Second, literary theorists have stressed that even modern novelists
largely rearrangeand weave togetherliterarycodes alreadyelaboratedwithin their
culture. All literature, they argue, consists of a scissors-and-paste job, the
selective quotation of or reference to previous texts and conventions known to
the audience, which they call "intertextuality."The contributionof most authors
lies not in developing a new code or system, but in manipulating codes and
genres alreadyfamiliarto the audience.31 Of course, the use of unacknowledged
and extensive quotation typical of medieval works constituted a ratherheavy-
handed approach to the manipulation of conventions. But the idea of the
continuing operation of intertextualityin modern writing suggests that Niraqi's
own extensive quotation of and reference to other sources need not render his
writing without interest or suggest he was engaged in a wholly different
enterprise than twentieth century writers on ethics. Finally, that the

    Ideology, Ethics and Philosophical Discourse in Eighteenth Century Iran 21

intertextualityof Niraqi and his audience included ethics in the Ghazallan and
philosophical modes is in itself an interestingdatum.

The conventions of writingon ethics and polite culture(adab) demandedthat the
authorbegin with a statement of purpose. Niraqi, in his, says that since moral
advice was scatteredamong many books, which were often inaccessible, he felt it
necessary to assemble such advice in one place so that it might be more easily
available to all. He continues, "I have thereforegathered together in this book
the essence of that which was revealed in the true Revelation, along with the
cream of that which the mystics (ahl al-'irfdn) and philosophersexpounded, In a
mannersuch that the eyes of seekers are attracted."32The book begins with an
announcement of deliberate cultural code-switching, an art cultivated by
practitionersof polite letters on the grounds that quotationsfrom diverse genres
were less likely to pall than uninterruptedexpository prose. Literalistadvocates
of a scripturalmonocode might find blasphemy in the juxtaposition of Qur'an
verses and sayings of the Imams with ethical maxims drawn from Plato,
Aristotle, Avicenna and Miskawayh,but rationalistssuch as Niraqi delighted in
 such diverse intertextuality,and thoughttheir audiencewould, as well.

The solidly philosophical and theosophical basis of Niraqi's ethical system is
demonstratedby his adherenceto the doctrineof moraland intellectualperfection
throughthe cognition of the realities of things. In the traditionof Avicenna and
Miskawayh, the cultivation of the philosophical sciences was necessary, along
with the curbing of extreme emotions and vices, for moral perfection. Niraqi
explains that when the seeker loses his desire for materialthings altogetherhe is
filled with divine knowledge (al-ma'arif al-ilahiyyah), as well as by ecstatic
feelings of divine bliss. At this point the realities (haqdi'q) of things take root
in the believer's intellect. "Whenhe has reached this goal, he is ready to attain
the highest stage, the vicinity of the host on high, which is ineffable." (Jami',
 1:68). Medieval Muslim authors, such as Miskawayh, identified this highest
stage of human beings' moral evolution as the first angelic plane, and they
referredto those few who attainedit as divinized (muta'allihun).3 Niraqi keeps
 the general schema of the philosophers, wherein the cognition of universals
plays a part in the salvation of the soul, leading the believer close to the divine.

 Niraqi'sbeliefs about the power of Islamic and theosophical teachings to change
 characterlead him to come down on the "nurture"side in the controversy over
 whether character is inherent or learned. He admits that some aspects of
 character, particularlythe theoretical faculties, cannot be easily changed, and
 archly comments that quickness of mind cannot be altered,as is proven by some
 students. Because the study of ethics aims at improving character,upon which
 true life for human beings depends, Niraqi argues that this branchof knowledge
 is the most noble and the most beneficial of all. (Jami', 1:53-59).

 70, 169.
22 Cole


Niraqi organized his work in an original fashion, treating each vice or virtue
according to the human faculty that generated it. He recognized the three
Platonic faculties of the soul, as well as a fourth. These included the angelic
intellective faculty, the leonine irascible faculty, the beastly appetitive faculty,
and the demonic faculty of cunning. Despite some pejorativeadjectives, Niraqi
recognizedthateach facultyproducedvirtueswhen controlledand mademoderate,
and vices when allowed to go to extremes. The dynamics of his ethical
psychology do not, then, differ from the Greek tradition. He noted that the
purpose of ethics is not to abolish any of these faculties, but to keep them to the
mean, avoiding excess. The destruction of the irascible faculty, for instance,
would have the unfortunate effect of making holy war or jihad against the
infidels impossible. (Jami', 1:58, 61.)

Niraqi'sapproachto ethics standswithin the philosophicaltraditionof Avicenna,
Miskawayh,Tusi, Molla Mohsen Fayz and otherTwelver thinkerswho switched
scripturaland Greek philosophical codes. He accepts Greek ideas about the
psychology of vice and virtue and about the definition of virtue as a mean. He
propoundsthe "scientificmysticism"of the Avicennian tradition,which sees the
cognition of universalsas a way of perfecting the soul. He cultivated the study
of metaphysics and the naturalsciences, which aids in this cognitive ability, not
only for secular,but also for theosophicalpurposes.

Pride and Social Groups

Obviously, a short study such as the present one cannot aspire to analyze the
whole of Niraqi'smassive three-volumeopus on ethics. But in keeping with my
concernsboth with the social historyof ideas and with the elaborationof cultural
codes, I will focus on the way in which he relates ethics to contemporarysocial
groups and the place he gives to the study of ethics as a cultural code. Of
course, many of his discussions of particularvices and virtues have an abstract
purposein identifying from which of the faculties they derive and how they arise
from shifts on the spectrum of moderate to extreme. But he treats some vices
more concretely, talking of the manner in which specific occupational groups
fall liable to them. The best example here is pride or conceit (ghuruir). Here he
follows in a general way the discussion of this issue by the seventeenth-century
Akhbari, Molla Mohsen Fayz Kashani, in his reworking of al-Ghazali's Ihya'
entitled al-Mahajjahal-bayd`'; but Niraqi'sorganizationof the materialand his
emphasesare often quitedifferent.34

The definition of such pride, or, literally, self-deception, is to think one is doing
the right thing when one is really giving in to passions. This surrenderto the
lower impulses occurs because of two ethical errors. First, the soul believes that
it is doing good, when it is not. Second, the soul gives in to its love of things
pleasing to the appetitive and irascible faculties, such as high position, in the

34 Mohammad Mohsen Fayz Kashani, al-Mahajjah al-baydd' fi taMdhibal-ihya', 8
vols. (Beirut: Mu'assasah al-A'iami li'l-Matbu'at, 1983), vol. 6, pp. 291-357.
    Ideology, Ethics and Philosophical Discourse in Eighteenth Century Iran 23

mistaken belief that they will result in an eternal reward. The first error is a
disorderof the intellective faculty, deriving from a misperceptionof evil as good.
The second is a disorder of the appetitive and irascible faculties, in which they
are allowed to go to extremes ratherthanbeing curbed. The opposite of pride is
knowledge and self-denial (zuhd). (Jami', 3:3-4, 31).

Niraqi specifies seven groups of people who are especially prone to the sin of
pride. The first consists of unbelievers or non-Muslims. Non-Muslims who
attain great wealth often make the argument,he says, that their wealth Is a sign
of God's love for and pleasure with them. Niraqi energetically disputes this
quasi-Calvinist doctrine. Rather, he argues, a vast accumulation of material
goods signals abasement, since God protects his loved ones from the things of
this world-just as a kind father forbids a sick child rich and tasty foods. The
cure for this sort of pride, he concludes, is the realization that success in this
world is a sign of abasement,whereas detachmentfrom materialthings can help
one receive divine grace and draw nearto God. (Jami', 3:9-10.)

Even if Niraqi here is transmitting received ethical tradition rather than
originating a new argument, his inclusion of this passage indicates that it
possibly held special relevance for his own, contemporarysociety. He lived at a
time, certainly, in which thousands of old, established Twelver families in the
Isfahandistrictwere displacedand reducedto penury. Althoughthe Armeniansof
Julfaand other mercantilenon-Muslimgroupsalso sufferedduringthe eighteenth
century, the general downward mobility of Twelver families may have
highlighted the existence among the Christians of at least some very wealthy
individuals. Armenian merchants, after all, had a mercantile network that
stretched from Isfahan into the OttomanEmpire and Europe, on the one hand,
and into Bengal and points east, on the other. Niraqi perceived non-Muslims'
persistence in unbelief as an example of overweening pride, and their ability to
point to worldly success at a time of economic hardshipfor most Iraniansonly
compounded their haughtiness. His repetitionof this old argumentis, perhaps,
 an attempt to justify the pious poverty into which so many Twelvers had fallen
 as a true sign of God's grace, and to stigmatize wealthy Christianmerchantsas
 having been forsaken by the Deity to disport themselves as they pleased. The
 ascetic, world-denying thrustof his comments suggests a Platonic code, but, as
 we shall see, Niraqi'sdiscourse is more complex than that.

 The second contingent of the prideful is supplied by corruptbelievers. These
 hold that merely because of their faith God will forgive their misdeeds. Some
 may also have too much pride in their high station, for instance the Sayyeds or
 descendants of the Prophet who do not live up to their lineage. Niraqi insists
 that God loves the obedient and hates the rebellious, without regardto ancestry.
 Attempting to live on one's ancestor's righteousness, he remarks, is like trying
 to live on the food they ate. (Jami', 3:11-12.) Here, again, a dimension of
 social conflict appearsto underliethis attributionof the vice of pride to Sayyeds
 in particular.Said Arjomandhas demonstratedthatthe mojtahedsof Safavid Iran
 had had to struggle against the charismaticSayyeds for leadershipand control of
24   Cole

religious resources.35 Niraqi, like Behbahaniand several other majormojtaheds
of the eighteenthcentury,made no claim to Sayyed status (as is witnessed in the
preferencefor such titles as "Aqa"and "Molla,"as opposed to "Mir").Niraqi, as
a first-generation cleric from a family of provincial Iranianbureaucrats,was
clearly at a disadvantage within Isfahan's religious establishment in his
competition with clerics from old ulama families of Sayyed background. The
inclusion of this passage, echoing the traditions of the prophet about the
criterion for prominence in Islam being piety ratherthan lineage, bolstered his
own position.

The thirdgroup prone to pride is the religious scholars or people of knowledge.
Niraqi follows Molla Mohsen Fayz in saying that one of their more common
prideful practices is deliberately to restrict their range of knowledge for some
worldly purpose. For instance, some study the rational sciences such as
theology, but eschew philosophy, concentratinginstead on dialectical debating
techniques so that they can show off their sparringability in gatherings. Some
make the mistake of specializing in narrowpreliminaries,such as grammaror
logic or poetry, asserting haughtily that knowledge of the divine Law or
philosophy depends on these skills. They remain unaware,Niraqi complains,
that one should devote oneself only sparingly and as required to the means,
focusing instead on the goal. Then there are the lawyers within the ulama, who
restrictthemselves to the art of commercialtransactionsin law and the judgment
of court cases between litigants, exerting themselves only in handing down
decisions. They neglect dogmatics and ethics, and perhapseven other issues in
law such as ritual worship, and ignore their own hearts'need to acquire virtues.
Some ulama very nearly achieve the roundednessnecessary to virtue, but fail at
the last moment. Some, for instance, master all the branches of the Islamic
revelation except metaphysics (al-'ilm aI-ilhhi) and ethics, failing to preserve
themselves from sin both internallyand externally. Some go furtherand master
all the sciences, both rationaland revelational,and outwardlyobey the law, but
inwardlyneglect the attributesof the heart. Within these ulama,Niraqi laments,
traces of the satanicremainabout which they remainunaware. (Jami', 3:15.)

Niraqi's discussion of the foibles of the ulama is not very original, but it is
worth briefly reviewing for what it tells us about the criticisms he thought
worth preserving. Unlike Molla Mohsen Fayz, Niraqi discusses the faults of
ulama under the heading of haughtiness or ghurar. Aside from pridefully
restricting the range of their religious culture, ulama fall into haughtiness in
some other ways. Some prideful ulama secretly desire to become close to rulers
and nobles, though outwardly they avoid doing so, because being seen as
sycophants would detract from their station in the eyes of the common people.
Hypocritically,despite the yearningsin theirhearts,they then consider theirown
avoidance of the mighty to be the essence of piety. Prayerleadersoften fall into
pride. They think of themselves as those who spreadand exalt the divine Word.
But if someone enters the mosque who is more learnedand pious thanthey, they
are furious. They allow a sordid admixture of love for high position and

 to acceptpatronagefromsuchtaintedsources. The verytemptationto become
 close to kings constitutesa majorsourceof clericalhypocrisy. The powerful
26 Cole

Sayyeds, a caste of hereditaryprominencein Muslim societies, does not escape
his criticism for their assumptionthat piety can be had throughlineage. Niraqi's
ethics therefore have a built-in sociological bias against the values of the
wealthy and powerful, for whom wealth and power are inherentlygood and signs
of God's favor. Niraqi, as a middling sort of person, appearsto be loading the
dice againstthose who consideredthemselveshis social betters.

Niraqi proves critical, moreover,of his peers In the religious professions as weli,
painting them as driven by petty jealousies and a desire for popularacclaim. He
thinks very nearly all leaders of prayers afflicted by such vices, and discovers
them in sermonizersas well. He also finds many of his colleagues insufferably
narrow in their religious culture, yet convinced that they have mastered the
essentials. He denigrates the self-proclaimed mystics, whether wandering
mendicants or Sufi pirs who assert their own divinity and access to revelation.
Even the worshipperswho follow men of religion often fall victim to pride and
hypocrisy.

Yet the portraitof Niraqi that emerges from these passages, as hostile to the
wealthy and powerful(as well as to wealth andpower), hypercriticalof the ulama
establishment,and anti-Sufi is something of a caricature. It must be tempered
with many reservations. For instance, along with the image of the king as a
grasping tyrant, many passages talk in a much more favorable manner about
monarchs. Niraqi writes that "Themost noble sort of justice is that of the king,
which is also the best sort of politics." Elsewhere he observes that a man needs
a king to protect him from rogues. (Jami', 1:121-22, 2:364). He also provides
a place for merchantsand the wealthy in the scheme of things, saying that God
inspires merchantswith a desire for wealth in order to assure food supply, since
this desire causes them to endurethe hardshipsof travellingover difficult terrain
with foodstuffs from regions of abundance to those of scarcity. The
reprehensible aspect of desire for wealth is only charging usurious interest.
(Jami', 3:263.) For all his ascetic ardor, he does allow that a person needs at
least a modest position in life. He cannot do without a servant to wait on him,
a friend to help him, a king to protect him from the oppression of the wicked.
He must therefore attain the sort of social position that will inspire loyalty in
his servant,constancy in his friends, and a desire to defend him in his monarch.
This sort of position is, like permissible wealth, a means to an end, not loved
for its own sake. Niraqi observes that one keeps a toilet and a wife in one's
house for the satisfying of needs, but one is hardlyin passionate love with them
for themselves. (Jami', 2:364-65). In the same way, a certainamountof wealth
and position are ethically allowable, but only as means. In the introductionto
his book, Niraqi notes that the Islamic philosophers generally supported an
Aristotelian position that virtue and happiness apply to the body as well as the
soul, and concurs as long as such bodily comforts are seen as means ratherthan
ends. (Jami', 1:70-71.) Just incidentally, the analogy concerning wives speaks
volumes for male conceptionsof matrimonyin eighteenthcenturyIran!

Niraqi proves in the end, then, to be an Aristotelian after all in his attitude
toward wealth and this world. He depicts the ideal style of life as that of the
    ideology, Ethics and Philosophical Discourse in Eighteenth Century Iran 27

propertiedintermediatestrata. The poor masses have too little wealth and
positionto gain the sort of respectthatallows a virtuousand rewardinglife,
whereasthe trulyrichandpowerfulareundulytemptedto see theirtreasuresand
authorityas endsratherthanmeans.

Elsewherein his volume Niraqi gives a differentpictureof the ulama and
mystics. He views envy, with its root cause of love of this world, as an
afflictionof almostall social ordersandoccupationalcategories. Everygroup
envies its peers and competeswith them. Niraqisees society as a zero-sum
game,in whicha gain foranyplayercomesat theexpenseof a loss for another.
Any one personcan acquiremoremoney or a higherpost only by depriving
someoneelse of it. Such an economicand sociologicaltheoryis incorrectif
applied to preindustrialsocieties indiscriminately,since economic growth
certainlyoccurredandoutpacedpopulation  increasesin someerasandareas. But
one suspectsthateighteenthcenturyIsfahanmaywell haveapproximated    sucha
zero-sumsociety,given the economicdislocationscausedby constantwarfare
andpoliticalinstability.

In any case, Niraqi saw a contrastbetween most professionsand religious
scholarship.The next world,afterall, is infiniteandcannotbe usedup, not at
all resemblinga zero-sumgame. Religiousknowledgeregardingthe nextworld
retainsthis remarkableinexhaustibilityeven if gainedin this materialworld.
One who loves the knowledgeof God,his attributesandactions,will not envy
someoneelse who also comesto knowthesethings. Forreligiousknowledgeis
not used up by manyknowers. One objectof knowledgecan be knownby a
millionknowers,andeach is delightedthatthe othersknowit. Suchreligious
knowledgeis enriched,ratherthandiminished,by thefellowshipof sharing.The
ulamaconcernedwiththe nextworld,then,experienceno envy.Theirobjectof
devotionhastakenthemout of thesordidzero-sumgameplayedby the worldly.
The only ulamawho mightexperienceenvy are the ulamaof this world,who
employ theirknowledgeto seek wealthand high position,which lands them
backin the zero-sumgame. The mysticknowers(al- 'drifin) are free of envy.
(Jaini', 2:209-10.) I stressthe identityof the trueulamawith the truemystics,
 since Niraqifrequentlyemploysmysticalandgnosticcodes. He speaksof the
 higheststage of passionatelove ('ishq) for God as the beatificvision (a Sufi
 doctrinelegalist Imamisrejected),and talks aboutunion(ittihaid)with God,
 quotingPersianpoetry. (Jami',3:146.)

 Moreover,some ulamawho possesshighpositionandwealthmay nevertheless
 not be blameworthy."Whoeverachievesfame loses this worldand the next,
 exceptfor thosewhomGod has maderenownedin orderto spreadhis religion,
 withoutany need to seek fame." (Jami',2:360.) Again,the authorappearsto
 be makinga distinctionbetweenthoseulamamatureenoughto employwealth
 and power as means to good ends, and those seducedby them as goals in
 themselves.

 Niraqi'svision of religiousinstitutionallife, moreover,requiresulamato hold
 variousoffices andprovideleadership.He believesin the necessityof holding
28 Cole

Fridaycongregationalprayerseven duringthe Occultationof the Twelfth Imam,
which in turnimplies the post of Fridayprayerleader in cities such as Isfahan,a
powerful and visible religious office.36            In a passage on the sin of
rebelliousness (al-baghy) against the properreligious authorities, he says that
Jews, Christians,and the Qurayshpolytheists have all been consigned to eternal
damnation because of their refusal to obey the Prophet and the Imams.
Likewise, some Muslims (the Sunnis) have done wrong to other Muslims.
Such rebelliousness, he prescribes, can be overcome by contemplating Qur'an
verses and oral reportsconcerningthe necessity of obeying God, the Prophet,the
wielders of authority, and others, including the ulama and Islamic legal
specialists (fuqahdt), who serve as the deputies (nuwwcb) of the Imams in the
time of the Occultation. (Jhmi', 1:401.) Thus, Niraqi reveals his belief in
taqlid, or emulation of ulama by lay believers, a largely Usuli doctrine. Its
social implication is, obviously, a leadershipposition for Usuli mojtaheds.

This surveyof attitudestowardvarioussocial groupsdemonstratesNiraqi'sedited
system of ethics to have a clear set of social biases. The best of men are those
ulama who master all the sciences of revelation and philosophy, cognizing
within themselves the universalsand so attainingan almost angelic state. Such
persons will have only middling wealth and status, enough to avoid shame but
not enough to be seduced by this world. Yet even within the ulama, some
pridefully restrict themselves only to the transmittedsciences of the revelation
(one suspects he means the conservativeAkhbaris),and so deprive themselves of
an ability to cognize the universalswhich can only come from the philosophical
sciences. Even some rationalistulama are seduced by this world into becoming
little more thandemagoguesin desperatesearchof authorityover and recognition
from the people.

Aside from the ulama and the sermonizers, other social groups often fall short
ethically, caught up in the zero-sum game of eighteenth century economic and
political competition. Non-Muslimsare afflicted with pride and rebellion. Even
the Muslim rich fall into hypocrisy and the illusion that salvation can be had for
a price. Muslim monarchs are often tyrants and despoilers (especially in the
eighteenth century?). Sayyeds begin depending on their lineage for charisma
ratherthan cultivating a personal sense of piety. Ordinaryworshippersseek to
be seen of men ratherthanof God. The ethical ideal of the God-realizedscholar
has a social location in the literateintermediatestratato which Niraqi belonged.
His ethics are not as abstractas it first appeared. Yet, as I shall attemptto show
below in my conclusion, such a surface readingof Niraqi'stext does not clear up
all the anomalies and seeming contradictions. We must seek further for the
models by which he depicts social groups and the dynamics governing that
depiction.

Conclusion

I hope I have laid to rest the myth of a narrow,literalistAkhbariculture
dominatingeighteenthcenturyIranbeforeBehbahani's Usulirevivalof the 1760s
and 1770s. Some scholarsof post-SafavidIsfahan,from Hazin Gilani to
Esma'il Khaju'iand MohammadMehdiNiraqi,kept alive the cosmopolitan
religiouscultureof the School of Isfahanthroughoutthe eighteenthcentury.
Thesepolymathsexcelledin everysciencefromhadith-reports   fromtheProphet
and Imams to Avicennian metaphysics, from Euclidean geometry to
illuminationistmysticism. Contraryto the monochromepicturepaintedby
MomenandArjomandin theworkscitedabove,theIsfahaniandKashaniscenes
appearto havebeen religiouslydiverseandintellectuallyrigorous.Philosophy
(hikmah)wasnotdroppedfromtheIsfahaniseminaries'   curriculum,andone does
indeedfindgnostic-rationalist
                            mojtahedson thepatternof Baha'ad-Dinal-Amili,
in theverypersonsof Hazin,Khaju'i,andNiraqithemselves.

Two final tasks,whichI set myselfat the outset,remainsomewhatunfinished.
First,Niraqi'sattitudetowardsocial groups,his ideologicalmodelif you will,
remainsa bitobscurebecauseso manyseemingcontradictions     remainin theway
he depictsthese groups. Second,I wantto workout the social and linguistic
meaningof the strugglebetweenliteralistAkhbarisand the rationalistsa bit
morerigorously.As to the issue of the depictionof social groups,we have to
ask whetherNiraqisimplycontradictshimself. Does he say in one place that
kings are usurpingtyrantsfromwhomgifts oughtnot to be accepted,and in
anotherthata sovereign'sjustice is the most valuedsort,and a believermust
striveto gain the respectof his monarchso as to receivehis protection?Does
he condemnwealthand the wealthyin one breathand praisemerchantsfor
providingfood in the next? Areprayerleadersalmostuniversallyvenalandyet
aretheybothgood andnecessary?Areulamabothexemptfromthepettinessof
the zero-sumgain and yet subjectto abasementthroughfalse pride? Is high
positiona curseor a blessingfor the religiousscholar?Are mysticscharlatans
or theonly personsclose to theangels?

Oneresolutionof thesecontradictions,some of whichareonly apparent,would
be to blamethe adab methodof quotingandexcerptingfrompreviousauthors.
SinceMiskawayhandal-Ghazalididnotalwayssee eye to eye, drawingon both
in the samecompendiumwouldopenthe way to manycontradictions.But this
approachrequiresthe conclusionthatthecompilerhadno senseof consistency,
and did not weed out majorcontradictionswhen choosing or paraphrasing
passagesfrom diversepast works. Moreover,by insistingthat the workcan
never overcome the atomizationof informationimplied in the method of
selective quotation, this objection reduces the text and its message to
incoherence.Yet Niraqi,a mantrainedin logic andphilosophy,seemsunlikely
to haveproducedorbeensatisfiedwithan incoherent treatment
                                                        of ethics.

 Rather,I believe thatbehindthe seemingcontradictionsin Niraqi'sviews of
 society and ethics lies a coherentmodel thatfor the most partperformsin a
30 Cole

consistentmanner. This modelis the facultiesof the soul themselves. Levi-
Straussandothershavelong sinceestablishedthe tendencyof humanbeingsto
select an arbitraryset of naturalsymbols to representsocial distinctions,a
phenomenonin primitivesocieties called totemism. Thus (very simplyput)
lions are to eagles as tribeA is to tribeB.37 SociologistBarrySchwartzhas
arguedthatsuchanalogiesbetweennaturalconditionsandsocietaldivisionsare
employedby modernsocieties,as well. In particular,   he haspointedto the use
of spatialconceptionsof "high"and "low"drawnfromthe physicalworldto
indicatesocialdominanceandinferiority.Forinstance,theU. S. electoratehas
tendedto electtallmenpresident,andworkingclassesarecalled"lowerclasses."
In this case, he asserts, spatial differentiationsare being used as "totemic
operators" withwhichto thinkaboutsocialdistinctions.38

I wouldarguethatthe facultiesof the soul functionedfor Niraqi,andperhaps
othersin his intellectualtradition,as totemicoperators.Herethe "nature"  being
drawnuponis humanpsychologyas understood        by the Greco-Islamic  tradition,
whichthey considered,despiteits locus in humans,as no less a naturalgiven
thananimalbehavior. Moreover,it is perhapsnot too far-fetchedto see a
genuinelytotemicauraaboutthesefaculties.I wantto drawattentiononcemore
to theadjectivesby whichNiraqicharacterizes   them. Theintellectis angelic;the
irascible faculty is leonine or predatory;the appetitivefaculty is beastly
(bahimiyyah;the wordindicatesquadrupeds,      but its pluralimplieslivestockor
cattle);andthefacultyof cunningis demonic.Herewe havea symmetryin that
the two extreme terms are representedby supernaturalbeings, angels and
demons,whereasthe two middletermsare representedby the naturalanimal
categories,predators andlivestock.Theseadjectivesreinforcemy argumentthat
thereis somethingtotemicaboutthe way Niraqiuses the facultiesto explain
socialvices andvirtues.

I find scatteredevidence that particulargroupsof people, in Niraqi'sview,
exemplifythe dominanceof specificfaculties. One difficultyhere lies in the
differencebetweenthe generallyPlatonicschemaNiraqiinheritsandtransmits
overtly, wherein the intellective faculty is associated with the king or
philosopher, andthequitedifferentschemaNtraqisubconsciously  projectsoutof
the social conditionsof his own place and time, whereinkings were seldom
philosophers.39If one follows the clues givenby Niraqi'suse of adjectives,it
becomesclearthatkingsareactuallyanalogousto the irasciblefaculty,withits
characteristicsof attack and self-defense. Ulama are symbolized by the

Sociology of Knowledge (Chicago: Chicago University Press, 1981), pp. 28-29,
36.
39 The overt statement Niraqi makes is that the intellective faculty is like a king
(malik) or philosopher (hakim), the irascible faculty like a dog, the appetitive
faculty like a pig, and the faculty of cunning like a demon; see Niraqi, Jdmi', vol.
1, p. 63. Such language reinforces my general argument about the totemic nature
of these categories.
    Ideology, Ethics and Philosophical Discourse in Eighteenth Century Iran 31

intellective faculty. Merchantsare associated with the appetitive faculty. Now,
it must be rememberedthat the faculties' ethical evaluation is determined by a
scale that includes two extremes and a mean betwixt them. Thus, a human
being whose irascible faculty has gone to an extreme of deficiency would be a
coward, whereas an extreme of excess would produce a tyrant. Normal human
beings, who do not usurp others' rights but prudently defend their own, have
conditioned their irascible faculties to moderation. The same dialectic of two
extremes mediated by a mean appears to apply to the social groups Niraqi
discusses. An atrophy of the irascible faculty would prevent the king from
leading a just holy war, whereas its uncontrolledexpression would turnhim into
a despot. When the king acts in moderation,just as In the case of the irascible
 faculty itself, he provides protectionto others in society from the Hobbesianwar
 of all against all. If one sees the irascible faculty, on the Aristotelian scale of
 extremes, as a totem for the king, then Niraqi's seeming penchant for self-
 contradiction when discussing this institution evaporates. Kings are weak or
 oppressive or good depending upon where they fall on the scale of extreme and
 moderation,just as is the faculty that symbolizes them. Figure 1 expresses this
 argumentwith extension to other majorsocial groupsdiscussed by Niraqi.

 This attemptto systematize clues spreadthroughoutNiraqi'sbook is, admittedly,
 not without problems. Sometimes he does not identify a social group in terms
 of a single faculty or attribute,and sometimes he gives only one extreme and the
 mean, without specifying the other extreme. Further, these social groups are
 made up of humanindividualswho possess all three faculties, which could easily
 complicate the analysis. But I maintain that Niraqi's discourse about these
32 Cole

groups as groups betraysa tendency to employ the faculties as totemic operators.
Like the faculties themselves, no social group is inherentlyworthless. Rather,
it can become virtuous if it avoids the two extremes and attains a mean. This
task might requirea profound change in identity--Niraqimakes it clear that he
thinks infidels can only attain virtue by converting. Further,ulama who restrict
themselves to the transmitted sciences are not cultivating their intellective
faculties as they would be in studying metaphysicsand philosophicalethics. By
definition, the strict Akhbari school commits a vice in failing to cultivate the
intellective faculty, and conservative Akhbaris are therefore deprived of the
mystical gnosis that lifts the theosopher to the realm of the angels. The Sufis,
likewise, go astray if they forsake the rational sciences for an ecstatic
antinomianism. On the other hand, there is no difference between an Usuli
mystic knower and a trueSufi.

In thinking about these three camps of Twelver men of the cloth--the Akhbaris,
Usulis, and Sufis, I would like to pursue the analogy I mentioned in the
introduction with monolinguality and multilinguality. Sociolinguists have
noted that persons who speak only one language tend to show suspicion toward
the bilingual and multilingual. Those who commandmore thanone language or
code clearly are either "not from around here" or have fallen under foreign
influences. Moreover, those who are fluent in more than one language tend to
engage in code-switching. We have all heardIranianimmigrantsto the United
States mixing English words into their Persiansentences and vice versa. Again,
the monolingual person shows disdain for this practice of code-switching,
denigrating it with epithets such as "Pinglish" or, in another example,
"Franglais." But code-switching has been shown to be a highly sophisticated
practice, wherein borrowings are subconsciously guaged according to social
context, ratherthan a random bastardizationof the languages involved. Only
someone who genuinely controls both languagescan effortlessly (and sometimes
unwittingly) move from one to the other in the midst of a sentence. Bilingual
or multilingualspeakerstend to switch codes only when conversing with another
person who is bilingual. Thus, a French-educatedLebanese switches back and
forth from Arabic to Frenchwith persons who have received a similar education.
Code-switching can emphasize social solidarity among a group with a shared
experience of bilinguality, an experience which helps to define them as an elite
(as in the case of the French-educatedLebanese)or as a marginalgroup (as in the
case of, say, gypsies).40

The analogy I propose is between monolingual communities and multilingual
ones, on the one hand, and between scriptural literalists and cosmopolitan
rationalistsor mystics, on the other. Just as a language is a code governed by a
system called grammar,I am suggesting, so the various religious disciplines
mentioned above form part of cultural codes. Thus, dialectical discourse
constitutes a code generated by a basic system of synthetic principles, and this
way of thinking when switched with the scriptural code makes dialectical
theology or kalam possible. Again, peripateticphilosophy is feasible only with


40 Gumperz, Discourse Strategies, especially chapters 3 and 4.
    Ideology, Ethics and Philosophical Discourse in Eighteenth Century Iran 33

the adoptionof a code of communicationgeneratedby a system of demonstrative
logic. Mystical and illuminationist thought often requiredthe recognition of a
code generatedby deliberatecontradiction,a blurringof the conceptualboundaries
recognizedboth in common-sense discourse and in highly rationaldisciplines.

The strict constructionists, such as the conservative Akhbaris in Twelver
Shi'ism or the Hanbalis in Sunnism, acted as a monolingual group. They
wished to restrict discourse to those genres that could be elaborated by a
common-sense, literalist approach to scriptural texts. They formed a social
group, recognized one another, studied with one another, and often even
intermarriedwith one another's families. Their approach required the least
rigorous intellectual training and the least imagination, and it promised a
minimum of doubt or cognitive dissonance. The divine scripturecould answer
all questions about human behavior unambiguously, if only the right passage
could be found and literally applied, Akhbarisargued. As users of only a single
code, Akhbarisor scripturalliteralists manifestedgreat distrustof those scholars
who learned and accepted another cultural system, such as dialectical or
demonstrative logic. On the other hand, rationalists or Usulis, as a class of
clerical intellectuals, valued the freedom and mental challenge the learning of
 furtherculturalcodes could bestow upon them. In the Safavid period, of course,
 the learningof multiplecodes and code-switching attainedsomething of a zenith
 in theosophists such as Molla Sadra,who drew on dialectical, demonstrativeand
 mystical systems, mixing them together with the scriptural code. Such an
 ability requiredunusualintelligenceand a high degree of training,and so attracted
 elite intellectuals and some clerics. Niraqi clearly belongs in this tradition,and
 in his work on ethics he self-consciously states that his definitions of virtue and
 the good are intendedto be generalenough to reconcile the views of threegroups
 of scholars: the people of theoretical knowledge (ahl an-nazar), the people of
 ecstatic states (ahl al-kashf wa al-Wil), and the people of literalism (ahl az-
 zehir). These are obviously the philosophers, the Sufis and the scripturalists
  such as the Akhbaris. (Jami', 1:72.) The strict constructionists with their
  monocode, however, proved unreconciledand generallypilloriedMolla Sadraand
  the theosophersin his tradition.

 Thus, the advocacy of a single, scripturalistreligious code can function as a
 social control mechanism. If an Akhbarisuch as Yusof al-Bahraniforbade the
 study of rationalist subjects such as philosophy and theology, the prohibition
 had to be policed. This gave ulama of the Akhbarischool a platform to assert
 dominance over rationalistscholars, and, indeed, to stigmatize them as sinners.
 The conservative Akhbariideology possessed the advantageof having a populist
 appeal, giving lay believers the right to make many decisions that Usulis said
 only elite mojtaheds were qualified to make. The Arab Shi'is in Karbala,with
 their ties to the local Arabpopulace, appearto have employed their monocode to
 place immigrantelite Iranianscholarsat a disadvantage. Niraqi'slife and works
 help demonstrate the continued popularity in Isfahan, however, of a multiple
 code for religious discourse. Admittedly, this intellectual traditionwas elitist,
 but enough of an elite survived 1722 to make its continuance possible. The
 rationalist-gnosticthinkersof Isfahanexcoriated Akhbariswith their single code
34   Cole

of discourseas narrowandstunted,preventedby theirscripturalist  pridefrom

into the realmof the angels. At any one time and place, these two sorts of
discourse,basedon a singlecode versusmultiplecodes,weretakenup by social
groupsas elementsof Identityandas meansof differentiating  themselvesand
evendominating  othergroups.Arjomand   suggestedanethnicdifferencebetween

than that, with ethnic groups,social classes, and even generationalcohorts
alternatelyadoptingone or the other sort of discoursefor their social and
Intellectual
           purposes.
