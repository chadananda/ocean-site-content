    Relativism and th e B ahá’í Writings

Ian Kluge

1\. Introduction

Relativism is a philosophical outlook that denies the
existence of absolutely valid or universal truth claims of any
kind, of ethical or legal standards, of religious revelation, of
any universal point of view, of universal customs and of
rationality or reasoning. In other words, the validity of all
claims to any absolute or universal ‘knowledge’ can be reduced
and limited to statements possibly valid in a particular context,
to a particular situation and to a particular point of view. In
sum, we cannot say that X is true but only that X may be true
for someone in a particular context; “truth is relative to the
standpoint of the judging subject.”1 Indeed, some forms of
relativism reject the notions of ‘truth’ and ‘objectivity’
altogether.2 Furthermore, there is no universal or Archimedean
standpoint from which to judge the validity of various
contesting truth claims – which means, in effect, that no truth
claim can actually be proven wrong. There are no errors. All
opinions and judgments are equally valid. Because truth claims
are so hedged with conditions, there can be no certainty about
anything. While this may be existentially salutary in keeping us
modest, in epistemology and ethics its is, as we shall see,
disastrous.

In its most succinct terms, relativism is an attack on the very
idea of knowledge/truth and an insistence that all claims to
knowledge/truth are no more than personally or culturally held
opinions or according to Nietzsche, Lyotard and Foucault,
expressions of the will to power, or of endless Nietzschean and
Derridean interpretations or Rortian “solidarity” ... of anything
except actual knowledge. Even the ‘evidence’ brought to
support these opinions is itself no more than merely another
opinion or interpretation or another exertion of power and so
on in an infinite regress. Since there can be no neutral and
transcendent Archimedean standpoint from which to arbitrate
among various claims to knowledge/truth, all truth claims may

be rejected as in nihilism, held in abeyance as in scepticism
(epistemological agnosticism) or accepted as equally valid as in
relativism.

Any ideology or system of thought that claims to have
knowledge/truth is, by virtue of this claim, is not relativistic
since any arbitration among candidates for truth implicitly or
explicitly requires the discovery of a neutral, privileged and
transcendent Archimedean standpoint from which to render
judgment. On this ground alone, it is questionable that the
Bahá’í Writings may be accurately described as espousing
relativism: they do, after all, categorically assert the existence of
God and hold His existence as provable,3 that Bahá’u’lláh is the
Manifestation of God for this age, that the universe is an
emanation from God, that there are four causes and that all
things have essence and attributes.4 Such assertions are simply
logically incompatible with either epistemological or
ontological relativism.

It is the contention of this paper that the Bahá’í Writings
manifest not relativism but relationalism,5 an outlook that is
often confused with relativism. In a nutshell, relationalism
holds that all things exist in relationship to other things but it
does rejects the idea that the existence or reality of things is
dependent on the perceiver, that there is no neutral, privileged
Archimedean point from which to make judgments among
competing knowledge claims, that all knowledge claims are
equally valid, that error is impossible, that partial knowledge is
incorrect knowledge and that no knowledge/truth whatever can
be universal (true from all possible standpoints), objective
(independent of the perceiver) and foundational (not susceptible
to further analysis). This relationalism leads to a position which
may broadly be described as ‘evolutionary Platonic
perspectivism.’ It is ‘evolutionary’ because our knowledge
increases or progresses over time; ‘Platonic’ because there are
“eternal verities”6 true for all times and places and
‘perspectivist’ because there may be many perspectives on the
truth although not all perspectives are necessarily valid. The
doctrine of progressive revelation is an example of such
‘evolutionary Platonic perspectivism.’ For example, through
successive revelations we have adopted various perspectives as
we learn more and more about the relationship between the
various Manifestations, but one of these possible perspectives,
denying the “station of unity,”7 is simply not valid.

This change from ‘relativism’ to ‘relationalism’ is more than a
mere change in terminology. In the first place, ‘relativism’ is

Lights of ‘Irfán Book Nine                                    181

simply not an accurate description of the philosophy embedded
in the Writings. If we do not use terminology correctly and
accurately, we will inevitably raise misunderstandings about
their philosophical nature and lead own thinking astray.
Consequently, it becomes more difficult to teach, explicate and
defend the Faith. Third, as we have seen, and shall see again
below, relativism has a lot of philosophical baggage, i.e. brings
with it a considerable number of philosophical problems that
weaken any explication of the Writings, and leave it open to all
kinds of attacks and misrepresentations. This, too, makes
teaching, explicating and defending needlessly difficult and
inefficient.

Relativism is an important issue because of the tremendous
consequences for ethics, epistemology, ontology and
metaphysics, law, religion, cultural studies and politics. For
example, in international relations and law, cultural relativism
prevents us from legislating in favour of universal human rights
since our advocacy of such rights is merely a reflection of our
particular political legal and cultural situation. Because human
rights are merely cultural and not universal, we have no
obligation let alone right to insist that other countries and other
cultures abide by our views. Relativism renders all complaints
about human-rights violations futile or worse, a form of
imperialist bullying to impose one’s own standards on others.
Quite obviously, the practice of international politics is
dramatically affected by the adoption of a relativist outlook.
All too easily hard-heartedness and/or political cynicism can be
the result. Relativism also undermines such Bahá’í teachings as
the unqualified obligation to provide equal education to girls
and boys, to provide equal rights for women and to end the
extremes of wealth and poverty. Who, after all, has the right to
insist that these teachings set the standards by which the world
must abide?

Relativism also has enormous implications in regards to the
subject of truth. For example, if all scientific truth claims are
limited to a particular point of view, culture and situation, then
there can be no universal scientific truth claims of any kind,
and, conversely, there can be no erroneous ones. Thomas
Kuhn’s The Structure of Scientific Revolutions prepared the
way for the acceptance of such radical relativist conclusions.
According to Kuhn, all scientific theories and facts are relative
to the paradigm – the assumptions, techniques and theories –
which is being employed. While there are changes in the history
of science, these changes do not involve an increase or
clarification of improvement of knowledge because different

paradigms are “incommensurable.” They employ different
concepts, change the meanings of terms as well as the standards
for what are real ‘facts’ and real ‘explanations. Scientific
theories change not because they are more ‘true’ but because of
power relations, social-cultural customs and other interests at
play in society. Kuhn’s protests that he was not a relativist
notwithstanding, there can be little question that his book
supported a radical epistemological or cognitive relativism.
Indeed, the full fruit of his relativist views became evident in
Paul Feyerabend’s Against Method which says that science has
no claim to superiority over astrology or voodoo, that science
is nothing less than a system of mythology like any other and
should be taught as such in schools and that other approaches to
knowledge such as magic should also be taught.

“All methodologies have their limitations and the only
'rule' that survives is ‘anything goes.’”8

Kuhn’s and Feyerabend’s relativism has received additional
philosophical support from some of the most influential
postmodern philosophers such as Frederich Nietzsche, Francois
Lyotard, Jacques Derrida, Michel Foucault and Richard Rorty
to name only the most prominent. By various paths they all
come to agree that there are no facts, only individual or
collective viewpoints, or “solidarities,” that no single all-
inclusive perspective exists, that all these viewpoints are equal
and none “privileged” above any other, and that there is no
universal or Archimedean standpoint from which to judge
among competing viewpoints.9 The influence of postmodern
philosophy reaches throughout virtually all branches and levels
of academia. Some subjects, such as literary studies, have been
radically transformed by the encounter to the point where
‘theory’ to swamp the subject of literature itself. Philosophy has
felt its very legitimacy and usefulness as a subject challenged10
not to mention basic concepts such as knowledge, rationality
and truth as well as the whole notion of metaphysics.11 History
has been touched by, among other things, the struggle over the
whole notion of grand narratives versus small or local
narratives,12 the knowability of the past, as well as the uses of
history.13 Women’s Studies, though not in themselves part of
postmodernism, have been affected by the entire
deconstructionist project, by postmodernism’s analysis of
power relations and, more controversially, by its antipathy to
essentialism. Psychology feels the influence of postmodern
thinking in its handling of gender and political science in
discussions of marginalization and the workings of power.14
Cultural Studies have opened new vistas for exploration

through the study of simulations and simulacra.15
Postmodernism has also re-shaped and revised Freudian psycho-
analysis.16

Because of its apparent intellectual egalitarianism and
tolerance of all views as acceptable and equally valid, as well as
its apparent ability to solve alleged contradictions in the Bahá’í
Writings, relativism has attracted the favourable attention of a
number of Bahá’í writers. These often take their cue from
Shoghi Effendi’s statement that

> Its [the Bahá’í Faith’s] teachings revolve around the
> fundamental principle that religious truth is not absolute
> but relative, that Divine Revelation is progressive, not
> final. Unequivocally and without the least reservation it
> proclaims all established religions to be divine in origin,
> identical in their aims, complementary in their functions,
> continuous in their purpose, indispensable in their value
> to mankind.17
Shoghi Effendi also writes that

> the fundamental principle which constitutes the bedrock
> of Bahá'í belief, [is] the principle that religious truth is
> not absolute but relative, that Divine Revelation is
> orderly, continuous and progressive and not spasmodic or
> final.18

These statements in conjunction with the teachings of the
essential oneness of all religions have led some Bahá’ís to adopt
relativism as a means of resolving philosophical, ethical and
religious differences between the Bahá’í Faith and other
religions. For some authors, such as Moojan Momen and Seena
Fazel, relativism has become the intellectual foundation stone
for establishing the unity among the diversity of religions.

This paper contends that these solutions do not accurately
represent the Bahá’í Writings. There philosophically less
problematic ways to understand the Bahá’í Writings and to
explicate their teachings on religious unity and diversity than by
adopting relativism. It holds that the most accurate and least
problematic terms to describe the Writings are “relationalism”
and “evolutionary Platonic perspectivism.”

2\. A Theoretical Framew ork for Relativism

All forms of relativism implicitly or explicitly reject three
positions – universalism, objectivism and foundationalism and

that all forms of absolutism accept these three in one way or
another. Universalism in its ontological and “discursive”19
variants asserts that certain ideas, truths, situations, natures and
states-of-being are found everywhere and at all times.
Ontological universalism asserts that there are “entities (classes
of existents) which exist for all persons.”20 “Discursive”21
universalism maintains there are statements and beliefs which
are valid in all contexts, at all times and all places and for all
peoples

Relativism also rejects objectivism which asserts that certain
beliefs and truths as well as certain things, situations, states-of-
being are what they are independently of an observer or a
world-view. Ontological objectivism means that “there are
entities (classes of existents) which exist independently of the
point of view , corpus of beliefs or conceptual scheme held to
or employed by any particular person or society.”22 “Discursive”
objectivism says there are beliefs that are true regardless of
viewpoint, beliefs, or explanatory frameworks, which obviously
conflicts with the idea that man, not the object of perception,
is the measure of things, of truth and falsity.

Relativism also denies foundationalism according to which
there are certain truths as well as existing things and states-of
affairs that are fundamental, i.e. not susceptible to further
breakdown and analysis. Ontological foundationalism asserts
that there is “a common ontology or set of basic existents,
incapable of further analysis out of which all other existents are
constructed.”23 The “discursive” version of foundationalism
asserts there are basic statements or propositions incapable of
further analysis which serve not only as a foundation for other
statements but also as an Archimedean point from which to
make objective judgments.

In studying relativism, we must also be aware of its various
subtypes. Some of these subtypes overlap. Perhaps the most
obvious of these is ethical relativism which denies that there are
any universal, objective or foundational ethical norms applying
to individuals or cultural collectives. In the last analysis, ethics
are a matter of preference, or, a matter of local necessities.
There can be no definitive i.e. universal, ethical judgments, or
as Shakespeare says in Hamlet, “There is nothing either good or
bad but thinking makes it so.”24 The counterposition to ethical
relativism is ethical realism which contends that at least some
ethical standards are universal, objective and fundamental.

Cognitive or epistemological relativism maintains that what
is    considered ‘true’ either by individuals and by

Lights of ‘Irfán Book Nine                                    185

cultures/societies will vary and that ‘knowledge’, i.e. so-called
‘facts’, are culture and/or theory laden and reflect only
particular societies and individuals. There are no objective
‘truths’ since all truths are expressed from a specific individual
and/or cultural point of view. In other words, the truth-value
of a statement is relative to its context, and therefore, no
statement or standpoint is privileged over any others. No
possible Archimedean point, or universal viewpoint can be
found to frame all forms of enquiry or to make objective
judgments among different truth claims, world-views or
paradigms. In a word, objectivity, including scientific
objectivity, is impossible – a view we have already encountered
in the work of Kuhn and Feyerabend. Cognitive relativism
asserts that reason, rationality and logic are culturally
determined and not objective, foundational or universally
applicable. Reason is not an avenue to true knowledge.

At this point it is important to distinguish among three
distinct but closely related concepts: scepticism, relativism and
subjectivism. The boundaries among these three positions are
fluid and one easily slides into the other. Scepticism refers to a
complex of views that deny “that knowledge or even rational
belief is possible, either about some specific subject matter (e.g.
ethics) or in any area whatsoever.”25 Sceptics often maintain
that “none of our beliefs is certain, that none of our beliefs is
reasonable, that none of our beliefs is more reasonable than its
opposite.”26 Scepticism can be limited to certain areas, but
[g]lobal scepticism casts doubt on all our attempts to seek
truth.27 Sceptics deny that any knowledge can be universal,
objective and foundational.

In its simplest form, relativism says that all truth claims are
only ‘true’ from one individual or cultural standpoint and that
there is no Archimedean point from which to choose the true
one or even merely the ‘truest’ from among competing views.
Relativism does not necessarily deny that we can know truth but
insists that all truth-claims are standpoint-dependent. Another
way of saying this is that we all have facets or aspects of the
truth from our own viewpoints but that none of these facets
are objective, universal or foundational.

For its part, subjectivism maintains that there is no reality
existing independently from the consciousness of a subjective
observer who constitutes reality as s/he experiences it. Already
evident in the Greek relativist philosopher, Protagoras,
subjectivism is an extreme application to the individual of the
relativist principle that all truth-claims or ethical claims depend

on standpoint or context. What we pass off as apparently
objective statements are really the expression of our (often
emotive) preferences.28

At this point it is clear that relativism and scepticism are
closely intertwined and that their differences notwithstanding,
relativism can easily slip into scepticism – from ‘everything is
true from its viewpoint’ to ‘we don’t know if anything is true’
and even ‘there can be no truth.’ The problem with relativism’s
tolerance of all truth-claims as equally valid is that some truth-
claims are so virulently incompatible – a rigorous materialism
and theism for example – that a difference in viewpoint seems
inadequate to resolve the conflict. It is difficult to imagine that
there is a little patch of reality in which God plays no part from
any standpoint whatever, and another part of the universe
where God is omnipresent. Sooner or later, the friction between
these viewpoints will force us to analyse them in regards to
rational/logical and experiential adequacy in order to resolve
the conflict. The same holds true with the various conflicting
subjectivist claims: ‘true for me’ and ‘true for you’ seems an
inadequate response to views about female circumcision for
small girls or the willingness to accept poverty on a large scale.
However, it is not difficult to see how relativism easily merges
into a subjectivist attitude.

Anthropological relativism affirms that what is called ‘human
nature’ is infinitely malleable and that there is no specifically
definable human nature to study. In Sartre’s words, existence
and freedom precede essence29 – indeed, there is no human
nature of essence that is given to us. Because there is no pre-
given, pre-constituted human nature, we cannot argue that
certain practices are ‘unnatural’ or counter to ‘natural law’, or
that there are certain standards that all individuals and/or
cultures ought to adopt.

Closely associated with anthropological relativism is cultural
relativism according to which every culture and by implication
every language organise the flux of impressions into their own
version of reality as well as work out the associated values, their
own protocols for discovering and assessing knowledge or truth
and their own criteria by which to determine human nature. As
a result of this organising or constructing of reality, all facts are
value-laden, shaped and limited by certain biases inherent in
every construction. These biases prevent us from obtaining an
objective viewpoint independent of all observers, from
obtaining a universal viewpoint true of all human beings and a
foundational view necessarily true for all.

Lights of ‘Irfán Book Nine                                    187

One form of cultural relativism might be called linguistic
relativism. This kind of relativism, known as the Sapir-Whorf
hypothesis, argues that different languages with different
grammars and vocabularies require people to constitute/create
the world variously because languages focus attention on
different things, present time and space differently and
conditions the thought patterns of its speakers. Consequently
there is no way to use language to represent the world perfectly
or for all. Again we see the denial of universalism, objectivism
and foundationalism that characterizes relativist views. How
can there be universalism if no language can express the world
for all? How can there be objectivity if all – even contradictory
world-views are equally valid? If all world versions are different,
how can there be foundational truths?

Legal relativism is, of course, a subtype of ethical relativism.

It asserts that laws do not reflect an objective, universal and
foundational human nature or human situation and are entirely
local to a particular time, place and culture. For this reason,
laws and legal standards such as human rights and the definition
of persons cannot be applied across cultures. There is no sense
to the claim that one legal system is better or worse, or more or
less progressive than any other.

Ontological relativism contends whatever things are deemed
to exist or constitute reality is determined by individual and/or
cultural beliefs and that all statements about the existence of
things is context-dependent. The existence of any ‘reality’ is
entirely dependent on the vision or version of reality we have
constructed because there is no viewer-and-standpoint
independent world. It is possible to take this quite literally by
arguing in a manner reminiscent of Kant (on whom more below)
that we humans take the raw materials presented by the universe
and by means of our own concepts and choices of the
boundaries of each thing construct the universe we live in.30
Physics, painting or the writing of history or sociology are all
ways of ‘world-making.’ Thus, there is no such thing as ‘one
world’ and there is no Archimedean standpoint from which to
decide which world is superior in any way. We can only adopt
the pragmatic position that a particular world lends itself to our
purposes more readily than other worlds.

The       rejection   of    universalism, objectivism and
foundationalism observed in the various types of relativism
entails at least ten major consequences:
1\. There is an infinite number of ‘realities’ which can be

constructed by human beings, either individually or

> collectively. These many or may not be reconcilable.

There is no common reality or world for all people.
2\. There is an infinite number of equally valid theories,

> descriptions and explanations of any one or all of these
> ‘realities.’ These may or may not be reconcilable.
3\. There cannot be a single universally valid description,

> theory or even scientific explanation of all these
> ‘realities.’ In other words, there is no final description.
4\. There can be no universally valid ethical prescriptions

> since ethical prescriptions are matters of individual
> and/or collective choice because there is no common
> ethical world for all people.
5\. Consequently, there can be no universal language capable

> of expressing the truths of all ‘realities.’ The existence of
> such a ‘universal language’ is strictly prohibited and
> would be an undesirable attack on diversity.
6\. There are no final, foundation propositions or truths that

> cannot be subject to other, contradictory but equally
> valid points of view.
7\. Relativism makes it impossible to adopt the

> correspondence theory of truth because no one can know
> which version of reality is decisive, i.e. no version of
> reality can lead us to a final decision.
8\. As Plato already pointed out in the Theaetetus, relativism

> makes it impossible for people to be wrong, misled,
> deceived, psychotic or simply perverse in their thinking.

Everyone is right about everything.
9\. Viewpoints change, but there is no Archimedean

> any other. Thus, relativism makes the Bahá’í concept of

> progress.
10\. Relativism makes the concept of a divine Manifestation

> impossible because a Manifestation has a privileged,
> Archimedean standpoint which make His pronouncements
> normative for all of humankind and all cultures at this
> time.

3\. Virtues of Rel ativism

What, we may ask ourselves, does relativism have to
recommend it, especially in the modern world? The answer that
comes most readily to mind is that relativism helps make us
aware of and sensitive to differing contexts and standpoint and,
thereby, encourages not only a willingness to be open-minded
but also the intellectual discipline of studying issues from new
and unexpected viewpoints. This in turn, forces us to examine
our own beliefs critically and to test their adequacy in regards
to other candidates. These advantages, though apparently easy
to state succinctly, can have an enormous impact on our
intellectual culture and the way we approach knowledge-claims
both our own and others’. Relativism also allows us to make
sense of the bewildering variety of human customs, beliefs and
practices without feeling the need to impose one particular
belief or culture on others. We can embrace the various facets
of truth (if there is such a thing) of each viewpoint. In other
words, relativism can prevent a hasty rush to judgment about
different or even outlandish beliefs.

Becoming more aware of the diversity of contexts we learn
of the tremendous diversity of human cultures, thoughts, legal
and social systems, bodies of knowledge and art forms. Because
it rejects the claim that there exists any Archimedean standpoint
from which to evaluate human constructs and activities,
relativism is non-judgmental, open-minded and understanding.
In a world plagued by all kinds of prejudices and animosities,
relativism seems to foster attitudes and modii operandi that
answer the world’s needs for mutual appreciation and respect.

4\. Ba ckgroun d to R elativism

To understand why relativism is not compatible with the
Bahá’í Writings, we must engage in at least a cursory
exploration of the subject. The first explicit relativist is
Protagoras, a philosopher in the 5th century B.C.E. Athens, who
declares “Man is the measure of all things: of things which are,
that they are, and of things which are not, that they are not."”31
He also said that “things are to you as they appear to you and to
me such as they appear to me.”32 In these statements that
Protagoras already strikes most, if not all, the major relativist
themes in regards to epistemology, ethics and ontology.
Epistemologically, he means that man, not the object of
knowledge, determines what is true or false about what is
perceived. The nature of an object as well as all of its attributes
are governed by man, i.e. all attributes are relative to the

perceiver. Ethically, Protagoras’ statement means that whatever
is good or bad is decided by man and that “There is nothing
either good or bad but thinking makes it so.”33 Ontologically, it
is man who determines whether something or some situation or
state of affairs is or is not. Protagoras also introduces the theme
of subjectivism which accompanies relativism by saying that
things are as they appear to us as individuals, which is to say,
you and I have different truths simply because we are different
individuals with different points of view. In the last analysis
“knowledge is only [personal] perception”34

Protagoras’ pronouncements are paradigmatic for relativism.

Though he did not exhaust the subject, he certainly outlined
most of its essential themes. First, there is the rejection of
universalism both in its ontological and “discursive”35 variants.
Ontological universalism asserts that there are “entities (classes
of existents) which exist for all persons.”36 “Discursive”
universalism maintains there are statements and beliefs which
are valid in all contexts, at all times and all places and for all
peoples. Second, Protagoras also rejects objectivism.
Ontological objectivism means that “there are entities (classes
of existents) which exist independently of the point of view ,
corpus of beliefs or conceptual scheme held to or employed by
any particular person or society.”37 When Protagoras says things
are, i.e. exist because we think they are, he denies ontological
objectivism, and, in effect, prefigures some ideas from
postmodernist constructionism. “Discursive” objectivism says
there are beliefs that are true regardless of viewpoint, beliefs, or
explanatory frameworks, which obviously conflicts with the
idea that man, not the object of perception, is the measure of
things, of truth and falsity. Finally, Protagoras beliefs reject
foundationalism which follows as an implicit consequence of his
earlier statements. Ontological foundationalism asserts that
there is “a common ontology or set of basic existents, incapable
of further analysis out of which all other existents are
constructed.”38 This violates Protagoras’ dictum that man
decides “things which are, that they are, and of things which are
not, that they are not.”39 The “discursive” version of
foundationalism asserts there are basic statements or
propositions incapable of further analysis which serve not only
as a foundation for other statements but also as an
Archimedean point from which to make objective judgments.

In Protagoras’ thought we can discern explicitly and
implicitly, the three trade-mark attributes of relativism: the
denial of universalism (no truth applies everywhere), of
foundationalism (there are only viewpoints, no final truths) and

of objectivism (reality is only what it is to me or to you).
4\.1 David Hume (1711 – 1776)

After Protagoras, the next major development in the history
of relativism was Hume, a British philosopher whose work does
not espouse relativism but nevertheless provides it with two of
main ideas. According to Hume, facts and values are completely
unconnected with another; we cannot (in his view) logically
reason our way from a fact to a conclusion about value. Just
because something is the case does not mean that it ought to be
the case. Mortal judgments, therefore do not deal with
empirically verifiable facts but rather are matters of sentiment
and emotion which are not subject to rational tests: we feel
what we feel. As Hume writes,

> “Moral distinctions [are] not deriv'd from reason.”40
> Since morals, therefore, have an influence on the actions
> and affections, it follows, that they cannot be deriv'd
> from reason; and that because reason alone, as we have
> already prov'd, can never have any such influence. Morals
> excite passions, and produce or prevent actions. Reason
> of itself is utterly impotent in this particular. The rules of
> morality. therefore, are not conclusions of our reason.41

By separating ethics and morality from reason, by showing
how we cannot derive values from facts, and by asserting that
values are fundamentally no more than emotional preferences,
Hume opened to door to an all pervasive relativism about
values. After all, how can we prove that anyone’s emotions are
better than anyone else’s? (Hume, of course believed that all
human beings had a similar emotional nature and would be
repelled by or attracted to similar things but that is a different
issue.) The message of Hume’s texts was clear: we cannot reason
about morals; our ethical choices are simply the expression of
emotions and sentiments and the idea of rationally‘ proving’
our moral choices right was simply absurd.

Hume also contributed to the development of relativism is
his denial of causality, i.e. the belief that one object or event in
any way creates a subsequent event:

> In reality, there is no part of matter, that does ever, by its
> sensible qualities, discover any power or energy, or give us
> ground to imagine, that it could produce any thing, or be
> followed by any other object, which we could denominate
> its effect. Solidity, extension, motion; these qualities are
> all complete in themselves, and never point out any other

event which may result from them.42

In short, there is no causality but only succession. It takes
little reflection to realise that denying causality undermines the
entire project of explaining the world scientifically by reference
to causal forces. Scientists can still work with the concepts of
causality, but they must admit that their causal explanations are
ad hoc, assumed, adopted as a matter of faith without any
empirical or rational support. Thus, other, equally valid
viewpoints are possible and a ‘scientific’ explanation is only one
among many, equally valid competitors which are correct in
relation to their own explanatory principles and frameworks. In
other words, we see here a denial of foundationalism (causality
is not a sure foundation), universalism (causality works
everywhere) and objectivism (causality works regardless of how
we think).
4\.2 Immanuel Kant (1724-1804)

Immanuel Kant made two major contributions to the
development of modern relativism. The first, which Harre and
Krausz call the “constructivist insight”43 is the theory of
categories according to which our perceptions of the world do
not arrive in the form in which we actually experience them.
Rather they arrive as ‘raw data’ which the mind processes and
shapes by means of the categories which are the conditions on
which having an experience depends. “These categories therefore
are also fundamental concepts by which we think objects in
general for the phenomena, and have therefore a priori
objective validity”44 They organize raw data according to time,
space, causality, necessity, contingency, subsistence and
accidence among other things, that is, constitute, or create our
experience of the phenomenal world. Thus, our mind shapes or
constructs the raw data of our perceptions into a coherent
world which becomes the object of our experience. In short, we
construct our world, both as individuals and as collectives. It is
also follows clearly from Kant’s views, that the perceiving
subject cannot be taken as a mirror reflecting a pre-existing
reality, which is to say, the subject cannot access reality and
deliver accurate reports about it. Indeed, the subject is “an
obstacle to cognition”45 and cannot be trusted. Because we
cannot gain an Archimedean point from which to make
universally valid judgments of our various world-constructs, we
cannot distinguish true constructs from false. All are valid
relative to the principles by which they were constructed. This
also means that since reality is a human construct, there can be
no objective knowledge or representation of reality and that all

we have are various constructions or stories none of which is
privileged over others in terms of its truth value. This
ontological relativism in which all world constructs are equal
readily lends itself to a profound epistemological relativism that
challenges the scientific project of discovering the truth about
reality. It is impossible to discover the truth because there is no
one truth about anything. What we have here is the denial of
universalism,      objectivism     and     foundationalism     that
characterises relativist thought.

Kant’s second contribution to the development of modern
relativist thought are his antinomies, i.e. demonstrations of the
limitations of reason. He showed how with some questions
show equally possible but rationally contradictory results i.e.
demonstrate “discord and confusion produced by the conflict
of the laws (antinomy) of pure reason.”46 In other words, on
some subjects – the limitation of the universe in space and time;
the concept of a whole cosmos made of indivisible atoms; the
problem of freedom and causality; the existence of a necessarily
existing being – reason can come to opposite but equally
rational conclusions. There is simply no way to break the
deadlock. Thus, “reason makes us both believers and doubters at
once”47 leaving us with grounds to believe and disbelieve in God
and reason itself. This scepticism about reason makes it easy to
reject reason as the arbitrator among various world-constructs.
We can either become sceptics and doubt them all or relativists
and accept them all as being true in their own way.
4\.3 Frederich Nietzsche (1844 – 1900)

Frederich Nietzsche is the pivotal figure in the history of
modern relativism given his role as the chief source and
inspiration of postmodernism. Nietzsche’s special contribution
to modern relativism is his attack on the concepts of truth as
understood by most Europeans, as well as his attack on the
Greek conviction that reason and rationality could provide an
Archimedean standpoint from which to judge all statements,
beliefs and truth-claims. With ‘reason’ and ‘truth’ swept aside,
the way was open to open-mindedly examine standpoints and
explanations that were outlandishly different from their
European counterparts. Thus, his virulent scepticism about
science and logic made it possible for western thinkers to – at
least temporarily – abandon their usual standpoints and to
entertain others.

Nietzsche’s attack on reason and knowledge is plainly evident
when he writes, “Truth is the kind of error without which a

certain species of life could not live. The value of life is
ultimately decisive.”48 Here we observe that Nietzsche himself
has a standpoint – life and the enhancement of life – from which
he critiques knowledge and reason so vigorously that he slides
over into radical scepticism. For example, what is essential
about truth is not that it is true but that it serves life: “[t]he
criterion of truth resides in the enhancement of the feeling of
power.”49 (Later, with Rorty, ‘truth’ would be that which serves
“solidarity.”) Truth is not what is actually the case but what
meets our needs in the struggles of life – a view of truth that
also exemplifies subjectivism and which allows there to be as
many truths as there are individuals with needs. Elsewhere he
says that truth is “Inertia; that hypothesis which gives rise to
contentment; smallest expenditure of spiritual force.”50 In a
similar vein, he writes, “The biggest fable of all is the fable of
knowledge,”51 thereby expressing his doubts about the existence
of knowledge, something he had already done in The Birth of
Tragedy by calling science a myth.

> What, then, is truth? A mobile army of metaphors,
> metonyms, and anthropomorphisms—in short, a sum of
> human relations which have been enhanced, transposed,
> and embellished poetically and rhetorically, and which
> after long use seem firm, canonical, and obligatory to a
> people: truths are illusions about which one has forgotten
> that this is what they are; metaphors which are worn out
> and without sensuous power; coins which have lost their
> pictures and now matter only as metal, no longer as
> coins.52

Nietzsche’s radical attack also includes the idea that truth is
made, not iscovered, that the “will to truth”53 and the “will to
power”54 are one and the same.

> Will to truth is a making firm, a making true and durable,
> an abolition of the false character of things, a
> reinterpretation of it into beings. “Truth” is therefore not
> something there, that might be found or discovered – but
> something that must be created and that gives a name to a
> process, or rather to a will to overcome that has in itself
> no end – introducing truth as a processus in infinitum, and
> active determining – not a becoming conscious of
> something that is itself firm and determined. It is a word
> for the “will to power”. 55

It is fairly obvious that when truth is reduced to power, then, in
effect, we no longer have a belief in truth at all, especially since
every individual and/or culture makes his own truth. According

to Nietzsche, “There exists neither "spirit," nor reason, nor
thinking, nor consciousness, nor soul, nor will, nor truth: all are
fictions that are of no use.”56
Whether his position is best characterised as relativism – he still
adopts the viewpoint of ‘life’ enhancement as decisive – or
scepticism is a matter for further debate. Nietzsche also
influenced the development of modern relativism through his
doctrine of perspectivism, i.e. all truth-claims depend on a
particular perspective or standpoint. There is no neutral,
‘Archimedean point’ from which reality can be ‘objectively
observed.’ The unbiased, objective quest for truth as such is a
willow-the-wisp; every claim to know truth is an expression of
personal interest, of the will-to-power. According to Nietzsche,
“facts is precisely what there is not, only interpretations. We
cannot establish any fact "in itself": perhaps it is folly to want
to do such a thing.”57 Nietzsche accepted the consequence that
if interpretations are all we have, then we are unable to
determine which view is true or better in any way:

> The world with which you are concerned is false, i.e. it is
> not a fact but a fable and `approximation on the basis of a
> meagre sum of observations.; it is “in flux,” as something
> in a state of becoming, as a falsehood always changing but
> never getting near the truth: for – there is no “truth.”58

The ‘truth-game’ is not worth the candle.
4\.4 Jean-Francois Lyotard

Jean-Francois Lyotard (1924 – 1998), one of the premier
philosophers of the postmodern movement, is best known for
his book The Postmodern Condition which not only brought the
term ‘postmodern’ into common usage but also explicitly
established postmodernism as a relativist philosophy. This book
provides on of the most frequently quoted definitions of
postmodernism: “I define postmodern as incredulity toward
metanarratives.”59 By “metanarratives,” (also called “grand
narrative[s]”60), Lyotard means those ‘stories’ or intellectual
frameworks by which we interpret the world and our activities
and thereby provide meaning for the whole and give certain data
the status of being facts, truths or real knowledge. For example,
Marxism supplied revolutionaries around the world with a
metanarrative encompassing the behavior of matter i.e.
dialectical materialism, as well as the nature, direction and
future outcome of human history, i.e. historical materialism.
The Enlightenment metanarrative concerned the gradual
triumph of reason over irrationality and the progress of

humankind not only in scientific knowledge but also in the
progress towards rational freedom and a tolerant society. The
Bahá’í metanarrative is “progressive revelation” according to
which God sends successive Manifestations to guide humankind
through its evolutionary development.

All of these metanarratives offer a complete or total vision
by which all possible human action as well as other
metanarratives may be interpreted and/or judged and for this
reason Lyotard describes them as a “project of totalization.”61
The connotation of ‘totalitarian’ is fully intended by Lyotard
who even describes metanarratives as “terrorist”62 because they
can be used to “eliminate[] or threaten[] to eliminate, a player
[point of view, culture] from the language game one shares with
them.”63 In the terms provided by Harre and Krausz,
metanarratives are universalist, i.e. applying to all peoples at all
times and places, they are objective and foundational.

One of the tasks of a metanarrative is the “legitimation of
knowledge,”64 which is to say that the metanarrative provides
the foundational principles by which to distinguish ‘real
knowledge’ or objective knowledge from error, folklore, myth
or the babblings of the insane. Thus, the metanarrative becomes
the gatekeeper of knowledge – and, by extension, the guardian
of crucial binary oppositions necessary for a system of thought
or social system to maintain itself. Examples of such binary
oppositions are order / disorder; sane / insane; noumenal /
phenomenal; true / untrue; primitive / civilized; competent /
incompetent; knowledge / superstition; and rational /
irrational. By means of these oppositions, metanarratives take
on a prescriptive function not only for individuals but for
entire societies who must conduct themselves personally and/or
collectively to its standards which are enforced not just by
institutions but by all those who accept the metanarrative.
Lyotard (like Foucault) of course believes this prescriptive
function imprisons us and the “incredulity toward
metanarratives”65 is a means of freeing ourselves from their
rule. For Lyotard, this means freeing ourselves from modernity
which “is identified with modern reason, Enlightenment,
totalizing thought and philosophies of history.”66 Lyotard
“rejects notions of universalist and foundational theory as well
as claims that one method or set of concepts has privileged
status.”67 He also rejects the notion that one metanarrative is
more objectively true than the rest.

Metanarratives can only be evaluated on their own terms and
within the context they provide; we must not import concepts

or procedures from other metanarratives to appraise other
metanarratives. Like Kuhn’s paradigms, metanarratives are
incommensurable, each one being a universe to itself, and
therefore, each one can be assessed only in relationship to itself.
There is no objective, universally valid and necessary or
foundational Archimedean point from which to judge.
4\.5 Jacques Derrida

Jacques Derrida (1930 – 2004) is the originator of
deconstructionism, perhaps the most influential version of
postmodernist philosophy developed so far. According to
Jonathan Culler, one of deconstruction’s foremost expositors

> To deconstruct a discourse [text] is to show how it
> undermines the philosophy it asserts, or the hierarchical
> oppositions on which it relies by identifying in the text the
> rhetorical operations that produce the supposed ground of
> argument, the key concept or premise.68 It is important to
> note that this subversion occurs from within. As Derrida
> says, The movements of deconstruction do not destroy
> structures from the outside. They are not possible and
> effective nor can they take accurate aim except by
> inhabiting those structures ... Operating necessarily from
> the inside, borrowing all the strategic and economic
> resources of subversion from the old structure ... 69

The text subverts or works against itself through its choice
of words and phrases, the ambiguity of some words and phrases,
rhetorical devices and/or imagery. Perhaps the best known
example of this procedure is “Plato’s Pharmacy,” in which
Derrida explores Plato’s “”Phaedrus”:

> The word pharmakon [remedy] is caught in a chain of
> significations. The play of that chain seems systematic.
> But the system here is not, simply, that of the intentions
> of an author who goes by the name of Plato.70

However, as Derrida points out, pharmakon means not only
‘remedy’ but also ‘poison’ not to mention ‘spell’ or ‘drug’ (as in
hallucinogen) and this “chain of significations” serves to
destabilise any simplistic, final or so-called objective
interpretation of the text. Writing, which Thoth had introduced
as a remedy for humankind’s poor memory, is also a ‘poison’
that weakens memory, and may cast a ‘spell’ over us by making
us think we have understood an idea when we have not.

If the pharmakon is “ambivalent,” it is because it constitutes

the medium in which opposites are opposed, the movement and
the play that links them among themselves,

> reverses them or makes one side cross over into the other
> (body / soul, good / evil, inside / outside, memory /
> forgetfulness, speech / writing, etc)... The pharmakon is
> the movement, the locus and the play: (the production of)
> difference.71

Each reading of ‘pharmacy’ evokes another, often contrary
meaning; we recognize the difference (observe the spelling)
between ‘remedy’ and ‘poison’ and in choosing one even if only
for a moment, we ‘defer’ the other meanings which, despite
being deferred, help complete our understanding of the text.
These other meanings are referred to as ‘supplements,’72 This
process of recognizing difference and deferring Derrida calls
differance’ and in his view every text is an endless play of
‘differance’as we defer, or momentarily push into the
background, the meanings of various words. Each of these
deferred meanings helps complete the full meaning of a word
and for that reason, “The play of the supplement is indefinite.”73
Derrida makes the same point by stating that “writing
structurally carries within itself (counts-discounts) the process
of its own erasure and annulation...”74 By “erasure” Derrida
does not mean that one meaning of a word is absolutely
excluded but rather that we read a word with awareness of all its
other potential meanings instead of privileging one, usually
conventional, meaning over all the others. We read the word
with all of its meanings, aware of the ambiguity this causes in
our understanding of the text itself.

It takes only minimal reflection to see how Derrida’s
deconstructionism supports relativism. If, as Derrida asserts the
play of differance (note spelling) and supplement is
“indefinite,” then it follows logically the no interpretation can
be foundational – since opposite readings are possible as we
have already seen in “Plato’s Pharmacy.” Furthermore, no
interpretation can be objective since there is no standpoint
from which we can see the text ‘as it really is.’ Of course, no
interpretation can be universal simply because any claims to
universality are challenged by the existence of other, possibly
contradictory interpretations. Finally, interpretations can only
change – there is no progress from one to the next.

Derrida’s deconstruction provides relativism with a
particularly potent method of attack – each interpretation is
shown to fail on its own terms, shown to undermine itself and
lead to its opposite. This (apparently) undercuts any attempt to

assert the existence of an absolute, i.e. of a proposition
claiming objectivity, universality and foundationalism. With
this method (it is a method Derrida’s objections
notwithstanding) relativism can go on the offensive against all
absolutist claims.
4\.6 Michel Foucault (1926 – 1984)

Like Jacques Derrida, Michel Foucault has been enormously
influential in fields outside of his specialities of philosophy and
social history. His writings cover such diverse topics as the
social construction of madness75 and sexuality76, methods in
historiography77, penology78, the nature of power and discourse.
He has had an incalculable effect on cultural studies, political
theory, feminism and sociology.79 While there may be some
debate about whether or not Foucault is really postmodernist,80
there is no debate about his standing as a thorough-going
relativist.

Like Lyotard, Foucault rejects the concept of “grand
narratives”, i.e. he does not believe that any global meta-
narrative can explain all aspects of a civilization. He writes,

> the theme and possibility of a total history begins to
> disappear ... The project of a total history is one that seeks
> to reconstitute the overall form of a civilization, the
> principle – material or spiritual – of a society, the
> significance common to all the phenomena of a period, the
> law that accounts for their cohesion ...81

Rather, he proposes what he calls “the new history”82 which pays
more attention to “discontinuity”83, to the “series, divisions,
limits, differences of level, shifts, chronological specificities,
particular forms of rehandling, possible types of relation.”84
Just as Derrida proclaims the necessity of subverting any
authoritative reading of a text, Foucault believes that “the
tranquility with which they [the usual historical narratives
driven by grand themes] are received must be disturbed”85 by
renounc[ing] all those themes whose function is to ensure
infinite continuity of discourse.”86 Historical discourse must be
broken up into what Lyotard calls “little narratives” or petits
recits because only when the glossed over differences become
apparent will new fields of research be visible and available for
investigation. We will become aware of discrepancies and
differences that have been covered up by large sweeping
unifying concepts and no longer lose sight of subtle but
important shifts in meaning and usage. Each concept, person
and event must be understood in terms of its exact specificity

in time, place and culture. There are no bridges between
epistemes.87

Thus, Foucault’s historiography not only stresses breaks and
discontinuities rather than grand similarities, changes in ideas
and practices rather than extended homogeneities, but also what
he calls the “episteme” which is the ‘soil’ from which
‘vegetation’ of ideas, behaviors, experiences, customs and
beliefs grows; it makes all these things possible and, at the same
time, establishes their character and limitations. Epistemes are
“the fundamental codes of a culture.”88 According to Foucault,
an episteme

> in a given period delimits in the totality of the experience
> a field of knowledge, defines the mode of being of the
> objects that appear in the field, provides man’s everyday
> perception with theoretical powers, and defines the
> conditions in which he can sustain a discourse about things
that is recognised to be true.89

Thus, an episteme determines truth, meaning, identity, value
and reality at a specific time and place. People need not even be
consciously aware of the episteme or its power in their lives
though it creates the environment or context in which
individuals think and speak; it controls what can be said and
understood as meaningful. Great social, cultural and intellectual
changes are the result of changes in the underlying episteme.
Archaeologies study these epistemes strictly for themselves
without drawing any universal conclusions about ‘humankind’
or other epistemes.

For our purposes, it sis clear that Foucault’s theory of
epistemes disallows an universalist claims, any foundational
claims and any objectivity claims by any episteme. All
episteme’s are just interpretations with none possessing primacy
in any way. This includes the episteme of western science and
particularly, that of medicine. Because episteme’s are
incommensurable (like Kuhn’s paradigms) there is no progress
from one to the other but only change.

5\. Richard R orty (1931 – 2007)

Richard Rorty is one of the most influential philosophers in
contemporary North America, Though relativism is a label he
strenuously rejects, as we shall see, his denials are not very
convincing. He attempts to distinguish his views from
relativism by saying , “[T]here is a difference between saying
that every community is as good as every other and saying that

we have to work out from the networks we are, from the
communities with which we presently identify.”90 After
admitting that relativism is logically self-refuting, he clearly
identifies his own position with the latter, supposedly non-
relativistic view. To prove that he does not think all views are
equally good, he asserts that a pragmatist like himself “thinks his
views are better than the ‘realists,’ but he does not think his
views correspond to the nature of things.”91 Basically, he thinks
his views are better because he is a “liberal” and, therefore,
“more afraid of being cruel than anything else.”92

Rorty’s denials notwithstanding, it is difficult to take his
claim that he is not a relativist at face value. Given his belief
that statements cannot correspond to reality (and, therefore
cannot be tested by reality), that rationality is simply a local
cultural bias without general validity and that truth itself is a
chimera, on what ground other than sheer dogmatic assertion
can he claim that his philosophy is better? (Unless of course he
relies on revelation which he does not.) He is also prepared to
give up the quest for truth: “A scientist would rely on a sense of
solidarity with the rest of her profession, rather than picture
herself as battling through the veils of illusion, guided by the
light of reason.”93 If language games are incommensurable, if
there is no rational or empirical way of ‘proving’ one view or
another, then the alleged superiority of one view comes down to
a dogmatic assertion of preference, i.e. of Nietzsche’s will-to-
power. He wants to replace the whole idea of truth “with the
desire for solidarity with that community”94 In other words, he
has replaced the quest for knowledge and truth with the ‘politics
of knowledge’, i.e. the quest for consensus and solidarity. Most
tellingly however, Rorty is unable to justify his beliefs in these
reformed goals with anything more than a plea for us to
recognise that his is a nicer way than its

the supposed alternatives. In the last analysis Rorty’s
liberalism has nothing more than his preference to recommend
it. Ironically, it is precisely such dogmatic assertion that his
much recommended “edifying conversation” is supposed to
replace. Judged by his own standards, Rorty’s views exemplify a
thorough-going, i.e. radical relativism both in epistemology and
ethics.

6 General Problem s With Rel ativism

Before specifically examining relativism in regards to the
Bahá’í Writings, we shall examine five serious philosophical
problems with relativism.

The first of these problems is that if relativism is true, then it
is impossible for anyone or any society/culture to be in error.
Even if we show that a view lacks self-consistency, a relativist
might claim it is simply our view that consistency is a
requirement for viable positions. The problem with this
necessary conclusion of relativism is that it is so contrary to our
experience: we humans make all kinds of small and momentous
mistakes on an on-going basis, and these mistakes indicate that
at least for some things, there is a right and a wrong way, or
more or less effective or efficient way. Moreover, some
contentions are simply untrue: Franklin Roosevelt was not the
dictator of the Soviet Union during the Great Terror of the
1930’s95.

The second problem and largest group of problems is that
relativism is self-undermining and self-refutation. The
statement “all truth is relative” is either absolutely true or it is
relatively true. If the first, then it refutes itself because it is an
example of an absolute truth. If it is relatively true, it
undermines itself – because that opens the possibility that at
least some truths might be absolute. The same type of problems
faces the proposition that we cannot know anything for sure,
i.e. there can be no certain knowledge. If we can know that
proposition for sure, then it refutes itself, and if we can’t, then
it is possible that we can know something for sure after all. The
same problem bedevils the claim that there are no absolute
truths. If this claim is meant absolutely it refutes itself, and if it
is not meant absolutely, then at least some claims may be
absolutely true. The same problem undermines the claim that
there are no neutral standards of truth as well as the How could
one prove this except by implicitly appealing a neutral standard,
an Archimedean point above and beyond our perceptions? In
short, relativism is a dogmatic assertion, not a provable
contention.

The theories of Derrida, Foucault, and Lyotard illustrate the
self-undermining and self-refuting problems of relativism.
According to Derrida, no interpretation of data can be
“privileged” over any other – yet this interpretation of the data
about literature, history and the like is itself an interpretation
subject to further deconstruction to show the opposite, i.e. that
some interpretations are “privileged.” Furthermore, this
interpretation “privileges” itself by claiming universal validity
for all possible interpretations. Similarly, Foucault declares that
epistemes are incommensurable, i.e. that there is no neutral or
objective Archimedean point from which we can judge between
conflicting epistemes (or Kuhn’s paradigms). However, that

judgment itself is only possible if we implicitly assume that we
have a neutral standpoint that allows us to judge all other
standpoints. In other words, Foucault “privileges” itself.
Lyotard of course, has the same problem. The declaration that
there can be no “grand narratives” drawing universal
conclusions about history is a universal statement about
history, and thus refutes itself. These serious problems in the
arguments of major philosophers, make it clear that it is
impossible to develop a version of relativism that does not
undermine and refute itself. Without that there is no reason –
other than dogmatic assertion – to be convinced by it.

The third problem also concerns the declaration there are
different truths: what’s true for you is not true for me. In other
words, there are no universal, foundational and objective
truths. But this is highly counter-intuitive. Can any human
being imagine a context in which things do not exist? Even if
the whole world is an illusion, or even a mental delusion, then
things exist albeit not in the usual way. This, of course, was
Augustine’s96 and Descartes’97 great philosophical discovery: the
illusory manner of existence of things cannot undo the fact that
they do, in fact, exist. Nothing that we can think of can be
denied ‘being.’ In other words, the concept of ‘being’ can
provide an objective, universal, foundational which is to say,
Archimedean standpoint on which to begin our thinking. Most
important for our purposes is the fact that `Abdu'l-Bahá agrees
with this position:

> This theory [ that the external world is an illusion, is
> nothingness] is erroneous; for though the existence of
> beings in relation to the existence of God is an illusion,
> nevertheless, in the condition of being it has a real and
> certain existence. It is futile to deny this.98

In other words, even illusions exist – as illusions but that is
enough to give “a real and certain existence.” At first, this may
not sound promising, but anyone familiar with the works of
Thomas Aquinas and his successors in modern neo-Thomism will
know how much can be built on this.99

The fourth problem with relativism is existential and ethical,
not logical. It is difficult to accept the suggestion that the self-
sacrifice of a Mother Theresa and the actions of a Dr.
Mengele100 are morally equal and that our condemnation of one
and admiration for the other are simply expressions of personal
taste and preference. Who, other than a psychopath or a
“wrangler,” a person who argues for arguing’s sake, would
contend that the actions of these two are morally on par?

Intellectually it may be possible to do so, but who, except a
psychiatrically disturbed person would aspire to actually follow
in Mengele’s footsteps – or want a child to do so? Applied to
law, the impracticality of relativism is just as glaring. Imagine a
lawyer defending a serial killer on the ground that his client’s
view that murder is a fine hobby is just as valid as society’s view
that it’s a heinous crime! Such a defence would rightly be
laughed out of court. In other words, relativism has a fatal
existential weakness: we can talk the talk but don’t want anyone
to walk the walk.

The fifth problem of relativism concerns its implicit
anthropology, viz., its denial of a universal, objective and
foundational human nature. If there is no human nature and
humankind is infinitely malleable by environmental and social
forces, then there can be no truth about human beings as such
and therefore, no basis for a universal human moral code or a
universal code of law such as the declaration of human rights,
or a world-unifying religion or any basis for the unification of
humankind. There is diversity but no unity. Such a view,
promulgated by Boas, Benedict and Mead to name only the best
known, suffers from two weaknesses. First, the human body,
although subject to some minor variations is universally alike,
and this includes brain functions. The body and the brain thus
represents an objective, measurable substratum which
constrains, shapes, and directs human responses to
environmental and social influences. In short, human
physiological functions – including brain functions – are
universal. This is the physical basis for the unity of humankind.
Second, contemporary anthropological studies such as Donald E
Brown’s Human Universals (as well as various successors) show
that there exist well over one hundred101 universal human traits
such as facial expressions for happiness, fear , disgust and anger
(basic emotions); anthropomorphization; use of metaphors and
metonymies; systems of taxonomy; systems of counting; rituals
and the self distinguished from others. In other words, there is a
basic human nature which pre-disposes human beings to deal
with the world and ourselves in similar ways.

7\. Th e Bahá’í Writin gs an d An thr opology

The Bahá’í Writings do not agree that there is no such thing
as human nature. The first line of evidence in this regard are the
passing references to human nature in the writings of `Abdu'l-
Bahá. These passing references show that who remarks, the
Master takes the existence of human nature for granted, as a
given, self-evident fact. For example that the abuse of religion

makes “that which was a factor in the sublimity of human
nature” into an instrument for its “degradation.”102 He tells us
that “divine philosophy”

> has for its object the sublimation of human nature,
> spiritual advancement, heavenly guidance for the
> development of the human race, attainment to the breaths
> of the Holy Spirit and knowledge of the verities of God-103
He tells us that Christ’s disciples

> were delivered from the animal characteristics and qualities
> which are the characteristics of human nature, and they
> became qualified with the divine characteristics ...104

None of these statements would make sense if there were no
such thing as human nature.

The Writings also tell us a great deal about human nature,
that is, they identify certain human traits and/or
predispositions as universal, objective and foundational. For
example, “his [man’s] nature is threefold: animal, human and
divine. The animal nature is darkness; the heavenly is light in
light.”105 In other words, human nature is constituted by animal
capacities or potentials, specifically human capacities or
potentials and divine capacities or potentials. Sometimes these
divine capacities are called our “spiritual susceptibilities” which
must be awakened “in the hearts of mankind, to kindle anew the
spirit of humanity with divine fires and to reflect the glory of
heaven to this gloomy world of materialism.”106 The specifically
human capacity or potential is our abstract reasoning power:

> The human spirit which distinguishes man from the animal
> is the rational soul, and these two names--the human spirit
> and the rational soul--designate one thing. This spirit,
> which in the terminology of the philosophers is the
> rational soul, embraces all beings, and as far as human
> ability permits discovers the realities of things and
> becomes cognizant of their peculiarities and effects, and
> of the qualities and properties of beings.107

The animal capacities, of course, are based on humankind’s
bodily needs as well as its instinctual nature. Speaking
specifically in regards to morality, `Abdu'l-Bahá says that our
moral nature is constituted by two capacities, a lower and a
higher:

> In man there are two natures; his spiritual or higher nature
> and his material or lower nature. In one he approaches

> God, in the other he lives for the world alone. Signs of
> both these natures are to be found in men. In his material
> aspect he expresses untruth, cruelty and injustice; all these
> are the outcome of his lower nature. The attributes of his
> Divine nature are shown forth in love, mercy, kindness,
> truth and justice, one and all being expressions of his
> higher nature. Every good habit, every noble quality
> belongs to man's spiritual nature, whereas all his
> imperfections and sinful actions are born of his material
> nature. If a man's Divine nature dominates his human
nature, we have a saint.108

A survey of the Writings indicates that the Writings accept
these attributes as universal, that is, applicable to all human
beings regardless of time and place; as objective, that is, as not
dependent on standpoint or, conversely, true from all
standpoints; and foundational, that is, not susceptible to
further breakdown and analysis. In other words, the Writing’s
view of human nature is not relative.

The third line of reasoning that shows the Bahá’í Writings do
not have a relativist view of human nature can be found in
`Abdu'l-Bahá’s remarks about human evolution: “But from the
beginning of man's existence he is a distinct species”109 and “For
the proof of the originality of the human species, and of the
permanency of the nature of man, is clear and evident.”110 Here,
too, we observe, that humankind is credited with a nature that
makes it identifiable and “distinct”, in addition to being
permanent, that is, “his species and essence undergo no
change.”111 Thus, human nature has always been essentially what
it is, which is to say, universal in time in addition to universal in
space, i.e. planetary.

Finally, it is obvious why the Bahá’í Writings would insist on
the absoluteness of human nature: without this basis, its
teaching about the eventual unification of humankind into a
single global commonwealth would lack a proper foundation.
How could the human race be unified if all peoples did not have
something in common, if there were no objectively real,
foundational and universal capacity for rational thinking and
decision making, for actualizing “spiritual susceptibilities”, for
freeing themselves from ancestral imitations and for adopting a
global religion and loyalty? Indeed, the whole concept of
progressive revelation makes no sense since without a human
nature actualizing its latent potentialities, there would simply
be change and not progress. Progress requires that some things
change but also, that others are continuous since without such

continuity we could only say there is change. Whatever it is that
changes is foundational, as well as objective and universal.
Applied to man, this means, for example, that the historical
appearances of human rationality can vary from place to place
and time to time, but that the basic capacity for rationality
remains the same.

The Bahá’í Writings show that on the subject of human
nature they are not relativist.

8\. Sh oghi Effendi’s Statemen ts on Relativism

Superficially at least, some statements by Shoghi Effendi
appear to support the view that the Bahá’í Writings advocate
relativism. It is our contention that such is not actually the case.
Here is one of the Guardian’s statements:

> “The fundamental principle enunciated by Bahá'u'lláh ... is
> that religious truth is not absolute but relative, that
> Divine Revelation is a continuous and progressive process,
> that all the great religions of the world are divine in
> origin, that their basic principles are in complete harmony,
> that their aims and purposes are one and the same, that
> their teachings are but facets of one truth, that their
> functions are complementary, that they differ only in the
> nonessential aspects of their doctrines, and that their
> missions represent successive stages in the spiritual
> evolution of human society....”112

The statement that “religious truth is not absolute but
relative” cannot have its seemingly obvious meaning since that
would deny the statements that immediately follow about
revelation being a “continuous and progressive process,” that
“all the great religions are divine in origin,” that “they differ
only in nonessential aspects of their doctrines” and so on. These
claims – which are integral to the identity or essence of the
Bahá’í revelation – are obviously intended as absolute truths
which are foundational to the Bahá’í Faith, universal in scope
and objectively true. They are not relative statements in the
sense that their opposites are equally true or valid. In the
philosophy embedded in the Bahá’í Writings, deconstructing
these statements will not bring us to equally valid counter-
truths; the denial of these claims is simply false. There is,
moreover, no way a Bahá’í can reject any of them and/or accept
their opposites and remain consistent with Bahá’í teachings. Of
course Bahá’ís accept the fact that non-Bahá’ís may reject some
or all of these claims, but this is regarded as error, rooted in the

failure to take the next step in humankind’s religious evolution.

Just because we are all divine creations of God does not
mean that all our opinions and views are correct. As `Abdu'l-
Bahá’s says,

> The divine Manifestations have been iconoclastic in Their
> teachings, uprooting error, destroying false religious
> beliefs and summoning mankind anew to the fundamental
oneness of God.113

The fact that Manifestations have been “iconoclastic” means
that They have evaluated various truth claims, found them
wanting and swept them aside as erroneous. He also says,

> And shouldst destroy them which destroy the earth" means
> that He will entirely deprive the neglectful; for the
> blindness of the blind will be manifest, and the vision of
> the seers will be evident; the ignorance and want of
> knowledge of the people of error will be recognized, and
> the knowledge and wisdom of the people under guidance
> will be apparent ...114
In the words of Bahá'u'lláh:

> "Twelve hundred and eighty years have passed since the
> dawn of the Muhammadan Dispensation, and with every
> break of day, these blind and ignoble people have recited
> their Qur'an, and yet have failed to grasp one letter of
> that Book! Again and again they read those verses which
> clearly testify to the reality of these holy themes, and bear
> witness to the truth of the Manifestations of eternal
> Glory, and still apprehend not their purpose. They have
> even failed to realize, all this time, that, in every age, the
> reading of the scriptures and holy books is for no other
> purpose except to enable the reader to apprehend their
> meaning and unravel their innermost mysteries. Otherwise
> reading, without understanding, is of no abiding profit
> unto man.115
For his part, Shoghi Effendi writes,

> He [Bahá'u'lláh] insists on the unqualified recognition of
> the unity of their purpose, restates the eternal verities they
> enshrine, coordinates their functions, distinguishes the
> essential and the authentic from the nonessential and
> spurious in their teachings, separates the God-given truths
> from the priest-prompted superstitions116

Thus it is quite possible for God’s children to be blind and in
error. These statements undermines any assertion that the
Writings espouse a simple relativism which allows virtually any
viewpoint to claim validity by appealing to its own special
standpoint. Indeed, the whole concept of progressive revelation
means that that not all standpoints are valid for all times and
for all times, that religious history shows progress from one
standpoint to the next which is why each Manifestation brings
his own solutions.117

It almost goes without saying that any simplistic reading of
“religious truth is not absolute but relative” falls into the trap
of self-refutation and self-undermining. If this statement of
“religious truth” is meant to be taken absolutely, then it
obviously refutes itself by violating its own message. If,
however, it is meant to be only relatively true, then the door is
open to the possibility that at least some religious truth may be
absolute, that is, universal, objective and foundational. That
would defeat the entire purpose of the statement. Thus, there
are good logical reasons for rejecting any simplistic reading of
Shoghi Effendi’s declaration.

If Shoghi Effendi’s statement about religious truth being
relative cannot mean that religious truth is relative in the sense
of all possible viewpoints on an issue being equally valid, what
does it mean? If we read the Guardian’s entire statement, we
find that it discusses progressive revelation, the historical
changes of presentation undergone by their essentially unified
principles. In other words, what changes are the surface,
historical, phenomenal forms of the divine teachings but the
essential teachings remain the same. In other words, what
changes and is relative is the adapted, phenomenal form of
religions but not the “eternal verities they enshrine,”118 which
are true for all time i.e., under all conditions past and future
and for all humans, or, in philosophical terms, they are
universal, objective and foundational.

From this we conclude that relativism does not apply to the
“eternal verities”(universal, objective and foundational) but
only to the way they may be expressed outwardly, or
historically. Because they are “eternal,” they are absolute, i.e.
true independently of the standpoint, beliefs, hopes and fears of
any individuals or collectives. (Though they are true
independently of all standpoints, this does not prevent some
from denying them for reasons of their own.) The historical or,
as we may call it, outer, worldly, existential expression of the
infinite potentials inherent in the “eternal verities” is what

varies, and not the essential teachings or the “eternal verities”
themselves. These remain constant and actualise their
implications for humankind through our evolution. It is
obvious, of course, that the Bahá’í model of absolute, essential
and constant truths given various existential expressions
throughout human history cannot be accommodated by a
concept of relativism according to which no perspective is
essential or foundational, no concept is universal or applicable
to all peoples at all times and no concept is objective, or true
for all standpoints. Moreover, in violation of relativism, the
Bahá’í Faith “distinguishes the essential and the authentic from
the nonessential and spurious in their teachings, separates the
God-given truths from the priest-prompted superstitions.”119
Making these distinctions assumes that there is an Archimedean
standpoint from which such judgments can be made – a notion
flatly denied by relativism. Another aspect is that the Bahá’í
model accepts the possibility that some views are simply
erroneous. Such assertions are irreconcilable with any form of
relativism.

Although the Bahá’í position is not relativist but absolutist
on some issues – Bahá'u'lláh is the Manifestation for this age,
that HIV is related to AIDS – it rejects as contrary to the
doctrine of progressive revelation the absolutist suggestion that
religious truth is revealed once and for all in full by any
Manifestation. In regards to epistemology, the Bahá’í position
may be described as ‘evolutionary Platonic perspectivism.’ The
reason for calling it ‘Platonic’ is because there are “eternal
verities” which obviously do not change and are true from all
possible standpoints (unless one chooses to be deceived, but
that is a different issue). Because they are eternal and
unchanging, they resemble the Platonic ideas’ insofar as they are
absolutely universal, objective and foundational: “This is the
changeless Faith of God, eternal in the past, eternal in the
future.”120 Of course, it is evident that we do, in fact, have
some knowledge of these “eternal verities” or other absolute
truths but what and how much we know depends on our
perspective or standpoint in history, on our spiritual, social,
cultural development and what we learn from the
Manifestations throughout human evolution. Thus, throughout
history, we attain partial glimpses of the essential truths, the
“eternal verities” as their various previously hidden potentials
become known to us. That is why this position is described as
evolutionary and perspectivist.

It is important that we not confuse and conflate ‘partial’
knowledge with ‘incorrect’ knowledge. If we only know plane

geometry, our knowledge of geometry is partial, but what we
know about it is certainly correct: the interior angles of any
plane triangle have always added up to 180 degrees and we have
no reason to expect a change; Roosevelt was not the Soviet
dictator during the Great Terror. In a more directly Bahá’í
context, we know that Bahá'u'lláh is the Manifestation for this
age, but we have not by any means discovered all the
implications of that fact. Moreover, because the Bahá’í Faith
has privileged, divinely appointed interpreters who occupy an
Archimedean standpoint, it is possible to know that certain
religious and philosophical claims are correct, though not fully
understood by us.

Moreover, the existence of privileged interpreters also allows
us to rule out particular perspectives and claims as untenable.
For example, `Abdu'l-Bahá makes it clear that a materialist
approach to science and reality is inadequate121 and that
pantheism122 and reincarnation123 are untrue beliefs. This limits
and constrains how Bahá’ís may understand the Writings, i.e.
these perspectives are ruled out of bounds. On the positive side,
“although human souls are phenomenal, they are nevertheless
immortal, everlasting and perpetual.”124 This truth, however
partial or perspectival our understanding of it may be, is
nonetheless true universally i.e. from all perspectives,
foundationally and objectively. A contrary perspective is simply
an error, both in the factual sense and existentially insofar as it
contributes to human “degradation.”125

9\. Rel ativism versus R elationalism 126

Whereas in regards to epistemology, the Bahá’í position may
be described as ‘evolutionary Platonic perspectivism,’ in regards
to ontology, i.e. the theory of reality, it is best described as
‘relationalism.’ Relationalism is based on the belief that all
things exist in relationship to one another,

> For all beings are connected together like a chain; and
> reciprocal help, assistance and interaction belonging to the
> properties of things are the causes of the existence,
> development and growth of created beings.127

Speaking specifically of humankind, the Master says, the
existence and perfection of humankind

> is due to the composition of the elements, to their
> measure, to their balance, to the mode of their
> combination, and to mutual influence. When all these are
> gathered together, then man exists.128

In other words, things exist relationally to each other, but
this must not be confused with ontological relativism according
to which

> What exists for human beings is relative to the concepts
> they possess and the procedures of enquiry with which
> their culture equips them ... Ontological relativists are not
> saying that it is just what people believe exists [that would
> bring us back to epistemological relativism] that varies
> from culture to culture, but something much stronger,
> that what exists can only be said to exist for this or that
culture.129

The logical consequence of this immediately makes its
untenability clear: what we don’t know doesn’t exist – and,
therefore, according to this view, shouldn’t be able to hurt us.
But we know this is false. The world’s Aboriginal Peoples, for
example, who knew neither gunpowder nor measles and had no
concept of either, were very seriously hurt by both. Here we
have historical proof that either individual or collective human
perception does not constitute reality, that regardless of how
we may constitute reality, factors not included in our
construction may well be at work and able to affect us whether
we recognise them or not.

Let us examine relationalism more closely. Unlike any form
of relativism, it does not mean that there are standpoints from
which real relationships can be validly denied and said not to
exist. Doing that would make the nature of reality itself
dependent on the perceiver – which is a form of ontological
relativism. For relationalism, relationships are real whether or
not they are perceived by anyone; for example, the relationship
between fire and gunpowder has always been such that one
should be extremely careful introducing them to each other. In
other words, relationalism is a form of ontological realism, i.e.
the belief that reality is independent of our ontological
conceptions and schemes. Relationalism recognises that because
things exist in relationship to one another, they may exhibit
different characteristics in regards to different things. Indeed,
they can even display opposite attributes with different thing.
Sea water, for example, allows ocean plants to thrive whereas it
kills land plants. Exercise that may be valuable stimulation for
one person’s heart may kill another person. However, it is
important to realise that relationalism still allows us to say that
certain statements are absolutely true, e.g. that sea water is
deadly for daisies, that there is no viewpoint from which this is
not true. We may not completely understand all the details

about why this is true, but the assertion of the opposite is
simply false. Thus, relationalism is able to retain the concept of
truth and of distinguishing among a wildering wilderness of
images/perspectives. It is able to accommodate the idea that at
least some statements are universal, objective and foundational,
and that others are in error.

Thus, it is plain that relationalism and relativism are not the
same and must not be confused and conflated. The Bahá’í
Writings are relationalist and not relativist.

Let us observe relationalism in the following statement by
`Abdu'l-Bahá’:

> This dust beneath our feet, as compared with our being, is
> nonexistent. When the human body crumbles into dust, we
> can say it has become nonexistent; therefore, its dust in
> relation to living forms living forms of human being is as
> nonexistent, but in its own sphere it is existent, it has its
> mineral being. Therefore, it is well proved that absolute
nonexistence is impossible; it is only relative.130

The statement says that in its relationship to human being,
dust is non-existent although, “in its own sphere”, in
relationship to itself, dust exists. It is important to notice that
it is not merely a matter of opinion whether or not dust is dead
in relationship to or relative to the human being – this is
presented as an ontological fact. There is no cognitive
relativism about this; no matter what standpoint we choose to
observe this fact, it will be the same, i.e. it is universal,
objective and foundational. From this example, `Abdu'l-Bahá’
draws a general conclusion: “absolute non-existence” does not
exist, “it [non-existence] is “only relative.” Here, too, we have a
universal claim that is not standpoint dependent but is offered
as a principle of universal ontology. That our understanding of
this principle will grow and expand throughout our
evolutionary history is not in question, but the basic insight
reflects an abiding truth on which we have one true perspective.
This brings us back to the ‘evolutionary Platonic perspectivism’
where we may get various successive perspectives on the
“eternal verities” or unchallengeably true propositions, as, for
example that “nonexistence is only relative and absolute
nonexistence inconceivable.”131 Nonexistence is always non-
existence in relationship to something and existence is always
existence in relationship to something.

What follows is another statement which illustrates the
difference between relationalism and relativism:

> Therefore, though the world of contingency exists, in
> relation to the existence of God it is nonexistent and
> nothingness. Man and dust both exist, but how great the
> difference between the existence of the mineral and that
> of man! The one in relation to the other is nonexistence.
> In the same way, the existence of creation in relation to
> the existence of God is nonexistence. Thus it is evident
> and clear that although the beings exist, in relation to God
and to the Word of God they are nonexistent.132

Again we observe that in these statements the attributes of
existence and nonexistence are not simply matters of opinion or
viewpoint in the relativistic sense of our being able to hold the
opposite view with equal validity. There is, for example, no
standpoint from which creation is not contingent and
dependent upon God, nor is there a standpoint from which God
Himself depends on creation. (This should not be confused with
the claim that humans may devise various concepts of God; the
concepts, but not God Himself are dependent on man.) This is
true even of the “First Mind” or “First Will”: “for the existence
of the universal reality in relation to the existence of God is
nothingness.”133 This ontological principle also applies at the
most humble level” “the life of the nail in relation to the life of
the eye is nonexistent.”134 The failure to adequately consider the
relational nature of existence causes some thinkers to conclude
that the world is an illusion

> This theory [that the external world is an illusion, is
> nothingness] is erroneous; for though the existence of
> beings in relation to the existence of God is an illusion,
> nevertheless, in the condition of being it has a real and
certain existence. It is futile to deny this.135

Aside from the characterization of a particular view as
“erroneous” – which implicitly denies epistemological relativism
– this passage shows that things are involved in two kinds of
relationship, a relationship to others or not-self (in this
example, God) and a relationship to itself, its own “condition of
being.” All things thus have a double nature; more importantly
they can have apparently opposite attributes in different
relationships. Furthermore, each of these relationships is
absolutely true and not relative. In respect to God, the world
does not exist – and there is no alternative standpoint from
which to validly assert the opposite. In regards to itself, the
world exists – and as Augustine and Descartes know, there is no
logically defensible standpoint from which to assert the
opposite. `Abdu'l-Bahá’s statement that it is “futile” to deny

what he says demonstrates the universal, objective and
foundational nature of his claim, and thereby illustrates a vital
difference between relationalism and relativism.

What follows is an application of relationalism to the human
soul after death.

> In the same way, the souls who are veiled from God,
> although they exist in this world and in the world after
> death, are, in comparison with the holy existence of the
> children of the Kingdom of God, nonexisting and
> separated from God.136

Here, too, we observe the double-relation: in regards to
themselves as well as the world and “the world after death”,
these veiled souls exist, but in regards to the “children of the
Kingdom”, they are nonexistent. Each statement is true, and not
subject to equally valid contradiction as it would be with
relativism; together these relations constitute the being of those
particular souls. There is no standpoint from which a soul could
be “separated from God” and still exist since that would assert
the independence of the created from the Creator. Nor is there
any standpoint that could validly assert the nonexistence of a
soul “in the world and the world after death” while still existing
for God, because that would be to declare the world more
powerful than God.

> Relationalism also applies to ethics according to `Abdu'l-Bahá,
> a scorpion is evil in relation to man; a serpent is evil in
> relation to man; but in relation to themselves they are not
> evil ... The epitome of this discourse is that it is possible
> that one thing in relation to another may be evil, and at
> the same time within the limits of its proper being it may
> not be evil. Then it is proved that there is no evil in
> existence; all that God created He created good. This evil
> is nothingness; so death is the absence of life.137

Once again, we note how the relationship to not-self/other is
distinguished from relationship to self along with the assertion
that nothing is evil “within the limits of its proper being.”138
This relationship to itself is the ontological foundation for the
teaching that God’s creation is good; all things are good in and
of themselves. In addition, this passage also reinforces the
distinction between relationalism and relativism because there is
no standpoint from which we may correctly say that the
scorpion is evil in regards to itself because that would be to
deny the inherent goodness of God’s creation. In other words,

we know this truth from a privileged standpoint from which we
may reject the contrary view as false.

> Similar thinking applies to morality as well. `Abdu'l-Bahá says,
> The sin in Adam is relative to His position. Although from
> this attachment there proceed results, nevertheless,
> attachment to the earthly world, in relation to attachment
> to the spiritual world, is considered as a sin. The good
deeds of the righteous are the sins of the Near Ones.139

This statement exemplifies relationalism not relativism
because it is not a matter of questioning Adam’s sin – which is
flatly asserted to be sin and not subject to contrary perspectives
according to which it is not – but only that what is factually a
sin in relationship to Adam is not necessarily a sin in
relationship to other beings. This is consistent with
relationalism because, as already explained, an entity may
exhibit different qualities in relationship to different things
because it interacts differently with each. Thus, what is good in
the “righteous” is “sin” for the “Near Ones.” The statement that
“The good deeds of the righteous are the sins of the Near Ones”
is not dependent on perspective but is offered as a truth that is
universal, objective and foundational. There is no perspective
that could prove `Abdu'l-Bahá wrong.

Another example of relationalism can be found in The Seven
Valleys and The Four Valleys:

> Although a brief example hath been given concerning the
> beginning and ending of the relative world, the world of
> attributes, yet a second illustration is now added, that the
> full meaning may be manifest. For instance, let thine
> Eminence consider his own self; thou art first in relation
to thy son, last in relation to thy father.140

Here, too, we find no suggestion that the claim “thou art
first in relation to they son, last in relation to thy father” is
subject to equally valid contradictory claim, which is to say that
this statement is universally, objectively and foundationally
true. In other words, this statement implicitly assumes there
exists a neutral, Archimedean standpoint from which its claim
can be made, thereby ruling it out of consideration as an
example of relativism.

The passage goes on to declare that “first” and “last” as well
as “outward appearance” and “inward being” are “four states”
that are “true of thyself.” 141 If we allowed a truly relativistic
reading instead of a perspectivist reading, the truth of this

passage would no longer be universalist, objectivist and
foundational – and thus would lose its value as a guide in the
quest for religious truth.

> Continuing this passage, we read,
> These statements are made in the sphere of that which is
> relative, because of the limitations of men. Otherwise,
> those personages who in a single step have passed over the
> world of the relative and the limited, and dwelt on the fair
> plane of the Absolute, and pitched their tent in the worlds
> of authority and command--have burned away these
> relativities with a single spark, and blotted out these words
> with a drop of dew. And they swim in the sea of the spirit,
> and soar in the holy air of light. Then what life have
> words, on such a plane, that "first" and "last" or other than
> these be seen or mentioned! In this realm, the first is the
> last itself, and the last is but the first.142

Here Bahá'u'lláh reminds us that we live on a “relative”
ontological plane where everything exists in relation to other
things and thus suffer the problem of being limited by
particular perspectives i.e. relating to one thing in one way and
to something else in another. However, it is possible to surpass
this relational plane – to “burn[] away these relativities,” to
transcend the differences of words and attain a plane where
first and last are one and the same, i.e. where things do not exist
relationally as on this earthly plane. What precisely that mode
of existence is we are powerless to say because the words have
been blotted out “with a drop of dew.” We have reached the
limit of rationality. An adherent of philosophical relativism
must, of course, claim that this may be true from a particular
perspective but that the direct contrary view is equally possible
– and there is Archimedean standpoint from which to judge
between the alternatives. The problem is that nothing here
suggests this is what Bahá'u'lláh means.

10\. A Test Ca se 143

In his well-know article “Relativism: A Basis for Bahá’í
Metaphysics,” Moojan Momen claims that relativism can
reconcile ontological dualism and ontological monism. Writing
about ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s “Commentary on the Islamic Tradition: ‘I
Was a Hidden treasure,’ ” Momen contends that ‘Abdu’l-Bahá
adopts a relativist approach to achieve “a reconciliation of the
dichotomy”144 between an ontological dualism asserting that
“there is a fundamental difference between the human soul and

the Absolute”145 and an ontological monism stating that “there
is no fundamental difference between the human soul and the
Absolute.”146 The case of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s “Commentary” is
intended to be paradigmatic in solving the apparent problem
between the teaching of the essential unity of all religions and
humankind’s conflicting religious beliefs.

It is the contention of this paper that Momen’s use of
relativism as a solution to the monism/dualism conflict in the
Writings is a supposed ‘solution’ to a non-existent problem.
There is, as we shall see, no monist position in the Writings. But
is this really the case? After his exposition of both views,
‘Abdu’l-Bahá’ says,

> But to this servant all these expositions and questions,
> stations and states are complete in their own station
> without defect or flaw. For although the object being
> viewed is the same, nevertheless the viewpoints and
> stations of these mystic knowers is different. Each
> viewpoint, with respect to the person who is in that
station is perfect and complete.147

Analysis shows that ‘Abdu’l-Bahá strictly confines his
remarks to the subjective criteria for truth: given their own
presuppositions and criteria, the advocates of each viewpoint
reason correctly and attain a conclusion that is consistent with
their spiritual conditions as “knowers.” In other words, ‘Abdu’l-
Bahá’s argument is subjectively epistemological – concerned
with the “knowers” and not with what is objectively known and
the quality of their knowledge, with the perceiver and not with
the perceived. He is not talking about what actually is the case
but rather about what the viewer thinks is the case because of
his presuppositions, nature and spiritual condition. Once this
distinction is noted, it becomes clear that his judgment about
the two viewpoints has no ontological implications at all.148
Consequently, seeing ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s words as a relativist
reconciliation of ontological monism and dualism is to mistake
a rather studiously neutral statement about two kinds of
viewers for an endorsement of both their opinions.149 Such is
patently not the case. Momen quotes the following passage to
support his case for relativism:

> It is clear to thine Eminence that all the variations which
> the wayfarer in the stages of his journey beholdeth in the

While this passage certainly supports perspectivalism or
relationalism – there are many perspectives on or relations to
the sun and each of them originates with the wayfarer – this
passage clearly indicates that not all perspectives are equal: “in a
mirror it reflecteth its own disk and shape, and this is due to the
sensitivity of the mirror.” In other words, the mirror reflects
the sun more accurately, faithfully, adequately than in other
things which show “only the effect of its shining, but not its full
disk.” Each reflects “according to the quality of that thing” but
nowhere is it claimed that the quality is everywhere equal.
Indeed, in this very image Bahá'u'lláh suggests an Archimendean
standpoint from which to judge the reflections: the more one is
sensitive like a mirror, the more closely we will reflect the light,
“disk and shape” of the sun. This passage does not support a
relativist reading.

If Momen’s reading is correct, it would follow that ‘Abdu’l-
Bahá assumes that the spiritual condition, nature and
understanding of the believer are by themselves sufficient to
determine the objective correctness or truthfulness of a belief.
However, as we have shown with the foregoing passage, the
Writings do not espouse such a subjectivist theory of truth.151
If They did, they would be maintaining that standpoint and
spiritual condition is sufficient to establish objective
truthfulness – which in turn would prevent Them from
dismissing some beliefs as “vain imaginings,”152 “error,”153 and
“the lowest depths of ignorance and foolishness”154.

In attempting to prove that relativism can serve as the “basis
for a Baha’i metaphysics,” Momen endeavours to show how it
can resolve the conflict between monism and dualism by citing
apparently ‘monist’ passages in the Writings. Our contention is
that these passages are not monist at all. For example,
Bahá’u’lláh ’s injunction, “Turn thy sight unto thyself, that thou
mayest find Me standing within thee”155 is not really monist.
Because we can find God’s universal presence reflected in the

mirrors of our hearts156 does not mean that we have become
ontologically one with God’s Being. Moreover, this passage
maintains the distinction between the perceiver and the
perceived (God) – a fact which effectively precludes a monist
interpretation.

Another passage Momen quotes to support a monist
interpretation of the Writings is found in The Seven Valleys and
the Four Valleys. Some wayfarers behold various colors, but
“some have drunk of the wine of oneness and these see nothing
but the sun itself.”157 A careful reading of this passage shows
that its concern is epistemological – visionary – and not
ontological, it is about perceiving not about the being of that
which is perceived. To be ontologically monist, this passage
would have to assert that “the place of appearance”158 and the
sun itself are actually one, that the person who gazes is one with
what he gazes upon. However, this passage also preserves the
distinction between the perceiver and the perceived and,
therefore, cannot serve as an example of a monist tendency in
the Writings. Indeed, it is explicitly dualist.

The following is another passage quoted to support a monist
tendency in the Writings:159 “Yea, all he hath, from heart to
skin, will be set aflame, so that nothing will remain save the
Friend.”160 There is no suggestion here or in immediately
subsequent statements, that the seeker becomes ontologically
one with God since the passing away of the world or self or loss
of awareness of them as separate entities – does not imply such
actual, ontological one-ness. This passage is not really
ontologically monist – and therefore, relativism does not need
relativism to reconcile with dualism. Furthermore, we should
recall Bahá’u’lláh’s condemnation of those who,” deluded by their
idle fancies, have conceived all created things as associates and
partners of God.”161 There is no way that the monist vision can
be true without erasing the ontological distinctions between
God and man – a concept that requires us to become one of
God’s ‘partners.’

This statement and others like it irrevocably invalidate any
monist views regardless of our sincerely they might be held.
Sincerity is not a measure of truth, since erroneous views can be
sincerely held.

Finally, it is claimed that the Bahá’í belief that only God has
absolute existence and that human existence is contingent is “in
essence a monist position.”162 Such is far from being the case.

First, the fact that only God possess absolute existence means

only that creation has lesser degrees of being, not that all things
are ontologically one with God. Indeed, to insist on such
identity is, in effect, to insist that God is nothing (like creation)
and that creation is absolute (like God.) Both positions are
untenable for Bahá’í s. Second, the assertion of ontological one-
ness between Creator and created means that God is somehow
present – albeit in different forms – in His creation. This
position would be “appearance through manifestation”163 which
‘Abdu’l-Bahá categorically rejects as “quite impossible.”164 The
reason is straight forward: for the human soul to become one
with God would be for it to leave its own condition as human,
and this is rejected:

> but it [the human soul] never leaves its own condition, in
> which it continues to develop. For example, the reality of
> the spirit of Peter, however far it may progress, will not
> reach to the condition of the Reality of Christ; it
> progresses only in its own environment.
> Look at this mineral. However far it may evolve, it only
> evolves in its own condition; you cannot bring the crystal
> to a state where it can attain to sight. This is impossible.165

This statement makes it clear that there is absolutely no
standpoint from which the soul can alter its essentially human
condition and become ontologically one with God. To become
one with God, also violates Baha’u’llah’s injunction not to
“transgress the limits of one's own rank and station.”166 This re-
emphasizes the dualist position: man is always man and God is
always God. In other words, we always remain in one of the
three stations of existence: “Know that the conditions of
existence are limited to the conditions of servitude, of
prophethood and of Deity.”167 Man is always in the (ontological)
condition of servitude and nothing can change that, either in
this life or the life to come. Furthermore, in the “Commentary
on the Islamic Tradition, ‘I was a Hidden Treasure ...’ ”,
‘Abdu’l-Bahá categorically states his own position that “the path
to knowing the innermost Essence of the Absolute is closed to
all beings ... How can the reality of non-existence ever
understand the ipseity of being?168 Since the knowledge of God
is utterly impossible, then no one – regardless of spiritual
condition – can attain the necessary and sufficient conditions
for obtaining such knowledge which in effect denies the
possibility of unity with God.

Because of the vast ontological gulf between the two169 – a
difference of kind, not of degree – it is impossible for God to
become man or vice versa as held by some mystics. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá

describes this view, which he identifies with the Sufis but which
also applies to Christian incarnationism, as “evident error.”170
There is no way that “ the Preexistent should confine itself to
phenomenal forms.”171 He also rejects the view that man may
become God; he asks rhetorically, “[H]ow can the phenomenal
reality embrace the Preexistent Reality?”172 Bahá’u’lláh makes
the same point when He says, “no soul hath ever found the
pathway to His Being ... every saint hath lost his way in seeking
to comprehend [contain, encircle] His Essence.”173 He re-
enforces this point by asking rhetorically, “How can utter
nothingness gallop its steed in the field of preexistence, or a
fleeting shadow reach to the everlasting sun?”174 In other words,
the ontological difference between the Creator and the created
is too great to be overcome by the mere efforts of humankind.

Not only does ontological monism undermine Bahá’í
theology because it makes Manifestations superfluous as
mediators between God and humankind, but it also ignores
logic. First, if man truly becomes one with God, the Creator of
all other beings, then the claimant in effect becomes his own
creator, which is to say, he exists before he exists because God
logically precedes all other beings. This is not logically possible.
Second, the relationship of dependence on God can never be
revoked or negated in any way. God is the perpetually
indispensable ‘necessary and sufficient condition’ for the
existence of anything other than Himself. Consequently, there
can be no possible point of view, position or stance within
creation where the distinction between Creator and created is
overcome, where the primordial relationship of dependence on
God is invalidated, or effectively negated in some way. To claim
otherwise – as ontological monism does – is to ignore
Baha’u’llah’s warning that “He hath assigned no associate unto
Himself in His Kingdom ...175

However, we must remember that the denial of ontological
union or oneness with God does not preclude an ethical oneness
in which man submits to or harmonizes his personal will with
the will of God. This ethical monism is not only allowed but
even encouraged by the Writings as an essential human goal.
Nevertheless, we must not misinterpret this ethical
harmonization as an ontological union.

The     conclusion     that     ontological     or     even
cognitive/epistemological monism are not an option is
inescapable on the basis of the Writings. The monism/dualism
dichotomy simply doesn’t exist in the Writings, and, therefore,
requires no solution. Moreover, even if such a dichotomy

existed, to propose relativism as a ‘solution’ creates more
philosophical problems than it solves. This is what we shall
demonstrate next.

11: Relativism: A Ba sis f or Metap hysics?

We are still left with the question of whether relativism be “a
basis for Bahá’í metaphysics”176 or ontology as Momen claims.
Analysing this issue in light of the serious philosophical
problems entailed in espousing relativism leads us to the
conclusion that this is not a tenable proposal. As we shall see,
applied to ethical subjects, relativism undercuts the very
possibility of any normative morality, in effect, reducing
morals, vice and virtues, the praiseworthy and the blameworthy
to a matter of personal taste and preference. Applied to
epistemology, it undercuts the very possibility progress in
human intellectual, scientific, technological and spiritual
knowledge, reducing such progress to mere change. It denies as
well the bedrock idea that some cultures are more advanced than
others, as pointed out by ‘Abdu’l-Bahá in various statements.177
In the realm of religion, it denies the very the foundational
Bahá’í doctrine of progressive revelation, since, according to
relativism, there can be no progress, only change. As already
seen, relativism makes the entire concept of a metaphysics
untenable.

According to Momen, there can be no ‘correct’ or ‘incorrect’
interpretation of certain experiences and statements as monist
or dualist because all knowledge “is relative [to the speaker’s
standpoint] .... This may be termed a cognitive or epistemic
relativism.” 178

There are several problems here. The first, and perhaps most
obvious is that if there can be no correct or incorrect
interpretations – by what criteria could we make such
judgments since all interpretations are correct from their
various perspectives? – it will be impossible to do metaphysics
at all. Philosophy and metaphysics are more than free-style
expression of viewpoints: “metaphysics [is] most generally the
philosophical investigation of the nature, constitution and
structure of reality.”179 There are questions of logical
correctness and consistency to consider, not to mention the use,
analysis and critiquing of factual evidence and its meaning.
When all opinions are correct from their perspectives and
subsequently immune from evaluation, how could we ever reach
even the simplest conclusions about “Bahá’í metaphysics” i.e.
about the allegedly “Bahá’í” understanding of the “constitution

and structure of reality”? If that is the case, we cannot claim to
have a “Bahá’í ” or any other kind of metaphysics: all we have is
a collection or heap of viewpoints many of which exclusive to
one another. This completely undermines the possibility of
developing a coherent metaphysics – or a coherent ethics or
code of law for that matter. 180

For relativism, there is an infinite number of equally valid
‘realities’ which can be constructed by human beings,
individually and/or collectively. These may or may not be
reconcilable. There is no common reality or world for all
people. As a result, there is no common reality or world for all
people. As seen immediately above, this leads to the
impossibility of developing an even minimally coherent
metaphysic – theory of reality – or general world-view
(Weltanschauung). Even more, it also makes the entire Bahá’í
project impossible. The mission of the Bahá’í Faith is to provide
a spiritual framework in which all the religious dispensations
can find their place and be elevated to a new level,181 and in
which the dream of a unified world order can be achieved. Such
unity requires that to a considerable degree we share a common
reality, that at least a sufficient number of people agree about
the nature of reality, the nature of man and the world we live
in. The lack of such a common viewpoint or framework is
precisely what plagues the world today and prevents cooperative
action. Among other things, the Bahá’í Faith

> proclaims its readiness and ability to fuse and incorporate
> the contending sects and factions into which they have
> fallen into a universal Fellowship, functioning within the
> framework, and in accordance with the precepts, of a
> divinely conceived, a world-unifying, a world-redeeming
Order.182

Relativism, which has no way of distinguishing true from
false, or the useful from the counterproductive or simply
irrelevant, is not capable of developing such a unifying vision
and framework and thus fails to meet the desperate need of
humankind for unity. “Be anxiously concerned with the needs of
the age ye live in, and center your deliberations on its exigencies
and requirements,”183 says Bahá'u'lláh, and thereby provides us
with at least one criterion by which we can distinguish among
contending viewpoints. This allows us to escape the quicksand
of competing views and – unlike relativism – start the process
of selecting among them.

Another severe problem with relativism and the Bahá’í Faith
is that there can be no universally valid ethical prescriptions

since ethical prescriptions are matters of individual and/or
collective choice: there is no common ethical world for all
people. However, it is precisely the aim of the Bahá’í Faith to
provide a common spiritual and ethical framework within which
all of humanity can live and work together. That is why the
Faith promulgates teachings on the importance of justice, of
human rights, honesty, truthfulness, loyalty, moderation,
knowledge, spirituality and so on. These are not just a matter of
opinion according to the Writings; they are objectively real
virtues consonant with the best in the nature of man: “The
Prophets come into the world to guide and educate humanity so
that the animal nature of man may disappear and the divinity of
his powers become awakened.”184 There is no question here of
the equal validity of opposing viewpoints: “The All-Knowing
Physician hath His finger on the pulse of mankind. He
perceiveth the disease, and prescribeth, in His unerring wisdom,
the remedy.”185 Here, too, we find that relativism is out of step
with the goals of the Bahá’í Faith.

Furthermore, relativism makes the Bahá’í concept of
progressive revelation impossible along with the Bahá’í Faith’s
belief in scientific, social, economic and political progress. To
assert that a certain development is ‘progressive’ requires that
we attain a universal, objective and foundational Archimedean
point from which to make such a judgment. Relativism, of
course, denies that such an Archimedean standpoint exists; we
can only assert that things change, not that they ‘progress’ –
whatever that might mean. Indeed, relativism must also
recognise as equally valid the view that progressive revelation is
false, and ‘imperialist dogma’ for the conquest or subjugation
of other religions. Such a position, of course, cannot be
harmonized with the Bahá’í teachings. Indeed, undermining of
progressive revelation undermines one of the essential
identifying features of the Faith.

Nor can we escape the fact that relativism makes the concept
of a divine Manifestation untenable because a Manifestation
has a privileged, universal, objective and foundational
Archimedean standpoint which make His pronouncements
normative for all of humankind and all cultures at this time.
IOW, His pronouncements are universal, objective and
foundational. Relativism is simply incapable of recognizing the
existence of such a being – though by its own principles it
cannot rule out His existence – and thereby plunge itself into
self-refutation again. Because what is revealed by the
Manifestation is universal, objective and foundational, there is
no room for equally valid but contrary viewpoints. If

contradictory viewpoints were just as valid, why would we need
the Manifestation? Everyone can be his own manifestation!
Bahá'u'lláh makes it clear that this solution is not acceptable for
the simple reason that only one genuine Physician exists for the
world’s ills.

> At one time it [the world] hath been agitated by
> contentions and disputes, at another it hath been
> convulsed by wars, and fallen a victim to inveterate
> diseases. Its sickness is approaching the stage of utter
> hopelessness, inasmuch as the true Physician is debarred
> from administering the remedy, whilst unskilled
> practitioners are regarded with favor, and are accorded
full freedom to act...186

This passage makes it clear that there is no alternative to the
remedies prescribed by the “unerring Physician,”187 that there is
only one Physician whose viewpoint matters. Baha’u’llah’s
“Book itself is the "Unerring Balance" established amongst
men,”188 a statement demonstrating the Manifestation’s absolute
“epistemic privilege.” Such a position conflicts with relativism
in all its forms.

Yet another problem undermines relativism: as Plato pointed
out in the Theatetus, relativism makes it impossible for anyone
to be wrong, misled or simply perverse in their thinking.
Maintaining that everyone is correct from his own standpoint is
tantamount to saying that people cannot err, and, in effect,
have essential infallibility. Not only does this violate common
life-experience, but it also leavers us unable to explain
references to “the divines and the foolish of this age, ”189 to
“certain foolish ones who, after having ascended into the
heavens of their idle fancies, ”190 or to those who are “ignorant
of the mysteries that lie enfolded within him.”191 These
quotations make it clear that relativism is not an accurate
description of what we find in the Writings. It would, of
course, also present insurmountable ethical problems, we would
not be able to distinguish between the actions of a Mother
Theresa and a Dr. Mengele or Stalin’s chief butcher Lavrentiy
Beria.

Relativism also confuses and conflates two distinct
propositions: (a) knowledge is relative to standpoint and (b) all
viewpoints are equally correct.. Two hidden assumptions should
also be mentioned. The first is that there is no Archimedean
standpoint from which to judge amongst competing views, and
the second is that everyone interprets his viewpoint accurately.
The fact that knowledge is relative to standpoint does not

logically lead to the conclusion that all perspectives are equally
valid. Making that leap is precisely what distinguishes relativism
from relationalism and evolutionary Platonic perspectivism. The
Bahá’í Writings certainly believe that knowledge is relative to
standpoint but they do not believe all perspectives are equal. If
that were the case, how could we find such passages as “Even as
it is evident in this day how the people of error are, by their
countenance, known and distinguished from the followers of
divine Guidance.”192 Or take the following:

> He is indeed a true believer in the unity of God who, in
> this Day, will regard Him as One immeasurably exalted
> above all the comparisons and likenesses with which men
> have compared Him. He hath erred grievously who hath
> mistaken these comparisons and likenesses for God
> Himself.193

There is no suggestion in either of these quotations that those
who are in error are correct from their own particular
standpoint.

It is important as well to mention the self-refutational
problems of relativism because Moojan Momen, in his article,
“Relativism: A Basis for Bahá’í Metaphysics” claims that “there
can be no “absolute statements about Reality.”194 The problem
is that this itself is an absolute statement about reality and rules
itself out of court. Once we understand the self-refutational
nature of such relativist pronouncements, we can see why they
cannot form the basis of any programmatic thought and thus
lose any epistemic privilege to become the “basis of Bahá’í
metaphysics.” Furthermore if such categorical statements about
reality are forbidden, what are Bahá’í s to make of the assertion
“God exists”? For Bahá’ís, this declaration cannot be anything
less than absolute, i.e. universal, objective and foundational,
since ‘Abdu’l-Bahá himself provided “proofs and evidences of
the existence of God”195 without any conditions on that
conclusion. It is affirmed absolutely as true from all possible
viewpoints and because nothing can be added to make it more
or less true than it already is. Furthermore, from God’s absolute
existence, we can – contrary to Momen’s claim – make
indisputable ontological deductions. For example, God’s
existence puts Him at the head of a hierarchy of being whose
other members are existentially dependent on Him. This
dependence is true from all possible viewpoints within creation.
Denying or relativizing this irreparably undermines the
foundations of the Bahá’í theology.

Another problem is that the denial of “absolute

statements about reality” 196 in effect asserts that all viewpoints
are equally true (or false) which in turn undermines the central
doctrine of “progressive revelation.” 197 Guided by successive
Manifestations, humans attain ever more adequate – though
never perfect – knowledge of reality. We were “created to carry
forward an ever-advancing civilization.”198 This injunction
implicitly suggests an evolutionary Platonic perspectivism which
asserts that knowledge – while never perfect – is nonetheless
genuinely improving, i.e. being augmented, becoming more
accurate and therefore, progressive.

A fourth difficulty: if we argue that the statements of the
Manifestations are privileged, but human interpretations of
these statements are not, we face the problem of vacuousness.
When all readings are equally true, then – because some readings
contradict others – none are. Consequently, it becomes
impossible to teach the Writings or even to discuss them since –
all interpretations being equally accurate – no one knows what
the Writings actually say. What is the point of becoming a
Bahá’í or offering the Faith’s teachings as a solution to a wide
variety of world problems if no one knows what the Writings
‘really’ mean? How can the Writings be explicated or defended
if what opponents of the Faith says is as true as what the
proponents say? Obviously, the very raison d’être of the Bahá’í
Faith is removed by an unqualified epistemological relativism.

How can we distinguish various degrees of truthfulness
without infringing on every Bahá’ís right to interpret the
Writings for him or herself? This paper contends that the Bahá’í
community has adopted negative gate-keeping as a means of
retaining doctrinal cohesion. Any understanding of the Writings
is acceptable if it is not ‘forbidden,’ that is, inconsistent with
the letter and spirit of the Sacred Text and/or the guidance
from `Abdu'l-Bahá , Shoghi Effendi and the Universal House of
Justice. Such negative gate-keeping would bar all forms of
monism since they assert the possible one-ness of God and the
creature. By adopting negative gate-keeping, Bahá’ís have, in
fact, adopted inasmuch as negative gate-keeping stipulates that
within the framework provided by Bahá’u’lláh, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá ,
Shoghi Effendi and the Universal House of Justice, all
understandings that are not forbidden are equally valid or true.

The fifth problem with Momen’s views on relativism is his
interpretation of Shoghi Effendi’s statement that Bahá’í Faith’s
“teachings revolve around the fundamental principle that
religious truth is not absolute but relative, that Divine
Revelation is progressive, not final.”199 He appears to

understand this as a blanket relativism applicable to all subjects,
but such is not the case. The context of this statement is
progressive revelation in regards to which we must recall
Abdu’l-Baha’s statements that “every one of the divine religions
contains essential ordinances, which are not subject to change,
and material ordinances, which are abrogated according to the
exigencies of time.”200 It is the “material ordinances” not the
“essential ordinances” or “golden core”201 which are relative.
Because these “essential ordinances”202 of religion are not
relative, but “eternal; verities” seen from various perspectives
by successive ages, we have earlier in this paper described this
view as evolutionary Platonic perspectivism.

12\. Concl usion

The Bahá’í Writings do not exemplify relativism as a
philosophy but rather something superficially similar but
actually quite different, namely, relationalism and an
evolutionary Platonic perspectivism. Nowhere do the Writings
align themselves with the various philosophical aspects of
relativism, and therefore, to say they are relativistic
misrepresents their philosophical nature both to Bahá’í s and
not non- Bahá’í s. Such misunderstanding can make the work of
teaching, explicating and defending the Faith even more
difficult than it already is by creating needless obstacles.

Nor can relativism be employed as a solution to the problem
of religious diversity. First of all, Bahá’í s have to remember
that

> Bahá’u’lláh does not include all religious phenomena in
> His definition of the religion of God ... Bahá’u’lláh has
> not taught that every school, every branch of the true
> religions of God are rightly guided and hence reflect truly
> reflect the intentions of their Founders.203

For example, Bahá’u’lláh says that some religions are “the
outcome of human perversity.”204 This alone should prevent
Bahá’í s from simply accepting at face value any and all religious
claims; rather they should examine them critically to see if they
accord with Bahá’u’lláh’s divine teachings and reason, as
‘Abdu’l-Bahá does in his discussions about Sufism,
Theosophy205, Hinduism206 (in regards to reincarnation),
Catholicism (in regards to monks and the doctrine of
transubstantiation207)    and    Buddhism.208     `Abdu'l-Bahá’s
discussions show no sign of wanting to accept any and all ideas
and developments in religious thought – and this alone

demonstrates that he does not express or conduct himself like a
relativist. The Master loves people, but this does not prevent
him from examining their ideas in the light of Bahá’u’lláh’s
teachings209 and critical reasoning. The teachings are the
Archimedean point from which other religious claims must be
evaluated:

> Weigh not the Book of God with such standards and
> sciences as are current amongst you, for the Book itself is
> the unerring Balance established amongst men. In this
> most perfect Balance whatsoever the peoples and kindreds
> of the earth possess must be weighed, while the measure of
> its weight should be tested according to its own standard,
> did ye but know it.210
Relativism is also powerless to solve the problem of
conflicting religious diversity because relativism has no answer
to the conflicts except to let them continue since all viewpoints
are true from their own standpoint. There is no possible way to
resolve their differences on the basis of relativist philosophy
because a relativist philosophy encourages the perpetuation of
these differences and sees no need to bring them together. They
are not seen as problematical in the first place. Why should it, if
everyone is right? And on what basis could it do so? Choosing
any such basis, would, in effect, be choosing a Archimedean
standpoint from which to evaluate other beliefs – and that leads
to all sorts of difficulties relativism seeks to avoid.

Here is yet another reason to conclude that the Bahá’í
Writings do not exemplify a relativist philosophy. Rather, as we
have seen, it illustrates an approach we have called relationalism
and evolutionary Platonic perspectivism which do justice to the
Faith’s respect for diversity without sinking in the quicksand of
relativism.
