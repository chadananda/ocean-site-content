Bushido (Chivalry) and the Traditional Japanese Moral
Education
Nozomu Sonda
Yamaguchi, Independent Scholar

Abstract
"Bushido" was written in 1900, in response to questions often asked by his Western
wife and colleagues. In this work he eloquently explains the very heart of
traditional Japanese moral education inculcated to samurais and their families,
referring to some major "virtues" of Japanese. Incidentally, the late Hand of the
Cause of God Ruhiyiih Khanum lavished her praise on Japanese listing many
wonderful qualities and virtues she observed on her visit to the country back in the
1970's. This study will explore the Japanese virtues explained by Nitobe in contrast
and comparison with the Baha'i perspective on moral education.
Introduction

> “Chivalry is a flower no less indigenous to the soil of Japan than its
> emblem, the cherry blossom.”
In 2003 a Hollywood movie The Last Samurai was released and became a
big hit. It featured a superstar like Tom Cruise and also introduced a
Japanese star Ken Watanabe to the international film scene, attracting a
great deal of attention from media. However, the most salient feature of the
movie was actually the spirit and thought that underlay it, namely, Bushido.
The timing of the appearance of such a movie seemed to be no coincidence
to the present author. It was a time when Japanese people were enjoying the
sentiment of traditional thought and spirit, recollecting the heroic times of
the end of Edo Era when young samurais fought fearlessly for the sake of
the country, preservation of old values and acceptance of new values. The
time was apparently contrasted with the contemporary age when there are so
many political scandals, deception, corruption and cowardice. The author
recalls one commercial where a famous samurai (Sakamoto Ryoma) from
the same period “appears” and makes a bitter comment on the current
situation in Japanese society, implying that he would do things in a different
way (and thus appealing to the company‟s service being advertised)..
Around at the same time the author met a Japanese gentleman, who had just
retired and said that he just started reading “Bushido,” thinking about what
it meant and how he could make use of it. There was a need and craving for
the revival of such traditional values and thoughts; Bushido seemed to be an
epitome of this phenomenon.

In brief, as Captain Algren (Tom Cruise) learns in The Last Samurai,
Bushido is not just a code of ethics for samurai warriors but rather a moral
system and even a way of life for people in general, which influenced
Japanese for centuries. It inculcates the importance of cultivating and
practicing “virtues.”

Speaking of “virtues,” the author makes another recollection when the late
Hand of Cause of God Ruhiyyih Khanum made a visit to Japan in 1978 and
made a comment that of all the peoples she had encountered the Japanese
manifest the most of the virtues which Baha‟u‟llah exhorts us to acquire. As
a member of the same ethnic group, the author feels a great honor to receive
such a comment but at the same time regards it as a compliment for the
purpose of encouraging the Japanese people to arise and serve the Cause of
Baha‟u‟llah. Other peoples in the rest of the world must surely manifest as
many virtues as the Japanese do, if not less. Having said this, there must be
still something more or less special in the Japanese people that compelled
her to make such a comment.
It is this point that motivated the present author to explore Bushido as a
moral system and a source of Japanese virtues and to compare and contrast
it with teachings of our beloved Faith. In this study, the background of
Bushido will be first explained and then virtues which Bushido inculcates
will be examined. Then we education and training based on Bushido will be
described, including those of women. Finally, Bushido will be compared
and contrasted with ideals, goals and objectives of the Baha‟i Faith and
implications to moral education in contemporary Japan will be discussed. .
What is Bushido?
Bushido was spontaneously developed over hundreds of years as a way of
life for samurais. Thus we cannot categorically determine its origin. But we
can roughly say that its origin somewhat coincides with the Kamakura Era
(12th century), which was the beginning of the feudal system which was
obviously the bedrock of Japanese swordsmanship. In order to further
explore the origin, sources and background of Bushido, we will mainly rely
on the masterpiece written by Inazo Nitobe, a Christian educationalist from
the late 19th and early 20th centuries.
Inazo Nitobe
Nitobe was born in Morioka, Iwate in 1862. In his youth, he studied at
Tokyo Foreign Language College and Sapporo Agricultural College and
later at Johns Hopkins University in the U.S. and the University of Bonn in
Germany. In 1891, he married Mary Elkinton, a fellow Quaker Church
member, when he was 29 years old. After returning to Japan, he took up
professorship at Sapporo Agricultural College. Then he published Bushido
in 1900, later teaching at various major universities in Japan and also

serving as Vice-Secretary General of the League of Nations and member of
the House of Lords. In 1933 when he was attending the 5th Pacific
Conference in Vancouver, Canada, he fell ill and passed away.
In his late teens, Nitobe was baptized as a Christian; then he determined to
become “a bridge over the Pacific Ocean” which connects Japan and the
West. In his mid-20‟s he attended Quaker church while studying at Johns
Hopkins University. There he met his future wife Mary.
Nitobe made great contributions in the educational field during the Meiji
and Taisho Eras. He was also a champion in the international field while
working for the League of Nations and an agency which was to later
become UNESCO. In contrast, Japan was heading towards a military
empire; the militia did not like such “a global-minded” person s Nitobe
those days. His achievements were only recently acknowledged, symbolized
by the fact that his iconography appeared in the new 5,000-yen bills.
The Book Bushido
His book Bushido was first published in English, whose first Japanese
edition was prepared by Sakurai. Later Tadao Yanaibara revised the
translation. Yanaibara was actually one of Nitobe‟s students when the latter
was principal of Daiichi High School in Tokyo. He was also a disciple of
Kanzo Uchimura‟s. Uchimura was in turn a classmate of Nitobe when both
were students at Sapporo Agricultural College. Both signed “the covenant of
those who believe in Jesus” introduced by W. Clark of the same college.
These three, Nitobe, Uchimura and Yanaibara, are leaders of thought in the
early 1900‟s in Japan who had the Christian background.
The book was written essentially in response to countless questions about
Japanese culture and society posed by his Western wife and colleagues. One
time a Westerner commented, “Do you mean to say that you have no
religious instruction in your schools? No religion! How do you impart moral
education?”1 At that time, Nitobe could give no answer, but later he gave
much thought and concluded that all basic moral notions he had received
came from Bushido. Thus he came to write this book.
Sources of Bushido
Buddhism
One of the main sources of bushido is Buddhism. Buddhism was introduced
to Japan from India and via China and Korea. It taught a sense of calm trust
in fate, a quiet submission to the inevitable, stoic composure in sight of
danger or calamity and disdain of life and friendliness with death. One of its

schools, Zen, had an especial impact on Bushido. According to Lafcadio
Hearn2, Zen can be defined as that “which represents human effort to reach
through meditation zones of thought beyond the range of verbal
expression”3
Shinto
Another source was Shinto, which is a Japanese indigenous religion. It
stressed patriotism, loyalty, and obedience, teaching loyalty to the
sovereign, reverence for ancestors and filial piety. Unlike the Christian
thought, there is a lack of the dogma of “original sin.” In other words,
Shinto teaches that a human heart is originally pure and good like a god and
that it is a sanctified place where a god‟s words are uttered. Thus the human
heart must be revered. A mirror which is placed in the shrine‟s penetralia
symbolizes a human heart, which is believed to reflect the very image of
Deity when calm and serene.
Confucianism
Yet another source is Confucianism which is a prolific source of ethics. It
taught five moral relations between “master and servant,” “father and son,”
“husband and wife,” “older and younger brother,” and “friend and friend.” It
comprised politico-ethical precepts in an aristocratic and conservative tone.
The writings of Confucius and Mencius were the principal textbooks for
youths and the highest authority for the old. It also taught one to avoid being
a book-smelling sot, as shown in a saying “To know and to act are one and
the same” and words from the Bible “Seek ye first the kingdom of God and
his righteousness.”
Virtues of Bushido
Confucius says, “Let but a prince cultivate virtue, people will flock to him;
with people will come to him lands; lands will bring forth for him wealth;
wealth will give him the benefit of right uses. Virtue is the root, and wealth
an outcome”4 Thus, virtue is the foundation of all things. In this section, we
will analyze some virtues extolled and emphasized in bushido; namely,
rectitude/justice, courage, benevolence, politeness, veracity/sincerity, honor,
loyalty, and self-control.
Rectitude/justice
Rectitude is the most severe lesson and it “is the power of deciding upon a
certain course of conduct in accordance with reason, without wavering;--to

die when it is right to die, to strike when to strike is right” 5 Nitobe explains
the significance of rectitude or sense of justice while contrasting it with the
Christian concept of love: “…though love should be the only motive,
lacking that, there must be some other authority to enforce filial piety; and
they formulated this authority in Giri”6 He also warns, “Starting as Right
Reason, Giri has…often stooped to casuistry. It has even degenerated into
cowardly fear of censure”7. Thus for Nitobe, love is the highest form of
virtue, without which one‟s action can only be motivated by sense of justice,
which is understandable judging from his Christian background. He then
explains the role of courage which helps one to manifest rectitude in its
highest potential: “It would have been easily turned into a nest of cowardice,
if Bushido had not a keen and correct sense of courage, the spirit of daring
and bearing”8
Courage: Spirit of Daring
Nitobe explains that “Courage was scarcely deemed worthy to be counted
among virtues, unless it was exercised in the cause of Righteousness”9
pointing out the complementary functions of justice and courage. . He also
states that “…valour and honour alike required that we should own as
enemies in war only such as prove worthy of being friends in peace” and
“When valour attains this height, it becomes akin to Benevolence”10,
illustrating which point with the examples of Uesugi Kenshin and Takeda
Shingen or Brutus and Antonius/Octavius. As it is said, “We Romans do not
fight with gold, but with iron,” fight is not for greed for money but for a
great cause, justice. Thus enemies are not what are to be hated but to be
fought with respect. In this sense, they can become one‟s true friends, as
Nietzsche says, “You are to be proud of your enemy; then the success of
your enemy is your success also.” During the samurai days, “Valour,
Fortitude, Bravery, Fearlessness, Courage” were among the most popular
qualities for the youths, giving great impact on character formation of the
young.
Benevolence: The Feeling of Distress
Benevolence was considered “a princely virtue” as shown in the following
words: “Love, magnanimity, affection for others, sympathy and pity, were
ever recognized to be supreme virtues, the highest of all the attributes of the
human soul”11 This virtue posed a great contrast with justice and courage
because “…benevolence was a tender virtue and mother-like. If upright
Rectitude and stern Justice were peculiarly masculine, Mercy had the

gentleness and the persuasiveness of a feminine nature”12. The balance of
these two virtues was very important to make the character whole. Thus,
verse writing was encouraged to cultivate more subtle sentiments of soul.
Politeness
“Modesty and complaisance, actuated by respect for others‟ feelings, are at
the root of politeness”13. Politeness is yet another typical Japanese virtue;
however, Nitobe makes sure that it is not a superficial display of adulation
but a sincere expression of care and concern for others: “Politeness is a poor
virtue, if it is actuated only by a fear of offending good taste, whereas it
should be the outward manifestation of a sympathetic regard for the feelings
of others. It also implies a due regard for the fitness of things, therefore due
respect to social positions”14. He also gives an excellent explanation for the
seemingly different practice of gift-giving between the Japanese and
Western customs. That is, whereas Westerners present their gifts as
wonderful and excellent items, Japanese give theirs saying they are poor and
useless ones. Nitobe expounds that these two contrasting practices actually
convey the same feeling and thought; they are just two ways of saying the
same thing. In other words, Westerners focus on the great merit which their
guest deserves; thus, they would say, “This is a nice gift: if it were not nice I
would not dare give it to you; for it will be an insult to give you anything
but what is nice.” On the other hand, Japanese would focus on the
inadequacy of the gift they are presenting because the guest is just too great
and wonderful for any gift we might come up with: “You are a nice person,
and no gift is nice enough for you. You will not accept anything I can lay at
your feet except as a token of my good will; so accept this, not for its
intrinsic value, but as a token…”15. Both expressions stem from the feelings
of respect for the guest; they manifest the same spirit of politeness. Only the
cultural expressions differ.
Veracity and Sincerity
What makes the above virtue of politeness true and real, is sincerity. Nitobe
warns, “Without veracity and sincerity, politeness is a farce and a show”16
This is reinforced by Date Masamune saying, “Propriety carried beyond
right bounds becomes a lie” and Confucius saying, “Sincerity is the end and
the beginning of all things; without Sincerity there would be nothing.”
Words and deeds clothed with sincerity capture and move human hearts.
This spirit is alive in modern Japanese society especially in the service
industry. Stores that provide sincere service attract customers and thus
prosper.

Honor
The sense of honor implies “a vivid consciousness of personal dignity and
worth…”and it is “the immortal part of one‟s self, what remains being
bestial”17 (p.72, Bushido). The sense of shame was one of the earliest to be
cherished in juvenile education. The following expressions were often used
(and in fact are still used today) to appeal to the minds and hearts of the
youths for their behavioral rectification: “You will be laughed at,” “It will
disgrace you,” and “Are you not ashamed?” Samurais, in defense of this
honor (or avoiding shame), would even go so far as to take their own lives
(i.e., seppuku, disembowelment). Even in today‟s society, leaders often
resign from their posts if there are any disgraceful happenings in their
jurisdiction. Some even commit suicide. In today‟s world, such acts are not
necessarily constructive. They may save their honor for the time being but
not their companies and their employees. It may be even more honorable to
remain in their posts and carry out necessary duties.
Loyalty
Homage and fealty to a superior is the distinctive feature of feudal morality.
Personal fidelity is a moral cohesion existing among all sorts and conditions
of men. “…it is only in the code of chivalrous honour that loyalty assumes
paramount importance”18 (p.82, Bushido) and “Life being regarded as the
means whereby to serve his master, and its ideal being set upon honour, the
whole education and training of a samurai were conducted accordingly”19
(p.93, Bushido).
Self-Control
Showing “no sign of joy or anger” was considered a sign of a great
character. Thus a samurai would show no emotion. This is also apparent in
average family life today. A father would not hug his son because he
considers it harmful to dignity and a husband would not kiss his wife in
public. On the other hand, there is this “strange” phenomenon of “a
Japanese smile.” That is, when in most severe trials, there is a tendency for
Japanese to form a smile. The point in all these behaviors is not to show true
emotion. Thus, self-control tends to exceed moderation. Self-control is in
itself a wonderful quality. However, excess of this practice might result in
confusion and frustration; it is not conducive to more humane interaction
with others. Children also need to express themselves more freely in order
to grow and develop in healthy manners.
Education and Training of a Samurai

Nitobe, Bushido, p.72

Ibid, p.82

Ibid, p.93

The foremost point in samurai educations was to build up character, leaving
other subtler faculties of prudence, intelligence and dialectics in minor
position. This point is fully expounded in the earlier sections of this paper.
Having said this, philosophy and literature constitute the mainstay of
intellectual training. Literature was pursued as a pastime and philosophy as
a practical aid in the formation of character, if not for the exposition of some
military or political problem. Other courses of training included fencing,
archery, jijutsu/yawara20, horsemanship, the use of spear, tactics, calligraphy,
ethics, literature, and history.
Moreover, “The mental discipline which would nowadays be chiefly aided
by the study of mathematics, was supplied by literary exegesis and
deontological discussions”21 Francis Bacon listed three services of studies:
delight, ornament, and ability. Bushido emphasized the ability purpose
where the use of studies was in judgment and the disposition of business
because “Learning without thought is labour lost; thought without learning
is perilous.”
Since the most important goal of samurai education was character building,
his teacher‟s duty was basically spiritual: “When character and not
intelligence, when the soul and not the head, is chosen by a teacher for the
material to work upon and to develop, his [teacher‟s] vocation partakes of a
sacred character”22. In this respect, Nitobe makes a quite bitter and yet exact
point, criticizing as follows:
The present system of paying for every sort of service was not in vogue
among the adherents of Bushido. It believed in a service which can be
rendered only without money and without price. Spiritual service, be it of
priest or teacher, was not to be repaid in gold or silver, not because it was
valueless but because it was invaluable.”23
He believes that “the best service done in education,--namely, in soul
development (and this includes the services of a pastor), is not definite,
tangible, or measurable” and that “Being immeasurable, money, the
ostensible measure of value, is of inadequate use”24 This is a profound
statement, giving much insight to today‟s educational world. In today‟s
society, the teaching profession is often taken up by those who “had no
where else to go” and teachers are often poorly paid. Thus, teachers are
often poorly trained and less motivated. School teachers have the most
difficult times these days as classrooms break down and children

Jūjutsu meaning "gentle/yielding/compliant art") is a Japanese martial art whose central ethos is to
yield to the force provided by an opponent's attack in order to apply counter techniques from the resultant ensuing
situation see Wikipedia, “Jujitsu”,

Ibid, p.101

misbehave. Teachers are at loss and often do not know what to do with the
situation.
On the other hand, there is still that feeling of sacredness in the teaching
profession. There is sense of respect. Students do look up to teachers to a
certain degree. They do trust teachers. In turn there are teachers who are
devoted to their profession and sacrifice themselves for the sake of students‟
growth and development. The difference between now and then is that there
is much lack of sacredness in the profession. Teaching is taken up for more
utilitarian purposes. Schools focus mostly on intellectual achievement.
Teachers are thus regarded and treated as mere workers in the factory
producing high-mark scores of students.
For Nitobe, teachers “were grave personifications of high spirits undaunted
by adversity” and “an embodiment of what was considered as an end of all
learning, and were thus a living example of that discipline of disciplines,
self-control, which was universally required of samurai”25. In other words,
teachers were supposed to be moral leaders for their students. Because they
were relatively free from monetary care, “Bushido itself could long remain
free from a thousand and one evils of which money is the root”26.
The Training and Position of Women
Since Bushido was basically intended for males, its training was masculine
and the virtues extolled therein were also more or less masculine. It is quite
interesting and helpful that Nitobe talks about education of women in
relation to Bushido. The Bushido ideal of womanhood was pre-eminently
domestic, though not confined to the so-called traditional Western view of
female domain of activity: kitchen, church and children. Women in the
samurai family were also taught to be Amazonian, that is, to make domestic
usage of Bushido for child education and to protect their family from
enemies. Women thus took up naginata (wooden swords) and learned to
fight. At the same time, in order to purify their minds and hearts, women
appreciated music and dance.
Women were also taught self-denial from childhood and learned to sacrifice
themselves for their fathers, husbands, and children. This became the
keynote of their domesticity. To them, service meant “to serve something
higher than self.” Just as their husbands served their lords, women served
the needs of their fathers, husbands and children.
To samurais and their wives, marriage meant unity of man and woman; thus
they would not insult or degrade each other. In this regard, Nitobe explain
why Japanese husbands introduce their wives as lowly beings and never

Nitobe, Bushido, p.102

Ibid, p.99

praise them. He says that in Japan self-praise is considered poor taste and
thus they do not praise their wives in public because they consider them as
the same as themselves. Today, the concept of sexual equality is viewed
differently in Japan in contrast with that of the West. What Western women
might see as sexual inequality or even abuse is not necessarily felt as such
by Japanese women themselves. They might even feel perfectly equal. It
may be explained by the same one as posed by Nitobe.
Bushido and the Baha’i Faith
In comparing and contrasting Bushido and the Baha‟i Faith, there are great
similarities and distinct differences. In terms of the former, the strong
emphasis on spiritual virtues, even over intellectual capacities and skills, is a
common foundation. In terms of the latter, these virtues of Bushido are
clearly confined to the Japanese culture and especially in the context of
samurai swordsmanship whereas the Baha‟i virtues are more universal and
global, encompassing both women and men, young and old and peoples of
all national and cultural backgrounds.
Acquiring virtues
One definite common factor to both Bushido and the Baha‟i Faith is
acquisition of virtues. In fact, acquiring virtues has always been the most
important aspect of all religions. In the Koran, there are 99 names (or divine
virtues) of God mentioned. Likewise, in the Baha‟i Writings, there are
numerous divine virtues and qualities mentioned throughout its Writings. A
Baha‟i virtue educator Linda Popov easily mentions more than 50 virtues
for children and families to develop in her books whereas in fact she has
identified a few hundred virtues in the process. The following are among
such virtues mentioned in the Baha‟i Faith:
Assertiveness, care, cleanliness, compassion, confidence, consideration,
consultation, courage, courtesy, creativity, detachment, eloquence,
enthusiasm, excellence, faithfulness, flexibility, forgiveness, friendliness,
generosity, gentleness, helpfulness, honesty, honor, humility, idealism,
joyfulness, justice, kindness, knowledge, loftiness, love, loyalty, mercy,
might, moderation, modesty, obedience, orderliness, patience, peacefulness,
prayerfulness, purposefulness, question, reliability, respect, responsibility,
reverence, search, self-discipline, service, steadfastness, tact, thankfulness,
tolerance, trust, trustworthiness, truthfulness, unity, utterance, will, wisdom,
Justice
Baha‟u‟llah says:

> O SON OF SPIRIT! The best beloved of all things in My sight is
> Justice….. By its aid thou shalt see with thine own eyes and not

> through the eyes of others, and shalt know of thine own knowledge
> and not through the knowledge of thy neighbor. ….. Verily justice is
> My gift to thee and the sign of My loving-kindness.27

Justice is definitely one of the most important virtues in the Baha‟i
teachings. With its aid one will see things as they are, not influenced by
others‟ opinions. But the balance of weighing things comes from God
Himself, as Baha‟u‟llah explains, “The essence of all that We have revealed
for thee is Justice, is for man to free himself from idle fancy and imitation,
discern with the eye of oneness His glorious handiwork, and look into all
things with a searching eye.”28. In Bushido, the cause of justice is done in
relation to loyalty to the lord whereas in the Baha‟i Faith it is in relation to
God Himself.
Courage
Just as explained under “Justice,” the virtue of “courage” is also manifested
in relation to God‟s teachings. Baha‟u‟llah says, “The source of courage and
power is the promotion of the Word of God, and steadfastness in His
Love”29 In Bushido, justice and courage are in complementary relations,
which is also confirmed in the Baha‟i Faith; however, the most distinctive
difference is that both virtues are directly founded upon Word of God and
His teachings.
Benevolence
Just as love and affection are highly valued in Bushido, so are they in the
Baha‟i teachings. The Baha‟i Faith emphasizes, once again the foundation
of love coming from God:

> The essence of love is for man to turn his heart to the Beloved One,
> and sever himself from all else but Him, and desire naught save that
> which is the desire of his Lord.30
> The essence of charity is for the servant to recount the blessings of
> his Lord, and to render thanks unto Him at all times and under all
> conditions.31

Similarly, the following virtues of Bushido are equally emphasized and
extolled in the Baha‟i Writings:

Politeness

Sincerity

Honor

> The source of all glory is acceptance of whatsoever the Lord hath
> bestowed, and contentment with that which God hath ordained34.
> ….. man's glory lieth in his knowledge, his upright conduct, his
> praiseworthy character, his wisdom, and not in his nationality or
> rank. O people of the earth! Appreciate the value of this heavenly
> word. Indeed it may be likened unto a ship for the ocean of
> knowledge and a shining luminary for the realm of perception.35

Feminine Virtues
Although Bushido influenced and trained all people including women and
civilians, it was essentially designed for male warriors who were ready to
fight in the battle field. In contrast, Abdu‟l-Baha states that humankind will
acquire more feminine qualities in this new age:

> The world in the past has been ruled by force, and man has
> dominated over woman by reason of his more forceful and
aggressive qualities both of body and mind. But the balance is

What is more important here is that Abdu‟l-Baha talks about the balance of
masculine and feminine qualities to be manifested in the civilization. In the
Baha‟i Faith, such qualities as utterance, eloquence, assertiveness and
consultative attitude are also emphasized; these are relatively lacking in
Bushido. Thus, humankind at large is expected to acquire more virtues in a
harmonious manner. In other words, we need to be more “round” in virtues.
Universality of Virtues
Another major difficulty of Bushido, especially in contemporary society, is
that its values are limited to the Japanese culture and in military context. If
we simply talk about cultural values and norms, conflicts are inevitable. One
culture says silence is gold and another says eloquence is gold. How do we
reconcile the difference? After all, what we need most in this global age is
the common foundation of values from which to work together in peace and
harmony. The Baha‟i Faith presents the very foundation we need; it is the
new value system from God intended for this modern age. Although the
Baha‟i Faith emphasizes preservation and respect for cultural and individual
diversity, it is so in the context of essential unity.
This “unity in diversity” is the ultimate goal of the Baha‟i Faith. Some
people worry that this idea of “unification” might lead to extinction of
freedom and self-expression. On the contrary, the Baha‟i Faith affirms that
there will still be room for an infinite number of individual, local and
national differences even they are all based on the common foundation. No,
it is the very lack of common foundation that will eventually dissipate and
destroy the beauty and greatness of diversity as its sings are apparent in
today‟s chaotic society. The virtues extolled in the Baha‟i faith are universal
and applicable to all peoples.
Sources of Virtues
According to the Baha‟i teachings, what determines right and wrong is the
teachings of God. In contrast, according to Bushido, the balance of right and
wrong comes from the lord samurais serve though the very foundation of
values is based on the teachings of Buddhism, Shinto and Confucianism.

Abdu‟l-Baha, citedJohn Esselmont:, Baha’u’llah and New Era by, Wilmette: Baha‟i Publishing
Trust, 1980. p.149 Originally in Star of the West, viii, No. 3,p. 4 [from report of remarks made aboard the S.S.
Cedric on arrival in New York].

Nevertheless, the values are not necessarily clear-cut in Bushido. As
depicted in The Last Samuari, the conflict was essentially in loyalty to the
emperor or the merits of the Western civilization, not necessarily in the
values and ideas themselves.
Thus, according to the Baha‟i Faith, the source of all virtues is God. In fact,
Baha‟u‟llah states that when God created humanity He bestowed divine
virtues potentially into their souls:

> O SON OF MAN! I loved thy creation, hence I created thee.
> Wherefore, do thou love Me, that I may name thy name and fill thy
> soul with the spirit of life.37

Thus, the Biblical expression that God has created man in His image means
that God has infused divine qualities into our souls potentially so that in
accordance with our own volition and effort we may develop and cultivate
these qualities. That is our duty. Abdu‟l-Baha also confirms that our purpose
of life is to acquire virtues38
In comparing and contrasting Bushido and the Baha‟i Faith, there are great
similarities and distinct differences. In terms of the former, the strong
emphasis on spiritual virtues, even over intellectual capacities and skills, is a
common foundation. In terms of the latter, these virtues of Bushido are
clearly confined to the Japanese culture and especially in the context of
samurai swordsmanship whereas the Baha‟i virtues are more universal and
global, encompassing both women and men, young and old and peoples of
all national and cultural backgrounds.
Influence of Bushido on Japanese Society
Bushido was the root and flower of people; gifts from heaven flowed
through samurais. They established the moral standard and guided people
through their examples. Thus themes of performing arts were often taken
from warriors‟ stories.
Bushido was originally initiated as an elite course for those soldiers to be;
however, it also inspired the mass over time. Although the commons did not
reach the same high standard of the warriors, the concept of “Japanese soul”
permeated among the people, representing the entire ethnicity.
Bushido was often likened to cherry blossoms, the indigenous flower to
Japan. Cherry blossoms possess grace and beauty and yet they are simple.
Below the beauty, no blade or poison is hidden. Their color is no glamorous.
Their odor is sweet, which floats and ascends to heaven. When the morning

Abdu‟l-Baha, Paris Talks,. Wilmette: Baha‟i Publishing Trust, 1978, p.177

sun rises, their odor spreads and freshest our senses. Similarly, Bushido is
simple, beautiful and graceful and yet not glamorous but diffuses refreshing
atmosphere to those around.
Future of Bushido
Bushido, which blossomed and guided the people for so long, however, had
to eventually succumb to the trend of the times. When chivalry departed
from the European feudalism, church protected warriors and chivalry thus
prolonged its longevity. Japan, however, lacked in major religion to play the
same role; Shinto which had sustained Bushido simply aged and
Confucianism was replaced by Western philosophies. Plus, the modern war
utilized completely different methods and weapons from those of Bushido.
The life of Bushido was thus terminated rather quickly after the end of
feudalism in the late 1800‟s.
Nevertheless, Nitobe claims that it was Bushido that acted as a moving force
in the transformation witnessed during the Meiji Restoration. He explains
that Japan did not simply look for materials development and wealth
accumulation, imitating the Western nations. It was the sense of pride which
Bushido had cultivated among the masses that drove them to work hard and
demonstrate what they could do once they out their mind to it. Industrial
developments were simply results of their hard work.
Abdu‟l-Baha also seems to acknowledge the Japanese virtue of hard
working ethics and expects the Japanese to do the same for spiritual
development as they did for material development:

> Japan has made wonderful progress in material civilization, but she
> will become perfect when she will also make spiritual developments
> and the Power of the Kingdom become manifest in her.39

The form of Bushido, however, reached an end after the Meiji Era started as
shown in the recent movie Last Samurai. The underlying spirit nevertheless
remained, which drive Nitobe to quote a prophecy uttered by his
contemporary:

> It has been predicted…that the moral system of Feudal Japan, like its
> castles and its armouries, will crumble into dust, and new ethics rise
> phoenix-like to lead New Japan in her path of progress.40

Nitobe thus expected coming of a new moral system which will take over
the outdated Bushido and guide Japan to a new path. But what might that
be?

Turn Ablaze! Tablets of Abdu’l-Baha, Letters of Shoghi Effendi and Historical Notes about Japan. Tokyo: Baha'i
Publishing Trust, 1974., p.189

Christianity
As Bushido disappeared in its form, a possible ethical system that could
have replaced it was Christianity. In fact, Nitobe himself was a Christian and
so were his friend Uchimura Kanzo and his student Yauchibara Tadao, who
were all great educators and thinkers representing the Meiji, Taisho and
early Showa Eras. Nitobe said, “Christianity and materialism…will divide
the world between them. Lesser systems of morals will ally themselves to
either side for their preservation. On which side will Bushido enlist?”41
Thus, Nitobe apparently hoped that Christianity would take the place of
Bushido. Yet, contrary to his wish, Christianity failed to spread among the
Japanese masses. He gives the following analyses of the causes of this
failure:

> One cause of the failure of mission work is that most of the
> missionaries are entirely ignorant of our history. 42 ….if presented in
> intelligible words…if expressed in the vocabulary familiar in the
> moral development of a people…[Christianity] will find easy
> lodgment in their hearts, irrespective of race or nationality.”43
> Should a propagator of the new faith uproot the entire stock, root,
> and branches, and plant the seeds of the Gospel on the ravaged
> soil?.....it is a process which Jesus Himself would never have adopted
> in founding His kingdom on earth.”44

In the Baha‟i Faith, there are certain conditions that teachers of the Faith
must meet before undertaking pioneering work in foreign lands. One is to
learn about the history, culture, language and customs of the land. They
must also use terminology which the people are used to. They must also
think about the true happiness of the people they are coming into contact
with, not caring about themselves.
Coercive proselytizing is also prohibited in the Baha‟i Faith. Rather, we are
told to search for truth together with those we intend to share the teachings
with:
In accordance with the divine teachings in this glorious Dispensation we
should not belittle anyone and call him ignorant, saying: 'You know not but I
know.' Rather we should look upon others with respect, and when
attempting to explain and demonstrate, we should speak as if we are

investigating the truth, saying: „Here these things are before us. Let us
investigate to determine where and in what form the truth can be found.‟

> The teacher should not consider himself as learned and others
> ignorant. Such a thought breeds pride and pride is unconducive to
> influence. The teacher should not see in himself any superiority; he
> should speak with the utmost kindliness, lowliness and humility, for
> such speech exerts influence and educates the souls.45
Naturally, argumentative attitude is not conducive to influencing souls:

> Do not argue with anyone, and be wary of･disputation. Speak out the
> truth. If your hearer accepteth, the aim is achieved. If he is obdurate,
> you should leave him to himself, and place your trust in God. Such is
> the quality of those who are firm in the Covenant.46

Thus, we need to be understanding, loving and kind to those we teach the
Faith.
Militarism and Materialism
As Christian missionary work failed, Japan dashed towards militarism. She
withdrew from the League of Nations, which Nitobe served so faithfully,
isolated herself from the world, betrayed allied nations and eventually got
caught in the quagmire of the Pacific War until the tragic events in
Hiroshima and Nagasaki put an end to it. In this war, Shinto as state religion
was abused and misused, which caused the nation to shun religion away
after the war.
After the war ensued intensive economic activity propelled by strong
materialism. There was no more war using weaponry. Instead, the nation ran
itself into economic war using money and goods. It started during the
economic miracle of the 1960‟s and reached the peak with the bubble
economy in the 19080‟s. The Japanese products were rated only the third-
class during the 1970‟s. But the Japanese people worked themselves so hard
that they were even called “economic animals” and now their goods are
regarded as among the world‟s best.
These activities and hard labor can be recognized as positive qualities in
themselves. However, as Nitobe had alarmed, Japan had neglected the
development of a large portion of spiritual civilization. As a counter-reaction
to this, there have been several religious booms during the last 50 years to
fill the gaps made in society through all this material development. Many
new religious organizations have appeared, some of which possess millions

'Abdu'l-Bahá, Ibid, p.344, No. 87)

of followers. However, some of them have caused scandals and even
committed crimes, bringing harm to society and its people. People became
even more skeptical of religion.
Revival of Bushido?
The economic miracle of Japan reached its prime stage in the 1990‟s and
now Japan is going through some hard times. People are starting to
understand that material prosperity cannot satisfy their need completely,
seeking for spiritual sustenance. This trend is represented and symbolized
by nostalgia for “the good old days.” Even among the youth generations can
this phenomenon be observed. Many enjoy appreciating the old art works,
literature, tea ceremony and flower arrangement. Some seek comfort and
healing by living in traditional wooden structure homes. As commented in
the introduction of this paper, the recently released Hollywood movie The
Last Samurai has also stimulated this trend. Many people are now showing
greater interest in the spirit of samurais and Bushido. Japanese baseball
players join the Major League Baseball and talk about playing baseball with
the samurai spirit.
Just as Nitobe mentioned, the contemporary Japanese society is now
searching for a new system of morals. Especially the educational world is at
loss currently, not knowing where to turn to for guidance. When we review
the historical trends and changes described in previous sections, namely, the
crumbling of feudalism and the subsequent decline of Bushido, the quoted
prophecy of the appearance of new moral ethics, Notibe‟s hope for
Christianity to take over Bushido‟s role, yet its failure to spread, will the
Faith of Baha‟u‟llah not clearly stand out as the new ethics prophesied and
the new moral system which Nitobe hoped would appear and guide Japan?
For the Baha‟i Faith was revealed by Baha‟u‟llah for this new age where old
values would be tested for the contemporary need and diverse cultural
values would come into conflict with each other.
The teachings of Baha‟u‟llah renewed and revived virtues clothed in new
attire fit for the modern world. Baha‟u‟llah spoke the same truth which
Buddhism, Shintoism and Confucianism had taught centuries and thousands
of years before, yet in new language understandable to modern humanity.
Baha‟u‟llah talked about virtues that are universally applicable to all
humanity including women and men, young and old, and diverse ethnic
groups of the world. He also talks about the end of adolescent years of
humankind when wars and fighting were the “norms.” Baha‟u‟llah now
talks about the coming of age of humanity where humankind is to approach
various issues and problems with mature attitude and consultative manner.
Swords must be returned to the sheath and words must be used instead.
According to Baha‟u‟llah, even religions of God must be renewed and
updated. Buddhism and Shintoism have served their times, exerting great

influences on formation and development of Bushido. But the time must
come to be replaced by a new religion of God. Even Christianity had to face
the same destiny. Thus, religions of God must be periodically renewed in
order to meet needs of each age and place. The same exact medicine cannot
cure various diseases that afflict humanity. Humanity and its society also
grow and develop. Thus teachings of God must also change. This concept of
change of religious teachings according to growth and development of
humanity is called “progressive revelation.” The historical conditions of the
19th and 20th centuries clearly indicate that the time was very ripe for a new
revelation from God. According to Baha‟u‟llah, the Baha‟i Faith was the
new revelation for this modern age.
Conclusion

The form of Bushido has disappeared. There are no more samurai swords or
feudal system. However, the spirit of Bushido still seems to remain in minds
and hearts of Japanese people. The basis of Abdu‟l-Baha‟s prophecy that
Japan will turn ablaze may lie in this spirit of Bushido. Just as Nitobe said:

> Bushido as an independent code of ethics may vanish, but its power
> will not perish from the earth…Like its symbolic flower, after it is
> blown to the four winds, it will still bless mankind with the perfume
> with which it will enrich life.48

In conclusion, the present author would like to pose questions to the readers
by borrowing the words and style of Nitobe‟s own question quoted earlier:
The Faith of God revealed for this age and materialism will continue to
divide the world between them. Lesser systems of morals will ally
themselves to either side for their preservation. On which side will Japan
enlist? And on which side will the spirit of Bushido find its revival?
