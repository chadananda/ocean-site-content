> **Abstract:** The principle of collective security as adumbrated by Bahá’u’lláh and elaborated upon by 'Abdu’l-Bahá is a prerequisite for a lasting peace of the kind that has hitherto eluded humanity. Its application requires that the international community take a range of steps, including the gradual creation of an international standing force, agreement on the amount of arms that each nation may hold coupled with a binding agreement that breach of the peace by any one nation will result in collective action by all the others in accordance with pre-determined rules and procedures. In addition there must be a firm agreement on what to do about the development and stockpiling of nuclear weapons. Last, but not least, an effective international court with compulsory jurisdiction and binding judgment must be firmly established. This presentation offers concrete recommendations for the application of these broad principles in a manner that is actionable and politically palatable in today's world.

Collective Security
An Indispensable Requisite for a Lasting Peace

Sovaida Ma’ani Ewing

Introduction

Collective security is a term that can mean different things to
different people. For the purposes of this article, the term
encompasses the idea of an international agreement whose sole
purpose is to ensure the peace and security of all people. This
agreement is to be reached by a core group of world leaders who
are, in Abdu’l-Bahá’s words, “high-minded” and “distinguished,”
“shining exemplars of devotion and determination,” who arise
“with firm resolve and clear vision,” with the sole motive and
purpose of acting for “the good and happiness of all mankind”
and for the establishment of “Universal Peace” [SDC 64]. Once
agreement is reached, the core group will seek to have it ratified
by all nations resulting in an International covenant in which all
countries universally participate. A core provision of this
Covenant is that if a nation violates any of its terms thereby
disturbing the peace, all the other nations will arise as one, to
bring it to heel. This united response is to be carried out
applying pre-determined criteria and rules arrived at and
implemented collectively.

The need for this this kind of an International Covenant that
is collectively enforceable is evident when we consider the state
of the world today in which nations often engage in egregious
acts that break the peace and do so with impunity. We need
only consider the examples of nations that have illicit nuclear
weapons programs in direct contravention of international
laws, such as North Korea and Iran, or nations that engage in
gross human rights abuses of their populations like Sudan and

34                                     Lights of ‘Irfán Book Fourteen

Syria, or nations that openly sponsor terrorism, like Iran. The
fact that these examples are allowed to continue year after year
demonstrates the bankruptcy of the international security
system and the reality that the international community has
abdicated responsibility to do what is necessary to preserve
peace in this world for too long. Unfortunately, it is the
common people who have suffered as a result. Their suffering
has been widespread and prolonged. It is high time for all
nations to act in unity to create a system of collective security
that is both strong and flexible to meet the needs of our time.

Key Elements of a Viable System of Collective
Security

The most effective system of collective security is one that is
able to deter nations from breaching the peace and also to
effectively and swiftly restore the peace in those few instances
in which it is breached.

What We Need to Minimize the Risk of a Breach of
International Peace And Security

In order to forestall and prevent conflict and maintain the
peace, several requirements should be met. They are as follows:

Limit the Amount and Type of Arms Every Nation
Can Have

To minimize the risk that any nation will be tempted to
breach the peace, the amount [SDC 64] and type of arms each
nation may possess must be restricted. First, all nations must
agree, as matter of principle, to limit the amount of arms each
of them can have to that which they need to maintain internal
order and security within their borders [GWB CXVII, p. 249]. This
agreement must be embodied within the International
Covenant. Thereafter an International Commission should be
appointed to study the circumstances of each country and
determine what that amount should reasonably be for each
country. The Commission should undertake an investigation to
determine the amount of arms each nation actually possesses. A

Collective Security                                            35

plan should then be made for the destruction of that quantity of
arms that exceeds the amount deemed sufficient to maintain
internal order. Lastly, the process of arms’ destruction must be
supervised by an internationally appointed body so as to ensure
transparency and avoid arousing suspicion.

For this scheme to work, such agreement to limit the
possession of arms must apply to all countries without
exception. No country can be allowed to rely on a security
exclusion to opt out nor can any country be allowed to
withdraw from the agreement. Should a country be tempted to
do either, its action should be regarding as a threat to the peace
triggering collective enforcement action, a topic that is
discussed further on in this article.

Second, the international covenant must include a provision
to eliminate all nuclear weapons. There is no good reason for
any nation to possess nuclear weapons. Using them is
unthinkable and it is both unfair and ultimately impossible, as
humanity has discovered the hard way, to confine them to a few
countries. As long as even one nation has nuclear weapons,
others will want them for a host of reasons including at best the
insecurity they engender or at worst a desire to wield more
power and influence in the world. In addition to the elimination
of existing arsenals of nuclear weapons, all nations must agree
to stop developing and producing new weapons of mass
destruction as well as fissile material such as highly enriched
uranium and separated plutonium that can be used to produce
such weapons. Finally, countries must agree to put all facilities
and nuclear material needed for the creation of nuclear energy
under the management and control of a supranational body that
will ensure that they are used solely for the legitimate end of
making electricity to meet the energy demands of the planet. By
doing this, the risks of a nation secretly diverting an otherwise
legitimate energy-producing nuclear program for military
purposes will be eliminated.

Strengthen the International Court to Make it More
Effective and Trusted

Nations will inevitably have disputes, which must be
resolved. Our goal should be to ensure that they are resolved
peacefully, without resort to force and without degenerating
into destabilizing conflicts. In order for this to happen, nations
must be required to take their disputes to the International
Court Of Justice (also known as the “World Court”). In other
words, the World Court must be granted compulsory
jurisdiction over all disputes between countries to which all
nations must submit without exceptions and opt-outs. Moreover,
the judgments of the World Court must be binding upon the
parties to any conflict or dispute and capable of enforcement
by an international force. Without this, nations may choose to
ignore the World Court’s verdicts with impunity, thereby
undermining its credibility and increasing the chances of conflict.

In order for nations to agree to the strengthening of the
World Court in this way, the Court must command both the
respect and trust of all nations. This will only happen if it is
viewed as adequately representing all nations and its judges are
seen to be acting fairly and in the collective interest of the
community of nations. These judges must be unbiased and
beyond moral reproach. The key to creating this type of
confidence lies in the manner in which judges are elected to the
World Court. As an initial matter, it is important that they be
elected rather than appointed. The question then arises as to
how the international community might conduct an election
that ensures broad representation. The author of this article
believes that Bahá’í scholars can offer some useful ideas and
principles to the international community based on an
examination of the method Abdu’l-Bahá has proposed for the
eventual election of the “Supreme Tribunal.” Abdu’l-Bahá has
proposed a two-stage election of judges: the first step requires
the parliament of each country to elect two or three national
representative in direct proportion to the size of its population.
The election of these representatives is to be confirmed by the
legislature, the executive branch and head of state of each
country. Abdu’l-Bahá then goes on to suggest a second step in
which the members of the “Supreme Tribunal” are to be elected

Collective Security                                           37

from among these representatives, without specifying who the
electorate will be at this second stage [SWAB 306-307]. Although
we do not know when this “Supreme Tribunal” as envisioned by
Bahá’u’lláh and Abdu’l-Bahá will come into being, there is no
reason why we cannot use Abdu’l-Bahá’s proposed method for
electing its members as a blueprint from which we can derive
ideas and principles to share with the international community
which in turn can use them as it sees fit in order to bolster the
credibility and perceived trustworthiness of the World Court in
the eyes of the peoples of the world by making it increasingly
representative of all peoples and governments.

Once elected, the judges of the World Court must act
independently and free of political pressure or other. Their
appointments should be for a fixed term and they should be
banned from seeking future governmental appointments.

In the Event of a Breach of the Peace, What Is
Needed to Restore Peace Quickly and Effectively

Regardless of how strong and effective a well-crafted a
system of collective security is, it is unlikely to forestall all
conflict. There will probably be instances — hopefully rare — in
which a country will be tempted to act in ways that disrupt
international or regional peace. In those instances an effective
collective security system must be capable of swiftly bringing
the country to heel and restoring the peace for which it needs a
strong enforcement mechanism ideally in the form of a standing
international force.

Establish an International Standing Force

In the event that a nation violates one of the provisions of
the Covenant, thereby breaching the peace, or engages in
behavior that threatens peace such as sponsoring terrorist
groups, engaging in gross and widespread human rights abuses
or illegally producing and acquiring nuclear weapons, the
Security Council must have at its immediate disposal troops and
equipment ready to deploy rapidly and effectively to maintain
or restore the peace. Without such enforcement capability, the

38                                      Lights of ‘Irfán Book Fourteen

Covenant is a dead letter and the Security Council loses its
authority, effectiveness and credibility. Recent history is replete
with examples of an ineffectual and weak Security Council. A
few of these were mentioned above including the genocide in
Darfur, illegal nuclear weapons programs in North Korea and
Iran, and large-scale massacres and human rights abuses in Syria.

Many people and nations oppose the creation of an
international standing force because they fear it may run amok
and become a menace in the hands of a totalitarian world
government. In order to convince these skeptics that an
international standing force is vital to humanity’s well-being
and redounds to the best interests of all nations, they must first
be persuaded to embrace three foundational principles
articulated in the Writings.

The first principle is that force still has a role to play in
international relations with the caveats that it be used
collectively, in accordance with clear and pre-determined
guidelines and by collective institutions that truly represent all
the peoples of the world. In addition such force is to be used
solely in the service of justice. Abdu’l-Bahá speaks to this point
when He says that sometimes war is a “powerful basis of peace”
and “ruin the very means of reconstruction” [SDC 70]. He goes
on to say that if war is waged for a righteous purpose then “this
apparent tyranny [is] the very substance of justice and this
warfare the cornerstone of peace” [SDC 71].

An analogy that comes to mind in conveying the necessity for
the occasional collective use of force is that of chemotherapy —
a remedy consisting of harsh chemicals — that is nevertheless
used to rid the body of cancer. Although many healthy cells are
destroyed along with the cancerous ones, the alternative
strategy of doing nothing is not a viable one. The sacrifice of
some healthy cells is necessary for the greater goal of saving the
patient. If we focus on ensuring that all cells stay intact, we are
likely to lose the patient altogether.

The second principle is that national sovereignty must be
curtailed. This principle [WOB 40] was implicitly recognized in
the context of the use of force when the UN Charter was
crafted. The framers recognized there would be instances where

Collective Security                                           39

the use of force was necessary. They therefore made provision
for nations to enter into agreements with the Security Council
to contribute armed forces, assistance and facilities to the
Council for use in the event that the peace was threatened or
broken.1 Unfortunately, because of the unwillingness of nations
to forego their hold on absolute sovereignty especially in the
area of military power and more particularly in relation to the
composition, maintenance and location of forces, the relevant
provisions of the Charter were never implemented, thereby
severely weakening the effectiveness and authority of the
Security Council from its birth.

The third principle is that the good of the part can best be
reached by assuring the good of the whole [WOB 198]. In other
words, a nation can effectively guarantee its well-being, if it
assures the good of the community of nations as a whole. This
means that when there is a threat to the peace or a breach
thereof, the response must be a collective one, undertaken by
collective institutions such as a revamped Security Council and
a standing force that represent all the nations. Moreover, the
response must be in accordance with rules that have been
determined collectively in advance.

Once nations embrace these principles, they will more readily
accept the need for a standing force that is independent of the
whim of any one nation or group of nations and free of the
bane of expediency, as it unabashedly enforces the International
Covenant and upholds international law.

Determine the Criteria and Conditions for Use of a
Standing Force

In addition to creating an international standing force, it is
imperative that the criteria by which it can act to enforce the
peace be pre-determined by all nations collectively. Currently,
under the terms of the UN Charter, the Security Council may
use force in order to restore or maintain peace where there is a
threat to that peace, a breach of the peace or an act of
aggression.2 However, these terms are not defined. This is a flaw
that needs to be remedied. The definition should identify the
triggering circumstances under which a standing force can act

40                                      Lights of ‘Irfán Book Fourteen

and should include the following: gross human rights abuses
such as genocide, the illicit production, acquisition or sale of
nuclear capabilities in contravention of international laws, state
sponsorship of terrorism, a build-up of arms, territorial
aggression, failure to implement a judgment of the World
Court (especially where this is likely to give rise to conflict),
and breach of any provisions of the International Covenant.3

Gradual Steps Towards The Creation of A Standing
Force

As mentioned above, states are likely to be resistant to the
establishment of an international standing force. Therefore,
they might find it more palatable if this is done in incremental
steps. The first step proposed here would involve creating
regional security organizations each with their own standing
force. In this first stage all these regional standing forces would
coordinate their activities as part of a loose network
encompassing the planet. It will be easier for a nation to
embrace this step, as experience has demonstrated that it is
easier for nations to cede sovereignty over national security to a
regional organization than to an international one.4 This is so
for a number of reasons including the fact that language and
culture are often shared in a region creating more trust and
understanding. Also, a decentralized regional organization tends
not to raise the same feared specter as a distant centralized
authority making decisions from afar without an adequate
understanding of the facts on the ground and the potentially
adverse ramifications of its decisions. Moreover, there is a
stronger incentive for a nation to collaborate in preserving
regional security because it is more keenly and directly impacted
by things that go awry in its backyard and it is therefore in its
self-interest to engage in efforts to keep its region secure.

Once this loosely integrated network of regional security
organizations and attendant standing forces is established and
functioning for some time, the second step can be taken. This
step requires these regional security organizations to formalize
their relationship with the Security Council and make their
forces available for its use. This step has the added benefit that
the Security Council, with its finger on the security pulse of the

planet, can allocate primary responsibility for the security of
each region to the relevant regional security organization. The
operating principle would be that a threat to any one nation is
to be viewed as a threat to all in the region. However, before
using regional force in any given situation, the regional security
organization would first need to seek the approval of the
Security Council, as is currently required under the terms of the
UN Charter5 except in a dire emergency in which it could be
allowed to act first and seek ratification later. Finally, an
additional benefit in having the Security Council coordinate
security activities world-wide, is that it can specify a time frame
within which the regional force must solve the regional problem.
Then, in the event that the regional force is unable to meet the
deadline, the Security Council can call upon other regional forces
to lend their assistance. This kind of incremental solidarity in
solving problems will slowly create trust and teach regions of
the world to work together for the common cause of peace.

Eventually, the world would be ready for the third and final
step which would require consolidating and integrating the
various regional forces so that they function as permanent units
of a truly independent standing army each stationed in their
regional locations. Such an arrangement makes operational
sense in that the forces are physically close to conflicts that may
arise in their region and can therefore act more swiftly. It is also
makes more fiscal sense as it eliminates the costs of
transporting them over vast distances and setting up new
regional quarters every time there is a new conflict. At this
stage, these units will operate solely at the behest of the Security
Council and completely independently of the individual nations
or regional groups of nations. They will, however, engage in
regular joint training exercises, and have integrated
communications systems, compatible equipment and a shared
language so that they can work together in unity in a seamless
and effective fashion if needed.6

The Benefits of an International Standing Force

The creation of an international standing force will yield
many benefits. Among them is deterrence: nations are likely to
consider the consequences of collective action against them

before they flout international laws with impunity. Another
benefit is that the authority of international laws and
institutions will be upheld, not just in word, but also in
practice. In addition, having pre-agreed rules that determine
when the standing force can be used means that international
agencies like the Security Council, tasked with preserving the
peace of the planet can act quickly, decisively and effectively
without vacillating and nip a problem in the bud without
allowing it to fester and mushroom into a full-blown war. There
is also the added bonus that no one nation’s military is
overstretched nor does it have to bear an unfair and
disproportionate burden either financially or in human
resources. Last, but not least, such a collective system will
ensure that the rules are applied equally across the board to all
violators of the peace.

Conclusion

The world is in desperate need of an effective system of
collective security that will deter nations from entering into
conflicts and restore the peace in the rare event that it is
breached. The creation of such a system is not only possible but
inevitable. It requires that a handful of enlightened and
visionary leaders motivated solely by a desire for peace, enter
into an agreement to create such a system. To be effective, this
collective security system must at the very least, limit the
amount of arms each nation can have, eliminate all nuclear
weapons, strengthen the World Court and create an
incrementally integrated international standing force.
