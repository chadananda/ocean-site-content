> **Abstract:**  
>   
> Writing in the 1930's Shoghi Effendi stated that there are features and relationships in the Bahá'í Administrative Order that will be defined and analyzed by future generations. This article is a study of one such feature; that is, the mystical dimensions of the Bahá'í Administrative Order. The thesis is advanced that Bahá'u'llah has through the Covenant bequeathed to posterity "an excellent and priceless heritage." Through this heritage the wayfarer can encounter the Holy Outpouring (Fayd-i- Muqaddas). Whereas the Administrative Order is generally examined as a system of governance, this paper explores the Administrative Order as a mystical entity. It is generated through a "mystic intercourse" with Bahá'u'llah as the "active" (Pen) element and 'Abdu'l-Bahá as the "recipient" (Tablet) element. This mystic intercourse begets the Will and Testament that then becomes the Charter of the Administrative Order. The Bahá'i Administrative Order has a number of unique features when examined as a mystical entity, and this paper interrogates some parallels between it and Sufism (Islamic Spirituality) as alternative mystical paths. The implication for the human soul whether a believer, scholar or one serving on Administrative bodies is clear: the encounter with the Administrative Order is critical to the mystical path.

                      Mystical D imensions of the Admi nistrative Order

The Mystical Dimensions of the Bahá’í Administrative Order.

by Kavian Sadeghzade Milani

Introduction

eligious thought incorporates philosophy, theology and mysticism; indeed, the mystical experience is

R       integral to religious experience. Shoghi Effendi commented in a letter that “the core of religious Faith

is that mystic feeling which unites man with God.” He further notes in the same letter that “[t]he Bahá’í
Faith, like all other Divine Religions, is thus fundamentally mystic in character” (Spiritual Foundations #40).
Expanding this understanding of mysticism, religious scholar Annemarie Schimmel writes that mysticism “in
its widest sense . . . may be defined as the consciousness of the One reality—be it called Wisdom, Light, Love
or Nothing” (Mystical Dimensions of Islam 4) This consciousness cannot be reached by intellectual endeavors,
as it transcends human intellect and rationalization.1 The human heart, however, can engage in spiritual dis-
covery, and tread the mystic path. Mysticism, therefore, may be defined as the quest and journey of the human
soul towards its Creator. 2 In the Bahá’í context, this means that the human soul embarks on the mystical path
through the recognition of Bahá’u’lláh. Consequently, the psychology of the soul changes3 under both the
gnostic and volunteristic aspects of Bahá’í spirituality. 4 The copper of the soul is transmuted into gold in the
process of Divine alchemy and the ailments of the human soul are healed in remembrance of God. 5 The Bahá’í
Revelation invites all human souls to partake of this Divine Elixir.6

A significant portion of the writings of Bahá’u’lláh concerns mysticism. Both the theory (doctrine) and
method (practice) of the mystical experience are expounded. Many texts are primarily concerned with the mys-
tical path. The Hidden Words, The Seven Valleys, and The Four Valleys are s ome of the best-known represen-
tative Writings from this group.7 Even texts such as the Kitáb-i-Aqdas and the Kitáb-i-ˆqán, which are not pri-
marily intended to be mystical treatises, pres ent and treat a variety of mystical topics. There have been a num-
ber of recent attempts by Bahá’í scholars to examine the vast corpus of Bahá’í Writings concerning spiritual
and mystical topics. 8 As a whole, however, the author agrees with the assessment made by Jack McLean that
the mystical elements of the Bahá’í Faith remain under-explored.9

The Bahá’í Revelation presents to the wayfarer a variety of vehicles for the spiritual journey. The mystical
Writings of Bahá’u’lláh detail the spiritual path in sundry ways. 10 The Bahá’í Faith validates a number of spir-
itual and mystical practices as essential for one’s s piritual development, whereas some of the so-called mysti-
cal practices are discounted and even forbidden, such as mortification, mendicancy and poverty. The authenti-
cally spiritual practices are however confirmed and endorsed. The Obligatory Prayers (salát) are indispensable
to spiritual progress, as are the recitation of other prayers and meditations revealed by Bahá’u’lláh. The read-
ing of the verses of God every day and night provides the human soul with an “occasion of encounter with the
person of the divine Manifestation, Bahá’u’lláh.” 11 Fasting (sawm) and the daily invocation of “Alláh-u-Abhá”
are also integral to the Bahá’í mystical experience. Obedience to the laws and ordinances of Bahá’u’lláh key
to the Divine Elixir designed to transform the copper of the soul into gold. 12 Work itself is considered to be a
critical element in Bahá’í mysticism. 13 All of the above elements are generally acknowledged and well-appre-
ciated elements of Bahá’í spirituality. This article, however, will examine an element of the Bahá’í spiritual
experience which is often neglected with regards to its mystical dimensions: the Bahá’í Administrative Order.

The thesis that the Bahá’í Administrative Order is an instrument designed by Bahá’u’lláh for the mystic
wayfarer is the subject of this study. The Administrative Order has already been the subject of numerous aca-
demic examinations.14 Most such studies have focused on comparative political theory. To date, the mystical
dimensions of the Bahá’í Administrative Order remain largely unexplored. Some authors have acknowledged
such spiritual aspects, though. Jack McLean, for example, in his formulation of Bahá’í spirituality writes:

> For a Bahá’í, to further the aims and purposes of the Bahá’í revelation means to participate in the erection
> of a new society, whose blueprint the Central Figures of the Bahá’í Faith have drawn up and whose keynote
> is justice.

Lights of ‘Irfán

> This new society is Bahá’u’lláh’s new world order which is completely without parallel in the utopian soci-
> eties and systems of government that have evolved until the present day. This world system of Bahá’u’lláh,
> which exists today in embryonic form and whose Head is the Universal House of Justice, is the visible
> expression of all the intangible spiritual precepts and superlative teachings that Bahá’u’lláh has revealed
> to humanity.15

This article advances the thesis that the Administrative Order is an indispensable component of Bahá’í mys-
tical transformation. The author will first examine the theosophical framework and develop the nomenclature
required for the study of any mystical system. This theosophical foundation will then be applied to the creation
of the Bahá’í Administrative Order as a mystical entity.

Theosophy (Hikmat-i-Illáhí) and Mysticism (‘Irfán)

Any s erious examination of the mystical experience must take account of theosophical considerations. 16

Mysticism was earlier defined as the journey of the human soul towards God. Theosophy may be defined as
“that sacred philosophy which springs from such inward illumination; it is the mysticism of the mind as dis-
tinguished from the mysticism of the heart.” 17 Thus, theosophy can be equated with Hikmat-i-Illáhí (Divine
Wisdom, lit. Theo-sophia), as outlined in the Bahá’í Writings. It is within this framework that Bahá’í mystical
theory should be examined.18

In the Kitáb-i-ˆqán Bahá’u’lláh introduces three distinct forms of theophany. 19 The three are Universal
Revelation (Tajallíy-i-‘ám), the Holy Outpouring (Fayd-i-Muqaddas) and the Most Holy Outpouring (Fayd-i-
Aqdas).20 The Universal Revelation is that theophany by which God is manifested “upon the inmost reality of
each and every created thing . . . and made it a recipient of the glory of one of His attributes.”21 As such
Bahá’u’lláh declares, “ All created things eloquently testify to the revelation of that inner Light within them.” 22
This univers al theophany is available to all wayfarers, whether from within or outside the Bahá’í tradition and
the mystic should behold the inner mysteries enshrined in all things as he traverses the path. Such speculation
is integral to the Bahá’í spiritual experience.23 The Most Holy Outpouring on the other hand represents the
Specific Revelation of God (Tajallíy-i-Kháss). This theophany “is confined to the innermost Essence, unto
which no man can attain.”24 This Specific Revelation occurs in the realm of Absolute Oneness (Ahadiyyah)
where the names and attributes of God are indistinguishable from God’s Essence, and where God is both the
Lover and the Beloved. 25

The Holy Outpouring (Fayd-i-Muqaddas) that Bahá’u’lláh equates with the Secondary Revelation of God
(Tajallíy-i-Thání), however, is the theophany of immediate interest, as it refers specifically to Bahá’u’lláh’s
Revelation. This Holy Outpouring (Fayd-i-Muqaddas) belongs to “the realm of the primal and original mani-
festation of God.” 26 In Sufi terminology this Revelation is the locus through which the names and attributes of
God are manifested.27 This is in conformity with Bahá’í theology:

> These Prophets and chosen Ones of God are the recipients and revealers of all the unchangeable attribut-
> es and names of God. They are the mirrors that truly and faithfully reflect the light of God. Whatsoever is
> applicable to them is applicable to God, Himself, Who is both the Visible and the Invisible.28
The Secondary Revelation or Holy Outpouring has been identified with the “Supreme Pen,” the “First
Emanation of God,” and the “Creative B and E” in Sufi literature. 29 The above have all been identified with
Bahá’u’lláh in the Bahá’í Writings. 30 It is this theophany that Bahá’u’lláh directly represents. It is also through
this Holy Outpouring that the human soul encounters the Divine Elixir and embarks on the mystical path. Thus
the volunteristic and gnostic elements of the Bahá’í mystical experience are derived from Bahá’u’lláh. The
encounter of the human soul with the Holy Outpouring (Fayd-i-Muqaddas) in the Bahá’í Revelation is the spir-
itual dimension that is unique to the Bahá’í mystical experience. All the integral elements of the Bahá’í spiri-
tual path mentioned earlier have been directly derived from this Secondary Revelation. It is this same theo-
phany that generates the Bahá’í Administrative Order through the “mystic intercourse” described below.

The Pen-Tablet Interaction and the Generation of the Bahá’í Administrative Order

The Pen (qalam)/ Tablet (Lawh) interaction is a commonly utilized motif in the Bahá’í Writings. Both terms
occur frequently in Bahá’í scripture. Sometimes their use denotes literally a pen or a tablet, but often their

\[96\] Mystical D imensions of the Admi nistrative Order

meaning is symbolic, referring to Bahá’u’lláh and His Revelation. The Pen thus represents an active entity and
is generative, whereas the Tablet is passive in relation to the Pen and a recipient.31 The Pen generates the Tablet
itself. In the Tablet of Wisdom Bahá’u’lláh explains the creation of the world of exis tence using this same
motif:

> That which hath been in existence had existed before, but not in the form thou seest today. The world of
> existence came into being through the heat generated from the interaction between the active force and that
> which is its recipient. These two are the same, yet they are different.32

This is by no means the only application of this motif. For example, later in that same Tablet Bahá’u’lláh
elaborates on the Word of God as the originator of matter, through the creation of “Such as communicate the
generating influence and such as receive its impact” (fá‘ilayn va munfa’ilayn). These are generally taken to be
a reference to the four elements of air, water, fire and earth, whose active /recipient interactions beget all mat-
ter. 33

The Guardian applies the same motif to the generation of the Bahá’í Administrative Order. The passage
below from God Passes By describes the interaction between active and recipient forces, where Bahá’u’lláh is
the active force and ‘ Abdu’l-Bahá is the recipient entity. The text es tablishes the following relationship,

> The Will and Testament of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, on the other hand, may be regarded as the offspring resulting
> from the mystic intercourse between Him Who had generated the forces of a God-given Faith and the One
> Who had had been made its sole Interpreter and was recognized as its Perfect Exemplar. The creative ener-
> gies unleashed by the Originator of the Law of God in this age gave birth, through their impact upon the
> mind of Him Who had been chosen as its unerring Expounder, to that Instrument, the vast implications of
> which the present generation, even after the lapse of twenty-three years, is still incapable of fully appre-
> hending.34

The Fayd-i-Muqaddas (Holy Outpouring) or the Secondary Revelation of God is here stated to interact with
‘Abdu’l-Bahá through a “mystic intercourse.” This “mystic intercourse” begets the Will and Testament, which
is considered to be the charter for the Bahá’í Administrative Order. Therefore according to the text the Bahá’í
Administrative Order has an unequivocal mystical linkage to Bahá’u’lláh. Shoghi Effendi had already elabo-
rated on this in the Dispensation of Bahá’u’lláh a few years earlier:

> The creative energies released by the Law of Bahá’u’lláh, permeating and evolving within the mind of
> ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, have, by their very impact and close interaction, given birth to an Instrument which may be
> viewed as the Charter of the New World Order which is at once the glory and the promise of this most great
> Dispensation. The Will may thus be acclaimed as the inevitable offspring resulting from that mystic inter-
> course between Him Who communicated the generating influence of His divine Purpose and the One Who
> was its vehicle and chosen recipient. Being the Child of the Covenant—the Heir of both the Originator and
> the Interpreter of the Law of God—the Will and Testament of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá can no more be divorced from
Him Who supplied the original and motivating impulse than from the One Who ultimately conceived it. 35

This pas sage reiterates many of the points that the passage from God Passes By addressed. It establishes the
active/ recipient relationship again and outlines the “mystic intercourse” that generates the Will and Testament,
which is the charter for the Administrative Order. The Covenant between Bahá’u’lláh and every Bahá’í soul is
also incorporated into this “mystic intercourse” and preceded the birth of the Administrative Order. The criti-
cal function of the Covenant is suggested by the reference to the Will and Testament of ‘ Abdu’l-Bahá as the
“Child of the Covenant.”36 The Covenant of Bahá’u’lláh and the Administrative Order are thus inseparable.

In God Passes By Shoghi Effendi presents the exact point again, albeit using a different metaphor. There he
describes the embodiment of the Spirit of the Revelation of Bahá’u’lláh in the institutions of the Faith after the
passing of ‘ Abdu’l-Bahá:

> The moment had now arrived for that undying, that world-vitalizing Spirit that was born in Shíráz, that had
> been rekindled in Tihrán, that had been fanned into flame in Baghdad and Adrianople, that had been car-
> ried to the West, and was now illuminating the fringes of five continents, to incarnate itself in institutions
> designed to canalize its outspreading energies and stimulate its growth. (324)
> The analysis presented is of the pas sing of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá. It is generally understood that with the passing of

Lights of ‘Irfán

‘Abdu’l-Bahá the Bahá’í Faith emerged from a period of “charismatic” leadership and entered an “adminis-
trative” phase. Shoghi Effendi’s examination is somewhat different and conforms well to his thought analyzed
earlier: It was “that world-vitalizing Spirit” that incarnated itself in “institutions,” thereby establishing the con-
tinuity of the mystical linkage with Bahá’u’lláh.

The following passage is also of interest in this regard. It makes the point that an artificial separation
between the “spiritual” and the “administrative” aspects of the Cause is “tantamount to a mutilation of the
Cause.” He writes :

> To dissociate the administrative principles of the Cause from the purely spiritual and humanitarian teach-
> ings would be tantamount to a mutilation of the body of the Cause, a separation that can only result in the
> disintegration of its component parts, and the extinction of the Faith itself.” (Shoghi Effendi, The World
> Order of Bahá’u’lláh 5)

Mysticism, Law, Authority and the Bahá’í Administrative Order 37

As illustrated above, the Bahá’í Administrative Order was inaugurated by and derives its authority from the
Manifestation, and like other expressions of Bahá’í spirituality it is accommodated into the Bahá’í prophetic
schema without difficulty. 38 Two issues must be addressed at this point. The first concerns authority and divine
guidance in the Bahá’í Administrative Order. The other concerns the divine Law and the legislative compo-
nents of this Order. The issues of divine guidance, authority, and divine Laws are critical questions that every
mystical system must answer. This article will briefly examine how these issues were unders tood in Sufism
and Sufi Orders. Then the same questions will be raised regarding the Bahá’í Administrative Order as a mys-
tical system. 39 Authority and Divine guidance are important in any mystical quest as Trimingham points out in
connection to Sufism:

> Masters of the Way realized that the mystical tendency is highly dangerous as an individual experience,
> since the soul under the influence of a “state” is wide open to delusion and self-deception. There are mys-
> tic Ways to other gods than God.40

In Sufism mystical guidance was provided for the Sufi wayfarer through two interrelated sources: the Sufi
master and the Qutb (spiritual pole). The masters are essential for spiritual development as the following pas-
sage indicates:

> Connection to a master is considered a condition sine qua non for spiritual success. Without a master, with-
> out a guide, all illusions and all distractions are to be feared. This is what is meant by the well-known Sufi
> adage “who does not have a shaykh has Satan for his shaykh.”41

The masters are all inwardly connected with the Qutb (spiritual pole) of their age. The Qutb is the central
mystical locus of the Universe, from whom the masters derive their inspiration and authority. The wayfarer-
master-Qutb hierarchy is essential to the Sufi world-view. These dynamics were accepted despite the fact that
they find little textual justification in Islamic Scripture.42 The second problem addresses the tension between
the mystics and the jurists. It can be maintained that Sufism in general was observant of the Islamic legal ordi-
nances, and that Sufis were to observe religious Law. 43 It is generally acknowledged, however, that the focus
on the mystical de-emphasized the legal code and that more radical Sufism fostered and augmented anti-nomi-
an tendencies. 44 The gap between the legalistic and mys tical traditions in Islam was rarely bridged, and main-
stream Islam has always looked upon Sufism with a degree of suspicion.

The Bahá’í Administrative Order represents a unique synthesis compared with Sufism. The mystical forces
of the Bahá’í Revelation were channeled through the person of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá after the pas sing of Bahá’u’lláh.
Upon the pas sing of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá the “mystic intercourse” described above had taken place, and the Bahá’í
Administrative Order was begotten. In other words, the mystical encounter of the human soul with the Holy
Outpouring (Fayd-i-Muqaddas) becomes possible through the encounter with the Bahá’í Administrative Order.
Bahá’u’lláh had anticipated both the Universal House of Justice and the Bahá’í Administrative Order in the
Kitáb-i-Aqdas. 45 At present, the Universal House of Justice, designated by Bahá’u’lláh as the “Ark of God”
(Safínat’u’lláh) in the Tablet of Carmel, is the spiritual pole and the center of Bahá’í spirituality. According to
Shoghi Effendi, the Universal House of Justice is the one divinely appointed Center and the one expressly-des-
ignated pivot around which Bahá’í administration revolves. 46 The relationship between the human soul and the

\[98\] Mystical D imensions of the Admi nistrative Order

Universal House of Justice is secured through the Covenant. It has already been demonstrated that the
Covenant of Bahá’u’lláh is instrumental in the generation of the Bahá’í Administrative Order. The establis h-
ment of a covenant between the mystic and the object of mystical quest or the Pole (Qutb) is an integral part
of the mystical experience. In the case of the Bahá’í Administrative Order, the Covenant between Bahá’u’lláh
and the human soul also implies a relationship between that soul and the Universal House of Justice. This spir-
itual Covenant also serves to maintain the organic unity of the Bahá’í world.

All must seek guidance from the Universal House of Justice and turn to them. 47 The Will and Testament
maintains that the Universal House of Justice is “the source of all good and freed from all error” and that
“whatever they decide has the same effect as the Text itself.”48 “God will verily inspire them with whatsoever
He willeth” 49 as it serves to “insure the continuity of that divinely-appointed authority”50 from the source of
Revelation. This body also provides infallible guidance for Bahá’ís on “legislative and administrative ordi-
nances” and “may enact laws that are not expressly recorded in the Book.” 51 As such, the Universal House of
Justice represents a unique synthesis of the legislative and spiritual offices, naturally eliminating the tension
permeating Islamic spirituality described above. For the Bahá’í wayfarer the Universal House of Jus tice is not
a mere administrative organ elected in a three-tier process by universal suffrage; rather, it is a sanctified repos-
itory of divine guidance and the spiritual axis of the Bahá’í world. Accordingly, the establishment of a spiri-
tual connection between the heart of the mystic and the Universal House of Justice becomes an essential com-
ponent of the Bahá’í mystical experience.

The theoretical rather than the practical aspects of Bahá’í mysticism are the primary concern of this article.

However, the fact that the Universal House of Justice represents the axis par excellence of Bahá’í spirituality
should not be considered a mere theoretical or doctrinal element of the Bahá’í mystical experience. It has sig-
nificant practical implications for the manner in which one traverses the mystic path. The following is a high-
ly instructive example of the dynamics between a Bahá’í (and eventual martyr) and the Universal House of
Justice. It is selected from the introduction to a report written for and addressed to the Universal House of
Justice by Mrs. Jínús Mahmúdí, who at the time (1981) was an Auxiliary Board Member. The occasion for this
report was the arrest of the National Spiritual Assembly of the Bahá’ís of Iran in Augus t 1981. In it Mrs .
Mahmúdí records an interesting account of the individual members of the N.S.A. and provides unique insights
into the spiritual state of their meetings. It was written under circumstances of extreme danger. Both the rela-
tionship of the National Spiritual Assembly with the Universal House of Justice as well as her individual con-
nection to and understanding of the Supreme Institution of the Bahá’í Administrative Order are clearly con-
veyed in this report:

> May my life be sacrificed for you. We give thanks—We are content. You have said that whatever comes to
> pass is the will of God. Therefore we render thanks—We are content—We are servants—Just give us the
> strength to endure . . . Strengthen each one of us a thousand-fold so that we can withstand the onrush of
> the tribes of the earth, then we will like unto the mighty ocean send waves unto the shores of the East and
> the West.
> Your crazed lovers are now in the prison of love. That new creation that you yourself had created. Your
> guidance was not withheld from them even for a moment. Your love and your igniting words would cease-
> lessly arrive like copious rain. At first it caused their tears to flow, then it would set them on fire. Then it
> bestowed upon them freshness, subtlety, power and strength. This is how you created that new creation.
> When Husayn52 would call and say that there was a new message from the House of Justice they did not
> know how to get to the gathering. They began with prayers and supplications and then would consume your
every word with all their existence. They derived new life from it and prepared for sacrifice. 53

The implications for the mystic wayfarer are very real. Thes e souls entered the field of martyrdom inspired
and s trengthened by the Universal House of Justice. Their connection to the axis of Bahá’í spirituality allowed
for their mystic union with the Beloved. 54

The Feast

The Bahá’í Administrative Order encompasses all Bahá’ís at the level of the nineteen-day Feast. This insti-

Lights of ‘Irfán

tution is established in the Kitáb-i-Aqdas:

> Verily, it is enjoined upon you to offer a feast, once in every month, though only water be served; for God
> hath purposed to bind hearts together, albeit through both earthly and heavenly means. 55

The Feast is the bedrock of Bahá’í administration. The Feas t also serves to remove barriers and unite the
community at grass roots, and as such is rendered non-elitist. It is a sacred practice with significant spiritual
and devotional character.56 It has authentic counterparts in other mystical schools , such as in Sufism where reg-
ular spiritual meetings entitled majlis (pl. majális) are held “for the purpose of reading instructive texts, invo-
cation, and singing.” 57 The well-known Sufi practice of samá‘ (spiritual concert) is an example of such spiri-
tual meetings. 58 These sessions were the source of inspiration and ecstasy for the Sufis, and they began with
and ended with Quránic recitation. The Bahá’í nineteen day Feas t likewise is intended for inspiration and
uplifting. ‘ Abdu’l-Bahá elaborates on this theme as follows:

> The believers of God must assemble and associate with each other in the utmost love, joy, and fragrance.
> They must conduct themselves (in these Feasts) with the greatest dignity and consideration, chant divine
> verses, peruse instructive articles, read the Tablets of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, encourage and inspire each other with
> love for the whole human race, invoke God with perfect joy and fragrance, sing the verses, glorifications,
> and praises of the Self-Subsistent Lord, and deliver eloquent speeches. The owner of the house must per-
> sonally serve the beloved ones. He must seek after the comfort of all, and with the utmost humility he must
> show forth kindness to every one. If the Feast is arranged in this manner and in the way mentioned, that
supper is the “Lord’s Supper,” for the result is the same result and the effect is the same effect.59

‘Abdu’l-Bahá envisions music as an element of the Feas t. Bahá’í scholars have acknowledged the impor-
tance of music in the Bahá’í spiritual experience. 60 This s uggests a prominent role for music in the Bahá’í
Feast. In short the Feast, as an integral component of the Bahá’í Administrative Order, presents an occasion
for spiritual development for the soul.

The Rulers (Umará’) and the Learned (‘Ulamá)

Bahá’u’lláh has called for two branches of the Bahá’í Administrative Order in the Kitáb-i- ‘Ahdí (Book of
My Covenant): the Rulers (Umará) and the Learned (‘Ulamá).61 The Universal House of Justice has stated that
the “distinction is that whereas the ‘rulers’ function as corporate bodies, the ‘learned’ operate primarily as indi-
viduals.” The administrative functions of both branches are clearly defined and delineated in the Bahá’í
Writings as well as in the writings of the Guardian and the Universal House of Justice. Both branches are inte-
gral to the theory and practice of Bahá’í spirituality. The members of the Local Spiritual Assembly for exam-
ple “should consider thems elves as entering the Court of the Presence of God, the Exalted, the most High, and
as beholding Him Who is the Uns een” as ordained by Bahá’u’lláh in the Kitáb-i-Aqdas. 62 They are to serve
both the individual Bahá’í and the community at large as “channels of divine guidance.”63 This branch of the
Bahá’í administration is unique in terms of mystical guidance compared to other schools of mystical thought,
with respect to even though one finds parallels between the “rulers ” and the function of the spiritual master in
general.

It is the “learned” arm of the Bahá’í administration, however, that parallels the function of the Sufi master
most closely, and as such it is also integral to the Bahá’í mystical experience. This arm consists of the Hands
of the Cause, the Continental Board of Counselors and the Auxiliary Board. The functions of the Hands of the
Cause as delineated in the Will and Testament are:

> The obligations of the Hands of the Cause of God are to diffuse the Divine Fragrances, to edify the souls
> of men, to promote learning, to improve the character of all men and to be, at all times and under all con-
> ditions, sanctified and detached from earthly things. They must manifest the fear of God by their conduct,
> their manners, their deeds and their words.64

The functions of the “Hands” as expounded above are clearly similar to that of the Sufi master as examined
earlier. 65 These same functions of the Hands of the Cause are carried into the future by the Continental Board
of Counselors, and their Auxiliary Board. Therefore the term “learned” has been applied to the Hands of the
Cause, Counselors, and Auxiliary Board members.

\[100\] Mystical D imensions of the Admi nistrative Order

> The Hands of the Cause of God, the Counselors and the members of the Auxiliary Board fall within the
> definition of the “learned” given by the beloved Guardian. Thus they are all intimately interrelated and it
> is not incorrect to refer to the three ranks collectively as one institution.
However, each is also a separate institution in itself.66

The two arms of the Bahá’í Administrative Order are critical components of Bahá’í spirituality, both in mys-
tical method and mystical theory. The “learned” derive their authority and inspiration from the Universal
House of Justice in the same manner that the Sufi masters derive their authority from the Qutb. The following
comments by the Universal House of Justice regarding the two arms of administration, however, must be kept
in mind, where they indicate the supreme synthesis incorporated in the administrative s tructures of the Bahá’í
Faith.

> The newness and uniqueness of this concept make it difficult to grasp; only as the Bahá’í Community
> grows and the believers are increasingly able to contemplate its administrative structure uninfluenced by
> concepts from past ages, will the vital interdependence of the “rulers” and the “learned” in the Faith be
> properly understood, and the inestimable value of their interaction be fully recognized.67

The “newness” of this synthesis makes it difficult to fully comprehend. The Bahá’í mystic therefore stands
in need of a new frame of reference, as there is nothing in our known ancient and traditional spiritual heritage
that can fully compare with the Bahá’í Administrative Order. 68 This new paradigm requires that every Bahá’í
individual heed this pas sage from the Lawh-i-Hikmat: “Abase not the s tation of the learned in Bahá and belit-

Of particular importance for the mystic wayfarer is the distinction between the two Sufi notions of hál (spir-
itual state) and qál (speech). Hál refers to inner and authentic spiritual state of the wayfarer, whereas qál is
what one utters by mouth. The former is a genuine spiritual and internal phenomenon, whereas the latter is an
external one. Sufi literature favors the inner spiritual state, which is “real” over the spoken or outer, which may
or may not reflect the inner reality. An example occurs in the narrative of Moses and the Shepherd in Rumi’s
Mathnaví where God teaches Moses the distinction.

> We look not at the exterior and the speech (qál),
> We behold the inner and the state (hál).70

This distinction is maintained in the Bahá’í Writings,71 for the inner state is emphasized in all matters per-
taining to the Bahá’í mystical experience rather than the outer aspects. For example, if a pers on should go
through the motions of the obligatory prayer carelessly and without any spiritual connection, that prayer may
not bring about the desired mystical experience. 72 The Bahá’í administrative Order is also an agent for trans-
formation of the human soul, and much like other spiritual practices can only function as such if engaged in
with spirituality and with a pure intention. It is the duty of every Bahá’í wayfarer to engage the Bahá’í admin-
istration as an authentic hál experience rather than a qál one. Thus, the individual cannot practice adhering to
the letter of the law with regards to the Bahá’í Adminis trative Order and not the spirit. Only then can the Bahá’í
administration be a component of the Bahá’í spiritual experience. The following passage on behalf of Shoghi
Effendi touches on the same point:

Laws and institutions, as viewed by Bahá’u’lláh, can become really effective only when our inner spiritual
life has been perfected and transformed. Otherwise religion will degenerate into a mere organization, and
becomes a dead thing. (Spiritual Foundations: Prayer, Meditation, and the Devotional Attitude #40)

Conclusion

Writing in the 1930s, Shoghi Effendi stated that there are features and relationships in the Bahá’í
Administrative Order that will be defined and analyzed by future generations. This article is a study of one
such feature—the mystical dimensions of the Bahá’í Adminis trative Order. The thesis is advanced that
Bahá’u’lláh has through the Covenant bequeathed to pos terity “an excellent and priceless heritage.” 73 Through
this heritage the wayfarer can encounter the Holy Outpouring (Fayd-i-Muqaddas). The Bahá’í Administrative
Order has a number of unique and key features when considered as a mystical entity, one of which is the inclu-

Lights of ‘Irfán

sion of all at the level of the Feast. The full spectrum of this topic cannot be explored in this article. The read-
er is invited to consider this thesis in light of the scriptural evidence beyond those presented here. The impli-
cation for the human soul whether as one serving on administrative bodies or otherwise is clear: the encounter
with the Administrative Order is critical to the mystical path.

Notes
1) This is not a concept peculiar to the Bah á’í trad ition. For example, The Cambr idge Dictionary of Philosophy 51 5 defines my sti-

> cism as “a doctrine or discipline maintain ing that one can gain knowledge of reality not access ible to sense perception or to
> ration al conceptual th ought.” See the Seven Valleys p. 33 fo r an elab oration o n this theme by Bah á’u’lláh.
2) Bahá’í though t maintains that the chief endo wmen t of the human being is the rational so ul (nafs-i-nátiqah) also iden tified with

> the human spirit (rúh-i-insání). Onto logically, the hu man sou l is at the end of the Arc of Descent, an d at the beginning of the
> Arc of Ascent, which is the initiation of the spiritual journey (Some Answered Questions 285-86).
3) Traditional Sufi teachings describe an elaborate psychology (ma‘rifat an -na fs). In this sys tem, which is bas ed o n Qu ránic nomen -

> clature, the soul (nafs) progres ses from the nafs -i-a má rah (the co mmandin g soul) to the nafs-i-mutma’inah (the confirmed soul)
> and the nafs-i-mard iah (that has attained Divine good-pleasure). The Su fi s cience of the sou l is treated in adequate detail in
> Islamic Spir itua lity: Foun datio ns 294 -30 7. Bahá’u’lláh has acknowledged and confirmed Sufi psychology (cf. Majmú‘iy-i-
Alwáh-i-Hadr at-i-Bahá’u’lláh 97). Bahá’u’lláh has els ewhere markedly s implified the Bahá’í science of the s oul:

> Much hath been written in the books of old concernin g th e various s tages in the develo pment of t h e soul, such as co n-
> cupiscence, irascibility, inspiration, ben evolen ce, conten tment, Divine good-Pleas ure and the like; The Pen of the Most
> High, howev er is disinclined to dwell upo n them. Every sou l that walk eth humbly with its God, in this Day, and cleaveth
> unto Him, shall find its elf invested with the hon or an d glo ry of all goodly names and stations (Gleanings 159).
4) Schimmel divides the mystical approaches into the “volunteristic” and the “gnostic.” The volunteristic mys tic aims to p osses the

> attributes of God , whereas th e g nostic mystic attempts to obtain a d eeper knowledge of God (Mystical Dimensio ns of Islam 6).

Both elements are ex plicitly p resent in the Bahá’í Writing s.

> 5) Hidd en Words o f Bahá ’u’lláh, from the Pers ian, passage nu mber 32.
6) Along the way, as the soul begins to ch ang e, the individu al experiences new unders tandings of the self and its relations hip to

> other individuals as well as to God. It is this bro ad complex of tran sformed spiritual attitudes and understandings th at I will call
> mystical experience.
7) A multitude of other key tablets also p resent and elab orate u pon th e mystical dimens ions of the Bah á’í Revelation. The Qasídiy-

> i-Varqá’íyyih and Mathnaví are two s uch tab lets. It is regrettable th at the scholarly commu nity in general has not accord ed thes e
> Tablets the clos e attention that they merit, from th e standpoint of mystical content and teachings as well as the literary form.

39) As Sufism is no t the focu s of this article experts will no doubt find this treatment of the Sufi content su perficial. The point o f

the comp aris on is ho wever to demon strate how these issu es h ave been synth esized in the Bahá’í Adminis trative Order. The Sufi

Orders (Tá’ifas) themselves are later developments in Sufism. Trimingh am points out:

> The fo undation o f the orders is the s ystem and relations hip of master an d disciple, in Arabic murshid (d irecto r) and muríd
> (as pirant). It was natural to accept the authority and guidance of thos e who had traversed the s tages (maqámát) of the

There have been a nu mber of studies on th ese Sufi Ord ers. The most comprehensive to date is that of Triming ham entitled Sufi

Orders in Islam. Mo re recent treatments are found in Is lamic Sp irituality: Manifestations.

45 See for example the Kitáb-i-Aqdas parag raphs 4 2 and 3 0. The twin pillars of this Order are Guardians hip and th e Univ ersal

60) See Rafati in Khúshihá-í az Kharman-i-Adab va Hunar 2:27-28, where the fo llowing pas sage from the Kitáb-i-Aqdas (para-
graph 51 ) is suggested regarding the role of music in the Bahá’í spiritual ex perience:

> We have made it lawful for yo u to listen to music and singing. Take heed, h owever, lest listen ing to thereto shou ld cau se

> made mus ic as a ladder for your souls , a means wh ereby they may be lifted up unto the realm on high ; make it n ot, th ere-
> fore, as wing s to self and p ass ion.
61) Cf. Tablets of Bahá’u’lláh 221, where it is written :

> It is incumb ent upo n everyone to aid thos e dayspring s of au thority and sources of command wh o are adorned with the
> ornament of eq uity and justice. Blessed are the rulers an d th e learned amon g th e peop le of Bahá.. They are M y trus tees

Sho ghi Effendi has provided the following clarification on these twin arms of Bahá’í Administration,

In th is h oly cycle th e “learned ” are, on the one hand, the Hand s of the Cause of God, and , on the other, the teachers and

65) The comparison weak ens when the entire scope of the activities of the Hands of th e Cau se are con sidered . The institution of the
