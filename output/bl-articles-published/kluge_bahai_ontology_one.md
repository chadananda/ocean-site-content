          Bahá’í Ontology: An Initial
R ec onnais s anc e

by I a n Kl uge

Intr oducti on

The purpose of this paper is to examine the Bahá’í Writings to
discover the nature of the ontology they embody. However, in a
single paper, this project can only be an “initial reconnaissance,” a
scouting of the territory to discover some of its most prominent
features. A full and more complete examination awaits a book-
length study.

The main value of this project is that an ontology, like a
constitution, provides a philosophical frame of reference within
which various ideas take on meaning. Any exposition of the
Writings or any Bahá’í-based philosophizing must harmonize with
this ontological ‘constitution’, or at least, be neutral and not offend
against its general principles. Thus, like any other constitution, a
Bahá’í ontology provides a particular philosophical identity that
distinguishes the Writings from other sacred books or the
foundational books of various philosophies and ideologies. Clear
knowledge of this identity lays the foundations for detailed and in-
depth dialogue with other religious and secular belief systems.

1\. W hat is Ontol o gy?

Ontology is the study of being and what it means to say that
something ‘is’ or ‘exists’. As a branch of metaphysics1, the study of
the most general principles of reality, ontology specifically concerns
itself with the most fundamental questions about the nature of
existence. It focuses on questions related to being, such as what
precisely does it mean ‘to be’?; “why is there anything at all rather
than nothing?”2; what exists?; what kind of things are there?; do all
things have ontological parity? and what is the relationship between
being and becoming? 3 While far from complete, this list of
questions provides at least a sense of the ontological enterprise.

2\. Do the Bahá ’í Writings Have an Ontol ogy?

As the following example illustrates, the Bahá’í Writings
definitely embody an ontology. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá says that “the rational
soul is the substance, and the body depends upon it. If the accident
— that is to say, the body — be destroyed, the substance, the spirit,

122 Bahá’í Ontology

remains.” (SAQ 239) This statement commits the Writings to the
existence — in some form — of spiritual substances such as the soul4,
and to material substances such as the body. Moreover, it defines the
body, and perhaps matter in general, as an “accident”5, as a particular
kind of attribute or quality of a spiritual substance. Because the soul
is the substance and the body the attribute or accident, they
obviously have different ways or modes of existing: the ‘accidental’
body is in a relationship of existential dependence upon the soul,
which it needs to exist. This suggests that the soul does not depend
on the body for its existence — though it may depend on the body
for its appearance in the world of matter — which allows the soul or
substance to survive the dissolution of the body. Already at this
point we have dealt with such questions as ‘what kind of things
exist?’, ‘do all things have ontological parity?’ and ‘what does it
mean to be as a substance?’

Although philosophical study of the Bahá’í Writings is in its early
phases, it seems certain they embody a systematic ontology. As this
paper shall demonstrate, it is already possible to discern the
parameters of the system. The outward presentation of the Writings
— tablets, talks, letters — should not be interpreted as a lack of
coherent, systematic thought, since these various presentational
forms are united by a network of identifiable themes and principles.

3\. The Language o f Ba há ’í Ontol o g y

Careful analysis shows that to an almost overwhelming extent,
the Writings use a philosophical language and concomitant concepts
that overlap with the philosophical tradition begun with the work of
Plato, Aristotle and Plotinus.6 A list of these includes essence;
substance; essential attribute; attribute; accident; potential; the
prime mover argument; emanation; planes of existence; material,
efficient, formal and final causes; the mineral, plant, animal, human
kingdoms; contingent and necessary being; this world being an
image of a higher world; the concept of the rational soul; an
unknowable God and change as the actualization of potentials.
These terms and concepts are used in a manner fully consistent with
what we find in the original works of Plato, Aristotle and Plotinus.
Moreover, the terms and concepts are used in a consistent manner
throughout the Writings.

How are we to interpret the consistent use of this philosophical
language? In our view, the Bahá’í Writings plainly endorse many of
the ontological principles and ideas found in this tradition as the
basis for further philosophizing. Of course, this is not to imprison
future philosophical developments in ancient ideas, for as the work

Lights of ‘Irfán Book Six 123

of Whitehead, de Chardin, the neo-Thomists and Ken Wilber shows,
this tradition is capable of highly diverse developments.

There are two main reasons for taking this position. The first is
the sheer pervasiveness of the use of Platonic, Aristotelian and
Plotinian terminology and concepts in the Bahá’í Writings. It is
extremely unlikely that such a far-reaching overlap of terminology
and concepts is merely a matter of accident. The literary and
philosophical sophistication of the Writings show that the authors
were obviously in full and complete control of their diction and
chose it because they always had a specific purpose in mind. We
must also remember that the Writings of Bahá’u’lláh, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá
and Shoghi Effendi cover a century: in other words, this consistency
of diction spans four generations of writers expounding their
teachings in very different circumstances, to very different
audiences at very different times. This is unlikely to be mere
happenstance.

The second reason for concluding that the language of this
tradition was chosen intentionally lies in the inherent weakness of
the counter-arguments, of which there are basically two. The first is
that the philosophical concepts and terms were chosen as a means of
communicating with a specific audience in its own terms. While this
argument might possibly have some merit so far as Middle Eastern
audiences of the time were concerned, it does not apply to western
or other non-western audiences. In the West, since the time of
Galileo and Descartes in the 17th Century, the Platonic-Aristotelian
tradition was scientifically and philosophically discredited most
particularly in the areas of prime interest, physics, metaphysics,
epistemology and ontology. Since that time, despite the efforts of
neo-Thomists7 and neo-Aristotelians8, the philosophy of this
tradition has never been a part been a part of mainstream
philosophy. Therefore, we must conclude that if Bahá’u’lláh,
‘Abdu’l-Bahá and, through his use of quotation, Shoghi Effendi
intended to use the language of Plato, Aristotle and Plotinus to
reach western audiences of the 19th and 20th centuries, they
miscalculated grievously. For a Bahá’í scholar, the notion that a
Manifestation of God and His chosen interpreters err so completely
is not tenable for theological reasons but even a non-Bahá’í scholar
would have enormous difficulties in supporting such a conclusion on
non-theological grounds. Consequently, it seems almost certain that
the choice of philosophical tradition is intended as guidance for
future Bahá’í-based philosophizing.

A similar argument applies to reaching non-western audiences
outside of the Muslim world. Here too, the argument that this
language was chosen to facilitate communication fails because these
peoples were wholly unfamiliar with the Platonic-Aristotelian-

124 Bahá’í Ontology

Plotinic tradition. Initially, at least, such language is bound to be a
barrier, a barrier that could be overcome only by a careful study of
this tradition as presented in the Writings. Furthermore, it makes no
sense to put these non-western peoples to so much trouble if there
were no special value in doing so.
3\.1. Making t h e Tradition and Language Ne w

The second argument against the view that the Writings’ use of
the Platonic-Aristotelian-Plotinic tradition is intentional is that in
Bahá’u’lláh’s dispensation, God has “instilled into every word a fresh
potency.” (GWB 92-3) For these reasons, the Writings cannot belong
to an ‘outmoded’ tradition. This argument has two decisive
weaknesses. First, it cannot be rationally denied that this argument
notwithstanding, textual analysis shows that the Bahá’í Writings do
in fact, use the terminology and concepts of this tradition in the way
that is consistent with their original usages. A secular scholar would
describe this as a conceptual continuity, whereas a Bahá’í scholar
would say this is confirmation of some of the tradition’s
philosophical insights. Second, Bahá’u’lláh’s confirmation of this
tradition does not necessarily imprison our understanding in the
work of the ancients. Whitehead, de Chardin, Wilber, and the neo-
Thomists irrefutably demonstrated that this tradition is enormously
flexible, capable of considerable growth and has, indeed, received a
“fresh potency.” (GWB 92-3)

4\. The Bedr ock Princi pl e of Ba há’í Ontol ogy :
Ontol og ical Dualism o f Creator and Created

This paper contends that the bedrock of Bahá’í ontology is the
principle of ontological dualism between the Creator and the
created. It rejects any form of ontological monism — a substantial
identity and/or one-ness of being9 — between God and creation. God
and creation are so fundamentally different in their substance and
modes of being that between them there exists an unbridgeable gulf
denying any possibility of a direct connection, let alone substantial
unification. As Bahá’u’lláh says, “there can be no tie of direct
intercourse to bind the one true God with His creation, and no
resemblance whatever can exist between the transient and the
Eternal, the contingent and the Absolute.” (GWB 66, emphasis
added10) ‘Abdu’l-Bahá also states categorically that the “Preexistent is
different from the phenomenal, and the phenomenal is opposed to
the Preexistent.” (SAQ 293)

Because of the vast ontological gulf between the two11 — a
difference of kind, not of degree — it is impossible for God to
become man as held by some mystics and by Christian
incarnationism. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá describes this view, which He

Lights of ‘Irfán Book Six 125

identifies with the Sufis as “evident error.” (SAQ 195) There is no
way that “the Preexistent should confine itself to phenomenal
forms.” (SAQ 195) He also rejects the view that man may become
God, asking rhetorically, “[H]ow can the phenomenal reality
embrace the Preexistent Reality?” (SAQ 221) Bahá’u’lláh makes the
same point when He says, “no soul hath ever found the pathway to
His Being ... every saint hath lost his way in seeking to comprehend
[contain, encircle] His Essence.” (SVFV 23, emphasis added) He re-
enforces this point by asking rhetorically, “How can utter
nothingness gallop its steed in the field of preexistence?” (SVFV 23)
The ontological difference between Creator and created cannot be
overcome by mere human effort.

Ontological monism undermines Bahá’í theology because it
makes Manifestations superfluous as mediators between God and
humankind. If human beings can actually or substantially become
one with God, then there is no need for Manifestations to guide us
to the divine. For this reason, ontological monism undermines the
rationale of all revelational religion.

Moreover, ontological monism also ignores logic. First, if man
truly becomes ontologically one with the Creator, then the claimant
in effect becomes his own creator, which is to say, he exists before
he exists — since God logically precedes all other beings. This is not
logically possible. Second, the relationship of dependence on God
can never be revoked or negated in any way. God is the perpetually
indispensable ‘necessary and sufficient condition’ for the existence
of anything other than Himself. Consequently, there is no possible
point of view, position or stand-point within creation where the
distinction between Creator and created is overcome and
dependence on God is negated.

To claim otherwise — as ontological monism does — is, in effect,
to claim ontological parity with God and to ignore Bahá’u’lláh’s
assertion that “He hath assigned no associate unto Himself in His
Kingdom ... (GWB 192, emphasis added) It also violates Bahá’u’lláh’s
injunction not to “transgress the limits of one’s own rank and
station.” (GWB 188) The principle of adhering to one’s appropriate
station is so strict in the Bahá’í view that even after death, the soul
“never leaves its own condition.” (SAQ 233)

Another major problem with ontological monism is that it
violates the principle of the unknowability of God, since actually
(i.e. substantially) becoming one with something entails inner or
subjective knowledge of it and its condition. However, in the
“Commentary on the Islamic Tradition, ‘I was a Hidden Treasure...’”,
‘Abdu’l-Bahá categorically states His own position that “the path to
knowing the innermost Essence of the Absolute is closed to all

126 Bahá’í Ontology

beings ... How can the reality of non-existence ever understand the
ipseity of being?”12 Since the knowledge of God is utterly impossible
for “all beings” then no one — regardless of spiritual condition — can
attain the necessary and sufficient conditions for obtaining such
knowledge, which in effect denies the possibility of unity with God.
Moreover, such knowledge is also impossible because
“encompassment”13 is one criteria of knowledge: “until one thing
encompasses another, it cannot understand its inner nature.”14 The
problem for ontological monism is that according to ‘Abdu’l-Bahá,
“the limited can never comprehend, surround nor take in the
unlimited.” (PUP 422, emphasis added) This categorical statement is
itself enough to completely negate any conclusion about the equal
validity of ontological monism and dualism in Bahá’í ontology.

We must, however, remember that the denial of ontological
union or oneness with God does not preclude an ethical oneness in
which man submits to or harmonizes his personal will with the will
of God. This ethical monism is not only allowed but even
encouraged by the Writings as an essential human goal.
Nevertheless, we must not misinterpret this ethical harmonization as
an ontological union.
4\.1. Apparent ly Monist Passages

It may be argued that the Bahá’í Writings contain passages
suggesting ontological monism, as, for example, Bahá’u’lláh’s
injunction, “Turn thy sight unto thyself, that thou mayest find Me
standing within thee.” (HW Arabic 7) However, this passage is not
really monist. Because we can find God’s omnipresent presence
reflected in the mirrors of our hearts15 does not mean that we have
become ontologically one with God’s Being. Moreover, this passage
maintains the distinction between the perceiver and the perceived
(God) — a fact which effectively precludes a monist interpretation
since monism vitiates the distinction between perceiver and
perceived.

The Seven Valleys and the Four Valleys16 contains another
seemingly monist passage: some wayfarers behold various colors, but
“some have drunk of the wine of oneness and these see nothing but
the sun itself.” (SVFV 20-1) A careful reading of this passage shows
that its concern is epistemological — visionary — and not ontological,
it is about perceiving, not about the being of that which is
perceived. To be ontologically monist, this passage would have to
assert that “the place of appearance” (SVFV 20) and the sun itself are
actually one and that the perceiver, the person who gazes, is
substantially one with the perceived. However, it is obvious that the
preservation of the perceiver/perceived distinction precludes a
monist interpretation of this passage.

Lights of ‘Irfán Book Six 127

The following passage is also quoted to support ontological
monism:17 “Yea, all he [the seeker] hath, from heart to skin, will be
set aflame, so that nothing will remain save the Friend.” (SVFV 36-7)
Nothing in these or immediately subsequent statements suggests that
the seeker becomes ontologically one with God since neither the
passing away of the world or self nor the loss of awareness of self
and world as separate entities necessarily implies actual, substantial
one-ness.

Finally, it is claimed that the Bahá’í belief that only God has
absolute existence is “in essence a monist position.”18 Such is far
from being the case. First, God’s absolute existence implies the
(relative) nothingness of contingent creation, not the ontological
identity of creation with God. Indeed, to insist on such identity is, in
effect, to insist that God — like creation — is nothing and that
creation — like God — is absolute. Both positions are untenable for
Bahá’ís. Second, the assertion of ontological one-ness between
Creator and created implies that God is somehow present, albeit in
different forms, in His creation. This position would be “appearance
through manifestation” (SAQ 203) which ‘Abdu’l-Bahá categorically
rejects as “quite impossible.” (SAQ 203)
4\.2. T h e F ailure to Reconcile Monism an d Du alism

Given this rejection of ontological monism in favor of
ontological dualism, how are we to understand Dr. Moojan
Momen’s claim that the two positions are reconciled in ‘Abdu’l-
Bahá’s “Commentary on the Islamic Tradition: ‘I Was a Hidden
treasure’”? According to Dr. Momen, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá adopts a
relativist approach to achieve “a reconciliation of the dichotomy”19
between an ontological dualism asserting that “there is a
fundamental difference between the human soul and the Absolute”20
and an ontological monism stating that “there is no fundamental
difference between the human soul and the Absolute.”21 But is this
really the case? After His exposition of both apparently monist and
dualist views, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá says,

> But to this servant all these expositions and questions,
> stations and states are complete in their own station
> without defect or flaw. For although the object being
> viewed is the same, nevertheless the viewpoints and
> stations of these mystic knowers is different. Each
> viewpoint, with respect to the person who is in that station
> is perfect and complete.22

Analysis shows that ‘Abdu’l-Bahá strictly confines His remarks to
the subjective criteria for truth: given their own presuppositions and
criteria, the advocates of each viewpoint reason correctly and attain
a conclusion that is consistent with their spiritual conditions as

128 Bahá’í Ontology

“knowers.” In other words, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s argument is subjectively
epistemological — concerned with the “knowers” and not with what
is objectively known, with the perceiver and not with the perceived.
He is not talking about what actually is the case but rather about
what the viewer thinks is the case because of his presuppositions,
nature and spiritual condition. Once this distinction is noted, it
becomes clear that His judgment about the two viewpoints has no
ontological implications at all.23 Consequently, seeing ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s
words as a relativist reconciliation of ontological monism and
dualism is to mistake a rather studiously neutral statement about two
kinds of viewers as an endorsement of both their opinions.24 Such is
patently not the case.

If Dr. Momen’s reading is correct, it would follow that ‘Abdu’l-
Bahá assumes that the spiritual condition, nature and understanding
of the believer are by themselves sufficient to determine the
objective correctness or truthfulness of a belief. However, the
Writings do not espouse such a subjectivist theory of truth.25
Indeed, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá clearly dismisses this notion when He points
out that subjective conditions and observations notwithstanding, it
is simply an objective error of fact to assert a geocentric solar
system.26 Moreover, if spiritual condition and nature were sufficient
to establish objective truthfulness, the Writings could not logically
dismiss certain beliefs as “vain imaginings,” (TB 41) “error,” (TB 10)
and “the lowest depths of ignorance and foolishness.” (SAQ 13727)
Spiritual condition is simply not sufficient to establish objective
truth.

5\. Pr ob le ms with Relativism

Can, as Dr. Momen asserts, relativism be “a basis for Bahá’í
metaphysics” or ontology? According to him, there can be no
‘correct’ or ‘incorrect’ interpretation of certain experiences and
statements as monist or dualist because all knowledge “is relative [to
the speaker’s standpoint] ... . This may be termed a cognitive or
epistemic relativism.”28

This far-reaching assertion is beset by at least six problems. First,
is the claim that humans are “unable to make any absolute
statements about Reality.”29 If this is meant categorically, how can
Bahá’ís claim “God exists”? For Bahá’ís, this declaration cannot be
anything less than absolute since ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, the infallible
interpreter of Bahá’u’lláh’s word, provided “proofs and evidences of
the existence of God.” (SAQ 530) He affirms this unconditionally,
which is to say, it absolutely as true from all possible viewpoints and
no addition can make it more true than it already is. Furthermore,
from God’s absolute existence, we can — contrary to Dr. Momen’s
claim — make indisputable ontological deductions. For example,

Lights of ‘Irfán Book Six 129

God’s existence makes Him the non-contingent head of a hierarchy
of being whose other members are contingent and dependent on
God. This dependence is true from all possible viewpoints within
creation. Denying or relativising this irreparably undermines the
foundations of the Bahá’í theology.

Second, in his claim that there can be no “absolute statements
about Reality,”31 Dr. Momen falls into a logical trap that devils all
assertions of absolute relativism. If the claim is true, then it
contradicts itself, since it is an “absolute statement about reality.” If
it is self-contradictory, there is no reason to give it the epistemic
privilege of being the “basis of Bahá’í metaphysics.”

A third problem is that the denial of “absolute statements about
reality”32 logically suggests that all viewpoints are equally true
insofar as they are relatively true, which in turn undermines the
central doctrine of “progressive revelation.” (KA 220) Guided by
successive Manifestations, humans attain ever more adequate, ever
more true — though never perfect — knowledge of reality. Similarly,
Bahá’u’lláh’s statement that we were “created to carry forward an
ever-advancing civilization” (GWB 215, emphasis added) implicitly
suggests an “evolutionary relativism” in which knowledge — while
never perfect — is nonetheless genuinely improving and progressive.
If knowledge is progressive, all viewpoints cannot be equally true.

A fourth difficulty is that Dr. Momen’s “cognitive or epistemic
relativism”33 rejects epistemic privilege, a position that maintains
that inasmuch as all views are conditioned by personality, spiritual,
historical and cultural factors, they are equal. There is no absolute
standard. However, in the Bahá’í Faith the Manifestations, “the
perfectly polished mirror[s],” (PT 26) and Their chosen interpreters
are, indeed, epistemically privileged: Bahá’u’lláh’s “Book itself is the
“Unerring Balance” established amongst men.” (KA 13) Bahá’í
teaching on this issue cannot be logically reconciled with epistemic
relativism.

A fifth difficulty: if we argue that the statements of the
Manifestations are privileged, but human interpretations of these
statements are not, we face the problem of vacuousness. When all
readings are equally true, then — because some readings contradict
others — none are. Consequently, it becomes impossible to teach the
Writings or even to discuss them since — all interpretations being
equally accurate — no one knows what the Writings actually say.
What is the point of becoming a Bahá’í or offering the Faith’s
teachings as a solution to a wide variety of world problems if no one
knows what the Writings ‘really’ mean? Obviously, the very raison
d’être of the Bahá’í Faith is removed by an unqualified cognitive
relativism.

How can we distinguish various degrees of truthfulness without
infringing on every Bahá’í’s right to interpret the Writings for him
or herself? This paper contends that the Bahá’í community has
adopted negative gate-keeping as a means of reconciling doctrinal
cohesion with individual freedom. Any understanding of the
Writings is acceptable if it is not ‘forbidden,’ that is, inconsistent
with the letter and spirit of the Sacred Text and/or the guidance
from Abdu’l-Bahá, Shoghi Effendi and the Universal House of
Justice. By adopting negative gate-keeping, Bahá’ís have, in fact,
adopted a qualified relativism inasmuch as negative gate-keeping
stipulates that within the framework provided by the Central Figures
and the Institutions, all understandings that are not forbidden are
equally valid or true.

The sixth problem with Dr. Momen’s views on relativism is his
interpretation of Shoghi Effendi’s statement that Bahá’í Faith’s
“teachings revolve around the fundamental principle that religious
truth is not absolute but relative, that Divine Revelation is
progressive, not final.” (WOB 5834) He appears to understand this as a
blanket relativism applicable to all subjects, but such is not the case.
The context of Shoghi Effendi’s is progressive revelation which
distinguishes between eternal “essential ordinances” (PUP 106) and
“material ordinances [which] are abrogated according to the
exigencies of time.” (PUP 106) It is the “material ordinances” not the
“essential ordinances” or “golden core”35 which are relative. Because
these “essential ordinances” (PUP 106) of religion are not relative, it
follows that only a qualified doctrinal relativism can apply to the
Bahá’í Writings.

6\. The First Great Ontol og ical Questi on:
Intr oducti on

Because the Bahá’í Writings embody an explicit and implicit
ontology, they are able to answer one of the most fundamental
ontological questions: “Why is there anything at all rather than
nothing?”36 In answering this basic question, the Writings also
answer a host of supplementary questions and thereby lay out an
entire ontological schema for future exploration and development.
The question arises because, as ‘Abdu’l-Bahá says, “absolute
nothingness cannot find existence.” (SAQ 281) Everything comes
from something else not itself.
6\.1. ‘To B e’ Means ‘to be C ause d’ ( wit h one E xc eption )

Unlike God, the created universe lacks “essential preexistence ...

which is not preceded by a cause,” (SAQ 280) and, therefore lacks
ontological self-sufficiency and independence. For this reason, the
created universe, like every one of its contents, requires a creator or

pre-existing cause since according to Bahá’u’lláh, “All that is created
... is preceded by a cause.” (GWB 162, emphasis added37) From this we
can conclude that in Bahá’í ontology ‘to be’ means to be caused and
to be contingent38, that is, to require a pre-existent and external
cause. Consequently, ‘to be’ also means to be part of a causal chain
or network, to be essentially connected to other entities or acts in a
community of predecessors that extends through time.39 This, in
turn, suggests that the Bahá’í Writings are committed to a causal
ontology.40

‘Abdu’l-Bahá declares that every affect must have a cause41 and
rejects as “manifestly absurd” (BWF 343) the notion of an infinite
causal chain that does not eventually lead back to a First Mover. He
uses this to prove the existence of God. (BWF 343) The fact that all
beings except God need a prior cause highlights again the
ontological dualism what we have called the ‘bedrock principle’ of
Bahá’í ontology — the absolute distinction between God Who has
“essential preexistence” (SAQ 280) and creation which does not.

7\. W hy is There S o mething Rather than
N othing? The First Ans wer

The Bahá’í Writings provide two answers to this question.

‘Abdu’l-Bahá says, “a creator without a creature is impossible ... all
the divine names and attributes demand the existence of beings.”
(BWF 297, emphasis added) This and similar statements42 affirm the
idea that there is something rather than nothing because God’s
perfection includes the title or name of ‘Creator’ which, in turn,
logically “demand[s]” (BWF 297) a creation without which God
would suffer a deficiency inconceivable in “the Exalted, the
Supreme”. (TAB 197) This is the argument from divine perfection. It
is possible to generalise this answer to say that creation follows
logically from God’s transitive attributes such as “All-Merciful,” (TB
12) “the Help in Peril” (PM 14) and “the Ever-Forgiving.” (PM 17)
This in turn can be generalised even further, as ‘Abdu’l-Bahá does
when He writes “all the divine names and attributes [transitive and
intransitive] demand the existence of beings.” (SAQ 180)
7\.1. God’s Fre e Will an d Nec essary Creation

Do not such demands limit the freedom of God Who “is
powerful to do as He willeth?” (GWB 314) On one hand, God’s
freedom is a paradox or mystery beyond human reason. There is
nothing inherently irrational about this stance — known as moderate
rationalism43 — since recognising the limits of logic is not in itself
illogical. On the other, we could say that God has not only
established the laws of reason but also committed Himself to follow
them. Thus, He is constrained only by Himself which, in effect,

leaves God doing as He wills. Given this commitment, He accepts
creation as a logical consequence of willing His own perfection.

8\. W hy is There S o mething Rather Than
N othing? The S ec ond Ans wer

Creation also exists because God wishes to be known. Bahá’u’lláh
makes approving use of the Islamic tradition “I was a Hidden
Treasure. I wished to be made known, and thus I called creation into
being in order that I might be known.” (KA 175, emphasis added) This
and similar passages44 highlight that this freely chosen wish on God’s
part underlies creation.

However, if God is the “the Self-Sufficing,” (GWB 12) why does
He wish to be known? One possible reply, the ‘devotional answer’, is
that God’s will in all its mystery ought to be sufficient reason for us
since He is “inscrutable unto all men.” (SWB 113) Another possible
response argues that without beings to know Him, God exists purely
as a subject and thus lacks being as an object. Since God cannot
have any deficiency45, He must — according to the logical rules He
has willed and to which He has freely committed Himself — also
exist as an object of knowledge in creations that are fundamentally
different than He.

9\. The Ont ol og ical Principle o f Perfecti on and
Plenitude

It might be argued that only the Manifestation and, perhaps,
humankind are needed for God to be known and to “reveal
[Himself]” (KA 175) but such a notion violates the principle that
God’s creation is “perfect and comprehensive.” (GWB 6246) This
seemingly simple phrase conveys a very powerful idea, namely, that
in Bahá’í ontology, the principles of perfection and plenitude are at
work: creation is not only perfect (PUP 7947) but the “numberless
forms” of creation guarantee that God is known as completely and
perfectly as possible throughout all degrees of being.

10\. The Quali fied Idealist Tendency in Ba há’í
Ontol ogy

The Writings state that all beings are “expressive of the
knowledge of God.” (PUP 178, emphasis added) Indeed, without
revealing God’s attributes and names, there would be no beings: “but
for the potency of that revelation, no being could ever exist.” (PUP
177) Given that conscious or unconscious knowledge of God is the
sine qua non of existence, Bahá’í ontology has a strong idealist
tendency. Like Bishop Berkeley’s principle of “esse est percipi”48,

Bahá’í ontology correlates being and perception or knowledge, but
with a unique qualification: in the Writings, ‘to be’ is not just to be
known by God but also to actively know or perceive God in a
manner appropriate to one’s station. In general terms, knowledge
and being are correlates. They can be distinguished intellectually but
not separated in actuality.

Abdul’-Bahá’s statement that “the Kingdom is the real world, and
this nether place is only its shadow stretching out,” (SWAB 178) not
only reinforces the idealist tendency in Bahá’í ontology but also
gives it a decided Platonic turn.49 Just as in the “Myth of the Cave”50
Plato compares what most people take as reality to shadows, ‘Abdu’l-
Bahá likens the real world to a “shadow” (SWAB 178) or “images
reflected in water.” (SWAB 178) The Platonic structure of this idea is
plainly evident in that the material world is a shadow of the
ontologically superior, truly real world of the ideal Kingdom.

Although the material world is an image or shadow of the
Kingdom, the Writings do not write of this “nether” world” as
ontologically unreal or illusory in an absolute sense. Bahá’í ontology,
unlike Platonic ontology, only devalues the world therapeutically —
but not ontologically — to remind us that our ultimate destiny is not
on the material plane though passage through this plane is necessary
for our development as individuals and as a species. For this reason,
we say that Bahá’í ontology exemplifies a qualified idealism.
1 0.1. T h e (P latonic ) Arc o f De sc ent a n d t h e
(Aristotelian ) Arc of Asce nt

In Bahá’í ontology, things cannot just receive knowledge of
God’s attributes but must also express or reflect the divine
attributes. Thus, every entity not only illustrates the “return to God”
(PUP 7351), but actually is, in its very being, the act of returning to
God. If it did not ‘testify’ to God’s bounty, it would not actually
exist. Therefore, at every moment an entity’s act of being is both the
“arc of descent” (SAQ 284) — the reception of God’s attributes — and
the “arc of ascent” (SAQ 284) — the reflection of God’s attributes —
in a manner appropriate to the kind of being it is. Descent and
ascent are really aspects of a single ontological process constituting
at every instant an entity’s complete act of being and were this
process to stop, the entity would cease to exist. This shows that in
Bahá’í ontology, ‘to be’ is ‘to be in the act of becoming.’

Furthermore, the arc of descent corresponds to the Platonic fall
in which things are projected onto the lower, material plane as
shadows, images or “outer pictures.” (PUP 10) The corresponding arc
of ascent is Aristotelian insofar as entities proceed towards, or
‘return’ to God, the universal “object of desire,”52 by actualising
their intrinsic potentials through real experience and thus becoming

‘all they can be.’ They give up an ideal, untested perfection — the
inexperienced purity of childhood53 — for practical experience by
which the human spirit will “acquire perfection.” (SAQ 200) The
descent is not entirely a loss since an entity’s act of being is
augmented by the process of return.54

11\. The Tw o-F old S tructure o f Being

The fact that things must both receive and actively express or
reflect their knowledge of God in order to be, indicates a correlative
two-fold structure of being: receptive (‘passive’) and active.55 ‘To
be’ is to be receptive and expressive of the divine attributes; being is
structured receptivity and expression.56 Though in the case of non-
human entities, reception and mere reflection, that is, unconscious
“testimony,” (GWB 177) is sufficient for the act of being, such is not
the case for human kind. As the Noonday Prayer demonstrates,
conscious and free humans were created to “know Thee and to
worship Thee.” (KA 100, emphasis added) Thus, humankind also has a
two-fold ontological structure, but it is distinguished by a
qualitative difference: we must not only be aware of the signs of
God but reflect them consciously and freely in worship.

12\. A Hierarchical Ontol o gy : De grees o f
Existence

Bahá’í ontology includes the concept of “degrees of existence”
(SAQ 225) as shown         in ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s statement that “the
differences in the degrees of existence of creatures is one of the
necessities of existence, which unfolds itself in infinite forms.”
(SAQ 30157) He also recognizes “degrees of being,” (SWAB 190)
stating that “although the degrees of being are various, yet all are
good,” (SAQ 225) meaning that each being and each kind of being
has its appropriate place (station) and properly performs its tasks as
it “participateth in a coherent whole.” (SWAB 19058)

Implicit in the concept of “degrees of being” is the concept of a
hierarchy, albeit one in which each entity is good and perfect in its
own degree and relative to itself. Relative to others, however, “some
beings are higher in the scale than others.” (SAQ 130) Specifically,
humankind is at the top and the mineral at the bottom, an idea
emphasised by saying that “the existence of the mineral in
comparison with that of man is nonexistence.” (SAQ 278) In other
words, humankind has a greater degree of being than matter, though
in relationship to the “Supreme Being” (KI 97) any degree of being
possessed by any created entity “is an illusion.” (SAQ 278) The
hierarchical principle is so much a part of Bahá’í ontology that even
the Abhá Kingdom reflects degrees or a hierarchy of being. As

‘Abdu’l-Bahá says, in the next life those who “fall[ ] into the lowest
degrees of existence” will be “considered as dead by the people of
truth.” (SAQ 225)

How, we may ask, can one thing can be ‘more real’ or have ‘more
being’ than another? One possible answer is that the degree of being
is determined by the capacity to receive and express the divine
attributes and names. “Each [entity] according to its capacity,
indicateth, and is expressive of, the knowledge of God,” (GWB 178)
and humankind possesses this receptive and reflective capacity “[t]o
a supreme degree” (GWB 177) because “in [humankind] are
potentially revealed all the attributes and names of God to a degree
that no other created being hath excelled or surpassed.” (GWB 177)
Thus, humankind possesses a pre-eminent degree of being among
created things.

We must also recall that our degree of being or existence has two
aspects. First, there is our natural degree or station as beings
consciously able “to know and worship” the Divine, and as beings
“at the last degree of darkness, and at the beginning of light.” (SAQ
235) Second, there is our existential degree of being, the degree we
attain by the free choices we make and our consequent “nearness to
God” (PUP 147) which seems to determine how much of the divine
bounties or attributes we can receive and reflect. Above all, we must
consciously choose to love God, for if we do not, we cannot receive
and reflect God’s bounties. (HW Arabic 4) Spiritually, we can be as
real as we choose to be.

13\. A Quali fied Relativist Ontol o g y

‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s foregoing statement about some beings as “higher
in the scale than others” (SAQ 130) shows that Bahá’í ontology is a
relativist ontology with the degree of existence possessed by any
entity being relative to its position in the hierarchy of being. At the
top of the “scale” of being is God, Who alone is existentially
independent or “Self-Subsistent,” (TB 34) and in comparison with
Whom “the existence of beings ... is but illusion and nothingness.”
(SAQ 278) A similar relationship holds between humankind and
matter: “the existence of the mineral in comparison with that of
man is nonexistence.” (SAQ 278) It is nevertheless important to
remember that relative to itself, or, as ‘Abdu’l-Bahá puts it, “in its
own condition,” (SAQ 281) the mineral possesses complete and
adequate existence. Similarly, in the Abhá Kingdom, those who are
“deprived of [God’s] divine favours” are “dead” in relationship to
the “people of truth.” (SAQ 225) Generalizing on this issue, ‘Abdu’l-
Bahá states that “existence and nonexistence are both relative.”
(SAQ 281)

The relativity of existence and nonexistence is ontologically
important because it denies any form of creatio ex nihilo, or creation
out of absolute nothing, a key doctrinal point for almost all
Christians and Muslims.59 Indeed, on this issue, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá says
that “absolute ... has not the capacity of existence.” (SAQ 28160)
Consequently, we cannot take literally Bahá’u’lláh’s statement that
we were “called into being ... out of utter nothingness.” (GWB 6161)
Given ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s qualification, the latter phrase obviously
intends the phrase “utter nothingness” relative or in comparison to
God and does not introduce the concept of creatio ex nihilo.
‘Abdu’l-Bahá dismisses the concept of absolute nothingness as
“inconceivable.” (PUP 88)

Because in Bahá’í ontological relativism, an entity’s degree of
being is both absolute and relative — absolute vis-à-vis itself and
relative vis-à-vis its place in the hierarchy of being — we have a
‘qualified’ not a radical or “totalistic relativism in which all things
without exception depend on their relationships to everything else
for their existence and degree of being.”62 Bahá’í ontology is also
qualified because it has an absolute reference point — God — Whose
absolute being is beyond degrees, and by Whom all other degrees of
existence are determined.63 God gives the hierarchy or “chain”64 of
beings an absolute foundation, just as in physics the absolute speed
of light gives relativity an absolute foundation.

14\. Substantialist Ontol o gy

‘Abdu’l-Bahá categorically rejects as “erroneous” the belief that
“each being is an absolute illusion which has no existence [and that]
the existence of beings is like a mirage or like the reflection of an
image in water or in a mirror which is only an appearance having in
itself no principle, foundation or reality.” (SAQ 278) What the
mirage or mirror image purports to be is entirely unreal because the
image “has no material existence, no substance.” (PUP 21, emphasis
added65) This suggests that in Bahá’í ontology to be real means to
have a substance of some kind.

‘Substance’ of course does not necessarily refer to material
substance. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá for example refers to the “living substance”
(SAQ 90) from which humankind is created, and says that the
rational soul and spirit are the substance whereas the body is the
accident.66 Even God seems to have a substance of some kind, for
according to Bahá’u’lláh, the spiritual nature of the Manifestation is
“born of the substance of God Himself.” (GWB 6667) Thus we may
conclude that in Bahá’í ontology, to be real, to exist, means to have
or be a substance of some kind. What illusions and mirages represent
lacks substance and is, therefore, not real.

The substantialist ontology is also confirmed by ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s
statement that while things are known to us by their attributes, their
“identity or reality ... remains hidden.” (PUP 42168) Elsewhere, using a
flower as an example, He notes that the “underlying reality or
intrinsic identity, is still beyond the ken” (PUP 421, emphasis added) of
human observers. In other words, in addition to the attributes by
which a thing becomes known to us, it also has an “underlying”
substrate or substance that remains unknown. In its identification of
“underlying reality” with “intrinsic identity” this last quotation also
indicates that substance (“underlying reality”) and essence (“intrinsic
identity”) are the same, a position that aligns Bahá’í ontology with
Aristotle.69

The fact that things are more than their perceived attributes also
makes it clear that Bahá’í ontology rejects phenomenalism, “the
doctrine that physical objects are reducible to sensory experiences”70
or that empirical statements correspond only to “mental
appearances.”71 Real things are not only their superficial sensible or
mental appearances but also possess an underlying reality, a substrate
or substance as an emanation of the divine Will.72

In regards to substantialism, there are three additional points to
keep in mind. First, the fact that even this “nether place” (SAQ 178)
has some degree of substantial reality qualifies or mitigates the
Platonic aspect of Bahá’í ontology: the unreality of the “nether
place” is relative in the hierarchy of being and not absolute. Second,
we must keep in mind that a substantialist ontology is not necessarily
static. What the Writings call ‘substance’ may — except in the case
of God — also be thought of as various modes of a process of self-
actualization.73 Third, evil is simply a by-product of the greater good
of the quest for self-actualization; it is a failing, a shadow or
“absence of good” (FWU 78) without real existence, that is, substance
of its own.

15\. A Quali fied Realist Ontol o gy

Reflecting on the examples of substance given in the Writings,
makes it clear that a substance is that which exists independently of
a perceiver. Consider the mirage mentioned by Abdu’l-Bahá. What
it represents, or purports to be (a caravan) is completely unreal — not
only because it lacks substance but because it is observer-dependent
for its existence; another observer might see the caravan as
something else and there is no way to prove either person right.
However, the fact that mirages exist as atmospheric phenomena is
indisputable and independent of any observer. Therefore, Bahá’í
ontology is realist; what is real does not depend on observers for its
existence.74 This realism is supported by the fact that all things are

created by God and therefore depend for their existence on Him and
not on any human observer.

The claim that Bahá’í ontology is fundamentally realist does not
mean that human beings simply perceive reality without interpreting
it. The fact that we do interpret reality encourages us to re-introduce
a traditional distinction between first nature, or reality as made by
God, and second nature, the personal, social and cultural
superstructure which humans have developed from their various
interpretations of and work with first nature. For example, a
sculptor such as Michelangelo takes a piece of marble — first nature
— and interprets it as the unrealised form of “David” which — the
second nature — he then reveals through his labour. Second nature is
indeed man-made reality, and is, therefore, immediately dependent
on humankind for its existence and proximately dependent on first
nature. Thus, when we say that in Bahá’í ontology reality exists
independently of human perception, we refer to first nature as
created by God, and not to second nature. For these reasons the
realism of the Writings is “qualified.”

Although the terms ‘first and second nature’ do not occur in the
Writings, the concept is implicitly there. It is directly analogous to
the distinction the Writings make between natural or innate and
“acquired capacity” (SAQ 214) as well as between innate and
“acquired character ... which is gained by education.” (SAQ 212)
Innate capacity and character correspond to first nature; they are
divine creations and, therefore, “purely good” (SAQ 212) because “in
creation there is no evil; all is good.” (SAQ 215) Acquired capacity,
character and education correspond to second nature. Our use of
this distinction does nothing accept apply at the larger, collective
level a distinction clearly made by the Writings at the individual
level.

The importance of the distinction between first and second
nature should not be underestimated. It means, among other things,
that the Writings distinguish between ontology per se, that is, the
study of being vis-à-vis the first divinely created nature, and cultural
ontology, that is, the study of being vis-à-vis human interpretations
of and constructs based on this first nature. This distinction
completely undermines the radical constructionist or relativist view
that there can be no knowledge of nature as it is because whatever
we call ‘nature’ is already a human cultural construct. From the
perspective of the Bahá’í Writings, such may be the case — as
proven by the existence of errors — but it is not necessarily so. Thus,
we conclude that Bahá’í ontology does not support the view that our
understanding of first nature is entirely a human construct. This, in
turn, supports the outright essentialism of Bahá’í ontology.

Additional proof of the realist nature of Bahá’í ontology is
found in the existence of the various kingdoms of God, the mineral,
vegetable, animal and human. These are real regardless of human
perception, that is, they reflect inherent essential differences, the
divinely decreed “degrees of existence” (PUP 20875) that are
independent of human observers and not mere constructs or con-
ventions. (SAQ 301) However, the realism is qualified inasmuch as
the reality of things is relative in regards to God and higher beings.

However, this does not mean Bahá’í ontology espouses a
completely ‘naïve’ realism in which the world is necessarily always as
it appears to superficial inspection. On the contrary, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá is
perfectly aware that the senses and the rational mind can be deceived
as, for example, with images in a mirror or in a mirage.76 He does,
however, agree that it is possible to penetrate these illusions, to cut
through the appearances and illusions we have constructed to get to
the underlying reality. In the words of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, “we say that
the spirit of man can penetrate and discover the realities of all
things, can solve the secrets and mysteries of all created objects.”
(PUP 264, emphasis added) The notion of discovering realities suggests
they exist independently of the knower.

16\. An Essentialist Ontol ogy : To Be Means To
Have an Essence

Since the various kingdoms possess inherent or essential
differences and if each entity has a hidden “reality,” (PUP 421) then it
is difficult to avoid the judgement that the Bahá’í Writings uphold
an essentialist view, or conversely, reject the basic nominalist
principle that entities possess no real essences other than humanly
constructed ‘nominal essences’ of second nature. The essentialist
nature of the Writings can be deduced from Abdul’-Bahá’s
statement that we know the “hidden” (SAQ 220) essence of a thing
only through its qualities or attributes.77 It follows that if the
essence is hidden from us, it cannot be a human construction or
convention and must, therefore, be independent of human
perception and action. This would apply primarily to things in the
divinely created first nature. Moreover, if we define essence as a
thing’s unique capacity to reflect the divine attributes78 and that “all
things in their inmost reality” (GWB 177, emphasis added) do so, it
follows that all things, be they first or second nature, have an
essence.79 Nothing is exempt from having an essence, as shown by
the following list drawn from the Writings: God; the human soul;
humankind; belief in Divine Unity; justice; “all created things”
beauty; species of living things; truth; religion; “this new age”;
“existence” and the spirit. These references to the essence are even
more wide-spread once we realise that such phrases as “inmost

reality,” “the realities of” the “inner reality,” and “inner realities”
also refer to the essence of things.

This highly diverse list, along with ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s references to
the real but hidden “intrinsic identity,” (PUP 421) as well as to “the
essential reality underlying any given phenomenon” (ibid, emphasis
added), makes it clear that in Bahá’í ontology, all things have an
essence whose attributes appear or manifest in the world. Because
there is no such thing as being without an essence, being and essence
are absolutely correlated. To be is to have an essence since the act of
being can never be separated from the act of being something in
particular.

Essentialism is reinforced by ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s insistence that “the
essence of things does not change,” (SAQ 100) an idea also reflected
in His belief that the essence of humankind undergoes no change
despite changes of outward appearance80 and that species do not
change.81 The immutability of essences is, of course, one of the
pillars of any form of essentialism since the ‘purpose’ of essences is
to provide order, that is, continuity of identity through various
transformations.

Essentialism does not mean that Bahá’í ontology is static. Instead,
we must bear in mind that the essence of an entity is only an aspect
of its whole being. The other, equally necessary aspect is the
‘becoming’, that is to say, the manifestation of that particular
essence in the external, contingent and “visible world” (SWAB 8)
whereby it can display in ever-more adequate measure the bounties
of God. Without this ‘becoming’ or actualization, the essence
remains wholly on the “plane of the invisible” (PUP 30) and, thereby,
without effect and unknown. That is why ‘Abdu’l-Bahá says, “Praise
be to Him Who hath made the world of being ... and hath made the
invisible world to appear on the plane of the visible.” (SWAB 13)
1 6. 1. B ei ng and Essenc e

On the far-reaching issue of whether being or existence is
identical to essence, Bahá’í ontology sides with Ibn Sina and St.
Thomas Aquinas in distinguishing the two except in the case of God.
‘Abdu’l-Bahá makes this clear when He writes that “all things are
subject to transformation and change, save only the essence of
existence itself.” (SWAB 157, emphasis added) The phrase “the essence
of existence itself” is a philosophical description of God, Who, as
the only non-contingent being, exists necessarily. His essence is to
exist which is why He needs no creator. From this it follows that in
God, existence and essence are one. This is emphasized by ‘Abdu’l-
Bahá when He speaks of “the Essence of Unity (that is, the existence
of God)” (SAQ 180) indicating thereby that God’s essence and
existence are identical.

In God, we cannot even conceive of a difference between essence
and existence but such is not the case with contingent beings in
whom we can distinguish between the essence, ‘what’ a thing is, and
whether or not it actually exists, as for, example, with unicorns and
moose. Thus, in Bahá’í ontology, whatever exists in creation has two
correlated aspects: a divinely bestowed act of existence by which it
negates nothingness and an essence which makes it the particular
kind of thing or negation it is. It should be noted that the
distinction between being or existence and essence allows us to
understand with greater precision the difference between Creator
and created since in God this distinction does not exist.
1 6.2. Knowle dge an d Essenc e

A key feature of Bahá’í ontology is the principle that human
beings cannot know essences or substances directly but can only
know about them by means of their attributes. Thus, Bahá’í
essentialism is an epistemically qualified essentialism. On this issue
‘Abdu’l-Bahá informs us, that “phenomenal, or created, things are
known to us only by their attributes,” (PUP 421) that “the inner
essence of anything is not comprehended, but only its qualities.”
(SAQ 220) Even more precisely, He says, “the essence of a thing is
known through its qualities, otherwise it is unknown and hidden.”
(SAQ 220, emphasis added)

What exactly does this prohibition of knowing essences mean? It
is our contention that this is one of the ‘continental divides’ in the
interpretation of the Writings: how we understand ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s
remarks will lead Bahá’í ontology into wholly two different
directions with profoundly different implications for a number of
important issues. If we go in a Kantian direction, the Bahá’í world-
view is divided not only between Creator and created but also
between absolutely unknown essence or noumenon and perceived
attribute.

On the basis of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s statement that “the essence of a
thing is known through its qualities,” (ibid) the present author takes
a non-Kantian view. The Master’s statement shows not that there
can be no knowledge of essences but rather that this know-ledge
must be gotten in a specific way — through the qualities. The
knowledge about essences may not be obtained by direct, immediate
intuitive or ‘mystical’ knowledge of the essence or substance itself.
Knowledge about essences is indirect and ‘second-hand,’ and it is
inherently incomplete, for which reason essences are bound to
remain mysterious. Nonetheless, we can rest assured that whatever
knowledge we do possess from the qualities, that knowledge is not
just about the appearance of something but is ‘connected to’,
corresponds to the inner nature of that particular thing.

17\. Disc onnected, Phenomenal ‘Kno wl edg e’

If there were a complete ‘disconnect’ between the qualities and
the essence, Bahá’í ontology would postulate a strongly ‘Kantian’
universe in which we remain absolutely isolated from the noumenal
or essential realm and enclosed in a world of superficial phenomena
or appearances.82 There are three problems with this position. First,
such a limitation denies any knowledge of ‘depth.’ Not only does this
conflict with ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s claim that essences can, in fact, be
known, albeit through attributes, but it also is out of harmony with
such statements as “The power of the rational soul can discover the
realities of things, comprehend the peculiarities of beings, and
penetrate the mysteries of existence” (SAQ 217), and “For this reason
we say that the spirit of man can penetrate and discover the realities
of all things, can solve the secrets and mysteries of all created
objects.” (PUP 264, emphases added) These statements, with their
references to knowing the “realities of things” and solving “secrets
and mysteries” clearly indicate that human knowledge goes deeper
than phenomena or appearances.

The second problem follows from the first. If there is a complete
disconnect between our knowledge and “the realities of things”,
then in fact, there is no knowledge of things at all. This opens the
way for a profound philosophical skepticism that undermines the
Revelation itself. A complete disconnect between phenomenal
knowledge of Bahá’u’lláh and His reality prevents Bahá’ís from
using their phenomenal knowledge of the history of Bahá’u’lláh to
attain certainty about Him and His mission. Any efforts to know His
phenomenal history would be pointless since such knowledge would
not necessarily connect in any way to His reality. In that case, why
bother?

Third: if there were no intrinsic connections between the entities
and its qualities, how could we know to associate a particular set of
qualities with a particular entity? Qualities with no intrinsic
connection with entities are simply free-floating qualities not much
different from the mirages mentioned by ‘Abdu’l-Bahá. They have
no intrinsic or necessary connection with any underlying reality or
substance and this — in Bahá’í ontology — deprives them of reality.
Moreover, if there is no certain connection between perceived
attribute and essence, we will eventually arrive at an all-corroding
skepticism about knowing things in any way. This conflicts with the
Bahá’í notion of making progress by increasing knowledge of
various kinds.

Though it rejects a strong Kantianism, Bahá’í ontology does, in
fact, embrace a weak Kantianism insofar as it posits a distinction
between attributes and essence, between the knowable and not

completely knowable, between inherently mysterious essences and
the emanated attributes perceived by us. However, we must not
press this distinction too far, lest we end with a strong Kantianism
and its attendant difficulties. Finally, it should be noted that God, of
course, differs from created beings inasmuch as “all these attributes,
names, praises and eulogies apply to the Places of Manifestation”
(SAQ 149, emphasis added) rather than to God-in-Himself. However,
as will be seen in Section 19, this doctrine is more nuanced than at
first appears.

18\. The Pr ob l e m o f N o minalism

Positing a complete disconnection between attributes and essence
leads to some form of nominalism. If essences are completely
unknown, they can be discounted and, therefore, objects can be
reduced to the qualities we select and bundle together in whatever
way suits us. This easily leads to the conclusion that what we call
particular things — ‘chairs’, for example — are only a conventional
(and basically arbitrary) selection of attributes bundled together
under one name or heading, ‘chair.’83 Such a conventional theory of
knowledge easily leads to skepticism since any convention can be
arbitrarily replaced by any other.84

The Writings show at least three additional problems with
nominalism. First, they assert that the “the reality of things, the
mysteries of beings and the properties of existence [are]
discovered.” (SAQ 9, emphasis added) Nowhere do they even remotely
suggest that reality is merely a construct or convention. Second, the
degrees of existence — mineral, plant, animal and human — are the
results of divine creation and not are not arbitrary human
conventions. Second, the differences between the degrees are
inherent, that is, essential. The same may be said of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s
three-fold division of reality in God, the Manifestation and the rest
of creation. These distinctions are not constructs or conventions.
Third, nominalism is implicitly rejected in ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s acceptance
of the concept of species and His emphatic denial of the
modification of one species into another.85 Since the differences
among species are inherent and real, the existence of species is not
simply a matter of constructing and conventionalizing.

19\. G od and the Pr ob l e m o f ‘Disc onnected
Knowl ed ge’

Vis-à-vis God, the issue of disconnected knowledge takes a
different turn. It seems that on this issue the Bahá’í Writings try to
steer a middle course between absolutely denying any and all
knowledge of God on one hand and the direct acquisition of

immediate, comprehensive and adequate knowledge of God’s
essence on the other. This is at times a difficult pathway.

According to the Writings, it is “absolutely impossible” (SAQ 147)
for the human mind to know the divine reality, essence of substance.
God’s essence is “above all comprehension” (SAQ 148) and for this
reason we categorically reject any direct, intuitive, mystical human
knowledge of God. But does this mean that our knowledge of God’s
attributes — known only indirectly via the Manifestation86 — is
completely disconnected from God? This paper contends that even
though this knowledge is scaled down, and, in absolute terms, wholly
inadequate to comprehending completely the divine nature, it is,
nonetheless, knowledge of God that we can rely on as being true,
though limited and obtained indirectly. We learn to expect mercy
from God, for example, because He is “the All-Merciful.” (TB 12)
Deficient as it may be, this knowledge tells us something about God.
At one point, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá says that such knowledge is given
negatively: we assert God’s perfection to deny imperfection.87 This,
however is still knowledge connected to God. Finally, we must keep
in mind Bahá’u’lláh’s statement that “no tie of direct intercourse”
(GWB 66) joins God to His creation for which reason a Manifestation
is needed. This statement must not be misread to mean that no tie or
connection of any kind can exist between humankind and God.
1 9. 1. T h e Proble m o f Et h ical Ni hi lism an d t h e De us
Absconditus

The issue of ‘connected knowledge’ is important because denying
such a connection leads to two problems. First, if the knowledge
given us by the Manifestation is not connected to God in some way,
what is the soteriological relevance of the Manifestation? What
authority does He have? Second, if such names as the “Most
Merciful” (PM 63) have no real connection to God, what is the
ethical relevance of God? Without real grounding in God, our
ethical values are all mere matters of opinion. Such a position leaves
us open to an ethical nihilism since without God’s authority, ethical
injunctions lose their absolutely imperative character and become
‘suggestions.’

Finally, disconnected knowledge can also engender the problem
of the ‘disappearing God’, the deus absconditus. An absolutely
unknowable God will simply become irrelevant and, for practical
purposes, be ‘replaced’ as an ‘object’ of worship by the
Manifestation. This, of course, violates the very raison d’être and
message of the Manifestation, but the danger is nonetheless real
because it is hard, if not impossible, for humans to maintain a sense
of connection with something we cannot know in any way.

1 9.2. An A lt ernative Vie w

It must be noted that the concept of faith provides us with an
alternative view of the issue of connection between the God and the
attributes given by ‘Abdu’l-Bahá and Bahá’u’lláh. We might say that
these descriptors provide no knowledge of God because knowledge
implies a degree of rational and intellectual certainty — which in turn
suggests surrounding the object of knowledge 88 — whereas faith has
no such implications. Faith is simply a positive existential response
that is not dependent on rational or external evidence. In other
words, we take it on pure faith that the attributes of the
Manifestation apply to God, but we make no actual knowledge
claims on this issue.

Although further research is needed to make a final
determination whether the Writings favor the ‘faith’ and
‘knowledge’ approaches to God’s nature, there are strong
suggestions that ‘knowledge’ is favored as the first among equals.
Knowledge and faith are the “two wings of the soul” (BWF 382) and
both are necessary for the ascent of the human soul to the lofty
station of divine perfections.89 However, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá makes it
clear that “it is first ‘to know’ and then ‘to do’” and that “By faith is
meant, first, conscious knowledge, and second, the practice of good
deeds.” (BWF 383, emphasis added) These words seem to give
knowledge a certain primacy since ‘Abdu’l-Bahá even puts it ahead
of good deeds. This idea seems in keeping with the affirmation that
“for God, knowledge is the most glorious gift of man and the most
noble of human perfections.” (SAQ 137)

20\. W hat Else Does It Mean ‘To Be’?

In exploring various questions, this paper has provided parts of
the answer to the question, ‘What does it mean ‘to be’?’ We shall
now continue this exploration. Rather than start with an abstract
discussion, we shall begin with an inventory of the kinds of things
that exist according to the Writings. This allows Bahá’u’lláh and
‘Abdu’l-Bahá to determine the inventory which is, in effect, a
‘world-map’ of reality.

According to the Writings, human beings inhabit a Lebenswelt90

or ‘life-world’ that is made up of the following kinds of ‘things’:
“sensible realities” or physical phenomena; “intellectual realities” or
ideational phenomena; spiritual realities such as the “Holy Spirit,”
“human spirit” and the “rational soul”; God, the Creator;
Manifestations, the mediators between God and creation; the
mineral, plant and animal kingdoms and their members; the human
kingdom and its members; the Abhá Kingdom and its inhabitants;
“spiritual beings” or entities who are the “angels of holiness ... Thine

invisible hosts” also called “the angels of Abhá.” In addition there
are essences, and attributes or qualities, as well as potentials — also
referred to as “capacities” or “potency” “powers” and substances,
“material forces,” “spiritual forces”, four kinds of time (SVFV 25),
the reality of “limitless space,” and the reality of cause and effect.
(GWB 162) Furthermore, they recognize “the absolute order and
perfection of existence,” “natural order,” natural laws91 and
processes of growth, evolution, decline92 and constant
regeneration.93

In the Lebenswelt of Bahá’í ontology, all of these things exist in
various modes of being. Examination of this list suggests that we
can classify all the items as existing in one of five ways: either as (1)
substance (which includes processes), as (2) an essential attribute, as
(3) an accidental attribute, or as (4) the form of a substance.94
Finally, there is (5) location, be it physical, temporal or ontological as
in the hierarchy of being. Essential attributes are those that a
substance needs to be the kind of substance it is; in ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s
example, it is an “essential requirement” (SAQ 233), or the “inherent
nature” (ABL 27) of fire to burn. Accidental attributes are those
which a substance may have but are not necessary to be the kind of
substance it is. For example, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá states that the body is an
accident of the soul which, He says, is the substance.95 The form of a
substance is the structure, or organization of the parts. Each of these
things has a different way or mode of existing. Substances, be they
material or spiritual, exist independently; accidental attributes exist
contingently and dependently but not necessarily in a substance;
essential attributes exist dependently but necessarily with a
substance, and form also exists dependently and necessarily with a
substance. Location tells us time and place as well as ontological
location in the hierarchy of being.

Examining this inventory shows that each of the items fits into
one of the five categories that seem to define the minimal
requirements of Bahá’í ontology. In the category of substance, we
find first of all God, Who is, strictly speaking, the only true
substance because only God is completely independent of anything
else. That God is a substance is confirmed by Bahá’u’lláh’s statement
that the Manifestation is “born of the substance of God Himself,”
(GWB 66, emphasis added) meaning not that God is material but that
He is a totally independent being. Lest this statement be
misinterpreted in an ‘incarnationist’ manner, we hasten to add that
the Manifestation is emanated or “born of” God, and resembles God
formally (though not substantially) in the way a mirror image
resembles the original formally. The relationship also resembles the
relationship between the original of a manuscript and a copy: the
two share formal but not substantial identity and one is logically

prior and is the final cause, raison d’être, of the other. All created
entities are, therefore, substances only in a relative sense. As we have
already seen, the rational soul is also a substance as are minerals,
plants, animals, “spiritual beings,” “material forces,” “spiritual
forces,” “sensible realities,” some “intellectual realities,” the Holy
Spirit, the human spirit, various physical and non-physical processes
and the members of the Abhá Kingdom.

In the category of essential attributes, we find the visible
essential attributes and “powers” that any substances has along with
“capacities” or potentials. All non-essential attributes are, by
definition, accidental. Within the category of form — that is, the
category of how things are organized — we find the “natural order”
and “natural laws,” whereas within the category of location we find
time, “limitless space,” and the “degrees of being.”

From the foregoing discussion we may conclude that in Bahá’í
ontology, to be is to fit into one of these categories: everything that
is a negation of absolute non-existence, everything that is in some
way a ‘reality’ finds a place somewhere in this schema. Refinements
or even changes may eventually be required, but it is difficult to
imagine how any list of categories based on the Writings could fail
to include these in some way or another. In other words, with these
categories, Bahá’í ontology provides us with a basic map of reality
that allows us to understand (within certain limits) the kinds of
things we encounter. This list of five categories also shows that there
exists some kind of underlying order in the Writings’ vision of reality.

22\. A N on-Kantian, Realist Ontol o gy Vis- à -vis
the Cate g ories

Our inventory of the Bahá’í Lebenswelt reinforces, from yet
another side, the conclusion that our knowledge of first and even
second nature is not entirely a human construct. It shows that Bahá’í
ontology is not a Kantian ontology inasmuch as the Writings
recognize the independent reality of time, space, “natural order”
(SAQ 201) as well as cause and effect.96 According to Kant, time,
space, causality and other categorical attributes are imposed upon
the unformed external data — noumena — by the human mind and
shaped into the phenomena we experience. The cosmic order as we
know it is an invention, a construction or convention of the human
mind and, to this extent, truth is something that we have made
rather than found. The Writings reject this view. Time, space,
causality, the categoreal attributes — in short, the cosmic order — are
inherent in the phenomena themselves and are not human
constructs. They were created by God, not man, and therefore exist
independently of human perception.

23\. The Rejecti on of Classical Em pi ricism and
Positivism

Another conclusion we can draw from our inventory or
Lebenswelt is that Bahá’í ontology rejects positivism and “classical
empiricism,”97 that is, “any view which bases our knowledge, or the
materials from which it is constructed, on experience through the
traditional five senses.”98 This is not to say that the Writings
altogether reject sense knowledge — for they do not — but rather
that they present reality as made of intellectual99 and spiritual100 as
well as “sensible realities.” (SAQ 83) Consequently, it is difficult to
escape the conclusion that Bahá’í ontology is fundamentally
incompatible with any philosophical system or epistemic
methodology that confines valid knowledge to knowledge gathered
and verified by the five senses.

24\. The Equiv ocal A p p licati on of ‘ Being’

Our ontological inventory also shows that the term ‘being’ is
applied equivocally in the case of God. In other words, the term
‘being’ does not apply to God in the same way as it does to created
things. How could it? God is — among other things — uncreated,
Self-subsistent, beyond time, has no spatial location yet is
omnipresent and is omniscient. Indeed, the difference is so great we
might wonder if the term applies to Him at all. Its self-evident
virtues notwithstanding, this argument is rejected by the Writings
which on a regular basis refer to God in terms such as “the Divine
Being,” (GWB 46101) “the unchangeable Being,” (GWB 47) “the
Ancient Being,” (GWB 49102) and “the sacred Being.” (GWB 192) (It
must immediately be noted that these descriptors for God should not
be confused with the references to the Manifestation as the “Great
Being.” (GWB 250)) Given these descriptions of God, it is difficult to
avoid the conclusion that the Writings intend us to associate God
with being in some way. However, in light of the overwhelming
differences between God and creation, it is clear that ‘being’ can
only be attributed to God in an equivocal or analogous way. Like all
other things, God has being insofar as He is not absolute
nonexistence and because it is His essence to exist103 as the only self-
subsisting or necessary being.

This analogous knowledge of God’s being is entirely negative —
He is ‘not absolute non-existence’ — and thus lacks any genuine
positive content. Knowing what a thing is not tells us nothing about
what it actually is. Thus, we are not ascribing any predicate to God
beyond what the Writings Themselves do by referring to Him as the
“Divine Being.” (GWB 46) This is simply a positive way of saying that
God is not absolute non-existence. Of course we must recall that

although this predication indicates a truth about God — His being or
existence — this does not mean that humankind understands this
truth to its fullest measure. Our knowledge is correct but
incomplete.
25\. The Tension of Being and N othi ngness

The fact that “the existence of creation in relation to the
existence of God is nonexistence” leaves all created things in a
highly paradoxical or contradictory situation: they both are and are
not at the same time. Their very existence is constituted by a tension
between being and non-being, a tension that cannot be escaped or
resolved in favor of one side or the other. Were it resolved in favor
of being, the created thing, would, in effect, become an absolute
being like God; were it resolved in favor of non-being, it would
become absolute non-existence, and that, as we know from ‘Abdu’l-
Bahá, is impossible. Thus, all created, finite things are situated, so to
speak, in the middle, between being and nothingness, a situation
manifesting itself most obviously in the inescapable anxiety that
accompanies all life and especially the lives of human beings. For
humans it is necessary to learn how to live consciously and creatively
with the tension, with the thesis and antithesis, of being and non-
being which structurally constitutes our existence. We are not here
to escape the tension by various means but to use it for our
individual and collective growth.
26\. N on-Being and Being -not- Yet

‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s statements that “nonexistence is only relative and
absolute nonexistence inconceivable” (PUP 88) and that “no sign can
come from a nonexisting thing” (SAQ 225) lead to the conclusion
that in Bahá’í ontology there is another kind of non-being — ‘being-
not-yet.’ The classical name for such incipient being-not-yet is
‘potentials’, which we have noted earlier are a part of the Lebenswelt
in Bahá’í ontology. Of course, from the point of view of actually
existing things, such potentials do not exist and are, therefore, a
kind of non-being, but they are a relative non-being with a capacity
for actualization. As such, like all other finite entities, potentials
have a paradoxical existence: depending on viewpoint they both are
and are not, though they are as real “in [their] own condition” (SAQ
281) as any other degree of being.

The Writings admit the existence of potentials when They note
the virtues of the “potential in the seed,” (PUP 91) of the sun
awakening “all that is potential in the earth,” (PUP 74) of the “virtues
potential in mankind,” (PUP 70) of the inventions “potential in the
world of nature” (PUP 309) and of the embryo progressing until “that
which was potential in it — namely, the human image — appears.”

(PUP 359) Of similar import are the passages referring to the
“mysteries latent in nature” (PUP 51) which are actualized by
humankind, the “latent talents” (PUP 52) hidden in human beings,
the “divine perfections latent in the heart of man,” (PUP 53) the
“latent realities within the bosom of the earth,” (FWU 70) and the
“the greater world, the macrocosm ... latent and miniature in the
lesser world, or microcosm, of man.” (PUP 69-70, emphasis added) The
same idea is implicit in Bahá’u’lláh’s statement that we are to
“[r]egard man as a mine rich in gems of inestimable value,” (GWB
260) which is to say that humankind possesses invaluable potentials
that must be actualized through education. Perhaps most fascinating
passage in this regard is ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s rhetorical question, “Before
we were born into this world did we not pray ... Did we not pray
potentially for these needed blessings before we were created?” (PUP
246, emphasis added) Combined with the previous quotes, this passage
strongly suggests that we had some degree of existence as potentials
before we actualized on the physical plain. This matter needs further
exploration.
27\. Platonic and Aristote lian Ele me nts in

The passages quoted above suggest that Bahá’í ontology
recognizes that the material plane has two distinct, though not
actually separable levels, the invisible plane of potentials and the
visible plane of actualized things.104 Quotes such as the following
suggest the same idea: “through an ideal inner power man brings
these realities [in the universe] forth from the invisible plane to the
visible.” (FWU 70105) Such quotations strengthen the view that Bahá’í
ontology has a Platonic slant, a view also reinforced by statements
such as, “The spiritual world is like unto the phenomenal world.
They are the exact counterpart of each other. Whatever objects
appear in this world of existence are the outer pictures of the world
of heaven.” (PUP 10106) Elsewhere we read “For physical things are
signs and imprints of spiritual things; every lower thing is an image
and counterpart of a higher thing.107 These, combined with
statements that “the Kingdom is the real world, and this nether place
is only its shadow stretching out” (SWAB 178) and that the Kingdom
is a more perfect world108 — much like Plato’s world of Ideas —
shows that Bahá’í ontology has strong Platonic features.

The fact that the material world has a ‘level of potentials’ and a
‘level of actualization’, which are distinct though not actually
separable, reveals the Aristotelian features of Bahá’í ontology.
According to Aristotle, each thing — except God — is in the
condition of being actual and being-not-yet or being-in-potential, of
being and being-in-development, of being whole and being-not-yet-

whole. If we ask where these potentials are, the answer seems to be
that they are enfolded109 within the particular things. For example,
the Writings speak of the “latent realities within the bosom of the
earth,” (FWU 70) “the potential in the seed,”110 the “virtues potential
in mankind” (PUP 70) and the “virtues latent within the realities of
the phenomenal world.” (PUP 91, emphases added111) This suggests
that the invisible plane is not a physical place but rather the
unactualized and, therefore, to us, invisible, condition inherent in all
things. ‘To be’, therefore, includes being and being-not-yet.
28\. I m plicati ons f or Existential Ontol ogy

Everything of which we are aware has a visible and hidden aspect
— a fact which has tremendous implications for existential ontology.
Due to limitations of space, we shall refer briefly only to two of
them. The first, and perhaps most obvious, is that humankind lives
in a world that is essentially and irremediably mysterious. Not only is
the world an endless mystery for us — “how vast the oceans of
wisdom that surge within a drop” (GWB 177) — but we are mysterious
to ourselves as well: in each of us is “are potentially revealed all the
attributes and names of God to a degree no other created being hath
excelled or surpassed... Man is My mystery, and I am his mystery.”
(GWB 177, emphasis added) The essential mysteriousness within and
around us leads in some existential ontologies to the establishment
of a sense of estrangement, ‘uncanniness’ or ‘unheimlichkeit,’ and
anxiety or Angst112 as constitutive features of human existence, and
in others, such as Marcel’s, to a more positive appreciation of the
role of mystery in our lives. Like the Bahá’í Writings, Marcel sees
the inescapable mysteriousness of life as a structurally constituted
sign of the presence of the divine and, therefore, as something that
brings value into human existence.

The second implication of the double visible and invisible aspect
of things relates to humankind’s role in the universe. According to
the Writings, humankind has a clearly defined role in cosmic
evolution, namely, to transfer phenomena from the plane of the
invisible to the visible. Humankind “discovereth those hidden secrets
of nature ... transfereth them from the invisible plane to the
visible.113 Thus, humankind plays a role in the unfolding of
creation’s otherwise hidden potentials and, thereby, makes its
contribution to the evolution of the cosmos at large which is to say,
human and cosmic evolution are inter-related as aspects of a unified
whole. Without this intervention of humankind, the being of the
cosmos would remain in an ontologically diminished state and for
this reason humankind is a necessity — not, as modern evolutionary
theory teaches, an accidental development — for the ontological
completeness of cosmos. Without man, the cosmos would also lack

value,114 being incomplete and imperfect.115 Quantitatively
insignificant at the cosmic scale, humankind is qualitatively of
supreme value.
29\. An Ontol o g ical Fall?

Because of the Platonic elements in Bahá’í ontology, we cannot
avoid asking whether or not the transition from the Kingdom to the
visible world and from the potential to the actual constitutes a ‘fall’?
The question arises because the potential or essential has a certain
perfection insofar as it is not determined or limited by the
conditions of actual existence. It also arises because of ‘Abdu’l-
Bahá’s characterisation of the world of creation as being as
“shadow[s]”, “fantas[ies]”, “images” and “pictures” in contrast to
“the real world” (SWAB 178) of the Kingdom. From a Platonic point
of view, this transition constitutes a fall.

However, from the Aristotelian viewpoint also evident in the
Writings, the ‘fall’ into actual being in the world of creation, to the
plane of the visible, is an opportunity for real growth and the
actualization of latent potentials. Thus, what is a ‘fall’ in one sense is
the beginning of progress in another. One recalls in this connection
Bahá’u’lláh’s prayer, “O Thou Whose tests are a healing medicine.”
(PM 220) Without the tests of existence, there can be no progress, no
actualization and making visible. The situation is analogous to what
‘Abdu’l-Bahá says about the innocence of children: their “purity is
on account of weakness and innocence, not on account of any
strength and testing.” (PUP 53) From this vantage point, the fall is a
‘felix culpa’, a ‘fortunate fall.’
30\. To Be and Bec o ming

Since all things are a combination of being and non-being in the
form of being-not-yet, all things are, therefore, in a constant
condition of change as various potentials strive to actualise
themselves. According to ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, “nothing which exists
remains in a state of repose ... Everything is either growing or
declining; all things are either coming from nonexistence into being,
or going from existence into non-existence.” (SAQ, emphasis added)
He adds that “motion [is] an inseparable concomitant of existence,
whether inherently or accidentally, spiritually or materially.”116
Indeed, He says motion “cannot be separated from beings because it
is their essential requirement, “ (SAQ 233) to which He adds, “this
movement is necessary to existence, which is either growing or
declining.” (SAQ 233, emphases added) Since motion and change are
essential attributes of all entities, then it follows that in Bahá’í
ontology to be is to be in the condition of becoming. It is not a
static ontology.

31\. The Correlati on o f Being and Be c oming

This leads to a subtle but important question: Is there a
difference between saying that ‘For an entity ‘to be’ means ‘to be in
the condition of becoming’ and saying ‘An entity’s being is the
process of its becoming’? One possible difference is that the first
implies that there is a continuing substance that is in the condition
of changing, that is, actualising its potentials, whereas the second
suggests that the changing process itself is the entity. Put into its
larger context, this question deals with whether Bahá’í ontology is
an ontology of being as represented by Plato and or an ontology of
becoming as represented by Heraclitus or perhaps a hybrid as
represented by Aristotle and Whitehead. At this stage in our
research, the last alternative seems the most capable of doing justice
to what we find in the Writings.

According to ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, “This state of motion is said to be
essential — that is, natural; it cannot be separated from beings.”
(SAQ 233) In this statement, ‘being’ and ‘becoming’ are absolutely
correlated with one another: they are mutually interdependent,
complementary and reciprocal relationship. In His words, they are
“inseparable concomitants of existence.”117 Like two sides of a coin,
they are distinguishable by intellectual abstraction but are not
separable in actual fact, which ‘Abdu’l-Bahá affirms when He says,
“an essential requirement cannot be separated from the thing itself.”
(SAQ 171) For this reason, it is our contention that Bahá’í ontology
upholds the correlation — as opposed to the identification — of
being and becoming in all things except God and the Manifestations
in their station of “pure abstraction and essential unity.” (KI 152)
31\.1. W hat is “Bec oming’?

At this point, however, we still face the question of how Bahá’í
ontology defines becoming or change. According to ‘Abdu’l-Bahá,
there are “different degrees of motion”118: “motion in transit”,
“motion of inherent growth”, “motion of condition”, motion “of
spirit”, “motion of intellect” and “motion of eternal essence.”119
Reflecting on this passage, we see the nature of change as being
from one thing to its contrary or contradictory, that is, from one
place or condition to its opposite. Next, we see that ‘Abdu’l-Bahá
has explicitly adopted Aristotle’s definition of change as the motion
from potentiality to actuality120, which is to say that in motion or
change, qualities and attributes that were potential but not overtly pre-
sent or active become actualized, that is, explicitly present and active.

Given the emphasis on change or the actualization of potentials
— and further — evolution, progressive revelation and human
progress after death, it seems clear that Bahá’í ontology has a strong

affinity for process ontologies. Furthermore, because Bahá’í
ontology also has Platonic elements — the “nether place” as the
shadow of the Kingdom — it appears that Bahá’í ontology resembles
the process philosophy of Alfred North Whitehead which also
combines Platonic and Aristotelian elements with a process ontology.
Of course, this is not to suggest that Bahá’í ontology is completely
assimilable to Whiteheadian philosophy, but the fact remains that,
despite some important differences, they share a number of essential
features.121

From the foregoing discussion, it seems difficult to avoid the
conclusion that Bahá’í ontology is neither a pure ontology of being
as best illustrated by Parmenides and Plato, nor a pure ontology of
becoming as illustrated by Heraclitus, but rather a hybrid of the two
as represented by Aristotle and Whitehead. It does not claim that
only static being is real and valuable, nor does it claim that only
becoming has reality. Instead, both are real and essential features of
the universe. It is a qualified process philosophy.
32\. Conclusion

From the foregoing survey it is possible to draw at least five
major conclusions about Bahá’í ontology.
1\. The Bahá’í Writings do, in fact, contain a systematic ontology.
2\. Bahá’í ontology confirms many of the insights provided by the

> philosophic tradition that begins with Plato, Aristotle and
> Plotinus, goes through Ibn Sina and Aquinas and is active today
> in Whitehead, Adler, Wilber and neo-Thomism.
3\. Bahá’í ontology is rigorously dualistic vis-à-vis the relation of

> the Creator and the created. This is the bed-rock of Bahá’í
> ontology.
4\. Bahá’í ontology represents a qualified form of realism,

relativism, idealism and process philosophy.
5\. Bahá’í ontology is rigorously essentialist, moderate rationalist,

hierarchical and substantialist.

precise meaning of ‘substance.’

\[11\] ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, of course, reveals a three-fold division of existence —
the stations of Creator, Manifestation and the rest of creation. (SAQ
295) However, unaided natural reason, can, by itself, only identify two
stations, Creator and created. The station of Manifestation requires
revelation by the Manifestations of God. Moreover, the first
fundamental division is between Creator and created.

Response to the Doctrine of the Unity of Existence” in The Journal of
Bahá’í Studies, Vol. 11, Number 34, September-December 2001.

\[24\] This, of course, raises the question as to why ‘Abdu’l-Bahá would take
such a neutral position and on this score we enter the realm of
historical speculation. It is possible, for example, that He did not want
to get the new faith or its adherents embroiled in a long-standing
Islamic theological dispute, especially while they were in Baghdad.

\[25\] In fact, the Writings hold to a correspondence theory of truth. See
Ian Kluge, “The Aristotelian Substratum of the Bahá’í Writings” for
detailed documentation about the correspondence theory of truth in
the Writings, http://www.geocities.com/SoHo/Den/4944/aristotle.html

\[26\] PUP 356.

\[27\] This rejection of a subjective theory of truth is illustrated by
‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s denial of the geocentric theory of the solar system. He
says, “The eye sees the sun and planets revolving around the earth,
whereas in reality the sun is stationary, central, and the earth revolves
upon its own axis.” (“Relativism: A Basis for Bahá’í Metaphysics”)

\[30\] Of course, it is important to distinguish the absolute assertion that God
exists from particular descriptions of God; the latter may well be limited
by our personal perspectives, but the former is an absolute truth.

variable interpretations of quantum phenomena in agreement with
Einstein and Bohm that the Copenhagen interpretation is incomplete.

\[43\] One way of schematising philosophies is by their answer to the
question, ‘How much can reason/logic tell us for certain?’ Rationalists
answer, ‘Everything — and what is not rational is not real knowledge.’
Irrationalists answer, ‘Nothing. It’s all just viewpoints and opinions.’
Moderate rationalists answer, ‘Some things — but not everything.’

\[54\] Some readers may recognise ideas analogous to those found in the
poetry of William Blake for whom being has a similar “innocence” and
“experience” dialectical structure. We may also see a Hegelian element
here.

\[55\] This differs significantly from Berkeley for whom being perceived is
sufficient for existence.

\[56\] If we correlate receptivity and activity with traditional beliefs, we
have, of course arrived at a concept analogous to beliefs about yin and

\[114\] This is not to be interpreted as a contradiction with the statement
that creation is perfect (PUP 80. The apparent contradiction is re-
moved by recalling that creation as a whole, includes both the actual-
ized and unactualized potentials. However, strictly from the point of
view of actualized nature is incomplete and, in that sense, imperfect,
because other potentials remain to be actualized or made manifest.
