‘Abdu’l-Baha’s commentary on the
Islamic tradition: ‘God doth give victory
to this religion by means of a wicked man’
– a provisional translation and notes
NECATI ALKAN

Introduction
This paper presents a provisional translation of a short exegesis (tafsīr) by ‘Abdu’l-Baha in Ottoman
Turkish.1 There are many tablets of ‘Abdu’l-Baha in various Turkic dialects.2 The original text of this
tablet appears in a collection of Turkish tablets and prayers of ‘Abdu’l-Baha, Majmū‘ih-yi Alwāḥ wa
Munājāthā-yi Turkī in the Arabic-Persian script, first published in 1948–9.3 It is probable that this
tablet was written in ‘Akka since at least one tablet in this collection is dated 1894, and at that time
‘Abdu’l-Baha was living there. He moved to Haifa after his liberation in 1908. As in the case of some
other tablets, it was probably addressed to a Sunni Ottoman official4 or a cleric. Its content indicates
that the recipient was not a Baha’i because it does not contain the typical openings emphasizing a
believer’s qualities, nor the common exhortations to servitude before God and promoting the Baha’i
Faith. The recipient is addressed as ‘thine excellency’, and this tablet forms part of what can be called
the ‘external affairs’ work that ‘Abdu’l-Baha carried out for Baha’u’llah. In the second part of this
tablet ‘Abdu’l-Baha interprets a dream of the addressee; this, however, is discussed in another paper
as it is a different topic.5

The ḥadīth (tradition) in question is from Ṣaḥīḥ Bukhārī, which is regarded by Sunni Muslims as
the most reliable of the compilations of Islamic traditions. The text of the relevant ḥadīth may be
translated thus:

1   I would like to thank Moojan Momen, Todd Lawson, William McCants, Vahid Brown and Ismael Velasco; without their

very useful comments and references this article would not have developed.

2   The Baha’i World Centre has a large collection of such tablets; Dr. Iraj Ayman (personal communication).
3   It consists of mostly short tablets in Ottoman and Azeri Turkish to individuals and Baha’i communities in Iran and

Narrated by Abu Huraira:

> We witnessed along with God’s Apostle the Khaibar (campaign). God’s Apostle told his
> Companions about a man who claimed to be a Muslim, ‘This man is one of the people
> destined for [Hell-]Fire.’ When the battle started, the man fought very bravely and received a
> great number of wounds and became crippled. Upon that, a man from among the
> Companions of the Prophet came and said, ‘O God’s Apostle! Do you know what the man
> you described as one of the people of [Hell-]Fire has done? He has fought very bravely for
> God’s Cause and he has received many wounds.’ The Prophet said, ‘But he is indeed one of
> the people destined for [Hell-]Fire.’ Some of the Muslims were in doubt about this statement.
> So while the man was in that state, the pain caused by the wounds troubled him so much that
> he put his hand into his quiver and took out an arrow and committed suicide with it. Some
> men from among the Muslims went to the Apostle of God and said, ‘O Apostle of God! God
> has made your statement true. So-and-so has committed suicide (suicide being in breach of
> Islamic Law).’ The Apostle of God said, ‘O Bilal! Get up and announce in public: None will
> enter Paradise but a believer, but God doth give victory to this religion (Islam) by means of a
> wicked man.’6

In his commentary on this ḥadīth, ‘Abdu’l-Baha seems to ignore its negative context – the fact
that the Prophet Muhammad referred to this person, though fighting alongside the Muslims, as one of
the people of hell-fire (i.e. a person destined for hell) – and puts forth a more positive interpretation of
the words ‘Inna’llāha yu’ayyidu hādhā’d-dīn bi-rajulin fājirin’ – ‘God doth give victory to this
religion by means of a wicked man’. ‘Abdu’l-Baha’s tafsīr here is in the Islamic tradition of giving
the inner meaning (bāṭin) of the words. Thus, for example the famous mystic ‘Mawlānā’ Jalālu’d-
Dīn-i Rūmī states:

> Know the words of the Koran are simple, but within the outward sense is an inner secret one.
> Beneath that secret meaning is a third, whereat the highest wit is dumbfounded. The fourth
> meaning has been seen by none save God, the Incomparable and All-Sufficient. Thus they go
> on, even to seven meanings, one by one, according to the saying of the Prophet, without
> doubt. Do thou, O son, confine not thy view to the outward meaning, even as the demons saw
> in Adam only clay. The outward meaning of the Koran is like Adam’s body, for its
> semblance is visible, but its soul is hidden.7

At first glance, it may seem puzzling that ‘Abdu’l-Baha is taking, not a doubtful, but what is regarded
as an authentic (ṣaḥīḥ) ḥadīth from no less a source than al-Bukhārī and he is not questioning its
authenticity, just giving it a completely new and unexpected meaning. He is making the inner meaning
(bāṭin) have the opposite of the manifest meaning (ẓāhir). However, ‘Abdu’l-Baha’s interpretation is
not unusual in terms of the tradition of Sufi interpretation of ḥadīth, even ṣaḥīḥ ḥadīth. ‘Abdu’l-Baha
often used the mystics’ approach when interpreting aḥādīth or Qur’anic verses. An example of this is
his commentary on the beginning of the Sura of Rome (sura 30).8

The emphasis on ‘enjoining the good and forbidding evil’ is an element that this commentary
shares with a lot of Islamic literature. However, even notoriously wicked figures like the Pharaoh or
even Satan can in Sufi interpretations be seen as the only true worshippers of God in mystical

exegesis. Satan’s sin, for instance, for which he was cast down from heaven, according to the Qur’an,
was not to bow down before Adam when commanded by God to do so.9 Some mystics, such as Farīd
al-Dīn Aṭṭār, have said that he declined to do this because he was a true worshipper of divine unity
(muwaḥḥid) and a lover of God and he refused to bow down before anyone save God, even though he
be thrown into hell-fire. He accepted God’s curse as a robe of honour, saying: ‘to be cursed by Thee,
is a thousand times dearer to me than to turn my head away from Thee to anything else’.10

The point of interest in our context is that, in ‘Abdu’l-Baha’s commentary, the word fājir, usually
translated as ‘disobedient’, ‘evil’ or ‘wicked’, suddenly becomes positive, meaning fāriq, that is
‘distinguishing’ and ‘rich’. Whereas in the ḥadīth it is a man who claims to be a Muslim fighting for
God’s religion but is designated by Muhammad as fājir and a ‘man of hell-fire’; ‘Abdu’l-Baha only
elucidates the word fājir rather then commenting on the entirety of the ḥadīth. Muhammad’s intention
in his use of the word fājir, says ‘Abdu’l-Baha, is a person rich in the spiritual sense, who will aid the
Cause of God by separating between good and evil, forbidden and lawful, truth and error, and one
who has knowledge of the divine mysteries.

This interpretation by ‘Abdu’l-Baha may be compared to the interpretation of the same word,
fājir, made in the commentary by Ibn al-‘Arabi on a verse of the Qur’an dealing with Noah – indeed it
may be that ‘Abdu’l-Baha’s questioner was already familiar with this interpretation of this Quranic
verse and here ‘Abdu’l-Baha was extending a similar interpretation to the same word appearing in a
ḥadīth. In this verse of the Qur’an (71:27), Noah calls upon God to destroy all of the unbelievers (al-
kāfirūn): ‘For if Thou dost spare [any of] them, they will but mislead Thy servants, and they will bring
forth (give birth to) none but wicked and unbelieving ones (fājiran kuffāran).’ Ibn al-‘Arabi interprets
this verse using alternative meanings of the two words fājiran and kuffāran. The root f-j-r has a basic
meaning of cleaving or cutting. The usual meaning of fājir (of which fājiran is the accusative form) is
that of a wicked or evil person. However the root f-j-r also has meanings of breaking open (of a dam
or a river) in order that the waters may burst forth and also the breaking forth of the dawn and it is
these usages to which Ibn al-‘Arabi refers. Similarly the root k-f-r is usually associated with its
meaning of denying or disbelieving in God – and this is the evident meaning in this Quranic verse.
But Ibn al-‘Arabi has chosen the alternate meaning of covering or concealing:11

> ‘If you spare them’, that is leave them [as they are], ‘they will confuse your servants’, that is
> they will perplex them and bring them out from their servanthood into the mysteries of
> Lordship [that are inherent] in themselves, so that they will consider themselves as Lords
> after being servants. They will indeed be servants who are Lords. ‘They will only bring
> forth’, that is they will only bring forth and make manifest ‘one who breaks open (fājiran)’,
> that is one who makes manifest what is hidden, and ‘one who denies’, that is one who
> conceals what is manifest after its manifestation. They will bring forth what is hidden and
> then conceal it after its manifestation. And so the beholder will be perplexed, and will not
> know what the discloser (fājir) intends by his disclosure, nor what the concealer (kāfir)
> [intends] by his concealing – though they are [in truth] the same person.12

NECATI ALKAN

Abu al-A‘lā Afīfī, one of the foremost modern commentators on Ibn al-‘Arabī, has glossed the word
fājir thus:

> ‘ilā fājiran kuffāran’ and al-fājir is from [the root] al-fajr meaning to bring out or to make
> appear – that is to say he who causes the secrets of Lordship to appear in their place of
> manifestation (majālīhā).13

In his interpretation, ‘Abdu’l-Baha also uses an alternative meaning of the root f-j-r. He has bypassed
the usual meaning of al-fājir and has gone to the meaning of deviating or separating in his first
explanation and that of having much wealth or property in the second explanation.14

Provisional Translation:
He is God!
Some persons have imagined that the word fājir in the holy tradition ‘God doth give victory to this
religion (Islam) by means of a wicked man’ (inna’llāha yu’ayyidu hādhā’d-dīn bi-rajulin fājirin)
deriveth from fujūr (‘disobedience’, ‘wickedness’). However, the sacred intention of our Lord, his
Holiness the Prophet [Muhammad], peace be upon him, of the word fājir in the holy tradition, on the
contrary, is fāriq, that is ‘distinguishing’. This means that the Lord of Grandeur will give victory to
this manifest religion by means of the exertion of an honoured person who distinguisheth truth from
error. Such a person is endowed with enjoining that which is approved (amr-i ma‘rūf), and prohibiting
that which is rejected (nahy-i munkar);15 he is the manifestation of the holy verse ‘He is fearing not
the blame of any blamer’ (lā ta’khudhuh lawmatu lā’imin).16 It is an illustrious person who with
divine power distinguisheth pious deeds from evil acts, goodness from unseemliness, knowledge from
ignorance, faith from unbelief, trustworthiness from treachery, the accepted from the rejected,
guidance from the state of being astray, light from darkness, reality from metaphor, truthfulness from
lie, loyalty from cruelty, and the upright from the hypocrite. An honoured person, endowed with such
virtues and merits is certainly one who distinguisheth, teareth apart [the veils of superstition?] and is
superior.

The word fājir has moreover the meaning of ‘rich’ and ‘wealthy’. Therefore, the blessed meaning
of the holy tradition is this: the Lord of Grandeur will give victory to this glorious Sharī’ah by means
of a wealthy person. As thine excellency knoweth, richness and wealth are of two kinds; one is
physical, and it consisteth of pure gold. In the opinion of the people it is silver which imparteth joy.
This, however, has no value and quality. Even an imperfect man can attain this. The other aspect of
wealth and prosperity is true prosperity. This, then, is knowledge derived from God, true faith, divine
perception, human virtues, saintly merits, and spiritual honour and excellence. And to this person who
manifests this heroic deed belongs ‘a day God will compensate each out of His abundance’ (yawmun
yughni’llāhu kullan min sa’atihi).17 Therefore, the blessed meaning of the holy tradition is as follows:

13 Ibn al-‘Arabi, Fuṣūṣ al-Ḥikam 2:43.
14 See Lane, An Arabic-English Lexicon, see entry for f-j-r.
15 Amr bi’l-ma’rūf wa nahy ‘ani’l-munkar (‘Enjoining that which is good and forbidding that which is evil’) is one of the

> most important tenets of Islam; Qur’an 3:104, 110, 114. There are also numerous traditions calling attention to this; for
> example, Muhammad was asked what the right road is. He replied, ‘Lowering your gaze, refraining from harming others,
> returning greeting, and enjoining what is good, and forbidding what is evil’; Ṣaḥīḥ Bukhārī, vol. 8, book 74, no. 248.
16 cf. Qur’an 5:54: lā yukhāfūn lawmata lā’imin. This verse was a byword of the Sufi Malāmatiyyah movement, those who

purposely attracted the blame of people.

17 cf. Qur’an 4:130: Wa in yatafarraqā yughni’llāhu kullan min sa’atihi.

\[56\] ‘ABDU’L-BAHA’S COMMENTARY ON THE ISLAMIC TRADITION

the Lord of Grandeur will give victory to this glorious Sharī’ah with an all-wise person who is the
manifestation of faculties bestowed by God, the centre of divine knowledge, the dawning-place of
divine bounties, the possessor of human virtues, the revealer of the mysteries of reality, one who is
cognizant of the signs of prophethood, the knower of the Hidden Mystery (sirr-i maknūn), and one
who is aware of the Treasured Symbol (ramz-i maṣūn).18 This sufficeth as an explanation.

Latinised text of the tablet:
Inna’llâha yu’eyyidu hâza’d-dîni bi-recülin fâcirin (“Allâh bu dini bir fâcir vasıtasiyle
kuvvetlendirecektir”) hadîs-i şerîfteki “fâcir” kelimesi fücûrdan müştak olduğunu bazı zevât tasavvur
etmişlerdir. Halbuki Hazret-i Nebevî, aleyhi’s-salâti ve’s-selâm efendimizin hadîs-i şerîfte maksad-ı
mukaddesleri bilâkis olup “fâcir” kelimesi “fârık” mânasıdır, “ayrıcı” demektir. Yânî, Cenâb-ı Kibriyâ
bu din-i mübîni fârık-i hak ve bâtıl olan bir zât-ı mükerremin himmetiyle te’yîd edecektir. Böyle bir
zât, emr-i mârufla ve nehy-i münkeriyle muttasıf ve Lâ ta’huzuh levmetü lâ’imin (“Ayıpcıların
ayıplamasından korkmaz”) âyet-i kerîmenin mazharıdır. Hasenât ve seyyiâtı ve hüsn ü kubhu ve ilm ü
cehli ve imân ü küfrü ve emânet ü hiyâneti ve makbûl ü merdûdu ve hidâyet ü dalâleti ve nûr u
zulmeti ve hakikat ü mecâzı ve sıdk u kizbi ve vefâ ü cefâyı ve muvâfık u münâfıkı kuvve-i kudsiye
ile ayırır bir şahs-ı celîldir. Ve böyle fezâil ve hasâil ile muttasıf olan bir zât-ı mükerrem elbette fârık
ve hârık ve fâiktir.

Bir de kelime-i “fâcir”, ganî ve mütemevvil mânasındadır. Hadîs-i şerîfin şu hâlde mâna-yı
münîfi bu olur ki, Cenâb-ı Kibriyâ bu Şerîat-ı garrâyı bir şahs-ı ganî ile te’yîd edecektir. Malûm-i
âlileridir ki, gınâ ve servet iki türlü olur; biri servet-i cismânîdir ki sermâyesi zeheb-i ibrîz ve ind el-
halk fıdda-yı ferah-engîzdir. Bu ise o kadar meziyyet ve şerefi yoktur. Bir insân-ı nâkıs bile ona nâil
olabilir. Servet ve gınânın diğer kısmı gınâ-yı hakikîdir. O ise esâsı, ilm-i ledünnî ve îmânı hakikî ve
basîret-i Rabbânî ve fezâil-i insânî ve hasâil-i rûhânî ve şeref ü meziyet-i mânevîdir. Ve bu menâkıba
mazhar olan zâta Yevmün yuğni Allâh küllen min sa‘atihi (“Allah Kendi bolluğu ile herkesi zengin
ettiği gün”) dür. Şu hâlde, hadîs-i şerîfin mâna-yı münîfi bu olur ki: mazhar-ı mevâhib-i ledünnî ve
merkez-i maârif-i rabbânî ve matlâ-ı avârif-i sübhânî ve hâiz-i fezâil-i insânî ve kâşif-i esrâr-ı hakikat
ve vâkıf-ı rümûz-ı nübüvvet ve âlim-i sırr-ı meknûn ve ârif-i remz-i masûn olan bir zât-ı hikmet-
meşhûn ile Cenâb-ı Kibriyâ bu şerîat-ı garrâyı te’yîd edecektir. Ve’s-selâm.
