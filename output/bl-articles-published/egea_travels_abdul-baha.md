The Travels of `Abdu’l-Bahá and their Impact on the Press

A Survey

Amin Egea

The travels of `Abdu’l-Bahá in the West generated a great interest,
not only among His followers but also in public opinion. Hundreds
of personalities sought an opportunity to meet the Master in person
and tens of thousands attained His presence at any of His many
public addresses or read about Him in the press.

As part of an investigation of the first references to the Bábí and
Bahá’í religions in the Western press, particular research has been
carried out during the last decade on the attention that European
and American journals dispensed to `Abdu’l-Bahá and to the Bahá’í
Faith during the period of His travels throughout the West.

So far, this research has brought to light nearly eleven hundred refer-
ences made in journals, magazines and bulletins of the time. These
documents offer indispensable insights into the impact of the figure
of `Abdu’l-Bahá on public opinion at the time, while comprising an
important historical record of this momentous episode in the history
of the Bahá’í Faith.1

It would be impossible, in the span of this article, to offer a complete
review of all the references and accounts that have been gathered
about `Abdu’l-Bahá. Nevertheless, a few examples will be offered in
the following pages.

Lights of ‘Irfán Book Twelve

Before proceeding, it is necessary to give a word of caution about
the statements attributed to `Abdu’l-Bahá in these accounts. It is
impossible, except in a very few cases, to be certain that the words
reproduced by the press were the actual ones expressed by the
Master. On the one hand, it is impossible to know whether the words
of `Abdu’l-Bahá were always translated with accuracy and precision;
on the other, it is equally impossible to ascertain whether the notes
taken by the journalists were a faithful transcription of what they
had heard. Therefore, these documents, despite their interest and
their coincidence, in many cases, with the general tone of the teach-
ings of `Abdu’l-Bahá and of His communications, cannot, under any
circumstance, be regarded as authoritative.

The references made in the press about `Abdu’l-Bahá can be divided
in the following categories, ordered from lowest to highest impor-
tance in terms of the information they can offer about the travels and
their impact on public opinion.

1: General Reports on the Bahá’í Faith

The presence of `Abdu’l-Bahá in the West generated many reports
and articles devoted exclusively to describing and summarizing the
teachings of the Bahá’í Faith and its history. These articles often
included biographical notes about Him and were accompanied by
His portrait. This category of references to `Abdu’l-Bahá does not
provide many insights into His travels but is very useful to estimate
the volume of information about the Faith that the public received
during His travels.

> The length of these articles varies from full-page reports to brief
> texts such as this short article, sent through agencies under the title
“Leader of Bahaism Here”, which offered a very brief description of

The Travels of Abdu’l-Bahá and their Impact on the Press

the lives of the Báb, Bahá’u’lláh and `Abdu’l-Bahá, beginning with
the following comments:

> Abbas Effendi, known to his mil­lions of followers as Abdul
> Baha, the leader of “Bahaism,” is now on a visit to America.

> Never before in recorded history has one of the founders
> of an Oriental religious movement—since become world-
> wide—visited America. The personality and life history
> of one who has spent sixty years of his life in banishment,
> imprisonment and exile from his native land, makes a story
> of fascinating interest, vividly impressing upon the mind of
> the investigator the fact that the days of religious persecu-
> tion are not ended, and that even in this modern age a drama
> has been, enacted which for human interest equals or sur-
> passes Biblical history…2

2: Announcements and Advertisements

> Some of the talks given by `Abdu’l-Bahá were previously announced
> in the press. For instance, many of the talks that `Abdu’l-Bahá was
> invited to give in churches were previously announced in the religious
> sections of local newspapers. At times, when a public meeting with
`Abdu’l-Bahá had been arranged by the Bahá’ís or by other organiza-

tions, paid advertisements were also inserted in local journals.

These kinds of references to `Abdu’l-Bahá are of a very short exten-
sion. However, they contain important information such as the
precise dates and times of some of His talks, the addresses of the
places where He spoke, the title by which some of His talks were
announced, the name of the pastor of the church or the chairman of
the meeting that introduced the Master, and other details such as the
names of others who may have shared the table with `Abdu’l-Bahá.

Lights of ‘Irfán Book Twelve

For instance, on 5 May 1912, the New York Times published the fol-
lowing announcement of a talk that `Abdu’l-Bahá was to deliver a
week later to a meeting of the Peace Forum, in which Senator Towne
appears as a co-speaker:

3: General Accounts about `Abdu’l-Bahá
Many were those who had the privilege of meeting the Master. Some
of them later wrote vivid descriptions of their impressions about Him
and, in some cases, reproduced parts of their conversations with Him.
Of course, the accuracy and length of this kind of press references
vary greatly.

This category comprises those accounts about the Master that do not
focus on a particular event or episode during His travels but offer
general descriptions about Him or about His impact on people.

For instance, the following notice published in the Chicago Defender
about His first visit to Washington and His work for racial unity
stands as an outstanding testimony of the extent of the transforma-
tion that `Abdu’l-Bahá exerted on others:

TO BREAK THE COLOR LINE.

Abdul Baha, the Great Persian Philosopher and Teacher,
Aims to Unite the Peoples of All Races and Creeds In One

Great Bond of Brotherhood.

The Travels of Abdu’l-Bahá and their Impact on the Press

> Washington, D. C. May—Abdul Baha (the servant of God),
> the great Persian philosopher and teacher, head of the
> Bahaists, will reach Chicago next Monday. He comes to
> bring hope to the colored people.

> His visit to Washington has been a triumphal march. He has
> met and conquered Southern prejudices. He made addresses
> at Metropolitan A. M. E. church, at Howard University and
> at many of the white churches and halls and was listened to
> by many thousands of people of both races, who applauded
> his propaganda of the fatherhood of God and the brother-
> hood of man.

> He was the guest of one of Washington’s wealthiest women,
> one who moves in the most exclusive social circles at the
> capital, and yet her house has been thrown open to rich and
> poor and black and white. Southern people whose hearts
> were once filled with the most bitter prejudices against their
> brothers in black, have publicly acknowledged their change
> of heart and now they treat the colored people as brother
> indeed.3

4: Accounts on Talks and Activities of the Master
Many of the articles published at the time offer us unique stories and
accounts about some of the activities of the Master during His travels
and particularly about His public addresses.

Newspaper representatives attended many of the public meetings at
which `Abdu’l-Bahá was invited, writing afterwards their chronicles
for their journals. These chronicles offer interesting details about
some of His talks, such as the number of participants at the meetings,

Lights of ‘Irfán Book Twelve

the reactions of the public, or the remarks made by the chairman to
introduce the Master.

In some of the public meetings in which `Abdu’l-Bahá took part, He
shared the table with other lecturers, the names of whom are pro-
vided in some journals, along with a summary of their speeches, and
sometimes their comments on the Master’s words.

The accounts of the talks given by `Abdu’l-Bahá range from reports
of just a few lines summarizing what was said by the Master, to
detailed articles quoting at length from His words or paraphrasing
the entirety of His talk.

The following account published in the Washington Bee, for instance,
gives us a vivid description about the reaction of the audience after
His talk at Howard University:

ABDUL BAHA
Revolution in Religious Worship.

> On Tuesday, April 23d, Abdul Baha, the venerable Persian,
> leader of the Baha movement, which has several millions of
> followers throughout the world, and is attracting considerable
> attention in Washington, addressed the student and faculty
> of Howard University. The occasion was impressive and
> most interesting, as in flowing Oriental robes this speaker
> gave his message. He was received with such fervor that the
> breathless silence during his address was followed by pro-
> longed applause, causing him to bow his acknowledgments
> and give a second greeting.4

This account of the talk delivered at the Church of the Ascension
on 14 April 1912, besides describing the general environment of the

The Travels of Abdu’l-Bahá and their Impact on the Press

moment, quoted from the words pronounced by Rev. Percy S. Grant
in his introduction of the Master and paraphrased some of the words
of `Abdu’l-Bahá:

ABDUL BAHA PRAYS IN ASCENSION CHURCH
Leader of Bahai Movement, Speaking in Persian, Pleads for

the Oneness of Humanity.

HIS APPEARANCE STRIKING
Congregation Lingers After Service to See Him, In Oriental

Robes, Enter a Modern Limousine.

> In the Church of the Ascension, toward the close of the
> services, yesterday morning the big congregation knelt in
> the pews or stood in the aisle spaces with heads reverently
> bowed, and before the altar Dr. Percy Stickney Grant and
> his assistant, Mr. Underhill, knelt, while a venerable white-
> bearded Persian, clothed in his linen gaba and wearing
> his fez and his patriarch’s tabouch, stood and offered up
> a prayer in his native tongue. This was Abbas Effendi, or,
> as his followers call him, Abdul Baha Abbas, the Persian
> phi­losopher and interpreter of the Bahai revelation, who has
> come to this country to speak at the Lake Mohonk Peace
> Conference the latter part of this month and to spread his
> gospel of the fundamental unity of all religions.

> Dr. Grant was not the first clergyman to invite the Per-
> sian teacher, but his was the first invitation that Abdul
> Baha accepted, and there was little room left in Ascension
> Church when the 11 o’clock services began yesterday. As
> they progressed the venerable Persian took his place in the
> high-backed seat to the right of the altar, with Dr. Ameen
> Fareed, his nephew, standing by, ready to act as interpreter.

“It is to be our privilege this morning,” said Dr. Grant, “to

> hear one who has come out of the East, a new and great her-
> ald of good-will, one bearing a message of love to all mankind.
> Abdul Baha Abbas is a master of the things of the spirit. He
> comes from that part of the world where men meditate,
> where contemplation was born. He teaches the fundamental
> unity of all religions—a truth in which this congregation
> believes profoundly—and we welcome here one who may
> help the material fervor of the Occident to gain a new peace
> by the infiltration of the harmonies of the Orient.”

Abdul Baha spoke in Persian, with Dr. Fareed interpreting
a phrase at a time. Our material civilization, the Persian
teacher said, has progressed greatly with the perfection of
the crafts and the forward steps of material science, but our
spiritual civilization, that which is based on divine morals,
has declined and become degraded. We should strive, he
said, to make our material civilization the purest possible
medium, the most unclouded glass, through which the light
of our spiritual civilization must shine.

One of the things that supports a spiritual civilization is
peace, he said, and the body politic is in need of universal
peace, but the oneness of humanity, the human solidar-
ity, which has been the message of all the prophets, will be
achieved only through the spiritual power, for neither racial
distinctions nor patriotism can further it. The oneness of
humanity will come with the supremacy of the spiritual
civilization, and not while, as now, we are submerged in a
sea of materialism. The cause is progressing in the Orient,
he concluded, and the heavenly civilization is daily making
itself more manifest.

The Travels of Abdu’l-Bahá and their Impact on the Press

> These things Abdul Baha said in the few moments that he
> spoke, before he returned to his seat beside the altar. While
> the offering was being taken those seated near the front
> could see him delv­ing amid his robes, and finally his hand
> emerged with a bill that found its way to the plate. During
> the prayer he stood with his forearms extended, the palms
> of his hands turned upward, and as he finished he passed
> these over his eyes in a gesture that ended with the strok-
> ing of the patriarchal beard. A sense of the strangeness of
> the scene seemed to be with many in the congregation, and
> not a few lingered afterward to see the Persian philosopher,
> in his costume of the Orient, as he stepped into a modern
> Occidental limousine, to be whizzed uptown to his apart-
> ment at the Ansonia.5

> There are also many descriptions of the impression that `Abdu’l-Bahá
> left during His public appearances. A journalist who was present at
> the talk at the Ascension Church stated that “The venerable Oriental
> made a striking figure against the dark background of the chancel at
> the Church of the Ascension.” A similar statement was made by a
> reporter present during the address that `Abdu’l-Bahá delivered at
> the Church of Our Father in Washington on 21 April 1912: “The
> venerable Persian, with flowing white beard, his slender form envel-
> oped in a long tail garment reaching to the floor; and his snow-white
> hair surmounted with a white turban-like head covering, made an
> impressive picture.”6 Introducing an article about the participation of
`Abdu’l-Bahá at the American Unitarian Conference held in Boston

> on 22 May 1912, the Post commented: “Attired in the flowing robes
> of his native land, the apostle of the Bahai movement made a great
> impression on his listeners, many of whom were clergymen from all
> over the United States and Canada. His remarkable face, long white
> beard and his expression of thought was in keeping with the univer-
> sal principles of peace which the new religion stands for.”7

Particularly important are those articles that give information
about talks that were not transcribed by Bahá’ís and were there-
fore not included in any of the later volumes that compiled some of
the talks delivered by `Abdu’l-Bahá in the West. Thus for instance,
thanks to an article published in the Minneapolis Morning Tribune
on 23 September 1912, it is possible to conclude that the subjects
touched by the Master in His talk at the Temple Shaari Tov were
very similar to those expounded days later in the Temple Emanu-El
in San Francisco.

It is important to note that sometimes more than one reporter wrote
about a talk and thus sometimes different reports of the same event
were published afterwards. This circumstance allows in some cases
for a more complete and accurate perspective about what was said
and what transpired during a certain meeting.

5: Talks of the Master.

In addition to offering accounts about the talks of the Master, some
newspapers published complete transcripts of His lectures. For
instance, the text of His address at the City Temple in London—the
first public talk of `Abdu’l-Bahá in the West—was soon afterwards
published in the Christian Commonwealth (London)8 and then sent to
America where it was published at least in the Los Angeles Times,9 the
Buffalo Express10 and the American (Baltimore).11 Anoth9er example
of this is the talk given at the Emanu-El Temple in San Francisco, the
transcript of which was published days later in a special number of
the Palo Altan12—which also included the texts of other talks—and
then sent to London where it was published in the Christian Com-
monwealth. 13

Many other talks delivered in America, England, Scotland and
France were published by the press, some of which remain unpub-
lished in Bahá’í literature.

6: Interviews

> The interviews granted by `Abdu’l-Bahá to some journals and maga-
> zines are also an important repository of information about His travels.
> It would be very difficult to estimate the total number of interviews
> that `Abdu’l-Bahá gave to the press, but it can be stated that He was
> asked to give interviews in almost every city He visited. In some cases,
`Abdu’l-Bahá would receive a group of journalists in a single meeting,

> answering all their questions at the same time. Thus, in the ensuing
> days, different journals would publish accounts of the same meeting
> and produce enough material to ascertain the reliability and accuracy
> of the accounts.

Some of those journalists who had the privilege of personally seeing
`Abdu’l-Bahá have left for posterity a broad range of descriptions of

> His appearance and personality, as well as the impression He left
> on them.

For instance, a reporter of the Sun of New York, who met `Abdu’l-
Bahá at Hotel Ansonia soon after His arrival in the city, described
the Master in this way: “Abdul Baha is now nearly 68 years of age, but
forty years in a Turkish prison have made him appear of greater age.
He is of middle height, but has the appearance of a tall man because
of his great carriage. His long gray hair flows over his shoulders. His
broad beard and mustache are as gray as his hair. His forehead is
broad, full and high and his nose is large and aquiline. Abdul Baha’s
eyes are blue and large, his glance is penetrating.”14

A similar statement about His stature was made by Kake Carew
(Mary Chambers)15 in an article for the New York Tribune: “He is
scarcely above medium height, but so extraordinary is the dignity of
his majestic carriage that he seemed more than the average stature...”.
Carew’s article was very sarcastic, as was her style. Besides a writer,
Carew was best known for her caricatures and drawings of the per-
sonages she interviewed. As a matter of fact, the sarcastic and acid
tone she employed in her articles made them also caricaturesque.

The first portions of her article about `Abdu’l-Bahá were a mockery
of some of the people she met at the Ansonia, who were waiting to
see `Abdu’l-Bahá. But in describing the moment she saw the Master
and her meeting with Him, the tone of the articles changed radically.
Her interview with the Master and her visit with Him to the Bowery
Mission impressed her so highly that she concluded her article with
the following statement: “as I went out into the starlight night I mur-
mured the phrase of an Oriental admirer who had described him as
The Breeze of God.”16

Another New York reporter, a representative of the Times, described
the moment she entered `Abdu’l-Bahá’s presence in this manner:

> The reception room in his apartment was filled with flowers.
> There was not long to wait, for Abdul Baha is prompt and
> business like. In two minutes a young Persian opened a door
> and asked the reporter to enter.

> A rather small man with a white beard and the kindest and
> gentlest face in the world held out a hand. In his brown habit
> he was extraordinarily picturesque, but one did not think
> long of that, for he smiled a charming smile and, walking
> before and holding his visitor’s hand, he led her to a chair.
> Then he seated himself in another chair, facing her, and
> spoke in Persian to the younger man, who interpreted.

And after reproducing some of the comments of the Master, she added:

> The words delivered in this fashion, in short epigrams, took
> one miles and miles away from New York. Outside the win-
> dow was Broadway; under the building the subway; down-
> stairs was all the para­phernalia of a big hotel, but all these
> things were far less real than the picture the old teacher
> called up. The only things that seemed near were the moun-
> tains of Carmel, so near the Village of Nazareth, and the
> fields where the lilies grow more beautiful than Solomon in
> his glory.

> The strangeness of it all, the manner of speaking, the curious
> language, the unfamiliar dress might well have made the lis-
> tener awkward and ill at ease; but one does not feel awkward
> with Abdul Baha. The reporter had wondered just how to
> address him, but that seemed a foolish matter now. It really
> made no difference what you did or what you said, this kind
> old teacher would know that you meant well. 17

A Washington reporter who was present at a reception held at the
house of Mrs. Parsons described the Master as follows: “His features
are finely cut, and as he talks he peers into the faces of his listeners to
see if they comprehend his words. He chuckles to himself frequently,
when he makes a good point. His brow is high, and he has every
appearance of a deep thinker.”18

A Chicago reporter describing His appearance stated: “His eyes,
deep sunken beneath his shaggy eyebrows, flashed the vigor of a man
who, despite his seventy years, might be said to have no age.”19

Marion Brunot Haymaker, a columnist for the Chronicle-Telegraph,
who met `Abdu’l-Bahá at Pittsburgh stated: “And as you sit and
watch him as he speaks, noting his sad, kind eyes, his body, old before

its time, his nervous hands, so full of sympathy, you cannot help but
feel the personality of the teacher, and you believe, that truly he does
represent hospitality, and truth, and that to be humble, to be reverent,
to love all mankind are parts of him.”20

A reporter of the Evening Standard (London) also stated: “I was
astonished that Abdul Baha Abbas notwithstanding the fact that he
has passed the greater portion of his life in a prison, was able to show
interest and sympathy about the details of the life of Englishmen. He
asked me questions about my own life, and I described to him a jour-
ney which I had lately made to Russia. I found myself talking to him
as to one who had been a friend always.”21

To some of journalists `Abdu’l-Bahá offered His advice on journalism
and the role of the media and its professionals. An article appeared in
the Chicago Daily News describes in the following way the meeting
of a group of journalists with the Master and His comments about
the press:

> Without the door of the Plaza hotel suite a dish of radishes
> and celery, sprinkled with water, was discovered. This was
> part of the breakfast of Abdul Baha, who has in company a
> Persian cook. On the door was a sign, which read:

“Don’t ring the bell. Knock softly.”

> One of the delegation knocked softly. Ameen Fareed opened
> the door and down a long corridor ushered the visitors to the
> room of “the master.”

“Marhaba!” said a voice from the sunshiny room, speaking

the Persian word of welcome.

> Abdul Baha looked at each of his visitors intently from under
> white, bushy eyebrows. His dark skin was interlaced with
> numberless fine wrinkles. He wore a gray-white beard. His
> forehead was high and surmounted by a fez turban of fawn
> and cream color. His rather long hair hung in a single curl
> over the nape of his neck and to his shoulder blades. He wore
> a fawn colored robe with a cream sash, striped with a simple
> delicate pink and blue stripe, over which was a black gar-
> ment. On his feet were congress galters.

> He motioned his visitors to a seat and sat himself in a rock-
> ing chair near the bed. He allowed his glance to roam over
> the flower decorated room before he spoke through his
> interpreter…

“A reporter must be a purveyor of truth,” he said in Persian
> and Ameen Fareed translated. “The newspapers are leaders
> of the people and the people must be able to rely on what
> they read…”22

A representative of the Public Ledger (Philadelphia) described a
conversation with the Master in which the subject of journalism
was touched:

“Abdul Baha asks how many newspapers you have in this city?”

“Nine or ten, I think.” The information was transmitted.

The philosopher nodded and made a comment.

“Abdul Baha says that is very good,” volunteered the interpreter.

> And there and then Abdul Baha, who is only a few months
> free from 40 long years imprisonment for the expression of

his progressive teachings in the fever-racked penal settle-
ment at Akka, in Syria, delivered himself, of a series of
maxims for American journals and journalists. They were
punctuated by impressive pauses, and this is how interpreter
Ahmed Sohrab passed them across from the vernacular:

“Newspapers are the mirrors that reflect the progression or

the retrogression of the community.

“We may ascertain the progress or the retrogression of a

nation by its journalism.

“If journalists should abide by their duties, they would be the

> promoters of many virtues, among the community. Truth
> and the virtues would be foster­ed. This would be so if they
> carried out the duties incumbent upon them.

“Journalists must serve truth.

“Newspapers must investigate the means for the progress of

humanity, and publish them.

“Journalists must write significant articles, articles that shall

> foster the public welfare. If they so do they will be the first
> agents for the development of the community.

“From the days when newspapers were first published they

> have been the cause of progress; if they abide by their duties
> great will be the benefit forthcoming.

“Journalists must endeavor to make their organ a trustwor-

> thy agent, in order that their articles, may be effective in the
> hearts of the people and that the read­ers of these articles
> may be edified.”23

To the above mentioned Kate Carew `Abdu’l-Bahá commented:
“Remember, you press people are the servants of the public. You

> interpret our words and act to them. With you is a great respon-
> sibility. Please remember and please treat us seriously.”24 And to
a Christian Science Monitor correspondent in London He said:
“Those papers… which strive to speak only that which is truth, which

> hold the mirror up to truth, are like the sun, they light the world
> everywhere with truth, and their work is imperishable. Those who
> play for their own little selfish ends give no true light to the world
> and perish on their own futility. In carrying out the aims of your
> paper you are adding to the light. Go on, and let nothing stop you.”25

Many times `Abdu’l-Bahá was asked about His position on woman
suffrage and His attitude towards the feminist movement. To a
reporter of the New York City News Agency `Abdu’l-Bahá said:

“The modern suffragette is fighting for what must be, and

> many of these are willing martyrs to imprisonment for their
> cause. One might not approve of the ways of some of the
> more militant suffragettes, but in the end it will adjust itself.
> If women were given the same advantages as men, their
> capacity being the same, the result would be the same. In
> fact, women have a superior disposition to men; they are
> more receptive, more sensitive, and their intuition is more
> intense. The only reason of their present backwardness in
> some directions is because they have not had the same edu-
> cational advantages as men.

“All children should be educated, but if parents cannot educate

> both the boys and the girls, then it would be better to educate
> the girls, for they will be the mothers of the coming genera-
> tion. This is a radical idea for the East, where I come from,
> but it is already taking effect there, for the Bahai women of
> Persia are being educated along with the men.

“We have only to look about us in nature,” `Abdul-Baha

> continued, “to see the truth of this. Is it not a fact that the
> females of many species of animals are stronger and more
> powerful than the male? The chief cause of the mental and
> physical inequalities of the sexes is due to custom and train-
> ing, which for ages past have molded woman into the ideal of
> the weaker vessel.

“The world in the past has been ruled by force, and man has

> dominated over woman by reason of his more forceful and
> aggressive qualities both of body and mind. But the scales
> are already shifting—force is losing its weight and mental
> alertness, intuition, and the spiritual qualities of love and
> service, in which woman is strong, are gaining ascendency.
> Hence the new age will be an ageless masculine, and more
> permeated with the feminine ideals—or, to speak more
> exactly, will be an age in which the masculine and feminine
> elements of civilization will be more properly balanced.”26

These comments were reproduced afterwards in many journals. To a
representative of the New York Tribune `Abdu’l-Bahá said:

“If a mother is well educated, her children will also be well

> taught. If the mother is wise, the children will be wise; if the
> mother is religious, the children will also be religious. If the
> mother is a good woman, then the children will also be good.
> The future generation depends then on the mothers of to-
> day. Is not this a vital position of responsibility for women?

“Surely, God does not wish such an important instrument as

> woman to be less perfect than she is able to become! Divine
> Justice demands that men and women should have equal
> rights. There is no difference between them; neither sex is
> superior to the other in the sight of God.”27

In an interview for the American (New York), `Abdu’l-Bahá was
again questioned about the same subject:

> Do you find men or women the more religious—quicker to
> accept the truths expounded by you?”

“Those who have intelligence and understanding accept our

> teachings no matter whether they are men or women. For
> they are all intellectual and logical principles, and they are
> for the good of all humanity.

“For instance, we say that the people of the world should love

> each other, should serve each other; they should become as
> members of one family; they should throw into the corner of
> oblivion national, religious, patriotic and commercial preju-
> dices. They must put aside these narrow prejudices. They
> must become united, men and women; all.

“What do you think of the woman suffrage movement?”

> Today women, on account of certain reasons, have not yet
> attained to the vigor of men. But these differences are only
> accounted for on lines of education. In reality there is no dif-
> ference between men and women so far as their rights are
> concerned. They are all the children of one God. Both of
> them have capacities for progress.

Charlotte Despard, editor of the suffragist magazine The Vote
(London), speaking about an address by `Abdu’l-Bahá delivered at a
meeting organized on London by the Women’s Freedom League on
2 January 1913, stated:

> It was a memorable occasion, which will leave its impress on
> all those who were present. Here we are not so much con-
> cerned with what was said then, or at other times, during the
> visit to London of this strange and beautiful human being
> who is called by his disciples “the Servant of God,” as with
> the spirit that, wherever he goes, seems to radiate from him.29

7: Articles and Letters by `Abdu’l-Bahá

One aspect about the travels of `Abdu’l-Bahá that is not fully known
is the fact that, at the request of editors, `Abdu’l-Bahá sometimes
contributed to a publication with a letter or a tablet.

There are several instances of this in the Christian Commonwealth
(London) but we can also find “articles” by `Abdu’l-Bahá in the
Independent (New York), the Asiatic Quarterly Review (London), or
the International Psychic Gazette (London) among others. Some of
these texts were published along with photographs of the original
Persian text.

Just before `Abdu’l-Bahá’s departure from America, Albert Dawson,
the editor of Christian Commonwealth (London), requested from
Him a contribution to be included in an special issue of the magazine

that contained several communications from religious leaders. The
following was printed as a communication from `Abdu’l-Bahá:

> Convey my greetings to all your readers. I am extremely
> pleased and grateful for the attitude of The Christian
> Commonwealth, for its editor is indeed the servant of the
> world of humanity and the lover of universal peace. This
> noble editor is free from prejudice. Praise be to God that in
> America I established spiritual affinity between the hearts of
> various religions. It is my hope that through the favours of
> Baha’o’llah contention and strife may be abandoned entirely
> by the followers of various religions. All of them may be
> welded together. In the Synagogue of the Jews I established
> the validity of his holiness Jesus Christ, and demonstrated
> the prophethood of his holiness Mohammed. The all lis-
> tened most attentively. In brief, I said that the Christians did
> believe in Moses. They believe that Moses was the prophet
> of God. They believe that the Torah is the Book of God, and
> they all believe in the Prophets of Israel. Why should you not
> believe in Christ, acknowledging that Christ was the Word of
> God? What harm will come to you thereby? The result of this
> confession will be the entire disappearance of the prejudice
> which has been existing between the Christians and the Jews
> for the last two thousand years. When this address, delivered
> in the synagogue, is read, the reader will be most pleased and
> most enlightened.30

In addition to this, the press also reproduced or quoted from the text
of the papers sent by `Abdu’l-Bahá to international congresses to
which He was invited—such as the Universal Races Congress held
in London in 1911—or the texts of tablets sent to individuals like, for
instance, the two letters sent to the businessman and philanthropist
Andrew Carnegie.

***

The references to `Abdu’l-Bahá quoted previously are only a token of
the type of references to the Master that were published during His
travels. More than half of the known references were published in
the United States. Many other references were published in Canada,
France and the United Kingdom, totalling over three hundred. The
references published in Germany and Hungary, although fewer in
number, are also very interesting and illustrate other less known
episodes of His travels.

However, it was not only the press of the countries blessed by the
presence of the Master that echoed His travels. In practically all
countries in Europe, from Spain to Russia, news were published
about Him. In Latin America, articles were published in Argentina,
Brazil and Mexico. Some journals in Australia and New Zealand
reported on His visits to England. Even in Japan and South Africa
mention was made of the Master in some publications.
