> Who sees inside from outside?
> Who finds hundreds of mysteries even where minds are
> deranged?
> See through his eyes what he sees.
Who then is looking out from his eyes?

Jalálu’d-Din Rúmi (1207-12731)

“To see inside from outside” is the topic of this essay. The Persian
Sufi poet and mystic Rúmí, who was a contemporary of Thomas
Aquinas, stated in this poem the question that today arouses the
interest of the philosopher again. For several centuries the inside
remained unseen, the progress of science was focused exclusively on
the outside of this world and all what could be counted and
measured. Today it appears that the inside of things is in the process
of being rediscovered by psychology, by philosophy and, yes, even by
science.

The same thought has been fundamental to Phenomenology as a
philosophical system explaining Personal-dialogic Thinking:

> The study of human awareness as it is authentically revealed
> without assumptions and bias from abstract objectivity and
> one’s own agenda. It implies the use of intelligent
> subjectivity by authentic individuals in an encounter that is
> primarily dialogic. Its importance lies in the issue that one
> can then attempt to “look through the eyes of the o t her ”
> and then (ideally) experience the o t her with compassion
> and situated acceptance. The o t her then reflects back to us
> and we “come upon ourselves as stranger”. As with children
> looking in their parent’s eyes, we see ourselves to learn, and
to be gifted.2 (bold in the original)

In this description, the origin of spirit is based on the dialogical
nature of the human person. This spirit is given to the child looking
in their parent’s eyes. From this origin in the individual to the origin
of human spirituality as a whole, this thinking of dialogic
Personalism leads to the biblical tradition. This is expressed in John
1,1 “In the beginning was the word,” directing the attentive reader
back to Genesis 1:1–3 where it is stated: “In the beginning God
created the heaven and the earth. And the earth was without form,
and void; and darkness was upon the face of the deep. And the Spirit
of God moved upon the face of the waters. And God said ...”

The inside is seen through, and in the eyes of the other, through
and in the word of the other connecting the “I” and the “Thou” (you
singular)3. In establishing the unity of the vision and of the inside,
i.e., the spirit, Rúmí asks the question, who then is looking out from
his eyes? In the mystic Sufi tradition, and in most other mystic
traditions, what is seen in the inside is ultimately the Divine. Can we
see the inside if we do not see that the individual is always part of a
collective; that the position of the individual cannot be seen without
seeing the collective in which this individual finds its place? So seen
and unseen, or outside and inside is equally the topic of this paper as
the individual and the collective as expressed in the inside and
outside. The integration of the inside and outside, of the individual
and collective, of being and awareness is at the core of the integral
philosophy of Ken Wilber, whose writings will assist in this paper’s
quest to attain the “Truth of Thyself.”

What is the Truth of the self, one could ask? How does the self
relate to the internal and external, to the individual and to the
collective? To rediscover this tradition of the self and to fortify it
with modern science and the understanding of the development of
the individual and of humanity brings about Wilber’s integral
philosophy that has become a new, a worldwide phenomenon as the
translation of his books into 20 languages demonstrates. What is it
that made him the most read thinker not only in USA, but popular
also in countries such as Germany and Japan?

A note about popularity needs to be inserted here. Popularity is
not a criterion of truth, in fact, it often is indicative of a lack of
truth, or, as history has proven, it is an indication of what can be
called “half-truth.” Something becomes popular because it conveys
some truth, but in an easy form, which often disguises the
untruthful, but popular aspect of the statement. In the case of the
Integral Philosophy of Ken Wilber this issue will be explored below.

This paper is concerned with a vision that will shape the future; it
is trying to discover the way humanity sees itself and how it will try
to solve the difficulties the future might bring. Can philosophy be

Lights of ‘Irfán Book Six 89

the answer, or does it take more than human understanding? This
paper will bring together philosophical thinking of today and
another source of knowledge and understanding, i.e., the Revelation
of Bahá’u’lláh, (1817-1893), who is the founding prophet of the
Bahá’í Faith, and regarded as the Manifestation of God for our age.

The comparison of Wilber’s integral approach and Bahá’u’lláh’s
progressive Revelation will result in an attempt to formulate some
principles of an integral and progressive theology, an attainment that
can today only be envisioned in its outlines and that will have to be
developed over time.4 This comparison could further suggest some
ideas about the future Bahá’í commonwealth; and it will shed some
light from the “Truth of Thyself” as expressed by Bahá’u’lláh
towards the future of humankind.

Terry Culhane has made a connection between the philosophy of
Ken Wilber and the Revelation of Bahá’u’lláh in the “integration of
the tradition of liberalism with a genuine spirituality”.5 In the chapter
“Redeeming Modernity: Bahá’u’lláh and the Integral Philosophy of
Ken Wilber”, he compares Wilber’s integral philosophy with the “life
and work of Bahá’u’lláh” and finds that both have a rather
corresponding understanding of the development of modernity, of
its strength and pitfalls, and both come to similar conclusions.

This correlation can be noted, when looking at the tradition of
liberalism, but the work and life of Bahá’u’lláh and especially His
early mystical Writings go much farther than the philosophy of
Wilber and are based on an understanding of the human predicament
that transcends Wilber’s ideas. Culhane is aware of this when
discussing the concept of Irfan and the integration of the social
practices in the Revelation of Bahá’u’lláh.

The present essay intends to continue this dialogue between
Wilber and Bahá’u’lláh; it will extend it to a broader scope,
including the cosmological aspects of both system; and will,
furthermore, indicate in what special areas the Revelation of
Bahá’u’lláh is not only corresponding, but also transforming and
transcending Wilber’s system of integral philosophy and psychology.
Wilber’s subtle individualism, his mystic-pantheistic world view will
be placed in the light of the Revelation of Bahá’u’lláh, which
transcends the philosophical speculation and psychological research
of Wilber, as we will see.6

There is another topic, which needs to be raised. What is the
connection of these two systems, one a Revelation, the other a
philosophy, and both a century apart? We have to ask in what way
can the Revelation of Bahá’u’lláh be understood as the seminal
ground on which the philosophy of Wilber grew? This question has
been raised about other modern thinkers as well, for example Martin

Heidegger7 and, most of all, Teilhard de Chardin8, whose writings
were a precursor of Wilber’s thinking about the relationship of
matter and spirit.

It is this writer’s opinion that Bahá’u’lláh’s ontological
understanding of the universe corresponds, at least in some
important points, with the ideas presented and explicated by Ken
Wilber, who has most recently, i.e., more than a century after
Bahá’u’lláh’s Revelation, described the structure and integration of
being, in a potential “Theory of Everything.” Such a theory must
include all of reality in an abstract form and this is how Wilber
describes this theory. He reverted to the Greek form of the word
cosmos reintroducing the word “Kosmos,” implying that by this
spelling he means all reality or everything that is, not only the partial,
external and materialistic aspects, which is researched by modern
cosmology. He finds access to this Kosmos in an analysis of human
consciousness and of its development, and explicates it in his theory
of “all-quadrants” “all-levels”, which will be explained below.9

Similarly, in the writings of Bahá’u’lláh, it can be stated that the
truth of this universe is revealed in “thyself”, in you and me, in the
human predicament. It consists of four states, of Firstness and
Lastness, of Outwardness and Inwardness (the manifest and the
hidden),10 or as expressed in the analogous terminology of Wilber in
Individual and Collective, in Interior and Exterior states. For this
investigation and this writer, these words of Bahá’u’lláh have
become “mother words”, in the sense as explicated by Him:

> Every single letter proceeding out of the mouth of God is
> indeed a mother letter, and every word uttered by Him
> Who is the Well Spring of Divine Revelation is a mother
> word, and His Tablet a Mother Tablet. Well is it with them
> that apprehend this truth. (GWB 142)
In this paper these four “mother words” of Bahá’u’lláh, “First and
Last”, “Seen and Unseen”, “that are true of thyself”, will be analyzed
and an attempt will be made to explicate some of the meaning
contained in these terms. It is obvious that this attempt is rather
limited by the ability and background of this writer; on the other
hand, this limited perspective in combination with other
interpretations in the sense of consultation can and should contribute
to a better understanding of the writings of Bahá’u’lláh in the
ongoing dialogue of Bahá’í scholarship.

This has been stated by Steve Birkland when he said: “The beauty
of it is: the limitations are all characterized by the way our minds
have been trained, so the view of a mathematician, the view of an
artist, the view of a doctor, or the view of any particular person give
shape and form to this interpretation.” Furthermore “these words

Lights of ‘Irfán Book Six 91

would give rise through every individual’s mind, according to their
limitations and capacity, to things that we had no previous
knowledge.”11

Since these four terms in this combination are used only in the
early writings of Bahá’u’lláh, as far as they are published and
available, the context of these terms needs to be elaborated and its
correlation, as well as its distinguishing features, to Wilber’s
corresponding terms analyzed.

After a brief description of the concept of “individual         and
collective” of “interior and exterior” as used by Wilber,          and
clarifying these concepts in his philosophical system,             the
corresponding terms used by Bahá’u’lláh will be investigated       and
their place in the Seven Valleys will be evaluated.

Bahá’u’lláh describes them as being “conferred to thyself,” as gift
to every human individual and as descriptive of, not only, the human
awareness but of the human ability to be conscious of everything, to
reach out to the understanding of all that is. Traditionally, Aristotle
has described this fact already, when stating that “the human mind
(νουσ) can somehow understand everything (τα παντα)”. This
metaphysical line of thought leads us towards a better understanding
of being, of what reality is and what humans actually can be and
know. Ontology and epistemology, being and knowing, is both
expressed in these structures of thinking.

Therefore, in the next part of this paper, these four categories of
everything are being brought into the open and explained in their
Biblical, Qur’ánic and Bahá’í context. The explanation of these
concepts will become further elucidated in Wilber’s system of the
Four Quadrants. Wilber’s idea of “all levels” in this system can be
found in the modern, and especially Teilhardian, concepts of
progress and evolution, and in the Bahá’í principle of Progressive
Revelation. It is an expression of the idea of the maturation of the
individual and of mankind, both being basic concepts of the Bahá’í
Revelation.

It needs to be pointed out here that this writer did not follow this
line of thought in discovering this surprising correlation. In reading
the Wilber terms and their explanation he felt that they were
germane to the Bahá’í writings and Wilber’s concept could be used
to organize Bahá’í cosmology and provide a philosophical system for
the writings. Therefore, he attempted to correlate Bahá’í principles
with these Wilberian concepts and was in the process of writing a
paper on that topic. Purely accidental, so it seems, this author was
one evening reading the Seven Valleys and found to his total surprise

that Bahá’u’lláh uses terms, which Wilber has reproduced in his
philosophical scheme.

More accurately, it must be stated, that Bahá’u’lláh’s terms not
only anticipate Wilber’s understanding, but substantially improve on
it, even though, they were written about a century prior. And what is
even more surprising is the fact that they were written without the
benefit of the philosophical and psychological development of the
last century, on which Wilber’s understanding is based. As will be
pointed out below, one could wonder if the vision of Bahá’u’lláh
was not the seminal ground, which gave rise to the development of
the idea of a developmental psychology and integral philosophy, as is
presented by Ken Wilber.

This discovery was unexpected and almost shocking. It is hoped
that this paper will increase the understanding of these concepts and
their correlation, as the work on this paper has already substantially
improved the ideas on which this paper is based.

In fact, Bahá’u’lláh’s terms can improve the understanding of
Wilber’s scheme and make it better fitting with other concepts of
Wilber’s Kosmology, especially the concept of Holon. As we will see
later, while Wilber follows the Teilhardian concepts in describing the
internal and external aspect of consciousness and being, Bahá’u’lláh’s
concepts of First and Last much better describe the other
corresponding concepts of individual and collective used by Wilber.

Continuing this search we will attempt to delve into the range of
these four concepts as presented in the Bahá’í writings. This
excursion will assure that this investigation is in tune with the
understanding of the Revelation of Bahá’u’lláh. It further will bring
to light the breadth and depth of this Revelation and how it relates
to the most up to date understanding of this world as partially
presented by Wilber. This marriage of philosophy and theology in
understanding of this connection again will be indicative of our
time, which is a time of disintegration and integration as indicated by
Shoghi Effendi12.

In a final section the now elaborated concepts of the four
quadrants and of all the levels will conclude in a description of the
ontological aspect of the Bahá’í revelation and will bring new light
into the Wilber concepts of reality and awareness. This bringing
together of theology and some philosophical concepts, as well as,
psychology will impart more light into the Wilber metaphysical
system, not only indicating the severe limitations of this system, but
also its partial truth. This will open up the revelation of Bahá’u’lláh
to today’s philosophical discourse encompassing the whole globe.
The numerous translation and wide distribution of Wilber’s books
could assist in this development.

This paper, therefore, is an attempt to integrate two seemingly
diverse systems of thought and to compare them to each other.
What they have in common is the fact that both are in their
particular way universal and integral, in what they differ is that one
author is the prophet-founder of a world wide religion, spreading
quickly all over the continents and the other is a philosophical and
psychological thinker, who has found wide acceptance in the USA
and has reached international recognition. Both are separated by
more than a century, yet it does not appear that the later has been
much aware of the former.

We will encounter the difficulty of trying to understand the unity
that binds them together, the deeper meaning that is the basis of
both of their ideas and we will have to make some effort to explain
the relationship between them both. It would be too easy to just
assume that the truth is always the same, no matter, who discovers it
— that things hang together and that there is a causal relationship
between different points of view and thoughts, which develop
independently from each other, as long as they sound similar.

Or, one might think, all is just accidentally connected; just like in
a heap of sand the different grains have nothing to do with each
other, except their proximity and similarity. Another way to
understand a coincidence of similar thoughts is to assume that either
one has caused the other or that both have one or more common
causes that connects their ideas together.

There are certainly two basic types of thinking about these kinds
of relationships, as Teilhard de Chardin already noted:

> However, it is just at this point, in fact, that we meet an
> initial split in the thinking mass of mankind.” And further:
> “Beneath an infinite number of secondary differentiation,
> caused by the diversity of social interests, of scientific
> investigation or religious faith, there are basically two types
> of minds, and only two: those who do not go beyond (and
> see no need to go beyond) perception of the multiple —
> however interlinked in itself the multiple may appear to be
> — and those for whom perception of this same multiple is
> necessarily completed in some unity. There are only, in fact,
> pluralists and monists: those who do not see, and those who
> do.13
Both the Faith of Bahá’u’lláh and the integral philosophy of Ken
Wilber seem to be connected by similar understanding and are
sharing of a similar view, at least in some areas.

Shoghi Effendi, the official interpreter of Bahá’u’lláh’s writings
describes the God’s Plan, whose Author is Bahá’u’lláh, and whose

theater of operation is the entire planet14 in terms of integration15
and disintegration, of continuous and reciprocal reactions on each
other.

> Such simultaneous processes of rise and of fall, of
> integration and of disintegration, of order and chaos, with
> their continuous and reciprocal reactions on each other, are
> but aspects of a greater Plan, one and indivisible, whose
> Source is God, whose author is Baha’u’llah, the theater of
> whose operations is the entire planet, and whose ultimate
> objectives are the unity of the human race and the peace of
> all mankind.
In the Bahá’í understanding of history it is clear that the rapid
development of modern science and civilization is a response of the
entire world to the message of Bahá’u’lláh, who stated that the
world is pregnant of His Revelation.

The historicity of the Bahá’í worldview was portrayed by Saiedi as
one of the specific new aspects of the Revelation of Bahá’u’lláh. It
is based on the principle of Progressive Revelation and the Maturity
of mankind receiving this new message.16

This increasing integration of the world is described as well in Ken
Wilber’s Integral Philosophy, when he writes,

> I sought a world philosophy. I sought an integral
> philosophy, one that would believably weave together the
> many pluralistic contexts of science, morals, aesthetics,
> Eastern as well as Western philosophy and the world’s great
> wisdom traditions. Not on the level of details — that is
> finitely impossible; but on the level of orienting
> generalizations: a way to suggest that the world really is
> one, undivided, whole, and related to itself in every way: a
> holistic philosophy for a holistic Kosmos: a world
> philosophy, an integral philosophy.17

Wi l b er’s F our Quadrants

Wilber organizes the structure of reality as well as of human
consciousness in four quadrants, where the left two quadrants are
depicting the inside of things and the right two sides the outside of
things. The upper quadrants signify the individual aspect and the
lower two quadrants the collective aspect of reality and
consciousness.

Lights of ‘Irfán Book Six 95

Figure 1 : W i l bur ’ s F ou r Qu adr an t s

He further indicates that the philosophical tradition for several
thousand years, in East and West, has seen the structure of being in
similar ways, talking about the area of the “I” as the Beautiful, about
the area of “We” as the Good and about the right sight (the “it and
its”) as the area of the True. Combining the tradition and the
modern understanding of consciousness he added another aspect to
this structure, that of the levels. With this concept he introduces
into the structure of the perennial philosophy the modern idea of
historicity, of evolution and progress.

In this Wilber follows the view of Teilhard de Chardin and
others, who had indicated that the evolutionary aspect of reality was
a new understanding. Additionally, they had also described this
evolution not only in a biological Darwinian sense, but also much
more in an ontological sense, ascribing this concept of evolution to
the world and the reality of being. Teilhard had developed his view
from the scientific understanding of the human phenomenon, since
then many studies of psychology and philosophy have built a rather
substantial understanding of the progressive character of the
universe.

In Figure 2 (next page), the development of the individual
consciousness is shown as starting at the center and moving towards
the corners in a continuous evolution of awareness, of behavior,
social and cultural understanding. The same is true for the reality and
development of the universe, starting in the center with the big bang
and developing upwards and towards the corners in all four
directions.

Figure 2 : Devel o p men t o f Individua l C on s c i ou sness

What should never be overlooked is the fact that this
development is not happening in four different directions, but that
these four quadrants are integrated and corresponding aspects of one
and the same reality. Whatever develops or changes in one quadrant
has effects in all the others, and happens at the same level in all four
quadrants. This is cogently demonstrated in an overview of the
modern understanding of developmental psychology and is
demonstrated in the history of mankind as well.

Figure 3 (next page) is a graph of the four Quadrants from the
books of Wilber (SES 198, SP 26). Obviously, this scheme
presupposes the understanding that awareness is present at all levels
of development of the universe. The reader is invited to seek the
explanation for this understanding of awareness and the history of
this ontological and epistemological idea in the writings of Wilber.
Wilber describes the development of the universe in three spheres:
The understanding, development and integration of physiosphere
(matter), biosphere (living organisms) and noosphere (a Teilhardian
concept, meaning the sphere of the mind), is presupposed in this
scheme.
Wi l b er’s H ol ons

There is another Wilberian concept (originally coined by Arthur
Koestler) that is important for the understanding of this
metaphysical concept of integration, which again places Wilber in
the center of modern thinking and demonstrates that all of his
concepts are thoroughly integrated with the most modern
understanding of science. This is his concept of the Holon. This
Greek term stands in for the word whole but in a very specific sense.

Figure 3 : The F our Qu adr an t s : C on st ru c t ive a nd

Evo lu t i on a r y In te gr a t i on o f Aw a reness

Wilber explains that the world is not made of matter or spirit, who
in his and Teilhard’s system are never to be separated, but out of
Holons. A Holon is a whole consisting of parts in its own right, and
which is always at the same time a part of a higher whole.

Consequently, and that is important to the understanding of
Wilber’s system, everything is such a Holon, and dependent on what
place such a Holon is found it will be including always parts and be a
part of other wholes. So for example, the atom is a whole compared
to subatomic particles such as electrons or even lower quarks etc. As
soon as the atom is included in a higher whole such as a molecule it
becomes a part of this. And again, the molecule will be part of the
cell, and the cell of the organism and so fort, even into the spiritual

area of consciousness, this principle is continued. There is no end in
either direction. The reality consists of these Holons, which gradually
developed into ever-higher wholes.

We will encounter this concept again when attempting to
understand the statement of Bahá’u’lláh in the Seven Valleys. And
we will see, it is hoped, that this understanding from the revelation
of Bahá’u’lláh gives the concept of Holon a new and increased
theological and cosmological meaning. This new meaning transcends
the Wilberian concept, in a similar way as Bahá’u’lláh’s mystical
writings transcend the Sufi mystical tradition, by incorporating what
is good into His revelation and elevating it to a new level of
integration.

Towards a Bahá’í The ol o gy

Wilber describes evolution, which proceeds by separation and
following integration. When the separation becomes dissociation,
the evolution becomes pathological and integration cannot follow.
We will recognize these and other structures of the Wilberian system
later in the writing of Bahá’u’lláh. It should not surprise us that the
revelation of Bahá’u’lláh did not only anticipate the Wilberian
concepts, but that it further integrates them and transcends them
towards a more complete understanding of the Divine. Additionally,
it will become clear in this paper that this development can today be
more easily understood, after Wilber has developed his system of
integral philosophy and in this specific way, the theological
development depends on the level of philosophical understanding.
Here again we encounter the principle of progressive revelation.

To say it concisely following in the Bahá’í understanding of this
relationship, the Revelation of Bahá’u’lláh and its influence into the
world has made the philosophical progress possible, as seen in
Wilber’s system. And that system in turn prepares us to a deeper
understanding of the meaning of Bahá’u’lláh’s revelation. In this
sense, and in this sense only is a progressive Bahá’í theology possible.
This influence of the Revelation to philosophy was expressed in the
statement of Bahá’u’lláh:

> The essence and the fundamentals of philosophy have
> emanated from the Prophets. That the people differ
> concerning the inner meanings and mysteries thereof is to
> be attributed to the divergence of their views and minds.

(TB 145)
This progressive and historical principle does distinguish Bahá’í
theology from all previous unhistorical and static forms of theology,
which ended up in dogmatic constructs, philosophical speculations

and/or in a simple adaptation to the thinking of the times. With the
understanding that the world is “pregnant with the Revelation of
Bahá’u’lláh,” Bahá’í theology tries to trace the emerging thinking of
this New Order in all contemporaneously developments of the
noosphere, and then apply these findings to the Writings for better
understanding of the Revelation of Bahá’u’lláh.

Therefore, it is postulated in this paper that Bahá’í theology will
remain dynamic, up to date or “au currant” as the Guardian had
recommended and at the same time bound by the Covenant to the
Revelation of Bahá’u’lláh. It can remain at the zenith of modern
thought, without deviating from its origin in the Scriptures and
without losing its dynamic and progressive force, as long as it
remains integrated into the progressive revelation of God.

After this short excursion into the philosophic system of Wilber,
we will now turn our attention towards the early mystical writings of
Bahá’u’lláh, especially the Seven and Four Valleys.

Structure and Pur pos e of the S even Valleys

The Seven Valleys of Bahá’u’lláh “was written in response to
questions of Shaykh Muhyi’d-Din, the judge of Khániqín, a town
near the Persian border northeast of Baghdad. The judge was
evidently a student of Súfí philosophy, a variety of mysticism that
developed as a movement within Islam.”18 As it will become clear in
the following sections, we can, therefore, understand these writings
as an introduction to Bahá’u’lláh’s Revelation for all adherents of
mysticism in general and especially Sufi mysticism. In this paper, we
will attempt to use these mystical writings of Bahá’u’lláh in the same
sense of integration and transcendence towards the integral
philosophy of Ken Wilber, who includes Eastern and Western
mysticism into his view of the Kosmos.

The formal structure of this mystical composition is patterned
after the writings of the twelfth century Persian Súfi, Farídu’d-Din
‘Attár, called Mantiqu’t-Tayr (Language of the Birds). Bahá’u’lláh
changed the structure of this composition slightly, and the reason for
this change is one of the points of analysis presented in this paper.

Quite clearly Bahá’u’lláh places the Valley of Unity in the center
of this text, and organizes the three Valleys before and after around
this Valley. The first three Valleys are the spatial approach towards
the beloved, which is reached in the Valley of Unity. The next three
Valleys are more an explanation of the Valley of Unity than new
progressive steps beyond unity. This corresponds to the importance
of Unity in His Revelation. The other changes are following this

change, placing the idea of detachment into the last Valley as True
Poverty and adding Contentment in Place of Unification.

Figure 4 : V a l le y s o f A t t a r and Ba h á ’u’ l l á h

It is remarkable that the Four Valleys of Bahá’u’lláh have the
same structure as the Seven Valleys, but conclude with the Valley of
Unity, in which all of the three further Valleys are mentioned.19

The length of the different description of the Valleys gives us
another clue to the importance of the Valley of Unity. The Valley of
Unity is about triple the length of the other valleys. According to
Nader Saiedi, “Not a single word used by Bahá’u’lláh is arbitrary,
cosmetic, or unnecessary. His dynamic poetics unveils the beauty of
His mystical text.”20 Saiedi further comments that there are “at least
four fundamental principles that distinguish Bahá’u’lláh’s writings
from previous expressions of mysticism in general and Sufism in
particular.” First the principle of “absolute divine transcendence;”
secondly the “the idea of the spiritual journey is historicized;” thirdly
Bahá’u’lláh insists on, “harmony, not contradiction, between
mysticism and religious law, social teaching and institutions;” and
finally “mysticism is inseparably linked to the principle of the unity
of humankind as the ultimate goal of Bahá’u’lláh’s mission.”21

In this change we can already recognize the method Bahá’u’lláh
uses in order to friendly and positively accept all what is valuable in
the Sufi philosophy, yet carefully and gently moving the focus and
the conclusion towards His quite different philosophy as expressed in
His mystical writings. In the same manner He will explain in the last
Valley the total difference between Sufi philosophy and Bahá’í
mystic, stating that the Seven Valleys can be passed in one breath and
only after that the city of the heart opens up the seeker to the

beloved. It is necessary to thoroughly analyze the writings in order
not to overlook this tendency, which is common in all the early
writings of Bahá’u’lláh and which was clearly stated by Him:

It has been demonstrated that this process is pervading the whole
structure of Bahá’u’lláh’s Revelation,22 especially in His early
Writings and we will, throughout the Seven Valleys, observe this
principle of disclosure of truth according to the capacity of the
recipients. This is actually nothing else than a direct application of
the Bahá’í principle of Progressive Revelation; any Revelation of
God is adjusted to the capacity of the people at that time and
therefore, there will be a next revelation, as soon as humanity is
ready for it. In other words, God, through His Manifestations, gives
successive Revelations to humanity according to their ability and
progress. As explained above this principle does permeate the
development of the study and understanding of the Bahá’í
Revelation as well, even beyond the time of the actual revelation
until the time of the next revelation.

“That the Full Meaning may b e Manifest”

A note will here be inserted as to the process of developing this
paper. After studying Wilber and recognizing his internal correlation
with the Bahá’í Scriptures this writer attempted to demonstrate this
correspondence by explaining the Wilber scheme of Four Quadrants
with Bahá’í texts and placed the principles of prayer, work, order and
unity into them.

Figure 5

These four Bahá’í principles (Figure 5) seem to fit perfectly into
this scheme and explain how the Bahá’í life is organized and
regulated in the individual and collective sense. While this process of
understanding was in progress, this writer, seemingly accidentally,
read one evening the Seven Valleys and encountered the following
paragraph in the Valley of Unity:

> Although a brief example hath been given concerning the
> beginning and ending of the relative world, the world of
> attributes, yet a second illustration is now added, that the
> full meaning may be manifest. For instance, let thine
> Eminence consider his own self; thou art first in relation to
> thy son, last in relation to thy father. In thine outward
> appearance, thou tellest of the appearance of power in the
> realms of divine creation; in thine inward being thou
> revealest the hidden mysteries, which are the divine trust
> deposited within thee. And thus firstness and lastness,
> outwardness and inwardness are, in the sense referred to,
> true of thyself, that in these four states conferred upon
> thee thou shouldst comprehend the four divine states, and
> that the nightingale of thine heart on all the branches of
> the rose-tree of existence, whether visible or concealed,
> should cry out: “He is the first and the last, the Seen and
> the Hidden....” [Q 57:3] (SVFV 26-7)
> The first thought that struck this writer, were the concepts of
outwardness and inwardness, of which was stated that they are “true
to thyself” and “conferred upon thee”, clearly indicating that the self
is seen by Bahá’u’lláh in the same way as by Wilber, i.e., having an
outward side and an inward side. Without doubt there was more to

this statement. It took some days and nights with increasing
excitement to understand the rest of the statement.

The first and the last created the next hurdle, until the
explanation of Bahá’u’lláh was carefully studied. This statement
became clear when the text was considered, which said: “let thine
Eminence consider his own self; thou art first in relation to thy son,
last in relation to thy father.”

That can only mean that everyone is first and last, depending on
the context and that everyone is always both, first and last. Towards
a higher unit, like the family of origin, one is last, one is a member;
in respect to the lower unit, like the family one starts, one is first, the
father is representing the whole. Consequently, when this is
understood metaphysically, the term first can be replaced by the term
whole and the term last can be replaced by the term part.

Another and even more meaningful explanation of first and last is
the social one. A person is an individual in respect to subordinated
units; he is at the same time a member, or a part of any higher
collective unit, such as family, state and humanity. As a matter of
fact, when the Wilber terms of individual and collective are replaced
by first and last, the dynamics of this relationship is better expressed
and the concept of Holon immediately comes to mind.

A Holon is, as shown before, always a whole towards its
subordinated parts, and at the same time always a part towards the
higher wholes, in which it is included. And everything that is, and
especially man, is a Holon, every structure is hierarchically organized
in this tension between being the whole and the part, at the same
time and in a constant process of integration, the first and the last.
This is “true of thyself” as Bahá’u’lláh clearly states, this is, as one
could say, the essence of being human. This way of existing is
“conferred upon thee” for a specific purpose, i.e., “to comprehend
the four divine states.” This purpose elevates this structure into the
religious, it is the necessary condition of being able to comprehend
the divine and in that sense it is the structure of man created in the
image of God, as stated in the first book of the Bible.

What is given to us in creation, what is our true self, what is
conferred to us, is the potential ability to recognize the Divine states.
The Valley of Unity will further explain, how this is possible and in
other early writings, Bahá’u’lláh will explain that these Divine states
are the Manifestations of God in His Messengers. God the
unknowable manifests himself as the First and the Last, the Seen
(manifest) and Unseen (hidden) in His prophets, the theological
meaning of this will be explicated further in another Chapter.

Figure 6

The “Human G estalt: ” First and Last − Outward
and Inward

Internal and external23 as seen by Wilber is only one aspect of the
human consciousness and reality; the other is individual and
collective. The internal and external aspects are expressed as well in
the opposition between spirit and matter. These are not separate or
exclusive categories of being, neither is one dependent of the other,
nor can they stand alone and make the other dependent on the first.
They are mutually interdependent of each other. Teilhard de Chardin
has expressed that in many places, like in this quote:

> It (the spirit) in no way represents some entity, which is
> independent of matter or antagonistic to it, some force
> locked up in, or floating in, the physical world. By spirit I
> mean ‘the spirit of synthesis and sublimation’, in which is
> painfully concentrated, through endless attempts and
> setbacks, the potency of unity scattered throughout the
> universal multiple: spirit which is born within, and as a
> function of matter.24
The consequence of this understanding of the relationship
between spirit and matter is clearly demonstrated in Wilber’s opus,
where both are expressions of the Four Quadrants, the left handed
side is the spiritual or inner side of beings, the right handed side
exemplifies matter or the outside of things. The influence of this
thinking disavows the modern materialistic understanding of the
world, which was created by scientism defining being as matter and
reality as only that which can be measured and operationally defined.

First and Last is the other dynamic that describes humanity,
humankind is stretched out between these two poles of existence.
Individual humans are always being the last in relation to humankind
and in this lastness they become the first, in relation to themselves
and to what belong to them. This can be reversed, only being able to
be the first, being an individual; one can equally accept the lastness
of one’s existence. This understanding is expressed in the concept of
service to humanity.

This truth was expressed in the Gospels, where the first will be the
last and the last be the first, where the individual grain has to die,
before it can bring fruit in the many. This Qur’ánic term, of first
and last, as used and expanded by Bahá’u’lláh provides new and
improved understanding of the Wilberian terms individual and
collective.

So we have to ask, what happens when the Wilberian term of
individual and collective is replaced by Bahá’u’lláh’s terms of first
and last? Placing these terms from the Valley of Unity and
introducing it into the Wilber scheme makes this structure more
dynamic and the concepts used more appropriate, as will be shown
below.

While it is clear to Wilber that internal and external must be
understood in their mutual relationship, the relationship of
individual and collective becomes clearer when the mutually related
concepts of first and last are used to describe these quadrants.
Wilber25 points out that ignoring the internal aspect of the human
condition was the mark of modern scientism, or materialistic
scientific understanding of the world. This view of the Kosmos
declares that only matter exists, and all ideas related to the internal
aspect of man are nothing but fairytales, like Santa Claus.

A similar point can be made in regard to individual and collective
and it is the prevalent meaning of these two concepts. In this
understanding the individual is absolute, as it can be located in space
and time, counted and materially measured. The individual’s
relationship to the collective of humankind becomes negligible and,
in the Western world at least, could be ignored for all practical
purposes. The individual person has material reality, the collective of
people is usually seen only as an aggregate, a heap or a summation of
individuals and has no attached manning or importance in this
materialistic and scientistic (i.e., based on scientism not on science)
understanding of the world, as is prevalent in modern times. This is
basically the ideology of Western Individualism and Capitalism,
where everyone is for himself, is number one and has to take care of
others only to protect the self. This ideology assumed that the
natural selfishness of the individual would, if used rationally, provide

the perfect state for humanity, where everyone, out of selfishness,
will work for improving the fate of all.

Following this understanding, one can, and one often has
understood the term “individual” as a self-standing concept, as the
whole and independent essence of man. In common use the word
individual can stand for human being, for men or women. Saying
that someone is an “individual” gives that person special standing
and value in society. Modern Individualism has actually placed this
idea of the individual as an original descriptive term for the human
person, relegating any higher unit as a secondary element in the
human condition.

Liberal Individualism, which ignored or downgraded the collective
and social aspect of man, and its social consequence Capitalism
historically found its opposition in collective and materialistic
Communism and Socialism, which following the same logic in a
reversed way, ignored the individual and its value. Karl Marx called
this change from idealism to materialism a fundamental reversal and
transferred it from individualism to collectivism.

All of these ideologies are only partial conceptions of what human
beings are, and this partial and deficient vision of man has caused the
eminently destructive and devastating forces during the last century.
In fact, Bahá’u’lláh predicted this, when He warned the leaders and
all of humanity that ignoring His message will have devastating
consequences for humanity. Only in the tension and relationship
between first and last, inwardness and outwardness, and in
recognizing the divine states, can humanity exist and prosper.

Not recognizing the true states of man, not accepting in pride
that humans are the first as well as the last, created a devastating
force in this world that almost destroyed humanity and even today
could be causing ecological catastrophes.

First and Last in Bi b le and Qur’án

This section will be an overview over the passages that present the
concept of first and last in the Scriptures of the Jewish, Christian
and Muslims faith from Genesis to Qur’án.26 What it mainly shows
is the dynamic force of these words that were originally attributed to
God and than to God’s prophets. This process of attribution is
completed in the Revelation of Bahá’u’lláh, especially in the Kitáb-i-
ˆqán, the Book of Certitude, written by Bahá’u’lláh during the same
period the Seven Valleys were revealed. In this book the circle is
completed, from God to His Prophets, and to the believer, so the
meaning of this descending and ascending circle is recognized by the

faithful, as described in the Valley of Unity, because these four states
are “conferred upon thee”, to “comprehend the four divine states.”

Nader Saiedi has described this ontological circle, this arc of
descent and ascent in Logos and Civilization27, with special attention
to the Neoplatonic, Sufi and Islamic origins of these concepts and
their new interpretation in the Bahá’í writings.

> Above all, one important feature strongly distinguishes the
> Bahá’í concept of the ontological circle from typical Sufi or
> Neoplatonic ideas. In the Bahá’í writings, the stations of
> creation in the arc of descent do not start from the divine
> Essence itself but from the realm of the divine Will.
> Likewise, the arc of ascent — or the spiritual journey —
> terminates not in union with the Essence of God, but in
> union with the Will of God.... The Primal Will is also
> referred to as the Command (amr) or Word of God and, as
> such, refers to the common reality or essence of the
> Manifestations of God. (page 55)
> As the below quoted passages from the Hebrew and Christian
Scriptures demonstrate, this understanding was prepared in these
scriptures using the concept of first and last and of beginning and end.
From t h e Scriptures of t h e O ld T esta m e nt:

> In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth.
> (Genesis 1:1)
> Who hath wrought and done it, calling the generations
> from the beginning? I the LORD, the first, and with the
> last; I am he. (Isaiah 41:4)
Here the concepts of first and last28 are attributed to God, the
Lord of Israel. And the beginning is the creation of heaven and earth
by God. This direct relationship between God and his Creation as
described in Genesis is only possible in an early and primitive
understanding of this world. Evolutionary this is the message as
presented to a culture that is in the archaic or magical state of
development of human consciousness.29

Nevertheless, that does not mean that this description is wrong or
does not reveal truth, it just indicates the form in which the truth is
revealed. It further does not mean that people with higher developed
consciousness could not understand this message correctly, since any
higher level of consciousness includes, and elevate the lower levels in
a true dialectical process, as Wilber has described in most of his
books.

Another point needs to be made here, the fact that Isaiah
mentions the beginning and than speaks the words of God, who is

the first and with the last, who is He. Being the creator makes God
the first and the last and much could be said about this
understanding of the Bible, but a more complete exegesis of these
texts cannot be presented here.
From t h e Scriptures of t h e N e w T esta m ent

The letters of Paul were historically the first written documents of
the Christian Canon. Therefore, we present them first in the
description of the concepts of first and last.
1 Corinthians: 15:45:

> And so it is written, the first man Adam was made a living
> soul; the last Adam was made a quickening spirit.
Colossians. 1:15–20 Hymn about Christ, the head of all creation:

> Who is the image of the invisible God, the firstborn of
> every creature?
> For by him were all things created, that are in heaven, and
> that are in earth, visible and invisible, whether they be
> thrones, or dominions, or principalities, or powers: All
> things were created by him, and for him:
> And he is before all things, and by him all things consist.
> And he is the head of the body, the church: who is the
> beginning, the firstborn from the dead; that in all things he
> might have the preeminence.
> For it pleased the Father that in him should all fullness
> dwell;
> And, having made peace through the blood of his cross, by
> him to reconcile all things unto himself; by him, I say,
> whether they be things in earth, or things in heaven.30
About the seen and the unseen Paul has the following to say:

> For the things, which are seen, are temporal; but the thing,
> which are not seen, are eternal. (2 Corinthians 4:18)
> The letters of the Apostle Paul were the first written documents
about Jesus. Jesus is called the Last Adam and put together with the
first Adam. Further, what can be seen with the natural eyes is the
temporal world, the outside existence of Jesus, what cannot be seen
this way is the eternal meaning of Jesus, who is described by Paul as
being before all things and through his cross he will reconcile all
things unto himself, in that sense he is the last. In Jesus the circle is
completed that originated in the first Adam in creation and ends in
the last Adam, who will reconcile all things unto himself, whether
they be in earth or in heaven. This allusion to the Lord’s Prayer and

to the Return of Christ expresses the completion of the ascending
arc in Jesus, the Christ.

The same idea is expressed in the Gospel that was written as the
last of the Gospels. Christ is the Word, in the beginning.
The Gospel of John 1:1-8:

> In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with
> God, and the Word was God. The same was in the
> beginning with God.
> All things were made by him; and without him was not any
> thing made that was made. In him was life; and the life was
> the light of men. And the light shineth in darkness; and the
> darkness comprehended it not.
> There was a man sent from God, whose name was John. The
> same came for a witness, to bear witness of the Light, that
> all men through him might believe. He was not that Light,
> but was sent to bear witness of that Light. That was the true
> Light, which lighteth every man that cometh into the world.
> He was in the world, and the world was made by him, and
> the world knew him not. He came unto his own, and his
> own received him not.

And in the last book of the Christian Canon, in the Book of
Revelation 22:13

> I am Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the end, the first
> and the last.
In this last book of the Judeo-Christian Scriptures the circle is
completed. Christ is the first and the last, the beginning and the end.
In Christ’s final return God’s Kingdom has come “Thy kingdom
come. Thy will be done in earth, as it is in heaven.” (Matthew 6:10)
From t h e Qur’án

> All that is in heaven and earth gives glory to God, He is the
> Mighty, the Wise One. It is He that has sovereignty over
> the heavens and the earth. He ordains life and death, and
> has power over all things. He is the First and the Last, the
> Seen and the Unseen. He has knowledge of all things. It was
> He who created the heavens and the earth... (Q 57:1-3)
In t h e B a há’í Writings

In the passage from the Valley of Unity Bahá’u’lláh quotes this
verse from the Qur’án. The Manifestation as the First and the Last
and the Seen and the Unseen is one of the topics of the Kitáb-i-ˆqán
as in the following passage:

> Were any of the all-embracing Manifestations of God to
> declare: “I am God!” He verily speaketh the truth, and no
> doubt attacheth thereto. For it hath been repeatedly
> demonstrated that through their Revelation, their attributes
> and names, the Revelation of God, His name and His
> attributes, are made manifest in the world. Thus, He hath
> revealed: “Those shafts were God’s, not Thine!” (Qur’án,
> 8:17) And also He saith: “In truth, they who plighted fealty
> unto thee, really plighted that fealty unto God.” (Qur’án
> 48:10) And were any of them to voice the utterance: “I am
> the Messenger of God,” He also speaketh the truth, the
> indubitable truth. Even as He saith: “Muhammad is not the
> father of any man among you, but He is the Messenger of
> God.” (Qur’án 33:40) Viewed in this light, they are all but
> Messengers of that ideal King, that unchangeable Essence.
> And were they all to proclaim: “I am the Seal of the
> Prophets,” they verily utter but the truth, beyond the
> faintest shadow of doubt. For they are all but one person,
> one soul, one spirit, one being, one revelation. They are all
> the manifestation of the “Beginning” and the “End,” the
> “First” and the “Last,” the “Seen” and “Hidden” 31 — all of
> which pertain to Him Who is the innermost Spirit of Spirits
> and eternal Essence of Essences. (KI 178-9)
What He had indicated in the Seven Valleys, Bahá’u’lláh has
spelled out more directly in the Kitáb-i-ˆqán, about the different
Manifestations and their unity and what it means to follow them:

> Therefore, whosoever, and in whatever Dispensation, hath
> recognized and attained unto the presence of these glorious,
> these resplendent and most excellent Luminaries, hath verily
> attained unto the “Presence of God” Himself, and entered
> the city of eternal and immortal life. Attainment unto such
> presence is possible only in the Day of Resurrection, which
> is the Day of the rise of God Himself through His all-
> embracing Revelation. (KI 142-3)
The concept of Manifestation rounds up the circle of Creation
and Return, the arc of descent and ascent becomes closed in the
recognition of the Manifestation, who was in the beginning and is
the end of history. The progressive revelation and the return of the
Manifestations in every historical Prophet makes this circle the circle
of history, and it has a beginning without beginning and an end
without end, in other words this process of revelation transcends the
concept of time.

Wi l b er’s K os m os v ersus Bahá’í Co m m onwealth

It is important that we do not only point out the similarity
between Wilber’s philosophy and the statement of Bahá’u’lláh in the
Seven Valleys but also the fundamental difference. The main
difference is in the Worldview as presented by Wilber and in the
understanding of Reality as presented in the Bahá’í Writings. How
they overlap and how they diverge can be shown in the two figures
below, which were taken from a PowerPoint presentation of the
same topic. The first figure is taken from advertising to Wilber’s
Integral Institute and only augmented with statements indicating
Wilber’s understanding of God,32 which is strictly pantheistic and
monistic, strongly influence by Tibetan Buddhism.

Figure 7

He follows the main tradition of the mystics of the East and the
West and the critique Bahá’u’lláh applies to the Sufi mystic does
apply directly here also. Saiedi stated:

> Some of the Bahá’í writings employ mystical symbols and
> discourse, including, as in the Seven Valleys and the Four
> Valleys, quotations from classics of Sufi literature. At the
> same time, Bahá’u’lláh strongly criticizes particular
premises, doctrines and practices.

Bahá’u’lláh’s explicit rule on the assessment of others’ statements
is to be sympathetic and open minded in approaching them.
Therefore, He tends to emphasize the positive aspects and the
acceptable meanings that can be found in those statements.33

A similar approach is attempted in this paper, where both the pos-
itive aspects and the critique of Wilber’s philosophy must be presented.
Wilber, talking about religions, states:34

> The “great World Religions” (Hinduism, Buddhism,
> Christianity, Islam, etc.) that still exist today ( ... ) all arose
> in the general area of mythic-imperialism and all of them
> remain clothed to some degree in surface structures (and
> ethics) that are the two major technological epochs behind
> the times. None of those religions (nor the previous tribal
> religions) arose from within a global culture, and thus, none
> of them can (or will) speak to the rising world culture,
> however important their specific spiritual practices are (and
> will remain).
And he continues talking about a new global religion, without con-
sidering the possibility that this new religion might be already present!

> No, the new global religion(s) will come from within the
> new global culture and will not be anything simply grafted
> on from the past.

Wilber, in this statement, follows the modern understanding that
religion is a superstructure of a culture and caused by the culture, he
cannot perceive of the possibility that it is not the global culture that
will bring forth a global religion, but that it could be the opposite, a
global religion that is now bringing forth a global culture. He
expects the global religion to come from within the new global
culture, while it is this writer’s conviction that the new global
religion has laid the spiritual fundament of today’s global
consciousness.

The fact that the previous religions were presented in a different
cultural milieu, fits well in the Bahá’í concept of progressive
revelation, i.e., the religion is presented to the people in their
understanding, in their cultural awareness.

When the Bahá’í Universe is schematically depicted in the figure
below, the crucial difference is the position of the Manifestation, a
central aspect of the Bahá’í Worldview and understanding of
Reality. There is no monistic World Soul but the unknowable
Essence of God. All human striving and understanding directed
toward God is towards the Manifestation who manifests God to the
world. This follows the Biblical and Qur’ánic tradition, as pointed

out above. The global aspect of the new religion, the unity of the
world is in fact the fundament of the Bahá’í religion, and that 150
years before global consciousness has become a cultural idea today.

In the figure below (next page), several aspects need to be pointed
out: The direction toward the top is ending in the “Word of God” in
the biblical sense or the “Will of God” as the origin of the
Manifestation according to Bahá’í theology. God remains the
unknowable Essence and therefore Bahá’u’lláh talks about absolute
nothingness as the endpoint of the journey in the Seven Valleys. The
terms individual and collective are replaced by Bahá’u’lláh terms of
first and last, inward and outward. These four terms are conferred as
states to every human being, are described by Bahá’u’lláh to
comprehend the divine states:

> And thus Firstness and Lastness, Outwardness and
> Inwardness are, in the sense referred to, true of thyself, that
> in these four states conferred upon thee thou shouldst
> comprehend the four divine states.
Furthermore Bahá’u’lláh identified the same concepts with the
Manifestations of God, the founders of all world religions, whose
unity in their historical appearance is the basis of all human unity and
global understanding, and He describes that this is the Manifestation
of the same concepts as they have been applied to God in the
scriptures:

> They are all the manifestation of the “Beginning” and the
> “End,” the “First” and the “Last,” the “Seen” and “Hidden” –
> all of which pertain to Him Who is the innermost Spirit of
> Spirits and eternal Essence of Essences.
The scheme of the Bahá’í Universe that is presented here (see
Figure 8) includes Wilber’s Four Quadrant, but elevates and
transcends them in the light of the Bahá’í Revelation and indicates in
the sideline that Biblical referents to that understanding. In this
picture, these four terms of Bahá’u’lláh, the First and the Last, the
Outwardness and Inwardness are the means for humanity to
“comprehend the four divine states.” The same terms are again used
by Bahá’u’lláh to indicate how the Manifestations in their unity
“pertain to Him Who is the innermost Spirit of Spirits and eternal
Essence of Essences”.
Bahá’u’lláh explains further:

> Therefore, whosoever, and in whatever Dispensation, hath
> recognized and attained unto the presence of these glorious,
> these resplendent and most excellent Luminaries, hath verily
> attained unto the “Presence of God” Himself, and entered
the city of eternal and immortal life.

Figure 8

To this writer it appears rather convincing that the four states
described by Bahá’u’lláh are nothing else than a modern explication
of the words of Genesis that God created man in His image.

Concluding it could be stated that the integral philosophical
understanding of Wilber and his reasoning has helped to clarify the
words of Bahá’u’lláh in the Seven Valleys which He introduces with
the important statement “that the full meaning may be manifest.” In
the Valley of the Search Bahá’u’lláh encourages the reader to
identify with the traveler when He states:

> On this journey, the traveler abideth in every land and
> dwelleth in every region. In every face, he seeketh the
> beauty of the Friend; in every country he looketh for the
> Beloved. He joineth every company, and seeketh fellowship
> with every soul, that haply in some mind he may uncover
> the secret of the Friend, or in some face he may behold the
> beauty of the Loved One. (SVFV 7)
Could it be that in fellowship with a philosophical seeker of our
age and in the mind of influential thinkers in our days, we can
uncover the secrets of the Friend? This writer had the experience of
this meeting of the mind and has written these lines in the hope to
assist others on the way to the Friend, the loved One, on a journey
that is just a beginning.

Postscript

Figure 9 : The F our S t a te s

The presented structure can further be developed and the four
quadrants can be used to organize an integral Bahá’í worldview.
Additionally, the Bahá’í writings seem to organically fit into these
structures, which idea has been presented by this writer in several
deepenings and firesides. This exemplification will not be presented
here and can be attempted by any student of the Writings. Under the
four ideas of “prayer and mystical journey,” of “work and advancing
civilization,” of “administrative order and consultation” and finally
under the “unity of the world” all Bahá’í principles can be organized
and related to each other so “that the full meaning may be manifest.”
(SVFV 27)

The four states, as presented in Figure 9 above, are organized to
describe thyself and the whole cosmos, they are not only present in
man, they are the structure of all that is, or as ’Abdu’l-Baha stated in
a Prayer for the first School of Bahá’í Studies, they are embedded in
the heart of all that is:

> Lord, help thou thy loved ones to acquire knowledge and
> the sciences and arts, And to unravel the secrets that are
> treasured up in the inmost reality of all created things.
> Make them to hear the hidden truths that are written and
embedded in the heart of all that is.

\[4\] At the completion of this paper, this writer is researching the wider
context of Bahá’u’lláh’s statement in the Seven Valleys (see below) in
modern philosophy, especially in the light of the dialogical thinking of
Martin Buber and Ferdinand Ebner as presented in the above quoted
book by Augustinus Karl Wucherer Huldenfeld and others of his
writings as well as in the book by Bernhard Casper Das Dialogische
Denken, Franz Rosenzweig, Ferdinand Ebner und Martin Buber (The
dialogical thinking) Verlag Karl Albert, Freiburg, München, 2002. It is
hoped that this revised and extended edition of this paper can be
presented at an Irfan Colloquium in Germany. This will hopefully shed
some additional light on the value and the limitation of Wilber’s
thinking.

\[6\] Wilber’s psychological and philosophical system is based on the
Psychology of Transpersonalism. In an extensive and internal critique
of this philosophy, which places Wilber in a modern and Western
Buddhist tradition, Toegel has called Wilber’s position “Spiritual
Materialism.” Johannes Toegel, Eine Theologie des Zeitgeistes,
Darstellung und Kritik am Beispiel der Transpersonalen Psychology (A
theology of the spirit of the time, a presentation and critique using the
example of transpersonal psychology); Dissertation (28,684); University
of Vienna, 1991. Toegel reports that for three years he had tried the
same approach, while living in a cave in Tibet, where he eventually met
a true master and realized that true mystical experiences consist in
trust and acceptance and not in striving to higher transpersonal
techniques.

In a forthcoming paper this writer intends to explicate this concept of
Spiritual Materialism in relation to the Tablet of Wisdom of
Bahá’u’lláh.

\[11\] This investigation into these “mother words’ of Bahá’u’lláh need to be
understood in the sense as it was described at the meeting of the
American Bahá’í Studies (2003) in a talk by Steve Birkland: presented by

Susan Maneck at http://list.jccc.edu/read/?forum=bridges July 16,
2004:

> But ‘Abdu’l-Bahá said that God’s grace is like the rain: when it falls
> to the earth, as it’s falling it has no shape or form or limitations —
> it’s unrestricted. But the minute the rain hits the earth, it takes on
> the shape of whatever container or place it falls into: in a square
> pool it becomes a square; and in a round pool a circle, and so on.
> ‘Abdu’l-Bahá says that it’s the same with humans, that the Word of
> God is unlimited and unrestricted, but when it goes through our
> perceptual screen it takes on limitations. Whatever we offer in
> terms of our view, our perspective of the Word of God is limited.
> Previously unconfined, previously unlimited, now it takes on
> limitations. The beauty of it is: the limitations are all characterized
> by the way our minds have been trained, so the view of a
> mathematician, the view of an artist, the view of a doctor, or the
> view of any particular person give shape and form to this
> interpretation.
> I want to ask you to consider this as a challenge — that maybe all
> of us, as a contribution to the development of scholarship in
> Bahá’í Studies, even in the next few months, could think of one
> word from the Writings of Bahá’u’lláh that we could meditate on.
> Because then, He said, these words would give rise through every
> individual’s mind, according to their limitations and capacity, to
> things that we had no previous knowledge of. I want to finish by
> asking you to consider the value that those of you engaged in
> scholarly pursuits have right now, in my estimation.

\[16\] What is in Christian and Muslim interpretation the end of the world,
(i.e., the Return of Christ,) becomes “transformed into the doctrine of
historicity and historical consciousness,” (Nadir Saiedi, Logos and
Civilization, University Press of Maryland, 2000, page 68) This idea of
the evolution of mankind, as a theological concept, was previously
presented in a Christian context by Teilhard de Chardin who spoke of a
God of Evolution and of Christ the Evolver, (Christianity and
Evolution, Harcourt Brace & Company, San Diego, New York, London,

1971, especially in the papers on “Christ the Evolve, page 138, r,
Christology and Evolution, page 76 and The God of Evolution page
237). In his work Teilhard describes the necessity to understand religion
in the context of historicity or evolution. This topic will be resumed in
a later part of this paper.

\[19\] The relationship of these two texts needs further study, but to this
writer it seems obvious that the selection of Four and Seven Valleys
cannot be two different types of mystical discourse, rather they are two
different descriptions and the Seven Valleys follow closer to the
historical tradition, while the Four Valleys focus on the essential of the
message presented.

the issues of authority and democratic principles expressed in the letter

\[23\] Internal and external is used her in the same sense as all the other
corresponding antonyms such as: inward and outward, hidden and
manifest, seen and unseen, evident and immanent. In this paper we will
use these concepts as exchangeable, except where the context indicates
a special difference in meaning.

\[26\] There are certainly many correlates of these terms in the Eastern Trad-
ition of Buddhism and Hinduism, as well as in Confucian traditions,
unfortunately this author is not able to describe them in this paper.

\[28\] It needs to be mentioned here that in the book of Chronicle the term
first and last are used in another not totally unrelated sense, meaning

the whole of a life, for example in: 1Chron: 29:29: “Now the acts of
David the king, first and last, behold, they are written in the book of
Samuel the seer, and in the book of Nathan the prophet, and in the
book of Gad the seer.”

\[30\] The Jerusalem Bible , Doubleday & Company; Inc, New York 1966, a
modern critical translation of the bible by the Dominican Biblical
School in Jerusalem. It has the following footnote to this passage (page
345), which is very close to the understanding of Christ in the writings
of Bahá’u’lláh, who would fully agree with the description of Christ as
the visible manifestation of God:

> The subject of this poem is the pre-existent Christ, but considered
> only insofar as he was manifest in the unique historical person that
> is the Son of God made man (cf. Phil, 2:5-11) It is as the incarnate
> God that Jesus is the ‘image of God’ i.e., his human nature the was
> the visible manifestation of God who is invisible (cf. Romans 8:29-
> 39) and it is as such, in this concrete human nature, and as part of
> creation, that Jesus is called the ‘first-born of creation’-not in the
> temporal sense of having been born first, but in the sense of
> having been given the first place of honor.

This and similar Pauline statements about Christ have been the
foundation of Teilhard’s theology of evolution as expressed in Pierre
Teilhard de Chardin, Christianity and Evolution, Harcourt Brace &
Company, New York, 1969, see index under Christ, Pauline Attributes,
page 248, which books seemed to have been available to Ken Wilbur.
