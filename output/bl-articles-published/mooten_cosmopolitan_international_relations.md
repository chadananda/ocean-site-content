The Bahá’í Contribution to Cosmopolitan International
Relations Theory

Introduction to IR and to the Theme of Cosmopolitanism1

“There is no such thing as a perfect theory embodying the final truth, for the
truth which it is supposed to embody is in fact a thousand truths which
constantly grow and change.”2

Crawford shares the view that no intellectual field today suffers more “from
the ambiguity of its subject matter, or the contestability of its theories” than
International Relations.3 This ambiguity can be explained by “the age of
transition”4 in which many claim we live in, or by the complex, and thus
kinetic nature, of world politics in our times. Germane to this idea is that
many processes working below or beyond the limited territory of the
modern nation-state are challenging its ethos and so the very foundation of
International Relations, thus contributing to a growing sense of
“bewilderment”. This sense of bewilderment, which denotes a notion of
change in international politics, refers to the weakening of the powers of the
nation-state due to the presence of extra-national forces, such as the
question of human rights, the environment, increasing migration, modern
slavery, and the global economy. This perplexity is, furthermore, linked to
these global forces that destabilise the nation-state in its traditionally secure,
self-sufficient, and unquestioned authority. Hence, scholars and politicians
refer to the complexity of human interactions and relations, which foster a
sentiment of confusion.5 As Paul and Hall claim, “World politics in the
twenty first century is likely to be more complex than in previous eras”.6 In
Rosenau‟s eyes, such complexity has emerged from the increasing
interdependence and interaction of societies, and, therefore, the

Throughout this paper the initial IR will be used to designate International Relations Theory.

The concept of the “age of transition” has been expressed by diverse authors such as: Ervin Laszlo,

Affairs, (London: Frances Pinter Publishers, 1980)

“Conceivably we are so confused that even the fact of change perplexes us. Conceivably the forms of
world politics have undergone alteration while the underlying structures continue essentially unmodified”. (James
N. Rosenau, The Study of Global Interdependence, p. 12).

transnationalisation of world affairs, which brings with it challenges for
theorising IR.7

The existing sense of perplexity also arises from the fact that the diversity of
political thought in the discipline is sometimes prone to bring manifold
contradictory assumptions (especially within traditional orthodox IR theory)
about human and political behaviours, which are not easily reconciled.
These contradictory views are found in the two mainstreams of thought in
International Relations, one known as realism or the classical tradition, and
the other as liberal internationalism. Some – may be too simply – would say
that realism is a pessimistic view of IR, and others that liberal
internationalism is the optimistic voice of the subject.8 If we take the view
that liberal internationalism is in strict opposition to realism, it is possible to
describe liberalism as an optimistic and progressive viewpoint that considers
human nature either as good or as having the potential to overcome its evil
components. Liberal internationalism is, however, not the only possible
channel through which one can find a voice to express the dissatisfaction
with a static/sceptic worldview. Indeed, Persram notes that there is
simplicity in the account that there are many theories ‘but really only two’
about the „world‟.9 [Emphasis added] Beyond „utopia‟10 and reality we find
critical theories, including cosmopolitan democracy, critical international
theory, feminist approaches, or postmodernism, which offer „emancipatory‟
views, and call for the reconceptualisation of a world centred upon the fixity
of the nation-state and power relations. Since realism offers a myopic vision,
which emphasises short-term interests and the inevitability of conflict, I
choose to concentrate on the “optimistic” and “emancipatory” voices of IR,
which assert that change in international affairs is possible.11 This relates to
the idea that the realisation of the “good life” is not to be locked up within
bounded units12 and is a concern of the main approach scrutinised in this
work: cosmopolitanism, or the cosmopolitan tradition. This tradition is used
in two ways in this paper: firstly, as a description of the world around us, in
particular, the development of transnational processes, and secondly, as a
prescriptive or normative view of „what the world should look like‟.

Since E.H. Carr‟s The Twenty Years’ Crisis in 1939, a label has been put on liberal international
writers as “utopian” or “idealists”. This body of thought has, thus, been denigrated since the inter-war period. “It is
widely held that this critique had a devastating impact on the discipline”. (Peter Wilson, “The Twenty Years‟
Crisis and the Category of Idealism in International Relations”, in: David Long & Peter Wilson, (eds.), Thinkers of
the Twenty Years’ Crisis: Inter-War Realism Reassessed, Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1995, 1).

In this paper, it will be implicitly contended that beliefs can shape and influence our conduct. In other
words, in IR, the adoption of a positive and optimistic vision, and the belief that peoples and states are fully able to
use the faculty of reflection (belief) enhance the chances of building a more just and equitable world order
(conduct/behaviour).

This paper, which is based on various extracts of my doctoral work, will
scrutinise cosmopolitanism within IR theory; present the Bahá‟í model; and
correlate it to a cosmopolitan approach in IR. Bahá‟í thinking, on the one
hand, represents a strong reinforcement of the cosmopolitan tradition of
thought, underlining its validity and necessity, and on the other hand, centres
on the concept of the „oneness of humanity‟ in its belief-system, delineating
a rearticulation of ethical cosmopolitan roots.13 This principle reflects the
sameness (which does not correspond to homogeneity, but instead draws on
a commonality shared by humanity) of all human beings across the globe. In
other words, it emphasises that humanity constitutes one race and a single
people. To underline the non-homogenising effects of the oneness of
humanity, Bahá‟í writings always mention the latter “with its corollary of
unity in diversity”.14 The Bahá‟í model is not only based on the ethics of
oneness, but also on a recommended scheme of global governance that gives
practical expression to this principle. Accordingly, the Bahá‟í cosmopolitan
model supports the idea of moving away from an obsession with state
sovereignty, and embraces the broader and more inclusive level of humanity
that denounces unjustified division. Bahá‟í views add force to the argument
that the nation-state, as the primary unit of IR, has had its day, and thereby
highlight the need to include more flexible non-state actors. Robert Cox has
expressed the same idea when he avers that the state is just one of the forces
that shapes the present world, and admittedly not the most important one.15
The oneness of mankind, thus, needs to be recognised as international
politics have accepted the naturalness of political divisions, and a system
based on the spatial nature of the world. This principle is useful in
highlighting the artificiality of the concept of a closed, homogeneous, and
ethically deficient, nation. To another extent, it will be contended that as a
sacred approach with origins in the East, the Bahá‟í model can significantly
contribute to a growing Western secular cosmopolitan approach whilst
expanding its focus, thereby demonstrating the universality of the tradition.

The Nation-State as the Denial of the Oneness of Humankind

“Conceived of as an end in itself, the national state has come to be a denial
of the oneness of mankind, the source of general disruption opposed to the
true interests of its peoples…”16

This implies the reiteration of the oneness of humankind and universal ethical values. The Stoics
stressed the oneness of humankind and the unity of life, and “undermined the assumed natural political divisions
between Greek and barbarian”. (Derek Heater, World Citizenship and Government: Cosmopolitan Ideas in the
History of Western Political Thought, New York: St Martin's Press: 1996, 202).

As humankind is a natural unit, cosmopolitanism questions the nation-state,
a divisive unit, as the principle actor in IR. In this way, cosmopolitanism
challenges the notion of the natural permanency of a world community
structured around divided national communities with forever distinct and
unvarying populations. In a teleological sense, the nation-state is, thus,
problematic on the grounds that it divides the human race, whose “reality” is
one, and whose consequent aim is to reside in a world “polity”. Benedict
Anderson views the nation-state as an “imagined” and “limited” community
as “no nation imagines itself coterminous with mankind”: “the nation is
imagined as limited because even the largest of them, encompassing perhaps
a billion living human beings, has finite, if elastic, boundaries, beyond
which lie other nations”.17 Likewise, Eric Hobsbawn notes that nationalism,
child of mother nation, represents an exclusive concept, “nationalism...
excludes from its purview all who do not belong to its own nation, i.e. the
vast majority of the human race”.18 Since the nation-state divides the human
race, and oftentimes constructs aggressive and divisive borders, it cannot be
the supreme or final expression of human relationships on the planet, as this
would constitute a denial of our integral oneness. The nation-state embodies
a citizen-alien relationship that excludes all those who do not reside within,
whilst the cosmopolitan ideal ensures that all should have access to human
rights (albeit with reference to specificity)19 enshrined in a cosmopolitan
law, which are not dependent on a spatial and limited unit for its application.

Indeed, how can humanity find its natural home in a unit that has given rise
to xenophobia, genocide, or nationalism? The notion that the unit of the
political state needs a homogeneous cultural nation has, as a consequence,
led to excessive exclusivity and jingoistic intolerance. This idea has also
encouraged the suppression of what is perceived as threats to a
homogeneous community, and which ironically represents a completely
illusory notion, a „myth‟ or „artefact‟20 due to the increasing cultural
heterogeneity of its population that is caused by migration, diaspora, or
multiculturalism. In this regard, the Aristotelian notion of a good life locked
within a polis can no longer serve its purpose, and must be transposed onto a
more inclusive cosmopolis. Undeniably, the breakdown of the nation-state
system entails new conceptions of equality in terms of gender and race,
thereby confirming that the oneness of humankind, which works towards the
inclusion of vulnerable groups and the recognition of a diversified and yet
single human race, should be given greater attention in world affairs.

Here it is important to mention that feminist or postcolonial theories that
work toward “equal rights” promote the idea of the deconstruction of
dichotomies such as superior/inferior, male/female21 (with “female” having
here an inferior status). They mention the “political presence of newly
empowered subjects” underlining diversity, multiculturalism, and
environmentalism.22 Azza Karam notes, “Emancipatory futures are
inextricably linked to making the connections between local events and
global ones, and doing so through resistance and accommodating difference,
thus sharing in the kaleidoscope of power”.23 These paradigms also
contribute to refining the cosmopolitan project not as a „totalising‟ universal
project, but as one that seeks to unite and restore dignity,24 while preserving
an enriching diversity. Booth referred to this revised cosmopolitanism as
„sensitive universalism.‟25

Additionally, the nation-state represents a „problem‟ in present day politics,
as it is a confined unit that is given primary importance by IR through realist
ideology, while its sphere of jurisdiction and influence have been rendered
obsolete by more global processes. The nation-state, a particularistic unit,
cannot solve problems which are increasingly global, and which likewise,
demand global solutions. Indeed, there is enmeshment and interweaving of
processes in terms of economics and culture26 that cannot be locked within
territorial confines. Globalisation38, new technologies and the global and
instant accessibility of information have transformed the way peoples
interact with each other, becoming more integrated and closer than was
hitherto possible thereby challenging state sovereignty. The latter, as a case
in point, asserts principles of non-intervention that weaken claims to
humanitarian intervention, strengthening the dichotomy between us/them
and inside/outside. Human solidarity cannot be created within solidified
borders: it has to be diffused through porous borders and an inclusive
attitude of mind, i.e. a denkungsart that is advocated by cosmopolites.
Accordingly, the nation-state cannot be treated as the ultimate unit within IR
theory.

The Etymology and Evolution of Cosmopolitanism

The etymological root of “cosmopolitanism” finds its origin in the word
“cosmopolis” made up of the words “cosmos” (universe) and “polis” (city).
The original Greek definition of “cosmopolis”, thus, refers to the universal

“A local community with open boundaries, mutual responsibility…and no will to racial classification
is the political key to human dignity, worth, and freedom”. (Kate Manzo, “Critical Humanism: Postcolonialism

With the movement of peoples across borders, culture is also carried across borders, which
challenges the notion that culture can be kept „safe‟ in a particular „home‟.
city of humanity, which requires dwellers to give meaning and life to its
existence. The universal city, henceforth, goes hand in hand with a notion of
citizenship, and to be more precise, world citizenship. It is also possible to
trace the etymological roots of cosmopolitanism to the word “cosmopolite”
which means “citizen of the world”. This latter meaning is derived from the
ancient Greek “kosmos” (world or universe) and “politês” (citizen). Thus, it
is extremely relevant to correlate these two interpretations to the word
“cosmopolitan”, one being a political and emotional habitat, or universal
city, and the other being the more personal, and not yet legalised affiliation
to that sense of belonging, or world citizenship. The Stoics, who conceived
of the whole universe as a home for world citizens, conveyed this idea in
their teachings. “After all the etymology of cosmopolitan points to the
ancient Greek word of the polis, and its members the politeis”.27

Cosmopolitanism highlights the limitedness of political communities (the
polis was criticised by Stoicism), which now correlates to the inadequacy of
„reasons of state‟ or „reasons of political communities‟, when their fates are
entwined.28 Cosmopolitanism developed from being merely ethical, to more
political in the Renaissance and the Enlightenment, and present forms of
cosmopolitanism make use of both ethical and political arguments,
especially with regard to an „unequal globalisation‟ which must be brought
under control if all are to share in its benefits.

Cosmopolitanism has three main principles: individuals (not states)
represent the basis of political communities; the equal moral worth of all
human beings; and the importance of developing principles which can all be
shared with respect to differences.29 “This larger, open-ended, moral
perspective” Held notes, “is a device for focusing our thought, and a basis
for testing the intersubjective validity of our conceptions of the good. It
offers a way of exploring principles, norms and rules that might reasonably
command agreement”.30 In other words, cosmopolitanism starts from a
human perspective, rather than a state or a particular perspective, and
positively asserts that as humans we share commonalities and the propensity
to build peaceful societies.

Various strands of the tradition can be found in Stoic cosmopolitanism,
liberal cosmopolitanism (Enlightenment and modern cosmopolitanism), and
critical cosmopolitanism (a revisionist cosmopolitanism of the
Enlightenment), and share important points of convergence. They are
projects of universal emancipation, targeted firstly at the promotion of
„universal community‟ (ethical and/or political), the eradication of war, the

protection of human rights and the environment, the alleviation of world
poverty, and the safeguarding of cultural diversity. The project can be
regarded as an attitude of mind (a feeling of belonging to a universal society
of mankind, and not exclusively to one‟s nation-state), and as the desire to
create „world citizenship‟ institutions such as a global parliament, or an
assembly of world citizens at the United Nations (UN). The history of these
ideas is portrayed in Derek Heater‟s World Citizenship and Government:
Cosmopolitan Ideas in the History of Western Political Thought.
Cosmopolitanism contains various strands such as a legal cosmopolitanism
(the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, or the International Criminal
Court (ICC)), political cosmopolitanism (a global parliament, world
government, or global governance), and moral cosmopolitanism, on which
these two former notions are said to rest. As contended in this paper, these
three “cosmopolitanisms” are interdependent.

Cosmopolitan thinking began with an ethical and philosophical ideal of
„world citizenship‟ embracing the whole cosmos or universe (and not only
the world), and was characterised by the interplay of ideas, namely the ideas
that the polis was not a self-sufficient and perfect socio-political unit, that
moral considerations sustained by a system of natural law was essential, and
that human beings, despite all their variations, constitute a single human
species. This ancient cosmopolitanism eventually took another form in the
Middle Ages, being transferred to ideas of universal „religious‟ empires
based, as it was the case with Christianity, on a Christian version of a
universal Roman Empire (thoughts of World Empire, however, rarely
extended beyond Christian lands).31 With the demise of the idea of „universal
empire‟ that accompanied the emergence of an international system
composed of confined states, a „Westphalian system‟ of world order
emerged in which new ideas were conceived to sustain the concept of a
religious service to humankind. Even with the rise of states, the
cosmopolitan ideal found its niche in the Renaissance and the
Enlightenment in secular programmes that were devised to appease relations
between states, and which often represented embryonic plans for the United
Nations or the International Court of Justice (ICJ). Most of them were,
however, dominated by the fallacious notion that these relations were
condemned to be between states or between heads of states, and (except for
the notable exception of Crucé) were mostly governed by European
schemes and the Christian religion. In addition to Crucé‟s ingenuity, Kant
conceived of „a third level‟, namely a cosmopolitan law sustained by world
citizens that applies to the world as a whole, and not only to civil and
international levels.

Cosmopolitanism has, thus, been the interplay of ideas of world citizenship
and world state, the latter being predominant in the Middle Ages and
Enlightenment, and the former being prevalent in ancient times, in „Kantian‟

Derek Heater, World Citizenship and Government, 182

Enlightenment, and especially in the twentieth century (namely with critical
theories such as cosmopolitan democracy). The cosmopolitan ideal has
moved from an idea of moral cosmopolitanism, to expansionism based on
the rights of rulers, and finally to the notion of the respect of peoples based
on their rights and duties in the cosmopolis. As such, “It is highly unlikely
that a renewed medieval Roman Empire would have made provision for any
effective citizenly participation in the imperial political system.”
Cosmopolitan democracy theorists argue that global institutions should be
governed by world citizens, and highlight the nation-state‟s limitations as it
hinders the practice of global democracy and global values. The protection
of human rights advocated by most cosmopolitans represents an activist
cosmopolitanism.

Current cosmopolitanism can be illustrated by the inclination (Linklater
calls it a „moral anxiety‟) to help „foreigners‟ on the grounds of a common
humanity, due to suffering, starvation, poverty, in other words, a human duty
to respect and protect human rights and justice. Indeed, cosmopolitanism
undermines the nation-state by intervening beyond its limits, and by diluting
the notion of „foreigner‟, as it propounds the idea that morality does not end
at national boundaries. Cosmopolitanism challenges the predominance of
the nation-state on many fronts: firstly, as a result of our global and
technological age, and secondly, due to the incapacity of the nation-state to
foster morality beyond its boundaries (i.e. caring for „foreigners‟ is not as
relevant as caring for fellow-citizens). Furthermore, the reality of human
oneness calls into question the discriminatory divisions fostered by the
nation-state (the nation-state is most of the times a safe haven for citizens,
but treats non-citizens in less „significant categories‟ such as immigrant,
refugee, alien i.e. it creates an other). No longer a philosophical speculation,
or we might say an „ideal‟, cosmopolitanism has become tangible as
testified by numerous non-governmental organisations (NGOs), the
movement of peoples and ideas across borders, and the reality of dual and
multiple loyalties and citizenships.

International organisations and a supranational unit such as the European
Union (EU), and other regional bodies demonstrate the inadequacy of the
nation-state, and the advantage to unite not only for common benefits, but
also for increasing understanding and communication across porous borders.
Cosmopolitanism, in our times, constitutes a reaction against material global
interdependence, the impotence of the nation-state to satisfy our needs
(functionalism), and the rejection of discriminatory prejudices based on
gender, race, class, or nation (a reiteration of the oneness of humankind). We
can, indeed, state that we are moving towards a more mature form of
cosmopolitanism, namely a more sensitive cosmopolitanism that wishes to
be identified with the constituency of the human species. Furthermore, the
twentieth century has seen decolonisation (notwithstanding that the
pernicious effects of slavery and colonisation have continued socio-political
and psychological repercussions on the body of mankind), and technological

and communications revolutions (globalisation), which if managed in an
inclusive way, offers inviting conditions for the realisation of a cosmopolis.

It is also relevant to note that the term “cosmopolitan” is presently used to
define the reduction of state sovereignty in cases where other institutions
collide with the nation-state‟s powers to decide.32 Indeed, Mary Kaldor, who
speaks in favour of “cosmopolitan theory” and transnational democracy,
does not envisage the occurrence of a world state or government, but rather
the surpassing of state sovereignty in certain instances. Cosmopolitans argue
that the ever-increasing presence and participation of a global civil society,
as manifested in the growing number of NGOs or intergovernmental
organisations (IGOs), and locally based grassroots social movements,
constitute the upcoming signs of a political cosmopolitan reality testifying
to the moral and economic interdependence of humanity. Indeed,
cosmopolitan political reality now comes from the grassroots rather than
from the top, implying that the people, who consider themselves as world
citizens should be the true decision-makers. “[World] citizenship operates
both „vertically‟ and „horizontally‟. For example, a world citizen may wish
to concentrate on campaigning for the reform of the UN or supporting
organisations devoted to relieving world poverty”.33

Numerous theories have been devised towards an international political
system, in the forms of federalism, functionalism, or cosmopolitan
democracy, which although differing in their manifold aspects, reflect the
need for a cosmopolitan political agenda. Thus, cosmopolitanism is not
solely a theory; rather it encompasses all of the theories of International
Relations that transcend the nation-state (with or without questioning its
existence): a cosmopolitan tradition rather than a theory of IR.

Realism, Liberal Internationalism, and Critical Theory

Realism – realpolitik, power politics – can be traced back to the Greek
historian Thucydides in the fifth century BCE, or to Renaissance diplomat,
historian and playwright Macchiavelli, and later with twentieth century
figures such as Morgenthau or E. H. Carr, mostly influenced by the
American critic and theologist Reinhold Niebuhr.34 Realist IR is the most
„anti-cosmopolitan‟ strand of IR theory. Indeed, the unbridgeable gulf
between domestic and international politics is a central theme in realist
thought, whereas cosmopolitans envisage a form of world political
organisation (not necessarily a world government) with universal moral
principles.35 Cosmopolitanism, hence, comes as the antithesis or critique of

realist IR (the latter being one of the many theories of IR),36 and therefore it
is essential to review the characteristics of realism.

Several aspects of realist theory can be contrasted with the cosmopolitan
tradition. More importantly, realists believe in the irreconcilability of the
domestic and international spheres, whereas cosmopolitans envisage the
pacifying of international relations through the promotion of the concept of
„humanity‟, thereby dismissing the relevance of a sound dichotomy between
„domestic‟ and „international‟. Realists emphasise the anarchic nature of
international politics, which is opposed to the sovereign and secure
character of the state, the basic unit of analysis in realism. The absence of
anarchy in the domestic realm provides for the possibility of progress and
security. By contrast, the international is characterised by the “endless
competition for power and security in the world of states”.37 Hence, the
international system is doomed to be controlled by power politics, which
promotes little prospect for change and peace, and which, accordingly,
impedes the imagining of a „post-sovereign‟ system. In brief, cosmopolitans
view international politics as a unified sphere in which the division between
the domestic (internal) and international (external) should be reconciled.
Indeed, for the cosmopolitan, the domestic and the international spheres are
artificial divisions in the face of a common humanity, whereas the realist
sees them as fixed in the realm of anarchy. For cosmopolitans, this flawed
division prevents the fostering of the means by which a „post-sovereign‟
world can be imagined, constructed, and improved upon, whereas for
realists, this contention is fallacious as the world is divided along permanent
and antagonistic boundaries.

Although the study of International Relations was born within „idealism‟
after World War I (WWI), it “had been effectively refounded after World
War II on realist premises, and has exerted its dominion as a paradigm in
International Relations”.38 With the liberal internationalists claiming that
people had a genuine desire for peace, and the power of world opinion
would sustain the Wilsonian League of Nations, it was then easy, with the
examples of Mussolini and Hitler, to describe these ideas as simply wrong.39
Liberal internationalism was held to have false perceptions about human
nature, and was perceived as a flawed world outlook. In the 1930s, Reinhold
Niebuhr reflected on these matters, and argued that liberals exaggerated “the
capacities of collectivities of humans to behave in ways that were truly

Jack Donnelly, Realism and International Relations, 28. The origin of the dissimilarities between the
two perspectives can be found in the „first great debate‟ between the realists and the „idealists‟, which was centred
on the possibility of the pacification of international society through a sense of moral obligation to human beings
in the world. (Andrew Linklater Rationalism, p. 93.) In this debate, cosmopolitan concepts such as collective
security, the rule of law, and peace are contrasted with the realist terms „balance of power‟, „anarchy‟, and
„sovereignty‟. (At that time, cosmopolitan IR can be related to liberal internationalism.)

moral”.40 This statement, thus, supports the realist view that morality is
unattainable between collectivities, and stands opposed to the cosmopolitan
belief that peaceful societies are attainable.

In the twentieth century, realism has had a great impact on International
Relations as an academic subject, but has also influenced many American
politicians (for example Kissinger), and can be said to have greatly shaped
twentieth century world politics. Donnelly remarks, “Realism should not be
ignored. But it should not be allowed to shape the study and practice of
International Relations, as it has for so much of the past half-century”.41 It
was mostly E. H. Carr, with The Twenty Years‟ Crisis: an Introduction to the
Study of International Relations, who reshaped the discipline along more
realist lines at the end of World War II, taking into account what he regarded
as the „neglected‟ factor of power. Carr stated that this work was “written
with the deliberate aim of counteracting the glaring and dangerous effect of
nearly all thinking, both academic and popular, about international politics
in English-speaking countries from 1919 to 1939 – the almost total neglect
of the factor of power”.42 To another extent, at that time, his aim was to
discredit the other paradigm of International Relations, which he named
utopianism.43 Carr criticised the normative character of liberal
internationalism, and its neglect of „power‟ as a crucial factor in IR. Liberal
internationalists, on the contrary, stressed the concepts of morality and
altruism in global politics.

Realism, with the experience of the inter-war years, remained the main
paradigm of International Relations, especially at the height of the Cold War
and Super Power competition. However, realism did not go unchallenged,
and was criticised in the seventies by proponents of the „complex
interdependence paradigm‟.44 As a response, this paradigm was discredited
and opposed by the proponent of neo-realism, Kenneth Waltz, who claimed
that the notions of interdependence were extravagant.45 Kenneth Waltz‟s
main claim is centred on the belief that states operate in a self-help system
(or in an anarchical international system), where no higher form of authority
prevails. Moreover, they are only preoccupied with their own welfare and
security, and regard other states as potential threats. This self-help system
forces them to adjust their power, and to be constantly aware of the power
position of other states, which gives rise to a balance of power regulating
world affairs in an anarchical system.46 Whereas Morgenthau in „traditional
realism‟ (as Waltz named it) argues that power is rooted in human nature,

“Waltz points to the anarchical condition of the international realm which he
claims imposes the accumulation of power as a systemic requirement on
states”.47 The latter treats the international system as a separate domain,
whereas the former relies on reductionism. The main ideas of neo-realism
are, thus, that anarchy and the distribution of power between states define
the international system (as they shape state behaviour), and that states
would not abandon egoism and self-interest for international order.

What is here relevant, especially in relation to cosmopolitanism, is that like
realism, neo-realism still concentrates on the nation-state as the main unit.
This state-centric view is in opposition to cosmopolitan views, which
criticise the idea of the nation-state as a permanent and principal fixture of
the international system, and which promote a normative international order
where human values and acts of cooperation can prevail. There has been,
nonetheless, an attempt to render realism more „normative‟. The English
school of realists and rationalists has stressed the importance of
international society or a world of states as opposed to universal categories
such a humanity or sub-state entities.48 Although the English school is often
seen as part of realism and recognises conditions of anarchy,49 it
„acknowledges that the sense of belonging to the community of humankind
has left its civilizing mark upon the state and international relations”.50 This
school of thought stresses the concept of international society: “the English
school of International Relations shares with realist/neo-realist theorists the
importance of anarchy, war, and balance of power, but only as ideas that
shape political practice, rather than as laws of nature or unchanging
phenomena deeply embedded in the international system”.51 International
society can be depicted as sharing normative standards and rules, in the
form, for example, of international law. International society, based on a
system of states, can still share common aims, rules of conduct, and
organisations – thus blending realist aspects with a more normative outlook.

Realism, Human Nature and the Centrality of Territorially Organised
Entities

Realism, even if it acknowledges the potential for change, confirms that it
occurs within the limits of the struggle for power enshrined in a static
human nature. Gilpin notes that realism is distinguished by its “pessimism
regarding moral progress and human possibilities”.52 Human nature is

Scott Burchill, Realism and Neo-Realism, p. 78. The systemic level relates to theories that conceive
of causes operating on the international level, in addition to national and individual levels. Reductionist theories,
for Waltz, only operate on the national and individual levels. (Ibid., 92).

viewed as inherently pugnacious, is egoistic at its core, and leads to
immorality and conflict in international affairs. Morgenthau, for example,
observed, “the conflict-ridden international arena” is the consequence of
“forces inherent in human nature” and that “the animus dominandi” or a
natural will to power characterises human beings. Machiavelli expresses
human nature as “insatiable, arrogant, crafty, and shifting, and above else
malignant, iniquitous, violent, and savage”.53 In the early twentieth century,
Niebuhr in his Moral Man and Immoral Society (1932) has greatly
influenced the realist movement and main realist writers, such as
Morgenthau and E.H Carr. Niebuhr took the original sin as the explanation
for an evil human nature. In his eyes, “the ultimate sources of social
conflicts and injustice are to be found in the ignorance and selfishness of
men”.54

Change, from the realist perspective, can, thus, either be cyclical or
stagnant, whereas from the liberal viewpoint, it follows a unilinear evolution
towards progress, whether this is ethical or material.55 Moreover, realists
uphold that since relations between states are sustained by order, a balance
aimed at preventing war between nations should prevail, whilst liberals see
the necessity of a system of collective security in order to sustain peace.
Realists rely, firstly, on clearly defined units represented by states, which are
at the centre of their political theory, and secondly, on the notion of
sovereignty, which “defines what the state is”.56 With the emergence of new
actors, realists recognise that the nation-state is not the only actor on the
international scene, but nevertheless, hold that it is the most important one.
Indeed, this view is found in the words of neo-realist, Stephen Krasner
(1976): “In recent years, students of International Relations have
multinationalized,           transnationalized,        bureaucratized        and
transgovernmentalized the state until it has virtually ceased to exist as an
analytic construct. This perspective is at best profoundly misleading”.57 Neo-
realists such as Waltz regard states as the “unitary actors with a single
motive – the wish to survive”.58 This point is also stressed by Griffith
“Realism conjures up a grim image of international politics. Within the
territorial boundaries of the nation-state, politics is an activity of potential
moral progress … Beyond the exclusionary borders of sovereign presence,
politics is essentially the realm of survival rather than progress”59 – a view
that denies the cosmopolitan contention that the international realm does not
have to be characterised by recurrence, fixity, conflict, and power politics.

It is often put forward that realists see the world as it is and „idealists‟ as it
should be. It can also be argued that realists only rely on the present, whilst
„idealists‟ wish to change the latter. In this way, realism seems to be „stuck‟
with present events. Furthermore, with the demise of the Cold War, realism
has lost its appeal. It is a theory functioning within defined limits: it is taken
aback by the occurrence of sudden and unexpected events. Theory should,
however, seek to predict and find solutions to the world‟s problems, rather
than lay down a set of negative facts about the reality of human nature, and
the presumed ensuing impasse in which world politics finds itself. Indeed, if
this were so, there would not be much point writing about International
Relations theory as the only contemplation would be the image of a gloomy
world doomed to remain static. Realism focuses on present facts, rather than
on their development over time, as testified by its attachment to the nation-
state system. Accordingly, it focuses on temporality, rather than evolution.
Booth states, “the realist tendency to privilege the short term can lead to a
kind of myopia in which broader problems are not detected until it is too
late to do anything about them”.60 Miller also shares the view that “it is
wrong to assume that the only reality is that which presents itself for today
or tomorrow.”61 Recently, cosmopolitanism underlines that the conservative
nature of realism has neglected the logic of change, the existence of plural
actors in world politics, and has been an obstacle to the creation of an
alternative world order.62

Cosmopolitanism and Current IR Theory

In the last two decades or so, IR has taken on a new turn, a „post-positivist‟
turn, no longer centred upon a state-centric theory, namely that of realism,
and allowing for the (re-) emergence of normative International Relations
theory, which emphasises the potential transformation of the world through
criticism of power politics. This has propelled IR theory into a „new‟
perspective, and opened the way for alternative views that are no longer
regarded as unfounded, but instead as an enrichment of IR. The rationale
underlying theoretical inquiry is no longer solely problem-solving
(safeguarding the status quo by legitimising power relations), but more
critical (having the imaginative potential to anticipate alternative models of
world order). The last two decades or so have seen a clear rejection of
positivist assumptions and a return to the normative side of the discipline
(how the world ought to be), founded after WWI upon liberal
internationalism or „idealism‟. It is held that the IR theorist can no longer be
totally detached from the object of enquiry (feminists call this „embedded
knowledge‟), and that theory helps construct the world, and is not outside of
it (constitutive theory). Robert Cox notes, in this context, that theory often

„precedes and shapes reality‟ indicating that theorists cannot stand outside
the political and social world they examine.63

Cosmopolitanism, as a normative approach, can be found in different forms
in many theories in normative IR. It can be liberal, critical, feminist, green,
or even postmodern. However, what is certain is that it cannot be realist.
Political liberalism is “a universalist doctrine and so is committed to some
notion of a universal community of mankind which transcends identification
with and membership of the nation-state community” it “has faith in the
capacity of human beings to solve seemingly intractable problems through
collective action”.64 Cosmopolitanism is enshrined in contemporary
liberalism as “liberals have offered a conception of community and identity
which spans the entire planet”.65 Its normativity surpasses liberal
internationalism, however. It can be found in critical theories, and in some
aspects of postmodernism.

Critical theory argues that counter-hegemonic forces challenge prevailing
institutional and political arrangements. These counter-hegemonic values
are transnational in nature and based on “an alternative set of values,
concepts and concerns, coming from organisations like Amnesty
International, Oxfam, and Greenpeace”.66 Postmodernists also reinvent
International Relations along a new ethics with „others‟. This postmodern
cosmopolitanism, as it is here argued, is based on a new „solidarity with
others‟. “Postmodernists want to rethink the basis... for notions of morality
and ethics, so that they are sensitive and responsive to differences”.67 The
label „critical‟ is sometimes referred to as feminist, postmodernist and
critical international theories, and the term „critical‟ shall be employed in
this sense in this paper, in other words, as a body of thought in IR which
questions the fixity of the prevalent order. This body of thought, thus,
intends to „denaturalise‟ notions of strangeness and territoriality, which have
become increasingly familiar. As Seyla Benhabib observes, “The dogmatism
of knowledge is shown to be the dogmatism of a way of life”.68

The days when realism reigned supreme over IR have drawn to a close.
Cosmopolitan approaches are increasingly gaining ground, as together they
make a strong case for the validity and contemporary necessity of
cosmopolitanism. They highlight growing interactions that strip borders and
exclusive political communities of any sound coherence and meaning that
they might have enjoyed in the past.

The Bahá’í Faith as a Cosmopolitan Model

The Bahá‟í Faith and Bahá‟í cosmopolitan thinking originate from Asia,
most particularly nineteenth century Persia, and have, as such, a non-
Western origin, unlike most known cosmopolitan perspectives in IR. Heater
notes, “Turning to modern times, several writings advocating a world
community or a formalised world constitution were produced in Asian
countries in the nineteenth century. Of the Asian texts, we may particularly
cite the teachings of the Persian prophet Bahá‟u‟lláh (b. 1817), the
originator of the Bahá‟í Faith (which has also attracted many adherents in
Western countries)”.69

Indeed, cosmopolitan principles constitute the core of the Bahá‟í Faith as
“the universality of humankind, including the social and political oneness,
are fundamental principles of the Bahá‟í Faith”.70 The Bahá‟í writings, no
less than earlier prophetic religions, concern themselves with governance.71
Some Bahá‟í writers underline that it is a novelty that the founder of a world
religion advocates global federation as a means to accomplishing world
unity. “Bahá‟u‟lláh brought, for the first time in religious history, explicit
teachings about the need for an international federation capable of
harmonizing the affairs of an interdependent world and bringing about
world peace”.72 This call for global governance could be explained by the
global intent and character upon which the Bahá‟í Faith bases its principles.

For its adherents, however, what some might call „Bahá‟í ideas‟ are not just
the enunciation of certain principles, and the attempt at their practical
realisation, nor a mere political philosophy that is relevant to cosmopolitan
ideas, but rather a whole new divine revelation that answers to the social
and spiritual needs of an ever interdependent humanity. In contrast to
„secular‟ cosmopolitan trends, the Bahá‟í writings rely on a historical
process that is divine in nature, hence finding several references to the
intervention of „God‟, (or what some political philosophers such as Kant
called „The Hidden Plan of Nature‟),73 and underline some certitudes about
some aspects of the future. However, it is noteworthy that cosmopolitanism,
in the Bahá‟í ethos, is not just a vague appeal to human brotherhood, but
contains clear guidelines on the elaboration of a system of global
governance and peace in our times.74 It is this peace programme, which at its

Origins of Bahá’í World Order Themes

The Bahá‟í Faith is centred upon three main figures – The Báb (1819-1850),
Bahá‟u‟lláh (1817- 1892), and „Abdu‟l‟Bahá (1844-1921) – Who, for the
first stage of its development guided the Bahá‟í community at large. These
three figures are not just the leaders of the Faith: for its members, the Báb is
a herald-prophet, who along with bringing a whole new message to
nineteenth century Iran (the religion He founded is referred to as the Bábí
Faith) ushered in the start of a new religious cycle and announced the arrival
of the founder-prophet of the Bahá‟í Faith, Bahá‟u‟lláh. Bahá‟u‟lláh
appointed His son „Abdu‟l‟Bahá to guide the community after His passing.75
The writings of these three figures constitute the Bahá‟í sacred scriptures, as
Hindus look to the Vedas and Bhagavad-Gita, Christians look to the Bible,
or Muslims to the Koran. Interestingly, and in accord with their beliefs,
Bahá‟ís consider the aforementioned Holy Scriptures, along with those of
the main religions, to be divine in origin, hence refusing to think of their
Faith in superior and different terms, but just as a further element in the
revelation of the divine process.76 Indeed, Bahá‟u‟lláh enjoins all to
“Consort with the followers of all religions in a spirit of friendliness and
fellowship”.77 As Udo Schaefer notes, “Such a belief necessarily results in
the rejection of excluvism whereby one religion is regarded as the sole
bringer of salvation…The reconciliation of religions is a major goal of
Heilsgeschichte (salvation), because it is the foundation of „world wide
reconciliation‟ called for by Bahá‟u‟lláh, and which is the prerequisite for
lasting world peace”.78

„Abdu‟l‟Bahá designated His grandson Shoghi Effendi Rabbaní as the
interpreter of the writings, and five years after Shoghi Effendi‟s passing
away in 1957, the Universal House of Justice, the first international
permanent institution of the Bahá‟í Faith, came into being. This event
signalled the start of a new governance system within the Bahá‟í community
that was no longer based on a single figure. Along with the sacred scriptures
of the Faith, the writings and statements of Shoghi Effendi and the
Universal House of Justice constitute the official guidelines and literature of
the Faith. „Abdu‟l‟Bahá interpreted and clarified the writings of

that aim to carry forward humanity‟s collective life on the planet” (Moojan, Momen, The Bahá’í Faith: A Short
Introduction, Oxford: Oneworld Publications, 1999, 63).

Whilst the Báb and Bahá‟u‟lláh are regarded as „Messengers of God‟, „Abdu‟l‟Bahá, in the eyes of
Bahá‟ís, is a perfect exemplar of their teachings.

See Shoghi Effendi, The World Order of Bahá’u’lláh: Selected Letters, Wilmette: Bahá‟í Publishing
Trust, 1991, 119.

95\. This and other statements have inspired the Bahá‟í International Community to be pro-active in the Inter-Faith
dialogue.

Ethic”, Dialogue and Universalism, 1996, 6 (11-12), 27-28.

Bahá‟u‟lláh, and Shoghi Effendi further elucidated the principles of world
order that rests on the firm foundation of the oneness of humankind. Shoghi
Effendi gave this principle considerable attention during his „mandate‟ as
Head of the Bahá‟í Faith from the time of his designation as Guardian of the
Bahá‟í Faith in 1921 to his passing away in 1957.79

Bahá‟u‟lláh‟s message of world order and peace is mainly expressed in a
series of letters sent to the world secular and religious leaders.80 Most of the
statements of „Abdu‟l‟Bahá were pronounced during His travels to Europe
and Northern America between August 1911 and June 1913. During this
journey, „Abdu‟l‟Bahá „warned of an imminent world war and the forces of
social dislocation that such a conflict would unleash and elaborated
Bahá‟u‟lláh‟s principles of global concord‟.81 The writings of Shoghi Effendi
on the matter are enfolded in a series of letters entitled the World Order of
Bahá‟u‟lláh written between 1929 and 1936. Indeed, the theme of world
order, which he clarifies and expands upon, represents the bulk of his works.

More recently, world order themes are enclosed in the statements of the
Universal House of Justice and those of the Bahá‟í International Community
(BIC). The history of the statements provided by the BIC goes back to the
participation of the Bahá‟í community with international organisation
bodies: the Bahá‟í Faith is an active member of the United Nations in the
form of the Bahá‟í International Community that was registered as a Non-
Governmental Organisation in 1948. The involvement of the Bahá‟í
community with international organisations does not, however, start at this
particular point in time, but in 1926, when at the League of Nations
headquarters in Geneva an International Bureau was established to serve in
League activities. The BIC represents the Bahá‟í Worldwide Community,
and, as an NGO, is an association of democratically elected national
representative bodies called „National Spiritual Assemblies‟. Subsequently,
the Bahá‟í International Community gained consultative status with
ECOSOC, UNICEF, and UNIFEM, has working relations with the WHO,
and has worked closely with the UNEP, the UNHCR, UNESCO, and the
UNDP.82 Among the main goals and activities of the BIC we can find the
areas of grassroots participation in sustainable development; advancing the
status of women; the education of children; developing a consciousness of
world citizenship; the prevention of drug abuse; the elimination of racism;
and the promotion of human rights education.83 The BIC statements that deal
with the Bahá‟í view of world order reflect the teachings of the sacred

scriptures, and propose both a theoretical and practical foundations on
which to base the Bahá‟í ethos of international organisation.

A System of Planetary Organisation

The fundamental conviction in the organic oneness and unity of the
diversified elements of humanity is the basis of the belief-system found in
both the theoretical and practical aspects of the Bahá‟í Faith, and supports
its corollary teachings. The requirement of the delineation of a new socio-
political system to work along the lines of this assertion is not only a moral
corollary, but also a timely and adjusting necessity. For Bahá‟ís, this
explains that what they believe to be the new divinely sent message has
clear universal ramifications and a global intent.84 Bahá‟ís maintain that
Bahá‟u‟lláh‟s starting Revelation in the mid-nineteenth century (1863) and
His arrival in this point of history are consistent with a trend of unification
and globalisation of world structures that demand corresponding governing
bodies.85

Because the Bahá‟í Faith is of a religious nature, the intervention of God in
history is a given: following the belief in the organic unity of mankind, God
sends „Messengers‟ according to the needs of the times, and whilst the
„spiritual‟ message (such as the development of human virtues) does not
alter, the social content of each Messenger evolves consistent with the needs
and requirements of the time.86 According to this statement, we encounter
one of the main tenets of the Faith, namely the belief that there is only one
religion, which is revealed from age to age, and whose social content must
be adapted to the evolving and changing nature of society.87 This new vision
of religion is explained by Shoghi Effendi in The World Order of
Bahá‟u‟lláh, “religious truth is not absolute but relative … Divine
Revelation is progressive, not final”.88 Here we discern a belief in a
directional purpose in history: history is not left to itself or to haphazard
events, and although the idea of change is paramount („Abdu‟l‟Bahá for
example stated that, “creation is the expression of motion” or “that old ideas
and modes of thoughts were fast becoming obsolete”)89 the latter does not
necessarily follow smooth patterns. “Bahá‟ís anticipate that the coming of
age of humanity and the emergence of world order will be achieved in
evolutionary stages replete with strife and chaos”.90 The Bahá‟í model of

The Universal House of Justice writes, “Bahá‟u‟lláh‟s principal mission in appearing at this time in
history is the realisation of the oneness of mankind and the establishment of peace among the nations…” (The
Universal House of Justice, Letter: Unity of Nations and the Lesser Peace, 19th of April 2001, Internal
Document).

The first permanent organisations that cut across national boundaries, such as the International
Telegraphic Union and the Universal Postal Union, appeared subsequently in 1865 and 1874.

Bahá‟u‟lláh, in this regard, stated, “Be anxiously concerned with the needs of the age ye live in, and
centre your deliberations on its exigencies and requirements”. (Bahá‟u‟lláh, Gleanings, 213).

Bahá‟ís call this phenomenon „progressive revelation‟.

history, hence, simultaneously follows a cyclical and evolutionary content:
humanity is on an ever-progressive line composed of cyclical trends of rise
and fall leading to its ultimate global unity in all human spheres.91

According to the BIC, “Bahá‟u‟lláh asserts an opposing interpretation of the
historical process” with its evolution operating similar to the different stages
in the life of an individual, passing through the various stages of infancy,
childhood, adolescence, and maturity.92 The present stage of human
evolution is now amenable to the acceptance of the permanent principle of
the oneness of humanity, and its practical realisation in institutional terms,
which will ultimately lead to the unification of mankind. Indeed, the Bahá‟í
Faith identifies global unity as the essential goal of human history.93 Shoghi
Effendi explains that the Cause of Bahá‟u‟lláh, “…stands identified with,
and revolves around, the principle of the organic unity of mankind as
representing the consummation of the whole process of human evolution”.94
As Laszlo and the BIC explain, “…disunity (stands) as a prelude to, and not
as a contradiction of unity”:95 “The wars, exploitation, and prejudice that
have marked immature stages in the process should not be a cause of despair
but a stimulus to assuming the responsibilities of a collective maturity”.96
The tumultuous world condition is regarded as:

“A natural phase in the organic process leading ultimately and irresistibly to
the unification of the human race in a single social order whose boundaries
are those of the planet. The human race, as a distinct organic unit, has
passed through evolutionary stages analogous to the stages of infancy and
childhood in the lives of its individual members, and is now in the
culminating period of its turbulent adolescence approaching its long-awaited
coming of age.”97

Hence, for Bahá‟ís, the unification of the world does not constitute a utopian
goal to be striven for but not to be achieved, or a „matter of choice‟; rather,
it represents the next inescapable stage in the social evolution of mankind,

“Bahá‟ís see human life as evolutionary and perceive the rise and fall of civilizations as part of an
evolutionary progression from family and tribes to city-states and nations”. (Peter Khan, “Introduction”, p. xi)
This view of rise and fall leading upward also appears in Toynbee‟s view of history. Toynbee notes “The single,
finite movement from a disturbance to a restoration of equilibrium, is not enough if genesis is to be followed by
growth... there must be an élan which carries the challenged party through equilibrium into an overbalance which
exposes him to make a fresh challenge and thereby inspires him to make a fresh response in the form of a further
equilibrium ending in a further overbalance – and so in a progression which is potentially infinite”. (Arnold
Toynbee, A Study of History, (Vol. I), London: Oxford University Press, 1935, 128)

however unpersuasive contemporary world events appear to be.98 Alongside
the trend towards maturity lies the underlying concept that the system of
human organisation has evolved from family, tribe, city-state, and the
nation.99 The conflicts that plague humankind can be compared to the
various crises in adolescence that are necessary to assume the
responsibilities of adulthood. Refusing to accept the implications of a new
stage of planetary organisation can, thus, only lead to drawbacks and crises
that belong to a precedent stage of human evolution, namely that of a world
structure based on the nation-state. In this respect, Janet Khan observes:

> “Associated with this changing reality (increasing interdependence of
> a now global society) there is a growing recognition that present day
> values, worldviews, and administrative structures that were
> functional and adaptive in the age of self-sufficiency and unfettered
> national sovereignty, are proving inadequate to meet the challenges
> posed by the new stage of human history that is emerging.” 100

The Bahá‟í cosmopolitan ethos is also grounded in the belief that the
international community should intervene in the affairs of a state, namely in
the case of gross human rights violations. The Bahá‟í World Centre cites, for
example, the breakthrough made in international law following the
occurrence of WWII, and the trial of Nazi leaders for crimes committed
against humanity. This meant, according to Bahá‟í thought, that “the fetish
of national sovereignty had its limits”.101 This acknowledgement explains the
favour with which the Bahá‟í community welcomes the creation of the
ICC.102 Moreover, this can justify that the Bahá‟í community could approve
of, and lend its support to the idea of a global federation that endorses
macro-policing actions against governments that threaten to commit
genocide against their own peoples.103 Charles Lerche describes the Bahá‟í
model of human rights as a cosmopolitan model, as the human being stands
at the centre of IR, and not at its margins. The BIC, furthermore, observes
that, “since the body of humankind is one and indivisible, each member of
the human race is born into the world as a trust of the whole”.104

In this regard, as testified by the example of human rights, the nation-state
merely constitutes a transitional stage in the development of humanity, and
has to be transcended by a more encompassing political entity. The state

Shoghi Effendi explains the concept of a trend toward global unity as follows: “Unification of
mankind is the hall-mark of the stage which human society is now approaching. Unity of family, of tribe, of city-
state, and nation have been successively attempted and fully established. World unity is the goal towards which a
harassed humanity is striving. Nation building has come to an end”. (Ibid., p. 202)

The call raised by the international community to establish the ICC is clearly one that responds to
Bahá‟í expectations for the fulfilment of greater justice. (The Universal House of Justice, Letter: Unity of Nations
and the Lesser Peace.)

cannot be the highest authority in globalised conditions. Its destiny is
merely “to build the bridge from local autonomy to world unity”.105 In this
regard, Shoghi Effendi wrote that, “Nation-building has come to an end. The
anarchy inherent in state sovereignty is moving to a climax”.106 Furthermore,
emphasis in Bahá‟í thought is not placed solely on states or leadership, but
on peoples. The principle of collective trusteeship demands that the diverse
cultures of the peoples of the world, which are essential to their identity, be
protected under a system of national and international law.107 In 1947, the
BIC underlined this crucial point, “Both state and people are needed to serve
the strong pillar supporting the new institutions reflecting the full and final
expression of human relationships in an ordered society”.108

If Bahá‟ís believe that the unification of mankind is the next stage of its
evolution, they do not believe that it will be an easy undertaking, nor that it
will occur without hindrances. Although there is recognition of a trend
towards global unity, there is similar recognition that barriers „stand in the
way of its achievement.‟109 Such barriers include: the numerous prejudices
based on gender, class, race, nation, religion; „degree of material
civilization; the lack of educational opportunities and communication
among peoples‟;110 civil conflicts, global terrorism, and other destructive
processes that do not have any positive effects on the development of
society at all levels. The idea that simultaneous negative and positive forces
are at work constitutes an integral part of the Bahá‟í belief in a dual process
intended to bring about world unity. Indeed, the hindrances to global unity
are identified by Bahá‟ís as „disruptive forces‟, and those that have a
positive influence on global processes are identified as „integrative forces‟.
This dual phenomenon is part of a process that implicates the confusion now
prevailing in human affairs. Indeed, this process calls for visions of world
unity that Bahá‟ís believe are constructive in nature, and it also reposes on
opposing forces, which refuse to move beyond national sentiments.

Shoghi Effendi referred to “simultaneous processes of rise and fall, of
integration and disintegration, of order and chaos, with their continuous and
reciprocal reactions on each other”.111 The Universal House of Justice notes
that the disintegration process can be identified with the numerous religious,
political, racial or tribal conflicts taking place in several parts of the globe;
the sudden collapse of civil order that has paralysed several countries;

religious fundamentalism;112 the epidemic of terrorism as a political weapon;
and among other great disasters, the surge of criminal networks.113 Among
integrative forces we can find, for example, the call raised in favour of an
International Criminal Court; world conferences;114 the realisation that
nations are interconnected in the world of trade and finance (a condition that
Shoghi Effendi identified as necessary for the development of an organic
unified world); and related global aspects that call for a more efficient
system of global governance. These two forces, as described by Shoghi
Effendi, although clearly opposed in nature, will inevitably lead to the
“unity of the human race and the peace of mankind”. In the face of this              115

dual process, peace, Bahá‟ís believe, will emerge in stages, and will be
characterised by a growing consciousness of world citizenship.116

The great differentiation of the Bahá‟í Faith is also to be encountered in the
statement about the reality of human nature that Bahá‟u‟lláh claimed is
fundamentally spiritual. „Spiritual‟ in this sense does not literally mean
„religious‟, as we would usually think of the term, but is akin to the
formulation of a „global ethic‟, morality in human affairs, and „human
values‟ in the field of global politics. Schaefer identifies that without “a
world ethos, without a minimal consensus concerning durable values,
irrevocable standards and fundamental moral attitudes, it is impossible to
imagine a „new global order‟, as envisaged and so urgently enjoined upon
by Bahá‟u‟lláh in the nineteenth century”.117 The presence of ethics118 is
congruent with the idea of a divine polity being reflected in temporal affairs,
and more importantly, it denotes that the relation between the two spheres is
a practical one, and not a vague description of a world that is out of reach.
„Abdu‟l‟Bahá states, “The spiritual world is like unto the phenomenal
world. They are the exact counterparts of each other. Whatever objects
appear in the world of existence are the outer pictures of the world of
heaven”.119 „Abdu‟l‟Bahá mentions that heavenly attributes can be compared
to the solidarity of mankind or the perfection of justice.120 The characteristics
of this divine polity are, thus, the reflection of high requirements in the
governing of human and international affairs, which accounts for the

The Universal House of Justice contemplates that the surge of religious fanaticism testifies to the
break up of human values, which were brought by religions themselves. (See The Universal House of Justice, The
Promise of World Peace, 8).

reference of „spirituality‟ in the Bahá‟í writings. There is, for example, a
reflection of what is physical reality (the global interdependence of nations),
and what Bahá‟ís consider to be the spiritual reality of the oneness of
humankind (the brotherhood and sisterhood of all human beings).121

The BIC writes of the nature of the body of thought of Bahá‟u‟lláh: The
mainspring of Bahá‟u‟lláh‟s message is an exposition of reality as
fundamentally spiritual in nature, and of the laws that govern that reality‟s
operation. It not only sees the individual as a spiritual being, a “rational
soul”, but also insists that the entire enterprise that we call civilization is
itself a spiritual process, one in which the human mind and heart have
created progressively more complex and efficient means to express their
inherent moral and intellectual capacities.122

For Bahá‟ís, laying the foundations of a global society that reflects the
oneness of humanity is a „central spiritual issue‟ facing all the various
peoples of the world.123 In brief, the manner in which the foundations of a
system of global governance are established, depends, to a certain degree,
on infusing a moral sense in its socio-economic and political structures.

Bahá’u’lláh’s Exhortation to Political Peace: Framework of the Bahá’í
Vision of World Order

The cosmopolitan trait of the Bahá‟í Faith starts with the words of the
Báb,124 Who along with proclaiming the concept of progressive revelation,125
wrote that, “We have created you from a tree and have caused you to be as
the leaves and fruits of the same tree, that haply ye may become a source of
comfort to another…It behooveth you to be one indivisible people”.126 The
analogy of the „tree‟ representing humankind, and the diverse nations and
peoples being the „leaves and fruits‟ are later re-echoed in the writings of
Bahá‟u‟lláh: “Ye are the fruits of one tree, and the leaves of one branch.
Deal ye one another with the utmost love and harmony, with friendliness
and fellowship…”127 „Abdu‟l‟Bahá also used images found in nature to
elucidate the idea of the oneness of humankind, as it is depicted in the
Bahá‟í image. This is tantamount to stating that the world of nature does not
differ from the „reality‟ of the oneness of humankind in the human world.
Alluding to the great tree of the human family, „Abdu‟l‟Bahá states, “For
mankind may be likened to the branches, leaves, blossoms, and fruits of that

tree”. 128 He also explains that this image corresponds to the solidarity of the
human race.

W. Kenneth Christian notes that, “The chief principle of Bahá‟u‟lláh‟s
teachings is „the oneness and wholeness of the human race.‟ This is the
pivotal point of all that He taught… To achieve the unity of the human race
was Bahá‟u‟lláh‟s compelling life purpose”.129 Indeed, such a statement is
confirmed by „Abdu‟l‟Bahá (“The basis of the teaching of Bahá‟u‟lláh is the
unity of mankind)”130, Shoghi Effendi131 and by the statements of
Bahá‟u‟lláh himself. “Let your vision be world-embracing, rather than
confined to your own self… It is incumbent upon every man, in this Day, to
hold fast unto whatsoever will promote the interests, and exalt the station, of
all nations and just governments”.132 Bahá‟u‟lláh‟s message aims at the
creation of a universal society between nations, the abolition of war, and the
foundation of universal peace.133 “Love for humanity is a central value in the
hierarchy of values. All actions should be directed towards the well-being of
humankind, its welfare having absolute priority over all particular
interests”.134 Likewise, Janet A. Khan notes that Bahá‟u‟lláh‟s teachings are
intended to encourage „global unity and world order‟.135

In line with the conception of a world vision, Bahá‟u‟lláh speaks of „just‟
governments, a concept which was elucidated in the various letters that He
sent to the major monarchs,136 rulers, and religious leaders between 1867
and 1873. These statements represent His advice to the temporal and
religious leaderships. In the Súriy-I Mulúk (Tablets to the Kings), He
addresses all of the monarchs, as He calls on them to abide by the principles
of justice and unity, to disarm, to move away from tyranny and oppression,
to care for the poor and downtrodden, and describes the accumulation of
riches from the peoples by sovereigns as „grievous injustice‟. „Peoples‟ are
to be a crucial concern of the leadership. Bahá‟u‟lláh states in the Súriy-i-
Mulúk: “Do not lay burden on your subjects…The poor are the trust of God
in your midst, safeguard the rights of the downtrodden”.137

The Universal House of Justice says of the Súriy-i-Mulúk:

Although there is a high station in the Bahá‟í writings regarding „kingship‟, the latter is endorsed if
fulfilling several conditions, including the rejection of absolute monarchy, and the endorsement of a republican
form of government. (See Ulrich Gollmer, “Bahá‟í Political Thought”, in Udo Schaefer, (ed.), Making the
Crooked Straight: A Contribution to Bahá’í Apologetics, (trans, Geraldine Schukelt) (Oxford: George Ronald,
2000), 449-450).

> half decades: the obligation of …civil authority to institute the reign

> resolution of conflicts among nations, and an end to the excessive
> expenditures that were impoverishing these rulers‟ subjects.”138

The idea of morality in human affairs is underlined, as well as the notion
that temporal government must reflect divine virtues (such as showing
justice, and discarding oppression and tyranny) in the management of their
affairs and the treatment of the peoples.139 In the address to Queen Victoria,
Bahá‟u‟lláh praises the Queen for abandoning the practice of slavery on
both men and women, and also for abiding by the formulation of a
democratic tenet in her government – a point that „Abdu‟l‟Bahá was to
emphasise in His treatise The Secret of Divine Civilization in 1875.140
Bahá‟u‟lláh further expounds the principles that constitute the first stage of
world peace for Bahá‟ís, the Lesser Peace, a political peace among the
nations of the world with a reference to the principle of collective security
that He was among the first to expound and elaborate on.141 He writes, “Be
united, O kings of the earth… Should any one among you take up arms
against another, rise ye all against him, for this is naught but manifest
justice”.142 Bahá‟u‟lláh also enjoins leaders to „take counsel together‟ in a
convened international gathering, to show concern for the whole of
mankind, and to reflect upon the design of a world political community. He
also calls for the reduction of armaments to the extent that they will only be
required for internal or self-defence purposes.143 Bahá‟u‟lláh stated, “O
Rulers of the earth! Be reconciled among yourselves, that ye may need no
more armaments save in a measure to safeguard your territories and
dominions”.144

Referring to the contents of these Tablets, Shoghi Effendi explains, “the
application of the highest principles in human and international relations are
forcibly and insistently made, and the abandonment of discreditable
practices and conventions, detrimental to the happiness, the growth, the

sovereign states should be dependent on the will and choice of the people. („Abdu‟l‟Bahá, The Secret of Divine

Bahá‟u‟lláh was also among the first to evoke the phrase „New World Order‟: “…the prevailing
Order appeareth to be lamentably defective… Soon will the present-day order be rolled up and a new one spread
out in its stead”. (Bahá‟u‟lláh, Gleanings, 7 & 216).

prosperity and the unity of the human race, enjoined”.145 The system of
collective security propounded by Bahá‟u‟lláh asserts that political
agreements alone are not sufficient to support it.146 It must stand on a
stronger moral consciousness of human values, and in particular, must be
grounded in the oneness of mankind. Bahá‟u‟lláh‟s counsels to the leaders
of His time, which represent the kernel of His exhortation to the Lesser
Peace, are at the heart of Bahá‟í views on global governance, and constitute
the basis of further elaborations provided by His successors and by the
BIC.147

The Century of Light

The vision of a system of international interdependence, and the need for
interlocking governance underlined by the oneness of humankind have also
been expounded by „Abdu‟l‟Bahá, Who advocated that a sine qua non
condition for universal peace was universal suffrage, and Who elucidated
the writings of Bahá‟u‟lláh.148 Of religious, racial, patriotic, or political
prejudices, He said that they were the destroyer of the body politic inasmuch
as all people have a single and common origin.149 More interestingly,
„Abdu‟l‟Bahá called the twentieth century „the century of light‟, and records
of His statements that international peace would indeed occur in this century
were reported in various papers of the early twentieth century.150 This
pronouncement has been sometimes mistaken as being congruent with Him
stating that the Lesser Peace in the twentieth century would be a reality.
Nonetheless, when „Abdu‟l‟Bahá called the twentieth century „the century
of light‟, or when he referred to the twentieth century as the century of
international peace, He alluded to a process of peace that started in the
twentieth century, and not to events that took place during that time.

It is fascinating to see that He denoted the potentialities of the twentieth
century as containing the embryo and the impetus for the creation of
international peace, and the creation of corresponding pending global
institutions and outlook. The BIC notes, “The attainment of peace in the
political realm is discernible through the workings of a process that can be
seen as having been definitely established in the twentieth century amid the
terror and turmoil that have characterised so much of this period”. 151 The
twentieth century had unleashed the capacity for international peace and a

Bahá‟u‟lláh, in: Ibid,. 72.

“…the abolition of war is not simply a matter of signing treaties and protocols; it is a complex task
requiring a new level of commitment to resolving issues not customarily associated with the pursuit of peace.
Based on political agreements alone, the idea of collective security if a chimera”. (The Universal House of Justice,
The Promise of World Peace, 14).

This vision of a system of collective security shall be later expounded when looking at the writings
of Shoghi Effendi, the Universal House of Justice, and the Bahá‟í International Community.

global era. In „Abdu‟l‟Bahá‟s words, “Inasmuch as this is the century of
light, capacity for achieving international peace has been assured”.152 The
Bahá‟í World Centre explains that this image refers to the growing
“acceptance of the principle of oneness and its implications” and that “the
physical unification in our time and the awakening aspirations of the mass
of its inhabitants have at last produced the conditions that permit
achievement of the ideal, although in a manner far different from that
imagined by imperial dreamers of the past”. [Emphasis added]153 It is
relevant to see that the twentieth century has witnessed a breakthrough in
international thinking, as it has witnessed the birth of „representative global
institutions, including the United Nations and its subsidiary bodies.‟154
„Abdu‟l‟Bahá declared that the „unity of nations‟ would happen in the
twentieth century, meaning that the peoples of the world would have
developed a certain consciousness of world solidarity, essential to the
establishment of a political union.155 The Universal House of Justice clarifies
that “the unity of nations can be taken as that unity which arises from a
recognition among the peoples of the various nations, that they are members
of one single family”.156 One of the core teachings of „Abdu‟l‟Bahá is that
the oneness of humankind stands as the primary principle regulating human
life and reality; the main difference is that its realisation is now at hand due
to the progress in technology, transport, and communication. As
„Abdu‟l‟Bahá states:

“In this day, means of communication have multiplied, and the five
continents of the world have merged into one… In like manners all the
members of the human family, whether peoples or governments, cities or
villages, have become increasingly interdependent… Hence the unity of all
mankind can in this day be achieved.”157

„Abdu‟l‟Bahá further reflected the writings of His father as He called for
altruistic concerns and the welfare of humanity as a whole, rather than
particularistic ones.158 He also clearly defined cosmopolitanism, as it is
enshrined in Bahá‟í thinking, stating that some wars are “caused by purely
imaginary racial differences; for humanity is one kind, one race and progeny
habiting the same globe...These boundaries and distinctions are human and
artificial, not natural and original”. Furthermore, He asserts, “This earth is
one home and native land. God has created mankind with equal endowment
and right to live upon the earth. As a city is the home of all its inhabitants
although each may have his individual place of residence therein, so the

earth‟s surface is one wide native land or home” for everyone.159 There is an
argument in „Abdu‟l‟Bahá‟s writings for the grounding of a spiritual,
physical, and intellectual cosmopolitanism. There is the allusion that all
human beings were created by one „Great Being‟, as part of a spiritual bond
between human beings, a spiritual cosmopolitanism: “racial assumptions
and distinctions are nothing but superstition…All mankind are the children
of one Father”;160 the intellectual explanation that there is no biological
difference between human beings and that we are all part of the same human
species, “we are one physical race, even as we are of one physical plan of
material body‟,161 and the intellectual grounding that physical borders are
simply artificially created boundaries, and not a natural state of affairs,
“Racial prejudice or separation into nations… is unnatural and proceeds
from human motive and ...ignorance”.162 „Abdu‟l‟Bahá also mentioned the
organic evolution of humanity that is enshrined in all the fields of human
science, including politics. He states, “The world of politics is like the world
of man; he is seed at first, and then passes by the degrees of the condition of
embryo and foetus… the political world in the same way cannot
instantaneously evolve from the nadir of defectiveness to the zenith of
perfection”.163 Accordingly, the idea that the political realm must pass
through different degrees before it can be functional is here alluded to;
likewise, an appropriate system of global governance will gradually evolve
to become increasingly efficient.

Human Nature and Peaceful World Order: An Alternative Image

According to „Abdu‟l‟Bahá, the aim of the creation of men and women,
who have been given the endowment of the intellect and understanding, is
not targeted at destruction, but rather constitutes a means by which a
peaceful society can emerge.164 He stated, “I hope that you will use your
understanding to promote the unity and tranquillity of mankind…”165 Bahá‟í
belief dwells on the fact that “men have been created to carry forward an
ever-advancing civilization”.166 The purpose in creating humankind is, thus,
the achievement of its full potential to do good, and to promote the
evolution of society.167 In this statement, we come across the premise of the
Bahá‟í idea of human nature, which is not imprisoned in the narrow
confines of being inherently either „good or evil‟, but constitutes an image
that asks for endeavour and accounts for the free will of human beings. For
Bahá‟u‟lláh, each individual represents a „supreme talisman‟ and a „mine

rich in gems of inestimable value.‟ This potential must be developed through
proper education, with which each person can optimise the ability to
practice „free will‟.168 Individuals are not left to themselves with a fixed
nature.

„Abdu‟l‟Bahá calls these two sides of human nature the „lower‟ and „higher‟
natures.169 This image of human nature can also be captured in the writings
of Bahá‟u‟lláh, “Noble have I (God) created Thee, yet thou hast abased
thyself. Rise then unto that for which thou was created”.170 Human beings
have to „endeavour‟ to let their „higher nature‟ dominate: human nature is,
thus, a matter of choice. By acting on their lower nature, human beings
allow disasters in civilisation, which occur on the grounds that the purpose
of creation is not being fulfilled, or that the nobility intended for creation is
being ignored. Human reality is that of the „higher nature‟. The Bahá‟í
concept of human nature portrays, thus, a positive, rather than a negative,
image. The complexity of human nature is explained by „Abdu‟l‟Bahá:171
“Man is the highest degree of materiality, and at the beginning of spirituality
– that is to say, he is the end of imperfection and the beginning of
perfection… Not in any of the species in the world of existence is there such
a difference, contrast, contradiction, and opposition as in the species of
man”.172 In parallel, it is important to make the paramount point that in the
Bahá‟í image, lower nature is not real, as it is not part of human reality. Evil
is the absence of good, as darkness is the absence of light, and in this way, it
is crucial to state that the „lower nature‟ constitutes an absence of the „higher
nature‟.173 The creation of humankind is reminiscent of a higher nature,
leaving no doubt as to the nobility of creation. Gollmer explains:

“The Bahá‟í Faith does not have a dualistic image of the world with
distinction between believers and infidels,174 good or evil, saved or unsaved.
Its principle is that of unity: metaphysically as the unity of God, the Creator
of all human beings and his universal mercy; practically as an ethical
standard in all dealings with the people and nations of the world and as a
responsibility for the preservation of creation.”175

Since the capacity for a higher nature does exist, and the attainment of this
higher nature is the aim of creation, Loni Bramson-Lerche remarks, “With

regard to the capacity for aggression, the Bahá‟í teachings differ sharply
from the opinions of the „realist‟ school of political science”.176 Hence, this
certainly explains why the Bahá‟í literature on the subject is often defined as
„utopian‟, when in fact it claims that human beings were created for a nobler
purpose than that of unceasing conflict. Danesh Hossein describes the
Bahá‟í model of world order as one that asserts the “fundamental nobility of
every human being and the ultimate victory of the human spirit”.177 The
possibility of achieving a peaceful society is also justified by the fact that
the individual is a „social being‟ in need of „cooperation and association‟.178
It is noteworthy that the capacities for building a peaceful society are greater
in our age than they were in previous ages, leading us back to
„Abdu‟l‟Bahá‟s reference to the twentieth century as „the century of
light”.179 Indeed, Bahá‟u‟lláh notes that our age is the day “… in which all
that lay latent in man hath been and will be made manifest”. 180

The Universal House of Justice maintains that a „paralysis of will‟ and „a
paralysing contradiction‟ have prevailed in human affairs due to the inherent
belief in the aggressiveness of human beings. Accordingly, the Universal
House of Justice asserts that this has generated self-imposed obstacles to the
creation of a just and peaceful social system. The international Bahá‟í body
recognises, on the one hand, the longing of people for peace and the
„apprehensions tormenting their daily lives‟, and on the other hand, it
challenges the conflicting statement that human beings are inherently selfish
and aggressive and incapable of achieving a peaceful and dynamic social
order.181 The need to reassess mankind‟s true nature is, thus, crucial when
thinking of the possibilities that exist within the international community to
achieve a more peaceful order. The Promise of World Peace states:

“As the need for peace becomes more urgent, this fundamental contradiction
which hinders its realization, demands a reassessment of the assumptions
upon which the commonly held view of mankind‟s historical predicament is
based. Dispassionately examined, the evidence reveals that such conduct,
far from expressing man‟s true self, represents a distortion of the human
spirit. Satisfaction on this point will enable people to set in motion
constructive social forces which, because they are consistent with human
nature, will encourage harmony and cooperation instead of war and
aggression.”182

This statement can be linked to the Bahá‟í belief that humankind passes
through different stages leading to world unity, one of which is an immature
stage replete with war, strife, and exploitation.183 The paralysis of will
„rooted in a deep-seated conviction in the quarrelsome of mankind‟ has
hindered world leaders to move beyond the notion of national sovereignty,
and meet the challenge of establishing an appropriate world institutions and
world mechanisms for the achievement of peace.184 Henceforth, in the
Bahá‟í model, all efforts that aim at relieving some of the world‟s problems
cannot be solely pragmatic; they have to be raised to the level of principle.
In this regard, the Universal House of Justice states, “the primary challenge
in dealing with issues of peace is to raise the context to the level of
principle, as distinct from pure pragmatism. For, in essence, peace stems
from an inner state supported by a spiritual or moral attitude, it is chiefly in
evoking this attitude that the possibility of peace can be found…”185 This
inner attitude grounded in the view that human beings are and were created
to be noble, stand at the basis of the Bahá‟í image of human nature, and the
centrality of the individual and human relationships in a multilayered
governance scheme. It, furthermore, disposes of the idea that world order
schemes can be founded on political concerns only, without any reference to
evoking the moral attitude that lies at the basis of the true reality of man.

The Oneness of Humankind and Institutional Cosmopolitanism

Shoghi Effendi wrote that, “…the principle of the Oneness of Mankind, the
cornerstone of Bahá‟u‟lláh‟s…dominion implies nothing more nor less than
the enforcement of His scheme for world unification”.186 The oneness of
humankind, which entails its unity, has its corollary in the socio-economic
and political spheres: it propounds that unity is the principle regulating all
spheres of human life, including the socio-political realm. As such, the
principle is not fated to remain only on ideological and emotional levels,
with no institutional and practical implications. If it were the case, the
principle would remain on the level of theoretical good wishing. 187 Shoghi
Effendi further explained that unless the efforts of world leaders were
directed towards giving thought to this system of global governance that
was now based on global, rather than national structures, they were bound to
encounter setbacks. Shoghi Effendi states:

> “The oneness of mankind…is applicable not only to the individual,
> but concerns itself primarily with the nature of those essential
> relationships that must bind all the states and nations as members of

Political Writings, 44.

„Abdu‟l‟Bahá stated, “What profit is there in agreeing that universal friendship is good, and talking
of the solidarity of the human race as an ideal?” „Abdu‟l‟Bahá further explained that unless these principles were
transformed into the world of action, they would be of no use. („Abdu‟l‟Bahá, Paris Talks, 3).

> shibboleths of national creeds – creeds that have had their day…It
> calls for no less than the reconstruction and the demilitarisation of
> the whole civilised world…” [Emphasis added]188

Although it implies the need for unity, the oneness of humankind does not
suggest that uniformity is a relevant consideration in its application. On the
contrary, the machinery that can best incarnate this principle must be made
to reflect the diversity inherent in the human family, and in all the aspects of
human life. The Bahá‟í Faith is a firm believer in the oneness of humanity, if
only sustained by a strong corollary of the preservation and flourishing of
diversity. Not only the diversity found in the different shapes and colours of
the human family, but also the diversity of thought and opinion. In this
instance, „Abdu‟l‟Bahá noted, “All are seeking truth, and there are many
roads leading thereto…Do not allow difference of opinion, or diversity of
thought to separate you from your fellow men”.189 The principle of „unity of
diversity‟, which stands at the basis of the Bahá‟í Faith as an inherent
element of the oneness of humankind, does not simply constitute a
theoretical and ethical aspect; it constitutes, for Bahá‟ís, a gift of beauty to
mankind, which has been misused for hatred and conflict.190

Indeed, the oneness of humankind and unity in diversity, which stand at the
very heart of the principles that have shaped the whole process of life are,
thus, not just to be applied to the individual, but to the governance system,
and have to be the guiding thrust behind the machinery that can best serve
the interests of humankind in its structural aspects. It is significant that, in
this instance, the Bahá‟í Faith upholds the principle of federalism, or that of
the commonwealth,191 when considering a new system of global
governance.192 The BIC, therefore, underlines, “…one of the time-tested
models of governance that may accommodate the world‟s diversity within a
unified framework is the federal system”. The BIC further observes,
“Federalism has proved effective in decentralizing authority and decision-
making in large, complex, and heterogeneous states, while maintaining a

See „Abdu‟l‟Bahá, Bahá’í World Faith, 295.

The commonwealth model takes a more confederal form than the federal model. The federal model
has a rule of law, which operates from the federal centre, whereas the commonwealth model can issue sanctions
when, for example, human rights are not respected. The commonwealth/confederation model has no legal force
over member-states.

Tellingly many grass-roots socio-economic development programmes have proved very efficacious
without the need for a central authority to control them, which demonstrates that a governance model certainly
does not have to resemble a Hobbesian style government. (Foad Katirai, Global Governance, 13).

degree of overall unity and stability.193 Another model worth examining is
the commonwealth, which at the global level would place the interest of the
whole ahead of the interest of any individual nation”.194 [Emphasis added].

Moreover, these systems of governance were promoted by „Abdu‟l‟Bahá,
who emphasised in 1912 that centralisation was most likely to encourage
despotism and that it was, thus, urgent to find ways to discourage its
practice as a system of governance.195 Here, „Abdu‟l‟Bahá‟s
recommendation was further elaborated by Shoghi Effendi. Explicitly, when
providing one of the possible examples of „some form of political unity‟, as
enshrined in the Bahá‟í writings, Shoghi Effendi mentioned a „World
Federal State‟, whilst he acknowledged that its realisation was most likely to
be tortuous and induced by sufferings.196 He, furthermore, explained that „the
establishment of a world commonwealth, a world federal system liberated
from… war… in which Force is made the servant of Justice‟ was the
consequential institutional form of the unity of mankind.197

Shoghi Effendi, as early as 1954, described the world as a global
neighbourhood („needs of a world already contracted into a neighbourhood‟)
when advocating the option of a world federal government to counteract
„anachronistic conceptions‟ or the „obsolescent doctrine of absolute
sovereignty‟.198 Indeed, world federalist thinking advocated world federal
government, especially in the inter-war years and after WWII, to do away
with the outdatedness, and the ill foundation of state sovereignty.199 In
Bahá‟í thought, this world federal government devoid of „anachronistic
conceptions‟ would be a major step towards the establishment of the Lesser
Peace and the unification of mankind.200 The main organs of the world
federal government would comprise a world parliament or legislature that is
able to create a code of enforceable international law previously universally
agreed upon; a world executive, backed by an international force, which
would „carry out the decisions arrived at and apply the laws enacted by the
world parliament‟; and a world tribunal, whose decisions and judgment
would be binding on the parties and applicable to all disputes arising in the
universal system. Alongside these main organs of the world federal

Here the use of the term „overall‟ is interesting. Many federal states encounter internal separatist
movements. (See Michael Ignatieff, Blood and Belonging: Journeys into the New Nationalism, Canada: Penguin,
1993, 172-3).

Bahá‟í International Community, Turning Point For All Nations, p. 7.

“…to cast aside centralisation which promotes despotism is the exigency of the time”.

(„Abdu‟l‟Bahá, The Promulgation of Universal Peace, 167.) It is here helpful to state that global federalism has
been influenced by the transformation of the United States at the end of the eighteenth century from a confederal
to a federal model. The latter initiated the idea of the individual as a subject of world law.

Advocates of a world federal government included: Auguste Forel, Auguste Schvan, and Paul Otlet
(during the First World War), Bertrand Russell and Oscar Newfang, Rosika Schwimmer, Maverick Lloyd (in the
inter war years). During the Second World War, federal advocates consisted of Ransome, Beveridge, Zilliacus,
Culberston and Adler. (Derek Heater, World Citizenship and Government, p. 110-112).

Shoghi Effendi, Citadel of Faith, p. 126.

government, a number of umbrella organisations, including „a complex
transnational network of individuals, private organisations and international
agencies‟ functioning with autonomy.201 (Significantly, the BIC defines the
global governance system as a sum of intricate relationships between
individuals and groups who determine how they manage common
international concerns, underlining the importance of the input of the global
citizenry).202 This institutional form provides the possible format that can
embody the words of Bahá‟u‟lláh, frequently cited as the „motto‟ of the
Bahá‟í Faith, „The earth is but one country, and mankind its citizens.‟203

Significantly, Shoghi Effendi was not proscriptive when he advocated
federalism or the commonwealth as two possible models of world
governance, but it is relevant that the BIC reiterated, as soon as 1995, that
federalism was a useful structure for some form of global government. In
this regard, according to Bahá‟í thought, while bearing in mind that
federalism is considered the most favourable form for the management of
diversity and decentralisation in a global governance system, it is
reminiscent that this vision of a world federal government, although a clear
destiny in the Bahá‟í vision of a future global order, does represent a long-
term and drastic project as things now stand.204 The Bahá‟í model calls for
incremental steps to be taken in order to reform international institutions,
and move towards a new system of global governance. Accordingly, it
contains a transformationist paradigm:205 the nation-state is in a period of
change, and will eventually cede some of its influence to world political
arrangements. Changes in the political arena will not happen unexpectedly
and incoherently, but as a result of expediency and urgency following both
the will of peoples and world leaders. The new generation of world
federalists has adopted a step-by-step approach, rather than the maximalist
approach of the realisation of a world federal government: for example, they
advocate UN democratisation through an assembly of world citizens, or
have worked for the establishment of the International Criminal Court.

The Lesser Peace, or Bahá’í Programme for a Political Unity of Nations

Bahá‟ís believe that peace will come in stages, the first of which concerns a
political peace among nations: the „Lesser Peace‟. The Lesser Peace relates
to what „Abdu‟l‟Bahá named „unity in the political realm‟, and is explained
by Shoghi Effendi as a „unity which politically independent and sovereign
states achieve among themselves.206 The second stage, the „Most Great
Peace‟, refers to the social, spiritual, and political unification of mankind, a

peace in which spirit and humanity would be infused into the political
peace. Daniel Wheatley notes:

“The Bahá‟í writings show our self-perception and identity as being one of
the major areas of difference between the Lesser Peace and the Most Great
Peace. It is only in the Most Great Peace when a man shall travel to any city
on earth, and it will be as if entering his own home. The Lesser Peace will
see the end of war between nations…but it will not necessarily be
accompanied by feelings of universal humanity…”207
The political peace, the most immediate peace,208 has been mentioned by
Bahá‟u‟lláh when He wrote to the rulers, kings, and religious leaders of His
age, and was further expounded by „Abdu‟l‟Bahá and Shoghi Effendi. The
formulation of a world government based on a federal system of governance
and decentralisation is crucial to the Bahá‟í model of governance, as it seeks
to maintain decision-making at appropriate levels, and functions according
to the principle of subsidiarity. The latter represents an element of the
„Lesser Peace‟, the term Bahá‟u‟lláh used when elaborating on the concept
of collective security.209 Wheatley details:

“As well as calling for disarmament,210 Bahá‟u‟lláh, „Abdu‟l‟Bahá and
Shoghi Effendi laid down guiding principles for a global legislature,
international weights and measures, a supreme tribunal, a global
peacekeeping force…Shoghi Effendi expands upon the practical necessities
of the Lesser Peace. This includes the creation of a global executive, a
global legislature, an international armed force in crisis management, a
world taxation system, a global currency, global communications
networks211 and a supreme international tribunal…„Abdu‟l‟Bahá also speaks
of the organisation necessary … in terms of a „Parliament of Man‟ and a
„Supreme Tribunal‟.”212

The Supreme Tribunal was also defined by „Abdu‟l‟Bahá as a „Highest
Court of Appeal‟, an „International Tribunal‟, the „Great Council‟, or an
„International World Conference‟.213 This tribunal, which would have
abiding jurisdiction in international affairs only, would need to be set up so
as to prevent war, and would be composed of representatives from each

Nalinie Mooten, Interview with Daniel Wheatley, Conducted Via Email, 10 February 2003.

The Most Great Peace refers to a very distant future, as it is part of an eschatological promise.

The occurrence of a World Federal Government is, according to the BIC, „the inevitable destiny of
humankind‟, but it does, however, „represents a long-term picture of a global society”. (Bahá‟í International
Community, Turning Point For All Nations, 6).

„Abdu‟l‟Bahá held the view that it was essential that disarmament, which was so crucial to the
development of international peace, happened simultaneously, as partial disarmament would only cause other
nations to be suspicious and increase their armaments as a result. (In: The Universal House of Justice, Peace, 20).

Shoghi Effendi wrote in 1936, “A mechanism of world inter-communication will be devised,
embracing the whole planet, freed from national hindrances and restrictions, and functioning with marvellous
swiftness and perfect regularity”. (Shoghi Effendi, The World Order of Bahá’u’lláh, 203).

This vision is alluded to in the statements of the Bahá‟í International Community, namely in
Turning Point For All Nations. See also J. Tyson, World Peace and World Government: A Bahá'í Approach.
Oxford: George Ronald, 1986, 57 & Daniel Wheatley, Global Governance: Has a Paradigm Shift, 229.

nation of the world, whose election would be based on using some form of
population criteria. This election would need to be confirmed by the cabinet,
the upper house, and the president of the nation, and should have at its basis
the sanction of the peoples of the world. „Abdu‟l‟Bahá made the following
suggestion as to a future world court in the late nineteenth century:

“A Supreme Tribunal shall be established by the peoples and governments
of every nation, composed of members elected from each country and
government. The members of this Great Council shall assemble in unity. All
disputes of an international character should be submitted to this Court, its
work being to arrange by arbitration everything which otherwise would be a
cause of war. The mission of this Tribunal would be to prevent war.”214

This vision of a world judicial system is part of Shoghi Effendi‟s elaboration
of the Bahá‟í vision of a future world order. Shoghi Effendi explains that the
statement of Bahá‟u‟lláh regarding His elaboration of collective security are
none other than the demand for „the curtailment of unfettered national
sovereignty‟ and that of a system of a world commonwealth of the nations
of the world or the formulation of a system of world government, whose
main organs have been above mentioned.215 Shoghi Effendi details his
thoughts, reminiscent of the call for a „World Federal State‟:

“Some form of a world super-state must needs be evolved, in whose favour
all the nations of the world will have willingly ceded every claim to make
war, certain rights to impose taxation and all rights to maintain armaments,
except for purposes of maintaining internal order within their respective
dominions. Such a state will have to include within its orbit an international
executive adequate to enforce supreme and unchallengeable authority on
every recalcitrant member of the commonwealth; a world parliament whose
members shall be elected by the people in their respective countries and
whose election shall be confirmed by their respective governments; and a
supreme tribunal whose judgement will have a binding effect even in such
cases where the parties concerned did not voluntarily agree to submit their
case to its consideration. A world community…in which the fury of a
capricious and militant nationalism will have been transmuted into an
abiding consciousness of world citizenship – such indeed, appears, in its
broadest outline, the Order anticipated by Bahá‟u‟lláh…”216

It is to bear in mind, however, and as briefly mentioned, that this picture of
world order represents in the words of the BIC, and of the Bahá‟í World
Centre, „a long-term picture of a global society‟ and a „radical

„Abdu‟l‟Bahá, Paris Talks, 161.

“We see you adding every year unto your expenditures and laying the burden thereof on the people
whom ye rule; this verily is naught but grievous injustice.... Be reconciled among yourselves, that ye may need

take up arms against another, rise ye all against him, for this is naught but manifest justice”. (Bahá‟u‟lláh, in:

restructuring of the administration of the affairs of the planet‟. [Emphasis
added]217 In IR, the use of the very term „world government‟ can seem far-
fetched, outdated, and out of touch with a plural global governance system
advocated in the new conditions of world (dis)order. To some, a „world
government‟ already exists in the form of unilateralism in international
politics and/or the deficit of global democratic input in financial institutions
such as the International Monetary Fund (IMF). To others, „world
government‟ implies the prevalence of political security issues over socio-
economic ones. It is essential to stress that the Bahá‟í approach differs from
those conceptions of world government. Indeed, we can anticipate why the
Bahá‟í model, which is holistic and based on grassroots values, calls for the
principle of „subsidiarity‟ and „decentralisation‟ in international affairs.
Indeed, with centralisation, or the process by which decisions are taken
away from those affected by them, people lose their ability to shape their
own destiny, and are deprived of the dignity to choose for themselves.

We can discern that the problem with the phrase „world government‟ can be
one of terminology (i.e. the world government that Bahá‟ís believe in does
not take the form and rigidity of the world government that is being
currently criticised in IR). Indeed, the „world government‟ referred to by the
Bahá‟í writings is not a centralised, undemocratic, and ineffective
governance machine. Rather, it is a pyramidal structure, which respects
lower levels of governance. In parallel, the BIC promotes the view that in
development paradigms, the maxims „small is beautiful‟ and „think globally,
act locally‟ are adequate to tackle economic issues218 as people feel that they
can control their destiny. Here sovereignty, meaning the respect for lower
levels of governance, is necessary. As late Professor Claude Ake observes
“sovereignty has done little to prevent the majority of countries in the global
south being subject to policies imposed on them by global financial
institutions.”219 [Emphasis added] Indeed, cosmopolitanism does not
necessarily equate to the idea of „bigness‟ and inefficiency. As Indian writer
Arundhati Roy states, “The further and further away geographically
decisions are taken, the more scope you have for incredible injustice.”220

Geoffrey Robertson, in view of the growing importance of global
corporations as global actors, contends that it is imperative that international
legal mechanisms be created for states and multinationals „to provide
resources, which are available to them … for basic rights of health,
education and social security.‟221 More significantly, he maintains that
„human rights auditing‟, i.e. the process by which ethical reports are

produced on behalf of multinationals, should become human rights
principles, and not merely „a public relations exercise‟.222 Shoghi Effendi,
who referred to a world parliament as a global law making body, conceived
it in cosmopolitan terms, insofar as it would intend to „satisfy the needs‟ of
all peoples.223 The second and third generation of human rights define these
socio-economic needs as rights. In relation to the latter, David Held also
alludes to the idea of a global parliament which would monitor the
accountability of global corporations to deal with their social failures. The
ICC, which does not as yet include corporate responsibility, has, however,
started meaningful and innovative work in implementing human rights on
non-state actors, i.e. on human beings.

There is no doubt, for Bahá‟ís, that the elaboration of a system of world
government is a radical undertaking as things now stand. More importantly,
this system of world government would not come into being without the
approbation of the members of the human race, who would have developed
a strong sense of world citizenship that would have replaced „a militant
nationalism‟. In highlighting these aspects, Shoghi Effendi, in 1931, made it
absolutely clear that the intentions latent in the words of Bahá‟u‟lláh do not
aspire to replace the existing local or national structures by international
ones, nor to substitute our existing loyalties for other ones, but rather seek to
supplement humanity with the international structures and loyalties that are
necessary to the flourishing and development of society. Similar to the
federalist tradition, the Bahá‟í ethos does not intend to replace lower levels
of governance and lesser loyalties, but rather seek to complement them with
the requirements of an interdependent world. It does not call for a vague
attachment to the world as a whole, but for evolving and multiple loyalties
from the grassroots to the whole. Shoghi Effendi notes:

“Far from aiming at the subversion of the existing foundations of society, it
(the meaning of Bahá‟u‟lláh‟s intent) seeks to broaden its basis…with the
needs of an ever-changing world. It can conflict with no legitimate
allegiances, nor can it undermine essential loyalties. Its purpose is neither to
stifle the flame of a sane and intelligent patriotism in men‟s hearts, so
essential if the evils of excessive centralization are to be avoided… It calls
for a wider loyalty, for a larger aspiration that has animated the human race.
It insists upon the subordination of national impulses and interests to the
imperative claims of a unified world. It repudiates excessive centralisation
on the one hand, and disclaims all attempts at uniformity on the other. Its
watchword is unity in diversity.”224

The Bahá‟í call is based on the belief that it is absolutely necessary to
abandon theories that seek to „deify the state‟, that are only materialistic in

> 222 Ibid.
> 223 Shoghi Effendi, The World Order of Bahá’u’lláh, 203.

224 Ibid., 41.

their aspects,225 that promote the interests of certain members of the human
race to the disadvantage of others, and that do not attempt to adjust
themselves to the needs of an increasingly cosmopolitan age. Accordingly,
the Universal House of Justice writes:

“…all too many…ideologies, alas, instead of embracing the concept of the
oneness of mankind, and promoting the increase of concord among different
peoples, have tended to deify the state, to subordinate the rest of mankind
to one nation, race or class, to attempt to suppress all discussion and
interchange of ideas, or to callously abandon starving millions to the
operations of a market system that all too clearly is aggravating the plight of
the majority of mankind, while enabling small sections to live in a condition
of affluence scarcely dreamed of by our forebears.” [Emphasis added]226

There is no denial that one of the most firm calls launched by the Bahá‟í
community is the abandonment of theories and ideas that are standing in the
way of the realisation of humankind as one body, that are viewing all of
humankind as an interdependent family, and that are still insisting upon
nationalistic and divisive claims. It is suggested that we abandon parochial
notions, such as racism, which in its extreme can lead to genocide, or
nationalism, that has persisted and demonstrated its pernicious effects on the
body of humankind. If racism or nationalism cannot generate the prosperity
of humankind, it is here suggested that we now start shaping our
institutions, our efforts, and our world-view on a more encompassing and
humane dimension. Shoghi Effendi embodied this all-important statement in
his writings:

“The call of Bahá‟u‟lláh is primarily directed against all forms of
provincialism, all insularities and prejudices. If long-cherished ideals and
time-honoured institutions, if certain social assumptions and religious
formulae have ceased to promote the welfare of the generality of mankind,
if they no longer minister to the needs of a continually evolving humanity,
let them be swept away and relegated to the limbo of obsolescent and
forgotten doctrines. Why should these, in a world subject to the immutable
law of change and decay, be exempt from the deterioration that must needs
overtake every human institution? For legal standards, political and
economic theories are solely designed to safeguard the interests of humanity
as a whole, and not humanity to be crucified for the preservation of the
integrity of any particular law or doctrine.”227

Unity, Diversity and Continuity

The Universal House of Justice highlights the link between purely materialistic doctrines and the
belief in the inner aggressiveness of man: “Most particularly, it is in the glorification of material pursuits at once
the progenitor and common feature of all such ideologies, that we find the roots which nourish the falsehood that
human beings are incorrigibly selfish and aggressive”. (The Universal House of Justice, The Promise of World
Peace, 9).

Ibid. 8-9.

It is crucial to state that Bahá‟í appeals, which promote a federal structure
and decentralisation, only call for additional structures to global governance,
and do not advocate the abolition of the nation-state system, as they view
governance in an evolutionary, and not adversarial base.228 In this light,
Katirai observes, “While systems founded on an adversarial base may
regard compromise as essential because two positions are mutually
exclusive, those founded upon an evolutionary base see each stage as a
precursor to the next higher and more complex one.”229

The Bahá‟i Faith, thus, presents the image of a transformationalist, and not
hyperglobalist model, which signifies that it recognises that the nation-state
is in a period of transition, and not about to be extinct. The Bahá‟í stance in
relation to global governance is clearly between the insinuations of
hyperglobalizers, who affirm that the nation-state is going to disappear due
to transnational processes and the global economy,230 and between statist
statements, which put forward that the nation-state is not going to be even
slightly challenged by the processes of globalisation.231 Moreover, the Bahá‟í
Faith highlights the idea of a „turning point‟ in international affairs, or a
transition between national sovereignty and world unity, which many
international theorists recognise.232 The proponents of cosmopolitan
democracy, likewise, although not advocating a federal solution, admit that
the fate of the nation-state is outside of its hands. Heater notes, “The
political scientists who have devised the concept of cosmopolitan
democracy and those of like mind are sometimes dubbed
„transformationalists… they reject the interpretation of the „hyperglobalists‟
who foresee the trend of globalization as involving the complete collapse of
the nation-state”. 233

Shoghi Effendi did not hesitate to point out the anachronism of the nation-
state, as he clearly contended that the leaders of human institutions “…in
utter disregard of the spirit of the age, are striving to adjust to national
processes, suited to the ancient days of self-contained nations…”234More
recently, Peter Drucker argues that the nation-state is no longer the self
contained unit that it used to be in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries.
Indeed, for Drucker, the obsolescence of the nation-state demands the
creation of institutions, which would “overlap national boundaries and serve
transnational social and economic needs”.235 Toulmin argues that the new
age is characterised by adaptability and diversification instead of the old age

of stability and hierarchy. The nation-state is currently unable to respond to
our needs, and should be complemented by more global institutions. “… We
are learning that in an evolving world, institutions must be adaptable to deal
with evolving human problems”.236 Bahá‟u‟lláh proclaimed that the era of
the unity of nation had given way to the era of the unity of the world.
Indeed, for Bahá‟ís, the times surrounding each religious dispensation are
distinguished by a particular theme, the current one being the unity of
humankind. In the evolutionary religious context with which the Bahá‟í
Faith views all aspects of human life, including social and political aspects,
Shoghi Effendi explains that the main theme surrounding the Christian era
was that of the individual, and that the era of Islam had been marked by the
thematic of the unity of the nations.237

Due to the nature of its evolutionary and non-adversarial approach, the
Bahá‟í Faith recognises that the continued evolution of Christianity and
Islam (which does not mean that their messages are questioned; rather it
highlights an intrinsic link between religions) signifies that the adoption of a
world vision complements individual and national concerns. The present
religious theme, thus, is characterised by world unity, as the era of the self-
sufficiency of nation-states has come to an end. Bahá‟u‟lláh refers to the
love of one‟s country as still being a valid, yet insufficient and outdated,
notion. He said, “It is not his to boast who loveth his country, but it is his
who loveth the whole world.”238 While Bahá‟ís do advocate „a universal way
of life‟,239 universal institutions, and the consciousness of world citizenship,
they do not seek to diminish sane patriotic feelings, and the love that one
individual may have for his or her culture, language, traditions, provided
they do not become more important than wider, more global, concerns. U
Thant, Secretary General of the UN from 1962 to 1971, embodied this
image as he stated, “I do not criticize national pride. National pride is
natural. I say only that the sense of belonging to the human community must
be added to, and become dominant over other allegiances”.240 The Bahá‟í
image of world order is grounded in a holistic, rather than partial world-
view, and takes its main insight from the principle that what is of benefit to
the whole is of benefit to the part, as humankind is viewed as „one
organically whole entity‟.241 From this principle stems the consequential
ideas of continuity, unity, and complementarity. The love of one‟s country is
contained in the love of the world as the whole, continuity depicts different
stages from the part to the whole (from the family unit to the world), and all
of the parts are contained and act interdependently in this greater whole.

The Bahá‟í vision contains some convictions about the future of humankind,
due to its intrinsic religious character; namely Bahá‟u‟lláh envisions the
inevitability of world peace, but warns that this phase will not come
unhindered. Bahá‟ís are confident, despite all of the world turbulences –
which they consider to be a transitional step from a system of national
sovereignty to a world commonwealth of nations – that peoples of vision
and insight will lead humanity to world peace.242 In its 1985 statement, The
Promise of World Peace, the Universal House of Justice explains that flaws
in the international system are partly due to the fact that state sovereignty
has remained intact, and that this status quo impedes the adoption of
relevant solutions to the threatened collapse of the international economic
system, the spread of international anarchy and terrorism, or the inability of
sovereign nation-states to prevent war.243 This report proclaims that due to
„unfettered national sovereignty‟, and the attachment to old patterns of
behaviour, the path to world peace could be possibly horrifying. The
statement reads, “Whether peace is to be reached only after unimaginable
horrors precipitated by humanity‟s stubborn clinging to old patterns of
behaviour, or is to be embraced now by an act of consultative will, is the
choice before all who inhabit the earth”.244 Furthermore, the House of Justice
promotes the idea that „love of humanity‟ does not leave out „love of one‟s
country‟, and that „unbridled nationalism‟, which distinguishes itself from „a
sane patriotism‟, must be superseded by a love for humanity in general.245
Shoghi Effendi explains that all that the call raised by Bahá‟u‟lláh implies
and proclaims, is:

“The insufficiency of patriotism, in view of the fundamental changes
effected in the economic life of society and the interdependence of the
nations, and as the consequence of the contraction of the world, through the
revolution in the means of transportation and communication –conditions
that did not and could not exist either in the days of Jesus Christ or of
Muhammad. It calls for a wider loyalty, which should not, and indeed does
not, conflict with lesser loyalties. It instils a love which, in view of its scope,
must include and not exclude the love of one‟s own country. … It does
insist, however, on the subordination of national considerations and
particularistic interests to the imperative and paramount claims of humanity
as a whole, inasmuch as in a world of interdependent nations and peoples
the advantage of the part is best to be reached by the advantage of the
whole.246

Peter Khan, Introduction, p. xi.

In the words of Bahá‟u‟lláh, “signs of impeding convulsions and chaos can now be discerned,
inasmuch as the prevailing order appears to be lamentably defective”. (Bahá‟u‟lláh, Gleanings, 216).

The Universal House of Justice, The Promise of World Peace, p. 3. This image can be found in the
writings of Kant, who thought that nature would eventually lead us to reason and peace. In the Bahá‟í approach,
we have a choice between reason and nature to attain peace. If not attained by „an act of consultative will‟
(reason), peace will be realised by „unimaginable horrors‟ (nature).

Ibid., p. 13. An „unbridled‟ nationalism is exclusive and aggressive (defines itself against an ethnic
„other‟, and can lead to genocide) while a „sane‟ patriotism relates to a sense of belonging to a local/national
community, itself part of a wider cosmopolitan community, to which one still belongs.

‘The Great Assemblage’: Foundation of Global Governance and the
Lesser Peace

The process of the growing consciousness of world solidarity – which, in
Bahá‟í thought, constitutes an element and aspect of the twentieth century –
was referred to by „Abdu‟l‟Bahá as „the unity of nations‟. The latter is to
gradually shed its reflection in the political domain, the Lesser Peace.
Indeed, Bahá‟í thought maintains that the growing sense of world
consciousness can be associated with certain organisational developments in
the political domain.247 The „unity of nations‟ will, thus, be a crucial stage in
the development of a political peace among nations. Bahá‟u‟lláh expounded
on the Lesser Peace in the letters He sent to the major rulers of His age, and
advised them to reduce their armaments, and develop a system of collective
security. “O rulers of the earth! Be reconciled among yourselves, that ye
may need no more armaments save in a measure to safeguard your
territories and dominions...Be united... Should anyone among you take up
arms against another, rise ye all against Him, for this is naught but manifest
justice”. In another passage, Bahá‟u‟lláh referred to the Lesser Peace as a
gathering of world leaders, at which a system of security, unity, and concord
among the nations would be devised. “The time must come when the
imperative necessity for the holding of a vast, an all embracing assemblage
of men will be universally realised. The rulers and kings of the earth must
needs attend it, and, participating in its deliberations, must consider such
ways and means as will the lay the foundations of the world‟s Great Peace
among men”.248

Shoghi Effendi explains that, “The principle of collective security He
unreservedly urges; recommends the reduction in national armaments; and
proclaims as necessary and inevitable the convening of a world gathering at
which the kings and rulers of the world will deliberate for the establishment
of peace among the nations”.249 This call, reiterated more recently by the
Universal House of Justice and the BIC, now addresses itself to the heads of
nation-states, who have at this time become the highest-ranking decision-
makers, as well as to the global citizenry, who participates and gives input
(heard or unfortunately unheard) to these decisions.250The Lesser Peace will,
thus, be characterised by the delineation of a global order that comprises
institutions and laws to which nation-states abide, and endowed with the
means with which collective decisions can be enforced, while being

The United Nations can be regarded as one of the world organisational developments.

Bahá‟u‟lláh, in His time, appealed to „kings and rulers‟, while more recently the Bahá‟í International
Community calls on the heads of nation-states to consider the convocation of a world gathering. Bahá‟í

substantially supported by civil society organisation and participation.251 The
Bahá‟í vision only endorses a programme of global governance if it obtains
a consensus from the peoples of the world, nation-states, international
organisations, and NGOs, in brief all the major stakeholders.252 This
consensus is “the essential ingredient of any successful system of global
governance. It is the cornerstone of the Lesser Peace and the fruits of the
„Great Assemblage‟ of the leaders of the nations called by Bahá‟u‟lláh and
„Abdu‟l‟Bahá, wherein the foundations of a new global order and the unity
of the nation-states will be laid as the Lesser Peace”.253 This consensus
would be based on the global acceptance of common core values, and the
establishment of a general treaty or international constitution, which would
distinguish itself from old „cosmopolitan‟ notions of world conquest, or
universal conquests for personal and authoritarian designs, which did not
have at their basis the principle of true justice, and the normative equality of
peoples and nations.254

The call to world leaders to establish the Lesser Peace and obtain from it the
sanction of the peoples of the world have been raised by Bahá‟u‟lláh,
„Abdu‟l‟Bahá, the Universal House of Justice, and the Bahá‟í International
Community. Bahá‟u‟lláh called for the convocation of a „vast all-embracing
assembly‟; „Abdu‟l‟Bahá advocated for this assemblage to make of Peace
the cause of universal consultation, underlining that it should seek to
establish a union of the nations of the world and establish a binding treaty;
at the present time, the Universal House of Justice highlights that this
convocation is „long overdue‟. The BIC summons „a convocation of world
leaders… to consider how the international order might be redefined and
restructured to meet the challenges facing the world‟, with significant
participation and input from civil society. The BIC suggests that this
summit, which they propose could be called the „World Summit on Global
Governance‟,255 could draw on the experience underlying various successful
UN conferences.256 In particular, the Millennium People‟s Forum, held by
the United Nations in May 2000 and co-chaired by the BIC, was the first of
its kind in UN history to be a channel for civil society to forward
discussions and ideas to the General Assembly.257 One of the foundations of
peace is that peoples would gradually come to recognise their common
destiny (which is also enshrined in the principle of oneness) and would,
from this premise, have the will to act together, at least in matters vital to

More importantly, the Universal House of Justice does not believe that a system of collective
security will work if only based on political agreements and protocols. The Universal House of Justice calls such
as system of collective security „a chimera‟: it can only work with a strong moral foundation.

The Lesser Peace, being the term used by Bahá‟ís, to depict a political unity of nations.

“During…long evolutionary process… as ever larger and more diverse populations came under the
control of one or another system of government, the temptation of universal empire repeatedly seized the
imaginations of the Caesars and Napoleons during such expansion”. (Bahá‟í World Centre, Century of Light, 91).

The Commission on Global Governance also summoned such a summit, which it called a „world
conference on governance‟. (Commission on Global Governance, Our Global Neighbourhood, 351).

their concerns.258 In the context of the Lesser Peace, an integrative process is
characterised by growing global cooperation. World conferences, the
creation of the League of Nations and the United Nations, the increasing
number and participation of NGOs, and the strengthening of regional
organisations (such as the EU) are identified as a momentum towards the
Lesser Peace.

One of the outcomes of this World Summit, „Abdu‟l‟Bahá specified, would
be the enunciation of a treaty binding on governments. In particular, all
states and nations would have to submit to a body of contract, in which clear
principles of international relations and laws are laid down, and
consequential agreements and obligations would be ascertained and
binding.259 (These also include, as stated, worldwide disarmament, the
delineation of international borders and frontiers, the submission of disputes
to binding arbitration or judgement by a world court, and a „system of
collective security to ensure that international treaties are not violated.‟)260
The steps leading to the Lesser Peace, according to the Universal House of
Justice, are part of this „integrative process‟ articulated by Shoghi Effendi,
and comprise the features that can be identified as stages towards global
unity.

The various world conferences are part of this process that testifies to “an
emerging unity of thought in world undertakings”.261 The „promptitude and
spontaneity with which these government leaders have been acting together
in responding to a variety of world crises in different parts of the world‟,
„the cries...for attention to be given to the feasibility of achieving some form
of global governance‟, „the greater involvement of the United Nations‟, or
„the call raised for an international criminal court to be established‟ are some
of the signs that Bahá‟í contemplate as prerequisites for the Lesser Peace.262
In addition, the Universal House of Justice identifies important and
auspicious steps to world order which have gradually included the creation
of the League of Nations, followed by the United Nations whose formation
corresponded with the process of the ending of nation-building characterised
by the independence of numerous nations. The Universal House of Justice
also identifies their involvement with older nations in matters of mutual
concern. The international body elaborates on a number of steps that have
been taken towards the elaboration of world order: The consequent vast

These values of common concern comprise the elimination of prejudices based on class, gender,
race, level of economic and material development, and the right of all to an education, training, and socioeconomic
development. (Ulrich Gollmer, Bahá’í Political Thought, 431).

Ibid., p. 431

Ibid. and Brian Lepard, “From League of Nations”, p. 91. Shoghi Effendi did not call for a rigid
system of collective security, but for a flexible and elastic system. (See Shoghi Effendi, The World Order of
Bahá’u’lláh, p. 191) In this way, the projection of a global order, in the Bahá‟í viewpoint, “…does not contain a
fixed, static model… It does not present specific future events, but rather presents a vision calling to action,
providing guidance for the creation of a more peaceful future…” (Ulrich Gollmer, Bahá’í Political Thought, 431).

„Abdu‟l‟Bahá also refers to „a unity of thought in world undertakings‟. The Bahá‟í World Centre
elucidates that this alludes to „programmes of social and economic development, humanitarian aid and concern for
protection of the environment and its oceans‟. (Bahá‟í World Centre, Century of Light, pp. 127-128).

The Universal House of Justice, Letter: Unity of Nations and the Lesser Peace.

increase in cooperation among hitherto isolated and antagonistic peoples
and groups in international undertakings in the scientific, educational, legal,
economic and cultural fields; the rise in recent decades of an unprecedented
number of international humanitarian organisations; the spread of women‟s
and youth movements calling for an end to war; and the spontaneous
spawning of widening networks of ordinary people seeking understanding
through personal communication.263

The House of Justice subsequently proposes that the numerous groups that
have come together in the form of regional organisations to co-operate in
matters of common interest, such as the Association of South East Asian
Nations, the African Union, the European Union, or the international
congresses that testify to an urge to unity, are reflective of this trend.
Mentioning the integrative and disruptive processes, the Universal House of
Justice concludes, “Together with the opposing tendency to warfare and
self-aggrandizement against which it ceaselessly struggles, the drive
towards world unity is one of the dominant, pervasive features of life on the
planet during the closing years of the twentieth century”.264

The Bahá’í International Community’s Views on International
Organisations: Precursors of Global Institutions

The BIC recognises that the world is not ready for this system of planetary
government, and takes an incremental approach to the reform of the
international landscape that it recognises has grown in complexity since
1945\. As early as 1955, the first decade review of the UN charter, the BIC
proposed some guidelines for the reform of the United Nations
Organisation,265 based on the vision articulated by Bahá‟u‟lláh during His
lifetime. These suggestions have been endorsed by the BIC thirty years later,
although further expounded and complemented – a sign that not much has
changed in regards to the functioning of the UN in the last thirty years. In
accordance with its evolutionary mindset, the Bahá‟í International
Community does not call for UN abolition, but for its reform. The Bahá‟í
image of world order, furthermore, recognises the transitional period
delineating present times. This transition from a world based on national
sovereignty to a system of global governance, set around international
institutions that will develop into global institutions centred on humanity
rather than nation-states, has been termed a „turning point‟.266

Highlighting the Bahá‟í support for these organisations, the Universal House
of Justice notes, “The tentative steps towards world order, especially since

The Universal House of Justice, The Promise of World Peace, p. 4.

Ibid., 21.

Among these proposals were included the gradual removal of the veto, the references to permanent
members, the elimination of the term „enemy‟ in any article of the UN Charter, and the compulsory jurisdiction of
the International Court of Justice.

Precisely, the Bahá‟í International Community entitled its 1995 document on Global Governance
„Turning Point For All Nations‟.

World War II, give hopeful signs. The increasing tendency of groups of
nations to formalize relationships which enable them to co-operate in
matters of mutual interests...prepare the path to world order”.267 While
recognising the great achievements of the United Nations, and being active
observers of the organisation of the League of Nations, Bahá‟í statements
seek to reform organisations that embody a world vision while still based on
the dated principle of national sovereignty. The BIC accordingly notes,
“Each attempt [the League of Nations and the United Nations] sought to
address emergent recognition of global interdependence while preserving
intact state sovereignty above else”.268 This does not signify that these
organisations are not valued by the Universal House of Justice and the BIC;
rather, the Bahá‟í bodies contend that international organisations should
become more global. Indeed, the Bahá‟í International Community considers
that the intricate agglomerate of institutions and relationships governing the
international system, including the defunct League of Nations and the
contemporary United Nations, point toward the recognition of an
interdependent humanity, and a more adequate future global governance
system. Per se, “Often the United Nations most avowed critics have been its
most avid supporters”.269 Although the League of Nations and the United
Nations are far from being perfect bodies, they represent international
processes and organisations, which will eventually become more global.
Shoghi Effendi wrote in 1936:

“Though the great outcry raised by post-war nationalism is growing louder
and more insistent every day, the League of Nations is as yet in its
embryonic state, and the storm clouds that are gathering may for a time
totally eclipse its powers and obliterate its machinery, yet the direction in
which the institution itself is operating is most significant. The voices that
have been raised ever since its inception, the efforts that have been exerted,
the work that has already been accomplished, foreshadow the triumphs
which this presently constituted institution, or any other body that may
supersede it, is destined to achieve.”270

Moreover, despite all its failures, the League represented the first proper
attempt by the nations to „assume collective responsibility‟ and „collective
action‟. Consistent with the Bahá‟í proposition that there is a progression in
all aspects of international relations and history in general, the League of
Nations, followed by the perfected United Nations, are processes that will
eventually lead to a more complete and cosmopolitan system needed for the

Shoghi Effendi, The World Order of Bahá’u’lláh, 191. „Abdu‟l‟Bahá looked down upon the
Versailles settlement, which to Him was only capable of bringring about an even fiercer war. Even if the League
of Nations had been brought into being and represented a breakthrough in the concept of collective security, it
represented the beginning of a long process of international organisations that would eventually lead to the Lesser
Peace. However, it was not an effective collective body as such. (See Shoghi Effendi, The World Order of
Bahá’u’lláh, 30).

organisation of the planet, namely the long-time picture of a world federal
state or world commonwealth of nations based on a cosmopolitan model –
where not only states, but peoples are crucial elements. Both the federal and
commonwealth models represent alternative routes to world order that
would be increasingly centred on humanity, rather than nation-states.
According to Shoghi Effendi, the process, which launched the League of
Nations, represented the attainment “to that stage at which the oneness of
the whole body of nations will be made the ruling principle of international
life”.271 Indeed, Bahá‟ís assign a very important role to international
organisations as regards their potential to participate in a new design of
global governance. Lepard remarks, “…the history of international
organisation has reflected a steady evolution towards higher and higher
forms of unity and towards the development of a new awareness that the
diverse peoples of the earth together constitute a single world
community”.272 Moreover, the idea of process contains a powerful element
of optimism, which considers punctual failures (such as the League of
Nations or the refusal for an economic unity in Europe) as an impetus
towards an improved structural form. As Shoghi Effendi wrote:

“The fierce opposition which greeted the abortive scheme of the Geneva
Protocol; the ridicule poured upon the proposal of a United States of Europe
which was subsequently advanced, and the failure of the general scheme for
the economic unity of Europe, may appear as setbacks... And yet, are we not
justified in driving fresh encouragement when we observe that the very
consideration of these proposals is in itself an evidence of the steady growth
in the minds and hearts of men?”273

We can now notice that each of these institutions has been realised, although
ridiculed, and then hailed as failures.

Ethical Reforms

Part of the suggestions of the BIC relating to UN reform is based on a
reconsideration of human values, and a new starting point for building a
new system of global governance. The most important ethical consideration
in review is the interdependent relationship existing between the individual
and the international community, meaning that the individual unit is a
responsibility of the world community as a whole, in which national
citizenship or artificial constructed states are absolutely irrelevant.
Individual human beings, who are the units that make up humanity, must be
protected regardless of artificially constructed states. This is an important
aspect of human rights, as these rights originate from the body of mankind
as opposed to national communities that often impede their realisation. This
notion can be found in Thomas Paine‟s words “my principles are universal.

Ibid., p. 193.

Brian Lepard, From League of Nations, 79.

My attachment is to all the world, and not any particular part”.274 Thomas C.
Walker explains, “For Paine, there was a unity between the individual and
mankind. Particular national attachments should carry little weight with
enlightened men and women”.275 The BIC reiterates this point. Since the
body of humankind is indivisible, “each member of the human race is into
the world as a trust of the whole”.276 This relationship represents the
foundation of human rights, and is an important consideration for reforms to
be brought into the international system. Additionally, discussions about the
international order must include the generality of humanity, and not only
sections of people, usually leaders in all fields of human knowledge. This
discussion should involve men and women at the grassroots levels, and
should lead to a self-reinforcing process and growing awareness of world
citizenship.277 Finally, reforms pertaining to the United Nations, and other
international institutions, can only be envisaged in the light of their future
role in the international system. If criticism outweighs praise of the United
Nations, it is necessary, according to the BIC, to view the United Nations,
not in its present form, but with an „evolutionary mindset‟ i.e. with the view
of how it might operate within the future international order, and the
possible achievements and benefits it might be able to provide.278

This cosmopolitan basis is linked to more practical measures to reform the
UN body whose functioning operations have remained unchanged for the
last fifty years. Indeed, Bahá‟í suggested reforms are very much in line with
the reforms brought by the Commission of Global Governance.279 Among
many others, a point of common venture would be the call for the adoption
of new values along with the development and reform of the international
system. The BIC describes the report of the Commission on Global
Governance, Our Global Neighbourhood, as „one of the most balanced and
thoughtful‟ which „argues for the widespread adoption of new values, as
well as structural reforms in the United Nations system‟.280 The adoption of
new values should not just be a theoretical grounding, but according to the
Bahá‟í viewpoint ought to be enshrined in a Bill of Rights. In 1955 the BIC
stated, It is recommended that the United Nations adopt a Bill of Rights,
which guarantees to every individual freedom of speech, of the press, of
religion, and of thought, as well as freedom from racial and religious
discrimination, freedom from arbitrary arrest and imprisonment, equality of

The BIC also mentions the early work of the lawyers Glenville Clark and Louis B. Sohn, World
Peace Through World Law, and indicates that this work represented a „milestone‟, and was among the „first solid
proposals‟ in its early advocacy of the abolition of the veto power in the early 1950s. The BIC also quotes works
such as the „Stockholm Initiative‟, Common Responsibility in the 1990s and Benjamin Ferencz‟s work New Legal
Foundations for Global Survival. (Ibid., 23).

sexes, equality before the law, equality of opportunity, and other such basic
rights.281

The Commission on Global Governance re-echoes this wish by underlining
the necessity of elaborating a global Charter of civil society. “We…urge the
international community to unite in support of a global ethic of common
rights and shared responsibilities. In our view, such an ethic – reinforcing
the fundamental rights that are already part of the fabric of international
norms – would provide the moral foundation for constructing a more
effective system of governance”.282 Referring to rights and responsibilities
such as a secure life; equitable treatment; participation in governance at all
levels; equal access to information; equal access to the global commons; the
promotion of equity, including gender equity; and the preservation of
humanity‟s cultural and intellectual heritage; the Commission goes on to
state, “We believe this list of rights and responsibilities in the minimum
basis for progress in building a more civil global society… Over time, we
hope that these principles could be embodied in more binding international
document – a global Charter of Civil Society –…”283

In 1947, a Bahá‟í declaration on Human Rights (soon followed by a Bahá‟í
statement on Women‟s Rights) was submitted to the United Nations. After
becoming an accredited NGO at the United Nations in 1948, the BIC sent a
letter to former Secretary General, Mr Dag Hammarskjold in 1955, which
included proposals for the revision of the UN Charter.284 In the 1955
statement, the BIC put forward several suggestions regarding UN reform, as
it highlighted that „real sovereignty is no longer vested in the institutions of
the national state because the nations have become more interdependent‟,
…„that the existing crisis is moral and spiritual as well as political;‟ …„and
that the existing crisis can only be surmounted by the achievement of a
world order representatives of governments as well as the nations of
mankind.‟285 As well as underlining the erosion of national sovereignty, and
placing emphasis on moral aspects of governance, this statement joined the
advocacy of Bahá‟u‟lláh and „Abdu‟l‟Bahá when They called for a more
adequate representation of „peoples‟ in governance, in addition to
„governments‟. Both are complementary when it comes to decision-making
in the international community. The basis of these considerations was to
stand at the heart of practical reforms that demanded the timely
readjustment of the modus operandi of the UN. In this respect, the Bahá‟í
International Community suggests a body of proposals relating to the
operation of the main organs of the United Nations. These entail suggestions
for the reforms of the legislative, executive, and judicial functions of the
UN.

The BIC deplores the lack of cosmopolitan ingredient within the structure
and functioning of international organisations. Indeed, most of these failures
are due to the fact that the United Nations represents an assemblage of
nation-states, which often strive to maximise their self interests.
Accordingly, the BIC remarks, “The United Nations lacks not only the clear
authority but also the requisite resources to act effectively in most instances.
Accusations of the United Nations‟ failures are in fact indictments of
member-states themselves”.286 Similarly, the report of the Commission on
Global Governance remarks:

“When governments or people speak of reform of the United Nations, they
address a process of change that has to begin in national behaviour, not on
the banks of the East River in New York. National behaviour is a product of
national decision-making and national policies: it is here that strengthening
of the UN must begin. Worthwhile reforms of UN structures ought to be
pursued, and we propose several in this report, but the greatest failings of
the UN have not been structural: they have been collective failings of the
member-states… The point cannot be made more emphatically.”287

Structural Reforms: Legislative, Executive, and Judicial Functions of
the UN

In an earlier passage, it was noted that the Bahá‟í view of history is a
progressive one, namely one that passes through different stages. The
collective life of humanity has, thus, been compared with the life of an
individual going through childhood, adolescence, and maturity. As this view
concerns the common life of humanity as a single body, it applies to
international organisations, and their constant improvement. The League of
Nations could, hence, be compared to the embryonic stage of the life of
international institutions, and Bahá‟í reforms concerning the international
system are intrinsically linked to the view that evolution is a feature of
human life. As such, international organisations are thought to lead to ever-
closer integration in the life of humanity, founded upon the growing
recognition of the oneness of humankind. The realisation of the oneness of
humankind, an ethical foundation, is linked to giving more means of
enforcement to the main organs of the United Nations, which are to
safeguard the individual from abuse and injustice, and to advance the
process of peaceful change. Bahá‟ís, thus, view the improvement of the UN
as a move towards the goal of human history, i.e. global unity.288 Structural
reforms are also enshrined in the belief that human nature is not inherently
aggressive, that transformation is possible, and that the physical integration
of humankind is a mirror of the oneness of mankind, as discussed above.

Insofar as, in the words of „Abdu‟l‟Bahá, the individual is “in need of
cooperation and association”,289 his/her well-being is better served through
operations which can optimise this human need, which due to the global
stage in which we find ourselves, take the form of intricate global
cooperation. Morality and ethics, as it was underlined, are the reflection of
more global cooperative and practical efforts, reflected in the proposal for
retaining independent functional organisations, which promote global
integration, and international peace.

Thus, Bahá‟í practical reforms keep in line with promoting a vision of unity
sustained by the principle of oneness, seek to maintain and reinforce the
spirit of collaboration in an interdependent and single humanity, and stress
the importance of the participation of peoples in world affairs. In brief,
Bahá‟í practical reforms are linked to the more theoretical views of the
Faith, as they seek to enhance more peaceful relations central to the vision
of human integration and oneness, developed by Bahá‟u‟lláh, „Abdu‟l‟Bahá,
and Shoghi Effendi. It has been argued that the normative basis of the
oneness of mankind is also thoroughly linked with the notion of breaking
away from the concept of state sovereignty, which by underpinning the
centrality of states, fails to recognise the fact of global interdependence, and
limits international affairs to an outdated state-centric view. Since “the
anarchy inherent in state-sovereignty is moving to a climax”,290 the United
Nations must demonstrate the ability to disregard this concept. This
theoretical background is reflected in the suggested reforms for the three
main organs of the UN, which are the General Assembly, the Security
Council, and the International Court of Justice. The reforms of the UN, as
proposed by the BIC, are in line with the vision of Shoghi Effendi, when he
referred to the very long-term vision of a world federal government.
Namely, he mentioned that the world parliament should create binding law,
that an international force should back up the world executive, and that the
world tribunal should have binding decisions on the parties and on all
disputes that may arise in the international system. Shoghi Effendi,
furthermore, noted that the world parliament should be elected by the
peoples, and that the supreme tribunal should have „a binding effect even in
such cases where the parties concerned did not voluntarily agree to submit
their case into consideration‟.291 This is reflected, as we shall see in the next
section, in the more incremental reforms of the three main organs of the UN.

Starting with the General Assembly, the BIC identifies its main failures with
the „undue weight to state sovereignty and a mix of anarchy and
conservatism‟ as well as its inability to enforce sanctions.292 It, henceforth,
calls for a more representative General Assembly, indeed, one that would
represent more accurately both the peoples and nations of the world. This

„Abdu‟l‟Bahá, The Promulgation of Universal Peace, 35

Ibid.

Bahá‟í International Community, Turning Point For All Nations, 8.

call is reminiscent of the advocacy cited in the writings of „Abdu‟l‟Bahá in
1875, “… it would be preferable if the election of non-permanent members
of consultative assemblies … should be dependent on the will and choice of
the people…”293 Indeed, unlike people‟s acceptance of national and local
legislative bodies, international legislative bodies are likely to entice
suspicion insofar as they are not adequately represented.294 Additionally, the
resolutions of the UN should have the force of law, and be endowed with
provisions and sanctions, so that they can address the needs of an
increasingly interdependent humanity more efficiently, and abandon certain
paralysing aspects of state sovereignty. The BIC states:

“In a reformed United Nations, the legislative branch and its voting
structure will need to represent more accurately the people of the world as
well as nation-states. Second, General Assembly resolutions are not binding
unless they are separately ratified as a treaty by each member state. If the
current system, which places state sovereignty above all other concerns, is
to give way to a system which can address the interests of a single and
interdependent humanity, the resolutions of the General Assembly – within
a limited domain of issues – must gradually come to possess the force of
law with provisions for both enforcement and sanctions. These two
shortcomings are closely linked inasmuch as the majority of the world‟s
people, suspicious and fearful of world government, are unlikely to submit
to an international institution unless it is itself more genuinely
representative.”295

These reforms are suggested so as to promote the image of a single and
interdependent humanity, which constitutes the more normative principles
of the Faith that have been reviewed previously, and the emphasis that
Bahá‟u‟lláh placed on „peoples‟ in His recommendations on a global
governance system, or the equivalent of a global civil society. For the short-
term reforms of the GA, the BIC proposes five measures. Firstly, it suggests
that minimum requirements should be raised and determined by the way a
government conduct itself towards its peoples:

“Without an unshakeable commitment to regular and periodic elections,
universal participation by secret ballot, freedom of expression, and to other
such human rights, a member state stands in the way of the active and
intelligent participation of the vast majority of its population in the affairs of
its own communities. We propose that there should be consequences for
member states violating these standards. Similarly, nations seeking
recognition should be denied membership until they openly espouse these
standards or make recognizable efforts to move in that direction.”296

„Abdu‟l‟Bahá, The Secret of Divine Civilization, 24.

This also explains the suspicion shown towards the discussion, for example, of a world government.

The demands for a more democratic representation within the General
Assembly, and for raising minimum requirements for membership (this
would include, for example, a commitment to human rights) are regarded as
foundational in the operations of the General Assembly. Violations of
human rights in national systems are most certainly bound to have negative
effects on the international system as a whole, as they impede on citizenry
participation, which is crucial to the flourishing of international society. The
Bahá‟í Faith holds no dogmatic views on how population differences would
be handled, as long as they are part of a fair system. What is suggested is
changing the „one state, one vote‟ principle of the General Assembly into
„some form of proportionate representation‟, which would make the General
Assembly a more equal partner with the Security Council.297 In a letter in
1942, Shoghi Effendi explained that even though „Abdu‟l‟Bahá provided a
clear vision of global governance, these concerned more fundamental
principles than a rigid formula:

“Though it is premature to try and endeavour to foresee on what basis
various nations would be represented on any international council, or in any
international form of government, it is clear from the Bahá‟í standpoint that
it could only be carried out on the basis of true justice; and justice does not
imply one race having a preponderating vote over some other race‟s
representatives, and thus being in a position to dominate them.”298

Other proposals relating to the legislative function include the setting up of
an International Commission in order to study the question of international
boundaries instead of relegating the problem to the World Court. The latter
commission would serve as a study-ground and as a practical agency for the
assessments of threats against various civil groups, and the results of its
research would serve as a warning system for growing tensions among
various groups.299 The 1995 report of the BIC deplores the way in which
nation-states were initially arbitrarily designed, a situation that has led to
many conflicts, and which highlights the need for a more genuine general
reassessment and agreement on national borders. “In order to establish a
genuine community of nations in the long run, it will be necessary to settle
finally all disputes among borders. This research would serve that end”.300
[Emphasis added] This measure aims at providing a short-term remedy for
ethnic conflicts, as these conflicts also have to be tackled at the level of
principle, that is, by promoting global values that would seek to efface
hatred and exclusiveness in the very long-term. If like Mitrany, we could say
that this would bring about discord, according to the Bahá‟í view, this is a
short-term measure (as with most proposals that relate to UN reforms) that
could provide a basis upon which ethnic conflicts could be brought to

appeasement. As boundaries were mostly arbitrarily designed (the
boundaries of the majority of the nations are identical with the boundaries of
colonial states established by the European powers), the Bahá‟í view
contends that there should be an authority to settle boundary disputes
adequately. It is in the light of this recognised hindrance to peace and
security that the latter proposal is made. That the Bahá‟í ethos does not seek
to do away with groupings such as the nation-state is mirrored in this BIC
proposal, and in the call for reassessing international borders for greater
security, and as a preventive measure against conflicts. More importantly,
there is recognition that boundaries are artificial and imagined, but since
they exist, there must be short-term mechanisms to deal with them.

Anderson‟s observation that nations are no more than “imagined
communities” that require considerable social and political engineering to
propagate, echoes „Abdu'l-Bahá‟s much earlier description of nations and
peoples as “limited unities” which are “imaginary and without real
foundation”.301 “The artificial and arbitrary nature of national boundaries,
coupled with insufficient mechanisms for handling boundary disputes, has
been one of the major sources of inter-national conflict in the past two
centuries”.302 Indeed, the Bahá‟í model rests on a long term vision, which
through intermediary steps, sets to achieve a real unity among peoples. In a
time of ethnic hatred, a more adequate reconfiguration of boundaries would
serve as a „warning system‟. Though like Mitrany, the Bahá‟í ethos seeks to
render frontiers „meaningless‟, it is more in a sense of feelings, attitudes,
and principles. It is clear that the Bahá‟í Faith does not simply base its
commitment to peace on ideological commitments either. It seeks to
promote an active peace, not only based on a political basis, but on the
release of the powers of the individual; a new conception of human
relationships; the reduction of the gap between extremes of wealth and
poverty; and the promotion of sustainable development measures. More
importantly, world citizenship education is viewed as a long-term preventive
measure against ethnic-based conflicts.

“Consciousness of the oneness of humanity, if taught to the next generation,
could protect it from ethnic and religious conflict and encourage processes
of collaboration and conciliation. It could generate a desire to base decisions
on just principles and lead to the development of laws that are „universal in
both character and authority‟”.303

As regards financial arrangements, which are a great impediment to the
successful conduct of UN operations, the BIC underlines that voluntary
arrangements would never be sufficient, and suggests that an expert task
force should be established to search for new solutions. The BIC adds, “In
studying alternatives, the Task Force should be mindful of several

„Abdu‟l‟Bahá spoke of the oneness of humankind and the artificiality of boundaries.

fundamental principles. First, there should be no assessments without
representation. Second, in the interest of fairness and justice, assessments
should be graduated. Third, mechanisms for encouraging voluntarily
contributions should not be overlooked”.304 In addition to these proposals,
the BIC, in line with the writings of Bahá‟u‟lláh305 and „Abdu‟l‟Bahá, calls
for an Expert Commission to be appointed in order to make a commitment
to “an auxiliary international language and script”, whose aim would be to
“facilitate the transition to a global society through better communication”.
Moreover, reflecting the need for greater global integration, the BIC
promotes the establishment of a Commission for the development of an
international currency.306 In view of the federal mindset that the Bahá‟í
International Community is endowed with, and the weight it gives to the
diversity of peoples and the protection of minorities, such a statement does
not imply the demise of any culture or language, but rather seeks to
supplement the existing world languages. This Bahá‟í reform suggests that
unity could be structurally realised through the input of an expert task force,
which would study and seek to implement a universal auxiliary language.
“Such a move”, the BIC states, “would go far toward promoting a spirit of
unity”.307 This is an aspect of the Bahá‟í view that theory (unity) and practice
(in this case the devise of a universal language) are interrelated; indeed,
„Abdu‟l‟Bahá spoke of treading the spiritual path with practical feet.308

In addition, the BIC holds the view that the Security Council “suffers from
an inability to take decisive action”. Hence, the BIC makes four suggestions
for the short term. It proposes “as a transitionary step, measures to be
introduced to curb the exercise the veto power to reflect the original
intention of the Charter”.309 Other measures to strengthen the decision-
making role of the Security Council and its enforcement powers include the
creation of an International Force under the command of the Security
Council and Secretary General financed by the General Assembly, whose
personnel would come from all parts of the world. “If properly
implemented, this Force would also provide a sense of security that might
encourage steps towards global disarmament, thereby making possible an
outright ban on all weapons of mass destruction”.310 The BIC adds, in line
with the counsels of Bahá‟u‟lláh to the sovereigns of His time, that states
should only need armaments for internal security, and for their own
defence.311 Other proposals related to the strengthening of the Security

Lady Blomfield, The Chosen Highway, Wilmette: Bahá‟í Publishing Trust, 1956, 210.

In this regard, the BIC states, “The original intention of the UN Charter in conferring veto power on
the five Permanent Members was to prevent the Security Council from authorizing military actions against a
Permanent Member or requiring the use of its forces against its will. In fact, beginning with the Cold War, the veto
power has been exercised repeatedly for reasons that relate to regional or national security”. (Bahá‟í International
Community, Turning Point For All Nations, 11).

Council include furthering the concept of collective security to local
problems (a concept of human security), as many local threats are „the result
of the complex breakdown of the present-day global order‟. “These threats
include but are not limited to international drug trafficking, food security,
and the emergence of new global pandemics”.312 The value of oneness
touches upon the centrality of human rights, and the demand for more solid
action to tear apart the concept of state sovereignty. Collective action is not
only required in the case of military aggression, but also in the case of
human aggression within the state (genocide), and other problems occurring
as the result of the breakdown of the global system. Former Secretary
General Kofi Annan observed “the collective interest is the national interest
…when we read the Charter today, we are more than ever conscious that its
aim is to protect human beings, not to protect those who abuse them”.313
Annan‟s „Global Compact‟ and the emerging norm of a „Responsibility to
Protect‟ (R2P) are part of a wider global urge to usher durable changes.

In addition, if the international system is to be based on the normative
principles of „unity in diversity‟, the concepts of the veto and of the
permanent membership in the Security Council clearly jeopardise principles
of equality and fairness. The oneness of mankind also justifies that Bahá‟í
reforms have been suggested as early as 1955 as regards removing the veto
and permanent membership in the Security Council, and the importance of
democracy in international relations. Laszlo remarks that international
organisations are bodies that are not truly global, but international: they still
operate within the climate of state sovereignty and self interest as opposed
to the global interest.314 “Such arrangements”, Katirai states, “are not just
bad governance but in dire contradiction to what the Commission on Global
Governance calls the „principles of universality and the equality of member-
states‟ that so many, including the nation-states, presume should underlie
international undertakings”.315

The BIC, as briefly noted, recognises the great importance of functional-
styled executive organisations such as the WHO or UNICEF, bodies with
which it closely works. Moreover, the creation of these organisations
coincides with the vision of the „century of light‟, as it refers to “the
growing acceptance of the principle of oneness and its implications”. For
„Abdu‟l‟Bahá, physical integration would advance “the conditions that
permit achievement of the ideal” (universal peace), as these organisations
are a “reflection” of the “consciousness of world solidarity”, crucial to the
prelude of the Lesser Peace.316 Not only do functional organisations embody
effectiveness, but they are also based on the moral need for collective action
that supports the unity of mankind and the prosperity of its peoples. The

BIC positively remarks, “As an international organisation, the United
Nations has demonstrated humanity‟s capacity for united action in health,
agriculture, education, environmental protection, and the welfare of
children”.317 Additionally, mentioning the independent organisations in the
UN family, and as part of the suggested reforms it proposed, the BIC notes
that these successful executive functions (WHO, UNICEF, The UPU, or
the ILO) should retain and reinforce their independence.318 These proposals
emphasise the functional mindset of the BIC, as they call for expert task
forces to search for appreciate solutions. These functional organisations
have demonstrated the capacity for “united action in health, agriculture,
education, environmental protection, the welfare of children” as well as the
“collective moral will to build a better future”.319 Morality and ethics are
here another example of the reflection of more global cooperative and
practical efforts, which are found in the proposal for retaining independent
functional organisations, which promote global integration, and
consequently international peace.

Finally, the importance of the judicial function of the UN is underlined. “In
any system of governance, a strong judicial function is necessary to
moderate power of the other branches and to enunciate, promulgate, protect
and deliver justice… no lasting world civilization can be founded unless it is
firmly grounded in the principle of justice”.320 Emphasising the positive
elements of the International Court of Justice created in 1945, such as the
diversity of a varied international judicial panel, the BIC calls for the
extension of the Court‟s jurisdiction and suggests that other organs of the
United Nations, not only member states, be given the right to bring cases
before the Court. This suggestion is reflective of cosmopolitan propositions
that states cannot be the sole actors in international relations and law. As
well as expanding the Court‟s jurisdiction, the BIC calls for the expansion of
issue areas such as international terrorism and drug trafficking. Without
doubt, proposals that involve the subject of the International Court of Justice
require that it should deliver legally binding decisions. The crucial place of
the theme of „justice‟ in Bahá‟í thought justifies its support for the creation
of bodies such as the ICC that places human rights over state interests.
“Justice”, the BIC states, “is the one power that can translate the dawning
consciousness of humanity‟s oneness into a collective will through which
the necessary structures of global community life can be confidently
erected”.321 Clearly, practicing justice is another facet of the ethical,
normative, and cosmopolitan principles of the Faith based on humanity, and
not on states. In light of the „ethical‟ and „spiritual‟ nature of the Bahá‟í
Faith, these practical measures to reform the United Nations are not,
however, sufficient. The BIC recognises the crucial importance of releasing

Ibid, 12.

the powers latent in the individual, and providing development paradigms
not only with a material, but also a moral and spiritual dimension.322 The
BIC also seeks to instil a closer relationship between peoples and their
international organisations in order to invalidate the dichotomy between
them and us.323 Furthermore, the encouragement of the greater participation
of women in international affairs – who, in Bahá‟í eyes, have an essential
role to play in the establishment of Universal Peace – and the promotion of
a more just system of global economic justice are important aspects of the
BIC institutional reform programme. The BIC, thus, notes:

“Bahá‟u‟lláh announced the arrival of the time, foretold, in all of the world‟s
scriptures, when humanity would at last witness the uniting of all peoples
into a peaceful and integrated society. He said that human destiny lies not
merely in the creation of a materially prosperous society, but also in the
construction of a global civilization where individuals are encouraged to act
as moral beings who understand their true nature and are able to progress
towards a greater fulfilment that no degree of material bounty can
provide.”324

The Bahá’í Approach and Cosmopolitan IR

By way of conclusion, I will now highlight some of the similarities, and yet
essential dissimilarities of form between IR and the Bahá‟í approach, and
how the latter can lend support to a growing cosmopolitan IR. Indeed,
Bahá‟í principles seem to be closely linked to the negatively labelled
„idealist‟ („Wilsonian‟ IR), or neo-idealist (Held, Falk, and Archibugi call for
the democratisation of international structures, and global civil movements)
branches of IR. Indeed, idealists (as they came to be pejoratively called)
promoted the ideals of the League of Nations, the concept of collective
security, world citizenship, education, disarmament, an international police
force, and arbitration. In addition, the respect for human rights, the
alleviation of poverty, and the rule of law are strong features of this
conceived order. If, however, the „idealist‟ or „liberal‟ branch of IR can be
criticised for being too universalising, Bahá‟í principles emphasise the need
for diversity in unity. In other words, as we are „one human family‟
(oneness), we have different viewpoints, and sometimes grow to adopt
different values (diversity), but we are still able to collaborate, and care for
each other.

In this respect, and in order to illustrate the inclusiveness of the Bahá‟í
perspective on cosmopolitanism, it can also be said that the latter represents
a departure in sacred thinking as it does not rely on a believer/infidel

“Development should not be confused with the creation of an unsustainable consumer society…
Education is the best investment in economic development… Because of the spiritually damaging nature of
dependency, schemes which focus solely on redistributing material wealth are doomed to failure in the long run”.

See Commission on Global Governance, Our Global Neighbourhood, 226-227.

dichotomy, but rather stresses the importance of tolerance and philanthropy.
Bahá‟u‟lláh noted that it was indispensable that the peoples of the world
“…observe tolerance and righteousness, which are two lights amidst the
darkness of the world and two educators for the edification of mankind.”325
By proclaiming the oneness of humanity, Bahá‟u‟lláh, in addition, dissolved
the dichotomy between believer and infidel. He wrote, “There can be no
doubt whatever that the peoples of the world, or whatever race or religion,
derive their inspiration from one heavenly source…”326 „Abdu‟l‟Bahá, in this
regard, notes that there is no justification to account for one‟s own belief as
“light and all others as darkness”.327 Bahá‟í thinking, therefore, moves away
from division (religious beliefs are not a condition to be excluded from the
cosmopolis) towards ideas on unity based on the premise that human beings,
regardless of gender, race, religion, and class form part of the same, yet
diverse, human family. Denominations cannot preclude our common
humanity.

It is also relevant to the cosmopolitan tradition that the Bahá‟í model does
not concentrate on „events‟, but rather on the notion of „process‟.
Interestingly, it is this focus on events, which discredited the „idealist‟ and
more normative branch of IR, and promoted the realist tradition through the
arguments of the failure of the League of Nations, and the advent of WW2.
The Bahá‟í model, by focusing on process, sees that „integrative and
disruptive‟ forces work in opposition to each other, but will eventually lead
to peaceful human and state relations. In the very long run, the numerous
organisations of civil society and the other organisational consequences
flowing from the interdependence of nations can foster cosmopolitan values,
and override parochial and conflict-ridden values without undermining the
local level and grassroots initiatives often led by women in the so-called
developing world. Bahá‟í political scientist W. Andy Knight, referring to
world disorder as „disruption‟ and „disintegration‟, writes, “what is clear
from the writings of Bahá‟u‟lláh, „Abdu‟l‟Bahá and Shoghi Effendi is that
world disorder is a prerequisite for the ushering in of World Order…”328
This very concept can be linked to this phase of „transition‟ and
„transformation‟ acknowledged by various IR theorists cited at the
beginning of this paper.329 Martin Shaw, likewise, underlines the concept of
„global transition‟, and propounds the idea that catastrophes (disintegration)
often represent a stimulus for transformation: “the gains in the development
of international law enforcement have been responses to some of the worst,
genocidal episodes among many crimes against humanity, in which millions
have suffered.”330

However, the acknowledgment of acute crises does not equate to ignoring,
belittling, or blindly accepting the traumatic effects of the disintegration
process on the body of humankind and the human suffering this generates.
Rather, these conditions call for a process of increased awareness and
informed engagement that reinforce the caring ethos of world citizens. W.
Andy Knight goes on to state:

“Civil wars and internecine violence exploded in places like Afghanistan,
Cambodia, Rwanda, the Former Yugoslavia, Bosnia, and Columbia. The
debacle in Somalia, followed by a genocide in Rwanda, ethnic cleansing in
Serbia and Kosovo, and the politically-motivated slaughter in places like the
Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), Sudan, Sierra Leone, Liberia and
Mozambique, and the continued violence in the Middle East, Chechnya,
Sudan, Uganda, Ethiopia/Eritrea, Zimbabwe, parts of Central and Latin
America, and Asia indicated a persistent adherence to a culture of violence
in the latter part of the twentieth century… To this can be added
longstanding and continuing problems of unchecked population growth,

The choice of employing cosmopolitanism was, firstly, made in
consideration of the „reality‟ of the oneness of mankind, but also on the
grounds that particularistic theories have failed or are failing to manage
current world affairs as they foster the politics of human suffering. In
addition to its views on IR, Bahá‟í ethical cosmopolitanism could be said to
represent a contribution to post-positivist, and normative thinking, while
retaining the spirit of criticism,332 and cosmopolitanism in modernity. Bahá‟í
views contribute to reinforcing the „sensitive turn‟ taken by
cosmopolitanism, which stresses diversity, in the sense of abandoning a
domineering and homogeneous universalism. Indeed, Bahá‟í views have
been anticipatory of the new „sensitive‟ turn promoted by critical
international theory, feminist theory, or postmodernism from the last two
decades of the twentieth century onwards.333 Already in the midst of the
nineteenth century Bahá‟u‟lláh, and „Abdu‟l‟Bahá in the early twentieth
century, had promoted the deconstruction of „otherness‟ as a means to bring
about the unity of mankind, and the solidarity of the human race. In the
1910s, „Abdu‟l‟Bahá deplored how the notions of otherness impeded the

realisation of the oneness of humankind, and hence the achievement of an
unbounded global community. He stated, “See ye no strangers.... for love
and unity come hard when ye fix your gaze on otherness”. [Emphasis
added]334 Lately, these anticipatory views have been advanced in new
critical IR theories, with the aim of fostering inclusiveness, and
deconstructing strangeness and otherness. In particular, critical international
theory holds that, by promoting divisions, the division between inside and
outside alienate peoples from one another, erects barriers of strangeness, and
directly infringe on more peaceful relations.

Bahá‟í views relate, and are not entirely dissociated from the „mainstream‟
cosmopolitan tradition.335 Like the latter, they are concerned with the
promotion of the common good, the need for more global and peaceful
forms of communities, and they seek to discredit the view that human nature
is inherently belligerent.336 Bahá‟í views promote global values, the ethos of
world citizenship, and the improvement of international institutions (like the
United Nations), global institutions (like the International Criminal Court),
and the idea of consultation amidst diverse communities. Bahá‟í
international thinking, indeed, connects to the branch of IR that is concerned
with regional and global integration, world order, communities of fate,
functional organisations, and the unity of mankind. It calls for the creation
of a political, economic, and social system, which will distribute the benefits
of interdependence fairly, and not to the advantage of the powerful, thus
avoiding extremes in wealth and poverty (here the emphasis is on
„creation‟). Indeed, although the interdependence of nations is a
cosmopolitan aspect (in the form of globalisation, as a case in point), the
Bahá‟í view upholds that it is not sufficient for bringing international
prosperity in a natural harmony of interests. Bahá‟ís, like cosmopolitans
such as Richard Falk and David Held point to the much darker side of
globalisation. The democratisation and accountability of global institutions
is an important facet of this issue, as has been discussed, with the mounting
importance of global civil society. The Bahá‟í perspective is, in this sense,
not idealistic, but rather normative: “It proposes pursuit of change in desired
directions through both intellectual and social engagement and not through
intellectual idealization alone.”337 World order will not simply usher better
conditions due to conditions of global interdependence, but global will and
intervention, and unprecedented efforts are required. W. Andy Knight
clarifies that although the Bahá‟í view upholds that peace is „inevitable‟, it
does not view it as “an ephemeral „thing‟ out there that will somehow fall

from heaven into the laps of humanity…”338 In order to be universal and
sustainable, peace requires „a fundamental transformation of world order‟.339

Where Bahá‟ís depart from IR theories, cosmopolitan or not, is that for
Bahá‟ís, IR theories are the result of speculation, worked out by the human
mind. By contrast, they believe that Bahá‟í principles do not flow from an
activity of the human mind, but are the result of a fusion of reason (to search
and choose principles) and faith (to trust the reality of principles that are
beyond the speculations of the human mind).340 World order is, therefore, the
amalgamation of elements of human agency (we decide to intervene) and
more revelational elements that belong to a non-human and more mystical
plan (even if we decided not to intervene, the unity of humanity remains an
aspect of a divine plan for mankind). Human agency can decide upon the
means and rapidity by which to achieve a process of unity, but this process
has already been set in motion. Bahá‟í views are, thus, essentially different,
in the sense that they have been advocated by a world religion, which
asserts the spiritual nature (ethics) of cosmopolitanism, and not only its
material side, i.e. global, technological, and physical interdependence. The
Bahá‟í model reflects the concerns of the secular cosmopolitan approach,
and at the same time remains a non-secular approach: the spiritual destiny of
mankind lies in its unity. In this way, the Bahá‟í model offers a
reconciliation between the more ethical views of cosmopolitanism
propounded from ancient times to the Enlightenment, and more recent
material approaches propounded, for example, by Mitrany‟s functionalism.

The Bahá‟í model could represent a basis for highlighting the relevance to
the welfare of humanity of fulfilling both, basic material needs, and those of
a spiritual/ethical nature, animated by an ethos of oneness.341 Material goals
are essential (for example, everyone should have the basic human rights to
food and shelter) to fulfil the real purpose of humanity, which is „spiritual‟
in nature. The reality of humanity is „spiritual‟ in the sense that human
beings potentially reflect the virtues of a „higher nature‟, an aspect given to
the whole of mankind, and not only to privileged categories. (This justifies
the notion that achieving the unity of humanity does not represent a utopian
goal). In turn, the oneness of humankind is both a „material‟
(biological/scientific) and a „spiritual‟ principle (value-laden), which can
assist the reinvention of IR along more inclusive parameters. The Bahá‟í
approach has, thus, reinforced cosmopolitanism through the exposition of a
reality that reflects a „spiritual‟ principle of oneness, and whose direction is
geared towards a cosmopolitan path. As Cheshmak Farhoumand-Sims and

The basis of faith, for Bahá‟ís, lies in the Revelation of Bahá‟u‟lláh as a new „divine‟ revelation for
our global age.

It bears restating that the basis of faith, for Bahá‟ís, lies in the Revelation of Bahá‟u‟lláh as a new
„divine‟ revelation for our global age.

In this sense, the oneness of humankind is useful in highlighting the artificiality of the concept of a
closed and homogeneous nation, and the divisive and insufficient aspects of a material cosmopolitanism, concepts
which are both ethically deficient.

Charles Lerche note, “In our rapidly globalizing era, relevant models of
peace building must envision humanity as a collective whole rather than
contending parts, be based on global ethics and more fully incorporate the
inward, spiritual dimensions of human experience.”342 Here the Bahá‟í
model of world order can make interesting inroads into International
Relations theory, as the reality it describes is not linked to imposition, but
rather to emancipation. Emancipation from the bounds of the limitedness of
bounded communities, emancipation from overly materialist views which
promote inequalities, and emancipation from discrimination based upon the
„unreal‟ dichotomies of race, class, gender, age etc.... This order,
furthermore, to be justifiable, has to be created through human agency and
consent, which is supported by the assistance of a not fully comprehensible
divine and mysterious Being („God‟).

We can also note that the Bahá‟í approach assists in giving cosmopolitan
„purpose‟ to IR, by advocating the need for a level of principle (the oneness
of humanity), and privileging the value of unity. The Bahá‟í Faith, through
the principle of the oneness of humankind, can lend new lenses to IR on
how we can possibly view the world. It builds the bridge between the
concept of unity, which is now criticised by postmodernism, because of the
ideas of totality, domination, and homogenisation, and the concept of
diversity of opinions, ethnic characteristics, gender, which can reinforce,
and not threaten that unity. Indeed, Bahá‟í views reinforce cosmopolitanism
by asserting that diversity has been created to contribute to the „quality‟ of
unity, and that both are not irreconcilable. They assert possible avenues of
communication to reach the stage of common understanding, tolerance,
awareness of multiplicity of thinking that reinforces the idea of a „unity‟,
which is the result of manifold aspects, and not only that of a domineering,
same, and imposing element.

Moreover, the „level of principle‟ asserts the possibility of solving jingoism,
xenophobia, and nationalism (the antitheses of cosmopolitanism) at a
spiritual level, and as a basis for unity. This is not only dealt with at a mere
theoretical level, but also at a very practical one. „Principles‟ can serve as a
basis for action and transformation; likewise, it can be argued, theories
should serve the welfare of humanity, and should exist for a practical
purpose. When people recognise the need for unity through the argument of
the validity of the oneness of humankind, they are able to deconstruct
images of strangeness propounded by the way the world is shaped (that is a
world of divided jurisdictions of sovereign states). The way we look at the
world when defined by the oneness of humankind, has the potentiality of
transforming parochialism into cosmopolitanism. This shows how the level
of principle can assist in promoting cosmopolitan attitudes.

Cheshmak Farhoumand-Sims & Charles Lerche, “Perspectives on Peace Building”, in: Charles

Lerche (ed.), Healing the Body Politic, 22.

Through this reality of oneness, we can construct an alternative way of
building the world, not only because it is possible to do so (a post-positivist
view), but because it reflects spiritual/divine reality. The Bahá‟í Faith
creates another level for the realm of the „possible‟ in IR, as opposed to
asserting the inevitability of the division of the world into the domestic and
international spheres. More importantly, Bahá‟í views are not only
concerned with deliberating philosophically upon possible ways of looking
at the world, but they also impart the will to act upon principles, which can
give meaning to action, and which can foster the unity of humanity.
Moreover, the spiritual/ethical/divine aspects of the Bahá‟í Faith can assist
in demonstrating the nature of the non-spatiality of our allegiances. The
unity of humanity, in the Bahá‟í Faith, reveres a non-spatial view of the
world, through the „spiritual‟ nature of its principles. It belongs to a non-
territorial sphere that collapses ideas of inbred division in creation. IR can,
thus, be provided with a new basis for defining human solidarity, as the
result of the mystical propensity linked to our nature, which shapes the
„reality‟ of the unity of the species.

Finally, Bahá‟í cosmopolitan views revolve around the non-statist turn in IR,
which refuse to treat the nation-state (as well as realism) as a focal point of
the discipline, and thereby provide a more ethical and spiritual starting-point
for debating cosmopolitanism; for destabilising dichotomies that feed
discrimination; and for imagining a world community that is conscious of its
oneness. In the words of Shoghi Effendi, theories, including IR theories
should constantly adjust to new global world conditions:

“The call of Bahá‟u‟lláh is primarily directed against all forms of
provincialism, all insularities and prejudices. If long-cherished ideals and
time-honoured institutions, if certain social assumptions and religious
formulae have ceased to promote the welfare of the generality of mankind,
if they no longer minister to the needs of a continually evolving humanity,
let them be swept away and relegated to the limbo of obsolescent and
forgotten doctrines. Why should these, in a world subject to the immutable
law of change and decay, be exempt from the deterioration that must needs
overtake every human institution? For legal standards, political and
economic theories are solely designed to safeguard the interests of humanity
as a whole, and not humanity to be crucified for the preservation of the
integrity of any particular law or doctrine.”343

The Bahá‟í model of world order suggests a transformation in IR, that
would reflect flexibility in its approach, the opening of new cosmopolitan
avenues, not simply because these reflect the „reality‟ of the oneness of
mankind, but also because they are of use to the welfare of humanity.
Henceforth, theories are not just there for their own sake, but as a
prescriptive means, to foster the transformation of a world community

conscious of its indivisible oneness. The way we look at the world is based
on a conception of „reality‟ that goes beyond our own minds, where human
beings remain principal actors in determining how their world can be
constantly improved upon.
