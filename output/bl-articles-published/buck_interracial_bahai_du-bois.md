The Interracial “Baha’i Movement” and the Black

Intelligentsia: The Case of W. E. B. Du Bois

> This article surveys W. E. B. Du Bois’s encounters with the Baha’i religion, from
> 1910 to 1953. Sections one and two focus on Du Bois and ‘Abdu’l-Baha (1844–
> 1921), while section three treats Du Bois’s indirect connection to the New York
> Baha’i community through Nina Du Bois’s documented affiliation with that group.
> Section four chronicles the 1937 Nashville incident involving reportedly segregated
> Baha’i meetings, and section five looks at Du Bois’s later Baha’i contacts, complet-
> ing the trajectory. Originally attracted to Baha’i teachings on interracial unity — with
> Du Bois prominently featuring ‘Abdu’l-Baha with full-page photograph in Du Bois’s
> “Men of the Month” column — Du Bois later waxed indignant, openly criticizing the
> Baha’i movement in a Pittsburgh Courier editorial. Drawing on press reports, Baha’i
> records, and archival correspondence between members of the Baha’i community
> and Du Bois, primary sources establish that Du Bois’s righteous indignation was
> based on misinformation.

In the first half of the twentieth century, the “Baha’i movement” impressed a
significant number of the black intelligentsia — including W. E. B. Du Bois
(1868–1963; Fig. 1) — who were drawn to the Baha’i principle and praxis of
“race amity” (i.e., ideal race relations).2 The Reverend Dr Martin Luther King,
Jr., said of Du Bois: “We’re going to let our children know that the only

philosophers that lived were not Plato and Aristotle, but W. E. B. Du Bois and
Alain Locke came through the universe.”3 A little-known aspect of Du Bois’s
life was his interest in the Baha’i religion, beginning in 1912 when ‘Abdu’l-
Baha (1844–1921) — eldest son and successor to the prophet-founder of the
Baha’i Faith, Baha’u’llah (1817–1892) — came to America. These two intel-
lectual giants — the black “Plato and Aristotle” — while having convergent
interests, had divergent responses: Locke joined the Baha’i religion in 1918,
while Du Bois, in 1937, publicly criticized a Baha’i policy (rarely, if ever,
implemented) of temporarily allowing, in the Jim Crow South, separate meet-
ings of whites and blacks interested in the Baha’i principles of “race amity,”
with the ultimate goal of permanently and fully uniting these two groups within
the Baha’i community, in keeping with the explicit Baha’i goals of fostering
interracial harmony, including the encouragement of interracial marriage.

In 1910, Louis G. Gregory (1874–1951), an African American lawyer from
Washington, DC, sent W. E. B. Du Bois a book on the Baha’i religion.4 In 1911,
Du Bois may have seen the Baha’i presentation at the First Universal Races
Congress (London, July 1911), where Du Bois was a delegate, speaking on
“The Negro Race in the United States of America,”5 as was the “Bahai Assem-
bly, Washington,”6 with a presentation, “The Bahai Movement,” that included
a tablet by ‘Abdu’l-Baha.7 “I remember Abdul Baha of Persia,” Du Bois
recalled. “He visited me personally in New York in 1912.”8

In the June 1912 issue of The Crisis, Du Bois wrote of “the calm sweet
universalism of Abdul Baha” when the latter spoke at the commencement of
the Fourth Annual Conference of the National Association for the Advance-
ment of Colored People (NAACP) in Chicago: “As opening and climax to
this remarkable gathering came a speech of Abdul Baha and a farewell from
Julius Rosenwald. Small wonder that a thousand disappointed people were
unable to get even standing room in the hall.”9 Thereafter Du Bois continued
to have significant Baha’i contacts: “Mr. DuBois himself knew much about
the Baha’i Faith and was acquainted with its American leaders; in fact,
his wife was a member of the Baha’i community for some time.”10 In a
letter from W. E. B. Du Bois to Miriam Haney, 25 February 1914, Du Bois
noted his profound regard for ‘Abdu’l-Baha:

> I thank you very much for your kind words of February nineteenth. I am afraid I do
> not believe much in Divine Revelations, as they are usually called. I have great
> respect for Abdul-Baha and I should be very glad to see something of you and Mr.

Haney when I come to Washington.11

In 1931, Du Bois wrote to Coralie Franklin Cook (1861–1942) — Howard
University professor, a founder of the National Association of Colored Women,
committed suffragist, and erstwhile member of the Washington, DC Baha’i
community12 — whose photograph Du Bois featured on page 24 of the Novem-
ber 1917 issue of The Crisis. On 27 February 1932, Du Bois spoke at the
“Interracial Day” banquet that the Baha’is hosted in honor of the NAACP and

the National Urban League.13 In 1932, Loulie Mathews was noted as the
“donor of the DuBois literary prize”14 of 1,000 dollars.15 In 1935, fellow black
communist sympathizer, George Streator, remarked on how Du Bois’s views
on violence resonated with Baha’i ideals: “In writing about violence, you write
like an apostle of Abdul Bahia [sic].”16 In 1936, Du Bois published a feature
article in the July 1936 issue of The Crisis, “The World Issue of Race” by
Horace Holley.17 Other Baha’i contacts may be referenced.18 A search of the W.
E. B. Du Bois Papers reveals some forty-seven results when “Bahai” is
searched, and twenty-eight results when “Baha’i” is queried.

Relations remained cordial, and Du Bois’s interest in the Baha’i movement
continued, until an unfortunate misunderstanding developed regarding Baha’i
gatherings “at the meeting of the National Spiritual Assembly of the Baha’is of
the U.S. and Canada, held in Nashville, Tennessee January 10–12, 1937.”19

Du Bois Features ‘Abdu’l-Baha among the “Men of the Month”
‘Abdu’l-Baha came to America in 1912 (see image on frontispiece; p. 463). He
spent 239 days in the United States and Canada, from his arrival on 11 April
1912 to his departure on 5 December 1912. Du Bois was deeply impressed by
‘Abdu’l-Baha.

After spending his first days in New York, on his tenth day in America —
Saturday 20 April — ‘Abdu’l-Baha arrived in Washington, DC and stayed until
Sunday 28 April. Toward the end of his visit, the Washington Bee, one of the
city newspapers, published a story that read, in part:

> Its [the Baha’i Faith’s] white devotees, even in this prejudice-ridden community, refuse
> to draw the color line. The informal meetings, held frequently in the fashionable
> mansions of the cultured society in Sheridan Circle, Dupont Circle, Connecticut and
> Massachusetts avenues, have been open to Negroes on terms of absolute equality.20

On Tuesday morning, 23 April, ‘Abdu’l-Baha spoke in Rankin Chapel at
Howard University. Well over 1,000 faculty, administrators, students, and
guests crowded the relatively small space of this modest chapel to hear him
speak. This is how he opened his talk:

> Today I am most happy, for I see here a gathering of the servants of God. I see white
> and black sitting together. There are no whites and blacks before God. All colors are
> one, and that is the color of servitude to God. Scent and color are not important. The
> heart is important. If the heart is pure, white or black or any color makes no
> difference. God does not look at colors; He looks at the hearts.21

Here, ‘Abdu’l-Baha stressed character over characteristics. He expressed his
genuine delight that the meeting itself was interracial — an attitude expressed
in poetic eloquence the very next night. ‘Abdu’l-Baha remarked:

> Before I arrived, I felt too tired to speak at this meeting. But at the sight of such
> genuine love and attraction between the white and the black friends (ulfat va injizab
> ah.ibba-yi siyah va sifid), I was so moved that I spoke with great love and likened
> (tashbih namudam) this union of different colored races (ittihad-i alvan-i mukhtali-
> fah) to a string of gleaming pearls and rubies (la’ali va yaqut).22

‘Abdu’l-Baha concluded his address prophetically: “When the racial elements
of the American nation unite in actual fellowship and accord, the lights of
the oneness of humanity will shine . . . This is the sign of the ‘Most Great
Peace’.”23 ‘Abdu’l-Baha’s most influential rhetorical strategy in promoting
racial uplift and ideal race relations was his likening of people of African
descent to the “pupil of the eye.” Significantly, ‘Abdu’l-Baha ascribed this
metaphor to his father, Baha’u’llah: “Baha’u’llah once compared the colored
people to the black pupil of the eye surrounded by the white. In this black pupil
is seen the reflection of that which is before it, and through it the light of the
spirit shineth forth.”24

As editor of The Crisis, Du Bois ran a series called “Men of the Month.” This
column regularly featured African American men (and women) of interest. In
a remarkable departure from this practice, Du Bois devoted the first part of the
May 1912 column to ‘Abdu’l-Baha.25 Guy Mount has drawn attention to the
extraordinary attention that Du Bois lavished on ‘Abdu’l-Baha in the May 1912
issue of The Crisis.26

On 4 May 1912, The Chicago Defender reported that the Baha’i leader,
‘Abdu’l-Baha, addressed the NAACP delegates twice.27 In the June 1912 issue,

Du Bois published one of ‘Abdu’l-Baha’s speeches presented at the Fourth
Annual Conference of the NAACP.28

After ‘Abdu’l-Baha’s death on 28 November 1921, Du Bois wrote: “Two
men sit high before the world today — Eugene Debs and Abdul Baha. One is
free of chains which should never have bound him — the other [‘Abdu’l-Baha]
of Life which he tried to free of race and national prejudice.”29 Here, Du Bois’s
profound respect for ‘Abdu’l-Baha is still in evidence.

Historians of early American Baha’i history — notably Robert Stockman and
Gayle Morrison — have consistently stated that Du Bois’s first wife, Nina
Gomer Du Bois (1871–1950; Fig. 2), was a Baha’i.30 Nina Du Bois’s name
appears on the New York Baha’i membership lists for 1937 to 1940. The 1937
list reads: “DUBOIS, Miss Nina[,] 210 West 150 St[.,] New York, N.Y.”; 1938:
“DuBois, Miss Nina[,] 210 West 150 St[.,] New York, N.Y.”; 1939: “DuBois,
Nina[,] 210 W. I50 [sic] St., N.Y.C.”; but the 1940 list (on a separate sheet
entitled “registered and on file but inactive”) reads: “DuBois, Nina[,] Will not
affiliate.”31 This latter fact is confirmed by Louis Gregory who, in his letter
dated 29 March 1943 to Du Bois, refers to a letter that Du Bois evidently had
written “to Mrs. Geo. R. True [Peggy True] of Grosse Pointe, Mich., stating
why Mrs. Du Bois did not unite with the Baha’i Faith.”32 There is little doubt
that Nina Du Bois’s withdrawal from the New York Baha’i community, if
indeed she was formally accounted a member, was primarily due to W. E. B. Du
Bois’s critical stance in 1937.

Du Bois himself, however, indicates that his first wife never actually affili-
ated with the Baha’i community, although she seriously considered doing so, as
he explains in several letters, such as this one:

> I am acquainted with the Bahai Movement. I met personally Abdul Baha’i [sic] when
> he was in America and he was a guest speaker to the organization, the National
> Association for the Advancement of Colored People . . . I had great respect for him
> and for his movement. Indeed later my wife . . . after having attended the Bahai
> meetings in New York for sometime determined to join the movement . . . At the
> meeting of the organization in Tennessee, white leaders . . . held a meeting of the
> organization to which Negroes were not invited . . . As a result . . . Mrs. Du Bois
> refused to join. I think they [these “facts”] will explain why my interest in the Bahai
> movement is not as great as it was.33

Evidently, it was Nina Du Bois herself who brought the Nashville incident, and
its supporting policy, to her husband’s attention:

> Enclosed is an article from the Baha’i News, Teaching in the Southern States. Mrs.
> Trotman called my attention to it and is very much upset about it. She says of course
> we cannot go to Green Acre. A group is going to do something about it. This stand
> came out of the meeting in Nashville last March but is just being given out to the
> world. Mrs. Trotman knew something of it but did not think the Guardian would
> approve. She wants you to write a letter but not until you have all the facts relative to
> the case.34

THE    “BAHA’I       M OV E M E N T ” A N D W . E . B . D U B O I S                  549

Two dates appear to be conflated here: the letter on behalf of Shoghi Effendi,
published June 1937, and the Nashville meetings that ignited the controversy,
held on 10–12 January 1937. The March 1937 Nashville event, in which
evidence suggests that Alain Locke may have been present (and would pre-
dictably have been invited to speak) appears to have attracted no criticism.35

What were the “facts” surrounding the 1937 Nashville controversy, and what
about the policy announced in the June 1937 Baha’i News?

The Nashville Incident
In his Pittsburgh Courier column, “Forum of Fact and Opinion: The Fall of the
Baha’i,” published on 30 October 1937, W. E. B. Du Bois expressed righteous
indignation over an allegedly segregated Baha’i meeting held in the Hermitage
Hotel in Nashville on 11 January 1937, and to an interim policy by Shoghi
Effendi, Guardian of the Baha’i Faith from 1921 to 1957, allowing, under
certain circumstances, teaching to take place among whites and blacks sepa-
rately until it was possible to ascertain each individual’s complete acceptance
of the Baha’i ideal of interracial harmony:

> I remember Abdul Baha of Persia. He visited me personally in New York in 1912. He
> spoke to colored folk at Chicago that summer and since: “His Holiness, Baha’o’llah,
> has proclaimed to the world the Oneness of the world of humanity . . . The various
> colors of human kind lend a harmony and beauty to the whole . . . Therefore all must
> associate with one another, even as flowers consort harmoniously together in a given
> garden.” It seemed even then too fine a vision to be true of any ethic with an American
> following; and it was . . . Only the Baha’i were left, and last year at their meeting in
> Nashville they succumbed. For the first time they held a public meeting in the
> Hermitage Hotel to which no Negroes, not even members, were invited; and they
> voted for color segregation at future meetings. Not only this but they put the question
> to the present Guardian, Shoghi Effendi. How the matter was presented to him is the
> secret of certain American leaders. But he answered: “Your Assembly’s suggestion
> that Baha’i public meetings should henceforth be conducted separately for whites and
> colored and that study classes resulting from such meetings should likewise be
> conducted separately until individuals of both races are truly confirmed believers, is
> splendid, as it will undoubtedly help in removing the misunderstandings and
> obstacles that have thus far stood in the way of the expansion of the Faith in Southern
> States.”36

Du Bois’s column was brought to the attention of the National Spiritual
Assembly of the Baha’is of the United States and Canada by Alice N. Parker,
Pittsburgh, in a letter dated 1 November 1937. She had contacted one of the
Pittsburgh Courier editors: “I have also talked to one of the editors — Mr.
Prentiss — explaining the difference between meetings for Bahais and Bahai
‘public’ meetings for non-Bahais and he asked me to get an answer to DuBois

and said he would take pleasure in publishing it.”37 Horace Holley, National
Spiritual Assembly secretary, published a detailed rebuttal that appeared in a
subsequent issue of the Pittsburgh Courier.38

The information on which Du Bois had relied was, according to Horace
Holley’s eyewitness account (see his 9 July 1937 letter quoted later in the
present article), contrary to fact. Six meetings were held in January 1937; three
were public, and three private. The first was at Fisk University on Sunday 10
January 1937 (public); the second was a reception at the Fisk University
president’s home on Sunday 10 January 1937 (private); the third was a Baha’i
devotional/administrative meeting at the home of Mrs Johnson (private); the
fourth was at the Hermitage Hotel on Monday 11 January 1937 (public); the
fifth was at the Hermitage Hotel on Tuesday 12 January 1937 (public); and
the sixth was a home meeting with some twenty persons, the only meeting
confined to white persons (private).39 These meetings, public and private, were
deemed a success.40

So far as the present writer can tell, it was the first Hermitage Hotel meeting
on Monday 11 January 1937 to which Trotman objected most strenuously. In
her letter to Shoghi Effendi of 21 January 1937, shortly after the incident,
Trotman reported that there were “three meetings held” in Nashville: “A
Monday evening meeting, a Tuesday evening meeting and a Sunday afternoon
meeting.” “Separate invitations were sent” in advance of each meeting. What
raised Trotman’s ire most was the Monday meeting: “The Monday evening
invitation was sent to white people only and great care was exercised that not
one fell in to [sic] the hands of any body [sic] of the colored group.” If true
(arguendo), this would have been pursuant to Shoghi Effendi’s policy of
holding a racially separate meeting if circumstances prevented an integrated
meeting in the Jim Crow South.

Although Tuesday’s event was admittedly integrated (notwithstanding the
hotel’s whites-only policy), Trotman was still critical: “The Tuesday eve. [sic]
meeting, a few colored people were invited between fifteen and twenty” so that
(in the words of someone she quoted) there would not be “ ‘too many colored
people there’.”41 While her allegations regarding the Monday meeting were
disputed by Holley and arguably by Marion Little, who helped organize these
events (see her 15 November 1937 letter, infra), Trotman’s characterization of
the Tuesday meeting appears to be corroborated so far as the Baha’is suc-
ceeded, on the very next night, in persuading the Hermitage Hotel to make an

exception to its whites-only policy: an extraordinary achievement in itself and
consistent with the artful and adroit Baha’i subterfuge of Jim Crowism, in
breaking the racial barrier, but not the racial law.

The primary problem that the Baha’i organizers faced was that the Hermit-
age Hotel was racially exclusive. Although intended primarily for whites at that
particular time and notwithstanding the hotel’s policy, the public Baha’i meet-
ings, in fact, were attended by several blacks, “whose welcome had been
assured by the hotel management before the room was reserved,” writes Mor-
rison. “This was an unexampled concession to the Baha’is.”42 But the hotel
management’s permission was granted on condition that not “too many” blacks
would be present. According to Albert James, a young African American
(introduced to the Baha’i teachings by Louis Gregory) member of the Nash-
ville Baha’is at that time, such approval “was at least a foot in the door” in
gradually overcoming segregation.43

Given the volatile racialized nature of the Jim Crow South at that time, the
National Spiritual Assembly of the Baha’is of the United States and Canada
endorsed the pragmatic wisdom of holding, as prudence dictated, racially
separate meetings and study classes in the South, in order to make the Baha’i
teachings accessible to both races. The National Spiritual Assembly sought
Shoghi Effendi’s approval, which he gave in a letter dated 22 March 1937, as
a practical strategy for reaching “the two races in the South without the
slightest discrimination.”44 There was to be no racial segregation among
declared Baha’is, of course; the segregated meetings were purely a temporary
measure — a policy strictly limited to those who were not yet “truly confirmed
believers,”45 with full integration as the ultimate goal, pursuant to the core
Baha’i principle of the oneness of humankind.46

Horace Holley, writing on behalf of the National Spiritual Assembly of the
Baha’is of the United States and Canada, provides an eyewitness account in his
letter dated 9 July 1937 to Mrs Minta B. Trotman of Brooklyn, a Baha’i who
was so upset by what she had heard about the allegedly segregated meetings
that she also wrote to Shoghi Effendi.47 Holley writes, in part:

Holley’s letter to the editor of the Pittsburgh Courier (which, evidently, was
co-authored by Mountford Mills)49 was sent through Alice Parker. In his reply
to Parker, Holley suspected that it was a Baha’i who gave Du Bois this
misinformation: “There is, however, one very troubling aspect of the matter,
and that is, how did Dr. DuBois arrive at his conclusion without instigation from
some believer? The friends in Nashville have been perfectly satisfied, because
the teaching work was carried on in consultation with the local assembly
(mostly colored).”50 There is some evidence that “DuBois has in all probability
been approached by some disaffected Baha’i.”51 This may have been Ludmila
Bechtold in New York.52 Du Bois himself wrote: “Meantime there arose within
the Baha’i Movement a tendency to blame Mrs. Bechtold for originally reveal-
ing the Jim Crow policy at Nashville, coupled with an effort to deny that
anything untoward took place.”53 To her credit, perhaps, Bechtold wrote to Du
Bois, expressing her disappointment over his Pittsburgh Courier column. She
was an eyewitness, having “attended because I have friends in Nashville, at Fisk
University and also because of the Baha’i aspect.”54 Bechtold, however, does not
offer any specifics as to the meetings themselves. Indeed, it appears, based on
a survey of the relevant archival documents in the W. E. B. Du Bois Papers, that
the most vocal critic was Minta B. Trotman of Brooklyn.55

On behalf of the National Spiritual Assembly, Horace Holley published a
rebuttal that appeared in a subsequent issue of the Courier but which, because
of its length, was run only in the newspaper’s Southern states edition.56 The
typescript version of Horace Holley’s letter, dated 3 November 1937, to the
editor of the Pittsburgh Courier, reads, in part:

Morrison mentions a letter by Marion Little, who knew Du Bois and who had
helped organize the Nashville meetings. In her letter to him dated 15 November
1937, Little provides a firsthand, eyewitness account of the Nashville meet-
ings.58 A few excerpts will give the reader a fair impression of Marion Little’s
statement of the facts:

With the possible exception of the Monday 11 January 1937 event, which
Trotman claimed was reserved for whites only, this eyewitness account is
significant in setting the facts straight (and for pointing out the fact that “the
majority of these members are of your race”); but this does not seem to have
swayed Du Bois in the least. He appears to have been more critical of the policy
by Shoghi Effendi that he cited. In his reply of 1 December 1937, Du Bois
explains:

> I did not comment on the new Baha’i race attitude with pleasure but rather with
> sorrow. I have your letter and I have talked with Mr. Gregory. You and Mr. Gregory
> disagree on one point. Mr. Gregory admits that there was a meeting of the Baha’i at

> have, therefore, induced Shoghi Effendi openly to draw this line. I think as I have said
> before that this is nothing less than a shame for this otherwise promising movement.61

In his letter dated 17 December 1937, Du Bois added: “If this is not a new
departure for the Baha’i, why was it necessary to state it in the year 1937 of all
critical years?”62 Du Bois points out the discrepancy between Marion Little’s
and Louis Gregory’s reports of the Hermitage Hotel meetings. Little said that
both races were invited, while Gregory said that blacks were not. This only
added to the confusion as to what really happened, but that is practically beside
the point. Du Bois takes issue with what he describes as a public change in
policy by no less than Shoghi Effendi that, in the South, the Baha’is should
“draw the color line.” This mischaracterizes the policy completely. The colour
line had already been drawn in the South.

Baha’is were trying their best to erase the colour line through a pragmatic
principle of gradualism. The policy of holding completely integrated meetings
among confirmed Baha’is remained unchanged. The only alteration of this
policy was, as a temporary measure, to hold racially separate public meetings
in a Jim Crow society where the races were already separate. By meeting

separately, the intent was to pragmatically work within the context of the colour
line, but with the ultimate aim of obliterating it. It was a grand subterfuge of the
“separate but equal” status quo, in order to gradually transform it from within.
This temporary measure was by no means a reversal of Baha’i policy; rather,
it was a practical tactic aimed at erasing the colour line over time. Although he
quoted Shoghi Effendi accurately,63 Du Bois cited Shoghi Effendi incom-
pletely, as Morrison is quick to point out: “Dr. DuBois went on to quote — with
virtually complete accuracy — Shoghi Effendi’s approval of the policy but not
his reminder that the goal must be ‘ultimate fusion of the two races’ once the
individuals became Baha’is.”64 This omission is telling.

Louis Gregory, in his letter dated 29 March 1943 to Du Bois, explained the
wisdom behind holding racially separate introductory meetings and study
groups:

> like your own, from a place remote from the scene, I was also of the opinion that the

Du Bois definitively states his position on the Nashville controversy in a letter
dated 8 January 1952.68 Du Bois explains that he received “letters which
passed between Mrs. Minta B. Trotman of Brooklyn, and Shoghi Effendi, Mr.
Horace Holley, Mrs. M. P. Smyth, Mrs. Johnson, Mrs. Lulie [sic, read:
‘Louli’] Mathews and myself,” provided by “the surviving daughter, from
whom I have received this correspondence,” (i.e., the wife of “Probyn Thomp-
son, in Brooklyn.”).69

The following “Memo to Mr. Hautz” suggests that Minta B. Trotman, born
in Nashville and who was an African American Baha’i, was herself disaffected
by what she was told regarding the Nashville incident, and was evidently
critical of Shoghi Effendi’s interim Baha’i policy in force at that time:

> Mrs. Trotman is now dead. I knew her from 1888 until her death. She was born in
> Nashville of well-to-do parents . . . She was educated at Fisk University . . . [T]he
> surviving daughter, from whom I’ve received this correspondence, was a teacher in the

> Liberia; Mrs. Bibb, and several other colored women of standing. Through her they
> were attracted to the Baha’i Movement, and planned to join. Mrs. Trotman did join, but
> I think none of the others. They were repelled by the occurrences at the meeting of the
> National Spiritual Assembly of the Baha’is of the U.S. and Canada, held in Nashville,
> Tenn. January 10–12, 1937 . . . I finally thought it was time for me to take a hand in the
> controversy, and in my column which I was then writing for the Pittsburgh Courier[,]
> I wrote a statement on “The Fall of the Baha’i” . . . I do not know whether anything
> further took place with regard to this matter. I do know that Mrs. Du Bois and Mrs.

Curtis refused to join the Movement and that I, personally, lost interest.70

Note that the letters, which would have contained specific factual information
regarding the events in question, were not seen by Du Bois (“I do not have
copies of these letters”). In a letter dated 12 May 1938 to Minta B. Trotman,
Loulie A. Mathews wrote that she herself personally investigated the incident,
and found that Trotman was completely misinformed:

> I went to Nashville as I told you I should. There you will find no one to uphold your
> view. They are all frightfully down on Mrs. Bechtold, whom they feel made all the
> trouble and not any one [sic] else. They are in perfect harmony and have just elected
> a board of five Colored and four White people to serve during the coming year, so you
> see I cannot find one item to corroborate this sad, most sad story. It is sadder still to
> think that after years of warm friendship with you, with Dr. Du Bois, his wife, with
> Mrs. Bibb that someone, a stranger should come into my life and sweep away dear,
> precious friends.71

That Du Bois got the facts wrong does not end the inquiry. There’s still the
question of the interim policy of Shoghi Effendi. That policy, which Du Bois
accurately quoted in his column, was pursuant to a previous policy in 1936,
which was as follows:

> The holding of public meetings in that city should be avoided only in case it would
> lead to grave and very serious results. Slight local criticisms and unpopularity should
> not act as deterrent. The issue should be met squarely and courageously, and an effort
> should be made to attract at first the most cultured element among the colored, and

> recognized Baha’i centers.72

Note that this strategy was “attract at first the most cultured element among the
colored” and then, through their influence, reach the wider population of both
races. It should also be understood that the meetings at Fisk University and the
Hermitage Hotel were, according to Horace Holley, publicly advertised, open
to all, and were racially integrated.

Had he been in possession of the correct facts, Du Bois still could have taken
umbrage over the one meeting that was “confined to white persons” simply
because it was in a private home, as Horace Holley explained: “One of the
evenings we accepted an invitation to meet a group of some twenty persons in
a private home, where the Message [sic] was clearly explained, and this
meeting was the only one confined to white persons.”73

Ironically, in 1927 Du Bois had even conceded that the idea of a separate
Negro state was “feasible.”74 In the January 1934 issue of The Crisis, Du Bois
published his fateful editorial, “Segregation,” advocating “nondiscriminatory
segregation”75 as a pragmatic solution to social and economic problems among
African Americans, in which he envisioned the development of black culture
within white America, including voluntary residential segregation. This
directly contradicted the NAACP core ideology of integration, igniting a fiery
debate between Du Bois and Walter White that ended in Du Bois’s resignation
as editor of The Crisis and from the NAACP itself in May 1934.76

By contrast, Shoghi Effendi’s interim policy was to pragmatically avoid spark-
ing harmful controversy in a social climate that greatly frowned on anything that
would disturb the Jim Crow status quo. His approach was gradualist and quietist
— indeed, an adroit disguised acceptance of the Jim Crow status quo — yet
without compromise to the bedrock Baha’i principle of “race amity.”

Conclusion
The first page of the invitation to (and programme of) the 10 January 1937
public meeting at Fisk University reads: “You are cordially invited to attend a
public meeting of the National Spiritual Assembly of the Baha’is of the United
States and Canada on the need of a new world order[,] Sunday January Tenth

3:30 P. M.[,] Fisk University Nashville[.] No admission charge or collections
taken[.]”77 Two lectures were presented: “The Implications of a World Faith”
and “Order for a Troubled World,” although no speakers are identified. Suffice
it to say that, with the venue being a historically black university, this public
meeting was integrated. This is confirmed by Minta B. Trotman herself, who
wrote: “I think I state a fact when I say that only the meeting at Fisk University
was free to all.”78 As previously mentioned, Trotman acknowledged that, at the
“Tuesday eve. [sic] meeting,” indeed “a few colored people were invited
between fifteen and twenty.” Trotman did not appreciate the significance of the
fact that the Baha’is succeeded in persuading the Hermitage Hotel to make an
exception to its whites-only policy on Tuesday January 12 1937 (and possibly
on the night before as well).

This leaves only the Monday January 11 1937 meeting in question, exclud-
ing the meeting of “some twenty persons in a private home” which, according
to Horace Holley, “was the only one confined to white persons.” Trotman
evidently did not know about this private meeting; but even if she had, she was
concerned only with racially separate public Baha’i meetings, not with private:
“To talk to small groups of people in private homes and try to interest them in
the fundamental principles of the Baha’i Faith is an entirely different matter to
having a large meeting at a hotel and sending invitations to one group and
withholding them from another.”79 Contrary to Trotman’s hearsay evidence,
Holley, an eyewitness participant, is quite definite in stating, as previously
recounted, that the “meetings held at Hermitage Hotel on Monday and Tuesday
evenings were entirely public” and were “advertised in the press in exactly the
same way as the meeting at Fisk” resulting in publicity in print and by radio. If
the advertisements for the Hermitage Hotel meetings were ever to be found,
such evidence would corroborate Holley’s eyewitness account over Trotman’s
hearsay allegations. The only possible way to reconcile Trotman’s and Holley’s
accounts is if Trotman mistook the meeting of “some twenty persons” in a
private home one evening with the allegedly whites-only meeting at the Her-
mitage Hotel on 11 January.

The present writer did not succeed in locating an invitation to the public
meetings held at the Hermitage Hotel on 11 and 12 January 1937. Notwith-
standing, there is good evidence that, at no time, was there ever a public Baha’i
event advertised with the least hint of segregation, as Louis Gregory noted on
13 December 1937: “I spoke to one of the members of the N.S.A. before
leaving New York and he assured me that there was not contemplated any plan
for advertized [sic] meetings which all races could not attend.” Gregory, who

had spent a week at Atlanta University, further wrote: “Dr. Du Bois gave me a
very friendly and cordial welcome upon my arrival.” When Gregory broached
certain issues not explicitly described (but which almost certainly referred to
the January 1937 Nashville incident), however, Du Bois was “rather annoyed
than pleased.”80 Based on this and other supporting evidence, Du Bois did not
swerve from his adamantine criticism of Baha’i policy. Ironically, there is
absolutely no evidence the present writer could find that any public Baha’i
meeting was segregated. There is no way to say to what extent the policy was
implemented, with discretion, in private meetings.

As such it is the present writer’s conclusion that Shoghi Effendi’s temporary
policy, at which Du Bois took such public umbrage, was never implemented;
this was a fleeting “paper policy” — at least insofar as public Baha’i events
were concerned — that was effectively abandoned. In any case, Shoghi Effen-
di’s responses to Minta Trotman’s letters are not presently known to the
author.81 The author is further of the opinion that Trotman’s allegations regard-
ing the Hermitage Hotel meetings were entirely without foundation: because
Minta was a close friend, it was Nina Du Bois who brought these allegations to
W. E. B. Du Bois’s attention, and passed on Trotman’s request that he publish
“a letter but not until you have all the facts relative to the case.”82 This request
was ultimately realized in the “Fall of the Baha’i” column that appeared in the
30 October 1937 issue of the Pittsburgh Courier, but, unfortunately, was not
based on all of the facts.

In a letter dated 15 November 1948, Du Bois disavowed belief in any world
religion, including the “Baha’i faith”:

> I do not believe in the existence and rulership of the one God of the Jews. I do not
> believe in the miraculous birth and the miracles of the Christ of the Christians; I do
> not believe in many of the tenets of Mohammedanism and Buddhism; and frankly I
> do not believe that the Guardian of the Baha’i faith has any supernatural knowledge.83

Yet, in 1953, Du Bois planned to attend an international Baha’i conference in
India: “We wish in October, 1953, to attend the Intercontinental Conference of
the Bahai Faith to be held in New Delhi, India.”84 But Du Bois was denied a
passport, preventing his attending.

Clearly the Nashville controversy alienated W. E. B. Du Bois and his first
wife, Nina Du Bois, from the “Baha’i Movement.” Yet it is equally patent that

W. E. B. and Nina Du Bois’s initial interest in the Baha’i religion illustrates
how the Baha’i teachings effectively reached the black intelligentsia, even if
the movement for interracial harmony during the Jim Crow era “seemed even
then too fine a vision to be true of any ethic with an American following.”85
What Du Bois failed to appreciate was that the rationale behind the Baha’i
policy was pragmatically aimed at subverting Jim Crowism in such wise that,
as prudence dictated, the interim policy allowed “Baha’i teachers” to “make
their first contacts with each race separately, and as individuals are brought to
the point of accepting the principle of the oneness of mankind they will be
received into the Baha’i community where no prejudice or discrimination is
permitted to exist.”86

Alain Locke (Fig. 3), a highly respected member of the Baha’i community, had
visited the Nashville Baha’is:

> A letter from one of the Nashville C. [City] [Baha’i] friends, received yesterday,
> assures that that [sic] community is in the greatest state of love, confidence &
> harmony, have been blessed with inspiring visits from distinguished Baha’is, among
> them Prof. Locke of Howard University and that during the recent special activities
> two “mixed” meetings were held at the Hermitage Hotel[.] This good news, I am sure
> will be the cause of joy to you as it is to me.87

While it is quite possible that Locke was present at one or both of the 11 to 12
January 1937 Hermitage Hotel meetings, it seems more likely that Locke had
attended the March 1937 meeting in the very same venue. Absent further facts,
it is impossible to say; but this much can be said: Gregory’s postcard simply
could not be accounted for if there had been a segregation policy or problem
within the Nashville Baha’i community.

As splendid exceptions to the Jim Crow nightmare, the Baha’i interracial
initiatives, with their precocious social ethic, prefigured Dr Martin Luther
King, Jr’s “I have a dream” vision of America and his “world house” global
vision. Sadly, these ennobling efforts did not have a lasting impact, except
insofar as their memory became inspirational for future cycles of Baha’i
interracial endeavours. Yet another inhibiting factor was the centrality and
dominance of the independent black churches that served as beacon and
bastion for their respective communities. A further factor was the relative
foreignness of a “transplanted” religion, one that had not yet been fully under-
stood nor assimilated into the host culture.

A sister publication sheds light on the relationship of two other giants of the
black intelligentsia — Robert S. Abbott and Alain Leroy Locke — to the Baha’i
Faith, both of whom embraced the new religion and became its most notable
African American adherents.88 While somewhat reticent over his Baha’i affili-
ation in his immediate professional circles, and in his “on stage” performances
as a public intellectual, Locke publicly championed what are quintessentially
both core Baha’i and universal values: “On the one hand there is the possibility,”
Locke wrote to the New York Times in 1931, “of a fine collaboration spiritually
between these two groups [black and white] with their complementary traits and
qualities. They have great spiritual need, the one of the other, if they will so see
it.”89 Locke stated quite the same in The Negro in America (1933):

> If they will but see it, because of their complementary qualities, the two racial groups
> have great spiritual need, one of the other. It would truly be significant in the history

Times excerpted the paper in its article.

Among contemporary black intellectuals, Cornel West, Class of 1943 Univer-
sity Professor in the Center for African American Studies — who in stature and
influence may be compared with W. E. B. Du Bois — has recently expressed
his admiration of the Baha’i race amity efforts:

> When you talk about race and the legacy of white supremacy, there’s no doubt that
> when the history is written, the true history is written, the history of this country, the
> Baha’i Faith will be one of the leaven in the American loaf that allowed the demo-

> that there is a real sense in which a Christian like myself is profoundly humbled
> before Baha’i brothers and sisters and the Dizzy Gillespie’s and the Alain Locke’s
> and so forth.91

History will tell whether Cornel West’s prediction will come true; that is, if a
revisionist history, at long last, chronicles the fact that the Baha’i “race amity”
efforts audaciously sought to overcome Jim Crowism by openly preaching, and
putting into practice, interracial harmony, thereby attracting the interest of the
black intelligentsia.

91\. In the same video, Cornel West also states: “I have come to have a profound admiration for
brothers and sisters of the Baha’i Faith. I’ve actually met Dizzy Gillespie and he, of course, one of
the great artists of the 20th century, was of Baha’i Faith, and talked over and over again about what
it meant to him. Alain Locke, of course, probably one of the greatest philosophic minds of the
middle part of the 20th century, was also of Baha’i Faith, the first Black Rhodes scholar and
chairman of the philosophy department at Howard University, for over 42 years. What I’ve always
been taken by is the very genuine universalism of the Baha’i Faith, one of the first religious groups
to really hit racism and white supremacy head on, decades ago. By decades, I mean many decades
ago and remain consistent about it.” See “Cornel West Praises Work of Baha’is in Establish-
ing Racial Unity,” http://www.bahai.us/2012/02/01/cornel-west-praises-work-of-baha’is-in-
