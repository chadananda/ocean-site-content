at the Beurs van Berlage, Amsterdam.

Clerically-led Shiism in Iraq is undergoing a reformation, in which leading
figures are attempting to reconcile the principles of Islam with those of the
Enlightenment. This encounter between the two systems is hardly new, and
the contradictions are hardly easy to work out. Yet the current attempt by
ayatollahs to engage with the ideals of Jean-Jacques Rousseau is among the
more thorough-going and institutionally promising in modern history. Here
we will look at the clerical discourse on popular sovereignty and elections
during the first eighteen months after the fall of Saddam.

What drove the Iraqi Shiite clerical leadership to champion elections and
popular sovereignty in post-Baathist Iraq? Was this stance wholly new in that
tradition, or were there precedents? Was the American administration help-
ful to them in developing this vision, or did it attempt to stand in its way?
How did their stance articulate with popular politics in the country, during a
time of both military and administrative occupation by the Americans? How
did these thinkers reconcile the secular implications of popular sovereignty
(after all the people are free to choose to be irreligious) with their own dedica-
tion to establishing an Islamic state in Iraq, ruled by Islamic law?

Notions of the basis of political and religious authority have changed con-
siderably within the Twelver Shiite tradition. They hold that after the death
of the Prophet Muhammad, legitimate authority should have passed to his
son-in-law, Ali b. Abi Talib, and thence to a line of his descendants. With the
exception of Ali himself, these “Imams” or divinely appointed leaders never
actually came to power, though they exerted spiritual influence over their
followers. That line of Imams ended with the Twelfth Imam, who is said to
have vanished into a mystical realm in CE 873, from which he will someday
return. The solution to the problem of legitimate authority in the absence
of the Prophet Muhammad was now itself problematic, since there were no
more Imams. Shiites dealt in various ways with the problem of who should

an Islamic republic, but not one necessarily ruled by clerics.5 The republic
was to implement Islamic canon law (sharia), and would have a consultative
council (shura). These are stock elements in any Islamist political program of
the twentieth century. It is seldom made clear by thinkers such as Muham-
mad Baqir al-Sadr (or by his contemporaries, such as Abu al-Ala’ al-Mawdudi
of the Jama’at-i Islami in Pakistan or Muhammad al-Hudaybi of the Muslim
Brotherhood in Egypt) how the “consultative council” comes into being or
to whom it is responsible, apart from God. That is, the invocation of the
consultative element did not necessarily imply parliamentary democracy for
al-Sadr. A Leninist style democratic centralism would have fit the “consulta-
tive council” language just as well. Still, a parliamentary system with open
elections would not be incompatible with al-Sadr’s vision in any obvious way,
in contrast to the thinking of Khomeini, which was actively hostile to the
notion of popular sovereignty.

Although he was a quietist earlier in his career, Grand Ayatollah Ali Husay-
ni Sistani emerged in the twenty-first century as among the more important
shapers of democracy in modern Iraq. He was born in 1930 in Mashhad,
eastern Iran. Sistani, from a clerical family, carried out his initial studies
with his father and other great clerics in the city of his birth. Around 1948
he went off for higher studies to Qom, not far from the capital of Tehran
in the north-central part of the country. There he worked with the greatest
Shiite authority of the time, Ayatollah Husayn Burujirdi. Late in 1951, the
young Sistani went to Najaf in Iraq to complete his education, and ended
up staying there the rest of his life. For the next decade, he studied with the
leading jurists of that city. To any extent that Sistani thought about political
matters, he appears to have been shaped by the ideals of the Constitutional
Revolution in early twentieth century Iran (1905-1911). In post-Saddam Iraq,
Sistani referred proudly to the role of Najaf clerics in theorizing a synthesis
of Shiite Islam and Western-style constitutionalism in 1905-1911. That experi-
ment ultimately failed, but left behind a body of thought on which clerics of
Sistani’s generation continued to draw.

In 1968 the secular, Arab nationalist Baath Party came to power in a coup.

Sistani himself adhered to the quietism of Burujirdi (d. 1961), Grand Ayatol-

wiped out, I will not let the experience of Iran be repeated in Iraq.”6

away from sects and ethnicity. This is although we call for an Islamic – not
religious – state as long as the Iraqis voluntarily and willingly support such
a state.”8 His distinction between an “Islamic” and a “religious” state is prob-
ably actually between a lay-governed regime that foregrounds Islamic canon
law and a clerically-ruled theocracy. The lay leaders of the Daªwah Party had
never liked the Khomeinist model of rule by a supreme jurisprudent. What
is remarkable here, however, is al-Maliki’s full endorsement of a universalist
version of popular sovereignty.

The Iraqi clerics in the post-Saddam period showed increasing openness
to the idea of popular sovereignty as expressed at the ballot box. On May 10,
the leader of the Supreme Council for Islamic Revolution in Iraq, Ayatollah
Muhammad Baqir al-Hakim, returned to his native country from exile in
Iran. He arrived at a time when a new American civil administrator, Paul
Bremer, had taken the reins of power. His predecessor, Jay Garner, had taken
steps toward appointing a governing council made up of Iraqi expatriate
politicians plus the Kurdish leaders, and from all accounts he hoped to move
quickly toward holding a congress in summer of 2003 that would elect an
Iraqi government, so that the Americans could swiftly depart. When Bremer
arrived, however, he set aside Garner’s plans and intimated that he would
rule Iraq single-handedly for some time, perhaps for years.

Bremer intended to follow a seven-stage plan for putting Iraq back on its
feet. One stage was to appoint a committee of Iraqis to work with Ameri-
can advisers in drafting a new permanent constitution for Iraq. Bremer
announced his intentions in early June. Muhammad Baqir al-Hakim made
this plan the center piece of the first Friday prayers sermon he preached in
Najaf, on June 6. He observed, “The United States suggests that the coalition
forces form a council, which it itself appoints. This council is to sit down,
draft a constitution and present it to the people.” He then thundered, “This
is a path that we and the authorities believe is an incorrect path.”9 Al-Hakim
went on to say that if the new Iraqi government was to function well, it
would have to be established on several key pillars. They included respect for
the will of the people as expressed at the ballot box, respect for ethnic minori-
ties via a federal system of government, and respect for Islam through the

Bremer’s way of working would be neither democratic nor Islamic.

the people. He said that the draft constitution should then be submitted to
a national referendum.

In other statements coming out of Najaf, it was clear that the high cler-
ics, including Sistani, saw governmental legitimacy as deriving from two
sources. One was the seal of approval (al-imda’) given by the grand ayatollahs
in Najaf. The other is the approval or agreement of the people through a gen-
eral election.11 In the absence of these two, the American-appointed Interim
Governing Council lacked legitimacy, according to the communiqué. This
statement recognizes two sources of legitimacy for an Iraqi government. The
dual sources of legitimacy did not imply, in the thinking of Sistani and those
around him, any sort of theocracy.

On November 15, US civil administrator Paul Bremer made a pact with the
Interim Governing Council that he himself had appointed, which called for
council-based elections in May, 2004.12 The plan had five basic stages. First,
the Interim Governing Council would craft a Basic Law allowing a transi-
tional government to be elected and operate. Second, by the spring, each of
Iraq’s 18 provinces would hold conventions made up of notables, elders and
tribal chieftains. These conventions would elect altogether over two hundred
members to an interim parliament, based on proportional representation.
This interim parliament would in turn elect a prime minister. This process
would be complete by June, 2004. Third, at that point, Mr. Bremer’s Coali-
tion Provisional Authority would hand over power to the new government
and close up shop. The US and UK military would remain in Iraq, however,
and the new government could invite other international contributors of
troops and other help. Fourth, the interim government would hold elections
for delegates to a constitutional convention to draft the new constitution,
in accordance with the fatwa or legal ruling of Grand Ayatollah Ali Sistani.
Fifth, formal elections on the basis of one person, one vote, would be held
to install a new government, to which the interim government will hand
power. This plan clearly was intended to achieve a restoration of sovereignty
to the Iraqi people without risking their voting in an anti-American govern-
ment. The Americans appear to have believed that if genuine elections were
permitted in spring of 2004 there was a risk that extreme Arab nationalists

population and the guarantee of the rights of other religions and sects.”14

Shiite leaders had other critiques of the Bremer plan. Among them was
that the electorate he envisaged, members of the municipal and provincial
councils, was a hodgepodge. IGC member Ahmad Shiyaª al-Barak, a human
rights lawyer and a leader of the Al Bu Sultan tribe of Babil province, told
al-Hayat that before elections could be held, the municipal and provincial
councils had to be reformed.15 He pointed out that some municipal councils
doubled as provincial ones (i.e. they have authority over the capital as well
as the whole province). They differed in how they were chosen, differed with
regard to how many members they had, and no standard set of regulations
specified their functions. Al-Barak was clearly concerned that if the councils
– many of them formed under watchful US eyes – were to function as the
election commissions, they could have been crucial in shaping the elector-
ate and the outcome of the polls. Therefore, their nature was the key to the
elections as the Bremer Accord envisaged them. He wanted “vast reforms” in
these councils before those elections.

Although Abd al-Mahdi, ironically enough, had earlier been the one who
assured Bremer that Grand Ayatollah Sistani accepted the outline of the plan,
either he was prevaricating or it was not fully explained to the sage of Najaf.
When the grand ayatollah understood that the Iraqi parliament was to be
elected by what Americans called “caucuses,” rather than on the basis of one
person, one vote, Sistani rejected this plan out of hand. In response to the
questions of Anthony Shadid of the Washington Post, he gave his most explicit
fatwa yet on popular sovereignty. Responding to Bremer’s council-based plan,
he said, “The instrumentality envisaged in it for electing the members of the
transitional legislature does not guarantee the formation of a parliament that
truly represents the Iraqi people. It must be changed to some other method,
which would guarantee it. And that is [direct] elections, such that the parlia-
ment would derive from the will of the Iraqis and would represent them in a
just manner and will safeguard it from any challenge to its legitimacy.”16 Sis-

reported on one such rally: “‘Yes, yes for elections!’ shouted the protesters,
a collection of students, clerics and middle-aged professionals whose ranks
swelled to more than 1,000. ‘No, no to appointment!’.”19 They said that they
had taken heart from Sistani’s call for direct elections. They also no doubt
feared that Bremer’s “caucus-based” elections would produce similar high
officials for the whole country. The Hilla demonstrations of fall 2003 showed
that the rhetoric of open elections was being taken up by the Iraqi street.
The techniques of crowd politics pioneered by the Sadr movement in post-
Saddam Iraq were to be adopted by other Shiite religious groups with great
effectiveness.

Other clerics who worked under Sistani’s penumbra, whether in religion
or politics or both, took up the discourse of the popular will. Abd al-ªAziz al-
Hakim became president of the Interim Governing Council, and in December
he visited Germany for consultations with Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder.
The Lebanese Broadcasting Company satellite television news anchor report-
ed that al-Hakim “has renewed his support for a bigger UN role in bringing
democracy back to Iraq. Following his meeting with German Chancellor Ger-
hard Schroeder in Berlin, Al-Hakim said that he aims to establish a demo-
cratic and free state in Iraq that respects all religions and human rights.”20
While in exile in Tehran in the 1980s and 1990s, the al-Hakims had gone over
to Khomeinism, but clearly on their return to Iraq they had begun rejecting
dictatorial clerical rule as a model and begun acknowledging at least some
elements of popular sovereignty, though what they meant by “democracy”
and “human rights” might not have mapped exactly onto contemporary
Western ideals. Still, for Abdu’l-ªAziz al-Hakim to use this discourse is itself
significant.

When Bremer and his Interim Governing Council rejected Sistani’s
demands, the grand ayatollah orchestrated a campaign to rescind the Novem-
ber 15 agreement. Democracy and popular sovereignty were emerging as
central tools for the assertion of an indigenous, Iraqi, Shiite national identity,
enshrined in a constitution that flowed from the sovereign people. Bremer

Awsat, 15 January, 2004.

Bremer’s one-man rule had helped push Iraqi clerics toward a discourse of
popular, national sovereignty, so too had the prospect that a foreign, impe-
rial power, might impose an alien constitution.

On Thursday, January 15, 2004, Sistani’s representative in Basra, Hujjat
al-Islam ªAli ªAbd al-Karim Safi al-Musawi, led a huge demonstration of some
40,000 in a procession through public streets. The crowds carried placards
with slogans on them such as “Yes, Yes to Sistani, No, No to an Appointed
[Government],” and “We Want a Constitution Written by Elected Iraqis.”
When the crowd arrived at the mosque toward which they had marched,
Safi al-Musawi addressed them, criticizing the November 15 agreement that
forestalled open elections. He said that it had “been prepared with a haste
that was not just, and that it did not “reflect the pluralism of Iraqi society”
and would cause trouble among Iraq’s ethnic groups. He defended the idea
of holding general elections, considering that it was possible to call Iraqis
holding food ration cards to participate in the polling. Pamphlets circulated
through Basra with slogans written on them, such as “Peaceful demonstra-
tions are the best way of showing your support for the new democratic order,
and the multinational forces are here to support your mobilization.” (The
pamphleteers appear to have wanted to assure crowds that it would be safe to
come out.) The demonstrations were supported by the Daªwah Party and the
Supreme Council for Islamic Revolution in Iraq, though secular parties were
absent.23 That Friday, Shaikh Abd al-Mahdi al-Karbala’i, Sistani’s representa-
tive in the shrine city, warned that the coming days would witness demon-
strations, strikes and even possibly confrontations with American forces if
the Coalition insisted that it was impossible to conduct elections before the
transfer of sovereignty to Iraqis.

On January 19, the following Monday, the Shiite religious forces organ-
ized a demonstration estimated at 100,000 strong in the capital. According
to the Gulf daily al-Watan, they were expressing their support for Sistani’s
demands that elections be held before sovereignty was transferred to Iraq
by the US.24 The demonstration clearly was dominated by religious forces
and was led by young Shiite clergymen who said that they represented vari-
ous seminaries in Baghdad. The procession began at 8 am. They crossed the

> lims and all of us are participating. What we want is free elections, noth-
> ing else.” Observers could distinguish thick concentrations in the crowd

> resentation is Elections” and “Citizens, the Future will be Decided in the
> Coming Months! Be Zealous in Excercising your Rights in Determining the
> Course of Events!” The 5,000 out by the bridge called on the United Nations
> to exert pressure for elections, and carried placards with slogans such as,
> “We Ask the United Nations to Intervene in the Method of the Elections.”
> A representative of the Supreme Council for Islamic Revolution in Iraq,
> Sabah al-Musawi, told Agence France Presse, “We support the position of
> Sistani, since democracy accords with his views. We desire wide partici-
> pation through free elections, not imposed appointment.” He added, “We
> cannot in the future defend Iraqi representatives elected by small groups.”
> One of Sistani’s representatives, who helped organize the demonstrations,

> the Iraqi people would neither cooperate nor interact with it, save if it is the
> Iraqi people who elect it.” The Bush administration immediately backed off,
faced with these massive rallies, and cooperated with the sending of a UN

envoy, Lakhdar Brahimi, to determine when and how (rather than whether)
open elections would be held.25

Meanwhile, members of the Interim Governing Council who earlier had
favored the US approach to carefully controlled elections, based on the Coali-
tion-appointed provincial councils, defected to Sistani. Ahmad Chalabi told a
skeptical audience at the arch-conservative American Enterprise Institute in
Washington, DC, that he now favored open elections and believed they could
be held. And ªAbd al-ªAziz al-Hakim, leader of the Supreme Council for Islamic
Revolution in Iraq with its 15,000-strong Badr Corps paramilitary, told Reu-
ters the same thing in late January: “It can be done, if we want it and make
the effort. I believe they can be run.” Az-Zaman reported that al-Hakim admit-
ted, “Ideally elections would depend on the existence of a census, an electoral
law, and a law governing parties … There are problems … But I believe that
[elections] will express the opinion and the will of the people … will give a
voice to all, and holding them is feasible.”26

In a February 2004 interview with the German magazine, Der Spiegel, Sis-
tani said that he felt that the only way forward out of the quagmire was
democratic elections.27 When the German interviewer inquired as to whether
they might not produce a tyranny of the Shiite majority, Sistani demurred.
“Not at all. Even if a certain community holds a majority in numbers, this
will not lead to the creation of a political majority, because in every com-
munity there are different political orientations.” He felt it was important
that governments succeed one another peacefully, something that had been
rare during his lifetime in Iraq. He added, “Also, since the majority of the
Iraqi people are Muslims, they are sure to choose a system which will respect
the principles of the Islamic Sharia, and also protect the religious minori-
ties.” Sistani’s generousness of spirit blinded him to the need for constitu-
tional and institutional protections for minorities, and to the ways in which
implementation of Islamic law would disadvantage Chaldean and Assyrian
Christians, heterodox Yazidis, and secularists, including secular women. His
analysis of the fractured character of Shiite politics and the ability of minori-

sovereignty as expressed at the ballot box was key to these local demonstra-
tions in 2004.29

The issue remained hot at the national level as well. On February 8, a
political adviser to the Supreme Council for Islamic Revolution in Iraq, Sayyid
Muhsin al-Hakim (a brother of Abd al-ªAziz) gave an interview on issues in
democracy and elections in the Persian newspaper Iran.30 He began by defin-
ing what the Iraqi Shiites wanted. “Democracy can be regarded as one of the
important parameters that create security and stability in a country. Democ-
racy means that each person in society enjoys the rights of a citizen, can play
a decisive role in determining his social and political fate, and can elect a
government of his own choice. This is the accepted definition of democracy
in political philosophy.” He condemned the apparent tendency among “all
the three higher levels” of Iraqi politics at that point (presumably Bremer, the
Interim Governing Council and the United Nations) to engage in “suspicious
moves that want to bypass the vote of the Iraqi nation on various pretexts.”

Sayyid Muhsin conceives of the intervention of Sistani as an operation
of civil society, the public sphere that is neither governmental nor private.
Western theorists of civil society, from Hegel to Habermas, had not empha-
sized the role of religious institutions, in part because in European countries
such as Germany the Protestant-Catholic divide was so significant as to make
religion an unlikely platform for truly public, neutral interchanges, and so
religion was increasingly conceived as part of the private sphere. The role
of the Catholic Church in overthrowing Polish communism and the global
religious resurgence of the late twentieth and early twenty-first centuries,
however, have led many social theorists to look at religion as part of civil
society. Sayyid Muhsin positions the Najaf religious establishment in this
light, and defends its neutrality. He notes, “Analyses sometimes carried out
by some sources show that the true motive in this has not yet been clarified.”
This is a way of saying that these observers suspected that Sistani was act-
ing out of private or sectional motives, not out of truly public and national
ones. He denies this charge, however: “Actually, one can say that the only
objective that the religious reference point pursues is the institutionalization
of democracy in Iraq and stabilizing the rights of the citizens based on the

> formula of one person, one vote.” Sayyid Muhsin uses the universal refer-
> ence-points of “the citizens,” of the individual voter, of stabilized rights and
> democratic institutions, to characterize Sistani’s program, eliding its sectar-
ian and sectional context.

He adds, “A look at Iraq of the past shows that destabilization efforts were
> carried out on three major levels: dictatorship on all levels, the religious sup-
> pression of Shiites; and racial apartheid against the Kurds, the Turkmen, and
> the Assyrians.” Here, he posits a parallel between the “religious suppression”
> of his own community and the “racial” repression against the ethno-linguis-
> tic groups. Both kinds of Iraqi ethnicity suffered under the Saddamist dicta-
> torship. He continues, “Thus, the only alternative is elections and democracy,
> which takes into mind the Islamic identity of the Iraqi nation and includes
> all the elements that form the Iraqi nation’s social fabric.” The uneasy co-
> existence here of particularistic Shiite demands (majority rule and Islamic
> law) with national claims to rights for all citizens is mediated by “elections
> and democracy.” This mechanism is envisaged as ending the threat of dicta-
> torship, ending religious discrimination, and ending racial or linguistically-
> based discrimination, all at once. He challenges the idea that the Shiites
> want elections only because they are the majority and will inevitably come
> to power that way. He insists that “the Iraqi Shiites and their sagacious reli-
> gious point of reference [highest spiritual authority] have always wanted the
> vindication of the rights of the other nationalities in Iraq and the recognition
> of their basic rights and freedoms.” In acting for their rights, the Shiite cler-
> ics insisted, they are securing the legitimate rights of all Iraqis. He goes on
> to threaten that if the Shiite community is thwarted in its demand for open
elections, it would turn obstructionist and boycott the political process.

Other SCIRI leaders, such as Abd al-Aziz al-Hakim, wove the new discourse
> of national liberty through parliamentary elections into particularistic tradi-
> tions of Shiite piety. In early March of 2004, he gave a sermon on the ninth
> of Ashura, commemorating the martyrdom of Husayn, the grandson of the
> Prophet Muhammad, the central ritual commemoration of Shiite Islam. It
> was carried in the newspaper al-Adalah (Justice) on March 4. In the Shiite
> narrative, Husayn had stood with the masses in what is now Iraq against
> the oppression of the Umayyad Empire, then was cut down at Karbala by the
> armies sent out by the Caliph Yazid on October 10, 680. Al-Hakim addressed
> the crowd, saying, “We … pledge to our Imam al-Husayn to walk along his
> path, which calls for adherence to right, justice, and freedom, and rejects
injustice, arbitrariness, and tyranny.” In this litany, “freedom” is perhaps the

only truly modern element, added by al-Hakim to the more traditional values
of justice and right. Al-Hakim tied the passion of Husayn to the Iraqi Shiites’
yearning for an end to occupation and the advent of an elected, democratic
government:

> The land of Iraq is the land of the holy places and the cradle of freedom, and our
> Imam Al-Husayn may peace be on him, is the leader of the martyred and father
> of the free peoples. In order to close the road to all kinds of dictatorships and to
> prevent a repetition of the bitter experience of Saddam’s tyranny, our demand for
> this dangerous and sensitive stage of our struggling people’s life is to insist on
> the holding of free and fair elections to enable our peoples to have their say and
> express their opinion about whom they may choose to represent them.31

He here suggests a cycle of descent into tyranny and ascent into liberation.
The identification of Saddam Hussein with Yazid, the Umayyad persecutor
of Imam Husayn, was by then a hackneyed trope in Iraqi Shiism. But in the
context of March, 2004, al-Hakim’s reference to preventing further dictator-
ship is an oblique reference to Bremer’s one-man rule of Iraq. In folk Shiism,
it had been said that whoever weeps a tear for the slain Husayn was guaran-
teed entry to paradise. That is, he is a salvific figure. Likewise, here, al-Hakim
ties the symbology of the martyr’s sacrifice for spiritual salvation to a rheto-
ric of the people’s sacrifice for national liberation. Al-Hakim thus sets up a
neat parallel between the martyrdom of Husayn in the seventh century and
the rise of democracy in the early twenty-first century. Iraq was the scene
of both epiphanies. In both cases a long period of tyranny led the people
to rise up. Inspired by the sacrifice of the Prophet’s scion, the Iraqi people
now had the opportunity to institutionalize the values inherent in Ashura’
of refusal to countenance oppression. Not only free and fair elections but
also the rule of law are key to this new, continuous liberty. “The conferring
peoples confirm the need to issue a permanent constitution in the country.
The constitution should ensure the free and effective participation of all
sectors of society in the administration of their country in legitimate and
decentralized ways.” In this passage, we hear an early echo of al-Hakim’s
largest disagreement with Sistani, over whether Iraqi governance was best

In the build-up to elections in January 2005, other high Shiite religious

> on the security issue, saying “that the security situation is connected to the
> holding of the elections, which would lead to a free and democratic govern-

> elected government would have the authority and legitimacy to begin work-
> ing on ending the foreign occupation of the country. Another Najaf grand aya-
> tollah, Muhammad Saªid al-Hakim, was asked if the religious establishment
> had a plan for the elections. He replied, “Its plan is to hold real and national
> elections that lead to the composition of a truly sovereign and independent
> government.” He stressed that the objective of the religious establishment is
> to unify the national ranks and underscore efficiency and national will. The
> Rousseauan language of the national or general will recurs here, and it shows
> that Sistani was not alone in his interest in Enlightenment ideals about popu-
> lar sovereignty. Sistani cobbled the Daªwah Party, the Supreme Council for
> Islamic Revolution in Iraq, and other Shiite religious parties into a single list,
> the United Iraqi Alliance. He advised Shiites to vote for it, and on January 30,
> 2005, it won a simple majority in the new parliament.

> In conclusion, one can trace from April 2003 through January of 2005 a
> remarkable development in Shiite religious and legal thinking about democ-
> racy in Iraq. The ideals of elections, representation of the people, the expres-
sion of the national will, and a rule of law are invoked over and over again

by the most prominent religious leaders. Unlike Khomeini in 1979, they are
completely unafraid of the phrase term “democracy,” and generally see no
contradiction between it and Islam. These democratic convictions, of course,
have an immediate context. They give the religious establishment a means to
ensure that the Shiite majority in Iraq gains its political voice after decades
of severe repression. They also pave the way to an independent, sovereign
Iraq that may finally escape foreign domination. This instrumental utility of
democracy, however, cannot entirely explain the ayatollahs’ infatuation with
it. Rather, they survived the dictatorships of Saddam and Khomeini alike,
becoming disillusioned both with secularism and with authoritarian theoc-
racy.

The Shiite clerics were both helped and hindered by the Americans. The
Bush administration, having proved unable to discover the weapons of mass
destruction on which it had premised the war, increasingly turned to democ-
ratization as the justification for the continued occupation of Iraq. This rheto-
ric of democracy could thus be appropriated and used against the US by Iraqi
actors. The “one-man rule” of Paul Bremer became an easy target of criticism
when the Shiite clerics expressed their new commitment to popular rule.
The Americans also provoked a backlash. The Coalition Provisional Authority
under Paul Bremer stopped local elections and sought through the agree-
ment of November 15, 2003 to forestall open, one-person, one-vote elections
in Iraq for years to come. The Americans sought reliable local elites as allies,
and feared the unpredictability of open elections. The Shiite clerics were able
to enlist the Iraqi masses in their quest to pressure the Occupation Powers
into permitting open elections, both at the local and the national level. Local
protests at Hilla, Nasiriyah, Amara, Kut and elsewhere were important in
putting pressure on the CPA, and reflected discontents with lack of fuel and
services as well as a feeling of being blocked politically by foreign appoint-
ees. But most dramatic of all were the massive demonstrations in Basra and
Baghdad called in mid-January 2004 by Sistani.

The Shiite clerics were convinced of the compatibility of popular sover-
eignty with Islamic law at that point in Iraqi history, because they were sure
that the Shiite masses in the South – constituting some 60 percent of the
population – would vote for the Islamic parties and so ensure the triumph of
sharia. Their vision of democracy therefore involved a conception of dual sov-
ereignty, wherein clerical authority provided a bulwark against the possible
irresponsibility of the enfranchised masses. Despite adoption of the language
of “pluralism” (taªaddudiyyah) and expressing confidence that the rights of

> minorities would be protected, the clerics seemed remarkably unafraid of
> the consequences of a tyranny of the Shiite majority. They therefore seldom
> supported any practical checks or balances to protect minority rights. The
> language they favored was that of the general will of Jean-Jacques Rousseau,
> a democratic tradition notable for its lack of checks on majority power. Nev-
> ertheless, the clerics did speak clearly of minority rights and the need for
> pluralism, in a way that Khomeini never would have bothered to do. Some-
> thing new is clearly being born in Iraq that does not in the least resemble
> the theocratic systems of Muhammad Baqir al-Sadr or Ayatollah Khomeini. It
> is being born of Iraqi history and thought, and as much in reaction against
> the US as in cooperation with it. Constitutionalism, open elections, and par-
> liamentary bargaining are key to this new thinking among the Shiite clerics.
> In the phrase of sociologist Asef Bayat, their democratic thinking is a mani-
> festation of “post-Islamism,” and very possibly the beginning of the Islamic
> Enlightenment.

at the Beurs van Berlage, Amsterdam.

Clerically-led Shiism in Iraq is undergoing a reformation, in which leading
figures are attempting to reconcile the principles of Islam with those of the
Enlightenment. This encounter between the two systems is hardly new, and
the contradictions are hardly easy to work out. Yet the current attempt by
ayatollahs to engage with the ideals of Jean-Jacques Rousseau is among the
more thorough-going and institutionally promising in modern history. Here
we will look at the clerical discourse on popular sovereignty and elections
during the first eighteen months after the fall of Saddam.

What drove the Iraqi Shiite clerical leadership to champion elections and
popular sovereignty in post-Baathist Iraq? Was this stance wholly new in that
tradition, or were there precedents? Was the American administration help-
ful to them in developing this vision, or did it attempt to stand in its way?
How did their stance articulate with popular politics in the country, during a
time of both military and administrative occupation by the Americans? How
did these thinkers reconcile the secular implications of popular sovereignty
(after all the people are free to choose to be irreligious) with their own dedica-
tion to establishing an Islamic state in Iraq, ruled by Islamic law?

Notions of the basis of political and religious authority have changed con-
siderably within the Twelver Shiite tradition. They hold that after the death
of the Prophet Muhammad, legitimate authority should have passed to his
son-in-law, Ali b. Abi Talib, and thence to a line of his descendants. With the
exception of Ali himself, these “Imams” or divinely appointed leaders never
actually came to power, though they exerted spiritual influence over their
followers. That line of Imams ended with the Twelfth Imam, who is said to
have vanished into a mystical realm in CE 873, from which he will someday
return. The solution to the problem of legitimate authority in the absence
of the Prophet Muhammad was now itself problematic, since there were no
more Imams. Shiites dealt in various ways with the problem of who should

an Islamic republic, but not one necessarily ruled by clerics.5 The republic
was to implement Islamic canon law (sharia), and would have a consultative
council (shura). These are stock elements in any Islamist political program of
the twentieth century. It is seldom made clear by thinkers such as Muham-
mad Baqir al-Sadr (or by his contemporaries, such as Abu al-Ala’ al-Mawdudi
of the Jama’at-i Islami in Pakistan or Muhammad al-Hudaybi of the Muslim
Brotherhood in Egypt) how the “consultative council” comes into being or
to whom it is responsible, apart from God. That is, the invocation of the
consultative element did not necessarily imply parliamentary democracy for
al-Sadr. A Leninist style democratic centralism would have fit the “consulta-
tive council” language just as well. Still, a parliamentary system with open
elections would not be incompatible with al-Sadr’s vision in any obvious way,
in contrast to the thinking of Khomeini, which was actively hostile to the
notion of popular sovereignty.

Although he was a quietist earlier in his career, Grand Ayatollah Ali Husay-
ni Sistani emerged in the twenty-first century as among the more important
shapers of democracy in modern Iraq. He was born in 1930 in Mashhad,
eastern Iran. Sistani, from a clerical family, carried out his initial studies
with his father and other great clerics in the city of his birth. Around 1948
he went off for higher studies to Qom, not far from the capital of Tehran
in the north-central part of the country. There he worked with the greatest
Shiite authority of the time, Ayatollah Husayn Burujirdi. Late in 1951, the
young Sistani went to Najaf in Iraq to complete his education, and ended
up staying there the rest of his life. For the next decade, he studied with the
leading jurists of that city. To any extent that Sistani thought about political
matters, he appears to have been shaped by the ideals of the Constitutional
Revolution in early twentieth century Iran (1905-1911). In post-Saddam Iraq,
Sistani referred proudly to the role of Najaf clerics in theorizing a synthesis
of Shiite Islam and Western-style constitutionalism in 1905-1911. That experi-
ment ultimately failed, but left behind a body of thought on which clerics of
Sistani’s generation continued to draw.

In 1968 the secular, Arab nationalist Baath Party came to power in a coup.

Sistani himself adhered to the quietism of Burujirdi (d. 1961), Grand Ayatol-

wiped out, I will not let the experience of Iran be repeated in Iraq.”6

away from sects and ethnicity. This is although we call for an Islamic – not
religious – state as long as the Iraqis voluntarily and willingly support such
a state.”8 His distinction between an “Islamic” and a “religious” state is prob-
ably actually between a lay-governed regime that foregrounds Islamic canon
law and a clerically-ruled theocracy. The lay leaders of the Daªwah Party had
never liked the Khomeinist model of rule by a supreme jurisprudent. What
is remarkable here, however, is al-Maliki’s full endorsement of a universalist
version of popular sovereignty.

The Iraqi clerics in the post-Saddam period showed increasing openness
to the idea of popular sovereignty as expressed at the ballot box. On May 10,
the leader of the Supreme Council for Islamic Revolution in Iraq, Ayatollah
Muhammad Baqir al-Hakim, returned to his native country from exile in
Iran. He arrived at a time when a new American civil administrator, Paul
Bremer, had taken the reins of power. His predecessor, Jay Garner, had taken
steps toward appointing a governing council made up of Iraqi expatriate
politicians plus the Kurdish leaders, and from all accounts he hoped to move
quickly toward holding a congress in summer of 2003 that would elect an
Iraqi government, so that the Americans could swiftly depart. When Bremer
arrived, however, he set aside Garner’s plans and intimated that he would
rule Iraq single-handedly for some time, perhaps for years.

Bremer intended to follow a seven-stage plan for putting Iraq back on its
feet. One stage was to appoint a committee of Iraqis to work with Ameri-
can advisers in drafting a new permanent constitution for Iraq. Bremer
announced his intentions in early June. Muhammad Baqir al-Hakim made
this plan the center piece of the first Friday prayers sermon he preached in
Najaf, on June 6. He observed, “The United States suggests that the coalition
forces form a council, which it itself appoints. This council is to sit down,
draft a constitution and present it to the people.” He then thundered, “This
is a path that we and the authorities believe is an incorrect path.”9 Al-Hakim
went on to say that if the new Iraqi government was to function well, it
would have to be established on several key pillars. They included respect for
the will of the people as expressed at the ballot box, respect for ethnic minori-
ties via a federal system of government, and respect for Islam through the

the people. He said that the draft constitution should then be submitted to
a national referendum.

In other statements coming out of Najaf, it was clear that the high cler-
ics, including Sistani, saw governmental legitimacy as deriving from two
sources. One was the seal of approval (al-imda’) given by the grand ayatollahs
in Najaf. The other is the approval or agreement of the people through a gen-
eral election.11 In the absence of these two, the American-appointed Interim
Governing Council lacked legitimacy, according to the communiqué. This
statement recognizes two sources of legitimacy for an Iraqi government. The
dual sources of legitimacy did not imply, in the thinking of Sistani and those
around him, any sort of theocracy.

On November 15, US civil administrator Paul Bremer made a pact with the
Interim Governing Council that he himself had appointed, which called for
council-based elections in May, 2004.12 The plan had five basic stages. First,
the Interim Governing Council would craft a Basic Law allowing a transi-
tional government to be elected and operate. Second, by the spring, each of
Iraq’s 18 provinces would hold conventions made up of notables, elders and
tribal chieftains. These conventions would elect altogether over two hundred
members to an interim parliament, based on proportional representation.
This interim parliament would in turn elect a prime minister. This process
would be complete by June, 2004. Third, at that point, Mr. Bremer’s Coali-
tion Provisional Authority would hand over power to the new government
and close up shop. The US and UK military would remain in Iraq, however,
and the new government could invite other international contributors of
troops and other help. Fourth, the interim government would hold elections
for delegates to a constitutional convention to draft the new constitution,
in accordance with the fatwa or legal ruling of Grand Ayatollah Ali Sistani.
Fifth, formal elections on the basis of one person, one vote, would be held
to install a new government, to which the interim government will hand
power. This plan clearly was intended to achieve a restoration of sovereignty
to the Iraqi people without risking their voting in an anti-American govern-
ment. The Americans appear to have believed that if genuine elections were
permitted in spring of 2004 there was a risk that extreme Arab nationalists

population and the guarantee of the rights of other religions and sects.”14

Shiite leaders had other critiques of the Bremer plan. Among them was
that the electorate he envisaged, members of the municipal and provincial
councils, was a hodgepodge. IGC member Ahmad Shiyaª al-Barak, a human
rights lawyer and a leader of the Al Bu Sultan tribe of Babil province, told
al-Hayat that before elections could be held, the municipal and provincial
councils had to be reformed.15 He pointed out that some municipal councils
doubled as provincial ones (i.e. they have authority over the capital as well
as the whole province). They differed in how they were chosen, differed with
regard to how many members they had, and no standard set of regulations
specified their functions. Al-Barak was clearly concerned that if the councils
– many of them formed under watchful US eyes – were to function as the
election commissions, they could have been crucial in shaping the elector-
ate and the outcome of the polls. Therefore, their nature was the key to the
elections as the Bremer Accord envisaged them. He wanted “vast reforms” in
these councils before those elections.

Although Abd al-Mahdi, ironically enough, had earlier been the one who
assured Bremer that Grand Ayatollah Sistani accepted the outline of the plan,
either he was prevaricating or it was not fully explained to the sage of Najaf.
When the grand ayatollah understood that the Iraqi parliament was to be
elected by what Americans called “caucuses,” rather than on the basis of one
person, one vote, Sistani rejected this plan out of hand. In response to the
questions of Anthony Shadid of the Washington Post, he gave his most explicit
fatwa yet on popular sovereignty. Responding to Bremer’s council-based plan,
he said, “The instrumentality envisaged in it for electing the members of the
transitional legislature does not guarantee the formation of a parliament that
truly represents the Iraqi people. It must be changed to some other method,
which would guarantee it. And that is [direct] elections, such that the parlia-
ment would derive from the will of the Iraqis and would represent them in a
just manner and will safeguard it from any challenge to its legitimacy.”16 Sis-

reported on one such rally: “‘Yes, yes for elections!’ shouted the protesters,
a collection of students, clerics and middle-aged professionals whose ranks
swelled to more than 1,000. ‘No, no to appointment!’.”19 They said that they
had taken heart from Sistani’s call for direct elections. They also no doubt
feared that Bremer’s “caucus-based” elections would produce similar high
officials for the whole country. The Hilla demonstrations of fall 2003 showed
that the rhetoric of open elections was being taken up by the Iraqi street.
The techniques of crowd politics pioneered by the Sadr movement in post-
Saddam Iraq were to be adopted by other Shiite religious groups with great
effectiveness.

Other clerics who worked under Sistani’s penumbra, whether in religion
or politics or both, took up the discourse of the popular will. Abd al-ªAziz al-
Hakim became president of the Interim Governing Council, and in December
he visited Germany for consultations with Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder.
The Lebanese Broadcasting Company satellite television news anchor report-
ed that al-Hakim “has renewed his support for a bigger UN role in bringing
democracy back to Iraq. Following his meeting with German Chancellor Ger-
hard Schroeder in Berlin, Al-Hakim said that he aims to establish a demo-
cratic and free state in Iraq that respects all religions and human rights.”20
While in exile in Tehran in the 1980s and 1990s, the al-Hakims had gone over
to Khomeinism, but clearly on their return to Iraq they had begun rejecting
dictatorial clerical rule as a model and begun acknowledging at least some
elements of popular sovereignty, though what they meant by “democracy”
and “human rights” might not have mapped exactly onto contemporary
Western ideals. Still, for Abdu’l-ªAziz al-Hakim to use this discourse is itself
significant.

When Bremer and his Interim Governing Council rejected Sistani’s

enshrined in a constitution that flowed from the sovereign people. Bremer

Awsat, 15 January, 2004.

Bremer’s one-man rule had helped push Iraqi clerics toward a discourse of
popular, national sovereignty, so too had the prospect that a foreign, impe-
rial power, might impose an alien constitution.

On Thursday, January 15, 2004, Sistani’s representative in Basra, Hujjat
al-Islam ªAli ªAbd al-Karim Safi al-Musawi, led a huge demonstration of some
40,000 in a procession through public streets. The crowds carried placards
with slogans on them such as “Yes, Yes to Sistani, No, No to an Appointed
[Government],” and “We Want a Constitution Written by Elected Iraqis.”
When the crowd arrived at the mosque toward which they had marched,
Safi al-Musawi addressed them, criticizing the November 15 agreement that
forestalled open elections. He said that it had “been prepared with a haste
that was not just, and that it did not “reflect the pluralism of Iraqi society”
and would cause trouble among Iraq’s ethnic groups. He defended the idea
of holding general elections, considering that it was possible to call Iraqis
holding food ration cards to participate in the polling. Pamphlets circulated
through Basra with slogans written on them, such as “Peaceful demonstra-
tions are the best way of showing your support for the new democratic order,
and the multinational forces are here to support your mobilization.” (The
pamphleteers appear to have wanted to assure crowds that it would be safe to
come out.) The demonstrations were supported by the Daªwah Party and the
Supreme Council for Islamic Revolution in Iraq, though secular parties were
absent.23 That Friday, Shaikh Abd al-Mahdi al-Karbala’i, Sistani’s representa-
tive in the shrine city, warned that the coming days would witness demon-
strations, strikes and even possibly confrontations with American forces if
the Coalition insisted that it was impossible to conduct elections before the
transfer of sovereignty to Iraqis.

On January 19, the following Monday, the Shiite religious forces organ-
ized a demonstration estimated at 100,000 strong in the capital. According
to the Gulf daily al-Watan, they were expressing their support for Sistani’s
demands that elections be held before sovereignty was transferred to Iraq
by the US.24 The demonstration clearly was dominated by religious forces
and was led by young Shiite clergymen who said that they represented vari-
ous seminaries in Baghdad. The procession began at 8 am. They crossed the

> mad al-Kawarani said, “There is no party that organized the demonstration.

> tion.” Another young cleric, Muhammad Saªid, who was urging the crowd
> to stick to the route and not to spill onto side streets, said, “We are all Mus-
> lims and all of us are participating. What we want is free elections, noth-
> ing else.” Observers could distinguish thick concentrations in the crowd
> of supporters of the Supreme Council for Islamic Revolution in Iraq and

> chants, such as “Yes, yes, to Islam!” and “There is no deity but God and
> Muhammad is his Prophet!” They held aloft placards in Arabic and English

> and yes, yes to elections” and “The Surest Guarantee of True and Just Rep-
> resentation is Elections” and “Citizens, the Future will be Decided in the
> Coming Months! Be Zealous in Excercising your Rights in Determining the
> Course of Events!” The 5,000 out by the bridge called on the United Nations
> to exert pressure for elections, and carried placards with slogans such as,
> “We Ask the United Nations to Intervene in the Method of the Elections.”
> A representative of the Supreme Council for Islamic Revolution in Iraq,
> Sabah al-Musawi, told Agence France Presse, “We support the position of
> Sistani, since democracy accords with his views. We desire wide partici-
> pation through free elections, not imposed appointment.” He added, “We
> cannot in the future defend Iraqi representatives elected by small groups.”
> One of Sistani’s representatives, who helped organize the demonstrations,
> said, “We Iraqis are a civilized people and are capable of deciding our fate.”
> He said that no appointed government could be depended on to give Iraqis
> their rights. He stressed, “The government would have no legitimacy, and
> the Iraqi people would neither cooperate nor interact with it, save if it is the
> Iraqi people who elect it.” The Bush administration immediately backed off,
faced with these massive rallies, and cooperated with the sending of a UN

envoy, Lakhdar Brahimi, to determine when and how (rather than whether)
open elections would be held.25

Meanwhile, members of the Interim Governing Council who earlier had
favored the US approach to carefully controlled elections, based on the Coali-
tion-appointed provincial councils, defected to Sistani. Ahmad Chalabi told a
skeptical audience at the arch-conservative American Enterprise Institute in
Washington, DC, that he now favored open elections and believed they could
be held. And ªAbd al-ªAziz al-Hakim, leader of the Supreme Council for Islamic
Revolution in Iraq with its 15,000-strong Badr Corps paramilitary, told Reu-
ters the same thing in late January: “It can be done, if we want it and make
the effort. I believe they can be run.” Az-Zaman reported that al-Hakim admit-
ted, “Ideally elections would depend on the existence of a census, an electoral
law, and a law governing parties … There are problems … But I believe that
[elections] will express the opinion and the will of the people … will give a
voice to all, and holding them is feasible.”26

In a February 2004 interview with the German magazine, Der Spiegel, Sis-
tani said that he felt that the only way forward out of the quagmire was
democratic elections.27 When the German interviewer inquired as to whether
they might not produce a tyranny of the Shiite majority, Sistani demurred.
“Not at all. Even if a certain community holds a majority in numbers, this
will not lead to the creation of a political majority, because in every com-
munity there are different political orientations.” He felt it was important
that governments succeed one another peacefully, something that had been
rare during his lifetime in Iraq. He added, “Also, since the majority of the
Iraqi people are Muslims, they are sure to choose a system which will respect
the principles of the Islamic Sharia, and also protect the religious minori-
ties.” Sistani’s generousness of spirit blinded him to the need for constitu-
tional and institutional protections for minorities, and to the ways in which
implementation of Islamic law would disadvantage Chaldean and Assyrian
Christians, heterodox Yazidis, and secularists, including secular women. His
analysis of the fractured character of Shiite politics and the ability of minori-

sovereignty as expressed at the ballot box was key to these local demonstra-
tions in 2004.29

The issue remained hot at the national level as well. On February 8, a
political adviser to the Supreme Council for Islamic Revolution in Iraq, Sayyid
Muhsin al-Hakim (a brother of Abd al-ªAziz) gave an interview on issues in
democracy and elections in the Persian newspaper Iran.30 He began by defin-
ing what the Iraqi Shiites wanted. “Democracy can be regarded as one of the
important parameters that create security and stability in a country. Democ-
racy means that each person in society enjoys the rights of a citizen, can play
a decisive role in determining his social and political fate, and can elect a
government of his own choice. This is the accepted definition of democracy
in political philosophy.” He condemned the apparent tendency among “all
the three higher levels” of Iraqi politics at that point (presumably Bremer, the
Interim Governing Council and the United Nations) to engage in “suspicious
moves that want to bypass the vote of the Iraqi nation on various pretexts.”

Sayyid Muhsin conceives of the intervention of Sistani as an operation
of civil society, the public sphere that is neither governmental nor private.
Western theorists of civil society, from Hegel to Habermas, had not empha-
sized the role of religious institutions, in part because in European countries
such as Germany the Protestant-Catholic divide was so significant as to make
religion an unlikely platform for truly public, neutral interchanges, and so
religion was increasingly conceived as part of the private sphere. The role
of the Catholic Church in overthrowing Polish communism and the global
religious resurgence of the late twentieth and early twenty-first centuries,
however, have led many social theorists to look at religion as part of civil
society. Sayyid Muhsin positions the Najaf religious establishment in this
light, and defends its neutrality. He notes, “Analyses sometimes carried out
by some sources show that the true motive in this has not yet been clarified.”
This is a way of saying that these observers suspected that Sistani was act-
ing out of private or sectional motives, not out of truly public and national
ones. He denies this charge, however: “Actually, one can say that the only
objective that the religious reference point pursues is the institutionalization
of democracy in Iraq and stabilizing the rights of the citizens based on the

> formula of one person, one vote.” Sayyid Muhsin uses the universal refer-
> ence-points of “the citizens,” of the individual voter, of stabilized rights and
> democratic institutions, to characterize Sistani’s program, eliding its sectar-
ian and sectional context.

He adds, “A look at Iraq of the past shows that destabilization efforts were
> carried out on three major levels: dictatorship on all levels, the religious sup-
> pression of Shiites; and racial apartheid against the Kurds, the Turkmen, and
> the Assyrians.” Here, he posits a parallel between the “religious suppression”
> of his own community and the “racial” repression against the ethno-linguis-
> tic groups. Both kinds of Iraqi ethnicity suffered under the Saddamist dicta-
> torship. He continues, “Thus, the only alternative is elections and democracy,
> which takes into mind the Islamic identity of the Iraqi nation and includes
> all the elements that form the Iraqi nation’s social fabric.” The uneasy co-
> existence here of particularistic Shiite demands (majority rule and Islamic
> law) with national claims to rights for all citizens is mediated by “elections
> and democracy.” This mechanism is envisaged as ending the threat of dicta-
> torship, ending religious discrimination, and ending racial or linguistically-
> based discrimination, all at once. He challenges the idea that the Shiites
> want elections only because they are the majority and will inevitably come
> to power that way. He insists that “the Iraqi Shiites and their sagacious reli-
> gious point of reference [highest spiritual authority] have always wanted the
> vindication of the rights of the other nationalities in Iraq and the recognition
> of their basic rights and freedoms.” In acting for their rights, the Shiite cler-
> ics insisted, they are securing the legitimate rights of all Iraqis. He goes on
> to threaten that if the Shiite community is thwarted in its demand for open
elections, it would turn obstructionist and boycott the political process.

Other SCIRI leaders, such as Abd al-Aziz al-Hakim, wove the new discourse
> of national liberty through parliamentary elections into particularistic tradi-
> tions of Shiite piety. In early March of 2004, he gave a sermon on the ninth
> of Ashura, commemorating the martyrdom of Husayn, the grandson of the
> Prophet Muhammad, the central ritual commemoration of Shiite Islam. It
> was carried in the newspaper al-Adalah (Justice) on March 4. In the Shiite
> narrative, Husayn had stood with the masses in what is now Iraq against
> the oppression of the Umayyad Empire, then was cut down at Karbala by the
> armies sent out by the Caliph Yazid on October 10, 680. Al-Hakim addressed
> the crowd, saying, “We … pledge to our Imam al-Husayn to walk along his
> path, which calls for adherence to right, justice, and freedom, and rejects
injustice, arbitrariness, and tyranny.” In this litany, “freedom” is perhaps the

only truly modern element, added by al-Hakim to the more traditional values
of justice and right. Al-Hakim tied the passion of Husayn to the Iraqi Shiites’
yearning for an end to occupation and the advent of an elected, democratic
government:

> The land of Iraq is the land of the holy places and the cradle of freedom, and our
> Imam Al-Husayn may peace be on him, is the leader of the martyred and father
> of the free peoples. In order to close the road to all kinds of dictatorships and to
> prevent a repetition of the bitter experience of Saddam’s tyranny, our demand for
> this dangerous and sensitive stage of our struggling people’s life is to insist on
> the holding of free and fair elections to enable our peoples to have their say and
> express their opinion about whom they may choose to represent them.31

He here suggests a cycle of descent into tyranny and ascent into liberation.
The identification of Saddam Hussein with Yazid, the Umayyad persecutor
of Imam Husayn, was by then a hackneyed trope in Iraqi Shiism. But in the
context of March, 2004, al-Hakim’s reference to preventing further dictator-
ship is an oblique reference to Bremer’s one-man rule of Iraq. In folk Shiism,
it had been said that whoever weeps a tear for the slain Husayn was guaran-
teed entry to paradise. That is, he is a salvific figure. Likewise, here, al-Hakim
ties the symbology of the martyr’s sacrifice for spiritual salvation to a rheto-
ric of the people’s sacrifice for national liberation. Al-Hakim thus sets up a
neat parallel between the martyrdom of Husayn in the seventh century and
the rise of democracy in the early twenty-first century. Iraq was the scene
of both epiphanies. In both cases a long period of tyranny led the people
to rise up. Inspired by the sacrifice of the Prophet’s scion, the Iraqi people
now had the opportunity to institutionalize the values inherent in Ashura’
of refusal to countenance oppression. Not only free and fair elections but
also the rule of law are key to this new, continuous liberty. “The conferring
peoples confirm the need to issue a permanent constitution in the country.
The constitution should ensure the free and effective participation of all
sectors of society in the administration of their country in legitimate and
decentralized ways.” In this passage, we hear an early echo of al-Hakim’s
largest disagreement with Sistani, over whether Iraqi governance was best

In the build-up to elections in January 2005, other high Shiite religious
> authorities also weighed in on democracy and popular sovereignty. The Bagh-
> dad newspaper al-Furat reported on October 10, 2004, that Grand Ayatollah

> elections be held on schedule (i.e. no later than January 30, 2005) and “added
> that the elections represent the first step in the right direction toward build-
> ing a free Iraq and achieving justice and stability for the Iraqis.” He elaborated
> on the security issue, saying “that the security situation is connected to the
> holding of the elections, which would lead to a free and democratic govern-
> ment.” Implicit in the ayatollahs’ statements was a conviction that only an
> elected government would have the authority and legitimacy to begin work-
> ing on ending the foreign occupation of the country. Another Najaf grand aya-
> tollah, Muhammad Saªid al-Hakim, was asked if the religious establishment
> had a plan for the elections. He replied, “Its plan is to hold real and national
> elections that lead to the composition of a truly sovereign and independent
> government.” He stressed that the objective of the religious establishment is
> to unify the national ranks and underscore efficiency and national will. The
> Rousseauan language of the national or general will recurs here, and it shows
> that Sistani was not alone in his interest in Enlightenment ideals about popu-
> lar sovereignty. Sistani cobbled the Daªwah Party, the Supreme Council for
> Islamic Revolution in Iraq, and other Shiite religious parties into a single list,
> the United Iraqi Alliance. He advised Shiites to vote for it, and on January 30,
> 2005, it won a simple majority in the new parliament.

> In conclusion, one can trace from April 2003 through January of 2005 a
> remarkable development in Shiite religious and legal thinking about democ-
> racy in Iraq. The ideals of elections, representation of the people, the expres-
sion of the national will, and a rule of law are invoked over and over again

by the most prominent religious leaders. Unlike Khomeini in 1979, they are
completely unafraid of the phrase term “democracy,” and generally see no
contradiction between it and Islam. These democratic convictions, of course,
have an immediate context. They give the religious establishment a means to
ensure that the Shiite majority in Iraq gains its political voice after decades
of severe repression. They also pave the way to an independent, sovereign
Iraq that may finally escape foreign domination. This instrumental utility of
democracy, however, cannot entirely explain the ayatollahs’ infatuation with
it. Rather, they survived the dictatorships of Saddam and Khomeini alike,
becoming disillusioned both with secularism and with authoritarian theoc-
racy.

The Shiite clerics were both helped and hindered by the Americans. The
Bush administration, having proved unable to discover the weapons of mass
destruction on which it had premised the war, increasingly turned to democ-
ratization as the justification for the continued occupation of Iraq. This rheto-
ric of democracy could thus be appropriated and used against the US by Iraqi
actors. The “one-man rule” of Paul Bremer became an easy target of criticism
when the Shiite clerics expressed their new commitment to popular rule.
The Americans also provoked a backlash. The Coalition Provisional Authority
under Paul Bremer stopped local elections and sought through the agree-
ment of November 15, 2003 to forestall open, one-person, one-vote elections
in Iraq for years to come. The Americans sought reliable local elites as allies,
and feared the unpredictability of open elections. The Shiite clerics were able
to enlist the Iraqi masses in their quest to pressure the Occupation Powers
into permitting open elections, both at the local and the national level. Local
protests at Hilla, Nasiriyah, Amara, Kut and elsewhere were important in
putting pressure on the CPA, and reflected discontents with lack of fuel and
services as well as a feeling of being blocked politically by foreign appoint-
ees. But most dramatic of all were the massive demonstrations in Basra and
Baghdad called in mid-January 2004 by Sistani.

The Shiite clerics were convinced of the compatibility of popular sover-
eignty with Islamic law at that point in Iraqi history, because they were sure
that the Shiite masses in the South – constituting some 60 percent of the
population – would vote for the Islamic parties and so ensure the triumph of
sharia. Their vision of democracy therefore involved a conception of dual sov-
ereignty, wherein clerical authority provided a bulwark against the possible
irresponsibility of the enfranchised masses. Despite adoption of the language
of “pluralism” (taªaddudiyyah) and expressing confidence that the rights of

> minorities would be protected, the clerics seemed remarkably unafraid of
> the consequences of a tyranny of the Shiite majority. They therefore seldom
> supported any practical checks or balances to protect minority rights. The
> language they favored was that of the general will of Jean-Jacques Rousseau,
> a democratic tradition notable for its lack of checks on majority power. Nev-
> ertheless, the clerics did speak clearly of minority rights and the need for
> pluralism, in a way that Khomeini never would have bothered to do. Some-
> thing new is clearly being born in Iraq that does not in the least resemble
> the theocratic systems of Muhammad Baqir al-Sadr or Ayatollah Khomeini. It
> is being born of Iraqi history and thought, and as much in reaction against
> the US as in cooperation with it. Constitutionalism, open elections, and par-
> liamentary bargaining are key to this new thinking among the Shiite clerics.
> In the phrase of sociologist Asef Bayat, their democratic thinking is a mani-
> festation of “post-Islamism,” and very possibly the beginning of the Islamic
> Enlightenment.
