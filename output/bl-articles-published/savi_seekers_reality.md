Methods and qualities of the seekers of Reality in
Some Answered Questions in the light of Bahá’í

Scriptures

Julio Savi

In Some Answered Questions, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá illustrates a
number of criteria and qualities of the seekers of Reality. He
mentions the senses, the method of reason or intellect, the text
of the Holy Writings and the bounty of the Holy Spirit. He
emphasizes the fallacy of the first three criteria and the
foremost importance of the last one. A combined and balanced
use of the senses, the method of reason and the text of the Holy
Writings undoubtedly brings the seeker closer to Reality, but
only the bounty of the Holy Spirit bestows enlightenment and
certitude upon her. If the seeker wants to obtain the bounty of
the Holy Spirit, she should realize a number of indispensable
qualities and conditions. The enlightenment and certitude
bestowed by the Holy Spirit are necessary so that any good
action performed by the seeker may be conducive to her true
salvation and prosperity.

Such is the importance ascribed to search after and
knowledge of Reality in the Bahá’í teachings that they are
described as the purpose of human life in the short Obligatory
Prayer. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá says in Some Answered Questions (76-7,
ch.14, para.9):

> the people of knowledge are lovers of the sun … The
> people of perception are the seekers of the truth … man
> must be the seeker after the Reality… He must be
> fascinated and enraptured, and attracted to the divine
> bounty; he must be like the butterfly who is the lover of
> the light … and like the nightingale who is the lover of
> the rose …
‘Abdu’l-Bahá describes in the same book ‘four accepted
methods of comprehension (mízán-i-idrák)’: ‘[1] the senses
(˙iss) … [2] the method of reason (‘aql)… of the understanding
(idrák) … [3] tradition (naql) — that is, … the text of the Holy

Lights of ‘Irfán Book Ten                                     312

Scriptures (nußúß-i-kitáb-i-muqaddasih) … [4] the bounty of the
Holy Spirit (fay∂-i-Rúhu’l-Quds)’ (297-9, ch.83, paras.2, 3, 4
and 5, M207-8). He also explains these four methods in other
circumstances. In His Tablet to Dr. Forel He mentions the
‘reasoning      power         (qavá’id-i-’aqlíyyih)’, ‘observation
(naΩaríyyih)’, (man†iqíyyih, dialectic, not translated) the
‘intuitive faculties (†ulú’át-i-fikríyyih, lit. revelations of the
thought) and the revealing power of … faith (iktisháfát-i-
vijdáníyyih, lit. the discoveries of the soul)’ (Bahá’í World
15:37-43, Makátíb 1:259). In His talk delivered at Hotel Ansonia
in New York on 17 April 1912,1 He mentions ‘first, sense
perception; second, reason; third, traditions; fourth,
inspiration’. In another talk delivered at the Eireinion in Green
Acre Eliot (Maine) in 16 August 1912,2 He says: ‘Proofs are of
four kinds: first, through sense perception; second, through the
reasoning faculty; third, from traditional or scriptural
authority; fourth, through the medium of inspiration. That is
to say, there are four criteria or standards of judgment by
which the human mind reaches its conclusions’ (253). Also
Isabel Fraser Chamberlain records a talk where ‘Abdu’l-Bahá
mentions ‘four means of knowledge’ (ADP 88): ‘the senses,
principally through observation … logic … the text …
inspiration’ (ibid.). Finally, in a talk delivered at Open Forum,
or Materialists Club, in San Francisco (California) on 10
October 1912, 3 ‘Abdu’l-Bahá mentions only ‘the senses (˙iss)’
and ‘the intellect (‘aql)’ (356, K601).

If one reflects on these various sources, one may obtain a
quite coherent concept. Human knowledge depends on four
instruments: sense perception, intellect or reason, the Holy
Writings and insight or inspiration. Each of these four
instruments is fallible in itself. Each of them may be refined
and supported through another one. The mistakes of the senses
may be rectified through intellect; the mistakes of intellect may
be rectified through one’s study of the Holy Writings, ‘the
Unerring Balance established amongst men’ (Bahá’u’lláh, Kitáb-
i-Aqdas 13, para.99), ‘the science of the love of God’
(Bahá’u’lláh, Four Valleys 52); human mistakes in one’s
interpretation of the Holy Writings may be rectified through a
proper use of insight or the ‘inner eye’ (Bahá’u’lláh, Kitáb-i-
Iqan 197, para.217); the mistakes of the ‘inner eye’ and any
other one may be corrected through ‘the spirit of faith’
(‘Abdu’l-Bahá, Some Answered Questions 144, sec.36, para.4).
A balanced and co-ordinated use of all the four instruments
draws the seeker closer to reality. However, what enables her to

Methods and Qualities of the Seekers of Reality                 313

certitude is only the bounty of the Holy Spirit, that draws her
closer and closer to Reality, and finally to enlightenment and
certitude.

Sense Perception

The senses are fallacious, but the intellect may rectify their
mistakes. Sight tells us that the earth is flat, but a rational
observation of the universe has enabled scientists to discover
that the earth is round. The senses enable us to perceive only
material or outer reality, but our insight, properly refined
through our study of the Holy Writings, prayer, meditation
and the practice of good deeds, enables our senses to ‘discover
in whatever hath been created by Thee in the kingdoms of earth
and heaven nothing but Thy wondrous Beauty and the
revelation of the splendors of Thy face’ (Bahá’u’lláh, Prayers
and Meditations 337, sec. CLXXXIV, para.19). In this vein
Bahá’u’lláh writes:

> Every time I lift up mine eyes unto Thy heaven, I call to
> mind Thy highness and Thy loftiness, and Thine
> incomparable glory and greatness; and every time I
> turn my gaze to Thine earth, I am made to recognize
> the evidences of Thy power and the tokens of Thy
> bounty. And when I behold the sea, I find that it
> speaketh to me of Thy majesty, and of the potency of
> Thy might, and of Thy sovereignty and Thy grandeur.
> And at whatever time I contemplate the mountains, I
> am led to discover the ensigns of Thy victory and the
> standards of Thine omnipotence.
> I swear by Thy might, O Thou in Whose grasp are the
> reins of all mankind, and the destinies of the nations! I
> am so inflamed by my love for Thee, and so inebriated
> with the wine of Thy oneness, that I can hear from the
> whisper of the winds the sound of Thy glorification
> and praise, and can recognize in the murmur of the
> waters the voice that proclaimeth Thy virtues and
> Thine attributes, and can apprehend from the rustling
> of the leaves the mysteries that have been irrevocably
> ordained by Thee in Thy realm. (Prayers and Meditations
> 272, sec. CLXXVI, para.16)
Lights of ‘Irfán Book Ten                                        314

Intellect and Logic

The modern Western world has full confidence in its
intellect and thinks that intellect is, together with the senses,
the supreme guarantor of human knowledge. A number of
statements in Some Answered Questions seemingly show that
‘Abdu’l-Bahá had not the same confidence in human intellect as
modern Westerners. He recognizes that human intelligence and
thought, when properly trained,

> may attain complete development, so that knowledge
> and science may increase, and the reality of things, the
> mysteries of beings and the properties of existence may
> be discovered; that, day by day, instructions,
> inventions and institutions may be improved; and
> from things perceptible to the senses conclusions as to
> intellectual things may be deduced. (SAQ 9, ch.3, para.9)
However, seemingly interpreting Bahá’u’lláh’s statement that
‘the highest thought of men, however deep their contemplation,
can never hope to outsoar the limitations imposed upon Thy
creation, nor ascend beyond the state of the contingent world’
(Prayers and Meditations 327, sec. CLXXXIV, para.6),
‘Abdu’l-Bahá states that intellect by itself cannot understand
metaphysical verities. He says that intellect ‘must depend on
the help of the spiritual and divine power to be able to
undertake this mission’ (SAQ 9, ch.3, para.11), ‘so that
intelligence and comprehension may penetrate the metaphysical
world, and may receive benefit from the sanctifying breeze of
the Holy Spirit, and may enter into relationship with the
Supreme Concourse. (SAQ 9, ch.3, para.10)’. In the same vein
‘Abdu’l-Bahá also states that

> This spirit, which in the terminology of the
> philosophers is the rational soul (nafs-i-ná†iqih),
> embraces all beings, and as far as human ability
> permits discovers the realities of things and becomes
> cognizant of their peculiarities and effects, and of the
> qualities and properties of beings. But the human
> spirit, unless assisted by the spirit of faith (rú˙-i-
> ímání), does not become acquainted with the divine
> secrets and the heavenly realities. It is like a mirror
> which, although clear, polished and brilliant, is still in
> need of light. Until a ray of the sun reflects upon it, it
> cannot discover the heavenly secrets. (SAQ 208-9, ch.55,
> para.5, M148)
Methods and Qualities of the Seekers of Reality                  315

Only in this condition our intellect can reach its highest
expression, which Bahá’u’lláh describes as follows:

> Having recognized thy powerlessness to attain to an
> adequate understanding of that Reality which abideth
> within thee, thou wilt readily admit the futility of such
> efforts as may be attempted by thee, or by any of the
> created things, to fathom the mystery of the Living
> God, the Day Star of unfading glory, the Ancient of
> everlasting days. This confession of helplessness which
> mature contemplation must eventually impel every
> mind to make is in itself the acme of human
> understanding, and marketh the culmination of man’s
> development. (GWB 165-6, sec.83, para.4)
In summary, concerning spiritual knowledge, our intellect is
inferior to the inner perception acquired through the bounty of
the Spirit of Faith and of the Holy Spirit. In this vein ‘Abdu’l-
Bahá says:

> These obvious arguments (adillah) are adduced for weak
> (∂á’ífih) souls; but if the inner perception (dídiy-i-
> baßírat) be open, a hundred thousand clear proofs
> become visible. Thus, when man feels the indwelling
> spirit (i˙sás-i-rú˙-i-dashtih bashad), he is in no need of
> arguments for its existence; but for those who are
> deprived of the bounty of the spirit (fay∂-i-rú˙), it is
> necessary to establish external arguments (dalá’il-i-
> khárjih) (SAQ 6, ch.2, para.11, M5)

The Holy Writings

Infallible in themselves, the Holy Writings become fallible
whenever they are analyzed by a weak human intellect, which
may introduce every kind of mistakes in them. Also in this case
human intellect may be assisted through the inspiration of the
spiritual powers. Bahá’u’lláh explains:

> Know thou that the passages that We have called
> ‘ambiguous (mutishábihát)’ appear as such only in the
> eyes of them that have failed to soar above the horizon
> of guidance and to reach the heights of knowledge in
> the retreats of grace. For otherwise, unto them that
> have recognized the Repositories of divine Revelation
> and beheld through His inspiration (fí má ilqá alláh ‘ala
> anfusahum, lit. in that which God hath handed down
Lights of ‘Irfán Book Ten                                       316

> unto them) the mysteries of divine authority, all the
> verses of God are perspicuous and all His allusions are
> clear. Such men discern the inner mysteries that have
> been clothed in the garment of words as clearly as ye
> perceive the heat of the sun or the wetness of water, nay
> even more distinctly. Immeasurably exalted is God
> above our praise of His loved ones, and beyond their
> praise of Him! (GDM 26-7, para.34)

Insight or Inspiration

A master in its use of intellect, Western man is suspicious
of insight. And in many ways he is not wrong. Inspiration has
been described as: ‘A special immediate action or influence of
the Spirit of God … upon the human mind or soul’ (Oxford
7:1036). It also has been defined (Battaglia 8:593) as:

> A sudden enlightenment of the spirit, which appears as
> a guidance for one’s behavior emerging from unknown
> depths of one’s personality and coordinating past and
> future experience through intuitive ways … Influence
> exerted by God upon a person, who is enlightened in his
> mind, spurred in his will, directed and sustained in his
> action, for the attainment of a supernatural goal … an
> impulsion (considered of divine origin or arising from
> a mysterious force or an inner wealth) which … leads a
> person, in a sort of enrapture or creative ecstasy, to
> translate circumstances, impressions, feelings, etc.

into works of art.
‘Abdu’l-Bahá said to Mrs Parson on 28 April 1912:4

> ‘This material world has an outer appearance. It has
> also a hidden aspect. All created things are interlinked
> in a chain leading to spirituality ‘[the unseen’, in Star
> of the West] and ultimately ending in abstract
> [‘spiritual’ in Star of the West] realities. I hope that
> these spiritual links will become stronger day by day
> and that this communication of hearts, which is
> termed inspiration, will continue. When this
> connection exists, bodily separation is not important;
> this condition is beyond the world of words and above
> all description’. (qtd. in Mahmud’s Diary 66)
He explains elsewhere that ‘inspiration’ is the ‘influx’
(Promulgation 22) or ‘the promptings or susceptibilities of the

Methods and Qualities of the Seekers of Reality                317

human heart’ (ibid. 254). He adds that the human heart may be
influenced both by ‘satanic’ and ‘divine promptings.’ The
former, which He also calls ‘imagination’ (ibid. 251), come
from our lower self. The latter ones are a ‘prompting of the
heart through the merciful assistance’ (Promulgation 254).
‘Abdu’l-Bahá also says that imagination ‘can only picture that
which it is able to create’ (Paris Talks 11, ch.5, para.6), that it
is ‘accidental (or non-essential)’ (Tablets 3:562), limited and
often at odds with reality. Therefore He seemingly uses the term
‘imagination’ as ‘a creative power of the mind that conceives
dreams, illusions, abstractions, fictitious and bizarre forms,
activities of idle thinking, of conjecturing’ (Battaglia 7:342).
‘Abdu’l-Bahá explains that we can differentiate between
‘inspiration’ and ‘imagination’, because ‘inspiration is in
conformity with the Divine Texts, but imaginations do not
conform therewith’ (Tablets 1:195). Another difference is that
the ideas

> which owe their source to the Light of Truth will be
> realized in the outward world; while others of a
> different origin vanish, come and go like waves on the
> sea of imagination and find no realization in the world
> of existence. (Tablets 2:301)
> As to the difference between inspiration and
> imagination … A real, spiritual connection between the
> True One and the servant is a luminous bounty which
> causeth an ecstatic (or divine) flame, passion and
> attraction. When this connection is secured (or
> realized) such an ecstasy and happiness become
> manifest in the heart that man doth fly away (with joy)
> and uttereth melody and song. Just as the soul bringeth
> the body in motion, so that spiritual bounty and real
> connection likewise moveth (or cheereth) the human
> soul. (‘Abdu’l-Bahá, Tablets 1:195)
In other words, ‘The spirit has great perception without the
intermediary of any of the five senses, such as the eyes or ears’
(SAQ 252, ch.71, para.7). However,

> The mind and the thought of man sometimes discover
> truths, and from this thought and discovery signs and
> results are produced. This thought has a foundation.
> But many things come to the mind of man which are
> like the waves of the sea of imaginations; they have no
Lights of ‘Irfán Book Ten                                         318

> fruit, and no result comes from them. (SAQ 253, ch.71,
> para.9)
In this context, we could say that ideas conceived under the
impulse of imagination do not give fruits, that is, they do not
produce fruits of unity, harmony and peace.

‘Abdu’l-Bahá says that inspiration may be received through
‘Obligatory Prayer’ (in The Importance of Obligatory Prayer
and Fasting, no. XXI) and ‘during meditation’ (Paris Talks 187,
ch.54, para.11). He writes in this regard:

> I ask God that He may open the gate of the knowledge
> of this station to thine heart so that thou mayest
> apprehend whatever is necessary and proper, garner
> spiritual bounties from the heaven of the All-Merciful,
> obtain the effulgences of knowledge from the Sun of
> Reality, and become a manifestation of inspiration
> from the Unseen and a source of glad-tidings from the
> All-Merciful. (in The Importance of Obligatory Prayer and
> Fasting, no. XXI)
He also writes: ‘when the heart becometh confident, the
imagination of Satan and evil vanisheth away. If the heart
becometh absolutely tranquil, suspicion and imagination will
entirely pass away’ (Tablets 1:104). He explains this concept in
details (Tablets 3:706):

> if thy mind become empty and pure from every
> mention and thought and thy heart attracted wholly to
> the Kingdom of God, forget all else besides God and
> come in communion with the Spirit of God, then the
> Holy Spirit will assist thee with a power which will
> enable thee to penetrate all things, and a Dazzling Spark
> which enlightens all sides, a Brilliant Flame in the zenith
> of the heavens, will teach thee that which thou dost not
> know of the facts of the universe and of the divine
> doctrine.
He also says in an address He delivered to the Paris
Theosophical Society, at the Theosophical Headquarters, 59
Avenue de la Bourdonnois, on 13 February 1913:

> … the spirit of life is omnipotent, especially when it
> establishes a communication with God and becomes
> the recipient of the eternal light—then it transforms
> itself into a ray of the effulgence of the eternal sun.
Methods and Qualities of the Seekers of Reality                  319

> This station is the greatest of all stations, for this
> connection of the spirit of man with God is like unto a
> mirror and the sun of reality is reflected in it. Thus it
> becomes the collective centre of all the virtues; its
> emanation is the bestowal of the king of bestowers; its
> radiations are the manifold splendours of the infinite
> luminary; its sanctity is from the highest summit of
> divine essence. This station is the station of heavenly
> inspiration and is called the station of the divine grace.
> It signifies that the rays of the sun of reality are
> resplendent in the mirror and the attributes of the sun
> of reality are reflected therein. This is the ultimate
> degree of human perfection, for the attainment of
> which the thinkers and philosophers of all time have
> longed and poets have dreamed; it is the mystery of
> mysteries and the light of lights wherein the spirit
> become eternal, self-subsistent, age-abiding. (ADP 161-2)
And finally He describes (Tablets 1:195) the condition of a
person who receives inspiration from the Holy Spirit:

> A real, spiritual connection between the True One and
> the servant is a luminous bounty which causeth an
> ecstatic … flame, passion and attraction. When this
> connection is secured … such an ecstasy and happiness
> become manifest in the heart that man doth fly away
> (with joy) and uttereth melody and song. Just as the
> soul bringeth the body in motion, so that spiritual
> bounty and real connection likewise moveth (or
> cheereth) the human soul.
Shoghi Effendi explains, in a letter written on his behalf on
25 January 1943, that inspiration ‘can be received through
meditation’ and that ‘God can inspire into our minds things
that we had no previous knowledge of, if He desires to do so’
(in Compilation 2:241, no.1771). He also makes clear, in a letter
written on his behalf on 19 November 1945, that ‘we cannot say
that any inspiration which a person, not knowing Bahá’u’lláh,
or not believing in God, receives is merely from his own ego’ (in
Compilation 2: 241, no.1774).

A key to a better understanding of the guidance given by
‘Abdu’l-Bahá as to inspiration may be found in the following
Tablet (Tablets 3:669):

> Know, that the pure hearts upon which the mysteries of
> the Kingdom of God are printed and pictured, are

> reflections one upon another and thus the one can
> discover the secrets of the other, because such hearts
> are only mirrors confronting each other on which the
> secrets of unity, affinity and concord are printed and
> reflected. Accordingly, it would be possible that a
> certain servant of the servants of the Merciful might
> discover a treasured mystery or a preserved sign,
> whatever his shortcomings or defects might be; yet we
> do indeed rely upon God the Forgiver. I supplicate Him
> to deliver us from the pangs of lust and its dangers and
> from the destructive conditions of passion.
‘Abdu’l-Bahá uses in this Tablet the versatile metaphor of
light and mirrors. He describes human hearts as mirrors
capable of reflecting ‘the mysteries of the Kingdom of God’
(ibid.) and light may be reflected from a heart to another one.
Although, ‘it would be possible that a certain servant of the
servants of the Merciful might discover a treasured mystery or
a preserved sign, whatever his shortcomings or defects might
be’ (ibid.), however, the light’s ‘appearance in every mirror is
conditioned by the colour of that mirror’ (CC 3:19, no. 22). And
thus it is better for a seeker trying to be delivered ‘from the
pangs of lust and its dangers and from the destructive
conditions of passion’ (TAB 3:669). Then his heart will be ‘moved
by the fragrance of the love of God’, and his ‘memory’ will be ‘a
fountain overflowing with the water of the knowledge of God’,
and he will be able to express ideas whereby ‘the breast of the
believers may be refreshed and dilated with joy’ (ibid.). In other
words, the seeker’s struggle toward spiritual perfection is the
soundest guarantee that his words and actions may be inspired
and thus capable of inspiring her fellow-beings with noble ideas
and feelings. As ‘Abdu’l-Bahá wrote in a Tablet to Y. Dawud:

> ‘O God quicken me with the breaths of the Holy Spirit.’
> For that which contains the fulfilment of all human
> inspiration, for that which we supplicate in words is
> the breath of the Holy Spirit. Verily, it changeth the
> earthly man into a heavenly one, the materialist into a
> spiritual being, the unenlightened into a reflection of
> the divine, and the satanic man into a godly person. It
> maketh the blind to see and quickeneth the dead. (quoted
> in Rabb 100)
A seeker is inspired mainly whenever she relies on the
guidance vouchsafed by the Manifestation of God:

> Man is said to be the greatest representative of God,
> and he is the Book of Creation because all the mysteries
> of beings exist in him. If he comes under the shadow of
> the True Educator and is rightly trained, he becomes
> the essence of essences, the light of lights, the spirit of
> spirits; he becomes the center of the divine
> appearances, the source of spiritual qualities, the
> rising-place of heavenly lights, and the receptacle of
> divine inspirations (ilhámát). If he is deprived of this
> education, he becomes the manifestation of satanic
> qualities, the sum of animal vices, and the source of all
> dark conditions. (SAQ 236, ch.64, para.4)

Attaining the Bounty of the Holy Spirit

Since the only way to attain certitude is through the bounty
of the Holy Spirit, it is very important for a seeker to know
how to attain it. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá mentions in Some Answered
Questions ‘the state in which one should be to seriously search
for the truth … the condition of seeking’ (38, ch.10, paras.11,
12).

> … the seeker must be endowed with certain qualities.
> First of all, he must be just and severed from all else
> save God; his heart must be entirely turned to the
> supreme horizon; he must be free from the bondage of
> self and passion, for all these are obstacles.
> Furthermore, he must be able to endure all hardships.
> He must be absolutely pure and sanctified, and free
> from the love or the hatred of the inhabitants of the
> world. Why? because the fact of his love for any person
> or thing might prevent him from recognizing the truth
> in another, and, in the same way, hatred for anything
> might be a hindrance in discerning truth.
His words are quite concise, however they are supported by
many explanations of this issue given in the Bahá’í Writings.
This literature include in the first place the five paragraphs in
the Kitáb-i-ˆqán improperly known as ‘Tablet of the True
Seeker’ (KI 192-8, paras.213-18; KMI 148-53), in the second
place the Valley of Search in the Seven Valleys, in the third place
the passages in Gems of Divine Mysteries where the Garden of
Search is described, and also the Law˙-i-A˙mad bih Fársí, a
Tablet written in Adrianople describing ‘the path of faith and
belief’ (Taherzadeh, Revelation 2:137-8). This Tablet is almost

completely translated into English by Shoghi Effendi in
Gleanings (322-9, nos. CLII and CLIII; see Muntakhabátí 207-
11). ‘Abdu’l-Bahá dwelt on the same subject in His talk
delivered on 26 May 1912 at Mount Morris Baptist Church,
Fifth Avenue and 126th Street, New York, published in English
in Promulgation 147-50 on notes taken by Esther Foster and in
Persian in Khá†ábát 394-400:

> Behold how the sun shines upon all creation, but only
> surfaces that are pure and polished can reflect its glory
> and light. The darkened soul has no portion of the
> revelation of the glorious effulgence of reality; and the
> soil of self, unable to take advantage of that light, does
> not produce growth … Therefore, man must seek
> capacity (isti’dád) and develop readiness (qábilíyyat).
> As long as he lacks susceptibility (isti’dád va qábilíyyat)
> to divine influences, he is incapable of reflecting the
> light and assimilating its benefits … We must make the
> soil of our hearts receptive and fertile by tilling in
> order that the rain of divine mercy may refresh them
> and bring forth roses and hyacinths of heavenly
> planting. We must have perceiving eyes (chasm-i-bíná)
> in order to see the light of the sun … (PUP 148-9, Khá†ábát
> 397-8)
This ‘capacity’ or ‘readiness’ can be attained in several ways.

Some individuals derive ‘infinite significance and wisdom
from the Book of Divine Revelation (kitáb-i-va˙íyy-i-iláhí), and
… draw inspiration (ilhám) from the unseen world of God
(ghaybí-i-rabbání)’, (‘Abdu’l-Bahá, Secret 58, Risálih 68). Other
make ‘mention of the name of … [their] Lord’ and ‘the hosts of
Divine inspiration …descend upon … [them] from the heaven of
… [His] name, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise’ (Bahá’u’lláh,
Gleanings 280 sec.129, para.3). Still others ‘for the sake of God,
arise to serve His Cause’ and thus become ‘the recipients of
divine inspiration from the unseen Kingdom’ (Bahá’u’lláh,
‘Bishárát’ 27, ‘Ishráqát’ 129).
‘Abdu’l-Bahá describes such a ‘ready’ soul as follows:

> This is what is meant by the Qur’ánic verse: ‘… whose
> oil would well nigh shine out, even though fire touched
> it not! It is light upon light’. That is, this oil is so fully
> prepared, so ready to be lit, that it almost catches fire
> of itself, though no flame be at hand; which means that
> the capacity for faith, and the deserving it, can be so

> great, that without the communication of a single
> word the light shines forth. (MF 77)
The result of this kind of search and effort made according to
this guidance and blessed by the bounty of the Holy Spirit is
described as

> gain[ing] a true knowledge of your own selves — a
> knowledge which is the same as the comprehension of
> Mine own Being. Ye would find yourselves independent
> of all else but Me, and would perceive, with your inner
> and outer eye, and as manifest as the revelation of My
> effulgent Name, the seas of My loving-kindness and
> bounty moving within you. (GWB 326, CLIII, para.6)

Enlightenment and Certitude

Having obtained the bounty of the Holy Spirit, a seeker will
be able to attain enlightenment and certitude. Certitude is a
kind of knowledge quite different from the ‘assured’
knowledge, pursued by the Western man, relying on his senses,
his intellect, sometimes his insight, without striving to attain
the bounty of the Holy Spirit. This kind of knowledge,
described enlightenment and certitude, is the discovery of the
image of God in oneself, a discovery that becomes manifest as
the capacity of expressing the Names of God, in the form of
thoughts, feelings, words and actions.

Enlightenment and Certitude and Fulfilling the
Purpose of One’s Life

Attaining enlightenment and certitude is a fundamental
prerequisite in view of fulfilling the purpose of one’s life and of
becoming an efficient servant of the Cause of God. ‘Abdu’l-
Bahá explains the first verse of the Kitáb-i-Aqdas as follows:

> good actions alone, without the knowledge of God,
> cannot be the cause of eternal salvation, everlasting
> success, and prosperity, and entrance into the
> Kingdom of God. (SAQ 238, ch.65, para.4)
He also says:

> if to the knowledge of God is joined the love of God,
> and attraction, ecstasy and goodwill, a righteous
> action is then perfect and complete. Otherwise, though

> a good action is praiseworthy, yet if it is not sustained
> by the knowledge of God, the love of God, and a sincere
> intention, it is imperfect. (SAQ 302, ch.84, para.7)
We may conclude that the entire course of our life should be
an unrelenting search after such conditions as will make us
ready to receive, through a correct use of the four instruments
of knowledge as well as of our willpower, the bounties of the
Holy Spirit so that we may fulfill the purpose of our lives.
