Bounded Religious Communities’
Management of the Challenge of New
Media: Baha’í Negotiation with the Internet
The negotiation of new forms of media by religious groups is a dynamic and
complex process that involves decision-making engaging the history, tradition
and beliefs of the community. This negotiation process is especially complex
for bounded religious communities, which establish rigid social and value-
laden boundaries allowing them to create and maintain a unique and separate
cultural system. Observing how members of bounded religious communities in-
teract with the Internet enables us to consider how some groups resist the fluid-
ity of networked relations and instead use technology to maintain closed social
structures and solidify their unique identities. This is clearly seen in the case of
the Bahá’í faith, especially in the patterns of use and limits American Bahá’ís
have developed to engage with the Internet. By using the Religious Social Shap-
ing of Technology approach, developed by Campbell (2010), as a lens to explore
the challenges and choices made by the Bahá’ís, this process of technological ne-
gotiation is unpacked.

1 Bounded religious community and new media
Bounded community is a term used to describe groups who live within a fixed
geographic region and/or possess strict ideological boundaries limiting their en-
gagement with outside groups. It has also been used to as a way to discuss ten-
sions that arise between groups attempting to maintain tight identity structures
in light of the increasingly permeable social boundaries of a networked society.
Describing a group as a bounded community can be challenging. In one sense
all communities are bounded, in that all communities possess certain bounda-
ries related to their quintessential characteristics, such as membership, identity
or locality. In the 1980s, identifying a group as a bounded community within the
sociology of community studies became a way to distinguish traditional com-
munities constrained by geography and familial small-scale relations with
more contemporary notions of community as a network of social relations
where boundaries are permeable (Wellman 1979; 1988). It also draws on the no-
tion that all communities are symbolically constructed, and their identity forma-
tion and presentation is based on varying degrees of boundary maintenance in

order to maintain the desired continuity of community (Cohen 1965). Bounded
communities thus become a way to talk about certain normative inclinations
of groups, such as constraints forming the basis for identity construction, organ-
ization and control of people, materials and territories (Linklater 1988: 133).

The notion of a bounded community is important when considering certain
forms of religious community. It is useful as it denotes those religious groups
which seek to live within a constrained social and cultural system that seeks
to resist the forces and patterns of life within modern networked society. In
this chapter the concept of the bounded community draws attention to the
fact that some religious groups actively seek to mark out and protect their iden-
tities in a cultural milieu that encourages fluidity of identity and relations over
static and controlled ones.

Researchers have found that the ambiguity and fluidity of postmodern cul-
ture encourages the creation of hybrid or blended cultural spaces among
many groups that were traditionally tightly-knit groups, such as ethnic minori-
ties (e. g., Waldinger 2007). This ambiguity is accentuated by the social affordan-
ces of digital technology that can make it difficult to retain a cohesive identity
structure. Increasingly, religious community leaders struggle to monitor the prac-
tices and interactions of their members with external sources, as the Internet can
make it easier for members to bypass traditional gatekeepers and channels of
control (Livio and Teneboim 2007). This struggle raises provocative questions
about how new media technologies such as the Internet are impacting commun-
ity authority and power relations, especially conservative and fundamentalist
groups’ negotiation with the Internet (Howard 2000; Shandler 2009). In order
to carefully consider how bounded communities negotiate new media usage
we turn to the social shaping of technology, which we argue provides a clear
frame for studying this phenomenon.

2 The social shaping of technology as a frame for

understanding media appropriation
One way to approach how bounded communities negotiate their use of new
media technologies is through the lens of the social shaping of technology.
This approach frames technology as a product of the interplay between different
technical and social factors in both design and use (MacKenzie and Wajcman
2001). Technology use and creation is seen as a social process. Social groups
shape technologies towards their own ends rather than the character of a tech-
nology determining its use and outcomes. Scholars taking this approach exam-

ine how social processes within a particular group influence user negotiations
with different technologies. It acknowledges that groups employ a given technol-
ogy in distinctive ways, so a group’s technology use is unique, and their appro-
priation reinforces valued patterns of community life or practice.

In order to understand how religious communities and individuals negotiate
their choices related to new forms of media technology, it is necessary to study
these groups’ choices in relation to religious norms and social factors which
guide their technological decision-making. This is referred to as the religious-so-
cial shaping of technology approach, which attempts to give an account of the
specific conditions influencing a community of users’ negotiations with a tech-
nology that can lead to changes in use or belief within a given social context.
It also attempts to explain responses to new technology in socio-technological
terms. In other words, the success, failure or redesign of a given technology
by a specific group of users is based not simply on the innate qualities of the
technology but on the ability of users to socially construct the technology in
line with the moral economy of the user community or context. It recognises
that individuals and groups of actors within particular social situations see
their choices and options constrained by broader structural elements of their
worldview and belief system.

3 The religious-social shaping of technology

approach to media
Based on extensive online and offline ethnographic research regarding how var-
ious religious user communities engage media technology, it has been observed
that religious communities typically do not reject new forms of technology out-
right, even if the communities they come from are highly bounded or controlled
groupings. Rather, they undergo a sophisticated negotiation process to deter-
mine what effect technology may have on their community. If a religious com-
munity sees a new technology as valuable but notes its use may promote beliefs
or behaviours that run counter to their community’s values, the group must care-
fully consider what aspects of that technology must be resisted. This resistance
often leads to the reconstruction of the technology regarding either how it is
used or discussed within the community. It may even lead to innovation,
where technical aspects or structures are modified so that they are more in
line with the community’s social and religious life. The religious-social shaping
of technology approach is offered as a way to investigate and analyse the prac-
tical and ideological negotiation process these communities undergo. This ap-

proach is outlined in detail in the text When Religion Meets New Media (Campbell
2010) and involves scholars employing four levels of examination in relation to
the specific group being studied: (1) the history and tradition of the community,
(2) its core beliefs and patterns related to media, (3) the specific negotiation proc-
esses it undergoes with a new technology, and finally (4) the communal framing
and discourses created by them, which are used to define and justify the extent
of their technology use and the way they will or will not engage certain media.
Together, these form the basis of the religious-social shaping of technology the-
oretical approach to the study of religious communities’ use of media, which is
described below.

As suggested, taking a religious-social shaping of technology approach be-
gins with studying the history and tradition of a given religious community in re-
lation to their media use. Here, researchers start by carefully considering the his-
torical context of the specific religious community under study to see how a
religious community’s positions toward and use of different media have emerged
over time and what decisions or events in the community history might have
shaped these decisions. It is important to note that decisions made regarding
texts, one of the earliest forms of media, often serve as a template for future ne-
gotiation with other media. In this phase of study, researchers should pay atten-
tion to how history and tradition form standards and a trajectory for future
media negotiations.

This leads to investigating religious communities’ core beliefs and patterns,
where attention is paid to how these specific communities live out their core so-
cial values. It is important to note that while beliefs are often derived from a his-
torically grounded tradition, they must always be contextualised and applied
anew to the social, cultural and historic context in which a given community
finds itself. Researchers should identify how a community’s dominant social
and religious values are integrated into patterns of contemporary life and how
these might influence their interactions with contemporary technologies. In an
age of digital technologies, close attention must be paid to how core beliefs
guide communal decision-making processes related to media use and what pat-
terns of use this encourages and discourages.

These two areas set the stage for the study of the negotiation process that re-
ligious communities undergo when faced with a new form of media. Religious
communities must consider in what respect the new form of media mirrors
past technologies so that old rules can be applied. If qualities, outcomes or so-
cial conditions created by the technology are problematic in any way for the
group, the community must enter into a rigorous negotiation process to see
what aspects of the technology can be accepted and which ones might need
to be rejected or reconstructed.

Bounded Religious Communities’ Management of the Challenge of New Media       189

Innovation takes place if a technology is viewed as valuable but possesses
problematic qualities requiring it to be altered in order to be more in line with
community beliefs and practices. Researchers consider how the previous phases
inform a community’s choices and responses to the new technology when con-
sidering the ways in which a new technology is accepted, rejected and/or recon-
structed. Key to this stage is the community’s positions towards authority roles
and structures, which can indicate who has the right to govern media decision-
making processes and involvement in innovation.

Finally, attention must be paid to communal framing and discourse resulting
from the adoption of the new media form. This is a stage often overlooked in
studies of the social-shaping of technology, yet it plays an important role for re-
ligious communities in their internal justification for their approach to new
media. Researchers should consider how new technologies may require amend-
ments to previous language about media or how official policies regarding tech-
nology are constructed and publicized. The negotiation and adoption of new
technologies requires the religious group to create public and private discourses
that validate their technology choices in light of established community bounda-
ries, values and identities. The communal discourse can also serve as tool for re-
affirming traditions and past standards as well as for setting a new trajectory for
the future use or negotiation of technology. Thus, it is important for researchers
to pay attention to the language used by a religious community to frame technol-
ogy and prescribe communal use. Together, these four levels of inquiry make up
the religious-social shaping of technology approach to show how multiple social
and structural processes influence religious groups’ responses to new media.

4 Negotiation between the Baha’i faith and the

Internet
Investigating the American Bahá’í community shows the complex process reli-
gious groups undergo in their negotiations with new forms of media. This exami-
nation of their history, tradition, core beliefs and reactions to older forms of
media provides a clear basis for understanding this religious group’s current re-
sponse to the Internet.

4\.1 History and tradition

The negotiation of new forms of media by religious groups is a dynamic and
complex process that begins with reflection on the religious history, tradition
and beliefs of the group. In the case of the Bahá’í faith, it is important to consid-
er how this history has directly affected the negotiation process that practicing
Bahá’ís in America have with the Internet. The Bábí movement began in 1844
in the city of Shiraz, located in south-western Iran. In this year, Sayyid ‘Ali Mu-
hammad declared having had ‘some sort of extraordinary relationship with the
Hidden Imam’ (Cole 1990: 3). The Hidden Imam, or Mahdi, is believed to be the
redeemer or messiah by Shi’a Muslims and is believed to help restore order and
peace to the world. Sayyid ’Ali Muhammad, also known as the Báb, was seen as
a divine messenger (similar to Moses, Muhammad, Jesus, etc.) by his followers
and remains the central figure of the Bahá’í faith. According to Cole, members
of the Bábí movement believed the Báb was ‘the return of the Imam Mahdi him-
self, and he asserted that divine inspiration led him to reveal a new holy book
abrogating the Quran’ (1990: 3). The belief that the Báb was the manifestation
of the Hidden Imam to return and their ‘abrogation’ of the Qur’an were problem-
atic to many practising Muslims and led to the persecution of the individuals as-
sociated with the Bábí movement in the nineteenth century. According Adam
Berry (2004: 1), the Bábí movement was met with much resistance, as shown
by the execution of the Báb in1850. Further proof of persecution can be seen
by the number of followers killed between 1849 and the mid-1850s. Around
5,000 followers were killed during that period, in which the adherents to the
movement numbered 100,000 (Cole 1990: 3). After the death of the Báb, Mirza
Husayn ‘Ali, the successor of the Báb, adopted the Bahá’í name in an attempt
unify the members and survive persecution in Iran. Not only would this history
of persecution affect the way Bahá’ís view media, it would also help shape the
faith’s core beliefs and where these beliefs would be practised.

In an attempt to escape the persecution prevalent in Iran, many Bahá’ís
moved to new areas in an attempt to practise their religion peacefully. With
the idea of the Bahá’í faith symbolising ‘threatening aspects of modernity’ in
Iran, Bahá’ís looked to the western world for new opportunities (Cole 1990: 7).
From the 1970s to the mid-1980s, around 12,000 Iranian Bahá’ís emigrated to
the US to escape persecution, taking advantage of the religious freedom in Amer-
ica. With this migration of Iranian Bahá’ís, the US Bahá’í community grew from
10,000 to about 48,000 individuals with confirmed addresses, or ‘sure members’
(Cole 1998: 238). According to Juan Cole, this growth can be explained by ‘the
impact of the civil rights movements, the Vietnam War, the youth counterculture’

Bounded Religious Communities’ Management of the Challenge of New Media               191

(Cole 1998: 236). Currently, there are around 60,000 practising Bahá’ís in the US,¹
and many rely on the Internet to stay connected to the faith. This idea will be ex-
plored in depth in the media use negotiation section.

It is also important to note that, as the Baha’i faith emerged out of Shi’a
Islam in Iran, these roots and connections in some respects have informed the
faith. Scholars have noted a connection between the Baha’i and the Shiite move-
ments, in that both draw from esoteric and charismatic roots, have a defined hi-
erarchical structure of gatekeepers and represent conservative traditions with a
certain degree of secrecy in relation to religious knowledge (Warburg 1999).
These tendencies can also be seen in their dealings with the spread of informa-
tion, both inside and outside the community, and their position toward media,
as discussed in the following sections. Before moving on to how members of
the Bahá’í faith currently negotiate their relationship with the media, it is vital
to address the core beliefs and the religion’s relationship to authority. According
to the official Bahá’í Website of the United States, the purpose of life is to ‘wor-
ship God, to acquire virtues, and to promote the oneness of humankind’ (2010).
These beliefs directly influence the Bahá’ís’ relationship with other religions
which strive for religious universalism. Furthermore, Bahá’ís advocate for service
to humanity while maintaining a peaceful and pacifist nature. In relation to so-
cial principles, Bahá’ís desire the equality of men and women, universal educa-
tion and the abandonment of all forms of prejudice. The final factor that directs
how the media is treated by practising Bahá’ís is seen in the administrative order
of the Bahá’ís community. The formation of an individual order of adherence to a
hierarchy occurred in 1921 after the death of Abbás Effendi, who was the son of
the first successor to the Báb (Cole 1990: 3). Examples of how these structure the
hierarchy of the Bahá’ís community and inform their view of media are explored
in greater detail in the next section.

4\.2 Media values and policies

Along with the history and tradition of the Bahá’í faith, the core values directly
lead to more unified policies towards the uses of media. In order to achieve such
beliefs as religious universalism and universal education, Bahá’ís thought it
would be important to make the transition from an individual order to an admin-

 According to the American Religious Identification Survey (ARIS 2004), there were an esti-
mated 84,000 adult Bahá’í members. The difference between these figures may be accounted for
in the word ‘practising’ as opposed to membership.

istrative order. An example of an administrative body in the Bahá’í faith is the
Universal House of Justice. Established in 1963, the Universal House of Justice
has guided and directed the activities of the global Bahá’í community for over
40 years. By educating followers on how to practise and live their faith, the Uni-
versal House of Justice determines which activities are permitted based on the
laws of Mirza Husayn ’Ali (the first successor of the Báb and founder of the
Bahá’í faith).

Even though the core values, beliefs and admiration of the Bahá’í faith are
related to the creation of the Universal House of Justice, the preceding history
and tradition of the Bahá’í faith have contributed to a strict media trajectory.
As mentioned above, many practicing Bahá’ís in Iran experienced heavy perse-
cution for their beliefs. Many viewed the western world as an opportunity to
practice their religion in peace and to educate others about the Bahá’í faith.
However, along with more rights and freedoms has come criticism of Bahá’í pol-
icies by Bahá’í followers in the western world. To counter these criticisms, the
Universal House of Justice has increased restrictions of certain types of media
usage. For example, through the use of National Spiritual Assemblies, which
are located throughout the Bahá’í world, the Universal House of Justice has cen-
sored or restricted material published by Bahá’ís. Cole states that the ‘National
Spiritual Assembly claims the prerogative of telling private Bahá’í publishers
what Bahá’í-related books they may or may not publish’. This shows the impor-
tance of the core Bahá’í belief of having ‘conformity of views and behavior’ and
how it has been directly challenged by the freedoms shared in the western world
(Cole 1998: 244).

In relation to this, the Universal House of Justice has not only produced strict
policies on media content but also on individuals who produce media content
that challenges existing Bahá’í policies. One of the mechanisms used by the Uni-
versal House of Justice to achieve unification and conformity is the threat of la-
belling someone a ‘covenant-breaker’. Basically, a person accused of covenant-
breaking has committed a form of heresy and is shunned by the practising com-
munity. One who even associates with a covenant-breaker can possibly be shun-
ned and not recognised by the community. This has led to Bahá’ís ‘informing’ the
House of Justice of individuals who undermine its policies. ‘The House of Justice
encourages Bahá’ís who hear something they think out of the ordinary to chal-
lenge the speaker to justify his or her statement with regard to the covenant’
(cited in Cole 1998: 244). This directly affects what kind of content can be pro-
duced and expressed through the media because of the fear of being labelled
a covenant-breaker.

The actions and policies created by the House of Justice reveal how the
Bahá’í faith negotiates and teaches the Bahá’í how to use media. Due to the

Bounded Religious Communities’ Management of the Challenge of New Media       193

availability of freedoms in the western world, the House of Justice took strong
stances against criticizing opinions expressed in the media. One mechanism ad-
dressed above was the use of labelling someone a covenant-breaker and how
this has led to an ‘informing’ culture by practicing Bahá’ís. ‘Although Baha’u’llah
(or Mirza Husayn ’Ali) himself attempted to abolish the practices of shunning’,
the House of Justice enforces these policies to achieve the core belief of unifica-
tion (Cole 1998: 243). The work of the House of Justice also sets standards for
media engagement, which guide Bahá’ís’ views about and uses of the Internet.
This media negotiation is explored in more detail in the third area of investiga-
tion.

4\.3 Media use negotiation

In order to understand how the history, tradition and core beliefs affect the
media use negotiation by the Bahá’í faith, it is important to focus in on a specific
community and media. Examining the Bahá’í faith community in America re-
veals how this specific branch of the Baha’i community negotiates its Internet
usage and how this has been informed by the Universal House of Justice. In
order to fully understand how the American Community of Bahá’ís use the Inter-
net, it is imperative to examine the Bahá’í Internet Agency. This agency was es-
tablished in 2004 by the Universal House of Justice, the legislative institution
and the highest governing body of the Bahá’í faith, and is under the auspices
of its International Teaching Centre. The Bahá’í Internet Agency (BIA) seeks to
advise and direct members of the Bahá’í faith on how to properly use the Internet
as well as offer assistance to the global community through technical support for
Bahá’í institutions and to support community-related online initiatives. The BIA
has also written a number of documents that provide members with specific
guidance about appropriate Internet use, such as blogging, podcasting and so-
cial networking (see BIA n.d.).

Bahá’ís in the United States currently have ‘official’ pages on Facebook, Twit-
ter, Beliefnet and PeaceNext where they post Bahá’í news as well as links to
blogs from various bloggers who discuss Bahá’í themes. The US Bahá’í Office
of Communications advocates the use of the Internet, yet this use is encouraged
or framed within certain constraints. One key emphasis of this office is to encour-
age community members to engage with the Internet in ways that affirm the be-
liefs and structures of the movement. They strongly advocate that members seek
information from web sites which are published and maintained by the official
organization and engage in dialogue in these contexts:

> Baha’is are encouraged to participate in a wide range of Internet initiatives carried out in
> light of Bahá’í principles such as moderation, courtesy, probity, fairness, dignity, accuracy
> and wisdom. Promoting mutual understanding, fellowship and a spirit of cooperation
> among diverse individuals and groups is an essential characteristic of all Bahá’í activity.

(US Bahá’í Office of Communications 2010)

A further examination of this agency reveals the restrictions Bahá’í faith mem-
bers in the US face while using the Internet. The Internet is an essential part of
any organisation in America due to the high number of users in this country. As
of December 2011, according to the Internet World Statistics (2011), the United
States has over 245,000,000 users (with a population penetration of 78.6 %), nu-
merically second only to China (penetration of 38.4 %), with over half-a-billion
users.

In order to understand how the Bahá’í Internet Agency has reconfigured the
usage of the Internet, it is important to examine which aspects of the Internet are
beneficial and which are problematic. One activity that seems to be deemed both
beneficial and problematic by the Bahá’í community in the US is the use of blog-
ging. According to the Bahá’í Internet Agency’s white paper on ‘Blogging and the
Bahá’í faith: suggestions and possible approaches’ (2006), blogging ‘offers op-
portunities to explore Bahá’í teachings’ and ‘opens new avenues for sharing
the message’ of the Bahá’í faith. Furthermore, the Agency advocates that ‘indi-
vidual blogging’ allows for a ‘community of interest to the Revelation and to
Bahá’í community activity’.

However, there are some aspects that the American Bahá’ís must reject with
regard to blogging, as outlined by the Bahá’í Internet Agency. One of the aspects
discouraged for practising Bahá’ís is the use of confrontational and negative dis-
cussion threads on the Internet. This includes any blog post that is seen to un-
dermine or challenge Bahá’í policies or beliefs, which is to be ignored/deleted. If
the blogger who makes negative claims happens to be a practising Bahá’í, he/she
can be labelled as a covenant-breaker and shunned by the community. Cole ex-
plains that ‘threats to use shunning’ have increased with ‘the rise of cyberspace’
(1998: 243). The Internet allows some members to post confidentially so other
practising Bahá’ís will not know who they are. In response to this, the Universal
House of Justice has encourage Bahá’ís to ‘inform’ them of members partaking in
these restricted actions. Such moves show how the Universal House of Justice
has reconfigured the Internet and encouraged certain actions to achieve the
core belief of unification and adherence to the given structure.

Another problematic aspect for followers of the Bahá’í faith that has
emerged on the Internet is the use of social networking sites in the US. Although
many social networking sites, such as Facebook, attempt to connect people from

around the world, there have been many concerns about the association of Ba-
há’ís with covenant-breakers. One specific example of this problematic activity is
outlined on truebahai.com (Weinberg 2008). According to the website, the Bahá’í
Internet Agency sent an e-mail out on 28 February 2008 to alert members to the
current activities of a specific covenant-breaker who ran an unauthorized ‘Ortho-
dox Bahá’í page on Facebook’, which was perceived to be threatening to the ‘spi-
ritual well-being’ of practising Bahá’í youth members (Weinburg 2008). What is
interesting is that simply accepting a friend request from this individual is seen
as a community violation, as being in association with a covenant-breaker (see
BIA n.d.). Through the Bahá’í Internet Agency, the meaning of a (cyber) friend-
ship on Facebook is redefined to be equivalent to a personal, face-to-face friend-
ship. This demonstrates how the Bahá’í must negotiate with online culture and
bring online communication in line with traditional religious practice and ex-
pectations of behaviour in order for the technology to fit comfortably within ac-
cepted community values.

4\.4 Communal discourse

Finally, religious communities often develop policies or guidelines that present
their official view or perceptions of the Internet and advocate particular uses.
The aim of this communal discourse regarding the Internet is not merely instruc-
tive for community members; it also serves as an identity narrative – to affirm
the values and boundaries of the community. In the case of the Bahá’í commun-
ity, the Universal House of Justice serves an important role in policing and offer-
ing prescriptive guidelines for media activity and has attempted to encourage
certain forms of Internet engagement so that members’ use will not undermine
Bahá’í policies and beliefs. A notable discourse has been produced through the
work of the Bahá’í Internet Agency, who provide information on how to use the
Internet through issuing a number of white papers on a variety of issues related
to online communication, as noted above.

A key role of the Bahá’í Internet Agency is to circulate official statements
about Internet communication issued by the Universal House of Justice. These
documents advocate a particular relationship between the Bahá’í community
and electronic, digital communication technologies, one which supports core
communal values, such as unity in diversity and service to humanity. The Inter-
net is framed as offering the community new opportunities and challenges, such
that the published and thus accepted wisdom of their religious leaders should be
consulted when making decisions regarding the Internet. As stated in the docu-
ment ‘Guidelines for Internet Communication’:

> The opportunity which electronic communication technology provides is for more speedy
> and thorough consultation among friends, and is highly significant. Without doubt, it rep-
> resents another manifestation of a development eagerly anticipated by the Guardian when
> he foresaw the creation of ‘a mechanism of world intercommunication […] embracing the
> whole planet, freed from national hindrances and restrictions, and functioning with mar-
> vellous swiftness and perfect regularity’. (BIA n.d.)

Official white papers also provide guidance to individual community members
seeking to use the Internet to represent their beliefs and the community online.
‘Members are to be mindful of how their online activities bear witness to the
Bahá’í faith’, according to the document ‘Individual initiative on the Internet’
(2007). It continues:

> Internet initiatives should of course be carried out in light of Bahá’í principles such as mod-
> eration, courtesy, probity, fairness, dignity, accuracy and wisdom [… T]he Internet is yet one
> more domain in which Bahá’ís should demonstrate etiquette of expression worthy of the
> approaching maturity of the human race – a maturity founded on the oneness and whole-
> ness of human relationships. (BIA 2007)

Thus, members are exhorted to reflect the community in a positive light through
mirroring core values. These white papers often emphasise core Bahá’í beliefs
and teachings of religious figures as a basis for online decision making. By re-
leasing statements such as the ones above, the Universal House of Justice at-
tempts to define how the Internet should be used by all practicing Bahá’ís (Uni-
versal House of Justice 1995). Such statements not only provide Bahá’ís with
guidelines for behaviour within specific online contexts but also affirm core val-
ues regarding how individuals should present their community identity in public
contexts. For example, individual Bahá’ís are not forbidden to be involved in un-
official forums, but these performances should reflect the character of the com-
munity.

In general, the House of Justice has no objection to Bahá’ís participating in
public, unmoderated discussions about the faith, whether those discussions take
place in person or through some form of electronic communication. The wisdom
of participating in particular discussions must, of necessity, depend upon cir-
cumstances prevailing at the time. When, through such discussions, the faith
is attacked or erroneous information about it is disseminated, it may become
necessary for individual Bahá’ís to actively defend it (BIA n.d.).

This is affirmed in a 2009 statement issued by the Bahá’í Internet Agency,
‘Responding to Criticism and Opposition on the Internet’, which states that
Bahá’í use of the Internet should reflect the teachings of Bahá’u’lláh:

> Internet initiatives by Bahá’ís should therefore aim to broaden vision concerning challeng-
> ing spiritual and social questions, shape discourse in a unifying way, and emphasize the
> potentialities and promise of the present moment in human affairs. When harnessed in
> this way, the Internet can become a vehicle for promoting mutual understanding and learn-

The U.S. Bahá’í Office of Communications also plays a role in framing the Inter-
net as an important sphere in which Bahá’ís are welcome to engage and offers
suggestions regarding how this should be done:

> The increasingly participatory nature of Internet activity is providing novel and creative
> ways of exploring the compelling message of spiritual and social transformation as taught
> by Bahá’u’lláh, the Founder of the Bahá’í Faith. Bahá’ís around the globe are using the In-
> ternet to give expression to the many facets of their belief in an open and imaginative man-
> ner, including on blogs and social networking sites. (US Bahá’í Office of Communications
> 2010)

However, this is a contextualised engagement, as evidenced by the documents
provided by the Universal House of Justice that give prescriptive instructions
on such topics as how Internet discussion related to issues of Bahá’í faith should
be maintained and moderated online as well as how Bahá’í members should be-
have online as representatives of the community in the online world. Thus, offi-
cial discourse regarding use of and engagement with the Internet serves as a
space to reiterate and strengthen the religious identity of the Bahá’í community.
Therefore community documents and policy statements such as those highlight-
ed here help reaffirm community distinctiveness and contribute to the construc-
tion or maintenance of a desired public image within the age of the Internet.

5 Reflections on a bounded community’s

management of new media
Undertaking these four levels of inquiry demonstrates that American Bahá’ís
have a distinctive negotiation with the Internet, which is guided by their core be-
liefs and the particular value of unity and which official sources seek to exem-
plify through their use of the Internet and how they encourage their members
to represent themselves online. Their strict adherence to a certain structure
and hierarchy within the offline structure of the community is in many respects
simply replicated and encouraged online. As has been shown in this brief explo-
ration, the Bahá’í community’s Universal House of Justice has attempted to re-

configure the usage and negotiation of the Internet in an effort to achieve ideo-
logical unification of motivations and practices in a context which blends the on-
line and offline contexts. Examples of this reconfiguration are evident in the cre-
ation of the Bahá’í Internet Agency, which seeks to direct practicing Bahá’ís on
how to properly use the Internet in relation to Bahá’í beliefs. Their white papers
not only provide guidelines for Internet use but also lead community members
back to the teachings of the Báb and therefore reaffirm core community beliefs
and frameworks. As the Bahá’í Internet Agency states, ‘The principles of our
Faith offer valuable guideposts in making use of the Internet. […] Bahá’ís need
to learn as much as possible about these new modes of interaction and deter-
mine how the principles of the Faith apply to their use’ (BIA 2006b).

This chapter also shows how a bounded religious community often seeks to
replicate traditional or accepted boundaries and practises of the larger commun-
ity online in order to solidify their established social patterns and behavioural
expectations. It is tradition and established understandings of the identity of a
community and authority structures which guide such groups’ engagement
with technology. The Internet can introduce new challenges for bounded com-
munities, in that it allows community members to interact outside official fo-
rums or systems that enhance individual choice over community accountability
or control. Therefore negotiation processes and discourse frameworks surround-
ing new media become important spaces for religious groups to consciously re-
establish the boundaries of the community and culture or resist and thence en-
counter problematic affordances of the technology. Religious groups desiring to
maintain a bounded social and moral system must carefully consider the extent
to which certain aspects of network culture may run counter to their desired pat-
tern of religious life. Bounded religious communities thus constrain members’
use so that it is both in line with community values and enhances desired struc-
tures or community identity markers. The religious-social shaping of technology
provides a valuable format to study and interrogate these processes of technolog-
ical negotiation and reveals the distinctiveness of a given religious community
that seeks to represent or promote itself in a modern, networked society.
