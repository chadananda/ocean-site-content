   R eligion and Exc lusivism : a Bahá’í
Per spective 1

Julio Savi

The term ‘exclusivism’ has been adopted in interfaith dialogue to
denote the attitude of those who maintain that only their religion is
true and that the others are false. In the past almost all organized
religions were mostly exclusivist, and even today several people
maintain that exclusivism is an intrinsic feature of religion.
However, a number of factors have created serious doubts about the
rational and moral legitimacy of exclusivism. In a Bahá’í perspective,
exclusivist ideas “today raise walls of separation and conflict in an
age when the earth has literally become one homeland and human
beings must learn to see themselves as its citizens.” (OCF 29) We
offer a preliminary examination of the Bahá’í teachings bearing on
exclusivism, according to our understanding of the open letter
addressed by the Universal House of Justice “To the World’s
Religious Leaders,” and of the commentary of this letter
commissioned by the Universal House of Justice itself published as a
booklet entitled One Common Faith.
Oneness of religion: a pivot of the Bahá’í Faith

Despite those who maintain that exclusivism is an intrinsic feature
of religion, Bahá’í Scriptures convey the opposite. Shoghi Effendi
summarizes the Bahá’í attitude towards other religions as follows:

> . . . religious truth is not absolute but relative . . . Divine
> Revelation is a continuous and progressive process ... all the
> great religions of the world are divine in origin ...their basic
> principles are in complete harmony . . . their aims and
> purposes are one and the same . . . their teachings are but
> facets of one truth . . . their functions are complementary . . .
> they differ only in the non-essential aspects of their
> doctrines and . .. their missions represent successive stages in
> the spiritual evolution of human society. (OCF 6)
This statement recapitulates the basic components of the Bahá’í
conception of the oneness of religions. Before examining each of
them we will suggest a provisional definition of religion in the light
of the Bahá’í teachings. Religion is the body of “the teachings of
the Lord God” (SWAB 52) revealed to humankind through a “Perfect
Man,” whom Bahá’í Scriptures call a Manifestation of God, because
as a “clear and polished mirror” he manifests the “Essence of
Divinity” (SAQ 114). Those teachings, mainly expounded in a body

222          Religion and Exclusivism

of Scripture, are both old and new. They are old because they are
connected with other messages previously sent by God. They are
new, because they signalize the beginning of a new age in the Divine
Revelation. On the one hand, they describe “the essential connection
which proceeds from the realities of things” (SAQ 158) and therefore
they are “the essence and the fundamentals of philosophy” (TB 145)
and “in conformity with science and reason” (SAQ 299). On the
other, they are “a reflection of . . . [God’s] Will” (GWB 338), whose
“fundamental basis is love” (TAB 3:729-30), and therefore they are
“the channel of love unto all peoples” (SWAB 36). At the personal
level, those teachings have the power to guide whoever puts in
practice them to the acquisition and praxis of the divine virtues,
especially that of love with its consequences of unity, fellowship and
peace among human beings. Therefore they lead any sincere believer
to the highest possible level of spirituality2 in that period of human
collective development. At the collective level, they are “the cause
of oneness among men, and the means of unity and love” (SWAB 28).
Therefore they also are “the chief instrument for the establishment
of order in the world and of tranquility amongst its peoples” (TB 63-
4). One Common Faith synthetically states that religion is “the
principal force impelling the development of consciousness” (OCF
23), “discerns and articulates the values unfolding progressively
through Divine revelation . . . [and] defines goals that serve the
evolutionary process” (OCF 33).

This definition underlines three basic elements of religion: a foun-
dational Figure, characterized by a special relation with the Divine;
his teachings, which creatively generate spirituality in human beings,
with its consequences of unity and peace among human beings; and
Scripture, that is, one or more Books containing those teachings. It
is offered only as a possible description, in the light of the Bahá’í
teachings, of “all the great religions of the world” (OCF 6), giving to
the word “great” not certainly worldly connotations of numerical
strength, geographical diffusion or earthly power, but a connotation
of spiritual greatness worthy of a teaching capable of leading human
beings to spirituality. According to the Bahá’í teachings these
religions are “Hinduism, Buddhism, Zoroastrianism, Judaism, Christ-
ianity, Islam, and the religion of the Sabeans,” as well as the Bahá’í
and the Bábí religions.3 The foundational Figures of these religions
may be best described, in the words of One Common Faith, “as the
spiritual Educators of history, as the animating forces in the rise of
the civilizations through which consciousness has flowered” (OCF 34).
I. “ Re ligious truth is not absolute but re lativ e”

This proposition does not imply that the Manifestations of God
are not endowed with “omniscience,” but that they reveal to human-
kind only that part of their knowledge which humankind is able to

Lights of ‘Irfán Book Seven          223

understand in that stage of its evolution on earth. It can be put into
perspective in the light of two fundamental Bahá’í conceptions. The
first is that conception whereby “[w]hatsoever in the contingent
world can either be expressed or apprehended, can never transgress
the limits which, by its inherent nature, have been imposed upon it”
(SLH 35). The second is Bahá’u’lláh’s principle of “the continuity of
Divine Revelation” (GWB 151) and “the progressiveness of religious
experience” (PDC 108), which will be now explained.
II. “Divine Revelation is a continuous and progressive process”

This concept is known among the Bahá’ís as “progressive
Revelation” (GWB 75). Bahá’í Scriptures mention a pre-eternal
Covenant between God and humankind, established by God Himself
out of His bounty. This Covenant provides that God pledge to look
after the spiritual development of human beings and human beings
pledge to do His will on earth. Therefore God periodically reveals
His will through His Manifestations. They reveal to humankind “an
ever-increasing measure of His truth, of His inscrutable will and
Divine guidance” (WOB 118), according to ever-evolving human
capacities of understanding and accomplishment. Human beings are
required to make a good use of their “understanding,” which has
been given to them so that they may “discern the truth in all things,”
be lead “to that which is right” and “discover the secrets of creation”
(GWB 194). They will thus be enabled to recognize the divine station
of the Manifestations of God, to understand and accept their divine
verities, to abide by their divine guidance and to accomplish the
divine will as they manifest it. Thus they obtain personal and
collective spirituality.

The concept of progressive revelation explains the multiplicity of
religions and of their teachings. It is in contradiction with the claims
of “uniqueness” or “finality” of other religions, but it does not
“dwarf the admitted magnitude of their colossal achievements,” nor
“detract one jot or one tittle from the influence they exert or the
loyalty they inspire.” On the contrary, it contributes to “widen their
basis . . . [and] to reconcile their aims” (WOB 114), in the awareness
that their followers abide by the teachings of historically different
Personages, who are, however, all united to one another in their
common mission as “Educator[s] of mankind” (KI 58). The concept
of progressive revelation also implies that the content of the verities
revealed by each Manifestation depends on the maturity which
humankind has attained through the education it received from all
past Manifestations and because of passing time, and not on any
intrinsic superiority of any one among the Manifestations over the
other. Therefore this concept implies that no religion has “a superior
merit” (WOB 60) than the other ones, because its features only
depend on the receptivity of the age in which it was revealed. One

224          Religion and Exclusivism

Common Faith warns: “To presume to judge among the Messengers
of God, exalting one above the other, would be to give in to the
delusion that the Eternal and All-Embracing is subject to the
vagaries of human preference” (OCF 20).
III. “All the great religions of the world are divine in origin”

This concept could be wrongly interpreted as a forerunner of
pluralism, as formulated by John H. Hick, Wilfred Cantwell Smith
and others. On the contrary, paraphrasing Hick’s definition of
pluralism, this proposition states that the great religious traditions of
the world represent different human perceptions of and response to
the revelation sent, in different forms in different historical ages, by
the same infinite divine Reality. And thus the two propositions are
virtual opposites: pluralist philosophers, who adopt the humanistic
point of view, stress the different human responses to “the same
infinite divine Reality.” Bahá’í Scriptures, with their spiritual
conception of the nature of reality, also stress the different forms of
the various revelations sent by “the same infinite divine Reality.”

The Universal House of Justice remarks in its message “To the
World’s religious Leaders” that the concept that “the truth
underlying all religions is in its essence one” is accepted in the world
by many people “as an intuitive awareness born from the ever
widening experience of others and from a dawning acceptance of
the oneness of the human family itself,” and augurs that “this
diffuse and still tentative perception” may “consolidate itself and
contribute effectively to the building of a peaceful world” through
“the wholehearted confirmation of those to whom, even at this late
hour, masses of the earth’s population look for guidance” (4). One
Common Faith points out the responsibility of the Bahá’ís of
bringing the “recognition of this reality” to “operate at the heart of
religious discourse” (OCF ii) and thus the importance of reflecting on
this issue. The Bahá’í teachings offer a number of reflections from
which one may deduce that all the “great” religions are divine in
origin. The most important are: their capacity for creating
spirituality in their sincere followers; their capacity for creating
civilization; their capacity for becoming established in the world
notwithstanding the initial opposition that most of them must face;
their capacity, once established, for surviving and enduring far into
the future; and the universality of their basic principles. The first
two reflections are shared by some modern thinkers. For example,
Hick writes that all “the great traditions . . . seem to be more or less
equally productive of the outstanding individuals whom we call
saints” (7). And Arnold J. Toynbee writes that the “higher religions”
are “the chrysalis from which a new civilization eventually emerges”
(13). As to the capacity of becoming established and enduring far
into the future, it has been anticipated by Jesus, who said: “Every

Lights of ‘Irfán Book Seven         225

plant, which my heavenly Father hath not planted, shall be rooted
up” (Matthew 15:13). As to the universality of their basic principles,
this concept will be now explained.
IV. “Their basic principles are in complete harmony”

‘Abdu’l-Bahá explains the reasons for this proposition. Given
that the Founders of the “great” religions are Manifestations of God
and that God is “the Truth” (TB 3:704), then “whatever emanates
from Them is identical with the truth, and conformable to reality”
(SAQ 173). Since “reality is one and cannot admit of multiplicity”
(SWAB 298), we may conclude that the “foundations of the Religion
of God . . . are irremovable and eternal” (SAQ 48). ‘Abdu’l-Bahá
mentions a number of “all-universal and all-inclusive” “principles”
(SWAB 69), which He defines as the “foundations of the Religion of
God” (SAQ 48). These principles may be listed under at least five
different categories.4
1\. Knowledge

Religions teach a particular kind of “knowledge (‘irfán),”5 which
is an experiential mystical knowledge. This knowledge comprises
“the knowledge ( ma‘rifat) of God” (‘Abdu’l-Bahá, Mufáva∂át 209,
SAQ 300), “the knowledge ( ma‘rifat) of the Manifestations of God”
(Mufáva∂át 106, SAQ 222), and the discovery of “inner truths and
mysteries” (SWAB 271). Bahá’u’lláh states that God is unknowable
and that to know God, which is the purpose of human life (GWB 70),
means “to recognize (ma‘rifat) His Manifestation. ” ( K I 1 45) As to
the meaning of this “knowledge” or “recognition” of the
Manifestation of God, it also is intended as the experiential
knowledge of one’s potential divine qualities and of “inner truths
and mysteries” (SWAB 271) attained through one’s obedience to the
divine will, as revealed by His Manifestation, because of one’s love
for Him (cf. KI 100-2). ‘Abdu’l-Bahá explains that the teachings
revealed by the Manifestations of God “are the reflex [reflections]
on this plane of the divine laws, and they become the medium for
transmuting the thought of man into his reality” (‘Abdu’l-Bahá on
Christ and Christianity, 10). And thus we come to another basic
principle of religions.
2\. Spiritual awakening

‘Abdu’l-Bahá explains that “the knowledge of God” (SAQ 300)
and the discovery of “inner truths and mysteries” (SWAB 271) —
attained through one’s obedience to the will of God, as revealed by
His Manifestation, because of one’s love for Him — awaken,
through “the breaths of the Holy Spirit” (SWAB 10), the “spiritual
perfections” (SAQ 194) of human beings, and their “intuitive
knowledge” (SAQ 157). This spiritual awakening brings about their

226            Religion and Exclusivism

“second birth” (TDP 95), or detachment “from the world of nature”
(SWAB 304), that is, “spirituality” (SAQ 235), or “spiritual progress”
(SAQ 300), which implies the acquisition of “the virtues and
perfections which adorn the reality of man” (SAQ 223).
3\. Love and oneness, faith and certitude

These qualities stand out among the virtues acquired by human
beings through their spiritual awakening. As to love, it becomes
manifest as “love of God” (SAQ 47) and “love of all mankind” (TB
138). Its highest expression is “universal love” (SWAB 20), typical of
those who have recognized the oneness of humankind. As to
oneness, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá describes in the Tablets of the Divine Plan
several “collective centers,” conducive to “association and unity
between the children of men” (TDP 93). He lists as first “patriotism ...
nationalism . . . identity of interests . . . political alliance . . . the union of
ideals ...the cultural and intellectual collective center” (93). Although
they may produce “prosperity of the world of humanity,” they are
“temporary and not everlasting” (93). The greatest “collective center”
is that “of the sacred religions” (97), that is, “the body of the divine
teachings, which include all the degrees and embrace all the universal
relations and necessary laws of humanity” (94). This “Divine
Collective Center” (97), which is “eternal,” “overcomes and includes
all the other collective centers” (93), because, through “the celestial
potency of the Word of God” (95), it “organizes the oneness of the
world of humanity, and destroys the foundation of differences” (93).
In one of His talks, dealing with “the subject of unity,” ‘Abdu’l-
Bahá also described two higher “expressions of unity,” mentioned in
the Bahá’í Scriptures: “the oneness of the Manifestations of God”
and “the divine unity or entity” (PUP 192). As to the former
Bahá’u’lláh writes that the Manifestations of God “are all sent down
from the heaven of the Will of God,” and therefore they “are
regarded as one soul and the same person” (KI 152). As to the latter,
He writes that its “true meaning” is not to “be tempted to make any
distinction between any of the Manifestations of His Cause” (GWB
59). The understanding of these “expressions of unity” is an
important component of “unity in religion,” which ‘Abdu’l-Bahá
describes as “the corner-stone of the foundation” of “the unity of all
mankind” (SWAB 32). As to faith and certitude, faith is intended as
“the love that flows from man to God” (PT 58.5), “conscious
knowledge, and . . . the practice of good deeds” (TAB 3:549); and
certitude is the capacity “to remain steadfast” (GWB 338) in one’s
faith.
4\. Moral development

‘Abdu’l-Bahá explains that spiritual awakening and the acqui-
sition of “the virtues and perfections which adorn the reality of

Lights of ‘Irfán Book Seven          227

man” (SAQ 223) are both caused by and result in “the expansion of
consciousness” (SWAB 126). This expansion promotes “the ethical dev-
elopment and spiritual progress of mankind” (PUP 97) through the
development of “the moral relations between the hearts” (Christ 11).
5\. The progress of humankind

‘Abdu’l-Bahá describes “material” (SWAB 285) and “spiritual
progress” (SAQ 300). The former “promoteth the principles of
material achievement” (SWAB 283) and its “propagator and executive
power” is a “just government” (SWAB 283). It is conducive to the
development of material civilization which is laudable, but
insufficient, because it brings into being at the same time, on the
one hand, an “orderly pattern of kingdoms . . . ease of . . . means of
travel . . . noble discoveries and scientific researches” and, on the
other, “the development of forces of demolition and the invention
of fiery implements” (SWAB 283). Spiritual progress produces the
development of divine civilization, characterized by a balance
between material and spiritual progress. The founders of divine
civilization are the Manifestations of God, “teachers, wondrous and
without peer,” who educate humankind “according to teachings
from God” (SWAB 283).

‘Abdu’l-Bahá defines these basic principles of religions as
“spiritual teachings” (SWAB 285) and says that they are “the essence
of the Law” (SAQ 47) of all the Manifestations of God and “are
renewed in the cycle of every Prophet” (SAQ 48).6 Therefore “the
basis of the religions of God is one” (TDP 32) and any difference
among them in this aspect depends only on the expanding of “the
horizon of man” (‘Abdu’l-Bahá on Christ 10).

A resemblance has been noted between this concept and
Perennialism.7 But whereas Perennialism refers to an intrinsic feature
of the human spirit, to be cultivated through mystical efforts, the
“one religion, Divine and indivisible” of Bahá’í Scriptures is a divine
knowledge progressively revealed by God to humankind, available to
whosoever is willing to follow the path provided by that same
knowledge. This knowledge leads to spirituality.
V. “T h e ir ai ms a n d purposes are one an d t h e sa m e”

All the basic principles of religions may be summarized into a
single purpose: “to safeguard the interests and promote the unity of
the human race, and to foster the spirit of love and fellowship
amongst men” (TB 168). This purpose is “the essence of the Faith of
God and His Religion” (ESW 13). It is so important that ‘Abdu’l-
Bahá writes that should a religion “lead to malice, spite, and hate, it
is of no value at all. For religion is a remedy, and if the remedy bring
on disease, then put it aside” (SWAB 249).

228          Religion and Exclusivism

VI. “T h e ir teac h ings are but f ac ets o f one truth”

Bahá’u’lláh writes that “the words and utterances” of the
Manifestations of God differ from one another “because of . . . [a]
difference in . . . [the Manifestations’] station and mission,” but they
“are in reality but the expressions of one Truth” (KI 177). The
verities explained by the various Scriptures of the world seem to be
different from one another, because they describe the same Reality,
in conformity with the needs of the people for whom they were
intended. They are the various phenomenal expressions of the one
Noumenon, that is, the one divine Reality. This statement is
reminiscent of Perspectivism, typical of Hick’s pluralistic thought.8
But, as has been said, whereas Hick emphasizes the different human
responses to the same divine Reality, Bahá’í Scriptures also
emphasize the fact that the same divine Reality gradually reveals
itself to humankind in the course of the ages.
VII. “T h e ir f unctions are co mple m e ntary”
Bahá’u’lláh writes that

> each Manifestation of God hath a distinct individuality, a
> definitely prescribed mission, a predestined revelation, and
> specially designated limitations. Each one of them is known
> by a different name, is characterized by a special attribute,
> fulfils a definite mission, and is entrusted with a particular
> Revelation (KI 52)
From the concept of the existence of God and the awareness of
good and evil taught by Adam, to the concept of the unity of God
inculcated by Abraham, from the concept of the due observance of
the “fundamental law of God,” which Moses “revealed . . . [as] the
real ethical basis of the civilization and progress of humanity” (PUP
368), to the “special way of life which constitutes the highest type of
action on earth” (SDC 82) emphasized by Christ, to the union of a
people and the founding of a nation upon the divine law taught by
Mu˙ammad, humankind, guided by these “agents of one civilizing
process” (The Universal House of Justice, “Promise” 685) has passed
through various phases in its knowledge of spiritual reality and in its
manifesting this knowledge through its actions and undertakings (cf.
PDC 119-21). Bahá’í Scriptures honor all the Manifestations of God,
because each of them manifests, in different ways, the same God
and bestows his own precious legacy upon all humankind.
VIII. “T h ey di f f er only in t h e non- essential aspects o f

> t h eir doctrines”
> ‘Abdu’l-Bahá explains that the “inessential” aspects of religious
doctrines are the “material Law” (‘Abdu’l-Bahá on Christ 10). Whereas
“the spiritual Law” is “the essence of the Law,” “material Law” is its

Lights of ‘Irfán Book Seven          229

“form” (SAQ 47-8). “Material Law” deals, on the one hand, with
“practical life ...transactions and business” (‘Abdu’l-Bahá on Christ 10)
and, on the other, with “exterior forms and ceremonies” (PT 44.11).
The outer forms of “fasting, prayer, and worship,” the rules of
“marriage and divorce,” issues regarding “the abolition of slavery,
legal processes, transactions, indemnities for murder, violence, theft
and injuries” (SAQ 48) as well as the ordinances regarding food, all
fall under this category (cf. PUP 365, 404). These teachings are
“modified . . . in each prophetic cycle in accordance with the
necessities of the times” (SAQ 48). However, “[t]he essential thing is
the spiritual law — the outer material law is of small moment,
because material life has natural laws to protect it, but humanity
lacks spiritual education and needs instruction on the divine
qualities” (ADP 64-5).

‘Abdu’l-Bahá may have considered the spiritual teachings of
religions as essential and the material teachings as non-essential on
the ground of the concept, explained by Bahá’u’lláh, that every
Revelation is intended “to effect a transformation in the whole
character of mankind, a transformation that shall manifest itself
both outwardly and inwardly, that shall affect both its inner life and
external conditions” (KI 40-1). In fact, the teachings which ‘Abdu’l-
Bahá defined as essential are teachings whose enforcement changes
the character of humankind. The teachings he defined as non-
essential “refer to material things” (SAQ 48), which exert their
influence on the transformation of human character only through
the spirit that should animate the believers in their compliance with
those laws, that is, their love for God, independently from the form
of those laws in the various religions.

‘Abdu’l-Bahá also includes among the non-essential aspects of
religions those “human interpretations and dogmatic imitations of
ancestral beliefs” (PUP 354) that have gradually encrusted all regions,
in such a subtle and pervasive way that they have come to be
considered as an intrinsic aspect of religions. Since they “differ
widely, religious strife and disagreement have arisen among mankind”
(PUP 141). This issue will be later illustrated.
IX. “T h e ir missions represent succ essi v e stages in t h e

> spiritual e volution of h u m an society”
> The “great” religions are “different stages in the eternal history
and constant evolution of one religion, Divine and indivisible”
(WOB 114), in the progressive unfoldment of one “Grand
Redemptive Scheme of God” (GPB 139), and their missions represent
successive stages in the spiritual evolution of human society. One
Common Faith explains: “The declared purpose of history’s series of
prophetic revelations . . . has been not only to guide the individual

seeker on the path of personal salvation, but to prepare the whole of
the human family for the great eschatological Event lying ahead,
through which the life of the world will itself be entirely
transformed” (OCF 54). The theoretical foundations of this concept
have already been explained. Its consequences on the Bahá’í attitude
towards the “great” religions are that “one cannot call one . . . Faith
superior to another, as they all come from God; they are progressive,
each suited to certain needs of the times.”9 A number of scholars
have given to this concept an inclusivistic meaning, because in their
opinion it presents the Bahá’í Faith as the synthesis of all previous
religions.10 As a matter of fact ‘Abdu’l-Bahá wrote that “[t]he
teachings of Bahá’u’lláh are such that all the communities of the
world, whether religious, political or ethical, ancient or modern, find
in them the expression of their highest wish” (SWAB 304). This
statement certainly implies that the Bahá’í Faith is inclusive in the
sense of being “enclosing, encompassing” (Webster). But the Bahá’í
conception of the oneness of religion is not inclusivistic, because it
does not deny, but on the contrary upholds, “the ultimate validity”
(Rowe 178) of all the “great” religions, as salvific agents, which have
the power “to bring about happiness in the after life and civilization
and the refinement of character in this” (SDC 46). In this vein One
Common Faith states that the “heroes and saints” of any religion
“are the heroes and saints of all” the other religions, the “successes”
of any religion are “the successes of all” (OCF 23) the others.
The “God-given authority and correlative
character” of Scriptures

These propositions have two corollaries. The first is that the Scrip-
tures of all religions, which are the repositories of the teachings of
each religion, have a “God-given authority” (PDC 111) and are mutually
correlated. The Bahá’í teachings do not confirm an “exact word-for-
word authenticity” of all Scriptures, which recent studies seem to
ascribe to very few, if any, of them. They only uphold the validity of
their “substance or spiritual message” (Sours 96). “The scriptures have
not changed; the moral principles they contain have lost none of
their validity,” remarks One Common Faith (23). As to the correlations
among Scriptures, these correlations may depend on the fact that, as
has been said, all the Manifestations of God take part in the progressive
unfoldment of one “Grand Redemptive Scheme of God” (GPB 139).

All “great” religions are “continuous in their purpose
and indispensable in their value to mankind”

The second corollary is that all “great” religions are “continuous
in their purpose, indispensable in their value to mankind” (WOB 58).
Since each “great” religion is united to all the others in a

“continuous purpose,” that is, “to safeguard the interests and
promote the unity of the human race, and to foster the spirit of love
and fellowship amongst men” (TB 168), today each “great” religion
may become more effective in achieving that purpose, if it is willing
to cooperate with all its sister religions in its attainment. And this
purpose is clearly pointed out in One Common Faith, when it states
that “the texts speak with one voice: religion’s goal is humanity’s
attainment” (OCF 53) of a golden age, “an age utterly beyond
anything humanity will have experienced, the mind conceived or
language as yet encompassed” (54).
How is exclusivism born?

‘Abdu’l-Bahá writes: “Every universal cause is divine and every
particular one is temporal. The principles of the . ..Manifestations of
God were, therefore, all-universal and all-inclusive . . . The . . .
Manifestations of God . . . engaged in the service of universal
education” (SWAB 68-9). The idea that Scriptures may include
statements requesting the believers to assume exclusivist attitudes is,
in a Bahá’í perspective, tantamount to saying that Scriptures are not
universal, which is at variance with the ultimate purpose — educating
all humankind to love, unity and peace — wherefore the
Manifestations of God come to the world. And yet some sentences
of each of those Scriptures are used to defend exclusivist attitudes.
In the light of Bahá’í teachings it seems that this happened because
of misinterpretations of those words. The Bahá’í International
Community wrote in this regard: “Indeed, human beings have a
tendency to view their own beliefs as right, and all others as wrong.
They have, we suggest, erroneously interpreted the tenets of their
own faiths as advocating . . . exclusivity” (Eliminating Religious
Intolerance). Our misinterpretations of Scriptures drive us to think
that God has not observed the fundamental clause of His Own
Covenant with all religions — loving everybody without excluding
anyone — revealing Himself only to a people, to an age, at the
exclusion of anyone else, or wholly abandoning a people after having
revealed Himself to them through one of His Manifestations.

Bahá’u’lláh assures us that “the generality of mankind hath been
endued with the capacity to hearken unto God’s most exalted Word”
(TB 89) and warns that in some people “this faculty hath remained
undeveloped and hath, indeed, degenerated” (TB 53). He explains
moreover that whosoever wants to discover the meanings of Scripture
needs “purity of heart, chastity of soul, and freedom of spirit” (KI
211), He also explains that his heart should be “assured,” his soul
should have “found favour with God,” his mind should be “detached
from all else but Him” (KI 255). These words describe at least two
conditions. The first is the capacity of transcending the promptings

of the “ego,” intended as the consciousness of his body and its
instincts which each human being acquires and preserves during his
earthly life, and which, if it is not properly curbed, is responsible for
self-centered behaviors, which are unworthy of a human being.
Whosoever tries to interpret Scriptures, without having achieved a
relative inner freedom from his “ego,” does not discover their real,
implicit meanings, but rather he simply finds a reflection of his own
desires in them, that is, those meanings which he may use for his own
purposes, as for example demeaning the identity of others and
bolstering his own. On the contrary, while interpreting Scriptures one
should remember that “religion must be the cause of fellowship and
love” (SWAB 299) and one should also keep in mind that “self-love ...is
a strange trait and the means of the destruction of many important
souls in the world” (TAB 1:136). The second condition is avoiding to
regard “the words and deeds of mortal men as a standard for the true
understanding and recognition of God and His Prophets” (KI 4) and
seeking “enlightenment from them who are the recognized
Expounders” of Scripture (KI 256), that is, “the divine
Manifestations,” Who are “the only ones who can comprehend its
manifold wisdom” (GWB 75). Bahá’í Scriptures mention at least five
major mistakes in the interpretation of Scriptures which may lead to
exclusivist readings.

One mistake is pointed out by Bahá’u’lláh when He says,
referring to certain allegorical verses of Scripture, that religious
leaders “have literally interpreted the Word of God,” depriving
“themselves and all their people of the bountiful showers of the
grace and mercies of God” (KI 82).11 The importance of avoiding
literal interpretations of Scriptures, whenever “the reality of spirit —
its condition, its station . . . spiritual qualities . . . [or] spiritual states”
(SAQ 84) are described, becomes even more evident if one considers
that “modern scholarship has disproved many old beliefs about the
inerrancy of scriptural documents” (Sours 95).

A second mistake is that some passages of Scripture have been
over-emphasized, while other pertinent passages have been ignored.
Bahá’u’lláh condemns those people who “with one hand cling to
those verses of the Qur’án [Koran] and those traditions . . . which
they have found to accord with their inclinations and interests, and
with the other reject those which are contrary to their selfish
desires” (KI 168).12 In this sense the Bahá’ís are recommended to
avoid the tendency “to cling tenaciously to one Text or one
understanding of the Texts and to overlook the significance of
other passages of the Writings”13 and to always keep in mind the
overall meaning of Scriptures, because the teachings which
Scriptures convey are “a great, balanced whole,”14 similar to “a

sphere; there are points poles apart, and in between the thoughts and
doctrines that unite them.”15

A third mistake consists in interpreting a statement of Scriptures
while ignoring their overall meaning in the light of the specific
mission of the Manifestation of God Who revealed them. In this
sense Shoghi Effendi says: “The severe laws and injunctions revealed
by the Báb can be properly appreciated and understood only when
interpreted in the light of His own statements regarding the nature,
purpose and character of His own Dispensation.”16 Likewise, One
Common Faith explains such teachings of the ancient religion as
“the inferior social status most sacred texts assign to women” (OCF
34) and exclusivist teachings pertaining “relations between societies,”
which seem unacceptable today, on the ground of the fact that “[a]t
the stages of social development at which all of the major faiths
came into existence, scriptural guidance sought primarily to civilize,
to the extent possible, relationships resulting from intractable
historical circumstances” (35).

A fourth mistake comes from renouncing rationality, in the name
of a blind faith in tradition, which implies the perpetuation of past
mistakes. Bahá’u’lláh states that God has “conferred upon man ...the
gift of understanding,” so that he may be able “to discern the truth
in all things” (GWB 194). And thus He encourages people to read
Scriptures “in the spirit of search, not in blind imitation” (SV 24). As
‘Abdu’l-Bahá writes: “blind imitation of the past will stunt the
mind” (SWAB 248).

A fifth mistake comes when, paraphrasing One Common Faith,
“followers of one of the world’s faiths prove unable to distinguish
between its eternal and transitory features,” and ascribe an absolute
value to scriptural passages prescribing “rules of behaviour that have
long since accomplished their purpose” (37).

Scriptures may also be misinterpreted because of the complexity
of their language. Bahá’u’lláh quotes a Muslim tradition to explain
that the words of Scriptures have many meanings: “ We speak one
word, and by it we intend one and seventy meanings” (KI 255).17 He
writes moreover that all the Manifestations of God “speak a twofold
language. One . . . the outward language, is devoid of allusions, is
unconcealed and unveiled . . . the other language is veiled and
concealed” (KI 254-5). Elsewhere He explains that He Himself has
adopted “the language of the law-giver” and “that of the truth-
seeker and the mystic” (ESW 14). He also writes that He has revealed
His “verses in nine different modes” (SLH 27). Since Scriptures are
written in so many different modes, it is important to read each of
their statements in its own context and in the light of the special

“mode” of its revelation, as well as keeping the fundamental verities
of Scriptures as a whole in mind.18

Finally, five kinds of language have been recently described in
Christian Scriptures: “survival language . . . apocalyptic language . . .
confessional language . ..action language . .. hyperbolic language” (Fazel
248-58, 265-7). Survival language should strengthen the early believers’
identity, surrounded as they are, so much so at the beginning of a
Dispensation, by indifference and even hostility. Apocalyptic
language, “foreboding imminent disaster or final doom” (Webster)
should help the believers face the catastrophic events that often mark
the emergence of newborn religions and remain steadfast in their
faith. Confessional language has been described as “the language . ..of
enthusiastic believers . . . of lovers” (Knitter 185). Action language
should inspire the believers to make the necessary sacrifices so that
they may put in practice the will of God. Hyperbolic language, typical
of the mystical literature of all ages and regions, should describe
abstruse metaphysical concepts and spiritual experiences that are quite
different from any other kind of experience. A sixth language could
be added, that is, the prophetic or eschatological language, a
particular form of apocalyptic language which sometimes sets the
obscurity of present days against the bliss of future achievements.
Scriptures admonish that this language is difficult and that it will be
understood only after the predicted events will have been realized.
These six kinds of language are often expressed in powerful
utterances, which, if they are interpreted literally, or taken out of
their context, and invested with a doctrinal meaning, can give rise to
exclusivist interpretations.

These considerations could raise a number of objections.

Someone could object that they may imply that only the learned
ones are able to understand Scripture. Others could object that the
analytical reading which these considerations seem to encourage may
invalidate the inspiring purpose of Scriptures. It is like coldly
analyzing a poem without yielding to its beauty. Others could
observe that an excess of rational, allegorical interpretation could
nullify the practical aspects of religions. Bahá’í Scriptures appear to
explain that all these risks can be avoided when the above mentioned
spiritual conditions for whomsoever wants to discover the meanings
of Scripture are realized and an attitude of wisdom and moderation
is adopted.

The mistakes made by theologians and religious leaders in their
interpretations of Scripture are therefore understandable.
Nonetheless they have had grievous consequences, because they have
grown into dogmas, that is, enunciations of man-made doctrines,
whose acceptance is required to be numbered among the followers
of a religion.

Bahá’í Scriptures deny that man-made dogmas may be included
among the basic principles of religions for at least four reasons.
First, dogmas are the fruit of human minds that, as excellent as they
may have been, cannot be infallible, since essential infallibility is an
exclusive attribute of the Manifestations of God. Second, since
human beings cannot have a complete understanding of reality, each
dogma, as a man-made enunciation of spiritual truth, is in itself
limited and thus it remains a hypothesis. Third, dogmas sometimes
“are contrary to science” (PT 44.15). But “the religion of God is the
promoter of truth, the founder of science ( ‘ilm) and knowledge
( ma‘rifat)” and “knowledge ( ‘ilm) . . . is . . . identical with guidance”
(Mufáva∂át 99, SAQ 137).19 Therefore there cannot be contradiction
between the two. And thus an interpretation of a Scriptural sentence
might have a widely accepted meaning in a certain time, but later it
becomes obvious that what was “widely accepted” is in conflict with
scientific findings, thus throwing into question the veracity of the
widely accepted scriptural interpretation. Last but not least, a
number of dogmas “are at variance with the foundations established
by the Prophets of God” (PUP 354) and thus they are conducive to
strife and disagreement, whereas the purpose of religion is to create
love and harmony among human beings.

The growth of the body of dogmas throughout the centuries has
introduced into “tradition” a number of concepts at variance with
the overall intentions of the divine message of Scripture, and yet
considered as absolute verities by religious leaders and their
followers, giving “rise to discord, hatred and disunion” (SAQ 298). In
the light of Bahá’í Scriptures these elements that have been added to
the original teachings of the Manifestations of God are considered
as “non-essential and spurious” (PDC 109). Therefore the Bahá’ís
“distinguish, for instance, between Christianity, which is the divine
message given by Jesus of Nazareth, and the development of
Christendom, which is the history of what men did with that
message in subsequent centuries, a distinction which has become
blurred if not entirely obscured” (Comments 389) in the eyes of
modern scholars of religion. In this regard ‘Abdu’l-Bahá said: “There
was no disagreement or variance in the reality of . . . the teaching and
mission [of religions]. Discord has arisen among their followers,
who have lost sight of reality and hold fast to imitations” (PUP 234).
One Common Faith remarks in this regard: “Over time, theology
succeeded in constructing in the heart of each one of the great
faiths an authority parallel with, and even inimical in spirit to, the
revealed teachings on which the tradition was based” (28).

Towards the oneness of religions

The following words uttered by ‘Abdu’l-Bahá in 1912 both sum-
marize what has been said in this paper and suggest a way towards
the abandonment of dangerous claims to exclusivity or finality:

> The strife between religions . . . arises from misunder-
> standing. If we investigate the religions to discover the
> principles underlying their foundations, we will find they
> agree; for the fundamental reality of them is one and not
> multiple. By this means the religionists of the world will
> reach their point of unity and reconciliation. They will
> ascertain the truth that the purpose of religion is the acqui-
> sition of praiseworthy virtues, the betterment of morals,
> the spiritual development of mankind, the real life and
> divine bestowals . . . We must look at the reality of the
> Prophets and Their teachings in order that we may agree.
