Towards a definition of Baha’i
theology and mystical philosophy
Abstract
Theology is not one of those ‘sciences . . . which begin with words and end with words’. On the
contrary, the Baha’i writings teach a theology, which is usually defined as ‘divine philosophy’, and
which has nothing to do with past, divisive, metaphysical hair-splitting. Its main objects are listed.
Divine philosophy is not a mere intellectual knowledge of abstract ideas, but a conscious knowledge
of spiritual reality, which every Baha’i is invited to achieve, so that his life may be renewed. Three
fruits of divine philosophy are described: inner knowledge, spiritual progress, and an enhanced
capacity of loving. These fruits are vital means for the attainment of the object of the Baha’i Faith: the
oneness of humankind. Studying theology is not dangerous for the unity of the Baha’is, because the
Baha’i writings provide sufficient means of security: the infallibility of the Universal House of Justice,
as the head of the Baha’i Faith, and the interdiction to utter authoritative statements unless
specifically authorized by the writings themselves. Since Baha’i theology is quite different from the
theologies of the past, it is suggested that it be called ‘divine philosophy’, according to the
terminology used in the writings.

A number of Baha’is think that theology is one of those ‘sciences . . . which begin with words and end
with words’,1 which Baha’u’llah recommends that people avoid.2 Therefore they think that theology is
of lesser, or of no importance in their Faith. Their idea may be justified in the light of the concept of
theology they have in their minds: ‘A system of theoretical principles; an (impractical or rigid)
ideology’,3 or ‘A set of rigidly and dogmatically adopted criteria, customs and procedures’.4 These
definitions describe a number of the features of those dogmatic theologies of the past, which were
mostly elaborated by human minds, sometimes substituted for the Word of God and thus worshipped,
and often imposed by churches or religious establishments as an essential element of faith to be
dogmatically accepted. Those theologies are incomplete and often imperfect, inasmuch as they are of
human origin, abstract, theoretical, and sometimes fruitless and imbued with superstition. They have
been an important factor of disunity, discord, conflict and even of bloody wars among their own
followers and between the various religious denominations. Shoghi Effendi defined them as ‘Fruitless

TOWARDS A DEFINITION OF BAHA’I THEOLOGY AND MYSTICAL PHILOSOPHY

excursions into metaphysical hair-splitting’,5 and said that their ‘theological treatises and
commentaries . . . encumber the human mind rather than help it to attain the truth.’6

In this paper, it is not so much scholastic theology, which was characterized in Islam as kalām
and which aims at a rational and intellectual analysis of religious truth, that will be the subject of our
attention but rather the ‘divine philosophy’ or mystical theology that seeks to attain an inner spiritual
knowledge.

The term ‘theology’ in the Baha’i writings
The term ‘theology’ does not appear as such in the Baha’i writings that are written in Arabic and
Persian. And in the English writings and translations by Shoghi Effendi it occurs only twice, 7 in
contexts that are not relevant to the aims of this paper, which is to define theology in a Baha’i context.
Shoghi Effendi also refers twice to the word ‘theologian’8 and thrice to the adjective ‘theological’.9
But these passages are also of little use with regard to a definition of ‘theology’. The only conclusion
that may be derived from them is that Shoghi Effendi does not regard highly ‘the wranglings of
theologians’10 and ‘those theological treatises and commentaries that encumber the human mind rather
than help it to attain the truth’.11

In the following list, the most important Arabic and Persian terms that are similar to the English
word ‘theology’ and that occur in the Baha’i writings are given, followed by the way that they are
translated in the Baha’i texts and then the way that they are translated in other authoritative sources:

(1) Ilāhīyāt12 is translated in the Baha’i writings as ‘theology’. 13 In Islamic literature, the Arabic

and Persian word ilāhīyāt, which is the Arabic plural of ilāhīyat, ‘divinity’,14 is usually

> 1950) 1. After Shoghi Effendi wrote these words in 1947 and 1956 respectively, there have been interesting
> developments in theology in the field of inter-religious dialogue. ‘Abdu’l-Baha said in 1912: ‘We are considering the
> divine plan for the reconciliation of the religious systems of the world. Bahá’u’lláh has said that if one intelligent
> member be selected from each of the varying religious systems, and these representatives come together seeking to
> investigate the reality of religion, they would establish an interreligious body before which all disputes and differences of
> belief could be presented for consideration and settlement. Such questions could then be weighed and viewed from the
> standpoint of reality and all imitations be discarded. By this method and procedure all sects, denominations and systems

> visit to the United States and Canada in 1912, ed. Howard MacNutt, 2nd edn. [Wilmette, Illinois: Baha’i Publishing

> considered as a first step in the direction suggested by Baha’u’llah. And thus they cannot certainly be viewed as ‘fruitless
> excursions into metaphysical hair-splitting’, and as words that ‘encumber the human mind rather than help it to attain the
> truth’.

science of Divinity’.45

‘Divine philosophy’
In the writings and talks of ‘Abdu’l-Baha, ‘divine philosophy’ is one of the branches of philosophy.
And he defines philosophy through a reference to a well-known Muslim Tradition: ‘comprehending
the reality of things as they exist, according to the capacity and power of man’ (idrāk-i-ḥaqāyiq-i-
āshyā’ ast alā mā hiya ‘alayhi).46 The other branch is ‘natural philosophy’,47 or ‘material philosophy’
(ḥikmat-i- . . . ṭabī‘īyih),48 or ‘material science’ (‘ulūm-i-māddīyih),49 corresponding to what today we

generically define as science. If we want to have a deeper understanding of what ‘Abdu’l-Baha meant
as ‘divine philosophy’ we should, therefore, on the one hand understand what he meant as
‘philosophy’ and on the other investigate what are, in ‘Abdu’l-Baha’s explanations, the method and
object of philosophy.

‘Abdu’l-Baha’s definition of philosophy is reminiscent of a passage of a prayer ascribed to
Muhammad and often quoted by the Sufis: ‘O Lord, show us things as they are’ (Allāhumma arinā al-
ashyā’ kamā hiya [or alā mā hiya ‘alayhi]). The Sufis interpret this prayer of their prophet as a request
that God may bestow upon the believer a power of perception that may enable him to see God in
everything, according to the Qur’anic verse: ‘God’s is the east and the west, and wherever ye turn
there is God’s face (vajhu’llāh).’50 Baha’u’llah explains that ‘the face of God’ is the Manifestation of
God. He writes in the Kitáb-i-Íqán: ‘From their knowledge, the knowledge of God is revealed, and
from the light of their countenance, the splendour of the Face of God is made manifest,’51 and in the
‘Tablet to Napoleon’: ‘O ye peoples of the earth! Turn yourselves towards Him Who hath turned
towards you. He, verily, is the Face of God amongst you, and His Testimony and His Guide unto
you.’52 Since the Manifestation of God is the human manifestation of the divine Command (amr), the
capacity to perceive the Manifestation of God in everything seems tantamount to the capacity to look
‘on all things with the eye of oneness’ and to see ‘the brilliant rays of the divine sun shining from the
dawning-point of Essence alike on all created things, and the lights of singleness reflected over all
creation,’53 which Baha’u’llah describes in the Seven Valleys. It is spiritual or inner knowledge (‘irfān
or ma‘rifat), also called certitude (īqān), described not only in the Seven Valleys,54 bur also in the
Four Valleys,55 in the Kitáb-i-Íqán56 and in Javáhiru’l-Asrár.57 Baha’u’llah writes about this power:
‘We should with tearful eyes, fervently and repeatedly, implore Him to grant us the favour of that
grace.’58 Then he adds: ‘That city [the city of Certitude] is none other than the Word of God revealed
in every age and dispensation. In the days of Moses it was the Pentateuch; in the days of Jesus the
Gospel; in the days of Muḥammad the Messenger of God the Qur’án; in this day the Bayán . . . ’59
Therefore it seems that ‘spiritual or inner knowledge’ or ‘certitude’ may be attained only through the
words of the Manifestation of God. Indeed Baha’u’llah clearly writes in another context that ‘divine
philosophy (al-ḥikmat al-ilāhīyah)’60 has been taught to human beings by the Manifestations of God
and he considers Hermes Trismegistus, called Idris in the Qur’an, ‘the Father of Philosophy (abū’l-
ḥikmat)’61 and numbered among the Prophets of God, and he explains that his books are the most

important source of the ancient philosophy. ‘Abdu’l-Baha says that religion is ‘the truest philosophy’,
because it ‘inculcates morality’.62

As to the method to be adopted in studying the objects of ‘divine philosophy’, ‘Abdu’l-Baha
clearly explains that the criteria of human knowledge are four: ‘the senses (ḥass)’, ‘reason (‘aql)’,
insight or inspiration and ‘tradition – that is, through the text of the Holy Scriptures (naql, wa ān
nuṣūṣ kutub-i-muqaddasih ast)’.63 Examining these four criteria, he concludes that – each one of them
being limited – any single one can lead to fallacious results. Thus any object of human investigation
should be studied in the light of all these four criteria. But also studying a subject in the light of these
four criteria does not guarantee the results of our efforts. A method is suggested in the Baha’i
writings, whereby certain standards of inner integrity of thought and behaviour should be observed.64
Only when those four criteria are used, that method is followed and those standards are observed,
then, ‘Abdu’l-Baha says, ‘[b]y the breaths and promptings of the Holy Spirit, which is light and
knowledge itself . . . the human mind is quickened and fortified into true conclusions and perfect
knowledge,’65 because ‘the bounty of the Holy Spirit (fayḍ-i-rūḥu’l-quds) gives the true method of
comprehension which is infallible and indubitable . . . and this is the condition in which certainty
(yaqīn) can alone be attained.’66 Human cognitive powers are like eyes and the Holy Spirit like light,
in the absence of which eyes cannot see.

And thus it seems that ‘divine philosophy’ differs from the purely rational theology, sometimes
elaborated by past and present scholars, because the latter arises from a human intellect convinced that
it is able to understand reality without the assistance of the Holy Spirit, whereas the former arises
from a human intellect that is deeply conscious of its own limitations and thus bends all its efforts
towards drawing upon itself the assistance of the Holy Spirit, whereby it may be enlightened.

As to the object of ‘divine philosophy’, ‘Abdu’l-Baha explains that it studies asrār-i-ḥaqīqat
(literally the secrets of reality, which has been translated as ‘spiritual verities’),67 ‘spiritual realities
(ḥaqā’iq-i-ma‘navī)’,68 ‘the mysteries of God (asrār-i-ilāhī) . . . inner significances of the heavenly
religions (ḥaqīqat-i-adyān-i-raḥmanī) and foundations of the law (asās-i-sharī‘atu’llāh)’,69 that is the
‘phenomena of the spirit’.70 He specifically mentions the following issues:

(1) ‘The intellectual proofs of Divinity . . . based upon observation and evidence . . . logically

> proving the reality of Divinity, the effulgence of mercy, the certainty of inspiration and
> immortality of the spirit’;71
(2) ‘the essential nature of Divinity, of the Divine revelation, of the manifestation of Deity in this

world’;72

(5) the assertion that ‘the world of nature is incomplete . . . nature seems complete, it is,

nevertheless, imperfect because it has need of intelligence and education’;77
(6) ‘the problem of the reality of the spirit of man; of the birth of the spirit; of its birth from this

> world into the world of God; the question of the inner life of the spirit and of its fate after its
> ascension from the body’,78 which also includes the Plotinian concept of the circle of

(7) such ethical teachings of revealed religions as ‘faith in God, the acquirement of the virtues

> which characterize perfect manhood, praiseworthy moralities’,80 the issue of good and evil
> and of its dependence on law and reason,81 etc.;
(8) last, but not least, there is ‘the Bahá’í philosophy of progressive Revelation’,82 mentioned by

Shoghi Effendi.

These subjects include all the issues that are traditionally ascribed in the West to theology in its wider
meaning: ‘man, the world, salvation, and eschatology (or the study of last times)’.83 ‘Abdu’l-Baha
mentions moreover a number of fundamental principles of ‘divine philosophy’. He lists among those
principles the well-known eleven (or twelve) social principles of the Baha’i Faith, that is: independent
investigation of truth; balance between religions and science; equality between men and women; etc.
And he says that among them ‘the unity of mankind . . . the tie of love which blends human hearts’ is
the ‘the most important’.84

Therefore, on the grounds of these quotations, theology may be defined as ‘a systematic study of
spiritual phenomena, or of spiritual or metaphysical reality’, whereas science may be defined as ‘a
systematic study of material or physical reality’. The Baha’i writings describe a spiritual,
metaphysical, subjective, transcendent, inner, invisible, celestial, heavenly or ideal reality and a
physical, material, objective, contingent, outer, visible, earthly, sensible or phenomenal reality. This
distinction should not, however, suggest a dualistic vision of reality. Indeed ‘Abdu’l-Baha clearly

states that ‘reality is one and cannot admit of multiplicity (ḥaqīqat yikī ast ta‘addud qabūl
nimīkunad)’.85 A corollary of this statement is that we should use the scientific method to investigate
not only material reality but also spiritual reality.

The importance of theology in the Baha’i Faith
If theology is ‘a systematic study of spiritual reality’ its fruit is a conscious knowledge of spiritual
reality. But ‘conscious knowledge’86 also is one of the definitions of faith given by ‘Abdu’l-Baha.
Therefore theology, far from being banished from the Baha’i Faith, is its essential part. Each Baha’i is
expected to achieve a deeper and deeper conscious knowledge of spiritual reality, so that he may more
and more effectively contribute to the ‘achievement of a dynamic coherence between spiritual and
practical requirements of life on earth’87 through the practical expression of his faith, that is ‘the
practice of good deeds.’88 This concept is seemingly confirmed in one of the American talks by
‘Abdu’l-Baha. In that talk, after having extolled the great development of material civilization in
America, he augurs a corresponding development of spiritual civilization and states that its
achievement requires a ‘readjustment’ of human morals, through an improvement of ‘the world of
intellectuality.’ Then he adds:

> We must . . . render service to the world of intellectuality in order that the minds of men may
> increase in power and become keener in perception, assisting the intellect of man to attain its
> supremacy so that the ideal virtues may appear. Before a step is taken in this direction [1] we
> must be able to prove Divinity from the standpoint of reason so that no doubt or objection
> may remain for the rationalist. Afterward, [2] we must be able to prove the existence of the
> bounty of God – that the divine bounty encompasses humanity and that it is transcendental.
> Furthermore, [3] we must demonstrate that the spirit of man is immortal, that it is not subject
> to disintegration and that it comprises the virtues of humanity. 89

And finally he says: ‘This is, in reality, the science of Divinity.’90 Therefore the Baha’i Faith requires
that each individual should achieve a conscious knowledge of spiritual reality so that the final goal of
humankind may be attained: the realization of the oneness of humankind.

Achieving a conscious knowledge of spiritual reality
The conscious knowledge of spiritual reality can be achieved only ‘in the spirit of search (taḥqīq), not
in blind imitation (taqlīd)’.91 Taqlīd and taḥqīq (or ijtihād) are a well-known dyad in Islamic
theological disputations. In the Sufi world taqlīd, from the root qld, ‘to copy, to counterfeit, to imitate

(in a pedestrian way)’, 92 denotes ‘a blind submission to the magister dixit’,93 which is very common
among Christians as well. Taḥqīq, which derives from the Arabic word ḥaqq (truth), means not only
‘philosophical search’,94 but also ‘realization (of Truth) . . . metaphysical, initiatory, spiritual
realization . . . verification’.95 In other words, taḥqīq means the achievement of spiritual or inner
knowledge or certitude, as the result of one’s independent investigation of truth. This dyad is the
foundation of two Baha’i principles: the independent investigation of truth and the abolition of
prejudice, prejudice which often arises from a blind submission to tradition. Baha’u’llah describes
search in the Valley of Search in the Seven Valleys,96 in the Garden of Search in Javáhiru’l-Asrár,97 as
well as in a passage of the Kitáb-i-Íqán which the Baha’is sometimes call the ‘Tablet of the True
Seeker’,98 and ‘Abdu’l-Baha explains it in a passage of Some Answered Questions.99 It is ‘the Path of
Positive Knowledge (manāhij-i-‘ilmu’l-yaqīn)’,100 ‘the snow-white path (manhaju’l-bayḍā)’ that leads
‘unto the Crimson Pillar (ruknu’l-ḥamrā’)’,101 the ‘school of Divine Unity (miṣṭabiy-i-tawḥīd)’,102 the
school where ‘the science of the love of God [is taught]’ (dabīristānu’r-raḥmān) , lit.: the School of
the Merciful.103

The ‘independent investigation’ of truth implies a sound reading of the books which God has
given to humankind for its upliftment: the Book par excellence, that is the Scriptures; the ‘book of
existence (daftar-i-dunyā)’,104 or of Creation,105 or ‘of Life (kitābu’l-wujūd)’;106 the ‘book of . . .
[one’s] own self (kitāb-i-nafs)’107 or of man, defined as ‘the Book of Creation (kitāb-i-takvīn)’.108

> the Valleys of Knowledge and of Unity, in the second and in the fourth of the Four Valleys

(a)    First, it implies a deeper and deeper awareness of ‘the intrinsic oneness of all phenomena

> analysis and attention’.109 ‘Abdu’l-Baha confirms the statement by the Arabic philosophers

> of the spiritual journey which he describes in the Seven Valleys.112 It is a goal to be pursued
> both at the inner level (search, studies, prayer, and meditation) and at the outer level (work,
> community life, and administrative service).

(b) Second, experiential knowledge creates a deeper awareness of the ephemerality of the self

> before God, a condition which Baha’u’llah describes in the Valley of True Poverty and
> Absolute Nothingness.

(c)    Third, this knowledge also implies the awareness that ‘all the Prophets and the Messengers of

God [are] as one soul and one body, as one light and one spirit’, that

> they have all arisen to proclaim His Cause and have established the laws of divine
> wisdom. They are, one and all, the Manifestations of His Self, the Repositories of His
> might, the Treasuries of His Revelation, the Dawning-Places of His splendour, and the
> Daysprings of His light. Through them are manifested the signs of sanctity in the
> realities of all things and the tokens of oneness in the essences of all beings. Through
> them are revealed the elements of glorification in the heavenly realities and the
> exponents of praise in the eternal essences. From them hath all creation proceeded and
> unto them shall return all that hath been mentioned.113

> The awareness of this concept is very important, because it is the necessary prerequisite for
> the abolition of the existing conflicts among religions, which are the reason most Western
> people do not rely on religions as remedies for the present problems of humankind.

(d) Fourth, this knowledge finally implies an inner urge to act according to the principles of

‘divine philosophy’, which are the kernel of morality.

109 ‘Abdu’l-Baha, Promulgation 284, cf. Majmū‘iy-i-Khaṭābāt 267; English translation: Promulgation 349.
110 ‘Abdu’l-Baha, Khaṭābāt-i-Mubārakih Ḥaḍrat-i-‘Abdu’l-Bahā dar Urūpā va Imrīkā (n.d., n.p.) 208; English translation:

Promulgation 349.
112 According to John S. Hatcher, the Valley of Unity is a transitional stage ‘between the two sets of three valleys, the first

> three pertaining to the acquisition of fundamental belief of faith, and the last three relating to the ineffable delights of
> certitude, confirmation and detachment which result form direct experience of spiritual realities’. John S. Hatcher, The
> Arc of Ascent: The Purpose of Physical Reality II (Oxford: George Ronald, 1994) 71.

113 Baha’u’llah, Gems of Divine Mysteries para. 44.

(2) A second fruit of ‘independent investigation’, strictly connected with the first one, is a

> progressive inner transformation that implies a deeper and deeper knowledge of reality and a
> greater capacity to create fruits of harmony, love, unity and peace. It is ‘spiritual progress’, of
> which ‘Abdu’l-Baha says: ‘Spiritual progress is through the breaths of the Holy Spirit and is
> the awakening of the conscious soul of man to perceive the reality of Divinity.’114

(3) A third fruit is the capacity of manifesting spiritual love towards all creation, a capacity

which is so important that spirituality is also defined as ‘love in action’.115

Therefore the principles of Baha’i theology, that is, divine philosophy or conscious knowledge of
spiritual reality and thus also of the intrinsic oneness of all phenomena and of the ephemerality of the
self, are the kernel of Baha’i life. They are in the writings. The Baha’is should study them and try to
understand their real meaning, in such a way that they may be in harmony with their fellow believers.
While exerting this effort, they should rely on the guidance of the Universal House of Justice, ‘the
supreme organ of the Baha’i Commonwealth’,116 which is empowered to enable the Baha’i Faith
‘even as a living organism, to expand and adapt itself to the needs and requirements of an ever-
changing society’117 and thus, Baha’is believe to infallibly guide the Baha’i community towards its
promised spiritual achievements.

The protection of the Faith
Baha’is should feel free to devote themselves to their theological studies with full confidence. Indeed
Baha’u’llah has created in his writings the conditions that enable them to avoid the pitfalls into which
most past theologians have fallen, elaborating those fruitless sciences from which Baha’u’llah enjoins
human beings to keep away.

Baha’u’llah has clearly stated that God, the central subject of each theology, is absolutely
unknowable. He wrote: ‘Whoso claimeth to have known Thee hath, by virtue of such a claim, testified
to his own ignorance; and whoso believeth himself to have attained unto Thee, all the atoms of the
earth would attest his powerlessness and proclaim his failure.’118 Baha’u’llah has moreover explicitly
stated that most of the issues cherished by the ancient theologians, issues from which in the past have
risen fruitless disquisitions, are beyond human understanding and thus it is useless trying to
completely explain them. Therefore, they will not be a fundamental part of Baha’i theology. With
these statements he has forever shut up any self-styled theologian who may claim a role of spiritual
leadership among his fellow beings.

Baha’u’llah has, explicitly and in detail, dealt in his writings with most theological issues which
have been an object of contention in the past. These issues have been explained by ‘Abdu’l-Baha and
Shoghi Effendi. All these explanations given by the three Central Figures of the Baha’i Faith119 are the
kernel of Baha’i theology. The Baha’is should but systematize them and Baha’i theology will be in
their hands. The Canadian Baha’i writer Jack McLean defines this kind of theology thus:

115 ‘Abdu’l-Baha, in ‘Join the Army of Peace’, Star of the West 13.5 (August 1922), 112.
116 Shoghi Effendi, The World Order of Bahá’u’lláh: Selected Letters, Wilmette, IL: Baha’i Publishing Trust, 1955), 7.
117 Shoghi Effendi, World Order 23.
118 Baha’u’llah, Prayers and Meditations 123.
119 The Baha’i International Archives have up to now collected about seven thousand of the fifteen thousand tablets

> reckoned to have been revealed by Baha’u’llah, more than fifteen thousand of the thirty thousand tablets thought to have
> been written by ‘Abdu’l-Baha, and sixteen thousand of the more than thirty thousand letters sent by Shoghi Effendi.

\[68\] TOWARDS A DEFINITION OF BAHA’I THEOLOGY AND MYSTICAL PHILOSOPHY

> Source theology or revelation theology . . . the authoritative, objective, and normative truths
> of the Bahá’í sacred writings or those elucidated by its duly appointed interpreters.
> Authoritative means that the teachings are binding on believers; objective means that the
> truths of source theology are commonly perceived as true by the community of believers;
> normative means that the teaching is recognized by believers as the standard of truth.120

In this vast literature, the writings by ‘Abdu’l-Baha occupy a vital position. In the first place, they
clarify a number of concepts revealed by Baha’u’llah from which may have risen misunderstandings.
In the second place, although those writings are considered infallible, they come from the pen of a
human being, and not of a Manifestation of God. Therefore they are a perfect example of a Baha’i
theological study.

Baha’u’llah has very clearly established that no one has the right to release an authoritative
interpretation of the writings, unless he has an explicit authorization in the writings themselves. And
this authorization has been granted only to ‘Abdu’l-Baha and Shoghi Effendi.121 Therefore although
the Baha’is may express personal interpretations of the theological issues dealt with in the writings,
while they are systematizing them, no one will ever be expected to give a normative value to those
interpretations. And the body of personal opinions of the Baha’is on the theological issues dealt with
in the writings, which McLean defines as ‘derivative theology’, will be but ‘the subjective, relative,
and non-binding elucidation of Baha’i teachings by competent scholars. Subjective here means that
the commentary is particular to the viewpoint of the writer.’122

Baha’u’llah has clearly forbidden any dispute whatever, and especially on religious issues.
Therefore any Baha’i who raises a theological dispute will automatically lose any credibility.

Baha’u’llah condemned those sciences ‘which begin with words and end with words’.123

Therefore Baha’i theology should certainly have important practical aspects. These are, first of all, the
‘rewards of excellence’ which, in ‘Abdu’l-Baha’s words, come from any ‘true philosophy (ḥikmat-i-
ḥaqīqī)’.124

Therefore it is likely that in the future there will be as many theologies as there are individuals
who will more or less systematically study theological issues. However, there will also be a Baha’i
theology developed by the Baha’i community at large, and which will reflect the level of
understanding of the writings achieved by the community as a whole. Of course, such a publicly
expressed theology will be both indirectly, and sometimes directly, guided by the Universal House of
Justice.

Features of Baha’i theology
Thus we may think that some of the features of the future Baha’i theology will be as follows:

(1) Theologians will never lose sight of the three fruits of divine philosophy – inner knowledge,

> spiritual progress, and an enhanced capacity of loving – that may be obtained only through
> the help of the Holy Spirit.

120 Jack McLean, ‘Prolegomena to a Bahá’í Theology’, in The Journal of Bahá’í Studies 5.1 (March–June 1992): 36.
121 cf. Baha’u’llah, Kitáb-i-Aqdas 82; Baha’u’llah, ‘Kitāb-i-‘Ahd’, in Tablets 221; ‘Abdu’l-Baha, Will and Testament of

‘Abdu’l-Bahá (Wilmette, IL: Baha’i Publishing Trust, 1944) 11.

122 McLean, ‘Prolegomena to a Bahá’í Theology’, in The Journal of Bahá’í Studies 5.1 (March–June 1992): 36.
123 Bahā’u’llāh, ‘Tajallīyāt’, Tablets 52.
124 ‘Abdu’l-Bahā, Tadhkiratu’l-Vafā 143; English translation: Memorials 92.

(2) It will be evolutionary, in the sense that Baha’i theology will reflect the growing awareness

of reality achieved by the community under the protection of the Universal House of Justice.
(3) Theologians will gradually pass from individual interpretations of Scripture, to a deeper

> understanding of Scripture ‘in its pure form’, free from ‘all sorts of ideas that are their
> own’.125
(4) A relatively simple language will evolve, fit to express the non-definitive and relative

character of the concepts.

> (5) There will be an absence of conflicts.
(6) Different schools of thought, in the sense of general tendencies, will be present. These

> schools of thought will not be authoritative and therefore they will not be conflicting, because
> the authority will remain in the writings and in their authoritative interpretations.

The fruit of the development of this theology will be that ‘divine civilization (madīnat-i-ilāhī)’126
which will characterize the future world civilization. Nay, its development will be one of the three
signs of the maturity of the human race, which are listed as follows:

— ‘the emergence of a science which is described as that “divine philosophy” which will

include the discovery of a radical approach to the transmutation of elements’;
> — ‘the selection of a single language and the adoption of a common script for all on earth to use’;
> — ‘no one will accept to bear the weight of kingship’.127

After these thoughts, we may suggest calling theology only the ‘derivative theology’, which will
develop in the course of time, and to continue calling ‘revealed theology’ ‘divine philosophy’
according to the terminology used by both Baha’u’llah and ‘Abdu’l-Baha. It will be thus more clearly
recognized that, far from being dangerous, useless or unimportant, theology or ‘divine philosophy’ is
a central aspect of Baha’i life.
