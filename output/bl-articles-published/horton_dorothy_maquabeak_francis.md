Beyond Red Power:
The Alternative Activism
of Dorothy Maquabeak Francis
CHELSEA HORTON

Abstract
The 1960s and 70s were volatile decades during which Aboriginal people across
Canada arose as an increasingly vocal, and sometimes militant, political force.
This paper explores the alternative activist approach of Dorothy Maquabeak
Francis, a prominent Aboriginal Bahá’í who worked tirelessly over five decades to
promote and maintain Aboriginal culture and spirituality and to foster heightened
understanding and unity between Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal groups.
Francis’s life suggests that we must broaden our conceptions of activism to
encompass both the grassroots and the spiritual, thus complicating our under-
standings of what has for too long been characterized as the “Red Power era.”

Résumé
Les années 1960 et 1970 ont été des décennies d’effervescence au cours
desquelles les Autochtones partout au Canada se sont mobilisés comme force
politique de plus en plus revendicatrice, parfois même radicale. Le présent article
explore une autre façon de militer, celle de Dorothy Maquabeak Francis, une
bahá’íe autochtone de renom qui s’est employée sans relâche, pendant plus d’un
demi-siècle, à promouvoir et à préserver la culture et la spiritualité autochtones,
ainsi qu’à encourager la compréhension et l’unité entre les groupes autochtones
et non autochtones. Sa vie elle-même nous invite à élargir nos conceptions du
militantisme pour englober à la fois l’approche communautaire et l’approche
spirituelle, ce qui vient compliquer notre compréhension de ce que l’on a défini
pendant trop longtemps comme « l’ère du Pouvoir Rouge ».

Resumen
Los años 1960 y 70 fueron décadas volátiles en que los pueblos Aborígenes a lo
largo de Canadá surgieron como una fuerza política, intenta de hacerse oir cada
vez más y a veces militante. Este escrito examina el camino de activismo alterna-
tivo seguido por Dorothy Maquabeak Francis, una aborígen bahá’í quién trabajó
incansablemente durante cinco décadas para promover y mantener la cultura y
espiritualidad Aborígen en pos del acrecentimiento de la unidad y comprensión
entre los grupos Aborígenes y no Aborígenes. La vida de Francis sugiere que
debemos de ampliar nuestros conceptos de activismo para abarcar a la vez los fun-
damentos del arraigo poblano y lo espiritual, complicando así nuestra comprensión
de lo que por demasiado tiempo se ha caracterizado como la época del Poder Rojo.

In Québec City, Québec, her photograph hangs alongside those of other
prominent female figures at the recently opened Bahá’í Office for the
Advancement of Women. At Harper Mountain, near Kamloops, British
Columbia, her memory is honored at a Native Bahá’í Council. In
Aldergrove, a rural suburb of Vancouver, those close to her gather to
mourn the loss and celebrate the memory of their beloved relative and
friend.1 Fifteen years after her passing, Dorothy Maquabeak Francis still
serves as an inspiration to family and friends, to acquaintances and
strangers alike. Memorial ceremonies continue to be held in her honor and
physical monuments erected in testament to the far-reaching impact of
her manifold social, cultural, economic, and spiritual contributions to
Canadian society.2 With emotion, those close to her share stories and
memories of a proud, dignified, strong, and noble “spiritual powerhouse”
deeply committed to giving voice to and instilling a sense of self-worth
and identity among Canada’s Aboriginal population. A woman who
reflected her ideals and ambitions as much in her own character as in her
actions, Francis is remembered as artist, singer, storyteller, dancer, social
and cultural worker, teacher, traditionalist, spiritual leader, Bahá’í, friend,
sister, wife, mother, grandmother, elder.

Francis initiated her life of activism during her early days as a young
married mother living on a Saskatchewan reserve. She worked over five
decades, at grassroots and official levels, to promote the maintenance of

Beyond Red Power                              37

Aboriginal culture and spirituality as well as to foster heightened under-
standing and unity between Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal groups.
Francis contributed, among other things, to the opening of Canada’s first
Native Friendship Centres, to the establishment of a variety of Aboriginal
cultural organizations throughout Western Canada, and to the initiation
of an Aboriginal spirituality program within British Columbian correc-
tional facilities. She was a skilled artist and performer: she hosted a num-
ber of radio and television programs concerning Prairie Aboriginal cul-
ture, participated in such events as the 1967 Canadian Centennial celebra-
tions, and crafted fine beadwork that remains on display at the Royal
Ontario Museum in Toronto. In her capacity as a representative in such
official bodies as the Federation of Saskatchewan Indians, and the
National Advisory Board of the Department of Indian Affairs and
Northern Development, and as chair of the National Indian Arts and
Crafts Advisory Committee, Francis promoted Aboriginal arts and crafts
as an economic as well as cultural endeavor. As an early Aboriginal
adherent and prominent figure in the Canadian Bahá’í community,
Francis contributed to the significant spread of the Bahá’í religion
among Aboriginal people in Canada from 1960 onward. She both advo-
cated and embodied the Bahá’í principle of unity in diversity and worked
with Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal people alike in pursuit of what one
friend characterizes as “practical peace” (Bastow). A powerful spiritual
figure within both the Aboriginal and Bahá’í worlds, Francis blessed and
lent support to personal and collective initiatives through her prayer and
her presence.

Despite such significant contributions and commemoration within specif-
ic circles, however, Dorothy Maquabeak Francis remains largely unknown.
Facing the double burden of being both Aboriginal and a woman, Francis
has until now not received the recognition that she deserves. Indeed, her
story illustrates the extent to which previously marginalized groups may
not simply be appended to the existing narrative; when we fill in the
historiographical gap by placing Francis within it, this narrative itself
must change.

Aboriginal activism of the 1960s and 1970s is frequently conceptualized
38            The Journal of Bahá’í Studies 14. 3/4. 2004

in terms of “Red Power,” an often militant, radical, and separatist Native
rights movement. This view, however, is too narrow. During this period
there existed no unified consensus on how to improve the standing and
treatment of Aboriginal people in North America. While the revival of
“tradition” and the spread of pan-Indigenous cultural and spiritual forms
were central to both Francis’s activism as well as that of her Red Power
counterparts, her activism predated the Red Power movement and
stressed understanding and unity over confrontation and separation. In
examining what may be deemed the integrated cultural and spiritual
activism of Dorothy Maquabeak Francis, this paper seeks to encourage a
widened conception of activism and to argue that Francis’s actions, long
overshadowed by the militancy and visibility of the Red Power move-
ment, were a significant and influential element of the activism of this
period.

Francis’s life story challenges static conceptions of Aboriginal identity
and reinforces the importance of acknowledging the multiplicity of iden-
tities and influences that work in concert to shape individuals’ actions. We
cannot separate or compartmentalize her social, cultural, racial, econom-
ic, political, and spiritual selves. Rather, we can characterize her activism
as the product of her status as an Aboriginal/Bahá’í/woman. To accu-
rately contextualize her activist approach, we begin with a brief survey of
Francis’s early life and discussion of her multiple sites of identity and
inspiration.

ID E N T I T I E S   AND INSPIRATIONS

Born on 22 March 1912 on the Waywayseecappo Reserve in Manitoba,
Francis was the daughter of a Saulteaux woman, Emma Francis; and a
British train conductor, William Ashton. She spent her first seven years
with her maternal gr andmother, who instilled in her an appreciation for
Saulteaux language and custom. Documentary and oral sources repeat-
edly emphasize these early years as critical to the foundation of Francis’s
powerful sense of identification with the Saulteaux Nation.3 With the
exception of an inter view with Francis herself (“Interview with

Beyond Red Power                               39

Dorothy Maquabeak Francis”), these accounts do not include mention of
poverty or other negative colonial-induced factors that characterized life
on reserve. Thus, while such accounts, to a degree, may romanticize and
idealize Francis’s early life, they nevertheless underline the formative
impact of these first seven years. As an anonymous observer commented
late in Francis’s life, “It was the spiritual teachings of her people, instilled
in Dorothy by her Grandmother, that gave Dorothy the determination,
the faith, and the strength to accomplish as much as she did in the ser-
vice of her people” (“Dorothy M. Francis”). Lyn Crompton, a close
friend and student of Francis’s, characterizes this period boldly as “the
source of her greatness.” Although Francis was of mixed descent, she
was and still is rarely referred to as such—a fact that indicates a power-
ful distinction between imposed official designations and more practical
concepts of status and identity. Quick to correct those who addressed
her as “mixed,” Dorothy identified primarily with her Saulteaux her-
itage.4

Despite this self-identification, however, Francis was severed from her
roots for over a decade. In what is an all too familiar story, she was
forcibly removed from her family and community in 1919 and taken to
attend Birtle Indian Residential School in southwestern Manitoba. Her
early years at the school were not pleasant ones. During her time at
Birtle, where she lived for all but two summer months of each year,
Francis was taunted and harassed by older female students. She later
recalled she was a “‘frightened, unhappy, little girl’” (qtd. in van Eldik
17).5 Birtle was typical of residential schools in Canada. Elements such
as disease, gender-specific manual and domestic training, and Christian
religious instruction all figured prominently in school life.6 Echoing the
sentiments of other former residential school students the nation over,
Francis commented in 1978 that “’to be in one of those institutions is
like being in jail’” (qtd. in van Eldik 17).

Francis’s residential school experience, however, diverged from that of
other students at Birtle when, in 1923, she was unofficially adopted into
the family of the new Presbyterian school principal, the Reverend F. E.
Pitts. Shortly after the ar rival of the Pitts family the previous year, their

40            The Journal of Bahá’í Studies 14. 3/4. 2004

twelve-year-old son Allan Tu rn bull drowned in the nearby Birdtail
River. After this event, Francis joined Pitts, his wife Nellie, and their
remaining three children—William Chesley, Ketha, and Lois—in the
principal’s quarters (Adams, “Alberni”; Adams, “Supplement”). Francis
continued to attend Birtle with the other Aboriginal students, but when
Pitts was transferred in 1927 she moved with the family to Alber ni,
British Columbia. While she lived on the Alberni Residential School
grounds, Francis attended the local high school—a fact that reflected
both the limitations of residential school education as well as the seem-
ing willingness of the Pitts family to encourage Aboriginal students to
pursue instruction beyond that available at institutions like Alberni
(Adams, “Supplement”).7 At the age of eighteen, homesick for her fami-
ly and community, Francis returned to the Waywayseecappo Reserve in
Manitoba.

In subsequent years Francis remained in close contact with the Pitts
family and spoke very highly of them.8 Ketha Adams (née Pitts), the
Pitts child Francis appears to have kept in closest contact with, and
whom Dorothy’s own children later referred to as “Grandma Pitts,” con-
sidered Dorothy a sister and turned to her for advice concerning her
own social activism in the Alberni Valley.9 Francis’s comment to Adams
that “[t]he only way I have of repaying you people for what you did for
me . . . is to do all in my power to carry on the same sort of work for my
people as you were doing” suggests that the Pitts family did indeed have
a foundational impact upon their foster daughter (qtd. in Adams,
Letter).10 Francis’s exposure to the Reverend Mr. Pitts and his family’s
liberal Christian philosophy and actions no doubt influenced her vigor-
ous social activism. 11 Indeed, she reflects a historical pattern of resi-
dential school students subsequently adopting leadership positions
within the Aboriginal community (see Raibmon). Armed with the tools
of dominant society and able to “walk in both worlds” (Elinor Bennett,
telephone interview), Francis deployed her academic and domestic
training to the benefit of those the colonial system was designed to
oppress.
The Homemakers Club she initiated on the Kahkewistahaw Reserve in

Beyond Red Power                            41

Saskatchewan is a fine example of such an endeavor. After attending
school for a period in Manitoba (Adams, “Supplement”), Francis had
returned to the Waywayseecapo Reserve where in a period of six weeks
she was married and widowed: her young husband, Magnus Martin, died
tragically in a hunting accident. It was at this point that Francis was
given the powerful Saulteaux name “Maquabeak”—which translates best
into English as “Bear Sitting Woman”—by her elders.12 She began to
recover from her loss, and in 1932 she married Joseph Francis of the
Kahkewistahaw Reserve near Broadview, Saskatchewan. There she gave
birth to eleven children, nine of whom survived past childhood, and initi-
ated the reserve’s first Homemakers Club. In her grassroots organizing,
Francis employed both her English language skills and her domestic
training to secure material goods such as sewing machines and fabrics
and to share knowledge of their use, to the benefit of other women and
families on the reserve (Adams, Excerpt).

The seemingly positive exposure to non-Aboriginal society that
Francis received while living with the Pitts family may have influenced
her decision to adopt a more inclusive rather than separatist approach
in her activism. Many who knew her stress Francis’s generosity in shar-
ing her knowledge; she did not limit her teachings to Aboriginal people
alone. 13 Through personal interaction in which she took non-
Aboriginal individuals into the world of Saulteaux ritual, as well as
through innumerable public engagements and performances in which
she spoke of and demonstrated her cultural and spiritual fo rm s, Francis
worked to foster understanding between Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal
societies.14 In addition to encouraging an integrated strand of activism,
Francis’s time with the Pitts family may have influenced her later deci-
sion to work within dominant structures. Having seen Pitts and his
family supporting aspects of Aboriginal culture from inside the resi-
dential school system (see note 11 above), Francis may have been more
inclined to articulate her position within the official sphere and accept
roles such as the chair of the National Indian Arts and Crafts
Committee in 1974.

In addition to affecting the nature of her activism, Francis’s time with
42            The Journal of Bahá’í Studies 14. 3/4. 2004

the Pitts family may also have impacted her religious and spiritual out-
look. While Francis identified strongly with her Saulteaux heritage and
taught arts and crafts techniques and spiritual practices from the Prairie
region,15 she also identified with a more universal concept of Aboriginal
spirituality. As she explained to a re porter in the late 1960s, “‘Our Indian
religion is basically the same all over North America. We all believe in
one Great Spirit called God by the white man’” (qtd. in Whitehouse).
During the period when she was removed from her home community for
over a decade and placed in a residential school with students from a
diversity of Aboriginal backgrounds, it is possible that Francis first
connected with a form of universal Aboriginal spirituality. It is also con-
ceivable that Francis’s exposure to Presbyterianism and the United
Church affected her potential receptivity to the Bahá’í Faith.16 Although
he treats an earlier time period than that of Francis’s declaration, Will
van den Hoonaard suggests in The Origins of the Bahá’í Community of
Canada, 1898–1948 that those of “liberal Protestant”—most specifically,
Methodist—background proved particularly open to the Bahá’í mes-
sage.17

Francis attended Christian church services and participated in allied
social events not only at residential school, but also on the Kahkewistahaw
Reserve and in the city of Regina, to which she and her family moved
following their enfranchisement in 1953.18 An interview with Francis
late in her life, however, reveals that while “she learned a deep respect
for the Christian faith” as a youth, she felt that “the true signs of that
faith . . . were not evident in the lives of most professing believe rs ”
(Jauk). It was late during the 1950s that Francis was first introduced to
the Bahá’í Faith by Angus Cowan. The two had traveled together to visit
friends in prison on the outskirts of Regina, and on their way back to the
city they pulled over to the side of the road to say prayers. Dorothy was
so moved by the prayer Angus shared that he promptly ripped the page
out of his prayer book and presented it to her (Verge 48–49, 307).
Although she was deeply touched by this act, and while friends report
that “she just kept running into Bahá’ís” during this period (McNeil,
telephone interview), it was not until 1960, while living briefly in

Beyond Red Power                               43

Calgary, that Dorothy and her husband Joseph together officially
declared their belief in the Bahá’í Faith. The couple are cited among the
first nineteen Aboriginal Bahá’ís in Canada (Verge 307).

Francis’s connection with the Bahá’í Faith affected not only her own
personal sense of religious identity and affiliation, but also that of other
Aboriginal people throughout Canada. Becoming active immediately upon
joining the Faith, Francis participated in systematic Bahá’í teaching cam-
paigns among Canada’s Western Aboriginal population. Motivated to a
large degree by what has been characterized as the sole “specific racial
prophecy in all of the Bahá’í scriptures” (Pemberton-Piggot 34), such pro-
grams were initiated at the local, national, and international levels of
Bahá’í administration in efforts to fulfill the directive expressed by
‘Abdu’l-Bahá in the Tablets of the Divine Plan:

Attach great importance to the indigenous population of America.

> For these souls may be likened unto the ancient inhabitants of the
> Arabian Peninsula, who, prior to the Mission of Muhammad, were
> like unto savages. When the light of Muhammad shone forth in their
> midst, however, they became so radiant as to illumine the world.
> Likewise, these Indians, should they be educated and guided, there
> can be no doubt that they will become so illumined as to enlighten the
> whole world. (Tablets 33)

As the Bahá’í Faith has neither a clergy nor a paid missionary force, indi-
vidual believers held the responsibility to bring the message of
Bahá’u’lláh to Aboriginal Canada and fulfill the numeric goals established
by the Bahá’í administration during specific teaching plans (Pemberton-
Piggot 44). 19 In her role as traveling teacher, Francis reflected the pat-
tern of “native-white traveling teams” in which, as Andrew Pemberton-
Piggot explains, Aboriginal adherents were considered “essential for
advice, identifying likely converts in their own territories, translation, and
providing legitimacy to white Bahá’ís by their very presence” (42). Visiting
Prairie reserves with such prominent figures as Angus Cowan and Tom
Anaquod, and participating in such events as a deepening workshop held

44            The Journal of Bahá’í Studies 14. 3/4. 2004

for Aboriginal believers in Regina in February 1964,20 Francis con-
tributed to a process that saw over twenty-four hundred Aboriginal peo-
ple—roughly equivalent to one quarter of the Canadian Bahá’í popula-
tion at the time—join the Faith between the years of 1953 and 1979
(Filson).21

Francis continued this pattern of Bahá’í service for the remainder of
her days. Beyond serving, at various times, on the Canadian National
Teaching Committee, the Continental Indigenous Council, and several
Local Spiritual Assemblies, and as coordinator for Indian Teaching in
British Columbia, Francis also attended events and conferences through-
out Canada, the United States, and Mexico in her capacity as an elected
Bahá’í re presentative. In March 1978 she traveled on pilgrimage to the
Bahá’í Shrines in Israel and had the privilege of being invited to tea with
Rúh. íyyih Khánum in Haifa.22

In contrast to many of those living on isolated reserves, Dorothy and
her husband had greater opportunities to interact with Bahá’ís on a sus-
tained basis and were able to overcome the challenge of translating formal
Bahá’í membership into practical adherence, something many Aboriginal
people who enrolled during the flurry of Bahá’í teaching activity in the
1960s and 1970s were unable to do.23 The two made a conscious effort to
study the Bahá’í teachings and to apply them practically to their lives
(Sargent). Because of such experiences as residential schooling and living
with the Pitts family, as well as residing in an urban environment, Francis
was likely one of those “’Native friends’” that the National Spiritual
Assembly acknowledged in 1986 as having been able to “‘effectively reach
. . . [as they] were able to cross the cultural barrier to us’” (qtd. in
Pemberton-Piggot 72).24

Francis herself was a valuable asset for the Bahá’í community and a
figure to whom the community could point as evidence for the success-
ful implementation of the Bahá’í principle of unity in diversity. Speaking
with some non-Aboriginal Bahá’ís who knew Francis, one gains the
sense that despite the undoubted sincerity of their relations, association
with an Aboriginal person such as Francis, the quintessential and exotic

“Other” within the Canadian context, served as a source of pride and
evidence of individual promotion of the principle of racial unity.25 A
close friend with whom Dorothy participated in early Aboriginal teaching
efforts on the West Coast of British Columbia notes that even at the time
she felt a certain degree of guilt for the vast extent to which the Bahá’í
community made demands on early Aboriginal adherents such as Dorothy
(Elinor Bennett, personal interview). Indeed, Francis’s vigorous Bahá’í
activity frequently drew her away from her own family, which, “through-
out all her traveling and work,” “continued to manage on its own”
(Bernard).

Francis was attracted by such Bahá’í principles as progressive revela-
tion and unity in diversity. She frequently drew on the concept of one
Creator, coupled with a belief in the oneness of humanity, as a parallel
between the Bahá’í Faith and Aboriginal spiritual forms. She told
reporters that, in her view, the Bahá’í Faith “‘stresses the same enduring
basics—God, nature, tranquility’”—as do Aboriginal forms of spirituali-
ty (Alsop 2). She explained: “As a Bahai I have confirmation for my belief
in the authenticity of the spiritual teachings of my people and the impor-
tance of our heritage” (“Interview with Dorothy Maquabeak Francis”).
Francis was empowered by her faith in Bahá’u’lláh and gained a sense of
self-confidence through her Bahá’í teaching work, growing from an
introverted Aboriginal woman “not long off the Reserve” into a skilled
and sought-after public speaker (Verge 76).26 As Patricia Verge explains,
“Dorothy would later encourage the Bahá’ís to turn to God before they
spoke. ‘If ever you try that some day, really a miracle happens. That hap-
pened to me many times, I don’t know what I said, but it was good what-
ever it was’” (Verge 76). By 1977, seventeen years after joining the
Bahá’í Faith, Francis proclaimed that “[i]t gives me great joy to serve
this cause, because to me it is the only way” (“Interview with Dorothy
Francis”).

Those who knew her have noted the effective balance that Francis
struck between the Aboriginal and the Bahá’í aspects of her self (see, for
example, Crompton; Heinel). In addition to being a prominent Bahá’í

46            The Journal of Bahá’í Studies 14. 3/4. 2004

figure, Francis has been described as a “spiritual powerhouse” within the
Aboriginal context—as a medicine woman with the gift to “spark your
spirit,” who believed dee ply in the need to reassert Aboriginal spirituali-
ty as a source of strength, pride, and identity among Canada’s Aboriginal
population.27 Francis did not “convert” in the sense that she abandoned
her traditional Aboriginal practices upon adopting the Bahá’í Faith.
Rather, she employed the space provided by the principles of progressive
revelation and unity in diversity to advance Aboriginal concerns. She
seemingly drew no distinction between her Aboriginal and her Bahá’í
selves, between Aboriginal forms of spirituality and the Bahá’í Faith: “‘I
feel that all good teachings come from the same source, one God and one
mankind’” (qtd. in Secretary of State 96). When asked to bless a function
or event, she was as likely to deliver a Saulteaux invocation passed down
to her by her grandfather as she was a Bahá’í prayer on unity (McNeil,
personal interview; “Indian Powwow”). While she did not always overtly
articulate the connection, her faith in Bahá’u’lláh and her desire for the
fulfillment of his teachings nevertheless underwrote her attempts to reaf-
firm “‘the truths and strengths of my own Indian heritage’” (qtd. in
Alsop).28

It is clear even from an admittedly limited review of Francis’s early life
and her spiritual affiliations that her life story challenges static concep-
tions of Aboriginal identity. Indeed, although she self-identified as
Saulteaux, we must take into consideration the disruptive impact that liv-
ing with a white family no doubt had upon Francis’s knowledge of and
access to Saulteaux cultural and spiritual forms. In addition to possibly
encouraging a sense of identification with a form of universal pan-
Indigenous spirituality, Francis’s time with the Pitts family may also have
influenced the activist forms she later implemented both on the
Kahkewistahaw Reserve as well as within various urban and reserve con-
texts. Despite being severed from her roots at an early age, Francis nev-
ertheless returned as a young woman to her native Prairie region, where
she identified with and put into practice those Saulteaux traditions—lan-
guage, arts and crafts, dance, prayer, and ritual—that had resisted colonial

attempts at extermination. Francis’s adoption of the Bahá’í Faith did not
abrogate such practices or her sense of identity, but rather complemented
them and actively encouraged their maintenance. It is with such varying
influences in mind that we turn now to a more specific examination of
Francis’s activist forms as well as a comparison and contrast with the
dominant Red Power movement.

BEYOND RED POWER: T HE POLITICS OF CULTURE AND SPIRITUALITY

Despite Dorothy’s personal attempts to improve life on the
Kahkewistahaw Reserve, the Francis family “’disagreed with the admin-
istration there’” (qtd. in Alsop), and in 1953 they—along with many oth-
ers migrating from reserve to urban environments in this period—made
the difficult decision to forfeit their official Indian status and treaty
rights and move to Regina (Alsop; Bernard).29 Their enfranchisement
made official in December of that year, the family pitched tents on the
outskirts of town, and Joseph and Dorothy set about securing manual
and domestic employment to support themselves and their children. 30
This period of transition was an extremely difficult one for Francis as
the attitudes of discrimination and sentiments of inferiority she had
encountered on reserve were intensified in the urban context. As she
explained: “‘I never felt I was smart enough to have an argument with a
white person. Sometimes I would get so mad about things but I felt I
would say something wrong and feel terrible about it later. So I just
never said anything’” (qtd. in van Eldik). It was Francis’s own personal
experience that bolstered her resolve to develop and promote services
for the benefit of Aboriginal people in urban and reserve contexts alike.
Her activism was strongly motivated by recognition of “the g reat need
for Indian people to arise and have a voice” (“Interview with Dorothy
Maquabeak Francis”). In promoting pride in Aboriginal identity, Francis
sought to empower, “helping the people to better themselves” (Francis,
Letter).

Much of Francis’s activism took the form of participation in grassroots
48            The Journal of Bahá’í Studies 14. 3/4. 2004

organizations, many of which she personally helped launch. In Regina,
Francis volunteered with the Regina Native Society, and her work led to
the eventual establishment of a Friendship Centre in that city. Following
a move to Winnipeg in the early 1960s, Francis worked as a counselor,
activities manager, and handicrafts instructor at Canada’s first
Friendship Centre, which had opened in 1958. At the Vancouver Centre
over a decade later, Francis similarly served as an arts and crafts instruc-
tor and board member. In providing background information and sharing
her firsthand experience both through correspondence and in person,
Francis also contributed in a more indirect manner to the establishment
of Centres in Port Alberni and Calgary.31 Francis founded the Regina
Indian Cultural Club as well as powwow clubs in Regina, Winnipeg, and
Vancouver. She also belonged to such associations as the New
Westminster Indian Club and Seattle War Dance Club, as well as the
Northwest Cultural Society.

The maintenance and revitalization of Aboriginal culture and spiritual-
ity, and their promotion as a source of pride for Aboriginal Canada, were
key elements driving Francis’s activism. Consider, for example, her work
with various Friendship Centres. From their earliest days, these Centres
were designed to ease the transition of Aboriginal people migrating from
rural reserve environments to urban ones and provided information, coun-
seling and referral services, fellowship, and understanding.32 It has been
noted of the Vancouver context that during the initial period of
Friendship Centre activity cultural concerns were subordinated to more
pragmatic and seemingly pressing issues such as housing, health, and
social services (Lindsay 68). A 1963 Winnipeg Tribune article outlining the
role of that city’s Centre echoes this emphasis upon “everyday” issues of
material survival (“Indians Find Centre”). Francis in no respect rejected
such concerns. Indeed, she and husband Joseph lived very modest lives
(Benndorf interview; Jordan-Bastow). Acutely aware of the poverty,
unemployment, and attendant social problems ravaging Aboriginal com-
munities both on and off reserve, Francis supported, and participated
directly in providing, such services as referrals and counseling. Culture

and spirituality, however, were not considerations that could be shelved
until such time as the Aboriginal community had overcome economic and
social marginalization and achieved a deserved place of respect within
Canadian society at large. Rather, for Francis they were the very tools by
which to help encourage this shift.

In teaching arts and crafts, in encouraging the celebration of powwows,
in promoting a sense of pride in Aboriginal heritage and practice, Francis
sought to empower the Canadian Aboriginal community. While she would
go on, in the official sphere, to promote arts and crafts as a viable eco-
nomic endeavor,33 her activism was more broadly characterized by her
grassroots efforts to instill a sense of self-worth as well as individual
responsibility within the Aboriginal community.34 Long-time friend Rose
Heinel, for example, remembers with fondness the sense of empowerment
she gained from Francis’s encouragement. The two women shared a com-
mon Ojibwa heritage and met in 1967 while Francis was teaching arts and
crafts at the Vancouver Friendship Centre. Although Heinel was already
practicing beadwork and jewelry making at this time, she cites Francis as
“one of my inspirations”: “She encouraged me to continue with it, and to
this day, look what I do.” Heinel is an accomplished professional artist
whose jewelry and beadwork are in high demand throughout Canada and
beyond.

Of particular significance is the timing of Francis’s activist effo rt s.

The Potlatch Law amendment to the Indian Act, which forbade
Aboriginal cultural practices such as the potlatch and the sun dance, was
repealed only in 1951, and the overriding political, social, and economic
climate remained severely constrictive and discriminatory towards
Aboriginal people (Ray 230). Within Aboriginal communities them-
selves, the ravages of social and economic marginalization and afflic-
tions such as alcoholism had seemingly turned attention away from cul-
ture towards concerns of everyday sur vival.35 Indeed, during the early
years of Francis’s activist work, youth “used to laugh at her and ask her
why she was bothering” (Bernard). In this sense, Francis was very much
a trailblazer, and it was largely due to her efforts “in keeping Native

50            The Journal of Bahá’í Studies 14. 3/4. 2004

Indian culture alive during a time when few others were passing on
Native traditions to the next generation” (Richardson Logie 36) that she
was awarded such honors as the Chatelaine Golden Key pin for merito-
rious service in 1964 and was invested as a Member of the Order of
Canada in 1978.36

Francis’s activist approach may be effectively contrasted with more rad-
ical Aboriginal forms of protest that emerged in the 1960s. During this
period, throughout North America, a growing recognition of the plight of
minority groups, the civil rights movement and the “war on poverty,” the
rise of student activism, resistance to the Vietnam War, and increased
urban migration by Aboriginal people all fomented an atmosphere
increasingly conducive to Aboriginal activism.37 In the United States,
with the emergence of Red Power, such groups such as the American
Indian Movement (AIM) increasingly deployed highly visible and contro-
versial tactics such as the 1969 occupation of Alcatraz Island and the 1973
siege at Wounded Knee.38 While Red Power was undoubtedly a heteroge-
neous movement, populated by a diversity of participants with varying
activist strategies, the movement is predominantly remembered for its
radical tactics and initiatives.39 As Johnson, Champagne, and Nagel
explain, Red Power was a highly media-savvy strain of activism that
played upon romantic and stereotypic images such as “the male warrior”
(Wilkins 218) in order to “dramatize Indian problems and protests”
(Johnson, Champagne, and Nagel 306). 40

Red Power spilled over the border to Canada, where national events
such as the publication of the 1967 Hawthorn Report—which character-
ized the status of Canadian Aboriginal people as “citizens minus”—and
the 1969 release of the White Paper—which, in its aim to foster a “just
society,” outlined the termination of special “Indian status”—were
already galvanizing groups such as the National Indian Brotherhood
(later the Assembly of First Nations) into action (Ray 330–35). The
issues of self-determination, treaty rights, and land claims all came to
dominate the Aboriginal political landscape. The tactics and initiatives of
such groups are rightly characterized as highly political forms of activism.

They are political, however, in a traditional sense of the word: their
actions were tailored as an overt and direct message to governmental
institutions.

It is no doubt such a traditional conception of activism and the politi-
cal—understood primarily in terms of public partisan activity and con-
frontation with government—that motivated a longtime acquaintance of
Francis to remark that of all the things she was, Dorothy was never an
activist (Bastow). Indeed, Francis was not an advocate of Red Power, nor
did she participate in endeavors such as the land claims process.41 Her
actions, however, were profoundly political in a broader sense and repre-
sent forms of activism both grassroots and spiritual which must be
acknowledged as legitimate and effective.

Conceptions of the political have now been widened to include broader
questions of “power, domination, and ‘respect’ at home, at work, and in the
community” (Goldberg Moses and Hartmann xxiv–xxv).42 Politics, in
essence, involves “contests over power and control” (Smith Crocco,
Munro, and Weiler 9), regardless of the level—state, local, or otherwise—
where such contestations are played out. Thus grassroots organizing and
its attendant social networks are highly political entities.43 Promoting
social change and exerting influence upon public policy, however, can take
place without engaging in partisan contest or adversarial confrontation
with governmental institutions.

In asserting the legitimacy of Aboriginal tradition and spirituality and
in actively encouraging its maintenance, Francis engaged in an implicitly
political critique of government policy, which for centuries had attempted
to suppress these very elements. This was undoubtedly a contest “over
power and control,” over who possessed both the ability and right to
determine and shape Aboriginal culture, spirituality, and identity. Similarly,
in her very assertion that “culture is more important than politics” (van
Eldik), Francis took a political stand on the effectiveness of employing the
mainstream political system as a site for effecting change. While she did
serve for a limited period as representative and even chairperson within the
highly political realms of both provincial and federal advisory boards,

52            The Journal of Bahá’í Studies 14. 3/4. 2004

Francis was not content to work solely at the policy level and made cer-
tain to strike an effective balance between the federal, the provincial, and
the local; and between the official and the grassroots.44 As she stressed
bluntly, for example, regarding the need to couple national arts and crafts
policy and program development with grassroots organization and input:
“‘[W]ithout them you would have no program’” (qtd. in “Interview with
Dorothy Francis”).

Lyn Crompton, a lawyer who works on behalf of Aboriginal people,
proposes a further component of Francis’s contributions. Characterizing
her as a “spiritual activist,” Crompton explains that while Francis did
not have a full understanding of politics in the traditional sense—in
terms of legal structures and the like—she nevertheless applied her spir-
itual powers within overtly political realms. To illustrate this point,
Crompton describes how Francis served as the key “power prayer” behind
her work, in one instance granting her the ability to perform during a
lengthy legal case on only a few hours of sleep per night and in another
investing strength in the Lil’wat people and their supporters during the
high-profile 1990 Duffy Lake roadblock in British Columbia.45 Crompton
rightly characterizes this deployment of “focused spiritual power” as “a
level of activism most of us haven’t yet even considered.” As she
explains:

> It made judges weep, and judges made decisions that they’d never
> made before, it made . . . judges release people, it made history . . . but
> it was unknown history for the most part and still remains because no
> one knew in particular of this powerhouse that was behind us, so it’s
> a power that most of us yet don’t know about. That’s activism.

While mainstream scholarship remains skeptical of nonquantifiable ele-
ments such as prayer, these words reinforce that we must indeed widen our
conceptions of activism in order to encompass such powerful contribu-
tions. Indeed, we must challenge entrenched academic approaches to the
study of religion and spirituality where, in the interests of quantification,

little room is left for the element of genuine faith and religious conviction,
much less the reality of spiritual systems of belief.46

We must underscore the extent to which Francis’s activist ambition and
form was shaped by her commitment as a Bahá’í, by her desire for the ful-
fillment of Bahá’u’lláh’s teachings. Consider, for example, the integrated
nature of her activism, her insistence on working within and for Aborig-
inal and non-Aboriginal societies alike.47 While many advocates of Red
Power advanced a distinct Aboriginal identity as the basis for claims of
self-determination, treaty, and land rights, Francis stressed unity over
separatism and issued calls for “a spiritual renewal” of “one mankind”
(Richardson Logie 39). Francis’s work within British Columbian correc-
tional facilities, an endeavor she undertook after a severe stroke in 1978
limited her ability to travel extensively (“Dorothy M. Francis”), repre-
sents a practical application of this goal.48 Francis sought to raise cultural
awareness on the part of both inmates and prison guards. Working with
guards during their training program, she provided context for the over-
representation of Aboriginal people in the Canadian penal system as well
as insight into practices such as smudges and sweats that she was instru-
mental in introducing within correctional facilities. For the Aboriginal
inmates themselves, she similarly provided direction concerning such
practices, instilling a sense of self-worth and pride in Aboriginal her-
itage.49

Francis targeted diverse audiences through her numerous public speak-
ing engagements,50 through her performance on radio, television,51 and
within such forums as the Centennial celebrations, as well as through her
collection, documentation, and interpretation of Saulteaux legend and
song.52 She worked closely with many non-Aboriginal Bahá’ís, organizing
such events as powwows and assisting in the foundation of programs such
as a drug and alcohol treatment center in the Okanagan region of British
Columbia.53 Francis was generous with her knowledge (Voyageur); she
not only raised awareness and respect for Aboriginal tradition, but she
also shared it with the wider world. Non-Aboriginal friends and students
of hers, both Bahá’í and non-Bahá’í, speak with great emotion of having

54            The Journal of Bahá’í Studies 14. 3/4. 2004

been drawn into the powerful world of Aboriginal spirituality, of being
introduced to practices such as sundancing that continue to serve them as
sources of both strength and inspiration (Crompton; Jordan-Bastow).

Francis’s integrated activism, her insistence on working within and for
Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal societies alike, may be viewed as one of
the fundamental ways in which her approach differed from that of the
Red Power movement. Indeed, despite the powerful impact of Francis’s
firm belief in the concept of unity, that conviction nevertheless divided
her from some of her contemporaries. As Sonny Voyageur, an Aboriginal
friend and student of Dorothy’s, has explained, there were factions with-
in “Indian country” who opposed Francis as she advocated not a militant
and separatist position but, rather, a unified worldview. To stress under-
standing and unity between Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal groups dur-
ing this era required much courage, and Voyageur rightly contends that
in so doing Francis represented a form of radicalism in her own right.

While some may have criticized, for example, her decisions to participate
in the 1967 Canadian Centennial celebrations or to sit on Department of
Indian Affairs advisory boards, Francis was not a “sellout.” Through such
participation, she may have appeared to condone the (post)colonial estab-
lishment, but she also succeeded in raising awareness and respect for
Aboriginal people and practices. She perceived such opportunities as posi-
tive ones providing space for Aboriginal representation and voice.
Through the powwow clubs she established, through the arts and crafts
she encouraged, through the prayer and ceremony she shared, Francis
illustrated the potential of the cultural and the spiritual as a source of
strength and pride. While arts and crafts may have proved an economic
boon to some, even more people were likely to have benefited from the
sense of empowerment that no doubt grew through confirmation in the
legitimacy of their heritage. Again, culture and spirituality were tools that
were not separate from, but rather integral to, the everyday survival of
Aboriginal Canada.

For all the differences we can draw between Francis and her Red Power
counterparts, it is essential also to acknowledge key links between these

two activist strands. Significant among these links is the historic trend of
urbanization that brought myriad groups of Aboriginal people into con-
tact with one another and fostered collective organization throughout
North American cities in the post-World War II period. Francis was not
alone in developing services for urban Aboriginal populations; Indian
clubs spread throughout North America during the 1960s. The American
Indian Movement, the Native rights organization that arguably best
embodies Red Power, in fact first emerged in Minneapolis in 1968 with
the goal of protecting the rights of urban Aboriginal people (Wilkins
210). Fellowship clubs such as the Friendship Centres that Francis helped
found served as contact points for urban Aboriginal residents, and they
may well have contributed indirectly to the development of those contin-
gents of Native youth who would go on to head the Red Power movement.
Similarly, the powwow clubs she established likely served as an indirect
mechanism for the spread of protest activity and strategy, passing “infor-
mation along to Indian families who traveled between cities and the reser-
vations” (Johnson, Champagne, and Nagel 306).

Perhaps the greatest similarity between Francis and the Red Power
movement was the stress laid upon commonality rather than difference
within the Aboriginal community. Red Power has justifiably been charac-
terized according to its supratribal or pan-Indigenous forms of organiza-
tion, by its promotion of collective ethnic identity as the basis for claims
of self-determination and autonomy.54 Pan-Indigenization is not, howev-
er, as some have argued, merely a political process, but also a cultural and
spiritual one.55 Developments such as residential schooling and urbaniza-
tion, historic trends that severed Aboriginal peoples from their distinct
Aboriginal backgrounds, fostered a sense of common identity as well as a
confluence of practices and traditions. Francis herself not only identified
with a form of pan-Indigenous spirituality, but she also contributed
directly to its formation. Within her prison reform work, for example, she
no doubt ministered to inmates from a vast diversity of Aboriginal back-
grounds, introducing practices such as smudges and sweats as spiritual
elements accessible to all. She was similarly instrumental in introducing

56            The Journal of Bahá’í Studies 14. 3/4. 2004

Prairie Aboriginal dance and arts and crafts techniques to the coastal
region.56 In her extensive travels and residence throughout Western Can-
ada, Francis participated personally in a process of pan-Indigenization both
cultural and spiritual.

Although Red Power is often conceptualized in terms of the political,
culture and spirituality also played a role in this movement, and it is per-
haps in part for this reason that the activism of individuals such as
Francis has been overshadowed. Visible Red Power tactics such as prop-
erty seizures and marches were coupled with the celebration of pan-
Indigenous tradition. Johnson, Champagne, and Nagel argue that with
the peaceful conclusion of the Longest Walk, a protest march from San
Francisco to Washington, D.C., said to mark the end of the Red Power
era, “Red Power protest had come full circle, from the festive Alcatraz
days, through a cycle of confrontations between Indian activists and the
federal government, to the traditional quest for spiritual unity. . . .”
(308).

Although militancy and violent confrontation no doubt garnered
more popular and media attention than did cultural celebration and
events like the Longest Walk, the period of Red Power activism has been
said to have contributed to an Aboriginal “cultural renaissance” that
manifested itself in the form of “tribal museum development, tribal lan-
guage instruction, cultural preservation and apprenticeship programs,
tribal history projects, and the preservation and reinstitution of cere-
monial and spiritual practices” (Johnson, Champagne, and Nagel 309).
The operative word here, however, is “contributed.” Red Power was pre-
ceded by Francis as well as, certainly, by others like her who precipitat-
ed such patterns of cultural and spiritual revival and pan-Indigenization.
The notoriety of the Red Power movement must not subsume and ren-
der invisible the contributions of Francis that not only predated but also
surpassed the dominant 1960s–1970s period of Red Power activity.
Despite health challenges including back problems and diabetes, as well
as a debilitating stroke in 1978 that confined her to a wheelchair, Francis
pursued her activist activities until the end of her days. It was, in fact,

on a Bahá’í teaching trip to Bella Coola in 1990 that Francis suffered the
final stroke that would claim her life in a New Westminster hospital on
17 October of that year.57

THE LEGACY

The aim here is not to discredit the Red Power movement but, rather, to
encourage a widened conception of activism as well as to ensure that the
actions of Dorothy Maquabeak Francis and others like her do not go
unacknowledged. Undoubtedly, Red Power activists, in forcing their
demands for self-determination upon the public attention and into the
political arena, played a decisive role in raising awareness about the his-
tory and plight of Aboriginal North America and in gaining rights long
denied Aboriginal people.58 Theirs, however, was not the sole form of
Aboriginal activism during this period. Indeed, Red Power activists drew
upon institutions such as Friendship Centres and processes such as pan-
Indigenization that had been initiated long before Red Power exploded
onto the activist scene in the late 1960s.

Through her own efforts, Dorothy Maquabeak Francis illustrates that
Aboriginal activism was not necessarily carried out in the service of sep-
aratist aims or to the exclusion of non-Aboriginal people. Rather, her
integrated activism, motivated firmly by her beliefs as a Bahá’í as well as
by factors such as time spent with the Pitts family in her youth, reflect-
ed a desire for unity in diversity. Through her successful promotion of
arts and crafts, as well as of institutions such as the powwow and sun
dance, Francis demonstrated that culture and spirituality could not be
deferred until the Aboriginal community had overcome its marginaliza-
tion. These elements were, rather, the key tools of the reparation process.
Indeed, through her prayer, through her faith in Bahá’u’lláh and her con-
tributions towards the fulfillment of his teachings, Francis encourages us
to recognize the potential of spiritual approaches to the pursuit of social
change.

From the women and families of the Kahkewistahaw Reserve; from
58             The Journal of Bahá’í Studies 14. 3/4. 2004

Friendship Centre visitors and powwow club participants; from those
encouraged to pursue arts and crafts as a personal and collective, as well
as an economic, endeavor; from those who gained a better appreciation of
the history and contemporary reality of Aboriginal Canada, who gained
pride in their heritage; to those benefiting from her prayers as well as
their own spiritual awakenings—many people found their lives profound-
ly altered by Francis. Francis’s own life story challenges static concep-
tions of Aboriginal identity and reveals a multiplicity of mediating factors
that helped shape her activism.

Although she has crossed over to the other side, Francis continues to
visit those close to her in dreams. Her spirit is said to continue to bless
significant events, and she remains both “an admonisher and a prodder”
(Jordan-Bastow).59 Even for those who never met her, Dorothy Maquabeak
Francis serves as a powerful inspiration, as a reminder of the potential
impact of culture, spirituality, and an integrated activist approach. Armed
with a commitment to “unity in diversity” and the “gift to spark your spir-
it,” Bear Sitting Woman worked tirelessly to achieve her activist aims, and
Canadian society as a whole—past, present, and future—is richer for it.

N OTES

An earlier version of this paper was presented at the 28th Annual Conference
of the Association for Bahá’í Studies, Calgary, Alberta, 5 September 2004. My
deepest thanks to the many people who shared so generously of their memories,
experiences, and documentary material, and helped me gain a better understand-
ing of Dorothy, her actions, and her influences.

> 1. These three events all transpired in the fall of 2002.

2. Included among these monuments are Maquabeak Park in Coquitlam,
British Columbia; the Dorothy Maquabeak Francis totem in Queen’s Park, New
Westminster; and a commemorative plaque hanging at the Coquitlam City Hall.
Ella Benndorf, one of Francis’s many Bahá’í friends, was instrumental in the cre-
ation of these memorials.

3. See, for example, Bernard; “Promoting a Culture”; Crompton; Hildebrandt,
telephone inter view 27 October 2002 (hereafter referred to as Hildebr andt
interview 1); Benndorf, interview. Prairie people, the Saulteaux are also referred
to as the Plains Ojibwa or “They Came by Water Route” Nation. See Day; Adams,
“Supplement.”

4. See Hildebrandt interview 1; Crompton. Hildebrandt, one of Francis’s eldest
daughters, explains that Ashton and Francis’s mother, Emma, were never offi-
cially married. It is for this reason that Emma and Dorothy did not at this point
lose their official Indian status under Indian Act legislation.

5. The problem of “undetected terrorism” against younger girls by older ones
at Birtle is highlighted by Ketha Adams, daughter of Birtle principal Rev. F. E.
Pitts, in “Supplement.” For further discussion of Francis’s residential school
experience, see Bernard; “Inter view with Dorothy Maquabeak Francis”;
Hildebrandt interview 1; Crompton.

6. See “Birtle.” I was unfortunately unable to access the administrative records
for the remaining period during which Francis attended Birtle. For a general dis-
cussion of the residential school system in Canada, see Miller. On Birtle specifi-
cally, see Miller 213–15, 237, 292, 329–30, 368. See also Milloy; Haig-Brown.

7. It appears that the Pitts family did not limit their encouragement of further
education to Francis alone. Both the records of Ketha Adams, who taught at
Birtle and Alberni, and the general administrative files of Rev. F. E. Pitts indicate
that the family petitioned on the behalf of selected Aboriginal students—those
performing best within the bounds of residential school academic, sport, and
manual training—to allow them to attend the local public high school. See
Adams, “Remembrances”; Adams “Story of One Class”; “West Coast.”

> 8. Elinor Bennett; Hildebrandt interview 1; McNeil telephone interview.

9. On the Francis children referring to Adams as “Grandma Pitts,” see
Hildebrandt interview 1. On Adams regarding Francis as a sister, see “Ketha
Adams.” A series of letters between Adams and Francis written during the
1960s and 1970s illustrates the strong connection between the two women. One
particular exchange in 1964 involved Adams writing to Francis for insight con-
cerning her work at the Winnipeg Friendship Centre. The report that Francis
supplied in return was published in a local Alberni paper and contributed

60             The Journal of Bahá’í Studies 14. 3/4. 2004

indirectly to the opening of the Alberni Friendship Centre in the mid-1960s. See
Ketha Adams (Pitts) fonds. See also Francis, “Report.”

10. The fact that Francis named two of her children, Ketha and Chesley, after
members of the Pitts family is similarly telling.

11. On Pitts’s philosophy and activity and reception by the local Aboriginal
community, see, for example, Adams, “Family History”; Clutesi, Untitled tribute.

12. The symbol of the bear was repeatedly stressed by those interviewed as a
figure of great significance to Prairie Aboriginal people. While it is unclear, as
Victoria Day has discussed, whether this name was granted in order to give
strength or whether elders foresaw Francis’s spiritual power and granted the
designation accordingly, the name “Maquabeak” nevertheless holds much weight.
See, for example, Day 2; Benndorf interview; Crompton; Jordan-Bastow; Heinel;

18. Francis’s daughter, Shirley Hildebrandt, confirms that the Francis family
attended church on the Kahkewistahaw Reserve as well as in Regina. There were
three churches on the reserve, and while Hildebrandt does not recall the denom-
ination of the third, the presence of both a Presbyterian and a United Church
suggests a degree of continuity with Francis’s time with the Pitts family
(Hildebrandt, telephone interview [hereafter referred to as Hildebrandt interview
2], 10 November 2002).

21. Statistics provided by Gerald Filson, Director of External Affairs for the
Bahá’í Community of Canada. It should be noted that there are potential incon-
sistencies within the numbers here given. Filson notes that Canadian Bahá’ís are
a geographically mobile population, and that such numbers do not account for

those Bahá’ís who did not record address changes. Neither do Aboriginal Bahá’í
statistics from this era account for “drop-off,” for those who did not become prac-
ticing Bahá’ís. In addition, Filson notes that when the records for the National
Centre were transferred to computer in the early 1980s, not all enrollments
between the years 1948–1986 were included. He nevertheless contends that these
numbers provide a sense of historic enrollment trends. For more on the prob-
lematic nature of Bahá’í statistics, see van den Hoonaard, “Socio-demographic
characteristics.”

22. Francis traveled to Haifa with Anna Prough. Prough’s daughter, Jean
Olafsson, characterizes this trip as “the highlight of Dorothy’s Bahá’í life.”

23. While the Bahá’í community succeeded in meeting its assigned target goals
for Aboriginal declaration, it struggled in providing for both continuity and
growth. In their eagerness to fulfill the words of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá as well as the goals
for Aboriginal enrollment, the Canadian Bahá’í community relaxed entry require-
ments “‘to allow for enrollment of those who simply accepted Bahá’u’lláh as the
Messenger of God for this age, and were prepared to obey His teachings.’” This
attitude of gradualism—“deliberately seeking points of agreement and only later
introducing issues and laws more difficult for the inquirer”—was one developed
in alternative Bahá’í fields of service such as Africa and one which better allowed
the community to enroll greater numbers during the flurries of teaching activity
that generally accompanied the end of a plan (Pemberton-Piggot 39). This relax-
ation of entry requirements, coupled with “problems of cultural differences, phys-
ical distance, apathy and exhaustion” all contributed to the difficulty the Bahá’í
community subsequently faced in consolidating Aboriginal member ship
(Pemberton-Piggot 44). Ambivalence and resistance were encountered in some
regions, but even where there was interest and demand for further instruction,
individual Bahá’ís proved hard-pressed to provide it. Lacking in sufficient human
and monetary resources, Bahá’í pioneers could not supply the knowledge and sup-
port necessary for many Aboriginal followers to learn to practically apply the
Bahá’í teachings to their everyday lives. Although “sporadic teaching campaigns
and yearly trips to reform Assemblies were able to keep up statistical numbers of
individuals, localities and Assemblies,” warnings issued upon the relaxation of
entry requirements had in effect come to fruition: “if follow-up ‘deepening’ work

62              The Journal of Bahá’í Studies 14. 3/4. 2004

was neglected through concentration on outward growth, the results would not
endure.” Among those Aboriginal Bahá’ís who maintained contact with the Faith,
Pemberton-Piggot asserts, there persisted—indeed, persists—a significant divi-
sion between members living on reserves and non-Aboriginal adherents within
the wider (urban) Canadian Bahá’í community (44, 45–46).

24. Note that it was Aboriginal Bahá’ís who were required to cross the cultur-
al barrier to the non-Aboriginal world and not vice versa.

25. See, for example, Benndorf interview; McNeil, telephone interview;
McNeil, personal interview.

26. Many of those interviewed stressed Francis’s skills as a public speaker. See,
for example, Benndorf interview; Fletcher Bennett.

27. Francis is described as a “spiritual powerhouse” by Lyn Crompton. It was
to Crompton that Francis once revealed that which she considered her gift: the
ability to “spark your spirit.” On Francis’s desire to reassert Aboriginal spiritual-
ity as a source of strength, pride, and identity, see, for example, “Interview with
Dorothy Maquabeak Francis.”

28. For examples of Francis’s discussion of her work without overt mention of
the Bahá’í Faith—however, with powerful allusions to it—see Secretary of State
96–97; van Eldik; Richardson Logie 39.

29. On the issue of discriminatory, constrictive, and patriarchal government
administration, see also Bernard; van Eldik. On migration from reserve to urban
environments, see Lindsay 17–30. While Lindsay notes methodological chal-
lenges faced in quantifying Aboriginal migration—among them, the distinction
between official and practical conceptions of Indian identity and status and the
issue of under-enumeration—he nonetheless provides statistics illustrating heavy
urban migration during 1951–1961. Regina’s Aboriginal population, for example,
is said to have increased from 116 in 1951 to 539 in 1961, while Winnipeg’s is
considered to have jumped from 210 to 1,082 in the same period.

30. See Day, Figure 2, for a copy of the official enfranchisement document.

While Francis was no longer technically under the yoke of the Department of
Indian Affairs, the document exhibited a highly patronizing tone, illustrating the
persistence of patriarchal attitudes. In response to a request from Francis for
assistance in securing housing, for example, the document states: “It is suggested

that you might enlist the aid of Mr. Warden to ensure that a suitable house is pur-
chased and that they get a good value for their money, and that said money is not
squandered.”

31. On the Port Alberni Centre, see Ketha Adams (Pitts) fonds. Interestingly,
it was a Bahá’í couple, Arthur and Lily Ann Irwin, active pioneers among
Alberta’s Aboriginal population, who initiated the Friendship Centre in Calgary.
Francis, who was living in town for a short period during the early 1960s, assisted
Lily Ann during the early planning stages. As Irwin explains, “Dorothy wasn’t
always there . . . because she moved from place to place but whenever she was she
was a very great worker” (Jensen, Interview with Lily Ann Irwin). Native
Friendship Centres have spread throughout the nation and remain powerful
institutions for urban Aboriginal populations. See, for example, the Web site of
the National Association of Friendship Centres of Canada, <http.//www.nafc-
aboriginal.com>.

32. See Evans; Francis, “Friendship Centre Report”; “Indians Find Centre”;
“Dorothy Francis Directs.”

33. Consider, for example, the positions Francis held with the Federation of
Saskatchewan Indians, the Saskatchewan Provincial Arts Board, the National
Advisory Board of the Department of Indian Affairs and Northern Development,
the National Indian Council, and the National Indian Arts and Crafts Advisory
Committee.

Francis was the subject of numerous newspaper articles following the announce-
ment of her appointment to the Order of Canada. See, for example, Bernard; van

> 37. See Ray 330; Johnson, Nagel, and Champagne 10; Ouellette 88.

38. The label “Red Power” is attributed to well-known Aboriginal activist and
scholar Vine Deloria, Jr. He first employed the term publicly during a 1966 speech
at the annual meeting of the National Congress of American Indians, of which he
was then executive director. See Wilkins 218.

64             The Journal of Bahá’í Studies 14. 3/4. 2004

39. See, for example, Johnson, Nagel, and Champagne; Johnson, Champagne,
and Nagel; Wilkins.

40. The decision to employ the media came, of course, at a cost. While the AIM
leadership often sought to highlight treaty and civil rights issues, the mainstream
media by and large contained its coverage within the bounds of the “stereotype”
and “militant” frames (see Wilkins 218).

> 41. See, for example, Whitehouse.

42. This reconceptualization of the political is widely discussed in women’s
activism literature. See, for example, Laslett, Brenner, and Arat; Cohen, Jones,
and Tronto.

> 43. See, for example, Naples 2.

44. See “Dorothy Francis Receives Order of Canada.” After stepping down as
chair of the National Indian Arts and Crafts Committee due to poor health, for
example, Francis spent the month of August 1975 traveling in Northern Ontario,
“helping the native people form their own committees to develop programs for
self help and cultural preservation” (“Dorothy M. Francis”).

45. The legal case was that of Robert Satiacum, a hereditary leader of the
Puyallup Nation, who was seeking to gain Canadian refugee status according to
his treaty rights.

46. For a convincing call to move beyond such entrenched academic approaches
to the study of religion and spirituality, see Chakrabarty.

> 47. See, for example, Jordan-Bastow; Fletcher Bennett.

48. While both oral and documentary sources confirm that Francis initiated an
Aboriginal spirituality program within correctional facilities that continues to
this day (see, for example, Benndorf interview; Hildebrandt interview 2;
“Dorothy M. Francis”), I was unable to confirm its official name and whether it
is run within provincial or federal institutions, or both. Francis herself volun-
teered at a variety of institutions throughout the Lower Mainland, including the
B.C. Penitentiary (now closed), the Oakalla Jail, and Willingdon Youth Detention
Centre.

> 49. See, for example, “Interview with Dorothy Francis”; Jordan-Bastow.

50. Francis’s many and diverse public engagements included speaking to
school children concerning Aboriginal childrearing practices; speaking at such

events as World Religion Day; and delivering prayers, both Aboriginal and
Bahá’í, at a wide variety of functions. See, for example, Fletcher Bennett;
Benndorf interview; McNeil telephone and personal interviews.

51. These programs, during which Francis spoke English as well as her native
Saulteaux language, included the summer broadcast “North Country Fair” on
CBC and the 1963 television series “Maquabeak” aired on CJAY Winnipeg. See
Macpherson; “Promoting a Culture”; “Indian Series Set for CJAY.”

52. Francis (with the assistance of Barbara Cass-Beggs) recorded a Saulteaux
lullaby and introduced it to the Saskatchewan Folklore Society, and (with Muriel
Clipsham) documented a series of legends concerning the Saulteaux figure
Nainabush. See Francis, “Saulteaux Lullaby”; Day, Figure 3. She also worked in
conjunction with Nan Shipley, who was considered “Canada’s foremost authority
on Indian folklore” during the 1960s (“Indian Series Set for CJAY”).

> 53. Jordan-Bastow; McNeil telephone and personal interviews.
> 54. See, for example, Johnson, Champagne, and Nagel 292, 305.
> 55. On pan-Indigenization as political process, see Wilkins 208.

56. Heinel; McNeil telephone and personal interviews. See Whitehouse for
Francis’s observations concerning the difference between Prairie and Coastal
Aboriginal people, remarks made during an early Bahá’í teaching trip up Canada’s
West Coast.

57. On Francis’s health challenges as well as her death, see, for example,
Jordan-Bastow; Benndorf, interview; McNeil, telephone and personal interviews.
Francis is buried in Squamish, British Columbia.

58. On the legacy of Red Power, see, for example, Johnson, Champagne, and
Nagel; Johnson, Nagel, and Champagne; Baird-Olson.
