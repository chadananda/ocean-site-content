Towards a complete and fully integrated model of

the human species by Gearóid Carey
Abstract
Extrapolating a full species model from correct but partial information
has led to the generation of poor models. For example, developing a model
that integrates all of the available scientific information without
integrating the metaphysical information that divine revelation provides
can never generate an adequate model. Similarly, failure to understand
the effect of the Neolithic revolution on the human species leads to such
mistaken modelling. Understanding the dynamics of the human species
before and after the Neolithic revolution is like understanding the
relationship between ice and water: one has come from the other and they
both share fundamental constituents. However, their performances and
properties are profoundly different. This paper briefly works towards
articulating a correct and complete species model.

Natural systems and the gene-trait link
In natural systems, the traits of the species are linked to its genes.
The genes linked to the fittest traits remain in the species gene pool
while the genes linked to the least fit traits do not. Traits include
physical, psychological and cultural traits.

Human beings in natural systems
Human beings evolved though the same process of natural
selection as animals. However, this process had a different effect
on humans than it did on animals because human beings have a
different relationship with God:

> Whatever is in the heavens and whatever is on the earth is a
> direct evidence of the revelation within it of the attributes
> and names of God, inasmuch as within every atom are
> enshrined the signs that bear eloquent testimony to the
> revelation of that Most Great Light ... To a supreme degree is
> this true of man ... For in him are potentially revealed all the
> attributes and names of God to a degree that no other created
> being hath excelled or surpassed ... 1

The Neolithic revolution: the breaking of the gene-trait link
The Neolithic revolution occurred 10,000 years ago. Human beings
discovered agriculture and began to domesticate animals. During
this revolution, we changed from being semi-nomadic hunter-
gatherers to being settled villagers farming the land. The effect of
this was that the strict gene-trait link that is required for the
process of natural selection to perform was broken. Physiological,
psychological and cultural traits were no longer being tested for
being the fittest, as they had been previously. Human beings could
perform pathologically and still survive. The species could be
steeped in its own pathos (diseases or abnormalities) and the
external regulating force of natural selection would no longer
eliminate it:

> In the days of old an instinct for warfare was developed in
> the struggle with wild animals; this is no longer necessary;
> nay, rather, co-operation and mutual understanding are seen
> to produce the greatest welfare of mankind. Enmity is now
> the result of prejudice only.2

Human beings outside natural systems
Since the Neolithic revolution, civilization has progressively
developed. Over this time our species has progressively come to
terms with living outside the parameters which natural selection
once applied to how we could and could not live. This journey has
been difficult and painful. We are now at this journey’s end.
Civilization is finally entering into maturity as we attain the
capacity to adequately, internally self-regulate:

> The time foreordained unto the peoples and kindreds of the
> earth is now come.3
> Soon will the present-day order be rolled up, and a new one
> spread out in its stead.4
> A new life is, in this age, stirring within all the peoples of the
> earth; and yet none hath discovered its cause, or perceived
> its motive.5

Spiritual development as a survival trait
Spirituality is a trait of the human species. It is observable as
psychological and cultural phenomena which are based on valuing
the development of virtues like kindness, generosity, truthfulness,
service, forbearance, forgiveness, etc. What role did this
spirituality play during our evolution?

It is quite probable that before the Neolithic revolution, poor
spiritual fitness was responded to with negative selection pressure
on the individual, tribe or group of tribes that was performing
relatively poorly. To explain this by exaggeration, imagine if one
tribe was riddled with vices like dishonesty, crime and immorality,
it would have had a much greater negative selection pressure than
a tribe resplendent with virtues like patience, trustworthiness,
generosity, moderation, forbearance and so on.

Species essence
Our evolution is similar to that of animals in that natural selection
was the governing process of both. Our evolution is different to
that of animals as we have a unique ingredient which animals do
not: the capacity to know of God and live in His image. This
unique ingredient, the defining characteristic of our species, is
essentially supernatural or metaphysical and so is independent of
biological speciation:

> This anatomical evolution or progression does not alter or
> affect the statement that the development of man was always
> human in type ... The human embryo when examined
> microscopically is at first a mere germ or worm. Gradually as
> it develops it shows certain divisions; rudiments of hands
> and feet appear ... Afterward it undergoes certain distinct
> changes until it reaches its actual human form and is born
> into this world. But at all times, even when the embryo
> resembled a worm, it was human in potentiality and
> character, not animal. The forms assumed by the human
> embryo in its successive changes do not prove that it is
> animal in its essential character ... Realising this we may
> acknowledge the fact that at one time man was an inmate of
> the sea, at another period an invertebrate, then a vertebrate

and finally a human being standing erect. Though we admit
these changes, we cannot say man is an animal ... 6

A scientific look at the human species and the Neolithic
revolution
Five million years ago, the biological species that was to evolve
into human beings were tree-dwelling creatures living in a jungle.
Two million years later, they foraged and scavenged for food
throughout the open grasslands of African savannahs. Two million
years later again, they were very successful hunter-gatherers living
all over the world. 10,000 years ago our ancestors began planting
crops and domesticating animals. This was the beginning of
agriculture, and with it came profound changes in our species.
Before we began farming, people lived together in semi-nomadic
tribes. With the arrival of agriculture we began living in
permanent villages. The day-to-day lives of the villagers were no
longer taken up with the continuous search for food to survive.
They had more time to develop other matters like art, crafts,
technology and language. These early farming communities
represented the very beginnings of civilization.

As civilization began to emerge, natural selection had less
and less of an effect on our species. Eventually, natural selection
was no longer determining how we could and could not develop
psychologically and culturally. Our escape from the rigours of
natural selection has had many consequences. Here are ten
examples.

Old Age
Advanced old age does not occur in natural systems. It does occur
in our species. So we must learn to tend to the unique needs of the
elderly, and learn how to benefit from the unique gifts and
experiential insights they have to offer all of us.

Diet
In natural systems, salty, fatty and sugary foods are scarce.
However, these foods are of great benefit to a creature struggling
to survive. Thus many animals are programmed to gorge on these
kinds of foods when they become available. This genetic
programming is also found in human beings. Eating salty, fatty or

sugary foods makes us feel good as chemicals are released in our
brains. This encourages us to consume more of these foods than
we need. While our species was governed by natural selection,
over-consumption of these foods when they became available
helped us to survive. These types of food were scarce and so their
consumption was naturally regulated in our diet. Now, we must
regulate the amount of salt, fat and sugar in our diets ourselves or
suffer consequences such as obesity and tooth decay, to which a
poor or unbalanced diet undoubtedly contribute.

Physical Fitness
Natural selection evolves creatures to be physically fit in their
environment. Now, the onus is on us to develop lifestyles and
environments which encourage fitness.

Sexuality
Human sexuality used to be an integral part of the workings of
natural selection in our species. As this is no longer the case, we
need to relate to and integrate our sexuality in a new way.

Physiological Disease
In natural systems, disease has a very important role to play. As a
device of natural selection, disease removes the weakest members
of the species. Physiological disease used to perform this
important function in our species. However, natural selection no
longer applies to our species in this way, so there is no need for
physiological diseases to occur in it. Thus we must endeavour to
live in a manner where the occurrence of disease is minimal.

These various new challenges which face us can overlap. For
example, the species’ new relationship to sexuality and
physiological disease together play a part in the way sexually
transmitted diseases occur.

Starvation
The phenomenon of starvation is a necessary part of natural
systems. It is a part of the natural world and has a place in it.
Starvation is the effective result of there being a limited food
supply. In order for a natural system to work, the presence of a
limited food supply is vital.

However, the starvation which has occurred in the human
species since the Neolithic revolution 10,000 years ago amounts to
sheer pathology.

Environment
Another example is the relationship of the human species to its
environment. When the process of natural selection governed the
human species, physiological, psychological and cultural fitness
were paramount. Efficiency and recycling were therefore essential
elements of human lifestyle. However, now we must learn to
regulate our relationship with our environment ourselves, or
suffer consequences like litter and pollution.

Genetic deterioration of the gene pool of the human species
Genes that are a contributing factor to the occurrence of an illness
or that actually cause illness are permitted to remain in our gene
pool as their carriers stay alive and propagate. Unless the illness
directly affects sexual ability, chances are the carrier will have as
many offspring as someone not carrying the offending gene.
Examples of illnesses in which genetic make-up can be a factor are
heart disease, cancer, schizophrenia and panic attacks. Dealing
with our deteriorating gene pool requires minimising non-genetic
factors which contribute to the occurrence of these illnesses such as
smoking, poor diet, dysfunction and pollution. It also requires
limiting the symptoms of gene-related illnesses by tending to them
as best we can.

Population
Natural selection used to regulate the population densities
occurring in the human species. Now the species must learn to do
this for itself or suffer consequences such as chronic traffic
congestion, to which population density is a contributing factor.

Self-destructiveness
Prior to civilization, natural selection tested all of the attributes of
our species for fitness and facilitated the human species to evolve
accordingly. Natural selection had been able to test our
physiological, psychological and cultural fitness. Without this
strong and strict guiding force, our species was free to develop in
new ways. Unfortunately, we have become self-destructive in

many ways, for example, in wars and in a multiplicity of mental
illnesses.

> The human species is in an extremely difficult period of
> transition. Its development is no longer ultimately governed
> and facilitated by natural selection. However, it has yet to
> learn how to adequately govern or facilitate itself. In the
words of Bahá’u’lláh:

Consider the pettiness of men’s minds. They ask for that
> which injureth them, and cast away the thing that profiteth
> them. They are, indeed, of those that are far astray. We find
> some men desiring liberty, and priding themselves therein.
Such men are in the depths of ignorance.

Liberty must, in the end, lead to sedition, whose flames
> none can quench. Thus warneth you He Who is the
> Reckoner, the All-Knowing. Know ye that the embodiment
> of liberty and its symbol is the animal. That which beseemeth
> man is submission unto such restraints as will protect him
> from his own ignorance, and guard him against the harm of
> the mischief-maker. Liberty causeth man to overstep the
> bounds of propriety, and to infringe on the dignity of his
> station. It debaseth him to the level of extreme depravity and
wickedness.

Regard men as a flock of sheep that need a shepherd for
their protection. This, verily, is the truth, the certain truth ... 7

Natural systems
Natural selection is a process whereby the traits that provide the
best survival advantage, i.e. fitness, are propagated in the species.
Thus, species evolve. To explain how this happens I will use the
example of a herd of zebras in an African savanna.

The herd roams the grasslands of the savanna in search of
fresh pasture for grazing. From time to time, a male and female
zebra will mate and have offspring. Each newborn foal has some
genetic mutations. These mutations give rise to new traits in the
species. With each generation of zebra, many thousands of new
mutations occur in the species. As the herd roams the grassland,
the zebras have to overcome many adversities in order to stay
alive. Predators, such as lions, are constantly watching the herd

looking for the zebra that they can take down most easily. Each
zebra must also be strong enough to overcome any physiological
disease it may catch. These diseases often occur only in zebras that
are already run-down. The zebras also have to contend with a
limited food supply.

In order to talk more easily about natural systems, I will
apply some terms to the various events that happen in them.
When a male and female zebra choose to mate with each other,
this is called sexual selection. The various adversities, such as
predators and disease, which test the zebras for fitness are
mechanisms of natural selection. Sexual selection is also a
mechanism of natural selection. It is through these mechanisms
that the traits of the species are linked to the genes of the species.

In order for natural selection to perform, this gene-trait link
is vital. In natural systems, the gene-trait link is present for
physiological, psychological and cultural traits. A physiological
trait of a zebra is its black and white stripes. A psychological trait
is its ability to be aware of the presence of a lion nearby. A cultural
trait is the bond between a foal and its mother. Another cultural
trait is the way the animals of the herd stay close together in order
to better protect themselves from predators.

Understanding the relationship of natural selection and
health is vital to understanding our species. Natural selection
evolves animals to be physically fit. In order for an animal to be
physically fit, it first must be physically healthy. Thus animals
evolved through natural selection are designed, in their genetically
proposed form, to be physically healthy. In the same way, natural
selection evolves animals to be psychologically healthy. Natural
selection also tests animals’ collective cultural performance, and
therefore also evolves cultural performance to be healthy. Thus we
can say that the human species has been evolved to be physically,
psychologically and cultural healthy.

What we have been evolved to do
While the development of our species was being facilitated by the
governing force and principles of natural selection, we
dynamically developed lifestyles and ways of living together
which were fit for the situation and surroundings in which we

found ourselves. We were so successful at this that we survived in
various habitats all over the planet.

It is our nature to develop our fitness individually,
collectively and as a species. It is also our nature to develop our
health and well-being as they are prerequisites for our fitness.

Life after natural selection
The occurrence of agriculture in our species changed human
beings remarkably. We were no longer semi-nomadic hunter-
gatherers. Instead, we were settled villagers farming the land. Our
new lifestyles prevented the mechanisms of natural selection from
doing their job. The strict gene-trait link was broken. Natural
selection was no longer able to test our traits for fitness as it had
before.

The invention of farming 10,000 years ago brought many
advantages. For example, people no longer had to worry about
where their next meal would come from. Our species no longer
had a limited food supply, as all species governed by natural
selection are required to have: we had an abundant food supply. A
sign of this is the exponential population growth which has
occurred in our species. The species population has grown from
approximately 3,000,000 people 10,000 years ago to over
6,000,000,000 today. Another benefit of farming was that people
lived together in larger numbers and had more time to devote to
developing things like language, technology and the arts.

Hygiene and warfare
Our new lifestyles brought many new threats to our species. The
village lifestyle which accompanied agriculture meant that many
new diseases flourished among the people of the time. These
diseases were no longer the workings of natural selection: they
were just something harmful happening to the species. Farming
meant that some people had to do tedious and back-breaking work
they had not been evolved to do. The crops and animals had to be
protected. Villagers had to fight to protect the possession of their
crops and animals. The hurt, physical damage and distrust this
fighting engendered was just more needless pain, occurring
because we had not adjusted to living beyond the bounds of
natural selection.

Feedback loops in our species
In this way, our species began performing self-destructively.
People responded to these new hostilities in a way that caused
even more harm. Thus our self-destructiveness began feeding on
itself: hostility and harm became the origin of hostility and harm.
This feedback loop of self-destructiveness has been a part of our
species for some 10,000 years. It generates wars, famines, murders,
suicides, mental illnesses, pollution, economic crises and lots more
and is profoundly complex.

There are different types of feedback loops. One is a
reinforcing feedback loop. This is when the more something
occurs, the more it tends to occur - for example, the retaliatory
paramilitary violence occurring between nationalists and loyalists
during the troubles in the Northern Ireland. Essentially, ‘violence
breeds violence.’

Another type of feedback loop is a balancing feedback loop.

This is when the more something occurs, the more things which
inhibit it will occur. An example of this is imprisonment. The more
crime there is, the more people will be put in jail and so less crime
will tend to occur.

The reinforcing feedback loop of self-destructiveness
occurring in our species has the potential to destroy all of us. It
does not fulfil this potential because the balancing feedback loop
occurs in response to it. The balancing feedback loop puts a limit
on how much damage the reinforcing feedback loop can do.

However, the balancing feedback loop does not remove the
reinforcing feedback loop or its cause. In fact, the balancing
feedback loop can itself cause harm. An example of this is
imprisonment. Imprisoning people justly does limit the amount of
crime occurring, but the act of imprisoning someone is or can be
harmful to that person. Of this ‘Abdu’l-Bahá observed in one of
His table talks:

... communities are day and night occupied in making penal
> laws, and in preparing and organizing instruments and
> means of punishment. They build prisons, make chains and
> fetters, arrange places of exile and banishment, and different
> kinds of hardships and tortures, and think by these means to

discipline criminals, whereas, in reality, they are causing
> destruction of morals and perversion of characters. The
> community, on the contrary, ought day and night to strive
> and endeavor with the utmost zeal and effort to accomplish
> the education of men, to cause them day by day to progress
> and to increase in science and knowledge, to acquire virtues,
> to gain good morals and to avoid vices, so that crimes may
> not occur. At the present time the contrary prevails; the
> community is always thinking of enforcing the penal laws,
> and of preparing means of punishment, instruments of death
> and chastisement, places for imprisonment and banishment;
> and they expect crimes to be committed. This has a
demoralizing effect.

But if the community would endeavor to educate the
> masses, day by day knowledge and sciences would increase,
> the understanding would be broadened, the sensibilities
> developed, customs would become good, and morals
> normal; in one word, in all these classes of perfections there
would be progress, and there would be fewer crimes ...

Therefore, the communities must think of preventing
crimes, rather than of rigorously punishing them.8

Ironically, the harm caused by the balancing feedback loop
can feed the reinforcing feedback loop.

Conclusion
Before the Neolithic revolution, there was an immense external
pressure (natural selection) on us to attain maturity. After the
Neolithic revolution, this pressure was no longer present and in its
absence we fail to mature.

In our time this pressure is returning: pollution, genetic
engineering, unguarded multinational corporations, the
refinement of devices of war and terrorism, the rapid spread of
physiological disease and so on. It is now internal. We must, as a
species, mature or else face extinction. In his letter, The Unfoldment
of Civilization (1936), Shoghi Effendi observed:

The recrudescence of religious intolerance, of racial
> animosity, and of patriotic arrogance; the increasing
> evidences of selfishness, of suspicion, of fear and of fraud;
> the spread of terrorism, of lawlessness, of drunkenness and
> of crime; the unquenchable thirst for, and the feverish
> pursuit after, earthly vanities, riches and pleasures; the
> weakening of family solidarity; the laxity in parental control;
> the lapse into luxurious indulgence; the irresponsible
> attitude towards marriage and the consequent rising tide of
> divorce; the degeneracy of art and music, the infection of
> literature, and the corruption of the press; the extension of
> the influence and activities of those ‘prophets of decadence’
> who advocate companionate marriage, who preach the
> philosophy of nudism, who call modesty an intellectual
> fiction, who refuse to regard the procreation of children as
> the sacred and primary purpose of marriage, who denounce
> religion as an opiate of the people, who would, if given free
> rein, lead back the human race to barbarism, chaos, and
> ultimate extinction – these appear as the outstanding
> characteristics of a decadent society, a society that must
> either be reborn or perish.9

Likewise the Universal House of Justice pointed out in The Promise
of World Peace (1985):

> The human race, as a distinct, organic unit, has passed
> through evolutionary stages analogous to the stages of
> infancy and childhood in the lives of its individual members,
> and is now in the culminating period of its turbulent
> adolescence approaching its long-awaited coming of age.10

The process of global integration, already a reality in the realms of
business, finance, and communications, is beginning to materialize
in the political arena.

> Historically, this process has been accelerated by sudden and
> catastrophic events. It was the devastation of World Wars I
> and II that gave birth to the League of Nations and the
United      Nations,      respectively.    Whether      future

accomplishments are also to be reached after similarly
> unimaginable horrors or embraced through an act of
> consultative will, is the choice before all who inhabit the
> earth. Failure to take decisive action would be
> unconscionably irresponsible.

To mature, the change must be both systemic and atomic.

‘Systemic’ means that changes will have to be made to all aspects
of human life: political, cultural, artistic, economic, etc.; ‘atomic’
means that the smallest unit of the global society will have to
change: ’ ... peace,’ ‘Abdu’l-Bahá wrote to one believer, ‘must first
be established among individuals, until it leadeth in the end to
peace among nations ... ’11

As delineated in the Bahá’í Writings, the maturity of the
human race is most likely to be represented by its diverse
members consciously achieving and sustaining a balance between
individual spiritual success (the atomic level) and collective or
social progress (the systemic level). Thus will be erected, in the
words of the Universal House of Justice, ‘a social system at once
progressive and peaceful, dynamic and harmonious, a system
giving free play to individual creativity and initiative but based on
co-operation and reciprocity.’12
