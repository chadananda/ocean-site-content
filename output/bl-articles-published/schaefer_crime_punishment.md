Introduction

On the crisis of law

The breakdown of the old order and the establishment of a new one,
prophesied by Baha-’u’lla-h more than one hundred years ago,1 is an apocalyp-
tic event humanity is facing now. The decay of moral values, which is taking
place with breathtaking speed, has encompassed everything that once seemed
solid. In the final analysis, this process is due to the »weakening of the pillars
of religion«2, to the total banishment of the metaphysical from society. Baha-
’u’lla-h warned of »the corrosion of ungodliness«, which »is eating into the vi-
tals of human society«3, of the darkening of »the lamps of religion«, the con-
sequence of which is »that the lights of fairness and justice, of tranquillity and
peace cease to shine«4: »Verily, I say, whatever hath lowered the lofty station
of religion hath increased the waywardness of the wicked, and the result can-
not be but anarchy.«5

> diately sets in, bringing in its wake all the evils which a wayward soul is capable of revealing.
> The perversion of human nature, the degradation of human conduct, the corruption and dis-
> solution of human institutions reveal themselves, under such circumstances, in their worst and
> most revolting aspects. Human character is debased, confidence is shaken, the nerves of disci-
> pline are relaxed, the voice of human conscience is stilled, the sense of decency and shame is
> obscured, conceptions of duty, of solidarity, of reciprocity and loyalty are distorted, and the very
feeling of peacefulness, of joy and of hope is gradually extinguished« (op. cit., p. 187).

Divine revelation was the ground on which civilisation grew. With its
roots cut off from this ground, there is no hold, no support, nothing on which
one can rely, nothing one can hold onto, no Sure Handle6.

This decay of the value system inevitably has implications for the law,
which is part of the moral order. Thus, we are facing a crisis of law, especially
of criminal law, which has lost its anchor in metaphysical presumptions and
premises, and is now based on mere utilitarianism. This crisis manifests itself
in legal positivism, which, based solely on positive, observable, scientific
facts, has cleansed law of any moral concepts: in a purely utilitarian jurispru-
dence; in widespread scepticism and recalcitrance towards the law7; in the
erosion of the legal consciousness of the people, and the corruption of the
sense of justice and injustice; and, last but not least, in the epidemic rise of
criminality in all strata of society and the powerlessness of the judiciary in
many countries.

Baha-’u’lla-h has announced, and described this crisis of law: »Equity is
rarely to be found, and justice hath ceased to exist«8, ... »the light of Justice is
dimmed, and the Sun of Equity veiled from sight. The robber occupieth the
seat of the protector and guard, and the position of the faithful is seized by the
traitor«;9 ... »Justice is, in this day, bewailing its plight, and Equity groaneth

beneath the joke of oppression«;10... »Whither are gone the equitable and the
fair-minded?«.11 Whenever Baha-’u’lla-h focuses on »justice«, the law is im-
plied, since justice and law are, as Aristotle pointed out,12 correlated.

Crime and punishment in legal philosophy13

From Antiquity, the purpose of punishment has been a subject for phi-
losophers, theologians and jurists, and different views have been developed.
There are two fundamental theories:14 According to the one the purpose of
punishment is retaliation, according to the, prevention. Both theories are
characterized by Latin formulae:

1) Punitur quia peccatum est: »Punishment is to be inflicted, because a crime

> has been committed.« Here, the view is directed to the past. Punishment is
> retaliation; compensation for the evil that has been committed, for viola-
> tion of the law.15

The classical definition of this principle, the lex talionis, is found in the
> Old Testament:       »Life for life, eye   for eye, tooth for tooth, hand for hand, foot
> for foot, burn for burn, wound for wound, strife for strife.«16 In Roman
> Law, too, punishment was retaliation,17 and up to the European Enlight-

tum est, sed ne peccetur29: »Nobody who is wise punishes because an of-

This idea, which can be traced back to Roman Law,30 was developed in

> Beccaria.31

Today, in Western states penal law has lost its metaphysical dimension;
it has become utilitarian. Retaliation and expiation as purposes of punish-

committed«.

Some general reflections.

Let us now consider the penal implications of Baha-’u’lla-h’s revelation, and
the prospects thereof for a future criminal law. In attempting to pursue such a
project, the following must be taken into account:

1) While it is not my place to try to cram the Law of God into the Procrustean

> bed of historical theories of penal law, the various currents of thought in
> the field of legal philosophy do offer an excellent framework for the sche-
> matic presentation of the law-related contents of the revealed texts, which
> are not set down in any systematic order.

2) We are setting foot on virgin territory. An authorized and annotated Eng-
lish edition of the Kita-b-i-Aqdas has only been available since 1993, so

> that the precise wording of the legal stipulations has been made known
> only recently in the West. As far as I know, no research into these stipula-
> tions has so far been conducted by scholars in the field of Law. The con-

clusions drawn here are, therefore, certainly not to be regarded as final.

> This is merely an initial attempt to provide food for thought and to pro-
> mote discussion in academic circles.

3) The penal provisions of the Kita-b-i-Aqdas must be seen in the context of
the sort of future society envisaged by Baha-’u’lla-h. Any discussion of

> these penalties should be prefaced with the fact that the laws in this book
> have been »formulated in anticipation of a state of society«37 which will
> emerge in the future and in which the various steps in educating the popu-
> lace against crime, encouraged at many and various points in Baha- ’-i texts,
> will be operating. It is therefore envisaged that »humanity may have
> reached a much higher point of evolution than at present, and the mere
> threat [of these punishments] may be sufficient in most cases to protect the
> community and protect the law from being broken«38. It may therefore be
> that the application of these penalties will be a comparatively rare event, a
> last resort.

4) The provisions of the Kita-b-i-Aqdas related to criminal acts are to be found
in verse 19, where murder, adultery (zina-’),39 backbiting and calumny are

> generally prohibited; verse 49, where a fine is prescribed for the adulterer:

Perspectives of a future criminal law

The Book of God is » guidance46 for the God-fearing«47, the »Straight Path«48
to salvation — for the individual as well as for society. For the individual soul
it is redemption from the bondage of »this mortal world of dust«,49 »from the
fetters of this world«,50 from guilt and sin. However, the Revelation has also a
political dimension: society, the state and the law are also in need of redemp-
tion and thus the recipient of divine salvation. For this reason, like the Torah
and the Qur’a-n, Baha-’u’lla-h’s Book of Laws, the Kita-b-i-Aqdas, contains
some penal provisions for a future society, basic norms, indicating the rank
which has been assigned in the hierarchy of values to factors such as life,
marriage, property etc. These norms represent only certain fixed points, the
kernel of a future criminal law, the details of which have been left open for
supplementary legislation by the Universal House of Justice at a later date.
Moreover, throughout the Baha-’i- scripture are to be found starting points for
theological reflection on this subject, as well as occasional explicit statements
regarding the deeper causes of criminality and the purpose of punishment,
consideration of which is essential in order to understand the philosophical
ideas underlying the penal provisions. This is all the more necessary in view
of the fact that these penal laws, [with their absolute penalties (capital pun-
ishment or life imprisonment in case of intentional killing of a human being

and of arson51), and the stigmatization of the thief »on the third offence«52]
are in sharp contrast to modern Western penal concepts and the theories of
progressive criminologists.

The following sections deal with fundamental questions of penal law and
punishment and with the theological aspects of criminality.

Crime as a factor in society.

In contrast to the expectations occasionally raised in Judaism and Christianity
whereby the »Kingdom of God on earth« will be inhabited only by angelic be-
ings,53 Baha-’u’lla-h anticipates that even in the time of the »Most Great
Peace«, the messianic era, evil will not vanish completely from the world; it
will, however, lose its predominance and become something exceptional, so
that the earth will be »the ... metropolis of Satan«54. There will always be peo-
ple who will commit crimes; indeed, the very existence of penal law in the
Kita-b-i-Aqdas, whose norms are intended for a future society, is evidence for
this.

Individual’s moral responsibility

A presupposition of all criminal law is guilt, and guilt in turn presupposes the
responsibility of the individual for his actions. People can be held to be guilty
only if they had the freedom to act differently. Some schools of thought in the
humanities deny the existence of free will, regarding human beings as deter-

51   Kita-b-i-Aqdas 62.
52   Kita-b-i-Aqdas 45.
53   cf. Isa. 11:9.
54   Tablets 11:46 (p. 177).

mined by external compulsions and own basic drives, and therefore unable to
act on the basis of free will. The practical consequence of such deterministic
view is the denial of personal guilt. Individuals cannot be made accountable
for their actions and are thus morally exonerated; the blame for the individ-
ual’s actions being shifted to structures such as the family, school or society.55
As a result, the representatives of the deterministic schools of psychology dis-
pute the right of the state to inflict punishment.

Baha-’u’lla-h, in contrast, portrays human beings as responsible creatures.

Amongst all created beings »man alone has freedom«;56 »the power both to do
good and to do evil«,57 the »choice between justice and injustice«.58 Thus, free
will is a basic anthropological condition, a constituent element of the conditio
humana. Therefore, one is responsible to God for one’s actions, for »every
idle word«,59 indeed even for one’s thoughts.60 One’s basic responsibility may
be undermined by adverse mental or physical conditions, but malformations
of character which result in crime are no disease; for these each individual is
irrevocably responsible.

The state’s responsibility

The Baha-’i- teachings impart a theocratical concept of the state. Baha-’u’lla-h
legitimates temporal power and the penal authority of the state: »The sover-
eigns on earth have been and are manifestations of the power, the grandeur
and the majesty of God«.61 Referring to statements in other scriptures,62 Baha-
’u’lla-h confirms that all power is »of God«,63 and that the kings and rulers
should be »the emblems of justice«64 amongst humankind. God has committed
into their hands »the reigns of the government of the people«, that they may
»rule   with justice over them, safeguard the rights of the downtrodden, and
punish the wrong-doers«,65 a duty for which they are responsible before
God.66

Justitia fundamentum regnorum67

Justice (‘adl) – according to Jewish tradition, an attribute of the Messiah,68
according to Islamic tradition, of the Mahdi-69 – is the cardinal value of tempor-
al power. Justice, law and order are the foundations on which Baha-’u’lla-h’s
world order is established. The essence of justice is manifested in the »two
pillars« upon which »the canopy of world order is upraised«: »reward and pun-

ishment«70 – this is a fundamental principle on which order in the world de-
pends, both at the metaphysical level and at the level of world affairs. Justice
(iustitia distributiva) requires that punishment be inflicted for a crime com-
mitted. Conversely, the justification for the infliction of punishment is the fact
that a crime has been committed. Thus, the primary purpose of punishment is
retaliation for the act of injustice committed, the expiation of the perpetrator
for his misdeed.71 The talionic character72 of the criminal law in the Kita-b-i-
Aqdas is evident in the fact that the law prescribes the death penalty for mur-
der and arson (with the alternative of life-imprisonment),73 and that the death
penalty inflicted on the arsonist shall be by burning. Punishment has thus re-
gained an absolute rank rather than a mere relative one, oriented only towards
utilitarian considerations.

In accordance with the theories of Kant and Hegel, this anchoring of
criminal law in the metaphysical principle of justice does not exclude utilitar-
ian purposes for punishment.74 Punishment serves also »for the security and
protection of men«,75 the preservation of society which »has the right of de-
fence and of self-protection«,76 for some people are »more savage... more vile,
more cruel, more malevolent than the lower animals themselves«, they »plan
to work evil, to hurt and to destroy«,77 some are »like blood-thirsty wolves: If

they see no punishment forthcoming, they will kill men merely for pleasure
and diversion«.78 Moreover, punishment has also the purpose of crime preven-
tion by general deterrence: it causes »the wicked to restrain their natures«.79
Society must punish the perpetrator »so as to warn and restrain others from
committing like crimes«.80 Even the concept of crime prevention by rehabili-
tation and resocialization of the offender as a purpose of punishment can be
found in the Baha-’-i scripture: the punishment of the thief may at first include
exile,81 thus removing the offender from his milieu, giving him the chance of
a new beginning, whereas his stigmatization on the third offence explicitly
serves the protection of the public from a recidivous thief.«82

On the relationship between justice and love

As ‘Abdu’l-Baha- emphasised, »the object of punishment is not vengeance«,83
nor is it, as often imputed, the expression of subliminal feelings of hatred and
aggression; rather it is the essence and the demand of justice. Reference to the
Sermon on the Mount,84 or, with regard to the death penalty to the fifth com-
mandment,85 as reasons not to administer justice appears are erroneous, since

the addressee of these commandments is the individual, the homo privatus,
not the state.86 The commandment of love (with the inherent attitudes of
mercy, compassion and forgiveness) relates to the realm of interpersonal rela-
tionship, whereas the realm of order is ruled by the principle of justice.87 The
commandments of the Sermon on the Mount are not directives for political
action,88 but are a radicalized ethic for observance by the individual.89 Just as
justice without love turns into cruelty,90 love which is devoid of justice is »the
mother of disintegration«,91 and becomes mere sentimentality,92 leading even-
tually to the breakdown of order. The growing orientation of Western socie-
ties to the secular value of humaneness (with the inherent attitudes of forgive-
ness and compassion), is bound to result in the disruption of the social order.
In response to those who refer in this context to God’s mercy, ‘Abdu’l-Baha-
objected that »also justice is one of the attributes of the Lord«.93

Baha-’u’lla-h appears to be warning against such tendencies when he states
in the Kita-b-i-Aqdas: »Take ye hold of the precepts of God with all your
strength and power, and abandon the ways of the ignorant«94, and »Beware
lest, through compassion ye neglect to carry out the statutes of the religion of

God; do that which has been bidden you by Him Who is compassionate and
merciful«95 — a warning against human arrogance in presuming to be more
merciful than God, the All-Merciful.

The metaphysical dimension

Thus, Baha-’u’lla-h advocates that society turns back from a criminal law with
purely utilitarian motives to one which is anchored in the metaphysical. The
metaphysical dimension of this law is evident, inter alia, in the fact that a just
punishment (i. e. one inflicted in accordance with the divine law) has a meta-
physical, expiatory significance for the offender, who accepts it, since its ef-
fect extends into the hereafter: »God in his justice will impose no second pen-
alty upon him, for divine justice would not allow that«96 — a metaphysical
principle of ne bis in idem, so to speak, in accordance with the Qur’a-nic as-
surance that: »In retaliation there is life for you«.97

Hence, the offender can perceive a meaning in his punishment, which is
not the case when punishment is inflicted with a purely utilitarian purpose.
Even a death sentence carried out in error (a strong argument put forward by
opponents of capital punishment) — the worst injustice any individual on
earth can suffer at the hands of those charged with the upholding of justice —
loses its absolute irreparability in the face of this metaphysical dimension:
God, the allwise Lawgiver, who is aware of the relativity of human judge-
ments, who therefore knows that such a risk exists, and yet, nevertheless, has

97   2:179.

commanded this punishment, will compensate the person who was falsely
condemned »a thousandfold in the next world, for this human injustice«98 —
an idea that should not be misunderstood and interpreted cynically.

Seen from this perspective, the doctrine that the only acceptable legitima-
tion for punishment consists in the resozialization of the offender99 is not up-
held by the Baha-’i- teachings. The Baha-’i- position derives from a basic politi-
cal concept in the Baha-’i- Faith whereby the common weal and the security of
the public has to be balanced against the rights of the individual.100 Society
should neither suppress the individual nor exalt him »to the point of making
him an antisocial creature, a malice to society«.101

The Fear of God

Baha-’u’lla-h refers to the inevitability of penal sanctions for »the security and
protection of man«,102 without which »the world would be disordered, and the
foundations of human life would crumble«.103 However, he regards them only
as an outward instrument: they are powerless to remove the fundamental
causes of criminality: »That which guideth and restrained man both outwardly
and inwardly hath been and is still the fear of God. It is man’s true protector
and his spiritual guardian«.104 The fear of God results from man’s spiritual re-
sponsibility before God, the consciousness that all one’s deeds, even the se-

98    Shoghi Effendi, in: Kita-b-i-Aqdas, Note 86.
99    with the practical consequence that even dangerous criminals serving life-sentences should have

the chance of eventual release.

crets of the heart are »openly manifest in the holy Presence«105 and that he
will eventually be »called to give account«106 for them before God. This con-
sciousness, together with conscience, is an control mechanism constituting for
the faithful a strong motivation to refrain from evil deeds, even when there is
little likelihood of their discovery and subsequent punishment.107

Religion and the political world

This demonstrates the political dimension of religion, its power as a factor for
the establishment and stabilisation of order in the world. For religion is »the
chief instrument for the establishment of order in the world, and of tranquil-
lity amongst its peoples«,108 »a radiant light and an impregnable stronghold
for the protection and welfare of the peoples in the world«.109 Since the value
system, the pivot of society, is anchored in religion, the decay of religion in-
evitably brings in its wake the dissolution of moral order, increasing »way-
wardness of the ungodly«,110 sedition, the subversion of »the order of
things«,111 the disruption of order, »chaos and confusion«,112 and, eventually
the end of civilisation. If the fear of God is the true motivation which impels
us »to hold fast to that which is good, and to shun evil«,113 then the corollary
of that is that today when »the vitality of men’s belief in God is dying out in

every country«,114 criminality is spreading like an epidemic in all strata of so-
ciety. Thus it is becoming increasingly evident that the global problem which
threatens to devour society cannot be overcome without recourse to religious
commitment and to humanity’s transcendental responsibility.

Moral education

Criminal law and penal provisions are thus not by themselves the remedy.
The solution lies in the moral healing of a society faced with loss of its de-
fences115 against the onslaught of crime. The establishment of moral health,
which alone can ensure that crime becomes the exception, cannot, however,
be achieved by state decree. Baha-’i-s believe that this transformation will re-
sult, as in mankind’s past upheavals, from a new faith, from the new Word of
God revealed by Baha-’u’lla-h, which, in the fullness of time, will bring about a
»new    race of men«, for this Word is »endowed with such a potency as can in-
still new life unto every human frame«:116 »The Word of God, alone, can
claim the distinction of being endowed with the capacity required for so great
and far-reaching a change«.117 Only the spiritual rebirth of humanity will
bring about its liberation from the clutches of crime and overcome the chaotic
conditions prevailing today.

The moral education of humanity through which all are spurred on »to ac-
quire virtues, to gain good morals and avoid vices, so that crimes may not oc-

cur«118 is a long-term process. A hardened criminal can only change his ways
if he himself wants to change, and it is one of the tasks of religion to bring
about such an individual spiritual transformation. To stand the greatest chance
of success, however, the process of character training must begin in early
childhood, »for when the bough is green and tender it will grow in whatever
way ye train it«.119 Therefore: »Schools must first train the children in the
principles of religion so that Promise and the Threat recorded in the Book of
God may prevent them from the things forbidden and adorn them with the
mantle of the commandments«; although it is accompanied by a warning only
to do this in such a measure that »it may not injure the children by resulting in
ignorant fanaticism and bigotry«.120 Character formation is not possible with-
out moral discipline and moral responsibility towards an omnipresent author-
ity, something which is absent from a society which has abandoned all things
metaphysical.

When ‘Abdu’l-Baha- gives preference to education, enlightening and spiri-
tualization over »punitive and retaliatory laws«121 so that »without any fear of
punishment or vengeance to come, they will shun criminal acts«,122 that they
will become »enamoured with human perfections«123 and will »look upon the
very commission of a crime as a great disgrace in itself and in itself the harsh-
est punishment«,124 it is not perhaps the specific offender and the educative

actions undertaken for that individual’s rehabilitation to which he primarily
refers, rather it is the long-term educative process leading to the moral recon-
struction of society, which is complementary and which should not be mis-
taken as an alternative to punishment. Since the penal laws of the Kita-b-i-
Aqdas relate to a future state of society, it must be borne in mind that then
when that future society arrives, the long process of moral education will al-
ready have been under way.
