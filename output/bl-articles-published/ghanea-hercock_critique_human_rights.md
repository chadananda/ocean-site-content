        BAHÁ’Í-INSPIRED PERSPECTIVES ON HUMAN RIGHTS

A Bahá’í Critique of Human Rights

A Bahá’í Critique of Human Rights:
State Sovereignty as Smokescreen or Necessary

Partner in Securing Human Rights?

BY NAZILA GHANEA-HERCOCK

This paper will argue that the main systemic Bahá’í critique of the current
international human rights system concerns the extent of the centrality of state
sovereignty. The continued primacy of the sovereign state within human rights
can be seen at many levels and in a variety of instances. This includes the role
of states in establishing human rights principles, in maintaining oversight over
the compliance of other states with human rights standards, and in the protec-
tion of human rights in the domestic sphere. It is the latter of these three roles
which may be considered the most problematic from a Bahá’í perspective.

Since the focus of this paper is on the protection of human rights in the light
of infringements within the domestic sphere, it will be the international pro-
tection of human rights by the United Nations in the context of such domestic
abuse which will constitute the main exploration of this paper. The brevity of
this piece will not allow provision of the details of the Bahá’í concept of world
order. Instead the focus will be on the systemic challenges that can be deduced
from the examination of the main difficulties facing the current international
human rights regime. Definitions of sovereignty will not be entered into ei-
ther, and statements about ‘states’ and ‘state sovereignty’ will be highly
generalised due to the shortage of space.

State Sovereignty: Supporting or Eroding Rights?

Highlighting contradictions between traditional concepts of state sovereignty
and human rights is not a new claim, nor uniquely a Bahá’í claim. Many have

A Bahá’í Critique of Human Rights

questioned the statist basis of international law, and pointed out its problematic
position in relation to human rights—which are to secure the respect for, and
the realisation and fulfilment of internationally agreed human rights standards.

In the present human rights regime the sovereign state plays a dual role. It
is both the bastion of rights as well as the abuser of rights. It is the generator of
human rights standards as well as the main source of the erosion of these stan-
dards. It is the watchdog of rights as well as the smokescreen behind which
rights are infringed. It empowers these standards as well as deflating them.
Both strong states, such as the US, as well as weak or collapsed states, such as
Somalia—prove problematic in relation to rights.1 As Eide asserts regarding
the role of the state, “for some it is a dreaded expropriator and violator, for
others a protector and provider.”2

State sovereignty provides the structure within which human rights stan-
dards are currently generated, monitored and accounted for. Ultimate legal
responsibility for the protection of rights rests with sovereign states. Ulti-
mately the buck stops here. Sovereignty provides the necessary hierarchy. The
myth of sovereignty, which considers the state as the sole holder of legitimate
use of force within the domestic sphere, supports this necessary hierarchy.
According to the Positivist position,3 it is right that states alone should decide
on international human rights standards and establish them in human rights law.
It is their prerogative to decide on whether or not they agree with a particular
human rights text, to decide whether or not they will vote for it, to decide
whether they need to protect themselves from future criticism by attaching
reservations or by persistently objecting to it, and to carry the final responsi-
bility for ensuring their respect for it. International law, including human rights
law, is still largely perceived as implying horizontal enforcement, as largely
remaining a law between states. Since there is no higher legal authority above
the state, this conceptual model remains the best overall description of the
current scenario. The advantage of this model is that responsibility, at least in
states reflecting some level of democracy, is assigned on the basis of legiti-
macy stemming from being elected to positions of power. However, this model
also puts forward challenges for the project of securing rights.

Three Levels of Difficulty

The difficulties can be divided into three levels. On the first level, there
has been the difficulty of the present sovereign state structure in relation to
particular rights. On the second, is the question of the efficacy of the political
context in which human rights standards come into being. Finally, there is the

A Bahá’í Critique of Human Rights

question of the barriers surrounding what can be done in the light of the state
which abuses people within its own territory.

Feminist critiques, in particular, have emphasised how the rigidity of the
sovereign state system has sharpened the delegation of some human rights abuses
as ‘private’ and others as ‘public’. This has largely made human rights blind to
much of the atrocities going on against women. Women’s rights may have been
the most widespread of the rights that have been neglected. However, the
difficulties of dealing with migration, self-determination, trafficking, minority
rights and the rights of indigenous peoples are a few of the range of issues
which also bring the issue of state sovereignty to the fore. Economic, Social and
Cultural rights as a whole have also proven problematic, especially in relation
to the difficulty of dealing with state responsibility when positive costs may be
implicated.4 The sovereign state system has proven most problematic in rela-
tion to the securing of rights which require such positive enablement and sup-
port, not just negative protection from abuse by the state. The recognition of
any level of collective or group rights also has continued to prove deeply
controversial, and many states feel too threatened to recognise particular groups
within their territory. Many states deny the existence of any ‘minorities’ within
their territory, and continue the nationalist myth of the uniformity of their citi-
zenship. This has led to major denials of rights across the world, to the assign-
ment of significant populations within states as ‘unrecognised’ juridical
non-persons.

On the second level, is the question of the efficacy of the political milieu
and process in which human rights standards come into being. As has been sug-
gested above, some categories of rights and of rights recipients have been
sidelined in this process. Some rights are left behind as the political will
cannot be mustered to bring them to fruition as a legally binding Covenant, just
one example being that of the elimination of religious discrimination. 5 As well
as the prerogative of states in relation to the shaping and adoption of human
rights treaties, states also decide which human rights issues should be raised in
their interventions in the UN Commission on Human Rights,6 which should be
put forward for consideration as situations revealing a consistent pattern of
gross and reliably-attested violations of human rights and fundamental free-
doms under the public 1235 or confidential 1503 procedure, and which of the
human rights resolutions to vote for at the Commission or the General Assem-
bly. Voting patterns on human rights resolutions are just as carefully calculated
and choreographed as those on other multilateral issues such as trade or arms
control. It is not surprising, therefore, to note that accusations of partisanship,
politicisation, double standards and selectivity are rife.

A Bahá’í Critique of Human Rights

Finally, there is the question of the barriers surrounding what can be done
in the light of the state which abuses people within its own territory. It is here
that the limitations of the present sovereign state system are most acute. The
tension between the state on the one hand, and the role of the international
community on the other, was enshrined within the UN Charter itself. The oft-
quoted Article 2(7) of the UN Charter states:

> “Nothing contained in this present Charter shall authorize the United Nations to intervene
> in matters which are essentially within the domestic jurisdiction of any state.”

In cases of the abuse of human rights by the state of its population, there-
fore, what can the United Nations do? Clearly, any form of direct intervention
in the protection of human rights is severely limited by the above clause, and
this taboo has been established further in state practice since the Charter. Mecha-
nisms that have evolved, however, include: the possibility of inter-state com-
plaints regarding human rights abuse in another sovereign state,7 the possibility
of raising the issue as a situation of consistent and gross abuse of human rights
in the confidential 1503 or public 1235 procedure, the possibility of requesting
relevant UN Special Rapporteurs to attempt to visit the country and report on
their findings, raising the issue in relevant treaty bodies and recommending
means by which the situation can be resolved, bilateral pressure, the imposi-
tion of sanctions and statements by UN bodies. These mechanisms largely de-
pend on positive persuasion, gradual socialisation8 and finger-pointing in order
to gradually change the human rights abuses of a recalcitrant state. The sanction
of exclusion from the UN has not really been explored by the United Nations,
largely due to the dramatically negative consequences of this witnessed during
the League of Nations era. The overall assessment has been that keeping states
within the fold of the UN is preferable to exclusion, and that this allows the
remaining possibility of gradual socialisation toward acceptance of interna-
tional norms. Despite these very weak means of influence, some states remain
adamant that even these mechanisms of very indirect ‘intervention’ regarding
human rights abuses in their national contexts, are unacceptable, intrusive, and
infringe their sovereignty. Attempts to dilute or eliminate the remaining mecha-
nisms of indirect ‘intervention’ in the human rights situation at the domestic
level is often couched in very inoffensive, even positive-sounding, language.
Such attempts have made appeal to concepts such as ‘cultural diversity’ (read:
cultural relativity) and ‘dialogue among civilisations’ (read: absolute national
sovereignty) to buttress their positions. This more recent spectrum of virulent
‘defences’ for sovereignty in the face of human rights abuse are described by
Bayefsky to often come in under the heading of ‘cultural sovereignty:

> It is the claim that cultural particularities modify the commitment to the universality of
> human rights norms. International efforts to protect human rights are said to be limited by
> the state’s sovereign or superior authority to define the cultural needs of its citizens and the
> cultural parameters of their lives. There is no singular understanding of human rights; the
> definitions are culturally dependent.9

Discussions on this issue were heated throughout the UN world confer-
ences of the 1990s, and into the present century. They included tensions on this
issue at the 1993 Vienna World Conference on Human Rights, the 1994 Cairo
Population and Development Conference, at the 1995 Copenhagen Social Sum-
mit, the 1995 Beijing Women’s Conference, as well as the follow-up confer-
ences held with regard to these world conferences.

It can therefore be seen that whereas the sovereign state system is regarded
as being indispensable to the present operation of human rights, it is also con-
sidered a prime barrier to the wider success of the human rights project. Atten-
tion will now shift to the Bahá’í reading of the place of the state in the context
of securing rights.

Bahá’í Perspectives on Sovereignty and Human Rights

The main assessment of Bahá’í perspectives on these issues will be de-
duced from statements asserted by the Bahá’í International Community—the
Non-Governmental Organisation representation of Bahá’ís at the international
level and accredited at the United Nations. However, we will start with two
statements from Bahá’u’lláh, the first from the Tablet addressed to Queen
Victoria:

> We have also heard that thou hast entrusted the reins of counsel into the hands of the
> representatives of the people. Thou, indeed, hast done well, for thereby the foundations
> of the edifice of thine affairs will be strengthened, and the hearts of all that are beneath thy
> shadow, whether high or low, will be tranquillized. It behoveth them, however, to be
> trustworthy among His servants, and to regard themselves as the representatives of all that
> dwell on earth.10

In referring to the internal structure of the state, and the importance of rep-
resentation, Bahá’u’lláh here addresses ‘internal sovereignty’ and the notion of
accountability of government and peoples access to decision making. In a sec-
ond statement, this time addressing the collectivity of the kings and rulers
addressed by Bahá’u’lláh, He states:

> Be united, O Kings of the earth, for thereby will the tempest of discord be stilled amongst
> you, and your people find rest, if ye be of them that comprehend. Should any one among
> you take up arms against another, rise ye all against him, for this is naught but manifest
> justice.11

The reference here is to ‘external sovereignty’ and collective security. The
statement addresses the necessary limits on external sovereignty in the ex-
treme case of the use of arms. The statement relates to the use of force by one
state against another, but may be considered to more generally implicate the
necessity of oversight over, and constraints upon, the sovereign state. If this is
the case, the wider goal of constraining the illegal use of force and abuse of
power by the state, also relates to the question of human rights abuses by a state
of its population. This implies the need for states themselves to operate within
acceptable channels that respect human rights, and if not that direct intervention
agreed by law be available as a means of attempting to remedy the situation. 12
This wider reading is supported by the proposals put forward by the Bahá’í
International Community. These two statements by Bahá’u’lláh therefore touch
on both internal and external sovereignty, and suggest that the Bahá’í view of
world order poses a challenge both to internal as well as external sovereignty.

Shoghi Effendi comments very starkly on the future of the nation-building
process when he states:

> Unification of the whole of mankind is the hall-mark of the stage which human society is
> now approaching.… World unity is the goal towards which a harassed humanity is striving.
> Nation-building has come to an end. The anarchy inherent in state sovereignty is moving
> towards a climax. A world, growing to maturity, must abandon this fetish, recognize the
> oneness and wholeness of human relationships, and establish once for all the machinery
> that can best incarnate this fundamental principle of its life.13

Repeated statements by the Bahá’í International Community echo the rel-
evance of this claim to the goal of securing human rights. In such statements, the
Bahá’í International Community repeatedly emphasises that the concept of hu-
man rights should be anchored in the principle of the oneness of humanity. It is
argued that this grounding in the ‘oneness of humanity’ goes beyond a negative
perspective of human rights and requires a positive respect for each person to
be enabled to realise their potential. The Bahá’í International Community takes
this idea of the oneness of humanity 14 as bringing forward new definitions of
human rights, going so far as to claim that this leads to the conclusion that the

overriding purpose of international order is to establish and preserve the
rights of the individual.

The Bahá’í International Community is critical of the “undue weight” 15 given
to state sovereignty, one that results in “a curious mix of anarchy and conserva-
tism.”16 Overall, ‘unfettered national sovereignty’ is recognised as a major ob-
stacle to securing human rights of all peoples. It is suggested that the dependency
of the enjoyment of rights on states needs to be minimised in the light of a new
mind-set which recognises that, “what happens to one member of the human
family happens to us all.”17 If supported internationally, the mechanisms for
both monitoring and enforcing human rights standards can be made more effec-
tive in the light of this new priority.

Assuming that it is widely accepted that, “The national state has reached the
limits of its development as an independent, self-directed social body,” 18 and
that it is accepted that, “Conceived of as an end in itself, the national state has
come to be a denial of the oneness of mankind, the source of general disrup-
tion opposed to the true interests of its people”;19 then what is to follow? The
Bahá’í International Community recognises that human rights does require sov-
ereignty to support and guarantee it. It is argued that, “a right is only valid and
effective when upheld by an independent sovereignty,” 20 and also that the na-
tion state system has lost ‘real sovereignty’. In its stead, it is proposed that, “To
reevaluate the elementary rights of the past, and establish essential new rights
in keeping with our own age, a world sovereignty is required.”21 So it is not just
minor adjustments to the operation of the present sovereign state system that is
being proposed in order to ensure a more effective means of securing rights,
but the emergence of another level of sovereignty altogether.

But will moving the challenge to a higher level better defend human rights?

Even at this higher level of proposed ‘world sovereignty’ the principle of
avoiding excessive centralisation is emphasised. The principle remains that:

> International institutions should be given the authority to act only on issues of international
> concern where states cannot act on their own or to intervene for the preservation of the
> rights of peoples and member states. All other matters should be relegated to national
> and local institutions.22

‘Abdu’l-Bahá himself has emphasised this principle:

> It is very evident that in the future there shall be no centralization in the countries of the
> world, be they constitutional in government, republican or democratic in form.… To cast
> aside centralization which promotes despotism is the exigency of the time. This will be
> productive of international peace.23

The idea is, therefore, to broaden existing loyalties to allow the emer-
gence of a non-centralised world sovereignty. Only issues that cannot be dealt
with at other levels, or on which there is international concern, are to be as-
signed to this level. The balance of power structure that is to emerge needs to
be equally cognisant of both the, “evils of excessive centralization,” 24 and that of
diversity and facilitating a, “wider loyalty, a larger aspiration.”25

This, “more intricate political landscape”26 which is put forward, also re-
quires the development of civil society from the grassroots. The Bahá’í Inter-
national Community proposals to date have already included suggestions about
allowing NGOs to attend open session of the UN Security Council as observ-
ers, of shifting the NGO consultative status structure to that of the UN as a
whole rather than just to ECOSOC, to establish a Trust Fund to support the
access and work of NGOs, and to enhance the logistical support given to NGOs
at the UN.27

And, finally, it is not at the level of the empowerment of civil society actors
at which this new project is to end. It is proposed that human rights education
itself should be promoted around the world, in order that people themselves
may become excited about human rights, feel empowered to stand up for the
rights of others as well as themselves, where they should sense collective
responsibility towards human rights, and themselves work towards the
realisation of these rights. Whereas in the present world structure the work of
the human rights defender can often be risky and fatal, with the re-orientation
of the concept of sovereignty and its goal, and the machinery which can be more
intrusive in the defence of rights, the defence of human rights from the grassroots
fits effectively into the larger picture. It is proposed by the Bahá’í International
Community that governments alone cannot implement human rights, and that
what is required is a sense of collective responsibility—that each person take
responsibility and action whenever and wherever human rights violations oc-
cur, and be active in the promotion of the rights of others. This would create a
co-operative environment for the prospering of rights,28 and could eventually
complete the circle in forging this world in which, “a violation of the rights of
one would be felt as a violation of the rights of all.” 29

Human rights education would aim to kindle in individuals an awareness of,
and a sensitivity and devotion30 to, human rights. The aim would be the transfor-
mation of the attitudes and behaviour of individuals, towards creating the daily

reality of a culture of respect for rights at the local and national level.31 Teach-
ing people about their own rights would only be one part of this goal. What is
of significance in this human rights education project is that it also aims to
develop respect for the rights of humanity in general.32 This suggestion of wider
responsibility for ensuring rights has, as its final implication, profound impact
on the framework in which human rights are currently proposed, agreed, pur-
sued and monitored.

It might seem to some that the possible dangers of changing the world struc-
ture so dramatically from a tried and tested system to which we have become
accustomed to over centuries seems far too risky. Those who prosper within
this system, and those who have not been touched directly by violations of
human rights, may even be diametrically opposed to such propositions. How-
ever, the Bahá’í International Community reminds us of the premise on which
all social structures supposedly rest, that, “the governance of human affairs”
should be, “conducted along lines that serve humanity’s real needs.33 Put more
sharply, Shoghi Effendi has asserted:

> If long-cherished ideals and time-honoured institutions, if certain social assumptions and
> religious formulae have ceased to promote the welfare of the generality of mankind, if
> they no longer minister to the needs of a continually evolving humanity, let them be swept
> away and relegated to the limbo of obsolescent and forgotten doctrines. Why should
> these, in a world subject to the immutable law of change and decay, be exempt from the
> deterioration that must needs overtake every human institution? For legal standards, po-
> litical and economic theories are solely designed to safeguard the interests of humanity as
> a whole, and not humanity to be crucified for the preservation of the integrity of any
> particular law or doctrine.34

Conclusion

In conclusion, it can be seen that the Bahá’í position on human rights greatly
implicates sovereignty. Of course the positioning of state sovereignty either as
a smokescreen or a necessary partner in securing rights sharply posits one
against the other, whereas the situation is much more intertwined and complex.
The aim is to lessen the former, whilst not making the latter role of state sov-
ereignty impossible—and this would seem to be the position that the Bahá’í
view supports in its proposals for a new world order. It would also seem that
the current international human rights machinery is very gradually edging the
traditional concept of sovereignty towards some of the Bahá’í proposals for
world order—in accepting the naming and shaming of states in cases of human

rights abuses, in expecting regular state reporting in UN treaty bodies and
regional mechanisms, and increasing the access and role of NGOs to the human
rights machinery.

Whereas the Bahá’í International Community points towards a Bahá’í vision
of where we should be heading, many of the finer questions remain to be
worked out. These include the long-term challenges of how to recognise the
role of non-state actors in the abuse of human rights 35 without giving undue
recognition to bodies which are not voted to power and are therefore less
accountable; the question of how to increase the intricacy of the international
architecture supporting rights without confusing ultimate legal responsibilities
for generating and guaranteeing rights; and the problem of how to make deci-
sion-making regarding human rights standards and protection more accountable
without weakening the experience and machinery already created, or eliminat-
ing the painful gains already made in the development of rights. Rights should
come home closer to people, but exactly how this will develop, and the pre-
cise machinery that will support it, is yet to evolve.
