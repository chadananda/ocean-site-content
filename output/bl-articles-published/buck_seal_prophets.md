       Beyond the “Seal of the Prophets”:
Bah’u’llh’s Book of Certitude
(Ketb-e ±qn)

Christopher Buck

Introduction

Because of its international audience, Bah’u’llh’s Book of Certitude
(Ketb-e ±qn) may now be regarded as the world’s most influential
Koran commentary in Persian outside the Muslim world. The basis for
this claim is simple: the ±qn is coextensive with the Bah’¥ faith. As its
preeminent doctrinal text, the ±qn helped crystallize Bah’¥ identity
and lent considerable impetus to its missionary expansion. The core
claims advanced by the ±qn have, in principle, been adapted to other
religious environments. It is post-Islamic by dint of its claims: the ±qn
vindicates the prophetic credentials of Sayyid ‘Ali-Muhammad Shirazi,
known as “the Bb” (d. 1850), who broke decisively from Islam in
1844, by declaring himself to be the inaugurator of a new religious cy-
cle. “Revealed” in January, 1861, the ±qn sets the stage for Bah’u’l-
lh’s impending claim to revelation in April 1863 in Baghdad.

The ±qn advances an Islamic argument to legitimate its post-Islamic
claims. The ±qn’s most original and dramatic act of Koranic interpreta-
tion may well be its argument for how God could (and would) send an-
other prophet after Muhammad, notwithstanding the latter’s station as
the “Seal of the Prophets” (Q. 33:40). Bah’u’llh’s exegetical strategy
is a tour de force – using an essentially Islamic argument to prove
something ostensibly alien to orthodox Islam, both Sunni and Shi‘a.
More significant than its theological argument, however, is the ±qn’s
historical impact. Even though, from the Islamic point of view, the ±qn
argued the impossible, Bah’u’llh’s discourse on realized eschatology
became a self-fulfilling prophecy. The argument for a post-Islamic rev-
elation was not academic. It was historical.

In order to understand the ±qn, it is necessary to know something
about the Bb¥ movement, which provides the ±qn’s immediate histor-
ical context. The year 1260/1844-1845 marked the Shiite millennium, a

370                                Religious Texts in Iranian Languages

thousand lunar years since the occultation of the 12th Imam. On 22
May 1844, the Bb effected a decisive, eschatological break from Is-
lam. The Bb “proclaimed himself the focus of an Islamic apocalypse”
(Lawson, “Structure,” 8). This eschatological end of history presuppos-
es the formal end of the authority of Islam, and the beginning of a new
cycle of revelation. The ±qn, therefore, is an extension and further de-
velopment of the Bb’s radical break with Islam. Bah’u’llh extempo-
raneously dictated the ±qn within the space of two days and two nights,
at the request of the uncle of the Bb, who was puzzled about the claims
of his martyred nephew. The book is composed in Persian (rather than
in Arabic, as would be expected), which rendered the text immediately
accessible to its initial Bb¥ audience.

The questions posed by the Bb’s uncle make up the structure of the
±qn. These original questions, preserved in family archives, have been
published in facsimile. They were penned on two sheets of paper and
organized under four headings, all dealing with popular Shi‘i expecta-
tions of the Islamic eschaton, the principal actor of which was to be the
expected Q’em (the Shi‘i counterpart of the Mahdi in Sunni tradi-
tions). The questions may be summarized so:

1. The Day of Resurrection: Will it be corporeal? How will the just

be recompensed and the wicked dealt with?
2. The Twelfth Imam: How can traditions attesting his occultation be

explained?
3. Koranic Interpretation: How can the literal meaning of scripture

be reconciled with the interpretations current among Bb¥s?
4. Advent of the Q’em: How can the apparent non-fulfillment of

> popular Imami traditions concerning the Resurrector be ex-
> plained?

These questions all center on the seeming contradiction caused by the
Bb’s claim to a realized eschaton in the absence of a literal fulfillment
of scripture and popular expectation.

Exegesis established a doctrinal foundation for the faith Bah’u’llh
was to create, in which eschatology was transformed into spiritual and
legislative authority. The ±qn provided an eschatological bridge into a
new religious world view. The Bah’¥ prophet-founder’s most contro-
versial Koranic argument is his claim that Muslim scholars had erred in
their interpretation of the “Seal” verse (Q. 33:40) by not recognizing the
promise of a post-Koranic revelation just four verses later at Q. 33:44.

Bah’u’llh’s Book of Certitude                                         371

In fine, this latter verse refers to the eschatological meeting with God –
a beatific encounter reserved for the faithful. Bah’u’llh argues some-
thing quite different. His reading of the verse is that it is a veiled refer-
ence to the Bb. Since God cannot be seen, then the Koran’s promises
that the faithful would behold the face of God must perforce be sym-
bolic. To enter into the presence of God is to attain the presence of
God’s “Manifestation,” or Prophet.

Bah’u’llh’s novel interpretation is said to be entirely consonant
with the deep meaning of the Koran, yet incompatible with the ortho-
dox understanding of it. It achieved a breakthrough in creating a real
possibility for a post-Koranic claim to revelation, which the Bb had al-
ready advanced. The ±qn expounds apocalyptic passages of the Koran
– texts that defied precise interpretation yet inspired a plethora of them.
Cambridge Orientalist Edward Granville Browne, writes of the ±qn
that “it is a work of great merit, vigorous in style, clear in argument, co-
gent in proof, and displaying no slight knowledge of the Bible, Koran,
and Traditions” (Selections 254).

The ±qn as a Work of Koranic Tafs¥r

The ±qn is essentially an exposition of the Bah’¥ doctrine of “Pro-
gressive Revelation,” which is a theory of civilization in which spiritu-
al evolution is the engine of social evolution. However broadly the ±qn
expatiates on spiritual “sovereignty” – that is, on the moral and spiritu-
al authority of the prophets of God, the text focuses particularly on the
authority of the Bb. In a manner of speaking, Bah’u’llh’s thesis is
that the Koran, the ˘ad¥th, and even the Bible anticipate a future
prophet of God who would appear at the end (or culmination) of histo-
ry. Now, the Koran says nothing about these things outwardly. There-
fore, in order to argue that the Koran says something inwardly, it is nec-
essary to enter into a sophisticated religious argument that explores the
subtle dimensions of the Koran. It is an argument that depends on rules
of inference in order to supersede existing doctrine. To achieve this, the
±qn speaks at length about the nature of the Koran and how its sub-
tleties may be discovered and elucidated.

At the time the ±qn was revealed, the Koran remained inviolable as
the primary authority in an erstwhile Islamic context. In the Muslim
world, no idea could be entertained, much less accepted, unless it was
somehow anchored in the Koran itself. Interpretation of the Koran is

372                                Religious Texts in Iranian Languages

technically known as tafs¥r. I believe that the most useful introduction
to this literature is that of Andrew Rippin’s entry on “Tafs¥r” in the En-
cyclopedia of Religion (1987); and the most comprehensive Western
academic study of tafs¥r, in all its dimensions and historical contexts, is
Approaches to the History of the Interpretation of the Koran, edited by
Rippin (Oxford, 1988). What kind of tafs¥r is the ±qn? First, it is not a
classical tafs¥r, in that the ±qn is not a verse-by-verse running com-
mentary. Rather, the ±qn is a work of symbolic exegesis of the Koran
and, to a lesser extent, of the New Testament.

Exegesis is typically far more than mere interpretation serving to elu-
cidate a sacred text. Typically, especially in post-classical works of
tafs¥r, the exegete has a definite agenda. Interpretation thus becomes
the vehicle for propounding that agenda. While the interpretation serves
to elucidate the text, the inverse holds true, too. The interpreter invokes
the authority of the Koran as revelation to validate a particular view. In
such a case, exegesis is apology, written in defense of a position held.
The ±qn focused on spiritual authority from an Islamic perspective, ra-
tionalizing the eschatologically conceived fulfillment of Islam in the
advent of the Bb.

The ±qn also served to heighten the adventist fervor current in the
Bb¥ community, in anticipation of the advent of a Messianic figure
foretold by the Bb, eschatologically realized in the person of
Bah’u’llh himself on the event of his declaration in Baghdad in April
1863\. While the Bb (and subsequently Bah’u’llh himself) main-
tained continuity with Islam at a doctrinal level, historically this claim
of fulfillment was tantamount to a break from Islam.

Shi‘i Background

The interpretive strategies in Bah’u’llh’s work are amply attested in
the classical Shi‘i heritage. In A2br¥ Shi‘ism, the Koran as a text is
functionally inseparable from its valid interpretation. Although inter-
pretation is still a human enterprise, the methodological guarantor of
accuracy is reliance upon traditions ascribed to the Imams. In this re-
spect, the sacred text is imbued with the charisma of both the Prophet
and the Imams.

The Koran is said to contain coded language. In his extensive studies
of the Bb¥ and Shi‘i background of Bah’¥ exegesis, Todd Lawson ren-
ders from the French Corbin’s translation of a statement from the Bb’s

Bah’u’llh’s Book of Certitude                                        373

spiritual precursor, Sayyid Kazim-i Rashti: “When you have under-
stood that the true meaning, the spiritual Idea of the Koran is a code
(ramz) which only God Most High, the Prophets and the members of
His House understand, […] then it will be clear that our understanding
of this code varies according to the diversity of our faculties of under-
standing” (trans. Lawson, “Akhbr¥ Sh¥¥ Approaches to Tafs¥r,” 204).
This “code” obviously requires decoding. Bah’u’llh demonstrates
that the Koran has a symbolic dimension that only an inspired inter-
preter might accurately demystify.

Exegetical Style and Techniques

Bah’u’llh’s interpretations entail some complex and original acts of
exegesis. First, it should be pointed out that Bah’u’llh’s discourse
style is inherently exegetical, with frequent pairings, linked by the Per-
sian metaphorical genitive (eżfe-ye maJz), of Koranic symbol and ref-
erent. The eżfe is a construct – an enclitic to be precise – used for pos-
sessive, partitive, and descriptive purposes. Bah’u’llh’s use of this
construct becomes, in itself, an important exegetical device. In the
course of exegesis, Bah’u’llh interprets a verse, explicating a symbol
by suggesting its referent. He then uses both symbol and referent to-
gether, bound grammatically by the Persian construct, to reinforce his
exegesis. Bah’u’llh coordinates his various explications by means of
extended metaphors, invariably drawn from nature. In other words,
Bah’u’llh’s very discourse style itself reinforces his symbolic inter-
pretations of Koranic texts.

Bah’u’llh’s repertoire of exegetical techniques exceeds, but in-
cludes most of the twelve “procedural devices” attested in classical
tafs¥r: poetic loci probantes, lexical explanation, grammatical explana-
tion, rhetorical explanation, periphrasis, analogy, abrogation, circum-
stances of revelation, identification of the vague and ambiguous,
prophetical tradition, and anecdote (Wansbrough, QS, Part II). Further-
more, although many of Bah’u’llh’s interpretations have an elegant
simplicity, some of his interpretations actually conflict with traditional
Islamic interpretations and often require a rather complex syntactical
and semantic analysis. Generally, Bah’u’llh has a two-step procedure
for interpreting an eschatological text: first, establish that the text in
question is figurative, not literal, and then provide its symbolic purport.

Rhetorical Argumentation

Hermeneutically, the ±qn resonates with five Islamic orientations to
symbolism: (1) the semanticism of rhetoric (esp. ‘elm-e Bayn, “sci-
ence of tropes”); (2) the dialectic of theology (kalm); (3) reason
(‘aql¥ye) and analogy (q¥ys) as a reflex of philosophy (falsafe); (4) use
of allusion (e‰re) and gnosis (ma‘refe-ye qalb¥ye) in Sufi mysticism;
(5) recourse to apocalyptic presentism (adducing prophetic proof-texts
to instantiate a “realized eschatology”), characteristic of millenarian
sectarianism. But before he actually engages in symbolic interpretation,
Bah’u’llh first establishes the symbolic nature of the Koran itself.

Literal texts require little interpretation beyond explication, whereas
symbolic texts are not as they appear to be and require interpretation.
For the latter approach to be accepted, the reader must be convinced
that a text has a symbolic dimension based on a figurative substrate.
The most effective strategy for arguing symbolism, beyond assertion, is
to predicate symbolism on figurative language. As tropical discourse,
figurative language, by nature, excludes literal interpretation, which
would otherwise lead to absurdity. Bah’u’llh therefore advanced a
figuration-based rationale to demonstratively establish Koranic sym-
bolism.

Bah’u’llh advances arguments that are, in certain respects, analo-
gous to the strategies of Sunni rhetoricians who demonstrated occur-
rences of figures of speech in the Koran as a feature of its eloquence
and inimitability. The figurative reading of a verse must not lead to ab-
surdity. Nor should a literal reading. In the ±qn, prior to his actual sym-
bolic exegesis, Bah’u’llh logically demonstrates the presence of figu-
rative language in the Koran, based largely on appeals to absurdities
that result from literal readings. Once the symbolic valence of the Ko-
ran has been established, symbols in prophecy are interpreted and then
contemporized within Bah’u’llh’s own historical present, leaving the
reader to accept or reject their fulfillment. Such an interpretive move
often involves the verdict of absurdity after having overruled the sur-
face meaning of anthropomorphisms in scripture. Hence, Bah’u’llh’s
exegetical procedure at Q. 39:67 overrules a literal reading of the es-
chatological hand of God, as it entails both impossibility and anthropo-
morphist entrapment:

> And now, comprehend the meaning of this verse: “The whole earth
> shall on the Resurrection Day be but His handful, and in His right
Bah’u’llh’s Book of Certitude                                        375

> hand shall the heavens be folded together.” […] And now, be fair in
> thy judgment. Were this verse to have the meaning which men sup-
> pose it to have, of what profit, one may ask, could it be to man?
> Moreover, it is evident and manifest that no such hand as could be
> seen by human eye could accomplish such deeds, or could possibly
> be ascribed to the exalted Essence of the one true God. Nay, to ac-
> knowledge such a thing is naught but sheer blasphemy, an utter per-
> version of the truth (ET 47-48).

Here, the “right hand” of God receives a negative interpretation. What-
ever it means, it cannot mean what it literally says. For to assert that
God has a “right hand” is sheer anthropomorphism, and a full projec-
tion of human attributes onto the Deity. The literal interpretations hav-
ing thus been overruled, a positive interpretation follows:

> On the contrary, by the term “earth” is meant the earth of understand-
> ing and knowledge, and by the “heavens” the heavens of divine Rev-
> elation. Reflect thou how, in one hand, He hath, by His mighty grasp,
> turned the earth of knowledge and understanding, previously unfold-
> ed, into a mere handful, and, on the other, spread out a new and high-
> ly exalted earth in the hearts of men, thus causing the freshest and
> loveliest blossoms, and the mightiest and loftiest trees to spring forth
> in the illumined bosom of man” (ET 48).

Note the illustrative use of nature imagery, transported into the psychic
realm, where spiritual life is described as an interior landscape, an inner
world. The Koran, while rich in symbolism, is not transparent. Divine
authority, in both Shi‘i and Bb¥ contexts, is needed to interpret Koran-
ic references to divinity and to resolve the problem of anthropomor-
phisms in the text. Such interpretation becomes even more sensitive
when it comes to the subject of Muhammad himself, as the Koran rep-
resents him.

The “Seal of the Prophets”

The Koran dignifies Muhammad as the “Seal of the Prophets” (Q.
33:40). In the earliest currents of Islamic consciousness, this honorific
was by no means understood uniformly (see Yohanan Friedmann, “Fi-
nality of Prophethood in Islam,” Jerusalem Studies in Arabic and Islam

376                               Religious Texts in Iranian Languages

7 [1986]). The concept of Muhammad being the final messenger of God
was firmly entrenched in Islamic doctrine, both Sunni and Shi‘a. In
Shi‘ism, however, the concept of walya (arab.) allowed for a continu-
ation of divine guidance after the death of the Prophet. Such guidance
was considered subordinate to the revelation of the Koran, of course.
But the Bb had dared to proclaim himself more than an Imam, and a
messenger equal to or greater than Muhammad, with a revelation that
surpassed the Koran in scope and authority. This, obviously, challenged
the very foundations of Islam.

From the perspective of classical Sunni Islam as well as Shi‘ism,
Bah’u’llh achieved the seemingly impossible: to show that God could
reveal a prophet after Muhammad. The manner in which Bah’u’llh
did so requires some explanation.

First, Bah’u’llh applied Koranic concepts of the oneness of the
prophets to relativize the idea of the “Seal of the Prophets” as a term
that applies to all of the prophets, not just Muhammad. In other words,
Bah’u’llh relativizes the orthodox claim of Muhammad’s finality in
order to supersede it. One of the ways Bah’u’llh does this is by refo-
cusing the reader’s attention a mere four verses later (Q. 33:44), where
the Koran speaks of eschatological attainment to the presence of God
on the Last Day. Central to Bah’u’llh’s argument in the ±qn is the ar-
gument that the Koranic promise of what Bah’u’llh refers to as “at-
tainment unto the Presence of God” is an allusion to the appearance of
another Manifestation of God at the eschaton. How is this possible?

Identification of the eschatological encounter with God (Q. 33:44,
10:45, 6:31, 2:249, 2:46, 11:29, 69:20, 13:2, 6:154, 18:111, 29:23) with
the advent the Q’em (Riser/Resurrector) had already been established
by Sheykh Ahmad Ahsa’i (d. 1241/1825), founder of the Shey2¥ School,
which was the immediate ideological forebear of Bb¥ -Bah’¥ thought.
Shaykh Ahmad’s approach to eschatological verses – classified as am-
biguous (mota‰beht) – was “rational” (interpreting away anthropo-
morphisms) and allegorical. As for “seeing” God on the Day of Judg-
ment, Shaykh Ahmad rejected a literal interpretation in favor of an
Imamocentric one. On the basis of certain Shi‘i traditions, Sheykh Ah-
mad interpreted the Day of Judgment as the Day of the advent of the ex-
pected Q’em, who would bring about changes in the social, moral, and
religious life of the world (Rafati 118-119).

By shifting the focus of prophetological attention away from the
“Seal” verse itself to refocus on the several Koranic “Divine Presence”
verses could Bah’u’llh make an Islamic case for post-Koranic revela-

tion. From a certain point of view, his entire line of argumentation in the
±qn is calculated to establish the priority of Q. 33:44 over Q. 33:40.
Bah’u’llh accepts the importance of the Koranic verse designating
Muhammad as “the Seal of the Prophets” (Q. 33:40), yet draws atten-
tion to an exegetical oversight but four verses later:

> How strange! […] Even as the Lord of being hath in His unerring
> Book [the Koran], after speaking of the “Seal” in His exalted utter-
> ance: “Muhammad is the Apostle of God and the Seal of the
> Prophets” (Q. 33:40), hath revealed unto all people the promise
> (va’de) of “attainment unto the divine Presence” (laq-ye 2od, cf.
> Q. 33:44). To this attainment to the presence of the immortal King
> testify the verses of the Book, some of which We have already men-
> tioned. The one true God is My witness! Nothing (h¥ã amr¥) more ex-
> alted or more explicit than “attainment unto the divine Presence”
> (a‘zam-e az laq va aßra˛-e az n) hath been revealed in the Koran
> (forqn). […]

> And yet, through the mystery of the former verse, they have turned
> away from the grace promised by the latter, despite the fact that “at-
> tainment unto the divine Presence” in the “Day of Resurrection” is
> explicitly stated in the Book. It hath been demonstrated and definite-
> ly established, through clear evidences, that by “Resurrection” is
> meant the rise of the Manifestation of God to proclaim His Cause,
> and by “attainment unto the divine Presence” is meant attainment
> unto the presence of His Beauty in the person of His Manifestation.
> For verily, “No vision taketh in Him, but He taketh in all vision” (Q.

6:103). ( ±qn 169-70/Persian text, 112)

This argument is predicated on an anti–anthropomorphist interpretation
of Q. 6:103. It would be safe to say that, for Muslims universally, the
Koran’s designation of Muhammad as the “Seal of the Prophets” (Q.
33:40) is possibly the most important prophetological verse of the Ko-
ran (certainly it ranks as one of the most crucial verses doctrinally). Yet
Bah’u’llh here points to a verse just four verses later, and makes that
verse (and its parallels) the centerpiece of his exegesis and the crux of
his entire argument: “Their greeting on the day when they shall meet
Him shall be “Peace!” And He hath got ready for them a noble recom-
pense” (Q. 33:44).

While this brief description of the ±qn scarcely does justice to its

broader range of Koranic interpretations, the reader should now have a
clear idea as to the book’s purpose, theophanic claims, and historical
impact. As a heterodox work of tafs¥r, the ±qn advances an Islamic ar-
gument to exegetically create the possibility of post-Koranic prophets.
For this and other reasons, the ±qn preserves its place as the preemi-
nent doctrinal text of the Bah’¥ faith. To claim that the ±qn may now
be regarded as the world’s most influential Koran commentary outside
the Muslim world is simply to acknowledge the historical fact that the
Bah’¥ religion has spun out of its Islamic orbit and radiated globally,
while maintaining its Islamic roots.
