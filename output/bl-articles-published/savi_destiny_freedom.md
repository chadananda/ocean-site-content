destiny and freedom in the
Bahá’í Writings
Julio Savi

Abstract
To know the boundaries of one’s destiny and freedom and, especially, to know
how the latter can be best used are two very common aspirations among human
beings. This paper will comment upon a number of relevant, mainly officially
translated, Writings, some untranslated Tablets, as well as a few talks by ‘abdu’l-
Bahá and interpretations by Shoghi effendi. human destiny is a mystery and only
the true seeker can obtain an insight into it. life itself will assist him in this
endeavor. human beings are free, and yet their lives are regulated by the decrees
of God, both irrevocable and revocable decrees. a man best uses his freedom, if he
understands God’s will and makes a disciplined effort to fulfill it in his daily life,
with radiant acquiescence.

Résumé
Tout être humain aspire à savoir dans quelle mesure il est libre d’influer sur son
destin et, surtout, comment utiliser au mieux sa liberté. l’auteur commente
divers Écrits pertinents tirés principalement de traductions officielles, mais
provenant aussi de tablettes non encore traduites, de quelques causeries de
‘abdu’l-Bahá, ainsi que d’interprétations des écrits par Shoghi effendi. le destin
de l’homme est un mystère que seul un vrai chercheur peut espérer appréhender.
la vie elle-même l’aidera dans sa quête. Bien que l’être humain soit libre, sa vie
est régie par les décrets de dieu, dont certains sont révocables, d’autres irrévoca-
bles. l’être humain utilisera sa liberté au mieux s’il comprend la volonté de dieu
et si, dans la vie de tous les jours, il s’efforce diligemment de l’accomplir avec un
acquiescement radieux.

Conocer los límites de nuestro destino y libertad y, especialmente, conocer cómo
este último puede ser mejor utilizado son dos aspiraciones muy comunes entre los
seres humanos. este ensayo comentará acerca de un número de escritos rele-
vantes, principalmente traducciones oficiales, algunas Tablas no traducidas, así
como unas charlas de ‘abdu’l-Bahá e interpretaciones de Shoghi effendi. el des-
tino humano es un misterio y solamente el verdadero buscador puede lograr algu-
na percepción de él. la vida misma lo asistirá en este empeño. los seres humanos
son libres, y sin embargo sus vidas son reguladas por los decretos de dios, decre-
tos tanto irrevocables como revocables. un hombre utiliza mejor su libertad si
entiende la voluntad de dios y hace un esfuerzo disciplinado para cumplir con ella
en su vida diaria, con aquiescencia radiante.

To know the boundaries of one’s destiny and freedom and, especially, to
know how the latter—which seems a fundamental element of human life,
if human life must have a meaning—can be best used are undoubtedly two
very common aspirations among human beings. The Bahá’í Writings give
the cue for many reflections on these issues and offer advice on how these
two legitimate aspirations may be attained. We will be satisfied with a few
considerations based on the study of a number of relevant, authoritatively
translated Writings, and some untranslated Tablets, as well as a few talks
by ‘abdu’l-Bahá and interpretations by Shoghi effendi.

The True Seeker and The MySTerieS of deSTiny

a first reflection arises from what Bahá’u’lláh writes, in his four valleys,
about destiny, which in those circumstances he calls “God’s immutable
decree [qadar], his foreordained mystery [sirr-i-muqaddar; lit., the mystery

Destiny and Freedom in the Bahá’í Writings                       3

of predestination]” (Seven Valleys 57). he writes: “[W]hen searchers
inquired of this, he [imam ‘alí] made reply, ‘This is a bottomless sea which
none shall ever fathom.’ and they asked again, and he answered, ‘it is the
blackest of nights through which none can find his way’” (57). Then
Bahá’u’lláh adds: “Whoso knoweth this secret will assuredly hide it, and
were he to reveal but its faintest trace they would nail him to the cross.
yet, by the living God, were there any true seeker, i would divulge it to
him; for they have said: ‘love is a light that never dwelleth in a heart pos-
sessed by fear’” (57–58).

if we relate these words to our daily experiences, one of the meanings
they seem to convey is as follows. although destiny is a mystery, if one
will love God and will have the courage to demonstrate that love through
one’s behavior, God’s Messenger will make one understand the secret of
one’s destiny and, hopefully, the meaning and the boundaries of one’s
freedom.

huMan BeinGS are free

That each human being is a free creature is beyond any doubt. Bahá’u’lláh
states it very clearly: “unto each one hath been prescribed a pre-ordained
measure, as decreed in God’s mighty and guarded Tablets. all that which
ye potentially possess can, however, be manifested only as a result of your
own volition [irádih]” (Gleanings 149, 77:1). one’s freedom makes every
human being responsible for one’s own deeds, for which one will finally
“be called to give account” (Bahá’u’lláh, arabic hidden Words, no. 31),
“for surely if deeds were not rewarded and yielded no fruit, then the
Cause of God . . . would prove futile” (Bahá’u’lláh, Súriy-i-vafá, in Tablets
189).

Therefore Bahá’u’lláh seems to deny any form of predestination, intend-
ed as “the foreordination by God of each individual’s ultimate destiny par-
ticularly eternal life” (Webster’s Third International Dictionary, s.v. “predesti-
nation”). Seemingly he also disallows any form of determinism, intended
as “the philosophical theory which holds . . . that all man’s volitions are
invariably determined by pre-existing circumstances.”1 finally, he seems

4              The Journal of Bahá’í Studies 20. 1/4. 2010

to bar the way to any idea similar to those expressed by the Persian
philosopher Muh.ammad ibn Zakaríyá ar-rází (c. 864–932), when he wrote:
“Man’s actions are commissioned according to allah’s decree and destiny,
over which men have no choice, and there is not in existence anything
other than predestination” (qtd. in nasr and leaman 131), or like the ideas
expressed by Shamsu’d-dín h  . áfiz. (c. 1318–1390) in the following verses:

Give contentment to that (God) given; unloose the frown from

thy forehead:
for, the door of choice is not opened to me and thee.” (89)

according to the Bahá’í teachings, human beings are free and responsi-
ble creatures. all we have to do is to discover the boundaries and the
meaning of this freedom, so that we may understand the thing of greatest
concern for us, how we can best use it.

life’S inSiGhTS inTo The MySTerieS of deSTiny

Bahá’u’lláh explains all these concepts in a Tablet he addressed to a lady,
whom he calls “the fruit of My Tree and the leaf thereof ” (Gleanings 132,
68:1). The contents of this Tablet suggest that this lady has lost a son and
is understandably upset. Bahá’u’lláh comforts her saying: “Wert thou to
scan the pages of the Book of life [daftar-i-‘álam], thou wouldst, most cer-
tainly, discover that which would dissipate thy sorrows and dissolve thine
anguish” (133). These words seem to suggest that life can give us a wis-
dom that will help us to understand the meaning and the boundaries of
our destiny and of our freedom of choice and thus to live a better life.

in this Tablet to his “leaf ” Bahá’u’lláh writes that whatever happens is
the fruit of a divine decree. and ‘abdu’l-Bahá explains that “the divine
decrees [taqádír-i-ilahíyyih] are the mighty and sound relations among the
parts of the created world. each cause [amr] is connected with all the other
causes and each affair is bound to the necessary relations among all
affairs.”2 “nothing can befall us but what God hath destined for us,” writes
Bahá’u’lláh in this regard (Seven Valleys 35), quoting Qur’án 9:51. These

Destiny and Freedom in the Bahá’í Writings                   5

words remind ears accustomed to Christian Scripture of Matthew
10:29–31: “are not two sparrows sold for a farthing? and one of them shall
not fall on the ground without your father. But the very hairs of your
head are all numbered. fear ye not therefore, ye are of more value than
many sparrows.” and our remarks could stop here: the highest lesson we
can learn from scanning “the pages of the Book of life” is the capacity of
accepting “the summons of his decree [qad.á],” that is, whatever happens,
with “radiant acquiescence [rid.á]” (Kitáb-i-Íqán 235, par. 264).

TWo kindS of divine deCreeS

however, Bahá’u’lláh offers to his “leaf ” other elements, so that she may
begin to cope with her loss. he explains that the events in life are regulat-
ed by two kinds of divine decrees: “The one is irrevocable [mah. túm], the
other is, as termed by men, impending” (Gleanings 133, 68:2). The meanings
of “irrevocable” and “impending” decrees are clarified in his Tablet to áqá
ah.mad: “That which is considered irrevocable is not subject to change. all
the rest is subject to change through the effect of means and actions” (84).
Bahá’u’lláh’s counsel is that “Both [decrees] are to be obeyed and accepted”
(Gleanings 133, 68:2). and yet, he adds, if God wants, any decree can be
modified, even those which he has defined as “irrevocable.” he also states
that “[a]s the harm that must result from such a change will be greater than
if the decree had remained unaltered, all, therefore, should willingly acqui-
esce in what God hath willed and confidently abide by the same.”

The possibility for his irrevocable decrees to be changed makes us think
of so-called miracles, intended as “a marvelous event occurring within
human experience, which cannot have been brought about by human
power or by the operation of any natural agency, and must therefore be
ascribed to the special intervention of the deity or of some supernatural
being. . . .” (Oxford English Dictionary, s.v. “miracle”).

Certain people turn to God asking him to perform miracles in their
lives. as to these people, Bahá’u’lláh’s admonishment is that it is better for
us to accept his decrees, because he “knoweth all things and readily
answereth the call” (Tablets 267). others think miracles to be impossible

6               The Journal of Bahá’í Studies 20. 1/4. 2010

because they imply a breach of the laws of nature. however, Shoghi
effendi explains that “miracles are always possible, even though they do
not constitute a regular channel whereby God reveals his power to
mankind. . . . God Who is the author of the universe can, in his Wisdom
and omnipotence, bring any change, no matter how temporary, in the
operation of the laws which he himself has created.”3

The concept of miracles, their possibility, and the reason why they are
so rare, is explained by Bahá’u’lláh in a Tablet known as S.ah.ífiy-i-
Shat.t.íyyih or “Book of the river,” of which we have a provisional transla-
tion. in this Tablet Bahá’u’lláh writes:

> When viewed with the eye of insight, no phenomenon on earth could
> be comprehended by any human, whether high or low, without prior
> observation and experience. observe the sun in the heavens. To the
> extent that it is manifest, it giveth splendor and illumination to the
> entirety of the inhabitants of the earth in the east, the west, and all
> other directions. Certainly, human reason would not be inclined to
> accept the possibility of the existence of such a thing by means of any
> rational definition or description without actual observation and
> experience. it is the same with all other things in God’s creation.
> reflect, so that the secret of this question may become disclosed to
> thee. all things are miracles of the Prophets. . . . (57)

The whole created world is a miracle worked through the ordained flow
of God’s revelation, a flow which Bahá’u’lláh compares to the flow of a
“flooding river.” he remarks that “[w]hatever hath appeared or will appear
is like this river. each thing moveth or reposeth in its proper place. But if
something contrary to this natural flow of events is manifested, the order
of the world becometh gravely disrupted” (59). nader Saiedi, in his article
on that Tablet, points out that “[t]he miracles desired by people would
involve an unnatural interruption in the natural course of divine revela-
tion. if the river’s course were artificially changed, then some dry lands
would be irrigated but many others would be destroyed and far more neg-
ative consequences would result” (33).

Bahá’u’lláh thus envisages a creation ruled by natural laws which are
expressions of the Word of God, intended both as “the Cause which hath
preceded the contingent world” and “the Command of God which per-
vadeth all created things” (lawh.-i-h.ikmat, in Tablets 141), that is, the cre-
ative impulse which brings into existence physical reality, but also the uni-
versal law pervading the entire creation. The constant operation of those
laws is a guarantor of order and harmony. in this sense ‘abdu’l-Bahá
explains in a Tablet:

> fate [qad.á’] and predestination [qadar] consist in the necessary and
> indispensable relationships which exist in the realities of things.
> These relationships have been placed in the realities of existent
> beings through the power of creation and every incident is a conse-
> quence of the necessary relationship. for example, God hath created
> a relation between the sun and the terrestrial globe that the rays of
> the sun should shine and the soil should yield. These relationships
> constitute predestination, and the manifestation thereof in the plane
> of existence is fate. Will is that active force which controlleth these
> relationships and these incidents. (Selections 207–8, 167.1)

interestingly, this same definition of fate and predestination, that is, “the
necessary and indispensable relationships which exist in the realities of
things,” is offered in his Tablet to dr. auguste henri forel as a definition
of nature, that is, “[n]ature . . . is but the essential properties and the nec-
essary relations inherent in the realities of things” (39). in this vein ‘abdu’l-
Bahá says: “[T]here are certain things to which man is forced and com-
pelled, such as sleep, death, sickness, decline of power, injuries and misfor-
tunes; these are not subject to the will of man, and he is not responsible for
them, for he is compelled to endure them. But in the choice of good and bad
actions he is free, and he commits them according to his own will” (Some
Answered Questions 248, 70:2). human beings are not as entirely free
regarding the material aspects of their lives, as they are in the sphere of
moral choices.

irrevoCaBle deCreeS and huMan innaTe

and inheriTed CharaCTer

if we consider all these theological and metaphysical statements with
respect to our daily lives, each of us could discover the irrevocable decrees
of God in our own lives and thus understand something about our “des-
tiny,” intended both as one’s “appointed lot or fortune” as well as “what in
the course of events will become or has become of a person” (Oxford
English Dictionary, s.v. “destiny”). We could include among the irrevocable
decrees of God, that is, among the components of one’s destiny, that which
‘abdu’l-Bahá defines as “the innate character” and “the inherited charac-
ter” (Some Answered Questions 212, 57:2).

as to the “innate character,” ‘abdu’l-Bahá himself defined it in a talk he
delivered in Paris on 14 february 1913, as “the natural or God given per-
sonality which the Western thinkers call individuality . . . the inner aspect
of man which is not subject to change . . . his God given natural virtues”
(“individuality and Personality” 38). The innate character or individuality
implies a “difference of degree; all are excellent, but they are more or less
so, according to the degree. So all mankind possess intelligence and capac-
ities [isti‘dád], but the intelligence, the capacity and the worthiness of men
differ” (Some Answered Questions 212, 57:3). as to the “inherited character,”
‘abdu’l-Bahá explains: “when the two parents are weak, the children will
be weak; if they are strong, the children will be robust. in the same way,
purity of blood has a great effect; for the pure germ is like the superior
stock which exists in plants and animals” (Some Answered Questions 213,
57:5).

evidently, no human being is given the possibility of consciously choos-
ing one’s “innate” or “inherited character.” They are part of the irrevoca-
ble decrees of God. as such, they fix a limit beyond which we cannot go,
while we struggle so that we may express all our potentialities during the
course of our lives. in other words, the Word of God has decreed for us, at
the time of our conception, a body with certain characteristics as well as a
spiritual entity, perfect in itself, with its own unique individuality.
Bahá’u’lláh seemingly hints at this concept when he writes: “The whole

Destiny and Freedom in the Bahá’í Writings                   9

duty of man in this day is to attain that share of the flood of grace which
God poureth forth for him. let none, therefore, consider the largeness or
smallness of the receptacle. The portion of some might lie in the palm of
a man’s hand, the portion of others might fill a cup, and of others even a
gallon-measure” (Gleanings 8, 5:4). on the one hand, Bahá’u’lláh recom-
mends that we make a mighty effort “to attain that share of the flood of
grace which God poureth forth for” us. on the other, he urges us to be
satisfied with what we are, without considering “the largeness or small-
ness of the receptacle.”

While it is not difficult to agree with the idea that a so-called normal
person should accept these irrevocable decrees as to a body and a soul one
has received with no possibility of choosing them, it is much more difficult
to extend this concept to persons who were less lucky by birth, for exam-
ple, people with congenital disabilities, or people affected by inborn imper-
fections received through their “inherited character” that can only be con-
trolled, but never wholly eliminated.

Bahá’u’lláh writes that “[t]he greatness of his mercy surpasseth the fury
of his wrath, and his grace encompasseth all who have been called into
being and been clothed with the robe of life, be they of the past or of the
future” (Súriy-i-Mulúk, in Summons 208, 5:54). ‘abdu’l-Bahá says that “in
the creation of God there is no evil” (Some Answered Questions 214, 57:10).
and Shoghi effendi has explained that “we must supplicate Bahá’u’lláh to
assist us to overcome the failings in our own characters, and also exert our
own will-power in mastering ourselves.”4 These words seem to assure us
that even the inborn defects received through our “inherited character” are
instruments which, if we “exert our own will-power in mastering our-
selves,” will help us to manifest the perfect gifts of our “God-given individ-
uality,” whose attributes, ‘abdu’l-Bahá says, are all “praiseworthy, because
they are divine in origin” (“individuality and Personality” 38). for each
soul sent into the world so that it may go through the physical experience
of life, even those that seem less lucky, our merciful Creator has prepared
in advance the best possible conditions for the manifestation of its God-
given gifts. as Bahá’u’lláh writes in his Persian hidden Words: “out of the
wastes of nothingness, with the clay of My command i made thee to

10            The Journal of Bahá’í Studies 20. 1/4. 2010

appear, and have ordained for thy training every atom in existence and the
essence of all created things. . . . out of My loving-kindness, ’neath the
shade of My mercy i nurtured thee, and guarded thee by the essence of My
grace and favor. and My purpose in all this was that thou mightest attain
My everlasting dominion and become worthy of My invisible bestowals”
(no. 29).

irrevoCaBle deCreeS and huMan aCQuired CharaCTer

‘abdu’l-Bahá observes that “the acquired character . . . is gained by educa-
tion” (Some Answered Questions 212, 57:2). and he adds that “the difference
of the qualities with regard to culture is very great, for education has
great influence” (Some Answered Questions 214, 57:8). elsewhere he
emphasizes the great influence exerted by an early education: “it is
extremely difficult to teach the individual and refine his character once
puberty is passed. By then, as experience hath shown, even if every effort
be exerted to modify some tendency of his, it all availeth nothing. he may,
perhaps, improve somewhat today; but let a few days pass and he forget-
teth, and turneth backward to his habitual condition and accustomed
ways“ (Selections 144–45, sec. 111.7).

Therefore also some aspects of the “acquired character which is gained
by education” (‘abdu’l-Bahá, Some Answered Questions 212, 57:2) can be a
consequence of the irrevocable decrees of God. in this specific case, those
decrees may have brought about facts and events which are beyond the
reach of one’s personal free choice, because they occurred in an age when
the capacity of one’s free choice is still limited by the inevitable immaturi-
ty of childhood. They can be part of the destiny of a person.

in this respect, we can make the best use of our freedom if we accept to
struggle against inborn, inherited, or acquired limits, as insurmountable
as they may seem. in fact we know that a perfect understanding of those
limits is beyond the reach of our minds. Therefore, since the Bahá’í teach-
ings always urge us to act and encourage us “to attain distinction and
excellence in all [our] undertakings” (universal house of Justice, Messages
509, 303:1), it is better for us to aim for the highest goals. however, while

making our utmost effort, we should also be ready to accept “with radiant
acquiescence” the possibility of being defeated because in any case the
effort we will exert, if it is sincere and pure, will help us to become better
creatures, even when the immediate goal has not been achieved.

TWo kindS of divine deCreeS

Bahá’u’lláh also mentions the “decree that is impending” which “is such
that prayer and entreaty can succeed in averting it” (Gleanings 133, 68:3).
and he adds: “God grant that thou who art the fruit of My Tree, and they
that are associated with thee, may be shielded from its evil consequences”
(Gleanings 133, 68:4). The specific context of this letter explains this state-
ment, that we should also bow to the “decree that is impending.” if a moth-
er has to accept the death of a son with radiant acquiescence, she must
have achieved an attitude of complete surrender to the will of God.
Bahá’u’lláh explains this concept in greater detail:

> look at a lighted lamp. its irrevocable decree is that the oil will finish
> and the wick will be consumed. as long as they endure, the lamp will
> be lighted and give light. But when they are consumed, the light will
> be unavoidably extinguished. . . . and in this condition there is nei-
> ther change nor transformation. This event cannot be either antici-
> pated or postponed by an instant . . . and the lamp is subject to this
> necessity unless the contingent decrees put in the essence of the
> earthly world by the Might of the Merciful do not extinguish or
> destroy it beforehand. and these decrees are manifest in all things,
> because the all-inclusive Might of God never ceases. . . . for example
> . . . sometimes it happens that a wind blows on a lamp, before it has
> come to its end, or that the lamp is extinguished and quenched
> through other causes of the created world.5

‘abdu’l-Bahá offers the same explanation in a different perspective:
“[C]onditional fate [qad.áy-i-mashrút. ] may be likened to this: while there is
still oil, a violent wind blows on the lamp, which extinguishes it. This is a

12             The Journal of Bahá’í Studies 20. 1/4. 2010

conditional fate. it is wise to avoid it, to protect oneself from it, to be cau-
tious and circumspect. But the decreed fate [qad.áy-i-mah.túm], which is like
the finishing of the oil in the lamp, cannot be altered, changed nor delayed
(Some Answered Questions 244, 68:3). Whereas Bahá’u’lláh emphasizes the
necessity of accepting the impending decree, ‘abdu’l-Bahá says: “it is wise
to avoid it, to protect oneself from it, to be cautious and circumspect.”

These words are reminiscent of an explanation on tests and difficulties
offered by ‘abdu’l-Bahá himself in a Tablet: “know thou that ordeals are
of two kinds: one kind is for trial (to test the soul) and the other is pun-
ishment for actions. ‘as a man soweth so shall he also reap.’ That which is
for testing is educational and developmental and that which is the punish-
ment of deeds is severe retribution” (“Tablet to Portland,” in rabb 235).
The ordeals “for trial” seem a consequence of the irrevocable decrees of
God and, as such, they should be accepted with radiant acquiescence.
‘abdu’l-Bahá explains in one of his Paris talks: “Tests are benefits from
God, for which we should thank him. Grief and sorrow do not come to us
by chance, they are sent to us by the divine Mercy for our own perfect-
ing” (Paris Talks 42, 14:7). They enable us at least to demonstrate our love
of God through the radiant acquiescence with which we accept them. The
ordeals for “punishment” may be the consequence of actions one has per-
formed exerting one’s willpower. They can be avoided through wiser
behavior. But once a mistake has been made, the best protection against its
painful consequence is to make an effort to acquire those spiritual quali-
ties that will assist us to overcome our ordeals and proceed towards fur-
ther goals of our lives. ‘abdu’l-Bahá explains in this regard:

> Tests are a means by which a soul is measured as to its fitness, and
> proven out by its own acts. God knows its fitness beforehand, and also
> his unpreparedness, but man, with an ego, would not believe himself
> unfit unless proof were given him. Consequently his susceptibility to
> evil is proven to him when he falls into the tests, and the tests are con-
> tinued until the soul realizes its own unfitness, then remorse and
> regret tend to root out the weakness. The same test comes again in
greater degree, until it is shown that a former weakness has become

> a strength, and the power to overcome evil has been established.

(Qtd. in “Worst enemies” 45)

When a mistake implies a transgression, the remedy is sincere repen-
tance, as Bahá’u’lláh advises: “[r]eturn ye to God and repent, that he,
through his grace, may have mercy upon you, may wash away your sins,
and forgive your trespasses” (Súriy-i-Mulúk, in Summons 207–8, 5:54).
however repentance as suggested in the Bahá’í Writings does not imply
useless mortifications. as Bahá’u’lláh writes: “God . . . wisheth not the
humiliation of his servants” (Bishárát, in Tablets 24).

The Bahá’í Writings emphasize the meaning and the value of human
sufferings. Bahá’u’lláh writes: “But for the tribulations which are sustained
in Thy path, how could Thy true lovers be recognized; and were it not for
the trials which are borne for love of Thee, how could the station of such
as yearn for Thee be revealed?” (Prayers and Meditations 155, 92:1).
however, he also writes: “at no time have i been able to reconcile Myself
to the afflictions befalling My loved ones, or to any trouble that could
becloud the joy of their hearts” (Gleanings 308, 142:1). The Bahá’í faith
does not approve that attitude, sometimes termed dolorism, whereby some
religious communities encourage physical or psychological self-mortifica-
tion. it recommends not to compromise with one’s allegiance to God to
avoid pain, but it also teaches not to impose useless, supposedly expiatory,
sufferings on oneself. in this vein Bahá’u’lláh wrote to two believers who
had decided “to observe maximum austerity in their lives” with a view to
contribute more money to the funds of the faith: “let them act with mod-
eration and not impose hardship upon themselves. We would like them
both to enjoy a life that is well-pleasing” (qtd. in Compilation 1:508, sec.
1155). in this sense George Townshend (1876–1957) writes: “happiness is
our birth-right: it is ours to take, to hold, to possess in perpetuity” (88).

The freedoM of huMan deedS

in summary, Bahá’u’lláh teaches that human life is ruled by “God’s
inscrutable decree” (Gleanings 315, 145:1). Sometimes God’s decrees are

14            The Journal of Bahá’í Studies 20. 1/4. 2010

irrevocable; sometimes they are revocable. in any case it is better for us to
accept them with “radiant acquiescence.” Some of the revocable decrees of
God seem “subject to change through the effect of means and actions.”6 it
is better for us to be “cautious and circumspect” and wise, in our efforts to
modify those decrees according to our wishes, if we want to avoid our own
actions having painful consequences.

We may ask: in this vision of a life totally ruled by the decrees of God,
how do the Bahá’í Writings explain the dynamics of our free action? a
Tablet by Bahá’u’lláh, as well as two talks and a Tablet by ‘abdu’l-Bahá
are particularly relevant. Bahá’u’lláh writes: “[M]an should know his own
self and recognize that which leadeth unto loftiness or lowliness, glory or
abasement, wealth or poverty. having attained the stage of fulfilment and
reached his maturity, man standeth in need of wealth, and such wealth as
he acquireth through crafts or professions is commendable and praisewor-
thy in the estimation of men of wisdom, and especially in the eyes of ser-
vants who dedicate themselves to the education of the world and to the
edification of its peoples“ (T.arázát, in Tablets 34–35).

These words seem to mention three elements relevant to action. The
first element is knowing oneself, which we can understand in this context
as knowing one’s innate, hereditary, and acquired character. undoubtedly,
this knowledge assists us both in better understanding the latitude of our
freedom of action and in better focusing our efforts. The second element
is knowing “that which leadeth unto loftiness or lowliness, glory or abase-
ment, wealth or poverty,” that is, having a balance that may help us to dis-
cern good from evil, to distinguish right from wrong, justice from injus-
tice. The best balance is the Book of God, “the unerring Balance estab-
lished amongst men,” in which “whatsoever the peoples and kindreds of
the earth possess must be weighed, while the measure of its weight should
be tested according to its own standard. . . .” (Bahá’u’lláh, Kitáb-i-Aqdas
56, par. 99). The Book of God is the repository of teachings through
which “every man will advance and develop until he attaineth the station
at which he can manifest all the potential forces with which his inmost
true self hath been endowed” (Bahá’u’lláh, Gleanings 68, 27:5). The second
element is, therefore, knowing the divine Teachings, through studying

Scripture and applying them to one’s daily life. The third element is
acquiring the money required for our daily living “through crafts or pro-
fessions,” that is, immersing ourselves in our daily lives, because life itself
can teach us how to act, through our successes and failures.

in a talk he delivered on the 30th of May 1912 at the Theosophical
lodge of new york, ‘abdu’l-Bahá said: “The attainment of any object is
conditioned upon knowledge, volition and action. unless these three con-
ditions are forthcoming, there is no execution or accomplishment”
(Promulgation 157). in the same vein he wrote in a Tablet to a believer in
new Zealand (Tablets 3:691): “[e]very great Cause in this world of exis-
tence findeth visible expression through three means: first, intention; sec-
ond, confirmation; third, action. . . . [any] intention needeth a dynamic
power, so that it may become manifest in the world of being[, that is,] the
confirmations of the kingdom. . . . [T]he intention, the power and the
action, all three [should be] brought together (qtd. in Compilation 2:164,
sec. 1585). in an interview he gave to the Weekly Budget on 23 September
1911, through the early american Bahá’í isabel Chamberlain fraser
(1871–1939), he said moreover: “The afflictions which come to humanity
sometimes tend to centre the consciousness upon the limitations, and this
is a veritable prison. release comes by making of the will a door through
which the confirmations of the Spirit come“ (‘Abdu’l-Bahá in London 120).

We understand that human actions require four fundamental elements.

first, knowledge, that is, knowing both oneself and the circumstances in
which one should act. We are able to achieve this knowledge because God
has bestowed upon us the power of understanding, the “[f]irst and fore-
most among [the] favors . . . which the almighty hath conferred upon
man” (Bahá’u’lláh, Gleanings 194, 95:1). This power “giveth man the power
to discern the truth in all things, leadeth him to that which is right, and
helpeth him to discover the secrets of creation.” This power enables us to
understand and seize the opportunities of learning that life constantly
gives us. The most important of these opportunities is that of recognizing
his Manifestation, Who shows the way we should tread in order to fulfill
the purpose of our lives. Second, intention or volition, that is, choosing a
goal to pursue in one’s known circumstances. Third, confirmation, that is,

16             The Journal of Bahá’í Studies 20. 1/4. 2010

the required power for our goal to be achieved. fourth, action itself. of
these four elements, knowledge, volition, and action depend on the actor.
But the confirmations, as necessary as they are for actions to give a result,
are totally independent. Therefore the results of our actions do not seem
to be entirely in our hands. They depend on having made “of the will a
door through which the confirmations of the Spirit come.” Without God’s
confirmations we cannot achieve anything.

‘abdu’l-Bahá explains that the confirmations of the Spirit are “all those
powers and gifts which some are born with (and which men sometimes
call genius), but for which others have to strive with infinite pains. They
come to that man or woman who accepts his life with radiant acquies-
cence“ (‘Abdu’l-Bahá in London 121). in his Tablets of the Divine Plan he
also writes that the confirmations of the Spirit are “the rain of the boun-
ties of God . . . and the heat of the Sun of reality” (64, 9:8). in the ancient
Scripture they were described as “angels” (‘abdu’l-Bahá, Selections 86, sec.
39\.3; 174, sec. 142.5); in ‘abdu’l-Bahá’s Writings as “the heavenly
cohorts” (Tablets of the Divine Plan 28, 5:2) and “the Supreme Concourse”
(Tablets of the Divine Plan 51, 8:8). he explains that they “change a gnat
into an eagle, a drop of water into rivers and seas, and an atom into
lights and suns” (Tablets of the Divine Plan 73,10:13 ); make “the weak
strong, the lowly mighty, the child grown, the infant mature and the
small great” (Tablets 2:274); “dilate . . . [human] breasts through the fra-
grances of joy and happiness” (Tablets 2:367); bestow “the utmost elo-
quence, fluency, ability and skill in teaching” (Tablets 2:243); give the
power to “withstand all who inhabit the earth” (Tablets 2:460) and to
“quicken the souls” (Tablets 3:674). Through those confirmations
“tongues . . . become fluent . . . hearts like clear mirrors flooded with the
rays of the Sun of Truth . . . thoughts expanded . . . comprehension more
vivid and . . . [human beings] progress in the plane of human perfections”
(Promulgation 458). God bestows his confirmations as he pleases.
however, ‘abdu’l-Bahá repeatedly explains what one can do to create
such conditions which, like a “magnet,” draw “down the confirmations of
God” (Selections 89, sec. 41.2).

PrereQuiSiTeS To oBTain The divine ConfirMaTionS

‘abdu’l-Bahá writes that to obtain the divine confirmations “capacity,
worth (or merit) and ability, are necessary, for the clearer and purer the
mirror is, the lights of the Sun are more manifest thereon” (Tablets 2:444).
as to capacity, he says in his previously mentioned talk at the Theo-
sophical lodge of new york that the bounty of God, that is, his confirma-
tion, “is moving, circulating and becomes effective wherever capacity is
developed to receive it. in every station there is a specialized capacity”
(Promulgation 160). he explains in a Tablet: “The decree [qadar] is the
capacity [isti‘dád], the worthiness and the measure of things, because the
meaning of the decree is the dimension and the divine decrees [qad.áyáy-i-
ilahí], that is, the divine wisdoms that are in the realities of things, are
manifested according to the dimension [qadr] and the measure of things.”7
in other words, capacity depends in part on the decrees of God, that is, on
destiny. however he also says that “capacity is of two kinds: natural
capacity and acquired capacity. The first, which is the creation of God, is
purely good . . . but the acquired capacity has become the cause of the
appearance of evil. for example . . . man begins little by little to accustom
himself to poison by taking a small quantity each day, and gradually
increasing it, until he reaches such a point that he cannot live without a
gram of opium every day” (Some Answered Questions 214, 57:10).

Therefore, we must avoid allowing the capacities that God has bestowed
upon our God-given individuality to become polluted with the defects we
may acquire during our lives. We should rather make sure that our “indi-
vidualities,” that is, our “God given natural virtues,” may be “adorned with
acquired virtues and perfections” (“individuality and Personality” 38). in
other words, we should try to develop a good character. While so doing,
we will become worthy of the descent of the divine confirmations and
capable of expressing them through our actions.

on the contrary, quite often human beings who, as children, are all
“mirrors upon which no dust has fallen” (‘abdu’l-Bahá, Promulgation 53),
do not use their “strength” and their “great power of reason and under-
standing” to acquire virtues. and they let the dust of their selves dim the

18            The Journal of Bahá’í Studies 20. 1/4. 2010

mirror of their souls, spoiling their inborn character. ‘abdu’l-Bahá writes
in this regard: “in this glorious age the divine confirmations are like unto
the rays of the sun. The hearts and souls are like unto the surface of crys-
tal. The clearer the crystal the greater the refulgence of the sunlight”
(Tablets 3:698).

Shoghi effendi has explained what we can do to improve our character:
“The power of God can entirely transmute our characters and make of us
beings entirely unlike our previous selves. Through prayer and supplica-
tion, obedience to the divine laws Bahá’u’lláh has revealed, and ever-
increasing service to his faith, we can change ourselves.”8 Shoghi effendi
mentions four ways to improve our character. The first way is a gratuitous
gift of God. The other three are prayer and supplication, obedience to the
divine laws, and service to his faith.

as to prayer and supplication, if we want to clean the dimmed mirrors
of our souls and acquire other praiseworthy capacities, the first step we
should take is to use our willpower to turn our spirits towards our
Creator. ‘abdu’l-Bahá explains: “God is the Supreme Center. The more we
turn toward this Center of light [markaz-i-anvár], the greater will be our
capacity [fuyúd. át-i-ilahíyyih, lit. divine bounties]” (Promulgation 15).
‘abdu’l-Bahá writes about prayer: “The state of prayer is the best of con-
ditions, for man is then associating with God” (Selections 211, sec. 172). he
counsels: “Beseech thou from God’s infinite grace whatsoever thou
desirest. But wert thou to heed my advice thou wouldst desire naught save
entrance into the abhá kingdom, and seek naught save the bounties of the
Beauty of the all-Glorious. . . . ” (qtd. in Compilation 2:231, sec. 1741). and
Shoghi effendi explains: “The true worshipper, while praying, should
endeavour not so much to ask God to fulfil his wishes and desires, but
rather to adjust these and make them conform to the divine Will. only
through such an attitude can one derive that feeling of inner peace and
contentment which the power of prayer alone can confer.”9 Therefore, the
highest aspiration of prayer is the reunion with God that in Bahá’í lan-
guage is the spiritual encounter with his Manifestation on earth, and sub-
mission to his Will.
as to obedience, it is the consequence of one’s recognition of God’s

Manifestation, as stated in the first verse of the kitáb-i-aqdas. The first
expression of one’s “obedience to the divine laws Bahá’u’lláh has revealed”
is one’s steadfastness in the Covenant. ‘abdu’l-Bahá writes that the
Covenant is “the magnet of confirmation and assistance, the attracter of all
success and the leader of hosts of gifts” (Tablets 1:172). he writes in this
regard: “in the beginning the believers must make their steps firm in the
Covenant so that the confirmations of Bahá’u’lláh may encircle them from
all sides, the cohorts of the Supreme Concourse may become their sup-
porters and helpers” (Tablets of the Divine Plan 52, 8:8).

Steadfastness in the Covenant implies, in the first place, a mental recog-
nition of Bahá’u’lláh’s “essential infallibility” (‘abdu’l-Bahá, Some Answered
Questions 171, 45:2), of the “acquired” or “conferred infallibility” (173,
45:4) of ‘abdu’l-Bahá, of Shoghi effendi as well as of the “body of the
house of Justice,” which is “under the protection and unerring guidance
of God” (173, 45:4). immediately after, it implies a prompt obedience to
their guidance. To obey them means to orient the sails of the vessel of
one’s soul in the direction from which the wind of the Spirit blows and
thus to impart the immense energy of the divine confirmations to that
vessel and obtain an extraordinary capacity of progress. ‘abdu’l-Bahá
writes in this regard: “if in this day a soul shall act according to the pre-
cepts and the counsels of God, he will serve as a divine physician to
mankind, and like the trump of isráfíl, he will call the dead of this contin-
gent world to life; for the confirmations of the abhá realm are never
interrupted, and such a virtuous soul hath, to befriend him, the unfailing
help of the Company on high” (Selections 26, sec. 8.4). Since this guidance
is a tangible expression of the Will of God, to follow it means to conform
one’s will to the divine Will and, while so doing, to accept its irrevocable
and revocable decrees, according to Bahá’u’lláh’s counsel. finally, stead-
fastness in the Covenant creates unity, and ‘abdu’l-Bahá says: “you may
rest assured that whenever you are united, the confirmations of the
kingdom of abhá will reach you, the heavenly favors will descend, the
bounties of God will be bestowed, the Sun of reality will shine, the cloud
of mercy will pour its showers, and the breeze of divine generosity will
waft its fragrances upon you” (Promulgation 428).

20            The Journal of Bahá’í Studies 20. 1/4. 2010

as to service to his faith, ‘abdu’l-Bahá writes: “faith is the magnet
which draws the confirmation of the Merciful one. Service is the magnet
which attracts the heavenly strength. i hope thou wilt attain both” (Tablets
1:62). These words take on a more pregnant meaning in the light of a def-
inition of faith given by ‘abdu’l-Bahá: “By the faith is meant, first, con-
scious knowledge [dánistan], and second, the practice of good deeds [‘amal-
i-khayr]” (Tablets 3:549). Service and faith are inextricably bound to one
another and together attract the divine confirmations. and Shoghi effendi
says: “as we give to God, as we serve him and love him, so will he vouch-
safe to us his Mercy, Guidance and Protection.”10

among the many forms of service, teaching, that is, carrying “the mes-
sage of Bahá’u’lláh to every stratum of human society and every walk of
life” (The universal house of Justice, “extracts” 118, 52:2), occupies a pre-
eminent position. ‘abdu’l-Bahá writes that teaching “is the magnetic
power which attracts the confirmation of God” (Tablets 3:625).

another laudable form of service is for a human being to “vie with his
fellows in service to the good of all” (‘abdu’l-Bahá, Secret 113). ‘abdu’l-
Bahá says in this regard: “Today the confirmations of the kingdom of
abhá are with those who renounce themselves, forget their own opinions,
cast aside personalities and are thinking of the welfare of others” (qtd. in
Waite, “Supplication and Service” 348).

Service implies an inner attitude indispensable to receiving the divine
confirmations: detachment. ‘abdu’l-Bahá writes in this regard: “Separate
thyself from all thoughts, strip thyself from the unclean garment of
attachment to this drossful (or earthly) world, arise for the service of thy
lord, the Clement, and be clothed with the robe of assurance (or certain-
ty) so that thou mayest behold the hosts of confirmation from thy lord
arising from all sides“ (Tablets 3:650).

The highest expression of detachment is detachment from oneself or
evanescence, about which ‘abdu’l-Bahá writes:

> [Man] must become evanescent in God. Must forget his own selfish
> conditions that he may thus arise to the station of sacrifice. it should
be to such a degree that if he sleep, it should not be for pleasure, but

> to rest the body in order to do better, to speak better, to explain more
> beautifully, to serve the servants of God and to prove the truths.
> When he remains awake, he should seek to be attentive, serve the
> Cause of God and sacrifice his own stations for those of God. When
> he attains to this station, the confirmations of the holy Spirit will
> surely reach him, and man with this power can withstand all who
> inhabit the earth. (Tablets 2:460)

in this sense the Bahá’í international Community writes: “one of the
paradoxes of human life is that development of the self comes primarily
through commitment to larger undertakings in which the self—even if
only temporarily—is forgotten” (265–66).

The iMPorTanCe of endeavor and diSCiPline

Pursuing these prerequisites to obtain the divine confirmations requires
a great endeavor by human beings. Bahá’u’lláh writes: “Success or failure,
gain or loss, must . . . depend upon man’s own exertions. The more he
striveth, the greater will be his progress” (Gleanings 81–82, 34:8). he
writes moreover: “endeavor [jahd] is required, albeit God doeth as he wil-
leth and ordaineth as he pleaseth.”11 ‘abdu’l-Bahá explains: “[i]ndolence
and laxity hinder the outpourings of love from the clouds of divine mercy,
and people will thus remain deprived” (qtd. in “importance of obligatory
Prayer” 2:4). he also says: “effort, the utmost effort, is required” (Tablets
of the Divine Plan 27–28, 5:2). and in one of his Paris talks conveyed
through isabel fraser he says: “Capacity is in accordance with striving
and sincerity” (Divine Philosophy 114). finally, Shoghi effendi says on the
importance of perseverance in one’s endeavors: “even if the action should
not immediately produce results, or perhaps not be entirely correct, that
does not make so much difference . . . if someone’s action is wrong, God
can use that method of showing the pathway which is right.”12 This is
reminiscent of the importance of discipline in human life, a quality to be
pursued from early childhood. as Shoghi effendi writes: “discipline of
some sort, whether physical, moral or intellectual, is indeed indispensable,

22             The Journal of Bahá’í Studies 20. 1/4. 2010

and no training can be said to be complete and fruitful if it disregards this
element.”13 in a way, the Bahá’í teachings on endeavor and discipline seem
not dissimilar from the idea expressed by Mawláná Jalálu’d-dín rúmí
(1207–1273) when he said: “endeavour is not a struggle with destiny
[qad.á]” (1:55). it rather is a struggle to fulfill one’s destiny.

TruST in God and hiS Good-PleaSure

The idea that whatever happens is written in the divine decrees, that each
of us has a prearranged individuality beyond which one will never be able
to go, that even a number of the defects acquired in this world can be pre-
destined and insurmountable, could in a way discourage human efforts. a
first consideration is that the divine decrees are inscrutable, that our indi-
viduality may be not so well known, that the possibility for a miracle to
remove a flaw we perceive as unacceptable and insurmountable is real—
albeit remote—that our actions can influence the “impending decree,”
although we do not know whether this influence will be for our immedi-
ate good or not. This “ignorance” of us as human beings, which some of
us may perceive as an unpleasant limitation, can thus be a real blessing in
disguise. as Bahá’u’lláh writes in his Persian hidden Words: “didst thou
behold immortal sovereignty, thou wouldst strive to pass from this fleet-
ing world. But to conceal the one from thee and to reveal the other is a
mystery which none but the pure in heart can comprehend” (no. 41). This
is why the first quality that assists us is trust in God. as ‘abdu’l-Bahá
writes: “Trust in the grace of thy lord. he shall surely assist thee with a
confirmation whereat minds will be amazed and the thoughts of the men
of learning will be astonished” (Tablets 2:285).

The Bahá’í Writings abound in counsels and admonishments that
encourage us to acquire this vital attitude of trust, submission, and sur-
render to the divine Will, as we struggle to obtain God’s confirmations,
which geniuses achieve without any effort and ordinary human beings
must conquer with infinite toils and pains. for example, ‘abdu’l-Bahá
writes: “[l] ook thou not at the degree of thy capacity [isti‘dád], look thou
at the boundless favour of Bahá’u’lláh. . . .” (Selections 188, 153.3). he also

writes: “do not consider thy capacity and merit, but rely upon the infinite
bounty and trust to his highness the almighty. do not delay. undertake
soon that which thou art intending” (Tablets 3:564–65).

This attitude helps us to win the indispensable good-pleasure of God,
that is, “Paradise” (Súriy-i-vafá’, in Tablets 189) and, with that, his confir-
mations. as Bahá’u’lláh writes in this regard: “Were anyone to wash the
feet of all mankind, and were he to worship God in the forests, valleys, and
mountains, upon high hills and lofty peaks, to leave no rock or tree, no
clod of earth, but was a witness to his worship—yet, should the fragrance
of My good pleasure [rid.á’í] not be inhaled from him, his works would
never be acceptable unto God” (Kitáb-i-Aqdas 31, par. 36).

The True Joie de vivre

Trust in God and the attainment of his good-pleasure are always accom-
panied by another inner attitude that is very important to win the divine
confirmations, the true joie de vivre. Bahá’u’lláh mentions repeatedly this
joy: “obey . . . [the laws of God] with joy and gladness, for this is best for
you, did ye but know” (Kitab-i-Aqdas 73, par. 148); “rejoice in the gladness
of thine heart, that thou mayest be worthy to meet Me and to mirror forth
My beauty” (arabic hidden Words, no. 36); “it behoveth them that are
endued with insight and understanding to observe that which will cause
joy and radiance” (kalimát-i-firdawsíyyih, in Tablets 71). ‘abdu’l-Bahá
explains in one of his Paris talks:

Joy gives us wings! in times of joy our strength is more vital, our
> intellect keener, and our understanding less clouded. We seem better
> able to cope with the world and to find our sphere of usefulness. But
> when sadness visits us we become weak, our strength leaves us, our
> comprehension is dim and our intelligence veiled. The actualities of
> life seem to elude our grasp, the eyes of our spirits fail to discover the
> sacred mysteries, and we become even as dead beings. (Paris Talks
> 109–10, 35:2)
24            The Journal of Bahá’í Studies 20. 1/4. 2010

if we surrender to dismay, we lose our capacity to understand the wisdom
of the divine decrees, which are among “the sacred mysteries,” and thus we
also lose his confirmations. Therefore he advises: “When our thoughts
are filled with the bitterness of this world, let us turn our eyes to the
sweetness of God’s compassion and he will send us heavenly calm! if we
are imprisoned in the material world, our spirit can soar into the heavens
and we shall be free indeed!” (Paris Talks 111, 35:810).

WhiCh freedoM?

What is then our freedom? The relevant definitions of the dictionaries
read as follows: “The condition of being able to act in any desired way
without hindrance or restraint; faculty or power to do as one likes” (Oxford
English Dictionary, s.v. “liberty”); “The quality of being free from the con-
trol of fate or necessity; the power of self-determination attributed to the
will” (Oxford English Dictionary, s.v. “freedom”). a number of passages in
the Bahá’í Writings seem to deny this kind of freedom. for example,
Bahá’u’lláh writes: “[i]n one sense whatever happens is and will always be
irrevocable. . . its execution itself is a proof of its own inevitability.”14
“[T]he mesh of divine destiny exceedeth the vastest of mortal conceptions,
and the dart of his decree [taqdír] transcendeth the boldest of human
designs. none can escape the snares he setteth, and no soul can find
release except through submission [rid. a] to his will” [iradih-ash] (Kitáb-i-
Íqán 251, par. 278). and ‘abdu’l-Bahá says in one of his talks conveyed
through isabel fraser: “nothing has been created without a special des-
tiny, for every creature has an innate station of attainment. This flower has
been created to mirror forth a harmonious ensemble of color and perfume.
each kingdom of nature holds potentialities and each must be cultivated
in order to reach its fulfillment” (Divine Philosophy 105–6). Bahá’u’lláh
goes as far as writing: “We exalt whomsoever We please unto the realm
of supernal might and glory, and, should We so desire, cause the same to
sink into the lowest abyss of degradation” (Súriy-i-haykal, in Summons 36,
1:68)—words seemingly suggesting concepts similar to those expounded
by augustine of hippo (ad 354–430) in his On the Predestination of the

Saints: “God chose us in Christ before the foundation of the world, predes-
tinating us to the adoption of children, not because we were going to be
of ourselves holy and immaculate, but he chose and predestinated us that
we might be so” (1:37). almost everything seems already written, even
our ultramundane destiny. however, Bahá’u’lláh solves our perplexities
explaining the meaning and limits of our destiny and of our freedom.

in the first place, he explains: “This fore-knowledge of God . . . should
not be regarded as having caused the actions of men, just as your own pre-
vious knowledge that a certain event is to occur, or your desire that it
should happen, is not and can never be the reason for its occurrence”
(Gleanings 150, 77:1). and since these words may seem unclear, ‘abdu’l-
Bahá has commented upon them in his Some Answered Questions. in a
philosophical perspective, he explains: “[T]he essential knowledge of God
surrounds . . . the realities of things, before as well as after their existence,
and it does not become the cause of their existence. it is a perfection of
God. . . . [T]he knowledge of God in the realm of contingency does not
produce the forms of the things. on the contrary, it is purified from the
past, present and future. it is identical with the reality of the things; it is
not the cause of their occurrence” (138–39 35:2–4).

God, Whose Word has set in motion the process of creation and has
infused it with his ordaining Command, Whose Manifestation bestows
upon humankind a religion that expresses “the essential connection
which proceeds from the realities of things” (‘abdu’l-Bahá, Some Answered
Questions 158, 40:7), that is, both the nature and the destiny of human
beings, knows the essence of his own creation and therefore he also per-
fectly knows its evolution, because in his timeless perspective the begin-
ning and the end coincide. ‘abdu’l-Bahá explains this concept through
some examples: “[T]onight everyone knows that after seven hours the sun
will rise, but this general foreknowledge does not cause the rising and
appearance of the sun. . . . The mathematicians by astronomical calcula-
tions know that at a certain time an eclipse of the moon or the sun will
occur. Surely this discovery does not cause the eclipse to take place”
(Some Answered Questions 138–39, 35:3–6).

however, these explanations do not clarify the boundaries of our freedom,
26            The Journal of Bahá’í Studies 20. 1/4. 2010

specifically those of our “power of self-determination attributed to the
will.” ‘abdu’l-Bahá clarifies in this regard that “the conditions of existence
are limited to the conditions of servitude, of prophethood and of deity”
(Some Answered Questions 230, 62:1). We as human beings belong to the
condition of “servitude.” he elucidates the meaning of our condition:
“Man is absolutely helpless and dependent, since might and power belong
especially to God. Both exaltation and humiliation depend upon the good
pleasure and the will of the Most high” (248–49, 70:4). and in his state-
ment he goes as far as saying: “also the inaction or the movement of man
depend upon the assistance of God [tá’yíd-i-Yazdán]. if he is not aided, he
is not able to do either good or evil. But when the help of existence comes
from the Generous lord, he is able to do both good and evil; but if the help
is cut off, he remains absolutely helpless” (249, 70:6).

We are like “a ship which is moved by the power of the wind or steam;
if this power ceases, the ship cannot move at all” (‘abdu’l-Bahá, Some
Answered Questions 249.). it is at this point that he gives the key to under-
stand the limits of our freedom: “[T]he rudder of the ship turns it to either
side, and the power of the steam moves it in the desired direction.” We
have not the power to move the ship. But we have the rudder in our hands
to turn it to either side. Thus we are free in “the choice of good or evil.”

referring these concepts to our personal lives, we can carry out the
decrees of God, or try to modify them, roughly in two ways, with many
different shades in between. We can remain focused on our selves, closed
in a narrow universe, whose little sun is our ego, under the illusion that
we are pursuing and achieving victories that we have won unaided. in this
case, if we fail, we will feel wretched and depressed. if we succeed, we will
feel proud. Perhaps a few of us may have contributed “to carry forward an
ever-advancing civilization” (Bahá’u’lláh, lawh.-i-kamál, in Gleanings 215,
109:2). however, we will have no spiritual merit, because in reality we
were not working for the common good, but only for our personal glori-
fication. and, as the Báb has reportedly said, “The time is come when
naught but the purest motive, supported by deeds of stainless purity, can
ascend to the throne of the Most high and be acceptable unto him” (qtd.
in nabíl, Dawn-Breakers 93). if we act in such a way, as happy or unhappy

as we are, depending on the material conditions surrounding us, our souls,
sent to this world to discover in themselves the divine virtues, that is, the
traces of God that make them creatures made in God’s image and after his
likeness, will not discover their true identity. Their God-given individual-
ity will not be strengthened through the acquisition of other virtues, but
will be dimmed by “the obscuring dust of all acquired knowledge”
(Bahá’u’lláh, Kitáb-i-Íqán 192, par. 213). We will not fulfill the purpose of
our lives, to know and to worship our Creator. Bahá’u’lláh writes that this
is the depths of human misfortune, this is “true loss”: spending one’s days
“in utter ignorance of . . . [one’s] self ” (as.l-i-kullu’l-khayr, in Tablets 156)
and withholding from oneself “the grace of God and his mercy” (lawh.-i-
ashraf, in Gleanings 104, 52:1).

on the contrary, we can carry out the divine decrees, or try to modify
them, with the conscious intention of making the will of God in our lives
and on earth. in other words, we can hearken to the following words of
the kitáb-i-aqdas: “hold ye fast unto his statutes and commandments,
and be not of those who, following their idle fancies and vain imaginings,
have clung to the standards fixed by their own selves, and cast behind
their backs the standards laid down by God” (Bahá’u’lláh, Kitab-i-Aqdas
25, par. 17). While so doing, we will pursue the knowledge and the love of
God as well as the promotion of civilization. our God-given individuali-
ties will emerge in full light; nay, they will be enriched through praisewor-
thy capacities and virtues acquired in the course of our lives. our lives will
be characterized by a feeling of serenity that cannot be disturbed either by
the ephemeral joys of “prosperity” or the fleeting afflictions of “abase-
ment,” in the awareness that “both shall pass away and be no more”
(Bahá’u’lláh, arabic hidden Words, no. 52).

While explaining “the mysteries of divine decree and destiny”
Bahá’u’lláh writes in his S.ah.ífiy-i-Shat.t.íyyih:

> each thing moveth or reposeth in its proper place. But if something
> contrary to this natural flow of events is manifested, the order of the
> world becometh gravely disrupted. . . . it is for this reason that, in
> every age and century, as he desireth, the unique hidden one and
28             The Journal of Bahá’í Studies 20. 1/4. 2010

> the eternal essence manifesteth that true river and real Sea and
> causeth it to flow, adorning it with a new temple and a new vesture.
> all those structures of vain imaginings and palaces of the ungodly are
> then swept away and destroyed in its waters. With utmost desire and
> thirst they drown and perish, lacking even the faintest awareness that
> they could quaff a draught thereof. Thus doth God bestow life upon
> whom he willeth, and taketh it away from whom he willeth, and con-
> firmeth whom he pleaseth, and denieth whom he pleaseth, could ye
> but perceive it. (59)

Whenever “the order of the world” is “gravely disrupted,” God graciously
reveals his decrees to humankind through his Manifestations, so that
human beings may do their utmost to carry them out in the world and
restore the order of the world. But even if human beings do not hearken to
his summons, his decrees will nevertheless be enforced, because God has a
“Major Plan” of his own, and uses “both the mighty and lowly as pawns in
his world-shaping game, for the fulfillment of his immediate purpose and
the eventual establishment of his kingdom on earth” (Shoghi effendi,
Citadel 139). Whenever God reveals his decrees to humankind through his
Manifestation, initially most human beings arise in opposition and rebel-
lion. only a few of them follow him. and even among those who follow
him, only a few achieve the condition of absolute evanescence, placing their
whole lives at his service. nevertheless he fulfills his purpose using all
human beings as “pawns” of his great games. Some of them are unaware,
sometimes even rebellious, pawns. others are aware and willing to different
degrees. in a definition, which some of us may perceive as trenchant, Shoghi
effendi writes that whoever does not heed his call serves in “the forces of
darkness” and whoever does, serves in “the army of light” (Citadel 26). The
freedom of human beings is limited to the choice to side with the former or
the latter. in reality God alone will decide whether this choice of theirs will
be confirmed or not, because God “confirmeth whom he pleaseth, and deni-
eth whom he pleaseth” (Bahá’u’lláh, “S.ah.ífiy-i-Shat.t.íyyih” 59).

These reflections will raise different feelings in the hearts of different
persons. Many centuries ago rúmí described our condition as servants of

God with the following verses: “We are as pieces of chess (engaged) in vic-
tory and defeat: our victory and defeat is from thee, o thou whose quali-
ties are comely!” (Mathnaví 1:35, v. 600). and he exalted the spiritual rank
achieved through radiant acquiescence thus:

do you bear (his burden)? he will cause you to be borne (aloft). do

> you receive (his commands)? he will cause you to be received (into
> his favour).
if you accept his command, you will become the spokesman (thereof);
if you seek union (with him), thereafter you will become united.

(Mathnaví 1:52–53, v. 936–39)

a great light is shed on this entangling issue by the following words by
Bahá’u’lláh:

> The Book of life is a testimony of the inscrutable decree (qad.á) . . .
> for the wise ones the decree of God is loved and all of them are sat-
> isfied, nay grateful. Whosoever protests was not and is not accept-
> able. “Whosoever is not content with My decree let him find seek a
> lord other than Me.” Whoever knows and understands the fruits of
> the tree of the decree will not be short of bliss, happiness, exhilara-
> tion, delight, resignation, acquiescence (rid.á).15

all our reflections bring us back to our starting point: radiant acquies-
cence. This attitude of energetic and joyous surrender to the Will of God
is a vital element of the wisdom that Bahá’u’lláh recommends, in the Tablet
to his leaf that we have analyzed, to be acquired through our scanning of
“the pages of the Book of life.” We are wholly in the hands of God. our
vaunted freedom does not concern so much the concrete events of life that
seemingly mostly depend on his decrees. it rather concerns the intentions
with which we perform our daily actions. Their results also are in his
hands. But this condition of servitude, impotence, and ignorance of the
decrees of destiny, which may be perceived as a reason for humiliation and
wretchedness, is on the contrary a great bounty. it gives us a reason to

30             The Journal of Bahá’í Studies 20. 1/4. 2010

struggle in our lives so that we may achieve the goals we have set before
ourselves, in the hope that he may graciously confirm our actions and in
the awareness that our wholehearted adherence to the religion he has sent
us—a religion which acquaints us with “the essential connection which
proceeds from the realities of things” (‘abdu’l-Bahá, Some Answered
Questions 158, 40:7)—is the best thing we can do to abide by his decrees
and, God willing, earn his confirmations. and all they who “see the end
and the beginning as one; nay . . . see neither beginning nor end,” they who
“have passed over the worlds of names, and fled beyond the worlds of
attributes as swift as lightning” (Bahá’u’lláh, Seven Valleys 15) and “regard
the world even as a shadow that vanisheth swifter than the twinkling of an
eye” (Bahá’u’lláh, Prayers and Meditations 15, sec. 12, para. 1) and them-
selves as less than “the black in the eye of a dead ant” (Bahá’u’lláh, Súriy-i-
haykal, in Summons 82, par. 156), all these people “from sorrow” turn to
bliss, from anguish to joy” and their “grief and mourning yield to delight
and rapture” (Bahá’u’lláh, Seven Valleys 29). They have truly achieved the
freedom Bahá’u’lláh has come to bring to humankind, not only “freedom
from want” and “from war,” but also “freedom to unite, freedom to
progress, freedom in peace and joy” (The universal house of Justice,
“individual rights” 518).
