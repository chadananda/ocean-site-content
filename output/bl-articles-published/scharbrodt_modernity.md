> **Abstract:**  
>   
> This paper is an attempt to place the emergence of the Bahá'i Faith in the context of 19th century Middle Eastern gedankenwelt. So far only little research has been made to investigate the relationship of the Bahá'í Faith towards Middle Eastern reform thinkers and to compare their ideas. One has to observe that its role in relationship to those reform movements has been overlooked so far, although there were partly intense contacts between \`Abdu'l-Bahá' and those reform thinkers. 'Abduh met at least once, but probably several times 'Abdul-Bahá' during his exile in Beirut. The nature of 'Abduh' s relationship to \`Abdu'l-Bahá and to the Bahá'í Faith certainly requires further research. Bahá'u'lláh's and Abduh's ideas on theology, prophetology and salvation history are expounded and compared. The comparison does not only aim at showing differences and parallels, but also at finding reasons for them in relation to the objectives of their respective reform programmes. It demonstrates how both thinkers try to bridge tradition with modernity and to find a theological response to the tension between both forces by appropriating, stressing, dismissing and modifying elements of the traditions they come from and enriching them with modern ideas. With their theologies, Bahá'u'lláh and Muhammad 'Abduh attempt to explain the decline of Middle Eastern societies and to justify the necessity of reforms. The comparison shows that despite the similarities in the modernist outlook of their theologies, both find two different responses to modernity. Whereas 'Abduh remains on the grounds of the Islamic tradition and seeks to make it relevant to the modern world, Bahá'u'lláh introduces himself as a new source of divine authority and founds a new religion.

Theological Responses to Modernity in the Nineteenth-century Middle East:
The examples of Bahá’u’lláh and Muhammad Abduh

by Oliver Scharbrodt

Introduction: Bahá’u’lláh, Muhammad Abduh, and the challenge of modernity

he emergence of Western modernity in the nineteenth-century Middle East led to the appearance of a

T      variety of movements that responded to modernity. The military, political and economic dominance of

Western powers in the Middle East that resulted in the colonisation or semi-colonisation of many coun-
tries of that region illustrated the backwardness of Muslim countries which were not prepared for the exposure
to Western modernity. Therefore, political movements sought the modernisation of the state apparatus by intro-
ducing Western administrative patterns and legal reforms, constitutionalists demanded the abolition of absolute
monarchy and supported democratisation, and state officials intended to prepare Middle Easterners intellectu-
ally to modernity by establishing a Wes tern-like educational system. Usually the discussion of the emergence
of modernity in the Middle East is concerned with these socio-political issues.

However, Western imperialism had a deep ps ychological impact on Middle Easterners as well. The domi-
nance and rule of non-Muslims over Muslims questioned the strength of Islam and forced Muslims to admit
that the followers of Christianity, a religion Islam was supposed to supersede, have achieved a greater civili-
sation.1 The belief that Islam was the final and perfect revelation of God was contradicted by the vulnerabili-
ty and dependence of Muslim states on Western intervention. Hence, the emergence of Western modernity has
an important theological dimension, since the backwardness of Muslims in relation to the so-called infidels
from Europe questions the superiority of the Islamic religion. Only a s mall minority abandoned Islam at all,
thinking the religion itself responsible for the decline of the Middle East and seeking a solution in Western sec-
ularism. The majority searched for a religious response to modernity and hoped for a restoration of the glori-
ous past of Islam. 2 Any response which does not intend to abandon the religious tradition at all, has to find an
explanation for the present decline of Muslim societies and to explain how the religious tradition can be made
relevant for modernity in order to maintain its universal validity. If such a religious response intends to mod-
ernise Muslim societies, it has to find a theological justification for reform on the basis of the Islamic tradi-
tion. Such an approach is not unusual to Muslim theological discourse which always had political implications
and was purs ued in support of a specific political agenda.

This paper will present and compare two religious responses to Western modernity in the nineteenth-centu-
ry Middle East: the theological ideas of Bahá’u’lláh (1817-1892) and M uhammad Abduh (1849-1905).
Muhammad Abduh is undoubtedly one of the most influential thinkers of modern Is lam. Being the dis ciple of
Jamál al-Dín al-Afghaní and the teacher of Rashíd Ridá, Abduh stands in the line of eminent personalities in
the Islamic world of the last two centuries. Afghání’s fame is based on his Pan-Islamic political activism, while
Ridá’s s ignificance lies in his ideological impact on modern Muslim political movements like the Muslim
Brotherhood. Both secular liberal-minded Muslim intellectuals and fundamentalist ideologues refer to Abduh
as their predecessor in reforming Islam. Abduh received a traditional education at Azhar where he came in con-
tact with Afghání and became one of his closest disciples. Because of his support for the nationalist movement
that emerged in Egypt in the 1870’s, Abduh was exiled to Beirut after the defeat of Urabi’s nationalist revolt
in 1882. Later he went to Paris and allied with Afghání, publishing with his teacher the anti-British journal al-
Urwat al-Wuthqá. In 1888, the permission was given to him to settle again in Egypt, where he started working
as a judge and became chief mufti of Egypt in 1899. Until his death in 1905, he was much involved in pub-
lishing activities and tried to implement administrative and educational reforms at Azhar.

Both Bahá’u’lláh and Abduh deal in their writings with those socio-political issues that other reform move-
ments in the Middle East discussed. However, this paper will focus on their theological ideas, following the
thesis that any reform attempt with a religious outlook has to provide a theological justification for its aims .
Bahá’u’lláh and Abduh are not interes ted in theology per se, but intend to provide a metaphysical framework

for their respective reform programmes. Abduh’s most important theological work is the Risalat al-tawhíd, a
systematic treatise on Islamic theology that was published after his return to Egypt on the basis of the lectures
he gave during his exile in Beirut. Bahá’u’lláh has not written a systematic treatise on the subject, but His the-
ological ideas are spread throughout His writings. The Kitáb-i-ˆqán, which He wrote in Baghdad in the late
1850s or early 1860s before His open proclamation, express es His growing prophetic consciousness and can
be considered to be the theological manifesto of the Bahá’í Faith. This paper will compare Bahá’u’lláh’s and
Muhammad Abduh’s ideas on theology, prophetology, and salvation history. The comparison does not only aim
at showing differences and parallels, but also at finding reasons for them in relation to the objectives of their
reform programmes. It demonstrates how both thinkers try to bridge tradition with modernity and to find a the-
ological response to the tension between both forces by appropriating, stressing, dismissing and modifying ele-
ments of the traditions they come from and enriching them with modern ideas. The comparison distinguishes
between four modern motifs in their theologies.

Modern motifs in Bahá’u’lláh’s and Muhammad Abduh’s theologies
Rationalism

It is not surprising that both thinkers refer to M u‘tazila rationalism and nominalism in order to modernise
and to a certain extent rationalise theology. However, Bahá’u’lláh and Muhammad Abduh only make selective
use of Mu‘tazila ideas and use them to a different degree. Abduh’s point of departure is a philosophical proof
of God’s existence. According to him, it is possible to prove God’s existence rationally without any reference
to revelation. One can find analogies of this philosophical approach in medieval Christian and Muslim theo-
logical discourses which have appropriated the Aristotelian theory of existence to prove the validity of either
the Christian or Islamic revelation universally, based on reas on.3 For Abduh, logic provides universal canoni-
cal rules for secure and objective knowledge. 4 Abduh applies this notion of logic to his philosophical approach
to theology in order to provide it with a foundation which he considers to be rational and hence universally
valid.

Abduh distinguishes three epistemological categories which have ontological counterparts. Everything that
can be known can be categorised as being either possible (mumkin), impossible (mustahíl) or necessary
(wájib). 5 Three principles of existence follow these categories of knowledge. Abduh discriminates between
“that which is contingent, 6 that which is necessarily self-existent7 and that which is inherently impossible of
existence.” 8,9 These three categories of existence enable Abduh with a tool to deduce from them the existence
of God, while discussing them en détail. The mode of the impossible or non-existent is only an imaginative
category which can neither in reality nor logically be existent.10 The contingent possesses potentially and
equally both the mode of being and the mode of non-being. It requires an external force that causes the actu-
alisation of the principle of being. The existence of the contingent depends on a prior cause, as it can never
cause its existence by itself. The contingent ceases from exis ting when a cause lacks or stops the continuous
process of causation. The contingency of things of the created world can be perceived, as they come into being
and disappear later. All contingent things of the world constitute the contingent which requires a primal cause.
This cause cannot be part of the contingent since, being a cause, it must exist prior to the contingent. The nec-
essarily existent and the non-existent are the two ontological modes that precede the contingent. However,
since the non-existent does not exist, only the necessarily existent can be the primal cause. 11

After having shown that the necessarily existent Being causes the contingent, Abduh introduces the essen-
tial qualities of the primal cause. One of its characteristics is its pre-existent eternity, since it precedes all con-
tingent things. 12 All attributes must be assigned to it in their most complete form to maintain its perfection. As
it bestows attributes to contingent things and hence determines their nature, it must possess these attributes per-
fectly. 13 The qualities of life, knowledge, will, freedom of choice mus t be then, according to Abduh, essential
attributes of the necessarily existent Being as well. 14 One can find a similar discourse on the attributes of the
Supreme Being among Neoplatonists, except for the stress on unity (wahda) which has been added to this set
by Al-Ash‘arí and Al-Ghazálí in Muslim theological discourse.15 Likewise for Abduh, the oneness of the nec-
essarily existent Being “in His essence, His attributes, His existence and His acts” 16 has to be ass umed. The
attribute of unity implies its non-composite nature and its uniqueness, as no being is equal to it. 17 With this
philosophical approach to God’s existence, Abduh presumes to have proven the rationality of the fundamental

\[140\] Theological Responses to Modernity

belief in one God and to have shown the harmony of reason and revelation in the basic question of God’s being.
For Abduh, reason alone is sufficient to lead to the belief in God. Abduh revives the philosophical approach to
God of medieval Muslim theologians and philosophers for his apologetic aim of demonstrating the reconcil-
ability of Islam with reason. 18

In contrast to Abduh, Bahá’u’lláh does not seek a rational foundation for the faith in God. Although He
shares with Abduh the distinction between the contingency of creation and God as its non-contingent creator,
He does not provide a logical explanation of God’s existence, but embeds God and His creation in a Sufi-like
cosmological scheme. Apparently, Bahá’u’lláh does not see the necessity to prove God’s existence, and the
addressees of His writings probably never doubted it anyway.

The different attitudes of Bahá’u’lláh and Abduh towards reason can be observed in their discussion of the
divine attributes as well. Both s hare a nominalistic and skeptical view of language, but again the extent and
the purpose they use it for differs. Both agree that the divine essence is neither attainable by human compre-
hension nor express ible by language—only through His attributes can God be recognised. Whereas for Abduh
most attributes can be rationally deduced from the necessarily existent Being, Bahá’u’lláh underlines that all
attributes assigned to God have no reality and do not reflect the divine essence. This difference can be
explained by their different objectives. Although Abduh follows the scholastic tradition in expounding a philo-
sophic approach to God’s existence and emphasises the necessity and importance of a rational basis of theol-
ogy, he does not entirely agree with a complete appropriation of speculative philosophy in theological dis-
course. For him, the attempt to integrate wholly Greek philosophy in Muslim theology entails a danger that the
ultimate truth criteria of Qur’án and Sunna could be replaced by thos e of peripatetic philosophy.19 Furthermore,
Abduh is critical of many scholastic discussions which he considers to be futile, as they seek to grasp theo-
logical ideas which are not rationally comprehensible. Such discuss ions have often led to unnecessary sectar-
ian divisions that have undermined Muslim doctrinal unity. Abduh’s primary aim is to find the essential doc-
trines of Islam which all Muslims can agree on. He therefore eschews subtle theological speculations which he
considers to be counter-productive. 20

Abduh legitimises the necessity of philosophical caution in reflecting on God by quoting the following
hadíth: “Ponder the creation of God, but do not take your meditations into the Divine essence, or you will per-
ish.”21 In accordance with this hadíth, Abduh employs the atomistic theory of philos ophy that distinguishes
between accidents and substance of a thing. 22 Only accidents of a thing, namely its qualities, are accessible for
the human mind, while the substance of a thing which lies behind its accidents is not comprehensible, because
“reason quite lacks the competence to penetrate the essence of things.” 23 Due to the ultimate alterity of God, it
is impossible to grasp the divine essence. 24 Only some of God’s attributes are accessible by the rational facul-
ty. Most problems of theological speculation are not solvable, such as whether the attributes of God are part of
the divine essence, separated from it, or what other kind of relationship they have to each other. Such ques-
tions transcend human understanding. Any controversy around these issues is a controversy around words
which can never fully reflect reality, “for linguistic usage [isti‘mál al-lugha] does not ‘grasp’ truth [al-haqíqa],
and even if words do come to expressive grips with reality, the way language put things never does full justice
to them as they really are essentially.” 25 Abduh employs a nominalistic and s ometimes even agnostic attitude
in order to avoid subtle theological speculations that have divided the Muslim community, but is willing to
adopt a philosophical approach to God as long as it promotes his intention to rationalise theology.

Bahá’u’lláh’s use of nominalism serves different purposes. In the writings of Bahá’u’lláh, theology and
prophetology are connected with cosmology. The structure of Bahá’u’lláh’s theological cosmos provides the
metaphys ical background that illustrates the station of God and the prophets and the function of revelation.
Hence, any discussion of theological issues in Bahá’u’lláh’s writings has to start with an outline of His meta-
physics. The most well-known structuralistion of cosmos is the threefold scheme that distinuishes between the
world of God (‘álam al-haqq), the world of command (‘álam al-amr), i.e. the world of the Manifestions, and
the world of creation (‘álam al-khalq). The world of the Absolute Truth (haqq) stands on top of the hierarchy.
It refers to God’s primordial divine es sence in its non-manifest and undifferentiated status of pure oneness
(ahadiyya).26 In this realm God is one, as there is no distinction between His substance and His Attributes, and
God is absolutely transcendent, as all Attributes ascribed to Him on that level fail to reflect divine Reality and
even the Prophets have no access to this realm and cannot comprehend God’s pure Essence. 27 Since God is con-

Lights of ‘Irfán

tained as a non-manifest essence in the highest realm, any attempt to describe His Being in this stage is futile.
An impersonal description of God is dominant in reference to this world. Any description of God can never
represent His inaccessible divine Essence and any conceptualisation of the absolute Truth is inevitably mis-
conceived. 28 In the Kitáb-i-ˆqán Bahá’u’lláh affirms: “So lofty is this station that no testimony can bear wit-
ness, neither evidence do justice to its truth . . .”29 At this stage a negative theology of the deus absconditus
(the hidden God) prevails, which almost resembles an agnostic attitude.30

Despite the transcendence of the impersonal God, Who is so far beyond mystical experience or philosophi-
cal conception 31 then even the possibility of adequate wors hip is thrown into doubt, 32 Bahá’u’lláh assigns
attributes to Him. Following orthodox Islamic theology, God is des cribed as “the Eternal,” 33 “the Powerful, . .
. the Almighty”34 and as the omniscient source of all knowledge, having sight, hearing, s peech, life and unity. 35
However, in accordance with the Mu‘tazila, Bahá’u’lláh makes only nominalistic use of these attributes, con-
sidering them not as real entities but rather as allegorical descriptions of God’s indescribable nature,36 since “it
is evident that God, the unknowable Essence, the divine Being is immensely exalted beyond every human
attribute, such as corporal existence, ascent and descent, egress and regress . . .”37 Attributing qualities to God
irres pective of their insufficiency illustrates that God is beyond all imperfections.38

God becomes manifest in the realms inferior to the World of Absolute Truth. Only through these manifesta-
tions is God approachable. The first manifestation occurs with the emergence of the Primal Will that emanates
from the primordial divine essence. This logos becomes the point of departure of theology. Since there is no
real theology outside God’s manifestation, only a negative theology referring to God as the Absolute Truth, one
should speak of “manifestation theology”39 or “theophanology.” 40 The Word of God (kálimát alláh/kalám
alláh) or logos is not only the first but also the pivotal attribute that becomes manifested, as it links God’s
inscrutable essence with creation. The Word of God is the generative and creative force in the universe, being
“the Cause of the entire creation, while all else besides His Word are but the creatures and the effects there-
of.”41 Bahá’u’lláh is only nominalistic in reference to God in the highest realm to underscore the inaccessibil-
ity of divine essence. This negative approach to God becomes the foundation of His manifestation theology.
God is only accessible through the revelation of His attributes in the metaphysical realms and for human beings
through the appearance of a Manifestation of God.

Hence, the appropriation of Mu‘tazila rationalism by Bahá’u’lláh and Abduh depends on how useful it is for
the ultimate purpos es of their theologies. Abduh’s aim is to rationalise religious belief and to achieve Muslim
doctrinal unity by eschewing contentious theological controversies. His dogmatic exposition is supposed to be
generally accessible and to show the essential beliefs Muslims have in common in order to overcome sectari-
an divisions. 42 Islam is presented as Vernunftreligion 43 (religion of reason) that reconciles revelation with phi-
losophy, because they share the same basic axiom. Philosophy starts from the existence of the necessarily exis-
tent Being and Islamic theology is based on the Qur’ánic teachings of God that do not contradict, but even con-
firm the philosophical approach. 44

Bahá’u’lláh’s use of nominalism serves different purposes. For him, theology is not rationalisable, as rea-
son fails to comprehend God who is as a logic-transcending entity beyond all forms of conceptualis ation. His
negative approach to divine essence illustrates the necessity of the revelation and manifes tation of divine
attributes in creation. Bahá’u’lláh appropriates Sufi terminology and concepts as a means to expound the
dependence of human beings on the Manifestations of God to recognise God. Any knowledge about God stems
from His Manifestations alone. Whereas Abduh intends to rationalise theology, Bahá’u’lláh develops theology
as a metaphysical framework that makes the continuous revelation of God in history plausible and allows the
possibility of a post-Qur’ánic revelation. 45
Ethics

Another approach Bahá’u’lláh and Muhammad Abduh use to rationalise theology is to give prophethood pri-
marily a socio-moral function and to stress the ethical necessity of divine revelation. For both, the prophets or
Manifestations provide knowledge of the afterlife, lay the foundations for solidarity and unity of a communi-
ty, and bring doctrines that become the source of a new civilisation. Individual and collective well-being
depends on divine revelation. Both assume the priority of ethics over theological and metaphysical expositions.
Abduh follows al-Ghazálí’s emphasis on ethics in composing the Risalat al-tawhíd as “un traité éthico-

\[142\] Theological Responses to Modernity

théologique”46 which underscore the necessary relevance theological discussions must have to moral questions.
Likewise, a shift from metaphysics to ethics is discernible in Bahá’u’lláh’s writings. As the nature of meta-
physical realities transcends human comprehension and the perception of them depends on the beholder’s per-
spective, all knowledge of them is inevitably provisional and limited. Therefore, the moral consequences and
spiritual message a metaphysical concept conveys are more important than the actual reality of such a con-
cept.47 Nevertheless, how prophethood fulfils its moral function is conceived by both in a slightly different way
which reveals their different attitudes towards reason. Additionally, Abduh’s expos ition of prophecy remains
in orthodox framework, whereas Bahá’u’lláh’s employs Sufi concepts and terms to give a new notion of
prophethood.

Abduh has an elitist approach towards ethics. Like the Mu‘tazila, Abduh uses an aesthetic point of depar-
ture for ethics. According to the Mu‘tazila doctrine, the aesthetic distinction between beautiful and ugly (hasan
wa qabíh) is inherent to human nature. Although there might be different opinions on what actually defines
beauty or ugliness, all human beings agree that there is a basic distinction between both qualities. 48 This aes-
thetic distinction is transferred to the ethical sphere, since actions likewise possess beauty or ugliness in them-
selves or in the results they produce. 49 Hence, Abduh assumes like the Mu‘tazila, an intuitive aesthetic com-
petence with an ethical counterpart that can discriminate between beautiful and ugly and good and bad, respec-
tively. Therefore, reason would theoretically be sufficient for the determination of moral values without divine
r e v e l a t i o n .5 0

However, only a small minority is able to use its rational faculty adequately to come to right moral conclu-
sions. Most people can only make limited use of their reason, as its full application is circumscribed by their
passions. 51 A small elite can actualise the right moral values on their own without revelation, but the morality
of certain acts is difficult to prove rationally to the whole of humanity. Hence, a guidance is necessary that
gives an adequate understanding of those aspects of religion and ethics that are not attainable by the majority
of people. 52 The prophets are the mediators that bring knowledge of God and His Attributes to the generality
of people and convey those truths, the elite already has realised. Speaking with superior divine authority, they
provide secure foundations of religious and moral knowledge and bestow a strong belief, that cannot be
achieved by reas on.53

In contrast to Abduh, Bahá’u’lláh has a skeptical attitude towards reason and its moral competence. For
Him, everybody requires divine revelation, as it conveys knowledge which is unattainable by reason at all.
Human beings cannot rely on their nature to determine ethical values, since they only partly follow the natur-
al law as an instinct-reduced being. The dual animal and angelic nature of human beings necessitates guidance
that reveals the divine potentialities in them. Revelation is the Archimedic point all morality is rooted in. 54

Likewise the channels of moral guidance, namely the prophets and Manifestations, are differently con-
ceived. Abduh follows the orthodox Sunni prophetology. He stres ses the human nature of the prophets who are
ordinary human beings dependent on the conditions of human life and do not differ from others on this pure-
ly human level.55 He upholds the doctrine of ‘isma that the prophets are exempted from sin and error. God
chooses exceptional souls that are receptive for divine revelation and possess moral and spiritual superiority
to their contemporaries to mediate between him and creation. The prophets reveal books which contain the
Word of God and which are sufficient proof of the authenticity of their prophecy due to their inimitability. 56
The authenticity of their prophetic mission encourages obedience to the revealed moral laws. In order to ratio-
nalise the Islamic doctrine of prophecy, Abduh restricts the infallibility of the prophets to their prophetic mis-
sion.57 Abduh particularly stresses that the prophets do not have any authority on scientific issues. Neither rea-
son nor revelation affirms the absolute infallibility of the prophets in all aspects of life.58 Abduh excludes
prophetic infallibility from science for the purpose of opening scientific research for humans and interpreting
prophetic references to nature that might contradict modern s ciences allegorically.

In Bahá’u’lláh’s writings, the ethical dimension of revelation is illustrated by placing the Manifestations in
the cosmological s cheme. Bahá’u’lláh uses the term “manifestation” (mazhar, zuhúr) in two senses. On the one
hand, it refers to the manifestation of divine attributes in creation as part of the permanent creative process of
God. On the other hand, “Manifestation” describes the recipients of the secondary revelation of God, namely
the divine prophets and messengers that have been sent to humanity throughout the course of history. This con-
cept of the Manifestations59 of God which follows to a certain extent the Islamic prophetology and adopts some

Lights of ‘Irfán

Sufi terms is probably one of the most original aspects of Bahá’u’lláh’s theology and plays the most signifi-
cant role therein. The introduction of this term in the writings of Bahá’u’lláh implies His claim to offer a new
vision of revelation and salvation history. The term “Manifestation” is meant to transcend the Islamic termi-
nology, as prophethood or messengerhood represent lower definitions of theophany, whereas the introduction
of a new terminology s uggests Bahá’u’lláh’s intention to provide a fuller understanding of theophany.60

Nevertheless, the Qur’ánic terms prophet (nabí) and messenger (rasúl) can be found in Bahá’u’lláh’s writ-
ings as well as the basic prophetological concepts of the Islamic tradition, particularly of Shí‘ism. Like the
major theologians of Shí‘í Islam, Bahá’u’lláh distinguishes between prophets with a merely admonis hing func-
tion and “prophets endowed with constancy or legislating prophets .” 61 The prophets with constancy bring a
new law, abrogating the provisions of the previous revelation. Likewise, a book has been revealed to them
which becomes the instrument of the new divine legislation.62 Like Islamic prophetology, Bahá’u’lláh stress es
the sinlessness and moral infallibility (‘isma) of the prophets with constancy. In the Kitáb-i-Aqdas, He intro-
duces the concept of the “Mos t Great Infallibility [al-‘ismat al-kubrá]”63 which does not only cons ist of their
moral perfection, but also of their independence from moral laws of the previous revelations. As divine legis-
lators, these prophets act in a non-ethical realm. 64

In the writings of Bahá’u’lláh, “prophets endowed with constancy” is synonymous with “Manifestations of
God.” The Manifestations fluctuate between human and divine consciousness and not only transmit the Word
of God but are identical with it. They are not ordinary humans or equal to other contingent beings; rather, being
identical with the eternal logos, They are uncreated and precede the contingent world. 65 All divine attributes
are perfectly reflected in Them and conveyed to creation. Their moral authority stems from Their status as
Manifestation of God which perfectly represents divine attributes into creation to enable the spiritual progress
of the individual and the material and spiritual progress of society. Human beings have to emulate this reflec-
tion to obtain divine attributes, that are inherent in themselvs, and to follow the moral laws introduced by the
Manifestations for individual and collective well-being. 66 Despite the conceptual differences between
Bahá’u’lláh’s and Abduh’s prophetology, both stress the ethical dimension of prophethood to make revelation
relevant to the requirements of the modern world.
Evolution

Both Bahá’u’lláh and Muhammad Abduh expound an evolutionary notion of salvation history and a dynam-
ic concept of religion. Salvation history is the gradual revelation of the divine will in the course of history that
correlates to the evolutionary development of human civilisation. Likewise religion is not a static and
immutable entity, but an active force that has to be revitalised and actualised to changing conditions.
Bahá’u’lláh and Abduh distinguish between the es sential part of religion that cannot be modified, but has to be
preserved, and the changeable part that has to be assimilated to the requirements of time in order to keep reli-
gion alive as a social force. However, both use this evolutionary and dynamic concept of religion and salva-
tion history for different purposes. Whereas Abduh uses the evolutionary motif to defend the superiority of
Is lam, Bahá’u’lláh employs it to make the neces sity of a new theophany credible.

Particularly, the evolutionary thought of Herbert Spencer is considered to have been an influence on
Abduh. 67 It enabled the development of an evolutionary concept of salvation history that serves as a further
legitimisation of the finality of Muhammad’s prophethood. The development of humanity in general is analo-
gous to the psychological development of the individual. Humanity passes from its childhood to adolescence
and finally reaches its maturity. 68 The different religions constitute the divine educational programme for
humanity and respond to the spiritual and intellectual capacity of the time they appear and convey pres crip-
tions according to the needs of that specific period. Abduh divides history in three stages that represent the
development of humanity. In the pre-prophetic period, the primary concern of humanity was the satisfaction of
its material and physical needs. In this period, an animistic understanding of nature prevailed. People then
became more conscious of the mechanisms of natural law and social life and partly realised the spiritual
dimension of their existence in the prophetic period. The divine prophets appeared successively to reveal the
divine Will. Humanity now lives in the post-prophetic period which does not require any further prophetic rev-
e l a t i o n . 69

The religious education of humanity took place in the prophetic period with three successive revelations that

\[144\] Theological Responses to Modernity

led humanity from infancy to maturity. The three religions Abduh refers to are very likely Judaism,
Christianity, and Is lam. The religion that appeared at humanity’s childhood (Judaism) corresponded to the
capacity and mentality of the people by appealing to the senses with miracles and containing simple and com-
prehensible provisions . It guided humanity by a rigorous ethics that demanded complete obedience.70 Over the
course of time, humanity made spiritual and intellectual progress and reached its adolescence. The religion
which appeared at that stage responded to contemporary circumstances and had a purely emotional appeal. The
primary objective of the adolescent divine revelation consisted in increasing the spiritual awareness of human-
ity: “It laid down for men sacred laws of asceticism, drawing them away from the world altogether and turn-
ing them towards higher life.”7 But this religion (Christianity) became corrupted by its religious leaders and its
ascetic stress on the after-life neglected the material needs of human beings. This religion declined due to sec-
tarian divisions. Anti-intellectual tendencies that revealed a strong hostility to science caused stagnation and
social decay.72

The arrival of Muhammad’s prophecy and the emergence of Islam mark the ultimate culmination of the evo-
lutionary divine education of humanity. Islam has the most universal appeal, addressing emotion and reason
simultaneously. 73 For Abduh, Islam introduced the essential unity of all religions, as their basic teachings are
identical and they all represented different stages of the divinely guided salvation history: “[Islam] demon-
strated that religion with God was one in all generations, that there was a single Divine purpose for their reform
without and their cleansing within.” 74 Differences among the religions are explained by the dissimilar condi-
tions and circumstances of the times when new prophets appeared.75 Although all religions participate in one
single truth, Abduh presents inclusivist Islam as being the complete and final expression of truth. 76 Due to its
complete nature and universal appeal, Islam leads humanity to maturity and builds the transition from the
prophetic to the post-prophetic period. As humanity has achieved its maturity, Abduh believed, it does not
require any further divine revelation, and as Islam already represents the complete expression of truth that can-
not be augmented, prophethood terminated in Muhammad’s mission. Hence, Abduh’s view of salvation histo-
ry delivers an evolutionary argument for the finality of Muhammad’s prophethood.

Although divine revelation has ceased with Muhammad and brought salvation history to its ultimate climax,
the evolutionary development of the Islamic religion does not stop, but the fundamental principles of Islam
have to be re-actualised in correlation with the requirements of time. Abduh uses the concept of the mujaddid
(renewer) who appears periodically to renew Islam by cleansing it from unnecessary traditions and reinstating
the pristine faith of the early period. 77 As other Islamic scholars like Ibn Khaldoun or Ibn Taimiyya, Abduh dis-
tinguishes between rules concerned with questions of ritual and worship (ibádát) and rules dealing with
humans’ relations to the world and to each other (mu‘ámalát). While the former are unquestionably prescribed
by revelation and are immutable, the latter consist in abstract principles which have to be interpreted and
applied to changing conditions. 78 Hence, Abduh encourages a new ijtihád, employing the general mu‘ámalát
principles to the present needs and aiming at the welfare of society (maslaha). He repudiates the imitation
(taqlíd) of the legal theories of medieval Islamic scholars, because their provisions are not prepared for the
demands of the modern world.79 Ijtihád as interpretative instrument and maslahah as legal criterion guarantee
the flexibility of Islam in order to make it relevant to modern issues.

Bahá’u’lláh introduces a dynamic concept of religion which undergoes different stages in its development.

The emergence of a new theophany is referred to as being similar to the season of spring, as the revelation
induces a new spirit into humanity and creates a new consciousness. Every religion reaches the zenith of its
development, when its doctrines are widespread in society and the civilisation founded by that religion attains
its climax.80 However, after this period of progress, the decline of a religion inevitably commences, when peo-
ple start corrupting the religion and its original teachings. 81 Bahá’u’lláh interprets symbolically the eschato-
logical motif that in the Day of Judgement the sun and moon will darken; these signify the oblivion of the gen-
uine teachings of religion and the merely outer performance of its rituals without the right ethical and spiritu-
al consciousness.82 In another passage, Bahá’u’lláh, referring to Shí‘í Islam, compares the situation at the early
days with the present-day conditions and concludes that Shí‘í Is lam declined because the believers abandoned
its genuine doctrines, became dogmatic, and blindly followed the religious leadership. 83 The rise and decline
of a religion is, hence, “an inevitable and natural process” 84 which is caused by its adherents.

This dynamic notion of religion going through stages of progress and decline necessitates the continuous

Lights of ‘Irfán

periodical renewal of revelation to re-establish the genuine faith of God which the believers have abandoned.
Every new religion breaks “with past traditions; with obsolete, outworn forms and institutions; and with a rit-
ualistic conservatism divested of any meaning.”85 In the Kitáb-i-ˆqán, Bahá’u’lláh speaks of the “City of
Certitude” that is periodically re-constituted by the Manifestations of God.86 However, this cyclical scheme
with the reconstitution of the genuine Faith of God throughout salvation history is completed with a linear
notion of progress. A new theophany does not only fulfil the transhistorical mission of the Manifestations and
adapts it to changing circumstances, but each new revelation leads to progress and a higher consciousness. 87 In
accordance with the evolutionary progres s of humanity, every new Manifestation reveals a fuller account of
truth which goes in line with the increasing receptivity of humanity and, therefore, s upersedes the previous rev-
e l a t i o n s . 88

Bahá’u’lláh’s concept of salvation history combines the cyclical theme of return and renewal with the lin-
ear theme of evolution and progress. All Manifestations of God are connected with Each Other as the agents
of God’s continuous evolutionary education of humanity. Salvation history as progressive revelation does not
allow any claims to exclusivity or finality of any religion and stresses the continuity of revelation, as “not for
a moment hath his grace been withheld, nor have the showers of His living-kindness ceased to rain upon
mankind.”89 The future will experience likewise the emergence of new theophanies. 90 Bahá’u’lláh claims to be
the Manifes tation of God for this age who does not only re-emphasise the essential doctrines of all religions,
but likewise provides teachings which contain the solutions for problems of this age. He further claims to be
the fulfilment of the eschatological expectations of all religions. By identifying himself with the awaited mes-
sianic figures of Islam, Christianity, Zoroastrianism, and Judaism, He does not only underline the essential
unity of all Manifestations, as every theophany is the return of the previous ones, but also universalises his
claim considering himself to be the Promised One of all religions.91 His theophany marks the eschaton which
the s criptures of previous religions anticipate. Therefore, His mission will inaugurate a new age in the history
of humanity as promised and will lead to the reconciliation of all religions and the establishment of world
peace. Through Bahá’u’lláh’s theophany, humanity will reach its maturity.

A radical break with the past occurs with Bahá’u’lláh’s Revelation, necessitated because tradition does not
provide adequate solutions for modern problems. It is not enough to reform the sharí‘a; what was needed was
a new sharí‘a equipped for modern challenges. 92 The concept of progressive revelation provides an explana-
tion for the present decay of Muslim societies which is the inevitable result of the natural decline of the Islamic
religion. However, progressive revelation links the new theophany with the previous traditions. It upholds the
essential identity of all Manifestations who are part of salvation history and contains the idea of the periodical
renewal of the faith of God under varying social circumstances.93 This notion of essential identity between all
religions facilitates the acceptance of new authority claims, since it suggests that by becoming a follower of
Bahá’u’lláh one does not betray one’s own tradition, as the essential beliefs are identical in all religions .
Becoming a Bahá’í rather means following the most recent version of the genuine faith of God.
Universalism

The evolutionary scheme of salvation history in the writings of Bahá’u’lláh and Muhammad Abduh stress-
es the essential identity of all prophets and the unity of all religions and explains the differences among them
as being the result of the historical and cultural context the prophets appeared in. Hence, Bahá’u’lláh and
Abduh give their theologies a universalistic outlook.94 Behind the historical Manifestations of religion lies “the
changeless Faith of God, eternal in the past, eternal in the future.” 95 Both construe a “metareligion,” a religion
beyond religion that all adherents of concrete historical faiths should acknowledge sharing in common.” 96 Such
essentialist notions of religion can be found in the Islamic tradition, particularly in Sufism, which distinguis h-
es between the exoteric (záhir) and esoteric (bátin) dimension of religion and emphasises likewise the essen-
tial esoteric unity of all religions behind the secondary exoteric differences.97 Textual support for a universal-
istic idea of religion can be found in the Qur’án as well. 98 In addition to these antecedents of theological uni-
versalism in the Islamic tradition, Bahá’u’lláh’s and Abduh’s universalistic approaches conform to modern
intentions of philosophy in the Renais sance and the Enlightenment to achieve an essentialist view of religion
by philosophical abstraction. Enlightenment thinkers like Kant conceived a natural religion behind the positive
religions with their theological corruption. This primordial religion of reason with its stress on ethics and spir-
ituality should become the foundation for reconciliation of all religions. 99

\[146\] Theological Responses to Modernity

From Bahá’u’lláh’s and Abduh’s universalistic theology s tems their call for practical tolerance and interre-
ligious dialogue. For both, tolerance is the attitude that should determine the behaviour of all religionists to
each other. Abduh stresses the tolerant nature of Islam by pointing at its peaceful spread, the actual motivation
of which was to defend people’s right to convert to Islam. There were neither systematic missionary activities
nor forced conversions. 100 On the contrary, all inhabitants of the Muslim territories enjoyed religious freedom
and co-existed peacefully regardless of their religious affiliations. The tolerant atmosphere of early Islam even
allowed non-Muslims to achieve high positions in the state apparatus and encouraged Jews who were perse-
cuted in Europe to immigrate to Islamic territories. 101 Finally, this spirit of tolerance that disregarded social,
racial and religious distinctions promoted mass conversions to Islam. In contrast to the Western image of Islam
as a religion of violence, Abduh underlines its peaceful character by giving jihád a purely defensive charac-
ter. 102 Likewise, Bahá’u’lláh obliges his followers to adopt a tolerant attitude towards adherents of other reli-
gions. As the new source of divine legislative authority He claims to be, He abrogates any Islamic laws and
practices He considers to be intolerant. Bahá’u’lláh prohibits jihád 103 and prescribes peaceful missionary activ-
ities. Any form of religious discrimination is prohibited, as well as religious fanaticism and factionalism and
all practices that discredit other religionists. 104 Bahá’u’lláh explicitly abrogates the Shí‘ite concept of the ritu-
al impurity of non-Muslims105 and the practice of despising and cursing them.106 Another legal consequence of
Bahá’u’lláh’s call for tolerance is the lifting of any marital restrictions between adherents of different reli-
g i o n s .107

However, for Bahá’u’lláh and Abduh the mere practice of passive tolerance is not sufficient. Both stress the
necessity of dialogue among the adherents of different religions in order to overcome prejudices and the
resolve hostility and separation among religions. 108 Abduh is credited with having been involved in interreli-
gious activities between Muslims, Christians, and Jews during his exile in Beirut, aiming at a rapprochement
of the three Semitic religions. 109 Bahá’u’lláh makes the participation of his followers in interreligious dialogue
a religious obligation. 110 Such a dialogue is the requirement for the mutual reconciliation of all religions and
the creation of a cosmopolitan consciousnes s that considers the whole humanity as one family and prioritis es
the collective welfare of humanity over particular interests.111 This dialogical approach expresses the primary
objective of Bahá’u’lláh’s mission which consists in “the unification and pacification of the whole world.”112

Despite the tolerant and universalistic tone of their theologies, Bahá’u’lláh and Abduh cannot be considered
to be proponents of religious pluralism. Although they discourage religious exclusivity and its attendant intol-
erant excesses , both undertake an inclusivistic approach to other religions. They accept the divine origin and
temporary validity of other religions, but their religion—Islam in the case of Abduh and the Bahá’í Faith in the
case of Bahá’u’lláh—repres ents the most accurate version of divine revelation that is fully equipped to face
the challenges of the modern world. For Abduh, Islam is the religion that harmonises perfectly with human
nature, as it appeals to reason and emotion alike. The egalitarian tendencies and the liberating force of Islam
make it a modern religion par excellence. According to his exposition, Islam is not only compatible to moder-
nity but can function as a moral foundation of the modern society as well, and be the criterion which discerns
the good and bad elements of progress: “Islam could serve both as a principle of change and a salutary control
over it.”113 In a similar way, Bahá’u’lláh claims His religion to be the absolute and ultimate truth criterion by
virtue of its being the lates t divine revelation. 114 The inclusivistic appropriation of the previous religions in the
concept of progressive revelation implies that the Bahá’í Faith supersedes all previous traditions. Bahá’u’lláh’s
“cross-cultural messianism” 115 is the means to universalise His claim. In order to transcend the boundaries of
the Islamic tradition, He claims to be the promised messianic figure of Islam, Christianity, Judaism, and
Zoroastrianism, the four religions that co-exist in Iran.116 This “multiple messiaship” 117 does not aim at sup-
porting religious pluralism, but intends to create a link with other religious traditions in order to facilitate con-
versions from non-Mus lims.

Conclusion: Bahá’u’lláh’s post-Islamic and Abduh’s modernist response to modernity

W. Shepard distinguishes five Muslim reactions to modernity which he terms Islamic secularism, Islamic
modernism, radical Islamism, Islamic traditionalism, and neo-traditionalism. 118 Rippin adds to this categorisa-
tion a post-modern and a post-Islamic response: “It is a common phenomenon in religion that, if the ques tion-
ing of the authority of the past is taken far enough in the desire to be able to accommodate or compensate for
the changes of the modern period, there is a need for a new source of authority.”119 Considering Bahá’u’lláh’s

theological concepts, it becomes evident that they intend to introduce Bahá’u’lláh as new source of authority
which provides divine guidance in the face of modern requirements. Human beings cannot respond adequate-
ly to the modern challenge due to their limited perception of the whole problematique, but God has to respond
himself to it via a new revelation, as He is the all-knowing Educator of humanity. Establishing Bahá’u’lláh as
new source of authority and breaking with the past traditions endows Him with legislative flexibility, since He
has not to compromise with the provisions of the previous traditions. Bahá’u’lláh’s legislation is characterised
by both a sacralizing and desacralizing process. 120 He desacralizes provisions and laws of previous religions
that He considers to be outdated and sacralizes modern ideas of the Western world by giving them the s tatus
of a religious obligation. For instance, in the Lawh-i-Bishárát Bahá’u’lláh prohibits holy war, celibacy, the
practice of confession and penance and dress restrictions as part of the desacralizing process and sacralizes
modern values and concepts like religious tolerance, constitutionalism, disarmament or scientific and techno-
logical progress. 121 Introducing Bahá’u’lláh as new theophany and combining Islamic and non-Islamic ele-
ments in his theology implies a gradual dissociation of the Bahá’í Faith from its Islamic origin that charac-
terises it as a post-Islamic res ponse to modernity. 122

Certainly, Abduh does not trans cend the boundaries of the Islamic tradition. Nevertheles s, Abduh’s approach
is fairly similar to the one of Bahá’u’lláh. Abduh als o desacralizes elements of the tradition he considers to be
inappropriate and condemns taqlíd. For Abduh, this desacralizing process intends to limit the doctrines
Muslims must believe in to an essential minimum which is contained in the original sources, the Qur’án and
the authenticated Sunna, and was embodied by the early generation of the believers. Ijtihád, that denies the
authority of the medieval legacy and only holds sacred the original sources, enables the flexibility of the
Is lamic religion in the light of modern requirements. Despite his claim to refer only to the original Islamic
sources, Abduh’s unders tanding of Islam is informed by a Western view, and Islamic concepts are equated with
Western ideas, as Hourani points out: “In this line of thought, maslaha gradually turns into utility, shura into
parliamentary democracy, ijma’ into public opinion; Islam itself becomes identical with civilization and activ-
ity, the norms of nineteenth-century social thought.”123 Hence, Abduh is eclectical in his method, selecting and
re-interpreting elements of the Islamic tradition which support his view of Islam and can be reconciled or even
equated with modern ideas. 124 This approach characterises Abduh as a representative of Islamic modernism.

Bahá’u’lláh and Abduh definitely differ in their assessment of the modern relevance of Islam. Whereas
Abduh tries to re-universalise Islam for modernity, Bahá’u’lláh intends to overcome Islam and to re-univer-
salis e religion by establishing a new one. What promoted conversion to the Bahá’í Faith from Muslims and
members of the religious minorities in Iran at the end of the last century was the “combination of traditional
religious symbolism and modernis tic or rationalist argumentation.”125 For the converts, Bahá’u’lláh preserved
the essence of past religions while actualising it to the modern context. The good parts of tradition were kept
and completed with modern ideas. Such a characterisation mutatis mutandis applies to Abduh’s approach as
well. Although never leaving Islam, Abduh attempts to give an updated vers ion of his religion, preserving ele-
ments of tradition that are authentic and essential and harmonising them with modernity. Bahá’u’lláh and
Abduh have the objective in common to integrate modern values in a religious framework to counter the neg-
ative developments that are inseparably connected with the dialectics of modernity. The German sociologist
Max Weber describes this dialectics by characterising the rationalising drive of modernity as making the world
orderly and reliable but not meaningful. 126 Bahá’u’lláh and Abduh try to provide modern life in a rationalised
and disenchanted world with religious meaning. No matter how one assesses the success of both to reconcile
religion and modernity in their theologies, this issue is not only relevant to Middle Easterners in the Nineteenth
Century, but remains an important issue in the present. The rapid spread of Western modernity through the
forces of globalisation at the end of the Twentieth Century makes the conservation of a distinct cultural and
religious identity even more difficult. In an increasingly secular environment, living a religious life becomes
actually more challenging. Hence, the struggle for a religious identity will continue and affects Muslims,
Bahá’ís and other religionists alike.
