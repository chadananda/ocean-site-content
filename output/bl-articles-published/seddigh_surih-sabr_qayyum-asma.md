 Tablet of Patience (Surih Íabr): Declaration of

Bahá’u’lláh and Selected Topics

Foad Seddigh

Abstract

This paper takes a closer look at Surih Íabr (Súriy-i-Íabr) — a
Tablet which is sometimes referred to by other names. This
Tablet of Bahá’u’lláh, which was revealed on the first day of
Ri∂ván 1863 and has great significance among the Writings of
Bahá’u’lláh, is the subject of study in this paper. In order to
better understand the contents of this Tablet, it is helpful to
review events in the life of Bahá’u’lláh during the last few weeks
prior to his exile to Istanbul (Constantinople) and Adrianople
(Edirne).

Íabr is an Arabic word meaning patience, and Surih Íabr
(Súriy-i-Íabr) derives its name from the attribute of ‘patience,’
which is the starting theme of this Tablet. In life, troubles might
strike a person as a test for which patience is needed. In such
occasions, one needs to be steadfast and loyal to one’s Lord.
This paper explores the relationship between troubles in the
path of God, divine tests and steadfastness during times of
tests. Ayyúb (Job) is one of the prophets of Israel who has
exhibited these qualities, having lived a life synonymous with
patience. Bahá’u’lláh, while stating the story of the life of
Ayyúb (Job) in this Tablet, writes some passages which may be
interpreted as a statement of His own revelation from the
tongue of Ayyúb. These statements are identified in this paper.
In the Tablet, the life history of Ayyúb is briefly reviewed.
Ayyúb is also a name which has been conferred by Bahá’u’lláh

356                                           Lights of Irfán vol. 15

on an individual who showed the attribute of patience in the
path of God and was steadfast in allegiance to his Lord, the Báb.
The Tablet immortalized the life of Óájí Mu˙ammad-Taqí
Nayrízí, who was no longer living when the Tablet was revealed.
This paper touches upon the sacrifices of this devoted believer.
Significance of the devotion and heroic acts of Siyyid Ya˙yá
Dárábi, Va˙íd, in Nayríz has been discussed, and offering his
life for his beloved, the Exalted One, the Primal Point, has been
compared to the martyrdom of the Imám Óusayn, to which a
reference has been made in the Tablet. Similarities between the
lives of these two spiritual towers have been drawn.

The Tablet covers a range of topics such as: Seal of
Prophets, Beholding the Countenance of God, Appearance of
God in the Shelter of Clouds, attaining the presence of God,
Great Announcement, the Hour, Day of Resurrection, the
Trumpet Call, and clarification of other puzzling references in
the past scriptures, particularly the holy Qur’án, etc. Most of
these topics have been dealt with in greater details, in books
such as the Kitáb-i-ˆqán, Book of Certitude, and Gems of
Divine Mysteries, which were revealed before this Tablet.
However, topics such as these which are presented in the Tablet,
important as they may seem, may not constitute the primary
significance of this Tablet. Rather, in my view, the primary
significance of this Tablet lies in clarifying the manner of
announcement of Bahá’u’lláh’s station, when He left Baghdád,
and in references made to His station as the Promised One of
the Dispensation of the Báb. The Tablet does not include
explicit phrases stating: I am ‘Him Whom God shall make
manifest’ — phrases which would clearly proclaim and
pronounce that He is “the Promised One of the Bayán.”
However, in the Tablet, Bahá’u’lláh announces that a new Light
is being shed upon the world and a new Song is being sung. It
would appear the time may not have been ripe for making the
announcement openly, clearly and widely. This paper also
discusses and analyzes the Tablet’s references to His station and
the new religion of God. There are several passages in the Tablet

Tablet of Patience                                           357

which clearly indicate that those pure souls who expected Him
to put a claim to a station needed to wait and be patient. He
also stresses that once He has made this announcement, it is not
proper for them to hesitate for a moment, and if they stop for a
moment, despite their long patience, the pronouncement of
‘patient one’ can no longer be applied to them.

The Tablet also makes reference to the Qayyúmu’l-Asmá. In
this paper, Qayyúmu’l-Asmá has been discussed and the
references made in the Tablet regarding ‘two names’, ‘two
dawning places’, ‘two mysteries’ , etc. have been traced and
identified in Qayyúmu’l-Asmá. The Tablet does not explicitly
mention the name of the arch enemy of the ‘Light of God’, the
half-brother of Bahá’u’lláh, Ya˙yá Azal. However, the Tablet
includes several references to Ya˙yá such as the “Calf” and
“Sámirí”. These references are identified and explained. At the
end of the Tablet, Bahá’u’lláh bids farewell to the friends in
elevating and exalting words, in a manner which could be
interpreted that as a result of this separation, something
profound is bound to happen. However, the Tablet does not
pinpoint the nature of the occurrence. This may be considered
the announcement of His station as the Promised One of the
Bayán in an unequivocal manner in Adrianople — an action
which led to the rebellion of His half-brother, Ya˙yá Azal.

In this paper, Bahá’u’lláh’s parting words and their meanings
are also analyzed. The Tablet includes a prophecy and warning
regarding the ‘birds of darkness’ which will start flying in the
absence of the light — a reference which may be considered the
‘Light of His Countenance’. These passages have been identified
and their meanings explored.

Introduction and Background

In the few years prior to Bahá’u’lláh’s departure from ‘Iráq,
three processes were unfolding. (1) The first was the increasing
reverence which the Bábís felt for and showed towards
Bahá’u’lláh as well as the great respect with which some high

358                                           Lights of Irfán vol. 15

ranking officials of the Government and Iranians treated Him.
(2) The second was the envy of the half-brother of Bahá’u’lláh,
Mírzá Ya˙yá, the Nominee of the Báb, whose jealousy and lust
for leadership was burning within his heart and consuming him
day by day. Mírzá Ya˙yá could manage to attract to himself
only those corrupt Bábís who desired leadership for themselves,
and whose selfish inclinations prompted them to lust after the
benefits of the material world. (3) The third was the enmity and
hatred towards Bahá’u’lláh which was initiated and aggravated
by the Muslim clergy, and accepted blindly by those fanatical
elements who considered that He had violated the established
norms of Islám.

In order to demonstrate the particulars of the first process,
we may recall two stories from this period — for details, one
may refer to the history books: Bahá’u’lláh King of Glory, or
The Revelation of Bahá’u’lláh, vol. I. The first story is
concerning Siyyid Ismá’íl of Zavárih who, after hearing some
thrilling words of spiritual significance from Bahá’u’lláh, was so
intoxicated with His love that he was unable to restrain himself
from his strong desire to leave the material world.1 The second
story concerns the incident when both Mullá Íádiq-i-Khurásání
and Nabíl-i-Akbar were in the House of Bahá’u’lláh, when
suddenly He entered the room where they were sitting. Mullá
Íádiq instantly prostrated himself before Bahá’u’lláh. After
Bahá’u’lláh withdrew from the room, Nabíl-i-Akbar being
conscious of the great standing that Mullá Íádiq had in the Bábí
community, felt that Mullá Íádiq’s humility towards Bahá’u’lláh
was quite inappropriate and protested in strong language. Mullá
Íádiq’s response was: “You don’t know Him.”2 These two
stories were not isolated instances, and one can recount many
more which clearly show the standing of Bahá’u’lláh in the Bábí
community. Despite this, Bahá’u’lláh did not deem the time ripe
to lay bare His own station, and the Fire which had been kindled
in His soul. He was actually trying to conceal this Fire.
Bahá’u’lláh has mentioned that the light within Him could show
dimly beyond seventy thousand veils (in some other writings He

Tablet of Patience                                                359

mentions a thousand veils) enwrapped around Him in order to
cover this Fire and Light.

The second process is a direct result of the respect of the
Bábí community towards Bahá’u’lláh, which produced envy and
jealously in the heart of Mírzá Ya˙yá, who was devoid of any
spiritual qualities himself. This inadequacy made him incapable
of instilling spiritual qualities in others. This situation led to his
jealously and ill-feeling towards Bahá’u’lláh.

The third process which had derived its intensity from the
first process, but in an opposite direction, hoped to extinguish
that Fire combining all the forces of opposition from the
mischief-makers. It included the corrupt cleric known as
“Shaykh ‘Abdu’l-Óusayn ˇihrání,” the Consul General of Iran in
Baghdád, the Persian Ambassador to the Government of
Ottoman Empire, the Iranian Foreign Minister and his
counterpart in Istanbul, and finally two powerful monarchs of
the time. These combined forces of opposition led to the
decision to banish Bahá’u’lláh and His companions from ‘Iráq
to a remote land beyond the Iranian borders.

On the other hand, the exile from ‘Iráq was the intervention
of a divinely ordained decree to partially remove the veils which
had concealed the Spiritual Light within Bahá’u’lláh, a Light that
had illumined the horizon of ‘Iráq and had dazzled the eyes of
so many believers who gathered around him, and had become
vivified and sanctified from the stains of this world. This was at
a time when the Faith of the Báb was on the verge of extinction
as a result of the heavy blows dealt by the combined forces of
the government and clerics. So, the departure of Bahá’u’lláh
from ‘Iráq was as a result of the combination of both divinely
ordered decree and the forces of opposition. It has been
recorded that Bahá’u’lláh finally left the “Most Great House” in
Baghdád in the afternoon of Wednesday, 22 April 1863 and
crossed the river Tigris by boat with only a few of his family
members around him. He stayed in the garden of Najíb Páshá
for twelve days in order to make preparations for the long

360                                            Lights of Irfán vol. 15

journey ahead, and also to say good-bye to a large number of
visitors. He had arrived in Baghdád, on April 8, 1853 and
resided in ‘Iráq for ten (solar) years and fourteen days.

Tablet of Job and Its Particulars

On the first day of His stay in the garden of Najíb Páshá,
known as the Garden of Ri∂ván, Bahá’u’lláh revealed the Tablet
of the Medina of Patience or Tablet of the Secured City of
Patience. In numerous instances in this Tablet, He refers to the
Fire and Light within Him and encourages his companions to
explore it and to approach it — though it is not an all-out
declaration of His Mission. His “public declaration” took place
a year later in Adrianople (Edirne). This Tablet is quite lengthy
and is entirely in Arabic. There is no authorized translation of
this Tablet made into English yet. However, there is a
provisional translation made by Dr. Khazeh Fananapazir which
is being used in this paper. One can find this work in the web
site of the Bahá’í Library Online, www.bahai-library.com, under
the heading of Provisional Translations.3 A few sentences or
phrases of the Tablet quoted in this paper are the translation of
the present author; these are identified by an asterisk: *.

Start of the Tablet

The Tablet starts in the following manner:

> This is the City of Patience. Strive ye to enter it, O
> concourse of the patient ones!

> In His name, the Exalted One, He Who is the Most
> Exalted

> This is the remembrance of God in the City of Patience
> regarding Job, Our servant; Whom We sheltered under
> the shade of that Holy Tree planted in His heart, to
> Whom We demonstrated the fire ignited in His Own
> Essence….
Tablet of Patience                                          361

This Tablet is also known by other names such as: Súriy-i-Íabr,
Tablet of Job, Tablet of Íabr, Surih Íabr, Lawh-i-Ayyúb. It was
revealed in the honor of Óájí Mu˙ammad-Taqí surnamed Ayyúb
who was not alive at the time of the revelation of the Tablet.
Hereafter, in this paper, we will refer to this Tablet as Surih
Íabr.

Medina of Patience: the City of Patience

Medina is an Arabic word meaning “city” which is protected
and fortified, making it safe to inhabit because it is guarded
against attackers and invaders. So the “Medina of Patience”
conveys the concept of a dwelling-place of patience which is
safe and secure. In other words, it conveys the idea that
dwelling in patience provides some security for one’s soul.
Bahá’u’lláh has revealed a number of tablets in which He invites
people to enter the Medina of the theme of the tablet.
Examples: Tablet of Medina of Unity of God, and Tablet of
Medina of Good Pleasure of God.

The Exalted One

The word Exalted and its derivations (exalted means “high”,
“lofty”) is one of the Names of God. In Arabic it is A‘lá.
Believers matched the number for the name of the Báb, “‘Alí
Mu˙ammad” which has the numerical value of 202 in the Abjad
system, with “Rabb” which means “Lord”, and called Him
“Rabb-i-A‘lá.” Most often in the Writings of Bahá’u’lláh and
‘Abdu’l-Bahá whenever there is a reference made to the “Exalted
Lord” or Exalted One”, or “Exalted”, it refers to His Holiness
the Báb. ‘Alí, which is the first name of the Báb, is also a
derivation from the same word, meaning “Exalted,” and
Mu˙ammad, which is the second part of His name, means
“Praised”.

362                                              Lights of Irfán vol. 15

The Remembrance of God

In the Holy Qur’án, the word “Remembrance” or “Calling to
Mind” is a reference to the Qur’án itself and also to the Prophet
Mu˙ammad. In this Holy Dispensation, the Báb has referred to
Himself as “Remembrance of God”. Bahá’u’lláh has referred to
the Báb as the “Most Great Remembrance of God.”

The Burning Tree and Sacred Spot

> Divine Lote Tree planted in His heart, and made Him to
> witness the Fire which is ignited and sheds its radiance

This part of the Tablet is also a reference to the Tree which
gives light and is burning. The historical reference for the
“Tree” and “Fire” is the story of the prophet Moses who saw a
fire from a distance and when approached it and came near it,
he found a tree which was burning but the fire was not
consuming it. The tree has been referred to as the “Divine Lote
Tree”, “The Tree which is neither of the East nor of the West”,
“Sadratu’l-Muntahá”, “Divine and Holy Tree”. They have been
interpreted as being the Word of God within the Manifestation
of God.

In the Tablet there is a reference to “the Sacred Spot” and
“the Tree” and “the Fire”. These are used quite frequently in the
Writings of this Holy Dispensation, and in the Qur’án as well.
As an example, consider this verse of Qur’án:

> And when he reached it, he was called from the right side
> of the valley in the blessed field, from the tree: O Moses!
> Lo! I, even I, am Alláh, the Lord of the Worlds. (Surih Al-
> Qasas, Surih 28, Verse 30)

The above verse is related to the story of Moses. Now, we may
take a look at the verse in the Tablet: “We called Job from this
sacred Spot whose environs are sanctified with this call, ‘Verily,
He is God, Thy Lord and the Lord of all things. He is All-

Tablet of Patience                                                   363

Powerful over all things, the Self-Subsisting One.’” There are
great similarities between these two expressions as follows: “The
Spot” is that same place where Moses stood and was “the right
side of the valley in the blessed field” which is a reference to the
realm of “Manifestation of God” appearing within Him and
within other Manifestations of God. The Fire may be taken as
the Word of God which is expressed by the Manifestation of
God.

Job, the Prophet

> Noah’s flood is but the measure of the tears I have shed,
> and Abraham’s fire an ebullition of My soul. Jacob’s
> grief is but a reflection of My sorrows, and Job’s
> afflictions a fraction of my calamity. (Qasídiy-i-Varqá’iyyih,
> The Ode of Dove)

The Tablet starts with the explanation of the life of Job. Job
is one of the most mysterious figures in the Bible. The era in
which Job lived, the location of his native land and his teachings
are all shrouded in mystery. Some Jewish scholars even have
gone so far as to deny his existence and consider his life as a
fable. Due to the fact that his book and life story appear in the
Old Testament, and in the light of references made to him in the
New Testament, one can consider him as one of the prophets,
but not within the religion of Moses. The Qur’án and Islám
regard Him a prophet. On the basis of Islám, which brought the
latest spiritual teachings to mankind before the Teachings of the
Báb and Bahá’u’lláh, there is no doubt regarding Job’s identity
as a Prophet of God. His life story is one of patience and is
associated with gratitude to whatever comes one’s way, whether
it bode well or ill. Certainly Job demonstrated this quality.
Bahá’u’lláh has chosen Job in the tablet of “Medina of
Patience” to teach us some spiritual truths, while recalling the
events of his life, based mostly on the Islamic traditions. If we
look carefully, some of those qualities and events match
Bahá’u’lláh’s life; He uses the story of the biblical Job as the

364                                            Lights of Irfán vol. 15

basis to expound His own message. Also, we should remember
that this Tablet was revealed in the honor of Óájí Mu˙ammad-
Taqí of Nayríz who endured great hardships in the path of his
Lord and was no longer alive at the time of the revelation of
this tablet.

From the Book of Job in the Old Testament, chapter 1,
verses 1-3, it is stated:

> There was a man in the land of Uz, whose name was Job;
> and that man was blameless, upright, fearing God, and
> turning away from evil. And seven sons and three
> daughters were born to him. His possessions also was
> 7,000 sheep, 3,000 camels, 500 yoke of oxen, 500 female
> donkeys, and very many servants; so that man was the
> greatest of all the men of the east.4

And chapter 1, verses 8-10, from the same book:

> And the Lord said to Satan, “Have you considered My
> servant Job? For there is no one like him in the earth, a
> blameless and upright man, fearing God and turning
> away from evil.” Then Satan answered the Lord, and
> said, “Does Job fear God for nothing? Hast thou not
> made a hedge about him and about his house and all that
> he has, on every side? Thou hast blessed the work of his
> hands, and his possessions have increased in the land…”5

After all his substance and health were taken away from him,
he thanked his Lord; chapter 1, verses 20-22, from the same
book:

> Then Job arose, and tore his robe, and shaved his head,
> and he fell to the ground, and worshipped. And he said,
> ‘Naked I came from my mother’s womb. And naked shall
> I return there. The LORD gave and the Lord has taken
> away. Blessed be the name of the Lord.’ Through all this
> Job did not sin, nor did he blame God.6

Then God restores wealth to Job after had taken away from
him, chapter 42: verses 10-12 from the same book:

> And the Lord restored the fortunes of Job when he
> prayed for his friends, and the Lord increased all that
> Job had twofold. Then all his brothers, and all his sisters,
> and all who had known him before, came to him and they
> ate bread with him in his house, and they consoled him
> and comforted him for all the evil that the Lord had
> brought on him. And each one gave him one piece of
> money, and each a ring of gold. And the Lord blessed the
> latter days of Job more than his beginning, and he had
> 14,000 sheep, and 6,000 camels, and a 1,000 yoke of
> oxen, and 1,000 female donkeys.7

Major Themes of the Tablet

We may identify nine major themes in the Tablet and nearly
one hundred themes which can be considered as secondary
themes, as well as many other references which require
reflection and elaboration. While any of the large number of
themes could serve as the focus for a study, we list some of
these themes below:

> 1. Life of Job and how He endured calamities,
> 2. Patience and the reward for patient ones,
3. The events of Nayríz and sacrifice of the believers and

Va˙íd,
4. Fundamental religious truths: First and Last, resurrection,

day of Judgments, etc.,
> 5. References to religious leaders and divines,
6. References to the statements of the Báb concerning

Bahá’u’lláh’s Revelation,
> 7. References regarding His own revelation,
> 8. References to the Calf, Sámirí, Satan, and Birds of Night,
366                                              Lights of Irfán vol. 15

9. Farewell and Separation.

In this paper, we will discuss themes 1, 2, 5, 7, 8 and will briefly
consider themes 3, 6 and 9. Theme number 4, despite its
significance, and the number of pages devoted to this theme in
the Tablet, will not be considered here.

Patience and Being Thankful under Calamities

The life of Job is an embodiment of endurance under
calamities and being content with whatever befell him in the
path of God, while exhibiting contentment with the will of God.
In the Tablet Bahá’u’lláh states:

> Loss engulfed Him as had been ordained by the Mighty,
> the Self-Subsisting One. We burnt what He had planted
> by the hands of the angels of God’s command and
> everything was utterly lost. When We had cleansed Him
> of earthly ornaments and material pollution, and had
> purified Him of physical possessions, then, as a further
> test, We caused the angels of divine wrath to blow
> poisonous air on His skin, making His body weaken, His
> temple tremble, and His limbs quiver so much that no
> portion of His being was left uncovered by wounds, and
> yet, in all these states, His gratitude increased daily. He
> remained patient and did not complain. We thus
> accounted Him of those who trust and are patient and
> grateful.

The book of Job, in minute details, describes how
misfortunes struck Job. However, it does not discuss why these
troubles are essential for spiritual growth. It is left entirely to
the reader of this book to deduce it for himself. However,
Bahá’u’lláh reveals in the Tablet that these difficulties are tests
and no one can claim rightly to be a Servant of God and lover
of God if he does not pass the tests. Furthermore, Bahá’u’lláh
states that:

1. “O peoples of the earth! Be patient and persevering in the

> path of God and do not sorrow about that which will
> befall you in these “Days of the Spirit”.
2. “Soon ye shall see the recompense of the patient ones in

> the transcendent and holy Garden:
• In truth God has created a Paradise in the retreats of

> immortality and has named it “patience”. Its name was
> treasured in the immaculate treasures of God up to the
> present Day. And in it was ordained what was not
> ordained in all other gardens and We have at this
> moment unveiled it for you and caused it to be
> remembered by you as a mercy on Our part to all the
> worlds. And in this paradise there are rivers of the
> providence of God and God has forbidden it from
> anyone except those who have persevered in calamities
> seeking thereby the good pleasure of God. None shall
> enter these gardens except such as have not perverted
> the bounty of God in themselves and flew with the
> wings of might in the atmosphere of patience.
• These are they who have been long-suffering in all

> tribulations and the more the tribulations increased
> their love for their Lord waxed greater and with their
> entire being they turned to the exalted and holy One.
• The ecstasies of desire grew intense in their hearts and

> the breaths of enthusiasm became great in their being so
> much so and they gave of their wealth and they gave all
> that vouchsafed by God to them and in all those states
> they were grateful to their Lord and they did not seek
> help from any one and God inscribed the names of the

As stated in these passages, calamities in the path of God are
spiritual tests and that is why God sent these troubles to Job.
Five years before revealing this Tablet, Bahá’u’lláh revealed in
His Hidden Words a number of passages regarding calamities
which we should regard inwardly as light and life:

> “O SON OF MAN! For everything there is a sign. The
> sign of love is fortitude under My decree and patience
> under My trials.” [HW]

> “O SON OF MAN! The true lover yearneth for
> tribulation even as doth the rebel for forgiveness and the
> sinful for mercy.” [HW]

> “O SON OF MAN! If adversity befalls thee not in My
> path, how canst thou walk in the ways of them that are
> content with My pleasure? If trials afflict thee not in thy
> longing to meet Me, how wilt thou attain the light in thy
> love for My beauty?” [HW]

> “O SON OF MAN! My calamity is My providence,
> outwardly it is fire and vengeance, but inwardly it is
> light and mercy. Hasten thereunto that thou mayest
> become an eternal light and an immortal spirit. This is
> My command unto thee, do thou observe it.” [HW]

Upheaval of Nayríz

The major theme with which the Tablet starts is the life of
Job who was patient under tribulations and God’s decree.
Essentially, the three themes in the Tablet (the life of Job,
tribulations, and patience) all served the purpose of introducing
the events in Nayríz. The embodiment of patience is Óájí
Mu˙ammad-Taqí whose virtues Bahá’u’lláh has recounted and
extoled in this Tablet. He is a native of Nayríz, a small town to
the south east of Shíráz at a distance of about one hundred and
fifty km. Nayríz is very close to, and in the proximity of,
another small town called “Dáráb”. Were it not for Va˙íd,
Nayríz would have been forgotten by historians, in the same
manner as has been the fate of many other small towns in the
world. If we refer to the text of the Tablet, we find that many
blessings are conferred on this land, its people, its vegetation,
and its air. It is clear then that Nayríz has a unique position in
the history of the world.

Dáráb is the birth place of Va˙íd (Yazd also has been
mentioned), whose given name is Ya˙yá. By the virtue of the
fact that he was from the lineage of Mu˙ammad, his full name
was Siyyid Ya˙yá Dárábi. Va˙íd’s father was an eminent clergy
and a man of great knowledge and was a fellow-pilgrim at the
time of the pilgrimage of the Báb. The Báb has honored him by
making mention of him in the Qayyúmu’l-Asmá. At the time of
the declaration of the Báb, Va˙íd’s father was living in one of
the western cities of Iran. At this time, Siyyid Ya˙yá Dárábí had
reached a degree of knowledge and fame in the capital city of
Iran which resulted in Mu˙ammad Sháh having great confidence
in him. The monarch of the time charged him with the
responsibility of travelling to Shíráz, in order to investigate the
message of the Báb. It is stated that he had three interviews with
the Báb, which are well documented, after which he became a
firm believer. For further details refer to the Dawn Breakers.8
The Báb revealed a commentary on the Surih of Kawthar (one of
the surihs of Qur’án) for him.

The following text is an extract from A Traveler’s Narrative,
a brief history of the Faith by ‘Abdu’l-Bahá:

> When the above-mentioned Siyyid arrived at Shíráz he
> interviewed the Báb three times. In the first and second
> conferences questioning and answering took place; in the
> third conference he requested a commentary on the Súrih
> called Kawthar, and when the Báb, without thought or
> reflection, wrote an elaborate commentary on the
> Kawthar in his presence, the above-mentioned Siyyid was
> charmed and enraptured with Him, and straightaway,
> without consideration for the future or anxiety about
> the results of this affection, hastened to Burújird to his
> father Siyyid Ja’far, known as Kashfí, and acquainted
> him with the matter. And, although he was wise and
> prudent and was wont to have regard to the
> requirements of the time, he wrote without fear or care a
> detailed account of his observations to Mírzá Lutf-’Alí

> the chamberlain in order that the latter might submit it
> to the notice of the late king, while he himself journeyed
> to all parts of Persia, and in every town and station
> summoned the people from the pulpit-tops in such wise
> that other learned doctors decided that he must be mad,
> accounting it a sure case of bewitchment.9

The Báb gave him the title of Va˙íd. This word numerically is
equivalent to the number of his first name, Ya˙yá, and means
“unique.” Bahá’u’lláh in the Book of Certitude (Kitáb-i-ˆqán)
pronounced him the unique and peerless: “Among them also was
Siyyid Ya˙yá, that unique and peerless figure of his age”. [KI
223] Also, the Báb had testified to his unique qualities in His
Dalá’il-i-Sab’ih (Seven Proofs): “high attainments in the realm of
science and philosophy.” In short, Va˙íd was an accomplished
cleric and man of great capacity with unbounded love for the
Báb.

For the spiritual exploits of Va˙íd and further explanation
and details, refer to Dawn Breakers10 and Awakening.11 While
the Báb was still imprisoned in a fortress in the mountains of
Ádhirbayján (in the fortress of Chihríq), Va˙íd travelled to the
south eastern city of Yazd and made an open proclamation of
the Faith of the Báb to the people of that city who responded to
his call instantly. This caused much uproar in the city. Because
of his public proclamation of the Cause of the Báb, great
agitations and open confrontation ensued, which placed his life
and the lives of many others in great danger. Therefore, Va˙íd
had to leave the city of Yazd for his native land of Dáráb and
eventually for Nayríz. The time of his arrival to this area was
about two months before the martyrdom of the Báb, on 27 May
1850\.12

The conflagration at Nayríz is a direct result of the courage,
faith and self-sacrifice of Va˙íd with his public proclamation of
the New Cause of God to the public at large in the villages and
towns on the way from Yazd to Nayríz. As a result of his
efforts, thousands of the inhabitants of Nayríz and the

372                                           Lights of Irfán vol. 15

surrounding villages and towns embraced the Cause of God,
including Óájí Mu˙ammad-Taqí, whose name has been
mentioned in the Tablet and in whose honor the Tablet was
revealed. The conversion of a large number of people to the
Cause of the Báb led to strong action by the governor of the
town, Zaynu’l-Ábidín Khán, and eventually confrontation
between the companions of Va˙íd and the army of the
governor. The army surrounded the believers who had gathered
in an abandoned fort outside of the town (fort of Khájih), and
started establishing fortification of the fort for their own
defense. Therefore, the fort of Khájih became the storm-center
of the conflagration in Nayríz. It is stated that Óájí
Mu˙ammad-Taqí was quite wealthy, and he decided to sacrifice
his wealth by providing provisions for those who had taken
refuge in the fort. Despite heavy artillery assistance which the
governor of Nayríz received from the Governor of the province
of Fárs, Prince Fírúz Mírzá, his troops were defeated three times
by Bábís gathered in the fort.

Since they realized that they could not win this conflict with
the sheer force of guns and soldiers, the Governor and his men
decided to resort to treachery and craftiness. They made a
solemn oath on the holy Qur’án and sealed it to indicate that
they would honor their statements and asked Va˙íd to visit their
army headquarters. Va˙íd was well aware of their intention, but
due to his respect for their oath on the Qur’án, he said that he
would go there to see what God had decreed. After his arrival in
the army camp the Prince and his men showed initial respect
towards Va˙íd. However, this was a scheme, as eventually, they
laid their hands on Va˙íd and killed him. Many of the believers
in the fort were also killed and the women and children captured
and their properties plundered. In particular the governor
captured and imprisoned Óájí Mu˙ammad-Taqí (along with
several others) in the basement of his residence and tortured him
for nine months.13 At the end, the Óájí gained his freedom in a
miraculous way and after recovering from his wounds and
gaining his health he went to Baghdád to meet Bahá’u’lláh.

The following are extracts from the Tablet regarding Va˙íd,
believers and Nayríz:
o Days passed until …. a group of people from the town …

gathered around Va˙íd
o These people:

> •    Obeyed the commands of God,
> •    Circled around his cause,
> •    Sacrificed their wealth,
•    Gave up everything they had of the treasures of this

world
> •    Were not frightened of anyone
•    Their hearts were like iron in the aim to render

victory to God,
•    No blame from the blamer attached to them, no

objection prevented them,
•    Rather they were exalted in the cities of God like holy

and uplifted ensigns.
o Chieftain of the army of tyranny: was the most wicked

man of the earth,
o He chooses to confer His mercy upon those who have

detached themselves of all earthly things,
o If the station of anyone of you (believers Nayríz) should

> become clear all the peoples will give their lives in their
> desire for this station created by the hand of God. But
> this station is hidden from the eyes of men
o They decided to send to Va˙íd an envoy with a tongue of

falsehood and deception
o When they were impotent to defeat the party of God and

> His loved ones, they engaged in many deliberations and
> arranged a deception
374                                             Lights of Irfán vol. 15

o We admit that you (Va˙íd) have the dignity and honor

above us
o Address of Va˙íd to the chiefs of army and his wise

> counsel to them and his reasoning with them:
•   If you admit that I am a descendent of the Prophet of

God, why have you attacked me?

> •   Why have you encircled our people?
•   Why have you turned away from the cause of God

and rebelled against him?

> •   O People! Fear God
> •   Do not perpetrate mischief in God’s earth
•   Do not abandon the true religion of God behind your

backs
> •   Fear God who has created you and nourished you
> •   The world will pass away, your armies will disappear
> •   Consider what happened to the nations of the past
> •   I am nothing but a servant who has believed in God
•   If you are not pleased with me, I shall travel away

from you
> •   Fear God and do not shed the blood of His lovers
> •   Do not take in vain the property of people
> •   Do not disbelieve after your claims of belief.
Some quotes from the Tablet concerning the episode of
Nayríz are given below:

> Those who assist God with their wealth and their lives
> and who are patient under all conditions of hardship for
> the purpose of attracting God’s good pleasure these are
> the ones who shall attain victory for all eternity. Such
> people even if they are killed or burned because they
> have been created of the spirit shall always soar in the

> spiritual atmosphere through God’s permission. These
> shall not attend to their bodies in this world and these
> seek sufferings in the path of God as a sinner seeks
> forgiveness, as a babe seeks the breast milk given to it by
> the mercy of God thus does the nightingale remind you
> with spiritual recollections so that men may detach
> themselves from their own self, their money and wealth
> and to return to the holy and clear presence.…

> O people of Nayríz! Thank ye God your creator who

It is a historical fact that the atrocities in Nayríz against the
believers did not end in 1850 with the martyrdom of Va˙íd and
his companions. There were two other episodes of great
proportion in which hundreds of lives were lost, one in 1852/53
and another one in 1909. However, in between these major
episodes, animosities existed at much lower intensity. For this
reason, statements in the Tablet reflect this reality. Baha’u’llah
refers to the persecution of the believers in Nayríz as something
which happened year after year. For details refer to the book
Awakening.

References to Religious Leaders, Divines and Learned

Bahá’u’lláh, in the Kitáb-i-ˆqán and other tablets, has
rebuked religious leaders for a variety of charges. This includes
lack of understanding the Scriptures, interpreting the Scriptures
without having authority according to their own limited
understanding, greed and attachment to the worldly desires,
misleading people for their own benefits and killing the
Manifestations of God, etc. The Báb was also critical of the
learned men of religion. He wrote:

> It is recorded in a tradition that of the entire concourse
> of the Christians no more than seventy people embraced
> the Faith of the Apostle of God. The blame falleth upon
> their doctors, for if these had believed, they would have
> been followed by the mass of their countrymen. Behold,
> then, that which hath come to pass! The learned men of
> Christendom are held to be learned by virtue of their
> safeguarding the teaching of Christ, and yet consider

> how they themselves have been the cause of men’s failure
> to accept the Faith and attain unto salvation! [SWB 123]

In this Tablet, Bahá’u’lláh has called learned men the worst
kind of people, to the extent that the quintessence of evil runs
away from them. If we study the schemes of Shaykh ‘Abdu’l-
Óusayn ˇihrání, and troubles that he created for Bahá’u’lláh in
Baghdád which led to His exile, this would clearly demonstrate
why such a pronouncement has been made against “learned
men” as a whole. Bahá’u’lláh in other tablets has referred to this
learned mujtahid as: “scoundrel,” the “schemer,” the “wicked
one,” who “drew the sword of his self against the face of God,”
“in whose soul Satan hath whispered,” and “from whose impiety
Satan flies,” the “depraved one,” “from whom originated and to
whom will return all infidelity, cruelty and crime.” [GPB 141]
Unfortunately, many such references describe a large number of
the learned men at the time of Bahá’u’lláh. The history of the
faith of God has recorded the names of hundreds, nay
thousands, of such men of learning in the garb of divines who
were the essence of ignorance, impiety and injustice. There are
always exceptions to this rule. Bahá’u’lláh, for example, has
praised the fairness of Shaykh Murta∂áy-i-Ansárí. Shaykh
Ma˙múd-i-Álúsí, the Muftí of Baghdád, was also one of
Bahá’u’lláh’s great admirers.

A summary of some of the statements in the Surih Íabr
regarding the learned divines is given below:
o They whom you have taken to be lords beside the One

> True God do not have names or essences mentionable in
> the sight of God
o They to whom you attribute knowledge and have

> accepted them as your divines they are in the sight of
> God the worst of men
o We testify that they have not drunk from the fountains

of knowledge
378                                             Lights of Irfán vol. 15

o Nothing of rejection and denial against a prophet or a

> successor of a prophet has come to pass except after
> their permission.

> o “Learned men” are not well grounded in knowledge.
o You have shed the blood of people whom the eyes of

existence have not seen like them.
o You have followed those who are not prepared to lose an

atom of their prestige in the path of God.
o Their greatest endeavor in this world is to eat of the

> peoples’ property and to sit at the high place in the
> assemblies of people and in all of this is their sole glory
> upon the peoples of the world.
o Say to them, by God, if only you could have any

> awareness in yourselves even less than a moment, you
> would erase all your books that you have written without
> God’s permission and you would hit your heads and you
> would flee from your own homes and you would live in
> mountains and you would feed yourselves only the dust
> of the earth.
o Do not rejoice in your deeds for you shall soon return to

> God and you shall face the resurrection in the mighty
> arena on a day which will result in the quaking of the
> limbs of all creation.
o Soon will these wrongdoers say while sunk in the lowest

> grades of hellfire would to God that we had not taken
> these divines to be friends for us.
We should note that the passages addressed to the clergy and
men of learning are scattered throughout the Tablet. Each such
passage is connected to a particular theme in which the clergy
played a role. In a number of instances in the Tablet,
Bahá’u’lláh refers to divines and learned men as follows:

> Say I swear by God! They to whom you attribute
> knowledge and have accepted them as your divines they
> are in the sight of God the worst of men nay the
> quintessence of evil flees from them….

> We testify that they have not drunk from the fountains
> of knowledge and they have not attained unto a word of
> Wisdom and have not become aware of the mysteries of
> Revelation and have been racing in the land of their
> selfish desires….

> O people! Fear God and take not knowledge from
> muddied fountains that flow from a source of self and
> ignorance. Take ye your portion from sweet flowing,
> unsullied, waters that flow from the right hand of the
> throne and which God has apportioned for the
> righteous….

> Those who are not prepared to lose an atom of their
> prestige in the path of God. Their greatest endeavor in
> this world is to eat of the peoples’ property and to sit at
> the high place in the assemblies of people and in all of
> this is their sole glory upon the peoples of the world….

References of The Báb Concerning Bahá’u’lláh’s Revelation

The Báb referred to the Revelation of Bahá’u’lláh in His
first   Book,    Qayyúmu’l-Asmá,     using   the  expression
“Baqiyat’u’lláh” meaning “Remnant of God.” In Surih of Huzn
(Surih of Grief which is Surih 58 or chapter 58 of the book:
Qayyúmu’l-Asmá), He wrote:

> O THOU Remnant of God! I have sacrificed myself
> wholly for Thee; I have accepted curses for Thy sake,
> and have yearned for naught but martyrdom in the path
> of Thy love. Sufficient witness unto me is God, the
> Exalted, the Protector, the Ancient of Days... [SWB 59]
380                                             Lights of Irfán vol. 15

In the early stages of His mission, Siyyid ‘Alí Mu˙ammad
referred to Himself as the Báb. Those who were endowed with
spiritual perception knew exactly what he meant by the word
“Báb”. Those who were deprived of this bounty thought that He
was a point of connection with the Twelfth Imam of Shí’ah
Islam who had disappeared in what was known as the “Major
Occultation.” Some others thought that He was a “Fourth
Support” of the “Perspicuous Religion” according to Shaykhí
belief. In this regard ‘Abdu’l-Bahá writes:

> He began to speak and to declare the rank of Báb-hood.
> Now what He intended by the term Báb [Gate] was this,
> that He was the channel of grace from some great Person
> still behind the veil of glory, Who was the possessor of
> countless and boundless perfections, by Whose will He
> moved, and to the bond of Whose love He clung. And in
> the first book which He wrote in explanation of the
> Súrih of Joseph, He addressed Himself in all passages to
> that Person unseen from Whom He received help and
> grace, sought for aid in the arrangement of His
> preliminaries, and craved the sacrifice of life in the way
> of His love... [TN 4]

By the fourth year in His mission, the Báb revealed the
Bayán, the book of laws for His own dispensation — one in
Persian and another one in Arabic, and both remained
incomplete. At this point in time, it was quite clear that His
religion was an independent religion from Islam. At this time,
he wrote extensively about the “unseen Person” from Whom he
received help and called him “Him Whom God shall make
manifest” who was the promised one of the dispensation of the
Bayán — a reference to no other person than Bahá’u’lláh.
Compared to previous references to the promised one of Bayán
which were unclear and wrapped in mystery, the reference to
“Him Whom God shall make manifest” in His writings which
were written in Máh-Kú and onwards, were very clear.

In the Bayán, the Báb says that the Bayán “...is, from
beginning to end, the repository of all of His attributes, and the
treasury of both His fire and His light.” In the Persian Bayán,
Arabic Bayán, Seven Proofs, Kitab-i-Asmá and other Writings
of the Báb, there are considerable references to “Him Whom
God shall make manifest”. There are numerous references to the
“year nine” when the advent of “Him Whom God shall make
manifest” will come to fruition. Mírzá Ya˙yá Azal wrongly
interpreted and promoted the time of the appearance of the
promised one of the Bayán to be the year 2001 from the start of
the Báb’s mission14 — based on the number for the name
“Mustagháth.” While in Chihríq, the Báb revealed the Law˙-i-
Hurúfat (Tablet of the Letters) in honor of Dayyán, unraveled
the mystery of the Mustagháth, and alluded to the year nineteen
which would separate the Declaration of the Báb and that of
Bahá’u’lláh. In short, references to “Him Whom God shall make
manifest” in the Writings of the Báb are so vast that it would
be impossible to refer to a tiny fraction of it in this paper.

In the Surih Íabr, Bahá’u’lláh makes mention of the singing
of His praise in Qayyúmu’l-Asmá. This is a quote from the
Tablet:

> O Thou Quintessence of truth! Sing and chant with the
> most beauteous melodies for all the maidens of paradise
> have come out of their assemblies and their tents of
> purity that they may hear Your own melody, the melody
> that has been sung in the pages of God in the book,
> Qayyúmu’l-Asmá.

Bahá’u’lláh refers to “Qayyúmu’l-Asmá” among the writings
of the Báb as “the first, the greatest and mightiest of all books.”
[KI 231] Qayyúmu’l-Asmá is a commentary on the Surih of
Joseph in the Qur’án. The Báb has written one chapter for each
verse of this surih, a total of 111 chapters in all. He has
interpreted the reality of Joseph in an entirely new and breath-
taking manner, with numerous references to Bahá’u’lláh in the

382                                           Lights of Irfán vol. 15

book. This is why Bahá’u’lláh mentions the name of the Book in
the above passage.

It was not accidental that the Báb revealed the Qayyúmu’l-
Asmá at the start of His mission. The designation of the
promised one according to the Shí’ah is the Qá’im (He who
arises). The name “Qayyúm” is a derivation from the name
Qá’im, with a slight difference, having the meaning: “the one
who is standing.” The numerical value of Yousof (Joseph) and
Qayyúm is the same and is equal to 156. Therefore, it was
providential for the Blessed Báb to write a commentary on the
Surih of Joseph on that eventful night when He declared His
mission to Mullá Óusayn and declared Himself in reality to be
the promised Qá’im.

In the Tablet, Bahá’u’lláh further mentions:

> Thou knowest that I have now become afflicted between
> the unbelievers from two parties and Thou commandest
> in both Revelations and overseest both Dispensations
> and Thou art manifest in the Twin garments and Thou
> art resplendent through the Two Suns and have been
> mentioned with the Twin Names, possessest the Twin
> Dawning-places, commandest the secret of the Twin
> Mysteries in these Two Lines and God is fully aware
> beyond all this.

In the above passage, there are several references to some
words in the “Qayyúmu’l-Asmá” which the Báb has used to refer
to Himself and His own Revelation as well as that of
Bahá’u’lláh and His Revelation. For example, the Báb uses the
word “Twin Names”. It might mean that the name of Bahá’u’lláh
consists of two names “Óusayn” and “‘Alí “in the same way that
Báb’s name also consists of two names “‘Alí” and
“Mu˙ammad”. It might also mean that the name of the Báb and
Bahá’u’lláh are two names but one reality. Bahá’u’lláh refers, in
His Law˙-i-Maryam, to the Báb as His first name: “The wrongs
which I suffered, have blotted out the wrongs suffered by My

First Name (the Báb) from the Tablet of creation.” Similarly, in
the Surih Íabr there is a mention of “Twin Dawning-places”
which have been also used quite frequently in “Qayyúmu’l-
Asmá”, and it refers to both the Báb and Bahá’u’lláh. In all
likelihood, the word “Twin Mysteries” widely repeated in the
Tablet, has been used more than any other word in the
“Qayyúmu’l-Asmá”. Not only the “Báb,” Himself was a
mystery, rather, there was another mystery who was Bahá’u’lláh.
One can refer in particular to Surih of Zikr (Surih of
Remembrance which is surih 108 or chapter 108) for the above
references in the Tablet. For further information regarding the
“Qayyúmu’l-Asmá”, refer to the book Gate of the Heart.15

In addition to the above passage, there are a few more
references in the Tablet regarding the “Qayyúmu’l-Asmá.”
Consider the following passage:

> O Thou blood soaked Garment! Do not heed the
> misgivings of mankind rather burn asunder their veils
> and appear with thy divine ornament amongst earth and
> heaven …

“Blood soaked Garment” which is used in this passage, seems
to refer to Bahá’u’lláh Himself, as, it brings to mind the story
of Joseph and his brothers. In the Tablet, Bahá’u’lláh, without
using the name of His brother, Mírzá Ya˙yá Núrí, refers to the
oppression of His brother, because “blood soaked Garment” has
a prominent place in the story of Joseph and denotes the cruel
action of Joseph’s brothers towards him. The Báb also used this
same expression in his commentary on the surih of Joseph which
is “Qayyúmu’l-Asmá.”

Another set of words used in the Tablet, whose origins can be
traced to the Qayyúmu’l-Asmá, is “crimson and ruby.” For
example one can find this expression in this passage of the
Tablet: “Handmaidens of eternity may return to their seats in
the crimson and ruby laden chambers.” One can find this word
in numerous places in the Báb’s Writings. For example, for the

384                                           Lights of Irfán vol. 15

people of Bahá, he uses “Companions of the crimson-colored
ruby Ark,” which clearly refers to the followers of the Ancient
Beauty.

References Regarding His Own Revelation

As indicated earlier in this paper, Bahá’u’lláh received
intimation of His mission in 1853 in the Síyáh-Chál (Black Pit).
It was the birth of His Mission and we might refer to this event
as His “concealed declaration”. When He lived, as an exile, in
‘Iráq, He did not mention His experience in this regard in the
Síyáh-Chál to anyone. It was pre-ordained to conceal the light
within Him. However, in reviewing His Writings from this
period, it is quite evident that He is speaking with divine spirit
and authority. Earlier, it was mentioned that there were many
who were aware of His station, and even some of them were
awaiting His open claim to be the promised one of Bayán.16
Two names were mentioned earlier and now we can add a few
more among the believers; whose names were listed by the
Guardian:

> Four of the Báb’s cousins and His maternal uncle, Óájí
> Mírzá Siyyid Mu˙ammad; a grand-daughter of Fat˙-’Alí
> Sháh and fervent admirer of ˇáhirih, surnamed
> Varáqatu’r-Ri∂ván; the erudite Mullá Mu˙ammad-i-
> Qá’iní, surnamed Nabíl-i-Akbar; the already famous
> Mullá Íádiq-i-Khurásání, surnamed Ismu’lláhu’l-Aßdaq,
> who with Quddús had been ignominiously persecuted in
> Shíráz; Mullá Báqir, one of the Letters of the Living;
> Siyyid Asadu’lláh, surnamed Dayyán; the revered Siyyid
> Javád-i-Karbilá’í; Mírzá Mu˙ammad-Óasan and Mírzá
> Mu˙ammad-Óusayn, later immortalized by the titles of
> Sul†ánu’sh-Shuhudá and Ma˙búbu’sh-Shuhadá (King of
> Martyrs and Beloved of Martyrs) respectively; Mírzá
> Mu˙ammad-’Alíy-i-Nahrí, whose daughter, at a later
> date, was joined in wedlock to ‘Abdu’l-Bahá; the

> Mullá Mu˙ammad-i-Zarandí, surnamed Nabíl-i-’Aẓam,

> and His indefatigable disciple, had already joined the

Among the learned men who were fair minded, we can name
the renowned Ibn-i-Álúsí, the Muftí of Baghdád, Shaykh
‘Abdu’s-Salám, Shaykh ‘Abdu’l-Qádir and Siyyid Dáwúdí. All of
them sought Bahá’u’lláh’s presence, and can be regarded among
His admirers. Among the Government officials, foremost was
‘Abdu’lláh Páshá and his lieutenant Ma˙múd Áqá, and Mullá
‘Alí Mardán, a well-known Kurd. Among the distinguished
Persians, who lived in Baghdád or its nearby towns and or
temporarily were visiting Baghdád and became attracted to the
inner Light of Abhá Beauty there were princes of the royal
blood, amongst whom were the Ná’ibú’l-Iyálih, the Shuja’u’d-
Dawlih, the Sayfu’d-Dawlih, and Zaynu’l-Ábidín Khán, the
Fakhru’d-Dawlih. [GPB 134-135] The following statement,
describing the atmosphere of the reception room of Bahá’u’lláh,
has been attributed to Prince Zaynu’l-Ábidín Khán, the
Fakhru’d-Dawlih: “were all the sorrows of the world to be
crowded into my heart they would, I feel, all vanish, when in the
presence of Bahá’u’lláh. It is as if I had entered Paradise itself.”
[GPB 135]

386                                              Lights of Irfán vol. 15

Bahá’u’lláh’s return from Sulaymáníyyih to Baghdád is
regarded as a turning point in the fortunes of the Bábí
community and a significant event in the history of the first
Bahá’í century. At that point in time, the tide of the Bábí
community in ‘Iráq had reached its lowest ebb and with the
return of Bahá’u’lláh, it started to surge back and continued to
move upward, through the wise counsels of Bahá’u’lláh. This
trend continued until His exile to Constantinople took place,
when He made an “open declaration” of His Mission in the
garden of Najíbíyyih.

The Ri∂ván period, which is generally known as the “open
declaration” of the Mission of Bahá’u’lláh, requires
clarification. We need to distinguish between “open
declaration” and “public declaration.” The declaration during
the Ri∂ván period 1863 certainly was not a “public
declaration”. However, we may refer to it by “open
declaration” which signifies that Bahá’u’lláh mentioned to some
individuals that He was in fact the object of prophecies of the
Báb in the Bayán and His other Writings. Wearing of the Táj
(tall felt head-dress) on the day of His departure from the Most
Great House for the garden of Najíbíyyih is another indication
of His imminent assumption of the prophetic office stipulated
by the Báb, “Him Whom God shall make manifest.” Historians
of the Faith have written very little about the nature of the
“open declaration” of Bahá’u’lláh in the garden of Ri∂ván
because the details were not recorded and are not known. In this
regard, the Guardian writes:

> Of the exact circumstances attending that epoch-making
> Declaration, we, alas, are but scantily informed. The
> words Bahá’u’lláh actually uttered on that occasion, the
> manner of His Declaration, the reaction it produced, its
> impact on Mírzá Ya˙yá, the identity of those who were
> privileged to hear Him, are shrouded in an obscurity
> which future historians will find it difficult to penetrate.

The fragmentary description left to posterity by His

> chronicler Nabíl is one of the very few authentic records
> we possess of the memorable days He spent in that
> garden. [GPB 153]

In Bahá’u’lláh King of Glory, similar sentiments are expressed:

> While writers and chroniclers have left copious accounts
> of the throngs of people, their expression of sorrow, the
> excellence of the skilled work of the gardeners, nothing
> is said of how Bahá’u’lláh made His long awaited
> Declaration.17

The significance of this event is that the period of concealment
ended and a new Era started.

In addition, the community of the “Most Great Name”, the
“companions of the Crimson Colored Ark,” mentioned in the
Qayyúmu’l-Asmá, had finally emerged. The Guardian calls
Mírzá Áqá Ján Khádimu’lláh as the “first to believe” in Him
[GPB 115]. We note that ‘Abdu’l-Bahá was present in the garden
of Najíbíyyih (Garden of Ri∂ván) during the period of Ri∂ván.
Only some of the believers of the Bayán, living in ‘Iráq or ˆrán,
had the capacity to receive His Message. Bahá’u’lláh has
referred to some of the ambitious and corrupt Bábís as idol
worshipers. [GPB 119] Perhaps it was a rule rather than exception.
In order to receive His message, an entirely new race of men
needed to be created and brought to existence. So, those who
were thinking in terms of the station of prophet-hood or
successor-ship of the Báb and the like were not worthy of
hearing his message. Bahá’u’lláh after reaching Edirne started
sending “Teachers,” like Nabíl Zarandí and Mírzá Áqáy-i-Muníb
with the Surih-i-Aß˙ab (Tablet of Companions), to ˆrán to find
Bábís who had enough conviction and understanding to receive
the Message of Bahá’u’lláh, which was accomplished in the first
and second year of His stay in Edirne. At this juncture, He had
to formally inform Mírzá Ya˙yá Núrí that he should discontinue
his claims to prophet-hood and embrace the new Cause,
something that Azal rejected squarely. We may refer to this

388                                               Lights of Irfán vol. 15

stage of unfolding of His Message as the “public declaration.”
Again, His “public declaration” was not an isolated event.
Rather, as stated by the Guardian, it started and continued for a
long time. In God Passes By, the Guardian dedicates an entire
chapter (chapter 10) to the “The Rebellion of Mírzá Ya˙yá and
the Proclamation of Bahá’u’lláh’s Mission in Adrianople.” [GPB

\[163\] 
In the Surih Íabr, Bahá’u’lláh makes many references
concerning His Mission and the new dispensation, but He never
used the designation of “Him Whom God shall make manifest,”
— a term reserved by the Báb for the Promised One of the
Bayán. Statements regarding His Mission are scattered
throughout the Tablet. Rather, in the Tablet, Bahá’u’lláh hints
to disclosure of His Light and the burning of all veils
enwrapped around Him which had stopped the light within Him
from reaching the eyes of men. Bahá’u’lláh also expresses the
fact that people are not ready for the Message yet and this has
to happen sometime in the future. He uses words like “soon”
and “anticipate” which denote events in the future.

Below are some of the passages in the Tablet which refer to
Bahá’u’lláh’s Mission:

> I swear by God! Soon will God cause him to be
> manifested within the canopy of grandeur with a
> luminous garment which will scintillate like unto the
> scintillation of light above the spiritual horizon and eyes
> will be dazzled upon beholding him and above his head
> there will be a caller from God saying, “This is verily the
> one who was long suffering for God in the vain and
> futile world and in all that the unbelievers did unto him.
> The concourse on high will seek blessing from him and
> the occupiers of God’s pavilions will seek to meet him as
> well as the holy maidens in the sacred and beautiful
> tabernacles.”

> Anticipate ye therefore the Day when the clouds of
> patience shall be uplifted and the immortal Bird shall
> warble, and the Peacock of holiness shall be made
> manifest with the ornament of Revelation in the
> kingdom of His reunion, and the stammering tongues
> shall be freed singing the accents of the Nightingale, and
> the Dove of paradise shall sing betwixt earth and heaven
> and the Trumpet shall be sounded and bodies of
> existence shall all be renewed, and the Divine Fire shall
> be ignited, and God in His transcendent and glorious
> Beauty shall come in the clouds of the Spirit. Then haste
> ye to Him O peoples of the earth! And do not heed
> anything else of this world, and let nothing impede you,
> and let the affairs of learning should not hinder you and
> the matters of wisdom should not lock you out haste
> with all haste to the holy and uplifted Precinct. For if
> you had been of the patient ones from all eternity but if
> ye tarry on that Day less than a moment the quality of
> true patience shall not be yours. This has been revealed
> by the pen of the Omniscient One.

The above passage can be broken down to the following
expressions:
Anticipate ye therefore the Day when:

> The clouds of patience shall be uplifted
> Immortal Bird shall warble
> Peacock of holiness shall be made manifest with the
> ornament of Revelation in the Kingdom of His reunion
> Stammering tongues shall be freed singing the accents of
> the Nightingale
> And the Dove of paradise shall sing betwixt earth and
> heaven
> Trumpet shall be sounded;

Although the theme of patience was expressed at the
beginning of the Tablet when the story of the life of Job was
presented, Bahá’u’lláh at other occasions in the Tablet refers
back to the theme of patience. As an example, towards the end
of the Tablet, Bahá’u’lláh reverts back to the theme of the
Tablet concerning patience and starts shedding light on the
nature of His own Mission. In reviewing these paragraphs
carefully, we realize that Bahá’u’lláh is making reference to His
own revelation several times, and in different ways, some of
which are quite startling. In addition, He warns the believers to
be vigilant and to be careful not to be attracted to the
manifestations of evil and selfish interests. Two passages are
listed below:

> O Solace of the eye of eternity! Change your tone and
> chant upon the melodies of those nightingales singing in
> the tabernacle of divine names and in the dominions of
> divine attributes that the birds of the throne may detach
> themselves from the dust of themselves, and may
> therefore turn back to their original homeland which is
> sanctified beyond transcendence. O Thou Quintessence
> of truth! Sing and chant with the most beauteous
> melodies for all the maidens of paradise have come out
> of their assemblies and their tents of purity that they
> may hear Your own melody, the melody that has been
> sung in the pages of God in the book, Qayyúmu’l-Asmá.
> Do not deprive these of what they have desired to hear
> of Thy new and wondrous melodies and loving kindness
> for Thou art indeed the most generous One in the
392                                           Lights of Irfán vol. 15

> highest grades of immortality and in truth Thou art
> indeed the most generous One in the dominion of
> eternity and Thy Name is well known amongst the
> concourse on high as the Generous One.

> O Thou most holy Beauty! The unbelievers do not
> respite Thee that a breath should be exhaled from Thy

> place the hand of hatred over My mouth and yet with all
> your knowledge of this matter you command Me to raise
> My call in this atmosphere for Thou art the doer in

> Thou hearkenest to the call of Thy servant, if Thou
> fulfillest his wish then forgive them with the utmost
> kind word and delicate utterance that those handmaidens
> of eternity may return to their seats in the crimson and
> ruby laden chambers.

This section of the Tablet (the last few paragraphs) looks like
a divine play. Bahá’u’lláh, after making a previous statement
that the time is not ripe for making a declaration, in here He
states that He should come out of His veil and should disclose
His station. It seems these words indicate that if the time is not
ripe to make mention of His station in a clear manner, then, He
should come out of the veil so that they can see the light within
Him.

References to Calf, Sámirí, Satan and Birds of Night

In the Surih Íabr there is no mention of the name of Mírzá
Ya˙yá Núrí known as Azal, half-brother of Bahá’u’lláh, but
there are several references to Calf, Sámirí and Satan which
most probably refer to him. Mírzá Ya˙yá Núrí was a child when
his father passed away, and Bahá’u’lláh took it upon Himself to
raise him up. At the time of the Declaration of the Báb, he was
barely an adult. Several years later when the Báb was

incarcerated, Bahá’u’lláh was well known as the leader of the
Bábí community. In order that Bahá’u’lláh does not attract
more undue attention than he already received, it was prudent
to nominally appoint a figurehead point of contact with the
Báb. This person happened to be Mírzá Ya˙yá Núrí. This
selection was not on the basis of any merits or particular
talents. Bahá’u’lláh has written that only four people knew
about this arrangement and selection as a strategy only. They
were: The Báb, Bahá’u’lláh, Mírzá Músá Kalím (brother of
Bahá’u’lláh) and Mullá ‘Abdu’l-Karím-i-Qazvíní, surnamed
Mírzá A˙mad (Mírzá A˙mad Kátib).18 This nominal figure was
not intended to have the status of a prophet but was only a
figurehead. After the Martyrdom of the Báb, particularly when
Bahá’u’lláh was exiled to ‘Iráq, Mírzá Ya˙yá Núrí came to
Baghdád under great guise and cover and lived there with much
isolation in order not to be seen in public.

At this point and with the encouragement from certain Bábís
who, at that time were considering themselves learned among
the much oppressed Bábí community, Mírzá Ya˙yá thought he
had a status in the Bayán Dispensation as a “Successor” to the
Báb. He prided himself on high sounding titles such as
Mir’atu’l-Azalíyyih (Everlasting Mirror), of Íub˙-i-Azal
(Morning of Eternity), and of Ismu’l-Azal (Name of Eternity).
Mírzá Ya˙yá and those individuals who circled around him were
jealous of the reverence with which Bahá’u’lláh was treated by
the great majority of the Bábí community. At this point they
still did not know He was the object of adoration in the Bayán
and the actual person referred to by the Báb as “Him Whom
God shall make manifest.” Mírzá Ya˙yá and a small band of
followers considered him to be the “Successor of the Báb,”
despite the fact that there was no such provision in the Bayán
Dispensation. Apart from his shallow knowledge and a
disposition which could not impress anyone, Mírzá Ya˙yá
started promoting the idea that the advent of “Him Whom God
shall make manifest” would occur at a distant time in the future
(the year 2001 from the start of the Bábí Dispensation) —

394                                           Lights of Irfán vol. 15

despite the fact that it had already come to pass in “Year Nine”
in the person of Bahá’u’lláh. During this time, Bahá’u’lláh
contained within Himself the Mission with which He was
invested, pending an appropriate time to mention it openly. The
pre-ordained time finally arrived and it was the period of
Ri∂ván 1863 on the eve of His journey to far-away lands.
Bahá’u’lláh knew well that His Declaration will bring
opposition from His half-brother and will cause separation
within the Bábí community. He had tried to educate and prepare
the Bábí community to come to terms with this reality. This can
be seen through references in the Tablet.

In the Tablet there are references to Calf and Sámirí which
bring to mind the events during the time of Moses when He
went to Mt. Sinai to have a conversation with God. A person by
the name of Sámirí in the Qur’án (there is no mention of the
name of Sámirí in the Old Testament) rose in opposition to
Moses and made a “Calf” from the gold of the Israelis and called
it as their God which they worship. Therefore, in the writings of
the Báb and Bahá’u’lláh whenever there is a mention of these
two names (Calf and Sámirí) they may mean those individuals
from among the believers who promote untrue and false ideas
which are very much opposed to the religion of God. In this
dispensation, in particular, two individuals are named: Mírzá
Ya˙yá and Siyyid Mu˙ammad-i-Ißfáhání. To the latter in
particular, Bahá’u’lláh had referred in the Kitáb-i-Aqdas, several
years later, as the one who had “led astray” Mírzá Ya˙yá, and
stigmatized him, in one of His Tablets, as the “source of envy
and the quintessence of mischief.”

In anticipation of His “public declaration” which would
start in Edirne, Bahá’u’lláh has warned the believers in Baghdád,
who were left behind, against the noise of the “Calf” which was
in fact what Mírzá Ya˙yá would say, write and distribute among
the believers. In addition, references to “Satan” have been made
in the Tablet in which similarities between “Satan” and Mírzá
Ya˙yá could be drawn in two different ways. We recall the story
of the creation of Adam in which God asked Satan, the

archangel, to bow down before Adam, which he refused. In
Edirne, Bahá’u’lláh revealed Surih-i-Amr in which He clearly
called Himself “Him Whom God shall make manifest” without
leaving any room for misunderstanding, and invited Mírzá
Ya˙yá to embrace His Mission [GPB 166] — the response of
Mírzá Ya˙yá unfortunately was negative. So, Mírzá Ya˙yá,
followed the footsteps of “Satan” who refused to show humility
and submission to Adam, rebelled against Bahá’u’lláh under the
pretext that he was a successor to the Báb in like-manner that
“Satan” thought he had been created from fire while Adam had
been created from mud and therefore he was superior to Adam.
In this way Mírzá Ya˙yá waxed proud before the Manifestation
of God. In the story of “Satan”, there is a second perspective to
consider where Satan said he will mislead the Adam and his
descendants. In like-manner, Mírzá Ya˙yá as the embodiment of
“Satan” in character tried to mislead the Bábís concerning the
New Dispensation and the “public declaration” of Bahá’u’lláh.
In addition, in the Surih Íabr, Bahá’u’lláh refers to the “Birds of
Night”. Birds of Night are creatures like “bats” which are
deprived of the ability of vision to see and enjoy the world
around them in the light of the sun — they start flying when
there is much darkness. In this context, Bahá’u’lláh refers to His
absence from Baghdád, as disappearance of the Sun of Reality
and setting in the “Spiritual Darkness”. In such an environment,
Birds of Night may have been Mírzá Ya˙yá and his associates
who would start moving about and spreading false teachings. In
the Tablet, Bahá’u’lláh warns the believers against them and
advises the believers not to pay any attention to them.

Another reference to Mírzá Ya˙yá and his associates can be
found in statements in the Tablet such as “those who joined
partners with God,” and also “idol worshipers.” This discussion
regarding some passages in the Tablet concerning Mírzá Ya˙yá
and his associates would be incomplete without mention of the
views expressed by individuals, who were un-informed at best
or ill-intentioned at worst, in their perspective on the
Revelation of Bahá’u’lláh. Individuals such as E.G. Browne tried

396                                             Lights of Irfán vol. 15

to wrongly advance the idea that the Azalí and Bahá’í groups
were two divisions within the Bábí community and favored the
idea that Azal’s views were closer to the teachings of the Báb,
and further, that Bahá’u’lláh usurped power from the legitimate
successor (vicegerent) of the Báb. In addition, they translated
into English (particularly E.G. Browne), a much discredited
history book allegedly written by Óájí Mírzá Jání Káshání
called Nuq†atu’l-Káf, and along with the original book in
Persian and a foreword by E.G. Browne printed and distributed
it in the wider western circles (E.G. Browne attached much
significance to his finding of this book). ‘Abdu’l-Bahá
countered these misgivings by directing Mírzá Abu’l-Fa∂l to
refute the false-hood of all the claims advanced in that book so
called “Nuq†atu’l-Káf.” Mírzá Abu’l-Fa∂l started on the task in
earnest, and half-way through the writing of the book, he passed
away to Abhá Kingdom in Cairo, Egypt. Finally this book was
completed by a group of Bahá’í scholars in ˇihrán with the
assistance from Mírzá Siyyid Mihdí Gulpaygání and was called
“Kashf ul-Ghita.” This book was finally printed but was not
distributed widely.19

Some of the passages in the Surih Íabr which contain
references to Calf, Sámirí, Satan and Birds of Night include:

> The earth shall be inherited by those servants who are
> wholly consecrated unto God, have not imbibed the love
> of the “Calf” in their hearts, and who turn away from
> those who continue to disbelieve despite clear evidences
> presented to them. Thus have the fingers of might upon
> the tablets of light inscribed the divine behest.

> But O people of the Bayan! Strive with the utmost
> striving that ye may not disagree * about the Cause of
> God and be ye as steadfast as the mountain in all truth in
> such wise that the whisperings of the Evil One may not
> cause you to slip and that nothing on earth may pervert
> you. All this is that which the Dove of Revelation
> counselleth you at the time of departure from ‘Iráq

> because of what the hands of unbelievers have wrought.
> Furthermore know ye, O concourse of chosen ones, that
> when the Sun sets, the birds of night will move about in
> the darkness, but you ought not pay heed to them.
> Rather turn your faces in this well-beloved and holy
> direction. Beware lest ye follow the “Sámirí” in your
> souls; beware lest ye fall behind the “Calf” when it bleats
> amongst you. This is my best counsel unto you and unto
> all created things. You shall hear the call of Sámirí after
> Me and he will summon you to the Evil One. Go ye not
> therefore to him, rather turn to this Hidden and
> Glorious Beauty. At this point We address all who are in
> heaven and on earth from this City that haply all things

Farewell to the Believers

Bahá’u’lláh left Baghdád with His family and 26 individuals
whom He selected to accompany Him (there were a few more
who joined the travelers middle of the way). The vast majority
of those who loved Him were left behind and it weighed heavily
on their hearts to see Him move away from their midst. In the
last few paragraphs in the Tablet, Bahá’u’lláh bids farewell to
the believers in glowing terms and with language full of
imagery, makes use of terms such as the “bird”, “tree”,
“branches”, “Sheba”, “Sinai” and “fragrant and musk laden
breeze.” Leaving the “City of God” or “the Abode of Peace” on
the day of departure has been recorded in great detail from the
“Pen of the Most High” in other tablets, and by historians and
by eye-witnesses of the events of that day who penned down
what they saw for posterity. Bahá’u’lláh calls this event as “the

day of Great Terror” in this Tablet which is quoted below. For
this phrase, there may be two different explanations.

> Say: this Tablet enjoins upon you, patience on this day
> of the Great Terror and commands you to show
> forbearance * in this Most Great Agitation

The use of this terminology “day of the Great Terror”             has
two-fold significance. First, the usage of the word: day of          the
“Great Terror” which is in fact one of the references to             the
“Day of Judgement.” “Most Great Terror” is one of                    the
references in the Qur’án describing the time of the end.

> The Supreme Horror will not grieve them, and the angels
> will welcome them, (saying): This is your Day which ye
> were promised. (Surah Al-Anbiya, Surih number 21, verse 103)

The interpretation of the day of Great Terror in the
Writings is the time of appearance of the Manifestation of
God. So, in this regard when Bahá’u’lláh is referring to day of
Great Terror in the Tablet as quoted above, it is likely to refer
to both meanings. The first one is His own appearance in the
fulfillment of the prophecies in the Qur’án. Also, it might refer
to his actual departure from the “Most Great House” in
Baghdád, for the garden of Najíbíyyih, to which He never
returned. On that day, even the trees and stones moaned their
separation from Him. The second meaning of this word is its
actual physical meaning and in fact if we notice what has been
reported about that day and all the commotion, wailing and
crying of the people, even non-believers, it was indeed the day
of great terror.

In describing His departure from Baghdád, Bahá’u’lláh has
used the term “Dove of Hijáz flies from ‘Iráq.” There is a
mystery in this statement and there may be a few interpretations
or explanations for calling Himself “Dove of Hijáz.” Hijáz is
the land of Arabia and the region around Mecca and Medina. As
far as we know, neither His ancestry is rooted in Arabia and

Hijáz to warrant the usage of such word for Himself in this
manner, unlike the Báb whose lineage was from Hijáz and thus
his self-reference as the Arabian Youth (He was a Siyyid), nor
did Bahá’u’lláh travel to this region for pilgrimage or a visit.
One could possibly interpret Bahá’u’lláh’s usage of this term as
being due to having revealed the Surih Íabr in Arabic which is
the language of Hijáz. In addition, Hijáz and Hijází are a music
system of notes, and singing in the Hijází system or melody of
Hijáz. The reference to the “Dove of Hijáz,” could denote
prophet-hood and being a Manifestation of God. It could mean
singing in a similar manner as Mu˙ammad did, who was in
reality a “Dove of Hijáz.” In other words, by using this
terminology, Bahá’u’lláh could be stating indirectly that He is a
Manifestation of God.

Other imagery used by Bahá’u’lláh in His parting words in
the Surih Íabr is “The Bird of Immortality has flown from the
Horizon of Eternity and has purposed the Sheba of the Spirit in
the Sinai of holiness.” This passage is very complex to
understand it correctly, while connecting the elements
mentioned in the verse. After all, it is mentioned in the
following passage that “this is but one of God’s hidden secrets.”
The following may be one of several explanations: The Bird of
Immortality is Bahá’u’lláh who has flown from the Horizon of
Eternity for spiritual Sheba. Sheba was the kingdom of the
Queen of Sheba who had a message for King Solomon and vice
versa, and a bird was a messenger between them (this is why He
uses the metaphor “The Bird of Immortality” in here). However,
this Sheba of Spirit is in the Sinai of holiness. The Sinai of
Holiness brings to mind the conversation of Moses with God
and the revelation and religion that Moses brought to the
people exemplified in the form of the Ten Commandments. In
other words, this Bird of Immortality who is Bahá’u’lláh has
flown from the Horizon of Eternity in order to bring a spiritual
message to the people in the Sinai of holiness. In short, this is
again another statement that the disclosure of His station to the
people is imminent.

Abode of Peace is a reference to paradise and is also a title
for “Baghdád” in Islamic literature and history. There is a
prophecy in the Qur’án regarding the call of God which will go
out of “Abode of Peace” which is Baghdád — this refers to the
revelation of Bahá’u’lláh. Muslim scholars and men of learning
have interpreted the “Abode of Peace” as Paradise.

> And Allah summoneth to the abode of peace, and leadeth
> whom He will to a straight path. (Súrah Yunus, Súrah 10,
> verse 25)

In some of the Tablet’s passages he discusses His departure
from Baghdád and comforts those who stay behind:

> Say: this Tablet enjoins upon you patience on this day of
> the Great Terror and commands you to show
> forbearance * in this Most Great Agitation when this
> Dove of Hijáz flies from ‘Iráq and sheds upon all
> contingent beings the fragrances of separation and on
> the face of heaven appears the color red for thus is the
> matter decreed in the Mother Book.

> Say: The Bird of Immortality has flown from the
> Horizon of Eternity and has purposed the Sheba of the
> Spirit in the Sinai of holiness so that in the Mirror of
> divine destiny the commands of His decree may be
> reflected and this is but one of God’s hidden secrets.
> Say: The Bird of Glory has flown from one branch and
> has sought the Branch of holiness planted in the land of
> exile. Say: the Breeze of Divine Unity has dawned from
> the Abode of Peace and has sought to blow over the city
> of separation as mentioned in the scrolls of divine
> Revelation. Say: O concourse in the heavens and on
> earth! Throw ye ashes on your faces and on your heads
> because the Beauty of God disappears from these near
> cities and intends to dawn from the horizon of a remote
> heaven. All this has been decreed in truth and We are

> thankful to God in that He has caused to descend on Us
> tribulation after tribulation and at this moment too He
> rains upon Us from the Clouds of His Decree down-
> pouring of well-known sorrows.

Conclusion

The Tablet of Patience (Súrih-i-Íabr) is a mighty Tablet
revealed at a critical time in the history of the Bahá’í Faith. For
better understanding of this Tablet, in this article, several key
concepts were explored and discussed, with consideration of the
historical context or the spiritual principles behind them. It is
hoped that exploration of the key themes provides a basis for a
study of the Tablet’s contents in greater detail. The Tablet’s key
themes explored in this paper include patience and calamities, life
of Job, events of Nayríz and Va˙íd, status of religious leaders
in the sight of God, prophecies of the Báb regarding Revelation
of Bahá’u’lláh, open and public declarations of Bahá’u’lláh,
meaning of Calf, Sámirí, and the parting words of Bahá’u’lláh.
