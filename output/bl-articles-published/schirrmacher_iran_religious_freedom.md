Abstract
The article explores the situation of non-Shiite Muslims, non-Christian religions
like Baha'i, and the different Christian confessions in Iran. It particularly
examines their legal situation, asks for the ideological position of the Iranian
leadership concerning other religions and then describes the actual problems,
as the government rarely uses legal means against other religions, but uses
allegations of espionage against them.
Keywords       Iran, Shia, Sunni, Baha’i, Protestants, Evangelicals.

1\. The Iranian revolution
Shah Reza Pahlavi maintained progressive economic policies while
relying heavily on the West. Unpopular because of his use of
repressive measures and his secret service, he was subsequently
deposed of by the Shiite Islamic revolution. In 1979 the Islamic
Republic was proclaimed. Ever since the Islamic clergy, as guardians
of the revolution, maintain authority over the politicians, who, while
mostly democratically elected, are hand-picked by the religious
guardians. Consequently, in spite of its democratic structures, Iran
remains a theocratic police state which ignores human rights, in
particular those of minorities, non-Muslims and women.

Year after year, the classical reference works which categorize
countries according to their religious freedom1 and the persecution of

Christians (Shea 1997; Marshall 1997), as well as the annual reports
of human rights organizations, the US State Department Human
Rights Report,2 and the US State Department Religious Freedom
Report,3 have been rating Iran among the states where religious
freedom is obviously non-existent and where even adherents of the
state religion who hold a divergent doctrine are brutally persecuted.

Of the 70 million inhabitants of Iran, 95.6% are Muslims, 2.8%
Zoroastrians, 0.7% Baha’i, 0.5% Christians (0.3% Orthodox), 0.5%
non-religious and 0.1% Hindus.4 Shiite Islam is the state religion and
93% of the inhabitants adhere to it. Owing to the constant emigration
of members of religious minorities, the figures for the religious
minorities could, however, in the meantime be considerably lower.5

The Iranian revolution which has its origins in the long
ideological history of the Iranian Shia (see Arjomand 1984; Ansari
2002), aimed at subjecting all spheres of society and each individual
citizen to the will of the religious leaders – if necessary by means of
control, threat and violence (cf. Akhavi 1987). Not even the political
government itself is exempt from this. There is a broad consensus
among scholarly researchers globally,6 including Islamic authors, that
this has remained in force unaltered to date. This policy was and is
considered to be a model for other parts of the world and has
encouraged the spread of violence against dissenters and the
suppression of religious freedom worldwide (Esposito 1990; Menashri
1990). This strategy is still maintained despite the fact that even
insiders have to admit that the dream of a society better than that of
the Shah era, a dream to which Ayatollah Khomeini owed much of his
support, has long been shattered, particularly since the poor find

themselves in a worse situation than before and the image of Islam has
suffered among the population.

Ayatollah Ali Khamenei is the Supreme Guardian of the Islamic
Revolution. He is the de facto Chief of State and, as many may not
know, also the Commander-in-Chief of the armed forces7 and all
armed units. Equally, the office of the President of Parliament and
almost all of the top government offices are held by Islamic clerics
who, while often regarded as liberal by Western observers owing to
their often only slight deviations from the views of the Council of
Guardians, do not in the slightest doubt the Islamic revolution and the
necessity of maintaining a purely Islamic state.8

The 83 religious leaders elect the ‘Supreme Guardian of the
Revolution’ who supervises all political proceedings. All laws and
actions voted on by Parliament (called ‘Majles’ or ‘Majlis’) are
scrutinized and approved by the so-called ‘Council of Guardians’
which consists of six religious leaders appointed by the Ayatollah and
six Islamic jurists who are proposed by the Supreme Judge and elected
by Parliament. Up until the nomination of the current President,
Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, the Council of Guardians has rejected almost
all laws proposed by Parliament, and even under this ‘hardliner’ this is
happening repeatedly. All religious activities are meticulously
supervised by the Ministry of Islamic Culture and Guidance and the
dreaded ‘Minister of Intelligence and Security’ (MOIS).

There is no prospect of improvement. For example, in 1998 the
Iranian Parliament passed a law which prohibits any kind of medical
care or treatment of patients by members of the opposite sex. 9
(However, in reality many Iranians, especially in Teheran, are not
observing such laws.) When the Parliament planned to raise the
minimum age of marriage from 9 to 15 years in October 2000, the
Council of Guardians refused to implement the suggestion. In
addition, they still consider the so-called temporary marriage, known
only in Shiite Islam, acceptable. Such a marriage can be entered into

for a duration of at least 60 minutes and with several women
simultaneously and leaves women at the mercy of de facto
prostitution.10

2\. Human rights in general11
The lack of religious freedom in Iran is only one aspect of the wide
range of human rights violations12 which do not occur only in secret
but are endorsed by official ideology13 and not only by the religious
leaders but even government agencies, even though the latter would
prefer to see some moderation for their own benefit. In the Iranian
judicial system, one and the same person fills the role of judge and
state attorney. Most defendants have no legal representation, there are
no remand prisons and the authorities are allowed to keep prisoners in
custody as long as they wish without having to provide reasons.
Sylvain Coiplet (2001) justifiably writes:

> Even worse than this arrogance is the fact that reformers as well as
> conservatives have a common goal. The reformers too want to prevent
> the separation of state and religion. They only argue about how to

> state. The conservatives are making allegations in this regard but the
> reformers deny these categorically and vehemently support the Islamic
> revolution. The question is whether they only do this in order to save
> their own lives.

To add a further random example of human rights violations, access to
higher education can only be attained after passing an exam in Islamic
theology. This is an undisputed legal requirement for university
studies in all of Iran (U.S. Department of State 2002:2).

3\. Religious freedom in general
There is no freedom of religion in Iran.14 Basic freedoms which are
guaranteed by the constitution are denied to all adherents of divergent
forms of Islam,15 as well as to non-Islamic minorities who are called
‘people of the book’ in the constitution, meaning Christians,
Zoroastrians and Jews. They are oppressed and sometimes heavily
persecuted, for example by having their leaders assassinated. All
missionary work, de facto only practised by Christians and Baha’i, is
strictly prohibited (Keil 2006:61-64).

> A report of the U.S. Department of State on Human Rights of the year
> 2000 described the conditions in Iran as ‘poor’. It specified that
> religious minorities ‘experience varying degrees of officially sanctioned
> discrimination, particularly in the areas of employment, education, and
> housing’. Furthermore, ‘they suffer discrimination in the legal system,
> receiving lower awards in injury and death lawsuits, and expose
> themselves to the danger of receiving heavier punishment than
> Muslims’ (Menashri 2003:7).

Article 1 of the Iranian Constitution16 of 1980 (amended in 1989)
stipulates that Iran is an “Islamic Republic”. Article 2 extensively
elaborates on the role that belief in the one God, and his revelation
plays in the legal system. Laws are based on the Koran and Sunna, and
religious leaders watch over both, the laws as well as their application.
Human dignity and freedom (Art. 2, para.6) are mentioned only in
respect to human responsibility towards God, which results in the
necessity of relying on the leadership of holy men. According to
Article 4 all laws and regulations must without exception be “based on
Islamic criteria” which have to be watched over by the ‘Guardian
Council’. According to Article 11 the government is responsible for
cultivating the unity of the Islamic world because all Muslims
worldwide are forming a single great nation. According to Articles 19

and 20 all people enjoy equal rights and equal protection of the law,
but only “in conformity with Islamic criteria”. According to Article 14
the human rights of all non-Muslims who have not fought against
Islam (Sura 60,8 is quoted here) are to be respected in accordance with
Islamic ethical norms of justice, provided that they refrain from
engaging in any conspiracy or activity against Islam or the Republic of
Iran. One is inclined not to trust the application of Article 23 which
claims that no one may be molested or punished simply for holding a
certain belief. Even the “investigation of an individual's belief is
forbidden”, which is otherwise presupposed by the entire constitution.

In 1984, the UN Human Rights Commission appointed a Special
Rapporteur for Iran whose mandate has since then been extended
annually. When Khomeini died in 1989 there was hope for
improvement, which however was soon dashed (a view shared by
Boyle & Sheen 1997:421-422). The reports of the UN Special
Rapporteur show that the situation has instead worsened since 1990.
In September 1994, the UN Sub-Commission for the Protection of
Minorities condemned Iran for its increasing persecution of Christians,
especially for the continuous killing of their leaders (cf. News
Network International 1994). In March 1995, the Commission issued
a special resolution (cf. Lawton 1995:8-10) condemning Iran for the
oppression of religious minorities after the outgoing Special
Representative had submitted a devastating detailed report. (The UN
Human Rights Commission came to an end under the chairmanship of
Sudan and after its dissolution was replaced by the UN Human Rights
Council in 2006, in which 47 nations chosen by the general assembly
have the right to vote. From this time onward there have rarely been
any meaningful condemnations or reports on the human rights
situation in non-Western countries. However, the UN General
Assembly, expressed its deep concern regarding the constant
deterioration of the human rights situation in Iran in a resolution on 19
December 2006, which was accepted with 72:50 votes with 55
abstentions.)

The World Reports of Human Rights Watch of 2002, 2003 and
2007 have confirmed a considerable worsening of the situation of
religious minorities since 1994, and again since 2001.17

4\. Treatment of religious minorities
The suppression of religious freedom most strongly affects the largest
religious minority, the Baha’i, and the non-orthodox, that is the
Catholic and Protestant (especially evangelical) Christians, and the
few remaining Jews. But besides these it also affects Islamic groups
like the Sufis or Azeris.

4\.1 Jews
The Jews are under extreme threat as they are suspected of spying for
Israel. “Especially members of the Jewish community were under this
suspicion. The majority of Jews living in Islamic states already emigrated
by the 1950s and 1960s or were expelled or deported. At the end of the
1970s 100,000 Jews were living in Iran. Today there are only 25,000.”18

4\.2 Baha’i
Unlike other monotheists, the Baha’i do not enjoy any constitutional or
formal protection, not even on paper. Although they are very peaceful,
tolerant and supportive of human rights (Kazemzadeh 1999), they are not
recognized as Dhimmis (protected monotheists) since only Christian,
Jewish and Zoroastrian Iranians are recognized religious minorities
according to Article 12 of the Constitution. Their religion was founded by
Baha'u'llah in Teheran in the middle of the 19th Century. 19 Since
Mohammed was the last prophet according to orthodox Islamic view to
whom God revealed a message, no other religions which developed after
his death are granted the right to exist. The 300,000 Baha’i were already
oppressed before the Islamic revolution and 200 of their leaders were
killed during the revolution. Since 1993 this religion has been prohibited,
even in the private sphere. There is no doubt that the Baha’i are oppressed
in Iran in a most cruel manner. The goal is to at least eliminate them from

Department of State.

the public eye.20 Leaders of the pacifist Baha’i are regularly sentenced to
death in fast-tracked trials.21

In 1993 the Special Rapporteur of the UN Commission for Human
Rights published an Iranian government directive22 which lists in detail the
measures taken against the Baha’i. They include total control of all their
activities, denial of access to education and all important positions in the
workplace, prevention of all connections to foreign countries and the
elimination of influential leaders. Iran naturally denies the existence of this
document.

According to the Annual Reports of Amnesty International, in one
year 65 Baha’i were arrested and only some of them were released.25
In the preceding year 66 had been arrested 26, obviously in connection
with recent government instructions: “In March, the UN Special
Rapporteur on Freedom of Religion or Belief expressed concern about
an October 2005 letter instructing various government agencies to
identify, and collect information about, Baha'i in Iran.”27

The World Report of the Human Rights Watch 2007 quotes this
letter of the Supreme Leader of the Revolution, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei
(Human Rights Watch 2007). Consequently, approximately 54 Baha’i
were arrested because they had taught poor children English, arithmetic,
reading and writing free of charge (Human Rights Watch 2007).

In 2004 several holy places, which are connected with the early
history of the Baha’i in Iran, were destroyed, including the birthplace
of the founder of the religion. This was done in order to erase the
cultural traces of this religion in Iran (Hutter 2005:118).

4\.3 Muslims
Muslims are also persecuted for religious reasons. Article 12 of the
Constitution says: “The official religion of Iran is Islam and the
Twelver Ja'fari School”, also called Twelver Shia.28 The Constitution
also says: “Other Islamic schools are to be accorded full respect.” This
is only partly true in reality. Sunni Islam, which has adherents mostly
among the Turkish, Kurdish and Balutchi people, is not fully
respected. Sunni Muslims hardly suffer any persecution from the
highest government levels but frequently do so at the hands of local
religious leaders and authorities. There is not a single Sunni mosque in
Teheran. Sunni leaders have repeatedly complained abroad about the
suppression of the Sunni faith by government authorities.29

29 Confirmed by Boyle & Sheen 1997:425 and U.S. Department of State 2002:4-5.

Apart from the Sunnis, the Azeris are suffering persecution from
their Islamic brethren, according to Human Rights Watch (2007).
According to Amnesty International (AI) it is mostly the Sufis who are
suffering.30 According to AI, 1,000 members of the Sufi fellowship in
Nematollahi were forcefully arrested, and hundreds were injured
because they refused to leave their mosque in February 2006. In May
2006, 52 Sufis who intended to make legal representation on behalf of
the others were sentenced to corporal punishment. The lawyers taking
part in this action were professionally disbarred. “In a fatwa of August
the Sufis were declared ‘null and void’ as a religious fellowship.” 31 (A
fatwa is a religious opinion on Islamic law issued by an Islamic
scholar which is binding to the Iranian authorities.)

Even Shiite leaders are not protected from religious persecution.

The World Report of Human Rights Watch 2003 states that the
Supreme Ayatollah Hossain Ali Montazeri, formerly the designated
successor of Ayatollah Khomeini, is under house arrest in Qom owing
to his deviating religious views, and other older Shiite leaders are
being persecuted.32

4\.4 Orthodox and Catholic Christians
Even though the Armenian and Assyrian (Nestorian) Christians are
granted one seat in Parliament – like the Jews and Zoroastrians – and
even though they are not suspected of siding with Western powers
owing to their lengthy history in Iran, their religious freedom is still
negligible. One cannot even talk about traditional toleration and
partial autonomy such as had been granted to orthodox minorities in
large parts of the Islamic world for centuries. There is little known
about their situation, however, because traditionally they tend not to
spread information abroad.

The emigration of one quarter of the 200,000 Armenians – all
Persians who love their home country – speaks for itself, especially
since a further 7% of the 150,000 remaining population continue to
emigrate annually (Boyle & Sheen 1997:423). According to the
30 Amnesty International 2007:191-192 (German). This is confirmed by U.S.

Department of State 2006.

31 Amnesty International 2007:191 (German).
32 Human Rights Watch 2003:5; there are many reports on the Internet on Hossain

> Ali Montazeri, eg. available online: http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east
> /2699541.stm.

findings of the UN Special Rapporteur, approximately 15,000 to
20,000 Christians of all denominations are emigrating from Iran
annually (U.S. Department of State 2002:2). Regardless whether one
assumes an approximate number of between 115,000-120,000
Christians as does the Iranian government, or 300,000 Christians as
does the UN Special Rapporteur (:2), the Christian minority in Iran
could become negligible in the near future.

The situation of the Catholic congregations is very different
from that of the long-established Orthodox churches, even though
some of them have also been in the country for centuries. On 10
August 1979 all Catholic priests and members of Catholic orders were
ordered to leave the country within one month, while the Protestants
and Anglicans had to leave the country immediately. The Archbishop
of Teheran was expelled.

The greatest monitoring efforts are aimed at conversions from Islam to
the Baha’i religion and to Protestant Evangelical Christianity, and
such converts are prosecuted most severely. Apostasy from Islam is
subject to the death penalty, both in theory and in practice. The death
penalty is imposed by the courts of justice and executed in prison but
also carried out by Hezbollah groups by means of secret or public
assassination. Capital punishment for apostasy from Islam, while so
far not stipulated by law, is based on a decree issued by Ayatollah
Khomeini and is considered to be part of the Sharia. The decrees of
the Ayatollah and the numerous fatwas of renowned Islamic clerics are
considered as legal sources in their own right, as the infamous case of
Salman Rushdie has shown. He was sentenced to death because,
although being born as a Muslim (in India), he became secularised and
disinterested in Islam. Often a law, promulgated in 1996, is referred to
which provides for capital punishment for espionage. In practice all
Catholic and Protestant Christians are automatically suspect of
espionage because of their contacts abroad.

In 1994 the Fellowship of Protestant Churches was seriously
shaken by the assassination of three of their most important elected
representatives. It began with Pastor Mehdi Dibaj who was sentenced
to death in 1984 because of his conversion from Islam to Christianity
45 years previously. When Pastor Haik Hovespian-Mehr started an
international campaign for Dibaj he achieved the release of Dibaj at
the beginning of 1994 only to disappear himself a few days later. His
family was told that he had been murdered. In April 1994 a fatwa
appeared in a Teheran newspaper demanding the killing of Dibaj.
Finally, halfway through 1994, Dibaj also disappeared. In July his
body was 'found' by the government. His successor as chair of the
Council of Protestant Churches, Pastor Tateo's Michaelian was

murdered in June 1994. The prominent pastor Mohammas Bagher
Yusefi who looked after Dibaj's children, was found hanged in the
vicinity of his home at the end of 1996.34

Evangelical Christians frequently disappear after having been
kept in custody for a short period of time, especially those who had
formerly been Muslims (often before 1979!).35 The International
Religious Freedom Report 2001 reports that between 15 to 23
evangelical leaders who disappeared were murdered between
November 1997 and November 1998 (U.S. Department of State
2001:6). Each year new cases are reported.

In its annual report of 2006 (:214), Amnesty International
mentions that Hamid Pourmand who had converted from Islam to
Christianity and whose change of religion had been neither accepted
nor registered by the army, was sentenced to three years in prison
because he was said to have misled the military concerning his change
of religion. In its annual report of 2007 (:191), AI reports the arrest of
the daughter and son-in-law of the above mentioned Medhi Dibaj who
was murdered in 1994, immediately after his release from nine years
imprisonment because of alleged apostasy.

The printing of any kind of Christian literature, even that of
internal information bulletins for use during a church service, is
prohibited. The evangelical churches have gone underground because
they were instructed to submit membership lists (U.S. Department of
State 2002:2) and were forced, apart from other oppressive measures,
to hold their services in Assyrian or Armenian languages which they
can neither speak nor understand. Any church service in Persian, their
mother tongue, is severely sanctioned.

34 These details are based on the research by the Center for Religious Freedom of

> the US human rights organization Freedom House, Washington DC,
> www.freedomhouse.org/religion/martyrs/iran.htm and The Rutherford Institute
> 1996:5. Cf. the special report of News Network International of 26 July 1994.
> On Yusefi also see the detailed report “Another Iranian Christian Pays the
> Ultimate Price” by the Persian organization Elam Ministries at
> www.domini.org/openbook/iran1.htm.

35 International Christian Concern, Washington (www.persecution.org/suffer

> ing/country_info.php?iran.html) is providing current news and cases. A report
> on Iran of September 2006, which is no longer available online gave 16 detailed
> individual cases between 1997-2001.

The officially registered evangelical churches are permitted to
meet only on Sundays. The pastor is obliged to inform the government
before any new members may be admitted, after which the members
receive special identity papers which they have to carry at all times. At
the beginning of a church service these identity papers are often
checked by a religious guard at the entrance or at times even during
the church service. Even in Teheran, other Iranians and tourists are
prevented from entering church premises (:6).

According to the Representative Body of the Iranian Christians
founded in 1980/81 (a type of Protestant Church Council in exile),
Iranian Christians International (ICI),36 the persecution of Christians
has been increasing since 2000.37 The number of Christians, however,
is equally growing (mostly owing to the turning away from Iranian
Islam which is experienced as cruel and disappointing), while
simultaneously large numbers are emigrating. According to the figures
of ICI, there were 16,000 Protestant Iranian Christians in exile
worldwide in 1990, in 1994 36,000, and in 1999 55,000, half of which
are converts from Islam. The remainder are from other religious
minorities or from Christian families.

Occasionally even evangelical leaders from Western countries
are being subjected to the Iranian justice system, that is, if they dare to
enter the country at all. For example, Stuart Timm, a South African
citizen, was kept in custody for 26 days while on holiday in Iran in
1997\. He was released only after the South African government
exerted extensive pressure. Another example is Daniel Baumann, who
holds dual Swiss and American citizenships, who was denied contact
with either embassy.38 In both cases no charges were laid and no
explanation was given.

WEA religious liberty press release:
Iran - Apostasy law
Keywords    Iran, apostasy law, death penalty, WEA, appeal.
February 18, 2009: [The World Evangelical Alliance] strongly
condemns the systematic and ongoing violations of religious freedom,
including prolonged detention, torture, and executions based primarily
or entirely upon the religion of the accused, especially for religious
minorities such as Protestant Christians.

WEA notes that the constitution of Iran formally recognizes
Christians as protected religious minorities who may worship freely and
have autonomy over their own matters of personal status. Nevertheless,
the primacy of Islam and Islamic laws, in particular the recent Apostasy
law, adversely affects the rights and status of Christian minorities, who
are already subject to severe forms of discrimination.

WEA acknowledges that Christians in Iran, in particular
Evangelicals, continue to be subject to harassment, arrests, close
surveillance, and imprisonment. WEA also recalls that the Iranian
President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad reportedly has called for an end to
the development of Christianity in Iran, and that over the past few
years, there have been several incidents of Iranian authorities raiding
church services, detaining worshippers and church leaders, and
harassing and threatening church members.

WEA expresses concern over the recent penal code revision, and
opposes the death penalty as a matter of law and policy. This law
clearly violates the Islamic Republic of Iran’s commitments under the
international human rights conventions, by codifying serious
punishments, including the death penalty on converts from Islam.
Therefore, it is considered in itself a clear violation of Article 6 of the
International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights which reads:
“Every human being has the inherent right to life” an important and
binding international document which Iran has ratified in 1975
without any pre-conditions, in addition to Article 3 of the Universal
Declaration of Human Rights which reads: “Everyone has the right to
life”, and Article 18 of the same declaration which reads: “Everyone
has the right to freedom of thought, conscience and religion.”

132           IJRF Vol 1:1 2008                             WEA Press Release

WEA hereby expresses its deep and grave concerns and
apprehension of the implications of the Penal Code, which sets out a
mandatory death sentence for apostasy, in addition to other severe
limitations and restrictions on freedom of religion and belief.

Therefore, WEA calls upon the Iranian authorities, both in
government and parliament, to address the substantive concerns
highlighted in this letter, and to fully respect its human rights
obligations, in law and in practice.

WEA calls for abolishment of the death penalty carried out in the
absence of respect for internationally recognized safeguards.

WEA calls on all democratic governments at the highest levels,
to vigorously speak out publicly about the deteriorating conditions for
freedom of religion or belief in Iran, and draw attention to the need for
the international community to hold authorities accountable in specific
cases where severe violations have occurred or will occur especially in
respect to the recently passed Apostasy law that legalizes the death
penalty for apostates.

WEA calls on the UN Human Rights Council to monitor
carefully and call for with the recommendations of the representatives
of those special mechanisms that have already visited Iran,
particularly those of the UN Special Rapporteur on Freedom of
Religion or Belief (1995).
Dr. Geoff Tunnicliffe, Executive Director - International Director /

CEO, World Evangelical Alliance (WEA)
Mr. Godfrey Yogarajah, Religious Liberty Commission, World

Evangelical Alliance (WEA)

Christ-centered transformation within society. WEA exists to foster Christian
unity, to provide an identity, voice and platform for the 420 million evangelical
Christians worldwide.
