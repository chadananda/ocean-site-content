 Chinese Family Religion and World Religion

Yeo Yew Hock

Abstract

This article examines the practice of filial piety and ancestor worship as
practised by the traditional Chinese people. It tries to understand and
enunciate the main principles that underlie this family oriented religion.
The careful maintenance of genealogies and moral instruction of children
with traditions of their forbears, help to keep the religious sentiments
alive, reinforce the lineage and family solidarity. The ancestral cult is
basic to Chinese religion, it is the one universal institution which has
moulded Chinese society into its traditional form. Its interests,
responsibilities, and loyalties tended to be focused inwards to the family
and lineage rather than outward to the public realm. Although the
Chinese people have never denied that there is an afterlife, they have
always viewed it in the context of ancestral lineage.

The major strength of the family religion lies in its strong family unity
wherever it is practised. Some Chinese philosophers have stated that to
love thy neighbour, one should start with the love of one's parents. But it
seems that the Chinese religion throughout the ages has developed into a
very elaborate inwardly focused family religion with deification of the
ancestors.

The family as an institution occupies a high place in Baha'i beliefs.
However, in contrast to the Chinese religion, the Baha'i Faith is non-
hierarchical and more consultative in its approach towards family
relationships. The subservient role of women in the traditional Chinese
family is also contrary to the Baha'i principle of the equality of men and
women. This paper will critically examine the points of agreement and
divergence between the Chinese religion and the Baha'i Faith, with the
purpose of discovering how the two might be brought closer together.

Introduction

The family has been the most dominant and resilient social institution
throughout the history of the Chinese people. The family is of course
important in other cultures and closely connected with religion, with its
sacrament of marriage, its commandment to honour parents, and its duty
to raise children in moral instruction. But the religious character of the
Chinese family goes far beyond these aspects. This character, developing
out of so-called "ancestor worship," makes religion among the Chinese,
more a family matter, rather than one based on individual choice. The
family is the primary concern, while the individual and communal matters
are secondary. The family may be likened to a kinship corporation. In
order to understand the Chinese people's psyche, it is imperative to study
the principles underlying this particular ancient form of religion.

The Chinese people referred to throughout this paper are the traditional
people of China, Taiwan, Hong Kong, Malaysia, Singapore and other
parts of Asia. Although many of the original customs and religious rites
and rituals of the family religion have been modified or have even
disappeared because of Western influences, the basic practices and
philosophy are still well known and ever present in the psyche of the
Chinese people. It is significant that the Chinese civilisation is the oldest
extant and most continuous of those civilisations still remaining. The
practice of the family religion is a contributing factor to the enduring
nature of the Chinese civilisation.

By comparing and contrasting the practices of the Chinese family religion
to the Baha'i Faith, we hope to foster a better understanding of the
strengths, weaknesses, feelings, values and ethos of the^ Chinese people.
Unlike the Baha'i Faith which is a revealed religion, the Chinese family
religion does not have a Prophet Founder. The main proponent is
Confucius (551-479 BC) who is considered more a distinguished Teacher
and Philosopher, and who stated explicitly in his writings that he was not
a Prophet. "As to being a divine sage or even a Good Man, far be it for
me to make any such claim"1. He added, "A Divine Sage I cannot hope

1971, 7:37

ever to meet, the most I can hope for is to meet a true gentleman."2
However, the family religion was in existence long before the 6th Century
BC when Confucius lived.

The Family and God

For the Chinese, the hierarchy of the members of the family is clearly
delineated, and on which is based social protocol, customs and religious
rites. At the head of the household lineage is .he ancestor, then comes the
grandfather, then the father, followed by the eldest son. They are placed in
descending order of reverence, respect and authority.

In the Baha'i Faith, the individual's recognition of the "Oneness of the
Lord" precedes the family in spiritual significance. The family is also a
very important institution in the Baha'i Faith. Baha'u'Uah said:

> The fruits of the tree of existence are trustworthiness,
> loyalty, truthfulness and purity. After the recognition of
> the Oneness of the Lord, exalted be He, the most
> important of all duties is to have due regard for the rights
> of one's parents. This matter has been mentioned in all
> the Books of God.3

For the Baha'i, there cannot be a choice between the Family and the
Baha'i Faith, choosing the family is equivalent to choosing the Baha'i
Faith. Family relationships, like all other relationships, must be ultimately
founded in spiritual ties. Shoghi Effendi wrote:

> "Deep as are Family ties, we must always remember that
> the spiritual ties are far deeper; they are everlasting and
> survive death, whereas physical ties, unless supported by
> spiritual bonds, are confined to this life."4

Ancestor Worship

Ancestor worship is usually a practice associated with more primitive
cultures, and often a background element to more sophisticated ones.
However, for the Chinese it has been the very basis of their "high culture"
throughout history. There is evidence of the central role of the family
religion in Chinese culture since 1,000 BC, during the Shang or Yin
dynasty. The study of the early practice of oracle bones shows us clearly
how the religious system of the most ancient age in China was based on
ancestor worship.

The oracle bones were used as instruments of divination. The diviner
smoothed off the surface of a tortoise-shell or cattle scapula and bore into
this surface a series of concave depressions. He then scratched into the
reverse surface a question the king wished to put to the supernatural
powers. Touching a red-hot poker to the cavity beside the inscribed
question, the diviner produced cracks in the bone, which he then
interpreted as the response. The answer was noted down, and the
confirmation that the answer had been correct was often added to
maintain the credibility of the oracle. From a detailed study of such
questions and answers, according to Tung Tso-pin, a leading authority on
the subject, he concluded that despite their other religious beliefs "it was
still ancestor worship that held the most important position in the religious
life of the Yin people."5

However, ancestor worship is not just the ritual observances of
individuals, it is also the root from which the main trunk of the family
lineage tree with its many family branches grow.

Confined to Kinship Group

The first point to note about ancestor worship is that it is narrowly
confined to the kinship group (also called the tsu or family tree).
According to Confucius "Sacrifice to spirits which are not those of one's

Tung Tso-pin, An Interpretation of the Ancient Chinese Civilisation, Chinese
Association for the United Nations, Taipei, 1952 p 19.

own dead is [mere] flattery."6 Ancestor worship is therefore instrumental
in reinforcing family cohesion and lineage. In such a family cult, the dead
ancestor's personality continues to have an influence on the family and on
the eldest son long after he is dead. The assumption is also that there is
the possibility of contact between dead and living family members. The
original relationships remain in full force despite the death of a senior.
The love and fear of the son for the father is increased by the son's belief
in the father's continuing presence in spiritual form. In this way, many of
the ancestors are deified.

In contrast, the Baha'i Faith extends allegiance from the family to the
service of the human family. 'Abdu'1-Bahá said:

> "When you love a member of your family or a
> compatriot, let it be with a ray of the Infinite Love! Let it
> be in God, and for God! Wherever you find the attributes
> of God love that person, whether he be of your family or
> of another."7

Family Lineage System and the Role of Women

The Chinese word for family lineage is Tsu (or tree). It refers to the male
descendants of a common ancestor, bearing the same surname, and
includes their wives and children. As the Tsu is patrilineal, the families of
wives are excluded. A woman marries into her husband's lineage and her
relationship with her father's lineage becomes minimal. The term for the
women's lineage is "outside-tsu" or "outside relatives."

For the traditional Chinese, the role of the woman is inferior to. that of the
man as the attention of the Chinese family is focused on the male heir.
Marriage is looked upon as a means of perpetuating this all-important
end. If she cannot fulfil this duty then the husband is allowed by his
parents to take a concubine to try and procreate the male heir. The

women's rights are few. Priority of education is also given to the males in
the family and often women are not accorded an education.

In the Baha'i Faith, men and women have equal rights8. They are likened
to the two wings of a bird, where mankind represents the bird. Just as the
bird cannot fly without its two wings being balanced, so the equality of
men and women is necessary for humanity to make progress. Also in the
Baha'i Faith, the education of daughters takes precedence over the sons,
as the woman is considered to be the first teacher of the child in the
family.9

Status of Ancestors
During the Chou dynasty, the ancestors of the ruling house are pictured as
dwelling "on high" in some sort of close association with, and subordinate
to, the Supreme Ruler in Heaven (Tien). From this position they derive
their power over their descendants. It is believed that they could intercede
with Tien to send down blessings or calamities:

> "It is not that our former kings will not assist us, their
> descendants. It is just that Your Niajesty is dissolute and
> cruel, and is thereby bringing about his own ruin.

Therefore Heaven rejects us."10

> "The recorder then [wrote] the prayer on wooden strips.
> It said, your first grandson So-and-So has met with a
> severe illness. If you three Kings are in fact obligated [to

In some respects the practice of praying to and offering assistance to the
souls of dead relatives is similar to the Baha'i belief in the power of
prayer. It is believed that the prayers of the Concourse on High (that is,
those pure souls that are traditionally believed to go to Heaven) can
answer our prayers and bless us in this world.

Role of Lineage

A major difference between Chinese and Western families is the vital role
of lineage in the Chinese system. In the West, the family nucleus typically
splits off from the patrilineal stem. The ancestors precede us biologically,

98            THE SINGAPORE BAHAT STUDIES REVIEW

but not socially. Among the Chinese, families typically remain attached to
their lineage and are organically parts of a larger functioning whole. The
lineage with its families might be more or less cohesive, depending on
various economic and social factors. The family lineage system is rooted
in a single founding ancestor. From this individual, down through the
eldest son of each generation, a family line is perpetuated for many
generations. This lineage system may last for several hundred years.

The lineage structure is a powerful tool in determining hierarchy and
enshrining order in the extended family. It places each individual in a
specified position with regards to all other relatives, according to
generation and collateral distance. These relative positions are not only
indicated by kinship terms but are strikingly exemplified in the degrees of
mourning during the funeral of the father. The closer the relationship, the
more elaborate the ceremonial grief required. Thus, according to the
funeral rites, the eldest son has to wear the coarsest sackcloth for the
longest time (three years) in mourning for his parents, whereas a more
usual style of dress can be worn by the male cousin for only nine months.
The elaborate mourning rites and wearing of mourning garments for long
periods of time served to renew the lineage ties, especially in ancient times
when life expectancy was short and deaths in an average tsu were
frequent. Although these elaborate customs and rituals are no longer
closely followed by most contemporary Chinese families in Singapore, the
respect and reverence underlying all these family religious rites are still
present during funerals, weddings, births and other anniversaries.

Lineage solidarity was also strengthened by family offerings made in the
ancestral temple. This temple contains the tablets believed to be inhabited
by the spirits of all the lineage's deceased members. Here the souls of the
ancestors were visibly displayed in many rows of wooden tablets, standing
in order of their seniority of relationships and generations on shelves
under the tablet of the High Ancestor of the lineage. Periodically, all
available members of the lineage would assemble in the temple to offer
their communal sacrifices to their forefathers. Genealogical records, often
kept for many centuries, as well as "family instructions" written by
leading personalities, were also used to stress and maintain the unity of
the family lineage.

The Chinese State in ancient times always operated through the Family
system. It reinforced the institution of the tsu and its constituent families
by leaving in the hands of village elders, all governmental authority,
except that which was unavoidably the State's responsibility, like for
example defence matters. The State also backed up the family lineage
prescriptions for proper conduct (li) with criminal law (fa). At the same
time, the prayerful and spiritual attitudes of the Chinese family members
towards their ancestors played an important role in ancient times for the
education, discipline and the moral code of the next generation of Chinese
people.

In the Baha'i Faith, ancestors are respected, but not deified. There are no
rituals and rites attached to the funerals of the father and relatives or
anniversaries held for their deaths. Commemoration is done via prayer
and reading of the holy Baha'i writings. The use of lineage positions,
funeral rites and rituals to establish order and hierarchy are absent in the
family.

Functions of Li

To understand further the religious character of the Chinese family we
now take a look at the li system of proper conduct. The functions of li
extend from the most important religious ceremonies to the trivialities of
daily etiquette. Li serves primarily to demarcate the senior from the
junior, the superior from the inferior. It means proper deportment for all
social circumstances. In our age of exceptional freedom of thought and
behaviour, the elaborate functions of li may appear to involve
unnecessary hair-splitting. It serves, however, to provide an anthology,
allowing us to understand the society of the ancients. Confucius himself
was an authority on //, and the school that developed to spread his
teachings laid great stress on the subject. To understand the background
and meaning of the codes of li we refer to this passage by Confucius:

> "They are the rules of propriety [//] that furnish the
> means of determining (the observances towards) relatives,
> as near and remote; of settling points which may cause
> suspicion or doubt; of distinguishing where there should
100              THE SINGAPORE BAHÁ1 STUDIES REVIEW

> be agreement, and where difference; and of making clear
> what is right and what is wrong... To cultivate one's
> person and fulfil one's words is called good conduct.
> When the conduct is (thus) ordered, and the words are
> accordant with the (right) course, we have the substance
> of the rules of propriety...
> The parrot can speak and yet is nothing more than a bird;
> the ape can speak, and yet is nothing more than a beast.
> Here now is a man who observes no rules of propriety; is
> not his heart that of a beast... Therefore, when the sages
> arose, they framed the rules of propriety in order to teach
> men, and cause them, by their possession of them, to
> make a distinction between themselves and brutes."14

The profound influence of // is also seen in this passage:

> "In the right government of a state, the Rules of Propriety
> serve the same purpose as the steelyard in determining
> what is light and what is heavy; or as the carpenter's line
> in determining what is crooked and what is
> straight...When a superior man (conducts the government
> of his state) with a determining attention to these rules, he
> cannot be imposed by traitors and impostors. Hence he
> who has an exalted idea of the rules, and guides his
> conduct by them, is called by us a mannerly gentleman,
> and he who has no such exalted idea, and does not guide
> his conduct by the rules, is called by us one of the
> unmannerly people. These rules (set forth) the way of
> reverence and courtesy; and therefore when the services
> of the ancestral temple are performed according to them,
> there is reverence; when they are observed in the court,
> the noble and the mean have their proper positions; when
> the family is regulated by them, there is affection between
> father and son, and harmony among brothers; and when

\[14\] Li Ki [Chi], translated by James Legge, Oxford, England: Oxford University Press,
1885, book one, I, 1, pp. 62ff

> they are honoured in the country districts and villages,
> there is the proper order between old and young."15

Thus the // system serves mainly to establish hierarchy. Whether it refers
to an individual's place at the social level or to the tsu (family), the
underlying principle is hierarchical. Similarly, whether it is discussing
secular or religious issues:

> "The son of Heaven [the king] sacrifices (or presents
> oblations) to Heaven and Earth; to the (spirits presiding
> over the) four quarters; to (the spirits of) the hills and
> rivers; and offers the five sacrifices of the house—all in
> the course of the year. The feudal princes present
> oblations, each to (the spirit presiding over) his own
> quarter; to (the spirits of) its hills and rivers; and offer the
> five sacrifices of the house—all in the course of the year.
> Great officers present the oblations of the five sacrifices
> of the house—all in the course of the year. (Other)
> officers present oblations to their ancestors."16

Based on //, the hierarchy of the Chinese traditional family is defined and
related to male lineage in the family. In contrast, the Baha'i Faith is more
consultative and democratic and not hierarchical in nature.

> "Regarding thy question about consultation of a father
> with his son, or a son with his father, in matters of trade
> and commerce, consultation is one of the fundamental
> elements of the foundation of the Law of God. Such
> consultation is assuredly acceptable, whether between
> father and son, or with others. There is nothing better
> than this. Man must consult in all things for this will lead
him to the depths of each problem and enable him to find

the right solution."

102               THE SINGAPORE BAHAT STUDIES REVIEW

There are also certain duties and mutual obligations amongst family
members in the BaháT Faith, but unlike the Chinese Family, they are not
part of a hierarchical system. There is no ranking based upon male family
members, and there is no over-riding need to produce a male heir. From
the BaháT perspective, the unity of the family is the prime concern,
wherein each family member plays a complementary role.

> "According to the teachings of Baha'uTlah, the family
> being a human unit must be educated according to the
> rules of sanctity. All the virtues must be taught the
> family. The integrity of the family bond must be
> constantly considered and the rights of the individual
> members must not be transgressed. The rights of the son,

> none of them must be arbitrary. Just as the son has

> conserved, yet the unity of the family must be sustained.
> The injury of one shall be considered the injury of all; the
> comfort of each the comfort of all; the honour of one the
> honour of all."18

Filial Piety

The effectiveness of the li code of behaviour throughout the centuries can
be attributed to the age-old doctrine in China called "hsiao", or "filial
piety." It means variously, obedience to authority, obedience to the older
generation, respect, reverence and gratitude to parents and senior
relatives.

For millennia, Chinese social values have been dominated by the ethical
concept of filial piety. The prevailing influence of this concept has

\[18\] Family Life, p 12

permeated every aspect and activity of Chinese life and society. In reply to
a question about what hsiao is, Confucius said,

> "While [the parents] are living, serve them with //; when
> they die, bury them with li\ sacrifice to them with 11 "19

From Mencius, the authority second only to Confucius:

> "Which is the greatest duty? Duty to parents is the
> greatest... Among our many duties, the duty of serving
> the parents is fundamental...."20

From the Hsiao Ching, a work that attributes sayings from Confiicius, is
this famous passage:

> "Filiality is the root of virtue, and that from which
> civilisation derives... The body is, the hair and skin are
> received from our parents, and we dare not injure them:
> this is the beginning of filiality. [We should] establish
> ourselves in the practice of the true Way, making a name
> for ourselves for future generations, and thereby bringing
> glory to our parents: this is the end of filiality. Filiality
> begins with the serving of our parents, continues with the
> serving of our prince, and is completed with the
> establishing of our own character."21

Again, from the same work:

> "In serving his parents the filial son is as reverent as
> possible to them while they are living. In taking care of
> them he does so with all possible joy; when they are sick
> he is extremely anxious about them; when he buries them
> he is stricken with grief; when he sacrifices to them he

> does so with the utmost solemnity. These five [duties]
> being discharged in full measure, then he has been able
> [truly] to serve his parents."22

> "There are three thousand [offences] meriting the five
> punishments, but there is no crime greater than
> unfiliality"23

In ancient China, unfilial conduct was a serious crime under the law of the
family religion. It was the right of parents to put an unfilial child to death,
or at least to denounce him or her to the authorities for punishment, as
prescribed in clearly defined criminal statutes. Cursing one's parents was
a capital offence. The following behaviour were indictable:

> The grounds for such an accusation were the prosecution
> or cursing of one's grandparents or parents; not living
> with grandparents or parents and separating one's
> property from theirs; failure to support one's
> grandparents or parents; marrying, entertaining, or
> ceasing to observe mourning before the end of the
> required mourning period; concealing a parent's death;
> and falsely announcing a grandparent's or parent's
> death... However, if a parent prosecuted a child as unfilial
> on other grounds, the authorities would not reject the case
> for this reason.24

Filial piety is thus the basis of family relationships, the cardinal virtue bf
the good person, and the most powerful force operating to maintain the
orderliness and structure of society required by the Chinese State in
ancient times.

In the Baha'i Faith, filial piety is also very important for the family.
Baha'u'llah states: "Verily, We have enjoined on every son to serve his

father" 25. This duty for the son to obey his father is similar to Chinese
filial piety.

Marriage

Marriage is often closely associated with the preservation of the future
generation. But the traditional Chinese family tends to think of it as the
most important requirement for the support of the older generation and the
generation that had already passed away. The duty of Chinese children
was defined in terms of devoting themselves without reservation to the
welfare of their parents. The duty of a son's wife was to share in her
husband's complete devotion to his parents. The personal feelings of the
son and his wife were secondary to their responsibility towards
safeguarding the interests of the son's parents. The codes of the li
contained clear instructions about it:

> "[Sons and sons' wives] should go to their parents and
> parents-in-law [on the first crowing of the cock]. On
> getting to where they are, with bated breath and gentle
> voice, they should ask if their clothes are (too) warm or
> (too) cold, whether they are ill or pained, or
> uncomfortable in any part; and if so, they should proceed
> reverently to stroke and scratch the place. They should in
> the same way, going before or following after, help and
> support their parents in quitting or entering (the
> apartment). In bringing in the basin for them to wash, the
> younger will carry the stand and the elder the water; they
> will beg to be allowed to pour our the water, and when
> the washing is concluded, they will hand out the towel.
> They will ask whether they want anything, and then
> respectfully bring it. All this they will do with an
> appearance of pleasure to make their parents feel at
> ease...While the parents are both alive, at their regular
> meals, morning and evening, the (oldest) son and his wife

\[25\] Kitáb-1-Aqdas, verse 104 in "Questions and Answers", p 138

> will encourage them to eat everything, and what is left
> after all, they will themselves eat...

> No daughter-in-law, without being told to go to her own
> apartment, should venture to withdraw from that (of her
> parent-in-law). Whatever she is about to do, she should
> ask leave from them. A son and his wife should have no
> private goods, nor animals, nor vessels; they should not
> presume to borrow from, or give anything to, another
> person. If any one give the wife an article of food or
> dress, a piece of cloth or silk, a handkerchief for her
> girdle, an iris or orchid, she should receive and offer it to
> her parents-in-law. If they accept it, she will be glad as if
> she were receiving it afresh. If they return it to her, she
> should decline it, and if they do not allow her to do so,
> she will take it as if it were a second gift, and lay it by to
> wait till they may want it."26

No doubt nowadays, such archaic practices are rare. The son and his wife
were required to live with his parents, owed absolute obedience to them,
and had no independent property rights. Chinese literature is full of
edifying stories about filial sons and daughters and daughters-in-law who
were reputed to have sacrificed everything for the comfort and wellbeing
of their parents.

Marriage, far from being a union between a man and a woman to satisfy
personal desires, was primarily a family matter. The bride was chosen by
the son's parents and usually, the couple would never have met before the
wedding. Everything about the betrothal and wedding, including the
religious sanctions, was calculated to reinforce the subordination of the
young couple to the bridegroom's family, especially his parents.

The expensive gifts given to the bride's family emphasised that she was in
fact being purchased by the boy's parents for their son. The matching of
the horoscopes and the traditional belief that marriages were "made in

on hard-headed business or "political" considerations by parents and "go-
betweens". Formal worship of the bridegroom's ancestors brought the
bride under the supernatural authority of her husband's forefathers and
reminded her that her membership in her natal lineage was terminated.
She was now a probationer among the relatives of her husband, and both
she and her husband were economically dependent on his parents. Only by
earning the respect and tolerance of the parents could the new wife gain
security in her role; thus filial conduct towards her parents-in-law was
literally a matter of life and death. The institution of marriage is therefore
used as a means to an end; the main purpose being to produce the male
heir to perpetuate the family lineage.

In contrast, the Baha'i view on marriage is more democratic, where love
should dominate the marriage. It is also a spiritual union between the
couple and believed to be a bond that lasts forever,

> "Marriage, among the mass of the people, is a physical
> bond, and this union can only be temporary, since it is
> foredoomed to a physical separation at the close. Among

Moreover, Baha'u'Uah declares the purpose of marriage should be to
produce a new generation who will recognise Him, "enter into wedlock, O
people, that ye may bring forth one who will make mention of Me and My
servants"28.

The Key Role of the Eldest Son

In the family religion, bearing children was regarded as essential to a
couple's filial responsibihties, as said by Mencius, "There are three ways
in which one may be unfilial, of which the worst is to have no heir."29 Not
to have an heir was a major offence to the family because without an heir
the ancestral sacrifices would have to be discontinued. In cases where the
wife cannot produce a son and a concubine does not bear a son, often a
son from a close relative would be adopted as an heir. If there is more
than one son, then the eldest would have to take over the responsibilities
to the ancestors.

The eldest son has a special position. He is destined to replace the father
as the head of the family. He is the principal sacrificiant to the ancestors.
All the younger siblings have to pay him the same obedience and respect
that they owed to the father. Thus the male descendant of the lineage has
special status in the family tree as indicated in this passage:

> "Eldest [male] cousins in the legitimate line of descent
> and their brothers should do reverent service to the son,
> who is the representative chief of the family and his wife.
> Though they may be richer and higher in official rank
> than he, they should not presume to enter his house with
> (the demonstrations of) their wealth and dignity... A

> wealthy cousin should prepare two victims, and present
> the better of them to his chief. He and his wife should
> together, after self-purification, reverently assist at his
> sacrifice in the ancestral temple. When the business of
> that is over, they may venture to offer their own private
> sacrifice."30

Thus it is very important for the Chinese to have a male heir, as this is the
means that the tsu will be perpetuated and the family name will be
immortal and have continuity. It is commonly said that the father who has
healthy sons and grandsons is quite satisfied and will die graciously at his
deathbed. Understood in this way, the culminating acts of li are those of
ancestor worship.

The Baha'i Faith however, does not believe in progeniture. There are no
elaborateritualsand customs specifically for showing respect to the eldest
son and the ancestors. Social order for Baha'is comes from spiritual
qualities and adherence to the divine laws as laid down by Baha'u'llah.
However, in the Baha'i writings, special mention is made of the role and
responsibilities of the eldest son:

> "In all the Divine Dispensations the eldest son hath been
> given extraordinary distinctions. Even the station of
> prophet hath been his birthright. With the distinctions
> given to the eldest son, however, go concomitant duties.
> For example, he has the moral responsibility, for the sake
> of God, to care for his mother and also to consider the
> needs of the other heirs."31

The Baha'i writings indicate the importance of educating the children to
know God early. If this is done, then respect and love of parents will
follow. The responsibilities of children towards their parents derive from
the appreciation of what their parents have done for them Significantly,

the gratitude of the children towards their parents is a point of agreement
between the Baha'i Faith and Chinese tradition.

The Mutual Dependence of Dead and Living

The relationship of mutual dependence, with its expectation of tangible
blessings in exchange for filial nourishment, may be said to describe the
common attitude of the Chinese to the present. It involves a proper
ceremonial funeral, burial in a grave auspiciously located according to the
principles of Feng-Shui34, a tablet reverently set up and regularly given

\[34\] This is usually called "geomancy" in Western writings and its literal meaning is
"wind and water." Feng-Shui constitutes a system of divination for determining the

homage. There are also more formal rites and observances on special
occasions. For all these demonstrations of the continuing love and
remembrance of their descendants, the ancestors are believed to provide
them with the sorts of things any parents would wish for their children:
good luck, health, happiness, official position, wealth, sons, love of virtue,
long life, and a peaceful death. The educated Chinese elite (the literati)
has a less literal and more rationalistic belief:

> "He sacrificed as if [the deceased] were present; he
> sacrificed [to the spirits] as if those spirits were
> present."35

> "The Master did not discuss strange phenomena, feats of
> strength, disorders, or spirits."36

> Chi Lu asked about serving the souls of the dead. The
> Master said, "Not being able [adequately] to serve
> [living] men, how can we serve the souls of the dead?"
> [The disciple then said,] "I venture to ask about death."
> [The Master] said, "Not yet knowing about life, how can
> we know about death?"37

These passages did not mean that Confucius did not believe in the
supernatural. Confucius gave us many statements referring to Heaven, to
the power of Heaven, and even to Heaven's protection and sponsorship of
Confucius himself. He was regarded by later generations as the final
authority on //, and the Analects38 show that he took the ancestral rites
very seriously.

However, the most explicit explanations of the ancestral rites are given by
the philosopher, Master Hsun (c. 340 - 245). He said:

Baha'is believe that first and foremost, one needs to look after one's own
soul and develop spiritual qualities while still living in this world. There
are no rites and no material sacrifices or offerings to be performed when
Baha'is pray to the souls of the dead. Our prayers can assist the souls of
our loved ones and our friends in the next world. But the effectiveness of
the prayers depends on our sincerity. The Baha'i concept of after-life
includes the soul's journey towards God:

Family Bonds

The main characteristic and social contribution of the Family religion lies
in its powerful unifying force. The family throughout 2,500 years of
history has provided the moral and ethical basis to Chinese society.
Mencius believed the family to be the fundamental unit of society. He
said: "The root of the empire is in the state, and the root of the state is in
the family."42 In his book called, The Great Learning, Mencius advocated
that:

> "In order rightly to govern the state, it is necessary first
> to regulate the family; in order to put the empire in peace

\[41\] J. E Esslemont, Baha 'u'llah and the New Era, BaháT Publishing Trust, Wilmette,
Elinois, 1980, p 190

\[42\] The Book of Mencius, P/A.5.

> and prosperity, it is necessary first to regulate the
> state."43

The orderly structure of the Chinese Family, uniform and homogeneous
throughout China, is probably the major factor contributing to the long
lasting nature of Chinese civilisation, the world's oldest continuous
civilisation.

The Baha'i Faith also comes to renew belief in the sacredness of family
bonds and reaffirms the family institution. From the Baha'i perspective,
family bonds are essentially religious in nature. Family commitments are
not separated from service to the Baha'i Faith, or humanity as a whole.
In fact, service to the family is considered to be a means by which a
Baha'i can contribute to the Baha'i Faith. Baha'u'llah, addressing
children, states:

> "Beware lest ye commit that which would sadden the
> hearts of your fathers and mothers. Follow ye the payth of
> Truth which indeed is a straight path. Should anyone give
> you a choice between the opportunity to render a service
> to Me and a service to them, choose ye to serve them, and
> let such service be a path leading you to Me. This is my
> exhortation and command to thee."44

About Posterity and Immortality

The Chinese people's idea of posterity is based on the propagation of the
family name. For them it is critical to continue the lineage passed down
from the ancestors. The eldest son must at all costs have a healthy male
heir to perpetuate the family surname, and the latter should carry on in the
same tradition. If all this happens, then the father is satisfied that he has
done his duty for family lineage continuity, immortality and posterity and
he can grow old and die gracefully. In a sense he feels that he has fulfilled
his earthly life mission of his forefathers. His soul will also be looked

\[43\] The Great Learning, translated by James Legge, 2d ed (Oxford, 1892), 1.4.

\[44\] Family Life, p 2
116                THE SINGAPORE BAHA'I STUDIES REVIEW
after. His children will continue praying and sacrificing to his family's
dead souls, including his soul when he is dead.

The Baha'i concept of posterity and immortality is based on looking after
one's soul in this world and in the next world. In this earthly life, Baha'is
must recognise the Station of Baha'u'llah and obey His laws. What we do
in this life will affect our souls in the spiritual world.

> "As to the soul of man after death, it remains in the
> degree of purity to which it has evolved during life in the
> physical body, and after it is freed from the body it
> remains plunged in the ocean of God's mercy."45

Social Life

Regarding social life, the Chinese people essentially expanded or extended
family life into a larger arena. This was an expansion of the practice of
filial piety. In the Chinese community, kinship was formed through the
marriage relationship, clans were established through blood relationship.
The same respect demanded of children for their elders within the family
was extended to apply to teachers*, and other figures of social authority.
The family hierarchy was translated into social ranking. Based on this
traditional model alone, it is difficult for the Chinese people to assimilate
and inter-penetrate other cultures, and vice-versa.

Baha'i communities are less bound by kinship ties and social hierarchy.
Instead, Baha'is are concerned with forging spiritual ties and the Baha'i
Faith is democratic in its system of administration. As a result, the Baha'i
Faith is able to attract and assimilate people from a wide range of
different religious and racial backgrounds, and is not restricted to a
particular family or ancestor. The wider loyalty inherent in the Baha'i
Faith may help to integrate the practitioners of the Chinese Family
Religion to other cultures.

\[45\] 'Abdu'1-Bahá, Paris Talks, p 66

Conclusion

The Family religion's practices of filial piety and ancestor worship have
made the Chinese people a very family oriented type of society. Its
practitioners are generally focused on their families and are parochial in
their outlook towards the world at large. The Family is all-important to
them, and the principle that "blood is thicker than water" is very
pervasive. For the Chinese people, the prosperity and immortality of a
male individual meant the continuity of his family lineage and "surname".
Women are treated less than equal and are valued only as the means to
obtaining the male heir.

In a world that is becoming smaller and more integrated, the practices of
the family religion are not easily understood or accepted outside Chinese
communities. However, the reverence, respect and prayerful attitude
shown by the Chinese people for their deceased has similarities to Baha'i
belief. The strong spiritual connection with the dead ancestors, albeit
expressed through material and earthly sacrifices at appropriate
anniversaries, is essentially in accord with the same sentiment expressed
in many Baha'i prayers. Also the gratitude which children are called upon
to show their parents is common to both religions.

Ironically, in many parts of the world today, the family as an institution is
under siege and breaking down, largely because of the influence of
materialism and consumerism. Key aspects of the Chinese Family
religion, such as respect, reverence and gratitude to elders, obedience of
children to their elders, are still values which are required today.

The Baha'i Faith extends the unity and bonds of the family religion to the
human family. The role of the family is still vital to the stability and unity
of society as a whole, but in the Baha'i Faith it becomes an integral part
of the global community. The survival of the Family religion depends on
how much it can universalise its faith. This goal is poetically described by
Baha'u'Uah in the following way:

"We desire but the good of the world and happiness of the
nations, yet they deem us a stirrer up of strife and sedition worthy of
bondage and banishment...That all nations should become as one in faith

118              THE SINGAPORE BAHÁT STUDIES REVIEW

and all men as brothers; that the bonds of affection and unity between the
sons of men should be strengthened; that diversity of religion should
cease, and differences of race be annulled... what harm is there in this?...
These strifes and this bloodshed and discord must cease, and all men be as
one kindred and one family... Let not a man glory in this, that he loves his
country; but let him rather glory in this, that he loves his kind."46
