     Finding the Trace of the Traceless Friend

Reflection on Bahá’í Scholarship as a Journey in the

Valley of Search

Wolfgang A. Klebel

Introduction

In this paper the attempt is made to shed some light at Bahá’í
Scholarship from the First Valley of the Seven Valleys of
Bahá’u’lláh, the Valley of Search. This Valley ends with the
words that were chosen as title for this paper:
> And if, by the help of God, he findeth on this journey a
> trace of the traceless Friend, and inhaleth the fragrance
> of the long-lost Joseph from the heavenly messenger, he
> shall straightway step into THE VALLEY OF LOVE and
> be dissolved in the fire of love. (SVFV 7)1

The combination of finding a “trace” of a “traceless friend”
indicates the mysteriousness and complexity of this task, and
introduces us into the mystical realm where words are used to
describe what is impossible to define, and what can only be
described in opposing concepts, which indicate an integral
reality and unity behind these words. The friend is found when
his fragrance is inhaled, when a trace is found and the finding is
a process which never ends, a journey which cannot be
concluded in a rational and factual way. It can only be a
nearness that is ephemeral like a fragrance, yet it is real and even

42                                             Lights of Irfán vol. 15

more real than physical reality. It is described as finding a trace
of somebody who does not leave a trace, who is traceless. It can
easily be seen by this ending of the Valley of Search that we will
have to be concerned to remain in the ambience of this mystical
description when carefully finding one of the many possible
interpretations and then translating these mystical concepts into
common language.

Through this conundrum with no solution, in this question
with no answer, a mystery is expressed that leads to a truth that
transcends logic and reason. Yet, it is not unreasonable, neither
is it illogical, actually, it is more and deeper and needs to be
experienced, leading to a totally new vision of reality. The
reflections presented here are certainly not comprehensive
because they are exceedingly limited for two reasons, one is that
the Words of Manifestations are inexhaustible, and the other is
that these thoughts are subjective and only represent what this
writer has experienced and found in an attentive reading of this
Tablet. Another limitation of this paper is the fact that only
selected passages of this text can be deeply reflected upon and
other sentences will be commented on with less depth in order
to stay within the frame of this investigation.

The introductory section of the Seven Valleys closes with the
following words, indicating that the purpose of this Book is
“that every man may thereby win his way to the summit of
realities, until none shall contemplate anything whatsoever but
that he shall see God therein.” (SVFV 1)2

Two considerations stand out here that will be guiding ideas
for this paper. One is the fact that this Tablet is written so that
every man may thereby win his way to the summit of reality. In
other words, this Tablet will open for everybody a new and
higher way to understand reality. The other thought is equally
important namely that this reality is such that it is revealing
God, so that God can be seen therein. Consequently, it should
not be surprising that the reflections presented in this paper are

The Traceless Friend                                             43

not necessarily consonant with modern ideas of scholarship;
rather, they will present a new understanding of it.

This new understanding was presented in a letter about Bahá’í
Scholarship, written on behalf of the Bahá’í Universal House of
Justice, October 7, 1980, presented here in three parts:

> The combination of absolute loyalty to the
> Manifestation of God and His Teachings, with the
> searching and intelligent study of the Teachings and
> history of the Faith which those Teachings themselves
> enjoin, is a particular strength of this Dispensation.

This searching after truth in the Teachings of the Faith is the
first of the obligations of a Bahá’í scholar and it is combined
with absolute loyalty to the Manifestation of God. This is
distinguished from the theology of previous dispensations
where extremes of blind literality are opposed by an extreme
position of doubts.

> In past Dispensations the believers have tended to divide
> into two mutually antagonistic groups: those who held
> blindly to the letter of the Revelation, and those who
> questioned and doubted everything. Like all extremes,
> both these can lead into error.

What most distinguishes the Bahá’í scholar from other
theologians is the “unfettered search after truth,” which has to
be executed with intelligence and understanding, it has to admit
the possibility of error and consequently needs to be marked by
maturity and forbearance. Disunity and discord must be
avoided by a humble understanding of the limited ability of the
scholar. The letter of the Universal House of Justice continues
in quoting Shoghi Effendi.

> The beloved Guardian has written that “The Bahá’í Faith
> ... enjoins upon its followers the primary duty of an
> unfettered search after truth...”. Bahá’ís are called upon
44                                              Lights of Irfán vol. 15

> to follow the Faith with intelligence and understanding.
> Inevitably believers will commit errors as they strive to
> rise to this degree of maturity, and this calls for
> forbearance and humility on the part of all concerned,
> so that such matters do not cause disunity or discord
> among the friends.3

This statement raises the question how can the “unfettered
search after truth” be combined with “absolute loyalty to the
Manifestation of God.” This is a crucial question that will be
dealt with throughout this paper. This is a question that all
Bahá’í scholars have to face, the question if the search for
unfettered truth must lead towards disloyalty to the
Administrative Order of the Faith. A relative high number of
Bahá’í scholars were unable to solve this problem and came to
the tragic conclusion to have to leave the Faith; some even
became outspoken enemies of the Faith. Bahá’u’lláh’s words in
the Valley of Search are expected to give us the answer to this
question, which deals with the philosophical, cultural and
religious conviction of the seeker, and how that relates to the
possibility of an unfettered search after truth.

How this unfettered search can be executed without conflict
and in loyalty to the Manifestation will be answered briefly here
and then explained at length. The answer is in the statement of
the question, even an unfettered search depends on the
preconditions and premises of the search. In simple words, if I
search in a place where the item to be found is not, I cannot
find it. In any search, in any travel, we must be at the right
point of departure, in order to go where we wish to go. As will
be explained below it is the issue of the hermeneutic circle,
every question, and every search starts with a foreknowledge
that determines its outcome. For example, if my understanding
of the world is strictly materialistic, no matter how much I
search I will never find God in this physical world, especially if I
make the assumption that what cannot be placed in space and
time and be counted, does not exist. In that case, any concept

The Traceless Friend                                             45

of transcendence, of the spiritual or of God is excluded and
cannot be found.

The following topics will be dealt with in this reflection on
the Valley of Search. Throughout these investigations the
question of unfettered search for truth versus loyalty to the
faith will be constantly kept in mind and will form the
background of these reflections.

> 1. Preconditions of search
2. Independent Investigation and the role of the heart,

culture and tradition
> 3. How to deal with distractions
> 4. The standard of Majnún, seek her everywhere
> 5. The exclusivity of search and sacrificing everything for it
6. Seeking the truth in every country, in every mind and in

every soul
This will lead the seeker into the next valley, the Valley of
Love on the journey to find a Trace of the Traceless Friend. It is
important that the scholar realizes that it is only a trace of the
truth that he is able to communicate to others, and that makes
his teaching valuable. On the other hand, this trace is the truth
— even though it is not the absolute truth — it is only the truth
that is available today, the truth that can be found in the
investigation of the scholar.

Searching for the trace of somebody who leaves no trace, i.e.,
is traceless, is certainly testing the patience of any scholar which
is indicated in the next paragraph where it is said; that the steed
of this Valley is patience.

Even if he searches a hundred thousand years in patience and
devotion, he never will reach the final truth, which can be
compared with the description of the Revelation of Bahá’u’lláh
as a limitless ocean. The scholar needs to ever be aware in

46                                              Lights of Irfán vol. 15

humility that he remains at the shores of this ocean; he can only
step into it.

When considering that the Valley of Search is the first valley
the wayfarer must pass to reach his goal, we must understand
that the study of the Writings, that scholarship is only the first
of the Seven Valleys, the first stride; a believer has to make in
his path. Contrary to all other previous religions, the Bahá’í
scholar is, therefore, not in a privileged position, he is not
superior to any other believer. He is the one who starts on the
first level in the Path of God like anybody else. He might be
specialized and therefore especially able to find things others
might miss. On the other hand he should never forget that it is
not scholarship or human learning, but purity of the heart,
which is needed to understand the Revelation, as Bahá’u’lláh has
stated.

> The understanding of His words and the comprehension
> of the utterances of the Birds of Heaven are in no wise
> dependent upon human learning. They depend solely
> upon purity of heart, chastity of soul, and freedom of
> spirit. This is evidenced by those who, today, though
> without a single letter of the accepted standards of
> learning, are occupying the loftiest seats of knowledge;
> and the garden of their hearts is adorned, through the
> showers of divine grace, with the roses of wisdom and
> the tulips of understanding. Well is it with the sincere in
> heart for their share of the light of a mighty Day! (KI 210)

Therefore, the scholar will never be the Priest or Mulláh like
in the Islamic community or the Theologian like in Christianity,
who stands above the regular believers because of his knowledge
and understanding of the revelation. While doing more in this
area of search than most people, as far as his scholarship is
concerned, he is studying only in the first Valley and needs to
progress personally through all the Seven Valleys. Otherwise his
research might only be touching the surface. Keeping up the
search but not proceeding through all the valleys could be

The Traceless Friend                                             47

compared to the tinkling cymbal of St. Paul (1 Cor. 13; 1-3), who
stresses the need for charity, just like here, after the valley of
Search follows the Valley of Love.

> Though I speak with the tongues of men and of angels,
> and have not charity, I am become as sounding brass, or
> a tinkling cymbal.

> And though I have the gift of prophecy, and understand
> all mysteries, and all knowledge; and though I have all
> faith, so that I could remove mountains, and have not
> charity, I am nothing.

> And though I bestow all my goods to feed the poor, and
> though I give my body to be burned, and have not
> charity, it profiteth me nothing.

Therefore, according to Bahá’u’lláh, after the Valley of
Search the wayfarer must pass the Valley of Love in order to
come to the Valley of Knowledge and only after that will he
reach the Valley of Unity with the Friend. This process is an
essential feature of the mystic path, which any seeker and any
scholar must pursue; all these elements need to be considered
when trying to reflect on any part of the Seven Valleys.
Additionally, this process of seven steps should not be
understood as a time bound process; it is an internal and
spiritual process as Bahá’u’lláh stated at the end of the Seven
Valleys, where he said:

> These journeys have no visible ending in the world of
> time, but the severed wayfarer — if invisible
> confirmation descend upon him and the Guardian of the
> Cause assist him — may cross these seven stages in seven
> steps, nay rather in seven breaths, nay rather in a single
> breath, if God will and desire it. And this is of “His
> grace on such of His servants as He pleaseth.”4 (SVFV 41)
48                                              Lights of Irfán vol. 15

Bahá’u’lláh often describes the truth in its diversity because
of the limitation of men, but when the wayfarer passes the
world of denial he can reach the world of Unity and Diversity,
the world of Limitation and Detachment as it is stated in the
Book of Certitude:

> Please God, that we avoid the land of denial, and
> advance into the ocean of acceptance, so that we may
> perceive, with an eye purged from all conflicting
> elements, the worlds of unity and diversity, of variation
> and oneness, of limitation and detachment, and wing our
> flight unto the highest and innermost sanctuary of the
> inner meaning of the Word of God. (KI 60)

‘Abdu’l-Bahá has interpreted this principle when He talked
about the way of understanding the limited from the unlimited,
or the lower level of reality from the higher.

> Now as to the infinite Power that knoweth no
> limitations; limitation itself proveth the existence of the
> unlimited, for the limited is known through the
> unlimited, just as weakness itself proveth the existence
> of power, ignorance the existence of knowledge, poverty
> the existence of wealth. Without wealth there would be
> no poverty, without knowledge no ignorance, without
> light no darkness. Darkness itself is a proof of the
> existence of light for darkness is the absence of light.

(TAF 20)

Without spiritual Unity there could not be Diversity, or to
say it philosophically, without the Whole there could not be any
Parts. In the same way it can be stated that without parts there
would not be any whole. Obviously, in this opposition the polar
concepts constitute each other. Considering the Integral Whole
(das “Integrale Ganze” in German5), one could say that unity in
diversity is just the other side of the same coin. The
consequences of this principle of Unity in Diversity, as

The Traceless Friend                                           49

mentioned here, towards understanding philosophy and
especially ontology cannot be pursued further here, but is
certainly of great importance.

This consideration is extremely important, because every
other kind of research which uses a methodology based on a
materialistic and reductionistic understanding of reality will not
find anything that is described in this tablet and is, therefore,
not only useless but destined to fail. A scholar may use the
methodology of material research in this area, because he is
trained and educated that way, and he might not even be
conscious of this. Often this will lead to consequences that are
destructive and will unquestioningly come to results that
contradict what is expressed in this Tablet. Therefore, the
premises and presuppositions of any research need to be kept in
mind and need to be further explored below.

Prerequisites of Search

In the first verse of this Valley of Search, Bahá’u’lláh
presents the following preconditions required of the wayfarer
who starts his search. The seeker must be aware of the
following:

> o He must use the steed of patience
> o He needs to avoid downheartedness and faltering
> o He should be strengthened by Service
o He will need to go from heedlessness to the realm of

being
> o He should not be held back by any bond
> o He must not be deterred by counsel
In the beginning of the mystical writings of the Valleys of
Search, Bahá’u’lláh begins with this remarkable statement giving
the reader a trace of what to expect.

50                                             Lights of Irfán vol. 15
> The steed of this Valley is patience; without patience the
> wayfarer on this journey will reach nowhere and attain
> no goal.

Patience is required for this enterprise of scholarship, of
searching; patience is the vehicle, the steed and mount, which
carries the wayfarer to his goal. It is interesting that patience
and forbearance are here mentioned as accelerating the search,
like the use of a horse will speed up any travel. Yet, patience is
the opposite of impatient zeal and eagerness, which are
seemingly the forces promoting speed. This seeming
contradiction, that a patient approach will speed up the travel
more than the speediest travel leads us patiently to the goal. On
the other hand, extreme inpatient behavior, will never lead
anywhere.

Any eager and hasty attempt to reach his goal is excluded
here. The zeal for scientific success and the anxious effort that
creates competition among scholars must be avoided, as it
would reach nowhere and attain no goal. This could be
compared with the Freudian statement that warns the analyst
not to be eager in striving for cure, since such “therapeutic
zeal” does not lead to a successful therapy. It is, rather,
counterproductive. The patience needed here is further
explained in the next sentence from the Kitáb-i-ˆqán, in His
tablets and the Hidden Words:

> He must never seek to exalt himself above any one, must
> wash away from the tablet of his heart every trace of
> pride and vain-glory, must cling unto patience and
> resignation, observe silence and refrain from idle talk.

(KI 193)

> It behoveth whosoever hath set his face towards the
> Most Sublime Horizon to cleave tenaciously unto the

> cord of patience, and to put his reliance in God, the
> Help in Peril, the Unconstrained. (TB 212)6

48. O SON OF MAN!

> For everything there is a sign. The sign of love is
> fortitude under My decree and patience under My trials.

(HW)
> Nor should he ever be downhearted; if he strive for a
> hundred thousand years and yet fail to behold the beauty
> of the Friend, he should not falter.

It could easily be seen that such an attitude is making a Bahá’í
scholar unique in modern academic circles, where success is
related to production and is judged by the prevailing
philosophical and political prejudices, so that true and
unfettered search is most of the time unacceptable and often
censured, when it contradicts accepted standards. When
patience is required not only as a precondition to search but
also as the carrying supposition of the unfettered search of the
scholar, the opposite condition becomes not only ineffective,
but is most of the time an active hindrance, leading to impatience
and to a superficial acceptance of something as truth, which is
not properly and patiently researched. Consequently, any
research without this steed of patience is suspect, is unscientific
and leads nowhere, or most of the time this “nowhere” is error
and falsity, is half-truth and delusion of truth.

Another quality, this patience gives the scholar, is the fact
that he needs to avoid being downhearted, being depressed and
giving up. As long as he rides his steed of patience he can go on
forever with his search and never give up, because the traces of
traceless friend will become manifest at the right time. This
attitude required by Bahá’u’lláh for the search is based on trust,
is based on the certitude that the search is not dependent on the

52                                             Lights of Irfán vol. 15

marginal ability of the researcher, but is supported and guided
by the beauty of the Friend, Who has promised guidance on the
path the scholarly pursuit is based on.

What this means in the practice of research is a trust in the
divine providence, that the right ideas, the proper sources and
the often accidental circumstances of researching will be guided
and will neither depend on the ingenuity of the scholar nor on
his effort and eagerness. What is required most of all is the
ability to accept and listen to the sources and to the people and
often to seemingly accidental happenings that inspire the
student of wisdom.

Approaching scholarship when being carried along by
patience is giving access and openness to the truth to appear,
enables the student to see and notice the truth and allows him to
see with the new eye, the new ear. The message he hears from the
Word of God, the truth he sees in the world of Creations will
penetrate into his new heart and then become conscious in his
mind, giving him a new mind, a new ability to express the truth
he has seen and heard.

> Then will the manifold favors and outpouring grace of
> the holy and everlasting Spirit confer such new life upon
> the seeker that he will find himself endowed with a new
> eye, a new ear, a new heart, and a new mind.

That allows him to see the universe, nature and science in a new
light and brings certitude of a new kind and station.

> He will contemplate the manifest signs of the universe,
> and will penetrate the hidden mysteries of the soul.
> Gazing with the eye of God, he will perceive within every
> atom a door that leadeth him to the stations of absolute
> certitude. He will discover in all things the mysteries of
> Divine Revelation, and the evidences of an everlasting
> Manifestation. (GWB 267)

Another question is the length of this search and when the
goal is reached. What could be the meaning of the statement of
Bahá’u’lláh, when He wrote “if he strive for a hundred thousand
years and yet fail.” What does Bahá’u’lláh mean when talking
about 100,000 years of searching, yet failing?

It is clear that such a number is more than a hyperbole for a
long search. Even saying for hundred years would be an
exaggeration for what any scholar possibly could do, hundred
thousand years are not simply an exaggeration, this number
must be indicating something different. What is meant here? Is
it talking about a search for eternity? Is it the progress of
humanity and not the individual researcher? All of these
interpretations and many others are possible, this writer prefers
another one. Normally, in any material search we go from
searching to finding and then having, possessing whatever we
were searching for. Even in our life when we have a life-long
search for example for a profession, for a spouse and other
serious goals, we hopefully end up with finding what we looked
for, with achieving our goals at work or finding a spouse we can
love and behold.

Obviously, in the search proposed in the Seven Valleys there
is no clear definable and reachable goal present. One reason is
obvious, what we search for is beyond reaching, the Beauty of
the Friend, the path to God does not have an end, is
inexhaustible and in some ways unknown and unreachable.

What is the solution to this hundred thousand year of
searching, which is explained as failing and not coming to an
end? One answer that comes to mind is this: the searching is not
a searching for a goal that would end the search, but that the
search itself is the goal and, therefore, it cannot end; or in other
words, the end is in the search and we are not expected to have a
reachable goal, or the goal is so far away, even beyond any reach
that we never can attain it and yet, searching for it is all what
we must and can do.

54                                            Lights of Irfán vol. 15

This vision of an endless yet meaningful search will give the
Bahá’í scholar a different approach to his final quest and all the
studies and research efforts are then seen from a higher point of
view. They become relative to the real search and the same
happens to all findings the scholar might achieve; they will never
become the source of pride and feeling of superiority over any
fellow searcher, even of the non-scholarly type. When the final
goal of search is the unknown, the infinite, or absolute, all of
which is beyond reach, then the relative differences between
searchers become minimal and must be neglected, because they
make no difference in the search effort.

Other conditions for the true seeker are added in the first
paragraph in the beginning of the valley of search. The scholar
who searches for truth needs to do this in the way of service and
he must stay away from heedlessness. Additionally, she needs to
be independent and not held to anyone and should not be
influenced by critical and bad counsel.
> In their search, they have stoutly girded up the loins of
> service... (SVFV 3)

Here another thought is introduced into the process of
search that is the value of service in the relation to the search.
As stated before, usually searching ends in finding and then in
sharing the findings with others, which is a service and the
function of this process is what distinguishes the scholar. This
sharing is the service the scholar provides. What about a search
that does not have a determined finding, a search that is
ongoing and never ending? How to share what is not yet or not
definitely found? It appears that such a sharing requires humility
because there is no pride in finding, there is only service in
continuing searching and sharing and communicating this kind
of searching to others.

What the scholar finds is only a new step forward in
understanding; there is no absolute truth to be found and what
is found is relative in relation of further searching and finding.
With this attitude the scholar will communicate this ongoing
searching to the pupil and will consequently elevate the pupil to
the level of a fellow searcher, and the unity of searching is the
goal, not the finding. Actually this unity of all fellow searchers
requires that the scholar listens to everybody, as it is stated later
on in this Valley of Search so eloquently.

The service of the scholar is not in teaching the uneducated,
the nonprofessional, but in sharing this new form of search
which elevates every student of the Writings into the state of a
fellow searcher. In this way searching and scholarship becomes
consultation, consultation with every fellow searcher and the
true consultation consists in listening and accepting any
opinion, without prejudice, especially not the prejudice of the
learned towards the uneducated. This consideration is preparing
us to understand what is said later about where to search and
where to find.

In the next sentence the wayfarers

> … seek at every moment to journey from the plane of
> heedlessness into the realm of being. No bond shall hold
> them back, and no counsel shall deter them. (SVFV 4)

It is remarkable that Bahá’u’lláh opposes the plane of
heedlessness with the realm of being. Heedlessness is lack of
care and negligence; both are not only moral concepts but
attitudes that affect intellectual honesty and rational integrity.
The search is not an “either/or”; it is a process, a journey, which
everyone has to go through. We all are wayfarers in this Valley
of Search that leads us from heedlessness, from carelessness and
negligence into the realm of being, which is the realm of truth
and verity, the realm of actuality and reality.

56                                              Lights of Irfán vol. 15

Any objective finding, knowing and recognizing what is, is a
process, a vision; it is never a final position that can be reached,
owned and defended. Contrary to that, it consists in the
unification of polar opposites, which can only happen in the
process of living and searching; therefore, Bahá’u’lláh warns us
to not accept any bond and limit set from the outside and tells
us to be independent in regards of counsel. In other words, we
need to follow our own understanding, our own knowledge and
vision, as is expressed in the Hidden Word about justice. As a
matter of fact, this consideration will be repeated later on,
indicating the importance of this aspect, not only in regards to
the search for truth, but also about the search for justice, which
is praised by Bahá’u’lláh as a gift to mankind. We always need
to have before our eyes the following verse.

2. O SON OF SPIRIT!

> The best beloved of all things in My sight is Justice; turn
> not away therefrom if thou desirest Me, and neglect it
> not that I may confide in thee. By its aid thou shalt see
> with thine own eyes and not through the eyes of others,
> and shalt know of thine own knowledge and not through
> the knowledge of thy neighbor. Ponder this in thy heart;
> how it behooveth thee to be. Verily justice is My gift to
> thee and the sign of My loving-kindness. Set it then
> before thine eyes. (HW Ar. 2)

From Carelessness to Reality

Heedlessness is here opposed to reality, when using the
equivalent word carelessness for heedlessness, we realize what is
required. It is the care for ourselves and for “the other”,
because we cannot be a “self” if we do not understand ourselves
with the other, if we are not part of and participant in the
world of the other, in humankind. Developmentally, in the
child, the self is developed in the relationship to the other, to
the mother in the beginning and all other humans in the end. In

other words, we become a self when we learn to relate to
another, and the self is always consisting in this relationship.
Heedlessness and carelessness interrupt this relationship and
therefore, it interrupts the self in understanding him/herself,
the other and all other things. It is in this understanding that
Heidegger talks about “Sorge” or care as a fundamental concept
of ontology (“Dasein”), as comprehending self and others.

Ferdinand Ebner7 has described two ways of knowing, the
personal and substantial and has indicated that ignoring the ‘I —
Thou’ relationship of personally knowing the other, we lose
ourselves and end in what he calls self-isolation (Ich-
Einsamkeit), i.e. actually losing ourselves. This carelessness
cannot find reality as it really is and ends up in substantial
knowing, like knowing things and misses the value and meaning
of the person, of oneself and of others. Carelessness leads to the
loss of virtue, the loss of purpose in life and the loss of reality.

> Be not careless of the virtues with which ye have been
> endowed, neither be neglectful of your high destiny.

(GWB 196)

‘Abdu’l-Bahá about the people of Bahá points out what this
care can mean for the people of Bahá’í, when He stated:

> And that by their freedom from enslavement, their
> knowledge, their self-control, they shall be first among
> the pure, the free and the wise. (SWAB 150)

Concluding these preconditions of search, the seeker must be
aware of the following: This process of study, as it is laid out in
front of the seeker traveling on the steed of patience, being a
servant and caring will be examined further in the following
chapters in an attempt of a reflection on the Writings of
Bahá’u’lláh. These findings, which are here espoused in all
humility, are given to the reader, and will have to be critiqued,
corrected and extended in the sense of true consultation.

Independent Investigation and the role of the heart,
culture and tradition

With the next Verse Bahá’u’lláh tells us how to search by
describing what is required to have an independent
investigation, and interestingly he concentrates his focus upon
the heart and not the mind.

> It is incumbent on these servants that they cleanse the
> heart — which is the wellspring of divine treasures —
> from every marking, and that they turn away from
> imitation, which is following the traces of their
> forefathers and sires, and shut the door of friendliness
> and enmity upon all the people of the earth. (SVFV 4)

How do we understand this required cleansing of the heart?

In many places Bahá’u’lláh speaks about “… the human heart,
which is the recipient of the light of God and the seat of the
revelation of the All-Merciful ...” (GWB 186). The relative new
science of neurocardiology can give us some indication that
even from a scientific point of view the heart is much more
than a mechanical pump, but is also a neurological center that
can function independently from the brain, as is known in heart
transplants. In a previous paper of this writer the role of the
heart was described8, here only some relevant points will be
mentioned. According to neurocardiology

> Recent work in the relatively new field of neuro-
> cardiology has firmly reestablished that the heart is a
> sensory organ and a sophisticated information encoding
> and processing center. Its circuitry enables it to learn,
> remember and make functional decisions independent of
> the cranial brain.9

There are several reports that after a heart transplant many
basic preferences of the patient change.10 While not researched
because of patient confidentiality these reports need to be
taken seriously and it must be assumed that many more of what
usually is called unconscious is placed in the heart and not in the
brain. Whatever is known by the heart becomes conscious in the
brain as knowledge, which is understood as certainty. This
certitude distinguishes it from thought or opinion. Bahá’u’lláh
then gives us a warning that the heart may be affected by
markings, by some stain, in other words not be pure.
Consequently, He redirects the seeker to “turn away imitation,
which is following the traces of their forefathers and sires.”
From this statement we can understand that the marking, which
affects the purity of the heart, might be this imitation, this
following in the traditional ways of thinking.

My personal understanding of this sentence is as follows.

Following the traces of our intellectual ancestors or forefathers,
or thinking in traditional ways, means being restricted by their
way of thinking and unable to comprehend anything new. When
Bahá’u’lláh talks here about fathers and sires, we need to take
this at first in a concrete and practical way: everybody learns to
talk and think from his parents. Everybody grows up in a
specific cultural environment, first the environment of his
family, then of his school and only much later the cultural
environment of his time.

In the beginning the little child has no choice, but beginning
with the teen years, the youth starts selecting and eventually will
find his own understanding. We can say he is able to choose his
own intellectual fathers and follows them in his thinking. But he
never will totally shed the influence of his childhood.
Consequently, we can take this turning away from imitations in
a wider sense and include in it the whole cultural and
philosophical environment of any seeker into this consideration.

That raises another question for the scholar. Since all
thinking and searching happens in the context of the accepted

60                                            Lights of Irfán vol. 15

culture, how can we not think in the way of our forefathers?
Can we ever totally avoid the thinking style, the cultural ideas
and concepts that we have acquired throughout life? The word
used for this change in this translation is “turn away”, which is
equivalent with the word convert, which has the Latin root of
turning as well. So when we turn away from this imitation,
when we become converts to a new vision, what happens to the
traditional thinking? What do we have to do, how do we
convert to a new way of thinking? And how do we learn this
new way of thinking that is required here?

An indication of what to do is in the next sentence, where
Bahá’u’lláh requires us to “shut the door of friendliness and
enmity upon all the people of the earth.” Avoiding friendliness
and enmity, or love and hate for all people means, if nothing
else, to not be influenced by any feelings, positive or negative
towards people and their ideas and systems of though.

We need to avoid a seemingly contradiction in the Writings
of Bahá’u’lláh. When He states here that we need to shut the
door to friendliness and enmity He obviously means something
different than when He said. Consort with all men, O people of
Bahá, in a spirit of friendliness and fellowship. (GWB 288) The
answer is, that the demonstration of a spirit of friendliness is
mentioned when the talk is about how we should behave
towards individual people we meet, there friendliness is of
utmost importance. The other passage, about shutting the door
to friendliness and enmity has to understood according to this
statement

> We have, moreover, commanded you to cleanse your
> hearts from every trace of the love or hate of the
> peoples of the world, lest aught should divert you from
> one course or impel you towards another. (SLH 1)

Here it is meant the love or hate, the emotional involvement,
which leads us to accept one or the other side of an argument
and makes us prefer one or the other side of an opposing

understanding. In other words, we need to be free from
emotional attachment to certain ideas that are held by the
peoples of the world.

The mind needs not only to be free of any traditional
conventions and cultural influences, but the heart as well needs
to be free, without stain and not influenced by feelings of love
or hate towards anybody. One could state that this is an
intellectual and emotional stance of independence and
objectivity that is very difficult to achieve. This can only be
reached in a tangential process, in slowly coming closer and
closer to this ideal situation.

Additionally, we need to realize that this is a negative
requirement. It is, so to speak, a detachment (“de-tachment”)
from something negative, which requires necessarily a new
attachment (“ad-tachment”) to something, i.e. to something
positive and to a new way of thinking that is not yet mentioned
in this section, but is a requirement for the true seeker. It does
give a better understanding to the above mentioned fact that
patience needs to be the steed of this travel, from heedlessness
to the realm of being. Being detached we need to attach
ourselves to the Beloved, the fundamentals of His Faith and
then we can proclaim the new message, the Word of the
Manifestation as it is said here:

> So should be every one that claimeth to be a lover of the
> one true God. It behoveth him to fix his gaze upon the
> fundamentals of His Faith, and to labor diligently for its
> propagation. Wholly for the sake of God he should
> proclaim His Message, and with that same spirit accept
> whatever response his words may evoke in his hearer. He
> who shall accept and believe, shall receive his reward;
> and he who shall turn away, shall receive none other than
> his own punishment. (GWB 339)
62                                              Lights of Irfán vol. 15

The spirit of this service of teaching is indicated in the next
statement of Bahá’u’lláh, we have to be unrestrained and free
from any precondition when searching and teaching the faith.

Be unrestrained as the wind, while carrying the Message
> of Him Who hath caused the Dawn of Divine Guidance
> to break. Consider, how the wind, faithful to that which
> God hath ordained, bloweth upon all the regions of the
> earth, be they inhabited or desolate. Neither the sight of
> desolation, nor the evidences of prosperity, can either
> pain or please it. It bloweth in every direction, as bidden
> by its Creator. (GWB 339)

The question of basic assumptions in any scientific
endeavor

The required loyalty to the Revelation of the Manifestation
of God becomes for the Bahá’í scholar an important question.
Logically, there should not be any difference in having basic
assumption of different kind. For example, if I take the
assumption of Neo-Darwinism and regard the writings of
Darwin as the truth of evolution, or if I take the assumption of
the Progressive Movement based on Marxism, or the assumption
of Reductionism or the basic assumptions of any other
ideology, why would it be less scientific to have assumptions
that originate in a religious area, such as Christian, Islamic or
Bahá’í Revelation, or basic ideas of Buddhism or Hinduism?
Why is it regarded as less scientific to believe in the Bible, than
to believe in the Writings of Marx or Darwin? In this case one
could say that the Bible was written 2000 years ago, so there was
scientific progress that abolished the biblical truth.

Obviously, this argument does not hold true when
considering the Writings of the Bahá’í Faith, especially since
Marx and Darwin, for example, were contemporaries to
Bahá’u’lláh and the writings of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá and Shoghi Effendi
were written later. What other arguments can the scientific

community bring to show that religious assumptions are
unscientific? Is it the fact that religious writers did not use the
scientific method?

Shoghi Effendi has claimed that Bahá’ís believe that their
Revelation is scientific in its method, and this claim would have
to be disproven before scientists could be justified to call the
Bahá’í Writings unscientific:

> The Revelation proclaimed by Bahá’u’lláh, His followers
> believe, is divine in origin, all embracing in scope, broad
> in its outlook, scientific in its method, humanitarian in
> its principles and dynamic in the influence it exerts on
> the hearts and minds of men.11

This argument would lead us into the question about the
scientific method, considering that Shoghi Effendi did study in
Oxford and was familiar with this method and must have known
what this statement implied.

Obviously, neither Bahá’u’lláh nor ‘Abdu’l-Bahá had
academic schooling but does that mean they were necessary
uneducated and did not understand what they wrote? This would
have to be proven first, before their Writings can be dismissed
as unscientific. All of these issues need to be discussed first, but
an off-handed refusal to accept assumptions because they are
based on religion, is certainly unscientific, especially because
science spends very little effort answering these questions for
their respective fields. Moreover, most scientists take their
basic assumptions for granted and argue from them, but never
proof them.

This discussion raises the philosophical question, which is as
old as the logic of Aristotle: how to proof the first premise in a
deductive series of conclusions. Science cannot solve this
problem. It is rather a question of the philosophy of science,
but not a question of any particular science.

64                                             Lights of Irfán vol. 15

There are other first assumptions that cannot be proven by
the scientific method. Issues like this: “Why is there something
and not rather nothing?” or “Does reality exist?” or “What is
real and what is not real?” are not scientific questions but
belong into the philosophical area of discourse, where the
scientific method is not applicable.

For example, the Darwinist explanation of evolution by
accidental mutations and the survival of the fittest is one
explanation, and is held as truth, especially if other explanations
are excluded beforehand, such as a final goal of evolution or
any kind of pre-design. Here the assumption is made that only
mechanistic and material causes are existing in reality, and that
everything can be reduced to its most common and simplest
denominator. Typically, modern science assumes that reality is
such that all can be explained by efficient causality and that
there is no meaning and no goal-directed activity existing in
reality; often science assumes, as well, that free will, value and
spiritual meaning are all false and unscientific concepts. Under
these assumptions, Darwinism is the only explanation for the
evolution of the finches in the Galapagos, and in an unscientific
and totally unproven generalization, these finches are taken as
the example that has to be followed by everything in this world,
including humanity. Darwinists declare this as a scientifically
proven truth for all evolution in this world. This quick step
from the Galapagos finches to humanity and eventually to God
is neither scientific, nor logical, or rational and certainly has a
motivation that is outside of the consideration of these
scientists, but must be strong enough to let them overlook their
irrationality.

On the other hand, these questions need to be answered
before a scientific deduction can be made or any scientific
hypothesis can be presented to the experiment. Usually, these
questions are assumed, are accepted as common sense, and
rarely are they questioned. So why are religious assumptions
questioned, if common sense assumptions are accepted without
questions? At least in religious assumptions we have an author

and have a documented history, common sense assumptions are
taken for granted without that knowledge, but the whole system
of science is based on them and only philosophers are interested
in this issue.

If a Bahá’í scholar is confronted with this issue, he first must
solve it for himself. When these issues come up in a discussion
with other scientists, the basic issue needs to be discussed. It is
unfortunately common, that most academics would not be
ready for such a discussion and would refuse to accept anything
that does not fit their preferred ideology. Then this ideology
needs to be discussed first, and this becomes tedious. So for all
practical purposes, these issues cannot be discussed in most
academic circles.

Consequently, the Bahá’í scholar must avoid, if possible, to
enter a discussion that would be a useless argument and he/she
has to approach these issue in other ways. One way would be to
follow the scientific practice of not questioning assumptions
and presenting them as common sense and true. In this case, the
scholar would not bring quotes from religious sources but
present the truth in his argument that is obvious to him.
Another way would be to quote honestly the source, but not get
into the issue of its scientific quality, only answer if these
assumptions are questioned.

On the other hand, it would not be honest if the religious
affiliation of the scholar is dissimulated. So it might be stated
somewhere that the scholar is of a certain faith and has a special
relationship to these sources and when he presents them he
needs to do it in a way that does not elicit contradiction. This is
not easy, but certainly possible, and it fits the Bahá’í conviction
of avoiding arguments and disunity. In any case, when
confronted, he would have to answer, and then a discussion
should take place. If the rejection of his assumption is never
voiced and if he is blacklisted because of it, there is not much
he can do, because usually this happens in secrecy and cannot be
challenged. It should be different following the academic

66                                             Lights of Irfán vol. 15

tradition that these issues need to be open for discussion and
not secretly pursued, but alas, this is the academic world we live
in today.

The words of Jesus (Matthew 10:16) come to mind when
considering the Bahá’í scholar in a modern academic setting.

> Behold, I send you forth as sheep in the midst of wolves:
> be ye therefore wise as serpents, and harmless as doves.

How to deal with distraction

Bahá’u’lláh has not overlooked this issue. In the next
paragraph He makes an interesting observation, He talks about
the fact that everybody is looking for truth, everybody is like
the biblical patriarch Jacob looking for his lost son Joseph, who
was sold to Egypt. He states that all created things are
searching. Being created, means having to search and find.

> In this journey the seeker reacheth a stage wherein he
> seeth all created things wandering distracted in search of
> the Friend. How many a Jacob will he see, hunting after
> his Joseph; he will behold many a lover, hasting to seek
> the Beloved, he will witness a world of desiring ones
> searching after the One Desired. (SVFV 5)

Freud, in his Three Essays on Sexuality, discusses what he has
found in analytic praxis, i.e., “The finding of an object is in
fact a re-finding of it.”12 Talking about psychology, Freud does
not have to go further and he explains this sentence by
explaining that what we had in early childhood, in our
relationship with mother, is what we look for later in life, so
that the finding of a relationship is really a re-finding of this
original relation. The need to search and to find is explained
that way, but explaining a later experience by an earlier might
be psychologically interesting, yet, the question remains about

the origin of this need to search and to find. What is it that
everybody is looking for, is searching for? In what way is
finding it the fulfillment of his life? Recently the same question
was stated in a more profound way.

> Everyone worships reality. Each person looks about him,
> listens a moment — listens as long as life will let him
> pause to listen — and then he falls down and worships
> whatever it is that looks like this is what it is all about.13

This is what — according Bahá’u’lláh — the seeker and a fortiori
the scholar will observe, all of creation is distracted in this
search, but the search is in all of them. Everyone is searching
reality for truth; for this final answer, even if somebody might
find that the final answer is in the understanding that there is no
truth at all, he still is searching for that and whole philosophical
theories have been built on this. Unfortunately, many look in
the wrong direction for answers, distracted they follow their
vain imagination, they develop ideologies and answers, that are
not truthful and lead astray, but the searching is there, even
when the finding is in error, when it is distorted by tradition or
based on assumptions that are wrong.

Bahá’u’lláh gives us the answer in a metaphor: it is search for
the Ka‘bih, the goal for the Muslim pilgrim in Mecca, it is the
final search for spiritual fulfillment, and He indicates that it
needs the aid from this Invisible Realm, basically the help from
the Creator.

Bahíyyih Nakhjavání raises an interesting issue when thinking
about questions, especially final questions.

> We naively perceive questions as ‘doubt’ and answers as
> ‘certitude’ and assume, rather glibly, that just by being
> Bahá’ís we have all the longed for answers to the
> imponderable questions of or age. We forget that it is
> the Revelation of Bahá’u’lláh that has unleashed these
> questions upon us over the last century and a half. It is

> actually His principles — of the relativity of truth and
> the progressive nature of spiritual evolution — that have
> caused such revolutions in men’s thinking and set into
> motion such questions in the minds of scientists and
> housewives alike.14

The alert scholar can easily follow these thoughts and find in
the different ideologies that are today propagated and espoused,
a distraction from the truth and it is additionally interesting to
find which of the Bahá’í principle has caused the question and,
unfortunately, the wrong answer that becomes a distraction for
the seeker and scholar.

For example, could it not be that the concept of
deconstruction, so popular in postmodern philosophy, is a
failed attempt to deal with the fact that truth in the Bahá’í faith
is called relative in the sense of being progressively renewed in
every Revelation, so that this concept must be confronted with
the idea of a progressive theology and philosophy, which is
reaching for the truth, but is not ever reaching absolute truths?
Naturally, when this possibility is considered, the causes for the
need to deconstruct are changing. It has nothing to do with
post-colonialism or the power imposed by a Western
constructive narrative. While all these going explanations may
have some aspect of truth, they really hide what is going on, i.e.,
the progressive change in understanding reality, which is the real
event that is usually not seen by all the wise men of post
modernism.

The English philosopher Bertrand Russell15 has called
Communism and Nazism a religion. Shoghi Effendi, following
Bahá’u’lláh (ESW 46), calls them a “religious irreligion.”16 One
could say that they are substitute religions, substituting an
imaginary reality for what is real and final in this world. The
fact that even 70 years of this “religion” in Russia did not work
and that communism did not do better in any other country
where it was tried, even in East Germany, should convince the
followers of this ideology. Yet, the fact that it is accepted as a

pseudo-religion can explain that it still finds many followers,
especially in the Western “intelligentsia,” who accept this
secularized religion in order to avoid any true religion.

Bahá’u’lláh gives us to think when he continues to talk what
the seeker finds.

> At every moment he findeth a weighty matter, in every
> hour he becometh aware of a mystery; for he hath taken
> his heart away from both worlds, and set out for the
> Ka‘bih17 of the Beloved. At every step, aid from the
> Invisible Realm will attend him and the heat of his search
> will grow. (SVFV 5)

Bahá’u’lláh indicates something important here. When the
seeker or the scholar sees the distractions that are presented
today, he could find important issues and become aware of a
mystery, as long as he has taken his heart away from both
worlds. What could be the meaning of “both worlds?” The
interpretation I would like to follow is to assume that these two
worlds are, the world of the “seen” and the world of the
“unseen”, the world of the manifest and the world of the
hidden, or as it is stated in the Valley of Unity:

> And thus firstness and lastness, outwardness and
> inwardness are, in the sense referred to, true of thyself,
> that in these four states conferred upon thee thou
> shouldst comprehend the four divine states, and that the
> nightingale of thine heart on all the branches of the
> rosetree of existence, whether visible or concealed,
> should cry out: “He is the first and the last, the Seen and
> the Hidden...” (SVFV 27)

These two worlds of outwardness and inwardness are both
called “true of thyself” and are specifically described by
Bahá’u’lláh, when he explained them:

70                                              Lights of Irfán vol. 15

In thine outward appearance thou tellest of the
> appearance of power in the realms of divine creation; in
> thine inward being thou revealest the hidden mysteries
> which are the divine trust deposited within thee. (SVFV 26)

It is clearly indicated that the outwardness is the physical,
bodily aspect of the human person and that the inwardness
presents the spiritual and inner aspect of man. The first is
related to the physical creation, the other is called a hidden
mystery deposited by God into men.

What is interesting here when this explanation is accepted, is
the fact that Bahá’u’lláh requires that the seeker take his heart
away from both worlds, in other words, the seeker must be
detached from both, from false attachment to his body and his
physical existence as well as from his mind, and his spiritual
“vain imaginations”, which can equally be leading him astray,
causing heedlessness and carelessness and looking into the
wrong sources in the search for meaning in life and for finding
the truth.

This is a clear distinction to the Christian tradition, where
the spiritual was the solution and the material was the way
leading to destruction. Where the world of nature was
condemned but the world of “super-nature” was the goal. The
Bahá’í understanding does not divide the world into nature as
the realm of the devil and super-nature as the realm of God.
There is the devil in both, to continue the metaphor, and both
can be a source of finding God, or can be a source of wrong
attachment leading away from God. This is expressed as well in
the statement of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá:

> Briefly, all effort and exertion put forth by man from the
> fullness of his heart is worship, if it is prompted by the
> highest motives and the will to do service to humanity.
> This is worship: to serve mankind and to minister to the
> needs of the people. Service is prayer. (PT 176)

For the Bahá’í scholar and seeker, the world is no longer
divided into the natural and the super-natural. The world has
become one again and the direction the seeker needs to take is
using both, the physical and spiritual, both the body and the
mind to elevate himself on the Path of God, in search of the
Ka‘bih18 of the Beloved.

In doing so there is another aspect mentioned by Bahá’u’lláh.

The seeker as well as the scholar, one might say, is promised that
“At every step, aid from the Invisible Realm will attend him and
the heat of his search will grow.” This promise is the Divine
assurance that for the true seeker finding will eventually
happen, as long as his heart is pure and as long as he is not
directing his search towards vain imitations of culture and
tradition and as long as he avoids heedlessness in his intellectual
and physical life.

Bahá’u’lláh promises the seeker that “At every moment he
findeth a weighty matter, in every hour he becometh aware of a
mystery.” The question can be raised what are those weighty
matters and those mysteries, if not the ultimate reality, the final
goal and the truth of this world? To stay in the picture as
presented by Bahá’u’lláh, in the verse before, the seeker

> will behold many a lover, hasting to seek the Beloved, he
> will witness a world of desiring ones searching after the
> One Desired.

Bahá’u’lláh in the following verses continues to describe the
search of the seeker and He presents us with an interesting
comparison, the standard of Majnún.

The standard of Majnún,19 “seek her everywhere”

What is the standard of Majnún is the question here.

The first consideration is following what was said above
about both aspects of reality. To find the spiritual lover by
sifting dust does not make sense in common understanding, yet,
it indicates the unity of reality, the unity of the inward and
outward aspect, of the manifest and the hidden. This could be a
reminder to all seekers and scholars to not neglect the physical
reality, and to take this world seriously without false
attachment to it. Only in the unity between the spiritual and
material can the seeker find the “beloved.”

> Yea, although to the wise it be shameful to seek the Lord
> of Lords in the dust, yet this betokeneth intense ardor in
> searching. “Whoso seeketh out a thing with zeal shall

Here the ardor of searching is held against conventional
wisdom, which would find it shameful to search in the material
world for the spiritual, in the dust for the beloved. The question
might be asked what is meant by sifting dust and seeking the
Lord in the dust. Without doubt, at least in the English
translation it is an allusion to the word of Genesis 2:7:

> And the LORD God formed man of the dust of the
> ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life;
> and man became a living soul.

Here it is stated that man was created from the dust of this
world and that the spirit or breath was then given to him to
make him a living soul.

The exclusivity of search and sacrificing everything for it

In the next two concluding paragraphs the main themes of
this Valley of Search are repeated and summarized, yet, this is
done in a very special way. These two paragraphs seem to
contradict each other. This contradiction or opposition must be
understood as a message that can only be expressed by stating
polar opposites describing reality in two polar, yet
complementary statements. This is not a unique example in the
Writings of Bahá’u’lláh, who frequently makes such statements,
for example, when talking about an end that has not end or
describing God as the most hidden and the most manifest.

In the first paragraph, it is described how the seeker in his
hunt for the Beloved One has to sacrifice everything, which
seems to describe a person who leaves this world, like a hermit
or monk, not only leaving the physical world but also the world
of intellect and science by giving up everything he knows in
order to reach the realm of the spirit.

In opposition to that, in the next paragraph, it is described that
the seeker must not only go into every land and region, but also
join every company and fellowship in order to find the secret of
the Friend and the beauty of the Loved One. This reminds us of
Majnún who seeks the spiritual Laylí in the dust of this world
and who was described as an example of intensive search.

What does this arrangement tell us about the search described
in this valley? It seems that in order to search and to find, a
balance must be found between these two spiritual movements,
a movement that is at the same time moving away from the
world and into the world. First the movement away from this
world and its temptation will be described.

Excursion on Vain Imagination / Idle Fancy

In the following section the attempt is made to correlate
statements of the Bahá’í Writings with the concept of the seven
deadly sins or the eight vices from the Christian tradition. This
concept is linked to the works of the 4th century monk Evagrius
Ponticus, who listed eight evil thoughts. The description of
these eight vices as presented below, is taken mainly from the
paper of Karl Wucherer:21 Maskierte Depression und Trägheit in
der klassischen Achtlasterlehre (Masked Depression and
Heedlessness in the Classical Doctrine of the Eight Vices),
where the history of these teachings is explored and extensively
analyzed according to modern psychological findings of
“Daseinsanalyse” a special form of existential analysis developed
in Austria.

Vain imagination and idle fancy are a recurring theme of the
Bahá’í Writings and can be found in the Writings of the Báb,
Bahá’u’lláh, as well as in the interpretation of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá and
Shoghi Effendi. This section will explore the meaning of these
concepts and will attempt to correlate them with insights
developed in the Christian tradition, especially as it was
developed into the Eight Vices or Seven Capital Sins.

In these two statements of Bahá’u’lláh, the use of these two
concepts is made first in explaining how His enemies are trying
to hide him using vain imaginations and idle fancies.

> For now, however, they have hidden Me behind a veil of
> darkness, whose fabric they have woven with the hands
> of idle fancy and vain imagination. (SLH 135)

Yet, the faithful is blessed to have been able to utterly abolish
these dangerous attitudes, vices or idols of the self in his life
with the help of God.

> Blessed art thou for having utterly abolished the idol of
> self and of vain imagination, and for having rent asunder

> the veil of idle fancy, through the power of the might of
> thy Lord, the Supreme Protector, the Almighty, the one
> Beloved. (GWB 291)

In the Valley of Knowledge, the wayfarer will be able to shut
the doors to vain imaginations through the fear of God.

> Come out of doubt into certitude, and turn from the
> darkness of illusion to the guiding light of the fear of
> God. His inner eyes will open and he will privily
> converse with his Beloved; he will set ajar the gate of
> truth and piety, and shut the doors of vain imaginings.

(SVFV 10)

In the Kitáb-i-ˆqán, Bahá’u’lláh describes another valley, the
valley of arrogance and pride which is entered by petty-minded
souls who follow the leaders of their faith and are lost in idles
fancy.

> Consequently, such behavior can be attributed to naught
> save the petty-mindedness of such souls as tread the
> valley of arrogance and pride, are lost in the wilds of
> remoteness, walk in the ways of their idle fancy, and
> follow the dictates of the leaders of their faith. (KI 14)

Previously, under the precondition of search, it was
mentioned that cleansing the heart means to turn away from
imitation, which is following the traces of their forefathers and
sires.

> It is incumbent on these servants that they cleanse the
> heart — which is the wellspring of divine treasures —
> from every marking, and that they turn away from
> imitation, which is following the traces of their
> forefathers and sires, and shut the door of friendliness
> and enmity upon all the people of the earth. (SVFV)
76                                              Lights of Irfán vol. 15

It appears from these statements above that the phrase idle
fancy and vain imagination is both connected with ideologies
that remain in the tradition of a culture and with the refusal to
accept the new vision of a Manifestation. In the traditional
doctrine of vices in Christian ethical tradition both of these
statements, the idle fancy and vain imagination might be
correlated to the first two vices of pride and vainglory. The
eight vices are organized towards their location in the human
body as described below.

Doctrine of the Eight Vices

This doctrine is presented here in a shortened form taken
from the paper by Wucherer and every vice is correlated with
statements from the Bahá’í Writings and a comment. They are
headed by the respected faculty used or better abused during
their execution.

Rational Faculty: Mind

1\. Pride Ὑπερηφανία (hyperēphania) — Hubris

2\. Vainglory Κενοδοξία (kenodoxia) — Boasting

> Idle Fancy and Vain Imagination
> Know, moreover, that should one who hath attained
> unto these stations and embarked upon these journeys
> fall prey to pride and vainglory, he would at that very
> moment come to naught and return to the first step
> without realizing it. (GDM 65)

Like in the doctrine of the Eight Vices, the danger to
succumb to these two vices is greatest for those who have
successfully overcome all the other lower vices, and the
statement of Bahá’u’lláh expresses this warning most clearly.
Even a person who has reached the status of an academician or

scholar and has habitually overcome the lower forms of vices is
not protected by his or her seemingly virtuous and moral life
from these basic intellectual and spiritual vices. Therefore, it is
important to have this possibility of pride and vainglory in
front of our mind in all scholarly and academic efforts and to
preserve a cautious attitude with humility and forbearance in all
scholarly and personal enterprises. This was clearly stated by the
Universal House of Justice as mentioned above in the
introduction where it was stated:

> Inevitably believers will commit errors as they strive to
> rise to this degree of maturity, and this calls for
> forbearance and humility on the part of all concerned,
> so that such matters do not cause disunity or discord
> among the friends.22

Emotional Faculty: Heart

3\. Heedlessness/Distraction Ἀκηδία (akēdia) — Lethargy, Carelessness

> Thus did they wander in the paths of delusion and the
> ways of heedlessness, and return to their abode in that
> fire which feedeth on their own souls. These, verily, are
> numbered with the infidels whose names have been
> inscribed by the Pen of God in His holy Book. Nor have
> they ever found, or will ever find, a friend or helper.

(GDM 31)

Bahá’u’lláh makes here a very interesting remark, contending
that persons given to heedlessness or carelessness will never find
a friend. Clearly, friendship and love is based on an attitude of
care and concern for others; a careless person will be a lonely
person who has to fill his life with the other basic vices to find
distraction and pleasure.

78                                               Lights of Irfán vol. 15

4\. Anger Ὀργή (orgē) — Wrath, Anger

> Most of the people are bewildered in their drunkenness
> and wear on their faces the evidences of anger. (PB 100)

Another interesting remark of Bahá’u’lláh here is the fact
that anger is first shown in their faces, because it originates in
the heart or in the emotional section, then becomes visible in
the body, especially in the face, and only later becomes known
intellectually to the angry person. Hence, we have the
observation that outsiders can recognize that somebody gets
angry, even when the angry person denies these feelings. When
anger shows in the face the mind will then exaggerate this anger
by self-talk and develop the anger into rage, unless the person
manages and controls his anger properly.

5\. Depression Λύπη (lypē) — Sorrow, Grief or Envy as Sadness at
another’s good fortune

> I have, however, contented Myself with that which was
> mentioned, lest thou become wearied in thy journey or
> feel inclined to turn back, or lest thou be overtaken by
> sadness and sorrow and overcome with despondency,
> trouble and fatigue. (GDM 11-12)

This is the emotional aspects of a failed life where
carelessness, anger and depression prevent the heart to be open
to his fellowman and finally to the Revelation of God,
especially when the self has not developed its potential and
failed his purpose.

Instinctual Faculty: Abdomen or Gut

6\. Money Addiction Φιλαργυρία (philargyria) — avarice, greed

> Why, then, exhibit such greed in amassing the treasures
> of the earth, when your days are numbered and your

> chance is well-nigh lost? Will ye not, then, O heedless
> ones, shake off your slumber? (GWB 127)

7\. Sexual Addiction Πορνεία (porneia) — prostitution, fornication,
lust

> He should cleanse his heart from all evil passions and
> corrupt desires, for the fear of God is the weapon that
> can render him victorious, the primary instrument
> whereby he can achieve his purpose. (GWB 272)

8\. Food Addiction Γαστριµαργία (gastrimargia) — gluttony

> Is it on your food and your drink that ye pride
> yourselves, on the riches ye lay up in your treasuries, on
> the diversity and the cost of the ornaments with which
> ye deck yourselves? (PB 10)

It is rather remarkable to observe how failing in these lower
regions of life is causing the higher capacities to fail as well,
which was observed already before in the doctrine of the eight
Vices in early Christianity, and which seems to be still true as
described in psychology and ethics. A more advanced study of
Bahá’í Ethic, which cannot be provided in this paper, could shed
further light at this correlation and might help to develop this
doctrine in the future. We are now returning back to the Seven
Valleys after this excursion.

> quest and the lover hath no desire save union with his
> beloved. Nor shall the seeker reach his goal unless he

> God. Labor is needed, if we are to seek Him; ardor is
> needed, if we are to drink of the honey of reunion with
> Him; and if we taste of this cup, we shall cast away the
> world. (SVFV 6)

In order to reach the union with his beloved, the wayfarer has
to set aside and sacrifices everything he has seen, heard and
understood. In other words, he has to be free from all
prejudices, even those that come with his culture and tradition,
especially the traditions that came from any previous religion.
Additionally, he has to be free from any philosophical
prejudice, any ideology no matter how prevalent and pervasive
it is or how strongly it is presented in academia today.

Without this freedom from tradition, from what “is known”,
from “what one has learned” and even from what is the accepted
way of understanding and doing research, the wayfarer and
scholar will not be able to find the beloved and come to reach
the goal of unification, or, as it is said here, he would not enter
the realm of the spirit, which is the City of God.

The realm of the spirit was explained by Bahá’u’lláh as the
place from where the Manifestation come with their message to
mankind.

> The door of the knowledge of the Ancient of Days being
> thus closed in the face of all beings, the Source of
> infinite grace, according to His saying, “His grace hath
> transcended all things; My grace hath encompassed them
> all,” hath caused those luminous Gems of Holiness to
> appear out of the realm of the spirit, in the noble form
> of the human temple, and be made manifest unto all
> men, that they may impart unto the world the mysteries
> of the unchangeable Being, and tell of the subtleties of
> His imperishable Essence. (GWB )

The door of knowledge of God is closed to humanity unless
and until it is opened by the Manifestation who comes from this

realm of the spirit as a human being and manifests unto all men
the mysteries of God. He is described as the unchangeable Being
and an imperishable Essence.

Giving up all knowledge in order to reach this realm of the
spirit how is it possible for the seeker and especially the scholar,
to function and what criteria can she use to promote her
studies?

The question raised here is, “By what standard is a scholar to
measure his research and studies, and how should she use the
prevailing standard and methods, which are promoted today in
academia?” How does she have to take the warning presented by
Bahá’u’lláh when He stated:

> Weigh not the Book of God with such standards and
> sciences as are current amongst you, for the Book itself
> is the unerring Balance established amongst men. (ESW
> 128)

One could assume that this warning is only useful in the
science of theology and in interpreting religion, and that
modern science being secular has its own standards and does not
fall under this warning. While this could be true in some cases,
where there is no interrelation between a particular science and
religion, for most scientific enterprises it is not that simple,
especially when we talk about basic scientific assumptions and
premises, especially in the humanistic sciences like psychology,
sociology, history and philosophy, which cannot be clearly
separated in their standards and methods, because of the way
these sciences are developed today. This precludes any opening
towards the possibility of religion and leads directly towards
atheism or agnosticism and their basic assumptions which are
never discussed and which frequently exclude anything related
to God or Religion.

The modern world, especially in its so-called post-modern
development, is described by Bahá’u’lláh as being sick, as

82                                             Lights of Irfán vol. 15

languishing on its bed of sickness, sore-tried and disillusioned.
Academia and schools of higher learning can be seen as the
proponent of this malady, which has been described in the
following quote.

> We can well perceive how the whole human race is
> encompassed with great, with incalculable afflictions.
> We see it languishing on its bed of sickness, sore-tried
> and disillusioned. They that are intoxicated by self-
> conceit have interposed themselves between it and the
> Divine and infallible Physician. Witness how they have
> entangled all men, themselves included, in the mesh of
> their devices. They can neither discover the cause of the
> disease, nor have they any knowledge of the remedy.
> They have conceived the straight to be crooked, and
> have imagined their friend an enemy. (GWB 213)

Bahá’u’lláh clearly states in this passage that the reason for
this world-wide affliction is the fact that their leaders are
intoxicated by self-conceit and have interposed themselves
between it and the Divine and infallible Physician. In other
words, the leaders of today’s humanity have replaced the
religions of the past with new ideologies that can be described
as substitute religions or irreligions. Since they neither know the
cause of the problem nor the remedy for it, they promise
solutions but do not deliver; in fact, what they deliver is worse
than the problem they pretend to solve.

Whenever such an ideology was imposed with terror in any
country from Germany, Russia and China to Cuba, the first
result was a poorly functioning economy and in some cases like
in the Ukraine and in China mass starvation. Even 70 years of
Communism and Marxism in Russia, did not change this
situation and all the terror of the regime did not improve the lot
of the people. This is contrary to the hopes of Marx, who had
predicted that a revolution based on his economic theory
presented in the Communist Manifesto and developed in his
book “the Capital” would change the fate of the workers

permanently and forever to a paradise-like state of final
perfection.

Part of Germany, East-Germany, was occupied by Russia and
placed under the same ideological rule, the once prosperous
country became poor, while West-Germany regained its previous
prosperity. This clearly demonstrates the inability and falseness
of these ideologies; nevertheless, they are still pursued under
different names today. Surprisingly, the same basic ideology is
still active today and promoted by so-called “Progressives,”
becoming a substitute religion in the Western world.

The question is how does this consideration apply to the
seeking Bahá’í scholar? Bahá’u’lláh requests that the seeker
sacrifices all things. That is, whatever he hath seen, and heard,
and understood, all must he set at naught … Does that not mean
that all ideologies, all false philosophies of modern thinking,
even all accepted scientific ideologies in academia, need to be
critically investigated by the Bahá’í scholar and seen from the
Vision of the Revelation of Bahá’u’lláh? Obviously, a
familiarity with this Vision is the condition sine qua non for
such a process to be started.

The Universal House of Justice, in a letter written on
December 10, 1992, reminds us of the statements written on
behalf of Shoghi Effendi:

His secretary wrote, on another occasion, that:

> Shoghi Effendi has for years urged the Bahá’ís (who
> asked his advice, and in general also) to study history,
> economics, sociology, etc., in order to be au courant
> with all the progressive movements and thoughts being
> put forth today, and so that they could correlate these to
> the Bahá’í teachings. What he wants the Bahá’ís to do is
> to study more, not to study less. The more general
> knowledge, scientific and otherwise, they possess, the
84                                              Lights of Irfán vol. 15

> better. Likewise he is constantly urging them to really
> study the Bahá’í teachings more deeply.

This quote is followed up by further emphasizing that the
Revelation of Bahá’u’lláh is the standard of truth for every
believer.

> In the simultaneous endeavor to pursue their studies and
> to delve deeply into the Bahá’í Teachings, believers are
> enjoined to maintain a keen awareness that the
> Revelation of Bahá’u’lláh is the standard of truth against
> which all other views and conclusions are to be
> measured.

This statement is followed up with a word from Bahá’u’lláh
expressed in the Book of Certitude:

> The heart must needs therefore be cleansed from the idle
> sayings of men, and sanctified from every earthly
> affection, so that it may discover the hidden meaning of
> divine inspiration, and become the treasury of the
> mysteries of divine knowledge... (KI 69)

The seeker, being a wayfarer in the Valley of Search, being an
unstudied Bahá’í or a scholarly educated Bahá’í has to

… sacrifice all things. That is, whatever he hath seen, and
> heard, and understood, all must he set at naught, that he
> may enter the realm of the spirit…

This is not an easy task and requires a life-long effort and
dedication. Actually, it is not a one time achievement, but a
process that has to be always kept in mind as a guiding principle
of all searching and studying. Only when this process is guiding
the scholar he can precede to the other complementary side of
his search, which is described in the next sentence of this tablet.

Beholding the beauty of the Loved One

> On this journey the traveler abideth in every land and
> dwelleth in every region. In every face, he seeketh the
> beauty of the Friend; in every country he looketh for the
> Beloved. He joineth every company, and seeketh
> fellowship with every soul, that haply in some mind he
> may uncover the secret of the Friend, or in some face he
> may behold the beauty of the Loved One. (SVFV 7)

As described in the previous sentence, the seeker has to sacrifice
everything and give all what he knows and what he has learned
about this world, and in this following sentence it seems the
opposite is recommended: the traveler in this journey is to live
in every land and region and seek friendship with every soul. It
needs to be noted that both of these movements are supposed
to happen at the same time and they are not opposite but
complementary. In other words the more the seeker gives up his
previous knowledge, the better he can listen to the mind of
others he meets and the more likely he can find the secret and
beauty of the Bahá’í Revelation in the other.

In this movement away from what he knows and remembers
about people and the world, he can better listen and find out
about the truth that is in this world and can see the other as
manifesting the sign of the creator, can see in him/her the
beauty of the Loved One.

Now he can freely join every land, every country and can
study every theory or ideology and is able to see and distinguish
what is true and what is false. Having the standard of the Most
Sublime Vision of Bahá’u’lláh and being established in the
Covenant, he or she can benefit from many different ideas,
correlate them with the revealed truth and find new
understanding and new relationships in the thinking of today’s
scholars, they have a touchstone to sort out what is true and
lasting and what is only temporary and passing.

In the previous section, where the wayfarer was encouraged
to give up everything, even everything he knows, the traditional
list of vices was mentioned. Especially the vices related to what
are called in the Writings vain imagination and idle fancy. Here
the virtues need to be mentioned which alone make it possible
to follow the advice of Bahá’u’lláh to live in every land and join
every company. There was developed in Christianity a list of
virtues opposed by a list of vices by Felix Just, S.J., Ph.D.23

Christian morality is not only based foundationally on the
Ten Commandments (see Exod 20 & Deut 5), but also focuses
traditionally on what are called the seven “Capital Sins” or
“Deadly Sins,” often pairing and contrasting these with seven
“Principal Virtues” which is presented below.

Virtue and Vice Lists

pride     avarice    envy         wrath
Capital

arrogance greed      jealousy     anger
Deadly Sins:       superbia avaritia    invidia      ira

humility generosity kindness patience
Principal Virtues: modesty charity       gratitude compassion

humilitas liberalitas humanitas patientia

lust       gluttony       sloth
Capital

impurity   voracity       laziness
Deadly Sins:         luxuria    gula           acedia

chastity   temperance     diligence
Principal Virtues:   purity     moderation     fervor

castitas   temperantia    industria

It is not difficult to find Bahá’í Scriptures supporting this list,
but this would be the task of a Bahá’í Ethic, which cannot be
attempted in the frame of this paper.

Conclusion

The picture above is based on this statement of Bahá’u’lláh:

> Consider the rational faculty with which God hath
> endowed the essence of man.

> Examine thine own self, and behold how thy motion and
> stillness, thy will and purpose ... all proceed from, and
> owe their existence to, this same faculty. (GWB 163)

The self, the human psyche has, according to the Revelation
of Bahá’u’lláh, four aspects, which are opposite to each other
and yet connected and even existing through each other. So we
have the Stillness on the one side where the detachment and
acceptance is located and where the wayfarer “sacrifices all
things.” This is explained by Bahá’u’lláh that he must give up,
“whatever he hath seen, and heard, and understood, all must he
set at naught, that he may enter the realm of the spirit, which is
the City of God”. (SVFV 6) The realm of the spirit is this area of
the self where the stillness of the spirit is located and where

88                                             Lights of Irfán vol. 15

Detachment and Acceptance are predominant. This must be
balanced and harmonized with the other side, the side of
Movement, where the wayfarer is outgoing, and where he
“joineth every company, and seeketh fellowship with every soul,
that haply in some mind he may uncover the secret of the
Friend, or in some face he may behold the beauty of the Loved
One.” (SVFV 7)

These two sides of the self are complementary and it is the
art of living to find the right balance between these two sides so
that one supports the other. Any one-sided approach will
become extreme and distorts the self. The other complementary
polarity between Will and Purpose is showing the balance
between the individual and social aspect of the self, so that the
social and general purpose needs to regulate the individual will,
in order that the action of the person becomes meaningful. This
structure of the self is called tetrarchic, which concept has been
developed by this writer in several papers in the Lights of ‘Irfán
publications during the last 10 years, especially in book 12,
2010 under the title “The Essence of Man, Towards a Bahá’í
Understanding of Human Nature and Psychology.”24

In the beginning of this paper the question was raised how
the “unfettered search after truth” can be combined with
“absolute loyalty to the Manifestation of God.” Not only in the
finding of scholars, but also in their methodology any answer to
this question presupposes that reality is seen as it is seen in the
Bahá’í Revelation. Any other viewpoint will come in conflict
with the absolute loyalty to the Manifestation. Therefore, any
reductionistic, materialistic or positivistic understanding of
science, especially of the humanistic sciences, will lead the
scholar astray and bring him/her in conflict with the Bahá’í
Revelation. Any viewpoint that excludes anything spiritual
from science and restricts science to the Newtonian mechanistic
understanding of reality or to Descartes dualistic understanding
of the world does not fit in the standard of the Bahá’í
Revelation. There is no balance or harmony possible between
the Bahá’í Revelation and some of the modern scientific

assumption about reality; there is balance only in reality
between complementary aspects of life like described above. It
is important to have this distinction in mind whenever the
scholar is confronted by this question between unfettered
search after truth and loyalty to the Manifestation of God.

Not only the Bahá’í scholar but every Bahá’í, be he/she
learned or not, needs to live in this balance of the self between
stillness and Movement, or the spiritual and material aspect of
life and of the world, as well as between Will and Purpose and
the individual intentionality regulated by the collective human
goal of life. The only way to find this balance is to accept the
Revelation of Bahá’u’lláh as the standard of truth, not only in
theology, but also in the basic understanding of the world, in
philosophy and psychology, in the methodology and
philosophical assumptions that are fundamental to any science,
especially of the humanistic sciences. This was expressed in a
letter written on behalf of Shoghi Effendi which will close these
considerations:

His secretary wrote, on another occasion, that:

> Shoghi Effendi has for years urged the Bahá’ís (who
> asked his advice, and in general also) to study history,
> economics, sociology, etc., in order to be au courant
