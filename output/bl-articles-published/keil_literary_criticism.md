Textual Context and Literary Criticism:
A Case Study based on a Letter from Shoghi

Effendi1

Gerald Keil

Written replies by Shoghi Effendi, along with those written
on his behalf, include seminal statements of doctrine on a wide
range of topics, statements which are considered binding for
the Bahá’í community. It is currently the case that the vast
majority of such letters are generally accessible only in the form
of text compilations (in particular, Lights of Guidance2 and
Directives from the Guardian3), which do not include the
enquiries to which these letters constitute the responses. In
addition, the letters are generally presented not in their
entirety, but only in the form of selected extracts, these
moreover sub-divided into the smallest possible fragments and
re-ordered thematically. The fact that the ensuing well-nigh
complete dissociation of such fragments from their original
textual contexts represents an exorbitant loss of information,
a loss which can substantially influence the interpretation of
individual text passages, will be demonstrated in detail on the
basis of a particularly severe example which came to the fore
during the present writer’s research activities.

***
The text passage with which this presentation is primarily
concerned is a single sentence from a letter written on behalf of
Shoghi Effendi4 on 15 May 1940:

> As to which spot should be regarded as the standard,
> this is a matter which the Universal House of Justice
> will have to decide.5
56                                      Lights of ‘Irfán Book Eleven

It is not my intention here to explore the properties or the
practical application of the “spot [that] should be regarded as
the standard” as such — I have written about that extensively
elsewhere. 6 My sole purpose is to explore whether this text
passage represents an unambiguous confirmation of the
indispensability of such a spot for the determination of the
day of Naw-Rúz as stipulated by Bahá’u’lláh, as is generally
assumed, or whether it could also be understood in some other
way. I have occupied myself intensively with this question on
two occasions separated by a gap of several years.

It must also be clarified from the very beginning that this
presentation will not concern itself with the veracity, i.e. the
objective accuracy, of any individual interpretation. That is a
judgement to which I am in any event not entitled. My interest
lies solely in the bandwidth of potential meaning — how this
statement might possibly be understood. This approach is
known as literary criticism (“literary” in the broad sense of
“anything written”). In this presentation, this term implies the
systematic analysis of the written word as a preliminary stage
of the process of exegesis7 and — to achieve clarity from the
very start — has nothing to do with criticism in the popular
sense of complaint or faultfinding. As a theological-scientific
activity this discipline is known in the West primarily through
Judeo-Christian scholarship (Talmudic commentary and Bible
criticism), but there is nothing preventing Bahá’í scholarship
from profiting from the rich experience of other traditions for
the study of its own writings — in the present case, Shoghi
Effendi’s correspondence. This suggestion is not new,8 but the
discussion in Bahá’í academic literature has until now more or
less concentrated on the methodology of — and problems
associated with — historical criticism of the writings of the
central figures of the Bahá’í Faith. 9

While endeavouring in principle to maintain neutrality with
respect to the question of veracity, I will most certainly
address the question of the degree to which one or another
reading of a text passage is appropriate to the available textual
context in each individual circumstance. Such reflection
constitutes an inalienable aspect of literary criticism; without
it, analysis would be devoid of any appeal to reality, and any
exegesis which was based on such an analysis would be purely

Textual Context and Literary Criticism                          57

arbitrary. Nevertheless, it must be stressed that the assessment
of the appropriateness of a given reading has nothing to do
directly with the question of its truth value, merely with its
hermeneutic feasibility within a given textual context.

This assessment necessarily involves critically examining the
reading under consideration for anomalies which it may imply
— and naming them by name. This candid use of language may
irritate some readers not accustomed to the methodology of
literary criticism, who could easily misinterpret this approach
as criticism of the guidance offered by the Guardian. It is
therefore important to stress that it is expressly not the
purpose of analysis to make inferences regarding the meaning
intended by its author, but rather to assess the potential
signification projected onto a text by the reader. Anomalies
invariably signal that something is wrong with the assumptions
underlying the reading, and they ideally indicate directions of
investigation which might resolve these anomalies, as was for
example the case in the study described in this presentation.

If the only information available to the critical reader is that
which comes from the text itself, then his judgement of the
appropriateness of a given reading will be based solely on text-
internal consistency. But there is virtually no such thing as a
text for which there is no external reference. At most,
mathematic expressions or statements of a propositional
calculus might perhaps be considered self-inclusive, but even
these make reference, at least implicitly, to the rules and
conventions by which they are governed and which are therefore
not understandable to anyone not acquainted with these rules.
In the case of texts in natural language, not only are the rules
and conventions of the metasystem involved — natural
language — incomparably more complicated, so too are the
relationships between individual texts and their linguistic and
factual environment multifarious, and not always easy to
identify. That is the reason why Christian exegetes, for
example, in the wake of nearly two thousand years of
preoccupation with scripture are still able to uncover novel
and unexpected facets of biblical narrative using the methods
of literary criticism.10

58                                      Lights of ‘Irfán Book Eleven

It is admittedly extremely difficult to quantify the
appropriateness of a given reading. But despite all subjectivity
necessarily involved in any such assessment, it is nevertheless
possible to subject the text to a set of individual questions and
in so doing to proceed in a structured manner, so that the
critical reader need not base his conclusions solely on holistic
and purely intuitive judgement. In the case of the corpus with
which this presentation is concerned — Shoghi Effendi’s
correspondence, which consists to a large part in letters
written in response to written enquiries from individuals or
from Spiritual Assemblies — the appropriateness of specific
readings can be investigated by subjecting them to questions
such as the following:
o Inner cohesion: Are the individual components of this

> reading thematically, stylistically and objectively
> consistent among themselves?
o Outer cohesion: Do the assertions implied by this

> reading stand in concord with comparable assertions
> from other written sources?11
o External cohesion: Does this reading accord with

system-external standards (experience and reason12)?
o Relevance: Does this reading address the main purpose

> of the question which preceded it, so far as that
> purpose can be ascertained?
o Commensurability: Does this reading leave the

> impression that it answers the question(s) actually
> asked?
o Completeness: Does this reading cover all of the issues

> which were broached by the question which preceded
> it?
o Motivation: Is each of the individual elements of this

> reading prompted in some manner by the preceding
> enquiry — especially with regard to the details (which
> is, as we know, where the devil lies)?
o Terminological parallelism: Are terms which occur

both in this reading and in the preceding question
Textual Context and Literary Criticism                           59

> used in the same fashion, or if not, are terminological
> differences explicitly topicalised?
o Symmetry: Does the answer reflect the character of the

> preceding question? (a statement of general principle
> as answer to the description of a special-case
> problem, an explanation of administrative procedure
> in response to a question about ethics, a theological
> exposition where the questioner is uncertain about
> correct demeanour, are examples of tendentially
> inappropriate readings.)
o Language and knowledge level: Do the demands

> implied by this reading correspond to the level of
> perceptivity to be reasonably expected from the
> enquirer? (a child should not be bombarded with an
> “adult” answer; and a technically correct answer
> which is understandable only to the specialist is only
> then called for when the necessary background
> knowledge and terminological competence can be
> assumed on the part of the enquirer.)
This list, which is undoubtedly incomplete and capable of
improvement, serves in the first instance to concentrate the
focus on individual aspects of the text under examination. No
single aspect can be totally divorced from the others, and every
such text survey involves certain limitations. For example, lack
of inner cohesion of a reply might well be conditioned by the
haphazard structure of the original enquiry; a given reply might
be the sole existing statement in all of the writings to the theme
under discussion, so that either the possibility of comparison
with additional materials is not viable or the material which is
consulted for comparison leads to false associations or
conclusions; and the store of knowledge drawn from a broader,
predominantly secularly disposed culture is often insufficient
or even inappropriate as background for assessment of the
plausibility of a given statement from a Bahá’í point of view.
But the analysis of the communicative context suffers most
frequently from the incompleteness of the available
documentation: since in most cases only Shoghi Effendi’s
remarks are available, assumptions concerning the nature of
each respective preceding enquiry must be drawn on the basis

60                                      Lights of ‘Irfán Book Eleven

of the statement which has been formulated in response to it —
which means that application of the majority of the above
criteria would involve circular reasoning. And even when it is
available, the preceding enquiry represents a text which should
itself ideally be subjected to the scrutiny of literary criticism.

In the case of the particular text with which this
presentation is concerned (which as so far presented consists
of a single sentence), the potential for text-internal analysis is
correspondingly limited and the dependence on additional
sources of information all the greater. In the course of this
presentation the communicative context of this sentence will
grow step by step, and with each step the potential for
interpretation will expand, contract, become more specific —
and even contradict itself.

Once again: this presentation is not a discussion about the
“spot to be regarded as the standard”. This subject is merely the
vehicle for transporting the central thesis: that the effectivity
and reliability of exegesis is dependent on a textual context
which is as exhaustive as circumstances permit.

The first attempt

In the course of a study of the Badí‘ calendar which was
published in 2005,13 I investigated the future calendar ruling for
determining the day of Naw-Rúz, i.e. the day which carries the
nominal specification 1 Bahá’. This ruling was established
originally by the Báb in the Persian Bayán and subsequently
confirmed and rendered more precise by Bahá’u’lláh in the
Kitáb-i Aqdas. The Báb writes:

> va án yawm ast keh shams montaqel mígardad az borj-e
> ˙úb be˙amal dar ˙ín-e ta˙víl cheh leyl váqi‘ shavad va
> cheh nahár.14
> This day is the day whereon the Sun passes from Pisces
> into Aries at the moment of its passing, whether it be
> night or day. 15

Bahá’u’lláh’s statement differs in principle from that of the
Báb only in the fact that Bahá’u’lláh explicitly mentions sunset:

Textual Context and Literary Criticism                        61

> har rúz keh shams ta˙víl be˙amal shavad hamán yawm
> ‘eid ast agar cheh yek daqíqeh beh ghorúb mándeh
> báshad. 16
> The festival of Naw-Rúz falleth on the day that the sun
> entereth the sign of Aries, even should this occur no
> longer than one minute before sunset.17

Despite differences in wording, both statements express the
same content, since the term “day” in the sense of “calendar
day” is understood to be the period of time between two
successive sunsets: this moment serves not only the Badí‘
calendar, but also for example the Islamic (hijrí) calendar as
delineator between two calendar days.

It certainly didn’t escape the notice of the early believers
that the procedure for determining New Year’s Day was very
similar to the corresponding procedure in connexion with the
Iranian National Calendar. Also called the Jalálí calendar or
simply “the solar calendar” (taqvím-e shamsí, to distinguish it
from the (Islamic) lunar calendar, taqvím-e qamarí), this
calendar has served since the twelfth Gregorian century as
house calendar in virtually all of Iran, in Afghanistan, in the
Shi‘ite regions of Iraq and in several adjoining regions of
Central Asia. It is thus easy to appreciate how Bahá’u’lláh’s
instructions would be understood by the early believers to
imply an adaption of the ruling to which they were already
accustomed, whereby the new ruling would differ from the old
in only one aspect: in the Iranian National Calendar,
determination of New Year’s Day is made on the basis of
midday,18 whereas in the Badí‘ calendar it is made on the basis
of sunset, the terms “midday” and “sunset” each denoting a
characteristic orientation of the sun as observed from some
agreed-upon geographical location. In the as yet unpublished
second part of his narrative, in which he presumably reflects
the views of the community of his time, Nabíl Zarandí (Nabíl-i
A‘zam) obviously shares this impression:

> ... yawm-e nawrúz hamán rúz ast keh beh qá‘ede-ye
> taqvím-e írán dar shab yá rúz án rúz shams beh borj-e
> ˙amal várd shavad agar che yek daqíqe qabl az ghorúb-e
> áftáb báshad bar khaláf-e qá‘ede-ye sábeq-e ahl-e írán
62                                        Lights of ‘Irfán Book Eleven

> keh agar ta˙víl ba‘ad az zohr váqe‘ mishad rúz-e ba‘ad-
> ra nawrúz qorár mídádand ...19
> On the basis of the Iranian calendar, the day of Naw-
> Rúz is the day on which the sun enters the sign of Aries,
> whether at night or during the day, even if this happens
> one minute prior to sunset, in contrast to the earlier
> ruling in Iran, according to which one chose the
> following day as Naw-Rúz if the shift [i.e. the transit
> of the sun into the sign of Aries: my comment] should
> occur after midday ... [my translation]
The similarities of Nabíl’s description with the texts of both
Bahá’u’lláh and the Báb indicate that he was acquainted with,
and based his own text on, both versions. Admittedly, the
parallels in the English-language texts are partly the result of the
fact that the above translation has been undertaken with a view
to maintaining stylistic conformity with the existing official
translations of similar texts. Nevertheless, even in the Persian-
language originals the similarity in content can hardly be
overlooked.

All that remains of this passage, if one removes those parts
of it which are directly derived from the statements of the Báb
and Bahá’u’lláh, is the reference to the Jalálí calendar:

> On the basis of the Iranian calendar ... [Badí‘ ruling] ...
> in contrast to the earlier ruling in Iran, according to
> which one chose the following day as Naw-Rúz if the
> shift should occur after midday.
Nabíl asserts that the ruling of the Iranian National Calendar
serves as the basis (qá‘ede) for the corresponding Badí‘ ruling.
That might imply nothing more than that Nabíl felt the new
ruling easiest to explain on the model of the old ruling, with
which he could assume his readership was acquainted. But these
words could also possibly imply that, according to the
testimony of Nabíl, the Báb and Bahá’u’lláh intentionally
adapted the existing Jalálí ruling to serve as the new Badí‘
ruling. This possibility is of course pure speculation, since a
confirmation on the part of the Báb or Bahá’u’lláh doesn’t
appear to exist in writing. Moreover, the assumption that a
direct relationship between the two calendar forms was

Textual Context and Literary Criticism                        63

historically unavoidable would be tantamount to claiming that
a Manifestation of God is a child of his times, dependent on
models from his immediate social and cultural environment.
But even without support from this speculation, it is easy to
appreciate how the undeniable similarity of the two New Year
rulings would indeed foster the conclusion that they are meant
to be equivalent in all details except for that one aspect which
the Báb explicitly altered.

It is perhaps precisely such considerations which resulted in
the assumption that, prior to activation, Bahá’u’lláh’s ruling
would have to be supplemented with the nomination of a
particular spot on Earth which would serve as the reference for
the determination of Naw-Rúz. After all, this expectation was
in accord with the experience of the early believers with respect
to no less than two of the other calendars with which they were
intimately familiar: not only is the determination the day of the
equinox and therewith the Jalálí New Year accomplished with
reference to a particular geographical location, the precise spot
on Earth of the sighting of the new moon also plays a decisive
rôle in the Islamic calendar both for the determination of 1
Mu˙arram (the nominal start of the Islamic year) and for the
commencement and duration of the month of fasting.

Once it had become engrained community-wide — a state of
affairs which was without doubt consummated very early in
the history of the Faith — this assumption would quickly
assume the character of a tacit agreement. From that time
onward, the only detail which would still remain open to
speculation would be the location to be selected. Given the
already existing possibilities in Iran and Iraq, and subsequent
to the interment of Bahá’u’lláh’s earthly remains in Bahjí, the
erection of the Schrine of the Báb on Mount Carmel and the
establishment of the Bahá’í World Centre in Haifa, discussion
would have focussed to such a degree on the multitude of
possibilities available that the original assumption which
generated the demand for this supply of candidates in the first
place would hardly have been subjected to further scrutiny. The
community would only have to remain patient until an
authoritative decision in favour of one or another of the
potential reference spots had been taken.

Meanwhile, the proliferation of the teachings with respect to
the spot took its inevitable course: from Iran and the Near
East, the teaching spread over the entire globe and was
inculcated among peoples who had no knowledge of the Iranian
National Calendar and therefore no possible insight into the
history of the consensus opinion of which they were being
informed, an opinion which perforce mutated for them into an
apodictic truth.

***
It was no real hardship for the community to postpone the
final decision indefinitely, since by virtue of the provisional
coordination of the determination of the day of Naw-Rúz with
the properties of existing mainstream calendars, the
community possessed a practicable interim solution. It
therefore comes as no particular surprise to note that, up until
the appearance of the letter of 15 May 1940 written on behalf of
Shoghi Effendi to the National Spiritual Assembly of the
United States and Canada, nearly seventy years after the Kitáb-
i Aqdas was revealed, the spot appears to have received not a
single mention — neither in the writings and letters of
Bahá’u’lláh nor in those of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá or Shoghi Effendi. In
spite of that, in the letter of 15 May 1940 Shoghi Effendi could
rest assured that the members of the National Spiritual
Assembly were acquainted with the concept of the “spot”.

Over and above the fact that it is to be “regarded as the
standard” (a condition of which the Spiritual Assembly was no
doubt already aware), in this letter there is no further
elucidation regarding the “spot”. Not that it was in any way a
pressing issue: every Bahá’í, then as now, knew all too well how
important “the spot to be regarded as the standard” was — even
though it might not at all be clear to him just what function
this spot is supposed to fulfil. Calendar details feature among
the favourite topics of conversation among those interested in
hearing about the Faith. The Badí‘ calendar always goes down
well; it serves admirably as an easily recognisable group-
defining feature of the community for individuals who are not
really able to cope yet with the more spiritual aspects of the
Bahá’í Religion. Moreover, the pleasing symmetry of the
nineteen nineteen-day months and the flexibility of the

intercalary days in achieving parity with the solar year are
immediately obvious to those who, if truth be told, could never
really appreciate why, in their “own” calendar, the extra day in
a leap year should be attached seemingly arbitrarily onto the
end of the curiously undersized month of February. The Badí‘
calendar sports one blemish, however: the cycle of the year is
determined (in the West) according to the dictates of the
Gregorian calendar. Were it not for the pending nomination of
a spot, this situation would be an embarrassing admission of
dependency on the very time calibration system which the Badí‘
calendar is meant to replace. As it is, however, the Gregorian
calendar serves the purposes of the Badí‘ calendar, not the other
way around: as soon as we Bahá’ís decide for ourselves and on
our own terms that the time is ripe, this interim measure will be
cast aside.

Since the expectations placed in the future nomination of a
spot play such an important rôle in the maintenance of a
positive public image of the community, and since the firm
belief in the necessity of the spot has such a long history, one
which reaches right back to the earliest phases of the Bábí
Revelation, it is hardly surprising that the mere mention of the
spot on the part of Shoghi Effendi would be automatically,
indeed gratefully taken up as confirmation of a conviction
which in any case predominated in the community. For
example, the editors of the Kitáb-i Aqdas conclude, apparently
on the strength of that one sentence quoted at the beginning of
this presentation, the following:

> The Guardian has stated that the implementation,
> worldwide, of the law concerning the timing of Naw-
> Ruz will require the choice of a particular spot on earth
> which will serve as the standard for the fixing of the
> time of the spring equinox. He also indicated that the
> choice of this spot has been left to the decision of the
> Universal House of Justice. 20

Although an editorial commentary in no way carries the same
import as the divine revealed word, by virtue of its occurrence
in the official release of the holiest work of the Bahá’í
Revelation this commentary takes on a certain normative
authority. It can be quoted, cited in evidence, and with

reference to the supervisory function of the Universal House of
Justice even adorned with the aura of inerrancy. In this
fashion, what started out as an uncritical assumption and
became in stages a consensus opinion, a tacit agreement and an
apodictic truth, ultimately takes on the quality of
authoritative doctrine.

It is not my purpose, neither here nor anywhere else, to
question the potential correctness of this reading of the
sentence from Shoghi Effendi’s letter of 15 May 1940. In
particular, the concern of the current presentation is literary
criticism, not exegesis; in other words, it is about the total
meaning potential inherent in any given text, and not about
what that text is ultimately supposed to mean. My intention is
to describe the stages of my investigation of this statement of
Shoghi Effendi’s in its own right, divorced from the question
of assessment of truth — a process which involves among other
things ignoring whatever interpretation has heretofore been
assigned to it, however self-evident this advance judgement
might appear.21

***
The conduct of this investigation was not devoid of ulterior
motives. In the course of my aforementioned study of the Badí‘
calendar, I wanted to present a technically feasible alternative
to the reference-spot method and to discuss the respective
advantages of the two methods. In face of the predominance
and more recently the implied doctrinal authority of the
consensus opinion, I felt it necessary to provide myself with
insurance against the potential reproach that I had ignored the
clear instructions of Shoghi Effendi. In the end, I didn’t have
to look very far for my immediate purposes: it was enough to
point out that Shoghi Effendi had characterised the spot as a
“matter”. Had he instead said something like “the Universal
House of Justice will decide on a suitable location for the
spot”, then the situation would have been clear: it would indeed
have been merely a question of nomination. But in light of the
word “matter”, this passage can legitimately be taken to imply
in the first instance a decision concerning the issue of the spot,
and only thereafter, if appropriate, its location.

This interpretation is admittedly anything but cogent, since
the word “matter” can just as easily be interpreted as a place-
holder for the entire phrase “which spot should be regarded as
the standard”, i.e. devoid of independent lexical meaning.
Therefore, in support of my further objective — the
stimulation of a serious discussion about alternative methods
for the future determination of New Year — something more
tangible than that which the isolated sentence produced would
have served my purposes quite nicely.

The next step consisted of considering this sentence in the
context of the complete paragraph of the letter of 15 May 1940
in which it occurs. This paragraph reads as follows:

> Regarding Naw-Ruz: if the vernal equinox falls on the
> 21st of March before sunset it is celebrated on that
> day. If at any time after sunset, Naw-Ruz will then, as
> stated by Bahá’u’lláh, fall on the 22nd. As to which
> spot should be regarded as the standard, this is a
> matter which the Universal House of Justice will have
> to decide. The American National Spiritual Assembly
> need not therefore take any action in this matter at
> present.

This passage is the response to a written enquiry by the then
National Spiritual Assembly of the United States and Canada
directed to Shoghi Effendi, a copy of which I had tried in vain
to obtain while preparing the manuscript for publication in
German. It is most probably the case that I am personally
responsible for this failure. Having already made liberal use of
the services of the Research Department of the Bahá’í World
Centre in the course of my researches, I decided to direct my
enquiry to the secretariat of the National Spiritual Assembly in
Wilmette — the successor organisation to that which authored
the original letter — and thus avoid stretching the patience of
the World Centre even further. Presumably due to limitations
in the services available to researchers, my enquiry did not
produce the result I was banking on. Eventually, preparations
for publication of the study reached such an advanced stage
that a substantial alteration to the text would no longer be
possible, and this project lost momentum. For clues regarding
the content of this unseen enquiry I thus had no other option

than to rely on inferences drawn from the formulation of
Shoghi Effendi’s response.

***
The three-part structure of this passage is obvious at first
glance. The first portion is in effect a reformulation of the law
presented in the Kitáb-i Aqdas:

> Regarding Naw-Ruz: if the vernal equinox falls on the
> 21st of March before sunset it is celebrated on that
> day. If at any time after sunset, Naw-Ruz will then, as
> stated by Bahá’u’lláh, fall on the 22nd.

The second portion is the reference to the “spot”, discussed
above:

> As to which spot should be regarded as the standard,
> this is a matter which the Universal House of Justice
> will have to decide.
Finally, the third portion is a sort of guideline:

> The American National Spiritual Assembly need not
> therefore take any action in this matter at present.
This structure implies a corresponding multi-part enquiry:
o How is Naw-Rúz to be determined? — perhaps

> expressed in the form: Under what circumstances
> should Naw-Rúz deviate from 21 March? — followed
> possibly by:
o When, or under what conditions, will a decision be

> made about the spot? — and perhaps concluding with
> the question:
o What measures should the National Spiritual

> Assembly of the United States and Canada undertake
> in anticipation of such a decision?

The above speculation can be varied indefinitely, but Shoghi
Effendi’s response appears in any case to consist of two pieces
of information and one suggestion for action. In light of the
portion of the reconstructed enquiry with which it is
associated, though, this concluding suggestion is somewhat

puzzling: one would normally take it as a matter of course that
the National Spiritual Assembly would abide by any
instruction currently in force until such time as it is explicitly
superceded by another. It is therefore plausible to imagine that
the instruction to refrain from taking action is simply a
formulaic closing remark. Perhaps the Spiritual Assembly
didn’t even pose the question whether it should take any action
or not — or if so, then perhaps it was merely meant rhetorically,
just as the answer it prompted sounds rhetorical. It would
appear that the editors of Lights of Guidance came to a similar
conclusion, since in their version the final sentence was
omitted.

In anticipation of this closing instruction, the second part
(concerning the spot) seems to function primarily as a
rationalisation for the postponement of this decision until
some indefinite point of time in the future. Thus understood,
and in the event that the Spiritual Assembly didn’t itself broach
the issue, it provides a conceivable motivation for the fact that
the spot is mentioned at all in the response, even though
nothing in addition is revealed about the function or
particulars of the spot itself.

With regard to the first part, it is difficult to imagine just
why Bahá’u’lláh’s New Year ruling is presented in the manner in
which it occurs here. It is hardly surprising to find a reference
to the Gregorian calendar in a letter addressed to Bahá’ís in the
West, but it is indeed somewhat curious that only one of many
inevitable scenarios has been singled out for mention. As a
consequence of the Gregorian leap year formula, the vernal
equinox can occur in fact on 19, 20, 21 or 22 March, depending
on the year and the nominal location on Earth. The moment of
the vernal equinox — the so-called vernal point, or point of
Aries — is presented in the standard reference works exact to
the minute in UT (Universal Time, for the present purposes
synonymous with Greenwich Mean Time). This time
specification applies by definition to the null meridian, or in
other words, it indicates the time at longitude zero, which runs
through the middle of Greenwich, a suburb of London. Should
the point of Aries occur in a given year at, say, 17:45 UT (5:45
p.m. GMT), then at this moment the sun has already set in
Middle Europe but not for example in Ireland, Spain, Portugal

and a large proportion of France. The further away from the
null meridian a given location lies, the greater is the probability
that a day shift must be reckoned with, i.e. either a Gregorian
date change (based on midnight) or a Badí‘ one (based on
sunset), or both. Shoghi Effendi provides no details concerning
how this potentially complicated day shift effects the
determination of New Year in all these situations, nor does he
mention the special conditions which obtain in the polar
regions. All in all, this excerpt from the letter of 1940 leaves one
somewhat ill at ease: as methodology for the future application
of the revealed New Year ruling it is virtually useless.

Had these two sentences been addressed to an individual
(and non-Persian) believer who, purely out of personal interest
or curiosity, wanted to know something about the future
determination of New Year, then the explanation for this
apparent carelessness would be clear: in all probability the
poser of the question would have been acquainted his whole life
long with no other calendar than the Gregorian, perhaps not
even aware that it has a name. His choice of words might well
have left the impression that he was not particularly versed in
matters of astronomy, and an all too abstract or technical
answer might have been too much for him to handle. In short,
there are understandable grounds for assuming that, in his
answer to such an enquiry, Shoghi Effendi would have made
reference to 21 March in this fashion — as if the matter really
were that simple, and as if Gregorian date specification were
an absolute scale against which other, in this case Badí‘, time
expressions are to be measured. And since in any case the
application of the law did not lie in the domain of
responsibility of this individual, there would be no necessity
for providing a lengthy and involved explanation which, while
encompassing all conceivable circumstances, would probably
include far more that the enquirer really wished to know.

But Shoghi Effendi is not writing here to an individual, but
rather to a National Spiritual Assembly, indeed to that of the
largest Bahá’í community at that time outside of Iran. For this
reason alone one ought to be justified in assuming that Shoghi
Effendi’s remarks are being directed to a technically proficient
readership, and that they are not intended simply to satisfy
someone’s casual curiosity, but rather to serve as instructions

which are to be put into practice at some future time (as the
words “at present” suggest). In light of the words “The
American National Spiritual Assembly need not therefore take
any action in this matter” it could be argued, albeit somewhat
strained, that this passage doesn’t have to do with instructions
for action, but at best with instructions for inaction. Yet this
objection would have been more convincing if Shoghi Effendi
had dispensed entirely with a description of the ruling: silence
would then have been preferable to disinformation. And
finally, it can be seen that the level of communication is quite
simply inappropriate: neither do these sentences pay justice to
the level of knowledge which may rightly be assumed on the part
of a National Spiritual Assembly together with the consultative
resources at its disposal, nor does this reading reflect the care
and preciseness characteristic of Shoghi Effendi.

A possible explanation for these apparent shortcomings is
provided by the existence of an article which bears the title
“Additional Material gleaned from Nabíl’s Narrative (Vol. II),
Regarding the Bahá’í Calendar”. This article appeared in every
volume of The Bahá’í World from vol. III (1928 — 1930) until
vol. XX (1986 — 1992). The close collaboration of the Guardian
on this article is documented in writing, and it is in fact highly
probable that Shoghi Effendi was its author.22 An excerpt from
this article explains:

> The day of Naw-Rúz falls on the 21st of March only if
> the vernal Equinox precedes the setting of the sun on
> that day. Should the vernal Equinox take place after
> sunset, Naw-Rúz will have to be celebrated on the
> following day.

This excerpt is based on the passage from Nabíl’s narrative
quoted earlier. A comparison of both renditions quickly reveals
that the excerpt is far from a translation; it is in fact a
complete new formulation. This situation is in itself a
convincing indicator of Shoghi Effendi’s participation — no
other individual would have undertaken such a liberal
reformulation of a passage from a work which had been
compiled at the behest of Bahá’u’lláh himself — and
demonstrates to what lengths Shoghi Effendi went to target his
intended readership. The choice of words in The Bahá’í World

is, as it is formulated in a letter from the Bahá’í World Centre,
not a translation, but rather “a partial paraphrase that
highlights the essential information or principle gleaned from
the Persian text in order to clarify the Bahá’í Naw-Rúz for
Persian and non-Persian Bahá’ís and for non-Bahá’í readers of
The Bahá’í World”. 23 The language used and the degree of prior
knowledge assumed is appropriate to the range of readership
for which the passage was written.

The parallels between these two sentences and the first two
sentences of the passage from the letter of 1940 are surely not
pure coincidence. Whilst putting together material for letters
to be sent on his behalf, Shoghi Effendi’s secretaries would
routinely access archives of correspondence and other written
sources in search of appropriate text passages which the
Guardian had already written or approved. It is therefore
plausible that this excerpt from the article in The Bahá’í World,
which had been written some ten years earlier, served directly or
indirectly as a template for the corresponding passage of the
letter of 1940. Apparently, a secretary adopted this already
available text with a minimum of re-wording in order to spare
Shoghi Effendi from unnecessary expense of his limited
resources of time and energy. However, it still remains a
mystery, in light of the difference between the expected degree
of perceptibility of the members of a National Spiritual
Assembly and that of a non-Bahá’í readership, why Shoghi
Effendi let these sentences go through as they did.

The only formulation which has been added to the text from
The Bahá’í World is the insertion “as stated by Bahá’u’lláh”.
However, Nabíl explains in his narrative that he gleaned this
information from the Kitáb-i-Asmá’, which was revealed by the
Báb. In other words, this insertion seems misleading. Perhaps
Shoghi Effendi simply wanted to make it clear that Bahá’u’lláh
had confirmed this ruling. In light of the impracticability of
the rest of the formulation, however, it is hard to imagine why
Shoghi Effendi felt the need at all to include this additional
remark.

For the purpose of literary critical analysis it has so far been
possible to expand the context to include four text passages
which preceded the letter of 1940:
o the New Year ruling of the Báb from the Persian

Bayán;
o the New Year ruling of Bahá’u’lláh from the Kitáb-i

Aqdas;
> o the statement from part II of Nabíl’s Narrative; and
o the article from The Bahá’í World volumes II - XX

(1928-1992).

This extended field of information has led in certain respects
to an improvement of our understanding of the passage in the
letter of 1940: the relationship between the passage and the
divine law has become clearer, the provenience of the consensus
opinion regarding the spot has been identified, and the source
text for the problematic first two sentences has been
discovered. Nevertheless, one cannot deem this passage from
Shoghi Effendi’s letter of April 1940 to be a paragon of clear
and unambiguous communication — at least not in accordance
with the impression left by the greatly expanded but still
incomplete communicative context. The suspicion has grown
that the problems presented by this text cannot be
satisfactorily resolved without examination of the original
enquiry.

The Second attempt

In preparation for the English-language edition of my study
a few years later, I obtained a copy of the original letter of the
National Spiritual Assembly of the United States and Canada
from the Research Department of the Bahá’í World Centre. It
was explained to me that the letter of 1940 consisted not just of
this one question, but rather contained “a large number of
questions about different aspects of the Bahá’í Faith and the
operation of its Administrative Order.”24 This information
alone made the situation more transparent: in the face of a
considerable number of individual questions, and in view of
the pressure of time which bore constantly on the Guardian, it

is not unreasonable to assume that Shoghi Effendi might rely
on the preparatory researches of his secretary and dispense with
an extensive revision of each and every passage of a letter of
this size written on his behalf — in particular, those individual
responses which were either of diminished importance or which
did not entail any immediate consequences. Obviously, these
conditions applied at least partially to the question regarding
the New Year ruling, the inappropriateness of whose
presentation is therefore at least understandable: it was
necessary under those combined circumstances to leave the
sentences which had been virtually lifted from The Bahá’í World
as they were.
The reference to “a large number of questions” motivated me
to look for answers to other questions in this letter. An Ocean
search in Lights of Guidance for text passages which had been
written on behalf of Shoghi Effendi to the National Spiritual
Assembly of the United States and Canada on 15 May 1940
resulted in four hits in total: not exactly a “large number”
(from which we may surmise that only a small selection of items
from this letter is included in this compilation), but
nevertheless sufficient to gain an impression of the bandwidth
of topics for which answers were being sought.25 Of course it is
only an assumption that all four extracts come from the same
letter; but if they do not, then that merely means that Shoghi
Effendi answered up to five separate enquiries from the
American National Spiritual Assembly on the same day, of
which at least one included “a large number of questions”. And
so it remains the case in any event that Shoghi Effendi was
burdened with the task of supplying answers to a large number
of questions or alternatively to the same large number plus four
or more, all on the same day and presumably during the same
working session, and it is irrelevant for the purpose of the
discussion to speculate which excerpt was written in reference
to which theoretically existing letter.

Of these four excerpts, three have nothing do with the spot.
They read as follows:

> Regarding the interpretation of mental unfitness, this
> is not the same as being physically incapacitated. By

> the latter is meant a condition much more serious than
> any temperamental deficiency or disinclination to
> conform to the principle of majority rule. Only in rare
> cases when a person is actually unbalanced, and is
> admittedly proved to be so, should the right of
> membership be denied him. The greatest care and
> restraint should be exercised in this matter.26
> Regarding the age of fifteen fixed by Bahá’u’lláh; this
> relates only to purely spiritual functions and
> obligations and is not related to the degree of
> administrative capacity which is a totally different
> thing, and is, for the present, fixed at twenty-one. 27
> In connection with the selection of particular
> photographs of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá for circulation among the
> friends, the Guardian strongly feels that no definite
> ruling should be laid down establishing the superiority
> or distinction of any particular photograph. The
> friends should be left quite free to use their individual
> independent judgement in this matter.28

We will take a closer look at these passages, with the intention
of identifying the degree to which Shoghi Effendi was involved
in their formulation, using criteria which he himself validated:

> Although the secretaries of the Guardian convey his
> thoughts and instructions, … their words are in no
> sense the same as his [and] their style certainly not the
> same, ... for they use their own terms and not his exact
> words in conveying his messages.29

Since we possess a vast corpus of authentic material from
Shoghi Effendi, we are in a good position to analyse these
passages with respect to their degree of conformity with his
writing style. I contend that much in these excerpts falls short
of Shoghi Effendi’s level of language competence, as several
examples will amply demonstrate:

> Regarding the interpretation of mental unfitness, this
> is not the same as being physically incapacitated.

The antecedent of the word “this” can only be “the
interpretation of mental unfitness”. In other words, this
sentence is inadvertently claiming that a certain act of
judgement (interpreting mental unfitness) is not the same thing
as a certain state of existence (being physically incapacitated).
And quite aside from this totally nonsensical observation, the
word “interpretation” is problematic: it should be either (a)
“meaning” or “definition”, (b) “identification” or “prognosis”,
(c) “ramifications” or “consequences”, or (d) “assessment” or
“toleration”, depending on what is actually meant. And that is
not all:

> Only in rare cases when a person is actually
> unbalanced, and is admittedly proved to be so, should
> the right of membership be denied him.

It is the state of being unbalanced, not someone’s admission to
the fact, which is grounds for the denial of membership. There
can be no doubt that Shoghi Effendi could easily have found a
more appropriate term, such as “officially”, “medically”,
“professionally”, “conclusively”, “reliably”, “demonstrably”, to
name only a few.

Incidentally, the expression is “cases where”, not “cases
when” — as Shoghi Effendi well knew: the former occurs for
example in Advent of Divine Justice and World Order of
Bahá’u’lláh, the latter only in letters which were written on his
behalf.

This sentence quite simply doesn’t match up to the habitual
fastidiousness of Shoghi Effendi’s writing style. The Guardian
was only too well aware that the believers hung on every word
from him and that a careless utterance could have disasterous
consequences.

The second excerpt likewise features a rich series of
solecisms:

> ... the degree of administrative capacity [missing
> comma] which is a totally different thing, [superfluous
> comma] and [missing “which”] is, for the present,
> fixed at twenty-one.

Instead of “degree of administrative capacity” it should read
for example “the age at which aptitude for administrative
activity may be assumed”. As it stands, the reader is obliged to
imagine a scale of degrees of “administrative capacity” (which
presumably means capacity for administration) ranging from,
say, 1 to at least twenty-one. According to this statement, the
“fifteen” of this scale does not mean the same thing as “fifteen”
as passage of time since birth. Naturally, when one reads such a
message one mentally carries out the adjustments necessary to
disentangle the botched semantics, a process which is so
automatic that one is usually not even aware that it is taking
place — nor is one generally cognizant of the danger of
misconstruction which it encourages. But at the moment we
are concerned solely with the question of authorship. One will
search in vain for such dubious prose in letters which are
known to have been written personally by Shoghi Effendi.

The missing word “which” results in an ungrammatical
sentence structure: the “is” of “is a totally different thing” is a
copula, whereas the “is” of “is fixed at twenty-one” is a passive
auxiliary. However commonplace it might be among native
English speakers, this error is not characteristic of Shoghi
Effendi. The missing comma transforms a parenthetic relative
clause into a modifying one, thereby distorting the meaning: as
it stands, there must exist at least one additional scale which is
not “a totally different thing”. And finally, the superfluous
comma is an example of punctuation in accordance with
sentence rhythm instead of grammatical function: most likely
an indication that the originator of the sentence — in contrast
to Shoghi Effendi — was not well versed or practiced in the
formal rules of punctuation in English. With regard to the
ungrammatical semicolon, it should be noted that the same
passage in Directives from the Guardian features a colon
instead. It is therefore not possible to ascertain whether the
one version is an error on the part of the editor of the
compilation, or the other version an editorial correction.

The total correctness of the third of these three excerpts
stands in striking contrast to the overabundance of errors in
vocabulary, diction, punctuation and syntax in the first two.
One need not look far for the reason, which is to be found in
the words “the Guardian strongly feels”. In this case it is a

matter which Shoghi Effendi considers to be relatively
important — important enough to take the time, it would seem,
to examine the formulation more carefully and to improve or
re-write the text as necessary.

In consideration of the Guardian’s precise, accurate and
grammatically flawless English writing style, there is enough
text-internal evidence to suggest that, in this letter of reply, we
have to do with varying configurations of authorship: passages
which the secretary had formulated largely autonomously and
which Shoghi Effendi let through despite glaring language
deficiency, alongside a passage which shows clear signs of the
Guardian’s collaboration. The situation with respect to the
fourth excerpt from the letter of 15 May 1940, i.e. the passage
which describes the New Year ruling, remains unclear. It has
already been established that this passage consists partly of
existing material, and this fact suggests the collaboration of
the secretary. To what degree is this passage based on Shoghi
Effendi’s instructions, and to what degree was Shoghi Effendi
actively involved in its composition?

There is a certain amount of text-internal evidence, both
positive and negative, which speaks for an active participation
on the part of Shoghi Effendi. The interpolated remark “as
stated by Bahá’u’lláh” can for example be taken as positive
evidence: since the source of the paragraph in which it occurs
seems to be a paraphrase of a text which is not even from
Bahá’u’lláh (note: this assumption will be reexamined later), it
would have been alone the prerogative of Shoghi Effendi to
decide if these words could be identified with Bahá’u’lláh
himself. Conversely, there is negative evidence which also speaks
for an active intervention on the part of the Guardian: namely,
the absence of solecisms of the sort which were present with
such prolific abandon in the first two of the excerpts examined
above. However, this evidence presents another puzzle: If one
assumes that Shoghi Effendi was involved in the formulation,
then one is forced to ascribe the ultimate responsibility for the
earlier discussed incongruencies in content to the Guardian.
This attitude is problematic — not on account of the
infallibility of the Guardian,30 but simply because such lapses
of communication are totally uncharacteristic of him. There
must be other factors involved to explain why the text took the

form which it took, factors which cannot be discovered or
imagined on the basis of text-internal clues.

Consideration of further excerpts from the letter of 15 May
1940 has led once again to new insights — not only about the
scope of the letter in general, but also specifically with regard
to the passage concerning the New Year regulation and the rôle
Shoghi Effendi possibly played in its creation. Nevertheless,
these new insights also bring with them new problems without
really resolving the old ones. In particular, the extended textual
context does not offer any help in the crucial matter of the
interpretation of the sentence in which the spot is mentioned.
In    addition   to     that    remark     concerning the
comprehensiveness of the letter from the American National
Spiritual Assembly, the Research Department of the Bahá’í
World Centre provided me with a copy of the specific
paragraph to which the passage in the letter of 15 May 1940
regarding the New Year ruling is the response. It reads:

> The ... Chicago Assembly suggests that the NSA
> determine the correct date of Naw-Rúz astronomically
> and notify the believers in advance, to prevent
> confusion. The Egyptian statement declares that Naw-
> Rúz begins when the sun enters the sign of Aries, and
> the reckoning of the beginning of spring is made by the
> astronomical observatories for years in advance. The
> NSA could obtain the information from the Naval
> Observatory each year. However, the question is raised
> whether the determination of Naw-Rúz should come
> from the Bahá’í World Center.

This paragraph came as a complete surprise in every respect. It
is not difficult to recognise that this text is totally unlike
anything which had been possible to reconstruct on the basis of
the textual clues in Shoghi Effendi’s response alone. The text is
in fact not an enquiry at all, but rather a suggestion. Only
incidentally, and right at the very end, a last remaining
question is aired — as if the dispensation of responsibility for
the carrying out of the suggestion were open to discussion, but
not the suggestion itself.

This text makes implicit but nonetheless unmistakable
reference to the Gregorian calendar. Since Naw-Rúz always
coincides with 1 Bahá’,31 the date designation according to the
Badí‘ calendar does not need to be determined. It follows that
the expression “determine the correct date of Naw-Rúz” can,
strictly speaking, only mean the date in some other calendar
system; in the Western world that would be the Gregorian by
default. Even if Shoghi Effendi suspected a slip of tongue — the
enquirer perhaps really meant “day” and not “date” — he
understandably responded to what was actually said.

The “Egyptian statement” mentioned in this suggestion is a
document which had been compiled in the early thirties of the
twentieth century by the National Spiritual Assembly of Egypt
and the Sudan. (The historical — and historic — significance of
this document, which has been described by Shoghi Effendi in
detail, 32 is not directly relevant to the current examination.)
The original document was photographically reproduced in
1936 in The Bahá’í World, 33 followed in 1940 by a Persian-
language translation. 34 This document, which is principally
concerned with Bahá’í marriage and inheritance law, contains
only one paragraph which deals with the calendar in any way
(article 52). It is essentially a paraphrase of the divine law as
explained in the Kitáb-i Aqdas. 35 The Arabic-language original
reads:36

> tanqasimu’s-sannaτu’l-Bahá’íaτ ilá tis‘aτ ’ashr shahran
> khiláfa’l-ayyámi’z-zá’idaτ wa tabtadi’u bi-dukhúli’sh-
> shams fí burji’l-˙amal wa yakúnu ra’isu’s-sannaτ
> huwa’l-yawmu’lladhí ya˙ßulu fíhi dhálika’l-intiqál wa
> lau bi-daqíqaτ wá˙idaτ qabla’l-ghurúb.
> The Bahá’í year is divided into nineteen months, leaving
> aside the days in excess, and it begins with the entry of
> the sun in the sign of Aries, commencing on the day
> during which the transition into Aries takes place, even
> if [this should happen] one minute before sunset. [my
> translation]

The American National Spiritual Assembly was in all
probability in possession of the Persian-language translation,
whose content is accurate, though somewhat awkwardly
formulated:37

> sál behá’í beh núzdah máh taqsím míshavad. be-‘aláve-ye
> ayyám-e zá’edeh va ibtedá-ye an dochúl-e áftáb ast dar
> borj-e ˙amal keh mabdá’e sál gerefteh míshavad. va
> an-rúzíst keh ín inteqál-e áftáb be-borj-e ˙amal ßúrat
> gírad va lú yek dagígeh qabl az ghorúb báshad.
The “Book of Questions and Answers” (ketáb-e su’ál va
javáb) is referred to frequently in the Egyptian statement,
whose authors explicitly characterise this work, which is a
supplementary part of the Most Holy Book, 38 as a primary
source of information. In addition, the “one minute” clause is
clearly based on the nearly identical wording from Bahá’u’lláh
as it occurs in “Questions and Answers”, just as the expression
al-ayyámi’z-zá’idaτ conforms to Bahá’u’lláh’s wording in
Kitáb-i Aqdas verse 16: thus article 52 of the Egyptian
statement demonstrably represents a deliberate paraphrase of
the divine law of the Kitáb-i Aqdas. It is therefore probable
that the insertion “as stated by Bahá’u’lláh” in the first part of
the letter of 1940 refers not to the text in The Bahá’í World
based on Nabíl, but rather to article 52 of the Egyptian
statement. One serious objection carried over from earlier
readings is therewith eliminated.

It should be noted that the National Spiritual Assembly did
not press Shoghi Effendi in any way for an explanation or
statement with regard to the spot: the topic isn’t even hinted
at, neither in the wording of the enquiry itself nor in the
Egyptian statement. This means among other things that the
sentence “As to which spot should be regarded as the standard,
this is a matter which the Universal House of Justice will have
to decide” in no way takes its cue from the preceding enquiry,
but is, as it were, a voluntary disclosure: had Shoghi Effendi
wished to avoid the topic of the spot, he would have been
perfectly at liberty to have done so.

It is thus clear that Shoghi Effendi introduced the theme (i.e.

the “matter of the spot”) for a reason of his own. For those who
are already convinced that the spot is an inalienable component
of the New Year determination and who moreover reject the
efficacy of literary criticism, that reason is clear: Shoghi
Effendi introduced the spot into the discussion simply because
it is part and parcel of the future ruling. “There is no reason

whatever for even the slightest reassessment of the possible
meaning of Shoghi Effendi’s response in light of its newly
expanded textual context”, they will contend, adding: “It is
undoubtedly interesting to know what the American National
Spiritual Assembly was concerned about at that time, but for
the understanding of Shoghi Effendi’s text this knowledge is of
no relevance: utterances of the Guardian conform to their own
rationality, they stand for themselves, in no way dependent on
the broader communicative context, self-sustaining and
sovereign.”

This attitude might well be valid to a degree in certain cases,
such as the lengthier letters from Shoghi Effendi to the Bahá’í
world community. In the present case, however, it ignores
certain inconsistencies which are not so easy to dismiss out of
hand. Of the three parts of Shoghi Effendi’s answer, only the
third appears to have anything directly to do with the enquiry
which preceded it, and even here our euphoria is held in bounds:
one would normally expect that a suggestion, once made,
would either be accepted or rejected; the summons to carry on
as before is otiose. Other than that, the response doesn’t
appear to have any genuine points of contact at all with the
letter from the National Spiritual Assembly. The Spiritual
Assembly demonstrates acquaintance both with the astronomic
circumstances and with the functioning of the ruling as
presented in the Egyptian statement and incidentally also in the
Kitáb-i Aqdas. The first part of Shoghi Effendi’s answer thus
addresses a question which was not asked at all, and indeed in a
manner which presents the situation in a far less satisfactorily
fashion than either the explanation in the Egyptian statement
or the accompanying remarks from the National Spiritual
Assembly. Similarly, the second part of the answer is concerned
with a topic which was not touched upon at all in the enquiry.
And once again, the motivation for this disclosure is not at all
identifiable: a matter which is supposedly so central and
without which the divine law is allegedly incomplete, and about
which the Spiritual Assembly demonstrates no specific
foreknowledge, is mentioned laconically, more or less in
passing.

It is the case right down to the present day that the intended
function of the spot is not unambiguously clear. In the notes

to the English-language edition of the Kitáb-i Aqdas, for
example, it is described as “a particular spot on earth which
will serve as the standard for the fixing of the time of the spring
equinox”, 39 a formulation which suggests that it is to function
as a parameter to a calculation, in apparent agreement with the
underlying assumption of the National Spiritual Assembly in
its letter of 1940. By contrast, in the German-language edition
of the Kitáb-i Aqdas it is presented as “Messpunkt für die
Feststellung der Frühjahrs-Tagundnachtgleiche”, that is, as the
location at which the vernal equinox is to be determined, in a
manner reminiscent of the historical Jalálí practice by which
midday is defined as the moment at which the azimuth of the
sun is 0° (due south) relative to an agreed point of observation.
If this spot is really so indispensable, then Shoghi Effendi
might at least have taken this opportunity to clarify how it was
supposed to work, even if he was at pains to avoid preempting
the nomination of a particular location.
But there is also another way of viewing Shoghi Effendi’s
reaction. One must bear in mind that, by suggesting that New
Year’s Day be determined on the basis of the actual point of
Aries, the American Assembly was effectively requesting the
immediate enactment of the divine law. There were valid
reasons, which I will discuss presently, why this request was
totally unacceptable. Instead of simply blocking the
suggestion, however, the Guardian offered a precise, indeed a
logically watertight explanation why, by all sympathy with the
aspirations of the Spiritual Assembly and in full appreciation
of its good intentions, he was not disposed to take up this
suggestion. The three parts of Shoghi Effendi’s response
correspond namely to the three parts of a classical syllogism.
That is not to say that Shoghi Effendi intentionally formulated
his response in this manner. That may or may not be the case,
but all that is being claimed here is that, in this reading, one
can discern the line of reasoning which forms the basis of the
Guardian’s judgement and subsequently of his answer, and that
this line of reasoning can be best illustrated in the form of a
syllogism, which in its turn can be mapped onto the structure
of the answer.

Syllogisms consist of nothing more or less than normal,
healthy common sense, albeit painstakingly structured. A
syllogism comprises three propositions: two premises (roughly,
“contentions”) and a logical conclusion. The first premise is
typically a general statement and the second a particular one,
but this arrangement is not mandatory. The integrity of the
conclusion is dependent on the validity of the two premises,
which for that reason must be meticulously substantiated. A
premise is then considered substantiated if it is an empirical or
axiomatic statement, or if it is itself the result — the logical
conclusion — of a valid syllogism. A syllogistic argument is
accordingly a potential hierarchy of syllogisms nested within
one another, reaching theoretically so far into the depths of
exposition until nothing remains other than axiomatic or
empirical assertions. Normally, however, the chain of argument
ends at the point at which the justification is acceptable to
every rationally thinking being (thus avoiding not only
unnecessary toil, but also the danger of infinite regress).

In the present case, the three parts of the passage from the
letter of 1940 correspond to the three propositions of the
syllogism: major term, minor term, conclusion. The first
premise (the major term) consists of the paraphrase of the law
as presented in the Kitáb-i Aqdas:

> Regarding Naw-Ruz: if the vernal equinox falls on the
> 21st of March before sunset it is celebrated on that
> day. If at any time after sunset, Naw-Ruz will then, as
> stated by Bahá’u’lláh, fall on the 22nd.

The essence of this statement in terms of the syllogism is the
fact that the occurrence of the day of Naw-Rúz is conditioned
by two temporal events: the moment of the vernal equinox and
the moment of sunset. In other words: these two factors
together determine the definition of the expression “day of
Naw-Rúz”. Whereas the term “vernal equinox” is well-defined,
the meaning of the term “sunset”, in terms of the divine law,
remains unresolved. Reduced to its essentials, therefore, the
premise (major term) reads as follows:

> The enactment of the divine law with regard to the
> determination of the day of Naw-Rúz presupposes an

> unambiguous definition of the term “sunset” with
> respect to the law.

In accordance with this understanding, the statement contains
everything which is necessary to convey the message. It is not in
any way an attempt to inform the Assembly what the Gregorian
equivalent to 1 Bahá’ might be; instead, it is an outline of the
essential criteria for a procedure whose outcome is fully
known, understood and agreed upon in principle by all parties
concerned, with the intention of establishing a launching-point
for the statements which follow. After all, it was hardly
necessary for Shoghi Effendi to provide an elementary lesson in
the features of the law: the text of the preceding suggestion
(along with its extended context) amply demonstrated that the
American National Spiritual Assembly was not in need of
enlightenment in this respect. The example of the day of Naw-
Rúz in connexion with 21 and 22 March served merely to
illustrate the degree to which the determination of Naw-Rúz is
conditioned by the properties of sunset.

In short: if we regard the purpose of this part of the passage
from the letter of 1940 as a premise, and not as dissemination
of information, then our irritation over the Gregorian
reference and over the many undiscussed exceptions simply
vaporises.

From this perspective, the interpolation “as stated by
Bahá’u’lláh” — a clause whose justification has in the meantime
been clarified — serves formally to substantiate the premise.
Since a statement from Bahá’u’lláh automatically counts for
Bahá’ís as axiomatic in terms of syllogistics, it would have been
superfluous to pursue the formal substantiation of the major
term any deeper.

The second premise (the minor term), which will be examined
more closely below, consists of that statement which is of
central concern in this presentation:

> As to which spot should be regarded as the standard,
> this is a matter which the Universal House of Justice
> will have to decide.
The conclusion (signalled by the word “therefore”), which
follows logically from these two premises, reads:

> The American National Spiritual Assembly need not
> therefore take any action in this matter at present.

The words “need not therefore take any action” represent in
this reading a gentle way of insisting that the members of the
National Spiritual Assembly abandon this project altogether,
since it does not lie within the bounds of their administrative
competence. Just how this follows logically from the two
premises will become clear when we take a closer look at the
minor term, i.e. the premise which mentions the spot.

There are two aspects of the second premise which demand
closer scrutiny. The first has to do with the matter at hand:

As to which spot should be regarded as the standard ...

In order to comply with a methodology derived from the
Iranian National Calendar, the term “sunset” would have to
mean “sunset at a specific location on Earth”, a circumstance
which would be thoroughly consistent with the requirement for
the nomination of a particular spot to be regarded as the
standard. As we have seen, the historically conditioned
assumption that the Badí‘ calendar is to follow Jalálí practice
in this respect explains the preoccupation with the spot. But it
so happens that the revealed law could also be interpreted in a
manner which in fact does not require a specific reference
spot 40. This fact in itself renders the concept of “sunset” in
terms of the law ambiguous, over and above the question of its
exact location. In other words, authoritatively establishing
that the resolution of the issue of the spot is directly connected
with the definition of sunset does not imply by extension that
the use of a spot is prescribed. Uncontestable is alone the fact
that, in connexion with the concept of sunset, there is need for
clarification with regard to the spot.

The second aspect has to do with the question of
competence:

> ... this is a matter which the Universal House of Justice
> will have to decide.

In contrast to the major term, Shoghi Effendi does not offer
an explicit substantiation. Nonetheless this premise is well-

founded, a fact which can be amply demonstrated in the form
of a nested syllogism whose propositions are as follows:
major term: All matters which are not expressly recorded

> in scripture must be referred to the Universal
> House of Justice.
minor term: The spot is a matter which is not expressly

recorded in scripture.
conclusion: Any decision with respect to the matter of the

> spot must be taken by the Universal House of
> Justice.
In accordance with this understanding of the text, the
thematic intonation does not fall on the word “decide”, but
instead on the phrase “the Universal House of Justice”:

> As to which spot should be regarded as the standard,
> this is a matter which the Universal House of Justice
> [and no-one else] will have to decide.
The substantiation of the major term of this inner syllogism
is to be found as before in the documented tenets of the Faith
— in this case in the Lesser Covenant, which specifies that
authoritative interpretation of scripture is vested exclusively
in the Guardianship:

> ... it is incumbent upon the Aghsan, the Afnan of the
> Sacred Lote-Tree, the Hands of the Cause of God and
> the loved ones of the Abha Beauty to turn unto Shoghi
> Effendi ... the Guardian of the Cause of God ... He is
> the Interpreter of the Word of God ...41

– whereas every matter which is not expressly mentioned in the
writings is “a matter which the Universal House of Justice will
have to decide”, or as it is explained in ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s Will and
Testament,

> Unto the Most Holy Book every one must turn, and all
> that is not expressly recorded therein must be referred
> to the Universal House of Justice.42

Shoghi Effendi took great pains to maintain this strict
division of domains of competence between the Guardianship
and the House of Justice, and he states unequivocally

> ... that the Guardian of the Faith has been made the
> Interpreter of the Word and that the Universal House
> of Justice has been invested with the function of
> legislating on matters not expressly revealed in the
> teachings. The interpretation of the Guardian,
> functioning within his own sphere, is as authoritative
> and binding as the enactments of the International
> House of Justice, whose exclusive right and prerogative
> is to pronounce upon and deliver the final judgment on
> such laws and ordinances as Bahá’u’lláh has not
> expressly revealed. Neither can, nor will ever, infringe
> upon the sacred and prescribed domain of the other.
> Neither will seek to curtail the specific and undoubted
> authority with which both have been divinely
> invested.43

Had Shoghi Effendi, in his authoritative understanding of
scripture, been of the opinion that the spot was an express part
of the writings — and that would mean that he understood
“Questions and Answers” no. 35 in the same fashion as Nabíl
apparently did — then the matter would clearly lie in his own
area of responsibility. In that case he might still have
postponed a decision indefinitely, perhaps delegating it to one
or another of his successors in office, but expressly not to the
House of Justice. Otherwise — that is, in the event that Shoghi
Effendi were of the opinion that the revealed word is silent
with regard to the spot — then he or any other Guardian of the
Cause of God would be excluded from clarifying this matter,
since he would otherwise “infringe upon the sacred and
prescribed domain” of the Universal House of Justice and
thereby “curtail the specific and undoubted authority” with
which that body had been “divinely invested”. Given this
reading of the text, Shoghi Effendi leaves no room for doubt
that he holds this second opinion. His conclusion is explicit,
unambiguous and compulsory: “This is a matter that the
Universal House of Justice will have to decide.”

There are certainly many examples of interim decisions taken
by Shoghi Effendi in matters over which the writings remain
silent but which, for purely operative reasons, couldn’t wait
until the Universal House of Justice had been established (for
example, the modalities for the election of the initial members
of this body), but only in cases where subsequent alteration by
the House would be practicable. In the case of the spot, a later
revision of an interim decision would have been virtually
impossible, since it would involve the abrogation of an already
consummated calendar reform. For this reason, a possible
interim decision from the Guardian regarding the spot did not
come into consideration.
Everyone must decide for himself whether Shoghi Effendi is
here pursuing a logical line of argument, or whether the above
discourse is baseless and suggestive. From the point of view of
literary criticism, however, it can be observed that, in light of
the deliberations above, this reading of Shoghi Effendi’s
remarks represents in every respect an appropriate response to
the passage from the letter of the American National Spiritual
Assembly:
o Inner cohesion: As carriers of the three propositions

> of an implicit syllogism, the three parts of the answer
> are tightly interrelated both structurally and from the
> point of view of content.
o Outer cohesion: This reading is in accord with the

> writings of the Báb and Bahá’u’lláh, on the condition
> that one abandon the assumption of a direct
> dependence on the properties of the Iranian National
> Calendar. Furthermore, this reading is supported by
> the conditions of the Lesser Covenant.
o External cohesion: No form of discourse fulfils the

> criteria of reason better than the syllogistic
> argumentation which forms the basis of this reading.
> Moreover, the scientifically backed astronomic
> circumstances play a contributing rôle to the extent
> that they are assumed as necessary background. And
> finally, this reading is in conformity with the

> documented, though not ultimately provable, origin
> of the consensus opinion regarding the spot.
o Relevance: The main issue of both the suggestion of

> the National Spiritual Assembly and of Shoghi
> Effendi’s response according to this reading is the
> enactment of the divine law regarding the calendar.
o Commensurability: The suggestion of the National

> Spiritual Assembly ends with a query concerning the
> administrative responsibility for its implementation.

This question is answered.
o Completeness: No request for information,

> clarification or instruction contained in the
> preceding suggestion by the Spiritual Assembly is left
> unanswered.
o Motivation: All aspects of the response according to

> this reading are motivated either by the circumstances
> involved or by the extended textual context, right
down to the finest details of choice of words:

> 1. the repeated mention of sunset;
> 2. the interpolation “as stated by Bahá’u’lláh”;
> 3. the well-considered inclusion of the word “matter”;
4. the indication of compulsion through “will have

to”; and
5. the use of “therefore” to introduce the logical

conclusion.

> In addition, the use of Gregorian calendar dates is

> probably not intentionally) by the preceding
> suggestion, but nevertheless indirectly, as a result of
> the preparatory researches on the part of Shoghi
> Effendi’s secretary, who had adopted a passing
> response from already available materials.
o Terminological parallelism: The terms used, as

> understood in this reading, orient themselves directly
> on the terms used in the preceding suggestion, along

> with those which occur in the Egyptian statement
> which it mentions. As counterbalance to the
> suggestion’s persistent concentration on the equinox,
> the response explicitly makes the sunset its central
> theme.
o Symmetry: By virtue of the fact that both the

> preceding enquiry and the response to it are objective
> examinations of the conditions surrounding the
> enactment of a specific aspect of divine law, the
> response totally reflects the nature of the enquiry.
o Language and knowledge level: This reading assumes

> basic knowledge of the details of the law in the Kitáb-i
> Aqdas and of the astronomic circumstances involved;
> that both assumptions are justified is evident from
> the content of the preceding enquiry. Moreover, in
> must be considered reasonable for Shoghi Effendi to
> assume acquaintance with the stipulations of ‘Abdu’l-
> Bahá’s Testament from the members of a National
> Spiritual Assembly.
Alone the fact that, of all possible readings, this particular
one is the demonstrably most appropriate reaction to the
preceding enquiry from the National Spiritual Assembly does
not mean that it is the objectively correct reading; it merely
means that it best satisfies the criteria of literary criticism. To
what degree this observation is to be taken into consideration
is a decision which must ultimately be taken by that organ
which will one day be responsible for the enactment of the
divine law: the Universal House of Justice.
Let us now return to the ambiguity noted at the very
beginning of this examination, that is, the question whether
Shoghi Effendi is referring to the whole issue of the spot, or
simply to the question of its location. Everything said so far
with regard to this reading of the passage of the 1940 letter
appears to apply equally to both alternatives. However, in light
of what we have in the meantime learned concerning the
extended context of this passage, the question can now be
reformulated: What does “Questions and Answers” no. 35 tell

us about the spot? If we assume (as Nabíl apparently did) that
the Badí‘ New Year ruling differs from the Jalálí ruling only
where expressly stated, then we would have to interpret
Bahá’u’lláh’s silence as endorsement both for the use of a spot
and for its traditional location in Teheran, being presumably
some specific vantage point within the confines of the royal
precinct. At the very most the Universal House of Justice
might be free to select a specific location in the immediate
vicinity to serve as the spot — say, the site of the birthplace or
later residence of Bahá’u’lláh — in order to redefine its
symbolic significance without measurably altering its effect. If
this had been his understanding we would expect that, at some
point in his ministry, Shoghi Effendi would have made this
restriction clear. For example, in his letter of 15 May 1940 he
might quite easily have written

> As to which spot in Teheran should be regarded as the
> standard ...

But instead, the Guardian left the decision of the location (if
that is what his remarks imply) entirely up to the Universal
House of Justice. That would be in conformity with the divine
law only if we understood Bahá’u’lláh’s silence to imply that the
Jalálí spot prototype holds in principle but not in practice.
However, we would then be obliged to identify some text-
related criterion which justifies our making such a distinction:
some criterion, that is, other than the fact that this particular
reading satisfies the expectation which was placed on the text
in the first place. 44 What is more, we would have to ask
ourselves why Shoghi Effendi should deliberately have elected to
generalise the issue by characterising the spot as a “matter”,
thus incurring the risk that this binding interpretation of the
divine ruling might be understood differently — not only by
some individual pursuing literary criticism, but potentially
also by the then future Universal House of Justice.

Again, it is not possible here to conclude which reading is
ultimately correct; that will only become clear after the
Universal House of Justice has issued enactment legislation
with respect to the calendar law. But in anticipation of such
legislation it is legitimate to consider the material — including
the testimony of Bahá’u’lláh — from a literary-critical point of

view in order to help establish which readings best comply with
objective hermeneutic criteria.

In summary: When seen as a reasoned rejection of the plan
advocated by the American National Spiritual Assembly to
activate this aspect of divine law, Shoghi Effendi’s reply
appears to confirm that no scriptural basis exists — also and in
particular no ruling on the part of the Guardian — in support
of the assumed indispensability of the spot: almost exactly the
opposite of what is generally interpreted into this text passage.

Conclusion

Every text has both an internal and an external context on
which the reliability of its interpretation is causally dependent.
Aside from its explicit content it has an origin, a purpose, an
evolutionary history, an intended readership. Its author
pursues a goal, represents interests, draws upon his own
knowledge and perspective, advances a point of view, presents
his own opinion, selects according to circumstances what to
say and what not to say. A number of these factors can be
easily recognised on the basis of text-internal clues, provided
that the text is of sufficient size; one or more of them might
even be explicitly addressed by the author himself.

The briefer the text, the more meagre the internal textual
context, and thus the greater the possibility of a misreading.
The external context, which in the case of a passage extracted
from a letter means the entire sequence of correspondence of
which it is a part, thus becomes all the more important. This
context is missing entirely in the available compilations of
letters from Shoghi Effendi — and yet the usefulness of such
compilations lies precisely in their extensive breadth of theme,
which in turn is only possible because the individual entries are
kept extremely brief. In other words, compilations are
problematic not by virtue of their quality, but by their very
nature. In any case, the pursuit of literary criticism in a
methodologically sound and systematic manner is not
practicable on the basis of such compilations alone.

This presentation has made use of many of the tools of
literary criticism, if not in all facets exhaustively: the

application of the methods of historical, linguistic,
literary/stylistic, tradition and genre criticism has led to
deeper insights into the text under analysis. But it will not be
sufficient in the long run for the Bahá’í community simply to
adopt existing tools of literary criticism “uncritically”.
Rather, the task is to examine these as a basis for the
development of a specific Bahá’í methodology which
acknowledges and reflects the unique quality of Bahá’í writings.
In no religious community before have primary documents
been preserved with such authenticity and in such plenitude as
they have been in the Bábí-Bahá’í revelations; bible critics, for
example, cannot even venture to dream of such felicitous
circumstances. And yet it is precisely this quality which
exposes literary criticism to fresh challenges which demand the
development of new departures for analysis. In this
presentation, for example, mention has been made repeatedly
of the heterogeneous cooperation which apparently existed
between Shoghi Effendi and his secretaries in the course of the
composition of individual letters. This working relationship
could be a central key to questions not only of interpretation,
but also of authenticity.

The methodology of literary criticism is principally the same
whether it is pursued in the service of one’s own personal
investigation of religious content or conducted as preliminary
analysis in the forefront of authoritative decision-making.
Since it aids in the search for, but brackets out the question of,
ultimate truth, literary criticism as I see it is a legitimate field
of activity for Bahá’í researchers who wish to make a
significant contribution to the formation of opinion
regarding the substance of Bahá’í belief without thereby
encroaching upon the areas of competence of those
institutions — the Guardianship and the House of Justice —
which are authorised to make binding pronouncements in the
name of the Faith.
