Neoplatonism and the Bahá’í Writings

Part 1

Ian Kluge

1\. Preface: What This Paper Is and Is Not

The purpose of this paper is to demonstrate that the
philosophy embedded in the Bahá’í Writings bears numerous
similarities to a group of philosophies generally referred to as
‘Neoplatonism’ which originated in the 3rd century CE with the
Enneads of Plotinus. To achieve this goal, it is necessary to
show that there are (a) foundational principles and ideas on
which the Writings and the Enneads agree and (b) significant
convergences between the Writings and Neoplatonic thought
even when there is not always detailed agreement. We hasten to
add that our focus is strictly on the ideas themselves and is not
concerned with the history of how the Enneads entered into
Muslim and Persian philosophy nor the vast extent of their
influence. 1

It is, of course, not our intention to suggest that the
Writings are simply a man-made philosophy, for as Shoghi
Effendi tells us, Bahá’u’lláh “has not merely enunciated certain
universal principles, or propounded a particular philosophy,
however potent, sound and universal these may be.”2

Therefore, it must be clearly stated that this paper studies
the philosophical aspects of the Writings, just as other papers
or books study the social, ethical, psychological or economic
aspects. The Writings include all these aspects but transcend
them all since they are inexhaustible divine revelation.
Moreover, this paper follows Shoghi Effendi’s suggestion
about the importance of “correlating philosophy with Bahá’í

150                                    Lights of ‘Irfán Book Eleven

teachings.”3 Neoplatonism may be an ancient philosophy but it
is currently undergoing an extraordinary revival not just at the
scholastic but also at the popular level.4 Consequently, a study
of the Writings and Neoplatonism may prove to be timely for
engaging in dialogue with those who thinking is sympathetic to
Neoplatonism.

It may be objected that Neoplatonism and the Writings has
already been studied in Mark Foster’s “Neo-Platonism:
Framework for a Bahá’í Ontology,” Nima Hazini’s
“Neoplatonism: Framework for a Bahá’í Metaphysics” and to
some extent in Juan Cole’s “The Concept of the Manifestation
in the Bahá’í Writings.” Valuable as these contributions are,
they do not, as we shall see, go nearly far enough in exploring
the extent of the similarities between the Writings and the
Enneads. For the most part, they focus on the theme of
emanation which ‘Abdu’l-Bahá mentions in Some Answered
Questions5 as well in The Promulgation of Universal Peace. 6
However, as we shall see, the similarities go far beyond the
subject of emanations.

It is natural to wonder what benefits can be derived from
“correlating philosophy with the Bahá’í teachings.”7 The first,
and most obvious is that doing so builds bridges to other
schools of philosophy and to religions that have strong
philosophical traditions. Christianity, Buddhism, Islam,
Judaism and Hinduism are examples of such faiths. The better
our philosophical understanding of the Bahá’í Faith, the better
is our ability to engage in serious, in-depth dialogue on
philosophical-theological subjects with these religions. Second,
and more specifically, elucidating such correlations encourages
bridge building to those religions and philosophies which, like
Christianity were heavily influenced by Neoplatonism through
the work of Origen, Augustine and Thomas Aquinas among
others. Third, understanding the philosophic aspects of the
Writings also facilitates apologetics because a philosophic
understanding often helps in constructing strong explications
for what the Writings say. For example, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá offers
several proofs of God, one of them being the First Mover
argument which requires the rejection of an actual infinite
regress as “absurd.”8 A philosophic understanding of the
problems inherent in the concept of an actual infinite regress

Neoplatonism and the Bahá’í Writings                               151

helps us explain why ‘Abdu’l-Bahá says this concept is
untenable.

2\. Ontology

Broadly put, ontology studies the nature of reality, i.e. the
nature, constitution and structure of reality as a whole. It
concerns such questions as what is real; what are the kinds or
categories of things (e.g. sensible realities, intelligible realities);
what attributes must all existing things have; and the
assumptions about reality underlying various philosophies,
world-views and even the sciences.9 Ontology differs from the
sciences insofar as the sciences focus on one special aspect of
physical reality such as living organisms or stars, whereas
ontology is concerned with the universal framework or context
in which all specific beings are found. Thus, ontology deals
with the broadest and most fundamental aspects of reality and
for this reason, understanding any system of thought requires
insight into its explicit or implicit ontological beliefs.

3\. The One and Its Essential Attributes

In the philosophy of Plotinus, the foundational concept is
that of the One, or, as it is often called, the Good, which is the
source and sustainer of all that exists. For the Bahá’í Writings,
the One or the Good, is, of course, known as God, Who is “the
Creator of all,”10 from Whom “all creation sprang into
existence”11 and Who is “the Sustainer”12 of the being of all
things.

The One or God is fundamental to Neoplatonic and Bahá’í
thought because most if not all subsequent ideas and teachings
are directly and/or indirectly related to the existence and
nature of the Divine.

One of the most important similar foundational premises
concerns the relationship of God or the One — we shall use these
terms interchangeably — to its essential attributes. It is
important to note that the One or ‘the Good’ as Plotinus calls
it does not have ‘goodness’ as an attribute but rather is
goodness itself. If the One possessed goodness as an attribute,

152                                      Lights of ‘Irfán Book Eleven

it would already be divided into two — itself and the attribute
it possesses13 — and would no longer be an absolute unity. Some
Answered Questions makes the same point about God’s unity
with His attributes:

> the essential names and attributes of God are identical
> with His Essence, and His Essence is above all
> comprehension. If the attributes are not identical with
> the Essence, there must also be a multiplicity of
> preexistences, and differences between the attributes
> and the Essence must also exist; and as Preexistence is
> necessary, therefore, the sequence of preexistences
> would become infinite. This is an evident error.14

God’s unity would be compromised by if there were a
difference between His essential attributes and His Essence,
and, of course God would be dependent on these attributes
which are other than Himself, i.e. these attributes would be
“preexistences” just as God is the “Preexistent”15 and the
attributes must exist with Him. There must also be an infinite
number of such attributes since God is without limits.
However, there would have to be an infinite sequence of
“preexistences”, i.e. pre-existing attributes between God-in-
Himself and His own attributes. Not only does such a division
make God multiple, but it is also impossible because according
to ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, there can be no actual infinite regress.16 (A
theoretical infinite regress of abstract numbers is possible, but
the number of actual things is always some definite number).
Thus, in the Writings, God, like the One is an absolute unity.
Plotinus also tells us that the One is one with its activity17 and
its own will. 18 Although the Bahá’í Writings contain no explicit
statement on these points, they are logically implied by the
teaching of the absolute unity and simplicity of God and the
statement that God is identical with His “essential names and
attributes.”

As noted above, if God were not one with His essential
attributes, i.e. if His essential attributes were separate from
Him, then He would be dependent on them for His nature to be
what it is. This is not feasible. As ‘Abdu’l-Bahá points out,
“God is absolutely independent;”19 Bahá’u’lláh states that the
existence of all things is

Neoplatonism and the Bahá’í Writings                          153

> contingent and not an absolute existence, inasmuch as
> the former is preceded by a cause, whilst the latter is
> independent thereof. Absolute existence is strictly
> confined to God ...20

The reason God cannot be dependent on anything else is that
He is the reason why all other things exist, He is the cause of
their being, and therefore, He cannot depend on them. In other
words, God, or the One has ontological priority. If He were
dependent on anything, this priority would be lost. Plotinus
sates, “There must be something simple that is before all things,
and must be other than all the things which derive from it.”21 If
the One is first, it cannot be dependent on anything.

Another way of saying that the One is absolutely
independent is say it is self-sufficient:

> This self-sufficiency is the essence of its [the One’s]
> unity. Something there must be Supremely adequate,
> autonomous, all-transcending, most utterly without
> need ... Any manifold [phenomena], anything beneath
> the Unity is dependent. 22

Plotinus refers to the unity of the One because the One’s
condition of absolute unity requires it to be completely
independent of anything else; if it were not, its unity would be
a ‘hostage’ to other things, and, therefore, not absolute.
Bahá’u’lláh states categorically that “God is Self-Sufficient,
above any need of His creatures,”23 an idea that is re-enforced
by also referring to God as “Self-subsistent.”24 In other words,
God’s existence is completely independent of anything else. The
One is absolutely self-sufficient, having no need of anything
else and exists, so to speak, in and through itself.25 Moreover,
God, or the One, is His own good i.e. goodness Itself and has
no higher good to which to aspire: He is “self-related and self-
tending,”26 i.e. tending toward Himself which is, in effect, an
affirmation of self-unity. This accords with the Writings’
reference to “the Oneness and unity of God.”27 This in turn
leads us to be aware of the simplicity, i.e. non-composite
nature of God, i.e. the simplicity of God which is one of the
reasons God is eternal, not subject to decay: “compositions are
destructible”28 while simple things like God or the One or the

154                                        Lights of ‘Irfán Book Eleven

rational soul are not. By definition they have no parts into
which they can decay.

The fact that the One is also beyond being29 is another way
of pointing to its unity and self-sufficiency. The One cannot
be identified with ‘being’ because the One is the necessary pre-
condition for all ‘being,’30 which requires a dyad of matter and
form and the resulting multiplicity. Such multiplicity is
incompatible with the One. ‘Being’ is what the One bestows
upon its emanations; it is what humans experience but is not
appropriate to the One. “It is precisely because there is nothing
within the One that all things are from it; in order that Being
may be brought about, the source must be no Being but Being’s
generator.”31 ‘Being’ as we shall see later is established by the
Nous which is the first hypostasis to emanate from the One.

4\. The Uniqueness of the One

This unity of God makes God ontologically unique, since all
things besides God are composites. This is especially evident in
material creation in which all things are composites of atoms.32
Indeed, according to ‘Abdu’l-Bahá,

> all things are composites of four causes: the existence
> of everything depends upon four causes — the efficient
> cause, the matter, the form and the final cause ...
> Therefore, this chair is essentially phenomenal, for It is
> preceded by a cause, and Its existence depends upon
> causes.33

This analysis cannot possibly apply to God or the One, Who
has no causes at all; He is not the result of any process of any
kind. More specifically, He has no efficient or final cause
bringing Him into being for otherwise He would not be the
“Preexistent” but secondary to His cause. Plotinus says that
the One is its own cause34 which, in effect, is to say, the One
has no cause at all since a literal interpretation would mean
that the One is divided into cause and effect — which violates
its unity. Such a claim also violates logic for to bring itself
into existence the One would have to exist before it exists!

Neoplatonism and the Bahá’í Writings                          155

Because it has no pre-existing cause, the One exists
necessarily, i.e. is a being Who cannot not exist. Unlike
phenomenal or contingent beings, God or “Essential pre-
existence [God] is an existence which is not preceded by a
cause,”35 which is to say that God is not a contingent but a
necessary being. The same idea is found in Plotinus’ statement
that “There must be something simple before all things, and this
must be other than all the things which come after it...”36
Because the One’s existence is not dependent on a preceding
cause, its existence is not a mere possibility but a necessity. To
argue that God may simply be a ‘potential’ or ‘possible’ is, in
effect, to argue that a cause precedes the One to bring it into
being which both the Writings and the Enneads reject.

God is also not limited by form and matter. God is not
matter because if He were, He would be divided (and
composite) as matter is, and He is not form because form by
definition requires exclusion or limitation37 to be something
identifiable, definite and definable. That clashes with His
unlimited nature. As Plotinus says, “The Unity is without
shape, even shape intellectual.”38 ‘Abdu’l-Bahá tells us that “God
is unlimited,”39 in any way, which implicitly contains the idea
that God is not limited by ‘form.’ If God were material (a stoic
concept rejected by Plotinus) He would also be subject to the
limitations of time and space and this is impossible for the
being whose existence is the necessary pre-condition for they
very existence of space and time.

Another way in which God’s unity makes Him unique is
that, in the words of Plotinus, “The First remains intact even
when other entities spring from it.”40 As ‘Abdu’l-Bahá says of
God, “The Real Speaker, the Essence of Unity, has always been
in one condition, which neither changes nor alters, has neither
transformation nor vicissitude.”41 In other words, creation
neither diminishes nor changes the Creator and is, therefore,
eternal — which lays the ontological foundation for the belief
that there has always been a creation of one kind or another:
“The Creator always had a creation; the rays have always shone
and gleamed from the reality of the sun, for without the rays
the sun would be opaque darkness.”42 Furthermore, divine unity
lays the foundations for the doctrine of emanation, which, as
we shall see, both Plotinus and the Writings share. God or the

156                                        Lights of ‘Irfán Book Eleven

One cannot be diminished by creation since that would
compromise His unity by being ‘dissoluble’ into separable
parts, a method of creation which ‘Abdu’l-Bahá refers to as
“manifestation.” Such diminishment would also undermine the
simplicity of the One which would scatter into parts. ‘Abdu’l-
Bahá clearly contrasts ‘manifestation’ with “emanation.”43 In
the latter, the creator and the created are related like “action
from the actor, [or] the writing from the writer,”44 which is to
say the writing is not a separable aspect of the writer. We shall
discuss this in more detail later.

5\. The Question of Creation

The unity of the One and the question of the One’s
diminishment in creation inevitably raises the issue of how the
One can create without undergoing change itself. Any
alteration in God introduces the idea of multiplicity — and
that is not acceptable. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá tells us that “Changes and
transformations are not applicable to that eternal reality
[God]. Transformation from condition to condition is the
attribute of contingent realities.”45 According to Plotinus, the
One does not change. 46 That being the case, how can we explain
the undiminished, i.e. unchanged condition of God? Plotinus’
answer is that he distinguishes between (a) the act of a thing
and (b) the act from a thing. As noted Plotinus scholar John
Deck says,

> There is heat of fire which is the same as the fire itself,
> and a heat that derives from fire. When the fire, by
> remaining just what It is, exercises the heat within
> Itself which is the Same as Itself, then the heat ‘towards
> the external’ ... has already necessarily come to be.47

In other words, the fire itself is unchanged even though other
things around it are heated. More technically, the One
“exercises its own co-subsistent act which is itself.”48 In short,
the act of the thing is the thing itself and the act from the thing
is towards something else. The first refers to the One’s unity,
the latter to the One’s creativity. The act emanating from the
One is distinct from the act of being the One, and therefore,
emanation does not change the One.

In keeping with this theme, we might also say that the One
acts merely by being, by its presence in the same way that a
magnet creates a magnetic field around itself simply by its
presence. The field does not diminish the magnet in any way
and, like creation, is a dependent correlate of the magnet.
Thus, the One’s existence is identical to its activity, a fact
which yet again emphasises the absolute unity of the One.

Yet another consequence of God’s unity and simplicity is
that He has no external relations. Bahá’u’lláh says that

> there can be no tie of direct intercourse to bind the one
> true God with His creation, and no resemblance
> whatever can exist between the transient and the
> Eternal, the contingent and the Absolute ... 49

Plotinus says the One is “unrelated to all”50 and adds, “We
cannot think of the First as moving towards any other; He
holds his own manner of being before any other was; even Being
we withhold and therefore all relation to beings.”51 “[M]oving
towards another” refers to entering relations which is made
explicit in the second half of the quote. The reason the One or
God has no external relations is that such relations would limit
God’s independence since the relation would ‘tie’ Him to
something lesser than Himself; this would also compromise His
freedom and ontological pre-eminence. Finally, it would also
limit God, i.e. deny His essential ontological nature such as
self-sufficiency: “This self-sufficing is the essence of its unity.
Something there must be supremely adequate, autonomous, all-
transcending, most utterly without need.”52 God, or the One, is
radically transcendent.

This lack of external relations is an important matter
because it is the basis not only for Plotinus’ philosophy of
emanationism and intermediary hypostases of the One, but is
also the basis for the Bahá’í teaching that an intermediary or
Manifestation is necessary:

> since there can be no tie of direct intercourse to bind
> the one true God with His creation, and no
> resemblance whatever can exist between the transient
> and the Eternal, the contingent and the Absolute, He
> hath ordained that in every age and dispensation a pure

> and stainless Soul be made manifest in the kingdoms of
> earth and heaven.53

In other words, the existence of the Manifestation (or Plotinus’
Nous and Soul) are not arbitrary, external impositions on
philosophy and theology but are inner logical necessities
mandated by the nature of God. For Bahá’ís it is the first
indication that the Manifestation is more than a human being
divinely elected and is, instead, a Being ontologically different
from humanity in essential respects.

Another aspect of the One’s radical transcendence is its
complete freedom from external constraint. Plotinus tells us
that the One (sometimes called the First) is only “determined by
its uniqueness and not in any sense of being under compulsion;
compulsion did not co-exist with the Supreme but has place
only among secondaries...”54 The “secondaries” are those things
that God created, and, therefore, come after Him ontologically
speaking. However, according to Plotinus and the Writings,
the “secondaries” have no power over God. In Bahá’í terms, He
is the “the One, the All-Powerful, the Almighty, the
Unconstrained.”55 From God’s absolute freedom, we may also
deduce His omnipresence, since to be truly “All-Powerful” He
must be present everywhere, i.e. unconstrained by limits of
time and space. According to Plotinus, the One is “everywhere
yet nowhere.”56 God, or the One is, of course, “nowhere”
because He is unlike ordinary things which are definitely
located in time and space. He is everywhere insofar as He is the
necessary pre-condition for the existence of time and space and
thus ‘is’ wherever time and space are found. It should be noted
that being a necessary pre-condition for time and space means
that the One cannot be identical to them.

6\. God Contains All

One of the key features of God or The One is that God
‘contains’ everything. This, of course, explains why He ‘is
everywhere.’ Plotinus writes,

> Everything brought into being under some principle
> not itself is contained either within its maker or, if
> there is an intermediate, within that; having a prior

> essential to its being it needs that prior always,
> otherwise it would not be contained at all.57

In other words, a being is ‘in’ some other entity if it depends
on that entity for its existence. It is virtually within its source,
i.e. is present in its source qua the (emanative) action of that
source just as ‘Abdu’l-Bahá tells us that the action is virtually
present within the speaker, or the writing within the writer.58
The idea of containment is also present in the Bahá’í Writings.
Bahá’u’lláh writes, “Likewise hath the eternal King spoken: “No
thing have I perceived, except that I perceived God within it,
God before it, or God after it.”59 This idea in turn serves to
provide ontological foundations for God’s omnipresence, for
if God is before, after and in everything, then He is obviously
present everywhere, i.e. omnipresent as we have noted
previously.

At this point a clarification is necessary. Saying that God
contains everything because of their dependence on Him does
not introduce multiplicity into God Himself. This
‘containment’ is simply the result of God’s ontological
position as the apex, i.e. the most inclusive form of being and
the source and foundation of all other beings. Moreover, He is
the necessary and sufficient condition of their existence and in
this sense ‘contains’ them simply by virtue of His being. We
might also say that God contains through His powers or names
such as “the Creator.” Bahá’u’lláh says, “His name, the Creator,
presupposeth a creation, even as His title, the Lord of Men,
must involve the existence of a servant.”60 The virtual
containment of things ‘within’ God or His names is the
‘presupposition’ of their existence in the name of ‘Creator.’

However, because the One contains all things does not mean
that Plotinus or the Writings advocate some form of
pantheism which identifies God and His creation. Plotinus
makes it clear that the One transcends all and though it
contains all things it is not any of these things: “All in that
region [of creation] is the One and not the One — nothing else
because deriving thence, yet not that because the One is giving
it forth is not merged into it.”61 Things ‘are’ the One because
they are the signs of its creative power, but they are not the
One because the One cannot be limited by any of the

conditions to which created things are subject. This is precisely
‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s point:

> the superior reality does not descend nor abase itself to
> inferior states; then how could it be that the Universal
> Reality of God, which is freed from all descriptions
> and qualifications, notwithstanding its absolute
> sanctity and purity, should resolve itself into the forms
> of the realities of the creatures, which are the source of
> imperfections? This is a pure imagination which one
> cannot conceive.62

Supporting pantheism would, in effect, be an admission that
God is not a simple, i.e. non-composite unity but rather is
dispersed throughout creation — a belief that ‘Abdu’l-Bahá
associates with “manifestation.”63 From this doctrine we can
also deduce why the Writings reject the Christian concept of
the incarnation: God cannot diminish Himself and descend
into a phenomenal being. It violates His very nature to do so.

The One is omnipresent not only as an efficient cause
bringing all things into being, it is also present as their final
cause. As Plotinus says,

> The Good [the One] is that on which all else depends,
> towards which all Existences aspire as to their source
> and their need, while Itself is without need, sufficient
> to Itself, aspiring to no other, the measure and Term of
> all ... 64

The One, God, is both the efficient and final cause of all
existence, i.e. the source and ground of their being as well as
the goal for which they strive, each in a manner appropriate to
their nature.

‘Abdu’l-Bahá says, “The Creator of all is One God. From this
same God all creation sprang into existence, and He is the one
goal, towards which everything in nature yearns,”65 Bahá’u’lláh
describes God as the “Desire of all created things.”66 By being
the ‘Great Attractor’ and drawing all things towards Him,
God, the One is the final cause which will complete their being
for in the process of evolving towards God, they will attain
their own highest perfection. The precise nature of this
perfection depends on the nature of the evolving being: for an

atom it may be motion, for an animal the life of instinct, for a
human being, a life dedicated to the spirit.

The belief that God is the final cause of all things also
indicates that creation, the universe, is teleological in its
deepest nature, i.e. goal oriented. This, in turn, suggests that
the development of nature is not purely a matter of chance, i.e.
“is not a fortuitous composition and arrangement.”67
Consequently, any cosmological explanations that ignore
teleology must be intrinsically incomplete, a viewpoint that
obviously has enormous implications for the Bahá’í teachings
about the harmony of science and religion. Science rejects
teleological explanations and this position will be difficult to
reconcile with the teleological views of the Writings.

7\. The Knowledge of the One

One of Plotinus’ most surprising statements is that the One
does not have knowledge — at least not knowledge in the human
sense which depends on a division between subject and object.
If the One possess this kind of knowledge, then knowledge and
the One are distinct, and this in turn implies a division in the
One. Thus, it cannot have objects of knowledge.

> The One, as transcending Intellect [Nous, the “First
> Mind”] transcends knowing; above All need, it is above
> the need of knowing which pertains solely to the
> Secondary Nature [Nous] ... The Transcendent, thus,
> neither knows itself nor is known in itself.68

If God or the One had objects of thought, He would no longer
be independent since He would need these objects in order to
know them. Knowledge, after all, requires a subject and an
object.

This would also compromise the unity of God, since the act
of thinking about things creates a division within the thinker,
i.e. between the thinker himself and the object of thought.
Insofar as God does not have knowledge or think as we do, God
is beyond knowledge and thought, i.e. He includes and
transcends them. Oddly enough, as Plotinus points out, this
means that God does not know Himself as an object of

knowledge — although of course He may know Himself in ways
that transcend the human mode of knowledge. The Good does
not need self-consciousness.69

Furthermore, God, the One, is not limited by ‘intellection’,
i.e. rational discursive thought conditioned by the
subject/object division and the matter/form distinction70
which characterizes created beings. As Plotinus says,
“intellection and the Intellectual-Principle [Nous] must be
characteristics of beings coming later.”71 Elsewhere Plotinus
says,

> In sum this intellection of the Good is impossible: I do
> not mean that it is impossible to have intellection of
> the Good — we may admit that possibility — but there
> can be no intellection by the Good itself, for this
> would be to include the inferior with the good...
> Anyone making the Good at once Thinker and Thought
> identifies it with Being ... 72

According to Plotinus, “intellection seems to have been given
as an aid to the diviner but weaker beings, an eye to the
blind.”73 Humans are among these “diviner” beings who possess
intellection.

The Bahá’í Writings agree with Plotinus’ basic teachings on
this issue of the absolutely unique nature of God’s knowledge.
‘Abdu’l-Bahá says:

> The Prophets say, The Knowledge of God has no need
> of the existence of beings, but the knowledge of the
> creature needs the existence of things known; if the

In other words, God does not require objects of knowledge
to know. While such knowing is inconceivable to human

beings, the necessity of this attribute can be logically deduced
from God’s unity and simplicity. The other characteristics of
God’s knowing as outlined by Plotinus — the lack of the
subject/object and matter/form division, the absence of self-
consciousness as we experience it and the lack of ration
discursive intellection — all can be logically deduced from
‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s foregoing statement. To the best of my
knowledge, the Writings do not contain explicit statements on
these issues, but they are implicitly present in other teachings
about God not requiring an object of knowledge.

This difference between human and divine knowledge brings
us to a fundamental principle of ontology and epistemology in
the Enneads and the Writings. In both of them, ontology and
epistemology, i.e. the nature of reality and our position in it
and what we can or cannot know are closely inter-related.
What we are able to know depends on our ontological degree or
condition. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá states,

> Difference of condition is an obstacle to knowledge;
> the inferior degree cannot comprehend the superior
> degree. How then can the phenomenal reality
> comprehend the Preexistent Reality? Knowing God,
> therefore, means the comprehension and the knowledge
> of His attributes, and not of His Reality.75

In other words, beings which stand lower in the hierarchy of
being cannot comprehend or understand the nature of those
beings above them. “The mineral cannot imagine the growing
power of the plant. The tree cannot understand the power of
movement in the animal,”76 says ‘Abdu’l-Bahá and adds, “All
superior kingdoms are incomprehensible to the inferior; how
therefore could It be possible that the creature, man, should
understand the almighty Creator of all?”77

Humankind cannot adequately understand God because
“That which contains is superior to that which is contained.”78
We have already noted that ‘contained’ in this context means
‘dependent on.’ By being ‘dependent on’ the One, all things are
inferior or secondary to it both in the order of being
(ontology) and in the order of logic, i.e. the One is the logical
pre-condition for the others. Because God occupies the
supreme ontological position, “the essential knowledge of God

surrounds, in the same way, the realities of things.”79 That is
why God has perfect understanding of them. We, however,
cannot form an adequate or complete conception of the One
because it is not limited by any of the conditions of existence
that limit us. We hasten to add that this does not necessarily
mean that all our conceptions are false. Logically,
incompleteness and falsity are not the same things since the
latter refers to a defect in the content of a statement while the
former does not.

It should be noted that in the Bahá’í Writings, the use of the
word “comprehend” combines the meanings of ‘contain’ and
‘understand,’ i.e. combines the ontological and epistemological
meanings of the word. For example, “Minds are powerless to
comprehend God”80 exhibits both meanings: minds cannot
contain God, i.e. be independent of God, and therefore, they
cannot understand Him more than their ontological position
allows. “For the phenomenal reality can comprehend the
Preexistent attributes only to the extent of the human
capacity.”81 In a statement that explicitly shows both meanings
simultaneously, He says,

> For comprehension is the result of encompassing —
> embracing must be, so that comprehension may be —
> and the Essence of Unity surrounds all and is not
> surrounded. 82

Thus, we can see how in the Writings, ontology and
epistemology are closely correlated and cannot be understood
apart from each other. The same is true in the Enneads: the One
which is the pre-condition for all existence and which
transcends all particular existences cannot be adequately
known by what it emanates.

8\. Knowledge About God

This, of course, raises a serious issue: how can we learn
about the One or God? The idea that God is completely
unknowable in anyway whatsoever is untenable for, among
other reasons, such a statement even refutes itself. To say that
God is unknowable is already to say that we know at least one

thing about Him. The Writings, however, tell us more precisely
what such phrases as ‘knowing God’ actually mean.

> Knowing God, therefore, means the comprehension
> and the knowledge of His attributes, and not of His
> Reality. This knowledge of the attributes is also
> proportioned to the capacity and power of man; it is
> not absolute. Philosophy consists in comprehending
> the reality of things as they exist, according to the
> capacity and the power of man.83

In other words, we know as much as human capacity allows
about God’s attributes or names but not about God-in-
Himself. Moreover we do not learn directly about God but
rather through the reliable instruction of the Manifestation.
Plotinus agrees that the One-in-itself is unknowable:

> Certainly the Absolute is none of the things of which it
> is the source — its nature is that nothing can be
> affirmed of it — not existence, not essence, not life —
> since it is that which transcends all these. 84

Elsewhere he says, “nothing can be affirmed of it [the One];”85
the One is ineffable, it cannot be written or spoken.86

> We do not, it is true grasp it by knowledge, but that
> does not mean that we are utterly void of it ; we hold it
> not so as to state it, but so as to be able to speak about
> it. And we can and do state what it is not, while we are
> silent as to what it is: we are, in fact, speaking of it in
> light of its sequels ...87

Thus, we can deny imperfections to the One, and we can talk
‘about’ it in our limited human terms derived from our
experience from created things, i.e. “its sequels.” As Dominic
O’Meara says,

> When we speak ‘about’ the One, saying that it is the
> cause, we are in fact speaking about ourselves, saying
> that we are casually dependent and expressing what we
> experience in this condition of dependence ... In this
> way the One remains ineffable in itself, even though we
> speak about it.88

We can only speak of the One in our terms, not its terms.

For Their part, the Bahá’í Writings also agree that God, the
One, is unknowable in Himself and knowable only in our
human terms. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá says that “it is certain that the
Divine Reality is unknown with regard to its essence and is
known with regard to its attributes.”89 In other words,
knowledge about (not of) God is available, but we must
understand the term ‘knowledge’ correctly:

> Nevertheless, we speak of the names and attributes of
> the Divine Reality, and we praise Him by attributing
> to Him sight, hearing, power, life and knowledge. We
> affirm these names and attributes, not to prove the
> perfections of God, but to deny that He is capable of
> imperfections ... It is not that we can comprehend His
> knowledge, His sight, His power and life, for it is
> beyond our comprehension; for the essential names and
> attributes of God are identical with His Essence, and
> His Essence is above all comprehension.90

Here, too, we observe that when we speak of God — as we
cannot avoid doing — then our speech must be understood in a
certain way, as a denial of imperfection rather than as an
attribution of perfections. This is precisely what Plotinus says:
“we can and do state what it is not, while we are silent as to
what it is.”91 The one thing God or the One cannot be is
imperfect. For Bahá’ís, however, reliable knowledge of God
comes from the Manifestation of the age.

The knowledge of the Reality of the Divinity is impossible
and unattainable, but the knowledge of the Manifestations of
God is the knowledge of God, for the bounties, splendors and
divine attributes are apparent in Them. Therefore, if man
attains to the knowledge of the Manifestations of God, he will
attain to the knowledge of God; and if he be neglectful of the
knowledge of the Holy Manifestations, he will be bereft of the
knowledge of God. 92
Elsewhere ‘Abdu’l-Bahá says,

> with reference to this plane of existence, every
> statement and elucidation is defective, all praise and all
> description are unworthy, every conception is vain,

> and every meditation is futile. But for this Essence of
> the essences, this Truth of truths, this Mystery of
> mysteries, there are reflections, auroras, appearances
> and resplendencies in the world of existence. The
> dawning-place of these splendors, the place of these
> reflections, and the appearance of these manifestations
> are the Holy Dawning-places, the Universal Realities
> and the Divine Beings, Who are the true mirrors of the
> sanctified Essence of God. All the perfections, the
> bounties, the splendors which come from God are
> visible and evident in the Reality of the Holy
> Manifestations. 93

This means that for Bahá’ís, there is a reliable source of
knowledge appropriately adapted to human capacity and that
all discourse about God is not necessarily futile if guided by
the Manifestations. Naturally, humans need to undergo
spiritual exercises to prepare themselves to accept this
knowledge (all receive this knowledge but not all choose to
accept it) of God, but the fact remains it is available for those
who choose to accept it. Nonetheless, in the Bahá’í view, our
personal efforts while necessary are not sufficient to attain
this knowledge: “Neither the candle nor the lamp can be lighted
through their own unaided efforts, nor can it ever be possible
for the mirror to free itself from its dross.”94

> Only when the lamp of search, of earnest striving, of
> longing desire, of passionate devotion, of fervid love,
> of rapture, and ecstasy, is kindled within the seeker's
> heart, and the breeze of His loving-kindness is wafted
> upon his soul, will the darkness of error be dispelled,
> the mists of doubts and misgivings be dissipated, and
> the lights of knowledge and certitude envelop his being.
> At that hour will the Mystic Herald, bearing the joyful
> tidings of the Spirit, shine forth from the City of God
> resplendent as the morn, and, through the trumpet-
> blast of knowledge, will awaken the heart, the soul, and
> the spirit from the slumber of heedlessness.95
Making an effort on our own is the necessary pre-condition
for the completion of the quest for knowledge by the holy spirit
or ‘Mystic Herald.” With Plotinus, however, there is no

counterpart to the holy spirit or the “Mystic Herald” to fully
actualize our quest for knowledge of the One. Nor is there in
the Enneads any guarantor of the knowledge we receive by our
own efforts, whereas in the case of the Writings, there is. In the
Enneads, we are completely left to our own spiritual efforts in
the quest for knowledge of the One.

9\. The One and Emanation

Having found numerous and far-reaching agreements
between Plotinus’ and the Bahá’í Writings’ concept of God or
the One, we shall now turn our attention to the issue of how
the One creates, i.e. to the issue of emanation. It should be
noted that the issue some controversy. Dominic O’Meara for
example, prefers the word “derivation”96 since ‘emanation’ has
too many problematical connotations. Lloyd P Gerson
challenges the applicability of the very concept of ‘emanation’
as traditionally understood in studying Plotinus.97 However,
this paper shall retain the traditional term ‘emanation’ not only
because it is used in the Bahá’í Writings but also because it is
the term most commonly used terms in discussions of
Neoplatonism.

Perhaps the best way to understand the concept of
‘emanation’ is to examine one of the most frequently used
images of emanation both in Plotinus and in the Writings.
Speaking of the One in relationship to its creations, Plotinus
says,

> The only reasonable explanation of [creative] act
> flowing from it lies in the analogy of light from the
> sun. The entire intellectual order [a lower level of
> creation] may be figured as a kind of light with the One
> in repose at its summit as its King: but this
> manifestation is not cast out from it [the sun] ... but
> the One shines eternally, resting upon the Intellectual
> Realm [Nous]; this [Intellectual Realm] not identical
> with its source ... 98

We observe important aspects of emanationism in this
selection: creation as a ‘light’ or efflux from the sun; the
unchanged and unchanging sun as the source of the light; the

source lasts eternally; the distinction between the light and the
sun. (Readers must, of course, bear in mind that it was
generally believed until relatively recent times that the sun was
unchanged and undiminished by the process of giving light.)
Noteworthy, too, is the ontological distinction between the
Creator, “source” and what is created (the Nous).

Elsewhere, Plotinus writes that the relationship between the
One and its creation

> must be a circumradiation — produced from the
> Supreme but from the Supreme unaltering — and may
> be compared to the brilliant light encircling the sun
> and ceaselessly generated from that unchanging
> substance. 99

Here, too, we observe the sun image with its emphasis on the
unchanging, and, by implication, undiminished being of the
sun as well as the surrounding. The fact that the sun radiates
“ceaselessly” also suggests another Neoplatonic and Bahá’í
teaching, viz. the eternity of the created world, i.e. that there
has always been a creation.

The Bahá’í Writings also compare God to the sun and
creation to the ‘circumradiant’ light.

‘Abdu’l-Bahá informs us that “Creation is like the sunlight;
God is the sun. This light comes forth from the sun; that does
not mean that the sun has become the light. The light emanates
from the sun.”100 Here, too, we observe the ontological
distinction between the sun (God) and the light (creation) and
that sun itself is not dispersed into the light. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá
describes such a dispersal as ‘manifestation’ which He clearly
distinguishes from emanation:

> But the appearance through manifestation is the
> manifestation of the branches, leaves, blossoms and
> fruit from the seed; for the seed in its own essence
> becomes branches and fruits, and its reality enters into
> the branches, the leaves and fruits. This appearance
> through manifestation would be for God, the Most
> High, simple imperfection; and this is quite impossible,
> for the implication would be that the Absolute
> Preexistent is qualified with phenomenal attributes.

> But if this were so, pure independence would become
> mere poverty, and true existence would become
> nonexistence, and this is impossible. 101

God, the sun, does not manifest Himself because to do so
would not only disperse God into phenomenal parts and,
thereby, demote Him to the level of His creations, but also
would diminish God Himself. The concept of emanation is
intended precisely to avoid such suggestions. The importance
of this point cannot be overstressed because it is the very fact
of non-dispersal that distinguishes emanationism from all
forms of pantheism. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá categorically rejects
pantheism when He says, “[T]he sun does not descend and does
not abase itself,”102 a position with which Plotinus agrees.

It should be mentioned in passing that although Plotinus
uses other images to illustrate the nature of the One and its
emanations, the underlying implications are always those cited
above. “Imagine a spring that has no source outside itself; it
gives itself to all the rivers, yet is never exhausted by what they
take, but remains always integrally as it was,”103 he says, and
then adds,

> think of the Life coursing throughout some mighty tree
> while yet it is the stationary Principle of the whole, in
> no sense scattered over all that extent but, as it were,
> vested in the root: it is the giver of the entire and
> manifold life of the tree, but remains unmoved itself,
> not manifold but the Principle of that manifold life.
> And this surprises no one: though it is in fact
> astonishing how all that varied vitality springs from
> the unvarying, and how that very manifoldness
> [multiplicity] could not be unless before the
> multiplicity there were something all singleness; for, the
> Principle is not broken into parts to make the total; on
> the contrary, such partition would destroy both;
> nothing would come into being if its cause, thus
> broken up, changed character. 104

This passage also shows the Plotinian principle that
multiplicity must be preceded by oneness, something
emphasised when he writes, “Standing before all things, there
must exist a Simplex [the One] differing from all its sequel, self-

gathered not interblended with the forms that rise from it.”105
Dominic O’Meara calls this the “principle of Prior
Simplicity.”106 According to him, this idea is common both to
Neoplatonism and science, which both seek to explain the
present state of the universe by reference to a simpler state, i.e.
deriving the complex from the simple, or, in the terms of
ancient philosophy, the many from the one. “Something all
singleness” must precede the creation of many. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá
confirms the same principle in various applications when He
states,

> it is necessary, therefore, that we should know what
> each of the important existences was in the beginning
> — for there is no doubt that in the beginning the origin
> was one: the origin of all numbers is one and not two.
> Then it is evident that in the beginning matter was one,
> and that one matter appeared in different aspects in
> each element ... This composition and arrangement,
> through the wisdom of God and His preexistent might,
> were produced from one natural organization ...107

Applied to ontology or metaphysics, the “principle of Prior
Simplicity,” inevitably leads to postulating a single source for
the entire universe, a concept that in physics may be termed a
‘singularity’ while in ontology the same ideas is expressed as
‘the One’ or ‘God.’ The significance of this principle is that it
highlights an underlying similarity between science both in
theory and practice and the philosophy inherent in Plotinus
and the Bahá’í Writings.

10\. Why Emanation?

If the One exists, why does it create? Trouble-free as it might
appear, this question, as we shall see, can lead to some difficult
considerations about necessity and free will. According to
Plotinus, the One “is perfect and, in our metaphor has
overflowed, and its exuberance has produced the new.”108 In
Enneads V, 4, Plotinus explicates the universal principle that
underlies the concept of emanation:

> If The First is perfect, utterly perfect above all, and is
> the beginning of all power, it must be the most

> powerful of all that is, and all other powers must act in
> some partial imitation of it. Now other beings, coming
> to perfection, are observed to generate; they are unable
> to remain self-closed; they produce: and this is true not
> merely of beings endowed with will, but of growing
> things where there is no will; even lifeless objects impart
> something of themselves, as far as they may; fire warms
> ... How then could the most perfect remain self-set- the
> First Good, the Power towards all, how could it grudge
> or be powerless to give of itself, and how at that would
> it still be the Source?109

The principle that ‘perfection generates beyond itself’ is
modelled by the One and imitated by all other things, each in its
own degree.110 The One sets this example, and to do otherwise,
i.e. to be ‘grudging’ of its inexhaustible power would be less
than perfect by the standard the One itself has set for itself.
Such superabundant generosity is the only appropriate
attribute to its infinite nature.

The Bahá’í Writings have a similar explanation for the
principle underlying God’s creation. The most succinct
statement comes from Gleanings: “His name, the Creator,
presupposeth a creation, even as His title, the Lord of Men,
must involve the existence of a servant.”111 In a more detailed
explanation, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá states,

> the reality of Divinity is characterized by certain
> names and attributes. Among these names are Creator,
> Resuscitator, Provider, the All-Present, Almighty,
> Omniscient and Giver. These names and attributes of
> Divinity are eternal and not accidental. This is a very
> subtle point which demands close attention. Their
> existence is proved and necessitated by the appearance
> of phenomena. For example, Creator presupposes
> creation, Resuscitator implies resuscitation, Provider
> necessitates provision; otherwise, these would be empty
> and impossible names. Merciful evidences an object
> upon which mercy is bestowed. If mercy were not
> manifest, this attribute of God would not be realized
> ...Therefore, the divine names and attributes

> presuppose the existence of phenomena implied by
> those names and attributes ... 112

First, we should note that these attributes are “not accidental,”
they are essential, i.e. attributes identical with God’s
Essence. 113 This is how God wills Himself to be. Second, the
name of “Provider” calls to mind Plotinus’ belief that the One
must be generous, not grudging; must have an abundance from
which to provide willingly. The same idea is implicit in the
names “Giver,” “All-Mighty,” and “Creator.” In other words,
the idea that God, the One, the “All-Possessing”114 creates out
of generosity and inherent wealth. Third, the passage indicates
that these creations are necessary because otherwise these
“attribute[s] of God would not be realized.” This leads to a
serious issue, namely, the freedom of God, or the One.
Plotinus asserts the One’s freedom, when he writes,

> It [the One] is, therefore, in a sense determined —
> determined, I mean by its uniqueness and not in any
> sense being under compulsion; compulsion did not
> coexist with the Supreme but has place only among the
> secondaries ... . this uniqueness [of the One] is not
> from outside.115

This means that freedom of will is established whenever we act
without pressure from external compulsions that force us to
do one thing or another. In the case of the One, which is free of
all external relations — as is God in the Bahá’í view as we recall
— there obviously cannot be any external compulsion acting on
the One. Thus, the actions of the One are entirely its own; if it
exercises will, it is pure self-will. The One’s generosity is free.
The Bahá’í Writings lead us to the identical conclusion. God is
the “All-Powerful,”116 which clearly tells that there is nothing
external to God which can exercise compulsion on Him. That
being the case, His actions are self-evidently free.

What about ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s statement that if there were no
recipients of mercy, God’s name of the Merciful “would not be
realized?”117 Does this not suggest compulsion, i.e.
requirements being exercised on God insofar as there is a
standard that He must meet? To answer this, we must
distinguish between verbal and logical necessity. For example,

saying that God must create beings for His mercy to be
revealed is an example of verbal necessity; the wording —
“must” — appears to suggest that God is being externally
compelled, but in actual fact, He is not so. God’s unique
nature and will have willed the situation to be such that the
revelation of His mercy includes the greatest number of beings.
Logically, He cannot be compelled by external forces and so,
any ‘compulsion’ must come from within Him — but that is the
very definition of freedom. The only constraints on the One or
God are ‘constraints’ of its own nature, which are not distinct
from it but rather, identical with it.

11\. Emanation and the Emanative Order

The concept of emanations is key to any comparison
between the Writings and the Enneads. There is no doubt that
the Bahá’í Writings advocate emanation as the means of
creating and structuring reality. For this reason, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá
in Chapter 53 of Some Answered Questions expends
considerable effort in explaining the difference between
emanation and manifestation. In manifestation

> the seed in its own essence becomes branches and
> fruits, and its reality enters into the branches, the
> leaves and fruits. This appearance through
> manifestation would be for God, the Most High,
> simple imperfection; and this is quite impossible, for
> the implication would be that the Absolute Preexistent
> is qualified with phenomenal attributes.118

The seed develops into the branches and leaves and is thus
ontologically one with them. In contrast, light emanates from
the sun; the sun is not changed or diminished and remains
ontologically distinct from the sun. Therefore, “Therefore, all
creatures emanate from God.”119

With this statement ‘Abdu’l-Bahá has already shown how
Bahá’í cosmology shares an emanationist foundation with the
Enneads. However, the similarities run further. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá
says,

> all creatures emanate from God — that is to say, it is by
> God that all things are realized, and by Him that all
> beings have attained to existence. The first thing which
> emanated from God is that universal reality, which the
> ancient philosophers termed the “First Mind,” and
> which the people of Bahá call the “First Will.” This
> emanation, in that which concerns its action in the
> world of God, is not limited by time or place; it is
> without beginning or end — beginning and end in
> relation to God are one ...
> Though the “First Mind” is without beginning, it does
> not become a sharer in the preexistence of God, for the
> existence of the universal reality in relation to the
> existence of God is nothingness, and it has not the
> power to become an associate of God and like unto
> Him in preexistence.120
Here we observe agreement with Plotinus’ statement that
Nous or “Mind” or “First Mind” is the first level of emanation
from the One, or God. The “philosophers” to whom ‘Abdu’l-
Bahá refers are in all likelihood the Neoplatonists, i.e. followers
of Plotinus or at least those influenced by Plotinus who have
adopted his emanationist schema. Further, we note that Nous
or “First Mind” is not constrained by time or space, just as it
is not in Plotinus, according to whom, time and space are part
of nature as an emanation of the Soul.121 In other words, Nous
is ontologically superior to time and space. For Plotinus, as for
the Writings, Nous has always existed but, unlike God, or the
One, it is not its own precondition for existence, i.e. does not
have “the preexistence of God.” Thus it remains ontologically
inferior to the One, because in both systems, it is derived from
the One and, therefore, dependent on it.

According to Plotinus, the order of emanations runs as
follows:

THE ONE

> NOUS
> SOUL — higher Soul (receptive)

> SOUL — lower Soul (active)
> Contains NATURE

Briefly, the One emanates the Nous, which contemplates the
One and becomes an image of it. It is important to bear in
mind that in Plotinus, contemplation is itself a form of
creation/emanation and, therefore, the Nous emanates the Soul
which is itself an image of the Nous.122

Here is how Plotinus describes the emanation of the Nous,
sometimes translated as ‘Spirit,’123 the Intellect, “the
Intellectual Principle” or “the Divine Mind.”124

> Seeking nothing, possessing nothing, lacking nothing,
> the One is perfect and, in our metaphor, has
> overflowed, and its exuberance has produced the new;
> this product has turned again to its begetter and been
> filled and has become its contemplator and so an
> Intellectual-Principle.125

The first product of the One’s superabundance is the Nous or
Mind, which represents a new, secondary and lower level of
reality, insofar as the Nous depends on the One. Indeed, the
Nous is the beginning of Being, for as Plotinus says, “the
source [the One] must be no Being but Being’s generator ... [the
Nous] establishes Being.”126 In other words, the One, or God
Himself is above Being because He is the necessary (and
sufficient) pre-condition for Being itself, i.e. “Being’s
generator.” If He were not, then He would, in a significant
way, be of the same ontological kind as His creations and the
Nous. This negates the absolute uniqueness of the One or God
and is an impossible state of affairs for Plotinus and the
Writings.

Plotinus also mentions that like all existing things, the Nous
represents “in image the engendering archetype,”127 i.e. the Nous
reflects its archetype, the One. However, because “all that is
fully achieved engenders”128, i.e. ‘creates’ or emanates a
subsequent, ontologically lower level of being, the Nous reflects
the attributes of the One into the still lower, i.e. more
dependent levels of being that emanate from Nous itself. In the
Plotinian schema, this means that the Nous emanates the Soul

and with the Soul, we have nature. Of course the Nous can only
do this because it is turned or oriented towards the One since
the “offspring must seek and love the begetter.”129

This latter point is worth exploring: the Nous fulfills its own
being by turning towards the One, i.e. by reflecting the light of
the One like a perfect mirror. This theme of turning towards
the One runs through the Enneads and the Bahá’í Writings; in
the latter, for example, the Manifestations are described as

> Primal Mirrors which reflect the light of unfading
> glory, are but expressions of Him Who is the Invisible
> of the Invisibles. By the revelation of these Gems of
> Divine virtue all the names and attributes of God, such
> as knowledge and power, sovereignty and dominion,
> mercy and wisdom, glory, bounty, and grace, are made
> manifest. 130

The assertion that the “Primal Mirrors” are “expressions” of
God, recalls ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s statement that “The proceeding
through emanation is like the coming forth of the action from
the actor, of the writing from the writer.”131 The “action” and
the “writing” are expressions of the actor or writer; they come
from the actor or writer but are not the same. In short, they
emanate from their source. Thus, to say that the “Primal
Mirrors” are an “expression” of God is to say that They are
emanations but, of course, emanations with ontological
priority over lower levels of reality.

> The dawning-place of these splendors, the place of these
> reflections, and the appearance of these manifestations
> are the Holy Dawning-places, the Universal Realities
> and the Divine Beings, Who are the true mirrors of the
> sanctified Essence of God.132
Elsewhere the Writings say,

> These Tabernacles of holiness, these primal Mirrors
> which reflect the light of unfading glory, are but
> expressions of Him Who is the Invisible of the
> Invisibles. By the revelation of these gems of divine
> virtue all the names and attributes of God, such as
> knowledge and power, sovereignty and dominion,

> mercy and wisdom, glory, bounty and grace, are made
> manifest. 133

Unlike all other things which, in their own way and indirectly
by way of the Manifestation, also reflect God’s light, the
“Universal Realities” reflect God’s light or creative power
directly; that is why They are “the true mirrors of the sanctified
Essence of God.” The word “universal” also suggests that they
affect all of reality and not only the aspects of reality known to
us. The Writings also say, “In the Manifestation of God, the
perfectly polished mirror, appear the qualities of the Divine in a
form that man is capable of comprehending.”134 In other
words, the “Primal Mirrors,” the Manifestations, make the
“names and attributes of God” apparent or “manifest,” in a
form comprehensible to lower levels of creation. Here we
observe how the Manifestations fulfill the major function of
the Plotinian Nous.

Let us now turn our attention to the Plotinian Soul. The
Soul reflects the Nous but not in a straight forward way since
the Soul itself has two aspects. First, there is a higher or
“pure”135 aspect which reflects the Platonic Ideas, or, as we shall
see, the names of God; this is the Soul-in-itself which is
sometimes described as the “intelligible world.”136 Second, there
is also an active ‘lower aspect’ of the Soul which emanates
nature itself. As Plotinus says, “soul has a double efficacy, its
act within itself and its act from within outwards towards the
new production.”137 The act “within” itself is the unknowable
inner essence of the higher Soul and its act “from itself” is the
‘lower’ Soul which directs action outward.

To explain why Soul creates the natural world, Plotinus
asserts,

> In the absence of body, soul could not have gone forth,
> since there is no other place to which its nature would
> allow it to descend. Since go forth it must, it will
> generate a place for itself; at once, body also exists.138

The Soul sees the darkness beneath it — the light of God has
reached its emanative limit or lowest level of ontologically
possible being. 139 Then the Soul “by seeing [contemplating]
brings to shape [form]”140 creates the ordered universe we

know. Dominic O’Meara tells us that “nature is not a reality
separate from soul in the same way that soul is a reality
separate from intellect [Nous].”141 Nature receives only the
faintest signs of this forming activity, but it is enough to make
an image of the One present in all things. Similarly, the Bahá’í
Writings say,

> Whatever is in the heavens and whatever is on the earth
> is a direct evidence of the revelation within it of the
> attributes and names of God, inasmuch as within every
> atom are enshrined the signs that bear eloquent
> testimony to the revelation of that Most Great Light.
> Methinks, but for the potency of that revelation, no
> being could ever exist.142

Even the light imagery here is consistent with the Enneads. In
the Plotinian sense of ‘dependence’ Soul contains nature;
therefore, “The Soul bears it up, and it lies within, no fragment
of it unsharing.”143 No aspect of nature is outside of or beyond
Soul which gives life to the natural world.

However, at this point we have reached an important
difference between the Writings and the Enneads. Whereas
Plotinus separates the functions of the Nous and the Soul, the
Bahá’í concept of the Manifestation includes the functions of
the Plotinian Nous and Soul, i.e. the Bahá’í concept of the
Manifestation combines the functions of the first two
emanations in the Plotinian system. Bahá’u’lláh says of the
Manifestations,

> all else besides these Manifestations, live by the
> operation of Their Will, and move and have their being
> through the outpourings of Their grace.144

Here Bahá’u’lláh categorically asserts that “all besides these
Manifestations” live by the “Will” of the Manifestations,
Who, in this sense have the life-giving function of the Plotinian
World Soul. It is by the Manifestations that all things “have
their being,” i.e. have their existence. This is exactly what the
Soul does for everything in nature. Another similarity between
the Manifestation and the Soul is that “the Sanctified Realities,
the supreme Manifestations of God, surround the essence and
qualities of the creatures, transcend and contain existing

realities.”145 Nature, as Plotinus tells us, is contained by the
Soul.

At this point a question arises. In the Enneads “Soul
contemplates [Nous] and creates matter.”146 Low as it is on the
ontological scale of being, matter enables the One’s attributes
to appear in the actual things in the world of nature. May we
conclude that the Manifestation creates matter in a manner
analogous to the Soul? It is certainly tempting to answer
affirmatively especially in light of Bahá’u’lláh’s statement:

> And since there can be no tie of direct intercourse to
> bind the one true God with His creation, and no
> resemblance whatever can exist between the transient
> and the Eternal, the contingent and the Absolute, He
> hath ordained that in every age and dispensation a pure
> and stainless Soul be made manifest in the kingdoms of
> earth and heaven.147

The fact that there is no “direct” tie between God and creation,
might also suggest that the intermediary between the “transient
and the Eternal” and the “contingent and the Absolute” could
have been the agent of creation. This agent would also be
responsible for the creation of matter. However, this only a
logical possibility which cannot be supported by textual
evidence from the Writings. Therefore, we must leave this
question unanswered until such time as further research can
clarify the issue.

Let us now examine a diagram comparing the emanative
order in the Writings and in the Enneads.

> THE ONE                      GOD
NOUS                         MANIFESTATION /

> KINGDOM
> “heavenly station”, “primal
> Mirror”

> SOUL — — higher Soul         MANIFESTATION /
> (contemplative)              KINGDOM

— physical, rational
embodied station

> SOUL — — lower Soul (active)    WORLD OF CREATION
> Contains NATURE

Most obvious here is that in both the Writings and in the
Enneads reality or existence is divided into three aspects.
According to ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, existence is ‘divided; into three
aspects, i.e. “the world of God, the world of the Kingdom, and
the world of Creation.”148 The Manifestation is the
intermediary between the “world of God” and the “world of
creation.”149 In Plotinus, we have the One, the Nous and the
Soul. In both cases we observe a tripartite division of
existence. We have already noted the similarity of function in
the three “hypostases” as Plotinus calls them.

12\. The Principle of ‘Turning Towards God’

Clearly, in the Enneads and the Bahá’í Writings, the
principle of ‘turning toward the source’ is established at both
the ontological and spiritual-ethical level. Indeed, the two levels
are related insofar as the highest ontological ‘being,’ i.e. the
One or God, is also the highest spiritual and ethical good.
Ontology thus determines ethics; the actual structure of the
universe determines the hierarchy of goods we are intended to
pursue with God at the apex and matter at the nadir. The order
or scale of being establishes the scale of values. The two order
of being and value are therefore correlated. As William Inge
writes,

> the hierarchies of existence and of value must
> ultimately be found to correspond ... it follows that
> that order of phenomena which has the lowest degree of
> reality in the existential scale must have the lowest
> degree of value in the ethical or spiritual scale.150

It is important to note that turning towards God is not
limited to the Manifestations. All beings do, and for
humankind this is particularly important because that is the
only way to realise our unique spiritual potential as humans. In
many places throughout the Writings, we are reminded to turn

our minds and hearts to God. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá tells us that the
Manifestations

> must so educate the human reality that it may become
> the center of the divine appearance, to such a degree
> that the attributes and the names of God shall be
> resplendent in the mirror of the reality of man, and the
> holy verse “We will make man in Our image and
> likeness” shall be realized.151

In Plotinian terms, only if we turn to our “begetter” will we
reflect the divine names and powers, and, thereby, make the
most of our potentials and be ‘most ourselves.’ This theme is
supported by the various exhortations to “polish the mirrors of
our hearts”152 which implicitly contains the idea of turning
towards God since otherwise, the mirror will not reflect God’s
light. Our spiritual task is to reflect God’s image, as Soul and
nature reflect the image of the Nous and the Nous reflects the
image and light of the One.

The implications of this correlation between the ontological
and ethical are profound. For example, it means that ethics
have an objective basis and are not only matters of personal
choice. The correlation between the ontological and ethical
orders allows us to assert that at least some ethical choices are
objectively right or wrong precisely because they agree or
conflict with the scale of being. Such choices are ‘unnatural’
because they violate the order of nature as established by the
One. The most obvious illustration of this is the categorical
Bahá’í rejection of materialism, at the ontological, scientific
and social/consumer levels. Making matter the foundation of
ontological and/or scientific explanation and the highest goal
of human aspiration is wrong because doing so literally turns
the “hierarchy of existence” on its head by giving priority to
that which is last. Such an inversion is, in the deepest sense,
‘unnatural,’ i.e. contradicts the divinely established scale of
being or “hierarchy of existence.”

Consequently, both the Bahá’í Writings and the Enneads
adhere to a concept of natural law — based on the scale of being
— as binding on human beings. ‘Natural law,’ of course, does
not mean that humans model themselves on nature as found on
the material nature; rather, it means that we model ourselves on

our essential, spiritual nature as reflected in the “hierarchy of
existence”: “Man is, in reality, a spiritual being, and only when
he lives in the spirit is he truly happy.”153 Many arguments
against ‘natural law theory’ fail on this ground: they assume
that ‘nature’ means ‘physical nature’ — and then point to
animal behaviors in nature as a way of justifying similar
behaviors in humans. “Natural law’ in the sense of the Writings
or the Enneads does not agree with this. In their view, certain
behaviors are rejected because they are inappropriate to
humankind’s spiritual nature or essence based on its high place
in the “hierarchy of existence.”154 These behaviors are
inappropriate because they show our lower animal aspects
dominating our higher spiritual aspects, 155 which is ‘unnatural’
precisely because it gives the lower precedence over the higher.
It inverts the “hierarchy of existence.”

The Plotinian and Bahá’í view of ethics may also be described
as ‘essentialist’ insofar as right and wrong are based on a
creature’s place in the scale of being. This should not be
confused with ethical relativism since in the essentialist view,
there are objective standards by which to evaluate our actions.
Differences in standards arise from differences in place in the
scale of being, not from our personal viewpoints or
preferences. However, beings that share the same essence, e.g.
humankind, are subject to the same standard.

Another similarity between the Writings and the Enneads is
that the higher levels of reality have knowledge not available to
the lower levels. For example, the Nous contains all lower levels
of reality because they depend on it (and ultimately on the
One). Therefore, the Nous is cognizant of all that pertains to
these lower levels because it contains them virtually and knows
them “self-reflexively156; it does not think discursively and
inferentially on the basis of the subject/object distinction. In
human terms, the Nous is infallible. Lloyd Gerson informs us
that “Plotinus is among the philosophers who hold that
knowing thus implies infallibility.”157

A similar line of reasoning is seen in the Writings. If, as we
have suggested, the Manifestation in His highest station
combines the functions of Nous and the Soul, then the
Manifestation virtually contains the lower levels of reality,

and, thereby has infallible knowledge of them. Thus, ‘Abdu’l-
Bahá tells us,

> Since the Sanctified Realities, the supreme
> Manifestations of God, surround the essence and
> qualities of the creatures, transcend and contain
> existing realities and understand all things, therefore,
> Their knowledge is divine knowledge, and not acquired
> — that is to say, it is a holy bounty; it is a divine
> revelation. 158

This knowledge is infallible because the Manifestations and
Plotinus’ Nous and Soul are not subject to time and place and
not limited by restrictions such as ‘future,’ ‘past,’ ‘here’ or
‘there.’ Furthermore, they are not just beyond physical space,
but also beyond phenomenological space such as ‘within,’
‘outside,’ ‘subjectivity’ and ‘objectivity.’ Therefore, all
possible knowledge is present to them. Hence, the
Manifestation has “essential infallibility.”159

It is clear, therefore, that “essential infallibility” is not
simply an arbitrary attribution to the Manifestation; nor is it
merely a token of respect or exaggerated or even irrational
religious veneration. Rather, it is a direct logical consequence
of the Manifestation’s place in the scale of being, i.e. a
consequence of the emanationist world-view espoused by the
Writings. There is no need to accept this teaching on ‘blind
faith’ contrary to reason.160

13\. The ‘Ideas’ or ‘Names of God’

There is yet another important issue to discuss regarding the
Nous and the Bahá’í Writings, namely, the issue of intelligibles,
or archetypes or as Plato called them, Ideas. According to J.M.
Rist, “[Nous] however comprises the World of intelligible
objects.”161

> if the Intellectual-Principle [Nous] is to be the maker of
> All, it cannot make by looking outside itself to what
> does not yet exist. The Authentic Beings [Ideas] must,
> then, exist before this All, no copies made on a model

> but themselves archetypes, primals, and the essence of
> the Intellectual-Principle. 162

Elsewhere Plotinus says, “the Intellectual-Principle [Nous] is the
authentic existences and contains them all — not as in a place
but as possessing itself and being one thing with this
content.”163 The “intelligible objects” or the “Authentic Beings”
are, in effect, Plato’s Ideas, i.e. models for nature, a lower level
of reality, to aspire to and imitate in concrete individual
examples. (They imitate these timeless models in the process of
time to which nature is subject, a fact which allows Platonic
theory and evolution to be combined. As Plato says, “Time
[evolution] is the moving image of eternity.”164) The Ideas exist
in the Nous which reflects them into the Soul which in turn
reflects them into the world of physical nature where they
appear as the embodied physical forms of things. However, this
still leaves us with the question of whether or not the Bahá’í
Writings contain anything that confirms Plotinus’ teaching on
this issue.

In our view, the Bahá’í Writings do, in fact, agree with
Plotinus’ insight albeit from a new perspective. First, we
should note ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s statement that “the earth is the
mirror of the Kingdom; the material world corresponds to the
spiritual world.”165 In other words, what we observe on earth
are the images of higher realities in the spiritual world. There is
a correspondence between the lower and higher. A similar idea
is expressed in the following statement by ‘Abdu’l-Bahá:

> Know thou that the Kingdom is the real world, and this
> nether place is only its shadow stretching out. A
> shadow hath no life of its own; its existence is only a
> fantasy, and nothing more; it is but images reflected in
> water, and seeming as pictures to the eye.166

Here, too, we observe the contrast between the “real world” of
the Kingdom of which this material world is only an imitation,
a mirror image, or a shadow. This clearly implies that the
‘models’ or ‘archetypes’ or, as Plato called them, the ‘Ideas’ are
in the Kingdom, which as we shall see is the world of the
Manifestation. The idea of a correspondence between the earth
and the Kingdom is re-emphasized from an ethical perspective
when he says that “the nether world [should] become the mirror

of the Kingdom,”167 i.e. the earth should reflect what is already
found in perfect form in the Kingdom. William Inge calls this
view real-idealism in which the world is “an actual but
imperfect copy of the perfect archetype.”168 He adds, “The
sensible world is a reflexion of the spiritual world in the mirror
of Matter.”169

The unavoidable implication of these and similar statements
is that the Kingdom contains models — or Plato’s ‘Ideas’ —
which the world should strive to emulate. Yet, strong as the
implication may be, such models are nowhere mentioned in the
Writings, at least, not by that name. However, it is our
contention that the Platonic ‘Ideas’ or Plotinian “authentic
existences” contained by the Nous is similar to the Bahá’í
concept of the names of God. For example, the Writings assign
the following names to God: “the Fashioner” “the Creator,” “the
Almighty” and the “Omniscient.” In our view, these names
virtually contain within them the archetypes or potentials of
everything that can exist. For example, Bahá’u’lláh states,

> through the mere revelation of the word “Fashioner,”
> issuing forth from His lips and proclaiming His
> attribute to mankind, such power is released as can
> generate, through successive ages, all the manifold arts
> which the hands of man can produce. This, verily, is a
> certain truth. No sooner is this resplendent word
> uttered, than its animating energies, stirring within all
> created things, give birth to the means and instruments
> whereby such arts can be produced and perfected.170

God, the Speaker utters the word “Fashioner” and thereby sets
into motion the generative, creative and energizing powers that
culminate in the existence of new things in the ontologically
lower levels of being. In other words, these processes realize the
potentials they virtually contain. If there were no potential for
order in the names of God, then the processes they unleash
would be chaotic instead of creative, i.e. would not result in
the creation of an ordered world. God reveals these names and
attributes first through the Manifestation, Who then reflects
them into the natural world in general and specifically, into the
“reality of man”171 where they best develop under the education
of the Manifestation.

Instead of thinking of the names of God as specific and
static Platonic Ideas abiding in the “First Mind,” it is
advantageous, in our view, to think of the names of God as
dynamic, as actions from God into the lower levels of reality.
To call God “the Creator” presupposes creative action in one
form or another; to call Him “the Omnipotent” requires that
He actually shows His power; to call Him “the Most Generous”
or “the Sustainer” presupposes actions that demonstrate those
traits; “Resuscitator      implies    resuscitation,    Provider
necessitates provision.”172 “The Merciful” presupposes the
action of showing mercy, and “Lord” requires the exercise of
power as well as subjects. A little reflection indicates that the
existence of all the objects of these actions is presupposed
within the actions themselves. In other words, the Platonic
Ideas that exist as entities within Plotinus’ Nous, exist
virtually as potentials within the actions that emanate from
God.

This solution also has the advantage of avoiding conflict
with the previously-discussed nature of God which does not
require objects of knowledge, i.e. which is not subject to the
subject/object dichotomy in knowing. If there are specific
Platonic Ideas such as those of humans, roses or gold, it is
difficult to see how they could exist without becoming objects
of knowledge. However, if humans and roses are implicates of
God’s essential name of Creator — which is identical with God
Himself — then no subject/object dichotomy arises. This does
not change even if we think of the names as dynamic actions.
These are the actions from God.

14\. Participation

The concept that the names of God correspond to the Ideas
or “Intelligibles” in the Enneads points to yet another
similarity — the theory of participation. According to
Plotinus, all created things participate, i.e. reflect the image of
the ontologically superior entity and through that reflection
process imitate or participate in its being. Thus, the Nous
participates in the One by reflecting its image like a mirror; the
higher Soul reflects the Nous and the lower Soul and Nature
reflect the higher Soul. Therefore,

> [e]verything has something of the Good, by virtue of
> possessing a certain degree of unity and a certain
> degree of Existence and by participation in Ideal-Form:
> to the extent of the Unity, Being, and Form which are
> present, there is a sharing in an image, for the Unity
> and Existence in which there is participation are no
> more than images of the Ideal-Form. 173

In some way or another, all things reflect the One, and thus
possess unity and “a certain degree of Existence;” the higher the
degree of participation, the higher the degree of existence
possessed; this process ends with the Nous or Manifestation in
His station as “Primal Mirror” Who has more existence or
reality than anything except God or the One. Belief in the
relativity of degrees of existence is also reflected in the Bahá’í
Writings: “The second proposition is that existence and
nonexistence are both relative.”174 Moreover in the Writings,
just as in Plotinus, God, or the One sets the standard for
measuring our existence: “the existence of creation in relation
to the existence of God is nonexistence.”175 The Manifestation,
of course, enjoys a greater degree of existence because His
ontological station as “Primal Mirror” is closer to God.

That said, it remains to note that in the Bahá’í Writings,
created things reflect the names of God, and, thus become
participants in the actions that these names refer to.

> Whatever is in the heavens and whatever is on the earth
> is a direct evidence of the revelation within it of the
> attributes and names of God, inasmuch as within every
> atom are enshrined the signs that bear eloquent
> testimony to the revelation of that Most Great Light ...
> How resplendent the luminaries of knowledge that
> shine in an atom, and how vast the oceans of wisdom
> that surge within a drop! To a supreme degree is this
> true of man ... For in him are potentially revealed all the
> attributes and names of God to a degree that no other
> created being hath excelled or surpassed. All these
> names and attributes are applicable to him. Even as He
> hath said: “Man is My mystery, and I am his mystery.176

Through the revelation of God’s names, all beings, and
especially humankind, become participants in the divine

emanative process. Individual human beings, of course, are
free to choose the extent and way in which they will reflect or
participate in the divine names or actions. That is why it is so
important to cleanse the mirrors of our hearts: “May the
mirrors of hearts be cleansed from dust in order that the Sun of
Truth may be reflected therein.”177 The more we polish our
mirrors, the more they will participate in the light of the divine
truth, i.e. names. Humankind’s special measure of bounty in
the regard constitutes its unique position in the order of
creation.

15\. Matter and Evil

Any study of the philosophy of Plotinus and the Bahá’í
Writings is bound to consider the issue of matter and its
relationship to evil. Before discussing this issue it is essential
to draw attention to two important points. First, when
Plotinus discusses matter he does not mean matter as we
ordinarily think of it, for example, minerals, elements or
compounds. According to the Enneads, this matter has already
received form to be a particular kind of matter, e.g. gold, roses
or granite. 178 Matter “lives on the farther side of all these
categories [that identify particular forms of matter] and so has
no title to the Name of Being.”179 For Plotinus, matter is the
“substratum”180 on which all the particular forms of matter are
imposed. It may also be described as ‘perfect receptivity’181
waiting for form and for this reason Plotinus compares it to a
mirror and what it reflects to “phantasms.182 Because matter is
formless, it is also unbounded, unlimited, shapeless and
without qualities and therefore has no particular form or
being. Matter, says Plotinus, is “utter destitution,”183 or, to
use the more common term, it is ‘privation’184 or lack of
attribute. It is like a shadow. It should be noted that matter is
the last stage or degree of the emanative process. As pure
receptivity or potential, matter cannot emanate anything
because in itself, it has nothing to give and can only receive.
However, at the same time, Plotinus states that matter aspires
to substance, i.e. real existence,185 although this aspiration can
never be met but must remain an aspiration. The One, or God,
is, of course, the most real of all existents and for that reason,

matter also aspires towards the One. We shall deal with this
topic below.

The second major point about matter and evil is that for
Plotinus, there are two kinds of evil which must not be
confused with each other.186 Moral evil is committed by human
beings as a result of free will while ontological evil is the result
of matter being the lowest level of the emanative process.
Because there are degrees of perfection in the stages of
emanation, there must be a point where there no more
perfections are possessed and there is only a perpetual
receptivity to perfections from higher levels of the emanative
process. Thus, when we say that matter is inherently evil in
Plotinus, we mean that it is ‘metaphysical evil,’ i.e. a lack of
attributes that can have any form imposed on it.

> Evil is not in any and every lack; it is absolute lack.
> What falls in some degree short of the Good is not Evil;
> considered in its own kind it might even be perfect,
> but where there is utter dearth, there we have Essential
> Evil, void of all share in Good; this is the case with
> matter. 187
Plotinus explains why this lack makes matter evil:

> [I]t corrupts and destroys the incomer, it substitutes
> its own opposite character and kind not in the sense of
> opposing , for, example, concrete cold to concrete
> warmth, but by setting its own formlessness against
> the Form of heat, shapelessness to shape, excess and
> defect to the duly ordered. Thus, in sum, what enters
> into Matter ceases to belong to itself, comes to belong
> to matter ... 188

In other words, matter brings about a lack of moderation, i.e.
a lack of limitation, of order, measure, shape or constraint.
Here we have not only an explanation for the ontological
nature of evil — or absolute disorder — but also the ontological
foundation for the Bahá’í emphasis on moderation, 189 and
constraint as seen for example, in the emphasis on “true
liberty”190 which “consisteth in man's submission unto My
commandments, little as ye know it.”191

In these teachings, we observe that in the Bahá’í Writings, as
in the Enneads, ethics are grounded in and correlated with
ontology. The higher we rise above matter in the emanative
order, i.e. the closer we approach the One or God, the closer we
approach to form, ‘Ideas,’ or the names of God, and thereby,
the closer we approach to own real nature or true ‘selves.’
Matter, of course, undermines form, order, measure and the
spiritual which means that the more we fall into the power of
matter, the less we shall be our ‘true selves.’ Applying this
principle to human ethics, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá says,

> Every good habit, every noble quality belongs to man's
> spiritual nature, whereas all his imperfections and
> sinful actions are born of his material nature. If a
> man's Divine nature dominates his human nature, we
> have a saint ... Saints are men who have freed
> themselves from the world of matter and who have
> overcome sin. They live in the world but are not of it,
> their thoughts being continually in the world of the
> spirit. 192

Elsewhere, He says that in receiving God’s bounty “the reality
of man becomes purified and sanctified from the impurities of
the world of nature.”193 In other words, moral goodness
requires that there be appropriate order in the soul.
‘Appropriate’ in the case of humankind means that the higher,
i.e. spiritual control the lower, i.e. material nature. When this
does not happen, when the soul turns away from the One and
to itself, it descends into non-being, in which the lower is in
control.194 Because the higher should control the lower it is
proper that man controls or masters nature (in a non-
destructive way) for man represents the spiritual principle in
the material world. 195 In both Plotinus and the Writings, the
spiritual takes ontological and ethical precedence over the
material.

At this point a note of caution is necessary. For the
Writings, nature and matter are not necessarily morally evil in
themselves. That is why ‘Abdu’l-Bahá says that “it is evident
that in creation and nature evil does not exist at all; but when
the natural qualities of man are used in an unlawful way, they
are blameworthy.”196 An “unlawful way” is taken when we

choose to submit the spiritual to our animal nature.
Consequently, Adam’s physical nature is the “source of all
imperfection”197 and his spiritual nature is the “source of all
perfection.” Furthermore, in nature, all existences are good in
themselves although they may not be good in relationship to
each other:

> Are they [scorpions] good or evil, for they are existing
> beings? Yes, a scorpion is evil in relation to man; a
> serpent is evil in relation to man; but in relation to
> themselves they are not evil, for their poison is their
> weapon, and by their sting they defend themselves. But
> as the elements of their poison do not agree with our
> elements — that is to say, as there is antagonism
> between these different elements, therefore, this
> antagonism is evil; but in reality as regards themselves
> they are good. 198

Thus, evil is relational insofar as a thing or an act can only be
evil in relationship to something else. The Enneads reflect a
similar view. Matter, i.e. utter privation or pure potentiality is
not evil in itself but in relationship to form; its effects are evil
because it undermines form with its formlessness and
immoderation. Matter may be evil in relationship to the soul
because the soul becomes fixated on the body and thus turns
away from the One. For that reason matter, bodies, nature can
drag humans into moral evil if humans choose to be dominated
by them. This happens when the soul focuses only on itself and
cuts itself off from the influence of higher emanations, and,
ultimately, the One.199 Cutting itself off from the One or the
Manifestation of God from Whom all gifts and powers are
obtained, causes the self to suffer deficiencies. This idea is
apparent in ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s statement,

> the sensible realities are absolutely good, and evil is due
> to their nonexistence — that is to say, blindness is the
> want of sight, deafness is the want of hearing, poverty
> is the want of wealth, illness is the want of health, death
> is the want of life, and weakness is the want of
> strength.200

Here, too, evil is being defined as a privation or lack of that
which is good, just as in Plotinus it is defined as that which

lacks form, order, or other positive attributes. 201 Thus, it is
non-being, 202 i.e. not nothing but rather the difference that
contradicts Being or the One. 203 Of course, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s
reference is to moral evil but we observe that the same principle
of ontological evil as privation is being applied. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá
asserts,

> the intellectual realities, such as all the qualities and
> admirable perfections of man, are purely good, and
> exist. Evil is simply their nonexistence. So ignorance is
> the want of knowledge; error is the want of guidance;
> forgetfulness is the want of memory; stupidity is the
> want of good sense. All these things have no real
> existence. 204

By “no real existence,” ‘Abdu’l-Bahá means that evil has no
substance, i.e. has no independent existence in itself but is
simply the lack of certain attributes and/or virtues. It has
‘presence’ insofar as we can detect, feel, recognise these
deficiencies ; however, this presence makes itself felt only by
way of a negative contrast, a deficiency of something that
should be there.

16\. The Return to God

The final subject we shall refer to briefly in this outline of
the similarities and convergences between the Bahá’í Writings
and the Enneads concerns the return to God. Such a return is
the deepest desire of all souls, whether they are aware of it or
not because all souls are attracted to beauty. As Plotinus says,

> Therefore, we must ascend again towards the Good, the
> desired of every Soul. Anyone that has seen This [Good
> or Beauty], knows what I intend when I say that it is
> beautiful. even the desire of it is to be desired as a
> Good. To attain to it is for those that will take the
> upward path ... divest themselves of all that we have
> put on in our descent ... 205

This statement is in complete harmony with Bahá’u’lláh’s
prayer, in which He addresses God as

> my Desire and the Desire of all things, my Strength and
> the Strength of all things, my King and the King of all
> things, my Possessor and the Possessor of all things, my
> Aim and the Aim of all things, my Mover and the
> Mover of all things! Suffer me not, I implore Thee, to
> be kept back from the ocean of Thy tender mercies, nor
> to be far removed from the shores of nearness to
> Thee. 206

What is striking about this prayer is that Bahá’u’lláh mentions
not just His desire but “the Desire of all things” (emphasis
added) and the “Aim of all things” (emphasis added). In other
words, He expresses not only His own desire for God but
universalizes His desire to include “all things” without any
qualification. He also refers to God as His “Aim” and then
again universalizes this claim to “all things;” He does not limit
it to Himself or human beings or even sentient beings. From
this perspective it appears that matter, since it is included in
the category of “all things” aspires to something greater though
how that aspiration makes itself known to us cannot be said at
this point.

17\. Conclusion

Even on the basis of an outline such as this, it is clear that
the Bahá’í Writings and the philosophy of Plotinus share
numerous similarities. There are, as we have noted, some
important differences between the Writings and the Enneads
but these are greatly outnumbered by the similarities we have
encountered. These correspondences make this subject worth
further in-depth study.
