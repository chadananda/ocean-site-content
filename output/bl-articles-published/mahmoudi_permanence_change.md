The Permanence of Change:
Contemporary Sociological and
Bahá’í Perspectives on Modernity
HODA MAHMOUDI

Abstract
This paper examines social change and modernity through the two lenses of the
Bahá’í Faith and sociology. Premised on the vital role of religion in effecting
social change, it progresses in three parts. First, it examines the sociohistorical
changes of the Axial Age, and the forces which brought about the Renaissance
and Reformation. Second, it reviews some of the sociological views on moderni-
ty, tracing its contemporary challenges. Finally, it outlines the key features of
modernity as identified in the Bahá’í writings and considers the Bahá’í perspec-
tive of modernity as “the universal awakening of historical consciousness,”
wherein Divine Civilization is the essential impetus for advancing and transform-
ing material civilization.

Résumé
L’auteur examine l’évolution sociale et la modernité à travers deux prismes : la foi
bahá’íe et la sociologie. Partant de la prémisse que la religion joue un rôle vital
dans l’avènement du changement social, l’auteur fait une analyse en trois volets.
Elle examine d’abord les changements sociohistoriques de l’âge axial ainsi que les
forces qui ont conduit à la Renaissance et à la Réforme. Puis elle passe en revue
certaines perspectives sociologiques sur la modernité, dressant les défis contem-
porains de celle-ci. Enfin, l’auteur souligne les principales caractéristiques de la
modernité, telles que présentées dans les écrits bahá’ís, et elle se penche sur la
perspective bahá’íe de la modernité comme « l’éveil universel d’une conscience
historique », où la civilisation divine imprime l’élan vital à l’avancement et à la
transformation de la civilisation matérielle.

Resumen
Este artículo examina el cambio social y la modernidad mirando a través de los
dos lentes de la fe Bahá’í y de la sociología. Con la premisa que la religión tiene
un rol vital en la creación de cambios sociales, este artículo se desarrolla en tres
partes. La primera examina los cambios sociohistóricos de la Edad Axial, y las
fuerzas que dieron luz al Renacimiento y a la Reforma. La segunda echa un vista-
zo a algunas de las teorías sociológicas sobre el modernismo, hasta llegar a sus
desafíos contemporáneos. La tercera, en fin, delinea los aspectos fundamentales
del modernismo según los Escritos Bahá’ís y considera la perspectiva Bahá’í sobre
la modernidad como el “el despertar universal de la conciencia histórica”, en
donde la Divina Civilización constituye el ímpetu esencial para el avance y la
transformación de la civilización material.

The Bahá’í Faith was conceived in the time of modernity, as was the
young discipline of sociology. The field of sociology examines the ori-
gins, organization, institutions, and development of human society. The
discipline was founded during a period in which society was undergoing a
torrent of change. As a new emerging field, sociology was shaped by the
complex problems of the nineteenth century, in particular the challenge
of how to preserve order in society without sacrificing progress. Socio-
logist Alain Touraine explained that classical sociology, in its aim to study
social life, “came into being by defining the good in terms of the social
utility of the modes of behaviour it observed” (Critique 352). “Sociology,”
according to Zygmunt Bauman, “aimed to know its object [human reality]
in order to guess unerringly where it tends to move and so to find out
what could and should be done if one wished to prod it in the right direc-
tion” (Society 1). Understanding the antecedents of the social changes
introduced by modernity and its contemporary influence on society are
core concerns of sociology.

Likewise, the Bahá’í Faith was founded during a period in which the
social order was undergoing tremendous change. As the newest of the
world’s religions, the Bahá’í Faith provides its own viewpoint on social
change and modernity, resolute in its claim that the foundation of such
change is the infusion of spirituality and moral obligation into all human

The Permanence of Change                            43

affairs. It views social change as a “necessary and an essential attribute of
this world” (Kitáb-i-Aqdas 4). Concerning the importance of the role of
religion in the advancement of the social order, the commentary One
Common Faith, commissioned by the Universal House of Justice, states,
“Throughout history, the primary agents of spiritual development have
been the great religions” (13). To exclude religion from the sociological
examination of modernity and social change would lead to only a partial
and artificial understanding of its significant influence. From the stand-
point of the Bahá’í Faith, enduring change is a natural state of human
existence, especially when examined from the spiritual dimension.

This paper examines social change and modernization from the per-
spective of the Bahá’í Faith and from a sociological comparative history
of civilization. The term modernity is defined as the structural and insti-
tutional changes and transformations which developed in the West with
what is commonly referred to as the Enlightenment. For the purposes of
this study, sociologist Yves Lambert’s periodized schema of modernity is
relevant. He explains modernity as beginning in the fifteenth and six-
teenth centuries with what he describes as not only “‘the modern age,’ but
also that of modern science, and of the birth of capitalism and the bour-
geoisie.” He further points out that “modernity only becomes a major phe-
nomenon at the end of this period with the Enlightenment, the English
and, especially, the American and French Revolutions, the birth of scien-
tific method and thought, and the birth of industry” (Religion in Modernity
306).

Premised on the vital role of religion throughout history in effecting
social change, this paper consists of three sections. The first covers sever-
al periods in history that experienced sociohistorical changes during a sig-
nificant shift from primitive to civilized societies referred to as the “Axial
Age.” A brief survey follows, covering the social forces that brought about
the Renaissance and the Reformation, leading to the revolutionary changes
that took shape with the growth of the Enlightenment in Western
Europe. The second section examines modernity from various sociologi-
cal perspectives, reviewing its evolution and tracing the challenges that

44           The Journal of Bahá’í Studies 18. 1/4. 2008

contemporary society is undergoing as a consequence of the sweeping
changes brought on by modernity. The last section examines the meaning
and characteristics of change and modernity as described in the Bahá’í
writings in correlation with the sociological perspectives.

The Revelation of Bahá’u’lláh, although founded in mid-nineteenth-
century Iran, established a blueprint for the transformation of society
which not only accepts but goes well beyond the general changes brought
about through modernity. The Bahá’í writings view the emergence of
modernity as yet another phenomenon of social change reflecting the
“transformative power that has been responsible for all of humanity’s
development over the ages” (Universal House of Justice, 26 November
2003). “Transformative power” is explained in the writings of Bahá’u’lláh
as the gift of the human spirit which consists of the reasoning or ration-
al “faculty with which God hath endowed the essence of man” (Gleanings
163). It is the rational faculty that is the source of the advancement of
civilization throughout history.

Humanity, as described in the Bahá’í writings, has traversed stages
which are likened to the organic development in the life cycle of human
beings—including stages of infancy, childhood, and adolescence—and is
now entering the age of maturity. This new age is associated with the
unification of the whole of humankind, the formation of a world
commonwealth, and far-reaching advances in the intellectual, spiritual,
and moral life of the entire human race. As the social order advances on
that course, humanity finds itself participating in two multifaceted but
simultaneous processes of decline and rise. On the one hand, there is sig-
nificant decline among the antiquated social structures, institutions, and
cultural practices currently prevalent in all societies. This pattern is
responsible for the increasing levels of turbulence, violence, and the
breakdown of the social order. On the other hand, there is the emergence
of the Bahá’í Faith: a movement whose aim is to integrate the affairs of
humankind, building new institutions and social structures responsive to
the challenges and requirements of an ever-changing social order. In so
doing, the Bahá’í Faith offers a model for the construction of a complex
worldwide social order moving gradually towards the development of a

The Permanence of Change                           45

planetary civilization. The emerging civilization, according to Bahá’í
texts, is grounded on a firm spiritual foundation based on divine revela-
tion.

During his travels in America in 1912, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá spoke about the
nature of the changes taking place throughout the social order as a result
of the advent of the Revelation of Bahá’u’lláh. Addressing the Unitarian
Conference in Boston, Massachusetts, He said: “Creation is the ex-
pression of motion. Motion is life. . . . nothing is stationary in the mate-
rial world of outer phenomena or in the inner world of intellect and
consciousness” (Promulgation 140). He explained the role of religion as a
divine, living, vitalizing, progressive institution. Drawing attention to
the nature of the enormous positive changes that have taken place in
modern times, He stated that “[a]ncient laws and archaic ethical systems
will not meet the requirements of modern conditions, for this is clearly
the century of a new life, the century of the revelation of reality and,
therefore, the greatest of all centuries” (Promulgation 140). He then asked
His audience to

> [c]onsider how the scientific developments of fifty years have sur-
> passed and eclipsed the knowledge and achievements of all the for-
> mer ages combined. Would the announcements and theories of
> ancient astronomers explain our present knowledge of the suns and
> planetary systems? Would the mask of obscurity which beclouded
> medieval centuries meet the demand for clear-eyed vision and under-
> standing which characterizes the world today? Will the despotism of
> former governments answer the call for freedom which has risen from
> the heart of humanity in this cycle of illumination? It is evident that
> no vital results are now forthcoming from the customs, institutions
> and standpoints of the past. (Promulgation 140)

‘Abdu’l-Bahá thus challenged His audience to envision a future in which
a new and radically different civilization would be built on principles of
justice, equality, and unity. Before exploring in more detail the influence of
modernity on contemporary society and its potential for transforming the

46            The Journal of Bahá’í Studies 18. 1/4. 2008

current social order, an examination of the rise and fall of past civiliza-
tions is in order.

The sociologist Rollin Chambliss, in his work on Social Thought, likens
history to a river. He explains,

As the passing waters have come from somewhere and do not cease
> to be when they are no longer in sight, so it is with events. The mod-
> ern world is to a large extent the medieval and the ancient worlds.
> The languages we speak, the institutions to which we adhere, and the
> values we cherish are for the most part not modern at all. Never-
> theless, just as the waters of a river change in appearance and motion,
> as crystal-clear streams receive discolouring tributaries or are broken
> up by cataracts, so do patterns of human behaviour and thought
> undergo transformations. (283)

Similarly, when examining the significant changes that have taken place
at pivotal points in history, it is evident that such events were not merely
isolated incidents without effect. On the contrary, change— both gradual
and, at times, rapid—results from discoveries, developments, and interac-
tions which to some extent had their roots in the past. The “passing wa-
ters” of the river of human history, as expressed by Chambliss, to some
extent describes Bahá’u’lláh’s teachings on the progressive nature of di-
vine revelation and its continual influence on the evolution of human con-
sciousness throughout history. Religion, as it traverses human history,
draws from the timeless universal spiritual teachings revealed in all the
major world religions. However, each successive religious revelation
unfurls new knowledge and understanding that conform to the changes
and challenges of its particular age, causing the steady edification of hu-
man consciousness.

Without a balanced and unfettered examination of religion’s influence
on civilization, a full grasp of the forces affecting historical and contem-
porary events, including the influence of modernity, is not possible. As a
further elaboration on Bahá’u’lláh’s concept of “progressive revelation,” in
One Common Faith, the role that the founders of religion perform in rela-
tion to the development and progress of humanity is explained as follows:

The Permanence of Change                            47

It is . . . an inadequate recognition of the unique station of Moses,
> Buddha, Zoroaster, Jesus, Muh.ammad—or of the succession of
> Avatars who inspired the Hindu scriptures—to depict their work as
> the founding of distinct religions. Rather are they appreciated when
> acknowledged as the spiritual Educators of history, as the animating
> forces in the rise of the civilizations through which consciousness has
> flowered: “He was in the world,” the Gospel declares, “and the world
was made by him. . . .”1

. . . Religion, thus conceived, awakens the soul to potentialities that
are otherwise unimaginable. (21, 33–34)

Spiritual educators throughout history have provided humanity with the
prerequisite conditions, the vitalizing forces responsible for the rise and
progress of civilizations. A case in point is the approximately one thou-
sand years from 500 BC to the first century of the Christian era when, over
time, civilizations crystallized as either dynasties or empires, bringing
about major transformations. The German philosopher Karl Jaspers
referred to these as “Axial Age civilizations” (Origin and Goal).

THE AXIAL AGE

Jaspers explains that during the “Axial Period” the Mythical Age came to
an end. Exceptional changes were brought about in relation to human
consciousness in this period, which Jaspers described as an era in which
“Man is no longer enclosed within himself,” further stating that the “over-
all modification of humanity may be termed spiritualization” (Origin and
Goal 3).

Sociologist Shmuel Eisenstadt has referred to the Axial Period as hav-
ing brought about “revolutionary breakthroughs” which changed the
course of human history. These changes were the result of a growing
awareness, a consciousness of “new types of ontological visions and con-
ceptions of a basic tension between the transcendental and the mundane
orders” (Eisenstadt, Japanese Civilization 13).2 Recognition of the incom-
pleteness or inferior nature of the mundane order led to views which saw
this order as “evil or polluted, and therefore in need of reconstruction”

48            The Journal of Bahá’í Studies 18. 1/4. 2008

(Eisenstadt, Fundamentalism 4). Emerging conceptions about life first
developed among what Eisenstadt described as autonomous small groups
of “intellectuals” such as prophets or visionaries, who were “carriers of
models of cultural and social order” (Fundamentalism 4). As such models
prevailed over time, they became institutionalized into the dominant ori-
entation of the ruling class and a large portion of the secondary elites.
Eisenstadt gives as examples the “institutionalization of the monotheistic
vision attributed to Moses in ancient Israel, the Pauline vision in Christi-
anity, and Confucian metaphysics in China” (Japanese Civilization 1). In
these civilizations, tension between the transcendental and the mundane
orders led to the construction of distinct civilizational frameworks, the
emergence of an autonomous sphere of law and the notion of rights, and
the evolution of the concept of the accountability of rulers and the com-
munity to a higher authority—that of divine law or God. In other words,
in these civilizations which became centers of continuous struggle and
change, new conceptions of social organization evolved.

It was also during the Axial Age that the first universal religions ap-
peared. The historian David Christian explains, “It is no accident that uni-
versal religions appeared when both empires and exchange networks
reached to the edge of the known universe, controlling populations with
diverse belief systems and lifeways. Nor is it an accident that one of the
earliest religions of this type, Zoroastrianism, appeared in the largest
empire of the mid-first millennium BC, that of the Achaemenids, and at
the hub of trade routes that were weaving Afro-Eurasia into a single
world system” (319). It was during this same period that not only the
Zoroastrian religion appeared, but also Manichaeism, Buddhism,
Confucianism, Judaism, Christianity, and beyond the Axial Age proper,
Islam.

As these societies crystallized, enormous changes took place in ancient
Israel and the period of Second-Temple Judaism and Christianity, as well
as in Zoroastrian Iran, ancient Greece, and early imperial China. Travel
along trade routes such as the Silk Road brought Buddhism, Mani-
chaeism, and Nestorian Christianity to China. Beyond the Axial Age, the
Mesopotamian region came under the control of Islam, which would

eventually spread to Spain, East Africa, Central Asia, North China, and
eventually to India and regions of Southeast Asia. Christianity spread in
the Mediterranean region but retreated as Islam was introduced to the
area, although it would return again in the late second millennium.

Throughout history, as in Axial Civilizations, examples of continual
economical, social, and cultural interactions are evident even where there
has been clear mutual hostility, conflict, and war among such societies. Of
such interactions between civilizations, historian Amin Banani wrote,
“Throughout history societies seemingly independent of one another, and
indeed often mutually hostile, have been deeply in each other’s debt. An
outstanding example can be found in the Middle Ages, when the Western
Christian world was engaged in a bitter struggle with the Islamic east;
and yet the flow of commerce and the bonds of spiritual and intellectual
endeavor held the two together” (Modernization of Iran 1).

Lambert points out that the concept of the Axial Age “has not been uti-
lized by sociologists to analyze modernity” (305). As an exception, he
cites Szakolczai and Füstös: “An axial moment occurs when there is a
global collapse of the established order of things, including the political
system, the social order of everyday life, and the system of beliefs—a
very rare event—leading to a major spiritual revival . . . that, as an
answer, locates the source of order inside the individual” (Szakolczai and
Füstös 213).

The authors give several examples of axial moments throughout his-
tory: the first centuries BC and AD, which saw the collapse of the Roman
Republic and the rise of Christianity; the fifth through the seventh centu-
ries, during which occurred the collapse of the Roman Empire and the
rise of Islam; the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries, which saw the decline
of Middle Ages and the emergence of the Renaissance and Protestantism;
and lastly, “the two major stages of the dissolution of political absolutism
and the traditional European social order, the Enlightenment and the
growth of socialism” (Szakolczai and Füstös 213).

The section that follows examines the axial moment during which the
collapse of the established order brought about a significant renewal with
the emergence of the Renaissance and Reformation.

THE RENAISSANCE, THE REFORMATION,

AND THE AGE OF ENLIGHTENMENT

The Renaissance in Western Europe marked the transition from medieval
to modern times, a period of cultural rebirth from about the fourteenth
through the eighteenth centuries, which brought about transformations in
the arts, literature, and learning. The scientific revolution changed in-
dividual perceptions of the world, ushering in a revolution in human
knowledge. The origins of the Renaissance may be traced back to the
Islamic civilization, a fact not acknowledged by Eurocentric historians.
The advent of Islam in the seventh century led to the gradual emergence
of a series of empires that brought about the largest networks of cultur-
ally, socially, technologically and economically advanced societies in world
history up to that time (Hobson).3

‘Abdu’l-Bahá mentions this fact in The Secret of Divine Civilization, stat-
ing that “in every particular the basic elements of [Europe’s] civilization
are derived from Islám” (92). In a letter dated 27 April 1936 written on
behalf of Shoghi Effendi, the impact of Islam on European culture dur-
ing the Renaissance is explained as follows:

> The so-called Christian civilization of which the Renaissance is one of
> the most striking manifestations is essentially Muslim in its origins
> and foundations. When medieval Europe was plunged in darkest bar-
> barism, the Arabs, regenerated and transformed by the spirit released
> by the religion of Muh.ammad, were busily engaged in establishing a
> civilization the like of which their contemporary Christians in
> Europe had never witnessed before. It was eventually through Arabs
> that civilization was introduced to the West. It was through them that
> the philosophy, science and culture which the old Greeks had devel-
> oped found their way to Europe. The Arabs were the ablest transla-
> tors and linguists of their age, and it is thanks to them that the writ-
> ings of such well-known thinkers as Socrates, Plato and Aristotle
> were made available to the Westerners. It is wholly unfair to attrib-
ute the efflorescence of European culture during the Renaissance

> period to the influence of Christianity. It was mainly the product of
> the forces released by the Muhammadan Dispensation. (In Hornby
> 496)

In the sixteenth century, the Protestant Reformation awakened a new
curiosity concerning nature, human beings, and God. The movement was
successful in making way for a clean break with tradition and authority in
both sacred and secular matters. Shoghi Effendi wrote the following about
the contribution of the Reformation in defining the societal role of reli-
gion, which at that time had become corrupted by the leaders of the
Church: “What contribution the Reformation did really make was to seri-
ously challenge, and partly undermine, the edifice which the Fathers of
the Church had themselves reared, and to discard and demonstrate the
purely human origin of the elaborate doctrines, ceremonies and institu-
tions which they had devised. The Reformation was a right challenge to
the man-made organization of the Church, and as such was a step in ad-
vance. In its origins, it was a reflection of the new spirit which Islam had
released. . . .” (in Hornby 494; emphasis added).

The Age of Enlightenment developed as a European intellectual move-
ment centered on the celebration of reason and the capacity of humans to
understand the universe and improve the human condition. The notion
(with its roots in ancient Greek thought) of society as a social contract
underwent innovative changes during the Enlightenment. Voltaire in
France, Hobbes in England, and Jefferson in America challenged the
rights of monarchies and aristocracies and the authoritarian state, estab-
lishing instead the principles of freedom, justice, and democracy.
Eventually the French and American Revolutions replaced old institutions.
Church and state were separated, bringing about a secular and materialis-
tic modernity in which humans ruled over nature. Historian Gertrude
Himmelfarb describes the common traits of the Enlightenment as respect
for reason and liberty, science and industry, justice, and welfare (20).

Although outwardly the Enlightenment brought about a significant de-
cline in the role of religion due to rigid attachments to man-made dogmas,
from the standpoint of the Bahá’í writings religious decline, whenever it

52            The Journal of Bahá’í Studies 18. 1/4. 2008

occurs, signals the progressive and continuous nature of divine revelation.
Bahá’u’lláh, in describing the principle of progressive revelation, wrote:
“Know of a certainty that in every Dispensation the light of Divine
Revelation hath been vouchsafed unto men in direct proportion to their
spiritual capacity” (Gleanings 87). From the Bahá’í viewpoint, the institu-
tion of religion was once again undergoing renewal and leading humani-
ty to its next stage of development. It was around 1873 that Bahá’u’lláh
revealed his Most Holy Book, The Kitáb-i-Aqdas, and claimed that the
challenge of his Message was “to build anew the whole world” (Gleanings
99). This text “is the Charter of the future world civilization that
Bahá’u’lláh has come to raise up” (Kitáb-i-Aqdas 1–2). In a statement pre-
pared by the Bahá’í World Centre about the publication of the first
authorized English translation of the Kitáb-i-Aqdas, the following obser-
vation is made about the timing of its unveiling soon after the age of
Enlightenment: “The Kitáb-i-Aqdas makes its appearance in a world
which, since the Enlightenment’s rejection of religion as the ultimate
moral authority, has engaged in an increasingly urgent search for an alter-
native place to stand. Today, it is apparent that this effort has failed.
Neither Marxist determinism nor popular faith in situational or consen-
sus ethics offers a basis upon which the system of values required by an
emerging global society can be erected” (Bahá’í World 107).

The role of religion as a relevant progressive institution did not stop
with the emergence of the Age of Reason or the Enlightenment. Indeed,
the period after the Enlightenment saw the rise of modern culture, the
modern world, and the birth of a new religion in the nineteenth century.

MODERNITY

The events that took shape in Western Europe over several centuries, as
described above, led to the onset of what sociologists, among others, refer
to as modernity. The advent of modernity in the late eighteenth century
radically transformed every aspect of human life. Modernity gave rise to
new organizations, social structures, and a new type of society. In dis-
cussing the emergence of modernity, Eisenstadt explains that “some of

these processes manifested themselves in dramatic events like the great
political revolutions of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries; others
appeared in more general and cumulative trends, like the scientific revolu-
tion or the development of rationalism—all of them very strongly rein-
forced by and connected with developments and trends in the economic
life” (Tradition 203–4). Although fraught with many setbacks and uncer-
tainties, modernity has now become a global phenomenon with a new set
of challenges.

One of the prominent features of modernity, from the Bahá’í perspec-
tive, “has been the universal awakening of historical consciousness” (One
Common Faith 53). Modernity has aroused a historical awareness of the
progressive nature of the role of the institution of religion. Throughout
history, religion, looked upon as the series of prophetic revelations, has
not only guided the individual on the path of spiritual salvation, but has
prepared him or her for the appearance of the latest revelation, that of
Bahá’u’lláh. This point is further elucidated in One Common Faith:

The declared purpose of history’s series of prophetic revelations,
> therefore, has been not only to guide the individual seeker on the path
> of personal salvation, but to prepare the whole of the human family
> for the great eschatological Event lying ahead, through which the life
> of the world will itself be entirely transformed. The revelation of
> Bahá’u’lláh is neither preparatory nor prophetic. It is that Event.
> Through its influence, the stupendous enterprise of laying the founda-
> tions of the Kingdom of God has been set in motion, and the popula-
> tion of the earth has been endowed with the powers and capacities
> equal to the task. That Kingdom is a universal civilization shaped by
> principles of social justice and enriched by achievements of the human
> mind and spirit beyond anything the present age can conceive. (54)

SOCIOLOGICAL VIEWS OF MODERNITY

With this vision in mind, we will now examine various sociological views
about modernity and the alterations it continues to bring about in an ever-

54            The Journal of Bahá’í Studies 18. 1/4. 2008

changing social order. Sociologist Philip Selznick has stated that moder-
nity refers to the technologically “advanced industrial, commercial, urban
society that has taken shape in the West since the eighteenth century, an-
ticipated . . . by earlier trends and ideas” (4).4 Modernity brought about
the shift from traditional to modern societies, separating “household and
work, church and state, religion and community, ownership and manage-
ment, education and parenting, law and morality, private and public life”
(4). Kinship connections, sense of community, the extended family, and
other social ties weakened under modernity. Modernity brought about
efficient the coordination of activities through contract and bureaucracy.
Secularization diminished the role and authority of religion, making it a
strictly personal matter. Selznick wrote that modernity’s break with tra-
dition “has been a powerful engine for the release of energies, the achieve-
ment of excellence, and the protection of rights” (6). As an example he
gives the rule of law, which requires an independent judiciary and the
concept that no official is above the law, and that because of the legitima-
cy of the law a wide range of fundamental rights are protected.

Sociologist Anthony Giddens wrote the following about modernity:

At its simplest, modernity is a shorthand term for modern society
> or industrial civilization. Portrayed in more detail, it is associated
> with (1) a certain set of attitudes towards the world, the idea of the
> world as an open transformation by human intervention; (2) a com-
> plex of economic institutions, especially production and a market
> economy; (3) a certain range of political institutions, including the
> nation-state and mass democracy. Largely as a result of these charac-
> teristics, modernity is vastly more dynamic than any previous type of
> social order. It is a society— more technically, a complex of institu-
> tions—which unlike any preceding cultures lives in the future rather
> than the past. (Conversations 94)

Another sociologist, Zygmunt Bauman, describes modernity as “a his-
torical period that began in Western Europe with a series of profound

social-structural and intellectual transformations of the seventeenth cen-
tury and achieved its maturity (1) as a cultural project—with the growth
of Enlightenment; (2) as a socially accomplished form of life—with the
growth of industrial society (capitalist and later communist)” (Modernity
and Ambivalence 4). In the modern world, the traditional order was
replaced by the nation-state, which is synonymous with society.

Among the many goals that modernity has aspired to achieve is that of
bringing about order in society. Modernity attempted to tame the unruly
nature of human affairs by creating a man-made society based on control.
“The very project of modernity,” according to Bauman, “is born out of
the desire for a world without surprise, a safe world, a world without fear”
(“The Unwinnable War”). Bauman explains that the “Enlightenment
philosophers dreamed of an orderly world obedient to human will: mild
and hospitable. And humans would not be forced to rely on the wisdom of
divine creation, but were to realize these dreams on their own” (“The
Unwinnable War”). The hope was that in the modern world reason would
bring about predictability.

From the outset, modernity, like the historical civilizations of the past,
did not spread in a systematic fashion to all parts of the globe. Some
sociologists were under the assumption that modernity would develop
throughout the world in the same manner as it did in modern Europe: all
societies would eventually experience structural changes both organiza-
tionally and institutionally similar to those occurring in the West. After
World War II, the “Convergence” theory, advocating “the unity of man-
kind,” was put forth as a single institutional model for “modern society”
(Eisenstadt, “Tradition, Change and Modernity” 15). The theory suggest-
ed that major institutional features of modernity would ultimately devel-
op in all modern societies (Eisenstadt, Fundamentalism 196–98). This, of
course, did not happen.

In theory, it was reasoned, as articulated by Eisenstadt, that “the cultur-
al program of modernity as it developed in modern Europe and the basic
institutional constellations that emerged there would ultimately take over
in all modernizing and modern societies; with the expansion of moderni-
ty, they would prevail throughout the world” (“Multiple Modernities” 1).

As it spread unevenly to different regions of the world, modernity was
likened to the “crystallization of a new type of civilization,” as Eisenstadt
described it, “not unlike the spread of great religions, or great imperial
expansion of past times. . . . But while modernity has spread to most of
the world in one form or another, it has not given rise to a single civiliza-
tion” or to any one pattern of ideological or institutional model
(Eisenstadt, “Cultural Tradition” 502–3). These variations as identified by
Eisenstadt have led to his formulation of the theory of “multiple moder-
nities,” which challenges classical sociological theories of modernization
widely accepted after World War II. Multiple modernities are not identi-
cal with Westernization but explain the history of modernity and its mul-
tiplicity of cultural programs.

A leading example of multiple modernities is the modernization of
nineteenth-century Japan and the Meiji state, which although culturally
distinctive and different from modern Europe and the United States,
showed “far-reaching similarities to the West” in relation to its institu-
tional capacity (Eisenstadt, Japanese Civilization 2). Other examples of
multiple modernities include modernization in India, as well as the vari-
ous social movements such as fundamentalism, fascism, and communism
which advocate a complete reconstruction of the social order through
political action, using an aggressive missionary stance to achieve their
goal. These movements combine protest and construction in bringing
about a new social and cultural order (Eisenstadt, Fundamentalism). The
theory of multiple modernities addresses two important factors. The first
is that new social movements continually evolve with new and different
ideologies reacting, sometimes violently, and in competition with the
changes that modernity has already brought about. The second is that no
matter how hard certain social movements, such as fundamentalism, aim
to stop or destroy the changes taking place in society, they are unable to
bring about fixity or finality in the continuously changing modern social
order.

Bauman refers to the current state of affairs in the late modern era as
“liquid modernity,” referring to the uncertainties and the rapidly chang-
ing nature of contemporary life (Liquid Modernity). The Bahá’í writings,

in contrast, describe change and its acceleration as a main component and
enduring feature of contemporary life. Shoghi Effendi refers to Bahá’-
u’lláh’s World Order as “involving the reconstruction of mankind”
(Promised Day 123), describing it “as a living organism” with features that
allow for its expansion and adaptation to “the needs and requirements of
an ever-changing society” (World Order 23). Although at present the rap-
idly changing social order has brought about a dangerously fragmented
world with rampant individualism and excessive materialism, from the
Bahá’í perspective the current confusion is viewed as a natural outcome of
the progressive nature of divine revelation and the purpose of religion in
guiding human affairs. One Common Faith places such pervasive changes in
contemporary life squarely on the arrival of the Revelation of Bahá’u’lláh.
For example, in examining religious differences that are often highlight-
ed as barriers to a unified system of truth, the Bahá’í teachings point out
that throughout history progressive revelation has benefited from a sys-
tem of knowledge emanating from one Source or one religion with integ-
rity and freedom, and totally removed “from the contradictions imposed
by sectarian ambitions” (22). This point is further expounded upon in One
Common Faith by comparing the customs governing personal life with the
features of the material life of humankind:

> It is most unlikely that diversity in hygiene, dress, medicine, diet,
> transportation, warfare, construction or economic activity, however
> striking, would any longer be seriously advanced in support of a the-
> ory that humanity does not in fact constitute one people, single and
> unique. Until the opening of the twentieth century, such simplistic
> arguments were commonplace, but historical and anthropological re-
> search now provides a seamless panorama of the process of cultural
> evolution by which these and countless other expressions of human
> creativity came into existence, were transmitted through generations,
> underwent gradual metamorphoses and often spread to enrich the
> lives of peoples in far distant lands. That present-day societies repre-
> sent a wide spectrum of such phenomena, therefore, does not in any
> way define a fixed and immutable identity of the peoples concerned,
58            The Journal of Bahá’í Studies 18. 1/4. 2008

> but merely distinguishes the stage through which given groups are—
> or at least until recently have been—passing. Even so, all such cultur-
> al expressions are now in a state of fluidity in consequence of the
> pressures of planetary integration. (25)

The “state of fluidity” mentioned in the above extract is analogous to
Bauman’s notion of “liquid modernity” or the variable nature of moder-
nity in contemporary life. From the Bahá’í perspective the “state of fluid-
ity” as experienced in material life is similar to the evolutionary process
characterizing the continuous role of religion in human history. Religion
is progressive, concerned with the requirements of a world in flux, as it
gradually advances toward the crystallization of a new civilization. The
contemporary challenge into future centuries, as addressed in the Bahá’í
writings, is how to establish an integrated planetary system which, while
rightly upholding the diversity of the peoples, cultures and nations of the
world, aims to achieve the oneness of humankind and construct institu-
tions and an administrative structure capable of establishing and protect-
ing a permanent universal peace and thus ensuring the happiness and
well-being of humankind.

Another outcome of the uncertainties brought about as a result of the
changes introduced by modernity is the role of the nation-state. By the
early twentieth century, many scholars began to question the efficacy of
the nation-state, suggesting that it was losing its power. Among some his-
torians and sociologists a strong consensus is put forth indicating that the
nation-state was an “unfinished project” which at best was made up of
“frail coalitions of but partly compatible forms of life” (Huntington
9–10).5 The Bahá’í perspective, on the other hand, not only recognizes the
importance of the formation of nation-states, but sees their legitimate
establishment as necessary to the foundation of the future Bahá’í world
commonwealth.6 Ideally, nation-states establish and sustain territories,
create and uphold laws, and protect the rights of citizens. However, under
the present global system, the powers of the sovereign state are curtailed,
giving rise to a variety of identities formed around ethnicity, religion, ide-
ology, and the like. Despite such emerging patterns and views, it is evident

that nation-states still play a major role in the development of globaliza-
tion.7 Eisenstadt explains the role of nation-states, global markets, and
the colossal changes that have brought about globalization as follows:

The multiple and divergent instantiations of the “classical” age of
> modernity crystallized during the nineteenth century and above all in
> the first six or seven decades of the twentieth century into very dif-
> ferent territorial nation—and revolutionary states and social move-
> ments in Europe, the Americas, and, after World War II, in Asia. The
> institutional, symbolic, and ideological contours of modern national
> and revolutionary states, once thought to be the epitome of moderni-
> ty, have changed dramatically with the recent intensification of forces
> of globalization. These trends, manifested especially in the growing
> autonomy of world financial and commercial flows, intensified inter-
> national migrations and the concomitant development on an interna-
> tional scale of such social problems as the spread of diseases, prosti-
> tution, organized crime, and youth violence. All this has served to
> reduce the control of the nation-state over its own economic and
> political affairs. . . . Nation-states have also lost a part of their monop-
> oly on internal and international violence . . . to local and internation-
> al groups of separatists or terrorists. (“Multiple Modernities” 16)

Although not an entirely new term, in the twenty-first century, “global-
ization” has become a popular word for describing the astonishing
changes occurring in the world, especially in the global market economy.
Bauman refers to globalization as “that uncanny experience of the ‘world
filling up’” (Society 13). Over the decades there was much talk about an
interdependent world, but never before has this interdependence been, as
it is today, more tangible. We can no longer hide behind borders, guard
boundaries, and view the world as being comprised of “insiders” and “out-
siders.” Bauman put it most aptly when he said, “Of this full world we are
all insiders and permanent residents with nowhere to go” (12).

Some have referred to the changes brought about by globalization as
the “postmodern society”. Others, such as Bauman, reject the postmodern

60            The Journal of Bahá’í Studies 18. 1/4. 2008

theory, indicating that whereas “models of modernity articulated a shared
vision of modern history, as a movement with a direction—and differed sole-
ly in the selection of ultimate destination or the organizing principle of
the process, be it universalization, rationalization, or systemization. . . .
none of those principles can be upheld in the light of postmodern expe-
rience” (“Sociological Theory” 150). Touraine describes postmodern cul-
ture as being “incapable of creating anything” and warns about the return
of “nationalisms, particularisms, fundamentalisms—religious and other-
wise” (Critique 3, 4).

In addition to globalization, some of the characteristics of postmodern
society are described as consumerism, the fragmentation of authority, and
knowledge as a commodity. “In postmodern politics,” Bauman explains,
“individual freedom is the supreme value and the yardstick by which all
merits and vices of society at large are measured” (Postmodernity 206).
The excessive and dangerous emphasis on individual freedom is explained
by Bauman as a consequence of the loss of power on the part of nation-
states in confronting social, political, and economic problems requiring
solutions that would acknowledge the integrative nature of the emerging
global social order. Some have suggested that with the diminishing influ-
ence of the nation-state, no alternative legitimate agency has emerged
upon which the individual can rely on to bring order to global relations.
For the individual, the sense of safety is lost. The lack of security endan-
gers individual freedom, which in turn brings about a desire for individ-
ual protection. But as history has shown, the individual alone cannot act
as a catalyst in bringing about individual freedom or happiness. This
dilemma has led some sociologists to remark on the incapacity of post-
modern society to create the one condition which can secure freedom for
all: the condition of solidarity or unity.

In his lecture entitled “Barbarism: A User’s Guide,” historian Eric
Hobsbawm makes observations regarding the root cause of the decline of
civility in modern society which are pertinent to the discussion of the
present conditions found in so-called postmodern society. Hobsbawm is of
the opinion that “after about 150 years of secular decline, barbarism has
been on the increase for most of the twentieth century, and there is no

sign that this increase is at an end” (On History 223). He describes the two
conditions of barbarism that have impacted the global culture:

> First, the disruption and breakdown of the systems of rules and
> moral behaviour by which all societies regulate the relations among
> their members, and to a lesser extent, between their members and
> those of other societies. Second . . . the reversal of what we may call
> the project of the eighteenth-century Enlightenment, namely the
> establishment of a universal system of such rules and standards of
> moral behaviour, embodied in the institutions of states dedicated to
> the rational progress of humanity: to Life, Liberty and the Pursuit of
> Happiness, to Equality, Liberty and Fraternity or whatever. Both are
> now taking place and reinforce each other’s negative effects on our
> lives. (253–54)

One Common Faith describes the present moribund condition of the
world as the “bankruptcy of the materialistic enterprise,” pointing out
that for “over a hundred years, the idea of progress was identified with
economic development and with its capacity to motivate and shape social
improvement” (8). Instead, a “consumer culture” has evolved where for the
few that “can afford them, the benefits it offers are immediate, and the
rationale unapologetic.” With the breakdown of traditional morality

> the advance of the new creed is essentially no more than the triumph
> of animal impulse, as instinctive and blind as appetite, released at
> long last from the restraints of supernatural sanctions. Its most obvi-
> ous casualty has been language. Tendencies once universally castigat-
> ed as moral failings mutate into necessities of social progress.

> vents itself as public information; perversions of various kinds

The multiple disorders confronting humanity in the early phase of the
twenty-first century are issues about which sociologists are continually
searching for solutions. As a discipline, sociology continues to explore the
central question of how to maintain order in the rapidly changing mod-
ern world in which outdated institutions have lost their legitimacy. In an
attempt to provide answers to such questions, Alain Touraine offers the
following insightful view on the significance of change and its influence
on contemporary sociology:

Change is not simply the sum total of modifications of the
> environment; it is also a sign of cultural creativity and of a power
> which has expanded beyond the spheres of economy and politics into
> the production and diffusion of informations and—in a more general
> sense—symbolic goods, i.e. culture. In this sense, contemporary soci-
> ology can take the guidelines of classical sociology to their most
> extreme consequences. even more than before, it is concerned with
> the study of modernity, the self-transforming capacity of society; and
> it sees the struggle for social control over this capacity as the struc-
> turing principle of social life. (“Is Sociology” 183)

Today the social forces of change appear to have unleashed disorders
that seem impossible to manage, whether by individuals, organizations, or
sovereign states. When asked about his views regarding the current
struggles between various political factions and ideologies that are at war
with one another throughout the world, Bauman responded with the fol-
lowing statement: “In our disorganized world, the struggle currently tak-
ing place is not about the shape of the future world order, but rather about
who is going to decide this shape” (”The Unwinnable War”).

The sociological perspectives on the changing nature of modernity do
not necessarily contradict the Bahá’í viewpoint. Rather, the descriptions of
the nature and extent of the changes that the social order is to undergo,
as described in the Bahá’í texts, correlate with various concepts put forth
by sociologists. Describing the world as “ever-changing,” Bahá’u’lláh ex-
plained that the fundamental purpose of the institution of religion is to

bring about change. He explained that every prophet who has been sent
to “the peoples of the earth hath been entrusted with a Message, and
charged to act in a manner that would best meet the requirements of the
age in which he appeared” (Gleanings 111). As stated earlier, the Bahá’í
writings explain the changing nature of the social order and the transfor-
mations that it will continue to undergo as permanent conditions of the
present age, which is advancing towards its destiny. What follows is an
examination of the features of modernity from the Bahá’í perspective,
written when the Bahá’í Faith was founded in nineteenth-century Iran.

THE BAHÁ’Í FAITH AND MODERNITY

When Bahá’u’lláh’s new Faith was founded, the European continent was
already well into the age of modernity, with changes occurring in the edu-
cational, scientific, technological, economic, political and cultural arenas.
The Middle East, on the other hand, was in decline, and Iran in particu-
lar had been in a state of decay and stagnation since the collapse of the
Safavid dynasty in early 1700s (Lewis). The Qajar dynasty, which ruled
the country at the time, was organized into a hierarchical system with the
shah at the top, followed by members of his family in descending order,
aristocratic families whose loyalty to the king established their position,
tribal chiefs (khans) who would provide military support to the king when
needed, bureaucrats indebted to the king, and religious leaders who
gained power by participating in the secular government. Nineteenth-
century Iran is generally described as a backward, morally bankrupt,
intellectually impoverished society suffering from illiteracy, poverty, des-
potism, and traditionalism.8 The writings of Bahá’u’lláh disclosed during
this same period a radical vision of the world progressing toward a new
civilization, “a universal civilization shaped by principles of social justice
and enriched by achievements of the human mind and spirit beyond any-
thing the present age can conceive” (One Common Faith 54).

In his voluminous writings, Bahá’u’lláh describes the function of the
Manifestation of God and His revealed Word as the impulse for the cre-
ation of new possibilities in individual consciousness, human relation-

64            The Journal of Bahá’í Studies 18. 1/4. 2008

ships, and advancement in the social order: the impetus behind civilization
building is divine revelation. Therefore, when in the late 1800s Bahá’u’lláh
wrote, “Soon will the present-day order be rolled up and a new one spread
out in its stead” (Gleanings 7), He clearly prognosticated the scope and
magnitude of the changes that humanity would undergo as a result of the
transforming role of His Revelation. In the book Century of Light, cover-
ing the second centenary of Bahá’í history and prepared under the super-
vision of the Universal House of Justice, the distinctive nature of that
reconstruction is described as “the revolutionary change in the very struc-
ture of society and the willing submission of human nature to Divine
Law that, in the final analysis, can alone produce the necessary changes in
attitude and behaviour” (25) and ultimately bring about changes to the
social, political, and economic life of humanity.

In Ishráqát (“Splendors”), Bahá’u’lláh writes, “[E]very atom in existence
is moved to testify that such means as lead to the elevation, the advance-
ment, the education, the protection and regeneration of the peoples of the
earth have been clearly set forth by Us and are revealed in the Holy Books
and Tablets by the Pen of Glory” (Tablets 130). In this and countless other
passages, Bahá’u’lláh establishes the evolutionary nature of the social
order and its continuous progression to higher stages of development.
Renewal, exaltation, revival, and advancement are among some of the
major themes of Bahá’u’lláh’s writings. An enduring feature of these texts
is the permanence of change in both the life of the individual and that of
the social order.

The idea of continuous change as an enduring theme of Bahá’u’lláh’s
Revelation is further expounded in the writings of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, Who
states, “[T]he times never remain the same, for change is a necessary qual-
ity and an essential attribute of this world, and of time and place” (qtd. in
Universal House of Justice, Messages 35.7a). Shoghi Effendi describes the
world as “moving on towards its destiny” (Promised Day 200), envisioning
the future as one in which humankind will undergo a reconstruction
which “as the result of the universal recognition of its oneness and
wholeness, will bring in its wake the spiritualization of the masses, conse-
quent to the recognition of the character, and the acknowledgement of

the claims, of the Faith of Bahá’u’lláh—the essential condition to that
ultimate fusion of all races, creeds, classes, and nations which must signal-
ize the emergence of His New World Order” (202).

Changes already brought on by modernity were enhanced by the
visionary teachings of Bahá’u’lláh. What is remarkable about the Bahá’í
writings is the sweeping nature of the changes they introduce in relation
to the reorganization of the world based on Bahá’u’lláh’s central principle
of the unification of humankind. His writings establish principles such as
freedom of thought, an unfettered search after truth, religious tolerance,
equal rights, opportunity and privileges for women and men, universal
education, abolition of extremes of wealth and poverty, promotion of the
harmony between science and religion, collective security, disarmament,
globalization, and the establishment of a permanent and universal peace.
All such principles form the social structure of a planetary civilization in
which individuals, acting on spiritual principles, are expected to uphold
their moral obligations and responsibilities, and divinely ordained institu-
tions are responsible to apply justice.

Shoghi Effendi explains that the significance of Bahá’u’lláh’s prophetic
vision for the future world civilization was “uttered at a time when its pos-
sibility had not yet been seriously envisaged in any part of the world”
(World Order 47). In one of his letters, “The Unfoldment of World Civili-
zation,” written in 1936, Shoghi Effendi renders the following vision of
the sweeping changes that will bring about the future Bahá’í common-
wealth:

> The causes of religious strife will be permanently removed, econom-
> ic barriers and restrictions will be completely abolished, and the inor-
> dinate distinction between classes will be obliterated. Destitution on
> the one hand, and gross accumulation of ownership on the other, will
> disappear. The enormous energy dissipated and wasted on war,
> whether economic or political, will be consecrated to such ends as will
> extend the range of human inventions and technical development, to
> the increase of the productivity of mankind, to the extermination of
> disease, to the extension of scientific research, to the raising of the
66            The Journal of Bahá’í Studies 18. 1/4. 2008

> standard of physical health, to the sharpening and refinement of the
> human brain, to the exploitation of the unused and unsuspected
> resources of the planet, to the prolongation of human life, and to the
> furtherance of any other agency that can stimulate the intellectual,
> the moral, and spiritual life of the entire human race. (World Order
> 140)

Unlike the materialist perspective which has dominated the develop-
ment of modernity, the Bahá’í Faith places emphasis on the need for a
spiritually based civilization. In order to ensure success in the develop-
ment of the material world, the Bahá’í writings stress the importance of
its construction upon a spiritual, divine culture. This concept is elaborat-
ed in the following extract from ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s writings:

> [A]lthough material civilization is one of the means for the progress
> of the world of mankind, yet until it becomes combined with Divine
> civilization, the desired result, which is the felicity of mankind, will
> not be attained. . . . Material civilization is like a lamp-glass. Divine
> civilization is the lamp itself and the glass without the light is dark.
> Material civilization is like the body. No matter how infinitely grace-
> ful, elegant and beautiful it may be, it is dead. Divine civilization is
> like the spirit, and the body gets its life from the spirit, otherwise it
> becomes a corpse. It has thus been made evident that the world of
> mankind is in need of the breaths of the Holy Spirit. Without the
> spirit the world of mankind is lifeless, and without this light the
> world of mankind is in utter darkness. (Selections 317–18)

Thus, the Bahá’í approach to modernity is completely at variance with
the contemporary view that is focused on a materialist enterprise devoid
of the divine or spiritual component. The Bahá’í standpoint seeks to rec-
oncile the spiritual and material dimensions of civilization.9 As stated in
Century of Light, “as with every great civilization in history, until it is so
animated, and its spiritual faculties awakened, it will find neither peace,
nor justice, nor a unity that rises above the level of negotiation and com-
promise” (144).

The features and challenges of modernity have more recently been out-
lined in a letter dated 26 November 2003, written by the Universal House
of Justice: “[The] challenge of modernity . . . has become the inescapable
preoccupation of populations throughout the planet, not the least the peo-
ples of the Islamic world.” The letter provides the details of that chal-
lenge by defining the Bahá’í perspective on modernity as follows: “The
meaning of modernity and the features of that rising flood of cultural
revolution were explicitly identified in [‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s] message: constitu-
tional and democratic government, the rule of law, universal education,
the protection of human rights, economic development, religious toler-
ance, the promotion of useful sciences and technologies and programmes
of public welfare.”

It was in The Secret of Divine Civilization, a treatise written by ‘Abdu’l-
Bahá in 1875, that these features of modernity were first outlined. Shoghi
Effendi described this unique work as an “outstanding contribution to the
future reorganization of the world” (World Order 37). In it ‘Abdu’l-Bahá
challenges the reader to consider the achievements that are “emanations
of the human mind,” “to lay hold of whatsoever will further civilization
and the arts of living,” “to encourage the acquisition of useful arts and of
general knowledge, to inform oneself as to the truths of such physical sci-
ences as are beneficial to man, and to widen the scope of industry and
increase the products of commerce and multiply the nation’s avenues of
wealth,” “to establish law and order in the cities . . . facilitate transporta-
tion and travel . . . to stimulate the creation of new industries” (Secret 2, 3,
101–2).

He, furthermore, asserts that everyone should be involved in “contin-
ually . . . establishing new bases for human happiness and creating and
promoting new instrumentalities toward this end” (Secret 3–4). The mes-
sage which emanates from these desirable characteristics of the modern
age, as put forth by ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, is one which calls for constancy on the
part of the individual to strive to stretch and broaden his or her endow-
ments and capacities to their furthest limits in the promotion of the well-
being and happiness of humanity and to ensure the continual progres-
sion of the social order both in the spiritual and the material realms.
Thus, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá places emphasis on the necessity for the application of

68            The Journal of Bahá’í Studies 18. 1/4. 2008

spiritual principles in shaping modern society and in guaranteeing its
continual advancement.

The Universal House of Justice explains that ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, in com-
mending the material achievements of civilization, “made it clear [in The
Secret of Divine Civilization] that He was not proposing simply a credulous
imitation of the West. On the contrary,” the House of Justice explains, “in
uncompromising language, He portrayed European society as drowning
‘in the sea of passion and desire’, trapped in a materialistic perception of
reality that could bring in its wake nothing but disillusionment” (26
November 2003).

The Secret of Divine Civilization provides a blueprint for the moderniza-
tion of Iran written prior to the beginning of the twentieth century.
‘Abdu’l-Bahá writes that Iran should do all in its power to bring about
reforms already in place in other lands (referring in particular to the
West), and insists that the “foreign importation” of “laws, principles and
fundamentals of progress on the highest levels of a fully developed soci-
ety, which are current in the other countries” is fitting to the needs of the
people of Persia (115). Rather than rejecting modernization, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá
suggests embracing it as the means to ensure the progress and develop-
ment of the society. He writes, “Today throughout the five continents of
the globe it is Europe and most sections of America that are renowned for
law and order, government and commerce, art and industry, science, phi-
losophy and education” (10).

A cursory survey of the intellectual history of nineteenth-century
Iran, and the range of ideas set forth by the Iranian intellectuals of the
time, reveals the far-sightedness of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s vision in relation to the
scope and nature of the reforms necessary for the progress of the Iranian
people and nation as well as for all societies.10

In examining the influence of modernity within the context of contem-
porary society, One Common Faith offers a thought-provoking overview of
the positive historical changes which the application of the features of
modernity brought about and places them in the context of the twenty-
first century. At the same time, the role of religion is clarified—in this case

the Bahá’í Faith—as the impetus which drives the advance of society both
materially and spiritually:

> The rational soul does not merely occupy a private sphere, but is an
> active participant in a social order. Although the received truths of
> the great faiths remain valid, the daily experience of an individual in
> the twenty-first century is unimaginably removed from the one that
> he or she would have known in any of those ages when this guidance
> was revealed. Democratic decision-making has fundamentally altered
> the relationship of the individual to authority. With growing confi-
> dence and growing success, women justly insist on their right to full
> equality with men. Revolutions in science and technology change not
> only the functioning but the conception of society, indeed of exis-
> tence itself. Universal education and an explosion of new fields of
> creativity open the way to insights that stimulate social mobility and
> integration, and create opportunities of which the rule of law
> encourages the citizen to take full advantage. Stem cell research,
> nuclear energy, sexual identity, ecological stress and the use of
> wealth raise, at the very least, social questions that have no precedent.
> These and countless other changes affecting every aspect of human
> life, have brought into being a new world of daily choices for both
> society and its members. What has not changed is the inescapable
> requirement of making such choices, whether for better or worse. It
> is here that the spiritual nature of the contemporary crisis comes into
> sharpest focus because most of the decisions called for are not mere-
> ly practical but moral. In large part, therefore, loss of faith in tradi-
> tional religion has been an inevitable consequence of failure to dis-
> cover in it the guidance required to live with modernity, successfully
> and with assurance. (One Common Faith, 15–16)

The moral dilemma which today challenges the well-being of humanity
has caused sociologists and other leading thinkers to search deep for viable
solutions to the moral decay and bankruptcy so prevalent in today’s society.

One of the most powerful observations which ‘Abdu’l-Bahá made in The
Secret of Divine Civilization, and which provides insights into the socio-
logical observations regarding modernity’s dark side, concerns the conse-
quences that result from the lack of spiritual education and refinement of
the human character. He wrote:

There are some who imagine that an innate sense of human digni-
> ty will prevent man from committing evil actions and insure his spir-
> itual and material perfection. That is, that an individual who is char-
> acterized with natural intelligence, high resolve, and a driving zeal,
> will, without any consideration for the severe punishments conse-
> quent on evil acts, or for the great rewards of righteousness, instinc-
> tively refrain from inflicting harm on his fellow men and will hunger
> and thirst to do good. And yet, if we ponder the lessons of history it
will become evident that this very sense of honor and dignity is itself

> one of the bounties deriving from the instructions of the Prophets of
> God . . . It is therefore clear that the emergence of this natural sense
> of human dignity and honor is the result of education. (97–98)

Within the emerging worldwide Bahá’í community, now over 160 years
old, an organic process of civilization building has been set in motion
whose aim is the unity of the human race. Within this highly diverse com-
munity, all the features of modernity, as set forth in the Bahá’í texts, are
painstakingly in the process of development. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá explained the
all-encompassing power and influence of the Bahá’í Faith on all societies
by stating that “[t]he teachings of Bahá’u’lláh are such that all the com-
munities of the world, whether religious, political or ethical, ancient or
modern, find in them the expression of their highest wish” (Selections 304).
Although Bahá’í laws and principles, as revealed by Bahá’u’lláh, cannot be
forced on any individual or society, they, nevertheless, belong to all who
inhabit the earth regardless of culture, ethnicity, race, nationality, and the
like.

In its Peace Statement written in 1985, the Universal House of Justice
offered to the world the experience of the Bahá’í community as the milieu
in which the application of Bahá’í principles, including the features of mo-
dernity, is advancing toward the construction and unification of a global
community:

> It is a community of . . . people drawn from many nations, cultures,
> classes and creeds, engaged in a wide range of activities serving the
> spiritual, social and economic needs of the peoples of many lands. It is
> a single social organism, representative of the diversity of the human
> family, conducting its affairs through a system of commonly accepted
> consultative principles, and cherishing equally all the great outpourings
> of divine guidance in human history. Its existence is yet another con-
> vincing proof of the practicality of its Founder’s vision of a united
> world, another evidence that humanity can live as one global society,
> equal to whatever challenges its coming of age may entail. (Promise 36)

The Bahá’í perspective, far from being naive, faces the challenge of
72            The Journal of Bahá’í Studies 18. 1/4. 2008

modernity head on, suggesting that responsibility rests with the mem-
bers of humankind acting with determination to heal the many social ills
plaguing the global community, thereby ensuring the progress and
advancement of civilization. It is the inescapable responsibility of the
individual to take on resolutely the contemporary challenges, and through
hard work, discipline, and sacrifice, apply the relevant solutions to the cur-
rent problems. Just as in former times history has shown humanity’s
resilience in responding to the need for breakthrough and transcendence
under the most difficult of circumstances, so too can the present genera-
tion and those to follow accomplish the goal of transforming the contin-
uously changing social order.

In The Secret of Divine Civilization ‘Abdu’l-Bahá astutely describes the
nature of our current crisis: “Today we have closed our eyes to every righ-
teous act and have sacrificed the abiding happiness of society to our own
transitory profit. We regard fanaticism and zealotry as redounding to our
credit and honor, and not content with this, we denounce one another and
plot each other’s ruin. . . . The edifice of religion has crumbled, the foun-
dations of faiths have been blown to the winds . . . the whole world has
fallen into error; when it comes to repelling tyranny all are soft and
remiss” (56).

In closing, we come back to the power and influence of knowledge and
education, especially regarding spiritual values, on human development,
which ‘Abdu’l-Bahá identifies as a fundamental means for the progress of
society. On this theme the Universal House of Justice writes: “All the evi-
dence inescapably demonstrates that the principal influence in the gradual
civilizing of human character, far from being a simple endowment of
nature, has been the effect produced on the rational soul by the guidance
of the successive Messengers of God.” It is through the application of
this guidance that humanity is capable of renewal, progress, and refine-
ment. It is through the intervention of the Manifestations of God, writes
the Universal House of Justice, “that the peoples of the world, of whatev-
er nation or religion, have learned the values and ideals that have empow-
ered them to put material resources and technological means at the serv-
ice of human betterment. It is They who, in each age, have defined the
meaning and requirements of modernity” (26 November 2003). As in the

former civilizations of the Axial Age, or the society that blossomed dur-
ing the Renaissance, the Enlightenment, and now in the modern world,
the waters of the river of divine revelation continue to channel the whole
of humanity toward “an ever-advancing civilization” (Bahá’u’lláh,
Gleanings 214), destined to progressively and over time evolve into a plan-
etary commonwealth.

monwealth as follows: “The unity of the human race, as envisaged by Bahá’u’lláh,
implies the establishment of a world commonwealth in which all nations, races,
creeds and classes are closely and permanently united, and in which the autonomy
of its state members and the personal freedom and initiative of the individuals
that compose them are definitely and completely safeguarded” (World Order 203).
